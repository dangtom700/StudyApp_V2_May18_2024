Preface to the First Edition
This textbook is the result of a long experience teaching general agronomy at the 
University of Cordoba (Spain). After many years of teaching the subject to agron￾omy engineering students in Spanish, we now offer a separate class, taught in 
English, and this book refects the organization and materials used in the class.
The book refects our vision of agronomy as a complex, integrative subject at the 
crossroads of many disciplines (Crop Ecology, Agrometeorology, Soil Science, 
Agricultural Engineering) with a strong emphasis on providing quantitative answers 
to specifc problems. Our experience has been primarily with water-limited agricul￾ture, hence there is an emphasis throughout the book on the role of water in the 
agronomy of agricultural systems. We also seek to leave behind artifcial boundaries 
that have been created in the past among crop production areas such as Horticulture, 
Pomology, and Field Crops that have led to separate journals and professional 
careers in the past. In this book we cover all common aspects of crop management 
and productivity that should concern anyone dealing with the management of agri￾cultural systems and we provide relevant examples from different cropping systems, 
from herbaceous to woody crops.
Our quantitative approach is based on providing the ideas and concepts needed 
as foundations in all the quantitative assessments required for making informed, 
technical decisions in farm management. Farmers operate along the philosophy of 
learning by doing (adaptive management) and agronomists should also follow the 
same path, but they should have the knowledge and tools that are needed to frst 
correctly interpret the complex responses of the system to change, and then provide 
reasonable options for subsequent actions. This book does not fall in the category of 
those that focus on providing prescriptive agronomic recommendations or blue￾prints that cannot be generalized because of their empirical nature. Rather, we have 
tried to concentrate on the analysis of crop productivity processes which lead to 
identifying the main factors affecting management decisions, and on how to get 
quantitative answers to agronomic problems in the context of making current agri￾cultural systems more sustainable.
From a teaching perspective the book includes two short blocks on the environ￾ment and crop productivity that could serve as an introduction for students with no 
background in Soil Science, Crop Ecology or Agrometeorology. The third, larger 
block, is devoted to specifc crop production techniques (sowing, soil management, 
irrigation, fertilizers, etc.). A number of our colleagues have contributed to the vi
writing all with the aim of providing future agronomists and practitioners with the 
quantitative tools required to calculate the adequate level of inputs (such as water, 
nutrients, or energy) for sustainable crop production, and to assess the yield 
responses as a function of climate and soil conditions, and of management options.
Preface to the First Editionvii
Preface
Agronomy is a mature discipline that integrates a set of practices, discussed in this 
book, required for crop production. Despite the relatively recent publication of the 
frst edition of this book (2016), we have perceived the need to revise it and publish 
a second edition, less than nine years after the frst one. The main reason is that over 
the last decade, the adoption of new tools and methods in agronomy has accelerated, 
contributing to the improvement of agricultural practices. This book is oriented 
toward the sustainability of agricultural systems, understood as maintaining or 
enhancing productivity over time without deteriorating the environment. 
Furthermore, the principles and applications described here are aligned with the 
sustainable intensifcation of agricultural production as the most logical approach to 
ensuring suffcient food production for a growing world population with minimal 
land expansion and negative consequences for nature.
As a result of climate and soil variations, crop production is variable in space and 
time, and coping with such variations is a fundamental challenge to modern agron￾omy now and in the future. In addition to revising and updating the content of the 
37 chapters of the frst edition, this revised version has four new chapters focused on 
tools and methods used in spatial analyses of soil and crop properties. As novel soil 
and plant sensors for assessing soil and plant water status have been developed, 
Chap. 21 discusses soil and plant sensors for irrigation scheduling as an alternative 
to the water balance, the established method. Over the last 40 years, remote sensing 
of crop optical properties has seen substantial advances, but the explosion of differ￾ent applications has mostly occurred over the last decade. The increase in resolution 
and the expansion of its use to map different vegetation properties, from biomass to 
evapotranspiration, makes remote sensing a powerful tool to assess spatial varia￾tions, as is discussed in the new Chap. 38. Spatial variations in crop growth and soil 
and water properties present management challenges at feld and farm scales. 
Heterogeneous feld units treated homogeneously in pest control, mineral fertiliza￾tion, and irrigation would have areas that would receive less or more inputs relative 
to the average needs. Site-specifc input applications will result not only in higher 
net profts but in a reduction of pollution risks as well. This is described in a new 
chapter (39) on site-specifc agriculture, also termed precision farming. The fourth 
new chapter (Chap. 40) is devoted to crop simulation modeling and its usage in 
decision support systems, alone or with other complementary tools such as remote viii
sensing and soil and plant sensors for real-time simulation updates. Additionally, 
this edition has four new chapters dealing with issues not fully covered in the previ￾ous version. One is the energy consumption in agriculture (Chap. 37), an aspect 
often overlooked in the past where the focus has been on energy production by 
agriculture. The adaptation and mitigation of agriculture to climate change is now 
fully discussed in Chap. 41. Water and soil conservation topics are enriched with 
two new chapters: Chap. 23 on optimizing irrigation management and design, and 
Chap. 30 on soil improvement and reclamation. A new feature is presented at the 
end of this book with two new chapters (Chaps. 43 and 44) describing a practical 
exercise based on the book content, aimed at analyzing quantitatively most features 
of an irrigated agricultural system. Those using this book as a textbook could adapt 
the exercises proposed here to other agricultural systems that may be more relevant 
in their geographical locations. Overall, this second edition has been expanded and 
has about 25 percent more content than the original version of this book. We hope 
that the book will contribute to supporting science-based decisions on agricultural 
policies as opposed to the increasing trend of using misconceptions founded on the 
perceptions of part of urban societies.
Principles of Agronomy for Sustainable Agriculture is a piece of collective work, 
written by many co-authors (17) to whom we are extremely grateful. All of them 
have contributed their time and effort to distill fundamental knowledge from their 
specialties, and have given a diversity of agronomic perspectives to the different 
chapters. Particularly, we would like to remember here all the meaningful contribu￾tions that Luciano Mateos made to this book. His unique insight into the different 
angles of irrigation, from design to management, has been a beacon to many irriga￾tionists around the world and has provided this book with a special focus on the 
irrigated agriculture of temperate climates. He passed away at the end of 2022 
before he could fnalize the revisions of his chapters. We dedicate this book to him.

and Francisco J. Villalobos
Abstract
Crop ecology deals with agricultural ecosystems that are manipulated by man to 
funnel the maximum energy into usable products (food and raw materials). 
Agricultural ecosystems show generally lower biodiversity and autonomy and a 
shorter trophic chain than natural ecosystems. The main features of farming sys￾tems are productivity, stability, resilience, and sustainability, the latter indicating 
the ability to maintain a certain level of production indefnitely. Production of 
agricultural systems requires inputs of matter, energy, and information. Normally 
the economic optimum provision of inputs is below that necessary to achieve 
maximum production. Various parameters have been defned to characterize the 
productivity of agricultural systems (potential, attainable, and actual yield).
Agricultural systems may be classifed according to different criteria. 
According to the length of the trophic chain, the higher effciency is obtained 
with a system where crops are directly used by humans. However, animal hus￾bandry allows the exploitation of areas marginal for food crop production and the 
use of residues. According to intensifcation, agricultural systems have evolved 
from subsistence agriculture to intensive modern systems where the main chal￾lenge is sustainability. The carrying capacity, the number of animals that can be 
fed by the primary production of a given area, may be also calculated for humans 
growing cereals taking into account that an individual requires around 300 kg 
grain/year to meet the energy and protein demand.

1.1 Ecology and Ecosystems
Ecology is the discipline that studies the relationships between the organisms living 
in a given space, called “habitat,” and their surrounding environment. Within this 
defnition, the environment is understood as an ensemble of biotic and abiotic fea￾tures that affect the growth, reproduction ability, and life span of individual organ￾isms. Therefore, environmental factors integrate both other living organisms and 
purely physical features determined by weather and soil conditions that interact 
with the studied individual. Environmental factors can also be classifed as resources 
when they are directly consumed by the organism (e.g., nutrients), and regulators, 
when they affect the rate at which resources are used (e.g., temperature).
The ecosystem represents the fundamental unit of study in ecology. It comprises 
all the living organisms and the physical environment in which they live and with 
which they interact. This defnition does not imply any spatial scale: both the stom￾ach of a ruminant and a large grassland where ruminants graze may be considered 
ecosystems. By including both the biotic and abiotic components, the ecosystem is 
a complex system with dynamic behavior over time. Ecosystem responses are often 
explained by the integration of processes at lower levels of biological organization 
(from molecules and cells to individual organisms) which obey basic physical, 
chemical, and biological laws such as those of mass and energy conservation and 
thermodynamics. This implies that ecology is a synthetic science that draws from 
several disciplines.
Ecologists aim to understand how an organism fts into its environment. In this 
regard, the term ecological niche describes all the combinations of biotic and abiotic 
factors that allow the population of a given species to persist over time. Some 
authors decompose the concept between fundamental and effective niches. The frst 
defnes the entire range of conditions in which organisms, free of interference from 
other species, survive and reproduce, while the latter is narrower, as it accounts for 
the pressure exerted by other organisms. The defnition of ecological niches is rel￾evant as they defne the places where a species can be found or succeed if intro￾duced, while also revealing the conditions in which biological interactions among 
different species are theoretically possible: two species will not interfere if there is 
not some overlap between their niches.
Box 1.1: Biological Interactions
Biological interactions among organisms living in the same ecosystem can be 
classifed according to the impacts on the individuals involved:
• Competition: The presence of the two organisms is detrimental for both. 
This usually happens when both organisms exploit a resource that is in 
scarce availability (e.g., radiation, nutrients, water) and may involve indi￾viduals of the same (e.g., neighboring plants of a crop competing against 
each other) or different species (e.g., weeds vs crop plants).
(continued)
E. Fereres et al.3
The organisms in an ecosystem are interrelated by fows of energy and materials 
(carbon, nutrients, and water). The dimensional characterization of the energy fows 
in the ecosystem is called the trophic chain. The primary source of energy is solar 
radiation, the driving force of life on Earth. The trophic level defnes the position of 
an organism concerning the entry of energy into the ecosystem. The frst level is 
integrated by autotrophs, called primary producers, which fx solar energy through 
photosynthesis, transforming it into usable energy that will move along the trophic 
chain. Higher trophic levels are numbered consecutively, including primary (organ￾isms feeding on plants), secondary (carnivores that eat herbivores), and tertiary con￾sumers (carnivores that eat carnivores). In practice, this picture is an oversimplifcation 
of reality, since many organisms can feed on (or be eaten by) organisms from sev￾eral trophic levels. Here emerges the concept of trophic or food web, which is the 
natural interconnection of the different food chains in place within an ecosystem. 
For instance, microbial populations at the end of trophic webs use residues or dead 
tissues from different organisms in the ecosystem, irrespective of their trophic level.
Most wavelengths of solar radiation are of no use for photosynthesis, so most 
part of the incoming radiation is refected or invested in heating the air and the soil 
or in evaporating water, as discussed in Chaps. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in this book. In addi￾tion, an important fraction of the energy assimilated by plants through photosynthe￾sis is not stored as biomass but consumed by respiration to provide the energy 
required for the growth and maintenance of metabolism. In ecology, the total amount 
• Antagonism: The interaction is benefcial for one of the individuals and 
detrimental for the other. This category includes depredation, herbivory, 
and parasitism, although the borders among them are sometimes diffcult 
to delimitate. Predators kill and eat other organisms, their prey. As an 
example, many birds and arthropods prey on pests, helping to reduce their 
impact on crops. Herbivores feed on living plant tissues with vegetation 
often being able to recover. Response to herbivory depends on the feeding 
habits of the animal and plant architectural traits. Finally, parasites are 
organisms that live on or inside another organism, the host, which decreases 
its ftness. Both phytophagous arthropods and pathogens causing pests and 
diseases, respectively, are considered crop parasites.
• Mutualism: The two organisms cooperate, and both beneft from the pres￾ence of the other (e.g., pollinators and entomophilous plants). The term 
symbiosis is also used when the two organisms live in close association. 
That is the case of some nitrogen-fxing bacteria living in association with 
legumes in root nodules.
• Commensalism and amensalism: They have positive (commensalism) or 
negative (amensalism) impacts on one of the organisms while the other is 
not affected by the presence of the frst. They are of limited relevance in the 
context of crop ecology.

of energy assimilated by photosynthesis in an ecosystem is known as gross primary 
productivity, while that effectively converted into the biomass of primary producers 
is called net primary productivity. On average, each transfer to higher trophic levels 
has a net effciency of about 10%, with most of the energy going to metabolic pro￾cesses such as growth, respiration, and reproduction. Thus, secondary productivity, 
the energy assimilated by heterotrophs in the next trophic levels, is always lower 
than that stored in the biomass of the primary producers in the ecosystem.
The transfer of energy through the ecosystem is unidirectional since it dissipates 
when moving from one trophic level to the next. By contrast, the movement of 
chemicals at the biosphere level is cyclical, since they can be reused. This means 
that the same atoms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, etc., can be exchanged 
between different types of organisms, the soil, the oceans, or the atmosphere over 
the course of millennia. By decomposing dead biomass, soil microorganisms play a 
critical role in closing the nutrient cycles in ecosystems.
1.2 Crop Ecology and Agricultural Systems
Over millions of years, man has obtained the energy required for living from differ￾ent trophic chains, by hunting and gathering edible plants until 10,000 years ago, 
when agriculture was invented. Farming allows man to produce food and other 
products by managing and manipulating the trophic webs of ecosystems. Agriculture 
is a set of human interventions that alter ecosystems to maximize the yield of the 
desired product and minimize energy losses along trophic chains. The science and 
technology of producing and using plants for human use is Agronomy. It deals with 
the exploitation by man of terrestrial ecosystems and has, therefore, its roots in ecol￾ogy. The ecosystems modifed by agriculture are called agroecosystems and the 
science that deals with their study is Crop Ecology. An agroecosystem is an ecosys￾tem managed with the ultimate goal of producing food and other goods and services 
derived from agriculture. Population pressure has reduced the area of ecosystems 
free of human intervention. However, there are reserves, forests, and other areas that 
may be called natural ecosystems, which are generally characterized by higher bio￾diversity, longer trophic chains, and higher autonomy than agroecosystems.
The agroecosystem is characterized by the presence of a lower number of species 
than the natural ecosystem. This lower diversity is a result of the need to reduce 
energy losses along trophic chains in agricultural ecosystems, which aim to remove 
all unwanted energy transfers (to parasites, pathogens, or plants which compete 
with the crop) and is usually associated with a shortening of the trophic chain. The 
energy autonomy of agroecosystems is relatively low because they depend on inputs 
of materials, energy, and information provided by humans.
The unit of study in Crop Ecology is the feld or plot. A community of plants, along 
with management practices (e.g., tillage method, rotation, etc.) located on a feld is 
called a cropping system. At this level, one can analyze the production processes of 
plants, their relationships with the soil, and their dependence on the aerial environ￾ment. By observing the same plot for several years, we can analyze the effects of 
E. Fereres et al.5
rotation, tillage practices, or crop residue management on soil properties and resulting 
yields, as they are affected by the use of resources such as water and nutrients. 
Economic analyses or determining manpower needs are often made at the plot scale. 
A farm represents a single management unit constituted by several felds or plots.
At a higher level of organization, the cropping system is part of a farming system 
where other elements (e.g., livestock) are also managed by the farmer providing 
inputs to the crops or using crop products. The different crops and management 
practices prevalent in a given area are called agricultural systems at a regional scale.
Agriculture, like all human activities, has known successes and failures through￾out its history. Today agriculture produces enough food for the vast majority of the 
world population, despite the unprecedented population growth experienced over 
the last 50 years (see Sect. 1.6). However, it has also negative environmental impacts 
such as soil degradation and water pollution from the use of fertilizers and pesti￾cides, and the reduction of biodiversity. Furthermore, other sectors of society are 
very sensitive to a diverse set of problems created by agriculture, notably those 
related to food safety and to its expansion threatening natural ecosystems.
1.3 Characteristics of Agricultural Systems
The primary objective of farming is the production of suffcient food and other 
goods and services so that the farm stays viable. Therefore, a key feature of farming 
systems is their productivity, defned as output per unit of resource used, commonly 
referred as the cultivated area, which is the primary limiting factor of agriculture. 
Thus, productivity is defned as the yield of usable product per unit area but can be 
applied to other natural or artifcial inputs such as radiation, water, nutrients, or 
labor, which are also typically measured per unit of area. In areas of favorable cli￾mate such as the tropics, it is useful to consider the productivity per unit area per 
unit time, as different cropping sequences vary in productivity per unit area depend￾ing on the duration of individual crops. For instance, a sequence of three short￾season rice crops is more productive than another one of two long-season rice crops. 
The productivity level further serves as an indirect measure of the effciency with 
which these inputs are used.
When characterizing agricultural systems, the term effciency is often used to 
defne the ratios of crop productivity and certain inputs. For example, the effciency 
of water use is defned as the ratio of yield to the volume of water used, but it would 
be more correct to speak of the productivity of water or nutrients, expressed as 
kg/m3
 water or kg/kg nutrient. In engineering, effciency is the ratio between the 
output and the input of any entity in a system; for example, the energy supplied to 
an engine.
Besides productivity and effciency, there are other important properties of agri￾cultural systems. Yields may vary from year to year due to weather variations and 
other causes. The term stability refers to the magnitude of these oscillations. The 
lack of stability causes fuctuations in production that threaten the persistence of 
agricultural systems. This is particularly true when there are sequences of 
1 Agriculture and Agricultural Systems6
successive years of low yields that may have a catastrophic effect on their economic 
viability. Related to the fuctuations in productivity, there is another feature termed 
resilience, defned as the capacity of the system to recover from a catastrophic event, 
like a drought. High resilience is a desirable property of agroecosystems.
Another feature of farming systems is their sustainability, which indicates the 
ability to maintain a certain level of production indefnitely. This feature stems from 
the concept of sustainable development, a development model that proposes eco￾nomic growth without adversely affecting the opportunities of future generations. A 
farming system is considered sustainable when it is economically viable and socially 
acceptable, however, one must defne the time frame, because what is feasible and 
acceptable today may not be so in the future. Thus, in agricultural systems, it would 
be more correct to speak of the degree of sustainability: a system will be more 
sustainable when its exploitation does not degrade the quality of water and soil 
resources, and when current management practices do not affect the productivity 
and viability of the system in the future. The improvement of the sustainability 
should be based on two objectives: reducing or eliminating, if possible, the negative 
environmental effects of agriculture while maintaining high productivity. Decades 
of intensive production in many agricultural systems have caused negative environ￾mental effects and have created awareness of the need to focus on the sustainability 
of the agricultural systems, leading to a debate about developing new forms of agri￾culture that can ensure economic and ecological sustainability. The need for produc￾tion intensifcation stems from the requirement to produce suffcient food for the 
current and future world population, but it must be ensured that such intensifcation 
is sustainable in the long run.
1.4 Management of Agricultural Systems
The strategy of agriculture is to manipulate the environment and the plant commu￾nity to optimize the yield of goods useful to mankind. This involves establishing 
communities (crops or pastures) dominated by species that allocate a large propor￾tion of the primary production to usable organs or materials. In addition, the farmer 
tries to minimize system losses due to insects, diseases, and weeds.
Farmers have numerous management tools to control their crops, such as tillage 
for weed removal and seedbed preparation, choice of species and cultivars, sowing 
date and sowing density, application of fertilizers and pesticides, etc. External fac￾tors such as climate and markets are diffcult to predict so the fexibility in managing 
the crop is very important to minimize the risk of crop failure or economic losses in 
the farm. For example, an application of fertilizer may be reduced or waived if the 
rainfall is very low or if the expected price of the product is also low.
In general, for many resources the response curve of yield versus input level is 
curvilinear and the maximum proft is obtained at a level of resources below (but not 
far from) that required for maximum yield. This is because of the synergies that 
occur among different inputs and of the addition of fxed costs, which make low￾input strategies generally ineffcient. The more productive and more proftable 
farms are those that use resource levels that are commensurate with the production 
E. Fereres et al.7
target, without any input limiting yield. For example, there is little point in provid￾ing additional water as irrigation if the additional quantities of fertilizer required to 
realize the targeted yield are not provided.
The criteria for managing agricultural systems must take into account many fac￾tors that are affected by farmer decisions. Not only plant and animal production 
processes are important, as are economic objectives, but also the effects on soils, 
water, animal welfare and human health, landscape and biodiversity, among others, 
have to be considered. All these items have a different weight depending on the 
farming system under consideration, although, as in any other business, when the 
farm is not dedicated to the subsistence of the owner, it is handled essentially based 
on economic criteria. Nevertheless, there are many facets to the management of 
farming systems. In areas where the ratio of population/arable land and input prices 
is low (e.g., the USA and Australia), the emphasis is on maximizing proft per unit 
of labor. In Northern and Central Europe and in Japan, where arable land is the 
limiting factor and input prices and wages are high, farmers tend to maximize pro￾ductivity per unit area. Similar goals are pursued in the agriculture of China and 
India due to the limited availability of land per farm. These situations contrast with 
those of many poor countries where labor is abundant and access to inputs and capi￾tal is scarce.
Crop yields are close to their maximum potential only in a few areas (as in farms 
in Japan and Northern Europe) so the average yields of agricultural systems are 
generally poor indicators of potential productivity. Actual yields lie in a broad inter￾val from zero (crop failure) to a maximum attainable level which is only limited by 
the aerial environment (solar radiation and temperature regime). The maximum 
attainable yield level is called potential yield. Actual yield is defned as the average 
Example 1.1
The response of wheat to N fertilizer in a rainfed Mediterranean area is shown 
in the table below. The selling price is 0.25 €/kg, the fertilizer cost is 0.80 €/
kg  N and the fxed cost is 200  €/ha. The highest yield is achieved using 
250 kg N/ha. However, the economic optimum is achieved with an application 
of 200 kg N/ha. In this case, a very limited use of fertilizer leads to worse 
economic performance than the overuse.

yield of a cultivar in all the felds of a farm or of a specifc region. It represents the 
state of the climate and soil and the ability of farmers to apply successfully the avail￾able technology.
The potential yield of a species in an area is achieved when the technology is not 
limiting, that is when all inputs are used optimally. Strictly, this concept applies to 
the yield of a well-ft cultivar with no limitations due to water or nutrients and full 
control of weeds, pests, and diseases. In general, the potential yield is calculated 
using theoretical models based on climate and other environmental factors and the 
morphological and physiological characteristics of the crop in question. In practice, 
these estimates of potential yield should be contrasted against record yields obtained 
by the best farmers in the same geographical area.
There is a considerable gap between actual and potential yield in most agricul￾tural systems, so sometimes other yield levels are defned for diagnostic purposes. 
For example, attainable yield is defned as the yield achieved within the environ￾mental constraints of climate and soil of the area, using the best technology avail￾able. The yields obtained by the best farmers and research stations in the area are an 
indicator of attainable yield. The attainable yield in particularly favorable years 
results in record yields.
The concepts of potential and actual yield (and to some extent attainable and 
record yields) are very useful for the evaluation of farming systems and the identi￾fcation of possible improvements that will help in closing the gap between what 
farmers are achieving and what they could achieve. These concepts are also used to 
defne cultivation intensity. In the intensive agriculture of Japan and Northern 
Europe, actual yields are close to potential yields and the yield gap is small. As 
yields approach potential levels, there is little incentive for farmers to further inten￾sify production thus there is always some gap between actual and potential produc￾tion in all systems. As the difference between actual and potential yield increases, 
so do the opportunities to increase productivity.
1.5 Types of Agricultural Systems
Agricultural systems can be classifed according to various criteria. An ecologi￾cally based approach is based on the type of trophic chain. The shorter chain is 
one in which crops are directly consumed by humans. In other chains, crops or 
pastures are eaten by livestock, which in turn is consumed by humans. The energy 
effciency of a system is lower the greater the number of levels of the trophic 
chain. On average each transfer in a food chain has a net effciency of about 10%. 
Thus, for a net primary productivity of 100 units, if it is consumed directly (veg￾etarian diet), the transfer of energy is close to 100. If cattle are employed to trans￾fer the energy to humans, only 10 would be recovered. This does not imply that 
animal husbandry should be abandoned. On the one hand, animals are the only 
choice for exploiting marginal areas where crop production is not possible (see 
below). On the other hand, some animals can use materials not digestible by 
E. Fereres et al.9
humans (e.g., cellulose in crop residues) or not suitable for food (e.g., food left￾overs, residues from industrial processing).
Farming aims at minimizing energy fows through undesired routes (weeds, 
insects, etc.) that end up at the level of decomposers. As we have seen, a short food 
chain (crop ---> humans) is the most effcient from an energy transfer standpoint. 
However, in many agricultural systems, environmental conditions (for instance, 
very shallow/poor soils) prevent obtaining products for direct use by humans (e.g., 
grain) and only pastures may be grown. There is also the case of areas with semi￾permanent fooding or very arid areas. In all of these situations, cattle allow the 
conversion of primary production to other usable forms by man, even at the cost of 
lower effciency.
Agricultural systems may be characterized also according to their position within 
an interval that goes from subsistence agriculture to intensive agriculture. In subsis￾tence farming, many species are used, cultivars are adapted to the specifc environ￾ments, yield potential is low, and actual yields are low but stable. Subsistence 
farming is also very labor-intensive and livestock is a main component in nutrient 
management. This leads to high energy effciency. At the opposite extreme, inten￾sive agriculture is characterized by lower genetic diversity (both in terms of species 
and cultivars) in search of high yields, greater use of machinery replacing labor, as 
well as high use of fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in high productivity but often 
with low effciency.
Historically agriculture in developed countries has undergone a transition from 
subsistence farming to intensive agriculture with a continuous increase in produc￾tivity and a gradual decline in energy effciency. The routes differ depending on how 
land use has evolved in the different countries: For instance, Canada, Australia, and 
large parts of the USA and Argentina have not intensifed their agriculture as much 
as it has occurred in Northern and Central Europe and Japan. In many Asian coun￾tries, very intensive agriculture is practiced with high use of certain inputs and low 
yield gaps. Therefore, in some developed countries, we may fnd extensive systems 
with low inputs, but a high level of mechanization that requires large areas for the 
farm to be economically viable, while in other countries (mostly developing) highly 
productive systems with high use of labor may coexist with subsistence agricultural 
systems.
The intensifcation of agriculture in many countries has led to major pollution 
episodes due to excessive use of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides and, in 
some cases, to the production of agricultural surpluses due to ill-conceived subsi￾dies. In some cases, food safety incidents have been related by the public opinion of 
these countries to agricultural intensifcation. This has led to proposals to develop 
alternative agricultural systems, some based on avoiding the use of mineral fertil￾izers and synthetic pesticides, such as in organic farming and other forms of biologi￾cal or ecological agriculture that are considered to be based on agroecology, such as 
regenerative agriculture. Other alternatives have proposed to adopt agricultural 
practices that are environmentally friendly and that ensure the quality and safety of 
food. The term “sustainable agriculture” refers to farming practices that allow the 
1 Agriculture and Agricultural Systems10
indefnite maintenance (sustainability) of agricultural systems, which requires the 
conservation of resources and the maintenance of economically viable farms. Some 
experts speak of a transition from traditional agriculture (low input, low control) to 
intensive agriculture (high input, low control), from which we must move to a more 
sustainable agriculture (inputs optimized, high control), where resources are used 
only in the appropriate amounts for each system and where there is better control of 
the environment and the crop.
1.6 Carrying Capacity
The carrying capacity is the number of animals (or people) that can be maintained 
by the primary production of a given area of land. The main components of the 
human diet are the sources of energy and protein. A human requires 0.6 g of protein 
per kg of weight per day, although the FAO sets the minimum safety level at 0.75 g 
of protein per kg. These requirements are much less variable than the energy require￾ments that depend largely on the activity performed by the individual. If we think of 
an average human being, the daily requirements are 10.5 MJ of digestible energy 
and 50 g protein. Therefore, in one year, the energy and protein required by an indi￾vidual may be calculated as:
10.5 MJ day−1
 × 365 day = 3800 MJ year−1
50 g protein day−1
 × 365 day = 18.2 kg protein year−1
The average energy content of the plant material is 17 MJ kg−1
, so 3800 MJ can 
be obtained from 224 kg of dry matter of high digestibility. Ingestion of this amount, 
despite a low protein content (assuming a 9% protein), ensures the need for protein 
(224 kg × 0.09 = 20.2 kg protein). Cereal grains contain more than 10% protein, 
making them an ideal source of energy and protein for human consumption. A 
greater diversity of the human diet is highly desirable, among other reasons, to 
acquire the essential vitamins and minerals.
Once we know the needs of food per individual, we can calculate the carrying 
capacity of a particular agricultural system (CC, individuals ha−1
) as:
CC NP f f GE
ER
c d = (1.1)
Where NP is the net primary production (kg dry biomass ha−1
), fc is the fraction of 
NP that is consumed, fd is the fraction of the energy consumed that is digested, GE
is the gross energy content of the feed (MJ  kg−1
), and ER is the annual energy 
requirement (3800 MJ individual−1
 in the case of humans).

2 The Soil: Physical, Chemical, 
and Biological Properties
Antonio Delgado and José A. Gómez
Abstract
This chapter provides a basic description of soil as a crucial resource for agricul￾ture. Soil is a dynamic and living entity where complex interactions among its 
biological, chemical, and physical components take place. These components 
and their interactions determine the functioning of the soil; this functioning 
underlies the concept of “soil quality.” Soil quality is the capacity of soil to func￾tion within ecosystem boundaries to sustain ecosystem services, between them 
the biological productivity, and maintaining environmental quality. Thus, any 
given approach to soil quality will depend on each particular ecosystem. Land 
use and management can have a profound impact on soil quality that results in 
improvements or constraints for the productivity of agricultural lands and for 
agricultural sustainability in the long term.
2.1 Introduction
Soil is the porous three-dimensional body developed over the Earth crust able to 
store nutrients and water and to exchange gases with the atmosphere. Soil is formed 
by the combination of mineral and organic material, air, and water. Between the 
organic material, soils contain living organisms that interact with other components. 
This leads to be not only a physical media for supporting life, but also a living

system itself, which is continuously evolving. The arrangement, combination, or 
interaction between soil components determine the so-called soil properties.
Agricultural soils are vital not just for producing food and goods but also for 
providing other essential benefts for society. To understand how soils determine 
agricultural productivity it is necessary to understand how soil properties interact 
with plants. The aggregation state of soil components, i.e. soil structure, should be 
suitable for the germination of the seeds and the growth of the roots and must have 
characteristics that enhance the storage and supply of water, nutrients, gases, and 
heat to the crop. The interaction between solid components (primarily the insoluble 
compounds of silica, calcium, and aluminum) and the water phase determines 
chemical reactions in soils, i.e. the soil chemistry. Understanding soil chemistry is 
of paramount importance to understanding how soils provide nutrients to plants. 
This is the necessary knowledge basis to predict the response of crops to fertiliza￾tion. Soil chemistry may have a direct impact on soil physical conditions as in the 
case of sodic soils with high exchangeable sodium content promoting dispersion of 
particles of colloidal size. The complex fauna and microbial web hosted in soils are 
involved in many different biological processes, which also affect its physical and 
chemical properties, and ultimately the productivity of agricultural ecosystems.
For a given soil, its properties depend on the history of the soil formation 
(Fig. 2.1) and can be substantially modifed by human intervention, e.g. through 
agricultural practices. A proper understanding of soil properties and adequate inter￾pretation of the magnitudes of these properties is required for proper management 
of agricultural soils with a view of maintaining or improving the benefts that they 
can provide to society, between them the production of food and goods.
2.2 Dynamics of Soil Formation and Soil Loss
Soil genesis refers to the developmental processes that take place for a long time 
over solid or unconsolidated material, the so-called parent material, as the result of 
the complex physical, chemical, and biological interactions, as described in Fig. 2.2.

Fig. 2.2 Description of key processes in soil formation
Soil genesis involves processes of different nature, normally driven by the inte￾grated effect of climate and living matter on the parent material. These processes 
include the accumulation of soil components (e.g., organic matter), formation on 
site of new ones (e.g., clay minerals or oxides), transport within the soil profle (e.g., 
clay, carbonate, or soluble salts), or changes in the aggregation state of soil particles 
(e.g., formation of a structure). This usually leads to the arrangement of soil mate￾rial in different layers with different properties and will defne the morphology of 
soils and their potential for providing benefts for society, in particular agricultural 
productivity.
The available soil depth for plant growth, i.e. the depth of the soil profle that can 
be explored by plant roots also termed rootable soil depth, is a determining factor in 
agronomy. It strongly affects overall crop development and soil productivity and is 
the result of the balance between soil formation and soil destruction rates as a con￾sequence of erosion. Soil formation rates are extremely low. It is usually less than 
5 mm per century, frequently ranging from 0.01 to 40 mm per century. In landscapes 
that are not under quick geological transformations, e.g. alpine uplifting, these soil 
formation rates tend to be in equilibrium with the erosion rates under natural vegeta￾tion. Natural erosion rates range between 0.005 and 60 mm per century and are 
mostly the result of water and wind erosion and mass movement by gravita￾tional forces.
2 The Soil: Physical, Chemical, and Biological Properties18
2.3 Soil Physical Properties: Texture and Structure
Soil physical properties determine many key soil processes mainly related to heat, 
gas, or water retention or fows (Fig. 2.3). Consequently, these properties are crucial 
for defning the agricultural productivity of a soil. Soil texture refers to the size dis￾tribution of the mineral soil particles composing the solid fraction of the soil (from 
clay <2 μm to coarse particles >2000 μm). It is perhaps the most important physical 
property since it determines many other physical properties (such as infltration 
rate) and some chemical properties since particle size is inversely related to the 
chemically reactive surface of soils. Clay content and mineralogy greatly infuence 
the physical and chemical properties of soils, one of them the swelling–shrinking 
behavior of the soil, e.g. vertisols, if the clay is an expansive type. Soil structure
describes the arrangement of soil particles and organic matter in the soil, and par￾ticularly the arrangement of pores among these particles, as well as the stability of 
this arrangement under external forces such as traffc, rainfall drops, or runoff. In 
contrast to texture, soil structure can be substantially modifed by soil management. 
The distribution of pore space and texture determines soil water retention properties 
(see Chap. 8) which are characterized by the relationship between soil water content 
and soil water potential (tension). This relation is determined by soil structure and 
pore size distribution when the soil is at low water tension (wet) and mostly by soil 
texture at high water tension (dry soil). Bulk density is the ratio between soil dry 
mass and volume that is determined by particle size and aggregation. It decreases 
with increased porosity. Thus, bulk density is a very important soil property infu￾encing soil water retention, aeration, traffcability, and infltration rate and is 
extremely sensitive to soil management. Soil porosity is the fraction of soil occupied 
by air and water. Soil mechanical resistance refects the resistance to penetration. 
It is proportional to soil compaction and affected by water content, increasing 
sharply as the soil dries.

Soil permeability is a broad term used to defne the ability of the soil to transmit 
water. It is important to understand the water dynamics and the water balance of the 
soil (Chap. 8) and it must be known for accurate management of irrigation (Chaps. 
20 and 21). It is determined partly by texture, with sandy soils having high perme￾ability as compared to clay soils and it can be altered by soil management (e.g., 
tillage, Chap. 17). Other parameters that refect the water transmission properties of 
the soil are the infltration rate, i.e. the rate of water fow through the soil surface, 
and the hydraulic conductivity, i.e. the ability of soil to conduct water, which 
decreases with increased soil water content.
Soil particles and the void spaces with their continuity and sizes are all arranged 
in clusters giving way to a certain structure. Soil physical, chemical, and biological 
properties all infuence soil structure by providing means that help hold together soil 
particles and aggregates. Structure affects many soil properties that are relevant in 
agronomy. The penetration of plant roots, the movement and storage of soil water, 
the aeration and the mechanical resistance of soil are some of the more relevant 
properties infuenced by the way soil aggregates are clustered together creating a 
given structure. Common management practices such as tillage can change soil 
structure very rapidly with short-term benefcial effects, e.g., increased aeration, but 
also might have negative side effects, e.g. loss of aggregate stability. Such short-term 
changes are reversible but the long-term degradation of soil structure is a serious 
problem as it is associated with decreased water infltration and increased erosion 
risks. Organic matter plays an important role in facilitating aggregate formation and 
its long-term decline contributes to the loss of stability of soil aggregates.
2.4 Soil Chemical Properties
2.4.1 pH
Soil pH is that of a solution in equilibrium with soil. The soil pH is determined in 
the laboratory as the pH of soil suspensions in water or salt solutions (usually 0.1 M 
CaCl2 or 1 M KCl). The degree of acidity or alkalinity of soil is very relevant affect￾ing many other physicochemical and biological properties. Soil pH is related to the 
proportion of acidic or basic elements retained by soils. In nature, acidic soils are 
related to humid climates promoting a high degree of weathering and leaching, 
leading to base loss from exchange sites and replacement by H+ and Al3+. This pro￾cess is faster in soil parent materials with low base content such as granites. Basic 
or alkaline soils are the consequence of the buffering of soil pH by base elements or 
by the presence of buffering compounds such as carbonates. Calcareous soils are 
those with an appreciable concentration of CaCO3 that buffers soil pH near 8.5; the 
presence of other carbonates (Mg or Na in sodic soils) can buffer soil pH well above 
8.5. The pH of a calcareous soil cannot be changed due to its high buffering capacity 
and its limitations for agricultural use, mainly related to restrictions in nutrient 
uptake and plant nutrition, may be overcome with special fertilizer products and 
fertilization strategies.
2 The Soil: Physical, Chemical, and Biological Properties20
Some of the soil fertility features affected by soil pH include:
(a) Solubility and availability to plants of mineral elements in the soil. The solubil￾ity of Mo and P compounds is decreased in acidic soils, thus decreasing its 
availability to plants. On the contrary, Al concentration is increased (usually at 
pH <5.5) and thus its toxicity effects; the concentration of Fe and Mn, essential 
nutrients for plants, can be high enough at low pH to cause toxicity. In acidic 
soils, the risk of defciency of base nutrients (Ca, Mg, and K) increases due to 
their low content. At high pH, the solubility of many metals and trace elements 
is decreased, including essential nutrients for plants such as Fe, Mn, Cu, or Zn. 
Defciency of Fe is frequent in basic soils (typically in calcareous ones). In 
cereals, Zn defciency is usually the most relevant nutritional problem when 
grown in calcareous soils.
(b) Biological properties: Extreme pH values decrease microbial activity in soils, 
which affects many soil processes (for instance, soil organic matter decomposi￾tion, nitrifcation, and biological N2 fxation under acidic conditions, see Chaps. 
26 and 30).
(c) Physical properties: Low Ca concentration in acidic soils is usually related to 
increased dispersion of colloids if Al is not present in high concentration. Thus, 
acidic soils can have poor soil physical properties, including poor structural 
stability or low permeability.
2.4.2 Redox Status
The redox status of a soil is determined by the availability of electrons that can par￾ticipate in redox reactions (pE, – logarithm of the activity of electrons) and it is 
controlled by physical conditions (water content and porosity) and biological activ￾ity. It affects the solubility and speciation of elements with different redox states, 
such as N, S, Fe, Mn, some toxic trace elements (e.g., As, Se), and even C. Reducing 
conditions in agricultural soils usually occur at very high water content (saturation) 
since, under these conditions, oxygen is quickly consumed by biological activity. 
Redox potential becomes more negative with increased saturation time. Reducing 
conditions increase the loss of N to the atmosphere (NOx, N2O, N2) by denitrifca￾tion (Chap. 26), and the solubility of Fe and Mn compounds, enhancing the uptake 
of these nutrients (which can become toxic) and of elements adsorbed on Fe and Mn 
oxides (e.g., P and heavy metals).
2.4.3 Ion Retention in Soils
Ions can be retained in soils by precipitation and adsorption processes. Precipitation
means the formation of a new solid phase, e.g. when P fertilizer is applied to a soil 
with a high Ca concentration, new crystals of Ca phosphates can be formed. 
Adsorption is the accumulation of chemical species (sorbate) on the surfaces of an 
A. Delgado and J. A. Gómez21
existing solid in the soil (sorbent). Precipitated and adsorbed species are in equilib￾rium with the soil solution (precipitation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption 
equilibria).
Adsorption can be the consequence of chemical reactions with functional groups 
of sorbent surface which is sorbate specifc (e.g., P on hydroxylated surfaces), or 
electrostatic attraction by sorbent surface which is not sorbate specifc. Charges 
associated with mineral and organic surfaces can be permanent and variable. The 
permanent charge arises from isomorphic substitution within a mineral. Variable 
charge is the result of unsatisfed bonds at the terminal ends of minerals and organic 
matter and is pH dependent.
2.4.3.1 Exchange Capacity
Exchangeable ions are those weakly adsorbed by soil particles that can be displaced 
from sorption sites by other ions in the solution. Exchangeable ions are essential for 
maintaining plant nutrient reserves in the soil.
Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is the total amount of cations that can be 
retained by a soil as a consequence of the negative charge in clay minerals, oxides, 
and organic matter. It is expressed in equivalents or moles of charge per unit of soil 
mass. CEC is usually dominated by Ca, Mg, Na, K, Al, and protons. When CEC is 
determined as the sum of these cations extracted with a highly concentrated non￾buffered saline solution it is defned as the effective cation exchange capacity
(ECEC), usually applied to acidic soils. The term CEC is applied to that determined 
in a highly concentrated saline solution with buffered pH (usually 7). The selectivity 
or relative affnity of a cation by sorbent surfaces is based on the ion’s charge and 
size. The smaller the hydrated radius (cation + water molecules strongly interacting 
by ion–dipole interaction) the greater the affnity (ions with the same valence have 
a larger ionic radius the smaller the unhydrated radius), and the higher the valence 
the greater the exchanger preference. The affnity scale for dominant cations in soils 
can be summarized as:
Al > Ca > Mg > NH K > Na 3 2 2
4
+ + + + + + ≈
Base saturation is defned as the ratio of base exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, and 
Na) to total CEC, which decreases at decreased pH in the soil. It is usually expressed 
as a percentage (Percent base saturation BSP):
BSP C = + ( ) a Mg K+ + Na ⋅100 / CEC
where Ca, Mg, K, and Na are the exchangeable bases. On the other hand, it can be 
defned the Acid saturation such as the ratio of exchangeable acidity (H+ and Al3+) 
to CEC, which can be also expressed on a percentage basis (Percent acid satura￾tion, ASP).
Ca, Mg, and K are plant nutrients, so a high base saturation means a greater 
nutrient reserve for the same CEC. Low base saturation related to soil acidity can 
cause Ca defciency for plants. To guarantee good physical soil properties (soil 
aggregation, structure stability, good aeration and drainage) and crop nutrition, 
2 The Soil: Physical, Chemical, and Biological Properties22
Ca must be the dominant cation in the exchange complex, ideally >50% of CEC. Ca 
is a divalent cation with a small hydrated radius, and this enhances the aggregation 
of colloidal particles. It is also desirable that the Ca/Mg ratio would be 5–10 and the 
K/Mg ratio 0.2–0.3 to avoid nutritional disorders (antagonisms).
2.4.4 Salinity and Sodicity
Salinity refers to the concentration of soluble salts (more soluble than gypsum) in 
soils. A saline soil has a soluble salt concentration high enough to impair the growth 
of cultivated plants. Soil salinity is quantifed as the electrical conductivity (EC) of 
the saturation extract of the soil (ECe). Soils are defned as saline when their ECe is 
above 4 dS/m. There is ample variation among species in the responses to salinity 
(Chap. 24). Highly sensitive crops (e.g., carrot, bean, strawberry) are affected by 
ECe slightly above 1 dS/m. On the opposite side, tolerant crops such as barley and 
sugar beet can tolerate ECe above 4 dS/m. The impact of salinity on plant growth is 
caused by osmotic effects (decreased water potential in soil) and from specifc tox￾icity, typically due to high Cl or Na content in saline soils.
Sodicity refers to a high exchangeable Na concentration in soils. Since Na salts 
are common in saline soils, both problems are usually related. Na is a monovalent 
cation with a big hydrated radius. Hence, high contents of Na adsorbed on soil col￾loids promote their dispersion, thus degrading soil physical properties. A soil is 
classifed as sodic if exchangeable Na accounts for more than 15% of the CEC 
(Exchangeable Na percentage—ESP— >15). However, crops sensitive to Na toxic￾ity are affected at ESP >7 (e.g., peach, citrus, strawberry). In crops tolerant to Na 
toxicity (e.g., cotton or rye) problems are usually caused by the physical degrada￾tion of soil. Soils with EC  >4  dS/m and ESP  >15 are classifed as saline-sodic. 
Problems derived from sodic soils can also be related to their very high pH 
(usually >8.5 if the soil is not saline).
Chapter 24 expands on the salinity problem in agriculture and describes the 
approaches for its management and control.
2.5 Soil Biological Properties
Soils host a complex web of organisms (Fig. 2.4) which can infuence soil evolution 
and specifc soil physical and chemical properties. For instance, earthworm activity 
increases infltration rate or microbial activity decreases soil organic matter due to 
mineralization.
Soil biological properties are also interconnected with other soil physical and 
chemical properties; e.g. aeration, soil organic matter, or pH affect the activity of 
many microorganisms in soils which in turn perform relevant activities in carbon 
and nutrient cycling. Examples of this interconnection are given in Sect. 2.4. Thus, 
changes in soil properties due to management can signifcantly affect biological

properties in soils, some of them being extremely sensitive to soil management; e.g. 
soil microbial activity can be greatly increased by improved drainage, liming, or 
organic amendments.
Soil organic matter is a key factor affecting biological activity in soils. It is the 
carbon source for many organisms, including soil microbiota. Not only the amount 
but also the type of organic compounds in the soil determines its biological activity; 
e.g., microbial activity is greatly increased by incorporating fresh organic residues 
(such as green manure or crop residues), which can be readily mineralized by 
microbes. On the other hand, stable forms of organic matter (humic and fulvic com￾pounds), which constitute most of the organic matter of soils in temperate regions, 
are not easily mineralized by soil microbiota, which explains the long half-life of 
these compounds in soils (usually  > centuries). Therefore, stable organic com￾pounds do not contribute signifcantly to soil microbial activity but constitute a 
stabilized stored soil C pool which is very relevant to the C global cycle, partially 
buffering the consequences of increasing C emissions to the atmosphere.
The rhizosphere is the volume of soil altered by the root system and is the part 
of the soil profle where the concentration of suitable C sources for many microor￾ganisms is greatest. Organic compounds exuded by plant roots (including organic 
anions of low molecular weight) alter soil chemical properties and greatly increase 
the biological activity in comparison to the bulk soil. The rhizosphere is a space of 
intense interaction of plant roots with soil microorganisms. Rhizospheric microor￾ganisms can signifcantly affect plant development through the production of growth 
regulators, by decreasing the incidence of plant diseases, and by increasing nutrient 
availability to plants.
Understanding soil biological properties is important for soil management but 
also for the prevention and control of crop pests and diseases. Many of the proper￾ties indicated in Table 2.1 are a description of the diversity and activity of parts of 
the soil food web, or of closely related properties such as soil respiration rate or 
organic matter content.

2.6 Nutrient Cycles and Balances in the Soil
Nutrients in soils are present in different chemical forms that can remain in solution 
or bound to soil particles. The exchange of nutrients between different forms or 
“soil pools” is governed by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological 
processes that form the soil nutrient cycle. Since the soil is not a closed system, 
gains or losses of nutrients from the soils occur to/from the atmosphere or water 
courses (leaching or erosion), which links the soil nutrient cycle with the global 
nutrient cycle in the Earth’s crust. The soil and global nutrient cycles are affected by 
human activities. In agricultural soils, fertilization alters the cycle, introducing 
nutrients into the system. Without this supply, the natural input of nutrients in soils 
would be much lower than typical crop extractions, thus inducing a progressive 
depletion of nutrients, i.e. a loss of soil fertility and a decrease in yields.
A general nutrient cycle is represented in Fig. 2.5. The fux of nutrients to plant 
roots comes from the soil solution, mainly as dissolved ions. The labile nutrient 
pool is the one readily equilibrated with the solution, as adsorbed ions described in 
Sect. 2.4.3.1, those precipitated as soluble salts or those present in organic com￾pounds that are readily mineralized. The available pool of nutrients is the amount in 
solution plus that readily equilibrated with the solution (labile forms); for a given 
nutrient, it is the amount that can be extracted by successive crops until severe def￾ciency. Chemical (e.g., adsorption/desorption or precipitation/solubilization) and 
biological (immobilization/mineralization) interactions affect nutrient equilibria 
and exchange rates between the labile fraction of the soil solid and solution phases. 
This exchange ultimately determines the solution ionic activities and the transport 
of nutrients to plant roots.
Accurate estimation of fertilizer requirements in modern agriculture is based on 
the knowledge of nutrient cycles and the precise estimation of available nutrient 
pools in soils through chemical methods. Mobile nutrients are those not bound to 
soil particles. Nitrogen, despite ammonium being adsorbed, is readily transformed 
A. Delgado and J. A. Gómez25
Fig. 2.5 General nutrient cycle in the soil. In italics physical, chemical, or biological processes. 
Residue incorporation involves nutrient recycling: not only in soluble forms (e.g., K), but most in 
organic forms or organic bound forms that can become part of the labile or non-labile pool. 
Exchange between labile and non-labile forms implies the same processes that those involved in 
the equilibria between labile forms and solution
to nitrate, which is not adsorbed to soil particles. In agricultural systems, where the 
contribution to the available nutrient pool by organic matter mineralization is usu￾ally low, the major contributors to the available pool of mobile nutrients are inor￾ganic ions in the soil solution. Immobile nutrients are those that are bound to soil 
particles through adsorption or precipitation processes, while the labile pool is the 
major contributor to the available pool. Immobile nutrients, such as P, K, Ca, or Mg, 
are less susceptible to leaching; on the other hand, the nature of chemical reactions 
involved in their retention limits the availability of the nutrients supplied as fertilizer.
2.7 Soil Quality
Ecosystem services are the benefts for humans obtained from ecosystems and are 
the basis for human well-being (Fig.  2.6). Many essential ecosystem services 
depend on soils. These services are known as “soil functions.” The soil functions 
related to agricultural systems involve (1) primary productivity, (2) water purifca￾tion and regulation, (3) carbon sequestration and other aspects of climate regulation, 
(4) provision of a habitat for functional and intrinsic biodiversity, and (5) nutrient 
cycling and provision. Traditionally, in agricultural systems, the focus has been put 
on primary productivity. However, the other functions of soil in agricultural systems 
are also relevant for society. The concept of soil quality addresses this multi￾functionality of soil, and it has been traditionally defned as the capability of soil to

Ecosystem Assessment, 2005)
perform its functions within the ecosystem boundaries. Soil quality should be inter￾preted according to how relevant are those functions for society. This quality is 
related to soil properties and processes. As an example, texture and structure 
(properties) determine water infltration (process) which may affect different soil 
functions such as primary productivity or water purifcation and regulation. 
Not only natural processes involved in soil formation but also agricultural practices 
can affect soil properties and consequently modify soil quality.
The main threats to soil quality, which constraints the performance of ecosystem 
services derived from soils, are:
2.7.1 Soil Erosion
Erosion is the loss of land surface by water, wind, ice, gravity, or other natural or 
human agents that abrade, detach, and remove soil particles. Human interventions 
mainly by removing the protective plant cover can result in accelerated erosion rates 
under inappropriate land use or soil management practices. These accelerated ero￾sion rates can reach up to 50 mm per year, resulting in a reduction of the soil profle 
depth and its degradation. Achieving sustainable erosion rates is a major goal of 
the so-called soil conservation practices. Sustainable erosion rates are defned as 
those that are either close to the soil formation rates or at least below a given safe 
rate (customarily below 10–100 mm per century) that extends far into the future the 
A. Delgado and J. A. Gómez27
impact of the imbalance between soil formation and soil erosion rates. The use of 
soil conservation techniques aims at reducing erosion rates within the range of 
0.003 to 60 mm per century to achieve a more sustainable agriculture.
2.7.2 Degradation of Soil Physical Properties
The degradation of soil physical properties is mainly related to the loss of aggregate 
stability or dispersion of soil particles. This leads to the loss of porosity and subse￾quent increased bulk density, compaction, and soil crust formation. In the soil sur￾face, soil crusting and sealing after wetting or impact of rainfall/irrigation drops 
leads to reduced water infltration, thus increasing runoff and soil erosion. In addi￾tion, soil crusting may hinder seedling emergence, leading to yield loss. Soil com￾paction implies a decreased porosity and increased bulk density, leading to lower 
infltration, less aeration, and reduced root growth. Intensive tillage, in particular 
with moldboard plows or disk harrows, the traffc of heavy machinery such as 
harvesters and poaching cause soil compaction. A specifc case of compaction is the 
plow pan provoked by particular tillage devices (e.g., disk harrows, rotatory 
harrows) or intensive tillage. The degradation of soil properties may be related to 
changes in chemical properties. In this regard, acidifcation and sodifcation (see 
Sect. 2.7.3) may cause colloidal particle dispersion, reducing infltration and aera￾tion. The loss of organic matter may reduce aggregate stability.
2.7.3 Degradation of Soil Chemical Properties
Although the soil forming process involves changes in chemical properties, human 
intervention may have a direct impact on these properties, thus affecting soil quality. 
The main threats to soil chemical properties are:
Acidifcation is the increase in hydrogen ions in the soil. When components such 
as carbonate cannot buffer soil pH, there is a trend toward acidifcation in the long 
term because rain is usually slightly acidic due to the dissolution of CO2 and the 
dissociation of the resulting H2CO3. Also, CO2 resulting from microorganisms and 
root respiration leads to an increased H2CO3 concentration in the soil solution con￾tributing to natural acidifcation. Besides this natural trend, agricultural manage￾ment increases acidifcation risks. Plants’ roots release H+ when cation uptake is 
higher than that of anions to balance the charge. This is particularly relevant in 
legumes since the fxation of atmospheric N2 results in the formation of NH4
+ within 
the root nodules and the uptake of an excess of cations. This increased positive 
charge needs to be balanced by a net release of protons. The use of urea and ammo￾nium N-fertilizers is considered the most important cause of acidifcation in agricul￾tural soils since the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate implies the release of 
hydrogen ions (2 moles of H+ per mol of NH4
+). However, if nitrate is absorbed by 
a crop, there is no net acidifcation since its absorption is coupled with that of hydro￾gen ions. Acidifcation occurs when nitrate formed from ammonium fertilizer is 
2 The Soil: Physical, Chemical, and Biological Properties28
leached since there is no consumption of hydrogen ions involved in the absorption 
of this nitrate and also occurs by the leaching of cations (mainly bases) to maintain 
electrical balance. Finally, the emission of nitrogen and sulfur compounds from 
industrial processes is the origin of the deposition of nitric and sulfuric acids in 
soils contributing to its acidifcation. As mentioned above, acidic soils may suffer 
structure degradation, decreased microbial activity and may promote defciency or 
toxicity problems in plants.
Salinization is the accumulation of soluble salts in soils. It may occur by natural 
causes such as saline parent material, hydrologic conditions, or capillary rising of 
saline underground water. However, irrigation is the main cause for salinization 
when soluble salts supplied with irrigation water are higher than those lost by leach￾ing. This risk is increased with the use of poor-quality irrigation water. The manage￾ment of irrigation involves leaching to decrease or maintain the soluble salt content 
in the soil (Chap. 24). It is important to anticipate what will happen to the soil if the 
irrigation is abandoned in the future, since all the salts will remain in the soil and it 
will condition the future land use.
Sodifcation is the increase in exchangeable Na in soil. It is frequently related to 
salinity since Na salts are one of the most frequent in saline environments. However, 
sometimes if soluble salts disappear from soils a high content of exchangeable Na 
remains. Irrigation water can also be a source of Na. In sodic soils (non-saline) there 
is a dispersion of colloids degrading physical properties, possible Na toxicity and 
reduced nutrient availability due to high pH. The control of sodicity is discussed in 
Chap. 30.
Exhaustion is the progressive depletion of nutrients and soil organic matter 
(SOM). The decrease in SOM has implications for other chemical, biological, and 
physical properties. Organic matter exhaustion is the consequence of scarce organic 
residue incorporation that does not compensate the losses by mineralization and 
erosion. This SOM loss contributes to the physical deterioration of soil since it is an 
aggregating agent; also, chemical properties are negatively affected since organic 
matter has a charge (pH dependent) that contributes to nutrient retention. Organic 
matter also contributes to the soil pH buffering capacity and it is a nutrient reserve 
made available by mineralization. SOM decay also reduces the activity of soil 
microbes as it is an essential energy source for them. C/N ratios range from around 
80 in some fresh residues such as cereal straw to around 10 in humic substances. 
Values below 10 indicate that the major contributor to SOM is microbial biomass 
(C/N around 8) and reveal the urgent need of organic amendments to the soil.
Contamination is the accumulation of pollutants in soil coming from fertilizers, 
pesticides, or the application of other products such as compost, or sewage sludge 
that may contain trace elements or organic pollutants. Atmospheric deposition of 
pollutants coming from industrial or large urban areas may also pollute the soil. 
Fertilizers obtained from mines, such as P, may contain trace elements (typically 
Cd) depending on the origin of the phosphate rock, which may accumulate in ani￾mals or humans. New threats associated with the recycling of different residues in 
agriculture are gaining attention, such as microplastics. From a microbiological 
point of view, the presence of genes of resistance to antibiotics threatens animal and 
human health.

2.7.4 Soil Quality Indicators
Soil physical and chemical properties can be used in the assessment of soil quality. 
Some examples are shown in Table 2.2. However, most threats to soil quality nega￾tively affect soil microorganisms, promoting changes in the structure of the com￾munities, in the biomass and their activity. As some examples, reduced soil porosity 
and water infltration negatively affect aerobic microorganisms and typically 
decrease organic matter mineralization rates. Extreme pH values (acidic or sodic 
soils) imply a decreased microbial activity negatively affecting essential processes 
such as nitrifcation. Organic matter exhaustion favors oligotrophic organisms over 
eutrophic, with an overall decreased diversity and activity. That is why some soil 
biological properties can be used as indirect indicators of appropriate soil manage￾ment and good soil quality, like soil respiration rate or some enzymatic activities 
that can be derived from living organisms in the soil.

3 The Radiation Balance
Francisco J. Villalobos , José Paulo De Melo-Abreu, 
Luciano Mateos, and Elias Fereres
Abstract
Solar radiation (short wave) is the energy source for photosynthesis, warming, 
and evaporation in agricultural systems. Its value can be calculated as a function 
of latitude, time of year, and cloud cover. Fifty percent of solar radiation is avail￾able to photosynthesis and is called Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), 
although only a very small fraction is actually used in this process. Net radiation 
is obtained by discounting the refected solar radiation (which depends on the 
albedo) and longwave losses that depend on air temperature, humidity, and cloud 
cover. Plants intercept all types of the radiation fuxes. Radiation interception is

3.1 Introduction
Electromagnetic radiation is the basic physical phenomenon determining the envi￾ronment of crops. Solar radiation, which is shortwave radiation, constitutes the pri￾mary energy source for crop production. In addition, we have to consider the 
longwave thermal radiation emitted by any object on the planet, including soil, 
crops, water, and the atmosphere. Moreover, light quality, i.e., its composition in 
different wavelengths, plays a key role in many developmental processes of plants, 
as discussed in Chap. 11.
The total energy emitted for the whole electromagnetic spectrum is calculated by 
the Stefan–Boltzmann Law:
E T = ε σ 4 (3.1)
where ε is the emissivity (or effectiveness of the body in the emission of radiation), 
σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67 10−8
 W/m2
/K4
), and T is the absolute tem￾perature of the surface of the emitting body. This law applies to any object, includ￾ing the surface of the sun or the earth. The emissivity of plant surfaces is between 
0.97 and 0.99, thus very close to that of the “black body,” which by defnition is 1.
3.2 Solar Radiation
The fux density of solar radiation in the limit of the atmosphere (extraterrestrial 
radiation), on a surface perpendicular to the beam, when the sun and the earth are at 
an average distance apart, is called the “solar constant” and its value varies between 
1350 and 1400 W/m2
, with an average value of 1361 W/m2
.
Considering a horizontal surface, if the ray and the normal to the surface are not 
parallel, fux density can be calculated by Lambert’s cosine law:
I I = p cosθ (3.2)
where θ is the zenith angle (angle between the radiant beam and the vertical) and Ip
is the fux density in the direction of the beam.
The zenith angle for a horizontal surface on the planet depends on the latitude 
(λs), the solar declination (δs), and the time of day (expressed as hour angle, ha, that 
varies from 0 to 360°, taking the value of 0° at solar noon):
cos s θ λ = + in sin c δ λ os cos c δ os s s s s a h (3.3)
The solar declination ranges from +23.45° at summer solstice (Northern hemi￾sphere) to −23.45° at winter solstice and may be calculated (in degrees) as:

where DOY is day of the year (DOY  =  1 for January 1 and 365 or 366 for 
December 31).
F. J. Villalobos et al.33
Legal time is obtained by adding or subtracting a certain number of hours to 
standard time, plus a daylight savings time (usually one hour) in summer. For 
instance, in most Western Europe (France, Germany, and Spain) there is a one-hour 
difference in the fall-winter period and two hours in spring and summer (daylight 
savings). To calculate actual solar time, we must take into account the longitude of 
the place as the path of the sun to the west has an apparent speed of 15° per hour. 
However, we will ignore other phenomena related to the rotation of the Earth that 
can change up to 16 min from our predictions of solar time.
In crop ecology and agronomy, we are especially interested in three major bands 
in the spectrum of solar radiation reaching the upper atmosphere. The infrared and 
visible wavebands represent approximately 51% and 40% of the solar constant, 
respectively, while the ultraviolet waveband is approximately 9%. The visible wave￾band, which ranges from 400 to 700  nm, is also the Photosynthetically Active 
Radiation (PAR), although a very small fraction of this radiation is used in this 
process. PAR may be expressed as radiation fux density (W m−2
) or as photon fux 
density (mol m−2
 s−1
).
Example 3.1
On February 1 (DOY 32) in Cordoba, Spain (λs = 37.85°), the solar decli￾nation is

and then θ = arc cos(0.35) = 69.5°.
Example 3.2
Santiago de Compostela (Spain) is located at 42.9°N and 8.43°W. We will 
calculate solar time at 1500 h (legal time) on May 1.
As the date corresponds to spring-summer, solar time at the standard 
meridian (in this case, the Greenwich meridian) will be:
15−2 = 13 h
Then we subtract 1 h per 15° longitude to the West:
13−8.43 1/15 = 12.44 h, which means that actual solar time is 12:26.
3 The Radiation Balance34
As the sun’s beams travel through the atmosphere, the radiation is altered in 
quantity, quality, and direction by absorption and scattering. The absorption, which 
is a change from radiant energy to heat, results in the heating of the atmosphere and 
a reduction of the amount of radiant energy that reaches the ground. Absorption is 
mainly due to ozone and oxygen, especially in the ultraviolet waveband, and water 
vapor and carbon dioxide, in the infrared waveband. Some aerosols are also impor￾tant absorbers of shortwave radiation. The scattering occurs when photons hit 
against the molecules composing the air and airborne particles and aerosols, causing 
changes in the direction of radiation, but without removing energy from the radia￾tion. In the visible region of the spectrum, absorption by molecules of the atmo￾sphere is less important than scattering while in the infrared waveband, the opposite 
occurs. Solar radiation on the earth’s surface, normal to the sun’s rays, rarely 
exceeds 75% of the solar constant, due to absorption and scattering.
3.3 Solar Radiation at Ground Level
As a result of atmospheric attenuation, solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface is 
no longer only beam radiation coming directly from the sun (direct solar radiation). 
We have a second component, diffuse solar radiation, i.e., the radiation scattered in 
the atmosphere that reaches the surface, coming from the entire sky hemisphere. 
The sum of direct and diffuse solar radiation, measured on a horizontal fat surface, 
is called global radiation, total radiation, or simply solar radiation. On average, PAR
represents 50% of the global radiation fux, while, in extraterrestrial radiation, it 
represents only about 40%.
In general, the ratio of diffuse over total radiation increases with latitude and 
zenith angle as the path of the rays through the atmosphere increases. This implies 
that both at sunrise and at sunset, the diffuse/total ratio is higher than at noon. 
Cloudiness also increases the ratio up to 1 when the sky is completely overcast (all 
solar radiation is diffuse). However, the absolute maximum of diffuse radiation is 
reached when cloud cover is around 50%.
Global radiation (Rs) is measured with pyranometers. On clear days, during the 
daytime, it follows approximately a sinusoidal curve (Fig. 3.1), and, on a daily time 
step, it can be estimated from extraterrestrial radiation (RA) and the ratio of the 
actual number (ns) and the maximum possible number (Ns) of sunshine hours:

On the other hand, Eq. 3.5 indicates that on clear days solar radiation is around 
75% of extraterrestrial radiation. On the average, solar radiation on overcast days is 
only 25% of extraterrestrial radiation.
Example 3.3
We will calculate day length and solar radiation for clear days on December 
21 at Grand Rapids, Michigan (42.9°N) and South Hobart, Australia (42.9°S).

Fig. 3.2 Annual time course of the mean monthly solar radiation for two locations, Pelotas 
(Brazil) with mean annual rainfall of 1395 mm and Klawer (South Africa) with mean annual rain￾fall of 174 mm
The annual time course of global radiation also follows a sinusoidal pattern, with 
an amplitude that depends on the site’s latitude and cloudiness. For example, Fig. 3.2
shows the annual curves of average and maximum solar radiation at two sites with 
very high and low rainfall. On the other hand, Fig. 3.3 shows the annual curves of 
solar radiation for 3 dry locations differing in latitude. As we move away from the 
Equator the amplitude of the annual radiation curve increases.
Mean annual solar radiation is usually between 15 and 22 MJ m−2
 day−1
 for lati￾tudes from 30°S to 30°N and decreases for higher latitudes (Fig. 3.4).
Once the solar radiation reaches the earth’s surface, part of the radiation is 
refected. We use the term albedo (α) to express the ratio of refected to incident 
radiation in the range of 0.3 to 3 μm. Some values of albedo of different surfaces are 
shown in Table 3.1.
Therefore, the short-wave radiation remaining on the surface of the earth can be 
calculated as (1−α) Rs. The vegetation albedo is usually between 0.15 and 0.20 for 
forests and between 0.20 and 0.25 for feld crops at full ground cover. The main 
factors that determine the soil albedo soil are its color and its surface water content. 
A dry soil gets darker after wetting. For example, the soil of the Agricultural 
Research Center of Cordoba (Spain) (sandy loam, low in organic matter) has an 
albedo of 0.16 when wet and 0.23 when dry.

3.4 Longwave Radiation
All surfaces are emitters of longwave radiation following the law of Stefan–
Boltzmann (Eq. 3.1). Under clear skies, most of the radiation emitted by the earth’s 
surface (i.e., terrestrial radiation) is absorbed by the molecules composing the 
atmosphere, mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide, although nitrous oxide (N2O) 
and methane (CH4) are also important absorbers. Radiation in the waveband 
8–12 μm (i.e., the atmospheric window) is almost not absorbed by these gases due 
to the small size of its molecules. Under cloudy skies, cloud droplets, however, 
when present, contribute extensively to the absorption of the longwave radiation, 
thus “closing” this atmospheric window. The remainder that is not absorbed is lost 
into the extraterrestrial space. The radiation absorbed can be re-emitted to the earth’s 
surface, thus constituting atmospheric radiation. This downward fux originates 
mainly from the frst kilometer of the atmosphere, from the emissions of those con￾stituents mentioned above that are highly selective absorbers (thus highly selective 
emitters) of longwave radiation. For practical purposes, since the average tempera￾ture of the air in the lower atmosphere is related to the air temperature near the 
ground, but much colder, it is possible to apply the Stefan–Boltzmann law with a 
ftted apparent emissivity. This parameter depends on the difference in temperature 
of the lower atmosphere and the ground, the amount of cloud cover, and the actual 
emissivity of the lower atmosphere. Terrestrial radiation is higher than atmospheric 
radiation and that results in net losses of longwave radiation.
Daily losses of longwave radiation (Rb, MJ m−2

, ea is the 
air vapor pressure (kPa), T is the air temperature (K), and ns/Ns is the ratio of actual 
sunshine duration (ns) and day length (Ns).
Equation 3.11 indicates that longwave losses will be greater under clear skies 
(high ns/Ns), with lower humidity and higher air temperature. Cloud cover has a 
dramatic impact on losses of longwave radiation, as for given air temperature and 
humidity, longwave losses under an overcast sky are only 10% of those when the

3.5 Net Radiation
The net balance of radiation that remains on a surface of albedo α is expressed by:
R R n s = − ( ) − Rb 1 α (3.13)
Net radiation is thus the difference between the fux of radiation toward the sur￾face and from the surface of the Earth. It is therefore the energy available on the 
surface for evaporation, heating of the air, the soil, and the crop and to a lesser 
extent, for photosynthesis.
Figure 3.1 represents the daily time course of solar radiation, net radiation, and 
refected solar radiation on a summer day on a cotton feld in Cordoba, Spain. 
Curves of Rs and Rn have similar shapes but while the solar radiation fux is always 
positive during the day and nil during the night, the net radiation is negative at night.
The daily values of net radiation in summer are usually positive and decrease 
as the nights get longer in the fall. At higher latitudes, daily net radiation reaches 
negative values during winter. For example, in Cordoba (Spain), solar and net 
radiation are highest in July although extraterrestrial radiation peaks in June. This is 
explained by the higher average cloudiness and air humidity of June as compared 
to July.
Example 3.4
Let us calculate the net radiation over short grass (α = 0.23) in South Hobart 
(42.9°S) for a clear day on December 21 if the average air temperature is 
25 °C and the air vapor pressure is 1.8 kPa. Solar radiation was already calcu￾lated in Example 3.3.

3.6 Intercepted Radiation
Leaf area is a good indicator of the ability of the crop to intercept radiation. To 
characterize the leaf area of a crop canopy, we use the leaf area index (LAI), defned 
as the ratio of total green leaf surface area (one side) and the ground surface.
According to Monsi and Saeki (1953, as cited in Rosenberg et al. 1983), radia￾tion transmitted through the canopy is an exponential function of LAI:
I I e k LAI = −
0 (3.14)
where I0 and I are the fux densities above and below the canopy, respectively, and k
is the extinction coeffcient.
Intercepted radiation will be the difference between incoming radiation and that 
reaching the soil surface. Therefore:
I I I e k LAI
0 0 − = ( ) 1− − (3.15)
The above equations may be applied to any type of radiation in terms of wave￾length (e.g., PAR or Near Infrared, NIR), directional properties (direct or diffuse), 
or time scale (instantaneous or daily) by taking the appropriate extinction coeffcient.
The extinction coeffcient depends on the angle of elevation of the sun and the 
leaf angle distribution. The most useful approach is given by the ellipsoidal leaf 
angle distribution of Campbell (1986) that uses a single parameter of leaf inclina￾tion (X). For daily time step computations, the extinction coeffcient is a parameter 
that may be fxed for the whole growing season or for specifc phenological phases. 
Example values of k and X are given in Table 3.2.

Fig. 3.5 Extinction coeffcients for daily solar radiation using the ellipsoidal model of Campbell
The extinction coeffcient may be related to the inclination angle of the leaves as 
shown in Fig. 3.5. Vertical leaves (X = 0) have extinction coeffcients around 0.4 
while horizontal leaves (X→ ∞) approach 1.
The leaf angle distribution has agronomic and ecological implications. Small 
plants with horizontal leaf distributions (i.e., higher k values) intercept more radia￾tion than those with erect leaves. The drawback is that when LAI is high, the light 
distribution is very unequal, the lower leaves receive too little light, which usually 
accelerates their senescence. On the contrary, more vertical leaf angle distributions 
(i.e., lower k values) may be advantageous to intercept radiation when the zenith 
angle is large (winter or high latitudes) and leads to a more homogeneous distribu￾tion of radiation within the canopy when LAI is high. Therefore, the maximum LAI 
that may be sustained will be higher for low extinction coeffcient values. Ideally, 
for optimal radiation interception, the upper leaves should be more erect and the 
lower ones more horizontal. Modern maize canopies have such leaf angle 
distribution.
Leaf-level photosynthesis saturates with high irradiance (Chap. 13) but irradi￾ance decreases as we move down into the canopy, so that a large fraction of the 
leaves will be below the irradiance saturation level. This results in crop carbon 
assimilation increasing linearly with irradiance at the canopy level, as will be shown 
in Chap. 13.
F. J. Villalobos et al.43
When leaf area cannot be determined, the degree of intercepted radiation may be 
estimated by calculating the fraction of the ground area covered by the crop canopy 
(horizontal projection). This can be easily assessed in the feld using photography 
and the appropriate software and is expressed as a percentage of full cover (100%). 
The ground cover is a useful parameter for characterizing canopy size from remote 
sensing.
3.7 Radiation Interception of Trees
We consider the tree crown as a spheroid with constant Leaf Area Density (μl, m2
m−3
), horizontal radius r, and height ht.
For any isolated tree, radiation interception for rays with zenith angle θ is the 
product of incoming radiation fux in the direction of the beam (Ip), Projected 
Envelope Area in the θ direction (PEA(θ)), and the mean interception over PEA:
I I PEA t i p = ( ) − c ( )  
 θ θ 1 (3.16)
where tc(θ) is the mean transmissivity of the crown in the direction of the sun rays.

Daily radiation interception of isolated trees may be calculated using intercep￾tion for zenith angle 1 rad (PEA1). For spheroids and semi-spheroids, of height h
and horizontal radius r, the intercepted radiation equivalent area (REA, units m2
), 
i.e., the ratio of radiation intercepted by the tree (MJ) and incoming radiation on a 
horizontal surface (MJ/m2
), may be calculated as:

As in herbaceous crops, the degree of radiation interception by a tree may be 
estimated by determining the ground cover as the horizontal projection on the 
ground of the tree shade at solar noon divided by the tree spacing. Given the wide 
diversity of tree architecture, this is only a frst approximation of the intercepted 
radiation as calculated above. For a given ground cover, the fraction of intercepted 
radiation will increase with crown height.
3.8 Radiation Interception of Hedgerows
We used a model of radiation interception of tree hedgerows to develop a summary 
model as follows:

Q Q a b t d = −  ( ) s s −  
 cos λ δ (3.28)
Example 3.5
We have an olive orchard in Cordoba, Spain. Plant spacing is 7 × 3.5 m. The 
trees have horizontal radius 0.5  m, height 1.5  m, and Leaf Area Density 
2 m2
 m−3
. Let us calculate radiation interception on 21 March, under clear sky 
conditions. For that day and location: RA = 29.8 MJ m−2
 day−1
 and Ns = 12 h.
Using Eqs. 3.24, 3.25, and 3.22:
Assuming a spheroid:
PEA1 = 1.06 m2
 and c1 = 0.49, so REA = 0.69 m2
 and intercepted PAR is 
7 MJ day−1
.
Assuming a semi-spheroid:
PEA1 = 1.2 3 m2 and c1 = 0.44, so REA = 0.71 m2 and intercepted PAR 
is 7.2 MJ day−1.
If we want to express radiation interception at the orchard level to get the 
fraction of intercepted radiation, we divide the value of REA by the area per 
tree (7 × 3.5 = 24.5 m2):
fPI = 0.69/24.5 = 0.03
The same orchard would have REA = 0.79 m2 on January 1 and 0.65 m2 
on June 21. This illustrates the fact that isolated trees will intercept a higher 
fraction of radiation in winter than in summer.

4 Wind and Turbulent Transport
Francisco J. Villalobos , Elias Fereres, Luca Testi, 
and José Paulo De Melo-Abreu
Abstract
The wind fow over crop canopies causes a momentum transfer from the air to 
the canopy. That transfer generates turbulence, which enhances the exchange of 
matter and energy between the atmosphere and crops. Turbulence increases with 
wind velocity and aerodynamic roughness, proportional to crop height. Wind 
speed (U) varies logarithmically with height. This profle can be described math￾ematically by two parameters related to crop height. Turbulence can also be 
expressed as an inverse function of aerodynamic resistance, which refects the 
diffculty of turbulent transport and is therefore very high when U is low and for 
smooth (short) crops. Inside the canopy layer, the wind speed acquires profles 
more dependent on the architecture of the canopy than on the wind vector over 
it. Wind speed changes considerably over space and time, generally lower at 
night and attaining a maximum in the afternoon; over the long term, higher aver￾age wind speeds are often registered at higher latitudes.

4.1 Transport of Mass and Energy from Crops
The partition of net radiation over a crop surface takes place in several forms. Part 
is spent in convection, thereby increasing the air temperature within the crop and the 
atmosphere above (sensible heat). The rest is used in conduction leading to an 
increase in the soil (and the crop) temperature, or as latent heat associated with 
evaporation. A small fraction of the energy is also used for the reduction of CO2
(photosynthesis).
The transfer of mass (e.g., water vapor) or energy (e.g., sensible heat) is expressed 
by analogy of Ohm’s Law as (Cs – Ca)/R, where Cs and Ca are the concentrations 
of material or energy levels at the surface and in the atmosphere, respectively, and R
is the resistance to the exchange. This resistance may refer to different processes 
(e.g., conduction, convection, etc.). In the case of heat transport by convection, 
which is very similar to the transfer of chemicals between the crop and the atmo￾sphere, fuxes are enhanced by turbulence, which in turn depends on wind speed.
4.2 Wind and Exchange of Matter, Energy, and Momentum
Crops are subject to the mechanical action of wind, which moves and bends their 
leaves, stems, and branches. But wind has another essential effect on crops, as it 
enhances the turbulent transport of water vapor, CO2, and heat. This fux is charac￾terized by turbulent air currents or eddies of many different sizes and variable direc￾tions and is very effective as a transport mechanism. If the heat and the gases were 
transported just by diffusion, the surface conditions on earth would not be suitable 
for plant life due to the high temperatures that would be reached and the limitation 
on the downward fux of CO2 required for photosynthesis.
Wind speed profles are determined by the transport of eddies in the surface 
boundary layer, i.e. the layer of atmosphere closer to the crops and the soil. If air 
fows parallel to a fat surface, the profle of wind speed is logarithmic (exponential 
increase with height) and velocity tends to zero as we approach the surface. This 
profle is due to a frictional force between the surface and the air, transmitted to the 
upper air layers through the intermediate layers. The friction force per unit area is 
called the shear stress (τs) and is proportional to the gradient of wind speed:
τ µ s a
dU
dz = (4.1)
where μa is the dynamic viscosity of the air, U is the wind speed, and z is the height. 
The dimensions of τs are the same as those of momentum per unit area and unit time 
(momentum fux). This variable allows an analogy between heat (or mass) transport 
and vertical momentum transfer. The magnitude of the momentum fux is indicative 
of the amount and size of eddies that are formed.
F. J. Villalobos et al.49
The transfer of momentum and other entities between uniform, extensive hori￾zontal surfaces is similar, but differs in the effectiveness of the exchange and its 
formulation.
4.3 Profiles of Wind Speed Above Crop Canopies
Flat surfaces are very rare in nature, especially on land. When obstacles such as 
stones or crop canopies are present, the wind profle is affected. The obstacles hin￾der air movement in comparison to an ideal fat surface. First, the wind velocity is 
not zero at the surface as shown in Fig. 4.1; extrapolated zero wind velocity lies 
somewhere between the surface of the ground and the plane at the height of the 
obstacles. This level is called the zero plane displacement (dz). It indicates the level 
above which momentum is absorbed, namely the virtual level where the crop exerts 
friction forces.
Another feature that infuences the aerodynamics of a surface is the roughness
length (z0). This is a parameter used to quantify the distortion of the real wind profle 
over a rough surface from the ideal logarithmic profle if the surface were smooth; 
it is thus a measure of the aerodynamic surface roughness. Like the zero-plane dis￾placement, it has also the dimensions of a length and its value ranges from 10−6
 m 
for smooth ice to 0.3 m for orchards and 1 m for forests. Both dz and zo are related

to the form of the crop canopy. Obviously, zo depends on the roughness of the crop 
(uniformity of height among plants, distance between plants or between rows, 
amount of ground cover, etc.). The parameter dz also depends on the height and fex￾ibility of the plants and on foliage density. A simple approximation for the two 
parameters for different crops is to calculate dz as 0.65 h and zo as 0.13 h, where h is 
the crop height.
Typical profles of mean horizontal wind speed above crops are shown in Fig. 4.1. 
These profles may be calculated for neutral conditions (see Chap. 5) as:

and u* is the friction velocity, which is related to momentum fux:

∗ = τ

atmospheric pressure (Pat in kPa) (the effect of air humidity is neglected):

T = 3.484 (4.4)

Often, the only available information on wind speed comes from a nearby 
weather station where the wind is measured at a standard height (z = 2 m in agrome￾teorological stations). However, we may need U at a height z over a canopy of 
height h. We can use Eq. 4.5 to calculate frst U100, the speed at a height of 100 m, 
Example 4.1
Figure 4.1 shows the wind profles of two crops with height 1 m (e.g., wheat) 
and 4.0 m (e.g., olives), respectively. To construct this curve, we assumed that 
the wind speed at 100 m height is 10 m/s in both cases. The wind speed above 
olive is signifcantly lower than above grass. The olives slow down the wind 
more, or, in other words, they take more momentum away from the wind. 
Friction velocities are 0.60 m/s and 0.76 m/s, for grass and olive, respectively, 
which correspond to values of momentum transfer of 0.43 and 0.70 N/m2
.

4.4 Aerodynamic Resistance
The equation describing the fux of momentum in terms of the gradient of horizontal 
wind speed (Eq. 4.1) can be written using the Ohm’s Law analogy, by introducing 
an aerodynamic resistance to momentum transfer between heights z1 and z2. 
Therefore, if

r = 2 1 − (4.8)
and using Eqs. 4.2 and 4.3, then the aerodynamic resistance between a height z 
where wind speed is U(z) and height d + zo (where the extrapolated wind speed is 
zero) will be:

This equation indicates that the aerodynamic resistance to momentum fux will 
be higher for short than for tall crops. Short, smooth surfaces are less effective in 
slowing the wind that fows above them, thus less energy is transferred from the 
wind to the surface for a given wind fow. The resistance decreases as wind speed 
increases. In theory, the resistance tends to infnity as U tends to 0. However, that 
Example 4.2
Wind speed at z = 2 m above grass (U2g) is 2.5 m/s. We will calculate U at 
z = 5 m over a 4-m olive orchard.

does not occur during the daylight hours in the atmosphere because of buoyancy, 
which will be treated in Chap. 5. Suffce it to note here that as U decreases, the lack 
of turbulence reduces the exchange of heat between the crop and the atmosphere 
thereby increasing the temperature of the canopy and the air in contact therewith. 
This heated air tends to rise because of its lower density causing turbulence. This 
type of turbulence is called "thermal" as opposed to "mechanical" turbulence, which 
is due to friction of the wind on the crop. Both types of turbulence coexist although 
mechanical turbulence prevails when U is high and thermal turbulence is enhanced 
during the daytime when U is low.
4.5 Wind Speed and Turbulence at Canopy Height
The mathematical analysis of wind profles above crops presented above should 
allow the calculation of wind speed at canopy height as a function of crop height. 
However, the existence of the so-called Roughness Sub-layer, which extends up 
to 2–2.5 times canopy height has not been taken into account. In that layer, the 
profles of temperature and wind are distorted due to the proximity of vegetation. 
Example 4.3
Let us calculate the aerodynamic resistance for z = 5 m in the two cases men￾tioned in Example 4.1 (olive orchard with h = 4 m and wheat with h = 1 m) if 
the wind speed at 2 m height over grass (U2g) is 2.5 m/s.
We need to know frst U(z) for z = 5 m in both cases.
We saw in Example 4.2 that U(z = 5) = 1.33 m/s for olive

(4.10)
This equation indicates that for most agricultural crops, with heights between 0.2 
and 3 m, wind speed at canopy height ranges between 0.32 and 0.46 times the wind 
speed at 2 m over grass.
In the previous sections, we have defned turbulence as an ensemble of eddies of 
different sizes and properties (temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration) moving 
up or down and following, on average, the direction of wind speed. This vertical 
exchange of eddies is responsible for the fuxes between the crop and the atmo￾sphere. For instance, the convective transport of heat is due to warm eddies moving 
up and cooler eddies moving down. We can characterize this turbulent exchange 
using the average velocity of eddies going up, which is equal to that of those going 
down (as the mean vertical velocity is close to zero). This upward velocity, accom￾panied by a downward velocity of the same magnitude may be seen as a mean reno￾vation rate (wr) for the air located below. The renovation rate is proportional to 
horizontal wind speed (U). For neutral conditions, we can write:
w U r = 0 1. 4 (4.11)
Note that wr has dimensions of velocity. By combining Eqs. 4.10 and 4.11, we 
can calculate the renovation rate of air in contact with a canopy of height h:

And the relative renovation rate with dimensions T−1
 would be obtained by divid￾ing wr by canopy height h.

with height 2 m is:

And the relative renovation rate is 0.123/2 = 0.0615 s−1
This means that the air in contact with the canopy would be completely 
renovated in 16.3 s (inverse of the relative renovation rate). The concept of 
renovation rate is applied to greenhouses as a measure of ventilation and is 
usually expressed as the number of renovations per hour. In this example, the 
relative renovation rate is equivalent to 0.0615 s−1
 × 3600 s/h = 221.4 renova￾tions h−1
.

4.6 Wind Speed Within Canopies
If the wind profles are complicated above the canopy, they are even more compli￾cated inside it. In simple terms, the canopy height is divided into two or three zones. 
The top layer (above dz) absorbs most of the momentum. In this layer, the wind 
speed decreases logarithmically as we enter the canopy and has the same direction 
as the average wind over the canopy. This is seen in Fig. 4.2 for a hedgerow olive 
orchard down to 2.5 m height. Below that height, wind speed is almost constant and 
rather small (35–40% of that at the top of the canopy in the example of Fig. 4.2).
4.7 Daily and Seasonal Variation of Wind Speed 
and Direction
Both the daily and the seasonal time courses of wind speed are highly variable. The 
predominant winds have traditionally been characterized by the wind rose, which is 
a representation of the frequencies of occurrence of each wind direction. The sea￾sonal time course, besides being highly variable from year to year, is often site￾specifc. As an example, Fig. 4.3 shows the wind speed in Fuente Palmera (Spain) 
during the year. In this case, the highest values of U occur in spring and summer and

lower values occur in autumn and winter. The large differences between locations in 
wind patterns are evident in Fig. 4.4, which shows the monthly average values of U
in Bangui (Central African Republic), Cordoba (Spain), and Amarillo (Texas). The 
large variation among locations in wind speed is illustrated in Fig. 4.5, which plots 
mean annual wind speed for many locations as a function of latitude. Both mean 
wind speed and its variability increase as we move away from the Equator.
In the diurnal time course, we usually observe that calm conditions predominate 
at night while the maximum wind speed occurs during the day. Figure 4.6 shows the 
diurnal time course of wind over grass at Cordoba in June: U is low at night, espe￾cially at dawn, and U increases during the day.
A wind rose is a graphical representation of the distribution of wind speed and 
direction at a given site over a specifc period. Presented in a circular format, the 
wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from each direction, typically 
classifed in 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc., where North 
corresponds to 0°, East to 90°, South to 180° and West to 270°. The distance from 
the center represents the frequency of that particular direction, which may be also 
given for different wind speed classes (see example in Fig. 4.7).

Abstract
Air temperature shows unstable profles during the day and stable profles during 
the night. Therefore, canopy temperature is generally higher than air’s during the 
day and lower at night. Heat transfer between the crop and the atmosphere is 
sustained by turbulence and increases with wind speed, i.e. as aerodynamic resis￾tance decreases. In situations of unstable atmosphere, turbulence is enhanced (by 
added thermal turbulence) while in a stable condition, turbulence is reduced. The 
atmosphere water vapor content can be expressed by different variables (vapor 
pressure, relative humidity, vapor pressure defcit, mixing ratio, and vapor den￾sity). The fow of water vapor (equivalent to energy spent as latent heat) between 
the crop and the atmosphere is directly proportional to the vapor pressure differ￾ence and inversely proportional to the sum of the canopy and aerodynamic 
resistances.

5.1 Introduction
Air temperature controls the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Crop tempera￾ture affects photosynthesis, growth and development rates, transpiration, etc. Crops 
are heated by radiation absorption. Part of the absorbed energy is used to heat the air 
(sensible heat) which, in turn, determines the air temperature above the crop.
Air humidity is important in crop production for two main reasons. First, water 
and/or humidity are essential for living organisms in the agricultural ecosystem to 
grow and complete their life cycle. Secondly, moisture plays an important role in 
energy exchange. Changing water from liquid to vapor state, i.e. evaporation, 
requires 2.45 MJ/kg. When 1 kg of water vapor condenses and then freezes, 2.8 MJ 
is released. The frst process relates radiation absorption to water use by crops and 
the second process occurs when white frost is formed.
5.2 Atmospheric Stability
In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange between a parcel and its environ￾ment. If a parcel of air moves fast enough, the heat exchange between the parcel and 
the surrounding air is practically nil, allowing for the assumption of an adiabatic 
process.
An air parcel that rises adiabatically (see Box 5.1) from one level to a higher one 
expands and cools at a rate of 0.01 °C/m, before it reaches the condensation level. 
On the contrary, if the parcel is pushed downward if warms up at the same absolute 
rate. The rate of change of temperature of the air parcel with elevation (±0.01 °C/m) 
is termed the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Figure  5.1 shows the dry adiabatic rate

(dashed line) and the environmental lapse rates in two contrasting stability condi￾tions of the atmosphere. Figure 5.1 (right) illustrates an unstable atmospheric con￾dition. In this case, by raising a parcel of air adiabatically from point C to D, that 
parcel of air will have a higher temperature than the surrounding air (D′), will be 
less dense, and will tend to continue rising. The initial push of the air parcel may be 
mechanical or of thermal origin.
Conversely, Fig. 5.1 (left) illustrates a stable atmospheric condition. In this adia￾batic process, if an air parcel is given a push upward (/downward), its temperature 
will be lower (/higher) than the surrounding air and its density will be higher (/
lower), so the parcel will tend to return to its original position.
If the environmental lapse rate coincides with the dry adiabatic rate, the atmo￾spheric condition is neutral.
5.3 Basic Principles on Air Humidity
According to Dalton’s Law, the air pressure in the atmosphere is the sum of the 
partial pressure of water vapor (ea) and the partial pressure of dry air (Pd). Both 
partial pressures may be expressed as the product of their respective molar fractions 
by the atmospheric pressure (Pat).
From a water surface, some molecules escape in the evaporation process while 
others return to the liquid state. When the number of molecules escaping equals 
that of those returning, the system has reached a steady state and the atmosphere 
is saturated. In this state, the vapor pressure has reached its saturation value (es). 
Box 5.1: Adiabatic Processes
A process (change of state) that occurs without gain or loss of heat is called 
adiabatic. If the pressure of an air volume changes adiabatically from P1 to P2, 
the change of temperature (from T1 to T2) is given by:
T T P P Cv Cp
2 1 2 1
1
/ / /
( ) = ( ) −
(5.1)
where Cp and Cv .are the specifc heats of air at constant pressure and constant 
volume, respectively.
The above equation means that a mass of air at a pressure 100 kPa and 
temperature 30 °C will cool down to 20.8 °C if it rises adiabatically to a height 
where the pressure is 90 kPa. This temperature drop as height increases is 
called adiabatic lapse rate. Its value for dry air is about 0.01 K/m while it is 
lower for moist air, depending also on temperature (approx. 0.006 K/m).
5 Air Temperature and Humidity62
For a given temperature, there is a single value of es, and the relation between the 
two variables is an exponential function:

where es is expressed in kPa and T is temperature (°C). The atmosphere is usually 
not saturated, thus actual vapor pressure, ea is lower than es for that temperature.
Relative humidity (%) indicates the degree of saturation as:
RH
e
e
a
s
= 100 (5.3)
However, as it depends on the temperature, it is not a good indicator of the 
amount of water vapor in the air.
Another interesting measure of air humidity, widely used in crop ecology, is the 
vapor pressure defcit (VPD) which is the difference es–ea. It refects the drying 
power of the atmosphere and is therefore a key factor in determining the rate of 
evaporation and transpiration.
Air humidity may also be quantifed by the dew point temperature (Td), the tem￾perature at which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant pressure, 
to reach saturation. If the air temperature falls below Td, condensation will start. 
This explains the flm of water that covers the soil or plants at sunrise, after nights 
of intense radiative cooling, which is called dew.
The mixing ratio is the ratio of mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air and 
can be calculated (in g/kg) as:
X

= − 622 (5.4)
where Pat is the atmospheric pressure (kPa) and ea is the vapor pressure (kPa). 
Finally, air humidity may be expressed as vapor density (ρv), also known as absolute 
humidity, which is the mass of water vapor per unit volume of air and can be calcu￾lated ( g water vapor m−3
 ) as:
ρv

where T is air temperature (°C).

5.4 Temperature Profiles Within and Above Crop Canopies
The soil or crop surface undergoes cooling at night as solar radiation is zero and 
longwave radiation emission continues (Rn negative). The air in contact with the 
surface transfers heat to the surface, cools and its density increases. If radiative 
cooling is high enough and the wind is calm, a temperature inversion develops and 
the atmospheric condition is stable (Fig. 5.2).
During the day the opposite occurs. The surface absorbs radiation that, in part, 
serves to heat the lower layers of the atmosphere. The temperature now decreases 
with height and the atmospheric condition is unstable (this can be seen in the after￾noon in Fig. 5.2).
Example 5.1
Air temperature is 20  °C and relative humidity is 80%. We will calculate 
vapor pressure, VPD, mixing ratio, vapor density, and dew point temperature. 
We will assume standard atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa).
First, we calculate saturation vapor pressure:
es = +  ( )  
 0. e 61078 xp 17. / 26920 20 237. . 3 2 = 338 kPa
Therefore: ea = (HR/100) es = 80/100 × 2.338 = 1.87 kPa
VPD e e = −s a = − 2. . 338 1 87 0 = . k 467 Pa
Mixing ratio: Xv = 622 × 1.87/(101.3−1.87) = 11.7 g/kg
Vapor density: ρv = 1000 × 1.87/(0.4615 × 293) = 13.83 g m−3
Dew point temperature may be deduced by equating Eq. 5.2 to 1.87 kPa, 
the actual vapor pressure, and then solving for temperature as:

If this air is cooled down to 16.4 °C, we will reach saturation. This may be 
checked by putting T = 16.44 °C into Eq. 5.2, yielding 1.87 kPa.

Box 5.2: Efects of Atmospheric Stability on Turbulence
The mathematical treatment of stability effects lies outside the scope of this 
book. However, some remarks should be made on the importance of stability. 
During the daytime, turbulent transport is assured, as wind speed is higher. If 
wind speed is low, buoyancy increases and turbulence will be sustained. 
Therefore, only in rare cases, the lack of turbulence in the daytime may restrict 
the vertical transport of energy or matter. The opposite will occur at night as 
wind speed is usually lower and the temperature profle is typically inverted. 
In this case, there is a layer above the crop where turbulence is almost absent, 
thus resulting in small values of transfer of heat or water vapor.

Fig. 5.2 Typical temperature profles above and within a crop canopy
The shape of the temperature profles has important implications for the tempo￾ral and spatial distribution of temperature on crops. As we approach the crop sur￾face, thermal oscillation (the difference between maximum and minimum 
temperature) increases as higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures are 
observed.
Moreover, during the day, inverted profles can be observed due to cooling as a 
result of crop evapotranspiration. This situation is typical of summer when hot-dry 
air blows over irrigated crops. The phenomenon is called sensible heat advection 
and is explored in more detail in Chap. 7.
Both the day and night profles are often highly variable and are affected by other 
factors, particularly wind speed. When wind speed is very high, the temperature 
profle above the crop tends to be uniform with height, so the air and the crop tem￾perature are similar. In contrast, during calm conditions, the temperature profle is 
very sharp and the crop is much hotter than the air (during the day) or much colder 
(overnight). The temperature profles (stable or unstable) have an important effect 
on turbulence (Box 5.2).

day (July 30, 2011) near Cordoba (Spain). The values are shown as departures from the tempera￾ture measured at 3.0 m height
The temperature profles within the crop canopy contrast with those observed 
above the canopy. During the day, temperature reaches a maximum at the level 
where leaf density is highest. A high leaf area density allows greater radiation 
absorption and therefore higher temperature. Above this level, the daytime tempera￾ture profle is generally unstable and below, it is usually slightly inverted. During 
the night, the profle within the canopy is usually isothermal as the crop traps and 
re-emits radiation emitted from the soil (Fig. 5.3).
5.5 Air Humidity Profiles Above Crop Canopies
During the day, due to evapotranspiration, the vapor pressure is high near the crop 
surface and decreases with height. Water vapor is removed more effectively with 
increasing wind and turbulent transport. Therefore, the more pronounced profles 
occur at noon when evapotranspiration is higher and the water vapor is removed 
promptly. The vapor pressure profle at night is more uniform and may even increase 
with height on nights when dew deposition occurs.
5.6 Time Course of Air Temperature and Humidity
The time course of air temperature along a clear day follows a sine function with a 
minimum around sunrise and a maximum that occurs 2–3 h after the radiation peak 
(Fig. 5.4). The delay of air temperature relative to radiation is due to the balance

fall day (11 December 2012) in Espiel (Spain)
between the energy reaching the surface and the energy being used. Part of the 
radiation in the morning is used in heating the soil and the crop. Once these surfaces 
have been heated, there will be sensible heat transfer to the air that will then be 
heated. Furthermore, other factors (such as advection) can contribute to rising air 
temperature in the afternoon.
Vapor pressure varies relatively little compared to other variables that measure 
air humidity. For example, variations in VPD during the day are mainly due to varia￾tions in air temperature. In any case, vapor pressure close to the canopy is propor￾tional to the evaporation rate, thus it will be higher during midday (Fig. 5.5).
In contrast with the vapor pressure, the maximum relative humidity occurs dur￾ing the night because, although the atmosphere water vapor content is somewhat 
lower, the temperature is much lower. Although the vapor pressure can be slightly 
higher after noon, minimum relative humidity occurs typically sometime after noon, 
due to higher temperature.
To calculate the average daily vapor pressure as a function of maximum and 
minimum RH we can use the following equation:

The annual time courses of the air maximum and minimum temperatures follow 
a pattern very similar to the daily pattern (Fig. 5.6). Something similar occurs for 
vapor pressure.
Figure 5.7 shows the mean monthly vapor pressure in two locations with the 
same latitude (31.8°S) but with low (Klawer, South Africa) and high rainfall 
(Pelotas, Brazil). In both locations, vapor pressure is maximum in summer and min￾imum in winter, but the two curves refect clearly the difference in rainfall.
On average, the minimum and the maximum temperature occur with a certain 
delay compared to the minimum and maximum radiation, respectively. This is pre￾sented in Fig. 5.8 that shows the annual curves of average radiation and temperature 
in Cordoba. The causes for the delay between the temperature and radiation waves 
are similar to those described for the daily curve. During the spring, part of the 
radiation is used to heat the soil. As the soil temperature rises above the air tempera￾ture, more energy will be available to be converted into sensible heat. A similar 
reasoning can be applied to explain when the minimum winter temperature occurs.
The amplitudes of the waves of air temperature, both for daily and annual cycles, 
depend largely on the partitioning of energy between evaporation and heating of the 
soil and air above, as we will see in the following sections. Therefore, the amplitude 
will be higher in arid than in wet areas (or near the sea).

The maximum temperatures expected in summer are typically between 30 and 
45  °C with larger values occurring at mid-latitudes (Fig.  5.9). Minimum winter 
values are around 20 °C for zero latitude locations and decrease as we move North 
or South (Fig. 5.10). The variation of mean annual vapor pressure parallels that of 
minimum temperature in winter (Fig. 5.11).
5.7 Sensible Heat Flux
One consequence of the temperature gradients that occur over canopies will be a 
sensible heat fux (convective heat transfer) from the layers of higher temperature to 
those of lower temperature. Normally, the fux is directed toward the crop at night 
and from the crop to the atmosphere during the day. The term "sensible" means that 
this fux has an effect that can be detected as it involves changes in air 
temperature.
The sensible heat transfer is mainly accounted for by turbulence. The sensible 
heat fux (H) between the canopy and the atmosphere at height z where the tempera￾ture is Ta may be calculated as:

where ρ is the air density, Cp is the specifc heat of air at constant pressure, Tc is the

Water vapor fows normally from the surface of the soil or the crop to the air above 
the crop. This involves a latent heat fux required for the evaporation of water. A

during dew deposition. Similar to the fuxes of momentum or sensible heat, the

where γ is the psychrometric constant (around 0.067 kPa/K), esc is the saturation 
vapor pressure at canopy temperature, rc is the canopy resistance, and raW is the 
aerodynamic resistance to water vapor fux, which should be equal to aerodynamic 
resistance for heat transport (Eq. 5.11). In writing this equation, we are considering 
the gradient of vapor pressure between the inside of the leaves, namely in the sub￾stomatal cavities (where the air is saturated and at the same average temperature as 
the crop canopy) and the air above. Therefore, water vapor transfer will be subjected 
to two resistances in series, one due to the stomata and the second due to aerody￾namic conditions. The canopy resistance is thus related to stomatal closure and will 
be discussed in more detail in Chap. 9. Typical values of rc are 40–80 s/m for well￾watered annual crops and 100–200 s/m for forests and some fruit crops (e.g., olives) 
with good water supply. Under water defcit conditions, rc can reach much higher 
values than those indicated above.

Abstract
The soil temperature regime depends on its thermal properties (specifc heat, 
thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and thermal admittance). The main fac￾tors affecting the thermal regime are water content, soil texture, and compaction. 
The rate of heating (or cooling) of the soil is proportional to its diffusivity which 
is higher in sandy soils. The amount of energy stored in the soil is proportional 
to its thermal admittance. Soil heating occurs as a wave train with the amplitude 
decreasing with depth and a phase shift that increases with depth.
6.1 Introduction
The heat fux in the soil is an important component of the energy balance of the 
crop. The soil is a large energy accumulator that stores heat during the day and 
releases it at night. Something similar happens in annual terms. The balance of these 
exchanges determines the time course of soil temperature. Soil temperature is 
important in crop growth and development processes such as seed germination, root 
growth and distribution in the soil, nutrient uptake, root respiration, microbial activ￾ity, etc.

6.2 Soil Thermal Properties
The specifc heat of the soil is the heat required to raise the temperature of the unit 
mass (specifc heat per unit mass, CM) or unit volume (specifc heat per unit volume,

Using the defnitions of bulk density (ρb = mass of solids/volume) and gravimetric 
moisture content (θg = mass of water/mass of solids), the relationship between CV

This equation shows that soil specifc heat per unit volume increases linearly 
with volumetric water content (θv) and with soil bulk density.
6.3 Soil Heat Flux
Applying Fourier’s law of heat conduction, the fux of heat in the soil (J) can be 
expressed as:
J k dT
dz = (6.4)
where dT/dz is the temperature gradient and k is the thermal conductivity of the soil. 
At the soil surface (z = 0), the fux is denoted as G.
The thermal conductivity has units of W/m/K and depends on the porosity of the 
soil, water content, and organic matter content. The dependence of k on soil water 
content is complex. The thermal conductivity of dry soil increases twofold when a 
rather small amount of water is added. This is because relatively large amounts of 
energy can be transferred by evaporation and condensation of water in the pores of 
the soil. For example, for sandy soils, k can increase from 0.53 to 1.1 W/m/K when 
its water content increases from the permanent wilting point (PWP) to feld capac￾ity. A further increase of the soil water content to saturation implies a smaller gain 
in k since the water vapor diffusion is restricted as pores are flled with water

We have assumed bulk densities of 1.5, 1.4, and 1.3 t/m3
 for sandy, loam, and clay soils, respec￾tively. For each soil type, the table shows the thermal properties at soil water contents of Wilting 
Point, Field Capacity, and Saturation
(Table 6.1). Therefore, the thermal conductivity of wet soils is affected very little by 
water content variations in that range.
The change with time of the stored heat in a soil layer of thickness Δz has to 
equal the difference between the heat fow going in, J(z), and the heat fow going 
out, J(z+Δz) so, using Eq. 6.4 we may write:

where D is the thermal diffusivity (m2

fast a soil warms or cools (Eq. 6.6).
By adding water to a dry soil, k initially increases faster than CV so D increases 
with the water content. However, in a wet soil, k increases more slowly than CV, so 
that D becomes constant or even may decrease. As shown in Table 6.1 the diffusivity 
6 Soil Temperature and Soil Heat Flux76
of a sandy soil is higher than that of a clay soil especially when wet. Diffusivity var￾ies little with changes in water content in the clay soil and more in the sandy soil.
6.4 Spatial and Temporal Variations of Soil Temperature
When the soil surface is exposed to solar radiation, part of it is refected and the rest 
absorbed, increasing its temperature during part of the daytime. The temperature 
will decrease at night when no energy input is present and the heat is transferred to 
the rest of the soil and irradiated into the atmosphere. Soils are subjected to the 
cycling intensity of input energy at a daily or annual frequency.
To analyze the cyclic behavior of soil temperature, we will use T(z,t) to denote 
temperature at depth z and time t. Then we will assume that the temperature of the 
soil surface follows a sine function:
T t T A t m   0 0 ,    sin   (6.7)
where Tm is the time-averaged temperature of the surface, A(0) is the amplitude of 
the temperature wave at the surface, ω = 2π/Po and Po is the period of the tempera￾ture oscillations (86,400 s for daily cycles and 31,536,000 for annual cycles). With 
this boundary condition, we can integrate the differential Eq. 6.6 for T:
T z t Tm A e t z M z M   ,         0 / sin /  (6.8)
where M=(2D/ω)0.5
 (m) is called the damping depth which determines how much 
the amplitude of the wave is attenuated with depth and how much the phase is 
shifted in time.
The above equation indicates that the amplitude of the temperature wave decays 
exponentially with depth in the soil. Furthermore, the wave is shifted in proportion 
to depth, i.e. the maximum temperature occurs later as the depth increases. Both 
deductions are refected in Figure 6.1 that represents the daily time course of the 
measured soil temperature at various depths. The annual trend shows a similar pat￾tern (Fig. 6.2).
The depth where most soil heat exchange occurs is called effective depth and is 
equal to 20.5M. The heat fux density at the soil surface may be deduced by differen￾tiating Eq. 6.8, applying Eq. 6.4 and setting z = 0, which leads to:
G A k

This equation indicates that the temperature wave on the surface (Eq. 6.7) and 
the heat fow are offset by π/4, i.e. the maximum temperature occurs 3 h after the 
maximum G (daily cycle) or 46 days (annual cycle). If maximum G occurs at the 
time of maximum radiation, (1200  h, solar time), then the surface temperature 
should reach its maximum at 1500 h (solar time) for daily cycles. For annual cycles

the maximum temperature should occur on day 216 (August 5) in the Northern 
Hemisphere and on day 36 (February 5) in the Southern Hemisphere.

This total fux that enters the soil in one half-cycle will be equal to that going out in 
the other half-cycle since we start from a sinusoidal model of temperature, i.e. the 
temperature at the end of the period is equal to the initial temperature. According to 
Eq. 6.10, the amount of heat stored in the soil (and released by the soil) will be 
proportional to (k CV)
0.5, which is called the thermal admittance (units J K−1
 m−2
 s−0.5). 
For sandy soils, thermal admittance increases dramatically with water content from 
less than 1000 at PWP to more than 2000 J K−1
 m−2
 s−0.5 at saturation (Table 6.1). In 
clay soils, admittance changes little with water content.
The amplitude of the temperature wave decreases with soil texture in the order 
sandy-loam-clay. This order is due to differences in thermal admittance. In 
Mediterranean climate conditions, in late winter, soils are often wet. Sandy soils 
have a higher diffusivity than clay soils, thus they will warm up more rapidly in

spring. If the water content is high in autumn, sandy soils will also cool faster, 
which has agronomic implications in the decision about planting date. Conversely, 
if the soil is dry, the diffusivity of sandy and clay soils is similar, so we should not 
expect signifcant differences in their thermal regime.
The temperature profle in the soil changes signifcantly over the day (Fig. 6.3). 
In the early morning, the soil surface is the coldest zone and in the afternoon, it 
becomes the hottest. The profle along most of the daytime indicates downward heat 
fux while the fow is toward the surface at night.
6.5 Effects of Evaporation and Wind on Soil Temperature
Predicting soil temperature at a given time and depth is important for some agro￾nomic decisions. The practical importance of understanding the soil heat fux will 
become more evident when we address the energy balance at the earth’s surface in 
Chap. 7.
For a dry soil surface with no evaporation, the ratio of soil heating and atmo￾spheric heating may be written as:

7 The Energy Balance

Álvaro López-Bernal, and Elias Fereres
Abstract
The main components of the energy balance are net radiation, latent heat fux 
(LE), sensible heat fux (H), and soil heat fux (G). These can be manipulated 
through changes in net radiation, LE, H, or G. The relative importance of the 
components depends mainly on the water availability for evaporation. The 
extreme cases will be the humid environment (LE approaches Rn) and the desert 
environment (Rn is partitioned between H and G). Agricultural systems capture 
only a small fraction of incoming solar energy while the rest is spent in evapora￾tion and heating of the soils and the atmosphere.
7.1 Introduction
The exchange of matter and energy between the canopy and the atmosphere deter￾mines the variations in air temperature, humidity, and soil temperature as seen in the 
previous chapters. Turbulence facilitates heat, water vapor, and carbon dioxide 
fuxes which are all key factors in crop production. It also affects the transport of 
contaminants, pesticides, spores, or pollen. Understanding the partitioning of

available energy among the different processes is required for manipulating the 
crop’s aerial or soil environment, which not only affect the plant community but the 
whole ecosystem (weeds, insects, pathogens, and other soil microorganisms).
7.2 The Energy Balance Equation
According to the principle of conservation of energy, the equation of the energy bal￾ance of a crop canopy may be written as:
R H LE G P S n = + + + + (7.1)
where all terms have been defned in previous chapters except for P, the fux of 
energy consumed in photosynthesis, and S, the fux of heat stored in the crop bio￾mass and the surrounding air. P is usually negligible compared to the others (Chap. 
13). S may be signifcant only in very tall plant communities (e.g., forests) but can 
be neglected in the case of crops (Box 7.1). In Equation 7.1, fuxes are considered 
positive when they involve a loss of energy from the crop, i.e. when moving away 
from the canopy.
Changes in net radiation may be accomplished by variations in the shortwave or 
longwave radiation balances:
(a) Shortwave radiation: Incoming irradiance may be reduced using shades or 
changing the slope and orientation of the soil surface. Refected irradiance is 
changed manipulating the albedo of the soil (e.g., mulches) or the plants (e.g., 
whitewash or kaolinite).
(b) Longwave radiation: It is usually manipulated by blocking losses with glass, 
plastic covers, or nonsolid barriers (e.g., smoke).
Soil heat fux may be changed by artifcial soil heating or altering the thermal 
admittance by applying irrigation or compacting the soil.
Latent heat fux is mainly determined by water availability, so rainfall or irriga￾tion management will affect greatly LE. If the soil is wet, important reductions in LE
may be achieved using plastic impermeable mulches (Box 7.2).
The only alternative for manipulating sensible heat fux in the feld is using bar￾riers (windbreaks) to reduce wind speed. In controlled environments (greenhouses), 
we may add or remove heat or increase turbulence with fans.
Box 7.1: Calculation of Energy Spent in Heating the Canopy
The maximum standing biomass of annual crops usually does not exceed 20 t/
ha (dry matter).
Assuming water content of 70 g water/100 g fresh mass (e.g., maize for 
silage), we may calculate the energy term S for an increase in canopy tem￾perature of 20 K in 9 h, typical of summer in mid-latitudes.

7.3 Relative Importance of the Components 
of the Energy Balance
As water availability is the main factor determining LE, two extreme conditions can 
be distinguished:
(a) Humid/well-watered areas where water availability does not limit evaporation. 
Most of the net radiation is used in LE. It is the case of large water bodies (seas, 
lakes), wetlands, large irrigation schemes with abundant water or any area after 
widespread rainfall.
The water mass can be calculated based on dry biomass (B):

small (about 2%) as compared to typical values of solar irradiance under those 
conditions (600–800 W m−2
).
Box 7.1 (continued)
Box 7.2: Analyzing the Efect of Black Plastic on the Energy Balance of Bare Soil
The plastic sheet creates a barrier that suppresses evaporation (LE = 0) so all 
the energy is spent in G and H. A small variation in Rn may be expected as the 
albedo is reduced and long wave loss may increase when the plastic gets hot.
The partitioning between H and G will depend on the contact between the 
plastic sheet and the soil as any air layer between them will reduce fux into 
the soil. On the other hand, aerodynamic resistance is reduced as the tempera￾ture profle over the hot plastic is very unstable. Therefore, sensible heat fux 
is enhanced.
In summary, covering the soil with black plastic suppresses LE and reduces 
the G/H ratio, which promotes a higher temperature in the aerial environment.
7 The Energy Balance84
(b) Dry/arid environments where no water is available: LE is negligible and there￾fore net radiation is partitioned only into heating the air and the soil.
A special case is that of the oasis, a small well-watered area surrounded by arid 
lands. Here, horizontal transport of sensible heat from the arid surrounding area 
enhances LE in the oasis, so it may exceed Rn. This process of horizontal energy 
transport from dry to wet areas is called advection.
The energy balance of crops is usually between the two extremes (wet and des￾ert) depending on the availability of water and the presence of vegetation. This issue 
will be further explored in Chap. 9. Four different situations are analyzed below.
Figure 7.1 represents the daily time course of Rn, LE, H, and G on an irrigated 
cotton feld measured in June 2003 in Cordoba (Spain). This would be a typical 
well-watered environment. The Rn presents typical values of clear days at this time 
of the year in Cordoba. Most of the energy is spent in LE which is less than Rn dur￾ing the morning and higher during the afternoon. The sensible heat fux is small and 
reaches its maximum during the morning. From 14:00 the H fux is reversed, being 
then directed toward the surface. The soil is heated for most of the daytime, although 
G is very small as the crop covers the soil. The balance for 24 h shows that net radia￾tion was spent mostly in evaporation. In this case, the heating of the air and the soil 
in the daytime is offset by their cooling during the night.

An example of water-stressed crop is represented in Fig. 7.2 for wheat in spring 
around fowering after a dry winter in Cordoba (Spain). The soil was almost dry and 
consequently, crop transpiration was very low. As a result, latent heat fux is very 
small during most of the day while H and G use most of the energy during the day￾time. For 24 h, the percentages of energy invested in LE, H, and G are 12, 78, and 
10%, respectively.
Contrasting with the well-watered crop is the case of wheat stubble shown in 
Fig.  7.3. Around the measurement date (June 17), extraterrestrial solar radiation 
peaks in the northern hemisphere. However, the maximum Rn is slightly lower than 
in the case of Fig. 7.1, which is explained by the high albedo of stubble and straw 
covering the soil. The availability of water in this case is zero (the crop had extracted 
all soil water) which explains the absence of LE. The sensible heat fux parallels Rn
throughout the day, peaking around noon. The soil heat fux is now larger than for 
grass and decreases during the afternoon. Considering the 24-h period, 90% of the 
energy is spent in heating the air and 10% in heating the soil. Note that the straw and 
stubble covering the soil serve as thermal insulation.
Finally, Fig. 7.4 presents an intermediate between the wet and dry cases. It is a 
drip-irrigated olive orchard at Cordoba, where the trees cover only a fraction of the 
ground. At the time of the measurements, the tree canopy represented 40% of 
ground cover and the soil surface was dry. In the daytime, the three fuxes (LE, H,

is small at night. G presents a pattern similar to the cases above; the maximum 
occurs at noon because the percentage of soil exposed to direct radiation is maxi￾mum. For 24 h, the percentages of energy invested in LE and H are 79 and 21%, 
respectively, while G gets no share.
We have seen that the relative importance of the components of the energy bal￾ance varies throughout the day and that when summed for 24-h periods, G is usually 
small as compared to H and LE, whose relative magnitudes depend on the avail￾ability of water (or the presence of vegetation) on the soil surface. The impact of the 
fuxes on the oscillations of air and soil temperature depends on the absolute value 
of H and G. The difference between the maximum and the minimum temperature 
will be greater when positive fuxes are higher and negative fuxes are smaller.
7.4 Energy Balance and Nocturnal Cooling
Combining the equations of heat fux in the soil (Chap. 6) and longwave radiation 
loss (Chap. 3), Brunt proposed a simple model to calculate the variation of surface 
temperature (Ts) during the night assuming (a) Rn is constant during the night, (b) 
LE = 0, H = 0, and (c) soil temperature is constant with depth at sunset.

The admittance of a loam soil at Permanent Wilting Point is 1057 W m−2

(Table 6.1). For Rn = −70 W/m2
, the temperature drop after sunset would be 
10, 14.2, and 17.4 K after 5, 10, or 15 h, respectively. If the soil were at satura￾tion (thermal admittance 1835 W m−2
 s1/2 k−1
) the temperature would decrease 
only 5.8, 8.2, and 10 K.

where Ts0 is the surface temperature at sunset, CV is the specifc heat of the soil per

elapsed after sunset. The function (k Cv)
0.5 is the thermal admittance (Chap. 6). This 
equation implies that temperature during the night will decrease in proportion to 
longwave radiation loss and the square root of time after sunset. Soils with low 
admittance (sandy, dry) will cool faster.

7.5 Seasonal Energy Balance
The partitioning of energy for annual periods is also governed by the availability of 
water. Table 7.1 shows the energy available at different levels and the losses (parti￾tioning of energy) at each stage, for an irrigated olive orchard with 40% ground 
cover in Cordoba (Spain). Starting from an incoming solar radiation of around 
6000 MJ m−2
, the energy produced by the crop is equivalent to 7 MJ m−2
 as oil 
(2000 kg oil ha−1
). About 50% of the incoming radiation is lost by refection and 
emission of longwave radiation. Then, net radiation is allocated to evaporation 
(56%), heating of the atmosphere (40%), and photosynthesis (only 4%). Note that 
the soil-heating component is zero for annual periods as long as the mean soil tem￾perature does not change in the long run. Around 50% of energy converted by pho￾tosynthesis is lost as respiration, leaving another 50% fxed in tree biomass (shoots, 
roots, and fruits). Only 60% of fxed energy is harvested. After oil extraction, the 
energy captured is just 7 MJ m−2
. The actual effciency would be even lower as we 
are not taking into account other energy inputs required for the production of olives 
(machinery, fertilizers, pumping of irrigation water) (Chap. 37). In the same envi￾ronment, an intensive, irrigated wheat-maize rotation in about the same period (as a 
double crop, maize planted after wheat is harvested) could yield up to 19,000 kg ha−1
of 
grain, which would be equivalent to about 26 MJ m−2
, still a minute fraction of the 
incoming solar radiation of 6000 MJ m−2
.
Appendix: Practical Exercises on the Energy Balance
This section shows a set of solved problems dealing with the components of the 
energy balance. Calculations revisit some of the concepts introduced in Chaps. 3, 4, 
5, 6 and 7.

Example A7.1
Pesticide applications must be performed at periods of low wind speed to 
avoid drift. Evaluate whether the conditions are suitable for the application of 
a fungicide for a crop with plant height of 0.3 m if wind speed at a height of 
6 m above the surface is 2.8 m s−1
. Consider that the application height is 
1.2 m above the crop.
Equation 4.5 provides a mathematical description of the profle of wind 
speed above a crop (Uz) as a function of the wind speed measured at a refer￾ence height (zm = 6 m) above the same surface (U6 = 2.8 m s−1
). Here we will 
apply that equation to calculate the wind speed at a height (z) of 
0.3 + 1.2 = 1.5 m for a crop with plants of 0.3 m high (h = 0.3 m):

Pesticide applications are not recommended when wind speed exceeds 
2.5 m s−1
, so in terms of wind, the conditions are suitable for spraying the 
fungicide.
Example A7.2
In a maize plot, an old anemometer has been installed at 4 m high. The plants 
are 2  m high and the instrument records 2.4  m  s−1
. Evaluate whether the 
instrument works properly if a wind speed of 3.2 m s−1
 is measured at the 
same time in a weather station nearby.
Applying Eq. 4.7 we may deduce the expected wind speed at 4 m height in 
our plot:

This value is very similar to that recorded by the anemometer (2.3 versus

estimates.
7 The Energy Balance90
Example A7.3
The probability of infection by many fungal diseases is strongly related to the 
time during which the canopy remains wet after rainfall, sprinkler irrigation, 
or dew deposition. For the afternoon of a winter day in Cordoba, 14.8  °C 
temperature and 40.4% relative humidity were recorded. Considering that the 
variation in the actual vapor pressure is negligible, evaluate whether dew 
deposition will occur if air temperature is expected to reach 3.5 °C at the end 
of the night.

As Td (1.49 °C) is lower than the expected temperature (3.5 °C), dew depo￾sition will not occur.
Example A7.4
A wheat crop with leaf area index of 4 m2
 m−2
 and plants of height 0.5 m has 
been irrigated with sprinklers. In the hours following irrigation, average val￾ues of temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity at 2  m height were 
32 °C, 1.5 m s−1
, and 40%, respectively. Estimate the time required for the 
canopy to dry assuming a canopy temperature of 30 °C and a volumetric spe￾cifc heat of air of 1220 J m−3
 K−1
.
Under full cover conditions, the maximum capacity of rainfall interception 
is around 0.25 mm per unit of leaf area index (Chap. 9). Accordingly, the 
water intercepted by our canopy will be 0.25 mm m−2
 × 4 m2

The latent heat of evaporation is 2.45 MJ per kg of water, so LE is equiva￾lent to an evaporation rate of 0.9 mm h−1
. Therefore, the time required for 
evaporating the rainwater intercepted by the canopy (1 mm) will be 1.05 h.

Example A7.5
Evaluate the components of the energy balance for a bare soil covered by a 
transparent plastic mulch at the time of maximum temperature for a sunny day 
in March 21st in Librilla, Spain (38°N). Daily solar radiation and maximum 
temperature records were 22 MJ m−2
 and 19 °C. The soil had an apparent

Assuming that the maximum temperature takes place 3 h after solar noon, 
solar radiation will take a value of around 84% of that of solar noon on a 
sunny day. At this time and under these conditions, net radiation (Rnx) may be 
estimated from daily solar radiation (Rsd = 22 MJ m−2

The plastic sheet creates a barrier that suppresses evaporation, so LE = 0. 
All the energy will be spent in H and G, the partitioning between them depend￾ing on turbulence and soil thermal properties (Eq. 6.11). The specifc heat of 
the soil per unit of volume (CV) is calculated from Eq. 6.3:

Example A7.6
At the time of sunset on December 1st in Pisa, Italy (43.7°), the soil surface 
temperature was 11  °C.  During the night, net radiation was −60  W  m−2
. 
Discuss quantitatively whether plowing the soil has an impact on the tempera￾ture of the surface at sunrise considering the following:
(a) Non-tilled: Apparent density of 1.4 g cm−3
, water content of 0.2 g g−1
, and 
thermal conductivity of 0.83 W m−1
 K−1
(b) Tilled: Plowing results in a reduction of 20% in the apparent density and 
in a decrease of thermal conductivity, which is now 0.60 W m−1
 K−1
. The 
water content remains unchanged.
(a) According to Eq. 7.2, the temperature decrease over the night is propor￾tional to longwave radiation loss (Rn = −60 W m−2
) and the square root of 
the duration of the night, and inversely proportional to thermal admit￾tance. The duration of the night can be deduced from the latitude 
(λ = 43.7 °C) and solar declination (δ), the latter being a function of the 
day of year (DOY = 335 for December 1st):

Soil thermal admittance is the square root of the product of thermal con￾ductivity (k = 0.83 W m−1
 K−1
) and the specifc heat per unit volume (CV). The 
latter is estimated from Eq. 6.3. Required input data include the apparent den￾sity of the soil in g cm−3
 (ρb = 1.4 g cm−3
) and the volumetric water content 
(θv), which in turn is calculated from gravimetric moisture (θg = 0.2 g g−1

and the density of water (ρw = 1 g cm−3

1 m s−1

with Eq. 3.7. Input data include the latitude (λ = 38°) and the date (April

Now let us focus on the calculation of sensible heat fux (H) between the 
canopy and the atmosphere. Assuming that wind speed (Uz = 1 m s−1
) was 
measured above the crop at 2 m height (z = 2 m), the aerodynamic resistance 
(raH) is calculated from the zero plane displacement (dz), roughness length 
(z0), and roughness length for heat exchange (z0H). These can be estimated 
from crop height (h = 1 m), leading to values of 0.65 m, 0.13 m, and 0.026 m, 
respectively. Von Karman’s constant (kk) is 0.4, so, applying Eq. 5.11:

Finally, LE may be deduced from the energy balance equation (Eq. 7.1), 
assuming that the energy consumed in photosynthesis (P) and that stored in 
the crop and the air (S) are negligible:
LE = − R H n − = G − − 11 1 2 1 . MJm day
This is equivalent to an average fux of 128.6 W m−2
. Therefore, most of 
the available energy (~95% of Rn) is invested in the evaporation of water (i.e.,

Abstract
The components of the water balance (infltration, deep percolation, evaporation 
from the soil surface, etc.) determine the amount of water available to the crop. 
Water fows in the soil following the water potential gradient, which can be ana￾lyzed by the Richards equation. Infltration rate decreases with time until a 
steady-state value. Layered soils have lower infltration than homogenous soils. 
Deep percolation can be estimated based on soil properties and water content 
above Field Capacity, depending also on soil evaporation and transpiration. 
Runoff is calculated based on the Curve Number and the amount of precipitation. 
Monthly effective rainfall, i.e. not lost by runoff, can be calculated by the meth￾ods of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United States 
Department of Agriculture-Soil Conservation Service (USDA-SCS).
8.1 Introduction
The functioning of terrestrial ecosystems depends largely on the inputs and outputs 
of water, which determine the quantity and quality of water available for life on 
Earth. Water is the main limiting factor of agricultural productivity. Agriculture is

the main consumer of water for humans, taking two thirds of the total globally. 
Irrigation consumes more than 80% of the developed water in most countries of the 
arid regions. Therefore, it is essential to understand and quantify the dynamics of 
the fows in and out of the agricultural system, that is, to calculate the water balance 
components that determine the availability of water for crops and, where appropri￾ate, to quantify irrigation needs.
As described in Chap. 2, soils are comprised of solids, liquid, and gas, with typi￾cal fractions of 45–50% of mineral material, 0–5% of organic matter, and 50% of 
pore space that allows the fow of water and gases. The porosity (volume fraction of 
pore space) is determined by the arrangement of the soil particles, being low when 
soil particles are very close together (e.g., compacted soil) and higher when soils 
have high organic matter. Porosity is typically between 0.4 and 0.5 (Table 8.1) and 
decreases with soil depth because the subsoil tends to be more compacted. Soil bulk 
density (ρb) is the mass of soil per unit volume (solids + pore space) and is reported 
on an oven-dry basis (Table 8.2).

8.2 The Status of Water in the Soil: Water Content 
and Water Potential
The water content of the soil can be expressed in terms of volume (θv = volume of 
water/volume of soil) or mass (gravimetric, θg = mass of water/mass of dry soil). 
Both measurements are related through the soil bulk density so that θv = ρb θg. The 
amount of water (expressed in mm) in a soil depth Z (mm), i.e., the total soil water 
for that depth (TSW, mm), will be:
TSW F = − ( ) VC Z v 1 ⋅θ (8.1)
where FVC is the volume fraction of coarse fragments (soil particles exceeding 2 mm 
in diameter) which can be estimated as a function of the mass fraction of coarse 
fragments (FMC) as:

where ρb has units of t m−3
 and is calculated excluding coarse fragments. Note that 
2.65 t m−3
 is the average density of soil solids.

Water is held in the matrix of soil particles by adsorption and moves by capillar￾ity in the pores. Three values of soil water content characterize the soil water reten￾tion capacity (Table 8.1):
– Permanent wilting point (PWP, also called lower limit) (θPWP): The soil water 
content below which plant roots are unable to extract water, corresponding to 
−1.5 MPa.
– Field capacity (FC, also called drained upper limit) (θFC): The soil water content 
at which soil hydraulic conductivity is negligible, so drainage stops. It corre￾sponds to water potential between −0.01 and −0.03 MPa depending on texture.
– Saturation (θSAT): The maximum water content observed in the soil. It is on aver￾age 85% of the porosity (η). As the average density of the soil solid fraction is 
2.65  t  m−3
, we can calculate the porosity as a function of bulk density as 
η = 1–ρb/2.65.
8 The Water Budget102
The state of water in the soil can be characterized as a function of its potential 
(Ψ), i.e. the potential energy per unit mass or volume (units 1 J/kg = 1 kPa ≈ 0.1 m 
water column). The soil water potential is the sum of four components:
– Pressure potential (Ψp) which is the pressure exerted by free water above. In an 
unsaturated soil, Ψp = 0.
– Gravitational potential (Ψg) is the potential energy of water due to its position in 
a gravitational feld. It is calculated as g h, where g is the acceleration of gravity 
(9.81 m/s2
) and h is the height above the arbitrary reference plane.
– Matric potential (Ψm) is caused by the attraction of the soil matrix and the water 
molecules. The relationship between matric potential and soil water content, 
Ψm = f (θv), is called the soil-water characteristic curve (Fig. 8.1). The matric 
potential is zero in saturated soil and gets more negative as the soil dries. 
Campbell has proposed the following equation for computing the soil-water 
characteristic curve:
Ψ Ψ m e
v
SAT
b
= 

 


−
θ
θ (8.3)
where Ψe is called the air entry water potential, b is an empirical parameter, and θSAT
is the saturation water content. The values of Ψe, θSAT, and b for different soil tex￾tures are presented in Table 8.2.
Values of water content at wilting point and feld capacity may be deduced from 
the characteristic curves. However, factors other than texture affect the limits of 
water content in the soil. Table 8.1 compiles the means and intervals of variation.
– Osmotic potential (Ψo) is due to salts in the soil solution. This potential is zero for 
pure water and becomes more negative as the concentration of salts increases. An 
approximate relationship between Ψo (kPa) and the salt concentration (Cs, g m−3
) is:
Ψo s = −0.05625C (8.4)

Example 8.3
A water table is located at a depth of 1 m in a sandy loam soil. What is the 
water content at the soil surface under hydraulic equilibrium if the osmotic 
potential does not change with depth?
Hydraulic equilibrium implies that the water potential will be equal at the 
water table and at the surface; as the osmotic potential is also equal:
Ψ Ψ m w− − t g + = wt Ψ Ψ m s − − f g + sf
The matric potential at the water table is zero (saturation) and the reference 
level is the soil surface (Ψg−sf =0), so:
Ψ Ψ m s − − f g = = wt − × 9 8. . 1 1 = −9 81kPa

In the simplest case, we consider one-dimensional (vertical) water fow in the soil 
that obeys Darcy’s law:
J K d
dz w m = − ( ) Ψ Ψ
(8.5)
where K(Ψm) is the hydraulic conductivity, a function of matric potential and Jw is 
the water fow (kg/m2
/s). At saturation (zero matric potential), the hydraulic conduc￾tivity reaches its maximum value, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). The 
components of the water potential to be considered are the matric and gravitational 
potentials. Then, the equation above is equivalent to:

8.4 The Water Budget
Figure 8.2 shows a schematic diagram of the water balance of a feld. We may write 
the mass conservation equation for water inputs and outputs from that feld to cal￾culate the increment in total soil water content in the crop root zone (TSWC):
∆TSWC = + R I − − E E s p − − SR DP + WTC (8.9)
where P is the precipitation, I is the applied irrigation, Es is the evaporation from the 
soil surface, Ep is the transpiration, SR is the surface runoff, i.e. water not infltrated, 
DP is the deep percolation, and WTC is the upward water fow from the water table. 
For Irrigation Scheduling it is better to express the amount of soil water as a defcit 
(Soil Water Defcit, SWD), which is the amount of water required to bring the soil 
to feld capacity.
The water balance may be computed for different periods (hour, day, decade, 
months). We will focus frst on methods to calculate daily values.

8.5 Infiltration
The fow rate of water into the soil surface (infltration rate) decreases with time, 
until a relatively constant value that depends on the soil (Fig. 8.3), being higher for 
sandy than for clay soils. The initial infltration rate is inversely proportional to the 
initial water content. This is because the water potential gradient between the water 
and the soil is greater if the latter is drier. The water not infltrated stays on the sur￾face and moves to the lower parts running off the feld (see Sect. 8.7).
Infltration is usually lower in layered than in homogenous soils. This is due to 
two mechanisms:
(a) When a fne texture unsaturated layer is on top of an unsaturated coarser (e.g., 
sandy) layer, the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer is much smaller than 
that of the top layer, which accumulates water. After some time, as the soil gets 
wetter, the effect will disappear.
(b) When a coarse saturated layer is on top of a fne-textured layer, the latter will 
limit infltration (low saturated hydraulic conductivity) so water will accumu￾late longer in the top layer. This implies that more water will be available for 
root uptake despite the low water-holding capacity of the coarse soil.

8.6 Deep Percolation
An amount of water PI (mm) has infltrated a soil of depth Z. The amount of water 
that can be stored in the short term (SWCC) is:
SWCC = − ( ) θ θ SAT Z (8.10)
where θ is the average water content in the soil. If PI is higher than SWCC, the 
excess is lost by deep percolation on the same day. If the water content, after adding 
infltrated water, does not exceed Field Capacity, there is no percolation. Otherwise, 
percolation is:
DP = − SWCON Z ( ) FC θ θ (8.11)
Where SWCON is a dimensionless parameter that is the fraction of water above 
Field Capacity lost by percolation in one day.
Some simple models assume SWCON = 1, that is, all water that exceeds FC is 
instantly lost. Such simplifcation may be valid in very permeable soils, fallow situ￾ations, or early crop stages. However, SWCON is lower than 1, so plant roots can 
extract some of the water that exceeds FC, reducing percolation. When there is no 
crop or it has just been planted, deep percolation estimates are less sensitive to 
SWCON. Ritchie has suggested SWCON for different soil types:
Clay soil (very slow to moderately slow drainage): 0.01 to 0.25
Medium-textured soils (moderate to moderately rapid drainage): 0.40 to 0.65
Sandy soils (fast to very rapid drainage): 0.75 to 0.85
F. J. Villalobos et al.107
In the previous example, we applied Eq. 8.11 to a single day. However, we can 
extend this analysis to the days after the rainfall event to calculate the total percola￾tion. We consider a soil of depth Z (mm) with an initial water content θi that loses 
water by evaporation from the soil and crop transpiration at a rate equal to ET (mm/
day) (Chap. 9). After rainfall, an amount PI (mm) has infltrated, so water content 
now is θi + PI /Z, which is greater than θFC (otherwise, there would be no percola￾tion). We start with the differential equation describing the variation of water 
content:
d

θ = − ( ) θ θ − (8.12)
Example 8.4
We will calculate deep percolation for a maize crop growing on a 1−m deep

θ θ θ PWP FC SAT = SWCON − = − = − 0 10 = 3 3 0 25 3 3 0 35 3 3 . , cm cm . , cm cm . , cm cm 0.4.
The soil starts with a soil water content θ = 0.30 cm3
 cm−3
. A rainfall of 
45 mm has fallen and 5 mm has not infltrated.
Total water infltrated will be:
PI = = 45 − 5 40mm
Short-term storage is given by:
SWCC = Z ( ) θ θ SAT − − = 1000 ( ) 0 3. . 5 0 30 = 50mm
which is greater than total infltration. Therefore, 40 mm will be stored in the 
short term. Soil water content increases to:
θ θ = + = + = − 40 1000 0 30 0 04 0 34 3 3 / . . . cm cm
which is higher than θFC. Therefore, some deep percolation will occur. The 
soil is a medium texture soil (SWCON = 0.4):

8.7 Surface Runoff
The main factors that determine surface runoff are rainfall intensity, soil type, veg￾etation type, topography, and surface roughness. In the method of the Soil 
Conservation Service (US-SCS) all these factors are combined into a single factor, 
the “runoff curve number” (CN) that is proportional to runoff potential.
To calculate the CN, soils are classifed into four hydrologic groups from low to 
high runoff potential:
A. Low runoff potential: These are soils with a high infltration rate when wet. It is 
generally the case of sandy or gravelly soils, deep and well drained.
B. Soils with moderate infltration rate when wet, average depth and medium texture.
C. Soils with low infltration rates when wetted. These soils are of fne texture or 
have a horizon that hinders drainage.
D. High runoff potential: It includes soils with very low infltration rates when wet, 
such as expansive clay soils, soils with high water table, soils with a clay layer 
near the surface and shallow soils over impervious materials.
In addition to soil characteristics, in the calculation of CN, the hydrological con￾dition of the feld is considered, which can be good or bad depending on the slope 
and cultural practices. Table 8.3 shows the CN values based on hydrologic condi￾tions and soil groups, for different types of crops and conservation practices. Data 
in Table 8.3 correspond to CN2, i.e. the soil is at Field Capacity when precipitation 
occurs. For low (CN1) or high (CN3) water content, we use the following equations:

8.8 Effective Rainfall
Effective rainfall (Pe) is the fraction of total precipitation not lost by runoff or per￾colation and thus stored in the crop root zone. It is a broad concept, sometimes used 
to characterize the seasonal or monthly water balance. Several methods have been 
proposed for calculating monthly effective rainfall. They should not be used for 
shorter time intervals. The methods provide rough estimates as they ignore key fac￾tors like soil properties or the rainfall distribution within the month.
8.8.1 FAO Method
This method was the result of a study conducted by FAO in arid and sub-humid 
areas. The equation was developed to estimate the monthly effective rainfall (Pe) 
exceeded in 80% of the years and is used for irrigation system design. Effective 
rainfall is estimated as:
P P e = − 0 6. i 10 f m P < 70 m (8.22a)
P P e = − 0 8. i 24 f m P > 70 m (8.22b)

9 The Components of Evapotranspiration
Francisco J. Villalobos , Luca Testi, and Elias Fereres
Abstract
Evapotranspiration is the sum of evaporation from the soil and the plant surfaces, 
and transpiration. The evaporation from the soil in most cases follows a two￾stage process depending on whether the soil surface is wet after rain or irrigation 
or has already dried up. When the soil surface is wet, the evaporation rate is 
potentially very high; that is why the rainfall frequency is the main driver of soil 
evaporation, especially at low ground cover. The core model to quantify evapora￾tion is the combination equation, later applied to crop canopies and for comput￾ing plant transpiration known as the Penman–Monteith equation. This equation 
has two resistance variables (the aerodynamic and canopy resistance) which are 
hard to quantify as they change constantly with the physical environment and the 
plant’s physiological state. The Penman–Monteith equation is the established 
method to analyze the evaporation processes in plants and stands and has been 
thoroughly verifed. The transpiration of trees is heavily dependent on canopy 
conductance and scales up well with the ground cover or the fraction of inter￾cepted radiation.

9.1 Introduction
Evaporation from vegetated surfaces (or evapotranspiration, as it combines evapora￾tion from soils and transpiration from plants) is the main component of water loss 
from terrestrial ecosystems so its quantifcation is of great importance in hydrology, 
agronomy, and related sciences. Moreover, in agronomy, evaporation is usually 
directly proportional to crop productivity, as discussed in Chap. 14.
Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of direct evaporation from the soil surface 
(Es), plant transpiration (Ep), and direct evaporation from plant surfaces (Eps):
ET = + E E s p + Eps (9.1)
Transpiration is the water vapor fow through the stomata of plants, fed by evapo￾ration in the substomatal cavities. If the canopy surface is dry, Eps = 0, so:
ET = + E E s p (9.2)
Maximum transpiration (and ET) occurs when soil water is not limiting root 
water uptake, which usually happens for soil water content above one-third of avail￾able soil water (Fig. 9.1).
9.2 Measurement of Evapotranspiration
Crop ET can be measured directly by determining the mass of water lost from a vege￾tated surface or estimated indirectly. Direct ET measurement is done in weighing lysim￾eters which are large containers open at the top to enclose a volume of soil whose mass 
can be measured accurately and where plants are grown. Lysimeters are placed in the 
middle of large felds to ensure that the microclimate experienced by the plants inside 
them is the same as that of the surrounding plants. They are large and deep enough to 
ensure unrestricted root growth. For example, at the Agricultural Research Center of 
Cordoba (Spain), two weighing lysimeters were installed in 1987 with an area of 6 m2
each and a depth of 1.5 m. The measurement systems were accurate enough to register 
water losses equivalent to the ET of short sub-hourly periods (5–10 min).
Estimates of ET and fuxes of other scalars (e.g., canopy photosynthesis) may be 
obtained using micrometeorological methods (Box 9.1).
Fig. 9.1 Effect of soil 
water content on 
transpiration or 
evapotranspiration
F. J. Villalobos et al.115
The simplest method for estimating ET is the water balance, which requires esti￾mating the water balance components so that ET is obtained by difference. From 
Eq. 8.9 in Chap. 8:
ET = + P I − − SR DP + − WTC T∆ SWC (9.3)
Box 9.1: Micrometeorological Methods
Measurements of meteorological variables close to the canopy allow the estima￾tion of the energy balance components. For instance, by measuring net radiation, 
soil heat fux, and the gradients of temperature and vapor pressure above the 
canopy it is possible to estimate latent heat fux, using the Bowen Ratio method.
Instead of measuring the gradients, we can measure canopy temperature 
with an infrared thermometer, to calculate sensible heat fux and thus deduce 
latent heat fux.
A more sophisticated approach is the eddy covariance method. It is based 
on high-frequency measurements of scalars (temperature, absolute humidity, 
CO2 concentration) and vertical wind velocity. The covariance of any scalar 
and vertical wind speed (w) provides a measure of the fux of the scalar. For 
instance, the covariance of temperature and w is directly proportional to sen￾sible heat fux, while that of water vapor concentration and w leads to latent 
heat fux. Note that this technique may be applied to measure the fux of any 
gaseous molecule (e.g., ammonia), provided that we have the proper instru￾ment for measuring its concentration.
Example 9.1
Soil water content measurements were taken of a 1-m deep soil under a soy￾bean crop on two dates (August 11 and August 19). The average soil water 
content was 0.22 (August 11) and 0.175 cm3
 cm−3
 (August 19). In that period 
there has been a rain episode of 20 mm. Assuming no runoff, no deep percola￾tion, and that the water table is too deep to supply water to the root zone 
through capillary rise, we can calculate the ET for the period as the difference 
between rainfall and the increase in total soil water content:
ET = − P T∆ SWC
The soil water content in the frst date will be:
TSWC( ) 11Aug m = × 0 2. 2 1000 = 220 m
Analogously we calculate the water content on 19 August (175 mm).
The increase will be: ΔTSWC = 175–220 = –45 mm
And so ET will be:
ET =+= 20 45 65 mm

9.3 Evaporation from the Soil Surface
Philip described the evaporation from a bare soil surface (Es) after wetting, as a 
three-stage process. In the frst stage (energy limited) the soil surface is wet and the 
hydraulic conductivity is high, so the evaporation rate is only limited by the amount 
of energy available at the surface. In this case, the evaporation is approximately 
equal to the evaporation from a short grass feld, defned in Chap. 10 as reference 
evapotranspiration ET0. This stage continues until a certain amount of water has 
evaporated (Ue) which depends on soil type, ranging from 5–6 mm (well-drained 
soils) to 12–14 mm (heavy clay soils).
If the soil is partly covered by a crop canopy or by crop residues, the energy 
reaching the soil surface is reduced and so will be Es in the frst stage, Es1:
E f s1 PI ET0 = − ( ) 1 (9.4)
where fPI is the fraction of radiation intercepted that does not reach the soil surface.
When the second (soil-limited) stage begins, the soil hydraulic conductivity has 
been reduced to values that limit the water fow to the soil surface from the deeper 
soil layers. During this stage, Es decreases as a function of the square root of time 
since the start of the second stage (t):
E c t t s e = − ( ) −1 (9.5)
where ce is a constant that depends on the soil type, although its value is usually 
close to 3.5 mm day−0.5.
The third stage described by Philip corresponds to extremely dry soil in which 
water is transported to the soil surface as water vapor and the evaporation is 
extremely low. For practical purposes in agronomy, we can calculate Es considering 
only the frst two stages.
Therefore, soil evaporation depends primarily on the availability of energy at its 
surface and the water content of the upper soil layers (down to about 30 cm). Thus, 
when the soil is thoroughly wet, Es is similar to the evaporation from a full cover 
crop and can be assumed equal to ET0. By contrast, when the soil surface is dry, Es
is very low (Fig. 9.2).
Example 9.2
A bare soil (fPI = 0) is thoroughly wetted by a rainfall event. The soil param￾eter for evaporation during the frst stage (energy limited) is Ue = 9 mm and 
ET0 is 4.5 mm/day.
In this case, the frst stage (Es equal to ET0) will last 2  days, the time 
required to evaporate 9 mm:
U E e / / T . 0 = = 9 4 5 2 days
Therefore, Es(1) = Es(2) = 4.5 mm/day

Es(4) = 3.5 (20.5 – (2–1)0.5) = 1.45 mm/day, and so on.
If the same situation occurred in an olive orchard intercepting 40% of radi￾ation (fPI = 0.4), then evaporation in stage 1 would be:
E ET f s PI ( )1 1( ) 45 06 27 . . . = − 0 = ⋅ = mm/day
In this case, the frst stage will last 3.3 days (it may be rounded to 3). On 
the fourth day, the second stage will start so:
Es ( ) . ( ( ) .) . . 4 3 5 1 1 1 3 5 0 5 0 5 = − − = mm/day
Es(5) = 3.5 (20.5 – (2–1)0.5) = 1.45 mm/day, and so on.
Example 9.2 (continued)
According to the two-stage soil evaporation model, the average Es for a given 
period (month, year) will be proportional to the frequency of wetting. If wetting 
events have an average duration of WD, and the average interval between two con￾secutive events is WI, we calculate the average daily Es as:

where t′ = (ce/[(1–fPI) ET0])2
 if ce>(1–fPI) ET0. Otherwise t′ = 0. Please note that the 
square root function in Eq. 9.6 is only valid when positive. A negative value means 
that the soil stays in frst-stage evaporation so the average evaporation rate is equal 
to (1–fPI) ET0.
Equation 9.6 is obtained by assuming frst-stage evaporation during WD–0.5 days 
and the two equations (9.4 and 9.5) for WI – WD + 0.5 days, assuming that on day 
WD the rainfall stops in the middle of the day.
Example 9.3
A farmer has sown a summer crop during June in southern Italy (ET0 = 6 mm/
day). To ensure crop emergence, irrigations are applied every 5  days 
(WI = 5 day, WD = 1 day). The soil has a parameter for frst stage Ue = 9 mm 
and ce = 3.5 mm day−0.5. Calculate the average evaporation for the period.

Example 9.4
The average number of rainy days in Cordoba (Spain) during March 
(ET0 = 3 mm/day) is 9.3. In principle, this would imply that on average a rain￾fall event would occur every 3.3 days. However, rainy days tend to cluster, to 
occur in consecutive days. According to Villalobos and Fereres, the average 
interval between two consecutive rainy spells may be estimated as:
WI
f f w w

0 7. 5 1 (9.7)
where fw is the mean frequency of rainy days. In the case of Cordoba 
fw = 9.3/31 = 0.3, thus WI = 6.3 days.
Each period of 6.3 days would be composed of 1.9 rainy days (30% of 
6.3 days) and 4.4 dry days. Now taking WI = 6.3 days and WD = 1.9 days, we 
will calculate the average evaporation during March for a bare soil with

9.4 Analysis of Evapotranspiration with the 
Penman–Monteith Equation
The frst formulation of a combination equation to calculate evaporation was due to 
Penman in 1948, who combined the energy balance equation with those of latent 
heat and sensible heat fuxes. Similar solutions were proposed by Ferguson in 
Australia and Budyko in Russia. The most widespread formulation of the combina￾tion equation is due to Monteith who started from the following equations:
The energy balance (Chap. 7):

In this method, the slope of the saturation vapor pressure function versus tem￾perature (Δ, kPa K−1
) is approximated as:
∆ = −

e e
T T
sc s
c a (9.11)
where esc is the saturation vapor pressure at canopy temperature (Tc) and es is the 
saturation vapor pressure at air temperature (Ta). Rearranging Eq. 9.11:
e e sc = +s c ∆( ) T T− a (9.12)
Now using Eq. 9.12 and adding and subtracting es:
e e sc − =a s e e c a − + e e s s − = ∆ ∆ ( ) T T c a − + − e e s a = − ( ) T T c a +VPD (9.13)

(9.16)
The Penman–Monteith equation indicates that crop evaporation depends on 
meteorological (radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed) and crop factors (rc). 
In the case of ra apart from canopy characteristics (height, leaf area) there is a 
dependence on meteorological conditions (wind speed).
This equation has the drawback of requiring information on canopy resistance 
(rc, see Chap. 5) which depends on different environmental factors such as tempera￾ture, radiation, and Vapor Pressure Defcit (VPD). Canopy resistance is proportional 
to VPD in many species. Thus, on the one hand, LE increases with VPD, but if rc
increases as well, the response of LE to VPD will be asymptotic.
The Penman–Monteith equation is useful from a conceptual standpoint. For 
example, when the VPD tends to zero (extremely humid conditions) and the canopy 
resistance is small compared with the aerodynamic resistance (e.g., fat, smooth 
surfaces such as a short grass crop) evaporation tends to:
LE
R G n = ( ) −
+
∆
∆ γ (9.17)
This value has been termed “equilibrium evaporation.” The same equation 
applies to a canopy with infnite aerodynamic resistance. In these cases, evaporation 
depends only on radiation and temperature (as Δ depends on temperature). These 
conditions are found in short, smooth crop canopies with high humidity and large 
aerodynamic resistance (low wind) or crops growing in greenhouses.
The opposite situation occurs with high aerodynamic roughness canopies 
under windy conditions (low ra) and high canopy resistance (e.g., forests with 
variable tree heights and isolated trees with small leaves such as olives). In this 
case, evaporation (called “imposed evaporation”) depends only on VPD and can￾opy resistance:
LE
C
r
VPD p
c
= ρ
γ

(9.18)
These two extremes of equilibrium and imposed evaporation correspond to 
uncoupled and coupled canopies with the atmosphere. In a perfectly coupled can￾opy, the absence of aerodynamic resistance makes transpiration highly responsive 
to changes in VPD. On the contrary, the uncoupled canopy (e.g., grass in the 
absence of wind) is somehow isolated from changes in atmospheric conditions 
F. J. Villalobos et al.121
above it. If stomata close, reduced transpiration leads to higher canopy tempera￾ture, which tends to increase transpiration (see Eq. 5.12 in Chap. 5). In the feld, 
crop canopies are not perfectly coupled or uncoupled but somewhere in between. 
Those better coupled to the atmosphere (for example, tree crops) can exert more 
control of transpiration via stomata closure than those uncoupled such as smooth 
feld crops.
Box 9.2: Limitations of the Penman–Monteith Equation
Several authors (e.g., Paw U and Gao. 1988. Agric For Meteorol, 43:121–145) 
have questioned the validity of the PM equation when canopy temperature 
departs greatly from air temperature. In that case, the linear approximation to 
the slope of vapor pressure versus temperature may lead to large errors. The 
equation may be reformulated using a polynomial for saturated vapor pres￾sure. Using that “corrected” equation, the limit of LE when aerodynamic 
resistance tends to infnity is the available energy (Rn-G) and not the value 
obtained with Eq. 9.17. However, the limit of LE when VPD is zero is still the 
equilibrium evaporation (Eq. 9.17).
The other problem of the Penman–Monteith model lies in considering net 
radiation as an independent variable, while it will depend on canopy tempera￾ture and thus, on LE.
9.5 Transpiration
The calculation of actual transpiration is diffcult as it depends on meteorological 
(e.g., radiation) and plant factors, primarily through the response of stomata to the 
aerial environment but also including root system responses. For well-watered con￾ditions, we may assume that the transpiration coeffcient, the ratio transpiration/ET0, 
is proportional to the fraction of intercepted radiation. Then, transpiration 
(Ep, mm day−1
) can be calculated as:
E f p P = I t K Ef T0 (9.19)
where fPI is the fraction of radiation intercepted, Ktf is the transpiration coeffcient 
for full interception, which is close to 1 for most herbaceous and evergreen tree 
crops and between 1.2 and 1.8 for deciduous tree crops (Table 9.1).
For isolated trees, Eq. 9.19 becomes:
Ep t tree = REAK f ET0 (9.20)
9 The Components of Evapotranspiration122
Example 9.5
In Example 3.5, we calculated the radiation interception equivalent area of a 
small olive tree with radius 0.5  m in Cordoba, Spain on 21 March as 
REA = 0.69 m2

interception equivalent area (the ratio between tree intercepted radiation and incom￾ing radiation; see Chap. 3).

Villalobos et al. (2013) proposed a more detailed model for calculating the tran￾spiration of orchard canopies. The model considers a daily “bulk” canopy conduc￾tance (Gc), i.e. the inverse of the canopy resistance for the whole stand, a parameter 
that is related to VPD and to the radiation intercepted by the canopies as:
G QR

(9.21)
where Q is the fraction of radiation intercepted by the canopy (see Chap. 3), Rs is the 
daily solar radiation (MJ m−2
 s−1
), VPD is the vapor pressure defcit (kPa), α is con￾stant, and a and b are empirical coeffcients that vary with the tree species (see 
Table 9.1). As rc = 1/Gc, we can use the Penman–Monteith equation (Eq. 9.16) to 
calculate the transpiration of the stand. As orchard canopies are generally well cou￾pled to the atmosphere, similar results may be obtained using the “imposed” evapo￾ration equation (Eq.  9.18), which is much more practical as it does not require

where Pat is the atmospheric pressure (kPa). The coeffcient 37.08 103

. This model has been developed and tested in semi￾arid climates, where transpiration is primarily regulated by the evaporative demand 
of the atmosphere rather than by solar radiation only.

An intensive olive orchard at an altitude of 100 m intercepts 52% of the inci￾dent daily radiation. Let us calculate its transpiration on a sunny day with a

9.6 Evaporation from Wetted Canopies
When the plant is wet just after rainfall, the water flm and droplets covering the 
foliage will eventually evaporate directly into the atmosphere. Note that this evapo￾ration fux is neither transpiration nor evaporation from the soil, but the water 
involved is still coming from the rain or irrigation: it should then be evaluated and 
considered as part of ET (see Eq. 9.1) to assess correctly the components of the 
water budget.
Although the direct evaporation fux from wetted canopies is often overlooked, it 
may be appreciable when frequent rains wet dense canopies with high LAI, as they 
can intercept signifcant amounts of water. The maximum capacity of rainfall inter￾ception by agricultural species with full ground cover is around 0.25 mm per unit of 
LAI, i.e. a wheat canopy with LAI = 4 can intercept 1 mm of rain. High direct evapo￾ration occurs also with high-frequency irrigation using center pivots, as a signifcant 
part of the application is intercepted by the canopy. In all cases, direct evaporation 
is the main process to be evaluated to assess the canopy wetness duration after rain￾fall. This duration is strongly related to the risk of infection by many fungal dis￾eases; furthermore, during that interval, the transpiration rate is nil (see Fig. 9.3), so

10 Calculation of Evapotranspiration 
and Crop Water Requirements
Francisco J. Villalobos , Luca Testi, and Elias Fereres
Abstract
Reference ET (ET0) is defned as the ET of short grass with full soil cover, and an 
unlimited supply of water and nutrients. In the absence of water defcit, the ET of 
any crop may be calculated as the product Kc × ET0, where Kc is the crop coeff￾cient, which depends on crop related factors (leaf area, roughness) and ET0, the 
reference ET (grass), which is a function of climatic variables (radiation, tem￾perature, humidity, and wind speed). The main equation for calculating ET0 is the 
Penman–Monteith-FAO, although the Hargreaves equation can be used when 
only air temperature data are available. Kc is calculated by the method proposed 
by FAO that uses linear functions between the initial, maximum, and harvest 
dates of the cycle. The initial Kc depends on the frequency of soil wetting and 
ET0. The maximum values of Kc of annual crops and deciduous fruit trees are 
typically between 1.0 and 1.3 (median 1.2). The crop irrigation water require￾ment is the difference between ET and the sum of effective rainfall and soil water 
depletion. The latter may be an important contributor to meeting the ET demand 
and thus reduce the capacity (and investment) of irrigation networks.

10.1 Introduction
The evapotranspiration (ET) in the absence of water stress may be calculated as:
ET = K Ec T0 (10.1)
where Kc is the crop coeffcient, which depends on factors related to the crop (leaf 
area, roughness, and crop management) and ET0 is the reference ET, the ET of a 
well-irrigated short grass canopy. The ET0 is ideally only a function of climatic 
variables (radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed). This equation holds 
unless water stress reduces ET, which generally occurs after 65–80% of the extract￾able soil water is depleted. If depletion proceeds, the Kc decreases linearly to 0 when 
soil water reaches the Permanent Wilting Point (Fig. 9.1).
The use of Eq. 10.1 requires frst calculating ET0 as a function of meteorological 
data and then applying a Kc that changes as the crop grows. Several methods have 
been proposed for estimating ET0 (e.g., Penman-FAO) or the Kc (e.g., FAO) that will 
be discussed below.
10.2 Reference ET
Reference ET (ET0) is defned as the ET of short (8–15 cm height) grass with full 
soil cover and a good supply of water and nutrients. The concept of ET0 replaced the 
term “potential ET” which lacked a precise defnition.
In many regions, automatic weather station networks provide daily information 
via the Internet that allows applying formulas based on the Penman–Monteith equa￾tion. In other areas, the lack of agrometeorological data limits using the most pre￾cise methods. If only maximum and minimum temperature data are available, the 
equation of Hargreaves (see Sect. 10.2.1) provides a good approximation. In some 
cases, evaporation pans are available and they provide another estimate of ET0, as 
shown in Appendix B.
When time series of daily weather data and ET0 are not available, they can be 
obtained using stochastic weather generators such as ClimaSG (https://www.uco.es/
ftotecnia/climasg.html).
The annual time course of ET0 follows a pattern similar to that of solar radiation. 
For example, Fig. 10.1 shows the daily ET0 calculated by the Penman–Monteith 
equation in Santaella (southern Spain, semi-arid Mediterranean climate), typical of 
mid-latitudes. The mean values range from 1 mm/day in winter to 7 mm/day in 
summer. The average annual total ET0 is 1278 mm.
10.2.1 Method of Hargreaves
In 1985, Hargreaves and Samani proposed a simple equation for estimating ET0
(in mm/day):

where RA is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2
 day−1
), and Tavg, Tmax, and Tmin are 
the average, maximum, and minimum air temperatures (°C), respectively, while KRS
is another coeffcient already defned in Chap. 3 on solar radiation (Eq. 3.6). 
KRS vary between 0.16 and 0.19 for interior and coastal locations, respectively. 
This equation has shown good performance for different areas despite being based 
only on measured air temperature. This is because it includes a term associated with 
the potential radiation of the location, by considering the extraterrestrial radiation 
and a variable related to the degree of cloudiness (the amplitude of air temperature). 
Thus, on very cloudy days, there is little heating during the day (low solar radiation) 
and little cooling during the night (clouds reduce longwave radiation loss). 
Therefore, the maximum and minimum temperatures will not differ much. By con￾trast, on clear days the greater warming during the day and the increased cooling at 
night lead to a greater daily temperature oscillation. The Hargreaves method may be 
less reliable when applied in areas with little daily temperature oscillation or where 
the temperature amplitude is infuenced by factors not related to solar radiation, 
e.g. the presence of massive water bodies (coastal regions).

10.2.2 Penman–Monteith-FAO method
This equation has become the standard for ET0 calculation as proposed by 
FAO. Applying the Penman–Monteith equation (Eq. 9.16) to a hypothetical grass 
canopy of height 0.12 m and canopy resistance 69 s m−1
, we can deduce the ET0
(mm day−1
) for 24-h periods as:

10.3 Crop Coefficients
The crop coeffcient refects specifc features of the crop as they affect ET, such as 
leaf area, height and fraction of ground cover. By defnition:
K ET
ET c =
0
(10.5)
In irrigated crops, Kc depends primarily on the fraction of ground cover, and, if 
the latter is low, it depends on the water content of the soil surface as it determines 
soil evaporation (see Sect. 9.3). Thus, when the crop has not emerged yet, the Kc of 
bare dry soil may be as low as 0.1, but if the soil surface is wet, the Kc increases to 
around 1. With full ground cover, the Kc becomes almost independent of the water 
content of the soil surface and usually exceeds 1 (1.05–1.30), with a typical value 
of 1.20.
In some cases, the latent heat fux exceeds the net radiation, that is, sensible heat 
is used to evaporate water. This phenomenon typically occurs due to the movement 
of hot, dry air from dry areas surrounding a wet area where water is available for 
evaporation (oasis effect). We may distinguish the clothesline effect when advection 
occurs at the feld level and is characterized by sensible heat input decreasing 
inwards from the edge of the plot. At a smaller scale (micro-advection), sensible 
heat is transported from dry soil to the surrounding plants. If an isolated irrigated 
feld is surrounded by dry land (fallow, stubble, dry crops), the clothesline effect 
provides additional energy for ET so that the crop coeffcient may be much greater 
F. J. Villalobos et al.129
than the values indicated previously. This enhancement will be greater for small 
plots with tall plants, but there is no reliable model to quantify the Kc in these situa￾tions. Some authors suggest that the extreme value of Kc for isolated irrigated plots 
may be as high as 2.5, which should be considered a hypothetical limit reached only 
under infrequent extreme conditions and for a limited time.
The Kc is not constant during the season but changes with the ground cover, the 
plant height, soil surface wetting, and plant aging. The most widespread method for 
estimating the Kc at any time of the growing season is the one proposed by FAO 
(Doorenbos & Pruitt, 1977). This method represents the Kc curve as a set of straight 
lines. To defne the curve it is necessary to know in advance the length of phases A, 
B, C, and D, and the value of Kc at three points (Kc1, Kc2, and Kc3). The initial phase 
(A) ends when the crop reaches 20% of ground cover, while the rapid growth phase 
(B) ends when ground cover is 70–80%, which corresponds to values of Leaf Area 
Index around 2.5–3.0. Figure 10.2 shows an example of a curve of Kc for annual 
crops in which the phase durations are 40, 30, 30, and 30 days, and the crop coeff￾cients that defne the curve are 0.3, 1.2, and 0.5. Table 10.1 shows Kc2 (mid) and Kc3
(fnal) for several crops, and Appendix C presents a more complete list.
Although the methodology proposed by FAO allows ftting the crop coeffcient 
to specifc climatic conditions, in Table 10.1, we show the intervals of Kc that we 
believe may hold for temperate areas. Moreover, Table 10.1 also shows indicative 
values of the phase durations for different species. These durations should be taken 
merely as examples since the actual duration depends on many factors (cultivar, 
date of sowing or bud burst in trees, climatic conditions of the year, etc.). The main 
factor affecting the duration of the crop stages is temperature, which may change 
from year to year or if the sowing date is changed. For real-time ET calculation, the 
Kc curve should always be obtained using on-season information on the phases 
(beginning and duration) obtained from feld data.
The Kc in the initial phase (Kc1) is a function of the frequency of rain and irriga￾tion and ET0 during that period because most of the ET of a crop during this phase 
is direct evaporation from the soil surface. Bare soil evaporation is approximately

Fig. 10.3 Evapotranspiration of cotton in Cordoba (Spain) for phases A and B. Inter-row tillage 
was performed on DOY 156 causing an increase in soil evaporation
equal to the ET0 while the soil surface is wet (energy-limited or frst-stage evapora￾tion, see Sect. 9.3). As the soil dries, the soil hydraulic conductivity decreases (soil 
limited or second stage). The importance of Es in determining the initial Kc is mani￾fested in signifcant variations of ET in the early stages of the crop cycle associated 
with rainfall or irrigation (Fig.  10.3). Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) proposed a 
method of calculating the Kc in the initial development stage (until the onset of rapid 
crop growth, Kc1) that was summarized in the following equations by Allen 
et al. (1998):
For WI < 4 days:

      .  exp . . ln (10.6b)
where WI is the interval between irrigations or rainfall events during the initial stage 
and ET01 is the average ET0 during that period (mm/day). If we consider the effect 
of rainfall, major errors may arise if we assume that rainy days are evenly distrib￾uted over the period (Villalobos and Fereres, 1989. Trans ASAE, 32(1):181–188), 
thus a correction should be applied to calculate the interval between rainfall events 
(see Example 9.4). It is important to calculate the initial Kc accurately because any 
error will translate into errors in Kc during the rapid growth period (phase B) as it is 
interpolated between the values of Kc1 and Kc2.
10 Calculation of Evapotranspiration and Crop Water Requirements132
If real-time information on the ground cover fraction (fGC) is available, we can 
use it to calculate Kc in arid and semi-arid areas as:

The method described above is valid for well-watered plants and would thus be 
valid for irrigated crops or rainfed crops when soil water does not limit 
ET. Transpiration is reduced as soil water is depleted below a threshold (water 
stress), so the Kc is reduced. A simple model for estimating the Kc as a function of 
soil water would be:

Where Kc
*
 is the crop coeffcient with no water stress, θ is the average soil water 
content, and θFC and θPWP are the soil water content at feld capacity and wilting 
point, respectively. This equation is valid for θ lower than θPWP + (θFC–θPWP)/3. If θ
is higher, then the Kc is not reduced, which implies that most crops can use around 
2/3 of extractable water without reducing ET.
10.4 Crop Coefficients of Perennial Species
Forage crops and pastures have a variable Kc depending on management (cutting 
frequency, maximum LAI). For instance, alfalfa has an average seasonal Kc close to 
1, oscillating between 0.6 after cutting and then increasing to 1.2 before the next cut.
For fruit trees, evaporation from the soil may play an important role throughout 
the cycle depending on the fraction of the soil exposed to solar radiation. If the tree 
canopy is small, the Kc will be higher during periods with frequent rainfall. The 
contribution of tree transpiration is proportional to ground cover and nil during the 
winter season in deciduous fruit trees, contrary to evergreen fruit trees (olive, citrus) 
that keep their leaf area the whole year. In these evergreen species, under mild 
Mediterranean climates, the Kc may be maximum in winter (high soil evaporation 
due to high frequency of rain) and minimum during summer (low soil evaporation, 
high stomatal resistance in response to high VPD) (Fig. 10.4).
10.5 Correction of Crop Coefficients
The FAO method for calculating ET was originally developed by William Pruitt in 
California by considering actual grass ET as the reference crop. It turns out that 
according to theory, the ratio of crop ET and grass ET should increase as the aero￾dynamic component of the combination ET formula increases, i.e. as wind speed 
and VPD increase. Therefore, the FAO manual 24 included a correction for crop 
coeffcients taking into account crop height, wind, and relative humidity.

The revision of the FAO methodology by Allen et al. (1998) changed the refer￾ence crop from a real grass crop to a hypothetical grass with constant height and 
surface resistance. Nevertheless, they kept the same correction of crop coeffcients. 
This is an important faw. Most plants control water loss by partial stomatal closure 
when evaporative demand increases. Therefore, with a reference grass with constant 
stomatal aperture, crops should tend to decrease the Kc as evaporative demand 
increases. This is exactly the opposite of the proposed correction included in FAO 
56. We show evidence of the decrease of Kc as ET0 increases for different crops in 
Table  10.2. Therefore, we recommend sticking to the coeffcients proposed in 
Table 10.1 and Appendix C and making only corrections based on local measure￾ments if they are required.
10.6 Evapotranspiration in Greenhouses
The ET inside greenhouses is usually lower than in the open feld because the shelter 
cover reduces the incoming radiation, the driving force of ET, and turbulence. 
Specifc methods have been developed to evaluate the ET of screened or sheltered 
crops. In sophisticated greenhouses, such as those used for high-value crops or 
ornamental horticulture, with climatic control (heating/cooling, supplemental light, 
etc.) sensor data are available to run complex transpiration models in short time 
steps (e.g., 10  min). Furthermore, the sensors may provide indirect estimates

of greenhouse ET. For instance, measurements of airfow into the greenhouse 
(Qin, m3

) along with sensors of temperature and air vapor pressure in air going in 
(Tin, ein) and out (Tout, eout) allow calculating ET of a greenhouse (mm/hour) of 
surface area Ag (m2

where temperatures are given in K and vapor pressures in kPa.
A different case is that of unheated greenhouses with passive ventilation, typi￾cally with plastic covers, such as those on the Mediterranean coast of Almeria 
(Spain) and other mild climate areas. The conditions inside the greenhouse are char￾acterized by reduced turbulence, higher humidity, and higher temperature than the 
outside. This combination in theory leads to equilibrium ET (see Eq. 9.17), i.e. ET
is governed by radiation, which has been confrmed empirically leading to an equa￾tion for reference evapotranspiration (ET0, mm day−1
) of the form:
ET0 Rsi
1
2 45  0 7 .  . 
 
(10.10)
where Rsi (MJ m−2
 day−1
) is the solar radiation inside the greenhouse, which can also 
be estimated from the solar radiation measured in the open if the transmissivity of 
the cover (τgc) is known (Rsi = τgc Rs). For instance, the transmissivity of polyethyl￾ene flm of 0.2 mm is around 0.7.
Once the reference ET is known inside the greenhouse, the calculation of ET
requires a crop coeffcient, which is usually somewhat higher (10–20%) than that 
of crops grown outside. For instance, measurements of Kc values of greenhouse 
tomatoes have reached 1.4 while those in open felds seldom exceed 1.2.
10.7 Calculation of Maximum ET for Designing 
Irrigation Systems
The crop ET can vary from year to year depending on weather conditions. To design 
irrigation systems, it would be desirable to have a historical series of ET (and 
precipitation) to determine the water requirements at different probability levels.

with clear skies during summer. 2: Continental climates in mid-latitudes and sub-humid climates 
with variable cloudiness. 3: Mid-latitude continental climates with ET up to 5 mm/day. 4: Mid￾latitude continental climates with ET up to 10 mm/day
Often we only have the average values of crop ET, which will be exceeded in 
some years. Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) proposed an adjustment method for calcu￾lating the ET which corresponds to a probability level of 75% (ET75, which will be 
exceeded only 25% of the years) as a function of the average ET (ETavg) and the 
mean irrigation applied (Ia). The method is shown in Fig. 10.5, where four different 
climate types are considered. Each line can be calculated as:

where the mean irrigation applied is given in mm and the coeffcient C is 1.21, 1.49, 
1.33, and 1.43, for types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Note that, ideally, irrigation systems should be designed to supply the peak or 
maximum ET level corresponding to the period of the highest ET of the crop mix of 
the farm rotation or of the irrigated area. The decision to determine the size of the 
irrigation network is economic. Flow rates below the maximum requirements of 
the extreme year and the highest demanding crop of the rotation will require less 
capital investment but will increase the risks of crop water defcits. If the system is 
10 Calculation of Evapotranspiration and Crop Water Requirements136
dimensioned for annual crops of low requirements (for example, winter cereals), its 
conversion to summer crops or perennials is not possible without leaving some of 
the land unirrigated.
Example 10.1
We will calculate the ET of maize during August (Kc = 1.2) in Evora, Portugal 
(ET0 = 7.0 mm/day) and Paris, France (ET0 = 4.0 mm/day) for 75% probabil￾ity assuming that irrigation doses of 60 mm are applied.
We calculate the average ET for both locations:
Evora. ET = 1.2 × 7.0 = 8.4 mm day−1
Paris. ET = 1.2 × 4.0 = 4.8 mm day−1
Evora has a semi-arid climate so it corresponds to type 1 (Fig. 10.5). Paris 
has a sub-humid climate during summer (type 2). Applying Eq.  10.11  for 
Evora (C = 1.21):

Therefore, the values of ET75 for the two locations will be:
Evora: ET75 = 1.10 × 8.4 = 9.2 mm/day
Paris : ET75 = 1.26 × 4.8 = 6.0 mm/day
10.8 Calculation of Crop Water Requirements
Crop irrigation water requirement is the amount of water to be supplied to maintain 
a maximum level of ET. It can be calculated invoking the water balance (Chap. 8) 
as the difference between the ET (the potential value, without restrictions of any 
kind) and water supplied by rainfall or extracted from the soil during a given period:
I E req   T Pe e      TSWC   ET P T  SWC (10.12)
Note that the soil water extraction is expressed as an increase in the total soil 
water content (TSWC) with a negative sign. In this equation, Pe is the effective pre￾cipitation, i.e. precipitation not lost by runoff or deep percolation (see Chap. 8).
F. J. Villalobos et al.137
We can distinguish between net and gross water requirements. In the frst case, 
we refer to the amount of water required assuming no losses during irrigation and 
perfect uniformity in the spatial distribution of irrigation water. These assumptions 
are never met and we are forced to apply more water than the net requirement 
(Chap. 23). The total amount to apply including excess water is the gross irrigation 
water requirement (Ireq/application effciency).
The term related to soil water storage is frequently omitted in the calculations 
which may lead to large overestimations of Ireq. The soil water stored at sowing 
depends on the recharge during the fallow period since the harvest of the previous 
crop. This can be calculated by adding effective precipitation and discounting soil 
evaporation (Eq. 9.6) during fallow. This value should not exceed the soil water 
storage capacity (Chap. 8). Stored soil water is seen in irrigated agriculture as an 
insurance against irrigation system failures and extremely high ET periods, thus 
keeping a moderately high level of soil water during the irrigation season reduces 
risks. However, by the end of the season, soil water should be nearly depleted, thus 
it is possible to use a large fraction of stored soil water (e.g., 80–90%) that should 
be discounted from the requirements of the fnal period (see Chap. 20 on irrigation 
scheduling).
The calculation of Ireq may be performed for different time intervals (weeks, 
months) and different spatial scales (feld, farm, irrigation scheme). The frst step is 
always computing the Ireq of each feld and then obtaining the weighted average 
using the fractions of the area as weights.
For instance, the average farm Ireq is:
I I s req
n
farm    reqi i
1
where n is the number of crops, and Ireq i and si are irrigation water requirement and 
the fraction of farm area of crop i, respectively.
Appendices
Appendix A: Class A Evaporation Pan
A relatively simple way to obtain ET0 is to measure the evaporation from a free 
water surface in a standardized device and then apply some empirical relationships 
to convert the direct evaporation of water to that of grass. This method became quite 
popular because it does not require weather stations, thus it is affordable for farmers 
even in undeveloped countries. However, the corrections to apply depend also on 
the micrometeorology of the place where the device is installed.
The most popular model of these devices is the standard National Weather 
Service Class A type evaporation pan that has a diameter of 1.21 m and a height of 
0.254 m. It is normally installed on a wooden platform set on the ground. The pan 
is flled with water to within 6 cm of the top and exposed to represent an open body 
of water. The evaporation rate is measured as the difference in water level between 
consecutive measurements.
10 Calculation of Evapotranspiration and Crop Water Requirements138
Then, the reference ET may be calculated as:
ET0 = K Ep pan (A10.1.1)
where Epan is the measured pan evaporation (mm/day) and Kp is the pan coeffcient 
that is in the range of 0.35–0.85 with an average value of 0.75. The actual value will 
depend on the surroundings of the pan, relative humidity, and wind speed. According 
to FAO manual 24, if the pan is surrounded by crops, the pan coeffcient is:

Where U is the wind speed (m/s) at 2-m height, X is the distance (m) covered

Appendix B: Calculating Crop Coefficients Following the Model 
of Ritchie’s
As a crop grows, intercepted radiation increases and so does the energy available for 
transpiration. At the same time, the energy available for evaporation at the soil sur￾face decreases. In 1972, Professor Joe T. Ritchie proposed a model for calculating 
crop ET by computing transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface sepa￾rately. Using this model, the Kc may be calculated as a function of ground cover and 
soil wetting frequency.
Model results are summarized in Eq. A10.2.1 where Kc is a function of ET0, the 
interval between rain events or irrigations (WI) and the fraction of ground covered 
by the crop (fGC). The lower values of Kc occur when WI is large and ET0 is high, if 
fGC is very small. In contrast, when fGC is high, Kc varies little with ET0 and WI.

Abstract
Growth of crops, plants, or plant parts is defned as the irreversible increase in 
size, whereas development is the continuous change in plant form and function 
with characteristic transition phases. Growth is primarily associated with the 
capture and allocation of resources, whereas development is mostly related to 
non-resource environmental cues such as temperature, photoperiod, and light 
quality. We separate development and growth conceptually, but both types of 
processes are closely linked. Thermal time and variations of thermal time cor￾rected to account for photoperiod and vernalization are useful to model crop 
phenological development. Crop development, in particular the time of fower￾ing, is one of the most important traits for crop adaptation. Breeders, agrono￾mists, and growers understand the importance of matching the pattern of 
phenological development to their particular environments and use a combina￾tion of genetic and agronomic tools to manipulate development. Crop growth 
depends on (i) the capacity of the canopy to capture CO2 and radiation and the 
capacity of the root system to capture water and nutrients from the soil, (ii) the 
effciency of the crop to transform resources (water, nutrients, radiation, carbon 
dioxide) into dry matter, and (iii) the partitioning of dry matter among plant 
parts. Stresses such as water defcits or soil compaction reduce growth by reduc￾ing the amount of resources captured by the crop, by reducing the effciency in 
the use of resources, or both.

11.1 Introduction
Growth of crops, plants, or plant parts is defned as the increase in size or mass, 
whereas development is the qualitative change in plant form and function with char￾acteristic transition phases. The expansion of a leaf or the accumulation of crop 
biomass is typically a growth process, whereas the transition from a vegetative mer￾istem, producing leaves, to a reproductive meristem producing fowers is a charac￾teristic developmental process. We distinguish morphological development (e.g., 
appearance of successive structures in the plant) from phenological or phasic devel￾opment, which deals with the duration of the different phases of the crop cycle.
The distinction between growth and development is important for two reasons. 
First, growth is primarily associated with the capture and allocation of resources, 
whereas development is mostly related to non-resource environmental cues such as 
temperature, photoperiod, and light quality. Second, the physiological processes 
involved are different, as discussed in this chapter. Whereas we separate growth and 
development conceptually, organs, plants, and crops grow and develop simultane￾ously, and for many agronomically important traits, the limits between growth and 
development are blurred. For example, a wheat grain grows, i.e. it expands in volume, 
and gains mass and also develops, e.g. leaf and root primordia are differentiated in 
the embryo. Developmental biology (Box 11.1) and crop growth analysis are thus 
distinct perspectives underpinning the investigation of development and growth. 
In this chapter, we outline agronomically important aspects of these processes.
Box 11.1: Developmental Biology
The fundamental question of developmental biology is this: how do different 
cellular phenotypes emerge from cells that share a common set of genes? A 
typical fowering plant has 30 different cell types, whereas a typical vertebrate 
has about 120 cell types. All this diversity has to be explained in terms of dif￾ferential gene expression, as the 30 or so cell types in a plant share the same 
genome—genetically, the cells of the wheat root endodermis and the meso￾phyll cells in the fag leaf of the same plant are essentially identical. Likewise, 
your neurons and liver cells are genetically identical, but their shape and 
physiology are different. For readers interested in this question, we recom￾mend the book by Mary Jane West-Eberhard: Developmental plasticity and 
evolution (Oxford University Press, 2003).
Some examples demonstrate the practical implications of understanding 
the process of cell differentiation. Stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells 
with the potential to generate any cell type, present animal and human health 
with potential opportunities for new therapies. Short time between genera￾tions is one of the cornerstones of successful plant breeding programs. Making 
use of advanced knowledge of cell differentiation and tissue culture, breeders 
can currently grow up to six generations of chickpeas in a single year. 
Likewise, tissue culture exploiting the principles of cell differentiation is a 
rapid, effective, and cheap method to generate virus-free seedlings of high 
value in horticulture.

11.2 Phenological Development
Scales have been devised to characterize phenological development in annual and 
perennial crops. They are based on the concept of phenostage; major phenostages in 
annual crops include
1 Sowing
2 Germination
3 Emergence
4 Juvenile phase/initiation of leaves
5 Floral initiation (formation of primordia of reproductive structures)
6 Flowering
7 Physiological maturity
8 Harvest maturity
The case of perennial species is more complex. Trees stay in the juvenile phase, 
thus not fowering, for several years after seed germination. However, most trees of 
agricultural interest are not propagated by seeds but vegetatively from cuttings that 
are rooted in nurseries. In this case, the cutting may not be juvenile, which reduces 
the time until fowering. In some tree species, the growth of the main stem beyond 
a certain length accelerates the end of the juvenile period. Once the juvenile phase 
is over, the tree will follow annual cycles that resemble those of an annual plant, 
following two possible strategies:
(a) Deciduous species: Most fruit trees and vines belong to this category. All the 
leaves fall in autumn-winter in response to cold temperatures and/or short pho￾toperiod. Buds stay dormant during winter and usually require low tempera￾tures for an extended period (chilling requirement) until they respond to warm 
temperatures and bud break occurs. After that, vegetative and reproductive 
growth will occur with a degree of overlap that depends on the species. For 
instance, fowering may occur before leaf growth starts (stone fruits, e.g. peach) 
or later (pome fruits, e.g. apple), while harvest may occur in early to midsum￾mer (several months before leaf fall, e.g. cherry) or in late summer or start of 
autumn (e.g., apple).
(b) Evergreen species: They include Citrus spp., olive, and tropical fruit trees (e.g., 
mango). Leaves stay in the tree for long periods (2–3 years). In some cases 
(e.g., olive), the tree stays dormant (no vegetative growth) during winter and 
resumes growth in the spring.
The period between two phenostages constitutes a phenophase; we can be inter￾ested, for example, in the phase sowing-emergence or emergence-fowering. Some 
of these phases are well defned biologically, for example, the phase between foral 
initiation and fowering. Other phases are not defned biologically but with agro￾nomic criteria; for example, the phase from physiological maturity, when grain 
reaches its maximum dry matter, to harvest maturity, when grains reach a moisture 
content suitable for mechanical harvest. Harvest maturity of wine grapes is defned 
by oenological criteria, including sugar concentration and acidity, and 
11 Crop Development and Growth148
complementary traits such as color and aromas. Sugar/acid ratio is an important trait 
for the decision of harvest in most fruit crops.
The duration of the cycle of different crops is shown in Appendix (Table 11.1).
All phenophases are responsive to temperature, which is the main environmental 
infuence on development (Box 11.2). The phase sowing-emergence is also infu￾enced by the content of water and oxygen in the soil. In sorghum and pulses such as 
faba bean and chickpea, soil water content also modulates the transition to repro￾duction. In wheat, mild water defcits accelerate fowering while severe defcits 
delay it. In some species, photoperiod also affects the duration of some pheno￾phases. Some species and phases are also responsive to low temperatures in a pro￾cess called vernalization. Here we outline the effects of mean temperature, low 
temperature (vernalization), and photoperiod on phenological development.
Box 11.2: Phenology and Global Warming
Phenological shifts are the most conspicuous biological signal of global 
warming. Using a systematic phenological network data set of more than 
125,000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 
European countries between 1971 and 2000, it was found that 78% of all leaf￾ing, fowering, and fruiting records advanced (30% signifcantly) and 3% 
were signifcantly delayed.
The consequences of warming for agriculture are numerous and varied. At 
high latitudes, warming is extending the window for cropping, with overall 
positive implications for crop production. In China and the USA, milder win￾ters are allowing for earlier crop sowing, which combined with new varieties 
and practices is improving crop production. Climate projections and model￾ling indicate that Finland’s crop productivity by 2050 will be close to the 
productivity in Denmark in the 2000s. In 2000, the EU has accepted Denmark 
as a wine-producing country, and the Association of Danish Winegrowers 
now counts more than 1400 members. In temperate environments like the 
Pampas, warming over the last few decades has shortened the season of wheat 
crops, allowing for early sowing and higher yield of soybean in wheat/soy￾bean double cropping. In temperate and subtropical environments, warming is 
shortening the season of crops, leading to yield reduction in the absence of 
adaptive practices. Increasing the frequency and incidence of heat waves may 
reduce both the yield and quality of crops. Thus, the outcomes of warming are 
complex and varied, particularly when warming interacts with changes in 
rainfall, but a good deal of crop responses to warming is related to phenologi￾cal changes.
Another interesting consequence of warming is the decoupling of pro￾cesses, from ecosystems to molecules. In the last fve decades, the productiv￾ity of Northern Sea fsheries has declined. The main reason is that warming 
has “decoupled” the phenology of the components of the trophic web. This 
means that for example, predators and prey that were phenologically

11.2.1 Effects of Daily Mean Temperature
Figure 11.1 shows the relationship between the daily rate of phenological develop￾ment (R, day−1
) and daily mean temperature (T, °C). The daily rate of development 
is the inverse of the duration of the phenophase (D, day); for example, if it takes 10 
days to complete the phase sowing-emergence, the daily rate of development is 0.1 
day−1
. The rate of development increases linearly with temperature between the 
base (Tb) and the optimum temperature (To) and decreases between the optimum and 
maximum temperature (Tm) for development. These three parameters Tb, To, and Tm
constitute the “cardinal” temperatures for development, which vary with the plant 
species (and in some cases between varieties) and phenological phase.
The daily rate of development is zero (i.e., the plant does not develop) if the 
mean temperature is below Tb or above Tm. The concept of “thermal time” (also 
called degree days or heat units) is useful to predict the duration of a phase for dif￾ferent temperatures. Thermal time (TT, °Cd) is defned as the sum of daily mean 
temperature (Ti, °C), above the base temperature, from the beginning to the end of 
the phase; for example for the phase sowing-emergence:
synchronized before are now out of phase, with direct consequences for the 
structure and function of the whole ecosystem. In red grapevine varieties, 
warming is decoupling sugars and anthocyanins. This means that fruit reaches 
sugar maturity with less pigmentation; growers have therefore two choices. 
They can wait longer to harvest, hence allowing color to develop; this leads to 
undesirably high sugar and alcohol concentrations. Alternatively, they can 
harvest at the right sugar level and deal with the lack of color in the winery. 
The process of decoupling is therefore an agronomically important aspect of 
warming, which is related to developmental and growth processes.

As the response is linear, we can use the average temperature during the period 
(Tavg):
TT = − ∑ ( ) T T i b = − D T( ) avg Tb
sowing
emergence
(11.2)
So the daily rate of development when the daily mean temperature is between Tb
and To is
R D = = 1/ ( ) T T avg − b / TT (11.3)
The duration of a phase can thus be calculated if we know the daily mean tem￾perature, the base temperature, and the thermal time required to complete the phase:
D T = T T Tb /( ) avg − (11.4)
Table 16.1 in Chap. 16 shows Tb and TT for the phase sowing-emergence for 
several crops. With an adequate supply of water and oxygen, the thermal time 
required to complete the phase is approximately constant. Thus, we can predict that 
wheat will take approximately 11 days to emerge at a mean temperature of 10°C 
[D = 110/(10–0)] and 7 days if the mean temperature is 15°C [D = 110/(15–0)].
Base temperatures have physiological and ecological meaning, as they refect 
differences between species and stages and contribute to the coupling of organisms 
in trophic webs. For example, the base temperature for the sowing-emergence phase 
is much lower for winter crops than for spring-sown crops (Table 16.1). Base tem￾peratures normally decline from early to late stages in summer crops, e.g., for sun￾fower and soybean, and increase from early to late stages in winter crops such as 
wheat. The thermal time model applies not only to plants but also to other organisms 
including insects, which are—like plants—unable to regulate body temperature. 
The base temperature for the emergence of bollworms after overwintering in the soil 
is very close to the base temperature for the sowing-emergence phase of cotton; this 
coincidence of base temperatures ensures that a new generation of bollworms 
emerges in synchrony with a suitable food source.
The thermal time model (Eq. 11.2) is a simplifcation of a more complex response 
of development to temperature, as it rests on the assumption of a linear relationship 
between the rate of development and temperature. However, above the optimum 
temperature, the rate of development declines with increasing temperature, until a 
maximum temperature (Tm) is reached (Fig. 11.1). For some phenostages, particu￾larly those related to reproduction, development is also responsive to vernalization 
and photoperiod. In these cases, the thermal time required to complete the phase is 
not constant but is infuenced by low temperatures and day length.
V. O. Sadras et al.151
11.2.2 Vernalization and Photoperiod
Annual crops have specifc windows of development when grain number, the main 
yield component, is most affected by environmental stresses such as frost, heat, and 
water stress (Fig. 11.2). These windows vary but are more or less centered on fow￾ering in most crops. For this reason, mechanisms have evolved that reduce the prob￾ability of coincidence of extreme stress and the most sensitive developmental stages. 
These mechanisms are based on two environmental cues: vernalization and photo￾period. Flowering time is indeed one of the most important traits for crop adaptation 
to particular environments in agricultural systems. Consider, for example, wheat in 
a Mediterranean region. If it fowers too early, a signifcant frost risk would reduce 
seed production in some seasons. If it fowers too late, frost risk is reduced at the 
expense of increased risk of heat and water stress. Early wheat varieties introduced 
to Australia reached fowering at 125 days after sowing, hence exposing the sensi￾tive reproductive window to a high frequency of heat and water stress. Recognizing 
this problem, breeders selected for shorter-season varieties, which were better 
adapted to their environments. When compared under the same conditions, the time 
from sowing to anthesis was 119 days for cultivars released earlier than 1950 and 
108 days for cultivars introduced later. Rain-fed sunfower in southern Spain grows 
on stored soil water that is depleted during the growing season. In these environ￾ments, hybrids with very long cycles may deplete soil water reserves during a long 
vegetative stage thus suffering a more severe water defcit during grain flling than 
short-cycle hybrids. To manipulate the timing of key phenological events, plant 
breeders make use of fundamental genetic understanding including the manipula￾tion of vernalization and photoperiod genes in selecting varieties adapted to 
Fig. 11.2 Critical period for grain number determination, the main yield component of annual 
crops. Grain number is presented in an arbitrary scale where the vertical line represents 100%, of 
the grain number in unstressed controls. Deviations from this line represent reductions due to 
stress in different periods of the crop cycle. (Source: Calviño and Monzon (2014) in Sadras

11 Crop Development and Growth152
particular environments. To manipulate the timing of key phenological events, 
growers combine two practices: cultivar selection and sowing date.
Vernalization is a response to low temperatures necessary for some plants to 
become competent for the transition to the reproductive phase (Box 11.3). The plant 
apex may sense vernalizing temperatures since seed imbibition, throughout the veg￾etative phase. Vernalization requirements are characteristic of temperate crops such 
as wheat, barley, Brassica spp., and feld pea. In many of these species, “winter” 
types require vernalization, whereas “spring” types have little or no vernalization 
requirements. For instance, for winter wheat, temperatures between 0 and 8°C are 
the most effective, although vernalization happens with temperatures up to 
15°C. Vernalization may be reversed by high temperatures (usually >20°C), in a 
process known as “devernalization.” In some species, vernalization combines with 
photoperiod to modulate the time of fowering.
Vernalization is also important in horticultural crops. In biennial plants such as 
sugar beet and carrot, vernalization modulates the development of fower buds in the 
second year of growth. In proteranthous perennials (i.e., those that fower before 
leafng) vernalization modulates fowering time. In horticulture, the vernalization 
requirement is also known as “chilling hours,” which is the time below a species￾specifc base temperature. Understanding vernalization requirements is important to 
determine the geographical limits and risks of growing particular crops. Apple trees, 
for example, have a high vernalization requirement, hence they cannot be grown 
successfully in warm-winter environments where these requirements are not met. 
Almond trees have a relatively low vernalization requirement, and this implies the 
risk of early fowering with subsequent yield losses due to frost. Breeders have 
selected horticultural perennials with a broad range of vernalization requirements to 
extend their cropping areas and reduce risks of crop failure. Agronomists have 
developed technologies to partially compensate for insuffcient chilling. For exam￾ple, farmers in warm locations with a high risk of suboptimal chilling in South￾Eastern Australia, spray winter oil in pistachio orchards to support commercially 
viable yield (Fig. 11.3).

Virtually in all plant species, photoperiod-sensitive genotypes can be found, or 
rather, genotypes sensitive to the duration of the night. Gardner and Allard classifed 
annual species into two categories: long-day plants and short-day plants. The short￾day plants accelerate their development (shorten the time to fowering) when the 
days are short, while long-day plants develop faster if the days are long.
Small grains (wheat, barley, oats, and rye) are long-day species, while maize, 
rice, sorghum, and soybeans are short-day species. However, within each species, 
there is often great variability in sensitivity to photoperiod. In general, photoperiod 
response is quantitative, i.e. development rate increases or decreases with the pho￾toperiod but never becomes zero, which would be a qualitative response. By manip￾ulating photoperiod genes in soybean, varieties have been developed that can be 
grown between high latitudes in the northern hemisphere to the tropics; a classifca￾tion system of maturity types, with 00 the shortest (90 days) and VIII the longest 
season (190 days) shows the wide range of phenological patterns in soybean.
11.2.3 Soil Water Content
Figure 11.4 presents two contrasting examples of the infuence of soil moisture on 
plant phenological development. In a collection of seven sorghum lines, the effect 
of drought on time to panicle initiation ranged from insignifcant in fast-developing 
lines to 19 days delay in their slow-developing counterparts (Fig. 11.4a). In a col￾lection of 20 chickpea lines grown in eight environments, water defcit accelerated 
fowering (Fig. 11.4b). The effect depended on genotype, with a larger response to 
soil water in slow-developing types. The mechanisms of these responses are largely 
unknown and attempts to include soil moisture in models of crop phenology are 
incipient.

11 Crop Development and Growth154
11.3 Morphological Development
The architecture of the plant is under genetic control and is modulated by environ￾mental factors including temperature, photoperiod, and light quality. Agronomically, 
the architecture of the crop is important because it infuences traits such as lodging, 
harvestability, competition with weeds, responses to herbivory, and distribution of 
light and chemicals in the canopy profle. The node where the frst pod is set is an 
important trait of grain legumes, as genotypes with pods too close to the ground 
cannot be harvested effectively. The introduction of semi-dwarf genes in rice and 
wheat has led to signifcant improvements in crop production, and part of the suc￾cess of these semi-dwarf crops is related to their improved architecture, which 
allows for higher nutrient inputs with reduced lodging risk. Shorter phenotypes with 
more erect canopies are less competitive and therefore more reliant on effective 
weed control; Chap. 12 further develops the relations between competitive ability 
and crop yield.
Plants have numerous meristems (buds) that can follow one of three fates: they 
can remain dormant, they can activate to produce vegetative structures, or they can 
become reproductive structures. Different species combine different meristem allo￾cation strategies, which involve trade-offs. For example, the adaptation of grasses to 
browsing and their exploitation in agriculture is directly related to their under￾ground, dormant meristems that allow re-growth after grazing. Plants with profuse 
branching or tillering are more able to fll gaps originating, for example, from 
failures in sowing or damage by pests or diseases. As an example of trade-off, 
strong apical dominance, whereby most lateral buds are dormant, favors growth in 
height, competition for light, and capacity to recover after herbivory, at the expense 
of limited capacity for growth and reproduction, and constraints to expand into 
neighboring gaps.
Box 11.3: Lysenko and Vernalization
Trofm Lysenko (1898–1978) was a Ukrainian agronomist very infuential in 
the Soviet Union frst and later in China. He coined the term “vernalization” 
as the conversion of winter to spring crop types by applying cold to seeds 
before sowing. His success within the ranks of the soviet elite led him to be 
the main controller of agricultural science in the Soviet Union for almost 40 
years. He contributed to the destruction of genetics as a discipline in the 
USSR (including the death of many good scientists) and to the propagation of 
pseudoscientifc ideas about heredity, negating the existence of genes. His 
ideas were close to Lamarckism as they would ft Marxism theory better.
V. O. Sadras et al.155
Interactions between neighboring plants infuence the morphology of individual 
plants and the fnal architecture of the crop. Some of these interactions are mediated 
by the ability of plants to sense changes in the quantity, quality, and direction of 
light, which in turn triggers developmental responses called photomorphogenesis. 
The main groups of photoreceptors involved in plant photomorphogenesis are the 
red (R)/far-red (FR) light-absorbing phytochromes and the blue/UV-A light￾absorbing cryptochromes and phototropins. As the green tissue of plants differen￾tially refects and absorbs light of different wavelengths, plants can detect the 
presence of neighbors by detecting changes in the spectral composition of light, and 
in particular, reductions in the R/FR ratio. Typically, a shade-avoidant plant responds 
to neighbors by extending internodes, increasing stem:leaf ratio, reducing activation 
of lateral buds, producing more erect shoots, and in some cases advancing the time 
of fowering. In some weeds, germination can be triggered by changes in the R/FR
ratio associated with soil cultivation. Light signals interacting with the central cir￾cadian oscillator enable plants to monitor photoperiod and adjust the timing of the 
transition from vegetative to reproductive development (Sect. 11.2.2). It has recently 
been discovered that the light receptor phytochrome B (phyB) is also a temperature 
sensor involved in morphological and developmental responses to temperature 
called thermomorphogenesis. Common sensors and common metabolic pathways 
are incipient elements for the integration of plant responses to temperature and 
light.
The successive appearance of plant leaves is an important component of morpho￾logical development. In general, the thermal time between the appearance of two 
consecutive leaves, known as phyllochron, is constant. For example, wheat has a 
phyllochron around 100°C d with a base temperature of 0°C. In sunfowers, the 
phyllochron is around 20°C d with a base temperature of 4°C.
11.4 Growth
Box 11.4 outlines the methods used to quantify crop growth. Crop growth depends 
on the capacity of the canopy to capture CO2 and radiation, the capacity of the root 
system to capture water and nutrients from the soil, and the effciency of the crop to 
transform resources (water, nutrients, radiation, carbon dioxide) into biomass 
(Fig. 11.5). Some environmental factors, such as ambient temperature or soil salin￾ity modulate the rate of capture of resources and the effciency in the transformation 
of resources in plant biomass. Other chapters deal in detail with the capture and 
effciency in the use of radiation (Chap. 13), water (Chap. 14), and nutrients (Chaps. 
26, 27, and 28).
The capture and effciency in the use of resources changes with the stage of phe￾nological development. The growth of a typical annual crop is characterized by a 
sigmoid curve (Fig. 11.6) with three phases. First, in a lag phase, plants grow slowly, 
as they mostly depend on seed reserves, whereas small root and canopy systems

constrain their capacity to capture resources. Many practices (e.g., sowing date, 
fertilizer) seek to reduce the duration of this lag phase, also known as “period lost 
to growth.” Second, the growth increases rapidly to reach a linear phase when a suf￾fciently large canopy and root system allow for a high capacity to capture resources. 
Third, crop growth slows down as both canopy and root systems age, entering a 
senescence phase in parallel to the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen in repro￾ductive organs. The senescence of leaves and roots is genetically driven by a process 
known as monocarpic senescence, whereas stresses such as shortage of water or 
nutrients may accelerate the process.
Figure 11.7 illustrates the relationship between crop growth and the capture of 
resources in crops with favorable and stressful conditions. As the season progresses, 
and roots and canopies expand, the crop captures more soil and above-ground 
resources. A straight line represents increasing growth with increasing resource 
capture. Stresses such as defcit of nutrients or soil compaction reduce growth 
through two processes: reducing the amount of resources captured by the crop 
(horizontal arrow in Fig.  11.7) reducing the effciency in the use of resources. 
The vertical arrow in Fig. 11.7 indicates the reduction in growth for the same amount 
of resource captured; this means lower effciency.
In general, shortage of resources (water or nutrient defcits) and soil constraints 
(compaction, salinity) reduce crop growth by reducing frst the capture of resources, 
while the effciency in the use of resources is affected later, as the constraints 
become more severe.
Ambient temperature infuences growth directly, by changing the rate of pro￾cesses such as cell division, leaf expansion, and crop photosynthesis, and indirectly 
by affecting phenological development and the duration of key phenophases, as

discussed before. Within agronomically sensible ranges, the main effect of tempera￾ture on crop production is related to the modulation of phenological development. 
In temperate environments, late sowing shifts the crop cycle to warmer conditions, 
development proceeds faster, the period available to capture resources and growth is 
reduced, and biomass at maturity is normally lower. Figure 11.8 illustrates the inter￾play between development and growth in faba bean crops sown between October 
(autumn) and early May (spring) in Lugo, Spain. As the sowing is delayed, both 
temperature and photoperiod increase. This shortens the phenophases of the crop, 
resulting in a reduction of the crop cycle from 209 to 87 days. With shorter cycle 
duration, the peak leaf area is reduced, the amount of radiation captured by the crop 
is reduced, and the fnal production of biomass is also reduced. Hence, the effects of 
temperature and photoperiod on development (cycle length) have a dominant role in 
seasonal growth. Of interest, the frst sowing date does not conform to this pattern. 
For the earliest sowing, the crop has the longest cycle duration and the highest cap￾ture of radiation as expected; therefore, it should also have the highest biomass. 
However, it has the lowest biomass. The explanation is that the extremely low 
temperature in the earliest sowing reduced the photosynthetic effciency of the crop. 
In this case, the physiological response (photosynthesis) was stronger than the 
developmental response.

Appendix
Box 11.4: Quantifcation of Crop Growth
Depending on the objectives of measurements, we could be interested in 
describing growth in terms of crop height, leaf surface area, fruit volume, or 
grain mass. As crop growth depends on the capture of resources, and this is in 
turn related to the size of the canopy and root system, we often use the leaf 
area index (LAI, m2
 leaf/m2
 ground) to measure the size of the canopy and the 
rooting depth and density characterized as Root Length Density (Lv, m root/
m3
 soil) to quantify the size of the root system. LAI is the ratio of leaf area 
(assuming single-sided leaves) and ground area and Lv is the length of roots 
per unit of soil volume. For many agronomic applications, shoot mass is mea￾sured by taking crop samples (e.g., 1 m2
 of crop cut to ground level), which 
are dried to constant weight to express the dry matter in g/m2
 or kg/ha; this 
measure of dry matter is also called biomass. Periodic sampling of biomass 
combined with periodic measurements of radiation interception, nutrient 
uptake, and evapotranspiration allows for calculating the effciency in the use 
of radiation, nutrients, and water as illustrated in Fig. 11.7.
Indirect methods are also used for quantifying biomass or LAI. For trees, 
empirical relationships between biomass and trunk diameter have been widely 
used. Transmittance of PAR or refectance of radiation in different wave￾lengths (e.g., red and far red) (see Chap. 3) may be related to LAI and is the 
base of most indirect methods for non-destructive measurement of LAI.

12 Plant Population Density 
and Competition
Francisco J. Villalobos , Victor O. Sadras, and Elias Fereres
Abstract
Crops respond to plant population density modifying the characteristics of indi￾vidual plants by changing the number and size of their organs. The yield response 
to density can be described mathematically by the “Law of Reciprocal Yield.” 
Mortality of individuals occurs when density is very high. The effect is more 
pronounced when environmental conditions are suitable (e.g., high fertility). 
Yield–density curves can be asymptotic or parabolic, although the latter may 
refect the existence of an additional limiting factor (e.g., water or nutrients). In 
general, the spatial variability in plant population density leads to yield losses 
that are higher when the yield–density response is a parabolic curve.
12.1 Introduction
Plant population dynamics studies the temporal variation in the number of individu￾als and their attributes. These aspects are important to understand the productivity 
of crops, especially to evaluate the effect of plant population density on yield. 
Population dynamics also helps us understand intra-specifc competition, e.g., 
between neighboring wheat plants in a crop (Box 12.1), and inter-specifc competi￾tion, e.g. between weed and crop plants. These processes are critical for the estab￾lishment and productivity of annual crops and for pasture longevity.

12.2 Density and Competition
A crop is a plant population with individuals of the same genotype and similar age. 
The availability of resources changes in time and space and may limit crop growth 
and cause competition between neighboring plants. Unlike animals, higher plants 
show great plasticity in their growth and in their form, in response to the stress 
imposed by competition. Thus, the structure of individual plants is set to respond to 
competition stress by varying the rate of formation, growth, or mortality of their 
organs (leaves, branches, stems, fruits, roots, etc.). The response may involve 
changes in the size of the individuals, their shape or the number of individuals.
The growth rate of a plant population is proportional to density in the early stages 
of development. This proportionality is later reduced as the competition for resources 
among plants increases which leads to a phase when crop growth rate is indepen￾dent of the density. The higher the initial density, the sooner the competition for 
resources begins. Variations in initial density are thus largely offset by variations in 
the growth rates of individual plants. This has been verifed for many species and 
has been called the “law of constant fnal yield.” This is true above a minimum plant 
population so there is enough opportunity to exploit all the resources. In other 
words, in its early stages of growth from seed, before competition, the crop biomass 
depends on the number of plants present. Later, the supply of resources starts to 
control the growth rate of individuals, until fnally it becomes the limiting factor of 
productivity, regardless of the density. The population behaves as an integrated sys￾tem in which the behavior of the individual plant is subordinated to the population’s 
behavior.
Any factor that reduces the growth rate of plants results in a delayed onset of 
competition and a reduction in its intensity. The relationship between yield per plant 
and density is often expressed by the following equation, called “reciprocal 
yield law”:
W
b b Dp
= +
1
1 2
(12.1)
where W is the dry mass per plant (g), Dp is the plant population density (plants 
m−2
), and b1 and b2 are empirical coeffcients. Crop biomass (B, g m−2
) is the product 
of mass per plant and plant population density, and yield (Y) is the product of bio￾mass and Harvest Index (Chap. 13) so:
Y
HI D
b b D
p
p
= ⋅
1 2 +
(12.2)
The coeffcient b2 represents the inverse of the crop biomass (B) when the density 
is very high. If Dp tends to very large values in Eq. 12.2, B ≈ b2
−1
The coeffcient b1 represents the inverse of W when competition is absent, i.e. for 
very low density. If Dp is zero in Eq. 12.1, W = b1
−1

12.3 Variability Between Plants and Hierarchy
The frequency distribution of weight per plant in a population under density stress 
is skewed, i.e. asymmetrical. The bias increases with both time and population den￾sity, as illustrated in Fig. 12.1 for sunfower. In a population in competition, we thus 
fnd a large number of small individuals (low biomass per plant) and fewer large 
individuals. The place of an individual in the hierarchy of the population is deter￾mined primarily in the early stages of development. It has been shown experimen￾tally that the amount of biomass produced by an individual in a population under

12 Plant Population Density and Competition168
competition is very closely related to the relative order of its appearance (emer￾gence) in the population. The advantage of an early appearance must be related to 
the increased use of resources and the corresponding deprivation of resources for 
plants that appear later. This implies that a likely source of variability of plant mass 
in the feld is variability in time to emergence, which in turn depends on the varia￾tion of soil properties (water content, thermal properties, and compaction) and the 
sowing depth and method.
In addition to the heterogeneity of seedling emergence, herbivory, diseases, and 
other sources of damage (e.g., hail) are agronomically important sources of crop 
heterogeneity. For example, insects feeding on the growing meristem of cotton slow 
down plant growth, as it takes time for activation of axillary buds that would re￾initiate growth. This hiatus in the growth of the damaged plant may favor the growth 
of undamaged neighbor plants.
Insects, diseases, or other agents that kill seedlings cause “gaps” in the crop. In 
the absence of compensatory capacity (when plant loss occurs very late or when it 
originates large gaps) yield would be reduced in proportion to the reduction of the 
plant stand. The relationship between yield and stand loss, however, demonstrates a 
compensatory mechanism which relates to the “relaxation” of competition and 
depends on the spatial distribution of plant loss and the time when it occurs 
(Fig. 12.2). In conclusion, crop heterogeneity often but not always reduces yield; 
the impact of heterogeneity depends on the size of the hierarchy or gap, their spatial

12.4 Plant Population Density and Mortality
High plant population density tends to increase the risk of death of the individuals 
in the population although there are some examples of the opposite effect. The risk 
of mortality that increases with the density has regulatory properties, acting as nega￾tive feedback on the size of the population. Various studies on “self-elimination” 
(density stress-induced mortality) have shown that it occurs at high but not at low 
density, starts sooner with higher density, and depends on environmental conditions.
In the years 1920–1930, Suskatschew studied the dynamics of self-elimination in 
populations of spruce near Saint Petersburg (Russia), fnding that fnal plant density 
was higher in poor and shallow soils. In deeper soils, he found lower densities of 
larger trees. This author then experimented with an annual plant (Matricaria ino￾dora) using two levels of fertility and two densities, checking that mortality was 
higher with the highest density and that the risk of death increased with higher fer￾tility. This corroborated his observations in spruce forests. Fertilization increased 
the growth rate of individuals thereby increasing the density stress and thus the 
mortality rate.
12.5 Mechanisms of Plant–Plant Competition
The density of plants in a crop determines the occurrence of numerous processes of 
interference between individual plants. As plant density is varied, the environment 
of each plant is altered in terms of light intensity and quality and availability of 
resources (water, nutrients).
As plant density is higher, intercepted radiation and the availability of water and 
nutrients are reduced for each individual, which limits their ability to grow. Light 
quality is changed fundamentally in the relationship between red (670 nm) and far 
red radiation (760 nm) (ratio R:FR). On average, sunlight has a ratio R:FR of 1.15. 
As red is absorbed by pigments, light transmitted or refected by vegetation has a 
lower R:FR. For example, R:FR below crops may range from 0.1 to 0.5. As the 
density increases the ratio R:FR is reduced, and this reduction is detected by phyto￾chromes, inducing morphological changes in many species (increased height 
growth, reduction in the formation of side branches or stems).
The main responses to increased plant population density are:
– Reduced yield per plant from the combination of the responses outlined below.
– Reduced expansive growth and mass per plant. Plant leaf area and thus radiation 
interception per plant are reduced.
12 Plant Population Density and Competition170
– Change in the distribution of dry matter among vegetative plant organs: increased 
allocation to stem and reduced allocation to leaves (Fig. 12.3). In general, height 
increases while stem diameter decreases, which leads to a notable increase in its 
slenderness ratio and therefore a higher risk of lodging in adverse situations (for 
instance, strong winds).
– Change in the partition between reproductive and vegetative organs, which 
results in higher or lower Harvest Index depending on the species (see Chap. 13): 
In sunfowers, for very low density, biomass per plant may be very large while 
seed growth is limited by the number of seeds and potential seed growth rate, 
implying a fall in the HI. In other cases (e.g., maize), very high densities increase 
the percentage of sterile plants (Box 12.1).
– Reduction of the number of seeds per plant and/or mass of single seeds.
– Depressed branching in dicots (e.g., soybean) and tillering in cereals.
– Accelerated leaf senescence: In plants under high density, leaf senescence starts 
sooner and the rate of senescence is higher, which seems to occur in response to 
both shade and changes in light quality.
– Altered distribution of plants and plant parts. For instance, leaf orientation in 
maize plants responds to FR-simulating neighbors. Isolated maize plants were 
grown in the feld with a selective mirror originating low R:FR, placed 15 cm 
toward the north. As a result, 70% of the leaves pointed E or W, while only 20% 
pointed N or S (Maddonni et al. 2002. Plant Physiol. 130:1181–1189). Whole 
plants of sunfower can also change orientation in response to high density 
(Fig. 12.4).
– Changed crop quality: In some cases, quality may improve with high density 
(e.g., percentage of oil in sunfower seed) and in other cases, it may decline (e.g., 
sunfower seed size for direct consumption). In general, the size of harvestable 
organs (grains, tubers, bulbs, etc.) is reduced as density increases.

Box 12.1: Crop Yield Associates with Low Competitive Ability
The defnition of crop yield evolves. For most of the history of agriculture, 
yield has been measured as the ratio of seed harvested to seed sown; for exam￾ple, the average low grain yield in Europe in the 1770s was between four and 
seven seeds per seed. This defnition of yield favored competitive, tall plants 
with profuse branching. With increasing competition for the available land, 
the defnition of yield shifted from seeds per seed to the contemporary mea￾sure of mass of seed per unit land area. The selective pressure thus shifted to 
favor a “communal,” less competitive phenotype frst outlined by Colin 
Donald (Fig. 12.5).
Decades of selection for yield and agronomic adaptation in Australian 
wheat have shifted key traits from a low-yielding, more competitive pheno￾type (Fig. 12.5 left) to a high-yielding, less competitive phenotype (Fig. 12.5
right). The less competitive is shorter and intercepts less radiation per plant, 
which is compensated by a higher radiation use effciency. The latter is not 
explained by photosynthesis or respiration at the leaf level but relates to an 
erectophile canopy that favors more radiation and higher nitrogen concentra￾tion in leaves at the bottom of the canopy (better distribution of radiation 
throughout the canopy). The less competitive phenotype has a smaller root 
system with a compensatory higher N uptake per unit root length.
Maize is particularly sensitive to plant–plant competition that could lead to 
barrenness. Selection for yield over decades has favored phenotypes with 
lower competitive ability, allowing for higher plant population density 
(Fig. 12.6). A negative correlation between crop yield (kg/ha) and plant com￾petitive ability has been demonstrated experimentally in species of contrast￾ing physiology and morphology, including cereals, pulses, and oilseed crops. 
This is the main reason why selection for yield of isolated plants rarely trans￾lates to crop yield per unit area.

12.6 Yield and Plant Population Density
Throughout the twentieth century, great attention was paid to the relationships 
between plant density and crop yield. These relationships are important to deter￾mine the optimum density in practice, and for the selection of phenotypes adapted 
to high density stands (Box 12.1).

Fig. 12.7 Generic 
parabolic and asymptotic 
response curves of yield 
versus density
Two types of relationships between yield and density are usually found: asymp￾totic and parabolic (Fig. 12.7). In the frst type, yield increases with density, reaches 
a plateau, and does not decrease for very high densities. This case is also found 
when we plot biomass versus density. In the parabolic case, yield reaches a maxi￾mum at a given density and decreases for densities above or below.
The biomass production of any crop follows an asymptotic relationship with 
density. This is the response predicted by the Reciprocal Yield Law (Eq. 12.2). In 
crops harvested for their seed it used to be common to observe a decrease in yield 
for high densities (parabolic response), which implies that the HI is reduced. This 
was due to a direct effect of density (e.g. barrenness in maize) or as a result, of 
another limitation of resources such as water or nutrients. Thus, in situations of 
water defcit, the highest densities are at increased risk of not having suffcient water 
during grain flling. Evidence that a parabolic curve is the product of a limitation 
other than density may come from the observation that the density for maximum 
yield increases with increasing water or nutrient availability (Fig. 12.8). Additionally, 
within a species we can fnd various yield–density curves for the different cultivars, 
especially if they differ in cycle length. Very short cycles produce less biomass and 
yield at low densities. The maximum yield is achieved at a higher density if the 
cycle is shorter. A long cycle can fully exploit the available resources with low den￾sities. It compensates for the low plant density with a longer vegetative period, 
which implies a higher growth potential for single plants. This is illustrated in 
Fig. 12.9 for two sunfower cultivars in Cordoba, Spain. In winter cereals, plant 
breeders have incorporated substantial plasticity in the response to density, and 
yields are the same over a wide range of densities as long as resources are not limit￾ing (fully irrigated and fertilized conditions). Even in maize, modern varieties are 
quite resistant to barrenness and yields do not decline until very high densities are 
achieved (>150,000 plants/ha)

 and 1600 g m−2

The yield–density relationships obtained experimentally should be used with 
caution because they depend on the limitations of water and nutrients and the culti￾var considered. In any case, we should ensure a minimum planting density that 
should be increased for short growing cycles. Furthermore, if water or nutrients are 
scarce, we must avoid high densities that could reduce the harvestable fraction of 
biomass and therefore yield. The high density may cause other undesirable effects 
such as the increased risk of crop lodging by wind, which may decrease yield 
dramatically.
Parabolic responses to density are also observed for some horticultural crops 
where the product price is closely related to the size of the harvestable organ (e.g., 
garlic, onion, carrot). High densities lead to smaller and therefore lower selling 
prices, leading to yield–density curves of parabolic type when we express the yield 
in income/ha.
The relationship between density and yield mentioned above is obtained in 
experimental plots in which the crop density is uniform across the plot. However, in 
commercial plots, plants are not distributed evenly across the feld. There is a spatial 
variability in density so there are areas where the density is high and areas where it 
is low. This may be due to variability in soil conditions (compaction, initial water), 
the presence of pests and soil diseases, or poor seed distribution at sowing.
In general, we may expect that the larger the variability in the density of plants 
the larger the decrease in yield. However, it depends strongly on the size of the gaps 
and the possibility of compensation, as indicated in 12.3. The negative effect of vari￾ability should be more pronounced when the response is parabolic as both lower and 
higher densities reduce yield below the optimum. In this case, if we cannot avoid a 
very high variability (soil or machinery problems, for example) we may reduce 
planting density below the theoretical optimum.

Abstract
Photosynthesis is the set of processes whereby radiant energy is converted and 
stored as chemical energy in most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. This process 
depends on radiation, temperature, and ambient CO2 concentration. The maxi￾mum effciency of the process is 6% but it is usually well below. The leaf-level 
photosynthesis can be described mathematically, and this analysis can be 
extended to the calculation of crop photosynthesis, as a function of leaf area 
index, and the coeffcient of extinction as a shortcut to represent canopy architec￾ture, and leaf photosynthetic parameters.
The respiration of the crop can be decomposed into a maintenance component 
that is dependent on biomass and temperature, and a growth component that is 
proportional to gross photosynthesis.
Crop yield can be expressed as the product of three factors, the amount of 
intercepted radiation, radiation-use effciency (RUE), and harvest index (HI). 
Radiation interception depends on incident radiation, leaf area index, and the 
extinction coeffcient. RUE is smaller for C3 than C4 crops and is smaller in 
crops with oil- and protein-rich seed in comparison to cereals. The HI depends 
on the species and its use. The main cause of genetic yield improvements in the

past has been the increase in HI, which has been a remarkable success in the case 
of cereals; maize is the main exception to this trend. In some cases, such as high￾yielding wheat in northern Europe, HI is reaching a biophysical limit hence fur￾ther improvements in yield would require increasing RUE and biomass 
production.
13.1 Introduction
The input of energy to ecosystems is based on the process of photosynthesis by 
which sunlight is converted into chemical energy. Photosynthesis is the primary 
process of producing carbon compounds necessary for the construction and mainte￾nance of crop biomass. Here, the focus is on leaf-level photosynthesis with a brief 
scaling-up exercise to crop-level photosynthesis, which links with crop traits devel￾oped in Chap. 3. When we measure the rate of CO2 exchange of a single leaf, this 
rate is the net photosynthesis (Pn), which results from the total or gross photosyn￾thesis (Pg) minus respiration (R). We use a convention that fuxes from air to leaf are 
positive, whereas fuxes from leaf to air are negative. Emphasis is placed on how 
radiation, CO2, and temperature modulate leaf photosynthesis. Other factors affect￾ing photosynthesis, such as plant water status and nitrogen nutrition are discussed 
in other chapters.
In the second part of this chapter, we discuss the relation between biomass pro￾duction and the amount of radiation absorbed by photosynthetically active tissues, 
i.e. the effciency in the use of radiation for biomass production. Absorbed radiation 
is closely related to intercepted radiation, i.e. the difference between incoming radi￾ation and that reaching the soil surface (Chap. 3). Radiation-use effciency varies 
between crop types with both photosynthetic metabolism (C4-C3) and seed compo￾sition (cereals, legumes, and oilseed crops); there is also moderate variation among 
cultivars that can be exploited in plant breeding. Plant age, source–sink ratio, dry 
matter, and nitrogen allocation also affect crop radiation-use effciency. Nitrogen, 
water, and temperature are major environmental factors with effects on both radia￾tion interception and radiation-use effciency.
13.2 Leaf-Level Photosynthesis
Most (85–90%) of the dry matter accumulated in a crop derives from photosynthe￾sis, which can be decomposed into the following three processes:
(a) Diffusion of CO2 from the atmosphere to the chloroplasts, following the con￾centration gradient:
P g n s = − c a ( ) C Ci (13.1)
V. O. Sadras et al.179
where Pn (μmol m−2
 s−1
) is the net fux of CO2 entering the leaf, gsc is the stoma￾tal conductance for CO2 (mol m−2
 s−1
), and Ca and Ci are the concentrations 
(μmol mol−1
) of CO2 in the air surrounding the leaf and in the substomatal cav￾ity, respectively.
(b) Absorption of radiation by the photosynthetic pigments and photolysis of water. 
The amount of radiation absorbed depends on the concentration of pigments, 
mostly chlorophylls, present in the chloroplasts. In this stage, O2 is released and 
energy compounds (ATP and NADPH) are generated. This process does not 
depend on temperature or CO2 concentration.
(c) Reduction of CO2 using the compounds generated in the photolysis of water. 
Between 8 and 12 light quanta are required for each molecule of CO2 reduced. 
The reduction can occur in the dark and is very sensitive to temperature.
The components of photolysis of water and CO2 reduction may be calculated 
using the model of Farquhar:
P
a C
b C d n R c i
c i c
= d
( ) −
+ − Γ
(13.2)
Where ac, bc, and dc depend on the process (photolysis or CO2 reduction), tem￾perature (both processes), and absorbed radiation (photolysis), Γ is the compensa￾tion point, and Rd is the leaf respiration. Nevertheless, the coeffcient ac is 
proportional to the leaf N content as N is the main component of chlorophyll and 
photosynthetic enzymes (e.g., Rubisco). Actual photosynthesis will occur at the 
equilibrium of Equations 13.1 and 13.2.
In summary, the photosynthesis of a leaf of a healthy, well-watered, and well￾fertilized plant depends on irradiance, CO2 concentration, and temperature.
The energy effciency of photosynthesis, i.e. the ratio of energy stored in chemi￾cal form and incoming solar radiation, has a maximum value of around 6%, but 
actual effciency in agricultural species usually does not exceed 2–3%. We can cal￾culate the relative importance of photosynthesis in the energy balance equation 
(Chap. 7) as follows. Net radiation (Rn) above a crop is equivalent to 60–80% of 
solar radiation (Rs) depending mostly on cloud cover. On a clear day, we can assume 
Rn= 0.6 Rs so that the energy stored with 6% effciency represents 10% of net radia￾tion. However, the energy spent in photosynthesis also includes a fraction that is lost 
by respiration. If that fraction is one-third, then 15% of net radiation may be spent 
in photosynthesis. Therefore, the common assumption of neglecting energy use in 
photosynthesis may be wrong particularly when productivity is high (e.g., green￾house crops) and irradiance is low. The partitioning of net radiation to photosynthe￾sis may be even higher in protected cultivation with LED lights, as most of the 
radiation will be photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In this case, with almost 
nil turbulence and zero balance of longwave radiation, we can assume equilibrium 
evaporation so transpiration is proportional to solar radiation. We can expect an 
effciency of 20% over incoming PAR (including respiration) so around 25% of net 
radiation would be spent in photosynthesis (assuming an albedo of 0.2).

13.3 Plant Types According to Photosynthesis Mechanisms
Higher plants have developed three different photosynthetic systems (C3, C4, and 
CAM) that have distinct chemical and anatomical features. Terrestrial plants evolved 
from algae and initially were all C3. Subsequently, there has been a shift toward C4 
and CAM systems. Agricultural species and natural fora show mostly the C3 sys￾tem. Few but important cultivated species have the C4 system (maize, sorghum, 
millet, sugar cane, and some tropical grasses such as Paspalum spp), whereas the 
CAM system is rarer and less important in crops (agave, pineapple). C3 plants origi￾nate mostly in high to intermediate latitudes and high altitudes, whereas C4 are 
more typical of subtropical to tropical regions. C4 photosynthesis is a complex evo￾lutionary trait that resulted from a major reorganization of leaf anatomy and metab￾olism leading to a CO2-concentrating mechanism that counteracts the inhibitory 
effects of low atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis. The C4 pathway evolved inde￾pendently at least 66 times within the past 35 million years. The main features of the 
three systems are as follows:
(a) C3 plants: The frst compound formed in the process is phosphoglyceric acid (3 
C atoms) by the combination of ribulose diphosphate (5C) with CO2. The 
enzyme responsible is the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco). 
Although primarily serving for carboxylation, Rubisco can also act as an oxy￾genase. Thus, in the presence of light, O2 competes with CO2 at the enzyme 
active sites which leads to a loss of CO2 (photorespiration). In addition to its 
enzymatic role, the large amount of Rubisco in plants means it plays a major 
role as a reserve of reduced nitrogen. This is most evident during grain flling 
and senescence of annual crops, where a signifcant part of the nitrogen, stored 
as Rubisco, is transported and contributes to the protein content in grain.
(b) C4 plants: The frst compound formed in the process is oxaloacetic acid (4 car￾bons) by combining phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) with CO2. The enzyme 
responsible is the phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxylase. C4 plants have higher 
photosynthesis per unit of energy and per unit of water than their C3 counter￾parts and this contributes to their adaptation to dry environments.
(c) CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants: This system is predominant in 
the Crassulaceae family that includes numerous cactuses. CO2 fxation occurs 
during the night by the formation of PEP that is converted to organic acids that 
are stored in the vacuoles. During the day, malate enters the chloroplasts where 
PEP is regenerated. CAM plants behave as C3 if the water supply is adequate. 
In drought situations, CAM plants have reduced rates of water use as compared 
to C3 and C4 plants.
13.4 Effects of Environmental Factors on Photosynthesis
The main environmental factors affecting photosynthetic rate are solar radiation, 
temperature, and CO2 concentration. Diseases, water and nutrient defcits may limit 
strongly photosynthesis as discussed in Chaps. 14 and 15.

between leaf net 
photosynthesis and

plants
13.4.1 Radiation
The net photosynthesis of a leaf (Pn) responds to irradiance (I) as shown in Fig. 13.1. 
For I = 0, the leaf loses CO2 at a rate Rd (dark respiration). Assimilation is zero at the 
so-called light compensation point where gross photosynthesis is equal to the respi￾ration rate. With higher I, Pn grows rapidly to a maximum at which the system 
reaches light saturation. For many species, Pn is saturated well below the typical 
radiation of clear days, which is particularly true of most C3 plants. The maximum 
Pn varies greatly between the C3 and the C4 groups and also within each group. 
However, the initial slope of the relationship Pn = f (I) is relatively constant for all 
species.
If Rd is constant, gross assimilation is defned as Pg = Pn + Rd. The gross assimila￾tion rate increases with irradiance along a curve, which can be ftted to a hyperbola 
of the type:
P
I P
I P g
gx

(13.3)
where Pg is the rate of gross photosynthesis (μmol m−2
 s−1
), I is the irradiance (W 
m−2
), ε is the initial slope of the curve Pg = f (I), and Pgx is the asymptote of Pg when 
I tends to infnity. C3 plants have Pgx in the range 10–40 μmol m−2
 s−1
 while C4 show 
a range 18–55 μmol m−2
 s−1
. The initial slope of the curve is similar for C3 and C4 
species. When I is expressed as absorbed PAR (mol photons m−2
 s−1
), the initial 
slope is called quantum effciency of photosynthesis, which is a measure of the 
intrinsic effciency of the photosynthetic system. In the range 20–25°C, both C3 and 
C4 plants have quantum effciencies around 0.06 mol CO2 E−1
. For lower tempera￾tures, C3 plants perform better and for higher temperatures, the opposite occurs.
C3 plants reach their Pgx with much lower irradiance than C4 plants. Under opti￾mal conditions, C4 plants show higher Pgx than C3 plants, although the differences 
are attenuated as we scale up from leaf to plant community. Thus, the maximum 
biomass produced by C3 and C4 crops differs much less than the maximum rates of 
photosynthesis at the leaf level.
13 Radiation Interception, Radiation Use Efciency, and Crop Productivity182
The irradiance under which leaf growth occurs also affects its response to radia￾tion. When a leaf has grown in the shade, Pgx is lower than when it has grown under 
high radiation. This process of acclimation is due to the increased accumulation of 
proteins (photosynthetic enzymes) in the leaves under high irradiance.
13.4.2 Temperature
The maximum photosynthesis responds to temperature following a bell-shaped 
curve with a maximum between 15 and 25°C for C3 plants and between 25 and 
35°C for C4 plants (Fig. 13.2). Very few C4 species perform well under low tem￾peratures, whereas most of these species suffer irreversible damage with tempera￾tures between 10 and 12°C (chilling injury). Many C3 plants such as cotton and 
sunfower perform well with high temperatures (30–40°C) although some C3 are 
sensitive to low temperatures (e.g., banana). However, the leaves of most C3 plants 
can withstand temperatures down to 0°C.
13.4.3 Concentration of CO2 and Endogenous Factors
Photosynthesis increases as CO2 concentration increases because of the larger con￾centration gradient between the atmosphere and the leaf mesophyll (Eq. 13.1). The 
relation is hyperbolic (Eq. 13.2) for C3 plants. Leaves of C3 species lose CO2 (Pn is 
negative) for CO2 concentrations below 50–100 ppm. The concentration of CO2 for 
which Pn = 0 is called CO2 compensation point. C4 plants show little response to 
CO2 concentration above 200–400 ppm.
In addition to the environmental effects, the photosynthesis rate can be affected 
by the existence of sinks capable of accumulating carbohydrates. For example, sup￾pression of the tubers of potato plants leads to a decrease in the rate of leaf 
photosynthesis.

13.5 Respiration
Respiration (oxidation of carbohydrates and other compounds to produce energy) in 
plants can be decomposed into two main categories: growth respiration (Rg) which 
is proportional to gross photosynthesis and maintenance respiration (Rm), propor￾tional to crop biomass (B):
R R d g = + R a m g = + P b B (13.4)
Growth respiration is the energy cost involved in synthesizing plant tissues from 
glucose, which is the building block of plant tissues. For example, 1 g of glucose 
allows the building of approximately 0.65 g of leaves (or vegetative tissues in gen￾eral). The energy cost depends mainly on tissue composition: synthesis of fats and 
proteins involves a higher Rg than that of carbohydrates (see Sect. 13.12).
Maintenance respiration is the energy cost associated with maintaining the organiza￾tion and functioning of the crop tissues. The fundamental processes in which Rm is 
invested are protein turnover and keeping active ion transport mechanisms. For this rea￾son, N-defcient plants or older plants with lower nitrogen concentration have lower 
maintenance respiration per unit of dry matter as illustrated in Fig. 13.3. The Rm per unit 
biomass increases exponentially with temperature up to 40–50°C, depending on the spe￾cies. For higher temperatures, irreversible damage occurs. Indicative values of Rm at 
20°C range between 0.01 and 0.035 g glucose/g of dry matter/day.
13.6 Crop Photosynthesis
The response of photosynthesis of a crop to environmental conditions is in principle 
more complex than that of its leaves. A crop is a set of leaves of different ages and 
nitrogen concentrations, subjected to different radiation intensities that change

throughout the day. As will be seen later, crop photosynthesis is often linearly 
related to irradiance (or better, to intercepted radiation).
Considering the extinction of radiation within the canopy (Chap. 3) and the 
response of leaf assimilation to irradiance (Eq. 13.3), we can integrate assimilation 
for all the leaves and arrive at an equation for the rate of net photosynthesis of 
the crop:

where I0 is the incident radiation, k is the extinction coeffcient (see Chap. 3), L is

Example 13.1
Figure 13.4 shows the net photosynthesis of C3 crops with extinction coeff￾cients of 0.5 (vertical leaves) and 0.9 (horizontal leaves) as a function of 
LAI. The maximum crop photosynthesis occurs for LAI around 3 for horizon￾tal leaves and LAI close to 5 for vertical leaves. When LAI is low, horizontal 
leaves are more effcient for crop photosynthesis. Vertical leaves show a clear 
advantage for large LAI.

continous line) and 0.9 (horizontal leaves, dashed line) as a function of LAI

Figure 13.5 shows the net photosynthesis of C3 crops with LAI = 1 and LAI = 4 as 
a function of incoming radiation. The response is closer to linear than that shown 
by leaf assimilation to irradiance (Fig. 13.1). When irradiance is low, the crop with 
LAI = 1 assimilates more CO2 which is explained by the smaller respiration loss.
Fig. 13.5 Net photosynthesis of C3 crops with LAI = 1 and LAI = 4 as a function of incom￾ing radiation
Example 13.3
The effect of leaf photosynthetic capacity on canopy photosynthesis is shown 
in Fig. 13.6 for crops of different LAI. The range in maximum leaf gross pho￾tosynthesis goes from the low range in C3 species to the high range of C4. We 
have assumed that respiration is 10% of Pgx and solar radiation is 500 W m−2
. 
The importance of leaf photosynthetic capacity is reduced as the canopy 
grows. For very high LAI, crop photosynthesis is almost independent of Pgx. 
This may explain why breeding for high leaf Pgx has not been successful in 
enhancing biomass production at the canopy level.

13.7 Intercepted Radiation
We analyzed radiation interception by crops in Chap. 3. Actual interception depends 
on LAI, leaf angles, and the geometrical distribution of incoming radiation (sun 
angle, fraction of diffuse radiation). Models of radiation interception may be quite 
complex to include the actual 3D distribution of foliage elements in the canopy, 
which is required for tree orchards or forests.
A simpler approach uses the relationship between crop coeffcients and radiation 
interception seen in Chap. 10. The FAO method for calculating Kc divides the crop 
cycle into four stages (initial, rapid growth, maximum, and declining). Rapid growth 
starts when ground cover is around 0.2 and ends at ground cover 0.8–0.9. Full radia￾tion interception corresponds to Kc around 1.2, which leads to the simple model:
f K i c = − 0 3. (13.6)
where fi is the fraction of intercepted PAR. This should be valid for the third and 
fourth stages. In the initial stage, when we move from zero to 20% interception, we 
may assume an average value of fi = 0.1. Values of interception for the rapid growth 
stage may be calculated by linear interpolation (Fig. 13.7). Note that in this simple 
model, intercepted radiation in the fourth stage, when leaves are old and the canopy

is senescing, is a surrogate for absorbed radiation by pigments. In other words, dead 
leaves do not contribute to photosynthesis or transpiration, so the estimated inter￾cepted radiation refers only to functional leaves.
13.8 Radiation Use Efficiency
The relationship between crop growth rate (increase in shoot biomass per unit land 
area and time) and intercepted radiation is approximately linear (Fig.  13.8). 
Therefore, the relationship between biomass production (B) and the sum of inter￾cepted radiation should be linear:
B R = UE ∑ f Ri sp
emergence
harvest
(13.7)
where the proportionality coeffcient is the RUE (Radiation-Use Effciency, units of 
g/(MJ PAR)) and Rsp is the incoming PAR. The frst to propose such a relation was 
Monteith in 1977, who plotted biomass versus accumulated solar radiation inter￾cepted by different C3 crops (sugar beets, potatoes, barley, apples) and found

13 Radiation Interception, Radiation Use Efciency, and Crop Productivity188
similar linear relationships with a slope around 1.4 g dry matter/MJ solar radiation 
despite the obvious differences among these crops. The RUE of C3 plants inside 
greenhouses is higher than outdoors, with values in the range (2.2–2.5 g/(MJ PAR), 
which is explained by the higher proportion of diffuse radiation, the favorable ther￾mal environment, and lack of wind that promotes higher shoot:root ratio. The bio￾mass usually refers to the aboveground parts as quantifying the belowground 
biomass is much more diffcult and uncertain.
The slope of the relation between biomass and intercepted radiation represents 
RUE, provided the intercept of the regression is zero; this is normally the case when 
the calculation spans the sowing to harvest period (eq. 13.7). Radiation-use eff￾ciency can also be calculated for shorter periods during the season (see below). 
Where the intercept departs from zero, RUE is more reliably estimated as the ratio 
between biomass and intercepted radiation.
13.9 Crop Potential Productivity
We can calculate crop yield (Y) as the product of biomass and harvest index (Box 
13.1), and further express biomass as the product of RUE and total intercepted PAR
(Eq. 13.7):
Y H= I RUE ∑ f Ri sp
emergence
harvest
(13.8)
Assuming crops grown under ideal conditions that maximize capture and eff￾ciency in the use of radiation and harvest index, we can calculate the potential 
dry matter yield of a crop in a given environment. Abiotic and biotic stress fac￾tors can reduce the harvest index and the components of crop biomass (Sect. 
13.10). It is important to keep in mind that a fraction of the mass harvested by 
farmers is water. Therefore, the commercial or fresh yield can be calculated 
using Eq. 13.8 as:
Y
w fresh HI RUE fi s R p
emergence
harvest
= − ∑ 1
1 (13.9)
where w is the fraction of water over fresh mass. Values of w for different species 
are shown in Table 26.1 and Annex 26.1. The difference between Y and Yfresh is small 
for crops that are harvested dry (cereals, grain legumes) but it is very large for some 
species (e.g., potato, tomato).
The fraction of biomass that is harvested is called the Harvest Index (HI = Y/B). 
Biomass usually refers only to the aboveground fraction, unless the harvested organ 
is underground, in which case it is included in the biomass. The HI of fodder crops 
is very high (up to 0.9), as we may harvest and use almost all the aerial biomass (see 
Table 13.1). Small grain cereals like wheat can reach HI near 0.50, and many legume

The typical intervals for commercial

should be remembered, however, that the values shown in Table 13.1 correspond to 
"normal" cropping conditions, and that in extreme situations the HI may go down to 
zero, for example, if a crop fails to set grain due to untimely frost or heat.
13 Radiation Interception, Radiation Use Efciency, and Crop Productivity190
13.10 Dry Matter Partitioning and Harvest Index
The dry matter accumulated during the crop cycle is partitioned among plant organs. 
In determinate annual crops, there is a distinct vegetative growth phase where 
assimilates are partitioned into leaves, stems, and roots. This phase is followed by a 
reproductive phase when inforescences, fowers, seeds, and supporting structures 
grow while vegetative growth stops. In plants with an indeterminate growth habit, 
vegetative and reproductive growth overlap for much of the cycle. The difference 
between determinate and indeterminate growth is relative in the sense that there will 
always be some overlap between vegetative and reproductive growth even in deter￾minate crops. The shorter the overlap is, the more determinate the growth habit. 
Interestingly, genetic variability exists for growth habits, which has been exploited 
to develop determinate cultivars that allow mechanical harvesting (e.g., processing 
tomato).
The fraction of dry matter that goes to each plant organ is called the partition 
coeffcient. Part of the dry matter may be remobilized later and transported from one 
organ to another. This typically occurs with reserve carbohydrates in the stem, 
which support partially seed growth during the seed-flling period. In crops like 
sunfower and wheat, stem reserves can contribute signifcantly to grain yield, in 
particular under conditions that constrain photosynthesis during grain flling such as 
drought and foliar diseases.
The general trend over the XX century was the increase in the Harvest Index of 
the different species, which has enabled signifcant increases in yield without major 
improvements in biomass production. One example is that of the wheat cultivars 
obtained by the International Center for Improvement of Maize and Wheat 
(CIMMYT) in which improved HI was associated with short-stature plants, which 
enabled increasing N fertilization without increased risk of lodging. Maize is an 
exception to this trend, as improvement in yield has been primarily achieved by 
increasing crop biomass mediated by tolerance to crowding, in turn allowing higher 
sowing densities with a more effcient canopy architecture. For the last ffty years, 
plant breeders have focused on increasing HI to the point that the major crops are 
now approaching their biophysical limits in terms of HI.
Harvest index depends mainly on the developmental pattern of the crop, on the 
distribution of assimilates among plant organs, and on the ability to translocate 
assimilates to the harvestable organ. In particular, in determinate crops (e.g., sun￾fower) the reproductive phase is separated in time from the vegetative phase. Failure 
in setting seeds (or harvestable organs in general) may be a primary cause for 
reduced HI. Later, low post-anthesis assimilation or poor translocation of assimi￾lates may reduce further the HI. Therefore, several critical periods for determining 
the HI may exist (fower initiation, fowering, pollination). A greater fexibility of 
the HI may be expected for indeterminate crops (e.g., cotton) as both vegetative and 
reproductive growth overlap during most of the crop cycle.
Nutrient and water defcits have variable effects on the harvest index. This relates 
to the defnition of harvest index as a ratio of yield to biomass. Stress may reduce 
V. O. Sadras et al.191

both biomass and yield in equal proportion with no consequence for harvest index, 
or reduce biomass proportionally more than yield hence increasing HI, or reduce 
yield proportionally more than biomass, thus reducing the HI. The actual response 
of the HI to stress is thus contingent on the nature of the stress, and its timing, inten￾sity, and duration. Table  13.2 illustrates all three possibilities. In comparison to 
unfertilized crops, well-fertilized crops had similar, lower, or higher harvest indexes 
depending on location-specifc growing conditions. The seasonality of rainfall in 
dryland systems often has an impact on yield mediated by harvest index. In 
Mediterranean environments with winter rainfall that favors biomass growth and 
scarce rainfall during reproductive stages, the harvest index is often much lower 
than its potential. In irrigated systems, strategies of defcit irrigation may be used to 
improve HI by reducing water use during specifc periods that favor reproductive 
over vegetative growth (see Chap. 22).
13.11 Alternate Bearing and Harvest Index in Fruit Tree Crops
The concept of HI also applies to fruit tree species, but its determination requires 
specifc considerations. In trees, HI is the fraction of annual dry matter production 
allocated to fruits. It is very hard to measure by destructive sampling as we cannot 
separate the biomass produced over a year from that already in place at the start of 
the season (i.e., trunks, branches, and long-lived leaves in the case of perennials). 
On the other hand, yield and HI often vary substantially from one year to the next, 
as most tree crops alternate years with high and low fruit numbers. This “alternate 
bearing” can persist over time even under optimal growing conditions and implies 
that annual HI estimates provide limited insight into the “average” performance of 
the crop. Most importantly, yield oscillations challenge the experimental evaluation 
of management alternatives. Besides, in some tree crops like olive and pistachio, 
alternate bearing is usually synchronized over entire orchards, areas and even 
regions, eventually causing major labor and marketing problems apart from threat￾ening farm sustainability in low bearing (“off”) years.
Our understanding of this phenomenon is still poor, although the competition 
for assimilates between developing fruits and vegetative growth is considered the 
main cause (see Box 13.1). As inforescences or fowers appear on reproductive 
buds formed on shoots grown in previous seasons, any reduction in carbon parti￾tioning to shoots sets a limit on the potential number of reproductive buds (and 
13 Radiation Interception, Radiation Use Efciency, and Crop Productivity192
so fruits) that could be formed in the next season. That happens in high bearing 
(“on”) years because fruits exert a strong sink effect on assimilates, so a heavy 
fruit load limits or even suppresses shoot growth. Meanwhile, most assimilates 
are allocated to vegetative growth in off years, increasing the number of potential 
reproductive buds. The onset of yield oscillations may be associated with the 
occurrence of adverse conditions during critical stages of the reproductive cycle 
leading to an “off” year.
13.12 Crop Factors Affecting Interception and Efficiency 
in the Use of Radiation
Chapter 3 discussed crop traits affecting radiation interception, including optical 
and geometrical properties of leaves and canopies. The RUE, which is the amount 
of dry matter produced per unit of intercepted PAR, depends on the crop species. 
Under optimal temperature and water supply, C3 plants produce between 2.0 and 
2.5 g/MJ PAR and C4 plants produce between 2.5 and 3.0 g /MJ PAR.
Differences in seed composition explain the higher RUE of cereals in compari￾son to both oilseed crops and grain legumes. Following the analyses of Penning de 
Vries, the amount of glucose required to build 1 g of dry can be calculated as:
Box 13.1: Alternate Bearing in Olive Trees
In this species, inforescences appear on axillary buds of shoots grown in the 
previous season. In an experiment, we harvested trees of three cultivars either 
in June (just after fruit set), September (around veraison), or December (typi￾cal harvest date for oil production). The later the harvest date, the longer the 
overlap—and hence the competition—between reproductive and vegetative 
growth. This resulted in a lower production of axillary buds and infores￾cences in the following spring. The treatments did not show a consistent effect 
on the ratio of inforescences per bud, which shows that competition between 
fruit and shoot growth is the major determinant of alternate bearing in 
olive trees.

Example 13.5
We will calculate the potential yield (without limitation of water and nutri￾ents) of castor bean (Ricinus communis) in Cordoba, (Spain). The crop is 
sown on April 1 and harvested on September 30. The average fraction of inter￾cepted radiation is 0.2 in April, 0.4 in May, 0.9 in June, July, and August, and 
0.2 in September. The harvest index is 0.25. The seed water content is 5%. 
The castor seed contains 50% fat and 15% protein (dry mass basis). We also 
assume that temperature does not affect crop productivity. Solar radiation data 
and PAR interception calculation are shown in Table  13.3. Seasonal inter￾cepted PAR is 1106 MJ m−2

Season 1106.4
Variations in RUE due to the composition of the harvested product and loss of 
photosynthetic capacity that occurs in many crops during the fnal phase of the cycle 
reduce seasonal RUE below the maximum values. Thus, for seasonal calculation, 
we propose intervals of RUE of 1.6–2.0 g / (MJ PAR) for non-leguminous C3 plants, 
1.5–1.8 for C3 leguminous plants, and 2.2–3.0 g/(MJ PAR) for C4 plants. These 
RUE values represent “well-adapted” crops under normal cropping conditions, so 
they include the effect of temperature and assume a good supply of water and nutri￾ents. However, RUE is expected to change under cooler or hotter environments, and 
when water and nutrients are in short supply, as explained in the next section.
Some species show low RUE due to their low leaf photosynthesis; for example, 
olive RUE is 1.3 g/(MJ PAR) for nonbearing trees and 0.9 g/(MJ PAR) for bearing 
trees. This difference is due to the higher cost of biomass production of olive bear￾ing trees as fruits accumulate oil. In citrus, the RUE of adult trees is 1.3 g/(MJ PAR).
The intra-specifc variation in RUE is smaller than the differences between crop 
types associated with photosynthetic metabolism and seed composition. Nonetheless, 
selective pressure for yield has improved the radiation-use effciency of wheat in 
both favorable (UK) and stressful (Australia) environments (Fig 13.9). The improve￾ment in pre-fowering RUE of Australian wheat was associated with higher nitrogen 
uptake (i.e., greener leaves), and changes in canopy architecture that favored greater 
PAR penetration in the canopy; effectively, modern varieties have a greater propor￾tion of leaves contributing to total crop photosynthesis, whereas the photosynthesis 
per unit leaf area remained unchanged. The role of nitrogen in crop photosynthesis 
is discussed in the next section.
A single RUE value is useful for comparisons between contrasting crop types 
(C3 v C4, cereal v oilseed) and also captures large environmental effects, such as

shortage of water or nitrogen (next section). However, RUE changes with crop age, 
developmental stage, and the pattern of nitrogen and dry matter allocation. For 
example, studies of RUE in sunfower distinguished three phases: establishment 
(sowing to 47 days after sowing), rapid growth (47 days after sowing to anthesis), 
and grain flling (anthesis to maturity). Radiation-use effciency was highest during 
rapid growth (2.4 g/MJ) and lower during crop establishment (1.0 g/MJ) and grain 
flling (1.3 g/MJ). The low RUE during establishment was associated with a large 
proportion of leaves exposed to high radiation, and the intrinsically lower effciency 
of leaves at saturated light regimes. The low RUE during grain flling was related to 
high respiration and high synthesis cost of oil and protein in the seed (see Eq. 13.10) 
and to leaf senescence.
The concept of source and sink is useful to understand the physiology of the 
crop, despite some problems in defnitions. A mature leaf is a net source of carbon, 
whereas the growing seed is a sink. A leaf however transitions from sink at early 
stages of development to source at later stages. Likewise, wheat and sunfower 
stems are sinks of carbohydrates during early growth stages but become sources for 
grain flling. The source:sink ratio can be manipulated experimentally by increasing 
source activity (e.g., increasing ambient CO2 concentration or radiation), reducing 
source activity (e.g., defoliation, shading), reducing sink activity (e.g., removal of 
maize ear, cooling of potato tubers), or increasing sink activity (e.g., applying gib￾berellic acid). Experiments where the source:sink ratio is diminished often show an 
increase in photosynthesis, whereas increasing source:sink ratio may reduce 
13 Radiation Interception, Radiation Use Efciency, and Crop Productivity196
photosynthesis. With high source:sink ratio, the plant has a relative excess of photo￾synthates, and the accumulation of starch in leaves can trigger the feedback-inhibi￾tion of photosynthesis usually mediated by reduction in stomatal conductance. 
Conversely, leaf photosynthesis may be stimulated if the capacity of the source to 
meet the carbohydrate requirements of the sink is restricted. These source:sink 
interactions are agronomically important. For example in pasture species such as 
alfalfa or grasses, browsing by animals reduces the size of the canopy relative to 
root biomass, hence reducing the source:sink ratio. After browsing, the rate of pho￾tosynthesis of remanent leaves may increase in response to the low source:sink 
ratio, hence contributing to re-growth. This “compensatory photosynthesis” has 
also been recorded in plants after damage by insects that reduce source:sink ratio 
(e.g., defoliators). In wheat varieties developed in CIMMYT (International Centre 
for Improvement of Maize and Wheat), increased seed number in modern varieties, 
compared with older ones, has increased RUE during grain flling; this increase in 
crop photosynthesis has been interpreted in terms of reduced source:sink size, as 
grain number increased without a proportional increase in canopy size. Effectively, 
more grains are “pulling” photosynthesis up.
13.13 Environmental and Management Factors Affecting 
Interception and Efficiency in the Use of Radiation
Effects of temperature on biomass production and its components, radiation inter￾ception and RUE are twofold. First, and most important, temperature changes the 
duration of the period from sowing to harvest, setting the limits of integration in 
Eq. 13.8. At high latitudes in Europe, Asia, and North America, warming over recent 
decades has extended this period, with positive implications for crop growth and 
yield (Chap. 11). In contrast, increasing temperature in subtropical and temperate 
environments may shorten season length, with potentially negative effects on crop 
yield. A caveat to the correlation between yield and season length in grain crops is 
that the association is causal only when temperature or other factors affect the dura￾tion of the critical period of grain set. Second, RUE is non-linearly related to tem￾perature, an effect that is mediated by the effects of temperature on lower-level 
processes such as leaf gross photosynthesis, respiration, and dry matter partitioning. 
For example, feld pea RUE is reduced with average ambient temperatures below 
12 °C or above 22 °C.
Row spacing is manipulated to improve capture and effciency in the use of 
resources, and to accommodate practices such as weed control and tillage (Chap. 
17). The best row spacing for a combination of crop, soil, climate, and cropping 
system is usually determined empirically. Alternatively, we can apply the physio￾logical concepts developed in this chapter to predict the responses of crop yield to 
row spacing as illustrated in Fig. 13.10. For the well-watered crops in this study, no 
yield gains are expected from narrowing the space between rows when wide-row 
crops intercept 90% of incident radiation in the critical period of yield

determination but gains up to 12% can arise if wide-row crops intercept 60–90% of 
radiation. The gain in yield with narrowing row distance is proportional to the gain 
in intercepted radiation. In recent decades, even though row spacing has been dimin￾ishing to increase radiation interception, sowing machinery and tillage/traffc prac￾tices are the major determinants of row spacing.

14 Effects of Water Stress on Crop 
Production

Abstract
Water stress is due to a low water potential in the plant caused by low soil water 
potential, high evaporative demand, and/or a high resistance to water fow 
through the plant. The water defcit affects many crop processes, although most 
are related to the reduction in expansive growth, the most sensitive process, and 
stomatal closure. Mild to moderate defcits do not generally affect the harvest 
index, and in some species, they may increase it. However, severe water defcits 
reduce the harvest index (HI). The effect of water stress on crop yield can be 
quantifed by Stewart's equation, which establishes that the relative yield reduc￾tion is directly proportional to the relative reduction in evapotranspiration (ET), 
with an empirical coeffcient (Ky) which ranges between 0.8 and 1.5. More mech￾anistic models may be used to characterize the yield responses to variable water 
supply, but they need local calibration for accuracy.

14.1 Introduction
Cultivated plants require a continuous water supply to replace that lost by evapora￾tion from the aerial organs, particularly from the leaves. This requirement is due to 
the high evaporative demand (solar and thermal radiation and warm, dry air) expe￾rienced by the leaves while their substomatal cavities are saturated with water vapor. 
The gradient in water potential between the substomatal cavity and the leaf surface 
thus drives the evaporation process. Leaf cuticles, however, are signifcant barriers 
to evaporation, forcing most transpiration to fow through the stomata. For carbon 
dioxide to enter into the leaves, the stomata must be open, allowing water vapor to 
escape in response to the vapor pressure gradient. To maintain water fow without 
tissue desiccation, terrestrial plants have developed elaborate systems for the uptake 
and transport of water. Water fows from the soil into the root system and then is 
carried by xylem vessels to the leaves, where they replace the water evaporated into 
the atmosphere. Thus, from a physical point of view, the plants transport water from 
a source, the soil, to a sink, the atmosphere. These systems can transport large quan￾tities of water, equivalent, in a typical summer day to a water depth of 6 to 8 mm in 
the feld, which involves several times the total plant weight. However, a small, 
hardly detectable imbalance in the transport process in response to changes in the 
water supply from the soil or in atmospheric demand causes a water defcit in the 
plant. These mild defcits that are often harmful to crop growth and yield may occur 
despite the large amounts of water used by the plants. In this chapter, we outline the 
concepts of the energy status of water in the plant and its role in driving water fows. 
Then we look at the responses of crop processes to water defcits and the mecha￾nisms of crop regulation of transpiration. After establishing these principles, we 
analyze the links between water and crop production from an agronomic viewpoint.
14.2 Energy Status of Water in the Plant
As we have seen for the soil (Chap. 8), the energy status of water in the plant may 
be characterized in terms of water potential. To do this we must go down to the cel￾lular level since water status varies between subcellular compartments.
Schematically a plant cell is a protoplast (nucleus, cytoplasm, and vacuoles) sur￾rounded by a membrane (plasmalemma) that presses on a semi-rigid cell wall. This 
pressure, called turgor, refects turgor potential (Ψp). The osmotic potential (Ψo) due 
to solutes is the other main component of total water potential (Ψ) in the protoplast. 
In the cell wall, a porous structure composed of microfbers and polysaccharides, 
the solute concentration is much lower, so Ψo is very small and Ψp is zero. Thus, the 
major component of potential outside the protoplast is the matrix potential (Ψm) due 
to the adsorption forces that the porous cell wall matrix exerts on water. Another 
component of the potential, the gravitational, is negligible in plants except for very 
tall trees.
V. O. Sadras et al.201
Outside the cell, in the xylem, for the same water potential, its components will 
be different from in the cell. The Ψo is much lower and Ψp is negative since water in 
the xylem is under tension. Turgor in the protoplast and tension outside create a 
large pressure gradient that would tear the plasmalemma if not for the rigidity of the 
cell wall containing it.
The pressure potential is the main driver of the expansive growth of plant shoots 
and leaves and is largely responsible for the proper functioning of some basic pro￾cesses for growth and crop production.
14.3 Causes of Water Deficits
From the soil to the substomatal cavities, water moves in the liquid phase, whereas the 
fow from the substomatal cavities to atmosphere is in the vapor phase. Transpiration 
(Ep) is the water vapor fux from the substomatal cavities into the atmosphere follow￾ing a vapor pressure gradient. This water loss from the plant is compensated by the 
infow of root water absorption from the soil. The water fow can be expressed in 
terms of the water potential gradient between the soil and the leaves:
E
R p
s l
sl
   (14.1)
where Ψs is the soil water potential, Ψl is the leaf water potential, and Rsl is the resis￾tance to fow between the soil and the leaves. Rearranging Eq. 14.1:
  l s   R E sl p (14.2)
That is, the leaf water potential, which is always lower than Ψs, is a function of soil 
water potential, fow resistance, and transpiration rate. A low leaf water potential is 
required for water to move from the soil, so leaves are under a water defcit as long as 
transpiration occurs. However, it is considered that a plant is water-stressed when the 
water potential in its tissues decreases enough to affect physiological processes. Thus, 
the causes that can lead to low leaf water potential and therefore to water defcit are:
(a) Low soil water potential (low water content and/or high salt concentration in 
the soil solution)
(b) High evaporative demand (high Ep)
(c) High resistance to water fow (high Rsl) in the soil (low hydraulic conductivity, 
dry soil) or in the plant associated with low root length density, vascular dis￾eases, etc.
Example 14.1
In an equilibrium situation, the water potential in the vacuole is −0.5 MPa 
with components Ψp = 0.2 MPa and Ψo = − 0.7 MPa. The total potential in the 
cell wall is also −0.5  MPa. Its components are Ψm  = −0.48  MPa and Ψo
= −0.02 MPa.
14 Efects of Water Stress on Crop Production202
These processes can act simultaneously and in the same or in opposite direction. 
For instance, low soil water potential increases the soil-root resistance, while 
increases of transpiration may be accompanied by a reduction in resistance.
Water defcits may occur in the short term in plants with good water supply dur￾ing the middle of the day, in response to high evaporative demand. By contrast, 
long-term water defcits are commonly associated with the progressive depletion of 
soil water.
We have seen then that the water status of the plant is the result of interactions 
between atmospheric demand (Ep) and the ability of the plant to meet this demand, 
which depends on the soil water content and the fow resistance. Transpiration rates 
and soil water uptake follow similar diurnal patterns with a maximum in the middle 
of the day, due to the high evaporative demand, but are offset in time (Fig. 14.1).
The role of Rsl is critical in regulating the water fow between the soil and the 
atmosphere. The resistance between the soil and the leaves can be separated into 
several components, as indicated in Fig. 14.2. The resistance between the soil and 
the root depends on the soil’s hydraulic conductivity (K), root length density (Lv), 
and root resistance. As the soil dries, K decreases exponentially and Rsl increases. 
The root length density (root length per unit volume of soil) usually decreases expo￾nentially with depth. A higher Lv implies a shorter average distance between the soil 
and the root surface and thus a lower Rsl.
Cereals have higher root length density than dicots for crops of similar size 
(Fig.  14.3), reaching Lv between 3 104
 and 10 104

 in the surface layer 
(0–30 cm). The low root length density of dicots, which can support similarly large 
canopies, is compensated by larger and more abundant metaxylem vessels and 
smaller axial resistance to water fow. Numerous studies have shown that Lv around

 is enough for full soil water extraction down to the Permanent Wilting 
Point. Some crops such as sunfower can extract all subsoil water with Lv of about

 is probably related to

After penetrating the surface of a root, water must overcome a signifcant radial 
resistance before reaching the xylem vessels. This resistance is mostly due to the 
suberization of a layer, the endodermis, which prevents water from fowing through 
the apoplast hence forcing water fow through cell membranes. The lipid bilayer of 
cell membranes is a signifcant resistance to water fow in roots. However, 
14 Efects of Water Stress on Crop Production204
membranes contain certain proteins, the aquaporins, that control water fow across 
membranes by changes in their abundance, by opening and closing the channel (gat￾ing), or both. Therefore, stomata and aquaporins both provide mechanisms for 
changing the plant’s resistance to water fow. In some cases, there is a good correla￾tion between the expression of aquaporins and physiological traits, e.g. aquaporin 
expression follows a day/night cycle consistent with the daily changes in root 
hydraulic conductivity coupled with transpiration. After reaching the xylem, the 
axial resistances from the root to the base of the stem and from the stem to the leaves 
are much smaller (Fig. 14.2).
Water in the leaves fnds two resistances in parallel: the stomatal resistance deter￾mined by the degree of stomatal opening and the much greater cuticular resistance, 
highly variable among crops, with rice having half the value of corn or sorghum.
Although the crop is a simple intermediary for water transport between the soil 
and the atmosphere, the modulation of the resistances described above allows the 
matching, within certain limits, of the soil water supply to the evaporative demand 
of the atmosphere.
14.4 Effects of Water Deficits
Water stress can affect virtually all crop morphological and physiological processes 
if its duration and severity are intense enough. The general response is refected in 
reductions in plant size, leaf area, and harvestable yield.
The main effects of water stress on crops can be explained largely through the 
impact on two processes: expansive growth and stomatal functioning.
14.4.1 Expansive Growth
Expansive growth, e.g. leaf elongation, is very sensitive to water defcit, particularly 
in comparison to other processes such as photosynthesis per unit leaf area. Mild 
water defcits, therefore, decouple growth from photosynthesis, with the consequent 
accumulation of labile carbohydrates not used in the slowed-down growth.
Turgor is responsible for the plant form and is a prerequisite for cell expansion 
since the increase in size requires both new cell wall synthesis and turgor pressure 
against the wall. The relative growth rate of the cell may be related to Ψp by the fol￾lowing equation:
dV
dt V p pu
1       (14.3)
where V is the cell volume, ε is the cell wall extensibility, and Ψpu is the threshold 
turgor potential, below which the expansion is stopped. The value of Ψpu is high, 
which means that with a small reduction in Ψp, expansion may cease and this would 
occur much sooner than wilting (Ψp = 0).
V. O. Sadras et al.205
In general, if the crop is subjected to a progressive water defcit, acclimation 
occurs by increasing ε and/or reducing Ψpu, which conditions the future plant 
responses to water defcit. These acclimations occur differentially in the expansion 
of roots and aerial parts so that shoot growth is much more sensitive to water stress 
than root growth. In roots, Ψpu is reduced rapidly and solutes accumulate so that Ψo
is reduced (osmotic adjustment), allowing root growth to continue under low soil 
water potential.
The great sensitivity of expansive growth to water defcits leads to expansion 
reductions for all organs growing when the water defcit occurs, which causes vary￾ing effects at the crop level depending on the timing of the water defcit.
14.4.2 Stomata Functioning
In terms of evolution, stomatal closure prevents desiccation and death of the plant 
in the aerial environment, especially when water is scarce. The trade-offs of stoma￾tal closure are the reduction in the fux of CO2 into the leaves and thus in assimila￾tion, and the increase in canopy temperature. Stomatal closure under high vapor 
pressure defcit or drying soil favors a higher photosynthesis/transpiration ratio, 
which is related to water-use effciency as discussed in Sect. 14.5.
The stomata are formed by two guard cells of kidney shape that are welded at 
their ends. The stoma opening occurs when the guard cells are turgid. If their turgor 
is reduced, the guard cells approach and the stoma closes. Therefore, stomatal resis￾tance is a function of the pressure potential of guard cells, which is regulated by leaf 
water potential and other factors in a rather complex way. The complexity of stoma￾tal behavior arises from several causes. First, stomata respond to many environmen￾tal (CO2 concentration, temperature, vapor pressure defcit, radiation, and light 
quality) and plant factors (e.g., leaf age, source–sink ratio, see Chap. 10). Second, 
because of the rapid changes in the environment, the process of stomata regulation 
is highly dynamic; for example, stomatal resistance increases when evaporative 
demand increases, but the increased resistance improves hydration and thus leaf 
water potential, which in turn stimulates stomata opening. In short-time scales 
(minutes), the size of the stomata pore changes continuously, and there is also varia￾tion among stomata in the same leaf. Third, there are genotype-dependent differ￾ences in stomata response to soil and atmospheric dryness. In some species such as 
maize and soybean, stomata tend to close when leaf water potential drops; this 
allows for the maintenance of leaf water potential and for this reason, this strategy 
has been called “isohydric.” In other crops such as sunfower, stomata are more 
likely to remain open at low water potential; this response is called “anisohydric.” 
There is, however, intra-specifc variation in these strategies and a wide range in 
responses between the extreme isohydric and anisohydric behaviors (Fig.  14.4), 
Growing conditions, which infuence the rate of development of water stress, also 
affect such behavior, slow stress development is more conducing to isohydric 
behavior. Fourth, there are adaptive trade-offs in stomatal behavior. To understand 
these trade-offs, we need to recognize three functions of stomata: regulate the ratio

between photosynthesis and transpiration, prevent cavitation, and regulate canopy 
temperature. Stomata closure in drying soil or under high evaporative demand 
favors the photosynthesis/transpiration ratio and prevents cavitation. However, sto￾mata closure increases canopy temperature. This trade-off means that stomata phys￾iology cannot always be optimized. In wheat, cotton, and Shiraz grapevines, heat 
stress favors stomata opening and evaporative cooling at the expense of photosyn￾thesis/transpiration, suggesting that keeping the canopy cool is, under some condi￾tions, more important than saving water (Fig. 14.5). The role of stomata in regulating 
V. O. Sadras et al.207
canopy temperature is crucial in warm regions where heat waves, compounded with 
dry soil, can cause severe damage (see Sect. 15.3.1).
14.4.3 Crop Regulation of Transpiration
Crop transpiration (Ep) can be analyzed as the product of three factors: total trans￾piring area, approximated by the leaf area index (LAI), intercepted radiation (IR) per 
unit LAI, and transpiration per unit of intercepted radiation:
E LAI IR
LAI
E
IR p
p = (14.4)
A small canopy is the most effective means of transpiration control. Indeed, LAI
components including tillering or branching, and the area of individual leaves are 
very responsive to water defcit. For a given LAI, the amount of radiation inter￾cepted, which provides the energy for water evaporation, depends on canopy archi￾tecture. Figure 15.3 (Chap. 15) shows how wilting can transiently reduce IR/LAI
and therefore reduce transpiration. Transpiration per unit intercepted radiation is 
related to the conductance of crop canopies, which is related to both its aerody￾namic properties and stomatal conductance (Box 14.1).
The relative importance of the factors in Eq. (14.4) changes with crop develop￾ment (Table 14.1). In general, tissue expansion is much more sensitive to water def￾cit than stomatal conductance, and regulation of LAI is the main control of 
transpiration. Figure 14.6 illustrates this idea with experimental data of sunfower in 
Cordoba in 1991. In summer, the expansion rate decreases when the relative soil 
water content is 0.8, while stomatal conductance is affected when the relative soil 
water is 0.2–0.3. In spring, expansion is reduced after half of the soil water is 
depleted, which is explained by the better water status of plants under lower evapo￾rative demand. Thus, during the period of leaf growth, reduction in LAI is the main 
control of transpiration. However, in annual crops, LAI peaks around fowering, 
when the number and individual size of leaves are fxed; canopy expansion is there￾fore no longer relevant during grain flling. In this stage, leaf senescence is the only 
possible regulation of LAI, and often water defcit accelerates this process 
(Table 14.1).

Box 14.1: Canopy–Atmosphere Coupling
Figure 14.2 represents the fow of water from the soil to the atmosphere at the 
level of the plant. At the crop level, however, there is an additional resistance 
located between the canopy and the atmosphere, the aerodynamic resistance. 
With increasing aerodynamic resistance, the canopy and the atmosphere 
become increasingly decoupled (see Sect. 9.4). In these cases, the impact of 
stomatal resistance in modulating crop transpiration is less than in cases 
where the aerodynamic component represents a smaller resistance. In tall, 
aerodynamically rough vegetation such as conifer forests, the aerodynamic 
resistance is small, canopies and atmosphere are closely coupled, and the sto￾mata regulation has a signifcant impact on transpiration. In contrast, in short 
(aerodynamically smoother) vegetation, such as grassland, the aerodynamic 
resistance is higher, the canopy and atmosphere are less coupled, and the sto￾mata regulation has less impact on transpiration.
14.4.4 Effects on Other Processes and Interactions
The effects of water stress depend on its timing, duration, and severity. A very 
severe stress affects almost all crop processes and may lead to total crop loss. Crops 
do not usually suffer such severe defcits as to threaten their survival, so we will 
only consider the effects of mild to moderate water defcits. The effects can be 
defned and investigated at different levels of organization. For example, water def￾cit can reduce the rates of cell division and expansion and induce abnormal cell 
differentiation, which can result in fower primordia and/or fower abortion. Water

stress can cause hydrolysis of proteins and accumulation of amino acids which, at 
the leaf level, reduces CO2 fxation by a direct effect on photosystems. Water defcit 
increases levels of abscisic acid and ethylene and reduces levels of indole acetic 
acid, cytokinins and gibberellins. These hormonal changes can lead to accelerated 
senescence. Water stress has little effect on the respiratory processes, the transport 
of assimilates, and the rate of development.
Water stress under feld conditions, however, does not occur in isolation. In arid 
and semi-arid environments, low soil fertility interacts with low rainfall leading to 
water-nutrient co-limitation. Water and nitrogen co-limitation is particularly impor￾tant for the yield of cereals in Mediterranean environments, where water stress is 
also combined with heat stress. In wheat crops in South-Eastern Australia, ear dam￾age caused by a heat episode close to fowering was signifcant in rainfed crops but 
not in irrigated crops (Table 14.2). Conditions that favored vigorous growth and 
faster soil water depletion, including excessive nitrogen supply and higher sowing 
density, compounded the effects of heat in the rainfed crops (Table 14.2).
The sensitivity of crops to insects and diseases can increase, diminish, or remain 
unchanged in water-stressed plants. Water-stressed cotton, for example, was less 
susceptible to spider mites than their well-watered counterparts. This was because 
water defcit increased leaf thickness and hardness, making them less palatable to 
mites. In choice tests, mites showed a marked preference for leaves from well￾watered plants. By contrast, water stress in almond trees makes them more suscep￾tible to mite infestations. Root diseases can compound the effect of water defcit, 
particularly those that cause xylem blockage.
14.5 Coupling of Photosynthesis and Transpiration
The fow of CO2 into the leaf follows the same path as the fow of water vapor out 
of the leaf (transpiration). Any opening or closing of the stomata affects the two 
processes.

Where gsc (mol m−2
 s−1
) is the stomatal conductance for CO2, ei and ea (both in 
kPa) are the vapor pressure in the substomatal cavities and the air outside the leaf, 
respectively, and Pat (kPa) is the atmospheric pressure. The factor 1.6 is the ratio of 
diffusion coeffcients for water vapor and CO2 in air at 25 °C. A similar equation 
(Eq. 14.1) is used for photosynthesis.
Air within the substomatal cavities is usually close to saturation (ei = es at leaf 
temperature), so by adding and subtracting es at air temperature, we may write:
e e i a   e T s c     e e a s   T e a s    Ta c   VPD     T Ta (14.6)
where VPD is the Vapor Pressure Defcit (Chap. 5), Tc and Ta are the leaf (crop) and 
air temperature, respectively, while Δ ( kPa K−1
) is the slope of the saturation vapor 
pressure function versus temperature.

This equation shows that the photosynthesis/transpiration ratio (also called 
Water-Use Effciency, WUE) depends mainly on the vapor pressure defcit: the 
amount of carbon fxed per unit of water lost will decrease as the atmosphere is drier 
or warmer. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.7 that shows hourly values of cotton WUE
as a function of VPD during summer days in Cordoba, Spain. Here, WUE was cal￾culated as the ratio of canopy photosynthesis and ET. Equation 14.9 also indicates 
that the photosynthesis/transpiration ratio increases as Ca increases and with stoma￾tal closure, i.e. a reduction in gsc. This last effect may be offset by the increase in Tc
caused by stomatal closure.

Example 14.2
Typical seasonal values of WUE (g dry matter/kg water transpired) for various 
C3 species in Southern Spain are: olive (3.4), sunfower (3.5), and wheat (5.3).
The higher value of wheat is due to lower VPD during its cycle from 
December to May (average 0.7 kPa) as compared with sunfower (February to 
July, 1.3 kPa) and olive (January to December, 1.2 kPa). The theoretical esti￾mates, taking Ci/Ca = 0.75, would be:
Wheat: 6.5 g dry matter L−1
kPa/0.7 ∙ 0.6 = 5.6 g dry matter/kg water
Olive: 6.5 g dry matter L−1
 kPa/1.2 ∙ 0.6 = 3.25 g dry matter/kg water
Sunfower: 6.5 g dry matter L−1
kPa/1.3 ∙ 0.6 = 3.0 g dry matter/kg water
C4 plants. If we convert these values to biomass production of carbohydrates and 
take into account the relation between daytime VPD and mean VPD, the coeffcients 
would be 5.4–8 g dry matter L−1
 kPa for C3 and 16.2–18.9 g dry matter L−1
 kPa for 
C4. If we consider also night respiration, the coeffcients would be reduced to 
around 60% of the previous values for seasonal estimates.

14.6 Quantifying the Impact of Water Deficit 
on Crop Production
The impact of water defcit on crop production can be quantifed using models of 
different complexity. Here we illustrate the simple model of Stewart and the more 
complex AquaCrop model.
14.6.1 Stewart Model
The model is based on the empirical relations between crop evapotranspiration and 
yield, which derive from the association between transpiration and photosynthesis. 
These two processes are linked for two reasons. First and most importantly, both are 
driven by radiation that provides the energy for water evaporation and CO2 reduc￾tion. Smaller canopies capture less radiation, fx less carbon, and transpire less. 
Second, the fows of both water and CO2 between the crop and the atmosphere are 
partially regulated by stomata. These two mechanisms account for the correlations 
between biomass and transpiration (see Sect. 14.5). Therefore, if the harvest index 
is known, yield can be calculated as a function of seasonal transpiration using 
Eq. 14.11:
Y HI WUE E t
t
 i pi


emergence
harvest
(14.12)
where WUEi is the biomass produced per unit transpiration (g dry matter/kg water) 
for day i, which depends mainly on VPD and the crop species (Eq. 14.10). For sim￾plicity, we will assume that WUE is constant throughout the season and that HI is 
not affected by water defcit, but see Box 13.1 for a more realistic discussion. As 
evapotranspiration of day i is the sum of soil evaporation and transpiration:

in Cordoba, Spain on 21 March with ET0 of 3 mm day−1

V. O. Sadras et al.213
We arrive at a linear relationship between yield and total evapotranspiration 
(ET). The intercept is negative, and the x-intercept is seasonal soil evaporation (Es) 
while the slope is the product of HI and WUE.
We are interested in computing yield as a function of water used (ET). A simple 
approach that requires a priori estimates of ET and yield in unstressed crops (ETx
and Yx) is the model of Stewart, which calculates the relative reduction in yield as a 
linear function of the relative reduction in seasonal ET:

where Ky is a coeffcient of sensitivity to water stress. If HI is not affected by water 
stress and we change ET while keeping soil evaporation constant, Ky will depend 
only on the ratio of soil evaporation:transpiration:
K
E
E y
s
p
 1 (14.15)
On the other hand, if soil evaporation is proportional to ET, Ky should tend to 1. 
These relations are not valid for severe water stress that reduces HI (see Sect. 13.10). 
In general, the empirical values reported for Ky are in the range of 0.8–1.5.
The Stewart model, adopted by the FAO Manual 33 of Doorenbos and Kassam, 
has been used as a frst approximation for calculating yield as a function of ET but 
has a number of limitations:
– Variation in WUE: For a given environment mean WUE will depend on when 
actual transpiration occurs due to the inverse dependence of WUE on VPD. Under 
water stress, the pattern of water use will change as compared to the unstressed 
situation, which may lead to important changes in WUE.
– Calculation of unstressed yield: In the absence of local data, a good alternative 
would be to use a crop simulation model, calibrated and verifed for local 
conditions.
– Irrigation method: The irrigation method affects evaporation from the soil sur￾face. A different Es leads to different ET for the same transpiration (the variable 
directly related to biomass and yield). The Ky coeffcient of Eq. 14.14 can be 
considered constant only if Es and Ep are affected equally by a reduction in the 
supply of irrigation, which is very unlikely.
– Acclimation: Crops’ responses to water stress are conditional to the previous 
history of stress. In addition, the effect of water defcit in perennials can be car￾ried over from one season to the next.
These limitations are common to any empirical model used to generate universal 
production functions. However, their use can be advantageous when high accuracy 
is not required and when they are the only available alternative for practical purposes.
14 Efects of Water Stress on Crop Production214
14.6.2 The AquaCrop Simulation Model
AquaCrop (www.fao.org/nr/water/aquacrop.html) is a dynamic simulation model of 
herbaceous crops that predicts yield as a function of water supply. It is based on the 
relation between B and Ep and on the constancy of WUE (for a given species) if 
normalized by the evaporative demand (reference ET). After seedling emergence, 
the model calculates the rate of canopy expansion and the components of ET (Ep and 
Es) by computing soil water extraction daily. Based on the transpiration, the model 
then calculates the increment of B, which is accumulated until harvest. As the can￾opy develops and the crop grows driven by thermal time, different developmental 
stages occur depending on the crop. The HI is built up during the pertinent period 
and enters in the computation of yield at the harvest date.
Water stress affects the simulations frst via reductions in canopy expansion, fol￾lowed by reductions in stomatal conductance and acceleration of canopy senes￾cence. Different crop-specifc thresholds in root zone water content are defned for 
each process, and the HI is also modulated by water defcits, generally decreasing 
under severe stress. The model gives an estimate of water-limited potential yield 
without any other limiting or yield-reducing factors. It has a soil fertility module to 
consider non-optimal fertility conditions common in many agricultural systems.
To obtain accurate predictions, AquaCrop should be calibrated and validated 
with experimental data obtained in the environment where it will be utilized. Its 
description and numerous applications may be found in FAO manual ID 66 and the 
AquaCrop website.

15 Abiotic and Biotic Stress Limitations 
to Crop Productivity
Victor O. Sadras, Francisco J. Villalobos , and Elias Fereres
Abstract
Environmental factors including water stress, nutrient defciency, high or low 
temperatures, chemical (Al-toxicity, salinity) and physical soil constraints (e.g., 
compaction), and biotic factors reduce crop yield. Defcit of water and nitrogen, 
and soil constraints have a larger impact on canopy size and duration, hence 
growth reductions are closely linked with reduced intercepted radiation; radia￾tion use effciency is generally less responsive to stress. Extreme temperatures at 
critical stages usually reduce harvest index and yield. Other stresses can be neu￾tral, positive, or negative for the harvest index; this depends on the nature, tim￾ing, intensity, and duration of stress and its relative impact on total and harvestable 
biomass. Biotic agents such as pests, diseases, and weeds can reduce crop yield 
substantially, hence the importance of appropriate crop protection practices.
15.1 Introduction
In Chap. 13, we analyzed crop yield as a function of temperature and radiation 
interception. This “potential” yield will be higher than actual yields as other biotic 
and abiotic factors affecting the crop come into play. The main abiotic factors that 
reduce crop yields are excess or defcit of water (reviewed in Chap. 14); nutrient 
defcit; soil chemical (salinity, acidity) or physical (e.g., compaction) constraints;

and meteorological events including extremely high or low temperatures, hail, and 
wind. Biotic factors are weeds, animal pests, and diseases.
In this chapter, we will revise the main impact of these factors on crop yield. 
Some of them have been discussed (water in Chap. 14) while others (salinity, nutri￾ent defcits, frost) will be treated in more detail in specifc chapters of this book.
15.2 Nutrient Deficiency and Soil-Related Limitations 
of Productivity
Defcits of water or nutrients reduce biomass by primarily reducing leaf area index 
and radiation interception; under severe stress, radiation use effciency is also 
reduced. This is because tissue expansion is more sensitive to water and nutrient 
defcit than leaf photosynthetic rate (Chap. 14). Indeed, a common short-term 
response of water and N-stressed plants is to accumulate carbohydrates as the 
restriction in expansion is more severe than in photosynthesis, leading to a transient 
excess of reduced carbon.
The effects of N supply on crop growth and yield can thus be explained in terms 
of radiation interception and its use effciency. Nitrogen defcit reduces crop LAI by 
reducing tillering or branching, and leaf expansion (Fig. 15.1). Reduced leaf size of 
nitrogen-defcient crops is associated with reduced cell division and expansion 
(Table  15.1). Nitrogen defcit can accelerate leaf senescence (Fig.  15.2), further 
contributing to reduced radiation interception and photosynthesis. Rubisco and 
light-harvesting proteins involved in photosynthesis represent 60% of the leaf N

content, hence the link: shortage of nitrogen ➔ less Rubisco ➔ less 
photosynthesis.
The effects of water supply on crop growth and yield (Chap. 14) can also be 
explained in terms of interception and effciency in the use of radiation. Water def￾cits cause irreversible responses such as reduced tillering or branching, and reduced 
leaf expansion. Reduced stomatal conductance and wilting are transient crop 
responses to water defcit that reduce crop water use and photosynthesis. Figure 15.3
illustrates the sawtooth pattern of radiation interception in alternating dry-wet peri￾ods with transient wilting and recovery after irrigation. In addition to the individual 
effects of nitrogen and water, these resources often interact in complex ways. In 
wheat crops growing under a combination of irrigation and fertilizer regimes, RUE
was 1.8 g/MJ in rainfed, unfertilized crops and increased to 2.1 g/MJ with N fertil￾ization. Weekly irrigation did not improve RUE in unfertilized crops, but irrigation 
combined with N fertilization increased effciency to 2.5 g/MJ.
In common with water and nitrogen defcits, physical and chemical soil con￾straints reduce canopy size and interception of radiation, whereas radiation use eff￾ciency is less affected. This is illustrated in the cases of soil compaction and 
aluminum toxicity.
Soil compaction is a common problem, often caused by tillage, machinery traf￾fc, and loss of organic matter, refected in increased soil bulk density. Its effects on 
the crop are two-fold: it hinders the emergence and establishment of seedlings and 
slows down the growth of the root system and the shoot. The effect of compaction 
on root growth is quantifed by the penetration resistance, which can be measured

with a penetrometer. For a particular soil, penetration resistance is directly propor￾tional to the apparent density and inversely proportional to the water content of the 
soil. Therefore, the effects of compaction are much more severe when the soil is dry 
(Chap. 17). In the Mallee region of South-Eastern Australia, sandy soils often 
develop a compacted layer at 0.2–0.3 m depth, thus restricting root proliferation and 
water and N uptake below this depth. Crops in compacted soil were compared with 
crops in soils where compaction was removed by deep ripping (subsoiling). Wheat 
yield in compacted soil ranged from 1.2 to 2.9 t/ha, and ripping improved yield up 
to 40%. The reduction in yield associated with compaction was fully accounted for 
by reduced leaf area index and intercepted radiation, whereas radiation use eff￾ciency was unaffected by soil condition.
Aluminum toxicity reduces yield in acid soils (pH < 5.8), about 30% of agricul￾tural soils worldwide. Growth analysis of Al-tolerant and Al-sensitive wheat culti￾vars in southern Chile showed a marked reduction in intercepted radiation with soil 
Al, a largely unresponsive RUE in the tolerant wheat and reductions in RUE in 
sensitive wheat only at high Al concentrations (Fig. 15.4).

15.3.1 High Temperature
The effect of heat depends on the timing, duration, and intensity of the stress. Yield 
reductions are more severe for heat events during a critical period, with the conse￾quent reduction especially in grain number while grain size is less affected, as illus￾trated in Fig. 15.5. Late-season high temperatures can reduce grain size by shortening 
the grain growth period and indirectly, by accelerating leaf senescence. In 
Mediterranean climates, low water availability is coincident with high temperature 
so low transpiration due to water stress amplifes heat stress as canopy temperature 
increases due to stomatal closure.
Maximum canopy temperature differs from maximum air temperature. 
Turbulence is a main determinant of that difference that decreases as wind speed 
increases. On the other hand, water defcits that induce stomatal closure decrease 
transpiration cooling and thus increase canopy temperature. Therefore, the impact 
of high temperatures on crops is amplifed by water defcits. Here we present a 
15 Abiotic and Biotic Stress Limitations to Crop Productivity220
simple procedure for calculating the expected maximum crop temperature from 
standard weather data.
Using Eqs. 9.8 and 9.10, we compute the maximum canopy temperature as:

where Tcx and Tax are the maximum canopy and air temperature (°C), respectively, 
fG is the fraction of net radiation invested in soil heat fux (taken as 0.1 during the 
daytime), LE is the latent heat fux, raH is the aerodynamic resistance for heat 
exchange, ρ is the air density, and Cp is the specifc heat of air.
This equation is evaluated at the time of maximum temperature, which is assumed 
to occur 3 h after solar noon. At that time, solar radiation on sunny days is approxi￾mately 84% of the value at solar noon. We also assume that on average on sunny 
days, net radiation is 60% of solar radiation, so:

where Rnx is the net radiation (W m−2

the daily solar radiation (MJ m−2

), and Ns is the day length (hour).
The time course of latent heat fux (LE) in the daytime is assumed to follow a 
sine function, with the maximum occurring at the time of maximum air tempera￾ture. Therefore, the maximum LE (LEx, W m−2
) is:

The coeffcient cw depends on crop height (h) and lies between 7.3 (h = 0.5 m) 
and 5.5 (h = 3 m).
Wind speed at the time of maximum temperature is calculated by assuming that 
the mean daytime wind speed is twice the mean value during the nighttime and that 
the value during the day is a sine function. Therefore, at the time of maximum tem￾perature, wind speed at the weather station is:

where U2gm is the mean (24 h) wind speed at the weather station.

For feld crops, typical values of raH are between 6 (high wind speed) and 12 s/m 
(moderate wind speed) with only a minor effect of crop height.
These equations show how water defcit interacts with air temperature and wind 
to determine crop temperature (see Example 15.1).

15.3.2 Hail
Hail is a form of solid precipitation consisting of ice balls or lumps that originate in 
strong thunderstorm clouds (cumulonimbi). The diameter of hailstones is typically 
between 5 and 12 mm. Hail occurrence is localized over areas from a few to hun￾dreds of hectares.
Hail is more common in mid-latitudes (inland areas, elevated regions) than in the 
tropics despite the higher frequency of thunderstorms in the latter. Hailstorms are 
common in Northern India and parts of China and Central Europe. During the year, 
hail will occur mostly during spring and summer.
Hail crop damage is due to the impact of hailstones whose velocity is propor￾tional to size. For a 1 cm diameter hailstone, terminal velocity could reach 9 m/s 
while an 8 cm hailstone would fall at 48 m/s. Apart from the direct physical damage 
that destroys leaves or reproductive structures, wounds facilitate infection by patho￾gens. The effect of defoliation due to hail on crop yield depends on the development 
stage when hail occurs and the level of defoliation. Partial early defoliation may be 
compensated by increased dry matter allocation to leaves resulting in a small reduc￾tion in yield. Full defoliation before anthesis may be catastrophic for yield. Damage 
to reproductive structures leads to a reduced harvest index in proportion to the num￾ber of structures affected. Partial damage to fruits greatly reduces their commer￾cial value.
High-value crops may be protected with anti-hail nets. In feld crops or extensive 
fruit production, nets are not feasible so the best option is crop insurance. Silver 
iodide is also used with anti-hail rockets or ground generators. This compound 
increases the number of deposition nuclei within the cloud, so more hail particles 
with smaller sizes will form.

15.4 Waterlogging
High soil water content implies a limited oxygen supply for root respiration, so root 
function (absorption, growth) is impaired. If the soil is saturated, the roots decom￾pose starting from the tips, and the plant stops growing and eventually dies. Most 
often, crops suffer from temporal waterlogging events and recover partially after￾ward, but the poor root system may compromise water and nutrient absorption at 
high-demand periods. This is particularly important in some cropping systems as in 
the high-rainfall areas of Victoria, Australia or in the clay soils of Southern Spain 
where drought late in the season follows early-season waterlogging.
Waterlogging contributes to N losses by denitrifcation (see Chap. 26), the con￾version of nitrate to volatile N compounds. Low N uptake will cause symptoms of 
N defciency.
Waterlogging may be prevented by improving the feld drainage or using raised 
beds at planting.
15.5 Biotic Factors
Biotic agents causing crop damage (generically known as pests) are weeds, animal 
pests (arthropods, nematodes, gastropods, rodents, and birds), and pathogens (fungi, 
bacteria, and viruses).
The effect of pests and diseases on crop growth can also be analyzed in terms of 
capture and effciency in the use of radiation, and harvest index (Eq. 13.3). Insects 
that feed on reproductive structures, such as cotton bollworms, have a primary effect 
on harvest index. In extreme cases of uncontrolled infestation, cotton crops can 
accumulate large amounts of biomass with little fruit set, i.e. low harvest index and 
yield. Defoliators reduce leaf area and intercepted radiation, whereas some diseases 
can also reduce the photosynthetic rate of individual leaves and RUE. Spider mites, 
for example, pierce the leaf epidermis with needle-like mouthparts and feed on 
mesophyll and palisade cells, thus reducing leaf photosynthesis and RUE (Fig. 15.6). RELATIVE RUE

Comparisons of wheat crops protected with fungicides and unprotected crops 
exposed to damage by foliar pathogens showed that growth reduction was mostly 
associated with reduced healthy leaf area, with a secondary contribution of reduced 
radiation use effciency.
15.5.1 Arthropods
Many species of insects and other arthropods are present in the agro-ecosystem but 
only a few are important pests, causing severe yield loss. Insects are six-legged 
invertebrates that usually undergo metamorphosis during development. Adult 
insects have three body regions (head, thorax, and abdomen), three pairs of legs, one 
pair of antennae, complex mouthparts, and frequently two pairs of wings. The skin 
of an insect is the exoskeleton, which covers the whole body.
All insects have an egg and an adult stage. Complete metamorphosis includes 
4 stages (egg, larva, pupa, and adult). The most common, foliage-eating insect 
pests are larvae of Lepidoptera (butterfies and moths) and larvae and adults of 
Coleoptera (beetles). Aphids, leafhoppers, and thrips not just feed on the crop but 
are also transmission vectors of bacteria and virus diseases. Recent episodes of 
bacteria and virus diseases transmitted by leafhoppers are affecting the citrus and 
olive industries worldwide.
Many insect species are predators or parasites of other insects and are, thus, ben￾efcial, so pest control should avoid damaging them.
15.5.2 Plant Pathogens
Plant pathogens (fungi, bacteria, and viruses) affect crop plants by altering the fol￾lowing processes:
– Photosynthesis: Destruction of photosynthetic tissue, degradation of chloro￾plasts, leaf senescence, yellowing, etc.
– - Water and nutrient transport: Destruction of roots, formation of root galls and 
root knots, impaired root absorption, destruction or blocking of xylem tissue, 
damage to leaf cuticles or stomatal function (higher transpiration), and altered 
phloem transport.
– Plant respiration may increase after infection and reduce growth and plant 
reserves.
– Membrane permeability may increase causing leaf damage by nutrient losses 
and entry of toxins.
– Changes in transcription and translation of nucleic acids, which alter plant func￾tion and structure and the synthesis of enzymes or substances involved in plant 
resistance.
The disease starts with a primary infection (frst in the season) due to primary 
inoculum (spores or fungal mycelium) that overwinters, i.e. survives from one 
growing season to the next.
V. O. Sadras et al.225
The probability of a disease epidemic is proportional to the amount of inoculum 
and the proximity to its host. Primary infection occurs when the pathogen is in con￾tact with a susceptible host under suitable conditions. The pathogens enter directly 
through the plant’s surface, wounds, or natural openings. Bacteria and fungi require 
free water for spore germination, so infection is favored by wet periods with high air 
humidity and by wet canopies.
Dissemination of the pathogen from an inoculum source to a host can occur by 
wind, rain splash, runoff, insects, infected seeds or seedlings, etc. Fungi grow and 
spread within their host employing mycelium, and eventually produce spores on or 
within the infected tissue. These spores lead to secondary infections during the sea￾son. Bacteria spread in the plant by rapidly increasing the population. Then, when 
fssures develop on infected tissue, the cells (secondary inoculum) are exposed to 
the environment and thus, dissemination may proceed.
The secondary infection cycle can be repeated many times during the growing 
season, depending on the biology of the pathogen and its host and environmental 
conditions.
15.5.3 Yield Losses Due to Pests
The crop yield loss due to pests may be characterized by an actual and a potential 
value. The potential yield loss occurs with no pest control and the actual loss is that 
observed despite the crop protection practices. The effcacy of the crop protection 
practices may be quantifed as a percentage of potential losses prevented. The 
potential and actual losses vary with crop species, pest, and environment. The total 
loss potential of all biotic factors worldwide varies between 50% (wheat) and more 
than 80% (cotton). Actual losses are estimated at 26–31% for soybean, wheat, 
maize, and cotton, and 37–40% for potatoes and rice, respectively (Table  15.2). 
Table 15.2 Yield losses due to pests at a global scale

Potential and actual yield losses (%) are those occurring in a no-control and a current control sce￾nario, respectively. The effcacy of control is the percentage of losses prevented by current control 
measures
15 Abiotic and Biotic Stress Limitations to Crop Productivity226
Overall, weeds have the highest loss potential (23–40%) with animal pests and 
pathogens being less important and of similar weight (9–37% and 9–29%, respec￾tively). Although viruses cause serious problems in potatoes and sugar beets in 
some areas, worldwide losses due to viruses average 6–7% on these crops and 
<1–3% on other species. The effcacy of crop protection lies between 43% and 65% 
for the different crops. Global effcacy in weed control (67–80%) is much higher 
than that of animal pests (9–67%) or diseases (9–30%). These values have to be 
taken only as indicative as they are based on estimates of reference yields (not 
affected by pests).
Table 15.2 shows also the possible impact of restrictions on pest control brought 
about by environmental concerns. If we abandoned pest control, we would have an 
impact on yields equal to the difference between potential and actual yield loss, 
i.e. between 22 (wheat) and 53% (cotton).

Abstract
Successful crop establishment depends on several factors at the time of sowing 
(soil water content, soil structure and soil temperature, seed viability, presence of 
pests). Therefore, decisions regarding the date and depth of sowing, planting 
density, spatial arrangement of plants, and other cultural techniques (irrigation, 
fertilization, application of pesticides) will be critical. The sowing date should 
match the growing cycle to the best possible environmental conditions for the 
crop. Early spring sowings improve water use effciency in Mediterranean areas 
but increase the risk of attacks by biotic factors. The seeding rate is a function of 
single seed mass, desired planting density, seed viability, and expected fraction 
of emerged plants. Trees and some annual species are sown in nurseries where 
they grow for some time until they are transplanted to the feld. The best time for 
planting trees is autumn when they are dormant and the risk of desiccation is 
minimal.
16.1 Introduction
By sowing or planting the farmer intends to ensure good crop establishment and get 
the right conditions for growth, development, and yield. For many crops, the estab￾lishment phase (germination, emergence, and early seedling growth) is the most

critical phase of the cycle. To succeed, the farmer must make a series of decisions 
related to the amount of seed to be used, the method of planting and the spatial dis￾tribution of seeds, the planting date, the application of pesticides, or performing 
additional tasks like irrigation.
16.2 Crop Emergence
Soon after sowing the seeds, the seedlings will emerge from the soil. The duration 
of this period and the success, i.e., the fraction of seeds leading to emerged seed￾lings, depend on several factors:
– Seed viability: A viable seed is one able to germinate under suitable conditions. 
Viability decreases with time from the harvest of the seeds and occurs in parallel 
to the loss of reserve substances (e.g., lipid oxidation in sunfower seeds). In 
some species, some mechanisms delay seed germination, such as the presence of 
germination inhibitors or waterproof coats. For these cases, germination may be 
improved by scarifcation (mechanical abrasion or chemical treatment with acids 
to increase the permeability of seed coats) or stratifcation (placing the seeds 
between layers of cold (1–5 °C) moist soil).
– Soil water content: Germination is a process that begins with water uptake by the 
dry seed (imbibition). If the soil is dry or the contact seed soil is loose, the water 
transport from the soil to the seed is prevented, and germination does not pro￾ceed. After germination, the radicle expands, which contributes to guaranteeing 
the supply of water to the seedling. The increase in depth of the radicle occurs in 
advance of hypocotyl growth, so that, at the time of emergence, root depth nor￾mally exceeds 10 cm.
– Temperature: Along with depth, temperature will determine the duration of the 
sowing-emergence period. If this period is too long, the likelihood of attacks by 
pathogens or soil insects increases. Table 16.1 shows the average values of ther￾mal time from sowing to emergence and its base temperature for a series of 
annual crops.
– Soil structure: the presence of a surface crust or excessive soil compaction above 
the seed makes emergence diffcult as they prevent the expansion of the hypo￾cotyl, especially if the soil is dry (Chap. 17). A greater amount of seed or wetting 
of the soil can contribute to mitigating the effects of the surface crust.
– Presence of pests or pathogens: during emergence and initial seedling growth, 
attacks by insects or soil fungi can often lead to a failure of crop establishment. 
To avoid this problem, fungicides (seed treatment) and/or insecticides (seed and/
or soil treatments) are applied.
– Oxygen concentration in the soil: the processes of germination and emergence 
use energy derived from the seed reserves through respiration, which is an aero￾bic process. This is why the fraction of emerged plants can be greatly reduced in 
waterlogged soils.

16.3 Decisions Related to Sowing
The farmer has to make a series of operational decisions before sowing the crop, 
such as date of sowing, amount of seed (seeding rate), sowing depth, and the plant￾ing pattern (row distance, plant spacing within the row). Additional operations may 
be required such as fertilization, irrigation, application of pesticides, or tillage.
16 Sowing and Planting232
The method of sowing, which may imply the selection of the planting machinery 
(e.g., seed drill), is a key strategic decision for the farmer.
16.4 Sowing Date
The choice of sowing date has to ensure that the crop cycle matches the most suit￾able period for growth and yield. The frst limitation on the growth of a crop is its 
ability to survive when exposed to low temperatures. In mid-latitudes, this limita￾tion allows classifying crops into two categories:
(a) Autumn sown crops: species able to withstand frost and grow at low tempera￾tures (winter cereals, rapeseed, fax, faba beans, beets, etc.). They have a low 
base temperature.
(b) Spring plantings: species with high base temperature (corn, cotton, soybeans). 
They are damaged even by low temperatures above freezing.
Regardless of the type of crop, early plantings have several advantages:
(a) Water use effciency is inversely proportional to the vapor pressure defcit 
(Chap. 14). If crops are grown under low evaporative demand (early planting 
date), they produce more biomass and will require less water in irrigated condi￾tions. This is especially important in Mediterranean climates as rainfall 
decreases and evaporative demand increases from spring to summer.
(b) The grain-flling process is more effcient and longer if the temperature is not 
too high. If we prevent this process from occurring under high temperatures, the 
harvest index will increase, and so will yield.
(c) In some spring-summer crops, the cycle may be terminated by cold tempera￾tures in autumn (e.g., cotton). Therefore, early sowing favors crop maturing 
before low temperatures stop crop development. Additionally, autumn precipi￾tation may adversely affect crop quality.
(d) In some horticultural crops, the price is directly proportional to precocity 
(melon, watermelon, etc.); thus, early sowing allows increased revenue.
Early planting may be limited by possible negative effects later in the growing 
season. For winter cereals, it is critical to avoid frost during anthesis. This is achieved 
by preventing excessively early plantings and/or using longer-season cultivars such 
as winter types with large vernalization requirements. The environmental condi￾tions at the time of sowing may also restrict early sowings:
– If the temperature is too low, the crop takes a long time to emerge and establish, 
allowing the attack of biotic agents and leading to a signifcant reduction in the 
fraction of established plants. Also under low-temperature conditions, weed 
F. J. Villalobos et al.233
competition will be more severe. We should sow when the temperature is such 
that the sowing-emergence period does not exceed 15–20 days. To calculate the 
time from sowing to emergence as a function of temperature for different crops, 
we can use the information presented in Table 16.1.
– Water content in the soil at the time of sowing should ensure seed imbibition and 
the water supply to the seedlings after they emerge. In Mediterranean areas, the 
autumn sowing is usually delayed until the rains have been suffcient and evapo￾rative demand is low. Sowing over partially dry soil may cause relatively early 
emergence (with high evaporative demand), but seedlings may die if the rains do 
not continue.
16.5 Seeding Rate and Planting Density
The amount of seed to be applied per unit area (seeding rate) depends on the cost of 
the seed and the planting density desired.
(a) Cost of seed: In general, the cost of seed is a low fraction of total cultivation 
costs. However, the consequences of using a small amount of seed or low￾quality seed may be extremely negative (see the importance of obtaining a suit￾able planting density in Chap. 12). We should use high-quality seeds. The 
indices used to characterize the quality of the seed are viability (germination 
percentage) and purity (proportion of the seed belonging to the acquired culti￾var). The seed should be free of pests, diseases, and weed seeds and have a 
suitable size. The probability of emergence and the growth rate of the seedling 
afterward are both proportional to seed size.
(b) Density: The amount of seed used must be suffcient to ensure the emergence 
and establishment of a suffcient number of seedlings. The required excess of 
seed depends on various factors (seed viability, soil structure, pathogens, water 
content, etc.).
The seeding rate (QS, g m−2
) may be calculated as:
QS = p D
f f
u p
1 2 (16.1)
where pu is the mass of each seed (g/seed), Dp is the desired planting density (plants 
m−2
), f1 is the viability (fraction), and f2 is the fraction of viable seeds that become 
established plants. Seed mass (pu) can be measured directly by weighing a known 
number of seeds or estimated using Table 16.2, which also shows intervals of Dp for 
various crops. Viability (f1) depends largely on the quality of the seed and is usually 
above 0.9 for certifed seed. The value of f2 depends greatly on the state of the soil 
at planting, sowing depth, and environmental conditions after planting. Under 
adverse conditions, f2 will be proportional to seed size.

16.6 Sowing Depth
The more appropriate sowing depth depends on the temperature and water content 
of the soil. In general, soil water content increases with depth, while temperature 
and oxygen availability decrease. The greater the sowing depth, the greater expan￾sion of the hypocotyl required to reach the soil surface. If the depth is excessive, 
reserves would be exhausted before emergence. Therefore, larger seeds allow 
deeper sowings. Large seeds (faba beans, beans) allow depths up to about 15 cm, 
while the medium-sized seeds (winter cereals, sunfower, cotton) should not exceed 
around 10 cm sowing depth, and small seeds (onion, carrot) allow less than 3 cm. In 
the latter case, it is diffcult to ensure adequate soil water content in the surface 
layer, requiring irrigation for successful emergence.
The rules about sowing depth may show remarkable exceptions. For instance, in 
the dry inland area of the Pacifc Northwest of the USA, winter wheat is sown in late 
summer at depths as large as 20 cm to ensure water supply to the seed and crop 
emergence.
16.7 Planting Pattern and Sowing Method
Crop plants are usually sown in rows at spacings between 0.15 and 0.20 m (cereals, 
rapeseed) and 1 m (e.g., cotton). Wide separations between rows were often required 
for mechanical control of weeds. The use of herbicides has allowed for narrowing 
the inter-row spacing, which contributes to increasing the radiation interception.
In many species, yield is relatively independent of the distance between plants 
(e.g., winter cereals). In some (garlic, beets), excessive crowding can lead to lower 
yield or poor quality of the harvested product.
The sowing method to be used depends on the crop type, soil conditions, and 
available machinery. The methods used are:
(a) Broadcasting: the seeds are randomly distributed in the feld. The application 
can be done by hand, using centrifugal fertilizer broadcasters, or an airplane, as 
in the case of rice. Usually, broadcasting sowing requires further operations to 
bury the seeds and carries a high seed cost, poor distribution uniformity, and 
irregularity in sowing depth.
(b) Sowing in furrows: This is done by opening furrows in the soil and depositing 
the seeds inside, usually performed with a seed drill. This drill has the necessary 
equipment to open the furrow (shoe type, hoe type, or disk), deposit the seeds, 
and close the furrows (plank, disks). In some cases, to allow post-emergence 
tillage and achieve optimum planting density, crop rows are distributed non￾uniformly as in the case of the paired lines, in which the lines are grouped in 
close pairs, separated from the next pair by enough distance to allow inter-row 
tillage operations.
Precision seed drills provide a better distribution of seeds, which saves seed and, in 
some cases, avoids the need for plant thinning (e.g., sugar beet).
16 Sowing and Planting236
16.8 Additional Operations
At the time of sowing, other farming operations that contribute to crop establish￾ment may be performed:
(a) Irrigation: The application of irrigation may be needed to ensure germination 
and emergence. In soils that form surface crust, more than one irrigation appli￾cation may be needed to prevent hardening of the crust.
(b) Tillage: Pre-planting tillage should form a suitable seedbed. This entails small 
aggregates on the surface and suffcient soil water content in the upper layer. In 
some sowing methods, the seed, once deposited in the soil, should be covered 
by harrowing. In other cases, it may be necessary to compact slightly the soil 
surface to ensure water supply to the seed (e.g., roller pass in small seed crops). 
Soil compaction after sowing also contributes to soil warming (Chap. 6) and 
thus to faster emergence.
(c) Fertilizers and pesticides: It is common to apply fertilizers (P, K, and some N) 
and other products (e.g., pesticides) while preparing the seedbed. Some seed 
drills allow localized fertilizer application at sowing time, which can be of 
interest in poor soils, especially for P and K (Chap. 28). Other products (soil 
insecticides, pre-emergence herbicides) may be applied along with the seed.
16.9 Transplanting of Annuals
In the case of some horticultural crops, seedlings are grown at a place (nursery) for 
some time and then transplanted to the feld. The need for transplantation may be 
due to different causes:
(a) High seed cost, poor germination success, and/or delicate seedlings: The condi￾tions in the nursery can be manipulated to provide a suitable environment for 
the seedlings. This can be achieved by soil heating or using plastic or glass cov￾ers. The associated cost will be acceptable in the nursery because of its 
small size.
(b) The need to shorten the cycle: In the nursery, we can maintain proper moisture 
and temperature, hastening the crop cycle when external conditions are 
unfavorable.
The structures used as nurseries range from natural shelters to greenhouses. In the 
nursery, seeds are planted at high density. Seedlings are maintained in the nursery 
until their fnal transplanting to the feld. During that time, some thinning of plants 
may be required to avoid etiolation.
F. J. Villalobos et al.237
16.10 Transplanting and Grafting of Trees
Trees of agricultural interest are usually fruit trees with planting densities ranging 
from 50 to more than 1000 trees/ha. Some species with industrial interest (e.g., rub￾ber tree, cork oak) and ornamental trees and shrubs may be also of commercial 
value. Plantations of fruit trees are established to last for long, typically more than 
15–20 years. Fruit tree species may be evergreen (citrus, olive) or deciduous (pome 
fruits, stone fruits, nuts).
Plantations are established by transplanting young trees grown in nurseries. 
Trees may be planted at any time of the year if temperatures are not too low. 
However, successful establishment requires an adequate balance between root water 
uptake and water loss by transpiration to avoid desiccation and death. The best time 
for planting is autumn when the tree is dormant, the air temperature is low, and the 
soil temperature is still warm, which enhances root growth. Leafess trees of decidu￾ous species may be planted as bare-root trees in autumn or spring. Evergreen spe￾cies have active root systems, so they are transplanted directly from the pots where 
they have grown in the nursery.
A typical limiting factor for tree growth is soil compaction, so breaking any 
compacted soil layers by deep vertical tillage is common practice before 
transplanting.
Although not specifcally planting operations, pruning allows renovating the tree 
structure, while grafting is used to change the cultivar (scion), which constitutes 
most of the tree shoot while keeping the rootstock.

Abstract
Tillage has been developed in farming to improve soil conditions concerning 
water balance and crop growth, to incorporate crop residues, and for weed con￾trol and seedbed preparation. The effects of tillage depend greatly on the water 
content and the soil characteristics. Clay soils are rarely found under more suit￾able conditions for tilling, which are easier to fnd on medium- or coarse-textured 
soils. The main undesirable effects of tillage are soil compaction, which leads 
to lower crop yields and soil degradation, particularly due to water erosion 
(Chap. 18). Erosion of the surface soil layers reduces the natural fertility and 
water retention capacity of soils.
17.1 Introduction
From the point of view of farming, the soil has often been viewed as a mere medium 
on which the crop grows. Thus, soil structure should be suitable for germination of 
seeds and growth of roots and must have characteristics that enhance the storage and 
supply of water, nutrients, gases, and heat to the crop. From this perspective, tillage 
is inseparable from agriculture. The transformation of a natural ecosystem into an 
agroecosystem requires a mechanical intervention on the soil. Since hoe tillage, 
and later the Roman plow, followed the appearance of the moldboard plow and,

fnally, the development of mechanical traction, tillage and crop cultivation have 
been virtually synonymous.
Each soil-crop-climate system presents specifc problems that require different 
tillage operations, which has led to the development of diverse machinery whose 
engineering is well known. Unfortunately, much less is known about the effects of 
tillage on physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and ultimately on the 
effects on crop yield. This limited knowledge is often translated into tillage prac￾tices whose only rationale is the habit or tradition from the times when tillage was 
performed using animal power.
In Western agriculture conventional tillage, which is characterized by a large 
number of operations, using diverse implements and powerful tractors is increas￾ingly challenged by the high cost of energy expenditure and by soil degradation 
resulting in different environmental problems in numerous agricultural areas. The 
rationalization of tillage requires considering the soil as a valuable resource and 
should be based on a better understanding of the effects of tillage on soil properties 
and crop production, which is the objective of this chapter.
17.2 Objectives of Tillage
Traditionally tillage had three main objectives, seedbed preparation, improving soil 
conditions for crop growth, and controlling weeds. However, goals have changed 
with the appearance of new technologies (herbicides, seed drills), new issues or 
problems (compaction, erosion, offsite contamination), and a better understanding 
of the relevance of some soil functions (such as carbon sink or natural flter of 
water). In rainfed agriculture, tillage is also an essential tool to modify water bal￾ance to improve the availability of water for the crop.
17.2.1 Seedbed Preparation
This is a process that often requires the removal of the residues of previous crops. 
Removal can be done by burning the residues or burying them with certain opera￾tions. The burning of stubble is a fast and cheap method that has been widely used 
in the past and has some clear advantages, such as elimination of weed seeds, 
destruction of propagules of pathogens and insect eggs and larvae, and immediate 
release of some nutrients. But burning causes a loss of organic matter and N (lost as 
volatile N oxides), contributing to air pollution and anthropogenic CO2 emissions. 
It also promotes soil degradation and increases wildfre risk.
After clearing the residues, we can prepare the seedbed, which ideally consists of 
a surface layer of granular structure with a high percentage of aggregates smaller 
than the seed. In general, this objective is achieved only when tillage is performed 
with a soil water content close to feld capacity and is called optimum soil water 
content for tillage (OPT, e.g., Dexter & Bird, 2001) (see Sect. 17.3). In some cases, 
it is necessary to compact slightly the seedbed with a roller compactor to enhance 
J. A. Gómez et al.241
seed-soil contact and hydration of the seeds. Furthermore, below the depth of plant￾ing, the soil must have a lower bulk density to allow root growth without restric￾tions, which is often achieved by previous deeper tillage.
17.2.2 Weed Control
Before the advent of herbicides, tillage was the only effective method for control￾ling weeds. The control may be direct by destroying the plants, cutting the roots or 
the stem, or burying them. The control may be indirect, by changing the position of 
weed propagules or changing the environmental conditions of the weed seed bank. 
For example, the moldboard plow buries many seeds below a certain depth, making 
them unable to emerge. In other cases, such as weeds that propagate through under￾ground organs (tubers, rhizomes), tillage contributes to cutting such organs and 
therefore enhances the dispersion of the weed when the soil is wet, but it may have 
the opposite effect when the soil is dry as the weed propagules would desiccate.
In this tillage strategy for controlling weeds, it is essential to till immediately 
before planting to minimize weed-crop competition. This operation can reduce the 
water content of the seedbed and therefore cause poor seedling emergence in dry 
areas. This occurs, for example, in spring sown rainfed sunfower. This negative 
effect can be solved by replacing the tillage operation with a pre-plant herbicide 
application.
In those crops for which there are no selective herbicides or when they are not 
very effective against the weed community, inter-row tillage operations will be 
required after crop emergence. Although it is possible to control weeds only with 
tillage, herbicide use, at least partially, is often a much more effective alternative in 
terms of cost and time.
17.2.3 Modification of Water Balance
In rainfed crops, the main objective of tillage is to improve water balance to maxi￾mize the availability of water for the crop. In a natural ecosystem, with the soil 
covered by vegetation, the macropores formed by the roots and mesofauna allow 
high and stable infltration rates even at relatively high bulk density. The situation is 
very different in an agroecosystem as seedbed preparation involves the traffc of 
machinery and the surface of the soil is kept bare. This kind of tillage results in a 
low bulk density but in a pore system in which many of the pores are less stable than 
the macropores formed by vegetation or soil fauna or are even occluded with no 
connection to the soil surface (Fig. 17.1). In this situation, the impact of raindrops 
breaks soil aggregates and causes the sealing of pores, thus reducing the infltration 
rate. This is reversed after tilling, by breaking the surface crust and increasing soil 
porosity and surface roughness, but the effect is temporary, and the infltration rate 
is reduced after new rain events occur. The velocity of the surface sealing process 
depends not only on the amount of precipitation but also on soil characteristics,

especially its structure (closely related to soil texture and organic matter content), 
being at its best state in undisturbed natural soils under grassland or forest plant cover.
Tillage thus serves to break the surface crust but also increases porosity, which 
improves water retention capacity and aeration, which in turn favors root growth.
In many rainfed areas, farmers consider tillage an effective method for reducing 
evaporation from the soil surface (Es). Indeed, in soils prone to cracking, sealing the 
surface cracks by tillage helps reduce Es. Large cracks increase evaporation in rela￾tively deep sections of the subsurface soil in desert areas provided that transport of 
pore water from the sediment matrix to the crack walls is not a limiting factor. This 
would explain the adoption of inter-row cultivator passes in summer crops (e.g., 
cotton) in expansive soils. In many cases, however, tillage may increase soil evapo￾ration. Evaporation from a dry soil surface is small (second-stage evaporation). If 
the soil is tilled, the dry surface layer mixes with moist soil from below, thus increas￾ing evaporation. In Fig. 10.3 (Chap. 10), an increase in evaporation on day 157 was 
due to a pass of cultivator for weed control. In the long run, the impact of tillage on 
Es is limited as most of the Es takes place before the tractor with its tillage imple￾ments can enter the feld. Thus, except for expansive soils, the effect of any tillage 
system on soil evaporation has much less impact on the water balance than on 
infltration.
17.2.4 Other Goals
Tillage can serve other purposes such as modifcation of energy balance or incorpo￾ration of fertilizers or soil amendments. For instance, the reduction of bulk density 
and soil water content after tilling increases thermal diffusivity, which favors a 
faster warming of soil surface.
Sometimes, we fnd some tillage practices whose objectives are unclear and may 
be due more to tradition or aesthetic reasons. Traditionally, good farmers kept their 
felds “clean” of weeds at all times by excessive tillage and the adoption of unsus￾tainable practices.
J. A. Gómez et al.243
17.3 Influence of Soil Water Content on the Effects of Tillage
The energy required for tilling the soil and the effects of tillage depends on the soil 
water content. In medium- or fne-textured soils, the cohesive strength of soil aggre￾gates decreases with increasing water content. The adhesion forces between the soil 
and the tools increase with water content up to a maximum, in which soil passes 
from the plastic, i.e., moldable, to the liquid state. In the liquid state, tillage causes 
the dispersion of the soil particles, and the soil loses its structure. The coherent state 
of the soil occurs with low water content and does not allow deformations without 
breaking of the aggregates. In this state, tillage generates large blocks of aggregates 
(lumps) with large gaps between them. Between the coherent and the plastic state, 
there is a point in which the sum of both adhesion and cohesion forces is minimal, 
which occurs with a medium content of water below the upper limit. At this state, 
called optimum soil water content for tillage (OPT), the soil crumbles after tillage 
(Fig. 17.2).
The water content of the soil not only determines the effects of tillage on soil 
conditions but also the degree of soil compaction due to the traffc of machinery. 
Soil compaction occurs mainly in the plastic state, but it is not likely to be important 
in drier soil, since in this case, the force causes breakage of aggregates. Within the 
plastic state, two zones may be distinguished above and below the adhesion point: 
above that point, the soil will adhere to a smooth surface cutting it, as is the case 
with implements. This implies a high energy expenditure for tilling and the danger 
of cementation once the soil dries.
The best condition for tilling occurs in a range of water contents below feld 
capacity. This occurs approximately 2–3 days after rain or irrigation for medium￾textured soils. In this zone, the energy required for tillage is minimal, and a granular 
structure is achieved, which is desirable for the seedbed, while the risk of compac￾tion is moderate. Medium- and sandy-textured soils drain well and have a narrow 
plastic state, so they move quickly to the plastic state and reach the OPT soon after

rain or irrigation, staying that way for a long time. That state, however, is not easy 
to achieve in clay soils where drainage is slow and the plastic state interval is wide. 
If we till in that state, the soil is cut into slices, which get extremely hard when dry 
and the tillage operation barely increases soil porosity. Besides, the risk of compac￾tion is maximum when soil is tilled in the plastic state. To promote drainage in clay 
soils, it is necessary to till before the rainy season. Only so will it be possible to get 
a proper moisture condition before planting. The drawback is that tilling in the dry 
season, when the soil is in coherent state, requires much energy and generates large 
clods that must be disaggregated by additional secondary tillage operations. That 
subsequent disaggregation can be very diffcult when rainfall is low. The disadvan￾tages of tilling when the soil is dry do not occur in sandy soils as they do not show 
a coherent state.
17.4 Conventional Tillage
Maintenance of the infltration rate, weed control, and seedbed preparation 
requires several tillage operations that vary widely across geographic areas, soil 
types, and crops. This set of operations, which we call conventional tillage, can be 
classifed according to different criteria. In conventional agriculture, it is common 
to distinguish between primary and secondary operations. The primary operations 
are performed with a moldboard plow or a disc plow sometime after harvest and 
serve to incorporate crop residues and improve soil conditions. The moldboard 
plow cuts, lifts, and turns the soil down to 40  cm deep at most. This process 
improves infltration, incorporates crop residues, and buries the weed seed bank. 
For the rupture of compacted deep layers, subsoilers are used, which can achieve 
greater depths (60–70 cm), performing a vertical cut so that residues are not incor￾porated. Subsoilers have replaced the moldboard plows in many areas, leaving 
50–80% of the residues on the soil. The chisel plow performs a similar but shal￾lower (less than 30 cm) vertical tillage than the subsoilers.
Secondary tasks are performed with harrows, cultivators, and other imple￾ments, affecting only the top 10–20 cm of the soil. They serve to refne the soil 
before sowing (reducing the size of the aggregates on the surface) and to control 
weeds. The primary operations often result in large aggregates, which are then 
broken down by harrowing. The fner structure is achieved with cultivators, also 
used for weed control before and after sowing (passes between rows). To fnish 
the shredding of the aggregates and/or for compacting the soil surface layers, vari￾ous tools can be used (e.g., compactor, harrow tines).
Example 17.1
Sunfower conventional tillage in a wheat-sunfower rotation in a Mediterranean 
area. After burning the wheat stubble in summer, a moldboard pass results in 
large aggregates and many gaps. After the frst rains, we may use a cultivator 
or a disk harrow to reduce the size of the aggregates. Then two additional

17.5 Compaction and Plow Pan
Compacted layers may be due to natural causes (e.g., petrocalcic horizons), but it is 
a widespread phenomenon due to tillage. Compaction can occur in the uppermost 
soil layer (a few mm) due to the impact of rain. This surface crust hinders seedling 
emergence, especially if the soil is dry, and reduces infltration (Fig. 17.3). Secondary 
tillage favors the formation of surface crusts when it leaves fne aggregates on the 
surface.
Another kind of compacted horizon may appear within the soil profle, which not 
only delays or prevents the growth of the root system but also leads to reduced 
growth of the aerial part of the plant and fnally, to yield losses (Fig. 17.4), even 
when the supply of water and nutrients is not limited. Figure 17.5 shows the rela￾tionship between penetration resistance and soil water content for loamy soil with 
or without compaction. As penetration resistance of 3.2 MPa reduces root growth 
strongly, the growth conditions for roots in the compacted soil were greatly 
restricted. Compaction has other side effects such as waterlogging, which promotes 
denitrifcation (see Chap. 24), root anoxia, and a higher incidence of soil diseases 
(e.g., Phytophthora).
Compaction is caused by the weight of the implements (plow, disk) at the depth 
on which they act resulting in a plow pan and/or by the wheels of the tractor or other 
machines that compact the entire surface horizon. In either case, the magnitude of 
the compaction depends on the pressure applied (regulated by axel load and tire

cultivator passes are needed in autumn-winter to remove weeds and another 
before planting. Additionally, one can have 1–2 cultivator passes between 
rows to control weeds during the campaign. Tillage costs in this case may 
account for over 60% of the total production costs of the sunfower crop.

type and pressure) and the water content of the soil at the time of the operation; thus, 
traffc should be avoided if the soil is in the plastic state. This is why compaction 
risk is very high in clay soils where the plastic state promotes the transmission of 
compaction in depth. By contrast, in medium-textured soils, the risk of compaction 
is lower and generates a compacted layer below the tilled depth (Fig. 17.1). This is 
why subsoiling to relieve compaction problems is more effective in medium￾textured soils than in clay soils.

Abstract
Tillage is used to improve soil conditions for water storage and crop growth, 
incorporate crop residues, control weeds, and prepare the seedbed. However, till￾age and other bare soil management systems using herbicides signifcantly 
increase the risk of soil erosion. These problems have led to the development of 
conservation tillage techniques that typically rely on keeping plant residues on 
the ground and reducing tillage operations. When conservation tillage is com￾bined with crop rotations or cover crops in woody crops, it is termed conserva￾tion agriculture. Conservation tillage usually requires herbicides and, in the case 
of annual crops, specifc direct drills for sowing. The transition from conven￾tional to conservation tillage is dynamic and should be gradual as different prob￾lems may arise as the adoption progresses (e.g., compaction). In this case, 
sporadic tillage or controlled traffc could then be adopted. In woody crops, there 
are some options for soil conservation, such as introducing no-tillage and cover 
crops controlled by herbicide or mowing. In tree orchards in the Mediterranean 
region, conservation agriculture may be implemented with temporary cover 
crops that protect the soil during the rainy season and are killed in the early 
spring to avoid competition for water with the trees.

18.1 Introduction
Soil erosion is the main threat to the sustainability of agricultural systems in many 
parts of the world. The development of powerful tractors in the last century allowed 
rapid mechanization of tillage operations but also resulted in a reduction of ground 
cover by vegetation and stubble, a decrease in soil organic matter, and a deteriora￾tion of soil structure and, therefore, in an increased risk of water and wind soil ero￾sion. The “Dust Bowl” period in the USA in the 1930s exemplifes the relevance of 
this problem.
Conserving the soil in agricultural lands is not straightforward. Success requires 
adapting new management practices to local conditions and considering costs and 
proftability. The recommended approach is to develop a good understanding of the 
system and monitor the adoption of practices for conservation tillage, aimed at min￾imum soil disturbance, maintenance of soil cover with vegetation and/or residues, 
and spatiotemporal diversifcation of cropping systems.
18.2 Soil Erosion
Erosion is the process of soil loss. Firstly, energy is required to remove the particles, 
and then some transport medium will be needed. The energy is obtained from the 
impact of raindrops and the transfer of momentum from water (surface runoff) or 
wind, although at the hillslope scale, the energy is also provided by gravity, which 
moves downslope soil particles destabilized by tillage (called tillage erosion). The 
transport medium will be the fuid (water or air). Water erosion is proportional to 
runoff, the difference between precipitation and infltration (Chap. 8) and a param￾eter (Erodibility) that refects the ease with which the soil is eroded. Erodibility 
depends mostly on the soil’s structural stability, which is related to the organic mat￾ter content and soil texture. In degraded silty soils with poor soil aggregation and 
low infltration, soil erodibility is the highest.
Erosion has two major effects on the agricultural system: soil loss results in a 
decrease in soil depth, which in turn involves a reduction of the water storage capac￾ity, and therefore a reduction in long-term yield. Moreover, the surface soil lost is 
often the richest in nutrients; thus, erosion involves a loss of fertility (and yield 
potential) and causes an environmental problem (sediment and pollutants accumu￾late in surface waters). Unfortunately, erosion is hard to control as it is ephemeral 
and, often, occurs in a few episodes of torrential rain. In any case, excessive tillage 
destroys the soil structure and keeps its surface exposed to wind and rain for pro￾longed periods, making it the leading cause of erosion in many agricultural systems. 
Although tillage initially increases water infltration, its effect is temporary, and in 
some silty fne-texture soils, it can favor the rapid formation of surface crust after 
the subsequent rainfall. This illustrates the paradox of keeping bare soil free of 
weeds with tillage, as a viable and safe short-term solution, while irreversibly reduc￾ing the productivity of soils.
On a larger scale, erosion is a process with feedback: soil loss implies a reduction 
of vegetation that favors intensifed erosion, which fnally leads to desertifcation. 
H. Gomez-Macpherson et al.251
This process, the loss of vegetation and water bodies of dryland regions, advancing 
in some areas, is fueled by soil erosion.
Several methods have been proposed to quantify soil erosion, among which the 
most popular is USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) and its revised version, 
RUSLE (Renard et al., 1997). Both were designed to predict the effect of different 
soil management on average annual erosion rates at the hillslope scale from empiri￾cal factors that can be calibrated from physically based variables. According to the 
RUSLE, the average soil loss by erosion (SLE, t/ha/year) is calculated as the product 
of six factors:
SLE R = K L S C P (18.1)
When using USLE/RUSLE, a major source of confusion is units, as some sources 
use the International System (SI) and others the Imperial. It is necessary to ensure 
that when using Eq. 18.1, all the non-dimensionless factors (R and K) are in a coher￾ent set of units. In this chapter, all factors are in the SI. The factor R (MJ mm 
ha−1
 h−1
 year−1
) is the average annual rainfall erosivity, which is a measurement of 
the rainfall energy available for water erosion; it depends on the amount and inten￾sity of the rainfall, and its calculation is explained in detail by Renard et al. (1997). 
Several equations can be used as a regional approximation, such as Eq. 18.2 for the 
USA, based on the monthly rainfall distribution (Bergsma, 1981. ITC Journal 
4:460–483):

where Pi is the precipitation (mm) of month i and Py is the annual precipitation in 
mm. Nevertheless, databases and maps are available to determine the average R in 
any agricultural area of the world.
K is the soil erodibility factor, soil loss that would occur in standard conditions, 
that is, if the land is kept as clean fallow, and has a slope of 9% and a length of 22 m. 
It depends on soil texture, soil organic matter, soil structure, and infltration class. 
Suggested values of K appear in Table 18.1.
L and S are factors that include the effect of the slope length (L) and steepness 
(S). In its most basic form, L and S are combined to represent the ratio of erosion in 
a given situation and that happening in standard conditions (22 m long, 9% slope), 
and their product is calculated as:

where pt is the slope (%) of the land, lt is the length (m), and NT is a factor that 
depends on the slope (Table 18.1).
C is the factor that refects the effect of cover and management and their interac￾tion with the rainfall erosivity distribution during the year. Its proper calculation 
requires calibration of several subfactors (see Renard et al., 1997). It can be approx￾imated from tables developed for local management and climate conditions as pre￾sented in Table 18.1.

Finally, the factor P indicates the effect of conservation practices on erosion 
control (Table 18.1) such as contour plow or terraces.
The value calculated using Eq. 18.1 is compared with the tolerable soil loss rate 
(Table 18.2). This is the maximum erosion rate tolerable before the soil productivity 
is severely affected in the medium term. This tolerable level is higher than the natu￾ral rate of soil formation or the threshold to reduce water quality in the streams

Example 18.1
Let us calculate the average soil erosion on a farm in Flint, Michigan, with 5% 
average slope and slope length 50 m. The soil is loam with average OM (2%), 
and the crop is a rotation of maize and soybean with moldboard plow in the 
fall, which is made on contour.
Monthly rainfall values are:
Month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12
Precipitation mm 35 32 55 75 67 81 69 89 90 55 66 53 53
Therefore, rainfall erosivity is:
R P = ( ) 4 17 ( ) i P 152 10 = 1360 2 . / Σ −
Now, in Table 18.1, we see that for a loam soil with medium OM content 
K = 0.034 and with slope 5%, NT = 0.4. As pt = 5 and lt = 50, we can calculate 
the product LS as:

According to Table 18.1, with contour tillage, we have P = 0.5, and the 
maize-soybean rotation with fall plow has C = 0.39. Therefore, the estimated

According to Table 18.2, this value is tolerable. However, for this specifc

) would be classifed as moderate.
receiving the sediments from the felds. The tolerance level varies depending on the 
type and depth of the soil. Deep soils not previously eroded are assumed to have a 
higher tolerable soil loss rate than shallow and/or previously eroded soils.
18 Soil Conservation254
18.3 Conservation Tillage
As discussed above, conventional tillage has several disadvantages:
(a) The increased infltration due to tillage is only temporary and promotes a sur￾face crust for some soil types.
(b) The traffc of machinery and tillage implements can lead to soil compaction and 
a subsurface plow pan.
(c) Tillage prevents the accumulation of organic matter in the soil surface, which is 
necessary to protect the soil and stabilize its aggregate structure. Organic matter 
generates aggregating agents (especially polysaccharides) that promote the 
cohesion of the aggregates.
(d) Tillage has high economic and energetic costs and promotes the emission of 
greenhouse gases from soils. The use of fossil fuels also contributes to anthro￾pogenic CO2 emissions.
(e) Tillage favors erosion, although some operations may temporarily reduce it 
and runoff.
All these disadvantages, plus the emergence of new technologies, have driven the 
search for alternative systems for managing agricultural soils. These systems range 
from reducing the number of operations (reduced tillage) to eliminating tillage (no 
tillage). However, not all of them contribute to soil conservation. To avoid confu￾sion, conservation tillage was defned by ASAE in 2005 as tillage operations (or no 
tillage) that leave enough residues to cover 30% of the surface after sowing and at 
least 110  g/m2
 of organic material during the critical periods of erosion risk. 
Conservation agriculture (CA), as defned by FAO in 2016, adds a third component 
to minimum soil disturbance and maintenance of residues: the use of more than one 
crop in the rotation.
Adopting CA by farmers is not straightforward, and the dynamic and complex 
interactions limit acceptability in Europe. The CA effects on the system perfor￾mance and interactions will be discussed while considering its adoption in three 
main steps (Fig. 18.1) (1) changing from conventional to no tillage, (2) maintaining 
a mulch on the ground, and (3) introducing a crop rotation. Some changes have 
immediate effects, while others appear in the long term only, particularly those 
related to soil characteristics. These long-term benefts are hardly appreciated 
by farmers unless they have good knowledge and understanding of the system. 
There is not a single recipe for a successful CA system, and it usually requires an 
adaptation process and special attention to solve problems as they appear.
Step 1. Switching from conventional tillage to no tillage. Simply ceasing to dis￾turb the soil can have more negative than positive effects on crop productivity. A 
major concern is the impossibility of decompacting the plow layer, particularly 
when heavy direct-drill seeders enter a feld with wet soil. Compacted soil will 
reduce root and shoot growth, whereas compacted superfcial soil will result in

effects, respectively, on yield drivers and component attributes. A dotted line indicates a benefcial

Ecosys Environ 187:11–32)
lower water infltration and soil water content; waterlogging and even seedling 
death may then occur. Another major concern when adopting no tillage is the poten￾tial increase of weeds, diseases, and pests. Adopting no tillage requires attentive 
weed control, especially when perennial weeds appear. On the other hand, a major 
advantage of no tillage is the possibility of entering earlier in the feld for sowing. 
This is particularly relevant to adjusting the crop to a narrow cropping season win￾dow or for crop sequence intensifcation, e.g., allowing two crops per season.
Traffc of agriculture machinery, like heavy drills or harvesters, leads to soil 
compaction, particularly when the soil is wet. The introduction of controlled traffc
will reduce this problem. Controlled traffc implies that wheels will pass over the 
same tracks in all operations while the crop is grown in the non-traffcked zone. 
Wheels operate then more effciently on this frm soil. In CA systems, the adoption 
of controlled traffc can minimize the negative impact of compaction on crop 
performance and soil water infltration (Fig. 18.2). Nevertheless, occasional deep 
ripping or subsoiling of the traffc tracks may be needed. The success and costs of 
adopting controlled traffc will depend on the possibilities of adapting the machin￾ery and the accessibility to GPS guidance.

without (−T) traffc
Example 18.2
In Southern Spain, a ridge planting system combined with controlled traffc 
has been developed successfully to deal with soil compaction and excessive 
residues produced by an irrigated maize-cotton rotation (Boulal and Gomez￾Macpherson, 2010. Agric Ecosyst Environ 139: 284–292). Irrigation was 
applied from a central pivot, but ridges were formed to facilitate controlled 
traffc and to have residues in the furrows rather than on the beds where crops 
are sown. Applied irrigation was reduced by 17% since the introduction of the 
system, without yield loss, but most importantly to the farmer, the costs were 
also reduced.
H. Gomez-Macpherson et al.257
Step 2. Mulching. Most negative effects derived from no tillage may be offset by 
maintaining crop residues on the soil surface after harvest (Fig. 18.1). As discussed 
in the previous section, crop residues on the ground protect the soil from the direct 
impact of rain and wind. The presence of decomposing plant material from the pre￾vious crop also favors the structural stability of the soil surface layers and thus 
reduces erosion. Another positive effect of maintaining residues is the increased 
surface roughness, which implies an increase in the water held on the surface that is 
retained until it infltrates. In the longer term (2–5 years), leaving crop residues and 
roots of previous crops without disturbing the soil can increase soil organic matter 
content and the activity of the soil mesofauna (generating macropores) and the soil 
fora, which are further enhanced as surface temperature fuctuations are reduced. 
All these processes contribute to the improvement of infltration. Furthermore, the 
favorable microclimate near the soil surface promotes the proliferation of roots that 
will compete for water with direct evaporation from the soil surface.
The effect of residues on evaporation from the soil surface depends on the fre￾quency of rainfall events. If they are frequent, the soil is kept in evaporation stage 1 
(Chap. 9), so the residues will reduce evaporation in proportion to the radiation they 
intercept, although it will depend also on the amount and capacity of residues to 
retain water. If rainfall is infrequent, the soil remains in phase 2 (limited by hydrau￾lic conductivity), so the presence of residues has little effect on evaporation. If the 
amount of residues is suffcient to cover the ground, the water balance is expected 
to improve due to enhanced rainfall infltration and, to a lesser extent, less evapora￾tion. The improvement of yields due to CA (relative to conventional tillage) is 
higher in rainfed systems of semiarid zones than in other environments where water 
is not limiting.
Maintaining residues may also have negative short-term effects on plant growth 
(Fig. 18.1). In the initial phase of adopting no-tillage and mulching, high amounts 
of residues may result in N immobilization. More N fertilizer will then be required 
to compensate for the immobilization until soil fertility is increased and the system 
is balanced. Additionally, non-mobile soil nutrients, like phosphorus, cannot be 
incorporated into the soil unless the fertilizer is placed next to seeds during sowing. 
Residues also reduce radiation absorption by the soil, delaying soil warming during 
the early establishment of spring crops when temperatures are low. In the tropics, 
lower temperatures may beneft nutrient cycling and plant growth. Leaving residues 
on the ground also requires specifc drills to sow through them and makes diffcult 
food or furrow irrigation or herbicide application.
Step 3. Crop rotation. In CA, crop rotation has the main role of facilitating weed 
control and reducing the risk of pests and diseases (Fig. 18.1), particularly in the 
soil. For example, in Australia, higher incidences of soil-borne fungal diseases were 
observed in no-tilled wheat monoculture systems. However, the incidence decreased 
when rapeseed was included in the rotation. The crop rotation can also help main￾tain the optimum amount of residues in the system by alternating high- and low￾residue-producing crops, which is particularly relevant under irrigation.
There are differential responses to tillage systems in the different agricultural 
areas. No tillage reduces crop yields as compared to conventional tillage, but the 
difference decreases if residues are maintained. While CA has been widely adopted 
18 Soil Conservation258
in North and South America, it has been scarcely adopted in Europe (except for 
cover crops in orchards). The reasons limiting CA adoption in Central and Northern 
Europe include technical problems with crop establishment in cold and wet soils, 
high natural organic matter content of many soils, fat topography, and low erosion 
risk, and management problems with crop residues and weed control.
The transition from conventional tillage to conservation tillage should be a grad￾ual process, and adjustments will be needed to cope with the specifc problems of 
the soil and crops and techniques to be adopted. For instance, no tillage has fewer 
problems adapting to medium- or light-textured soils because of their lower risk of 
compaction, while in heavy clay soils, it may aggravate soil compaction and cause 
yield reductions. Furthermore, in heavy soils, no tillage seeders may leave the sow￾ing furrow slightly open, which results in poor seed-soil contact. These problems 
can be solved in part by changes in the implements of the seeder. For example, in 
strip tillage, several blades can be installed to prepare a 10-cm-wide band of soil in 
front of the sowing boot favoring the seed contact with the soil. This system also 
allows the localized application of P and K fertilizers in the same strips and the 
Example 18.3: Some CA Systems Around the World
Rice-wheat cropping system in the Gangetic Plains. Rice is the main crop 
grown during the monsoon period. In the conventional system, rice stubble is 
removed or burned after harvest, and the soil is then prepared for sowing 
wheat. This preparation usually takes 2–3 weeks, which in turn causes the 
wheat crop to be sown later than the optimum period for avoiding high tem￾peratures during fowering and grain flling. However, in the CA system, 
thanks to the direct seeder, wheat can be sown the day after rice harvest and 
through the remaining stubble, thus advancing sowing time and increasing 
grain yield. Wheat crops are irrigated, and soil moisture facilitates root growth 
in the compacted soil.
Maize-based and soybean-based cropping systems in North and South 
America. The adoption of glyphosate-resistant transgenic maize and soybean 
cultivars has greatly improved weed control, a major limitation in CA 
systems. In these cultivars, the total herbicide can be applied after crop 
establishment without major damage. The CA expansion in America has been 
accompanied by the manufacture of machinery adapted to the demands of 
local farmers.
Wheat-based cropping system in Australia. Over the past decades, most 
Australian wheat farmers have adopted conservation agriculture practices. 
Adapted rotations including break crops and improved fertilization and 
weed control. Farmers have a fexible vision and can perform sporadic 
targeted tillage or crop residue removal. Part of the success derives from the 
innovative and adaptive capacity of farmers, researchers, advisors, and 
industry.

warming of that area without residues as radiation can reach the soil surface (impor￾tant in cold conditions).
In ridge tillage or permanent bed planting (Fig. 18.3), the soil is left undisturbed 
from harvest to planting except for nutrient injection. Ridges are rebuilt annually. 
Planting is completed in a seedbed prepared on ridges with sweeps, disk openers, 
coulters, or row cleaners. Residues are left on the surface between ridges. Weed 
control is accomplished with herbicides and/or light cultivation. The beds or ridges, 
on which the rows of plants are sown, have the advantage of drying sooner and 
warming faster in spring.
18.4 Soil Conservation Systems in Orchards and Vineyards
In permanent woody crops, the objectives of soil management differ from those in 
arable crops because sowing is not required. Traditionally, tillage in orchards tar￾geted the elimination of weeds, incorporation of fertilizers, and improvement of 
water balance. The wide availability of herbicides or mowers to control weeds 
allows conservation agriculture techniques that enhance ground cover and restrict 
tillage while ensuring an adequate water balance and erosion control.
Soil management options used in orchards can be summarized as follows:
– Conventional tillage. It maintains the soil bare by periodic surface tillage (cultivator, 
disc harrow) to increase infltration and control weeds. It is the system used 
traditionally and is still widespread in rainfed orchards (olive, almond, vineyards). 
18 Soil Conservation260
This has a broad variability depending on the number and timing of the tillage 
operations and the tools used. This system tends to generate compaction, keeps 
soil organic matter low, and increases erosion risk.
– Minimum tillage. The weeds are controlled with herbicides. Tillage operations 
are limited to a cultivator pass in summer-autumn to improve infltration.
– No-tillage with bare soil. The soil is kept bare by using herbicides. In the long 
term, infltration is reduced due to unavoidable traffc (application of herbicides 
and fertilizers and harvesting). For rainfed systems, the lower infltration reduces 
soil water availability and, thus, yield. In sloping areas, no tillage favors gully 
erosion due to higher runoff coeffcients.
– Permanent cover crops. A cover crop is sown, or the weed community is man￾aged by periodic mowing when needed. It is not advisable in dry areas, due to the 
competition for water with the trees.
– Temporary cover crops. Cover crops may be sown (degraded soils with a depleted 
seed bank) or generated by the weed community. In Mediterranean conditions, 
the cover crop is established in the fall before the rainy season and removed early 
in the spring to prevent competition for water during spring and summer. This 
can be done by tillage, herbicides, or mowing, with the residues serving as a 
mulch until the next fall. Mowing may be performed more than once during the 
season depending on the rainfall patterns. Cover crops can occupy the whole area 
or just part of it (cover crops in strips).
The date of removal of the cover crop should be late enough to protect it from 
erosion by rainfall and early enough to prevent excessive use of soil water. Delaying 
the removal also allows seed production to improve the soil seed bank. The right 
date is not easy to determine as it depends on many factors (actual rainfall, tree 
water use, fraction area covered by cover crop). The analysis may be performed 
using simulation models like the results shown in Fig.  18.4 obtained using 
OliveCan.

Luciano Mateos
Abstract
Irrigation methods are classifed into surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and 
localized irrigation (drip/micro irrigation). Surface irrigation uses gravity: the 
water is distributed over the feld as it infltrates. With sprinkler irrigation, water 
is distributed across the feld using pressurized pipes and sprinkled over the soil 
through nozzles. Drip/micro-irrigation systems are conceived to localize the 
water to parts of the feld and apply it frequently. The factors to be considered 
when selecting an irrigation method are project goals (maximizing economic 
return, minimizing investment cost, conserving water, and water quality), institu￾tional and social site conditions (fnancial, labor availability, durability, and 
robustness), and physical site conditions (soil and topography).
19.1 Introduction
The history of irrigation parallels that of agriculture. Irrigation has been practiced 
for more than 5000 years and was essential to early civilizations that developed in 
arid and semiarid environments, where irrigation makes the difference between the 
viability and non-viability of agriculture. Also in Mediterranean or sub-humid envi￾ronments, where rainfall is limited or non-uniformly distributed, irrigation is 
responsible for an important part of the crop production. An estimated 17% of 
global cultivated land is irrigated and produces about 40% of the world’s food.

The twentieth century experienced a dramatic expansion of world irrigation. The 
area equipped for irrigation worldwide is 308 million ha of which 83% were irri￾gated around the year 2005. These fgures represent about a sevenfold increase from 
the beginning of the twentieth century. Sixty-two percent of the area equipped for 
irrigation uses surface water, while 38% uses groundwater, and only 0.1% uses non￾conventional water sources. About 70 % of the irrigation area is in Asia and 17% in 
America. The largest continuous areas of high irrigation concentration are along the 
rivers Ganges and Indus; in the Hai He, Huang He, and Yangtze basins in China; 
along the Nile River in Egypt and Sudan; and in the Mississippi-Missouri river 
basin in North America. Zones of high irrigation density in Europe are along the 
Danube and Po rivers. The 3.8 Mha of land irrigated in Spain is concentrated along 
the main river plains, the Mediterranean coast, and over aquifers in the central 
plateau.
Agriculture is the largest water-use sector worldwide, accounting for about 70% 
of water withdrawals from rivers and aquifers and 90% of consumptive water uses. 
The development of irrigated agriculture has boosted agricultural yields and con￾tributed to price stability, making it possible to feed the world’s growing population. 
The future of agriculture in many countries relies on the possibility of maintaining, 
improving, and expanding the irrigated area. However, irrigation is facing increas￾ing competition from domestic and industrial sectors as the pressure on water 
resources increases, to the point that in many regions, it is becoming a threat to the 
environment. To fully understand some of the irrigation management practices 
described in Chaps. 20 and 21, it is essential that the reader reviews the main fea￾tures of the different approaches, methods, and equipment used in irrigated 
agriculture.
19.2 Classification of Irrigation Systems
The earliest irrigation was by gravity diversion (from natural streams) and from 
water lifters powered by humans, animals, or the fow of water. On-farm irrigation 
systems were supplied either directly from the water source or through channels 
supplying several farms. Water moved by gravity over the soil surface is conducted 
by the irrigator to the crop plants or spread over level basins limited by small ridges.
Water distribution systems from the source to the farms use gravity or are pres￾surized with pumps. They can be collective or serve single farms. Pressurized sys￾tems use pipes while gravity systems use mainly open channels. The source of 
supply may be surface water, groundwater, or both (conjunctive use). A variety of 
surface irrigation methods, sprinkle, and drip/micro-systems are used for the appli￾cation of water to the felds.
In collective distribution systems, delivery schedules determine when each 
farmer will receive water and how much, thus affecting on-farm irrigation opera￾tions and performance. The delivery schedules may be on-demand, arranged, and 
fxed rotation. Under on-demand delivery, the user decides when to irrigate, how 
L. Mateos265
much water to apply, and for how long. It is typical of modern pressurized systems. 
Under fxed rotation, fow rate, frequency, and duration are fxed by the water 
authority or agreed upon within the farmers’ community. Under arranged schedules, 
rate, frequency, and/or duration are arranged between the farmer and the water sup￾ply agency.
Irrigation can be applied to the land in several ways. The choice depends upon 
many factors, including topography, economics, crop type, soil type, water avail￾ability, farming practices, and others. The following major categories of on-farm 
systems cover most of the variation:
– Surface irrigation
– Sprinkler irrigation
– Localized irrigation (drip/micro-irrigation)
A fourth, less common, category is sub-surface irrigation, which consists of 
maintaining a saturated water table within reach of the crop roots.
Surface irrigation (also referred to as food irrigation) consists of the application 
and distribution of water over the feld by gravity, wetting the entire soil surface or 
most of it. The distinguishing feature of this irrigation method is that water moves 
over the same medium where it infltrates to fll the crop root zone. The rate of infl￾tration and its spatial distribution are therefore controlled by the soil characteristics. 
This feature makes it diffcult to apply small depths of water; thus, surface irrigation 
is typically applied at long (from 1  week to more than 1  month) time intervals. 
Although the area of surface irrigation is decreasing, it is by far the most common 
form of irrigation throughout the world, accounting for about 70% of the total irri￾gated area.
Sprinkler irrigation consists of the application of water similar to how rainfall 
occurs. Water is distributed across the feld through a system of pressurized pipes. It 
is then sprayed into the air to wet the entire soil surface. The spray heads (sprin￾klers) break up the water fow into small water drops that fall onto the ground.
Drip/micro-irrigation systems apply water directly where the plant is growing, 
wetting only a small part of the soil surface and sometimes only part of the root 
zone. This is why localized irrigation is another term for this method. Water is dis￾tributed to the water emission outlets through polyethylene pipes; thus, the irriga￾tion system needs to be pressurized. Water application is generally at a low fow 
rate, in small amounts, and, frequently, to keep a high water content in the wetted 
zones. The water may be applied either above or below the soil surface.
Sprinkler and drip/trickle irrigation are expanding, with current areas of about 
20% and 5% of the global irrigated area, respectively. The shift from surface to pres￾surized systems is being faster in countries like Spain, where surface, sprinkler, and 
localized irrigation systems account now for 31, 22, and 47% of the total irrigated 
area, respectively.
19 Irrigation Systems266
19.3 Selecting an Irrigation Method
Irrigation system selection depends on multiple physical and socioeconomic fac￾tors. It should be carried out by experienced professionals who interact with the 
farmer or irrigation manager. The factors to be considered are:
(a) Project goals. As in most production activities, the main goal is maximum eco￾nomic return, although, for example, if capital is limited, the goal could be to 
minimize the initial cost. There may be social and environmental (conserving 
water and water quality) goals that should also be met.
(b) Institutional and social site conditions. The former include legal and political 
aspects like fnancial incentives, land use regulations, or water rights that may 
be of primary importance. Social site conditions include the availability of sup￾port for irrigation equipment maintenance and dependable labor availability. 
For small-holder irrigation in developing countries, additional site conditions to 
be considered are divisibility (suitability of an irrigation method for a wide 
variety of feld sizes and confgurations), skills and effort required for operation 
and maintenance, and ruggedness (durability, robustness).
(c) Physical site conditions. These conditions may refer to the water supply and 
quality, the land features (soil and topography), the cropping system, the cli￾mate, and the energy availability.
– Water. Source, quantity, quality, reliability, and delivery schedule for the 
water supply may make some irrigation methods more preferable or impose 
constraints on the selection of some of them.
– Topography and feld confguration. Field slope, topographic irregularity, 
feld shape, and physical obstructions may preclude the selection of some 
irrigation methods.
– Soil characteristics. Soil texture, depth, heterogeneity, infltration character￾istics, erodibility, salinity, drainability, and the presence of a shallow water 
table must all be considered when selecting an irrigation method.
– Crops and cultural practices. Crop height, germination, root and foliage dis￾eases, and cultural practices (plant spacing, soil tillage and cultivation, appli￾cation of fertilizer and pesticides, crop rotation)
– Climate. Precipitation quantity and distribution will determine whether full 
or supplemental irrigation is required (Chap. 22), making one or other irriga￾tion method more adequate and economically feasible. Wind is an important 
factor when considering sprinkler irrigation. Irrigation can be used to modify 
crop climatic conditions like regulation of temperature, frost prevention, and 
regulation of humidity, but not all methods offer the same possibilities.
– Energy availability and reliability. If pumping is required, the energy source 
must be dependable.

19.4 Design and Management of Irrigation Systems
19.4.1 Surface Irrigation
The surface irrigation process is described in four phases (Fig. 19.1), although not 
always all of them take place. The water that is applied to one end of the feld (the 
high edge or point if the feld is not leveled) advances over the soil until it spreads 
across the entire surface or fow paths (furrows). This is the advance phase. Then, if 
the feld is open at its tail end, the water starts to run off, whereas if it is surrounded 
by a dike or ridge, the water begins to pond. The interval between the end of the 
advance phase and the infow cutoff time is the wetting phase. After water applica￾tion is stopped, the water on the surface begins to decline, infltrating into the soil 
and draining from the surface if there is an open feld end. Two phases are distin￾guished during the drainage period: the depletion phase (or vertical recession) and 
the recession phase (horizontal recession). The depletion phase runs from cutoff to 
the appearance of the frst bare soil under the water; the recession phase begins then 
and ends when the surface is completely drained.
The infltration opportunity time is the difference between the recession and 
advance times; thus, it can be calculated from the advance and recession trajectories 
easily (Fig. 19.1). The infltration rate initially decreases rapidly with time to reach 
later a constant rate. Therefore, the variation of infltrated water across the feld is 
less than the variation of opportunity time.

19 Irrigation Systems268
Furrow irrigation is the most common surface irrigation method. Furrows are 
small channels formed in the soil using a ridger plow. This method avoids fooding 
the entire feld surface; water infltrates through the wetted perimeter. Furrows may 
be level, nearly along a contour line with a small slope, or down the slope of the 
feld. The fow into each furrow is independently controlled, using siphons, gated 
pipes, or perforated pipes. Furrow irrigation can therefore be used with a large range 
of stream sizes by adjusting the number of furrows irrigated at the same time. The 
furrow length and infow rate should be regulated so that water will fow to the end 
of the furrow rapidly, but without erosion. This will ensure good infltration unifor￾mity, although the tail fow may be too high and thus runoff excessive. Infltration 
uniformity and application effciency can be improved simultaneously by using a 
high initial infow rate until the advance phase is completed and cutting back the 
infow afterward. Another way of improving infltration uniformity is using surge 
fow: instead of applying a continuous stream of water, the fow is intermittently 
applied through on-off cycles. By surging the water, some soil surface sealing 
occurs, thus reducing infltration and speeding advance during subsequent surges 
over previously wetted portions.
Border irrigation requires the construction of small earthen dikes (borders) sepa￾rating evenly graded basins or strips typically 5–15 m wide. Water is released onto 
the border strips through an outlet located near the center of its top. The slope across 
the width of the strips is leveled to zero slope; thus, the water moves along the lon￾gitudinal gentle slope of the strip. The entire surface of the strips is fooded. A varia￾tion of border systems is level basins, which are perfectly fat and surrounded by 
check banks, meaning that all the water applied to a level basin infltrates into the 
soil and there is no runoff. Borders can then be unnecessary.
19.4.2 Sprinkler Irrigation
All pressurized irrigation systems should apply water at a rate below the infltration 
rate of the soil, thus avoiding runoff. Thus, here, the irrigation system controls the 
rate of water infltration while in surface irrigation the soil itself controls the infltra￾tion rate during irrigation. With sprinkler irrigation, water is distributed across the 
feld through a pressurized pipe and sprinkled over the soil using nozzles. Sprinkler 
devices for agricultural use generally fall into two broad categories: rotating head 
sprinklers and spray sprinklers. Rotating head sprinklers move themselves in a cir￾cle driven by different mechanisms. In the case of impact sprinklers, this mecha￾nism is an impact arm. The sprinkler head pivots on a bearing as the impact arm 
repeatedly hits the water jet pushed by a spring. When the arm hits the jet, water 
scatters watering the area around the sprinkler. Impact sprinklers can be designed to 
rotate in a full or partial circle. They can have one or two nozzles and many sizes, 
allowing fow from 2 to 280 L min−1
, a throw radius from 7 to 30 m, and operating 
pressures between 140 and 690 kPa.
Spray and spinner sprinklers operate typically at a pressure of less than 200 kPa. 
The water jet from a nozzle impinges on a plate that defects the water in all direc￾tions. The discharge plate can be smooth or serrated and can be fat, concave, or 
L. Mateos269
convex, producing different water distribution patterns. Water leaves a smooth plate 
in small droplets; serrated plates create tiny streamlets with larger droplet sizes. The 
typical radius of throw of spray sprinklers is in the range of 2.5–5 m.
Rotating spray plate sprinklers, commonly referred to as rotators, have features 
of both impact and spray sprinklers. The water discharging from the nozzle impinges 
onto a circular plate that rotates without the need for an impact arm. The shape and 
confguration of the plate determine the multiple trajectories of the water and its 
distribution pattern. The radius of throw can be up to 15 m. Rotators typically oper￾ate at a lower pressure than impact sprinklers (100–345 kPa) and can accommodate 
lower fow rates without compromising performance.
These sprinkler devices are spaced to give a relatively uniform application of 
water over the feld being irrigated using a series of sets or a continuous move sys￾tem. There are several types of sprinkler systems. The most common are 
described below.
Hand-move portable systems consist of one or more pipelines (laterals) with 
sprinklers mounted on risers connected to the laterals at regular distances. The 
height of the risers adapts to the crop height. When the desired amount of water has 
been applied to the area covered by the set of laterals, the pipelines are dissembled 
and carried to the next position. This operation is repeated until the watering of the 
entire feld. Distribution uniformity may be improved by using alternate sets: on 
every other irrigation cycle, the pipelines are placed in intermediate positions. Most 
hand-move portable systems use rotating impact sprinklers, but rotating spray plate 
sprinklers are also used. This system adapts to all topographies, soils, and crops, 
although moving the laterals is hard in tall crops such as maize. Variations of hand￾move portable systems are wheel line and side-move lateral systems. In the former 
system, the lateral line is mounted on wheels with the pipe acting as an axis driven 
by an engine that moves the whole lateral from one position to another. In side￾move systems, the lateral is supported by a frame on which the wheels are mounted.
Stationary or solid-set systems are similar to portable systems except that both 
the main line and the laterals remain in place permanently (if the main and laterals 
are buried) or during the growing season. Rotating spray plate sprinklers are becom￾ing the most commonly used sprinkler type for stationary systems. Stationary sys￾tems adapt well to crops that require frequent applications of water, to facilitate 
germination and for frost protection. Compared to portable systems, solid-set sys￾tems have a high initial investment but require little operation labor.
A center pivot system consists of a single lateral supported by wheeled towers 
that are self-propelled, typically with electric motors, so that the whole lateral 
rotates around the pivot point in the center of the irrigated area. Water is supplied 
also at the pivot point. For long center pivot laterals (e.g., 400 m), the period of rota￾tion may vary between 12 and 120 h, although 12-hour-to-3-day cycles are most 
common, applying between 10 and 25 mm per cycle. Since the outer lateral seg￾ments irrigate an annulus of greater area than the inner segments, application inten￾sity must increase from the pivot point to the lateral distal end to apply uniform 
water depth. This may generate runoff and erosion in some soils if the system is not 
designed and managed properly. The sprinklers used in center pivots may be of any 
kind, but the trend is toward low-pressure sprinklers. Centre pivot systems adapt to 
19 Irrigation Systems270
most feld crops and topographies. They may be unsuitable for small felds or feld 
shapes where circular geometries do not ft well. Moreover, the felds must be free 
of obstacles. Several solutions have been developed to overcome obstacles, and the 
installation of end guns (large sprinklers at the end of the lateral) and corner systems 
(an additional arm that swings out on the corners and tucks back in on the edges) 
allows irrigating part of the corners of squared felds that would not be irrigated with 
the conventional center pivot. Centre pivots can be used for site-specifc variable 
rate irrigation, by using solenoid valves that regulate the application rate of each 
sprinkler.
Linear move systems are similar to center pivots except that they do not rotate 
but translate (move laterally). Water is supplied to the moving lateral using a fexible 
hose or from an open ditch parallel to the translation direction. Contrary to center 
pivots, this system adapts well to rectangular felds and applies the water with uni￾form intensity across the feld. All types of sprinklers can be used in linear move 
systems. However, the tendency is to use drop tubes, installed at short distances 
along the lateral and low-elevation spray application (LESA) or low-energy preci￾sion application (LEPA). LESA systems use sprayers located near the top of the 
crop canopy, while LEPA systems use low-pressure nozzles located very close to 
the soil surface. The soil is furrowed, and the furrows are blocked at regularly 
spaced intervals to prevent runoff and infltration non-uniformity.
19.4.3 Drip/Micro-irrigation
Drip/micro-irrigation systems are designed to localize the water only to parts of the 
soil surface and apply it frequently. The water emitters may be microtubes, orifces, 
nozzles, or perforated pipes. Applications may be from daily to several times per 
week, but sometimes (on sandy soils), daily needs are applied in several pulses 
throughout the day. The systems may be located on or under the soil surface and are 
permanent (solid set). Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) is relatively new. The laterals 
are installed typically at 0.3–0.6 m below the soil surface. This system allows easier 
traffc and soil cultivation, reduced weed germination, and minimal soil evaporation 
but may have the problems of root intrusion into the emitters and impaired detection 
of system failures.
Many types of emitters are capable of supplying water directly to the crop root 
zone. Drip irrigation generally refers to the use of emission devices from which 
water drips onto the soil: drip tape or on- and in-line emitters (small plastic devices 
inserted in or embedded in the lateral), while micro-irrigation refers to the use of 
micro-sprayers or micro-sprinklers. Micro-sprayers and micro-sprinklers are con￾nected to the lateral using spaghetti hoses. The fow rate of these emitters is very 
small. Drippers range from 0.5 to 8  L/h and micro-sprayers or micro-sprinklers 
from 20 to 80 L/h.
Drip/micro-irrigation is primarily used for wide-spaced or high-value crops such 
as fruits, fresh vegetables, and greenhouse crops. The drip/micro-systems differ for 
permanent crops, non-permanent crops, and greenhouse crops.
L. Mateos271
Permanent crops include all kinds of fruit tree orchards and vineyards. Drip/
micro-systems for permanent crops may use drippers, micro-sprayers, or micro￾sprinklers as emission devices. For instance, sandy soils or shallow-rooted trees are 
more effectively irrigated with micro-sprinklers/sprayers, whereas closely spaced 
trees (hedgerows) are better suited for drip lines. Sometimes, tree branches interfere 
with micro-sprinklers/sprayers, and sometimes wetting only a small part of the soil 
prevents diseases. In those two cases, drippers are also preferable. However, micro￾sprayers and micro-sprinklers can provide some frost protection. Drip and micro￾sprinkler systems for permanent crops typically have one lateral per tree row if the 
rows are closely spaced or two if they are spaced more than that—let’s say 5 m. The 
number of emitters per tree depends on the soil type, plant spacing, and type of 
emitter. The idea is to have suffcient root zone wetted volume, which depends on 
annual rainfall, canopy cover, species, and soil type. Drip irrigation is also used for 
non-permanent crops, particularly for row crops such as vegetable crops and also 
for some feld crops (e.g., cotton, tomatoes). After harvest, the irrigation system is 
removed to allow land preparation. Drip systems for row crops mainly use in-line 
drippers or drip tape. Usually, there is one drip line per row, but sometimes, two are 
necessary, or one every second row is suffcient to provide water to each plant root 
zone, depending on the soil’s physical properties. Drip tapes last for one or two 
seasons. Drip lines last longer (7–15 crop seasons) and, if buried (SDI), can remain 
in the feld permanently. High-frequency irrigation for greenhouses may use all 
kinds of emitters, depending on the crop and soil substratum.
Drip/micro-systems require clean water to avoid emitter clogging. Filters are 
therefore essential components of drip/micro-systems, and water fltration accounts 
for a great part of the maintenance and operation efforts. Fertigation and chemiga￾tion (the application of fertilizers and pesticides through the irrigation systems) are 
relatively easy and common with drip/micro-systems, as well as automation of the 
operation (initiation and termination of irrigation in the different system irriga￾tion units).
Drip/micro-systems allow uniform and effcient application of water. They adapt 
very well to all kinds of topographies, feld sizes, shapes, and crops and are very 
easy to operate. They are more and more used in large-scale commercial farming 
and smallholder farming both in developed and developing countries.
19.5 Drainage
Drainage is necessary to evacuate the excess of irrigation or rainfall water and to 
wash the excess of salts. This will ensure adequate aeration of the crop root zone 
and prevent the harmful effect of salt accumulation. Where natural drainage is insuf￾fcient, surface and/or subsurface drainage must be facilitated artifcially.
Surface drainage to remove excess water from the soil surface is expedited by 
excavating shallow open ditches. The dimensions and density of the drainage 
ditches are calculated based on the expected intensity and duration of storms, soil 
type, and crop.
19 Irrigation Systems272
Subsurface drainage is used to control the groundwater table and to remove salts 
for leaching. Many irrigation projects require subsurface drains, which may be deep 
ditches or buried perforated pipes. Open ditches have advantages for removing large 
volumes of water. They may also serve as collectors of subsurface drains. The main 
disadvantages of open drainage ditches are that they occupy land that might other￾wise be cropped, obstruct farming practices, and tend to have high maintenance 
costs. Clay tile drains have been widely used for subsurface drainage. The tiles are 
usually 30–60 cm in length and 10–25 cm in diameter. Corrugated plastic tubing is 
increasingly being used. Perforated pipelines are generally available at 8–30 cm 
diameters. Tile and plastic drains are normally installed with a surrounding enve￾lope (synthetic fabrics, sand and gravel, or other porous flter material) that permits 
water to pass from the soil into the drain without signifcant passage of soil particles.
The soil hydraulic conductivity is a measure of its drainability; it is therefore a 
basic criterion for the design of drainage systems. Proper spacing of drains is com￾plex; thus, it is best determined from feld experience obtained under conditions 
similar to those of the area to be drained. However, several equations have been 
developed for estimating the appropriate spacing of subsurface drains if available 
feld experience is not applicable. These methods consider factors such as hydraulic 
conductivity, rooting depth, depth of drain, rainfall, irrigation practices, water qual￾ity, and soil salinity.
Pumped wells may serve to both lower the groundwater table and, where ground￾water is of good quality for irrigation, to supply water that supplements the main 
source of irrigation supply. This is called conjunctive use.
19.6 Water Reuse
When applying irrigation water to a feld, some water losses (surface drainage and 
deep percolation) are unavoidable in most situations. These losses return to the 
hydrological system where the irrigated feld is located, so they are called return 
fows. In many cases, the return fows can be reused downstream, for irrigation or 
other purposes. Therefore, the reuse of return fows tends to reduce the global ben￾eft of improving on-feld effciency. Reuse can take place within the feld (conjunc￾tive use mentioned above), in the farm (e.g., by recycling runoff), in the irrigation 
district, or at watershed levels. The reuse of treated urban wastewater is one exam￾ple of the latter, although in this case, the origin of the return fow is not from 
agriculture.

20 Irrigation Scheduling Using Water 
Balance
Francisco J. Villalobos , Luciano Mateos, and Elias Fereres
Abstract
The simplest and most robust method for irrigation scheduling, i.e., deciding the 
dates and amounts of irrigation, is based on water balance. Soil water defcit 
(depth of water required to bring the soil to feld capacity) is calculated using ET
and rainfall data, and rules are defned for calculating the dates and depths of 
irrigation. Rules are based on the critical SWD, the amount of water that the crop 
can extract in the rooting depth before water stress occurs. The critical SWD is 
the product of root depth, soil available water, and allowable depletion. The latter 
depends on evaporative demand when we want to prevent reductions in expan￾sive growth. Otherwise, most crops can use around 70% of stored soil water 
before stomatal closure occurs. In arid areas, we can calculate mean irrigation 
calendars for planning purposes. Irrigation scheduling of high-frequency irriga￾tion systems is very simple as it focuses only on irrigating with an amount equal 
to actual crop ET since the last irrigation while ignoring water storage in the soil.
20.1 Introduction
Irrigation scheduling is a process by which one determines when to irrigate and how 
much water to apply by calculating the dates and depths of irrigation. Measurements 
of plant (leaf water potential, canopy temperature) or soil water status (water

content, water potential) may be used for scheduling irrigations, but here we will 
only deal with the simplest, albeit powerful method, the water balance approach. It 
involves the determination of all the inputs and outputs of water from the feld, and 
it is based on maintaining adequate soil water content in terms of crop performance. 
To use this method, it is especially important to know exactly crop ET.
Given the technical diffculties in measuring the water balance components in 
practice, this method is applied based on estimates of some of the water balance 
components. It is therefore highly desirable, when possible, to take measurements 
(neutron probe, gravimetric sampling) that allow us to check the accuracy of esti￾mated values.
This chapter frst presents the foundations and applications of the water balance 
method. Then the information required for applying the method and the rules for 
determining the dates and amounts of irrigation are presented.
20.2 The Water Balance Equation for Irrigation Scheduling
The water balance equation allows calculating the decrease in soil water content as 
the difference between outputs and inputs of water to the feld. Therefore, soil water 
defcit (SWD) for day t is calculated as:
SWD S t t = + WD −1 ET − − I P e e (20.1)
where Pe is effective rainfall and Ie is effective irrigation. In both cases, the term 
effective means after discounting losses due to runoff or deep percolation. Soil 
water defcit was defned in Chap. 8 as the amount of water required to bring the soil 
to the upper limit (feld capacity). Note that instead of considering the amount of 
water in the soil, we use a defcit of water that increases from zero when the soil is 
at feld capacity.
Once you have a method to estimate SWD, you must establish rules of decision 
to determine the date and the depth of irrigation. The decision rule to adopt depends 
on numerous factors such as the crop, the soil, the climate, and the irrigation system.
The critical SWD that should not be exceeded is calculated as:
SWD Z c R = ⋅PAW ⋅ AD (20.2)
where ZR is effective rooting depth (m); PAW is plant available water (mm/m), which 
is the difference between feld capacity and permanent wilting point; and AD is the 
allowable depletion (fraction). Commonly found PAW values for sandy, loam, and 
clay soils are around 100, 150, and 200 mm/m, respectively. An average PAW value 
of 120 mm/m has been found for a wide range of light- to medium-textured soils 
and may be used in the absence of local information.
F. J. Villalobos et al.275
20.3 Effective Rooting Depth
In the context of irrigation scheduling, effective rooting depth (ZR) is the soil depth 
where roots can extract most of the soil water and is equivalent to the soil water 
reservoir that is being managed by the irrigator. This depth may be considered con￾stant for perennials (alfalfa, fruit trees). In annual crops, ZR increases from a mini￾mum to a maximum value (ZRmax) that depends on the crop and the soil (Table 20.1). 
The variation of ZR for annual crops can be calculated as follows:
Z Z R R = + min m ( ) Z Z R R ax − min Rf (20.3)
where ZRmin is the value of root depth at planting, which is equal to the sowing depth. 
The maximum value of root depth for annual crops occurs around or after fowering. 
The factor Rf describes the rate of growth of the rooting depth during the cycle and 
may be calculated as a function of time (t; Eq. 20.4a) or as a function of thermal 
time (TT; Eq. 20.4b) from sowing:

where ts-m and TTs-m are the time and thermal time from sowing to maximum rooting 
depth, respectively. The primary factor determining maximum rooting depth is the 
soil, particularly the soil depth and its mechanical resistance to root penetration. 
Therefore, for any given crop, the maximum rooting depth depends on soil charac￾teristics, and that explains the wide variation in the maximum effective root depth 
of each species presented in Table 20.1. For instance, Table 20.1 shows that in the 
case of sunfowers, the maximum root depth varies from 1 to 2.5  m. In some 
extremely open, deep soils, it has been found that water extraction by sunfower 
crops occurs down to 3 m and more. Irrigation management affects the distribution 
of the root system; frequent irrigation promotes root growth in the surface layers, 
while long irrigation intervals favor more root growth in the deeper layers. Because 
mechanical resistance increases exponentially as the soil dries, root growth occurs 
very slowly or does not occur at all in dry soil. This is the reason why it is advisable 
to start the growing season with a fully charged soil profle (zero water defcit in the 
anticipated root zone). In that case, if irrigation is delayed, root growth will occur at 
progressively deeper moist layers because water uptake dries progressively the soil 
layers above, and that limits new root growth. The distribution of roots is therefore 
the result of the dynamics of root water uptake and of the application of water, 
which determine where the conditions are favorable for new root expansion. This 
has led to the (wrong) popular belief that roots seek out water. What roots do is 
proliferate where soil environmental conditions are good in terms of water, nutrient 
content and temperature. Thus, irrigation management affects the distribution of the 
root system but not its depth. Frequent irrigation favors high rooting density in the 
surface layers, while infrequent irrigation or rainfed conditions generate root sys￾tems with less density near the surface and much more in the deep layers. If such 
deep soil layers are dry, very little root growth will occur there.
20.4 Allowable Depletion
Plants can extract soil water down to the permanent wilting point, but crop perfor￾mance is affected before that. The allowable depletion is the fraction of plant avail￾able water that can be extracted by the crop without negative effects on yield but 
could also be determined as the PAW fraction above which a certain process such as 
transpiration, assimilation, or growth proceeds unaffected. Therefore, the AD may 
depend on the process considered and on evaporative demand, as plant water status 
is affected by soil water potential and transpiration rate (Chap. 14). Growth rates 
may be affected after only 10–20% of available water has been used, while transpi￾ration is usually affected after much higher PAW values (60–70%). The evapotrans￾piration of feld crops, according to Ritchie, is reduced after 2/3 of the available 
water has been extracted. This is a simple rule valid when expansive growth is not 
critical for yield (full cover situations, harvest value dependent on dry matter). On 
the contrary, when growing horticultural crops, we are concerned with the size of 
F. J. Villalobos et al.277
the harvestable organ (root, bulb, leaves), so water defcits should be avoided, and a 
low AD should be adopted. The same would happen when we deal with feld crops 
during vegetative growth. In those cases, evaporative demand should be taken also 
into account, with AD decreasing as ET0 increases:
AD = −1 F E AD T0 (20.5)
where FAD is a sensitivity factor shown in Table 20.1 for the main agricultural spe￾cies (for a more complete list, see Appendix 10.3). If Eq. 20.5 yields a value of AD
below 0.2, we adopt AD = 0.2.
20.5 Criteria for Irrigation Scheduling
The basic rule for irrigation scheduling is to irrigate just before the soil water defcit 
reaches the critical SWD defned in Eq. 20.2, applying a dose equal to SWD. This 
rule implies no water defcit with a minimum number of irrigations. However, the 
characteristics of the irrigation system may impose restrictions on the dates and 
depths of irrigation.
Irrigation scheduling by water balance is equivalent to operating with a credit 
card with a maximum credit (PAW) and a critical credit (critical SWD), above which 
interest rates increase (crop yields decrease). We may deposit money whenever we 
Example 20.1
The soil in our farm is of sandy loam texture and 1 m depth. We want to irri￾gate maize (after full canopy cover) and onion and need to know the critical 
soil water defcit for irrigation management.
The values of maximum ET expected are 5 mm/day (onion) and 8 mm/day 
(maize). According to the soil type, we can adopt a value of potential available 
water of 120 mm/m.
According to Appendix 10.3, the maximum root depth of onion is between 
0.5 and 0.8 m. We take the mean value (0.65 m). The value of FAD is 0.14 
(Appendix 10.3), so using Eq. 20.5, we get:
AD = −1 1 F E AD T = − 0 14 5⋅ = 0 3 0 . .
Now we calculate the critical soil water defcit as:
SWD Z c R = = PAW AD 0 6. / 5m m × × 120 m m 0 3. . = 23 4mm
The maximum root depth of maize is between 1.0 and 2 m, which in any 
case is greater than the actual soil depth (1 m), so we adopt 1 m as the maxi￾mum root depth. As we have reached full canopy cover, we are not concerned 
about expansion and adopt AD = 0.7. The critical soil water defcit will be:
SWD Z c R = = PAW AD 1 0. / m m × × 120 m m 0 7. 0 8 = 4mm
20 Irrigation Scheduling Using Water Balance278
want (irrigate), and some friends may unexpectedly deposit money as a gift (rain). 
We spend money every day (ET); thus, the defcit in the account increases. If we 
want to avoid high interest rates and minimize the number of deposits (as they imply 
a cost, the labor involved in applying irrigation), we should go to the bank just 
before the defcit reaches the critical value and deposit an amount of money equal to 
the defcit. This would be the basic rule. If we go sooner to the bank, then the num￾ber of deposits would increase. If we go later, we will exceed the critical credit, and 
the interest rate will increase.
20.5.1 Restrictions to the Dates of Irrigation
Some irrigation schemes, typically those with surface irrigation, are organized 
according to a rotation, and farmers receive water at stated intervals (e.g., weekly), 
so the possible dates of irrigation are fxed, and the farmer decides the irrigation 
amount. Pressurized irrigation systems may work on demand, so the farmer chooses 
the date and the amount. However, even in this case, dates may be restricted by holi￾days or other operations on the farm that are incompatible with irrigation (e.g., 
application of pesticides) or require labor or equipment necessary for irrigation.
20.5.2 Restrictions to the Irrigation Depth
The type of irrigation system and its design may impose restrictions on irrigation 
depths. Surface irrigation systems are designed for applying a rather large depth 
(over 50–60 mm) and become highly ineffcient when smaller depths are applied, 
except in smallholder irrigation systems of very small plots. Irrigation machines 
(center pivot, lateral move, siderolls) move within a given range of speeds that 
determine the irrigation depths that they can apply. Hand-move sprinkler systems 
have to be organized taking into account the time required for displacing the lateral, 
which usually leads to an optimum irrigation depth (or duration).
20.5.3 Decisions on Irrigation Dates and Depths
The basic rule for deciding when to irrigate is to do it just before the soil water def￾cit reaches the critical SWD, that is, calculated according to the soil and the crop. If 
we irrigate sooner than that, we will increase the number of irrigations and thus the 
cost, but we will be on the safe side in terms of water defcit and would be able to 
cope with possible failures of the irrigation system. If we irrigate later, and thus 
SWD exceeds the critical value, water stress will occur, and it may have a negative 
effect. This would be the case of defcit irrigation when the water supply is not 
enough to meet the crop water requirement. In the case of rotation of water supply, 
on any date when water is available, we should irrigate if we expect the critical SWD
to be exceeded before the next date with water supply.
F. J. Villalobos et al.279
Once the irrigation date is decided, the basic rule is to refll the soil, i.e., bring the 
soil to zero SWD; therefore, the irrigation depth should be equal to SWD at the date 
of irrigation. However, the irrigation depth could be larger than that (excess irriga￾tion) when salt leaching is required. On the contrary, the depth could be smaller, 
thus leaving some soil water holding capacity unflled, which may store rainfall in 
the days after irrigating. This strategy may improve rainfall use at the expense of 
increasing the number of irrigations.
Example 20.2
We are irrigating corn during summer with a mean daily ET = 8 mm/day. 
Water is available every 10 days (July1, July 11, July 21, etc.), and the critical 
SWD is 120 mm. On July 1, the SWD is 20 mm. Should we irrigate? The 
answer is no. We can wait until July 11 as SWD will be 20 + 10 × 8 = 100 mm. 
We should irrigate on that date (July 11) as SWD would exceed the critical 
value soon after that, so waiting until July 21 should be discarded.
Example 20.3
Different strategies for date and depth of irrigation are applied to corn planted 
in March in Cordoba (Spain). The critical SWD is 94. Figure 20.1 shows the 
basic strategy (irrigated when SWD reaches the critical value) and apply a

Example 20.3 (continued)
The rules about irrigation depths have to be corrected near the end of the crop 
cycle to leave the soil as dry as possible to allow rainfall storage during fallow and 
to prevent excessive deep percolation and, thus, nitrate leaching. To achieve such an 
objective, the soil water defcit at harvest should approach 80–90% of available 
water in the profle. This can be achieved by solving the water balance equation 
from the date of the last irrigation until harvest, which allows calculating the depth 
for the last irrigation as:
I SWDt t SWD ETi
t

L H
H
L
= − +∑ (20.6)
where tL and tH refer to the dates of the last irrigation and harvest, respectively.
20 Irrigation Scheduling Using Water Balance282
20.6 Irrigation Schedules
The dates and depths of irrigation have to be decided in real time according to the 
specifc weather of each year by updating the soil water defcit day after day accord￾ing to crop ET and rainfall. In arid areas where rainfall is negligible during the irri￾gation season, an average irrigation calendar may be defned a priori using mean ET
values. This approach was originally developed in California by E. Fereres. It allows 
better allocation of labor and irrigation equipment as the dates and depths of irriga￾tion for each crop in the farm are calculated at the start of the season.
When irrigation systems are permanent (micro-irrigation or solid-set sprinkler 
systems) and there is no labor cost associated with applying irrigation, timing is 
unimportant, and irrigation is applied as frequently as desired. Thus, when using the 
water balance under high-frequency irrigation (e.g., drip), we may ignore, in prin￾ciple, the soil water storage, so that the scheduling strategy is to simply replenish the 
ET accumulated since the last irrigation. As explained in Example 20.4, some irriga￾tion water may also be saved at the end of the season under high-frequency irriga￾tion by safely using some of the stored soil water.
Example 20.4
We are irrigating a crop whenever SWD reaches a critical value of 96 mm, 
which results from a soil depth of 1 m, PAW 160 mm/m, and AD 0.6. We need 
to irrigate on September 1 and want to end the irrigation season on October 1, 
after using 90% of the PAW. Therefore, the fnal SWD should be 144 mm. The 
average ET during September is 3 mm/day. Applying Eq. 20.5, we calculate 
the irrigation depth as:
I SWDt t SWD ETi

Note that by applying the correction, we could save 54 mm of irrigation water.

Abstract
Over the last decades, many novel approaches to irrigation scheduling based on 
the use of sensors and new technologies have been proposed. These methods are 
based on the measurement of variables related to the plant or soil water status. 
Plant-based methods evaluate physical variables associated with plant response 
to water defcit and help in defning when irrigation is needed. However, the 
practical application is hindered by the sensitivity of water stress indicators to 
atmospheric demand and the low sensitivity to mild water defcits, so they are 
useless for preventing reductions in expansive growth. Soil-based methods 
include techniques measuring the water content or water potential of the soil, and 
they may provide indication on both when to irrigate and how much water to 
apply. Their main limitation lays on how to cope with the large spatial variability 
in soil water content.

21.1 Introduction
Albeit powerful, the water balance approach for irrigation scheduling relies on esti￾mates of the water balance components, adding uncertainty to its outputs and lead￾ing to errors that are cumulative over time. Supplementary measurements of water 
status are then highly recommended as they may allow the user to detect deviations 
in the water balance estimates and/or facilitate decision-making. In the last decades, 
the development of new sensors, monitoring techniques, and data transfer methods 
are providing new avenues for a robust characterization of the plant and soil water 
status. Some of these new technologies offer interesting opportunities in the context 
of irrigation scheduling, as an alternative or as a complement to the water balance 
approach. This chapter reviews the basis, the relative merits, and the main issues of 
the most important methods for irrigation scheduling based on plant or soil 
measurements.
21.2 Plant-Based Methods
This group includes non-automated, traditional methods based on manual records 
or observations of plant water status and gas exchange and automated instrumenta￾tion where the measured variable is recorded continuously. A priori, plant-based 
measurements of water status should be ideal for irrigation scheduling purposes 
since they are more directly related to crop performance than soil moisture. However, 
they show several limitations and drawbacks that hinder their suitability in practice. 
First, they can be helpful for defning when irrigation is required but provide no 
indication on how much water should be applied (except partially for methods esti￾mating transpiration). Second, plant-based indicators of water status refect the bal￾ance between plant water supply factors (depth and root density, soil water content) 
and plant water demand factors (leaf area, water vapor defcit by the atmosphere), 
which challenges the defnition of universal thresholds for triggering irrigation. This 
picture is further complicated because these plant indicators are often sensitive to 
the developmental stage, nutritional status, and other features. Therefore, the detec￾tion of water stress often requires additional measurements in well-irrigated plants 
acting as controls. As a fnal remark, most of the plant-based methods proposed for 
irrigation scheduling require purchasing sophisticated and expensive equipment 
and/or rely on labor-intensive measurements, so they have been so far mostly 
restricted to research studies.
21.2.1 Water Potential
Leaf water potential (Ψl) is a direct indicator of plant water status and probably one 
of the most widespread since it can be easily measured with Scholander pressure 
chambers. This technique is based on the application of pressure on the limb of a 
leaf, which is placed into a chamber that encloses it completely, with the exception 
Á. López-Bernal et al.287
of the petiole. Pressure is increased until the appearance of a drop on the sectioned 
petiole. At this time, the pressure applied is approximately equal to the additive 
inverse of leaf water potential. Measurements in more than eight to ten leaves are 
usually needed to characterize each plot. The operation of pressure chambers is 
slow, labor consuming, and, therefore, expensive. Consequently, it is only afford￾able for big farming companies growing high-value crops.
Typically, leaf water potential changes along the day following a curve with a 
maximum before dawn and a minimum sometime after midday, as shown in 
Fig. 21.1. However, some atmospheric conditions (e.g., passing clouds) can modify 
this pattern, to some extent. On sunny summer days, leaf water potential often var￾ies little during the central hours of the day, which is the usual measurement time 
using pressure chambers. In the case of fruit trees, a widespread technique is that of 
measuring the water potential on leaves that have been covered for 15–20 min with 
aluminum foil, to force stomatal closure and stop transpiration. This time is consid￾ered enough for the leaf water potential to equilibrate with that at its insertion with 
the stem. The so-called stem water potential is always less negative than when mea￾sured in the illuminated leaves and presents the advantage of reducing the variabil￾ity of the records associated to differences in stomatal opening among leaves.
In Chap. 14 we explored the relation between transpiration, water potential, and 
plant resistance. According to Eq. 14.2, leaf water potential values are affected by 
changes in transpiration rates or in the plant resistances to water at a given level of 
soil moisture. As a result, the use of absolute thresholds of water potential in irriga￾tion scheduling can induce errors under conditions different from those where the 
thresholds were defned. Leaf water potential is not only determined by soil water 
availability, but a product of the interactions of the different elements that compose 
the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Thus, this indicator is sensitive to evaporative 
demand and to some crop characteristics like the root/leaf area ratio. This explains

21 Irrigation Scheduling Using Plant- and Soil-Based Methods288
why very different water potentials are often measured for different crops under 
ample water supply. For example, with the soil close to feld capacity, midday leaf 
water potential usually ranges between −1.0 and −1.2 MPa in cotton and between 
−0.5 and −0.7 MPa in tomato. The same variability can be observed at different 
crop development stages. For instance, in well-irrigated maize midday water poten￾tial can range from −0.5 MPa before the rapid growth of the stem to −1.1 MPa 
when maximum plant height is achieved.
A large body of literature has focused on the defnition of water potential thresh￾olds for triggering irrigation although they have been successfully applied only in a 
few crops like cotton. Typical threshold of leaf water potential for stomatal closure 
is often between −1.0 and −1.5 MPa for different species. In general, expansive 
growth will be reduced before these thresholds are reached, so they are not practical 
under partial cover or when maximum expansion is desired (e.g., horticultural 
crops). In those cases, a more conservative threshold would be required. On the 
other hand, the use of water potential thresholds is particularly challenging for 
crops/cultivars with isohydric behavior (see Sect. 14.4.2). In these genotypes, sto￾mata tend to close for preventing the decrease in leaf water potential; this implies 
that under water defcit, transpiration is reduced to maintain a high leaf water poten￾tial, i.e., leaf water potential is barely sensitive to soil moisture variations.
Leaf water potential may help in deciding when to irrigate, but not on how much 
water to apply. As a result, the measurement of leaf water potential is often more 
useful as a diagnostic technique to assess the existence of water stress when irriga￾tion is scheduled using other methods (e.g., water balance).
Although leaf water potential measurements are usually performed around mid￾day for irrigation scheduling purposes, the use of pressure chambers before dawn 
also provides valuable information. Transpiration may be negligible during the 
night, which allows plant tissues to rehydrate, eventually equilibrating their water 
potential with that in the root zone. As a result, the so-called pre-dawn water poten￾tial is often used as a surrogate of the soil water potential (see Eq. 14.2). However, 
nighttime transpiration could be signifcant on nights with high vapor pressure def￾cit (VPD), preventing plants from fully equilibrating with the soil.
Lately, a new type of microtensiometer has been developed for the measurement 
of water potential in woody species. It is based on a microelectromechanical pres￾sure sensor and a nanoporous membrane that hydraulically connects the xylem with 
the sensor. The device is small enough to be embedded in woody stems, allowing 
the continuous monitoring of water potential under feld conditions. The suitability 
for continuous monitoring and automation makes this technology particularly 
promising, although it still requires further testing for its direct application to irriga￾tion scheduling.
21.2.2 Leaf Turgor Pressure
This indicator represents the pressure exerted by the protoplasm on the walls of leaf 
cells. Tissue dehydration results in a loss of turgor that eventually leads to wilting 
Á. López-Bernal et al.289
symptoms. Magnetic leaf patch-clamp pressure probes can be used for measuring 
leaf turgor. These devices consist of two magnetic patches that are mounted in the 
adaxial and abaxial sides of a leaf, in tight contact with its surface. A pressure￾sensing chip measures the attenuation of the applied external pressure, which is 
related to leaf turgor.
These sensors are suitable for automatic and continuous recording under feld 
conditions. Apparently, the probes work satisfactorily only for well-hydrated leaves, 
which explains the scarce adoption of the technique.
21.2.3 Canopy Temperature
The development of infrared radiation sensors has enabled the remote measurement 
of canopy temperature. The temperature of the crop surface is related to the degree 
of water stress: as crop transpiration is reduced by water stress, the excess energy 
not spent in latent heat fux causes the heating of leaves, whose temperature 
increases. However, climatic factors (especially those affecting the energy balance) 
modify the relationship between temperature and stress, so they must be considered. 
Canopy temperature is otherwise a late indicator of water stress, in the sense that it 
refects changes in stomatal conductance, which occur much later than the reduction 
in expansive growth.
Among the various methods based on canopy temperature proposed for irriga￾tion scheduling, the most successful is the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), which 
is defned as:
CWSI
T T T T
T T T T
c a c a
c a c a
= ( ) − − − ( )
( ) − − − ( )min
max min
(21.1)
where Tc and Ta are canopy and air temperature, respectively. Subindexes max and 
min indicate the maximum and minimum possible values. The minimum corre￾sponds to a crop with no water stress and the maximum to a crop with maximum 
stress (non-transpiring). If CWSI = 0, then there is no water stress, while if CWSI = 1, 
the degree of stress is the maximum possible. Besides, this index is theoretically 
related to the rate of transpiration by the following expression:
CWSI = − E E p p 1 / max (21.2)
where Ep and Epmax are actual and maximum transpiration rates, respectively.
The CWSI enables us to decide when to irrigate but not the amount to be applied, 
as with most plant-based methods. In general, the value of CWSI indicating that 
irrigation is needed is around 0.25. In principle, the method applies only to full 
cover crops. In heterogeneous canopies with partial cover, the temperature of the 
soil surface (which depends largely on the water content of the upper soil layer) can 
potentially affect measurements of canopy temperature, if soil is present in the feld 
of view of the sensor. However, modelling approaches have been developed for cor￾recting the effect of soil temperature on the CWSI.
21 Irrigation Scheduling Using Plant- and Soil-Based Methods290
The calculation of CWSI requires knowing (Tc−Ta)min and (Tc−Ta)max. Using the 
equations for sensible and latent heat fux (Chap. 5), we may compute the difference 
in temperature between the canopy and the air above as:

Differences in temperature between the canopy and the air are higher for smooth 
uncoupled canopies (e.g., short grass) than for rough coupled vegetation (e.g., tree 
orchards), as demonstrated in Example 21.1. Another relevant observation is that 
the cooling effect of transpiration is proportional to VPD, as implicitly assumed in 
Eq. 21.3. This agrees with the fact that CWSI is of little use in humid areas or cloudy 
days (low VPD), where the signal-to-noise ratio is smaller.

Canopy temperature measurements may be taken with a handheld infrared ther￾mometer (often similar to a handgun) that must be aimed with the sun at the back, 
forming an angle of about 30° with the horizontal to view only vegetation and not 
the soil surface. The VPD can be measured with humidity sensors or from readings 
of dry and wet bulb temperatures. Temperature and humidity should be measured at 
0.5–1 m above the crop surface, avoiding the edges of the plot.
Canopy temperature can be monitored remotely with infrared sensors or thermal 
cameras mounted on proximal or airborne platforms. This enables the characteriza￾tion of the spatial variability of crop water status, which can be used to plan subsequent 
sampling, to adjust the amount of water to apply in specifc irrigation sectors, or 
to diagnose problems with the irrigation system in specifc plots (see Chap. 39). 
An example of the use of CWSI for pistachio in California is presented in 
Fig. 21.3.
21.2.4 Expansion Rate
The expansion rates of leaves, stems, or fruits are sensitive even to mild water def￾cit. They can be measured using high-resolution displacement sensors (see Sect. 
21.2.5) or, in the case of leaves, by measuring changes in leaf dimensions, which is 
21 Irrigation Scheduling Using Plant- and Soil-Based Methods294
labor intensive. Expansion rates are reduced long before photosynthesis is affected, 
so they may be used as an early indicator of water stress, if a well-watered control 
is available as control. This technique is not suitable when expansive growth stops, 
as is the case with determinate species (e.g., sunfower, corn, wheat) during the 
reproductive growth phase.
The use of expansion rate as an indicator of water defcit is also complicated by 
the effect of evaporative demand. Figure 14.6 (Chap. 14) shows leaf expansion rates 
measured in Córdoba (Spain) for sunfower in spring and summer, with low and 
high evaporative demand, respectively. In the summer, leaf expansion rates start to 
decrease with a lower depletion of soil water, i.e., expansion if more sensitive to soil 
water when ET0 is high. To some extent, the effect of soil water availability can be 
improved by normalization, dividing the expansion rates by ET0 or VPD. Using 
control unstressed plants as a reference is a possible solution.
21.2.5 Stem Diameter Variations
When transpiration begins in the early morning, part of the water stored in plant 
tissues is lost until root water uptake equals transpiration (Fig.  14.1, Chap. 14). 
This leads to a contraction of plant tissues, including stems. This is reversed when 
transpiration decreases in the evening, which allows plant tissues to rehydrate and 
increase in volume. Daily fuctuations of stem diameter can be measured with 
high-resolution sensors (linear variable displacement transducers, LVDT) providing 
information on plant water status. On the one hand, the magnitude of the stem con￾traction (maximum daily shrinkage, MDS) increases with water stress, but only in 
some cases (Fig. 21.4), limiting the adoption of this technique. However, these sen￾sors provide continuous records of stem diameter and thus of stem growth rates, 
which are an early indicator of stress. Unfortunately, the defnition of thresholds for 
daily growth rates is often complicated as they are affected by some plant character￾istics or developmental stages. For instance, stem growth is heavily depressed in 
years of high fruit load in tree crops, even if they are well irrigated.
21.2.6 Stomatal Conductance
Leaf stomatal conductance can be measured with porometers. It is a relatively late 
indicator of water stress, so it is more suitable after full cover is achieved, when 
expansive growth is less important for yield formation. Stomatal conductance is 
strongly affected by environmental conditions (e.g., radiation, temperature, humid￾ity) and highly variable among leaves, which limits its use in irrigation scheduling. 
The measurements should be compared with records taken from well-watered 
control plants (Fig. 21.5).

21.2.7 Sap Flow
Several methods are available to determine water fow through stems, a surrogate of 
transpiration, by using heat as a tracer.
(a) Heat balance methods solve the heat balance for a stem segment during con￾tinuous application of heat. The amount of heat taken up by the sap stream is 
computed and used to calculate sap fow rate. The heat is applied with a fexible 
gauge wrapped around the stem or using stainless steel electrode plates inserted 
into the wood.

line) as compared to the farm schedule (farm). This is refected in higher stomatal conductance 
after that date. (Adapted from Testi et al. (2022). Irrig Sci 40:407–422)
(b) The thermal dissipation method is based on the continuous or transient applica￾tion of heat through a cylindrical probe of ≤2  mm diameter that is inserted 
radially into the stem. A second probe installed some millimeters below the 
heater records temperature changes in the xylem, so the temperature difference 
between the probes is related to variations in sap fow rates. Despite being an 
empirical method, it is one of the most widespread because of the simplicity of 
the sensors, which makes them more affordable.
(c) Heat pulse techniques include several approaches based on the application of 
short heat pulses at regular intervals using thin linear heater probes inserted in 
the stem. Xylem temperature is measured before and after the heat pulse at 
specifc down- and upstream locations with respect to the heater using probes 
of similar dimensions. Temperature responses to heat pulse emission are used 
to derive sap velocity.
Each sap fow method presents specifc features that make them more or less 
appropriate under some conditions. For instance, some are useless for determining 
high sap fow rates, while others work fne only above a threshold of sap velocity. 
Similarly, some devices are only suitable for specifc ranges of stem diameter. In 
any case, sap fow measurements today are only suitable for woody species.
Sap fow can be used as a surrogate of transpiration although the former should 
theoretically lag the latter on an hourly basis (see Fig. 14.1, Chap. 14). As transpira￾tion is one of the major components of crop evapotranspiration, sap fow measure￾ments could be very useful in irrigation scheduling when combined with the water 
balance method, particularly when soil evaporation can be independently measured 
or estimated. In any case, due to the spatial variability of sap velocity in the xylem,

calibration of sap fow records is a prerequisite when accurate absolute estimates of 
transpiration are sought, irrespective of the method.
Variations in sap fow rates may serve as an indicator of water status. In this 
regard, relative reductions in sap fow should theoretically match those of photosyn￾thesis but will occur later than those in the growth rate. In addition, transpiration and 
hence sap fow are highly infuenced by evaporative demand and atmospheric con￾ditions in general, which precludes the establishment of “safety thresholds.” 
Concurrent measurements of sap fow on well-watered control plants are then 
required for determining when the rate recorded under conventional irrigation man￾agement is reduced below its maximum (non-stressed) value. Alternatively, esti￾mates of unlimited transpiration using crop simulation models (see Chap. 40) may 
serve as the reference to detect changes in water status. Figure 21.6 shows the diur￾nal curves of sap fow of olive trees under ample water supply and defcit irrigation. 
In both cases, the sap fow curve is delayed from that of solar radiation.
21.2.8 Water Content of Plant Tissues
Gravimetrical determinations represent the simplest alternative for measuring the 
water content of specifc plant organs, avoiding the need for sophisticated instru￾mentation. In leaves, relative water content (RWC) is estimated as:
RWC F = − ( ) W DW S /( ) W D− W (21.9)
where FW is the fresh weight of the leaf sample, DW is its oven-dry weight, and SW
stands for the maximum (saturated) weight, which is obtained after soaking the

leaves in water for several hours. This method is prone to error, partly because FW
should be measured immediately after excising the leaves. Furthermore, determina￾tions are time consuming, so they are of little help for irrigation scheduling. Indeed, 
water potential is considered a more rigorous and applicable measure of water status.
In tree species, sapwood water content also refects plant water status. In most 
cases, the change in water content is too small to be useful for irrigation scheduling, 
but long-term variations respond to water supply as shown in Fig. 21.7 for olive 
trees. Apart from destructive gravimetrical determinations, water content can be 
indirectly estimated from the thermal properties, electrical resistance, and dielectric 
constant of sapwood, which are only used in research.
21.2.9 Qualitative Evaluation of Plant Water Status
The use of visible symptoms of water stress to decide the date of irrigation is a rapid 
method that requires no equipment. Indeed, many farmers still rely on crop appear￾ance to decide when to irrigate. Their success depends largely on their experience. 
The main drawbacks of this method are as follows:
(a) It is diffcult to establish general criteria. Each species may show characteristic 
symptoms, which can vary even for different cultivars. Some of the more typi￾cal are leaf curling (grasses), changes in leaf orientation (sorghum, beans), 
reduced plant size, temporary wilting (sugar beet), leaf shedding (almond), 
stiffness and dark color of stems (cotton), and darker color of young leaves 
(beans).
Á. López-Bernal et al.299
(b) The visible symptoms usually appear when the plant water stress has been suf￾fered for some time, which in many cases implies that a fraction of the attain￾able yield has been already lost at the time of symptom appearance. Visible 
symptoms are, therefore, late indicators of water stress.
21.3 Soil-Based Methods
In this section, we review the main approaches for determining the water potential 
or water content of the soil. The techniques differ in their principles, the need for 
sophisticated instrumentation, labor requirements, and cost, among others. For 
some, readily automated commercial devices are available.
The main advantage of soil measurements of water status is that, unlike plant￾based methods, they provide useful information for deciding both the time and dose 
of irrigation (except for tensiometers). On the contrary, the often-large spatial vari￾ability in soil water status poses a major challenge for these methods, since they are 
mostly based on point measurements and so only representative of a very small soil 
volume. Therefore, many sensors or extensive monitoring programs would be 
required (often expensive) if a robust estimate of the average water status of the plot 
is needed. Finally, measurements should be performed in positions within the soil 
volume where most root water uptake takes place, which depends on crop and irri￾gation system characteristics. In localized irrigation systems—where soil water 
content varies drastically within decimeters—fnding representative positions for 
the measurement points is even more challenging.
21.3.1 Gravimetric Sampling of Soil Moisture
This is a direct method for measuring soil water content. It is often used to calibrate 
indirect methods (e.g., neutron probe). The method involves taking soil samples 
(using an auger or a sampling tube), weighing (to determine the fresh mass), drying 
in an oven (at 105 °C), and weighing again (dry mass). Alternatively, soil samples 
can be dried in a microwave oven.
The main drawbacks of this simple method are the destructiveness (the measure￾ment cannot be repeated at the same point) and the high demand for labor. Since the 
spatial variability of soil water content is often signifcant, a high number of samples 
must be collected. This may be impractical in the context of irrigation scheduling.
This method poses problems in stony soils due to the diffculty in sampling. In 
soils with high organic matter, mass losses may occur by oxidation and/or burning, 
so drying should be performed at 50–70 °C. Another possible source of error is the 
loss of moisture from the sample before drying, which must be avoided by using 
suitable containers (cans, bags, etc.). Finally, the gravimetric method requires 
knowing the soil bulk density (which is often highly variable in space) to convert 
soil water content from mass to volume fractions.
21 Irrigation Scheduling Using Plant- and Soil-Based Methods300
21.3.2 Neutron Probe
This is an indirect method for measuring soil water content. It has been used exten￾sively in research and applied to irrigation scheduling in some countries (e.g., 
Australia). A neutron probe is composed of a radioactive source (typically 
Americium-241/Beryllium) that emits high-energy neutrons, a slow neutron detec￾tor, and an amplifer/output unit. The emitter and the detector are located together in 
a cylindrical piece that is lowered into the soil through an access tube. The access 
tube may be of steel, aluminum, or PVC. The high-energy neutrons (fast neutrons) 
collide mostly with hydrogen atoms, becoming slow neutrons. The higher the water 
content of soil, the greater the number of collisions, and the greater the number of 
slow neutrons originated, which is measured with the detector.
Contrary to other methods, where water content or potential is estimated for a 
discrete point, the estimates by neutron probes integrate the water status of a given 
volume of soil. The radius of infuence is inversely proportional to the water content 
of the soil. For example, in a medium texture soil, the radius can vary from about 
0.5 m at the lower limit of soil water content to about 0.2 m when the soil is saturated.
The main drawbacks of the neutron probe are its high cost and the need for quali￾fed personnel, but, more importantly, using radioactive equipment implies that its 
use must abide by the safety regulations in place. Moreover, measurements cannot 
be automated, so the temporal resolution is low, and the installation of the access 
tubes may be diffcult in compacted or stony soils. Its main advantages are the high 
speed of measurement and the high reliability of the records when the probes are 
properly calibrated. Under these conditions, the neutron probe may be useful for 
deciding the timing and dose of irrigation.
21.3.3 Measurements of the Dielectric Constant of the Soil
TDR (time domain refectometry), FDR (frequency domain refectometry), and 
capacitive techniques are based on estimates of the soil dielectric constant, which 
mainly depends on its water content. This is because there is a sharp contrast 
between the dielectric constant of pure water (80) and that of dry soils (~2–5). 
The frst commercial applications of these techniques date back to the 1980s.
A TDR system consists of an oscilloscope connected to two metal rods that are 
inserted parallel into the soil. When an electric potential difference is applied to one 
end of the rods, the energy is transmitted along the rod until its end, where it is 
refected back toward the oscilloscope, where potential is continuously recorded. 
The transmission speed of the wave on the return trip depends on the dielectric 
constant of the medium (soil surrounding the rods), so it is possible to deduce the 
dielectric constant from the transit time of the wave through the rods.
TDR shows several advantages over other measurements of soil water status. 
First, the relationship between water content and dielectric constant is barely 
affected by soil type. This is important because it implies that the technique is 
Á. López-Bernal et al.301
theoretically independent of soil texture. However, special soil types like those of 
volcanic origin may require specifc calibrations. On the other hand, TDR measure￾ments have high temporal resolution and may be automated for long-term in situ 
monitoring. The main disadvantages of these devices include their high cost and the 
diffculty of installation of the rods within the soil. The contact between the sensors 
and the soil must be very close, because air has a very low dielectric constant 
that can distort the measurements; this generates errors in expansive soils, which 
fracture and tend to retract from the rods when drying. Finally, in saline or very wet 
soils or when the guides are very long, the signal attenuation can be excessive, 
so the refected signal may be insuffcient to be detected, and the measurement 
can fail.
Capacitance and FDR sensors determine the soil dielectric constant by measur￾ing the time required to charge a capacitor (formed by two electrodes) using the soil 
as the capacitor. Both techniques are soil specifc and hence may require calibration, 
but the cost of the devices is generally lower than that of TDR probe.
21.3.4 Tensiometers
Tensiometers measure the soil matric potential, which may be used to decide when 
to irrigate. The matric potential is negative (zero corresponds to free water), so it is 
convenient to express it as soil water tension, which is the opposite of the soil matric 
potential (i.e., its absolute value).
A classic tensiometer is a cylindrical tube with its upper part connected to a 
vacuum gauge and its bottom to a porous ceramic capsule. The capsule acts as a 
membrane permeable to water and solutes. This capsule is saturated with water and 
placed in contact with the soil at the measurement depth. If it is in contact with an 
unsaturated soil, the lower soil water potential will cause a suction of the water in 
the body of the tensiometer, which is detected by the vacuum gauge. As the soil 
dries, the gauge reading increases (the water leaves the tensiometer through the 
capsule). If the soil is wetted, the water reenters the capsule, which causes a reduc￾tion in the gauge reading.
The maximum tension that can be measured with a tensiometer is theoretically 
1 atm (100 kPa), although most tensiometers allow readings only between 0 and 
80 kPa. The soil water tension for a soil at feld capacity is between 10 and 30 kPa. 
In sandy and coarse texture soils, the threshold tension for irrigating can be within 
the 0–80 kPa interval. By contrast, in clay soils much of water content usable by 
plants can be out of the tensiometer range. When the tension exceeds 100 kPa, the 
pores of the ceramic capsule lose water, causing air entry that breaks the continuity 
of the water column, so the manometer displays a zero reading. As they work better 
with high values of soil water content, tensiometers are more suitable for irrigation 
scheduling in high-frequency irrigation systems. As a result, they have been more 
commonly used in perennial crops.

21.3.5 Equitensiometers
Equitensiometers allow an indirect determination of soil water potential. They are 
based on measuring the electrical resistance between two electrodes embedded in a 
porous material (gypsum, fberglass, or nylon matrixes) buried in the soil. Water and 
solutes are exchanged between the sensor and the soil, eventually reaching an equi￾librium in matric water potential. The lower the soil matric potential, the higher the 
resistance measured between the electrodes of the block; this relationship has to be 
calibrated in the laboratory. The measurement interval in which electrical resistance 
measurements are more accurate is for tensions above 10–30 kPa, depending on 
sensor material. Consequently, these instruments are more suitable for operation in 
medium or heavy textured soils. In gypsum-based sensors, the gypsum slowly dis￾solves which limits their service life to a few years (at best). The addition of gypsum 
to the soil during sensor installation can be useful for extending their life. As a fnal 
remark, they should not be used in saline soils, as the salt content affects the electri￾cal resistance.
21.3.6 Basic Criteria for Sensor Deployment
The optimum number and placement of devices for monitoring soil water status in 
the context of irrigation scheduling depend on several factors related to the crop, 
soil characteristics, and the irrigation system. When the majority of the roots are 
located near the surface (lettuce, potato, etc.), a single measurement point may pro￾vide enough information to track the system dynamics, while larger rooting depths 
require deploying several devices. Sensor placement depends on the spatial distribu￾tion of the roots. In furrow irrigated annual crops, devices should be located in the 
plant rows. In drip irrigation systems, they should be installed within the drip-wetted 
area but apart from the emitter. In the case of fruit tree orchards, they should be 
placed within the wetted area near the tree.
When analyzing sensor outputs, the trends and the velocity of record variations 
provide indication on whether enough water is being applied to meet the demand, 
which can be used to automate the operation of the irrigation system. This is illus￾trated in the following examples for partial and full cover drip irrigation systems:
– Partial cover irrigation (Fig. 21.8, left): Sensors may be distributed in two dimen￾sions. We can place one sensor at 10–20 cm from the emitter (sensor 1) that will 
act as a control and another in the wet bulb edge (sensor 2). It may be desirable 
to place another at a depth somewhat greater than that of the wet bulb. Any 
increase in the water content/potential in sensor 2 may indicate an excess of 
irrigation.
– Full cover irrigation (Fig.  21.8, right): Sensors should be placed at different 
depths. A sensor installed at a depth slightly greater than that reached by the wet 
bulb will show over-irrigation by increases in its measurements of water content/
potential.

Abstract
When the level of irrigation supply is less than crop ET, defcit irrigation (DI) 
programs are needed to optimize the use of the limited water. In annual crops 
where yield and transpiration are linearly related, DI aims at achieving maximum 
profts by minimizing application losses and maximizing the use of stored soil 
water and seasonal rainfall. Crops that respond positively to mild water defcits 
are good candidates for DI programs that decrease irrigation water use while 
maintaining yield. DI programs for fruit trees and vines aim at inducing water 
defcits when they are least harmful to yields, including high evaporative demand 
periods. Achieving optimal use of limited water is accomplished by solving an 
optimization problem using knowledge of water availability and cost and net 
farm profts.
22.1 Introduction
For many decades, the paradigm of irrigation development was to supply crops with 
suffcient water to meet their full water requirements. This approach was chosen 
because the large investments associated with irrigation networks, from dams to on￾farm equipment, were best justifed if farmers would achieve maximum yields, nor￾mally associated with maximum transpiration. Intensifcation of irrigation has been 
generalized worldwide in most of the irrigated lands. However, there were irrigation 
development situations where, to reach a maximum number of farmers, the irriga￾tion supply was less than that needed to meet the full crop demands. In other cases,

the system capacity was inadvertently designed to supply less than required. 
Sometimes, different crops or more intensive rotations were introduced, exceeding 
the capacity of the original system. More recently, water allocation to irrigation has 
been challenged by other sectors of society, so the supply has been reduced below 
the original allotment. Furthermore, periodic droughts cause water scarcity situa￾tions aggravated by excessive water use, so the irrigation water supply becomes 
more unreliable. Under water scarcity, irrigation has less priority than other sectors 
such as urban use or minimum environmental fows. Under all these conditions, 
farmers do not have suffcient irrigation water to meet the full crop water require￾ments, so crop transpiration will be reduced below its maximum potential. Normally, 
the decrease in transpiration results in a reduction in crop production of variable 
magnitude depending on many factors (Chap. 14). Defcit irrigation (DI) is thus 
defned as an irrigation management practice where insuffcient water is applied so 
crop transpiration stays below its maximum unstressed value. This chapter dis￾cusses how to manage DI to minimize yield reductions and maximize farmers’ pro￾ductivity and profts in situations of water scarcity.
22.2 The Yield Response Function to Water
DI forces farmers to solve an optimization problem: given a restricted level of sup￾ply, what is the optimum irrigation program to maximize their goals? Normally, 
farmers seek maximum revenue or net income from their operations, which is not 
necessarily equivalent to achieving maximum production. The basic information 
needed to optimize the use of a limited water supply through DI is the relationship 
between water applied and yield. If the yield and irrigation water (Y−I) relationship 
is known for a specifc situation at the feld scale, the manager can determine the 
optimum amount of I to reach maximum net profts. This will be the level of I above 
which, the value of the additional crop produced would be less than the cost of one 
additional water unit. Given the close, linear relationship between transpiration and 
biomass production discussed in Chap. 14, and because of the conservative nature 
of the harvest index (HI) of many crops, the relationship between transpiration and 
crop yield is linear for the major crops over a wide range of transpiration, starting 
with the maximum yield at the maximum, unstressed transpiration value. However, 
the relation between yield and irrigation water (Y−I) is not linear, and is primarily 
affected by the uniformity of distribution of irrigation water over the feld.
To better understand the Y−I relationships at the feld scale, Fig. 22.1 shows the 
variation in irrigation depth in different parts of the feld, going from the areas that 
receive more water than the required depth to the areas that receive less water than 
required. Such spatial differences are caused by variations within the irrigation sys￾tem that deliver different amounts in different parts of the feld due to manufacturer 
and pressure variations, wind effects, and other factors that cause a lack of unifor￾mity in water distribution. The shape and slope of the line that describes the actual 
water distribution in the feld (Fig.  22.1) represents the distribution uniformity,

Fig. 22.1 Relations between normalized irrigation water and the fraction of the irrigated area that 
receives at least that amount. XR indicates the level of water required as shown by the horizontal 
dashed line at 1.0, and another dashed line at 0.7 indicates a level of DI that is 30% less than 
XR. The actual water distribution across the feld is shown by the solid lines for full and defcit 
irrigation, going from the areas that receive the most water to the areas that receive the least
which is always less than 100% (horizontal lines). When this line has a high slope, 
we have a low uniformity, so some areas receive much more water than others. In 
the case of DI, where water applied is less than that required (see Fig. 22.1), some 
areas within the feld will receive much less than required, so local yields could be 
seriously diminished by severe water stress. On the other hand, deep percolation 
losses under DI are greatly reduced as most or all the limited irrigation water 
remains accessible to the root system, leading to a high effciency of water use.
To supply suffcient water to all the areas in a feld, additional water must be 
applied to arrive at the required depth in the areas that receive the least water. 
Figure 22.2 represents a generic yield response function with two levels of irrigation 
uniformity, high and low. The linear function between yield and ET is also shown. 
As irrigation increases, more irrigation water is not used in ET and is lost as runoff 
or deep percolation. If irrigation uniformity is high, losses would be small and max￾imum yields will be achieved with little excess water (Fig. 22.2). However, if uni￾formity is low, irrigation application has to increase to meet the needs of the areas 
that receive the least water, while others will be getting an excess. In the case of 
Fig. 22.2, water application under low irrigation uniformity must double the required 
amount to achieve maximum yields.

knowledge of the relation between Y and ET and the actual irrigation uniformity 
(Chap. 23).
22.3 Deficit Irrigation in Annual Crops
To defne the Y−I function, the relations between yield and transpiration (Ep) must 
be known. While the B−Ep relationship is unique for a given crop and is only 
affected by the environment in which the crop is grown, the Y−Ep relationship of a 
crop can vary depending on the timing and intensity of the Ep defcits. This is 
because of the differential sensitivity to water stress of the different crop develop￾mental stages. Water defcits imposed at sensitive stages affect disproportionally 
more the harvest index (HI) than biomass production, while the HI does not vary 
from the unstressed value if water defcits during the sensitive stages are avoided or 
are not severe enough. As a general rule, when transpiration defcits are imposed 
progressively and are moderate, HI is not affected, and the reduction in Y is propor￾tional to the reduction in B. Figure 22.3 shows the typical Y responses of an annual 
crop as ET is decreased by water defcits. The thick line represents the response to 
uniform, progressive water defcits, and the two steeper lines represent the responses 
when water defcits are more severe and/or occur at the most sensitive stages of crop 
development. In most annual crops, the most sensitive stages are those at which 
yield-determining processes (such as fowering, fruit set, and fruit growth) occur. 
For instance, in the case of grain crops, the reproductive stages are more sensitive

than the vegetative phase. By contrast, most horticultural herbaceous crops are not 
amenable to DI because generally they are harvested for fresh weight and size, 
which are very sensitive to water defcits. The following is a discussion of how DI 
can be designed for the major crops.
22.3.1 Maize
The most sensitive period to water defcits is fowering, from tasseling to silking. 
Severe water defcits during that period delay or prevent silk emergence, impairing 
pollination and resulting in very low grain numbers. Following in sensitivity is the 
early grain flling period where severe stress results in grain abortion. Late grain 
flling is less sensitive, and the least sensitive is the vegetative phase, as leaf growth 
recovers after the release of temporary water defcits. Note that during the vegeta￾tive phase, the goal is to develop a canopy that intercepts maximum radiation; thus 
irreversible reductions in canopy expansion caused by severe defcits also limit 
yield substantially. In general, maize is not a crop adapted to DI, as any reduction in 
Ep harms Y. Mild Ep defcits of around 10% or less, during the mid to late vegetative 
phase, have the least impact on production and may be a viable DI strategy in case 
of water scarcity.
22.3.2 Wheat
As in other winter cereals, fowering is the most sensitive period to water defcits, in 
particular the pollination to grain set period. However, the stages of development 
before and after pollination are also quite sensitive. In the pre-fowering phase, 
22 Defcit Irrigation310
when the number of forets in the spikes is being determined, water defcits may 
cause a reduction in grain numbers. After pollination, the abortion of grains also 
reduces grain numbers under water stress. Grain flling in its early stages is also 
quite sensitive to water defcits, which harms grain weight. During the early vegeta￾tive phase, wheat is quite tolerant to water defcits, but at the tillering stage, water 
defcits may reduce tiller numbers. Winter cereals have compensatory mechanisms, 
and a reduction in grain numbers may be partially compensated by increased grain 
weight if conditions during grain flling are favorable. Thus, defcit irrigation of 
wheat is a viable strategy if defcits are restricted to the early vegetative and late 
reproductive stages, with mild to moderate reductions in transpiration. There are 
situations, however, where farmers have limited access to irrigation water, suffcient 
to apply one irrigation only. In that case, depending on rainfall probability and soil 
water storage, the most proftable time to supplement rainfall would be around fow￾ering. In shallow soils and very low post-fowering rainfall probabilities, it should 
be delayed as much as possible to avoid severe stress during grain flling, while in 
the opposite case, the single irrigation would be most proftable at the pre-fowering 
stage to maximize the number of grains which could then be flled based on stored 
soil water.
22.3.3 Rice
Rice is generally grown under fooded conditions; thus it is not subjected to soil 
water defcits. However, newer rice-growing methods are based on wetting and dry￾ing of the soil. Rice has a small, shallow root system and is extremely sensitive to 
water defcits. The few (2–3) days around pollination time are the most sensitive to 
water defcits and can cause almost complete crop failure. It is not a crop suitable 
for defcit irrigation, so water supply must be concentrated on an area that permits 
meeting its full water requirements.
22.3.4 Soybean
Although it is an indeterminate-type plant, the fowering of most modern varieties 
is determinate, normally occurring during a 2–3-week period. Water defcits during 
fowering and fruit set are most detrimental to yield. The next, most sensitive period 
is seed flling, when water defcits cause premature leaf senescence and reduce seed 
flling. Water stress during the vegetative period affects canopy cover and hence 
radiation interception. When it occurs during the late part of that period, it is less 
detrimental, if it is not severe enough to cause premature, irreversible leaf senes￾cence. Soybean is mostly produced under rainfed conditions; thus the likelihood of 
using defcit irrigation is small; nevertheless, in terms of relative sensitivity, soy￾bean is quite sensitive to water defcits, about the same as maize; thus the DI strat￾egy should be quite conservative, aiming at producing at least 80–90% of full yields 
with limited irrigation.
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos311
22.3.5 Potato
It is very sensitive to water defcits and thus a candidate for DI strategies that only 
induce mild water stress. The most sensitive stage for yield is the time during stolon 
formation and tuber initiation. Irreversible effects on canopy expansion should be 
avoided during early canopy development. The period of tuber growth is less sensi￾tive, but yields are also affected, in particular if canopy senescence is hastened by 
water defcits. The relative sensitivity to water stress varies somewhat among the 
wide range of existing cultivars.
22.3.6 Sorghum
It is tolerant to water defcits and is a good substitute for maize when water short￾ages force DI. Mild to moderate water defcits have little or no impact on yields 
because of the increase in harvest index. The most favorable DI strategy is to sustain 
the level of water defcit throughout the season, for example, applying 75% of full 
ET needs, aiming to reach harvest time with the root zone profle exhausted of avail￾able water. Severe stress that reduces ET below 50–60% of the maximum causes a 
decrease in HI and is detrimental to yield. Thus, DI strategies in sorghum should 
keep ET above 60% of the maximum. The optimal economic level would be 70–80% 
of maximum ET depending on water availability and irrigation costs.
22.3.7 Tomato
Like many other vegetable crops, tomato is not amenable to defcit irrigation as 
yields are reduced with reductions in ET. However, in processing tomatoes, mild 
defcits reducing ET by less than 10% during ripening do not affect yield and 
increase dry matter content. Stress imposed during other developmental stages 
reduces canopy growth, fruiting, and yields.
22.3.8 Sugarcane
It is very sensitive to water defcits during the period of stalk growth, early in the 
crop cycle. The least sensitive period is maturation where mild to moderate defcits 
lead to increased sucrose accumulation in the stalk and reduction in harvest fresh 
weight (and harvest costs). Therefore, DI should aim at imposing some ET defcits 
during the maturation period with reductions of ET of no more than 10–15% of the 
seasonal value. On the other hand, water supply should not limit canopy growth 
until the crop reaches full cover.
22 Defcit Irrigation312
22.3.9 Cotton
It is a good candidate for DI where the season length is limited by low temperatures 
at the beginning and end of the season. Water defcits during the late vegetative 
growth period hasten fowering and boll formation, and during the maturation phase, 
they enhance boll opening and synchrony for effective mechanical harvest. Moderate 
water defcits during those two phases result in an increase in HI and a reduction in 
season length that better fts some environments. Again, as in sorghum, severe water 
stress is detrimental to net profts and reduces HI; thus DI should keep ET above 
60–70% of the maximum. The most sensitive period where water defcits should be 
avoided is during fruit set to prevent fruit abortion.
22.3.10 Sunflower
It is a drought-avoiding species with a high growth rate during the vegetative phase 
but low biomass accumulation during the reproductive stage when it accumulates 
high-energy fats and proteins. The period from the end of fowering to early fruit set 
is the most sensitive to water defcits, followed by early seed flling, late seed flling, 
early vegetative, and late vegetative. This is because sunfower has a strong compen￾satory growth capacity following the release of water defcits during the vegetative 
phase. DI strategies should aim at imposing moderate defcits during the vegetative 
phase, well after crop establishment but ending it before leaf growth is completed. 
Such a period is not very long relative to the crop cycle; thus, ET reductions should 
not exceed 10–20% of seasonal ET for optimum irrigated production.
22.4 Deficit Irrigation of Fruit Trees and Vines
The most powerful measure to respond to water scarcity in annual crops is to adjust 
the planted area to the available supply, planning a mild to moderate reduction in ET
(10–15%). This is not possible in permanent crops where the irrigated area cannot 
be reduced and the investment and maintenance costs are substantial, so sustaining 
the plantations is a primary objective. Occasionally, farmers may take advantage of 
drought years to replace old orchards with new ones of different species or cultivars. 
With such exception, to cope with a reduction in water supply, some form of DI is 
required to minimize the impact of water defcits. This is particularly important in 
permanent crops because water defcits also affect subsequent years’ production. 
Furthermore, there is a need to avoid the possibility of tree death with the negative 
economic consequences due to the multi-year investment losses if the plantation 
is lost.
The responses of fruit trees and vines to water defcits are much more complex 
and less understood than in annual crops. The yield-determining processes are also 
more complex and commonly, yields oscillate with time even under optimal grow￾ing conditions. This feature is called alternate bearing (Chap. 13), which varies in 
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos313
importance among the different fruit tree species and cultivars. Water defcits in the 
current season affect yields of the subsequent season(s), depending on its timing 
and severity. Knowledge of the sensitivity of the different processes to water defcits 
is required to allocate water to avoid harming the current and/or subsequent 
years’ yields.
One important beneft of DI in fruit trees and vines is related to the enhancement 
of fruit quality features caused by moderate water defcits. The most important case 
is that of wine grapes. Plants grown under moderate water defcits, applied both 
early during berry growth and late after the berries changed color, promote the syn￾thesis of several biochemical compounds that are essential wine quality compo￾nents. High-quality wines are produced mostly in rainfed environments or under 
substantial DI programs, while wines obtained from grapes grown under unlimited 
supply are seldom of good quality for winemaking. Other fruits beneft from an 
increase in the sugar content or other positive changes in composition induced by 
DI. With the exception of wine grapes, quality features have no effect on fruit prices 
received by farmers. Fruit size, which is appreciated in many markets, is reduced by 
DI, which makes it not viable, as in the case of apples.
Experiments with peach and pear trees demonstrated that irrigation may be 
restricted in periods when yields are insensitive to water stress and water can be 
saved with minimal or no yield loss, sometimes producing more net profts than 
under full irrigation. Imposing water stress on tree crops and vines at certain devel￾opmental stages considered the least sensitive to water defcits has been called regu￾lated defcit irrigation (RDI), a term now used for any DI approach followed in 
trees. However, there is another DI approach, applying a fraction of the ET through￾out the irrigation season. This sustained or continuous DI (CDI) strategy generates 
a stress pattern different than that of RDI, at least in temperate environments, where 
ET0 varies widely during the growing season. The usual stress pattern in CDI starts 
early in the season when a fraction of ET is applied, but trees extract additional 
water from the wet soil with the consequence that water defcits seldom develop. 
Depending on the magnitude of the defcit and the water storage capacity of the root 
zone, water defcits will increase in magnitude in CDI as the season progresses, 
reaching the highest level when ET0 is highest close or near the end of the season, in 
the absence of rainfall. This has the advantage of decreasing tree ET at a time of 
high evaporative demand, resulting in increased water use effciency (Chap. 14).
22.4.1 Regulated Deficit Irrigation
The physiological basis of RDI, i.e., imposing water stress at specifc developmental 
stages, resides in the differential sensitivity of vegetative growth and photosynthesis 
to water stress (Chap. 14). Expansive growth is more sensitive to water defcits than 
carbon assimilation; thus mild to moderate water stress slows down or stops leaf and 
stem growth before it impacts photosynthesis. During fruit growth of some tree spe￾cies, there are periods when vegetative growth takes place and fruit growth slows 
down almost to a stop. In those periods, water stress reduces growth in general, but 
22 Defcit Irrigation314
fruit growth can fully recover upon release of stress, while vegetative growth has 
been curtailed. The result is less vegetative growth (and less pruning costs) while 
fruit size is unaffected. There are some species where moderate water defcits 
change the partitioning of assimilates in favor of the fruits with benefcial effects on 
yield and fruit quality. In deciduous trees, the period after fruit harvest is another 
insensitive period where water defcits may be applied without affecting yield, pro￾vided that next year’s bud development processes have been completed.
The yield response to ET defcits generated by RDI strategies may be generalized 
as shown in Fig. 22.4. Three different response regions may be defned:
A: Small reductions in ET applied during insensitive periods do not reduce yields.
B: As ET defcits increase, yield decreases with a gentle slope.
C: Same as C but with a much steeper slope. Water defcits during the more sen￾sitive periods can reduce yields dramatically (dashed line in Fig. 22.4).
The width of Region A depends on the species:
– Non-existing: very sensitive species such as avocado, walnut, and apple
– 5–15% ET reduction: citrus (depending on species and cultivars), pears, 
almonds, etc.
– 10–20% ET reduction: peach, plum, apricot, pistachio, etc.
– 20–30% ET reduction: olive
Region B also varies in magnitude with species and cultivars following the dif￾ferential sensitivities indicated for Region A. The mild slope indicates that the water 
savings must be compared against yield losses to fnd an optimum net income under 
DI. On the contrary, the steep slopes of Region C suggest that ET defcits of such 
magnitude will have detrimental effects on net income and should be avoided at all 
costs. There are extreme drought situations, however, where the water supply is so

limited that tree survival is at risk. The limited information available suggests that 
severe pruning is not recommended as a measure to reduce ET and that a supply 
equivalent to 25–35% of unstressed ET is the minimum needed to prevent extensive 
tree death.
22.5 Deficit Irrigation at Farm Level
Water restrictions at the farm level force managers to make strategic decisions 
before planting. They must decide what crops to grow and how to allocate different 
water amounts to each crop to make the best use of the limited supply available. 
Different crops need different irrigation amounts with different timing. Economic 
issues (markets and subsidies) are critical in determining the farm’s net profts once 
the total supply available is known. The goal would be to optimize the use of land 
and irrigation water given the supply restrictions, which is achieved with economic 
optimization models. These models provide optimal cropping patterns and irriga￾tion amounts for each crop that maximize the objective function that is normally the 
total farm income. Once the model is built, it can be used to explore different sce￾narios of varying crop and water prices and other factors, such as the impact of 
changing subsidies on the strategic decisions of farmers. One complicating factor at 
the farm level is the uncertainty of water restrictions. Too often, water authorities 
delay the announcement of the restriction to farmers after some of the best options 
for using the limited water (e.g., early planting) are no longer viable. In the event of 
a drought, farmers must be proactive in securing their water supplies and maintain 
open communication with the water authority to make the best use of the limited 
water under uncertainty.

Abstract
The main irrigation performance indicators are distribution uniformity, adequacy, 
application effciency, and irrigation effciency. They evaluate different aspects 
of the irrigation process and have to be used jointly for a comprehensive assess￾ment. A simple model combining the spatial distribution of irrigation with the 
biomass-transpiration relationship allows the calculation of optimum irrigation 
amounts. For cheap water, optimum irrigation will seek maximum yield and will 
depend only on uniformity and the irrigation requirement. As water prices 
increase, economic factors play a key role in the calculation of optimum irriga￾tion. Irrigation uniformity has a large impact on the spatial variation of N uptake 
and losses. Conventional N fertilizer applications will lead to higher N losses 
than fertigation, which can be quantifed. The key parameters in the design and 
management of irrigation systems are the seasonal irrigation requirement and the 
peak irrigation system capacity. In locations with dry summers, the variability of 
the seasonal irrigation requirement depends only on rainfall variations, and the 
variability of peak irrigation is negligible. The dose of irrigation events can be 
calculated following similar rules for all irrigation methods.

23.1 Introduction
The fnal purpose of an irrigation system is to supply water to meet the crop evapo￾transpiration (ET) and, thus, allow stomatal opening for photosynthesis’ supply of 
CO2 while keeping the plants at an adequate temperature. Other uses of irrigation 
(frost protection, solarization, fertilizer and pesticide application, soil conditioning 
for sowing or harvest) may also be important in agricultural practice. On the other 
hand, irrigation interacts with other farm operations reducing the time available or 
even the possible dates of irrigation. The key parameters in the design and manage￾ment of irrigation systems are the peak irrigation system capacity and the seasonal 
irrigation requirement. Both depend mostly on crop ET, which in turn will be 
affected partly by the irrigation system. The crop and the soil will also affect the 
optimum irrigation interval and, thus, the irrigation depth per event. Each irrigation 
method will also have specifc parameters that will require optimization like appli￾cation rate in pressurized systems.
23.2 Irrigation Uniformity and Efficiency
The analysis starts by determining how applied irrigation varies in space. Figure 23.1
shows an example of the measured distribution of applied irrigation in a feld. The 
lack of uniformity implies the existence of areas with excess and areas with defcit 
irrigation. The intersection of the curve and the horizontal line of the target (required)

F. J. Villalobos and L. Mateos319
depth shows the fraction of the feld adequately irrigated, i.e., where ET is not lim￾ited by water stress.
The distribution of applied water with localized irrigation is measured by collect￾ing the volume of water discharged by a sample of emitters. In sprinkler irrigation, 
applied water is collected in a grid of catch cans. In furrow irrigation, the applied 
water is measured at the furrow inlet and infltrated water is estimated from the 
measured infltration time.
Several performance indexes have been proposed to benchmark irrigation sys￾tems for their design and management.
The low quarter distribution uniformity, DUlq, describes the level of irrigation 
uniformity:
DU
I
I lq
lq = ×
avg
100
(23.1)
where Ilq is the mean application in the 25% lowest depths and Iavg is the aver￾age depth.
In general, the target depth should be equal to the irrigation required (It = Ireq). To 
quantify how irrigation meets the target depth, we use irrigation adequacy, AD, the 
fraction of the feld that receives at least the required (target) depth (It). It may be 
approximated using the low quarter adequacy, ADlq, as:
AD
I
I lq
lq
t
= ×100
(23.2)
If ADlq = 1.0, only 12.5% of the feld will be under-irrigated. The target depth may 
be the soil water defcit, SWD (Chap. 20). If salt leaching is required, then It should 
be greater than the SWD at the time of irrigation (Chap. 24).
Application effciency, AE, is the ratio of target and average applied depth, i.e., 
evaluates how irrigation applied meets the target irrigation depth. Therefore:
AE
I
I
DU t lq
lq
= × = ×
avg AD
100 100
(23.3)
This equation shows that AE will increase as uniformity increases but may be 
achieved also by reducing irrigation (with lower AD). Note that for a given unifor￾mity, high AD requires reducing the AE.
Another interesting, albeit harder to measure, indicator is irrigation effciency, 
IE, the ratio of irrigation water benefcially used by the crop to the amount of water 
that leaves the boundaries (applied—Δ water stored in soil) of the system:
IE
I = − × Irrig water beneficially used
soil water avg
.
∆

(23.4)
23 Optimizing Irrigation320
The equation may be applied to the soil root depth of a feld, a farm, an irrigation 
scheme, or a whole watershed. The water benefcially used is mostly ET but also 
includes salt leaching requirements and water used for preparing the seedbed, crop 
establishment, and harvest preparation. Non-benefcial uses include deep percola￾tion above leaching requirements, surface runoff, weed transpiration and evapora￾tion from reservoirs, sprinklers, and wetted soil.
IE is estimated using water balance models. If the water benefcially used equals 
the target depth, then AE is an estimate of the maximum IE, i.e., IE is lower than 
AE. Furthermore, the difference between AE and IE may be large, for instance, 
when irrigation is applied at the end of the growing season unless the applied depth 
is corrected (see Chap. 20).
23.3 Quantitative Optimization of Irrigation 
at the Field Level
We start with the assumption that biomass production is proportional to transpira￾tion and that the harvest index does not change with the level of water stress (Chap. 
14). This is valid for mild to moderate stress. Therefore, yield will be proportional 
to transpiration in any location of the irrigated feld. We also assume that evapora￾tion from the soil surface (Es) is equal in all points of the feld and that excess irriga￾tion has no penalty on yield (but see Sect. 23.4).
We assume that applied irrigation follows a uniform (i.e., rectangular) distribu￾tion. Therefore applied irrigation (I) will lie between a minimum and a maximum:
I I
DUlq
min a = vg
4 1−
3 (23.5)
I I
DUlq
max a = vg
7 4 −
3 (23.6)
where Iavg is the average irrigation applied and DUlq is the low quarter uniformity 
coeffcient (Sect. 23.2). The irrigation crop water requirement was defned in 
Chap. 10 as:
I E req e = − T P − SWE ∗ (23.7)
where ET*
 is unstressed (i.e., maximum) seasonal crop ET, Pe is effective precipita￾tion, and SWE is soil water extracted from the soil between planting and harvest.
We have three possible situations:
(a) Imax < Ireq: The whole feld is under-irrigated. In this case, yield will be propor￾tional to transpiration and thus to the irrigation applied in each point of the feld.
(b) Imin > Ireq: The whole feld is over-irrigated, so yield will be Yx (maximum yield).
F. J. Villalobos and L. Mateos321
(c) Imin < Ireq < Imax: Parts of the feld are over-irrigated, and parts are under-irrigated, 
so the former will reach Yx, while the latter will produce a yield in proportion to 
irrigation received in that location.
To calculate the average yield (Yavg) in the whole feld, we calculate the integral 
of yield using applied irrigation (I) as the variable of integration. For instance, for 
the third case, we calculate:

And for the second case, (Imin > Ireq), Yavg = Yx.
The equations above are also helpful to calculate ET as a function of irrigation

which is valid when Imin < Ireq < Imax. If Imax < Ireq, then ET is SWE+Pe+Iavg. The dif￾ference Iavg-ET will be the average deep percolation (DP) in the feld.
The model illustrates several points:
(a) To achieve maximum yield, it is necessary to apply 3 Ireq/(4 DUlq−1). For 
instance, with DUlq = 0.75, the gross irrigation should be 150% of the irrigation 
requirement.
23 Optimizing Irrigation322
(b) If we improve irrigation uniformity and apply the same total irrigation, the ET
will increase (Eq. 23.11). This is part of the so-called rebound effect of modern￾ization of irrigation schemes, which may lead to increased water use, thus limit￾ing the generation of water savings.
(c) The maximum proft per unit area is achieved with less water than that required 
for maximum yield. The optimum value will depend on the price of harvest (PH, 
€/kg) and the cost of irrigation water (QI, €/m3
):

F Q E

(23.13)
Note that PH should be corrected to discount variable costs.
This equation indicates that the optimum irrigation amount is related to the irri￾gation system (DUlq), to the crop species and location (ratio Epx/Yx), and to external 
economic factors (ratio QI/PH). The ratio Epx/Yx is proportional to Vapor Pressure 
Defcit (VPD)  and larger for C3 than for C4 species (Chap. 14). Therefore, the 
optimum irrigation of a given crop should decrease as we move to a drier 
environment.
As F gets very small, the optimum irrigation will only depend on DUlq, i.e., with 
free water we will try to reach maximum yield by applying an irrigation amount 
inversely proportional to DUlq (Fig. 23.2).
Example 23.1
We are growing maize with maximum yield of 16,000 kg/ha and seasonal ET
of 750 mm with Es = 150 mm. Pe and SWE are 150 and 100 mm, respectively. 
The irrigation system is sprinkler with DUlq = 0.75. The price of maize is 
0.3 €/kg. If the water price is 0.05 €/m3
, then F = 300/4800 = 0.0625, so the 
optimum irrigation will be 688 mm. In this case yield would be 15,950 kg/ha 
(from Eq. 23.9). With water price of 0.15 €/m3
, we should apply 600 mm to 
get a fnal yield of 15,667 kg/ha.

23.4 Irrigation Uniformity and Efficient Use of N
When N fertilizer is applied with irrigation water (fertigation; Chap. 29), the amount 
of N will vary spatially in proportion to applied irrigation. Crop yield will then be 
proportional to water applied according to the equations presented in 23.3. N loss 
may be estimated as the product of deep percolation (DP) and the average N con￾centration of irrigation water. This is a conservative estimate as the N concentration 
of drainage water will exceed that of irrigation water. To achieve maximum yield, 
we would need an excess N proportional to DP/Iavg.
On the other hand, with conventional fertilization, N is managed independently 
of irrigation and we have a more complex situation (Fig. 23.3). There will be:
– Areas under-irrigated: Water will limit yield, so we will have an excess N that 
may be leached after the growing season.
– Areas over-irrigated: N is limiting yield. N losses during the growing season will 
be proportional to the water excess.
Therefore, spatially uniform (conventional) application of N leads to higher N 
losses and lower yield than using fertigation. The main difference in N loss should 
occur after the growing season in under-irrigated areas.
One consequence of this analysis is that conventional (uniform) N application 
limits yield in proportion to irrigation applied. To achieve maximum yield, we

Example 23.2
In Example 23.1 we evaluated the optimum irrigation for maize when low 
quarter DU = 0.75. If the water price is 0.05 €/m3
, the optimum average irriga￾tion is 688 mm, while the irrigation requirement is 500 mm. If the total N 
fertilizer required is 270 kg N/ha:

should add an excess N to ensure enough N supply in the area of maximum irriga￾tion, i.e., the excess N would be equal to N leaching with Imax. If the N fertilizer 
required for maximum yield is Nf, the amount of fertilizer to apply is:

req (23.14)
In addition to drainage losses during the season, the under-irrigated areas of the feld 
(to the right of AD in Fig. 23.3) will have more residual N left at the end of the sea￾son which could be lost in the fallow period depending on management and rainfall. 
The N loss would vary from zero (at point AD in Fig. 23.3) to a maximum at the 
point of minimum yield.
F. J. Villalobos and L. Mateos325
23.5 Peak and Seasonal Irrigation Demand
Planning of irrigated areas or the design of an irrigation system should consider two 
main parameters for the farm, the maximum system capacity (Qmax in L/s/ha) and 
the seasonal irrigation (Isum, m3
/ha). The frst determines the required pumping 
capacity and the second the storage or allocation needed. The cost of irrigation sys￾tems and reservoirs will be proportional to both parameters, so they need to be 
optimized.
The main driver of peak and seasonal irrigation is ET. There is still some confu￾sion regarding the effect of the ground cover and irrigation system on ET. For trees, 
it is common to use a factor to reduce the crop coeffcient as a function of the ground 
cover. However, that requires a standard defnition of the crop coeffcient. Crop 
coeffcients should include the effect of intercepted radiation, so the values shown 
in Appendix C in Chap 10 require no further adjustments.
The effect of the irrigation system on ET depends on four factors, namely, plant 
wetting (or not), fraction of ground cover, fraction of soil wetted, and frequency of 
irrigation. Some authors use the maximum of ground cover and fraction of wet soil 
to establish a minimum value of crop coeffcient. This approach is partly right 
although it ignores the frequency of irrigation. On the other hand, intercepted radia￾tion depends not only on the ground cover but also on crop height, leaf area density, 
solar angle, and crop row orientation. Therefore, corrections of Kc based on ground 
cover should be taken with caution and superseded by intercepted radiation.
(a) With fertigation, we could apply a concentration of 270 kg N/5000 m3
 = 
0.054 kg N/m3
. In points of the feld receiving more water than Ireq, we 
reach maximum yield and have excess N.
In points receiving less than Ireq, water is the limiting factor. The average 
N lost with drainage would be total drainage (1880 m3
/ha) times the con￾centration (0.054 kg N/m3
), 101.5 kg N/ha. Total applied N should be 
270 + 101.5 = 371.5 kg N/ha.
(b) With conventional fertilization, assuming that N loss is proportional to 
drainage, we will have maximum N loss where maximum irrigation is 
applied (915 mm). At that point, drainage is 415 mm (45% of irrigation 
applied), so we can estimate N loss as 45% of N applied. Then, 55% of N 
applied will be available. To avoid N defciency, we should apply 
270/.55 = 494 kg N/ha. If we applied only 371.5 kg N/ha, then yields 
would decrease as I increases (N would be more limiting). The same 
result would be achieved using Eq. 23.14.
Example 23.2 (continued)
23 Optimizing Irrigation326
23.5.1 Seasonal Irrigation
The maximum seasonal irrigation could be calculated to satisfy the needs of the 
most demanding crop every year. This is rarely the case as the planning is often 
based on satisfying a probability level (e.g., 80%) for a given crop rotation. There 
are several factors to consider in determining the average and minimum irrigation 
amounts:
– Calculations should be performed using crop simulation or water balance mod￾els. For instance, CropET (https://www.uco.es/ftotecnia/cropET.html) allows 
the integration of salinity, uniformity, and economic factors in the calculation of 
irrigation requirements. The results of the model can be used to calculate the 
statistics of the seasonal irrigation requirement, like those shown in Table 23.1. 
In that case, maize ET is higher in the drier location, but the coeffcient of varia￾tion of ET is similar in Calipatria and McArthur. However, the crop water 
requirement is more variable in the wet location due to variability in rainfall.
– Crop rotations are usually preferred to monocultures (Chap. 36). When winter 
crops are included, the overall farm water demand will decrease strongly. 
However, designing for the average rotation limits the fexibility of the system.
– If permanent crops like fruit trees or vineyards are considered, we should ensure 
that enough water is available every year at least for tree survival. Unfortunately, 
mortality due to water stress is highly dependent on acclimation, so it is not easy 
to determine a minimum allocation for keeping the trees alive.
– Some crops satisfy specifc demands of the industry (e.g., processed tomato, 
tobacco) or the fresh market (vegetables) that require security in the product sup￾ply and, therefore, require a guaranteed supply of irrigation water.
– Socioeconomic aspects may be critical for water allocation. Small amounts of 
water may be highly effcient in producing winter horticultural crops, while large 
amounts of irrigation water may be spent in subsidized summer crops. The opti￾mal allocation will depend on the scale: a single farmer will try to get the maxi￾mum proft from the farm, while a community (e.g., region) may try to improve 
its gross product, employment, or environmental conditions.
Example 23.3
In hedgerow tree orchards, the fraction of intercepted radiation (Q) is propor￾tional to tree volume per unit surface area (Chap. 3, Sect. 3.8). With a distance 
between rows of 4 m, trees of height 3.5 m and width 1 m (25% ground cover) 
will intercept the same as trees with height 3.0 m and width 1.2 m (30% GC). 
The crop coeffcient scales up with the fraction of intercepted radiation (Chap. 
10), so both orchards would have the same Kc despite the difference in GC.

Maximum defcit (mm) 101 99 93 84 75
23.5.2 Maximum System Capacity
The maximum crop demand changes from year to year as ET and rainfall change. 
Interannual variability in maximum ET increases from dry to wet summer areas. As 
rainfall and ET may be inversely related because of cloudiness, we should directly 
analyze the distribution of ET-P. The two locations analyzed in Table 23.1 have 
median irrigation requirements in July of 46 and 63 mm/week for McArthur (wet) 
and Calipatria (dry), respectively, with similar CVs, below 8.5%. Therefore, the 
variability of peak ET is low in locations with dry summers. Furthermore, in those 
places, summer crops will also show a low variability in seasonal ET as summer ET
will be its main contributor (Table 23.1).
When applied irrigation cannot meet the maximum crop demand, a water defcit 
occurs. The impact will be proportional to the time integral of the water defcit and 
will depend strongly on the phenological phase (Chaps. 14 and 22). Nevertheless, a 
high probability level (e.g., 80%) will ensure that even when the irrigation require￾ment exceeds the irrigation capacity, the water defcit will not be severe. Example 
23.4 shows the case of cotton irrigation in Riverside. The probability of not meeting 
the ET demand is reduced as we increase Qmax. If we adopt Qmax of 50 mm/week, 
which is the average ET in July, we will have water stress in 58% of the years, reach￾ing a maximum soil water defcit of 99 mm. If we take a value of 55 mm/week (80% 
probability level), some water stress will occur in 24% of years only, with a maxi￾mum SWD of 93 mm.

23.6 Irrigation Duration and Interval
We may write a general equation for the depth of irrigation in a single event:
I Z f PAW AD IR WI T q
A w
I
avg = = ⋅ = (23.15)
where:
Z: rooting depth (m)
fw: fraction of soil area wetted by irrigation
PAW: plant available water (mm/m)
AD: allowable depletion
IR: gross daily irrigation requirement (mm/day)
WI: interval between irrigations (days)
TI: irrigation duration (hours)
q: discharge of emitter (sprinkler or dripper) or fow into irrigation unit (e.g., furrow, 
basin) (L/hour)
A: area covered by one emitter or irrigation unit (m2
)
For the design of irrigation systems, we may frst consider the worst conditions, 
i.e., maximum ET period that will correspond to the minimum irrigation interval.
WI Z f PAW AD
IR
w
min
max
= (23.16)
Then we should consider how to adapt to periods with lower ET either by reducing 
the depth of irrigation per event or by increasing the irrigation interval. Surface 
irrigation systems are especially infexible for that purpose. In drip irrigation and 
full-coverage sprinklers, the easiest way of adapting irrigation to lower demand is 
by reducing the duration of irrigation events while keeping the interval. In hand￾move sprinkler systems, we should increase the irrigation interval, as costs are pro￾portional to the number of irrigations. For surface irrigation, we will try to keep the 
same irrigation duration and use the dates that generate less water defcit.
Example 23.5
We want to irrigate cotton spaced 1 m with a peak net daily irrigation require￾ment of 8 mm/day on a sandy loam soil of 1 m depth and saturated hydraulic 
conductivity of 25 mm/h. The plot has a length of 150 m.
We choose PAW = 120 mm/m and AD = 0.7.
Alternative 1. Hand-move sprinkler irrigation with 12 × 12 m spacing, 1 h 
required to move the lateral. Application effciency 80%. Therefore, the gross 
daily irrigation requirement will be 10  mm/day. With full cover irriga￾tion fw = 1.
(continued)
F. J. Villalobos and L. Mateos329
The minimum irrigation interval would be:
Z f PAW AD
IR
w = ≅
84

8 days
To irrigate every 8 days, we should apply a gross depth of 80 mm per event. 
Each sprinkler irrigates 12 × 12 = 144 m2
, so:
80
144 = T qI
Now, depending on the availability of labor during the day and of addi￾tional irrigation equipment (pipes, sprinklers), we will decide the best combi￾nation of sprinkler discharge and irrigation duration. For instance, to maximize 
the time of operation, we could set irrigations of 11 h with 0.29 L/s discharge 
sprinklers. This option gives around 7 mm/h of application rate, which is well 
below the maximum infltration rate of the soil.
Alternative 2. Furrows 1 m wide and 150 m long. Application effciency 
65%. We have water in the canal only 1 day per week (this is a typical rota￾tional distribution of water among the farms in an irrigation scheme).
We cannot adopt an irrigation interval of 14 days in the period of maximum 
ET (14 × 8 = 112 mm exceeds the critical soil water defcit, 84 mm). Therefore, 
we have to adopt WI = 7 days and the amount of irrigation to apply is:

Abstract
Salinity threatens the sustainability of many agricultural systems, especially irri￾gated areas in arid and semiarid zones. Salt concentration in the soil is measured 
as electric conductivity (EC) of the saturated extract (ECe). Besides the possible 
specifc toxicity, the main effect of salts is the reduction of soil osmotic potential 
causing an effect similar to that of water defcit. The expected yield under saline 
conditions can be calculated with a simple model whose parameters are the 
threshold ECe and the yield loss per unit increase in ECe. The salt balance equa￾tion may be used to deduce soil salinity as a function of the EC of the irrigation 
water and the leaching fraction (LF). The required LF is calculated as a function 
of the irrigation frequency, the EC of the irrigation water and the desired ECe. 
The presence of Na deteriorates soil structure, but the effect depends on other 
factors, especially the salinity of irrigation water.

24.1 Introduction
According to FAO, around 20% of irrigated land occupies salt-affected soils, while 
salts affect less than 3% of dryland agricultural area. Salt-affected land is mainly 
located in irrigated arid and semiarid areas. Preventing the buildup of salts in soils 
and waters with adequate management is crucial for avoiding land degradation and 
thus for ensuring the sustainability of agriculture. In the case of irrigated areas, 
sustainability relies on maintaining an appropriate salt balance in the soil, which 
depends on the salt concentration of irrigation water and the soil water balance.
The primary source of salts is the weathering of minerals, but this source hardly 
causes soil salinization of agricultural soils. Soil salinization results from the exter￾nal supply of salts in irrigation water. In rainfed agriculture, it is related to second￾ary salinization phenomena, usually caused by the upward movement of water and 
salts from the subsoil caused by changes in hydrology. Therefore, the salt and water 
balances are tightly coupled. The salt concentration in the soil solution is greater 
than that of the water that infltrates. This difference is the result of soil evaporation 
not carrying salts while root water uptake only does so very selectively. Therefore, 
salinity is a real threat in agricultural areas of arid or semiarid regions due to the 
high ET rates and the scarcity of water needed for leaching the salts out of the 
root zone.
The contribution of salts from rainwater is insignifcant. Irrigation water is often 
the cause of salinization, as all irrigation waters contain salts in varying concentra￾tions. On the other hand, excess irrigation causes percolation that leaches salts that 
may eventually reach the sea. The sea can also be the direct source of salinization 
like in coastal areas when winds carry salts in aerosols. Soils originating from 
marine sediments can be saline, or marine intrusions can cause salinization of 
groundwater origin, i.e., by upward movement of water from a saline water table. In 
addition to the natural sources of salt, excessive application of fertilizers can also 
contribute to salinization.
24.2 Effects of Salinity on Crops
Salinity is quantifed as the electrical conductivity of the soil solution (EC, dS/m) or 
by the salt concentration (CS, g L−1
) which is approximately related by CS = 0.64 
EC. The concentration of cations (CC, or anions, meq/L) is roughly proportional to 
the EC by CC ≈ 10 EC. The osmotic potential (Ψo, kPa) may be estimated from the 
salt concentration as Ψo = −56.25 CS. Table 24.1 shows intervals of salinity in dif￾ferent water types.
The electrical conductivity is commonly measured in a saturated soil extract 
(ECe) which is approximately half the value of that at feld capacity (ECFC). To sim￾plify the measurement of soil salinity, instead of saturated paste, we may use a mix 
of 1 part of dry soil and 5 of water (EC1:5) and then estimate ECe taking into account 
the texture (c, percent clay):

Example 24.1
A nonsaline soil (called A) at the wilting point has a matric potential 
of -1500 kPa and soil water potential is −1500 kPa. We have another soil 
(called B), with the same texture, but saline. Soil B is at feld capacity (matric 
potential 20 kPa) and has ECe = 8.4 dS/m (so ECFC = 16.8 dS/m). Therefore, 
soil B has an osmotic potential −1480 kPa and a soil water potential −1500 kPa. 
Despite having the same soil water potential, transpiration is zero for soil A, 
while in soil B, it can be signifcant for several crop species (e.g., rye).

The effects of a high salt concentration in the soil on crop performance are due 
to (i) the reduction of osmotic potential in the soil solution, which in many aspects 
mimics that of water defcits, and (ii) the toxicity and nutrition disorders (antagonis￾tic effects) caused by major ions present in salts (Cl, Na, B). The negative effects of 
salinity on crops depend on the particular species and the developmental stage. An 
additional problem occurs with sodium accumulation in soil, a problem defned as 
soil sodicity, which causes degradation of soil structure.
The main difference between soil water defcit and the osmotic effect due to salts 
is that the former has two effects. The frst is to lower the soil water potential, so 
roots need an even lower potential for absorbing water. The second is the decrease 
in hydraulic conductivity of dry soil so that even with a lower potential in the roots, 
water movement to the root surfaces is limited by the low hydraulic conductivity. 
The effect of salinity corresponds to the frst effect but the hydraulic conductivity is 
not affected.
24.2.1 Impacts of Salinity on Crop Productivity
A soil is classifed as saline when ECe exceeds 4 dS/m. This level represents less 
than 10% of the salinity of seawater (50–60 dS/m) but is suffcient to affect nega￾tively the growth of many crop plants. Increasing the concentration of salts in the 
soil involves a decrease of osmotic potential, and therefore a decrease in the soil 
24 Control of Salinity334
water potential and thus in shoot water potential, which ultimately leads to reduced 
expansive growth.
There is a wide variability in the sensitivity of crop species and cultivars within 
a species to salinity. A simple model has been proposed where the sensitivity is 
quantifed by two parameters. The frst is a threshold salinity value, ECeu (measured 
as soil ECe) above which yield decreases. The second parameter (Bs) is the percent 
of yield loss per unit increase in ECe. The relative yield (Y/Yx) expressed as a frac￾tion of the maximum yield is calculated as:

Maas and Hoffman published in 1977 a review on crop tolerance to salinity, 
which is partly summarized in Table  24.2. The crops are classifed as sensitive, 
moderately sensitive, moderately tolerant, and tolerant according to the values of 
the parameters ECeu and Bs (Table 24.3). As shown in Table 24.3, most fruit trees are 
sensitive, most horticultural crops are moderately sensitive, and most feld crops lie 
between moderately sensitive and moderately tolerant.
The information in Table 24.2 has to be taken with caution since the response 
of plants varies with development stages and growing conditions (climate, soil 
management and irrigation, cultivar, etc.). Furthermore, it should be noted that the 
data in Table 24.2 were determined with surface irrigation following conventional 
management, including the application of excess water to obtain a steady state and 
uniform distribution of salts throughout the root zone. However, soil ECe may vary 
substantially during the growing season, so the application of Eq.  24.2 is not 
straightforward, but would represent the response of a given crop to the long-term, 
uniform application of irrigation water of a given EC.
24.2.2 Specific Toxicity
Toxicity occurs when certain ions are absorbed by the plant and accumulate to con￾centrations high enough to cause crop damage. Toxicity related to saline conditions 
is ascribed to ions usually present in soluble salts, mainly Na and Cl, and B, fre￾quently found in saline irrigation waters. The frst symptoms are usually marginal 
leaf burn and interveinal chlorosis. The sensitivity of crops to ion toxicity is quite 
variable with tree crops being the most sensitive, which may be affected by low ion 
concentrations (see Table 24.2). Under high evaporative demand, ion accumulation 
is faster, thus enhancing the toxic effect.
Toxicity can also be due to the direct absorption of Cl or Na through the leaves 
(e.g., sprinkler irrigation). This may be an important problem in sensitive crops such 
as citrus.

24.3 Irrigation Systems and Distribution of Salts
Salts accumulate where leaching is limited at a depth that depends on the amount of 
drainage water. Lack of drainage causes the buildup of a water table near the surface 
from where water evaporates, bringing salts to the uppermost soil layers and caus￾ing salinization. This is shown in Fig. 24.1 where a saline water table at a depth of 
100 cm and EC = 10 dS/m is the source of water that evaporates, resulting in a high 
concentration of salts on the surface. Something like this has also occurred under 
rainfed conditions, for example, in the Murray Basin and other areas in Australia. 
The substitution of evergreen forests with high ET for crops that use less water has 
changed the hydrology of basins, leading to the accumulation of excess water in the 
lowlands, where the water table rose with the consequent soil salinization. The 
problem is of such magnitude it is estimated that in 50 years it could affect 25% of 
the cultivated area of Australia unless specifc measures are adopted to alleviate the 
problem.
Figure 24.2 shows a different profle of salt concentration. In this case, the salts 
were accumulated in the lower layers due to leaching. Heavy rainfall during winter 
helped in salt leaching and the EC decreased across the soil profle. This would be 
the typical salinity profle in irrigated semiarid areas without a water table.
Since salts move with water in the soil, the irrigation method affects their distri￾bution of salts. Figure 24.3 distinguishes areas where salts concentrate more or less 
depending on the irrigation method. Furrow irrigation provides leaching in almost 
the entire surface of the ground, except in the ridges. Drip irrigation wets only part

of the ground, so leaching occurs only under the emitters, while the remainder of the 
surface tends to accumulate salts, particularly at the edges of the wetted zones. 
Overhead sprinkler or food irrigation leaches salts evenly throughout the feld 
depending on the uniformity of irrigation.
The EC of the soil solution increases as the soil water is depleted, so the osmotic 
effect of salts depends on the actual soil water content. This is illustrated in Fig. 24.4
where changes in EC of the soil solution are parallel to changes in soil water poten￾tial. Irrigation frequency also affects the concentration of the salts. High-frequency 
irrigation keeps high soil water content and is, therefore, able to maintain a lower 
salt concentration in soil solution. In addition, a relatively constant high soil water 
content counteracts the effect of salinity on water potential by preventing low matric 
potentials in soil. On the contrary, low-frequency irrigation involves drying cycles 
with very low soil water potential before each irrigation (Fig. 24.4). This is one 
reason why drip irrigation in cotton with saline water is advantageous compared to 
traditional furrow irrigation.

Fig. 24.5 Effects of bed shape and plant distribution on salt accumulation and emergence of fur￾row irrigated crops. (Adapted from Rhoades and Loveday (1990))
The potentially harmful salts in the soil are those located where root absorption 
occurs, which must be considered when surveying soil salinity in a feld.
Germinating seeds and emerging seedlings are especially sensitive to salinity, 
so crop establishment is the most critical stage for some species, especially under 
furrow irrigation. The seedbed confguration, the design of the irrigation system, 
and the distribution of plants can have a huge impact on crop establishment in saline 
conditions. Figure 24.5 illustrates various situations for furrow irrigation. Planting 
on fat ridges with lateral furrow irrigation leads to an accumulation of salts in the 
center of the ridge. This can be avoided by widening the bed and creating a small 
furrow in the middle to separate the two central rows. The situation can be further 
improved if planting is performed on sloping beds with a central furrow that is 
watered until crop establishment.
In sodic soils (see Sect. 2.4.4), surface crusts develop and prevent seedling emer￾gence. This may be alleviated by sprinkler irrigation (small doses, high frequency) 
which also would reduce salt concentration close to the seeds. Alternatively, 
mechanical removal of the crust in the rows could be benefcial although it is 
feasible only in small plots.
24 Control of Salinity340
24.4 Salt Balance and Leaching Fraction
To quantify the risk of soil salinization, it is necessary to evaluate its salt balance. 
This balance implies that the quantity of salts entering the system minus the amount 
going out equals the increase in the salt content of the soil (ΔS):
∆S V C V C S S V C S S = + w w r r + +s f − + ( ) d d p c + (24.3)
where V and C refer to volume and concentration, respectively, corresponding to the 
irrigation water (w) , rain (r), and drainage (d). Ss, Sf , Sp, and Sc are the amounts of 
salts released from the soil (by dissolution or weathering), provided as fertilizer, 
precipitated and absorbed by the crop, respectively, during the period.
To prevent soil salinization, the amount of salts in the soil should be constant 
(ΔS = 0). We simplify Eq. 24.3 assuming Ss+Sf = Sp+Sc and neglecting the term 
related to rainfall, so:
V Cw w = V Cd d (24.4)
The leaching fraction (LF) is defned as the ratio of the drainage volume and 
the irrigation volume. Using Eq.  24.3, and replacing concentration by electrical 
conductivity, LF can be expressed as:
LF
V
V
EC
EC
d
w

d
= = (24.5)
Therefore, by changing the LF, we can control the salt concentration in the soil 
solution within values above the salt concentration of irrigation water. This is shown 
in Fig.  24.6 for different LFs. Note that the soil EC increases with increasing 
depth, taking values at the soil surface similar to 50%  of that of  the irrigation 
water (see Sect. 24.5). As LF decreases, this variation with depth is more pronounced.
24.5 Salinity Profiles and Crop Yields
The soil EC profles are affected by the EC of irrigation water and the LF. This soil 
EC refers to soil water content at feld capacity. To convert to ECe (which is required 
to apply Eq. 24.2), we use a factor of 0.5, as ECe is roughly half of EC at feld 
capacity (ECFC).
We will now show how EC varies with depth in the soil with the following 
example.
Example 24.2
The electrical conductivity of irrigation water is 1 dS/m. Drainage is 25% of 
applied irrigation (LF = 0.25). The EC of the drainage water is obtained by 
dividing ECw by 0.25, i.e., ECd = 4 dS/m.

Example 24.3
A bean crop (ECeu = 1.0 dS/m, Bs = 19%/dS/m) is irrigated with water of 
1.5 dS/m with a leaching fraction of 0.2. We assume a water uptake distribu￾tion of the type 40-30-20-10 (the soil is divided into 4 parts of equal depth 
from where 40, 30, 20, and 10% of the total water extraction occur, 
respectively).
For every 100 mm applied as irrigation, 80 mm is absorbed by the root 
system and 20 mm is drained. Applying Eq. 24.5 to each of the four layers in 
which we have divided the profle, we may deduce the average ECFC for 
each layer.
In the frst layer, the water uptake is 40% of the total (0.4 × 80 mm), so the 
amount of water draining from this layer is the difference between the water 
applied (100  mm) and that absorbed, i.e., drainage is 100−32  =  68  mm. 
Therefore for the frst layer, LF and the calculated EC are:
LF0−1 = (100−0.4 · 80)/100 = 68/100 = 1.5/ECFC1; ECFC1 = 2.2
And for the other layers:
LF1−2 = (68−0.3 · 80)/68 = 44/68 = 2.2/ECFC2; ECFC2 = 3.4
LF2−3 = (44−0.2 · 80)/44 = 28/44 = 3.4/ECFC3; ECFC3 = 5.35
LF3–4 = (28−0.1 · 80)/28 = 20/28 = 5.35/ECFC4; ECFC4 = 7.5

It is possible to deduce analytically the profle of soil EC, so the mean value of 
EC may be computed as a function of EC of the irrigation water and the LF

If we use the weighted average, recommended for high-frequency irriga￾tion, we would predict a relative yield of 89% of the maximum. Using the

24.6 Required Leaching Fraction
The required LF (LFr) that is needed to keep a desired ECe (ECem) will depend on 
the crop sensitivity (Eq. 24.2) and the EC of irrigation water. Then the amount of 
irrigation to be applied will be:

24.7 Leaching for Maximum Crop Water Productivity
To maintain crop productivity, we may increase the LF and thus water applied. In 
other words, irrigation water of poor quality (high ECw) is equivalent to having a 
smaller amount of fresh water in terms of crop productivity.
In the previous section, we determined the required LF when the target yield was 
known. This may lead to unreasonably high values of LF when ECw and irrigation 
costs are high. In this case, we may be interested in maximizing the crop water pro￾ductivity (CWP, yield per unit irrigation applied). To do that we may apply Eq. 24.2
for different values of LF until a maximum CWP is found. In the case of low irriga￾tion frequency, it is also possible to deduce an analytical solution for optimum LF
by maximizing the function:
f LF LF B EC LF
LF ( ) = − ( ) − w e EC u

The two types of water could be blended to obtain a given ECem. For 
instance, if we want to obtain the maximum yield, then the average ECe should 
be 1.5 dS/m, which implies the following equation:
f EC f EC LF
LF well + − ( ) canal 
 

+ 1 = 1
5
1 5.
where f is the fraction of water taken from the well. In our case we may 
deduce f = 0.4, i.e., by mixing 60% of the water from the canal and 40% from 
the well, we could achieve maximum yield while increasing the irrigated 
area by 67%.
We could also change the LF. For instance, by increasing LF up to 0.3, we 
could use 63% of water from the well, thus increasing further the irrigated area.
Example 24.6 (continued)

As the inequality indicates, the solution is valid below the value of LF at which 
maximum yield is achieved.
24.8 Leaching Required for Maximum Profit
In the case of low irrigation frequency, it is possible to deduce an analytical solution 
for the depth of irrigation (Iopt) to maximize proft:

Example 24.7
We want to irrigate peach (ECeu  =  1.7, Bs  =  21) with irrigation water of 
ECw = 3 dS/m.
Using Eq. 24.1 we deduce LFopt = 0.32. The solution is valid as it is lower

If we had water with ECw  =  1  dS/m, a value of LFopt  =  0.18 would be

the optimum LF would be 0.13.

24.9 Nonsteady Salinity
The previous analyses are based on a steady-state salt concentration in the soil 
solution which would be achieved after continuous use of a given irrigation water. 
However, ECe may change during the season and from year to year. For instance, in 
Mediterranean areas, rainfall is concentrated in winter which would provide for salt 
leaching (at least partially, depending on the amount) and thus to ECe below the 
steady-state value. Therefore, the required leaching calculated according to the 
steady-state solution is an upper limit. The desired leaching would vary depending 
on the amount of winter leaching, and thus, on the actual ECe at the start of the 
irrigation season, which should be measured routinely to keep track of soil 
salinity trends.
Salinity buildup depends strongly on water EC and drainage dynamics. The frst 
may increase during the irrigation season. The second will depend on the spatial 
variability of irrigation applied and rainfall during the fallow period. Long-term 
variations in salinity may occur in association with prolonged droughts that may be 
alleviated by several rainy seasons.
After applying total irrigation of I in n events, the increase in salt content will be:
EC I EC I I I I w d − − ( ) req r > eq if (24.17a)
EC I I I w req if < (24.17b)

7.7 dS/m.

24.10 Sodicity and Soil Structure
Sodium-affected soils, referred to as sodic soils, are those with high levels of 
adsorbed (exchangeable) Na in soil. High exchangeable Na promotes the dispersion 
of soil colloids and consequently the degradation of soil structure. This degradation 
involves deterioration in aggregate stability, reduced infltration due to soil surface 
sealing, and increased risk of crust formation. Crusting limits crop emergence and 
increases runoff and, thus, erosion risk. Crusting is the consequence of the break￾down of aggregates and the closing of the pores in the soil surface resulting from 
rapid soil wetting accompanied by a dispersive effect of the impact of raindrops. In 
sodic soils, the problem is exacerbated because of the dispersing effect of sodium, 
which leads to a lack of aggregate stability.
A soil is classifed as sodic when the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) 
exceeds 15% of the cation exchange capacity. In practice, an indicator used is the 
sodium adsorption ratio (SAR; meq0.5/L0.5) in the soil saturation extract, which is 
approximately equal to ESP:
SAR Na
Ca Mg = +
2 (24.23)
where all the concentrations are expressed in meq/L.
ESP can be more precisely estimated from SAR in the saturation extract follow￾ing the empirical equation:
ESP
SAR
SAR = ( ) − + ⋅
− + ⋅
100 0 0126 0 01475
1 0 0126 0 01475
. .
. . (24.24)
SAR is an index applied to solutions, including irrigation water. It is also used to 
assess the effect of the sodium content of the irrigation water on soil structure and 
hydraulic conductivity due to an excess of sodium in relation to calcium and mag￾nesium. However, this negative effect depends on the EC of irrigation water as the 
dispersing effect of Na is counteracted by the aggregating effect of a high salt con￾centration in solution (Table 24.4). In addition, Ca concentration in the soil solution 
changes due to precipitation (as calcium carbonate) or dissolution during or after 
irrigation. Sodium remains soluble and in equilibrium with exchangeable soil Na at 
all times, whereas Ca concentration, however, varies until equilibrium. Dissolution 
is promoted by dilution and by carbon dioxide dissolved in the soil solution. 
Precipitation may take place when the presence of calcium is accompanied by 
enough carbonate, bicarbonate, or sulfate to exceed the solubility of calcium car￾bonate (limestone) or calcium sulfate (gypsum). This is why different corrections of 
the SAR value in irrigation water have to be considered for a more realistic estima￾tion of the potential effects of irrigation water on soil structure and hydraulic con￾ductivity. The most common method is estimating a corrected Ca concentration (Cax):

Abstract
This chapter describes the main features of fertilizers, which are the products 
used to supply nutrients to plants. Currently, these products not only contain 
nutrients but may also enhance the capacity of plants to absorb nutrients. 
Traditionally, most mineral fertilizer production was based on nonrenewable and 
sometimes strategic resources. This can constrain future agricultural sustainabil￾ity and food security. Thus, special attention is paid nowadays to fertilizer pro￾duction based on circular economy approaches. Most of the fertilizers used in 
agriculture are those for supplying primary macronutrients, i.e., N, P, and 
K. Nitrogen fertilizers are very soluble, and their selection and application should 
be intended to minimize losses. Phosphorus fertilizers are distinguished mainly 
by their solubility which determines how and when they can be used. Potassium 
fertilizers are highly soluble, but losses are not limiting since K is retained in 
soil. Defciencies of micronutrients are usually controlled with forms bound to 
organic compounds (complexes or chelates) which solves immobilization reac￾tions or limitations to be absorbed by plants under certain soil conditions.

25.1 Introduction
Fertilizers are inorganic or organic products that are used to provide nutrients to 
plants. Now, the term fertilizer is also used for other products such as microbial 
inoculants (sometimes referred to as biofertilizers) of physiologically active sub￾stances able to increase the capacity of plants to mobilize and absorb nutrients from 
soils (microbial and nonmicrobial biostimulants). In general, they have to comply 
with offcial regulations. For instance, the European Regulation 2019/1009 sets the 
rules that all EU must follow in their national directives to regulate properties, qual￾ity, and traffc of commercial fertilizers. In the USA, fertilizer regulations depend 
on the states, although some independent associations try to promote uniformity 
between states in their regulatory guidelines. According to the European regulation, 
different types of nutrients can be contained in fertilizers:
(a) Primary macronutrients: N, P, and K, which usually must be supplied in large 
amounts (tens or hundreds of kg per hectare).
(b) Secondary macronutrients: Calcium, magnesium, sodium, and sulfur, also 
required in high amounts but normally covered by the soil reserve. Sodium is 
not an “essential nutrient” from a physiological point of view but is required by 
some species such as C4 plants, and it is defned as a “benefcial nutrient.”
(c) Micronutrients: Boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc 
are required in small amounts compared with primary and secondary macronu￾trients; all are “essential nutrients” except cobalt (e.g., benefcial for legumes). 
The European regulation does not include nickel and chlorine, which are essen￾tial but seldom required as fertilizer.
The fertilizer strategy should be designed to achieve the maximum effciency in 
the use of nutrients by plants, i.e., most of the supplied nutrients should be taken up 
by the crop. This means that fertilizer should be applied in chemical forms and with 
soil conditions that enhance root absorption while minimizing losses by physical 
processes (e.g., leaching) or chemical reactions in soil. To this end, the 4R approach
has been proposed, which implies that fertilizers should be applied using the right 
source, at the right rate, at the right time, and at the right place.
Fertilizers can be applied before planting (basal or preplant) or after it (top dress￾ing or side-dressing). The application of fertilizer to the soil can be done manually, 
using machines (fertilizer spreaders) or dissolved in irrigation water (fertigation). 
Fertilizers can also be applied to vegetative organs (foliar spray), particularly when 
soil conditions are not favorable for nutrient absorption (e.g., very dry), or to achieve 
a fast response under defciency conditions. Fertilizer may be applied on the entire 
feld or just on part of it (localized, preferably close to plants, e.g., subsurface 
banded application), the latter being preferred for nutrients that can be fxed in the 
soil, such as P or K, particularly in poor-nutrient soils or soils with a high fxing 
capacity.

25.2 Fertilizers and Food Security
Increased global use of fertilizers has largely contributed to the increase in food 
production since the end of the nineteenth century. Figure 25.1 shows the evolution 
of fertilizer consumption and global wheat yield from 1961 to 2020. Around half of 
the crop yield may be attributed to fertilizer use (40–60% in the USA and UK), and 
this contribution is much higher in tropical regions. Table 25.1 shows the variation 
in inorganic or mineral fertilizer use for the different continents. In Africa, fertilizer 
rates are much lower than in other continents and this affects agricultural productiv￾ity with clear implications on food security. The ratio between nutrients can be quite 
different depending on continents, not necessarily refecting different crop require￾ments but sometimes the accessibility to specifc products. Contrasting with the 
period 2002–2011, there is an overall increasing trend in the use of fertilizers 
between 2011 and 2020 which likely refects the need for increasing agricultural 
production in the world.
The application of fertilizers marked a breaking point in agricultural productivity 
at the end of the nineteenth century with the appearance of inorganic fertilizers 
obtained from chemical processes and with a high concentration of soluble nutri￾ents. A relevant innovation was the synthesis of ammonia from atmospheric N2 (the 
Haber-Bosch process) at the beginning of the twentieth century which solved the 
limitation of N supply to crops that constrained agricultural production. These min￾eral industrial fertilizers are nowadays essential for guaranteeing agricultural sus￾tainability and food security. However, their production is based on nonrenewable 
resources. Nitrogen fertilizer production relies on high energy consumption (mostly 
from nonrenewable sources), being a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. 
P and K fertilizers are obtained from mining. The case of P fertilizer is particularly 
worrying since the production of the raw material (phosphate rock) is expected to 
peak in the middle of this century and the mines are concentrated in a few countries. 
The P limited supply and the increased demand will threaten global food security.

The so-called P crisis in 2008 was the result of reduced exports of phosphate rock 
from China, which caused the prices of P fertilizers to triple. The recent discovery 
of large reserves of phosphate rock in Norway does not signifcantly change the 
panorama since new industrial uses will increase the global P demand. Till now, 
85% of the phosphate rock was used in fertilizer production. European agriculture 
is dependent on P imports, so it has been included in the list of critical raw materials 
in the EU.
25.3 Toward More Sustainable Fertilizer Sources and Use
Apart from being nonrenewable resources, fertilizers are not used effciently in agri￾culture and other sectors. The average N fertilizer accumulated in the harvest of 
cereals is usually less than 40% of the amount applied. There are also relevant losses 
beyond the farm, so the global effciency of the N food chain (i.e., fraction of applied 
N incorporated in human bodies) is only around 10%. In the case of P, it is less than 
15% due to soil reactions. Most of P accumulates in grains, but only a small fraction 
is absorbed during digestion, so most P is excreted and found in wastewater. 
In Europe, waste P is equivalent to around half of the P fertilizer consumed, so P 
recycling should be improved. Struvite, obtained from water recycling, may be used 
as P fertilizer. These types of products are called bio-based fertilizers. The use 
of recycled materials as fertilizers or raw materials for fertilizer production is 
promoted in the European fertilizer regulation.
25.4 Classification
Fertilizers can be classifed according to different criteria:
(a) Depending on their nature: organic and inorganic (also referred to as mineral or 
chemical). Inorganic fertilizers are those in which nutrients are in the form of 
minerals obtained by extraction (mining) or by industrial processes. Organic 
fertilizers are those of animal or plant origin with a minimum declarable con￾tent of organic carbon according to legislation. Calcium cyanamide, urea and its 
condensation and association products, and fertilizers containing chelated or 
complexed micronutrients can be classifed as mineral fertilizers by convention. 
Chelated and complexed micronutrients refer to a product in which the micro￾nutrient is held by a complexation reaction with organic molecules; in the 
European regulation, depending on the type of organic molecule, the product is 
considered “chelate fertilizer” or “complex fertilizer.” They both, chelate and 
complex, should contain a minimum concentration of the micronutrient with a 
minimum proportion of water-soluble form. In organic farms, only those 
products from natural sources are allowed (e.g., farm organic residues or 
Chilean nitrate). Fertilizers can be also defned as organo-mineral when besides 
nutrients in mineral form they contain a minimum of declarable organic carbon 
according to legislation.
25 Fertilizers362
(b) According to their composition (legislation establishes minimum contents of 
nutrients):
• Straight fertilizers, which are those with a declarable content of only one 
macronutrient, or one primary macronutrient (N, P, or K) and one or more 
secondary macronutrients (such as Ca, Mg, or S).
• Compound fertilizers, which are fertilizers with a declarable content accord￾ing to the law of more than one primary macronutrient, or more than one 
secondary macronutrient; they are obtained chemically or by blending or by 
a combination of both processes. These fertilizers are classifed as binary 
when they have a declarable content of two primary nutrients, or ternary or 
complete when they have a declarable content of three primary nutrients. 
These fertilizers are sometimes called “complex.” However, this term is fre￾quently applied to compound fertilizers produced by combining ingredients 
to react chemically leading to a single chemical product with more than one 
macronutrient, e.g., diammonium phosphate which is a binary fertilizer that 
contains N and P.
(c) According to their physical presentation, which often determines the conditions 
of their use and their effectiveness, fertilizers can be classifed as:
• Solid fertilizers, with different types of presentation depending on their pro￾duction, solubility, and method of application:
– Powder or non-granular, when the product is presented as fne particles 
usually up to 3 mm diameter. Very few materials are sold now in this form 
as they present problems in handling (they tend to “cake”) and cannot be 
applied with spreaders. Powder is a usual presentation for sparingly solu￾ble products since low particle size enhances its solubilization.
– Crystallines, which are usually very soluble fertilizers for preparing ferti￾gation or foliar spray solutions. They are not suitable for application with 
mechanical spreaders.
– Granules, designed to improve the uniformity of mechanical distribution. 
More than 90% of the particles have to present diameters between 1 and 
4 mm. The spherical shape is desirable. The distinction between granular 
and prilled refers to the industrial production method.
– Pelletized or pelleted: They are granular fertilizers with very uniform sizes 
of spherical granules which improve the uniformity of distribution.
– Macrogranules: granules of 1–3  cm to produce a slower release of the 
nutrients.
• Fluid fertilizers, which can be fertilizers in suspension or solution or both; 
fertilizers presented only in suspension as dispersed particles are called 
“suspension fertilizers,” while solutions free of solid particles are “solution 
fertilizers.” Pressure solutions are those including anhydrous ammonia in a 
concentration greater than that that can be maintained in equilibrium with 
the atmosphere.
• Gaseous fertilizers, with only one fertilizer in this category, anhydrous 
ammonia, which must be injected into the soil.

25.5 Fertilizer Properties
25.5.1 Physical Properties
The physical properties of fertilizers are not regulated by law but are critical for 
correct handling, storage, conservation, and application. The following properties 
are the most relevant for solid fertilizers:
(a) Hardness, i.e., the resistance to be broken, which is important to prevent the 
breaking of granules during handling and to avoid powder formation due to 
abrasion.
(b) Fluidity which means a low risk of caking after storage.
(c) Particle size, which must be homogeneous to guarantee a correct application by 
mechanical spreading.
(d) Humidity must be low to avoid caking.
(e) Density, which is relevant for storage and segregation during the application of 
compound blended fertilizers with different densities; the distribution of a 
blend of several fertilizers could result in heterogeneous products if compounds 
with very different densities are blended.
25.5.2 Chemical Properties
Chemical properties determine the speed of action of the fertilizer and the side 
effects on crops and soil properties. The main chemical properties to be considered 
are the following:
(a) Solubility determines how fast nutrients enter the soil solution and are thus 
available for root absorption. It is measured in water for N and K fertilizers. For 
P, usually less soluble, besides water, ammonium citrate or citric acid has been 
used to characterize its solubility trying to mimic the effect of plant roots in soil 
(exudation of low molecular weight acids). Solubility in water is critical for 
fertilizers used in fertigation to avoid clogging of drippers. Solubility increases 
with increasing temperature and acidity. Some mixtures can promote precipita￾tion, like Ca fertilizers mixed with phosphates.
(b) Reaction of fertilizer in the soil, which may be acid or basic. It has been mea￾sured by the “acidity index” which is the equivalent amount of CaO that neu￾tralizes the effect of a fertilizer with acid reaction or promotes the same soil pH 
increase when the reaction is basic. The fertilizer reaction can be the result of 
(i) its chemical composition, e.g., anhydrous ammonia is a base, or base (e.g., 
Ca) which is the counterion in the nitric fertilizers; (ii) its reactions in soil, e.g., 
nitrifcation of ammonium in the soil produces acidity, or the decomposition of 
calcic cyanamide forms Ca(OH)2 which increases pH; or (iii) presence of impu￾rities such as sulfuric acid in ammonium sulfate.
25 Fertilizers364
(c) Salt index, which measures the effect of the fertilizer on the osmotic pressure; 
it is a relative value compared with sodium nitrate which receives an arbitrary 
value of 100.
(d) Hygroscopicity: It is the ability to absorb atmospheric moisture and is mea￾sured as the relative humidity value at which the fertilizer starts to absorb water. 
In many cases, hygroscopicity is proportional to the solubility of the fertilizer. 
Water absorption causes the dissolution of the particles, which melts the physi￾cal structure of the fertilizer and converts it to clumps instead of the initial 
granules which worsens the mechanical distribution.
25.5.3 Nutrient Concentration in Fertilizers
The nutrient concentration in a fertilizer is the amount of nutrients per unit weight 
of the product. After estimating the nutrient requirements of the crop, this informa￾tion is basic to calculate the amount of fertilizers to be applied. The concentration 
of nutrients in fertilizers is usually expressed in the following form, according to the 
legislation:
(a) Nitrogen, as elemental N.
(b) P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and S as oxides (K2O, P2O5, CaO, MgO, Na2O, and SO3) but 
elemental forms should be used instead. The use of oxides is an archaic custom 
of interest only to fertilizer companies, which is now being left behind. In some 
countries, both the concentrations in elemental and oxide forms appear on the 
label (e.g., UK) and in some, only the elemental basis is used (e.g., Australia).
(c) Other nutrients, such as micronutrients, in elemental form.
The concentration of primary nutrients of a compound or complex fertilizer or 
fertilizer grade is usually indicated by three numbers separated by hyphens that cor￾respond to the percentages of N, P2O5, and K2O.
Example 25.1
A ternary 15-15-15 fertilizer has concentrations of 15, 15, and 15% of N, 
P2O5, and K2O, respectively. If we express the concentrations in elemental 
form, we have:
N 15%
P 15% × 62 kg P/142 kg P2O5 = 6.5%
K 15% × 78 kg K/94 kg K2O = 12.45%
The factor of conversion is calculated as the ratio of the element mass to 
the molecule mass.
A. Delgado et al.365
The content of secondary nutrients or micronutrients in a compound fertilizer is 
expressed by another number with the percentage of the nutrient and indication of 
the nutrient. For example, if the ternary mentioned above has 2% MgO, this should 
be indicated in the following way: 15-15-15-2 MgO.
The usual nutrient concentrations of different fertilizers are presented in 
Table 25.2.

25.6 Straight N Fertilizers
25.6.1 Fertilizers with Nitrate
The nitrate fertilizers are very soluble in water, and the nitrate ion, an N form in 
which plants readily absorb this nutrient, is not fxed by soil particles when applied 
to the soil, so it remains in the soil solution. Therefore, N applied in this form is 
easily absorbed by plants but may be leached and lost from the soil. It can be con￾sidered a fast-action N fertilizer but should therefore be applied split and when the 
crop has a high demand for the nutrient to avoid losses (typically topdressing appli￾cations). These fertilizers show high hygroscopicity and a slightly basic reaction. 
Besides this reaction of nitrate fertilizers, nitrate can have an effect of increasing the 
pH of plant apoplast or rhizosphere as its absorption into cells is coupled with H+
which decreases the acidity of these media.
The main fertilizers in this group are calcium nitrate (16% N) and sodium nitrate 
(Chilean nitrate, obtained from mining) (15.5% N). This group also includes mag￾nesium nitrate (10.5% N), very soluble and used in fertigation, sometimes as solu￾tion fertilizer.
25.6.2 Fertilizers with Ammonium
Ammonium supplied with these fertilizers is a cation that is readily adsorbed by the 
soil exchange complex and is therefore not leached when percolation occurs. Thus, 
this type of fertilizer is recommended for preplant applications in winter crops when 
a high risk of leaching and low extraction by crops occurs at the beginning of the 
growing season. Although ammonium can be absorbed by plants, the progressive 
nitrifcation of ammonium (microbial transformation to nitrate) enhances its use by 
plants. At high rates, ammonium can be toxic to crops. At basic pH, there is an 
increased risk of losses to the atmosphere by volatilization (loss of gaseous NH3). 
This risk is increased if fertilizer is not mixed with the soil, thus making it less suit￾able for topdressing applications, and when soil is dry. In hydroponics, a portion of 
N should be applied in ammonium form (10–20%) to avoid pH rising in the solution 
due to nitrate absorption which can result in decreased availability of other nutrients 
such as Fe.
This group includes ammonium sulfate (21% N, 24% S), anhydrous ammonia 
(gas, 82% N), and pressured solutions of ammonia (41%) which have to be injected 
into the soil at 15–20 cm depth, with moderately wet conditions. Anhydrous ammo￾nia requires special machinery for its application and is diffcult to store and handle.
25.6.3 Fertilizers with Nitrate and Ammonium
These fertilizers combine the advantages of both forms of N, rapid availability of 
nitrate, and soil retention of ammonium that progressively transforms into nitrate. 
A. Delgado et al.367
They do not depend entirely on nitrifcation to provide nitrate, so they can be used 
in low-temperature periods when the nitrifcation rate is low. They are used primar￾ily in winter and in spring for topdressing.
This group includes ammonium nitrate (32% N) and ammonium nitrosulfate 
(26% N). One of the main concerns in the use of ammonium nitrate is its application 
for producing explosives like ANFO, which is used in mining and may be home￾made by mixing ammonium nitrate (AN) with fuel in the right proportions. It has 
been thus the choice for terrorists which has led to strict regulations in many coun￾tries regarding the purchase of AN or its commercial formulation. For instance, in 
Ireland and Northern Ireland, AN fertilizer is marketed as a mixture of ammonium 
nitrate and calcium carbonate. This mixture is one of the formulations called cal￾cium ammonium nitrate (CAN), which can be also obtained by mixing calcium 
nitrate and ammonium nitrate, with typical N contents ranging between 21% 
and 27%.
25.6.4 Urea and Related Products
Urea (46% N) and calcium cyanamide (around 20% N in commercial products) are 
included in this group. Urea has N in ureic form and cyanamide is transformed into 
urea in the soil. It has an acidic reaction, and it is very soluble and hygroscopic. 
Urea is a white crystalline solid that can be purchased as prills or as a granulated 
material. The importance of granules is increasing as they are larger, harder, and 
more resistant to moisture. Urea is rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonium through the 
activity of the urease enzyme, present in soils. This requires a certain temperature 
and humidity. Urea is highly soluble, so it may be leached before hydrolysis. 
Application to the soil surface may involve volatilization losses of ammonia formed 
during hydrolysis, so it is advisable to incorporate urea by tillage or irrigation. Urea 
is widely used both for basal applications and topdressing because of its low cost 
per unit of N applied. It can also be applied as solution that may also contain ammo￾nium nitrate. Its high solubility makes feasible its use in fertigation and foliar sprays, 
which are recommended in tree orchards when soil conditions are not appropriate 
for N absorption by roots (e.g., dry soil). The content of biuret (condensation prod￾uct) in urea fertilizers must be controlled since it is phytotoxic, particularly for 
foliar sprays with a maximum recommended content of 0.25%. To reduce ammonia 
losses, urease inhibitors can be added to urea. On the other hand, to reduce leaching 
risk, slow-release fertilizers based on urea coating have been developed. These are 
based on either reducing the solubility (larger granules, special coatings such as 
paraffn or sulfur) or adding nitrifcation inhibitors.
Calcium cyanamide reactions in soil release urea and calcium hydroxide, which 
explains its strong basic reaction. It is expensive, can be phytotoxic, and releases 
slowly available N; thus it is only recommended as basal fertilizer.
25 Fertilizers368
25.7 Straight P Fertilizers
Phosphate fertilizers are produced by physical (grounding, calcination) or chemical 
(acid attack) of phosphate rock. The most important feature of straight phosphate 
fertilizers is the reduced solubility in water of many of them. This low solubility in 
water does not necessarily imply that plants cannot use them as P sources. As men￾tioned above, organic acids exuded by roots, such as citrate, contribute to the mobi￾lization of P by solubilizing many of the precipitates of this nutrient in the soil. The 
sum of the water-soluble and citrate-soluble P in the fertilizer is considered to be the 
amount available to plants, and it is given on the fertilizer label. Usually, the citrate￾soluble component is less than the water-soluble component. According to solubil￾ity, three main groups of phosphate fertilizers can be distinguished:
(a) Mostly soluble in water, including single superphosphates (18–21% P2O5, 
8–9% P, 85% soluble in water), triple superphosphate (45% P2O5, 20% P, 85% 
soluble in water), phosphoric acid (54% P2O5, 24% P), and superphosphoric 
acid (76% P2O5, 33% P). The two acids are only used in fertigation (see 
Chapter 26).
(b) Mostly soluble in ammonium citrate, such as dicalcium phosphate (40% P2O5, 
17% P) and calcium metaphosphate (64% P2O5, 28% P).
(c) Insoluble, including calcined phosphate (18–28% P2O5, 8–12% P), basic slags 
(or Thomas slags, byproduct of iron and steel industry) (15% P2O5, 7% P), and 
ground phosphate rock (25–40% P2O5, 11–17% P, from mining without chemi￾cal treatment in the industry).
The more soluble fertilizers are to be incorporated in granular form and localized 
when possible to enhance their effciency, particularly in P-poor soils or in soils 
with a high P-fxing capacity. The less soluble forms are available as powder or fne 
granules which should be mixed with the soil to enhance its dissolution.
25.8 Straight K Fertilizers
Potassium fertilizers also come from mining resources, which are not as limited as 
phosphate rock. Although potassic fertilizers are very soluble in water, K ions are 
usually adsorbed to the soil exchange complex, which reduces the risk of losses. As 
with phosphate fertilizers, localization in bands is recommended in K-defcient soils 
with high cation exchange capacity to saturate it and maintain a high availability of 
K in the soil solution.
The two fertilizers with only K as a primary nutrient are potassium chloride 
(60% K2O, 50% K) and potassium sulfate (50% K2O, 41.5% K). The former is 
cheaper and more soluble but should be avoided under saline conditions to avoid the 
negative effects of chloride.
A. Delgado et al.369
25.9 Compound Fertilizers
This group includes binary and ternary fertilizers. Binary are usually complex 
forms, i.e., one chemical compound containing two macronutrients, and ternary are 
compound fertilizers obtained from blending, i.e., mixture of straight and complex 
fertilizers. Compound fertilizers facilitate the simultaneous application of several 
nutrients, avoiding self-made mixtures of fertilizer by farmers which can be less 
effective and adequate for a homogeneous distribution and can have problems of 
compatibility between blended products. The selection of compound fertilizers 
must be based on the relative proportion of N, P, and K needed by the crop and on 
the price per nutrient unit applied. Blending of fertilizers to produce compound 
fertilizers must consider basic rules of incompatibility: avoiding mixtures of P fer￾tilizer with products with Ca to avoid P precipitation and the mixtures of ammo￾nium fertilizers with basic reaction products to avoid volatilization of ammonia.
(a) Binary NP fertilizers include ammonium phosphates, mono- (MAP) or diam￾monium phosphate (DAP), ammonium polyphosphates, and nitrophosphates. 
DAP (18-46-0) is the most widely used P fertilizer in the world. It is highly 
soluble and promotes a basic reaction around the granule in the soil. MAP 
(10/12-48/60-0) is less soluble than DAP but its reaction is acidic, which makes 
it a better choice in fertigation. Ammonium polyphosphates (APP, 10/11-34/37-0) 
have part of the P as polyphosphates which must be hydrolyzed by the action of 
enzymes in the soil to pass to the available orthophosphate form which takes a 
few weeks with adequate temperature and water content. APP is frequently 
used in fuid fertilizers among other reasons by its acidic reaction. 
Nitrophosphates (20-20-0) have only a portion of water-soluble P and N in 
nitric and ammonium form. Ammonium phosphates are typical fertilizers used 
in basal applications, particularly if no K is necessary. The combination of 
ammonium and phosphate seems to enhance P uptake by plants compared with 
other P sources.
(b) Binary PK fertilizers are mixtures of phosphates and potassium chloride or 
potassium sulfate, or potassium phosphates and polyphosphates. Potassium 
phosphate (0-52-34) is soluble and has a slight acid reaction. It can be used in 
fertigation and foliar sprays. It is more expensive than other binary fertiliz￾ers with P.
(c) Binary NK fertilizers include blends of straight N and K products and only one 
complex fertilizer, potassium nitrate (13-0-44). This is a very soluble product 
recommended for fertigation and foliar sprays. It can be applied as topdressing 
if additional K (besides the preplant application) is required.
(d) Ternary NPK fertilizers are solid or liquid mixtures of straight and compound 
fertilizers with a wide range of grades and presentations. They are used for 
preplant broadcast applications. Although the amount of N applied as ternary 
products is modest, they can provide all the P and K required by crops. 
Depending on each particular product, the nutrients can be present in different 
chemical forms.

25.10 Fertilizers and Products with Secondary Nutrients
Although crops can take up large amounts of secondary nutrients, their application 
is not frequent because available pools in the soil can cover plant extractions. Its 
application usually follows a “suffciency” strategy, which means that nutrient is 
applied only if an increased yield can be expected from its application.
Calcium can be extracted in high amounts by crops, its concentration in leaves 
being sometimes higher than that of N (e.g., in citrus). The need to apply Ca as a 
fertilizer is rare; its defciency is typical in acidic soils with low base saturation of 
the exchange complex. Seldom, antagonistic problems with Mg make its applica￾tion advisable. Fertilizers with signifcant amounts of Ca are:
(a) N fertilizers: calcium ammonium nitrate (10–20% CaO, 7–14% Ca), calcium 
cyanamide (54% CaO, 39% Ca), and calcium nitrate (28% CaO, 20% Ca)
(b) Phosphate fertilizers: superphosphate (17–28% CaO, 12–20% Ca, mostly pres￾ent as gypsum), slags (45–50% CaO, 32–36% Ca), and dicalcium phosphate 
(32% CaO, 23% Ca)
Ca is usually added in the amendments used for the reclamation of sodic or acid 
soils, which implies a nutrient supply that can overcome Ca defciency in crops. 
Magnesium is required in lower amounts than Ca. Its defciency is frequently due to 
an antagonism with Ca, and sometimes with K when K fertilizers are applied in high 
amounts, particularly in K-rich soils. Its concentration is low in most fertilizers. 
When needed it may be added as dolomite (20% MgO, 12% Mg), magnesium oxide 
(90% MgO, 54% Mg), magnesium chelates (foliar application), and magnesium 
sulfate (16% MgO, 10% Mg). The latter can be applied by foliar sprays.
Sulfur extraction by crops can be as high as that of P, being particularly high in 
legumes (e.g., more than 45 kg/ha in alfalfa) and cruciferous crops. It is present in 
many fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate (24% S), ammonium nitrosulfate (12% 
S), and superphosphates (12% S in single superphosphate), which have been a tra￾ditional source of S for crops. However, the decreasing trend in the use of ammo￾nium sulfate, superphosphates, and elemental S as fungicide is leading to S 
defciencies. The need for adding S is not common, but if necessary it can be applied 
as sulfuric acid (30% S), elemental sulfur (30–99% S), potassium sulfate (17% S), 
and urea-sulfur (19% S).
25.11 Fertilizers and Products with Micronutrients
Micronutrients are usually applied following a “suffciency strategy,” which means 
that their application is done if a defciency is expected. Frequently, micronutrient 
defciency is the consequence of soil conditions promoting a failure in the mobiliza￾tion, absorption, or transport mechanisms of plants, not the result of a lack of nutri￾ents in the soil. The paradigmatic case is iron defciency chlorosis, related to alkaline 
and calcareous conditions, not to the lack of iron in soil. The most common

For correction of Fe defciency chlorosis in calcareous soils, most of Fe present in EDDHA-Fe 
should be orto-orto. All products are soluble in water except those marked with * (insoluble) or ** 
(slightly soluble)
fertilizers in the market do not contain signifcant amounts of trace elements except 
Chilean nitrate and slags. Micronutrients are not usually added to other fertilizers 
because of the risk of toxicity. The defciencies, when detected, are treated with 
specifc products (Table 25.3).
Iron defciency is called “iron defciency chlorosis” and is related typically to 
calcareous soil and sensitive plants. The application of inorganic Fe salts (sulfates 
and carbonates) to the soil is usually not effective due to the rapid oxidation of Fe in 
the soil which results in the precipitation of insoluble Fe(III) oxides. These products 
are more effective by foliar sprays or injections to the trunk. The only inorganic salt 
effective in overcoming the problem (for several years) is vivianite (ferrous phos￾phate). Siderite (Fe carbonate) with colloidal size can also be effective. The easiest 
to use and most effective products are Fe-chelates, although they have the con￾straints of high price and low residual effect (three to four applications per growing 
season are usually needed). Fe-chelates are Fe complexed by organic compounds 
(usually synthetic amino carboxylic acids) which provide a supply of Fe that is 
maintained available in the soil and also have a positive effect on the Fe transport 
mechanism through plasma membranes. Accurate selection of Fe-chelate is neces￾sary depending on soil conditions, e.g., chelates applied to calcareous soils may be 
stable in conditions of high Ca concentration and pH in the soil solution. In calcare￾ous soils, the most used Fe-chelate is FeEDDHA. Fe-chelates can be applied directly 
to the soil or by fertigation; care should be taken with foliar sprays since the chelates 
are not always photostable. Other types of Fe complexes can be obtained using 
25 Fertilizers372
natural organic matter or organic byproducts of the paper industry (lignosulfonates) 
as complexing compounds. According to legislation, fertilizer labels should indi￾cate the complexing agent and the content of micronutrients. In the case of 
Fe-chelates, the content of isomers is mandatory since the effciency varies depend￾ing on the isomer. In the case of FeEDDHA, the Fe(o,o-EDDHA) is the most effec￾tive in overcoming Fe defciency chlorosis.
Zinc defciency, in addition to Fe chlorosis, is the micronutrient defciency con￾tributing most to decreased agricultural yields in calcareous soils. This defciency is 
particularly relevant in cereals, which decreases not only yields but also grain qual￾ity for human consumption (low Zn concentration). Manganese and copper def￾ciencies can also occur, more frequently in calcareous soils where their solubility is 
low. Unlike Fe, there are no commercial specifc complexing agents for Zn, Mn, and 
Cu, EDTA and DTPA being the most usual. The low specifcity makes these che￾lates unstable, in particular in calcareous soils. For controlling Zn, and Mn defcien￾cies, sulfates have been the most usual products, although other inorganic forms 
(nitrates, chlorides, oxides) can be applied. Inorganic fertilizers can be combined 
with chelates for controlling the defciency of these micronutrients. As for Fe, lig￾nosulfonates and natural complexing agents can be used for producing complexes 
of these micronutrients.
The defciency of molybdenum is usual in strongly acid soils, where its solubility 
is signifcantly decreased. If needed it is applied as inorganic salts such as ammo￾nium or sodium molybdate. Amendments to increase soil pH in acidic soils can 
contribute to an increased availability of this nutrient.
The defciency of boron occurs often in the most demanding crops (alfalfa, beet, 
caulifower, sunfower, olive). High pH can promote B defciency in low organic 
matter sandy soils. The main products are sodium tetraborate (borax, 11% B), boric 
acid (17% B), and sodium octaborate (Solubor®, 20% B) in foliar or soil applica￾tion. Boron bound to ethanolamine or triethanolamine can be also used.
25.12 Slow-Release Fertilizers
Slow-release fertilizers were produced frst for N to reduce nitrate leaching, particu￾larly in sandy soils. Later, slow-release products have been developed for other 
nutrients, including P and K. Today, a new line of products, whose solubilization is 
enhanced under rhizosphere conditions (e.g., increased organic acid concentration), 
is being developed.
Slow N-release fertilizers can be classifed into different categories:
(a) Natural organic sources such as manures, which contain part of the N in organic 
form which must be mineralized to be used by plants (see Sect. 25.11).
(b) Products derived from urea that must be hydrolyzed frst to release urea. 
The hydrolysis rate depends on temperature, humidity, and microbial activity. 
The main products are urea-formaldehyde reaction products (UF, up to 38% N 
A. Delgado et al.373
and maximum decomposition at pH 6.1–6.5), isobutylene diurea (IBDU, 31% 
N, maximum decomposition at pH 4), crotonylidene diurea (CDU, 31% N, 
maximum decomposition at basic pH), and triazone (cyclic compounds with 
ammonium).
(c) Urease inhibitors slow down the production of ammonium from urea, which 
reduces volatilization. The most common products are N-(n-butyl) thiophos￾phoric triamide (NBPT) and N-(n-propyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NPPT).
(d) Products with a slow release of N achieved by physical coating of urea prills. 
Coatings are usually composed of sulfur, wax, or resins, which form a semiper￾meable membrane that allows a slow dissolution of covered fertilizers. Some 
commercial products have different contents of primary and secondary 
nutrients and micronutrients covered in plastic polymers with pores that allow 
a slow release.
(e) N fertilizers based on urea or ammonium mixed with nitrifcation inhibitors 
whose effect lasts several weeks and may reduce N2O and NO emissions associ￾ated with nitrifcation and denitrifcation. The most common products are 
dicyandiamide (DCD), 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), and 
pronitradine.
25.13 Organic Fertilizers
Organic fertilizers are products containing organic C of biological origin which 
contain enough plant nutrients to be useful as fertilizer. They are obtained from 
animal or plant material transformed (e.g., composting) or not. The organic fertil￾izer may also serve as a soil improver (organic amendment) when signifcant 
amounts of C are added to the soil (Chap. 30). Organic fertilizers include residues 
from the meat industry, manure and other farm residues, compost from different 
origins, byproducts of agroindustry, and guano.
The minimum content of carbon and nutrients is regulated by law for the trading 
of organic fertilizers. For example, in the EU, solid organic fertilizers must contain 
at least 15% organic carbon, and the minimum content in primary macronutrients 
can vary between 1% and 2.5% depending on the nutrient and the combination of 
nutrients declared. Nutrients in the organic fertilizer, such as N, P, and S, can be at 
least partly in organic form. An organo mineral fertilizer is a co-formulation of one 
or several inorganic fertilizers and one or more materials containing organic C and 
nutrients. Particular attention is usually paid in the legislation to pollutants such as 
heavy metals and pathogen microorganisms.
In-farm organic byproducts and wastes can be used as fertilizers and/or soil 
amendments but are out of trading regulations. They may have a relevant role in 
recycling nutrients at the farm scale, decreasing the need for external inputs and 
improving nutrient balances. These products include animal wastes (slurries, dung, 
manure, and poultry litter) and plant materials (crop and pruning residues and 
green manure).
25 Fertilizers374
Manure has relevance as fertilizer and in the recycling of nutrients. As an exam￾ple, the amount of P applied in Europe and part of the USA as manure is higher than 
that applied as mineral fertilizer. The direct application of farm residues or the direct 
deposition of slurries/manure in the feld by the animals has several drawbacks:
– High water content and low nutrient concentration which increases the applica￾tion cost per unit of nutrient applied when compared with mineral fertilizers 
(with high nutrient concentration).
– Uneven distribution.
– High losses of N by volatilization of ammonia, particularly if they are not incor￾porated. These products should be injected or incorporated into the soil just after 
spreading.
– Bad smells and potential chemical and microbial contamination of surface waters 
if the product is washed away after heavy rainfall.
– Addition of weed seeds, pathogenic microorganisms, and insect larvae (e.g., fies).
– Fermentation in the feld of fresh organic residues can reduce seed germination 
and seedling growth due to the production of phytotoxic compounds or to 
decreased oxygen partial pressure around the seedlings.
– Some residues with a high C/N ratio, such as fresh manure or cereal straw, can 
promote an initial N immobilization which may decrease temporarily plant N 
availability (Chap. 26).
Many of these problems are greatly reduced if the residues are previously com￾posted, i.e., subjected to aerobic decomposition with temperatures between 40 and 
65 °C. Composting implies an increase in the density and a reduction in the C/N 
ratio. For instance, for cow manure C/N goes from more than 50 to less than 20. 
Residues or composts should be applied well before planting (2–3 months for fresh 
manures or crop residues) and incorporated into the soil. Basic reaction products 
such as lime should be avoided then, as ammonia volatilization would increase. It 
should be noted here that only plant residues generate stable soil organic matter 
(humus) (Chap. 30).
The main overall limitations in the use of organic fertilizers are the following:
– Organic fertilizers have low nutrient concentrations, thus forcing the application 
of high rates or the addition of mineral fertilizers. For example, the application 
of 20  t/ha of cow manure may provide only 60  kg  N/ha, 30  kg P/ha, and 
80 kg K/ha.
– Nutrient concentration in organic fertilizers is highly variable depending on the 
nature and processing of the product. In the case of manures, the composition is 
affected by animal species (Table 25.4), age, proportion of litter bed, diet, and 
composting time. Thus, it is diffcult to know the amounts of nutrients applied 
with organic fertilizer unless each batch applied is analyzed.

Usually, the ranges in N, P, and K concentrations in manure are 3–8, 0.7–1.3, and 
3–6 kg/t, respectively. In poultry litter, N and P concentrations are twice that in 
other animal wastes.
– Part of the nutrients in these products are in organic form, particularly N and 
P. Thus, their release is not immediate, since it requires the mineralization of 
organic matter, which may take several years to be completed. It is assumed that 
N in manures is released in 3–5 years; in slurries, a greater portion of N is readily 
available in the frst season after application (60–70%). This slow release of 
nutrients reduces N leaching but may limit nutrient availability. On the other 
hand, the application of P in organic forms or with an organic matrix is more 
effcient in increasing the P soil available pool than mineral fertilizers.
– The nutrient equilibrium in organic fertilizers rarely matches the equilibrium 
required by crops. For instance, cereals usually have an N/P/K requirement 
around 8:1:5 (if the straw is exported out of the farm), so meeting the crop N 
requirement with cow manure (average 3.5:1:3) implies an excess application of 
P. This is another reason for complementing organic with mineral fertilizers.
In organic or ecological farming systems, only natural (mostly organic) fertiliz￾ers are allowed. This often leads to reduced yields due to the limited supply of 
nutrients, although this may be compensated by the higher prices of organic crops.

Abstract
Nitrogen is usually the most limiting nutrient for plants in agroecosystems. The 
natural input of N in agricultural soils comes from the atmosphere by N fxation 
which implies the transformation of gaseous N2 in NH4
+. Fixation is mainly a 
biological process, and the most relevant organisms involved are Rhizobium bac￾teria that infect the roots of legumes. Organic N becomes inorganic through min￾eralization, and then inorganic N is absorbed by plants. Soil microorganisms 
may capture temporarily inorganic N when residue with high C/N ratio decom￾poses (immobilization). Ammonium in the soil is converted to NO3
− through 
nitrifcation, a microbial process greatly reduced in waterlogged soils. In the 
latter, denitrifcation generates gaseous N forms that are lost. Nitrate leaching is 
proportional to deep percolation and to nitrate concentration in the soil solution. 
A Leaching Index may be calculated as a function of rainfall and soil type to 
quantify the risk of leaching.

26.1 Introduction
The N source for terrestrial plants is the N2 gas which constitutes 78% of the atmo￾sphere. As plants cannot convert N2 to organic molecules, it has to be transformed 
frst following one of the following paths:
1. Fixation by microorganisms living in symbiosis with the roots of legumes.
2. Fixation by free-living soil microorganisms.
3. Fixation as oxides by electrical discharges in the atmosphere.
4. Fixation as NH3 and further transformation to NO3
−, urea, or other fertilizers by 
manufacturers.
The contribution of atmospheric N2 is in dynamic equilibrium with the forms 
fxed in the soil. While various processes fx N2, other chemical and microbiological 
processes release N2 to the atmosphere (Fig. 26.1). Except for industrial fxation or 
combustion, all other processes are natural but can be altered by soil and crop 
management.
Understanding the N cycle in the soil-crop system is the key to optimizing nitro￾gen fertilizer management, maximizing proftability, and minimizing negative envi￾ronmental impacts on water (nitrate pollution) and the atmosphere (emission of 
greenhouse gases and NH3). The main sources of N for crops are inorganic and 
organic N fertilizers and symbiotic N2 fxation.
Although N2 in the atmosphere can be considered an infnite source of N for 
fertilizer production, this industrial process requires huge amounts of energy. Thus, 
N for industrial production of mineral fertilizers cannot be considered a renewable 
N2 atmosphere

resource since it depends on nonrenewable energy.  Efforts to use  renewable 
energies to produce ‘green ammonia’ and decarbonize the fertilizer industry are 
currently on going.
26.2 N Forms in the Soil
The soil N concentration ranges from 0.02% (subsoil) to 2.5% (peat) with a typical 
range 0.03–0.4%. This N can be inorganic or organic, with the latter being 
predominant.
Organic N appears as proteins, amino acids, amino sugars, and other N com￾pounds. Inorganic forms include ammonium (NH4
+), nitrite (NO2
−), nitrate (NO3
−), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and N2. The frst three are important for soil 
fertility and derive from fertilizers or organic matter mineralization. The other three 
are gases lost in denitrifcation.
26.3 N Forms Absorbed by Plants
Plants absorb NH4
+ and NO3
− although having both often improves plant nutrition. 
The nitrate concentration is generally higher than that of ammonium and is in the 
soil solution, so it reaches the roots with the water fow (mass transport fow). Plant 
preference for one or the other form of inorganic N depends on the species, plant 
age, environmental conditions, and other factors. For instance, cereals and beets 
absorb either NO3
− or NH4
+. The Solanaceae (potato, tobacco, tomato) beneft from 
a high NO3
−/NH4
+ ratio in the soil solution. Species adapted to acid soils are used to 
low NO3
−/NH4
+ ratio, as NH4
+ tends to accumulate due to nitrifcation slowing down.
In terms of energy, NO3
− uptake is less effcient than that of NH4
+, as the nitrate 
has to be reduced to ammonium before the N becomes part of the organic com￾pounds. However, NH4
+ absorption leads to acidifcation of the rhizosphere and 
decreases the absorption of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+, while it increases the absorption of 
H2PO4
−, SO4
2−, and Cl−. On the other hand, NO3
− uptake is co-transported with H+
contributing to rhizosphere and apoplast alkalinization. This effect can decrease Fe 
uptake. Small amounts of organic N are absorbed by plants mainly as amino acids, 
but the contribution to the plant N nutrition is meagre.
26.4 Symbiotic N Fixation
Symbiotic N fxation involves the reduction of atmospheric N2 to NH3 by an enzyme 
(nitrogenase) in aerobic microorganisms (mainly Rhizobium bacteria) that form 
nodules on the legume roots. This mechanism has been the principal source of N for 
agriculture until the appearance of cheap synthetic N fertilizers.
The Rhizobium-legume symbiosis is specifc, i.e., each Rhizobium species will 
only infect a type of legume. Therefore, it is often necessary to inoculate the seeds 
with the adequate species or strain of Rhizobium.
26 Nitrogen Fertilization I: The Nitrogen Balance380
The mere presence of nodules on the roots does not imply fxation activity. For 
example, in alfalfa, active nodules are large (2–4 × 4–8 mm) and grouped in the 
primary roots. The red color inside the nodules denotes the presence of leghemoglo￾bin, an N and O carrier required for the activity of the Rhizobium.
The factors that affect the rate of N fxation by Rhizobium are pH, the concentra￾tion of nutrients in the soil, photosynthesis, climate, and overall crop management. 
Soil acidity restricts the presence and activity of Rhizobium, although the different 
species differ in sensitivity. For example, pH below 6 reduces nodulation of 
Rhizobium meliloti in alfalfa, while pH between 5 and 7 hardly affects R. trifoli
in clover.
An excess of NO3
− in the soil reduces nitrogenase activity and thus N fxation. 
The maximum fxation occurs when with little inorganic N in the soil. However, 
small doses of N fertilizer may ensure good seedling establishment of legumes, 
while the Rhizobium nodulation is accomplished. Applications of N may be also 
necessary at the beginning of the spring, when the demand for N by the plant 
exceeds the supply by Rhizobium due, for example, to low temperatures. In some 
legumes (i.e., beans in certain soils), fxation is so poor that it is necessary to apply 
N fertilizer systematically.
In general, high photosynthetic activity is required for high N fxation, so water 
stress, low temperature, or any other stress reducing photosynthesis will also 
decrease N2 symbiotic fxation.
26.5 Quantifying N Fixation
Perennial crops fx between 110 and 225 kg/ha/year, although the values may be 
above or below that range depending on environmental conditions. Annual legumes 
fx between 50 and 110 kg/ha/year.
As a frst approximation, the amount of N fxed by a legume crop can be esti￾mated as:
N f Y NC HI
HI fixed = + ( ) NR h r + NC FNBF
 −

 

 1 1 (26.1)
where fNR is the ratio of N in roots and N in shoots, Y is yield, NCh and NCr are the 
N concentrations in the harvested product and the residues, respectively, HI is har￾vest index, and FNBF is the fraction of N resulting from biological fxation. The value 
of fNR lies between 0.05 and 0.25. FNBF depends on the availability of soil N, which 
in turn is related to fertilizer application rate and the type of legume. When soil N 
availability is low, most crop N comes from fxation (Table 26.2). If the soil organic 
matter content is high, the lower values of the proposed intervals should be used. On 
the other hand, the N concentrations in the harvested product and the residues may 
be measured or taken from Table 26.1.

Most values in the literature fall in the range defned by maximum (N max) and minimum (N min) 
concentrations, shown when available. Also, the dry matter content (% over fresh mass) is indicated
Example 26.1
The expected yield of an alfalfa crop is 8 t/ha (15% moisture) on a soil with 
1% organic matter. Initial soil inorganic N is 40 kg/ha and expected N miner￾alization during the growing season is 35 kg N/ha. We assume that HI is 0.9 
and that residues have the same N concentration as the harvested part.
In Table 26.1 we fnd that the N concentration of alfalfa is 3.3 kg N/100 kg 
dry matter. As water content is 15%, harvested dry matter biomass is 6800 kg 
dry matter/ha.
Available N in the soil will be the sum of initial inorganic N (40 kg/ha) and 
expected mineralized N (35 kg/ha):
40 kg N/ha + 35 kg N/ha = 75 kg N/ha.

26 Nitrogen Fertilization I: The Nitrogen Balance382
So we are in the 55–110 kg/ha interval of Table 26.2, implying that 60–90% 
of N comes from fxation. As soil organic matter content is low (1%), we use 
the upper limit (0.90). We also take fNR  =  0.2, which means that the total

26.6 Transformations of N in the Soil
26.6.1 Mineralization and Immobilization
Dead plant materials (senesced leaves, residues left after harvest) decompose, 
i.e., the structure breaks into unrecognizable organic matter (Chap. 30). This is per￾formed by bacteria and fungi that get energy from the respiration of the residue’s 
C.  The decomposition rate increases with temperature up to 32–35  °C and with 
water content up to feld capacity, so residues decompose faster when buried into 
the soil. In general, decomposition rate is proportional to N concentration in the 
residue, which explains why legume residues decompose faster than those of 
cereals.
N mineralization is the conversion of organic N to NH4
+. After the decomposition 
of plant residues, N mineralization occurs in two stages, aminization (breaking 
up of proteins to amino acids, amines, and urea, with release of CO2) and ammoni￾zation (conversion of amines and amino acids to NH4
+). This transformation is 
performed by heterotrophic microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) and is based on 
aerobic and, to a lesser extent, anaerobic respiration.

Mineralization is favored by high soil water content, without reaching saturation 
to ensure oxygen supply (Fig. 26.2). The decomposition does occur in waterlogged 
conditions but at a lower rate. The temperature coeffcient, Q10, for mineralization is 
2 in the range of 5–35 °C, i.e., the mineralization rate is doubled by raising the tem￾perature to 10 °C. The optimum temperature is around 35 °C (Fig. 26.3).
Immobilization is the conversion of inorganic N (NH4
+ and NO3
−) to organic N 
being basically the reverse of mineralization. If decaying organic matter contains 
little N relative to C, the microorganisms use (immobilize) soil mineral 
N. Microorganisms require a C/N ratio of about 8:1, therefore the soil inorganic N 
may decrease rapidly during waste decomposition, and the crop may experience 
N defciency. When the residue with low N content is fnally decomposed, C avail￾ability as an energy source for microbes is decreased, so their activity stops.
The predominant process (mineralization or immobilization) depends on the C/N 
ratio of decomposing organic matter. At the start of the decomposition of organic 
residues, there is a rapidly growing population of heterotrophic microorganisms 
which is detected in the increased release of CO2. If the C/N is greater than 30, 
immobilization occurs. As decomposition proceeds, the C source decreases, and so 
does the C/N ratio, until the microorganisms begin to die. Finally, a new equilibrium 
is reached that starts with the mineralization of N and ends with a higher inorganic 
26 Nitrogen Fertilization I: The Nitrogen Balance384
N level and C/N ratio of around 10. The time required depends on the amount of 
added organic residue, the availability of inorganic N, the resistance of the residue 
to be decomposed (i.e., its lignin content), and the temperature and soil water 
content.
The C/N in the surface layer of natural soils is between 8 and 12, with 10 being 
the most common value. These soils have a relatively stable microorganism popula￾tion and deposition of organic residues (and thus mineralization) is also constant. If 
this soil is tilled, decomposition and mineralization will speed up, which will 
decrease the soil organic matter.
Example 26.2
After the harvest of a cereal, we incorporate 3000 kg/ha of straw with 45% C 
and 0.75% N (C/N = 60) to the soil. The total amounts of C and N are:
3000 kg/ha × 0.45 = 1350 kg C/ha
3000 kg/ha × 0.0075 = 22.5 kg N/ha.
We assume that 35% of C will be used in the growth of microorganisms 
while 65% of C is lost as respired CO2. The amount of C accumulated in the 
microbial biomass will be:
1350 kg C/ha × 0.35 = 472.5 kg C/ha
The C/N ratio of the microorganisms is 8, so N accumulated will be:
472.5 kg/ha / 8 = 59 kg N/ha
And the amount of immobilized N is:
59 kg N/ha − 22.5 kg N/ha =36.5 kg N/ha
Example 26.3
A soil has 2% organic matter in its surface layer (0.20 m) and a bulk density 
of 1.3 t/m3. This organic matter has C/N = 10 and N concentration of 5%. 
Therefore the total amount of organic N in this layer is:
1.3 103 kg soil/m3 soil × 0.20 m x 104 m2/ha × 0.02 kg O.M./kg soil × 
0.05 kg N/kg O.M. = 2600 kg organic N/ha
If mineralization rate is 1%/year, the amount of inorganic N released 
will be:
2600 kg organic N/ha × 0.01 kg N/kg organic N/year = 26 kg N/ha/year.
M. Quemada et al.385
26.6.2 Nitrification
The NH4
+ transformation to NO3
−, called nitrifcation, is performed by bacteria 
(Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter) in two stages:
NH4
+ + O2 > NO2
− + H2O + H+ (Nitrosomonas).
NO2
− + O2 > NO3
− (Nitrobacter).
Both Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter are autotrophic bacteria, although some het￾erotrophic organisms are also involved in both processes. The second stage is faster 
than the frst, which prevents the accumulation of NO2
−, which is toxic to plants.
The main factor affecting the nitrifcation rate is the substrate concentration 
(NH4
+) that depends on fertilization and mineralization. The need for oxygen implies 
that a good aeration is required (optimum O2 concentration is 20%), so waterlogging 
is undesirable. However, nitrifcation is high with relatively high water content and 
is maximized when 80–90% of the soil pores are full of water. The optimum condi￾tions for nitrifcation are temperature between 25 and 35 °C and neutral to slightly 
alkaline soil pH, but it can occur in the range of 4.5–10 (Fig. 26.4). Therefore, lime 
application to acid soils will increase nitrifcation and mineralization and improve 
N supply to crops.
The product of nitrifcation (NO3
−) is very soluble in water and is hardly adsorbed 
by soil colloids, so it may be lost by leaching.
Nitrogen fertilizer management has to take into account the facts stated above. 
In regions with low soil temperatures and/or low winter rainfall, NH4
+ applications 
in the fall, before planting, save time and money with little risk of nitrate leaching. 
If air temperatures are below 4–5  °C or mean soil temperature is below 10  °C, 
the preplant applications of ammonium in the autumn are effcient since 
nitrifcation rates are low. If soil temperature is above 10 ºC, care should be taken 
to avoid  soil NO3- accumulation and losses if the nitrate is not up  taken by a 
vegetative cover.

26 Nitrogen Fertilization I: The Nitrogen Balance386
Nitrosomonas activity is very sensitive to many compounds, so the fertilizer 
industry has developed nitrifcation inhibitors that are blended into the fertilizer 
granules or added to manures and slurries. The inhibitors slow down the nitrifcation 
process, controlling nitrate accumulation in the soil and thus nitrate losses.
26.6.3 Denitrification
Denitrifcation is not the opposite of nitrifcation but the reduction of nitrate into 
volatile N compounds. When soil oxygen availability is reduced because of high 
water content, soil compaction, or the application of easily decomposable organic 
matter, the rate of denitrifcation increases. Anaerobic micro-zones containing still 
a source of labile C appear, and a broad number of microorganisms (mainly bacteria 
such as Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Paracoccus but also some fungi) are able to use 
NO3
− and NO2
− as electron acceptors for oxidizing organic C releasing gaseous N 
forms to the atmosphere:
NO3 2 NO N O2 2 NO N − − > > > >
The incomplete reduction promotes the emission of N2O, a very reactive green￾house gas that also favors ozone destruction. The reaction is fast and is shown 
by peaks of N2O emission after application of organic or synthetic fertilizers. 
Denitrifcation was thought to occur only under waterlogging, but more recent 
research has shown that it’s the main N loss to the atmosphere under a broad range 
of environmental conditions.
Soil water content is one of the main factors affecting denitrifcation. Waterlogging 
prevents the O2 diffusion and thus enhances denitrifcation (Table 26.3). Because of 
that, the highest denitrifcation N losses from agriculture have being reported in 
rice paddy felds, with losses of up to 16 kg N/ha in the day after soil saturation.

A strategy to control losses in paddy felds is the application of urea or ammonium￾based fertilizers. The N will remain in the soil as NH4
+ and only small amounts will 
be transformed to NO3
− close to the roots where oxygen is available. Therefore, 
denitrifcation will be limited by lack of substrate. In well-aerated soils, however, 
nitrifcation rate is high and denitrifcation will only occur in anaerobic micro-zones 
of the soil (e.g., cattle dung). The combination of inorganic N fertilizers with manure 
application may also promote denitrifcation. Recently, a leak on the frst stage of 
the nitrifcation has been identifed as a source of N2O (between 0.03 and 1% of the 
oxidized N is lost to the atmosphere), adding uncertainty to gaseous emissions in 
well-aerated soil. Quantifcation of denitrifcation is complicated as it is hard to tell 
apart from the atmospheric N2. Table 26.3 shows the effect of organic matter on 
denitrifcation rate for different soil types.
Many of the bacteria responsible for denitrifcation are very sensitive to acidity 
(Fig. 26.4). Thus, in soils with pH below 5, denitrifcation is negligible, while it can 
be high in basic soils. However, in soils with pH > 7, most of the N oxides are

reduced to N2, whereas in acid soils most of the N loss occurs as N2O. Moreover, the 
denitrifcation is very sensitive to temperature and increases rapidly as soil tempera￾ture goes from 2 °C to 60 °C, above which it is inhibited.

The ammonium ion in solution is in equilibrium with ammonia (NH3), which is 
volatile. Ammonia volatilization occurs naturally in soils but at a slow rate. However, 
volatilization losses of N fertilizer can be very important, depending on the type 
of fertilizer, application form, the cation exchange capacity, soil pH, and climatic 
factors (Table 26.4). The set of conditions with higher ammonia losses would be 
the surface application of urea on a soil with basic pH and low CEC under dry 
conditions. Volatilization risk can also be high with surface application of manures 
since a relevant fraction of N can be ammonium. To reduce ammonia volatilization, 
incorporation of ammonium fertilizers/urea/manure is recommended by tillage or 
irrigation within 2 days of fertilization.
The general ranges of volatilization loss of ammonia fertilizer are 2–50% 
(pH  >  7) and 0–25% (pH  <  7). The NH3/NH4
+ equilibrium is pH dependent. 
In acidic and neutral conditions, the equilibrium is shifted to NH4
+ which explains 
the lower losses.
26.7 Crop N Uptake
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for crops. It is a constituent of proteins, nucleic 
acids, chlorophyll, and other intermediate metabolites. If the N supply is limited, 
crop growth is reduced and so is intercepted radiation. A more severe N defciency 
leads to lower radiation-use effciency. Therefore, N availability will limit biomass 
accumulation and yield. There is an optimum N concentration range, above which 
excess N can decrease yield. For instance, in indeterminate crops, high N concentra￾tion promotes vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth which results 
in a lower harvest index. At a global level, N is the second limiting factor (after 
water) in crop production.
Nitrogen uptake is parallel to biomass accumulation, so it shows a typical 
sigmoid curve with an initial exponential increase followed by a fast linear accumu￾lation phase. In this rapid phase, accumulation may be up to 3–5 kg N/ha/day. The 
concentrations of N in the different organs are high when the plants are young and 
decrease with age. Therefore, the crop response to N depends not only on the 
amount absorbed but also on the translocation capacity to the growing organs 
(and fnally to the grain or harvestable part).
In most crops, N concentration decreases with increasing aboveground biomass, 
and the decline is described by a negative power function called the nitrogen dilu￾tion curve (Fig. 26.5). The critical nitrogen dilution curve has been developed for

many species (NCcrit = a B−b
) based on datasets of N concentration and biomass (B) 
under different fertilization regimes. The critical N concentration of a crop (NCcrit) 
is defned as the minimum crop N concentration (%) allowing maximum biomass 
production. The coeffcient a is crop N concentration when biomass equals 1 t/ha, 
and b is a dimensionless parameter governing the slope of the relationship. The 
critical nitrogen dilution curve can be used to determine the crop N status: if crop N 
concentration is close to the NCcrit corresponding to the current biomass, it indicates 
that N is not limiting crop growth, while when it is below, it indicates a N defciency. 
The ratio between the actual crop N concentration and the NCcrit for a given biomass 
is known as the N nutrition index (NNI):
NNI

where B is crop biomass (t/ha). In general, C4 species have a lower NCcrit for a given 
biomass than C3 species, presumably related to a lower content of photosynthetic 
proteins. The dilution curves are generally accepted because of their simplicity for 
modeling crop growth during vegetative stages; however, when other factors differ￾ent from N limit growth (i.e., drought, disease), the curve may depart greatly from 
the model, and so the adoption of crop biomass as the independent variable may be 
misleading. The actual N concentration for a given species depends primarily on 
the distribution of dry matter among leaves, stems, and reproductive structures.

Fig. 26.6 Response of YIELD
sunfower yield to N 
applied and N uptake
When crops start, they are mainly composed of young leaves, which have a high N 
content. Later on, the fraction of stems and other structures increases, and leaves 
may lose part of their N which explains that the ratio of crop N and biomass will 
tend to decrease with time. Other techniques based on crop N status have been 
developed for fertilizer recommendation and will be discussed in Chap. 27.
The relationship between yield and N uptake is generally linear until the maxi￾mum yield is reached. From that point, if there is N available in the soil, absorption 
continues, but it does not result in a higher yield. This limit depends on environmen￾tal conditions and crop management. Figure  26.6 shows a linear relationship 
between yield and N uptake for an experiment conducted with sunfower crops in 
Córdoba with different levels of irrigation and N fertilizer. The maximum yields, 
where the yield-N uptake relation saturates, increased with irrigation levels. 
Therefore, despite the linear relationship between yield and N uptake when no other 
factor is limiting, it is important to set the objective yield to defne the maximum 
level of N uptake.
For a set of environmental conditions, the relationship between yield and applied 
N is curvilinear (Fig. 26.6). Therefore, the agronomic effciency of the N fertilizer, 
i.e., the yield per unit of applied N, decreases with increasing the dose. When this 
dose reaches a certain value, an increase in fertilizer does not result in a yield 
increase, and in some cases, it may even be detrimental for crop growth or quality. 
Furthermore, the amount of residual soil N will be greater, which increases the risk 
of nitrate leaching.
M. Quemada et al.391
The yield response to N applied depends on the initial availability of soil N and 
the mineralization potential during the season, besides the production potential of 
the crop. Thus, in very fertile soils, the crop may not respond to the application of 
N or the response may be negative. If another factor (i.e., water) is limiting, the high 
N input will not bring yield increases. Figure 26.6 illustrates this behavior in the 
sunfower experiment mentioned earlier. As the irrigation amount was higher, so 
were yields for any dose of N. The response to applied N was also higher under 
irrigation, at least for low N doses.
As a framework for understanding the responses to fertilization, de Wit pro￾posed to represent in different quadrants the curves of N uptake and yield in 
response to the N application (Fig. 26.6). In the frst quadrant yield is plotted as a 
function of N applied for different irrigation regimes of the sunfower experiment. 
This yield corresponds to an amount of N absorbed (second upper quadrant), which 
in turn corresponds to a rate of N application (second lower quadrant). Each line of 
the lower quadrant is characterized by its slope and its intercept. We see that both 
the intercept and the slope of the N uptake-N applied curve increased with applied 
irrigation. This means that irrigation increased N availability because either NO3
−
was applied in irrigation water, the mineralization rate was enhanced by irrigation, 
or N uptake was facilitated in a wetter soil. Furthermore, as the level of irrigation 
increased, the curves of N uptake did not show saturation, i.e., a ceiling of N 
absorption was not reached. Water and N are the main limiting factors in many 
irrigated systems, so a combined management should be followed for successful 
crop performance.
In any case, the criterion for choosing the dose of N fertilizer should be economi￾cal, i.e., the optimal dose will be that leading to maximum proft. This dose will be 
lower than that required for maximum yield and may be calculated as the point 
where the marginal proft of fertilization practice is zero.
The results of the sunfower experiment mentioned above contrast with other 
previous experiments on sunfower fertilization in Córdoba, which did not show a 
response to N fertilization. In the experiment mentioned, the soil had been “cleaned” 
of mineral N with a previous unfertilized cereal crop. Initial fertility conditions and 
other environmental factors (i.e., water supply) greatly affect crop responses to N 
application. This is why production functions of yield versus N applied cannot be 
extrapolated to other situations. To emphasize this concept, results from a rainfed 
experiment conducted in three adjacent felds in Navarra (Spain) showing the 
response of wheat to increasing rates of N fertilizer application are presented in 
Fig. 26.7. No yield response was observed when high initial inorganic N (>140 kg N/
ha) was present in the soil (top 0.9  m) before planting, whereas yield response 
increased for the medium (90 kg N/ha) and low (30 kg N/ha) inorganic N felds. 
Because of that, the determination of available N in soil samples taken before plant￾ing or before side-dress applications is a recommended practice to avoid overfertil￾ization in many regions.

26.8 Nitrate Leaching
The consequences of N losses from agricultural systems to water bodies are a major 
social concern in developed countries, with special attention to aquifer contamina￾tion by nitrate and excessive N availability in lakes and estuaries. Potential harmful 
effects of nitrate on human health (cyanosis, risk of cancer) have led to the estab￾lishment of maximum allowable concentrations of nitrate in drinking water of 50 g 
NO3
− m−3
 (World Health Organization). The EU and the USA have identifed 
regions affected by excessive nitrate contamination and passed legislation to pre￾vent it (i.e., the EU Nitrate Directive which is part of the EU Water Framework 
Directive (2000/60/EC); USA Congress, 1978). As the main contributor to nitrate 
pollution is agriculture, restrictions to the use of N fertilizers and agricultural 
practices that may enhance nitrate leaching have been implemented in many 
countries.
Nitrate leaching occurs as soil water containing dissolved nitrate drains below 
the root zone. Therefore leaching will be proportional to deep percolation and to 
nitrate concentration in the soil solution. Deep percolation will depend on the com￾ponents of the water balance (rain and irrigation), the water retention of the soil, and 
its hydraulic conductivity. Soils with high water retention capacity and low conduc￾tivity (e.g., fne-textured) will have therefore a lower percolation and leaching 
potential. Apart from soil characteristics and climatic conditions, fallow periods 
M. Quemada et al.393
between successive crops in the rotation are the most dangerous for leaching. Nitrate 
left in the soil at harvest plus that originated from mineralization and nitrifcation 
during the fallow period remains available for leaching during drainage episodes 
after heavy rains. The absence of a crop extracting water and nitrate is ideal for 
keeping a high risk of leaching (high water content, high nitrate concentration). This 
has led to the introduction of “catch” crops to fll the gap of fallow periods as they 
reduce water content and absorb inorganic N which is thus fxed in organic form and 
can be incorporated again into soil with crop residues. Other possible measures for 
reducing leaching would be earlier plantings (to reduce fallow periods), reducing 
basal N applications in the autumn, or using slow-release fertilizers (Chap. 25). In 
irrigated systems, it is extremely important to follow irrigation schedules based on 
the water balance with corrections at the end of the season to deplete soil water as 
much as possible.
To evaluate the risk of leaching, we may use the Leaching Index (LI; mm). It is 
an estimate of the percolation below a soil depth of 1 m and was proposed by the 
USDA (Williams & Kissel, 1991). The LI is calculated as the product of a Percolation 
Index (PI) and a Seasonal Index (SI):
LI = ⋅ PI SI (26.3)
The Percolation Index is calculated as:
PI

. . (26.4)
where P is annual rainfall (mm) and CN’ is a modifed curve number with values 28, 
21, 17, and 15 for hydrologic groups A, B, C, and D, respectively (Chap. 8). If the 
condition stated in Eq. 26.4 is not met, PI = 0.
The Seasonal Index represents the concentration of rainfall during the win￾ter period:

(26.5)
where Pw is total rainfall (mm) during autumn and winter (1 October–31 March in 
N latitudes, 1 April–30 September in S latitudes).
The Leaching Index is only indicative of potential losses by leaching but not of 
actual losses. If the LI is high, adequate crop and soil management may lead to low 
actual leaching. On the contrary, with low LI we may expect low actual leaching 
independently of actual management. In other words, measures to reduce the 
concentration of nitrate will be more effective in reducing leaching in  locations 
with high LI.
26 Nitrogen Fertilization I: The Nitrogen Balance394
Example 26.4
Let’s calculate the LI for two locations, Adelaide (Australia) and Dublin 
(Ireland), for a soil of hydrologic class A (CN’ = 28) using the monthly rain￾fall shown below:
Month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Year
Adelaide, Australia 19 20 22 38 57 50 67 51 40 37 23 24 448
Dublin, Ireland 69 50 54 51 55 56 50 71 66 70 64 76 732
Applying Eq.  26.4 to Adelaide (P  =  448  mm, Pw  =  303), we obtain 
PI = 41.5 mm and SI = 1.1 (Eq. 26.5), so LI = 45.9 mm.
For Dublin (P = 732 mm, Pw = 383 mm), the PI = 197 mm and SI = 1.02, 
so LI  =  200  mm. The risk of leaching is much higher in Dublin than in 
Adelaide.
We will now illustrate how we can convert LI values to approximate leach￾ing values. Let’s assume that the soil has water contents at feld capacity and 
saturation, θFC = 0.25 m3
m−3
 and θSAT = 0.45 m3
m−3
. We also assume that dur￾ing percolation the soil water content is the average of those values, i.e., 
0.35 m3
m−3
. We can compare situations of low and high nitrate content at the 
start of the winter period (e.g., 25 versus 100 kg N/ha in 1 m depth) by assum￾ing that all percolation occurs during winter. The N leached can be calcu￾lated as:
N N LI
Z leached init
mean



 

 







1 exp θ (26.6)
where Ninit is the initial soil N content (kg N/ha), Z is soil depth (mm), and 
θmean is the average water content during percolation (0.35 m3
m−3
 in this soil). 
Applying this equation we deduce that leaching could be between 3 and 
12 kg N/ha in Adelaide and between 11 and 44 kg N/ha in Dublin. In the latter, 
the reduction in leaching by reducing soil N would be 33 kg N/ha, while in the 
former the reduction would only be 9 kg N/ha.

26.9 Soil Acidification Induced by N Fertilization
Nitrogen fertilizers can contribute to soil acidifcation directly due to the ions added 
to the soil and indirectly via atmospheric deposition. At a global scale, the increase 
in N fertilizer use in the last century has produced a signifcant acceleration of soil 
acidifcation. This issue is particularly relevant in soils with pH < 7 in which increas￾ing acidity may impair plant growth and soil health, resulting in a rise of limestone 
requirements to neutralize the effect.
Ammonium-based fertilizers, such as urea or ammonium sulfate, are oxidized 
in the soil forming nitrate (nitrifcation) and releasing H+ that lowers the soil 
pH. Similarly, organic fertilizers such as manures or slurries can reduce soil pH by 
oxidation of the ammonium added or by the acids released during the decomposi￾tion of the organic compounds. The increased H+ concentration resulting from 
ammonium oxidation is balanced by the crop uptake of NO3
− which is coupled to 
that of H+. Net acidifcation occurs when nitrate is not absorbed by crops but lost 
through leaching. Therefore, in soils with acidity risk, it is better to use both ammo￾nium and nitrate and monitor soil pH, applying limestone if required. When N fer￾tilization is well adjusted to crop requirements, H+ released during nitrifcation is 
offset by root H+ absorption; therefore, soil acidifcation is only relevant when N 
fertilizers are applied in excess leading to a high concentration of nitrate in soil 
which is not absorbed or when it is leached.
Atmospheric deposition of NH3 and NO3
− can also enhance soil acidifcation. 
Even if the major contributor to acid rain is SO2, the NH3 volatilized from fertilizers 
and manures can be a signifcant source. Part of the N gasses emitted from 
denitrifcation, such as NO2 and NO, are oxidized in the atmosphere to NO3
−. 
Further, these N compounds can return to the soil by means of dry or wet 
deposition, contributing indirectly to soil acidifcation.

Abstract
The N balance allows the calculation of the fertilizer requirement that depends 
on crop N absorption, inorganic N in the soil at sowing or produced by mineral￾ization, and N losses. A fertilization plan should consider the variability of envi￾ronmental factors, especially rain, to distribute the N with fexibility to match the 
specifc conditions of each year. Doing so, we will avoid yield reductions due to 
N defciency and the negative environmental impact of excess application. 
Fertilization of trees should be based on the nutrient balance (mature trees) or the 
growth rate expected from actual transpiration.

27.1 Calculation of N Fertilizer Doses Using the Nmin Method
The crop response to N fertilization depends on the amount of soil inorganic N 
available before fertilization. Thus, N fertilizer needs are lower when soil available 
N is abundant. The Nmin method is based on sampling soil mineral N at the end of 
winter, so N rates will decrease as soil N increases. A set of feld trials with similar 
environment (soil + climate) and crop management, including different levels of 
mineral N in the soil, are needed to establish this relationship. The model ftted is:
N A f f = − B Nf min (27.1)
where Nf is the optimum economic dose of N, the parameter Af represents the total 
N fertilizer requirement, and Bf is the amount of N provided by the soil per unit N 
in the sampled soil depth.
Sometimes, the method is simplifed by only determining soil nitrate since most 
of inorganic N is in that form at the end of the winter, although ammonium may be 
relevant after cold winters or in acid soils. Another common simplifcation that can 
result in serious errors is taking soil samples only in the top 30 cm layer, which is 
clearly insuffcient to represent the actual root depth of most crops (Chap. 20). 
Modifcations of the method are used in Europe (Nmin method) and in the USA, 
where it is known as “preplant nitrate test” (PPNT).
Some additional factors have to be considered:
• Winter crops: The method is applied at the end of winter, before topdressing 
application. If crop growth during winter is slow, basal N fertilizer application is 
not recommended to avoid nitrate losses by leaching or denitrifcation. In warm 
areas where crop growth and N uptake are important before topdressing, a small 
fraction of fertilizer (15–30%) might be applied before planting.
• Spring crops: The method is applied before planting, and the fertilizer is split in 
a preplanting application and topdressings during the growth cycle, as performed 
for sugar beet in Northern Europe or for maize in Southern Europe.
• The method is strictly empirical, thus only valid for environmental and manage￾ment conditions for which it was developed. Changes in management, such as 
adding manure or incorporation of crop residues, will require adapting the model 
coeffcients.
27.2 Calculation of N Fertilizer Dose Using the N Balance
The estimation based on a nutrient mass balance is the recommended strategy for 
mobile nutrients, such as N, which are not retained in soils and can be lost through 
leaching or gaseous emissions. The mass balance approach is directed to preplant 
estimates of N needs. The increase in soil inorganic N (i.e., the difference between 
M. Quemada et al.405
fnal (Nend) and initial (Ni) soil inorganic N content) for a nonleguminous crop cycle 
may be written as:
N N end i − = N N f m + + N N irr d + + ep N N seeds c − − N N l d − − Nv (27.2)
where Nf, Nm, Nirr, Ndep, and Nseeds are N inputs as fertilizer applied, N mineralized, N 
in irrigation water, N in atmospheric deposition, and N in seeds, respectively. The 
outputs are N absorbed by the crop, N lost by leaching, N lost by denitrifcation, and 
N lost by ammonia volatilization. The N balance equation can be simplifed to:
N N end i − = N N f m + + N N other b − + ( ) iom r N N oot − loss (27.3)
where Nloss includes all losses of N, and Nother includes other minor inputs (irrigation, 
deposition, seeds) and N fxation in the case of legumes. The equation now sepa￾rates the two components of crop N, that accumulated in aboveground biomass 
(Nbiom) and that accumulated in roots (Nroot).
27.2.1 Crop N Uptake (Nc)
Crop N content of the aboveground biomass (Nbiom, kg N/ha) is calculated as a func￾tion of expected aerial biomass production (yield and residues) and N concentration 
of biomass components:
N Y NC B Y NC Y NC HI
HI biom = + yield r ( ) − es = + yield r NC es
 −

 

 · 1 (27.4)
where Y is dry matter yield (kg/ha), B is aerial biomass (kg/ha), HI is harvest index, 
and NCy and NCr are N concentrations in the harvested organ and the residues, 
respectively. To calculate total N accumulated by the crop (Nc), we add the N in 
roots as follows:
N N f N N f c b = + iom N ( ) R y = + ( ) ield res N ( ) + R 1 1 (27.5)
where fNR is the ratio of N in roots and shoots and Nyield and Nres are the amounts of 
N in yield and residues, respectively.
If biomass is overestimated, the same will happen with N applied and N losses 
will be enhanced. On the other hand, underestimation of biomass will lead to insuf￾fcient N and thus, N will become the limiting yield factor. Usually, N in roots 
accounts for 5–25% of N in aboveground biomass, so 15–20% can be considered 
acceptable for feld crops and up to 25% for horticultural crops.
The estimated yield (also called target yield) should be based on previous years’ 
yields with inputs similar to those the farmer intends to use. If the crop is new in the 
farm, the target yield should be estimated based on data from neighboring farms. 
Additionally, for N it is always useful to set the maximum and minimum expected 
yields to establish maximum and minimum values of Nc and so decide the most 
appropriate strategy, which we will discuss later.
27 Nitrogen Fertilization II: Fertilizer Requirements406
The crop N concentration can be determined a posteriori by analyzing the bio￾mass produced. However, to design the fertilization program, it is necessary to have 
estimates of N concentration a priori. Table 26.1 lists the N concentrations for dif￾ferent crop species and dry matter content data required to convert commercial to 
dry matter yields. When we plan to apply less N than needed or when other factors 
are not limiting (rainy year or under irrigation), we must choose the lower values of 
the ranges given in Table 26.1.
27.2.2 Initial and Final Soil N and Mineralization
The initial soil inorganic N content can vary greatly and values between 30 and 
500 kg N/ha in the upper 1 m soil have been reported. It is the result of the N fertil￾izer not absorbed by the previous crop and other processes during the fallow period 
(mineralization, atmospheric deposition). The common strategy in fertilization 
management will seek to deplete soil N during the crop cycle, i.e., try to make soil 
inorganic N at the end of the cycle (Nend) as low as possible. The Nend is also called 
the residual N, and below a threshold value (between 10 and 70 kg N/ha depending 
on soil texture and depth), it cannot be recovered by the crop.
Mineralization of soil organic N may be an important source of N. The N miner￾alized during the crop campaign is the net result of the mineralization of the stable 
soil organic matter (SOM) and the residues and roots from the previous crops. This 
contribution is hard to estimate, and many alternative methods have been proposed. 
Some practices accelerate SOM mineralization, like the conversion of prairies into 
cultivated land or the transformation of rainfed to irrigated farms. If a reduction in 
SOM is expected, we should counteract it with organic or green amendments. We 
will assume that the SOM is in steady state and calculate mineralization as a func￾tion of N in the residues and roots of the previous crop as follows:
N k m m = + F N res res N k root = + m r F Nes res Nf N R y ( ) ield + Nres
′ ′ ′ ′ ′ (27.6)
where Fres is the fraction of residues that are left in the feld and N′yield and N′res refer 
to N accumulated in the harvest and residues of the previous crop, respectively. The 
coeffcient km has a maximum value of 1, if all the aboveground residues are miner￾alized with no loss. Lower values are expected if the residues are not incorporated 
by tillage or when the residue N concentration is low. We propose km  =  0.9 for 
legumes with tillage, 0.7 for legumes left on the ground and for nonlegumes with 
tillage, and 0.5 for nonlegumes left on the ground. This assumes that Nm decreases 
when residues remain on the ground (i.e., under reduced or no-till) since mineraliza￾tion slows down and the risk of losses (volatilization, wind, and runoff) increases. 
Note that N in roots is assumed to be fully available to the next crop.

27.2.3 Fertilizer Requirement Calculation According 
to the N Balance
From Eqs. 27.3 and 27.6, N fertilizer requirements may be calculated as:
N
N N f N N k F N f N N
f
end i NR yield res m res res NR yield
= ( ) − + + ( )( ) + − − + ′ ′ 1 res o N ther
n
′ ( ) −
( ) 1− (27.7)
Nother is the total N received by atmospheric deposition (5–10 kg N/ha, as a con￾servative value), irrigation water, and N in seeds. The coeffcient n is the fraction of 
applied N lost (leaching, volatilization, denitrifcation) and fNR is the ratio N in 
roots/N in shoots. Ni can be determined with a soil analysis just before sowing at the 
expected rooting depth. If we do not measure Ni, we may assume it is nil to avoid 
underestimating N requirements. In some regions, Ni values based on experience are 
provided depending on the precedent crop, soil type, and fall-winter rainfall.
The approach described here has been implemented in software packages like 
FertiliCalc, which is available for personal computers (Windows version, https:/
www.uco.es/ftotecnia/fertilicalc.html) or smartphones (Android and iOS versions, 
www.fertilicalc.com).
To evaluate the cropping system performance regarding N, we use the nitrogen 
use effciency (NUE), the ratio of exported N and total N inputs. Higher effciency 
means a better use of the resource, with more of the applied N taken up by the crop 
and a reduction in N losses. Besides agronomic criteria, we may have to consider 
other constraints. For instance, the dose and types of N fertilizer have been restricted 
by law in many countries to prevent nitrate pollution.
Box 27.1: N Fertilizer Efciency
There are several ways to calculate the effciency of fertilization. The most 
used, which we may call Ef, is the fraction of applied N that is fnally accumu￾lated in the aerial part of the crop and is equal to the slope of the relationship 
between N uptake and N applied (Chap. 26, Fig. 26.6). However, this defni￾tion does not take into account N in roots. Usual values of Ef are typically in 
the range 0.4–0.75, and values between 0.5 and 0.7 are usually acceptable. A 
second defnition of effciency (EfR) would include roots, so it would be the 
fraction of total N applied that is accumulated in the crop shoots and roots. In 
mathematical terms:
 E E f n fR = + f N ( ) 1 1 R = − (27.8)
With fNR = 0.2, this equation implies that the normal range of EfR is 0.5 to 0.9.
27 Nitrogen Fertilization II: Fertilizer Requirements408
The N balance method is used to calculate the N supply for a target yield, which 
depends on environmental conditions and management. However, the recommended 
N dose should optimize the proft and may differ from the estimated requirements, 
depending on fertilizer and harvest prices.
Example 27.1
Wheat crop is grown as monoculture in a Mediterranean environment (sown 
in January and harvested in July) on an acid soil with the following distribu￾tion of yields:
2–3 t/ha in 40% of the years
3–4 t/ha in 30% of the years
4–5 t/ha in 20% of the years
5–6 t/ha in 10% of the years
The average yield is therefore 3.5 t/ha.
We assume that all the residues of the previous crop are left in the feld 
(FRES = 1) and are incorporated by tillage, so km = 0.7.
The N concentration in wheat is 2.3% in grain and 0.6% in straw. The har￾vest index is 0.5. The water content of grains is 10%. We assume fNR = 0.2, 
Nother = 10 kg N/ha (5 kg N/ha atmospheric deposition + 5 kg N/ha in seeds). 
Our aim is 1−n = 0.80 (losses of denitrifcation and volatilization are low in 
acid soils) and Nend = 25 kg N/ha, which can be assumed as a reasonable value 
for rainfed cereal-based crop rotations with effcient N use.
How would we modify the N fertilizer strategies if the soil mineral N con￾tent (Ni) is determined in soil samples every year? Assume that the average 
value is Ni = 40 kg N/ha.
How would we modify the cereal N fertilizer strategy if faba bean (dry 
yield 1500 kg/ha, HI = 0.3) is introduced as a precedente cash crop?
(a) For each interval of yield (taking the midpoint), we calculate the N 
fertilizer requirement. For instance, for yield 2.5 t/ha:
Nc (N uptake):
Yield (dry matter) = 2500 (1–0.1) = 2250 kg/ha
Residues = Y ∙ (1−HI)/HI = 2250 kg/ha
Nyield = Y ∙ NCy = 2250 ∙ 0.023 = 51.75 kg N/ha
Nres = 2250 ∙ 0.006 = 13.5 kg N/ha
We assume that the previous wheat crop had an average yield (3500 kg/ha):
Yield (dry matter)= 3500 (1–0.1) = 3150 kg/ha
Residues = Y ∙ (1-HI)/HI = 3150 kg/ha
N′yield = Y′∙NCy = 3150 ∙ 0.023 = 72.4 kg N/ha
N′res = 3150 ∙ 0.006 = 18.9 kg N/ha

For other yield values, we will have:

For Y = 4.5 t/ha: Nf = 155.6 kg N/ha
For Y = 5.5 t/ha: Nf = 194.7 kg N/ha
(b) Possible strategies:
– Apply 77 kg N/ha every year. The crop would always be limited by 
N, and we would have an average yield of 2500 kg/ha, so the aver￾age exported N would be 2250 × 0.023=51.75 kg N/ha. The NUE
(N exported/N input (Nf + Nothers)) would be 0.59.
– Apply 116 kg N/ha every year. In the best case, yield would be 
3500 kg/ha. The average yield is then:
0 4. . ⋅ + 2500 0 6⋅ = 3500 3100kg ha /
So the average exported N would be 64.17 kg N/ha and the NUE = 0.51.
– Apply 156 kg N/ha every year. The average yield is then:
0 4. . ⋅ + 2500 0 3⋅ + 3500 0 3. / ⋅ = 4500 3400kg ha
So the average exported N would be 70.4 kg N/ha and the NUE = 0.42.
– Apply 195 kg N/ha every year. The average yield is then:
0 4.... ⋅ + 2500 0 3⋅ + 3500 0 2⋅ + 4500 0 1⋅ = 5500 3500kg ha /
The average exported N would be 72.4 kg N/ha and the NUE = 0.35.
The best strategy would depend on the price of the grain and the cost of 
fertilizer. In any case it is always better to follow a fexible strategy, i.e., basal 
application lower than 77 kg N/ha and then applying a topdressing 2 months 
later (to ensure N availability by tillering). The latter would be omitted if the 
year came bad and would be between 0 and 118 kg N/ha depending on the 
actual conditions of the year. In years with high yield expectation, the top￾dressing could be split in two (the second around fowering) to ensure high 
grain protein content. By following a fexible strategy, if we can exactly match 
the N requirements of each type of year, we would apply an average 
amount of N:
0 4. . ⋅ + 77 0 3⋅ +⋅ + 116 0 2. . 156 0 1⋅ = 195 116 kg N h/ a
while the average exported N is 3500 · (1–0.1) · 0.023 = 72.45 kg N/ha and the 
NUE = 0.58.

(c) If Ni = 40 kg N/ha, the new calculation for the lowest expected yield

For the other yield values, we will have:
For Y = 3.5 t/ha: Nf = 66.4 kg N/ha
For Y = 4.5 t/ha: Nf = 105.6 kg N/ha
For Y = 5.5 t/ha: Nf = 144.7 kg N/ha
Possible strategies:
– Apply 27 kg N/ha every year. The average expected yield would be 
2500 kg/ha and the average exported N 51.75 kg N/ha.
– Apply 66 kg N/ha every year. The average expected yield would be 
3100 kg/ha and the average exported N 71.34 kg N/ha.
– Apply 106 kg N/ha every year. The average yield is then 3400 kg/
ha and the average exported N 78.2 kg N/ha.
– Apply 145 kg N/ha every year. The average yield is then 3500 kg/
ha and the average exported N 80.5 kg N/ha.
In the fexible strategy, we would apply a basal application of 27 kg N/ha 
and then a topdressing 2 months later between 0 and 118 kg N/ha depending 
on the actual conditions of the year. In years with high yield expectation, the 
topdressing could be split in two to ensure high grain protein content. By fol￾lowing a fexible strategy, we can better match the N requirements of each 
type of year. We would apply an average amount of N:
04 27 ⋅ + 0 3. . ⋅ + 66 02 10 ⋅ + . . 6 0 1 145 66 ⋅ = N h/kg a
The average exported N is 72.4 kg N/ha; therefore, NUE>1. This is a case 
of soil mining, a common practice when fertilizer prices are high or in areas 
with nitrate pollution problems. Care should be taken as soil mining is not 
sustainable in a long term as soil C and quality could be degraded.
(d) After faba bean, the available N at wheat sowing will increase. We 
calculate N in yield and residues of the faba bean:
N′yield = Y NCy = 1500 ∙ 0.037 = 55.5 kg N/ha
N′res = Y ∙ (1−HI)/HI ∙ NCr = 1500 ∙ 0.7/0.3 ∙ 0.016 = 56 kg N/ha

27.3 Within-Season Methods for Improved N Management
The spatial and temporal variability of processes affecting soil N represents a rele￾vant limitation to the N balance, which provides a preplant estimation of N needs 
for the whole crop cycle. Within-season monitoring tools and methods have been 
proposed to improve the estimated N requirements. They are based on monitoring 
the N status of the soil or the crop during the season, assessing the need for addi￾tional N, or recommending specifc dose of supplemental N.
A good example is the pre-sidedress nitrate test (PSNT), performed for maize in 
the USA. It is a type of Nmin method based on a soil nitrate analysis (30 cm depth) 
when plants are 20–30 cm tall. It represents a point-in-time assessment of the spring 
accumulation of NO3
− before the crop begins the rapid growth phase. The PSNT
method takes into account the remaining N from the previous crops, N mineraliza￾tion, and N losses before the date of sampling, just before large amounts of N are 
required by the crop.
Box 27.2: Estimating Final N (Nend)
Soil N at harvest (Nend) is variable and depends on fertilizer dose, climatic and 
soil conditions that affect crop growth, and, thus, N uptake. In general, Nend is 
higher after a dry year due to reduced N uptake and low leaching. In wet 
years, N leaching and denitrifcation favor low Nend. At the same time, the risk 
of leaching are higher in sandy than in clay soils. With effcient management, 
Nend ranges between 10 and 70 kg N/ha, which may account for 10–20% of N 
fertilizer applied to most crops. Higher values may be expected with high 
fertilizer dose in clay soils or conditions not prone to leaching (e.g., effciently 
irrigated spring crops). A common recommendation in Mediterranean envi￾ronments is assuming Nend = 25 kg N/ha for crops receiving low N fertilizer 
dose (e.g., rainfed cereals) and 40 kg N/ha for crops receiving high N fertilizer 
dose (e.g., irrigated feld and horticultural crops).
which is a relevant reduction in fertilizer application. The amount of N to 
apply for the other yield classes will be 79, 118, and 157 kg N/ha. Therefore, 
the basal N application to wheat could be skipped and the topdressing between 
40 and 157 kg N/ha would be applied 2 months after sowing. In years with 
high yield potential, the topdressing could be split in two to ensure high grain 
protein content.
The N fertilizer savings provided by the introduction of faba bean would 
be added to other agronomic advantages of crop rotation. The faba bean 
income will probably be lower than that of the cereal, but the introduction of 
the legume every 2 or 3 years may increase the sustainability of the crop￾ping system.

27 Nitrogen Fertilization II: Fertilizer Requirements412
In addition to the methods based on soil available N, there has been a major 
development in sensors to determine crop N status to adjust fertilizer application 
during the growing season. The sensors are based on the radiation transmittance of 
a leaf or the refectance of the crop canopy at various wavelengths and can be hand￾held or tractor mounted. The readings are related with chlorophyll activity and 
therefore with crop N status. Comparing with a well-fertilized crop strip, a suff￾ciency index (ratio of crop reading/well-fertilized crop reading) can be developed 
and used to apply variable fertilizer dose (see Chap. 39).
27.4 Fertilization of Fruit Trees
27.4.1 Mature Orchards
Mature trees are very effcient in translocating N to reserves (e.g., before leaf fall in 
deciduous species) which will be later made available for new growth. Therefore, in 
mature orchards the calculation of crop N should only consider the amounts of N 
exported in yield, or lost by pruning and leaf fall:
N Y c N = + C B fruit pruning C B N shoots l + eaf fall N C senesced (27.9)
Values of N concentration in fruits are presented in Table 26.1. The concentra￾tions for shoots and senesced leaves may be taken as 1%. The amount of leaf fall 
will be equal to total leaf biomass for deciduous trees and around 50% of leaf bio￾mass for evergreens with leaf life span around 2 years. Note that this is a conserva￾tive estimate of crop N uptake as N in pruning residues is only lost when they are 
burned. The total vegetative biomass production in the growing season (Bv) is the 
sum of biomass in pruning, senesced leaves, and growth of permanent structures 
(trunk, main branches). Then, using the defnition of harvest index, we may write:
B B HI
HI pruning + = leaf fall pl Y − β 1 (27.10)
where βpl is the fraction of Bv not used in permanent structures. This parameter is 
very high (0.8–0.9) for most deciduous species and for evergreens under intensive 
management. Therefore, we can simplify Eq. 27.9 to:
N Y C HI
HI c N = + fruit pl N C pl
 −

 

 β 1 (27.11)
where CN pl is the average concentration of N in pruning residues and senesced 
leaves that may be taken as 1%. Data on HI of fruit crops indicate that it is usually 
above 0.5, so if no information is available for a given species, we may take a 
value of 0.6.
To calculate the amount of fertilizer to apply, we need to consider the fate of the 
pruning residues. If they are burned or exported, only leaf fall remains on the soil, 
which will give back mineral N after mineralization, sometime later. In the best 
case, with zero losses of N from the system, we will recover all N from senesced

leaves. Therefore, the minimum amount of fertilizer to apply if residues are burned 
or exported will be:

where Ef is the average effciency of the fertilizer.
If residues are incorporated, the minimum amount to apply reduces to 
Y CN fruit/EfR.
27.4.2 Young Trees
For young orchards, we have to consider the nutrient demand of vegetative growth, 
which depends on age, species, and environmental conditions. It is not easy to cal￾culate the increase in standing biomass of young trees. For some species, empirical 
relations have been established between tree biomass and trunk diameter. A more 
general and simple approach is to relate canopy growth to transpiration using the 
water use effciency. We extend Eq. 14.9 to the whole growing season:
∆B
VPD
E w
ptree
T
= ∑ α

(27.13)
where T is the duration of growth, while transpiration is proportional to ET0, the 
intercepted radiation equivalent area (REA), and the transpiration coeffcient for full 
ground cover (Ktf) (see Eq. 9.19). Therefore:
∆B
VPD

Example 27.2
An irrigated vineyard yields 25  t/ha of table grape. Water content is 80% 
(Table 26.1), so yield is 5 t dry matter/ha. N concentration in fruits is 0.6% 
(dry matter basis). Now, using Eq. 27.11:

Assuming Ef = 0.8, if pruning residues are incorporated, the minimum fer￾tilizer amount would be 37.5 kg N/ha. If residues are exported, we should 
apply at least 56 kg N/ha. In any case, fertilizer amounts should not exceed 
60/0.8 = 75 kg N/ha. A well-established cover crop (e.g., legume or legume/
grass mixture) could fx enough N to supply or reduce vineyard requirements. 
A fraction of the N content in the residues would be available for the vineyard 
during the growing season after the cover crop is mowed (50%) or incorpo￾rated into the soil (70%).
27 Nitrogen Fertilization II: Fertilizer Requirements414
Finally, we calculate the N uptake (Nc, g N/tree) required for that increase in 
biomass assuming a high N concentration (2%) which is an upper boundary for 
biomass of young trees:
N
VPD c ET REA K

w = ∑ tf 0 02 0

For young trees, the fertilizer applied should match the expected uptake, using a 
proper value of effciency.
A similar approach for fertilizing young trees with N may be taken for P and K 
by applying the proper concentrations. For deciduous trees, we may use 0.2% of P 
and 0.9% of K. For evergreen trees, the values are 0.12% P and 0.9% K.

28 Fertilization with Phosphorus, 
Potassium, and Other Nutrients
Antonio Delgado, Miguel Quemada, Luciano Mateos, 
and Francisco J. Villalobos
Abstract
Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are primary macronutrients required in sig￾nifcant amounts by crops. Both are nonmobile in the soil since they are retained 
in the solid fraction and consequently, their management has some common 
characteristics. Most soil P and K are not available to plants. Reactions involved 
in their cycle in the soil imply that a signifcant fraction of applied P and K is not 
absorbed by the crop. P and K fertilizer management should minimize the trans￾formation of applied nutrients to nonavailable forms and maximize crop absorp￾tion. To this end, banding or fertigation may be an alternative to broadcast 
applications. Management strategies for P and K should be designed in the 
medium and long term, contrasting with mobile nutrients such as N, whose man￾agement strategies are designed in the short term, i.e., for each growing season. 
The effcient use of P and K is gaining interest since both nutrients are nonrenew￾able resources, particularly P whose future scarcity will limit food security.

Other nutrients are usually applied according to a suffciency strategy, i.e., 
when defciency is expected. Defciencies in Ca and Mg are mostly likely in 
acidic soils. Mg defciencies may be promoted by high Ca saturation in the 
exchange complex or by excessive K fertilization due to antagonism. The def￾ciency of micronutrients is not usually caused by a low soil concentration, but 
rather by soil properties that affect their solubility and the plant’s ability to mobi￾lize, absorb, and transport these nutrients.
28.1 Introduction: Phosphorus and Potassium 
as Essential Nutrients
Phosphorus and potassium are the two primary macronutrients nonmobile in the 
soil (see Chap. 2). When applied as fertilizer, both nutrients are quickly fxed in the 
soil solid fraction, mainly by adsorption or precipitation. Thus, in contrast to N, 
leaching risk is usually negligible, except in soils with very low adsorption capacity 
(e.g., very sandy soils). On the other hand, retention reactions in soils imply that 
only a fraction of applied nutrients remains available to plants. Fertilizer manage￾ment must be aimed at achieving maximum effciency in the use of applied nutrients 
by crops. To this end, loss risk (e.g., leaching or volatilization) should be minimized 
in the case of N, while for P and K, we should minimize the fraction of applied 
nutrients fxed in the soil as nonavailable forms (retrogradation).
In terrestrial and aquatic systems, when N is non-limiting, P is usually the limit￾ing nutrient for plant growth. Phosphorus is involved in many biological processes 
in plants. It has a structural role as part of nucleic acids or membrane phospholipids. 
It is involved in phosphorylation reactions, crucial in energy transfer in cells and the 
modulation of enzyme activity or in signal transduction. Plants absorb P actively, 
primarily in the forms H2PO4
− and HPO4
2−.
Phosphorus is stored in plants as inorganic phosphate or polyphosphate or in 
organic form as phytate, the latter being the usual storage form of phosphorus in 
seeds. This storage in seeds is the consequence of a massive translocation at the end 
of the growing season for guaranteeing critical resources for the initial growth of the 
next generation. This explains that, as for N, most of shoot P is stored in seeds in 
grain crops (> 60%), so it will be exported at harvest. Phytate has an impact on the 
effciency of using P since it is not a digestible source of P for nonruminant animals 
including humans. Thus, manure and wastewater are major fows of P, equivalent to 
around 75% of total P applied in agriculture in Europe. When applied to the soil, 
phytate is mostly stabilized by adsorption, not contributing signifcantly to crop P 
uptake. Furthermore, phytate decreases intestinal absorption of Zn and Fe, nega￾tively affecting the nutrition of animals and humans.
Phosphorus defciency has a strong negative impact on crop growth, with leaf 
expansion being more sensitive than P concentration. It may also cause a higher 
root/shoot ratio and, in some species, an alteration in root morphology (“cluster 
roots”). Given the high mobility of P within the plant, defciency symptoms are frst 
A. Delgado et al.417
detected in older leaves that senesce prematurely. Anthocyanin pigments (purple) 
frequently accumulate in P-defcient plants. Normal concentrations in leaves vary 
greatly among species in the range of 0.05–0.3% P (dry matter basis) (Table 28.1).
Excessive P fertilization leads to soil enrichment, mostly in nonavailable forms 
to plants. This excess has been common in North America and Europe since the 
middle of the twentieth century. It is estimated that 70% of croplands in Europe 
have soil P high enough to show no response to P fertilizer and an increased risk of 
Zn and Fe defciencies. P-rich soils will also lose P by soil erosion that will end in 
water bodies triggering eutrophication, the explosive growth of algae and weeds 
that has dramatic impacts on aquatic animals.
Potassium is absorbed actively as cation and the fux is controlled by the internal 
concentration. Once absorbed it is transported mainly to young growing tissues. In 
plants, it is present predominately as a free ion. It acts as an osmoregulator and is 
involved in stomatal control. It plays a crucial role in charge balance in cell organ￾elles and ribosome structure and function and, thus, in protein synthesis. It indi￾rectly promotes photosynthesis and transport of assimilates and has a direct role in 
the activity of at least 50 enzymes. Potassium is also involved in plant tolerance to 
biotic and abiotic stresses such as frost and drought. Contrasting with P, only a 
minor fraction of K is exported with the grains, so it will be mostly recycled within 
the farm in crops such as cereals when residues are incorporated to the soil.
Potassium is usually required in high amounts like N. Its defciency is more com￾mon in sandy, saline, and acidic soils. Defciency causes a reduction in plant growth. 
As it is highly mobile, symptoms appear frst on the oldest leaves, with chlorosis 
and necrosis on the margins. In cereals, K defciency increases lodging risk. 
Table 28.1 shows the common and threshold concentrations of K in the leaves of 
different crops.

As mentioned in Chap. 25, P and K fertilizers are nonrenewable resources 
obtained ultimately from mining. The prospects are worse for P not only because of 
scarcity but also because of new alternative uses.
28.2 P in the Soil
Phosphorus is not abundant in Earth’s crust and soils, with concentrations below 
1 g/kg. It is mainly present as phosphate, found in organic (mostly esters) or mineral 
forms. Mineral and organic forms can be found in the soil solution or bound to the 
solid fraction. Plants absorb phosphate (dissociated forms of phosphoric acid) from 
the soil solution, where it is in equilibrium with specifcally adsorbed forms (see 
Chap. 2) on hydroxylated surfaces (Fe and Al oxides and, to a lesser extent, borders 
of clay minerals and carbonates) and with precipitated metal phosphates (mainly 
Fe, Al, and Ca phosphates, depending on soil pH). Thermodynamically stable metal 
phosphates, such as apatite type in soils with high pH and high Ca saturation, are 
insoluble, thus contributing little to P in the soil solution; other less abundant and 
less stable precipitates can contribute more to P in the soil solution (Fig.  28.1). 
Precipitation as insoluble metal phosphates and adsorption reactions explain that a 
minor fraction of applied P fertilizers is available to plants. Organic forms are 
mainly phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters and can be adsorbed, sometimes 
more strongly than inorganic phosphate, and they can precipitate as well. As in the 
case of N and other elements, P can be used by soil microorganisms and be immo￾bilized, at least temporarily. The reverse process, mineralization, requires the hydro￾lysis of ester bonds and is catalyzed by phosphatases. These enzymes can be 
produced by plant roots and some soil microorganisms. Organic P may account for 
a signifcant fraction (usually between 25 and 75%) of the total P in the soil even in 
Mediterranean soils with low organic matter concentration. Mineralization of this 
organic P through phosphatase activity can contribute to its supply to plants in 
P-poor soils.

Phosphorus concentration in the soil solution of agricultural soils is usually very 
low, below 1 mg/L. This concentration decreases by plant absorption, forcing its 
replenishment from adsorbed or precipitated forms. The relationship between 
adsorbed P and P in the soil solution is determined by the soil buffer capacity that 
depends, among other factors, on the soil adsorption capacity (Fig. 28.2). A high 
buffer capacity indicates a good ability of the soil to replenish P of the solution as it 
is absorbed by the crop. If the buffer capacity is low, the concentration of P in the 
solution may be high, but the soil’s ability to replenish that used by the crop is lim￾ited. On the other hand, applied P fertilizer initially passes to the soil solution but 
will shift to fxed forms at a rate proportional to the buffer capacity. This means that 
to restore a P defciency, higher doses of fertilizer are required in soils with higher 
soil buffer capacity.
The degree of ionization of phosphates depends on the pH (Fig. 28.3). In acid soils, 
monovalent ions predominate, while in neutral soil the ratio between monovalent 
and divalent forms is about 1:1. Plants absorb P mainly as H2PO4
− and HPO4

the latter much more slowly. Therefore, the absorption of P is faster in acid soils. 
Plants can secrete organic acids to the rhizosphere, which release adsorbed P and 
dissolve precipitated P, and phosphatases that contribute to mineralizing organic 
P.  Microorganisms can also release organic acids and phosphatases. Symbiotic 
mycorrhizae can also increase the absorption surface for P.
28.2.1 Plant Available P in the Soil: The Soil P Test
Labile P in the soil is that P in the solid phase that is easily released to the soil 
solution. Plant available P (PAP) is the sum of P in the soil solution and labile P 
(see chap. 2). PAP is usually a minor fraction of total P, frequently less than 10%. 
PAP can be measured by extraction by consecutive crops until evident defciency 
(P starvation assays) but this is not practical. Some chemical extraction methods 
may indicate if PAP in soil is enough to cover crop needs. These methods are known 
as P availability indexes or soil P tests (Table 28.2).

Soil P tests are not a measure of PAP. For each soil P test, threshold values should 
be defned, i.e., the value above which crop yield does not respond to P fertilization. 
Thus, below this value, the soil can be considered P-defcient. Threshold values for 
a given soil P test can vary among soil types and crops. There is no universal soil P 
test since its accuracy for fertilizer requirement estimation is strongly affected by 
soil properties. Only in Europe, more than six offcial P indexes are used in different 
countries, with Olsen and lactate being the most common. Olsen, Mechlich (I and 
III), and Bray are the methods preferred in the USA.
28.3 Estimating the Threshold Values for the Olsen P Test
The soil test level threshold for Olsen P (STLt) varies depending on soil properties 
and climatic factors affecting the water regime in the soil. The threshold decreases 
with increased clay and pH. Thresholds are usually 8–10 mg/kg for clay soils and 
12–20 mg/kg for sandy soils. Environmental factors are more relevant than crop 
type. Most crops have thresholds in the range of 8–17 mg/kg, except in root crops 
(potato and sugar beet) that show higher values (17–25 mg/kg). A higher threshold 
should be expected with higher yields (larger P extractions), but this is not easy to 
quantify. A simple model has been proposed to estimate the Olsen P threshold:
STLt = − 49 0. . 016Clay − 3 81pH (28.1)
where the clay content is expressed as g/kg. This model can be used also in acidic 
soils where Olsen was not recommended in the past. In acidic sandy soils, estimated 
thresholds may be higher than 30 mg/kg. In root and tuber crops, the STLt should be 
increased by 6–8 mg/kg. In rice under fooding, the threshold values are very low 
(3–5 mg/kg) due to the reduction of adsorbent surfaces enhancing P release to the 
soil solution.
28.4 Potassium in the Soil
Potassium is abundant in the soil (0.3–3% in mass) since it is a component of pri￾mary soil minerals such as feldspar and mica. From these minerals, potassium is 
slowly released by weathering. Potassium is found in soluble, exchangeable, and 
non-exchangeable forms. In the soil solution, it is in equilibrium with exchangeable 
K retained by electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged sites on clays and soil 
organic matter. Non-exchangeable K (fxed K) is found within the interlayers and 
on the edges of 2:1 clay minerals and is not readily available to plants (Fig. 28.4). A 
fraction of K supplied as fertilizer becomes fxed in proportion to the fertilizer rate 
and the 2:1 clay content of the soil. Adsorption as exchangeable or non-exchangeable 
forms explains the little mobility of K in the soil.
The plant available K is the sum of K in the soil solution and the exchangeable 
pool. The K concentration in the solution is typically between 0.2 and 10 meq/L, 
usually less than 1% of exchangeable K and can be quickly depleted by plant uptake.

wheat, soybean, and alfalfa) or STLt = 110 + 2.5 CEC (general recommendation)

Plants absorb K only in cationic form. As defned for P, the soil buffering capacity 
for K is the ability to replenish K in the soil solution from that bound to soil parti￾cles, and it is critical to maintain K concentration in the solution in appropriate 
ranges for plants. Potassium buffer capacity mainly depends on clay content and 
mineralogy, being the highest in clay soils with 2:1 as dominant clay minerals.
28.4.1 Plant Available Potassium in the Soil
As for P, K fertilizer management must be based on availability indexes, commonly 
based on the estimation of exchangeable K. The most widespread method is extrac￾tion with ammonium acetate solution at pH 7 (Table 28.3), which shows a good 
correlation with crop response to soil K. Other methods such as buffered BaCl2 or 
unbuffered NH4Cl provide similar results. For acidic soils, methods based on extrac￾tion with acids (e.g., Mehlich or Morgan) have been proposed, generally with good 
correlations with results obtained with ammonium acetate.

28.5 Response of Crops to P or K Fertilizer
The production functions of yield versus applied nutrient (P or K) show similar 
responses with decreasing slope (Figs. 28.5 and 28.6). The relationship between 
yield and P uptake is similar to that described for N, i.e., linear initially and then 
may reach a ceiling (Fig.  28.7). The relationship between fertilizer doses and P 
uptake is linear frst and can reach a ceiling where the absorption is saturated 
(Fig. 28.7). The intercept with the y-axis of the linear portion is the total P absorbed 
from sources other than fertilizer, and the slope of the straight line has been termed 
recovery effciency.

Fig. 28.7 Response of 
maize biomass production 
to P uptake and of P uptake 
to P applied for different 
levels of N supply
The relationship between yield and applied K is similar to those described for N 
and P (Fig. 28.6). The examples shown in Figs. 28.5 and 28.6 indicate that these 
relations described for P and K may vary with N fertilizer applications or soil man￾agement systems. This reveals that nutrition and fertilization for a given nutrient 
cannot be considered isolated. Synergistic effects with other nutrients, such as N, 
explain that accumulation of P and K can be faster if an appropriate N supply is 
performed; this also implies a better response in yield to P or K supply. Adequate 
water supply improves the uptake of P and K and, thus, yield for a given amount of 
fertilizer. Soil water content is critical in explaining nutrient fux to the roots, par￾ticularly in those that move through diffusion due to their low concentration in the 
solution, such as P and K. The key role of water content in nutrient uptake explains 
why in Mediterranean dryland areas (annual rainfall 300–500 mm), the threshold 
Olsen may increase from 4–5 in rainy years to 8–9 mg/kg in dry years.
A. Delgado et al.425
28.6 P and K Fertilization Strategies
P and K fertilization plans are based on soil tests but the interpretation differs among 
countries. Two main strategies are defned based on soil tests, suffciency, and 
buildup and maintenance. The main objective of the suffciency approach is the 
maximum short-term proftability from applied fertilizer and minimum risk of envi￾ronmental impact related to excess fertilizer by accepting some risk of yield loss. 
On the other hand, the buildup and maintenance approach seeks long-term proft￾ability from fertilization and no risk of yield loss due to low fertility.
Due to the complex reactions of P and K fertilizers in soils, optimal P or K sup￾ply to plants is only ensured with soil test levels above the threshold; then, the soil’s 
available reserve of nutrients is enough for an optimal supply (no fertilizer response). 
Below threshold values, optimal P or K supply to crops is not guaranteed even with 
fertilization due to the uncertainty on the fraction of applied fertilizer that can fnally 
remain available to plants. Therefore, according to both strategies, the soil test level 
should stay above the threshold.
28.6.1 Buildup and Maintenance Approach
According to this strategy, if the soil test level (STL) is below the threshold (STLt), 
the soil should be corrected to bring it above (Tables 28.2 and 28.3). The increase in 
P or K may take several years, in proportion to the buffering capacity. The buildup 
rate for a given strategy could vary from soil to soil since P and K reactions in the 
soil cannot be predicted accurately.
After reaching an adequate level of fertility above the threshold value, fertilizer 
applications should compensate the exports of nutrients by the crop. Nutrient 
exports are calculated as the product of the biomass leaving the feld and its nutrient 
concentration (Table 28.4). Soil analysis should be performed every 3–4 years to 
check the trends in fertility and correct the fertilizer rates if needed.
A formulation of the buildup and maintenance strategy could be (Fig. 28.8):
STL < STLt Add exported nutrient + more (according to STL).
STLt < STL < 2 STLt Add only exported nutrient.
STL > 2 STLt (maintenance limit) Add less than exported (e.g., 50%) or do not fertilize.
A model to estimate P fertilizer rate based on the tri-state fertilizer recommen￾dation is:

The frst component in the model compensates for crop exports, and the second 
component (buildup) is intended to promote a progressive increase of soil P up to 
the threshold. STL and STLt are given in mg/kg, ρb is bulk density (t/m3
), and Z is 
soil depth to correct (m). Nyear is the number of years of buildup, considering that the 
amount of buildup per year should not exceed 30 kg P/ha.

In soils with a high P fxation capacity (high Fe oxide content or clayish and 
calcareous), the application of rates equal to crop exportations (when STLt < STL < 2 
STLt) could lead to a long-term decrease in STL. In this case, P rates 10–30% above 
crop exportations could be recommended. Nevertheless, periodic soil analyses are 
needed to detect possible errors.
In the case of K, the buildup component is corrected by a factor fK that depends 
on the soil’s K interlayer fxing capacity (Table 28.5).

where ρb is bulk density (t/m3

account the fraction of K that does not remain available to plants.
Massive applications of P and K are less effective in terms of the ratio of 
available/applied nutrients. This is why the fertilizer rates should not exceed 30 or

The soil P concentration (Olsen) in the top 25 cm is 7 mg/kg and the K con￾centration is 100  mg/kg (ammonium acetate). We grow maize with an 
expected yield of 15 t/ha (14% moisture). Soil bulk density is 1.4 t/m3
. The 
texture is clay (45% clay) and pH = 7. Calculate P and K fertilizer rates fol￾lowing a buildup and maintenance strategy. Calculate also if Olsen P is 27 mg/
kg and K is 300 mg/kg.

and 275 kg K/ha are the annual limits recommended in a buildup and maintenance 
strategy.
Above a certain level, defned as the maintenance limit, rates lower than crop 
exportation (e.g., 50%) or no fertilizer are applied. The maintenance limit can be 
calculated as twice the threshold value.
28 Fertilization with Phosphorus, Potassium, and Other Nutrients428
28.6.2 Sufficiency Approach
If initial STL is lower than the threshold, this strategy would begin by buildup appli￾cations which may be applied in several years as in the case of the buildup and 
maintenance strategy. Once the soil test is above threshold values, it is tested every 
year, and fertilizer is only applied when the nutrient level is below this value. The 
suffciency approach was initially recommended to avoid environmental problems 
Now, according to Table 28.4, P and K concentrations in maize grain are 
0.32% and 0.34%; thus, the amounts of P and K removed in grain are:
12,900 kg/ha ⋅ 0.0032 kg P/kg = 41.25 kg P/ha
12,900 kg/ha ⋅ 0.0034 kg K/kg = 43.8 kg K/ha.
Estimate of Olsen P threshold according to Eq. 28.1:
STLt = 49–0.16⋅45–3.81⋅7 = 15 mg/kg.
Now we use Eq. 28.2:
P rate = 41.25 + 10 ⋅ 1.4 ⋅ 0.25 ⋅ (15–7) = 41.24 + 28 = 69.3 ≈ 69 kg P/ha 
(340 kg triple superphosphate/ha).
The buildup component is 28, below the 30 kg/ha limit.
If Olsen P is 27 ppm, as it is below the maintenance limit (30 mg/kg), we 
may apply only the exported nutrient:
P rate = 41.25 ≈ 41 kg P/ha (e.g., 205 kg triple superphosphate/ha).
For K:
For a clay soil, we can consider a threshold value of 250 mg/kg of acetate 
extractable K (Table 28.3).
Increase in K = 250–150 = 100 mg/kg.
From Table 28.5 for clay soil, we have a range of fK between 2.5 and 5. We 
take fK = 3.
K rate (kg K/ha) = 43.8 + 10 ⋅ 1.4 ⋅ 0.25 ⋅ 3 ⋅ (250–150) = 43.8 + 1050.
The buildup component is much higher than the maximum of 60 kg K/ha.
To stay below the limit, we would need 17.5 years. Taking Nyear = 18:
K rate (kg/ha) = 48.3 + [(10 ⋅ 1.4 ⋅ 0.25 ⋅ 3)/18] (250–150) = 106.6 ≈ 107 kg K/ha.
which may be supplied with 258.3/0.5 = 214 ≈ 210 kg potassium chloride.
If soil K is 300 ppm, as it is above the threshold and below the maintenance 
limit, then we should compensate only the exported nutrient:
K rate = 43.8 kg K/ha (e.g., 87.6 ≈ 90 kg potassium chloride).
Example 28.1 (continued)
A. Delgado et al.429
derived from an excessive P enrichment of soil which leads to high P concentration 
in water bodies triggering eutrophication effects. Beside this, it has another advan￾tage: it promotes an increased use of residual P and K in the soil, i.e., a progressive 
starvation of P and K levels in soils may enhance the transformation of nonavailable 
forms to available forms and thus enhance use by plants of nonavailable forms. In 
any case, this can be understood as a depletion of soil nutrient reserves which in the 
long term may imply the application of increased rates of fertilizer.
28.7 Calcium and Magnesium
The application of Ca, Mg, and S usually follows a suffciency strategy, so they are 
applied only if their defciency is expected. Calcium and Mg have a similar cycle to 
that described for K (Fig. 28.4). Available amounts are also the sum of nutrients in 
solution plus the exchangeable pool. All extraction methods used for K can be use￾ful as Ca and Mg availability indexes. Threshold STLs for Ca and Mg according to 
the ammonium acetate extraction are 250–500 and 30–60 mg/kg, respectively. The 
thresholds increase in proportion to CEC. Low availability of Ca can be found in 
acidic sandy soils with low base saturation.
Fertilization with K, Ca, or Mg must take into account the available levels of the 
other alkaline or alkaline earth nutrients since antagonistic effects may appear. 
Exchangeable K/Mg ratios above 0.5 can induce Mg defciency and values lower 
than 0.1 promote K defciency. On the other hand, Ca/Mg ratios above 10 may pro￾mote Mg defciency, which may be a consequence of liming. When the Ca/Mg ratio 
is lower than 2, Ca defciency may appear.
28.8 Sulfur
Sulfur is a component of amino acids, proteins, and vitamins. Plant sulfur concen￾tration is 1.0–1.5%. The concentration of S increases to more than 3% in saline 
soils. Total S uptake is similar to that of P, with a large variability among crops, i.e., 
legumes and cruciferous plants require more S than P. High concentrations of S in 
harvested organs (>7 g S/kg dry matter) are found in Brassica oleracea (cabbage, 
broccoli), soybean, onion, tomato, and castor bean (Table 28.6). Fruits and tubers 
show low values (<1 g S/kg d.m.). Most S in plants is associated to N with ratios 
N/S between 5 (nuts) and 15 (legumes).
S defciency has become frequent due to the reduction in S atmospheric deposi￾tions, the increase in yields, the reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers 
containing S, and losses by soil erosion and leaching. The latter will occur mostly 
in nonacidic soils, where S is a mobile nutrient. Residue burning causes the loss of 
most N and S to the atmosphere while P and K remain.
More than 95% of soil S is in organic form, composed of organic sulfates and 
C-bonded S. The ratio N/S in soil organic matter is 8:1. Most soil inorganic S is 
sulfate which is the predominant form absorbed by roots. Availability of S improves 
by no tillage and adding organic amendments. Microbes play a critical role in

oxidizing S to sulfate during the growing season and depending on the availability 
of soil C.
Adsorption of sulfate by oxides is negligible at pH > 6.5, so liming in acidic soils 
increases S availability. Phosphate fertilization also contributes to S availability in 
acidic soils by the competition of phosphate for sorption sites.
Soil analyses of sulfur hardly correlate with actual S availability during the 
growing season, so they are rarely performed. It is then advisable to follow a main￾tenance approach to keep steady-state values of soil S.
If needed, S is added as sulfate in straight or compound fertilizers. For instance, 
cruciferous crops may be fertilized with K2SO4 instead of ClK, or with ammonium 
nitrate sulfate instead of ammonium nitrate. S-enriched mineral fertilizers are more 
expensive, so organic fertilizers rich in S might be incorporated into the fertilization 
program.
28.9 Micronutrients
Micronutrient availability to plants is not only determined by their content in the 
soil, which is dictated by the soil forming process. This availability is affected by 
soil properties affecting their solubility and the ability of plants to mobilize, absorb, 
and transport them. The effect of pH is critical. The availability of Fe, Cu, Mn, 
and Zn is constrained by basic pH, which in turn is controlled by carbonates. 
Soil organic matter affects the availability of micronutrients to plants since it may 
have a complexing effect that affects their solubility. Excessive P fertilization can 
promote Fe and Zn defciency. B retention in soils increases with pH, so it will be 
defcient in calcareous soils. Molybdenum is the only micronutrient whose def￾ciency risk increases in acidic soils.
The paradigmatic case is Fe, an abundant element in soils whose availability is 
strongly reduced in calcareous soils. Iron defciency, known as Fe defciency 
chlorosis, is the consequence not only of the insolubility of Fe compounds at basic 
pH but also of the failure of the mechanisms involved in its accumulation in plants. 
Iron chlorosis is a relevant agronomic problem in calcareous soils whose typical 
symptom is interveinal yellowing (chlorosis) of young leaves. However, the suscep￾tibility of plants to Fe chlorosis varies widely. Due to the low solubility of Fe com￾pounds in soil, plants have mechanisms for mobilizing Fe from soil minerals like 
A. Delgado et al.431
the exudation of low molecular weight acids. In sensitive plants, these mechanisms 
are not effective. In addition, cell membrane transporters may fail with basic pH in 
the apoplast conditioned by soil pH. This leads to an accumulation of Fe in the apo￾plast but not inside the cell and consequently to an accumulation in the plant while 
defciency symptoms appear. This is called the “iron paradox”; Fe accumulates in 
the plant without physiological activity. Plants tolerant to Fe chlorosis exudate 
Fe-specifc chelating compounds (phytosiderophores), able to mobilize it from soil 
and facilitate its transport through membranes.
Zinc is the second micronutrient in terms of nutritional problems in calcareous 
soils, especially for cereals, tolerant to Fe defciency. In calcareous soils, Zn is fxed 
on carbonates and iron oxides, decreasing its plant availability. Organic ligands 
from decaying organic matter or root exudates can improve Zn availability to plants 
in soils poor in organic matter. The defciencies of Cu and Mn are less usual, and the 
latter is related to soils with Mn-poor parent material.
The defciency of Zn is not only an agronomic problem but also a human health 
problem when diets are based on cereals with low Zn concentration. Increasing the 
concentration by agricultural practices or plant breeding is called biofortifcation.
Soil microorganisms can affect micronutrient availability to crops. 
Microorganisms have mobilizing mechanisms usually based on organic acid and 
chelating compound exudation. Many microorganisms produce specifc chelating 
compounds for Fe that increase its availability to plants. Competition for Fe may 
occur between plants and microorganisms, the latter being more competitive. 
The availability to plants of other nutrients such as Zn can be affected also by 
microorganisms.
Due to the relevant role of carbonates in Fe defciency, the “active calcium car￾bonate,” an index related to their reactivity, has been used to predict its defciency. 
The most usual soil test for micronutrients is the extraction with the chelating agent 
DTPA (Table 28.7).

28.10 Increasing the Efficiency of P and K 
Fertilizer Applications
Phosphorus fertilizers have traditionally been used as basal fertilizers before sow￾ing, spreading over the soil surface and incorporating with tillage. They can also be 
applied at planting with adequate sowing machinery that incorporates the fertilizer 
into the soil in bands parallel to the crop rows. This application at planting is the 
only chance for incorporating fertilizers under no tillage. Furthermore, incorpora￾tion decreases the risk of accidental P losses and avoids enriching the surface layer 
with P that would facilitate losses by runoff or erosion. The time from P application 
to sowing should increase for low-solubility fertilizers, not less than 3 months for 
rock phosphate.
Fractionation of P fertilizer is uncommon and could be justifed to avoid leaching 
in very sandy soils saturated with P. Fractionation with soluble P fertilizer may be 
interesting in soils very low in P and high in calcium or for crops with high P 
demand. The main limitation for P applications after planting is the low mobility in 
the soil, as they would enrich P in the soil surface, increasing P loss risk and reduc￾ing P available in depth. Thus, P fractionation is only possible when fertilizer can 
be incorporated into the soil, particularly close to the root system. Fertigation 
(Chap. 29) meets these requirements and favors P fux to the roots, improving the 
effciency of applied P as compared to traditional basal applications.
As P shows low mobility in the soil, band application at sowing, particularly in 
low-P soils, is recommended. Localized applications reduce retrogradation by satu￾rating the fxation capacity of a more reduced soil volume, locating the fertilizer 
closer to the roots, and usually promoting the early growth of crops (“starting” 
effect). The amount of P that can be banded is not limiting except if P is applied as 
ammonium phosphate since ammonium can be phytotoxic at high rates; in this case, 
less than 40 kg N/ha as ammonium should be applied. Banded fertilizer at sowing 
must be located in bands 5 cm to the side and 5 cm below the seed to avoid injuries 
due to high salt concentration.
Application of P as organic amendments/fertilizer or with organic matter should 
be considered also for improved effciency. Organic matter competes with P for 
adsorption sites and decreases the precipitation as insoluble metal phosphates, thus 
clearly enhancing the recovery of applied P. This explains why greater improve￾ments of soil P have been found with manure applications when compared with 
soluble inorganic fertilizers. The application of P as organic by-products is also 
gaining interest nowadays as a P recycling strategy.
K fertilizer is also applied before or at sowing. Fractionation decreases interlayer 
fxation and localized application in bands contributes to saturating the soil and 
keeping a high concentration in the soil solution. However, no improvement in 
recovery effciency can be expected with the joint application with organic matter, 
except in very sandy soils, since the only contribution of organic matter to the soil 
K cycle is to provide a more charged surface and thus more retention capacity if clay 
content is very low.
A. Delgado et al.433
As for micronutrients, soil biological factors affect the uptake of P and K by 
plants. Mycorrhiza improves the uptake of both nutrients by increasing the absorp￾tion surface and the organic P hydrolysis through phosphatase activity. In the case 
of P, free-living microorganisms can also contribute by exudation of acids and 
organic ligands promoting the dissolution of almost insoluble precipitates or with 
phosphatase activity. Plant breeding for increased production of phosphatases has 
also been attempted. All these biological factors are relevant for improved use of the 
nonavailable P forms in soils.

Abstract
Fertigation is the joint application of nutrients along with irrigation water. It is 
best suited for high-frequency drip irrigation although it may be adapted to other 
irrigation methods. Fertigation requires a dosing system and tanks for the stock 
solution where nutrients are incorporated. The main characteristics to consider 
for the fertilizers used in fertigation are concentration, purity, solubility, and pH 
reaction. Irrigation water quality should also be considered, especially the con￾centration of bicarbonates and calcium. The calculation of stock solutions is 
based on the total requirements for N, P, and K and total irrigation to be applied. 
Specifc recipes for fertigation solutions have been developed for several species. 
Complete nutrient solutions (e.g., Hoagland-Arnon) are easy to calculate consid￾ering the actual concentration of salts in irrigation water.

29.1 Introduction
Fertigation is the joint application of water and nutrients, which requires adding a 
nutrient-dosing device to the irrigation system. Although this technique can be 
applied to all types of irrigation systems, it is generally used in drip irrigation 
systems and to a lesser extent in full-coverage sprinkler systems and irrigation 
machines.
If handled correctly, fertigation results in a very high effciency in nutrient 
application, particularly with high-frequency drip irrigation. This high effciency is 
explained by the following:
(a) A localized fertilizer application, which is more effcient in poor-nutrient or 
high cation exchange capacity (CEC) soils. This is relevant for nutrients strongly 
bound to soil particles such as P and K.
(b) Drip irrigation systems cause a concentration of the root system within the wet 
bulbs; thus, the nutrient application is concentrated in areas of high root length 
density, where most nutrient uptake occurs.
(c) The water content in wet bulbs is usually close to the feld capacity of the soil; 
high water content enhances the fux of nutrients to roots through mass fow or 
diffusion, thus increasing the effciency of applied fertilizers.
(d) Fertigation with drip irrigation allows frequent application of very low fertilizer 
doses, which allows matching nutrient supply to plant requirements that can 
vary depending on the growing stage. This has clear advantages for mobile 
nutrients such as N since large soil N accumulation is avoided, thus decreasing 
losses and opening the opportunity for reducing N application. This is seen 
when fertigation with N is compared with a conventional N fertilization com￾bining one basal and two side-dress applications (Fig. 29.1). With nonmobile 
nutrients, such as P and K, frequent application of very low doses enhances 
fxation in forms (adsorption vs precipitation in calcareous soils in the case 
of P) that are in equilibrium with the soil solution, thus increasing the effciency 
of applied nutrients. Additional advantages of fertigation are related to irriga￾tion uniformity (see Chapter 23).
Fertigation can be a cost-effective fertilizer application technique when a drip irri￾gation system has been installed. Although it requires a dosing device, after this 
initial investment, the equipment and labor costs for applying fertilizers are usually 
lower than with other techniques. On the other hand, the fertilizers used are usually 
more expensive.
29.2 Dosing Systems
Fertigation is usually performed by injecting fertilizer in liquid form (fertilizer 
solution, commercial or prepared on the farm) into the irrigation water fow to the 
emitters. Two types of dosing methods can be distinguished:
F. J. Villalobos et al.441
Fig. 29.1 Time course of crop N uptake and soil N availability for conventional fertilization and 
fertigation. (Adapted from Quemada and Gabriel (2016). Global Food Security, 9: 29–35)
(a) Proportional: It applies a constant nutrient concentration, so the fow of 
nutrients entering the system has to be proportional to the irrigation fow.
(b) Quantitative: A total amount of nutrients is added to the irrigation system. 
The concentration varies with time.
Fertilizers may be injected with different types of devices (Fig. 29.2):

solution
(a) Differential pressure.
A pressure-regulating valve connected to the fertilizer tank is inserted 
between the inlet and outlet. The pressure difference forces the water to fow 
through the tank, carrying the nutrients to the main line.
It can add solid or liquid products and serves only for quantitative dosing. 
It is easy to maintain and does not require additional energy but the pressure in 
the main pipe is reduced. This method is suited for conditions where fertigation 
is performed at irregular intervals.
(b) Venturi system. It connects a Venturi device (narrowing) in parallel to the main 
pipe. The depression in the Venturi causes the suction of the nutrient solution. 
This system allows proportional dosing. The fertilizer application rate can be 
adjusted to small amounts but causes pressure loss in the main pipe.
The depression depends on the water velocity; thus the accuracy of a Venturi 
dosing system depends on the capacity of the irrigation system to maintain a 
constant fow.
(c) Injection pump. An electric or hydraulic pump may be used. In the latter case, 
no energy supply will be required. It is easy to install and operate, allows adjust￾ing the dose, and does not involve pressure loss in the main pipe. It can be used 
for proportional or quantitative dosing.
(d) Direct connection. The irrigation pump inlet is connected to the fertilizer tank. 
The nutrient concentration is kept constant. If a system for tank automatic 
flling is added, the concentration will vary with time. This is a simple and 
inexpensive method best suited for small installations but diffcult to automate. 
The main problems are the risk of sucking air in the pump and the pump 
damage by corrosion.
Whatever the system chosen, it is advisable to install a flter downstream of nutrient 
injection and check valves to prevent contamination of the supply line if return 
fow occurs.
29.3 Alternatives of Fertigation
Different types of fertigation can be defned depending on the combination of nutri￾ents applied in each fertigation.
F. J. Villalobos et al.443
(a) With complete nutrient solutions: Although it is the usual choice for hydroponic 
systems on artifcial substrates such as rock wool and perlite, it can also be used 
for crops on soil. The nutrient solution applied in each fertigation should include 
all macro- and micronutrients. This will require the use of several tanks to avoid 
incompatibility problems between different fertilizer products:
Tank A: Macronutrients except Ca in an acid medium, usually applying part 
of N or P such as nitric or phosphoric acid.
Tank B: Fertilizers with Ca in neutral or acid medium.
Tank C: Micronutrients in neutral medium.
Another alternative for the distribution of nutrients:
Tank A: NPK.
Tank B: N, K, Ca, S, and micronutrients.
Tank C: Nitric acid.
Fertigation with N, P, and K in soil may require only one tank. For hydroponics, 
the better choice is three tanks.
(b) Incomplete solutions: In cropping systems on soil, we may apply P as basal 
fertilizer before sowing to avoid the high cost of P soluble forms and the high 
probability of P precipitation in the system. In this case, only N and K are usu￾ally applied through fertigation. Only one tank is required since N and K com￾binations are not problematic. We may apply each primary nutrient from a 
different tank in different irrigation events. This alternative reduces the risk of 
precipitation in the tank or irrigation net.
Whatever the type of fertigation tank, its size and the total amount of fertilizer 
dissolved is determined by the solubility of the less soluble fertilizer.
29.4 Fertilizers for Fertigation
The main properties considered in fertilizers for fertigation are nutrient concentra￾tion, purity, solubility, pH effect, and compatibility. The electrical conductivity (EC) 
in the applied solution should not exceed certain thresholds, and the pH should be 
in the 5.0–6.5 range, so nutrients are available for root uptake. Precipitates can be 
formed above this range (e.g., Ca compounds with phosphate), while below, the root 
system may be damaged. The main properties of fertilizers more widely used in 
fertigation are shown in Table 29.1.
The form in which N is supplied is a critical aspect of fertigation. Nitrogen can￾not be supplied exclusively as NH4
+ because (a) it is phytotoxic at high concentra￾tions in the growing media and (b) it can promote a decreased uptake of other 
cations such as Ca2 +, Mg2 +, and K +. This is caused by competition for absorption

The simplest solid fertilizers are included except acids, provided as liquids. Practical solubility 
refers to the maximum amount of product to dissolve in stock solutions prepared in the farm and 
is between 25% and 50% of solubility at low temperature
mechanisms and decreasing electrochemical potential through plasma membranes, 
which induces an increased excretion of H+ by root cells to maintain an electro￾chemical gradient. Conversely, when N is provided only as NO3
−, its absorption 
promotes the alkalinization of the root apoplast and the rhizosphere due to the 
absorption mechanism of nitrate (symport with H+). This effect can impair the 
absorption of other nutrients such as Fe. Therefore, N should be applied as 80–90% 
nitrate and 10–20% ammonium to maintain an optimum pH of the rhizosphere 
while taking advantage of the acidifcation effect of NH4
+. Applying N only as NO3
−
could be a good choice for fertigation in acid soils.
Temperature is the critical factor affecting fertilizer solubility, which is propor￾tional to temperature. Thus, the maximum concentration of fertilizers in a solution 
is determined by the minimum temperature in the tank. Dissolving fertilizers is usu￾ally an endothermic reaction that decreases the temperature of the solution. The 
effect is important for urea and nitrates (ammonium, calcium, and potassium). 
However, dilution of phosphoric acid is an exothermic reaction that can be used to 
compensate for the effect of endothermic dissolution reactions, thus increasing the 
solubility of the fertilizer added afterward.
F. J. Villalobos et al.445
The most common products are highly soluble, like nitrates (calcium, ammo￾nium, potassium) and potassium chloride. To ensure high purity and solubility, the 
fertilizer industry produces specifc solid fertilizers for fertigation and commercial 
solutions (e.g., N − 20 solution). Composite solid fertilizers and liquid fertilizer 
solutions are presented in a wide range of ratios N/P/K, with or without micronutri￾ents. Liquid composite fertilizers have a low nutrient concentration due to solubility 
limitations.
The use of incompatible fertilizers or the interaction of the fertilizer with irriga￾tion water, especially if it is hard and/or alkaline, can cause precipitation in the fer￾tilization tank and the clogging of drippers and flters. These problems can be 
avoided with the right fertilizers and adequate irrigation management, i.e., allow for 
enough leaching, and use acidifed fertilizer solutions.
The main incompatibilities among fertilizers in fertigation are those involving 
the risk of precipitation of Ca and Mg compounds (Table  29.2), such as the 
following:
Calcium nitrate in combination with phosphates or sulfates leads to precipitation of 
calcium sulfate or calcium phosphate.
Ammonium phosphate with magnesium sulfate leads to precipitation of magnesium 
phosphate.
Micronutrient application should consider the stability of the forms in which they 
are applied, usually as chelates that are affected by pH and by the presence of other

29.5 Quality of Water for Fertigation
The main salts in water are chlorides, sulfates, carbonates, and bicarbonates of Ca, 
Mg, Na, and K. Some waters may contain other ions (nitrates, phosphates, ammo￾nium, etc.) and certain metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, etc.) that can be toxic (Table 29.3). 
Standard laboratory analyses of irrigation water include the major cations (Ca2 +, 
Mg2 +, Na+, and K +) and anions (Cl−, SO4 2 -, CO3
2−, HCO3
−). Boron may also be 
determined because of its high toxicity even in small concentrations. Nitrate con￾centration (dominant N form in water) should also be measured to discount it from 
the crop N requirement.
The most common problem is the presence of bicarbonate, which combines with 
Ca and Mg and may precipitate depending on the pH. Waters high in Ca with alka￾line pH will cause problems with more than 2 meq/L of bicarbonate. To correct 
these problems and keep pH in the desired 5.0–6.5 range, an acid is added, leaving 
0.5 meq/L of bicarbonate not neutralized.
Another possible problem is related to P fertilizers. Insoluble Ca and Mg phos￾phates are generated in waters high in Ca or Mg when pH is high. These precipitates 
are deposited on the pipe walls and in the emitters, causing their clogging. The 
availability of P to the plants is also reduced. Acid P fertilizers such as monoam￾monium phosphate (MAP) or phosphoric acid will reduce the risk of precipitation 
of Ca and Mg phosphates.
In any case, dissolved fertilizers remaining in the emitters at the end of the ferti￾gation can precipitate when water evaporates. To avoid this the duration of fertiga￾tion should be shorter than that of irrigation allowing fushing with water at the end 
of the irrigation. To dissolve the precipitates left and unclog the drippers, we may 
use the acidic reaction of some fertilizers and/or the injection of an acid solution 
that also removes bacteria and algae. After injecting the acid, the irrigation and the 
injection systems should be carefully washed with additional irrigation water.
Other quality issues in irrigation water may be the following:
(a) The presence of algae (irrigation ponds) or bacteria (groundwater, ponds) 
requires additional treatments, which may be performed with chlorine, copper 
sulfate, or potassium permanganate.

This antagonistic effect is stronger with fertigation than with conventional fertilization since fer￾tigation keeps higher Mg and K concentrations in the soil solution

(b) Ferruginous underground waters produce Fe or Mn rust deposits when they 
oxidize. They require frst pre-treatment such as aeration or chelation and then 
fltration to retain precipitated oxides.
29.6 Calculation of Stock Solutions
In fertigation systems with proportional dosing, a concentrated solution known as 
stock or mother solution is prepared in the irrigation head. Fertigation is pro￾grammed to dilute the solution with the irrigation water in the ratios of 1:100 up to 
1:500 while controlling the pH and EC. This irrigation water with the added fertil￾izer will reach the emitters after fltering. This solution reacts with the substrate and 
results in the fnal nutrient solution absorbed by the roots.
The electrical conductivity (EC, dS/m) may be calculated approximately as a 
function of the concentration of cations (CC, in meq/L) or anions or as a function of 
the salt concentration (CS, also named total dissolved solids, TDS, in g/L):
EC CC Cs = = 10 0 6. 4 (29.1)
For the calculation of the stock solution, we may face different situations:
(a) We know the total amount of N, P, and K to add to the total amount of irrigation. 
Therefore, we deduce the concentration of the nutrient and then convert it to a 
quantity of fertilizer to be added using the concentrations indicated in Table 29.1. 
The maximum solubility (e.g., 80% of this) should not be exceeded, particularly 
if temperature oscillations are expected. In the fnal fertilizer solution, the stock 
solution is diluted M times, so the amount of fertilizer to add to the stock solu￾tion (kg fertilizer/m3
) will be:

(b) We know the ideal concentration of each nutrient (Ne, Pe, Ke) in meq/L, and we 
want to determine the amount of fertilizers to be added to the tank, considering 
that the stock solution will be diluted M times. We have two possible options:
(b.1) No acid correction is needed. In the simplest case, we have soft water 
with less than 0.5 meq bicarbonate/L so no pH correction is required. In 
hydroponics, dissolved bicarbonate could be the C source for autotrophic 
nitrifying microorganisms; thus, nitrifcation is enhanced by a low NH4
+/
NO3
− ratio.
29 Fertigation448
We start from the P fertilizer requirement, as it is often the element of lower 
concentration. We will apply P as monoammonium phosphate (MAP) or monopo￾tassium phosphate (MPP) to cover the needs. The remaining needs of N and K will 
be completed with potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, and/or potassium sulfate.
Example 29.1
The ideal solution for a given crop is 4–1-2  meq/L.  The stock solution is 
diluted 200 times.
With MAP:
P: 1  meq P/L ∙115  mg MAP meq P−1 ∙ 10−3
  g  mg−1 ∙103
  L  m−3
  =  115  g 
MAP m−3
.
This amount contains also 1 meq/L of NH4
+, which is discounted from the 
required N concentration, so we still need 3 meq N/L which may be achieved 
with 1.5  mmol/L of ammonium nitrate, AN (each mol provides 2 equiva￾lents of N).
1.5 mmol AN/L ∙ 80 mg AN mmol AN−1 ∙ 10−3
 g mg−1 ∙ 103
 L m−3
 = 120 g AN m−3
Finally we satisfy the K requirement using potassium sulfate (PS):
2 meq PS/L ∙ 87.2 mg PS meq PS−1 ∙ 10−3
 g mg−1 ∙ 103
 L m−3
 = 174.4 g PS m−3
The concentrations in the stock solution will be obtained by multiplying 
the concentrations above by the dilution factor (200):
MAP 23 kg m−3
NO3NH4 24 kg m−3
SO4K2 34.9 kg m−3
We should check that the concentrations in the stock solution do not exceed 
the solubility of the selected fertilizers (Table 29.1).
Other possible stock solutions could be:
MKP 27.2 kg m−3
NO3K 20.2 kg m−3
NO3NH4 24.0 kg m−3
MKP 27.2 kg m−3
SO4K2 17.4 kg m−3
NO3NH4 32.0 kg m−3
(b.2) Water with more than 0.5 meq HCO3
−/L: The pH has to be corrected. 
Under these conditions, dissolved bicarbonate is not restrictive for nitrifca￾tion, so the ratio NH4
+/NO3
− is not important.
Acid is used to neutralize bicarbonate leaving only 0.5 meq/L. Then the 
procedure is similar to that explained in the previous case.
F. J. Villalobos et al.449
Example 29.2
Ideal solution 4–1-2 meq/L. Water with 3.5 meq/L of HCO3
−. Dilution 200 
times. Correction with phosphoric acid 55% (density 1.38 g cm−3
).
To neutralize 3.0 meq/L of HCO3
−, we need 3.0 meq/L of protons that can 
be supplied by 1 mmol/L of pure PO4H3.

 (phosphoric acid 55%).
We have also covered the need of P (1 meq/L).
We will cover now the need for K using potassium sulfate (PS):
2 meq K/L ∙ 87.2 mg PS meq K−1 ∙ 10−3
 g mg−1 ∙103
 L m−3
 = 174.4 g PS m−3
To supply 4  meq/L of N with ammonium nitrate, as each mol gives 2 
equivalents of N, we will apply 2.0 mmol AN/L:
2.0 mmol AN/L ∙ 80 mg AN mmol AN−1 ∙ 10−3
 g mg−1 ∙103
 L m−3
 = 160 g AN m−3
Then we apply the dilution factor (200) and arrive at the following stock 
solution:
Phosphoric acid 55% 31.6 L m−3
SO4K2 34.9 kg m−3
NO3NH4 32.0 kg m−3
Example 29.3
Ideal solution 4–1-2 meq/L. Water with 3.5 meq/L of HCO3
−. Dilution 200 
times. Correction with nitric acid 57% (density 1.35 g cm−3
).
To neutralize 3.0 meq/L of HCO3
−, we need 3.0 meq/L of protons that can 
be supplied by 3 mmol/L of pure NO3H.
3 mmol /L ∙ 63 mg mmol−1 ∙ 10−3

 (nitric acid 57%).
which contains also 3  meq/L NO3; thus we need a further addition of 
1 meq/L of N to complete the required 4 meq N/L.
We apply P as MAP:
1 meq P/L ∙ 115 mg MAP meq P−1 ∙ 10−3
 g mg−1 ∙ 103
 L m−3
 = 115 g MAP m−3
which contains also 1  meq/L NH4
+, therefore satisfying the whole 
needs of N.
Finally, we apply K as potassium sulfate:
2 meq K /L ∙ 87.2 mg PS meq K−1 ∙ 10−3
 g mg−1 ∙ 103
 L m−3
 = 174.4 g PS m−3

29 Fertigation450
We apply the dilution factor (200) and arrive at the following stock solution:
NO3H (57%) 49.1 L m−3
MAP 23 kg m−3
SO4K2 34.9 kg m−3
Example 29.3 (continued)
There is software available for the calculation of stock solutions. For instance, 
the Nutrient Solution Calculator developed by L. Incrocci (U. Pisa) allows calculat￾ing the stock solution when the recipe is known.
29.7 Fertigation Control
The EC in the emitters can be estimated from water analysis and the amount of 
applied fertilizers. In any case, EC and pH can be measured in emitters to check the 
accuracy of the calculations. In systems that allow measuring drainage volume and 
the characteristics (pH, EC) of the input and output solutions, we can check if the 
fertigation program is correct and amend it if necessary. This would also serve for 
automation of the fertigation program.
First, we set the target leaching fraction (LFt) as a function of the nutrient solu￾tion EC. The observed LF should be similar to LFt. Otherwise, the irrigation volume 
should be adjusted.
Low nitrate concentration in drainage may indicate that N is limiting, so its con￾centration should be increased in the nutrient solution.
A higher value of EC and/or chlorine in the leachate than in the applied solution 
indicates an accumulation of salts in the root zone. If the difference between the EC
of drainage and irrigation water is greater than 0.4–0.5 dS/m, and/or if the chlorine 
concentration in the drainage solution is higher than that of the incoming solution 
and above 50 mg/L, an irrigation without fertilizers should be applied to leach salts.
The optimum pH of the irrigation solution is 6–6.5 and can be adjusted by acid 
injection. The drainage water pH should not exceed 8.5. Otherwise, the NH4
+/NO3
−
ratio of the nutrient solution should be increased up to 0.25.
29.8 Calculation of Complete Nutrient Solutions
In the case of hydroponics, we need complete solutions including micronutrients. 
The macronutrients to be added are determined taking into account the composition 
of the irrigation water and the composition of the ideal solution. A widely used 
reference nutrient solution is the one proposed by Hoagland and Arnon. The calcu￾lation procedure is shown in Example 29.4. Table 29.4 shows the composition of 
recommended solutions for different species.

The need for applying micronutrients is increasing in proportion to crop yields 
but also because fertilizer products contain less micronutrients and manure applica￾tions have been reduced. The availability of micronutrients usually increases as the 
organic matter content of the soil or substrate increases and is reduced by irrigation 
with hard or alkaline water. In any case, we should prevent micronutrient excesses 
that may cause toxicity (Table 29.5). Metallic micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni)

Example 29.5
An orange grove has an annual N fertilizer requirement of 200 kg N/ha. The 
total amount of irrigation applied is 500 mm. We will calculate the amount of 
fertilizer to add to the stock solution (dilution x200) to meet those N needs.
We assume that we want to apply only N, so we rule out NP and NK fertil￾izers and restrict to urea and ammonium nitrate (AN). We could also apply 
other fertilizers containing sulfur, calcium, or magnesium, but they are dis￾carded because of their low N concentration.
Irrigation water should have a concentration:
200 kg N/5000 m3
 = 0.04 kg N m−3
 = 40 g N m−3
.
The two alternatives would be:
40 g N m−3
 /(0.34 g N/g AN) = 117.6 g ammonium nitrate m−3
40 g N m−3
 /(0.46 g N/g urea) = 87 g urea m−3
.
The alternative stock solutions for a 200 dilution would have concentra￾tions of:
117.6 g ammonium nitrate m−3 ∙ 200 = 23.52 kg ammonium nitrate m−3
.
87 g urea m−3 ∙ 200 = 17.4 kg urea m−3
.
are usually present in soils and substrates as oxides and hydroxides of low solubility 
at high pH. Boron and molybdenum, whose concentrations are generally lower than 
those of metallic micronutrients, are more soluble and may be present in irrigation 
water or organic fertilizers. Chlorine is also a micronutrient but is rarely scarce and 
can be toxic at high concentrations.
Micronutrients are added as chelates or salts that can be applied individually or 
as ready-made solutions. For some species, optimal concentrations of micronutri￾ents in the nutrient solution have been determined (Table 29.6). Some authors rec￾ommend providing all metallic micronutrients as chelates although some available 
soluble inorganic salts can be used (e.g., CuSO4), but usually are less effective in 
providing available nutrients to plants due to oxidation in the soil, particularly in the 
case of Fe.
29.9 Examples of Fertigation Programs
29 Fertigation454
Example 29.6
A citrus orchard requires 200 kg N/ha and 270 kg K/ha with a total irrigation 
application of 500 mm. We will calculate the stock solution (dilution x200) to 
meet those needs of N and K.
Our frst choice is a fertilizer containing both K and N, potassium nitrate 
(PN). To supply 200 kg N/ha and 270 kg K/ha, as the concentrations of N and 
K are 13.4 and 39%, respectively, we should add:
270 kg K/ha /(0.39 kg K/kg PN) = 692 kg PN /ha
692 kg PN/5000 m3
 = 138.4 g PN/ m3
.
That contributes also:
692 kg PN/ha ∙ 0.134 kg N/kg PN = 92.8 kg N/ha.
We still need to add 200–92.8 = 107 kg N/ha that is equivalent to 315 kg 
ammonium nitrate/ha or 233 kg urea/ha.
If we choose urea, the concentration in irrigation water will be:
233 kg urea/5000 m3
 = 46.6 g urea/m3
And the stock solution will be:
27.68 kg potassium nitrate m−3
 and 9.32 kg urea m−3
Alternatively, we could have used simple fertilizers (urea and potassium 
sulfate) and the stock solution would be:
26.0 kg potassium sulfate m−3
 and 17.4 kg urea m−3
.
Example 29.7
Calculate the minimum size of the fertigation tank for the previous example 
considering that the maximum irrigation requirement is 4.5 mm day−1
 and that 
the fertilizer is added every day. We will consider only the option of using 
urea and potassium nitrate.
The required concentrations in irrigation water were calculated in 
Example 29.6:
138.4 g potassium nitrate/m3
46.6 g urea/m3
.
Now by looking at Table 29.1, we see that the maximum concentration to 
be allowed in the stock solution would be:
Urea, 260 kg m−3
; potassium nitrate, 80 kg m−3
.

Abstract
Proper soil health is crucial to ensure that cropping systems provide essential 
ecosystem services, including food and fber production. When soil properties 
are not adequate for crop production and limit yields, we should improve soil 
conditions and in extreme cases reclaim affected felds. First, the causes behind 
the loss of soil health should be identifed so specifc treatments to improve the 
soil functionality can be implemented. This chapter reviews the main causes 
affecting soil degradation and proposes solutions to maintain and recover soil 
health. Low content of soil stable organic matter (SOM) is one of the main issues 
associated with cultivated soils and can lead to multiple problems including 
reduction of nutrient fertility, soil water holding capacity, and soil aggregate sta￾bility that may lead to cultivation restrictions. Strategies to maintain or build up 
SOM rely in a mass balance between losses and biomass inputs. Soil physical 
properties such as compaction, stoniness, or structural degradation require

specifc corrections relying on mechanical operations and/or management prac￾tices (i.e., tillage intensity, cover cropping). Reclamation of soils affected by 
chemical issues (salinity, sodicity, and acidity) is conducted by the application of 
amendments and/or leaching that relies on chemical equilibria revised in this 
chapter. Finally, the concept of regenerative agriculture is defned and exempli￾fed by a case study.
30.1 Introduction
The critical resource in agricultural production is the soil. Therefore, we should 
preserve and improve, if needed, its biological, chemical, and physical properties. 
The actual conditions of many soils around the world are far from adequate for crop 
production and limit yields. For instance, more than 20% of soils are affected by 
salinity, while 40% show problems related to acidity.
In some cases, the problem is inherent to the soil (salinity due to parent material, 
stoniness), while in others it is the result of poor management. That is the case for 
salinization of irrigated areas, acidifcation due to N fertilizers, loss of soil organic 
matter, or soil compaction by tillage or machinery. Avoidance of these problems is 
considered in chapters about tillage (17), soil management (18), salinity (24), nitro￾gen fertilization (26), and cropping systems (36).
Extreme cases of soil degradation may occur as a result of severe pollution of 
soils by mining or industrial activities (Box 30.1).
We have several options to correct or mitigate these problems: chemical prob￾lems are dealt with amendments and/or leaching, while physical problems require 
mechanical operations and/or crops’ use as biological tools. The lack of organic 
matter can only be addressed by increasing the input of dry matter to the rotation. 
Correction of one issue may help with another. For instance, increasing stable 
organic matter (SOM) will alleviate the risk of compaction and improve soil 
aeration.
Box 30.1. The Aznalcollar Disaster
On April 25, 1998, the failure of a dam containing acid water and toxic mud 
from mining occurred in Aznalcollar (Spain). It caused a spill that affected 
3000 ha of agricultural land. After mechanical removal of the mud, the soil 
was still polluted with Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Tl, and Pb. Several experiments of 
phytoremediation (using crops to remove the pollutants) were performed to 
compare the uptake of these heavy metals by different species (barley, triti￾cale, rapeseed, and Ethiopian mustard). The main drawback of this technique 
was the long period required to extract all the heavy metals (around 50 years) 
although the concentrations found were below the tolerance level for use 
as fodder.
The fnal solution was the purchase by the regional government of all the 
contaminated land that was then planted with trees and shrubs and kept as a 
natural park.

30.2 Soil Health
As mentioned in Chap. 2, soils are living entities providing essential ecosystem 
services including primary productivity. These services are the “soil functions” and 
the capacity of soils to perform them has been defned as “soil health” or “soil qual￾ity,” depending on authors. The Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) 
defned soil health as “the ability of the soil to sustain the productivity, diversity, and 
environmental services of terrestrial ecosystems,” i.e., to perform the so-called soil 
functions. This capacity is affected by human intervention and may be recovered, 
preserved, or promoted with adequate practices controlling soil degradation.
Soil health refers to soil properties that can be altered by management over the 
human time scale, so it reinforces the idea of soils as dynamic living systems, with 
diverse biological communities that perform crucial processes.
A healthy soil is able to perform the following functions:
– Provide food in quantity and quality, and other goods such as fber and fuel; 
although focus has been frequently put on the productivity, soils can also affect 
food quality (e.g., micronutrients such as Fe or Zn in food, or the absence of 
contaminants).
– Contribute to water regulation and purifcation since water fows over and 
through soils affecting landscape hydrology; on the other hand, soils have 
adsorption capacity and may decrease pollutants in water, contributing to 
decrease the pollution of water bodies and ensuring water quality for animal 
and humans.
– Serve as a habitat for biodiversity, not only in terms of plants and animals but 
also for microorganisms that can contribute to relevant ecological services such 
as control of pest or diseases or are involved in the nutrient cycle.
– Capture carbon, as stabilized organic matter in soils, contributing to climate 
change mitigation.
– Nutrient cycling, i.e., closing the cycle of nutrients on the earth surface. This 
implies controlling the nutrient availability and losses essential for the recycling 
of nutrients at farm or regional scales.
Each of these functions is not related to a single soil property. As an example, 
water regulation and purifcation are affected by texture, structure, mineralogy, pH, 
etc. Biological properties affect strongly different soil functions, e.g., soil microor￾ganisms that are involved in the hydrolysis of organic phosphorus will indirectly 
affect soil productivity by providing nutrients to plants or carbon storing through 
mineralization of organic matter.
30.3 Soil Organic Matter
Organic matter in the soil is the fraction of the solid phase that derives from the 
accumulation and transformation of organic residues. A portion of the C in organic 
matter corresponds to the microbial biomass (usually in the range of 1–5%), a major 
30 Soil Improvement and Reclamation460
actor in the transformation of organic compounds in soil. Although a huge variety 
of organic compounds are present in soil, from a practical point of view, they can be 
classifed as fresh organic matter (residues with little biological transformation), 
intermediate decay products, and stable organic matter (SOM) or “humus.” Most of 
the well-known positive effects in soil properties are associated with SOM, such as 
its contribution to particle aggregation and cation exchange capacity.
Organic products applied to the felds are either fresh (crop residues, manures, 
slurries, etc.) or in an intermediate stabilization state in microbial-mediated trans￾formation process (digestate, half-composted manures, etc.), so they go through an 
in-feld decomposition process carried out by soil microorganisms and associated 
microfauna in a continuous loop. Decomposition is coupled to the mineralization of 
C compounds that produced both CO2 that is emitted to the atmosphere and mineral 
salts that serve as nutrients to plants and microorganisms. Only a small fraction of 
the organic products is not mineralized by microorganisms and leaks to the SOM or 
humus, the recalcitrant pool that interacts with the mineral particles; thereafter this 
process is called humifcation. The cycle is named the soil organic matter turnover 
and is a key process to ensure soil functions and to maintain soil health (Fig. 30.1).
SOM refects the balance between humifcation and losses. SOM is usually 
expressed on a mass basis (t SOM/ha) or as a percentage of the total soil mass, but 
it can be also expressed as carbon (C) to facilitate the connection with biogeological 
cycles. The amount of C content in the SOM is calculated by multiplying by 0.58. 
The C/N/P/S ratio of SOM is near 100/10/1/1 and may be used to estimate the nutri￾ents released by mineralization.
In each feld, the SOM balance leads to a steady state that depends on the soil 
type, environmental conditions, and management. Therefore, an optimum SOM 
level cannot be established due to the broad varieties of soils, environments, and 
cropping systems. As a reference, usual recommended values for Mediterranean 
loam or clayey soils are SOM >1.5% in rainfed cropland and > 2% in irrigated.

the soil and added organic products

30.3.1 Soil Organic Matter Losses
Losses of SOM are mainly due to topsoil erosion and mineralization. In this chapter, 
we will focus on SOM mineralization, a slow but continuous process that can lead 
to soil degradation if it is not compensated by new organic matter inputs.
Mineralization is the oxidation of the organic C by soil microorganisms; there￾fore, it is enhanced in well-aerated soils. Additionally, clayey soils protect the SOM 
from decomposition by forming microaggregates, whereas in sandy soils the SOM 
molecules are more exposed to microbial activity. Therefore, mineralization is 
enhanced in sandy aerated soils and slowed down in clayey soils. Tillage aerates the 
soil and accelerates SOM mineralization, whereas reduced or no-tillage decelerates 
mineralization. Another soil characteristic that affects mineralization is the pH; near 
neutral or slightly basic soils (particularly if they contain high calcium carbonate) 
have a higher mineralization rate than acidic soils with low base saturation.
Humidity tends to increase SOM because it diminished oxygen availability, but 
on the other hand, it increases biomass production and C inputs into the soil. Flooded 
soils present low mineralization and decomposition rates and tend to have high 
SOM levels. The higher mineralization rates are found around water feld capacity, 
as low water availability limits mineralization. Nevertheless, arid and semiarid soils 
usually have low SOM because the crop litter input is low.
SOM losses are enhanced by temperature as mineralization is driven by microor￾ganisms, increasing from 0 to 35 °C. The combined effect of humidity and tempera￾ture is clearly observed in Europe, where SOM decreases from the cold and wet 
North to the warm and drier South. When water and temperature conditions favor 
microbial activity, the mineralization and decomposition rates are enhanced greatly; 
because of that in irrigated land of warm semiarid regions, SOM losses can be 
extremely high. In all soils, care should be taken to offset SOM losses by the incor￾poration of other external organic products if needed to ensure a humic equilibrium 
(SOM maintenance).
Mineralization is usually represented as a frst-order process. In the simplest 
approach, only a SOM pool is considered, and it is associated with a mineralization 
rate (K2), so the variation of SOM until time t is calculated as:
SOM SOM SOM K t 0 0 t 2 − = 1− −( )  
 exp (30.1)
where SOM0 is the amount of humus present at time (t) zero.
The K2 rate depends on environmental conditions, soil type, and management 
(Table 30.1). Values like those of the table can be obtained by applying the equation 
proposed by Hénin-Dupuis based on the annual average temperature (Tav) and on 
the soil clay (sc, g/kg) and CaCO3 content (cc, g/kg):

cropped with a wheat and barley rotation. Consider (i) that all the straw is 
incorporated in the soil and (ii) the straw is burned.

Grain yield, 3600 kg ha−1; straw, 3650 kg ha−1; root biomass = 25% of 
aboveground biomass; dry matter for roots and straw is 85%. The fraction of 
residue converted into SOM is 0.22 for the straw and 0.12 for the roots (see 
Sect. 30.3.2).

SOM will decrease until a new steady state is reached. High risk of soil 
degradation exists unless losses are offset by the application of external 
organic products (SOM maintenance). 
More sophisticated SOM models such as RothC or Century distinguish various 
pools, each one with a specifc mineralization rate. The active pool is very sensitive 
to management practices and turnovers within a week to a year. The slow pool 
refects the effect of agricultural practices within a few years to decades, whereas 
M. Quemada et al.463

representative soil from North American grasslands after bringing virgin land under cultivation. 
(Adapted from Brady & Weil, 2008)
the passive pool only shows changes in the long term (turnover ranging from 
decades to centuries). The grasslands of North America showed a SOM decrease 
after the start of cultivation in the nineteenth century. The return to native vegeta￾tion, the addition of organic amendments, or conservation tillage increased C 
sequestration in the various organic pools (Fig. 30.2).
30.3.2 Improving Soil Organic Matter
Soils with SOM content below recommended values have low fertility, retain less water, 
are prone to erosion, and are likely to present structural problems that impair their culti￾vation capacity. Because of that, in soils with low SOM, it is necessary to adopt practices 
that decrease losses (erosion control, conservation tillage) and/or increase the addition 
of organic products to build up SOM and ensure proper soil functioning.
Only a small fraction of the added organic products ends up building SOM, and 
this fraction is called the isohumic coeffcient (K1) (Table  30.2). The fraction 
depends mainly on the complexity of the molecular structure of the organic prod￾ucts, being larger when the lignin and polyphenol content increases or when the 
organic products are more stabilized. The biomass from grasses used as cover crops 
terminated in the vegetative state has a lower isohumic coeffcient than the lignifed 
straw produced at harvest. Similarly, fresh yard manure that contains easily decom￾posable molecules has a lower isohumic coeffcient than a material produced after 
composting the same yard manure. The contribution to the SOM is not immediate 
but it is parallel to the decay of the organic product and so it can take several years.
The decomposition of the organic materials added is determined by the soil and 
environmental conditions mentioned in the previous section but also by the quality 
of the added products, characterized by the complexity of the molecular structure

Fig. 30.3 Organic product decomposition as the result of the decay of its various fractions
and by the C/N ratio. In addition to the lignifed fraction, organic products contain 
an easy-to-decompose labile fraction (soluble carbohydrates, amino sugars, etc.) 
and an intermediate (cellulose, starch). The decomposition of the organic product 
occurs altogether in a frst-order process that is the addition of the decay of the vari￾ous fractions (Fig. 30.3).
The decomposition can be delayed when high C/N organic products are added to 
the soil if suffcient N to support microbial growth is not available, either in the 
products or in the soil. Therefore, decomposition of high C/N products can be accel￾erated by mixing with other N-rich materials or even by adding synthetic fertilizers. 
When the C/N < 20–25, the microbial activity and so the decomposition are not N 
limited. The C/N ratio of SOM is between 8 and 12, being 10 the most common 
value, and organic products added to the soil will be stabilized by decomposition 
until they reach this range.
There are multiple tests to characterize the residue quality and to estimate K1 but, 
in many cases, lookup tables are used as a frst approach (Table 30.2). A limitation 
is that K1 also depends on the soil properties affecting the stabilization of organic

A rainfed farm applies a four-crop rotation in North Spain. The crops are 
barley, fodder rape, wheat, and fodder pea. The soil in the farm is loam and 
has a pH = 8.0 and SOM = 1.4%. The farm is under reduced tillage and a 
chisel plow is used to incorporate crop residues down to 0.25 m. The topsoil 
bulk density is 1.40 g cm−3
 and K2 = 1.05%.

matter, and so the clay content and mineralogy may affect the yield in humus that a 
given residue produces under particular edaphic conditions. This contributes to 
explain the relative wide range of values observed in different works and presented 
in the table.
Typical decomposition or decay rates for organic products in non-sandy soils are 
0.5 in the frst year, 0.3 in the second, and 0.1 in the third. In sandy soils or if the 
product has a low structural complexity, the decay rates are 0.6 in the frst year and 
0.3 in the second. Some recommendations on limits to the use of manure for increas￾ing SOM are shown in Table 30.3.
Finally, some physical properties of organic products can affect the decay rate. 
The particle residue size determines the surface area exposed to the microorganisms 
for decomposition, and so small particles decay more rapidly than large ones. 
Chopping or other mechanical treatment of residues (i.e., branches or straw) can 
greatly accelerate the decomposition of organic materials. Incorporation of organic 
products into the soil facilitates access to bacteria and other soil microfauna, enhanc￾ing decomposition and decay rate.

30.4 Improving Soil Physical Properties
Soil physical degradation is related to various relevant problems that require spe￾cifc correction actions (Table 30.4). For instance, low SOM increases soil compac￾tion and degrades soil structure. Because of this, the best course for improving soil 
physical conditions in the long term is to combine actions that improve permanently 
these key soil properties combined with others that might provide a short-term 
improvement, for instance, using cover crops and organic amendments systemati￾cally to increase SOM after subsoiling or deep plowing to improve a heavily com￾pacted soil.
30.4.1 Soil Compaction
Soil compaction refers to a situation in which the soil is so consolidated that limits 
plant growth by restricting root growth. Soil compaction can be evaluated using two 
different soil properties (see Chap. 2.3):
(i) Soil bulk density defned as the mass of dry soil for a given volume. Bulk 
density is independent of the soil water content.
(ii) Penetration resistance defned as the force required to insert a cone of standard 
dimensions at a given depth into the soil. Penetration resistance increases as the 
soil dries.
Careful observations can help diagnose the problem, like detecting poor crop 
growth in all years, with all crop types showing the same spatial pattern in different 
years, eventually associated with wheel tracks, or digging the soil surface with a 
spade to detect dense layers and/or horizontal root growth. Soil compaction becomes 
an issue when it limits plant growth, i.e., some soils of relatively high bulk density 
do not present a compaction problem. This might be the case on soils under conser￾vation tillage, which tend to have a higher bulk density than those plowed but pres￾ent a more stable and optimized pore space and a better soil water content, which 
M. Quemada et al.469
allows good root growth. Soil compaction might occur in specifc soil layers or 
throughout the soil profle, as in over-traffcked areas. The former is the case of the 
plow pan, the layer of the soil that is consolidated by traffc and plowing operations 
but remains below the plow depth.
Soil compaction can be due mainly to three situations that may happen simulta￾neously. One is excessive or poorly managed traffc on the farm. Traffc of agricul￾tural equipment, or grazing animals, needs to be reduced in intensity to the minimum 
required. The timing of traffc is also important, and no traffc or trampling should 
be allowed on wet soil since they result in over-consolidation of the soil profle 
which can reach up to 50  cm, a depth that can’t be reached by common tillage 
operations and results in a plow layer of over consolidated soil in depth. A comple￾ment to controlled traffc is to limit the traffc always to the same tracks reducing the 
surface of the compacted area. This can be attempted with any kind of equipment 
but is facilitated by GPS. We may use lighter farm equipment or reduce the pressure 
on the soil (using the appropriate tire pressure or special low-pressure tires). In pas￾tures, we may reduce the grazing density and avoid excessive concentration of ani￾mals by increasing the number of drinking and feeding areas. Compaction issues are 
exacerbated in soils with a poor structure and stability of the soil aggregates, which 
happen in soils with a low SOM and intensively tilled. A particular case is that of 
sodic soils in which a high sodium content results in a very poor soil structure and 
high compaction.
Soil compaction may occur even under proper traffc management, when extreme 
degradation of soil structure is caused by intensive tillage, leading to low SOM and 
poor aggregate stability. This lack of structure can also be the result of high sodium 
content in the soil, either naturally or due to irrigation. A third situation that can lead 
to extreme soil compaction is when accelerated erosion exposes a subsurface soil 
layer that is compacted, for instance, a poorly developed subsurface soil horizon or 
the parent rock from which the soil is formed (Fig. 30.5).
All the measures mentioned above (proper control of traffc and trampling; 
improvement of soil structure by reducing or eliminating tillage; using conservation 
agriculture techniques like no-till or cover crops; increasing soil organic matter 
content, again using conservation tillage and/or adding organic amendments) are 
techniques that should be incorporated to ameliorate or prevent soil compaction. 
However, when the soil is already compacted, the most effective, and immediate, 
way to alleviate compaction is through plowing. The depth and kind of equipment 
to perform this tillage depend on the depth that compaction reaches into the soil 
profle, as well as the soil (or parent material) type. So, surface compaction can be 
alleviated using a chisel plow, while a deep subsurface plow layer can only be alle￾viated by subsoiling. To reduce compaction of an exposed subsurface horizon, we 
may perform tillage to mix this layer with the remaining topsoil using a moldboard 
or a disk plow. All these tillage operations are energy-intensive and costly, so they 
need to be carried out when the soil is at the optimum soil moisture content (Chap. 
17). They should be considered in the context of an integrated strategy, using the 
techniques mentioned at the start of this paragraph, to avoid repeating plowing.

30.4.2 Stones
The presence of coarse material, above 2  mm in diameter (ranging from 2 to 
200 mm), has an overall negative effect on some key soil properties like soil water 
holding capacity and can harm the quality of some crops, like potatoes, yams, or 
carrots. A high stone content also has a negative effect on the workability of differ￾ent farming equipment, like that used for sowing, tillage, or harvest. Stony soils are 
common, occupying around 30% of agricultural area in Western Europe and more 
than 60% in the Mediterranean basin.
Although a stone mulch can have some benefts for reducing soil evaporation and 
increasing infltration, the problems associated with stones in the soil compel the 
farmers to reduce their amount in the rooting depth using the following methods:
1. Stone gathering and removal from the feld, with machines pulled by a tractor, 
leaving the stones in a pile or disposed of for further uses.
2. Stone crushing on-site using specialized machines.
3. Deep burial in which stones in the topsoil are buried by tillage, if they are small, 
or tipping them into a big hole.
Stone removal reduces the topsoil volume, while stone crushing has a higher cost 
because it works poorly on hard stones (e.g., non-weathered granite); stone burial is 
limited by the depth at which stones can be buried by machinery. In all cases, we 
should be aware that destoning might be necessary for the future when stones in the

also have a negative effect on the soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, 
in particular when crushing is used.
30.4.3 Other Techniques
The improvement of soil physical conditions increases water storage and enhances 
root growth. This can be achieved in the medium term following the same strategy 
outlined in Sect. 30.4.1 to prevent soil compaction. Sometimes we need to acceler￾ate this process in extremely degraded soils to start their restoration process. For 
this, a successful strategy is to combine the incorporation of soil organic amend￾ments with the sowing of herbaceous vegetation, which can be further incorporated 
into the soil as green manure or left for self-seeding (Fig. 30.6). This cycle can be 
repeated until the soil reaches a soil health status in which conventional techniques 
of conservation tillage can keep its physical properties.
30.5 Reclamation of Saline Soils
In general, a soil is classifed as saline when its electrical conductivity in the satura￾tion extract or saturated soil paste (ECe) is greater than 4 dS/m. However, the toler￾ance of plants to salinity ranges widely. Yields decay in sensitive crops occurs at 
30 Soil Improvement and Reclamation472
ECe < 2 dS/m (e.g., beans, maize, pepper, potatoes); meanwhile, tolerant crops have 
good performance even at ECe > 8 dS/m (e.g., cotton, barley, sugar beet). Soluble 
salts most commonly present are the chlorides and sulfates of Na, Ca, and Mg. 
Sodium and chloride are the dominant ions, especially in highly saline soils, while 
Ca and Mg concentrations are usually enough to meet the crop needs. Many saline 
soils contain appreciable quantities of gypsum (CaSO4∙2H2O), while soluble car￾bonates are never present. The pH of the saturated soil paste is always lower than 
8.2 and usually close to 7.
Saline soils usually have good physical properties as excess salts keep the clay in 
a focculated state. Some saline soils, particularly heavy clays, tend to disperse 
when leached with low salt water.
Saline soils can be recognized by the spotty growth of crops (irregular plant size, 
barren spots) and often by the presence of white salt crust (salt efforescence) on the 
surface. This is because there is always substantial spatial variability in the soil 
water properties that leads to wide spatial variations in soil salinity. If salinity is 
moderate and in the few cases it is uniform across the feld, it may go undetected as 
it may not cause visible symptoms other than reduced growth rate, with the excep￾tion of a blue-green tinge in some cases. Symptoms of salinity stress may resemble 
those of water defcit without wilting due to gradual osmotic adjustment. Symptoms 
of specifc toxicities, mainly ascribed to Cl or Na, (marginal or tip burn of leaves) 
are typical of woody plants.
The reclamation of saline soils is performed by salt leaching. The important 
question is the amount of water required and the best application strategy. Evacuation 
of drained water must be guaranteed, and if required to this end, a drainage network 
should be installed before salt leaching.
Theoretically, if the soil behaves as a perfect porous medium and assuming that 
there is no precipitation or dissolution of salts, the change in salts stored in the soil 
after applying an amount of water (AW) with ECw is given by:

Several empirical models have been proposed to estimate the volume of water 
required. Each soil differs in behavior, and the same amount of water has different 
leaching effciencies in different soils, so feld experiments are usually performed to 
determine the amount of water required. We have seen before (Example 24.3) that 
an amount of water equal to the depth of the soil would leach theoretically 96% of 
the salts. However, in practice, such an amount (equivalent to 1.5–2 times the pore 
volume) removes only around 70% of soluble salts.
Sprinkler irrigation is more effcient in salt leaching than surface irrigation. This 
is mainly due to preferential fow occurring under saturated conditions, leaving part 
of the soil without leaching. For the same reason, intermittent application of surface 
irrigation is more effcient (although slower) than continuous application. To calcu￾late the depth of water required (Iw, mm) to reclaim a given soil depth Z (mm) to go 
from an initial EC (ECe init) to a fnal desired EC (ECe fnal), we may use the following 
equation:

where the parameter kleach depends on soil properties (soil water content at saturation 
and texture) and the irrigation method. For continuous ponding kleach = 0.45 in peat 
soils, 0.30 in clay loams, and 0.1 in sandy loams. For intermittent ponding or sprin￾kler irrigation, kleach = 0.10.
In the case of saline-sodic soils, the addition of gypsum may help in improving 
water infltration and thus accelerate both desalinization and desodifcation of the 
soil, especially in heavy textured soils, or when low electrolyte water is applied. The 
application of amendments should be tested by trials on an experimental scale for 
large-scale reclamation projects.
Example 30.4
The soil has ECe = 10 dS/m with drains at 1 m depth. We plan to reclaim the 
whole soil depth (Z = 1000 mm) to reach a fnal ECe = 2 dS/m using sprinkler

30.6 Reclamation of Sodic Soils
Sodic soils are those with a high content of exchangeable Na that adversely affects 
soil properties and the growth of most crops. As mentioned in Chap. 2, sodic soils 
are those with exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) greater than 15. Sodium 
negatively affects soil physical properties by promoting colloid dispersion and 
clay swelling. In these soils, crops may be affected by Na toxicity. The pH in not 
saline-sodic soils, i.e., ECe less than 4 dS/m, is usually above 8.5, and in extreme 
cases, it may be above 10.5. This can promote negative effects on plant nutrition, in 
particular micronutrient defciencies such as Fe defciency chlorosis, and microbial 
activity. The pH in saline-sodic soils, i.e., ECe > 4 dS/m, is usually below 8.5, and 
salinity counteracts the dispersive effect of Na. Dispersed and dissolved organic 
matter in the soil solution of sodic soils may be deposited on the soil surface by 
evaporation, generating a dark surface that is why these soils have been termed 
black sodic soils.
The objective of reclaiming a sodic soil will be decreasing the amount of Na in 
the exchange complex by increasing the amount of Ca. This is achieved by amend￾ment with Ca-rich products. After Na replacement by Ca, it is necessary to leach the 
soluble Na salts, which is diffcult because of the low permeability of sodic soils. 
This may be improved by adding electrolytes (chemical amendments added to the 
irrigation water) and tillage.
Usual amendments for sodic soils include calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, 
or gypsum, the latter being the most frequently used. Sulfur can also be applied in 
calcareous soils since it oxidates to sulfuric acid that reacts with carbonates to form 
gypsum; the reclamation process is, however, slower since sulfur should be oxi￾dized. Replacement is faster with soluble products, and thus calcium carbonate is 
the least recommendable product. Its use is not practical in calcareous sodic soils. 
Frequently, byproducts rich in gypsum have been used, like phosphogypsum from 
the phosphate fertilizer industry. The availability of gypsum has increased, as it is 
the byproduct of scrubbing sulfur dioxide gases from the emissions of coal-fred 
power plants.
Gypsum amendments are normally broadcast and then incorporated into the soil 
by disking or plowing. Fine ground gypsum is more quickly solubilized. When the 
problem is a surface crust, the gypsum needs are reduced. If the problem is in deeper 
layers, gypsum contributions should be much larger. Gypsum may also be applied 
dissolved in the irrigation water, which increases effciency.
In general, the reclamation with gypsum is performed in several stages. The 
common practice is to make a frst application of approximately 10 t/ha of gypsum 
in the frst year with 1.5 m of water. In subsequent years (2 or 3), more applications 
of gypsum of 4 t/ha accompanied by some leaching may be performed.
Amendment rates for sodic soils are calculated based on the required reduction 
in ESP. This reduction is usually recommended down to ESP = 10 as the effciency 
of amendments for replacing Na decreases sharply below that value. The equiva￾lents of Ca (and thus of amendment) to be applied are the equivalents of Na to be 
M. Quemada et al.475
replaced from exchange sites (on a soil mass basis). Thus, the amendment rate 
(Kg gypsum/ha) to be applied can be calculated as:
Amendment rate = ⋅ 100 EM ⋅ − F Z g b ρ CEC E( ) SPi f ESP (30.5)
where EM is the equivalent mass (86 for gypsum), ρb is soil bulk density (t/m3
), Z is 
soil depth (m) to be restored, CEC is the cation exchange capacity (cmol+/kg), ESPi
and ESPf are the initial and fnal values of ESP of the soil, respectively, and Fg is an 
effciency factor that varies from 1.1 (ESPf = 0.15) to 1.3 (ESPf = 0.05) for gypsum.
This calculation can be applied to sodic soils. However, in saline-sodic soils, it is 
diffcult to estimate accurately the exchangeable cations since chemical extractions 
to this end also dissolve soluble salts. Exchangeable cations are usually overesti￾mated if specifc analysis methods are not used. This is why USDA proposes a cal￾culation based on the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the saturation extract of the 
soil. Since numerical values of ESP and SAR are quite similar, this calculation can 
be done using the model above and replacing ESP by SAR, with the same fnal value 
of 10 as a recommendable value, such as in the example below.
30.7 Reclamation of Acidic Soils
Acidic soils have a pH below 6.5 in water or saline (e.g., KCl) extracts. Soil pH is 
related to the base or acidity saturation of the exchange complex. In this regard, the 
percent of base saturation (PBS) decreases and the percent of acidic saturation (PAS) 
increases with decreased pH values. pH in saline extracts is lower than that in water 
since exchangeable acidity is released to the solution. This difference increases with 
increased exchangeable acidity in soil.
The reclamation of acidic soils with amendments (liming) aims at increasing the 
percentage of base saturation (and consequently to decrease the acidic saturation) 
to values that do not constrain plant growth. In this regard, sensitivity of plants to 
acidity ranges widely, with legumes in general being more affected by acidity than 
cereals. Some authors suggest a target PBS from 60 to 80% for most crops, which 
implies pH between 6 and 7. The main risk below pH 5.5 is Al toxicity. A pH of 6 
ensures that all exchangeable Al is neutralized forming nontoxic compounds.
Example 30.5
Soil bulk density is 1.3 t/m3
, and CEC is 40 cmol+/kg. The initial SAR is 0.20 
and we want a fnal value of 0.10. The amount of gypsum to recover the top 
0.3 m layer of soil will be:

30 Soil Improvement and Reclamation476
Products used as amendments for acidic soils should provide cation bases with 
positive effects on the soil. The most recommendable is Ca, although some amend￾ments can provide Mg as well. This ensures the supply of these nutrients to crops 
and the amelioration of soil physical properties (see Chap. 2). Increasing PBS results 
in higher pH; also, reactions of the product in the soil should contribute to increas￾ing the soil pH. Traditionally, products rich in calcium carbonate have been used. 
Mining products such as limestone, dolomitic limestone (essentially composed of 
calcium-magnesium carbonate), and marls (unconsolidated mixes of clay and cal￾cium carbonate) are usual amendments for acidic soils. The products resulting from 
the combustion of limestone, i.e., calcium oxide or hydroxide, are more soluble but 
caustic and diffcult to mix with soils when wet. Industrial byproducts such as sugar 
industry slag (rich in calcium carbonate) or basic slag (calcium silicate) from the 
steel industry may be used. Gypsum and phosphogypsum have been used as Ca 
sources for reducing aluminum toxicity in acidic soils; however, these products are 
not as effective as limestone in increasing pH.
Small-size particles are good for the application of poorly soluble products such 
as limestone and dolomite (or any carbonate-based amendment) since this increases 
the surface area in contact with soil. Thus, the quality of the amendment product and 
the time for achieving the objective depends on the particle size. This is less relevant 
in soluble products such as Ca oxides or hydroxides. Since the reaction of poorly 
soluble products is slow, they should be applied well in advance to sowing (3 months 
for limestone, 6 months for dolomites). The amendment should be mixed with the 
soil, down to 15–20 cm after broadcasting. Under no tillage, the surface application 
to reclaim a 15–20 cm soil depth may lead to high soil pH in the soil surface and, 
thus, nutrient defciencies. However, there is a slow base movement and pH will 
increase in depth with time, something that may take months or even years.
The amendment (liming) rate can be calculated on an equivalent basis as the 
equivalents necessary to increase base saturation to a given value. This will lead to 
an increased soil pH. The negative charge of soil components such as oxides or 
organic matter increases with increased pH. Thus, the CEC of acidic soils increases 
when pH increases with liming. This is particularly relevant in highly weathered 
tropical soils rich in Fe and Al oxides. This is why some authors base the calculation 
on the estimate of CEC at a fxed pH value (buffering at pH 7) and propose the 
calculation of liming requirement as:
Liming rate kg
ha


 

 = ⋅ 100 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ( ) − 1 EM R Z f CEC PBS PBS b L f i
– ρ (30.6)
where EM is the equivalent mass of the compound acting as amendment (e.g., 50 for 
calcium carbonate, 26 for CaO); R is the percent of active compound over product 
mass (e.g., sugar industry slag has R = 25 for calcium carbonate); ρb is soil bulk 
density (t/m3
); Z is the soil depth (m) to be restored; CEC is the cation exchange 
capacity (cmol+/kg) determined at buffered pH 7 (ammonium acetate method); and 
PBSi and PBSf are the initial and fnal values of PBS. fL is a liming factor to take into 
M. Quemada et al.477
account that not all of the applied amendment replaces exchangeable acidity from 
the exchange sites. This effciency in replacing acidity decreases with increased 
initial soil pH (increased base saturation). It has been shown that fL is around 1.05 
for PBSf < 50%. Thus, in this case, almost all the applied Ca replaces acidity in 
exchange sites. However, its value increases with increased PBSf up to 1.25 when 
fnal base saturation is close to 100%. In this model, since CEC is determined at a 
fxed pH, the result does not vary with increasing pH after amendment; thus, the 
calculation of the amendment is really based on the increase in exchangeable bases 
content in soil.
Other models widely used are based on the decrease of initial exchangeable acid￾ity determined at the initial soil pH. The classical Kamprath model recommends a 
liming rate on an equivalent basis from 1.5 to 2 the initial exchangeable acidity 
depending on the sensitivity of crops to acidity. The Cochrane model recommends 
liming rates from 1.5 to 2 times the decrease in exchangeable acidity (fxing a target 
saturation acidity). When the target is to reduce Al toxicity, these methods based on 
exchangeable acidity can be reasonably accurate. Other methods are based on a 
target soil pH, which needs to estimate soil buffer capacity with slow titrations and 
should be developed specifcally for similar soils of the same geographical region. 
Since the main risk associated to low pH in tropical soils is Al toxicity, other models 
for estimating liming requirement are based on the exchangeable Al in soils. 
However, this approach may underestimate lime requirements when Al toxicity is 
the only objective but the most yield-limiting issue is soil acidity.
Besides the natural origin mentioned, leaching and management factors can lead 
to acidifcation of agricultural soils (see Chaps. 2 and 26). Thus, in soils where there 
is a trend toward acidifcation, these factors should be counterbalanced to avoid a 
decrease in pH and base saturation.
Example 30.6
Extractable bases in a soil with a pH of 5.2 are (cmol+/kg): Ca 4, Mg 1.5, K 
0.3, and Na 0.2; CEC determined by the ammonium buffered method at pH 7 
is 15 cmol+/kg. Bulk density is 1.4 t/m3
. Calculate the amount of limestone 
with a richness of 90% in calcium carbonate necessary for reclaiming the soil 
down to 20 cm. The equivalent mass (EM) of calcium carbonate is 50.
We may assume a target PBS = 70%. For this target, fL  =  1.2 may be 
assumed.
Current PBS = (4 + 1.5 + 0.3 + 0.2)/15 = 40%.

30.8 Regenerative Agriculture
Regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming that focuses on maintaining or 
regenerating the soil functions to provide and support multiple services, including 
food production and other ecosystem services. The scientifc bases are the princi￾ples of soil conservation and reclamation, and the strategies to attain soil quality are 
increasing SOM and biodiversity, improving soil health, and restoring physical and 
chemical soil properties where they have been degraded. In recent years, an agro￾ecosystem approach has been added by including a social and economic dimension 
for sustainable food production.
It is complicated to benchmark the ideal environmental performance of an agri￾cultural system, as the human modifcation of ecosystems to produce food or other 
products always impairs its natural conditions. Nevertheless, properly designing 
and managing agricultural systems can keep a sustainable productivity level while 
providing other environmental services. For instance, soil erosion can be boosted 
with cultivation compared to a natural system if farming is performed under geo￾morphological and environmental conditions that favor erodibility. Nevertheless, 
soil conservation strategies can greatly mitigate erosion and regenerate soil func￾tionality. On the same line, strategies to mitigate the biodiversity loss associated 
with cultivation, such as crop rotations, intercropping, or alley cropping, greatly 
enhance belowground diversity and can make a big difference in the agroecosystem 
sustainability.
An example of regenerative agriculture is the recovery of soil functionality in 
irrigated land by the introduction of cover crops. Irrigation in semiarid areas 
increases and stabilizes productivity, but it also enhances rapid SOM mineralization 
that can lead to soil structure degradation and to increased erosion and nutrient 
losses. In the Mediterranean region, it is common to fnd soils with low SOM that 
have become degraded due to intensive arable cropping and low biomass returns. 
That was the case of a farm in Aranjuez (Central Spain) where reduced tillage 
improved the soil quality. An additional improvement was attained by replacing the 
traditional winter fallow with cover crops. Cover cropping enhanced C and N 
sequestration, soil aggregate stability, and water infltration (Fig. 30.7), leading to 
less dependence on mineral fertilizers and mitigating nitrate leaching. The main 
reasons for the improvement were the additional biomass incorporated into the sys￾tems and the root effect of the cover crops. Restoration of soil functionality is a low 
process, but, in this case, improvements were already attained 4 years after intro￾ducing barley as a cover crop.
Aboveground diversifcation and belowground diversifcation are crucial strate￾gies of regenerative agriculture and are usually associated with an increase in bio￾mass productivity and organic matter addition to the soil. In the farm in Aranjuez, 
the introduction of cover crops enhanced the diversifcation of soil microorganisms, 
particularly observed in an increase in mycorrhiza activity and hyphae length. 
Interseeding the cover crops in the cash crops at the end of spring allowed increas￾ing diversity in the annual rotations and enhanced biomass production and soil pro￾tection (Fig.  30.8). Further, the early interseeding opens the opportunity for

terminating the cover crop in late fall and sowing a winter cash crop that could 
beneft from the N released during the mineralization of cover crop residues. In 
addition, cover crops could be integrated into crop-livestock systems, if grazed by 
sheep or cattle during the fall/winter period, enhancing diversifcation in the 
Mediterranean inland. Transition to more diversifed farming systems is 
30 Soil Improvement and Reclamation480
challenging, and there is not a unique recipe, but incorporating scientifc knowledge 
into local practices following the principles of regenerative agriculture is a solid 
foundation for success.

Abstract
Windbreaks are structures that reduce wind speed and may affect turbulence in 
the protected zone. The maximum effciency is obtained with windbreaks of 
medium porosity that reduce wind speed up to a distance 20–25 times their 
height. Windbreaks promote larger temperature oscillations, which may increase 
frost risk and dew deposition.
Soil temperature can be modifed by changing its exposure to radiation, artif￾cial heating, or mulching. Mulches can be natural (e.g., crop residues) or artif￾cial, most notably plastic flms. The crop canopy may be cooled down with 
sprinkler irrigation when VPD is high. Additional environmental control may be 
performed with row covers and greenhouses that create a warmer wind-protected 
environment and are increasingly popular in horticultural production.

31.1 Introduction
There are limited possibilities for modifying the aerial environment of crops grown 
outdoors. In this chapter, we discuss these possibilities starting with protecting 
crops from wind and then proceeding with environmental manipulations to modify 
soil and crop temperatures.
The main factor that can be manipulated is wind which may be modifed by plac￾ing physical structures (inert or living) on the edges of felds. The structures may 
form walls, called windbreaks, whose main objective is to reduce wind speed. The 
term shelterbelt refers to several rows of trees and shrubs. The structures may be 
scattered isolated trees which affect wind fow in the area and also have a protective 
effect by intercepting rainfall. This association of crops and protective trees is 
termed agroforestry. In such systems, the trees may yield timber and/or fruit which 
directly contribute to farm income, besides protecting the crops.
Planting windbreaks has been a common practice in agricultural systems of 
regions with strong winds. An example would be the protective windbreaks against 
the mistral wind in the Rhone Valley in southern France. In the Great Plains of the 
United States, windbreaks appeared in the 1930s to protect the soil from wind ero￾sion after a long drought (Dust Bowl). Today, they are used only in regions where 
wind poses substantial risks to agricultural production. Because they use valuable 
land, windbreaks are mostly used in horticulture (fruit tree production).
In contrast to their benefcial protective effects, windbreaks also have negative 
effects. First, they occupy part of the arable land and shade the cropped areas close 
to the windbreaks. If they are living structures, they may compete for water and 
nutrients and serve as shelter for some pests. Despite these drawbacks, most studies 
have shown an overall positive effect of windbreaks on crop yields in windy areas.
31.2 Effects of Wind on Crops
The effects of wind on crops and soils are diverse:
– Growth: Plant movement due to wind can reduce crop growth rate and increase 
plant’s mechanical resistance (shorter and thicker stems, increased root/shoot 
ratio). This phenomenon, thigmomorphogenesis, does not require a continuous 
stimulus but may be triggered by infrequent movements.
– Mechanical damage: The wind’s force can tear leaves or strip them from the 
plant. In dense canopies, abrasion may result from the rubbing of plant leaves 
and stems. Mechanical damage may be caused by the impact of soil particles 
carried by wind.
– Crop lodging: This is caused by strong winds after wetting the canopy by rainfall 
or irrigation, which increases the load on the plant and the bending moment and 
decreases the stability of the root plate. The result is that the stems bend or break 
at some point near the ground surface and the crop lays on the ground (see 31.3).
F. J. Villalobos et al.483
– Crop evaporation is proportional to wind speed when crops are well watered. 
Therefore, crop ET is reduced in protected areas.
– Dry and hot winds may cause grain shriveling in cereals during grain flling.
– Salinization in coastal areas may occur due to wind drift from the sea.
– Wind affects the variation of surface temperature. Therefore, the risk of frost 
may increase in protected areas (see Chap. 32).
31.3 Wind Forces on Plants, Lodging, and Windthrow
A body immersed in a fow of air is subjected to numerous forces. The total drag on 
the body is the sum of two forces in the direction of the fow: (i) friction drag, 
caused by air viscosity and resulting in momentum transfer through the boundary 
layer, and (ii) form drag, caused by the deceleration of the fuid and dependent on 
the body shape and orientation. These forces increase with the square of the veloc￾ity. The calculation of total drag force requires an empirical coeffcient, known as 
the drag coeffcient, which contains not only the complex dependencies of object 
shape and orientation but also the effects of air viscosity and compressibility. 
The latter effect, however, is negligible for naturally occurring wind speeds.
Plants are composed of multiple surfaces and are fexible. Streamlining of plant 
parts affects total drag, so the drag coeffcient decreases with wind speed. Higher 
turbulence increases momentum transfer, thus increasing drag on plants. In wind 
tunnel experiments, turbulence is typically low so laminar fow, and thus smaller 
drag, is expected.
High wind speeds may exert disruptive forces on isolated plants or their popula￾tions. Lodging of crops is the permanent displacement of some plants from their 
vertical position, which is responsible for yield losses, increased harvest costs, and 
quality deterioration. Stem lodging occurs when the lower section of the stem 
breaks or bends, and root lodging occurs by either rupture of the roots that support 
the plants or fracture or turn of the piece of soil around the base of the stem 
(root plate).
Rice (Tani, 1963; Bulletin of the National Institute of Agricultural Science, 
Tokyo A 10, 99), in laboratory experiments, measured a critical turning moment for 
stem lodging of 0.2 N m on the base of the stems. However, the moment was only 
0.057 N m (i.e., 29%) in the feld. The difference is related to feld experiments 
(i) not accounting for the actual wind speed during gusts, and/or (ii) having 
resonance due to periods of oscillation of plants and eddies at the top of the canopy, 
and/or (iii) having sanitary or nutritional problems.
Ennos (1991. J. Exp. Bot. 42:1607–1613), in laboratory experiments with bread 
wheat, determined that the critical turning moments was about 0.2 N m, the same 
value found by Tani. Moreover, he concluded that roots would fail before stems 
would bend due to the 30% lower anchorage resistance of the roots compared with 
the resistance of the stems. The value of this fnding is restricted to the mechanical 
properties of the soil used.
31 Manipulating the Crop Environment484
The reasoning for the windthrow of forest trees is similar to the lodging of plants 
in feld crops. Some models have been constructed to predict these events (Baker 
et al., 1998; Berry et al., 2003), but their practical application is limited due to the 
system complexities. For example, the profle of wind speed inside the canopy is not 
uniform and is infuenced by population density and the shape of the crowns. 
Turbulence description is even more challenging and is critical to determine the 
actual critical values of wind speed for lodging or windthrow.
Lodging of cereals may be reduced by:
– Increasing the strength of the stem base and anchorage system.
– Reducing N availability, especially in the spring.
– Lower planting density.
– Delayed sowing dates.
Soil mechanical properties and soil moisture affect soil shear strength and resis￾tance to anchorage failure. Increases in clay content and compaction increase shear 
strength, while higher soil water content tends to reduce it.
31.4 Windbreaks
Windbreaks are structures established to reduce wind speed and change its direc￾tion. Hedges may be formed by plants (shrubs, trees, or annuals) or inert structures 
(hurdles, plastic mesh enclosure walls, etc.). Apart from reducing wind speed, plant 
windbreaks generate additional benefts such as providing shelter for wildlife, pro￾tecting the livestock from weather elements, and acting as a barrier for sound and 
smell. In addition, some agricultural operations are improved in protected areas like 
reduced pesticide drift and higher uniformity of sprinkler irrigation or pesticide 
spray application. A better environment for farmworkers is also created. In some 
areas, environmental authorities promote windbreaks with incentives to farmers to 
increase biodiversity and enrich the landscape. The increase in biodiversity (espe￾cially animals) is often benefcial as birds and insects often prey on pests helping to 
reduce their impact. In some cases, however, windbreaks may host pests, maintain￾ing population stocks that will feed on the crops once they are established. The 
species composition of windbreaks should then be chosen following an ecological 
rationale in addition to the aerodynamic considerations addressed below.
Field windbreaks may be single rows of trees or shrubs or multiple-row shel￾terbelts. The latter provide better conditions for wildlife and may be formed by 
four to fve rows of alternating trees and shrubs. Taller species should be placed 
in the center of the belt with shorter species on each side. Deciduous trees lose 
their protective capacity during winter. Tall annual crops may be used to protect 
shorter crops.
F. J. Villalobos et al.485
31.5 Wind and Turbulence in the Sheltered Zone
Windbreak structure—height, density, number of rows, species composition, length, 
orientation, and continuity—determines the effectiveness of a windbreak in reduc￾ing wind speed and altering the microclimate.
The effectiveness of the windbreak depends mainly on its width, height, and 
porosity. Effectiveness is measured as the distance downwind, expressed as the 
number of shelter heights, through which the wind speed is reduced relative to that 
in the open.
On the windward side of a windbreak, wind speed is reduced upwind for a dis￾tance of two to fve times the height of the windbreak (2H to 5H). On the leeward 
side, wind speed may be reduced up to 30H downwind of the barrier (Fig. 31.1).
Windbreak porosity is the ratio of the open fraction of the barrier to its total vol￾ume. Wind fows through the open portions of a windbreak; thus, the less porous a 
windbreak, the less wind passes through. Low pressure develops on the leeward side 
of very dense windbreaks, which pulls down air going over the barrier, generating 
additional turbulence and reducing protection downwind. As porosity increases, so 
does the fow passing through the barrier; thus, turbulence is not enhanced, and the 
effectiveness increases, although the magnitude of wind speed reductions is not 
as great.

windward and leeward sides, respectively. The porosity is 70–75% for deciduous and 50–60% for 
conifers
31 Manipulating the Crop Environment486
Dense windbreaks (porosity below 25%) show effectiveness (Ew) of 10–15H. With 
permeability around 50%, the effectiveness increases to 20–25H (Fig. 31.1), with￾out adding large-scale turbulence. These values of effectiveness vary however with 
other factors such as wind speed (Ew is proportional to wind speed), atmospheric 
stability (Ew is larger in unstable conditions), and wind direction (Ew is maximum 
when wind direction is normal to the barrier). Even when the wind blows parallel to 
the barriers, some effect on wind speed is observed. Windbreaks with intermediate 
porosity (40–60%) are usually the most effective.
31.6 Establishment and Maintenance of Windbreaks
Trees or shrubs to form windbreaks should grow rapidly and have strong erect stems 
able to withstand wind forces and a well-anchored root system. They should also be 
able to survive under the prevailing biotic stresses of the area (drought, cold). 
Among plant windbreaks, the most common species are conifers such as cypress 
(Cupressus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), and pine (Pinus spp.). Other trees used are 
poplars (Populus spp.) and Eucalyptus spp. Each species and, within species, each 
variety have characteristics of adaptation to the environment that determine the 
most appropriate. There are also differences between species and varieties regarding 
competition with the crop, which come mainly from root systems that may be shal￾low or able to explore deep soil horizons.
The orientation of windbreaks depends on the design objectives. Farmsteads and 
feedlots usually need protection from cold winds and blowing snow during winter. 
Field crops and fruit trees usually need protection from hot, dry summer winds, or 
wind-blown soil particles, especially during critical growing periods. Windbreaks 
for soil erosion control should be normal to the prevailing winds when the soil is 
bare (winter and early spring).
Despite predominant wind directions during given periods, wind direction may 
vary from day to day or during the day, so the level of protection by the windbreak 
may be reduced. A set of multiple windbreaks forming parallel lines spaced 10–15H 
provides a larger protected area than a single windbreak. If protection from several 
wind directions is required, another set of parallel lines, normal to the frst, should 
be established, resulting in a rectangular arrangement of protected felds.
Gaps in the windbreak may be needed to allow access to the felds. The uninter￾rupted length of a windbreak should exceed the height by at least 10:1. This is 
because gaps in a barrier become funnels that concentrate wind fow, leading to 
wind speeds in the protected area that may even exceed those in the open.
The plantation of a windbreak follows the same rules as other plantations 
although the distance between trees may be smaller (e.g., 3 m between rows, 2 m 
between trees in the row) and high survival and rapid growth are critical. Lost trees 
should be replaced as soon as possible. Supplemental irrigation during dry periods, 
protection against browsing by animals (by planting thorny plants or putting a 
barbed wire fence), and weed control are critical, particularly during the early years 
of the plantation.
F. J. Villalobos et al.487
As the trees grow, some pruning may be required to keep the required porosity, 
promote vertical growth, and eliminate branches damaged by wind or pests. Tree 
thinning may be required to enhance trunk diameter growth.
31.7 Microclimate Changes in the Protected Area
Solar radiation is reduced signifcantly in the area shaded by windbreaks. The effect 
is almost nil for distances beyond 1–2H. The effect is marginal for north- to south￾oriented barriers as the shaded area is very small around noon when radiation is at 
its maximum. Further reduction by shading may occur early in the morning or late 
afternoon but is partly compensated by the refection of radiation from the wind￾break. The largest effect on radiation occurs in east- to west-oriented barriers, on the 
area to the north (in the North Hemisphere) of the windbreak, in special for high 
latitudes and winter periods.
The reduction of wind speed, and thus, in turbulence in the protected areas has 
several effects:
(a) Temperature: During the day, it favors soil heating (Chap. 6), which usually 
leads to warmer soil surface and air above. During the night, strong temperature 
inversions will develop leading possibly to lower minimum temperatures. This 
explains the increased frost risk in protected areas.
(b) Vapor pressure: It tends to increase close to the canopy during the day, when 
plants are transpiring, as mixing is reduced, particularly on calm days. At night, 
the higher vapor pressure and the lower temperature enhance dew deposition in 
protected areas. The combination of higher vapor pressure or plants wet by dew 
with higher temperatures may increase the incidence of aerial diseases.
(c) ET: For well-watered crops, reduced wind speed means higher aerodynamic 
resistance (Chaps. 4 and 9) and, therefore, reduced ET. This effect may be off￾set partly by lower canopy resistance in some species. However, the improved 
environment in the protected area may increase crop growth and hasten soil 
water depletion. In rainfed crops subjected to water stress late in the growing 
cycle, the overall effect may be a reduction in the Harvest Index in protected 
areas. However, well-watered crops show the same or higher yield with reduced 
ET, which means a higher Water Use Effciency.
(d) Chill factor: Heat losses of livestock, wildlife, and structures (farmsteads, 
greenhouses, etc.) due to windchill are reduced on the leeward side of a 
windbreak.
31.8 Scattered Windbreaks
The presence of scattered trees in the feld reduces the average wind speed because 
of higher aerodynamic roughness. The reduction will be proportional to the fraction 
of the area covered by trees. The main difference between scattered trees and 
31 Manipulating the Crop Environment488
regular rows is the degree of interaction (including competition) between trees and 
crops which is higher when trees are scattered. In this case, the tree also protects 
crops and soil from direct rainfall impacts. The negative effects are:
– Increased competition for light (isolated trees intercept more radiation), water, 
and nutrients with the crop.
– Additional diffculties for cultural operations as trees become obstacles for the 
machinery.
– Higher cost of establishing isolated trees, especially when young trees have to be 
protected against wildlife or farm animals.
31.9 The Importance of Soil, Air, and Crop Temperatures
Soil and air temperatures infuence numerous critical processes of the crop. Seed 
germination and plant emergence are extremely sensitive to the temperature of the 
soil. The time from sowing to emergence increases and seedling growth is slower 
when the soil is cold. Canopy temperature has an important effect on critical plant 
processes (development, growth, assimilation) and thus on crop productivity.
The root distribution is also affected by soil temperature. In some species, root 
growth is restricted to the upper layers when the soil is too cold, while a much 
deeper root distribution is observed at higher temperatures, which improves water 
and nutrient uptake. Other processes that respond to soil temperature are symbiotic 
nitrogen fxation, photosynthesis, water fow in the soil-plant system (water viscos￾ity is high at low temperatures), organic matter mineralization, and soil 
respiration.
In summary, soil and air temperatures have varied effects on crops and their con￾trol may increase yields. Therefore, artifcial soil and/or air heating is sometimes 
used in high-value crops. The alternatives for crops outdoors are limited but some 
may be very effective for manipulating soil temperature.
31.10 Slope and Aspect
The irradiance on a given surface increases as the incidence angle of solar rays 
decreases and is maximal when the radiation vector is normal to the surface. The 
effect of slope and orientation (aspect) of the surface will be proportional to the 
fraction of beam (direct) radiation reaching the surface, which lies between 0 
(cloudy sky) and 0.85 (clear atmosphere with zero zenith angle). The slope and 
aspect of a plot are less important when the solar zenith angle is high or low, 
although for different reasons. The fraction of direct radiation decreases as the 
zenith angle increases due to the longer path of the atmosphere that sun rays cross 
to reach the Earth. Therefore, the slope and aspect of a surface will barely affect 
irradiance in high latitudes. On the other hand, the zenith angle is so small at low 
latitudes that orientation has little effect on irradiance. The same reasoning may be

less important in summer (low zenith angle) and winter (high fraction of diffuse 
radiation).
Figure 31.2 shows the temperature in different positions of a feld with furrows 
in the north to south direction. The temperature at the furrow is lower than on the 
ridge. On the sloping sides, the temperature is typically higher than on the ridge, 
with the side facing east warmer in the morning and the side facing west warmer in 
the afternoon.
North-facing and south-facing slopes are colder and warmer, respectively, in the 
Northern Hemisphere.
31.11 Mulching
A mulch is a layer of material covering the soil and acting as a barrier to heat or 
water transport. Additional functions of mulches include soil protection against ero￾sion and weed control. Some common mulches are weed residues, straw and other 
crop residues, inorganic mulches (plastic flms, gravel, sand), and industrial by￾products (bark, wood chips, etc.).
The effect of mulching on soil temperature is evaluated by considering frst the 
possible change in net radiation. Black plastic will increase net radiation (reduced 
albedo) while straw will reduce it (high albedo). The second aspect to be considered

is water transport. Mulches may reduce water fow or even suppress it (plastic 
flms). Therefore, more energy will be available for heating the air (straw) or the air 
and the soil. A transparent plastic will enhance soil heating much more than a black 
plastic (Fig. 31.3). The latter absorbs radiation but transmits and refects little, so the 
black plastic is heated and may reach high temperatures. However, the air layer 
between the plastic and the soil surface limits heat conduction to the soil. The trans￾parent plastic transmits most short-wave radiation but also long-wave radiation. 
Therefore, during the night, the soil under transparent plastic cools down like the 
control (bare soil) while the black plastic keeps the soil warmer due to the low long￾wave transmissivity. Straw transmits little radiation, which reduces soil warming 
during the day and cooling at night.
Transparent plastic flms are used widely in horticultural crops during the spring 
to increase soil temperature and, thus, speed up crop development for early produc￾tion and reduce season length. Earlier harvest leads to better prices in many horti￾cultural crops. In addition to the effect on temperature, soil water is conserved in the 
upper soil layer, which prevents the appearance of a surface crust and improves the 
conditions for germination, emergence, and early seedling growth.
Black plastic is often used in vegetable crops, but the main objective is weed 
control. Many weed seeds will remain dormant in the dark and those that do germi￾nate will die soon due to lack of carbohydrates. Another advantage of a plastic cover 
(valid also for transparent flms) is preventing the contact of fruits with the soil, thus 
avoiding diseases.

Most mulches, and especially those of organic origin (straw, crop residues, cover 
crops) act as insulators, i.e., they damp the soil temperature waves and therefore will 
keep the soil cooler when applied in spring (Fig. 31.4) or warmer if applied in the 
summer. Mulched spring sown crops (e.g., direct sowing with residues) will thus 
show a slower development. The effect on the water balance depends on rainfall 
distribution: Frequent and light rains will wet the mulch and most water will evapo￾rate directly from it. Heavier and isolated rainfalls will infltrate better in mulched 
soil and soil evaporation will be reduced.
Inorganic mulches like sand or gravel have excellent properties as they do not 
reduce soil heating but are very effective in reducing soil evaporation and increasing 
infltration.
31.12 Artificial Soil Heating
In some situations (nurseries, sports stadiums, high-value horticulture), the soil may 
be heated using electrical cables or pipes with hot water. The cost may be reduced 
when hot water is available as a by-product from cooling operations in industry or 
power plants.
31 Manipulating the Crop Environment492
31.13 Modifying Canopy Temperature
Windbreaks increase temperature oscillations in the protected area (see 31.5). An 
alternative for reducing canopy temperature of crops in the open is wetting the 
plants. A group of US researchers proposed using frequent irrigation to keep the 
canopy wet and thus bring canopy temperature closer to its optimum to increase 
productivity. The idea was abandoned because of the excessive water use, the higher 
risk of aerial diseases, and the reduction in crop nutrient uptake.
We can apply Eq. 21.3 to evaluate the difference between the canopy and air 
temperature, Tc−Ta, for different values of canopy resistance. The difference in can￾opy temperature between a dry and a wet (rc = 0) canopy is:

The cooling due to wetting the canopy is proportional to radiation, VPD, and

31.14 Greenhouses
The highest level of control of the aerial environment of plants is achieved in growth 
cabinets and growth chambers which are only used in research and breeding pro￾grams due to their high cost. The lowest level corresponds to windbreaks.
A second step in environmental control is achieved with mulches and row covers, 
i.e., pieces of clear plastic stretched over low hoops enclosing the rows of plants. 
Floating row covers are those supported by the plant itself. Shading nets and other 
covers are used in fruit trees as protection against hail and insects and to improve 
fruit quality. Nets of different colors that alter the light spectrum may improve cer￾tain fruit quality traits and disrupt insect fights.
The third level of aerial control of the crop environment is that of greenhouses 
which are structures covered with a transparent material. A wide range of designs 
differing in cost, level of control, and frame and cover materials is available. The 
simplest case is the plastic unheated greenhouse for horticulture production in mild￾winter areas (e.g., Almeria in Southern Spain). The most sophisticated designs are 
metallic structures with glass or rigid plastic panels with artifcial heating, supple￾mentary lighting, and CO2 fertilization (e.g., the greenhouse industry of the 
Netherlands). Greenhouse horticulture is increasingly using hydroponics instead of 
natural soils, a technology where plants are grown with or without mechanical sup￾port on an artifcial medium (sand, gravel, rock wool, peat moss, etc.) and watered 
with a nutrient solution that is recycled through the system.
Glazing materials for greenhouses may be plastic flms (e.g., polyethylene, PE), 
rigid plastic panels (e.g., polycarbonate), or glass. Glazing materials show high 
transmittance for PAR (above 80%), but they may be transparent to infrared (IR) like 
PE or not (PE with specifc additives, glass, or any material covered by condensa￾tion). In the former case (IR transparent), radiative cooling at night is almost the 
same as in the open. This may be mitigated by using IR opaque curtains. During the 
day, the problem may be the opposite due to excessive heating of the air and plants

inside the greenhouse during late spring or summer. In that case, it is possible to use 
shade cloth or whitewash to reduce irradiance and increase ventilation or use cool￾ing systems.
In Sect. 10.6, we saw that evaporation inside unheated plastic greenhouses 
approaches equilibrium evaporation, i.e., it is mostly related to radiation inside the 
greenhouse. In this case, it is easy to deduce the sensible heat fux inside as the dif￾ference between net radiation and evaporation. This sensible heat fux will equal 
heat transport between the air inside and outside. For a given relative renovation rate 
(RR, h−1
) and mean greenhouse height (hg, m), we can calculate the differences in 
temperature between the inside and the outside air as:

where γ is the psychrometric constant (0.067 kPa K−1
), Δ is the slope of the satura￾tion vapor pressure function versus temperature (kPa K−1
; see Eq. 10.4), ρ is air 
density, Cp is specifc heat of air at constant pressure (see 5.9), kRN is the ratio net 
radiation/solar radiation inside the greenhouse, which may be taken as 0.7, and Rsi
is solar radiation inside the greenhouse (W m−2
). The coeffcient kL represents the 
fraction of evaporation as compared to equilibrium evaporation. For instance, if 
75% of the greenhouse area is covered by well-watered vegetation, then kL = 0.75 
and CT varies from 1.16 at 10 °C to 0.85 at 30 °C.
This simple model is only a frst approximation to characterize the micrometeo￾rology of greenhouses as it ignores other processes that contribute to heat exchange 
(e.g., conduction through the cover) but is useful to illustrate the possibilities of 
climatic control in unheated greenhouses, namely, changing the radiation inside by 
putting shade cloth or whitewash painting on the cover or by manipulating ventila￾tion via opening/closing vents or using fans. Apart from keeping the temperature

. On June 21, solar declination is 23.45°, so the 
maximum solar radiation outside at noon on a clear day is 507 W m−2
 (Chap. 
3). The cover is polyethylene with a transmissivity of 0.7, so the estimated 
radiation inside is 355 W m−2
. The temperature outside is 20 °C and kL is 0.75 
so we can deduce CT = 0.99. Therefore, the expected increase in temperature

within the optimal range for plant growth, ventilation is needed to prevent excessive 
air humidity inside the greenhouse as it favors fungal diseases. This is especially 
important at night when temperature approaches the dew point temperature so con￾densation occurs on plants and the inner surface of the cover.

Abstract
Frosts affect agricultural production reducing yields and/or product quality. The 
best strategy to avoid frost damage is to use passive (preventive) methods, which 
imply a good choice of species, cultivars, planting dates, and locations, keeping 
the soil compacted, wet, and smooth, among other options. This requires the 
knowledge of the frequency distributions of minimum temperatures and the eval￾uation of the effect of low temperatures on crop performance (i.e., critical dam￾age temperatures). However, the mechanisms of frost damage are rather complex 
and depend partly on plant hardiness, so damage predictions are very uncertain. 
When frost occurs, active (protective) methods minimize the damage by reduc￾ing longwave radiation loss (e.g., plastic covers), direct heating by burning fuel, 
air mixing (e.g., wind machines), and overhead irrigation for releasing the heat 
of fusion.

32.1 Introduction
A frost is the occurrence of air temperature equal or lower than 0 °C at a height 
between 1.25 and 2 m, measured in an appropriate shelter. Most agricultural sys￾tems of temperate climates are affected by frost. The limitation to crop production 
due to frost is usually characterized by the mean frost-free period, which is the time 
from the last spring frost to the frst in the fall. This period limits the season length 
of many species, which determines whether the crop may be grown successfully.
The frost risk increases as we move away from the equator, with a band between 
the two tropics where frost does not occur (except at high elevations). Areas with 
frost-free periods over 240 days are between 12 and 40° latitude and include the 
most important agricultural regions. In these regions, frost damage is often pre￾vented on fruit and horticultural crops. Areas with frost-free periods of 180–240 days 
extend to 50°, although they may be found in higher latitudes due to the sea infu￾ence. When the frost-free period is less than 90 days, agriculture is limited and most 
food crops cannot be grown.
Frost is the weather hazard responsible for the greatest crop losses in the United 
States and, probably, the world. Among frost protection methods, the most useful 
are preventive, such as choosing the right species/cultivar and sowing date. Protective 
methods implemented in the night of frost are affordable only in high-value crops in 
horticulture and fruit production.
32.2 Effects of Frost on Crop Production
Frost damage depends on many factors such as the species, the cultivar, the degree 
of acclimation, the state of the plant tissues (which depends on the stage of develop￾ment and irrigation and fertilization practices, among other factors), the height of 
the canopy, the type of pruning, the rate of temperature decrease, the duration of the 
frost, and the minimum temperature achieved. This complexity makes it diffcult to 
predict frost damage. An additional problem is that the minimum temperature 
recorded at weather stations (according to standard rules) is not the same as the 
canopy temperature in a given feld nearby (see 32.3).
The resistance of crops to cold is evaluated according to the lowest average mini￾mum temperature at which they can survive. In tropical areas, plants are generally 
tender, and damage may result from exposure to low temperatures above the freez￾ing point (chilling injury), sometimes as high as 12 °C. This is a problem in horti￾cultural plants when unseasonal weather causes damage to chilling-sensitive species 
(most crops of tropical origin). As with frost, many physiological and environmen￾tal factors affect the magnitude of the injury; for instance, immature fruits are more 
sensitive than mature fruits. Contrary to frost, chilling injury symptoms may be 
reversed, at least partially, if exposure to low temperatures is brief.
Frost damage in plants occurs below 0 °C, at temperatures ranging from about 
−1 °C down to −196 °C. This offset is explained by two mechanisms: avoidance 
and/or tolerance of freezing. Plants avoid intercellular freezing either because the 
J. P. De Melo-Abreu et al.499
solutes outside the protoplast lower the freezing point of these aqueous solutions or 
because there is supercooling (the temperature of the liquid drops below its freezing 
point without becoming solid), due to the absence of freezing nuclei. Tolerance 
happens when, despite intercellular freezing and the resulting shrinking and 
dehydration of the protoplast, there is full recovery of the protoplast structure and 
function after thawing. Intracellular freezing, if it ever occurs under natural crop 
growing conditions, is always lethal for the cell. Freezing occurs in the intercellular 
spaces due to the lower concentration of solutes outside than inside the protoplasts. 
The decrease in water potential due to freezing and solute concentration induces 
loss of water by the protoplast, resulting in its shrinkage and the increase in its 
solute concentration.
In general, tissues are injured either by direct mechanical injury inficted by the 
ice formed outside the cells or by the shrinkage and dehydration of the protoplast. 
In this case, denaturation of nuclear proteins may be the ultimate cause of injury.
Initially, critical damage temperature (Tcrit) was defned as the maximum tem￾perature that results in frost injury to a plant organ when exposed for more than 
30 minutes. The term has been extended to specifc levels of injury. For example, 
T10 for apple fowers refers to the Tcrit that inficts 10% loss of the total fowers, and 
T90 would correspond to 90% loss.
Cereals and fruit trees not of tropical origin show very low Tcrit during winter rest. 
However, after bud burst, critical temperatures slowly approach their upper limit. 
During active growth, most plant organs have Tcrit only a few degrees below 
0 °C. Moreover, the difference T90-T10 tends to decrease as plant phenological devel￾opment progresses attaining a minimum that occurs, usually, around grain/fruit set 
(see Fig. 32.1). During the rest period and onset of growth, plants have a consider￾able capacity to keep low (or actively lower) Tcrit, in response to the continued 
occurrence of low temperatures, in a process called hardening or acclimation. From 
fowering onward, hardening capacity is inexistent or reduced. On the other hand, 
after exposure to high temperatures, de-hardening may occur.
The nature of freeze damage varies with the plant/organ affected. Most injured 
vegetables present either a “burned” appearance or seem “soggy” or present changes 
in color or texture. Under rigorous winters, when the protective snow cover is insuf￾fcient, winter cereals may get leaf injury or even tillering node injury. After emer￾gence, frost damage occurs usually at fowering or grain set. In temperate climates, 
deciduous fruit trees and grapevine are rarely affected by winter frosts. Only when 
temperatures are very low, in some extreme environments or when there is substan￾tial de-hardening, there is frost damage to dormant buds or, even more rarely, to tree 
trunks. Flowers and small fruits of deciduous species are very tender and sensitive 
to frost. Sometimes, there is only a partial loss of seeds after pollination, which 
affects the growth of the fruits, particularly stone fruits, which have one or two 
seeds per fruit. When a small fruit experiences light freeze injury, a coarse russet 
tissue grows and covers a portion of the fruit, deteriorating fruit quality.
A detailed list of critical temperatures may be found in the review by Snyder and 
De Melo-Abreu (2005). Most vegetables and fruits have maximum freezing tem￾peratures between −0.4 °C and − 2.7 °C, which represent the upper limit of critical

supercooling may result in actual freezing temperatures that are somewhat lower. 
More juicy tissues tend to have higher critical temperatures.
A series of crops of tropical origin (tobacco, tomato, cucumber, peanut, rice, 
melon, and cotton) present Tcrit, for the crop cycle, which decreases from 0 °C to 
−2 °C. Millet and corn have a Tcrit around −2 °C to −3 °C at germination and grain 
flling, and one degree higher around fowering.
Table 32.1 shows critical temperatures at different stages of small grains, fodder 
crops, sugar beet, and olives. Table 32.2 shows the critical temperatures of fruit trees 
and grapevine.
32.3 Minimum Canopy Temperature
Air temperature is routinely measured in weather stations with shielded sensors at 
standard height (e.g., 1.5 m). However, the actual canopy temperature (Tc) will dif￾fer from that value (Chap. 5). The main factors determining the difference between 
air temperature at the weather station (Taw) and Tc are net radiation, wind speed, air 
humidity, and aerodynamic roughness (Chap. 4). The calculation of this difference 
for the minimum temperature may be performed using a rather simple model as

during nighttime net radiation is only longwave, wind speed is low, and relative 
humidity is high. An example of model results is presented in Table 32.3 for crops 
with heights of 0.1 m (e.g., grass) and 1 m (e.g., cereal) when the air temperature is 
0 °C at the weather station and wind speed is low. The difference Taw-Tc is smaller 
for the taller crop when the sky is overcast and when humidity is high. In all cases, 
the canopy is colder than air at the weather station.
32.4 Frost Types
Radiation frosts occur on calm nights with a clear and dry atmosphere, which 
enhances longwave radiation losses (Chap. 3). The low wind speed determines a 
temperature inversion. Figure 32.2 shows an example of temperature profle changes 
during the night. When the wind blows, the temperature profle becomes more

uniform and the air temperature rises (Fig. 32.3). When the wind stops, the tempera￾ture drops again (Fig. 32.3).
Advection frosts occur as a result of large-scale transport of cold air masses. They 
occur on cloudy days or nights with moderate or strong wind coming in the wake of 
a cold front. Temperature inversions are not observed, at least in the frst phase of 
such events. Later, after the wind weakens, an inversion may develop if surface 
cooling conditions occur.
Hoar frost occurs when ice crystals appear on the crop by deposition of water 
vapor or freezing of dew. Both processes release heat and therefore delay freezing 
of crop tissues. If the amount of ice is large, the term white frost is used. When water 
vapor concentration in the air is very low (dew point below the minimum tempera￾ture), there is no dew to freeze and no possibility of deposition and the tissues are 
affected without prior formation of ice, causing necrosis of the tissues (“black 
frost”). White frost indicates that damage may occur, but black frost is the visualiza￾tion of the damage that has occurred.
32.5 Climatology of Frosts
The frost-free period is the time between the last frost (late winter or spring) and the 
date of the frst autumn frost. This period is highly variable from year to year, so it 
is of limited value to assess the risk of frost damage, which should be based on the 
frequency distribution of frost dates. The dates of the frst and the last frost are

1 and before December 1 are 97 and 80%, respectively.
Example 32.1 (continued)
32.6 Risk of Extreme Cold Temperatures
Historically, farming has been pushed toward the environmental limits where risks 
of extreme events are higher. Many agricultural decisions have to be based on the 
probability of damaging events that can kill the plants or reduce yield substantially, 
thus making farming unsustainable. For frost risk analysis, we distinguish the prob￾ability P(T < Tcrit) of temperature below a critical threshold in any year and the risk 
(R) which is the probability of the event occurring at least once over a design period 
(nd). For example, the design period nd is the expected duration of a tree orchard in 
32 Frost Protection506
years. Instead of risk, we may use certainty (C = 1 − R) which is the probability of 
the event not occurring over the design period. Assuming a Bernoulli distribution, 
the certainty (C) is related to the probability of having a temperature below Tcrit in 
any given year:
C P T T nd
= −  ( ) <  
 1 crit (32.4)
For example, if the probability of temperature below −10 °C in any given year 
is 0.003 (i.e., it happens 3 times in 1000 years), then the certainty for a 20-year 
project duration is 0.94, i.e., we are 94% certain that temperatures will never fall 
below −10 °C in 20 consecutive years.
The probability of an extreme event occurring in any given year should be calcu￾lated as the ratio of the observed extreme events over the years of record. As they 
are rare events, we would need a very long weather record (e.g., more than 
1000 years) which is never available. Instead, for limited data sets, we calculate 
the parameters of the underlying statistical distribution. Haan recommended the 
type I extreme value (Gumbel) probability distribution:


 

 

 
 crit  crit 1 exp exp

α
(32.5)
We need to know μ and σ, the average and standard deviation of the minimum 
temperatures recorded each year, respectively. The parameter β is the mode (most 
frequent value) of the distribution which is calculated as β = μ + 0.45 σ, while the 
other parameter α = σ/1.283.
From the equations above, we may deduce how to calculate the certainty:

Example 32.2
The annual minimum temperature in Jerez del Marquesado (Spain) has an 
average of −7.04  °C with standard deviation 3.02  °C (Example 32.1). 
Therefore, the parameters of the Gumbel distribution are α = σ/1.283 = 2.355 °C 
and β = μ + 0.45 σ = −5.68 °C. If we plan to establish an orchard during 
20 years and the critical temperature is −12 °C, the certainty will be:
C = −  − − ( ) −

This value is very low as it indicates that the risk of failure of our orchard 
is 75%. In the other location (Gibraleon), the certainty is 0.998 which indi￾cates a negligible risk for the orchard.

32.7 Frost Protection
Frost protection methods include those implemented before the frost night to avoid 
or minimize frost occurrence or damage (i.e., passive, indirect, or preventive), and 
methods implemented during the frost night (i.e., active, direct, protective). Often, 
the effect of passive methods, which are relatively cheap, adds up to the effect of the 
active methods. Therefore, passive methods should always be considered and, when 
suitable, implemented in conjunction with one or more active methods. A complete 
description of most existing methods and related computational tools is available in 
Snyder and De Melo-Abreu (2005). In Chap. 7, we saw that nocturnal cooling is 
proportional to longwave losses and depends on the thermal admittance (Eq. 7.2) 
which is the basis of some frost protection methods.
32.7.1 Passive Protection Methods
32.7.1.1 Site Selection
Section 7.4 described the physics of the cooling process in a specifc location 
ignoring the horizontal movement of air. As the air cools, its density increases, 
and will tend to fow to areas of lower density, typically downward to valleys and 
depressions. The degree of accumulation of cold air or ventilation depends on the 
topography, the wind speed, and the temperature gradients.
Frost-sensitive crops should not be placed in locations where cold air accumu￾lates due to orography (depressions) or artifcial obstacles (fences, windbreaks).
The presence of large bodies of water (lakes, sea) in the direction where cold 
winds come from can reduce the risk of frost due to heat exchange between water 
and air.
If possible, the most critical areas should be detected using maps of minimum 
temperatures which could be obtained using remote thermal infrared imagery. As a 
rule of thumb, radiation frosts are more likely in the places where fog is more 
frequent.
32.7.1.2 Selection of Species, Cultivars, and Cultural Techniques
Crop species differ in their sensitivity to cold and frost, and genetic variability may 
exist within each species. Taking into account the climatology of frosts in the loca￾tion and the critical temperatures for the crop alternatives to that location, we will 
choose the species and the cultivar to reduce the risk of frost damage.
Some cultural techniques may be benefcial when they explore the knowledge of 
the biometeorology of frost. In deciduous fruit trees, pruning is usually done in 
winter but, in  locations prone to severe frost, late pruning is advisable from the 
viewpoint of frost damage prevention, since plants are more sensitive just after 
pruning and the probability of severe frosts decreases as the spring approaches. 
In the same regard, pruning promotes bud burst; hence, late pruning exposes new 
growth to less frequent and severe frosts. Training and pruning techniques raise the 
height of tender organs to avoid lower colder air layers during temperature 
32 Frost Protection508
inversions. Delayed budbreak has been achieved in pome fruits by periodic over￾head irrigation in late winter that cools the buds and delays their development until 
past the frost period. Nitrogen fertilization and high water status tend to elevate the 
critical temperature. Hence, when there is a strong probability of frost in the upcom￾ing days, it is not wise to N-fertilize or irrigate (but see next section).
Some bacteria, called Ice Nucleating Active (INA), may act as freezing nuclei 
and initiate the freezing process. These bacteria are often on the cover crops and 
weeds in the orchard and their removal may help prevent frost damage.
32.7.1.3 Soil Management
Minimum surface temperature may be increased by increasing the thermal admit￾tance (irrigating, compacting the soil) or increasing the radiant energy reaching the 
soil during the daytime (avoid opaque mulches or cover crops). Daytime soil heat￾ing also depends on the partitioning between G and H (Chap. 6) so a smooth soil 
surface (high aerodynamic resistance) will improve soil heating compared to a 
rough soil surface. Therefore, tillage operations (reduce thermal admittance, 
increase surface roughness) are not desirable if frost is expected.
Irrigation increases soil thermal admittance, which reduces nocturnal cooling but 
also daytime heating as more energy is spent in evaporation from the soil surface 
(Chap. 6). The best situation would be wet soil covered with transparent plastic. If 
that is not possible, the best choice is irrigating some days in advance to let the 
upper soil layer dry and reduce soil evaporation while the rest of the profle is wet 
(high thermal admittance).
Soil heat fux is increased after removing cover crops or weeds in orchards. Their 
removal should be done with herbicides but not tillage which reduces bulk density 
and, thus, thermal admittance. Any tillage should be performed well before the sen￾sitive frost period for the soil to settle and the residues to decompose.
32.7.2 Active Protection Methods
32.7.2.1 Increasing Radiation Interception
Radiation frosts occur when longwave radiation loss is high (absence of clouds, low 
air humidity). Thermal radiation may be intercepted partly by spraying water. 
The droplet diameter should be similar to the wavelength of thermal radiation 
(8–12 microns).
Artifcial clouds of smoke produced by burning different materials (tires, wood, 
or fuel) have been used in the past but they are rarely used nowadays. The diameter 
of the smoke particles is too small to affect radiation absorption and any positive 
effect is due to the heat liberated by the combustion. Additionally, the energy cost is 
high, and the clouds easily drift away from the protected feld, may be hazardous to 
traffc, and are a source of pollution.
Some materials, which are almost opaque to longwave radiation (e.g., thermal 
blankets), may be used to cover high-value crops.
J. P. De Melo-Abreu et al.509
32.7.2.2 Air Mixing
Inverted temperature profles typical of nights with radiation frost may be homog￾enized by mixing air of different heights, thereby increasing the temperature at the 
canopy level. The effectiveness of air mixing will be proportional to the temperature 
gradient.
A good choice for air mixing is a conventional wind machine, which consists of 
a steel tower with a large rotating fan near the top. Fans, with blades of diameter 
between 3 and 6 m, are located about 10–11 m above ground and are oriented to 
blow at a slight downward angle (e.g., 7°) to improve mixing. Fans rotate around the 
tower at a frequency of one rotation per 4 or 5 min and propeller speeds are usually 
about 600 rpm. There are models of fans with two to four blades. The engine power 
should be about 20 kW per hectare. Hence, for a typical 4 or 5 ha of protection, the 
engine power should be about 80–100 kW.
The protection given by conventional wind machines is, under strong inversions, 
between 1.5 °C and 2.5 °C. Most of the benefcial effects result from air temperature 
increase at canopy level and the remaining comes from the reduction of the bound￾ary layer resistance, which brings the temperature of the exposed organs of the plant 
closer to air temperature.
Mobile models of wind machines that, typically, have engines with less power 
have reduced protection areas. Helicopters have been widely used and are effective, 
but their availability and economics must be considered under local conditions.
32.7.2.3 Heating the Air or the Canopy
The loss of energy from a crop during frost may be compensated by burning fuel 
(solid, liquid, or gas) in heaters, which transfer energy by thermal radiation and con￾vection. The energy loss from the crop is usually in the range of 20–40 W m−2
, while 
input from heaters is typically between 140 and 280 W m−2
, which indicates a very 
low effciency. The best conditions for this method are no wind and a strong inversion.
The temperature of the air leaving the heater is very high so it will rise rapidly, 
mixing with the colder surrounding air, until it reaches the height where the air has 
the same temperature. Eventually, the mixed air will cool, become denser, and 
descend, which creates a circulation pattern within the inversion layer. When there 
is a strong inversion (i.e., a low ceiling), the heated air rises to a lower height and 
the volume infuenced by the heaters is smaller so effciency is higher. Effciency is 
low when heaters are too big or hot as the warmed air can break through the top of 
the inversion layer.
32.7.2.4 Irrigation
Irrigation is very useful for protecting crops against frost and it relies mostly on the 
heat released by water cooling (4.18 10−3
 MJ/K/kg) and freezing (0.334 MJ/kg), but 
some heat may be spent in evaporation. Water extracted from wells has a tempera￾ture close to the mean annual air temperature at the site so the contribution of water 
cooling is small compared to that of freezing. This is the basis of using sprinkler 
32 Frost Protection510
irrigation for frost protection, which usually requires lower application rates (usu￾ally 2–4 mm h−1
) than typical sprinkler systems to meet crop ET.
Water has to be applied continuously to the whole area to be protected, so there 
is always a thin layer of water over the ice that is formed, thus keeping the tem￾perature at the freezing point (0 °C). Surface irrigation may also be used accord￾ing to the same principles (heat of fusion and specifc heat of water), but the heat 
is liberated to the air near the soil surface, and it may be insuffcient to prevent 
frost damage.
Classical full coverage systems should have a rotation cycle shorter than 1 min; 
around 30 s tends to be better. The application rate depends on canopy growth and 
arrangement, minimum temperature attained in the worst-case scenario, wind speed, 
and air humidity. We developed a simple equation to calculate the sprinkler applica￾tion rate (SA, mm h−1
) as a function of wind speed (u, m s−1
) and minimum air 
temperature (Ta,
o
C) (Snyder & De Melo-Abreu, 2005):
SA T u u u = − ( ) a ( ) − − − 1 447 0 0645 0 5788 0 4473 0 442 2 . . . . . (32.7)
This empirical model is valid for wind speeds in the 0.3–3 m s−1
 interval. If the 
application rate is adequate, sprinkler irrigation may provide up to 7 °C of frost 
protection.
Overplant sprinklers, which only irrigate the area of the soil covered by the 
plants, need a lower application rate that is obtained by multiplying the value 
obtained by Eq. (32.7) by the fraction of ground cover.
The major restrictions of sprinkler irrigation for frost protection are the amount 
of water required and the adverse consequences of waterlogging (Chap. 15).
32.7.2.5 Avoiding Failure of Active Methods
First, the need and feasibility of frost protection should be evaluated and, if so, the 
most economical method should be selected. Two programs (DEST and FrostEcon) 
may support your decision (download at http://home.isa.utl.pt/~jpabreu/
Downloads/).
Sometimes, project and/or installation problems occur when the requirements of 
the species/cultivar are ignored. For example, in the case of sprinkler irrigation, 
some plants or their parts break due to ice overload or root diseases may develop 
due to waterlogging.
However, most frost protection failures originate from inappropriate manage￾ment. For example:
• Weather forecast failure at synoptic or local level.
• Inadequate monitoring system.
• Inadequate start and/or stop times.
• Low water quality (e.g., sprinkler irrigation).
• Installations poorly maintained or lacking backup systems.

Factors

Abstract
Weeds are plants whose presence is undesirable at a time and/or place because 
they compete with crops for resources, deteriorate the quality of the harvested 
product, and can hinder harvesting. The most important weed species include C4 
perennials with vegetative propagation. Usually, weeds can produce many seeds 
that often present dormancy, which generates a soil seed bank that germinates 
over many years. This prevents weed eradication and forces us to use control 
techniques to keep tolerable weed populations. Weeds adapt in a few years to the 
cropping system, in special to control methods. Control techniques include her￾bicides and cultural practices such as tillage, mulching, mowing, and crop rota￾tion. Crop management has an important effect on the incidence of pests. The 
irrigation method and frequency determine the germination of weeds and infu￾ence the infection by aerial or soil pathogens. Biological control is effective with 
invasive weeds and some insects. The ability of weeds to evolve in response to 
the selection pressure exerted by control measures forces us to establish long￾term strategies (weed management) which should be based on detailed knowl￾edge of the ecology of the weed species. Then different types of control should 
be alternated to improve the control effciency.

33.1 Introduction
Weed control has always been an important part of agricultural practices and is 
often considered part of agronomy. Traditionally, only manual weeding was specif￾cally aimed to control weeds, but many practices, such as tillage, burning, and rota￾tions, contributed in some way to this control. In 1944, when 2,4-D was introduced 
as an herbicide, Weed Science appeared as a discipline within the techniques of 
Plant Protection, although much more tied to crop production techniques.
It is estimated that not more than 250 species have become important weeds for 
agricultural production.
In this chapter, we will review the main ecological characteristics of weeds and 
the methods of control except pesticides, presented in Chap. 34. For some specifc 
control techniques, we will also mention their impact on other pests.
33.2 Characteristics of Weeds
A weed is a plant growing where it is not wanted, i.e., in the wrong time or location. 
This is a relative defnition as seeds left from a crop after harvest may lead to weeds 
for the next crop. However, the most troublesome weed species usually show spe￾cial characteristics that allow their dispersal and persistence in agricultural systems 
and increase their ability to compete with crop plants.
33.2.1 Dispersal of Weeds
Weeds use the general dispersal mechanisms of plants (wind, animals, water, grav￾ity) but also present among their invasion strategies, anthropochory, the dispersal by 
human action. The commerce of agricultural products, seeds, and other materials 
has contributed to the dispersal and homogenization of weeds worldwide. The most 
damaging species are found in many environments and systems around the world. 
Table 33.1 shows the most important weed species on a global scale. Most of these 
species are C4 perennials.
The invasion of a new site is usually based on a small but continuous fow of 
propagules transported from short distances. However, the most effective dispersal 
strategy of a weed population is based on adaptations that ensure the return of weed 
seeds with the crop seed at the time of planting.
33.2.2 Persistence of Weeds
The persistence of weed populations is often guaranteed by many seeds that often 
exhibit dormancy mechanisms. These allow germination to spread over a long 
period (years) and ensure the population’s survival.

are C4 except where C3 is indicated
The community of buried propagules (soil seed bank) consists of rhizomes, sto￾lons, bulbs, and seeds of different species. The seeds entering the soil may be dor￾mant or enter into secondary dormancy. The most important factors for germination 
or dormancy release are water, temperature, light, NO3, O2, and CO2. The perma￾nence of some form of dormancy in buried seeds is an adaptive advantage as it 
allows adjusting seed germination to ecological conditions favorable to the survival 
of seedlings. The loss of seed dormancy in the soil occurs especially if the water 
content and aeration are adequate. Germination is very sensitive to the quality of 
light (phytochrome system), especially that resulting from radiation interception by 
vegetation. Thus, by detecting the light quality, the seed not only receives informa￾tion about the depth at which it is buried but can also detect the presence of a canopy 
above, which may limit the growth of the seedling. Apart from that, some species 
respond to short light pulses as those that the seed may experience during secondary 
tillage.
Other factors contributing to break seed dormancy are a low concentration of 
CO2, a high concentration of nitrates, and temperature oscillations. The latter allows 
the seed to “detect” its depth in the soil because the temperature range decreases 
with depth (Chap. 6). A buried seed under a wide temperature variation is probably 
near the surface and likely to stay on a clear area without vegetation since the pres￾ence of the latter buffers the soil temperature variation.
On the other hand, weeds often show a great capacity for acclimation and adapta￾tion, associated with annual cycles, reduced chromosome number, and self￾pollination or vegetative propagation. The most important selective force acting on 
weeds in agricultural systems is human action including type, depth and timing of 
33 Control of Weeds and Other Biotic Factors516
tillage, sowing date, timing and type of herbicide application, etc. There are selec￾tion pressures that select weed genotypes suitable to endure in the system due to 
adjusted mechanisms of dormancy and germination, and, more importantly, there 
are similarities to the crop in height, seed size, and maturity period to ensure the 
joint harvest with the crop. It is clear then that the main determinant of weed fora 
in a given area will be the main crops grown in addition to management practices.
In some cases, besides selective forces, the system provides genetic information 
that can contribute to the evolution of the weed (crossing between weeds and crop 
plants).
Unlike insects and fungal pathogens, weed populations do not suffer sudden 
changes in population density due to the damping exerted by the seed bank. 
Therefore, weeds are usually a chronic but not an epidemic problem, but the vari￾ability is large. Some species with high reproductive potential but low seed dor￾mancy and low persistence in the soil, such as Alopecurus myosuroides (green 
foxtail), are typically aggressive opportunistic invaders but are also easily remov￾able. By contrast, other species with low reproductive potential but strong dormancy 
in seeds, such as Veronica hederifolia (speedwell), tend to persist with steady popu￾lations. These differences in the population dynamics of different weed species have 
implications for their control that should try to eradicate populations of the frst type 
with intense short-term measures while keeping reduced populations for the sec￾ond type.
33.3 Classification of Weeds
According to their life cycle, weeds are classifed as:
– Annual weeds: They complete their life cycle in 1  year. We may distinguish 
two groups:
(i) Winter annuals that germinate in the fall and set seed in spring or summer. 
They are usually found in winter cereals. Examples: Avena sterilis (wild oat) 
and Sinapis arvensis (wild mustard).
(ii) ii) Summer annuals that germinate in spring and set seed in autumn. 
Examples: Amaranthus retrofexus (redroot pigweed) and Portulaca olera￾cea (common purslane).
– Biannual weeds: They require 2 years to complete the cycle, devoting the frst 
year to vegetative development and storage of carbohydrates (rosette stage in 
many species) and fowering in the second spring.
Example: Thistles.
– Perennial weeds have cycles of several years: In some cases, they show vegeta￾tive reproduction from organs (roots, stems, rhizomes, stolons, tubers, bulbs) that 
remain dormant until suitable conditions for sprouting occur.
F. J. Villalobos et al.517
Examples: Cyperus rotundus (purple nutsedge), Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda 
grass), and Sorghum halepense (Johnson grass).
Weeds can also be classifed according to the habitat where they are usually 
found (crops, pastures, orchards or forests, surface waters, roadsides, and waste 
places).
33.4 Crop-Weed Interactions
Weeds always compete for resources (water, light, nutrients) and often show certain 
competitive advantages such as high density, earlier emergence, or high early vigor. 
Some morphological (taller plants, deeper roots) or physiological (C4 photosynthe￾sis, allelopathy) mechanisms may also enhance weed growth when in competition 
with crop plants. Apart from yield losses due to competition, weeds have other 
negative effects such as hindering harvest or degrading crop quality by altering the 
color, smell, and taste or adding toxins.
In all cases, the level of competition and thus of yield loss will be directly pro￾portional to the earliness of weed emergence relative to that of the crop, as discussed 
in Chap. 12. Therefore, it is diffcult to establish general relationships between crop 
yield and weed density (Dpw). If we use the reciprocal yield law (Chap. 12), we may 
calculate yield (kg/ha) as:
Y
HI D
b b D b D
p
p w pw
= + +
10
1 2 2
(33.1)
where b1 and b2 are empirical coeffcients that determine the response of the crop to 
plant density. The factor 10 in Eq. 33.1 is used to convert g/m2
 to kg/ha. Now, we 
have added a term (b2w Dpw) that incorporates the competition of the weed. If the 
crop and the weed are very similar in form and cycle, then the coeffcients b2 and b2w
should be the same.
Example 33.1
Let’s calculate the yield of a cereal crop as a function of weed density. We’ll 
assume that:
b1 = 0.01 plant/g, b2 = b2w = 0.001 m2
/g, HI=0.4, and Dp = 200 plants/m2
.
According to Eq. 33.1, yield may be calculated as:
Y
HI D
b b D b D D
p
p w pw pw
= + + = + +
10 800
0 01 0 20 0 001 1 2 2 . . .
Yields for weed densities of 0, 100, and 200 plants m−2
 would be 3810, 
2581, and 1951 kg/ha.
33 Control of Weeds and Other Biotic Factors518
Many studies indicate that the 30–40 days after emergence are critical for deter￾mining yield losses due to weeds. If the crop is kept clean during this period, any 
later invasion will not cause yield reduction but may lead to other problems (e.g., 
harvest problems). On the other hand, if weeds are completely removed at the end 
of this period, yield reduction will be small.
33.5 Economic Threshold
An economic threshold or action threshold for a given pest is the pest density at 
which control should be applied. Otherwise, the pest will reach a higher density 
level (called Economic Injury Level, EIL) at which the cost of control equals the 
economic loss due to the yield reduction caused by the pest, quality loss, or harvest￾ing diffculties. Note that if the action level is exceeded, there will be an economic 
loss. The action threshold may be equal to the EIL for weeds, but it may be much 
lower for insects if the population increases rapidly.
Using Eq. 33.1, we may calculate the yield loss (YL, kg/ha) for weeds as:
YL
HI D
b b D
HI D
b b D b D
p
p
p
p w pw
= + − + +
10 10
1 2 1 2 2
(33.2)
One important difference between weeds and other pests is that weeds have a 
negative effect for any density as they always use resources (water, nutrients). Other 
pests (e.g., insects) may not reduce yield when populations are low.
If the selling price of the harvest is PY (euro/kg) and the cost of weed control is 
CH (euro/ha), then the economic threshold (taken as equal to EIL) corresponds to a 
yield loss of CH/PY. Using Eq. 33.2, we may deduce the corresponding weed density:
D
HI D C
b Y P Y C pwu
p H
w x Y x H
= ( ) −
10
2
(33.3)
where Yx is yield in the absence of weeds. We see that the economic threshold is 
directly proportional to planting density and the cost of weed control, while it is 
inversely proportional to weed competitive ability (b2w), crop yield, and selling price.
Example 33.2
Using the data of Example 33.1, we may calculate the economic threshold if 
the grain price is 0.25 euro/kg and the cost of weed control is 150 euro/ha:
Dpwu = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅
⋅ ⋅ ( ) − = 10 0 4 200 150 −
0 001 3810 0 25 3810 150
39 2 .
. . plants m
In this case, control should not be performed unless weed density exceed 
39 plants m−2
.
F. J. Villalobos et al.519
The economic threshold thus defned is valid in the short term as it affects only 
the current crop. Lower values of the economic threshold will result if one considers 
a longer perspective. For example, in organic farms in the Netherlands, the main 
problems of weeds in certain crops (e.g., onion) are due to seeds from weeds not 
controlled in the previous wheat crop. This implies the need for more intensive 
weed control during the wheat season at a higher cost than this crop would need.
Some species (e.g., Chenopodium album) are easy to control with hormonal her￾bicides but diffcult to eradicate due to their long seed persistence. In these cases, we 
may use the short-term economic threshold. In other species diffcult to control with 
herbicides and low seed persistence (e.g., Avena sterilis), it is better to apply intense 
control measures using a long-term economic threshold.
The effect of a given weed density on yield depends on many factors, in special 
the time of weed emergence relative to the crop. Furthermore, weeds can gradually 
emerge, which complicates the prediction of its competitive ability, given the spatial 
variability in weed distribution within a feld. Thus, the empirical equations between 
yield and weed density have a limited validity, and economic thresholds deduced 
from them.
The application of economic thresholds is limited in practice as it requires know￾ing the effect of pest densities on crop yield. However, it serves to illustrate some 
important principles of pest control. First, low population levels of the pest do not 
reduce farmer’s profts, i.e., complete suppression of the pest is not usually the best 
economic alternative unless we can ensure long-term eradication. Second, the toler￾able population density depends on biological (competitive ability of weeds, dam￾age capacity of insects, the response of plants to damage, etc.), economic (market 
value of crop, cost of control), and agronomic (e.g., planting density) factors.
33.6 Pest Control
Pest control aims at reducing populations of pests to acceptable levels. The com￾plete elimination of weed plants and seeds is expensive and almost impossible due 
to the soil seed bank. Fumigants will control nematodes, soilborne fungi and bacte￾ria, soil insects, and weeds (seeds and germinating seedlings) but are restricted by 
their high cost and toxicity. A less aggressive option to fumigation is soil solariza￾tion whereby a transparent plastic sheet is placed on the soil surface following irri￾gation in summer. The high temperatures (> 60 °C) and humidity will eliminate 
most soilborne pests down to about 30 cm.
As eradication of weeds is not possible, we will prevent the entry of new propa￾gules into the feld and reduce their population. Prevention is based on using seeds 
free of pest propagules and viruses and clean machinery while keeping the feld 
margins free of dangerous weeds that may host other pests.
33 Control of Weeds and Other Biotic Factors520
33.6.1 Mechanical Control
Tillage in general stimulates the germination of weed seeds in the soil. The main 
effects of tillage on emerged weed plants are due to the burial of the aerial part 
(reduced assimilation), mechanical wounding of shoots and roots, and uprooting of 
the weed that dies by desiccation. Tillage is effective against annual weeds but may 
increase infestation of creeping perennials by breakage and spreading of propagules 
(rhizomes, stolons) when the soil is wet. The effect of tillage depends on the type 
and depth, with deep moldboard being very effective in killing plants by burial but 
promoting the transfer of seeds from deep to surface layers. Vertical tillage will act 
mostly by mechanical wounding but has little effect on seed distribution.
In earlier times, the only measures available for weed control in growing crops 
were pulling, harrowing, and hoeing. Pulling is very effective against annuals and 
tap-rooted plants but may not be so if the plant can resprout from root segments. 
Therefore, its effectiveness depends on the ability to remove as much root system as 
possible, which is quite diffcult in perennials.
Mowing reduces the growth of weeds and is very effective in preventing seed 
production. However, mowing alone selects creeping genotypes or species that 
escape control.
Burning stubble or crop residues has been used since ancient times to control 
weeds, insects, and pathogens but also for seedbed preparation. However, burning is 
restricted because of several disadvantages (wildfre risk, air pollution, loss of 
organic matter and nitrogen). High temperatures kill seedlings and may kill or 
reduce the viability of weed seeds, insects, and fungi close to the soil surface. This 
may also be achieved by solarization as discussed above. Another possibility is 
faming weeds, which is more effective on weed seedlings.
Flooding prevents the germination of seeds and kills submerged plants. It is the 
basic weed control measure in continuous fooded rice crops.
Opaque mulching with black or gray plastic or other materials (gravel, sand, 
sawmill residues) will prevent seed germination and kill weeds by carbon starvation.
33.6.2 Other Control Techniques
Crop management affects weed populations in many complex ways. The crop rota￾tion may reduce weed problems, for example, alternating winter and spring crops. 
Rotations are also very effective in reducing the incidence of soilborne diseases. 
The management of residues plays a major role in pest control as they serve as a 
reservoir for pest propagules.
Secondary tillage for seedbed preparation induces the germination of weeds 
that are then controlled using herbicide or shallow tillage before actual sowing. 
This system is called stale or false seedbed.
Irrigation management also affects pests. The germination of weeds will not 
occur in dry soil; thus, partial wetting or underground irrigation will reduce weed 
abundance. Some soilborne fungi are promoted by continuous wetting of the soil, so 
F. J. Villalobos et al.521
reducing the irrigation frequency may be an effective control practice. Wetting of 
plant shoots promotes the infection by aerial fungal diseases (e.g., rusts) but may 
help control other pests (e.g., mites).
The selection of adequate genotypes may help in improving the competitive abil￾ity of the crop. In the case of aerial diseases, the use of resistant genotypes is one of 
the major alternatives for control (see 33.7). Cultivars that are Genetically Modifed 
Organisms (GMO) have been bred that include resistance to certain herbicides (e.g., 
soybean resistant to glyphosate), thus allowing the application of the specifc herbi￾cide to the feld areas where weeds appear after the crop has been established. In 
other cases, bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis) genes that produce a toxin have been 
inserted in cultivars of some major crops such as corn and cotton, and these cultivars 
produce the Bt toxin that kills Lepidoptera larvae feeding on the crop. In all cases, 
weed and insect control costs have been greatly reduced in the GMO cultivars.
Planting density also affects the incidence of pests. On the one hand, a high 
planting density may compensate for plant losses due to pests. On the other hand, 
crops with high LAI suffer a more humid microenvironment and stay wet for longer 
after wetting which favors aerial pathogens.
Biological control involves the introduction of organisms that are consumers, 
pests, or diseases of other pests. The agent should not affect the crop and should be 
able to adapt successfully in the area where it is introduced. The most famous exam￾ple of biological control of weeds was that of Opuntia stricta in Australia which was 
controlled successfully using a moth (Cactoblastis cactorum). Insect control may 
be performed by Coccinellidae (ladybugs, ladybirds) which feed on aphids and 
scale insects.
Chemical control is one of the main alternatives for pest control and will be con￾sidered in detail in the next chapter.
33.7 Using Pest-Resistant Cultivars
One of the best alternatives for reducing the impact of insects and diseases is using 
resistant cultivars. We distinguish two types of resistance:
(a) Qualitative or vertical resistance is controlled by one or a few genes so we fnd 
distinct resistant and susceptible cultivars. The continuous use of the resistant 
cultivar may lead to a new race for which resistance is lost, forcing the develop￾ment of a new resistant cultivar.
(b) Quantitative or horizontal resistance is controlled by many genes so there is a 
continuous variation in the level of resistance of different genotypes. This type 
of resistance holds for many races of the pathogen so it will last much longer 
than vertical resistance but is diffcult to transfer between genotypes.
We can also distinguish between resistance if the pest does not infect the host 
plant, or the infection is very limited, and tolerance when infection occurs with low 
impact on yield.
33 Control of Weeds and Other Biotic Factors522
Several alternatives may be used to reduce the selection pressure on the pathogen 
so the resistance holds longer:
(a) Alternating resistant and susceptible cultivars in the crop rotation.
(b) Sowing a mix of resistant and susceptible cultivars: Resistant plants act as phys￾ical barriers to the spread of the pathogen among susceptible plants. The same 
happens with multiple crops.
(c) Using a multiline which is an ensemble of cultivars with resistance to different 
pathogen races.
(d) Incorporating the resistance to different races in a single cultivar.
Options a and b are not attractive to farmers, while options c and d require huge 
efforts by breeding companies, so in the end, plant breeders keep track of new 
pathogenic races and breed for new cultivars in a never-ending fght against the 
adaptation of pathogens. This is called maintenance breeding and is essential for the 
sustainability of agriculture even though it is not a priority of agricultural research 
in many countries.
33.8 Weed Management
Weed management is a set of strategies aimed at controlling the weed populations 
in the long term (years) in a cropping system. It involves a more comprehensive and 
longer-term approach than weed control. This technology is based on better knowl￾edge of the ecology of weed populations, their critical periods for the formation of 
propagules, and their interactions with cultural practices. With that knowledge, it is 
possible to design long-term strategies to keep weed populations at acceptable lev￾els from the point of view of crop production. For example, models of germination 
of weeds may be used to adjust the dates of tillage, herbicide application, or crop 
planting before the emergence of the weeds.
Another important aspect of weed management is to develop long-term strate￾gies necessary if we look at weeds as a phenomenon at the farm or even the agricul￾tural system level. In this case, we should be concerned about the production and 
dispersal of propagules. For instance, the better the separation between crop and 
weed seeds in the combine, the better the weed dispersal in the feld.
Strategies for long-term management must also consider the evolution of weeds 
which may be very fast (several years) in response to the strong selective pressure 
exerted by agricultural practices (including herbicides). One interesting choice is 
alternating control measures. An example would be the application of herbicides for 
several years leading to a reduction of genetic variability, which often leads to strict 
temperature requirements for germination. After several years, we may exploit the 
characteristics of the weed population using tillage at the right time or by changes 
in cultural practices (e.g., earlier sowing). In this second phase, the weed population 
is selected to broader forms with greater sensitivity to herbicides.

Abstract
The main characteristics of pesticides from an agronomic viewpoint are selectiv￾ity, mobility within the plant, and toxicity on nontarget plants, insects, and other 
fauna. Pesticide application should maximize the protective effect while prevent￾ing drift, which is increased with high wind speed, unstable conditions, and high 
evaporative demand. There is a general trend in pest control toward less persis￾tent molecules with lower environmental impacts. Pesticide doses may be 
adjusted according to the actual canopy volume (TRV method) for trees and Leaf 
Area Index in annual crops.
34.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we discuss the chemicals applied to crops and the environmental 
factors to consider for their application. The main pesticides used in agriculture are 
herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides for controlling weeds, insects, and pathogen 
fungi, respectively. The term pesticide also includes other products that are not 
exactly control agents like defoliants, desiccants, and plant growth regulators 
(Table 34.1).
Pesticide use is almost as old as agriculture with elemental sulfur being the frst 
known pesticide, employed by the Sumerians to control insects and mites about 
4500 years ago.

34.2 Pesticides
In general, a small amount of pesticide active ingredient (a.i.) should be applied 
uniformly over a large area. To improve distribution and application uniformity, the 
active ingredient is usually made up into a formulation, which combines the active 
ingredient with various inert carriers, and other ingredients to improve shelf life, 
enhance dispersal in water, and prevent clumping (solids). The type of formulation 
can affect the toxicity, the persistence, and the rate of release.
The concentration of active ingredient in a formulation may be expressed as % 
weight (% w/w) for solids. For liquids, there are several alternatives like % weight 
(% w/w), % volume (% w/v), or concentration (g/L).
Pesticides may be liquid (solutions or suspensions) or solid (powder or gran￾ules). They may be applied with spray bars or dispensers over the entire surface or 
localized over only a fraction.
It is common to use mixtures of pesticides to expand the range of action (control 
more species), save on applications, and in some cases, produce synergism, i.e., the 
action of a pesticide enhances the effect of another. Compatibility is the possibility 
of mixing two pesticides without reducing their effciency.
According to their mobility in the plant, pesticides may be called systemic when 
absorbed and translocated inside the plant or contact, when only the plant organ in 
contact with the chemical is affected.
We may also classify pesticides according to their persistence (residual or non￾residual) or selectivity (selective versus nonselective) depending on the species 
affected.
F. J. Villalobos and E. Fereres527
34.3 Application of Pesticides
Most pesticides are sprayed as liquid formulations but other methods may also be 
used, like baits, fumigants, dusts, or in irrigation water. Spray methods may be clas￾sifed according to the volume application rate (VAR, L/ha) (Table 34.2). Table 34.3
shows the possible formulations used in pesticide spraying.
Spray application is a relatively complex process that can be divided into a trans￾port phase and another of interaction with the surface to be treated. A set of droplets, 
characterized by a diameter distribution and an initial velocity, is released from the 
nozzle at a given height. These droplets suffer a vertical force, resultant of the forces 
of gravity and friction, and a horizontal force (wind drift) that determines the trajec￾tory and hence the contact point. During transport, droplets are subjected to direct 
evaporation so the diameter decreases. The fall speed decreases as does the diameter 
of the droplets. Tiny droplets may remain suspended in the air and fall very slowly, 
which increases horizontal displacement and thus drift.
The interaction phase occurs when the drops reach the surface. Large droplets 
tend to bounce or drain down to the ground. Small droplets will likely stick to the 
crop surfaces. Therefore, optimal droplet diameter is generally in the 150–250 
micron range depending on the product type (Table 34.4). The density of impacts 
required also depends on the type of product. For example, nonsystemic fungicides

The spray volume for LAI=1 has been calculated for nearly optimal conditions (10% loss by drift 
and 10% not intercepted by the canopy)
and preventive contact insecticides for very mobile pests require full coverage of 
plant organs and therefore a very high density of impacts. In the case of insecticides 
that are toxic by ingestion with highly mobile insects, the required density will be 
much lower.
34.4 Drift
Drift is a side effect of ground and aerial pesticide applications. It is the uncon￾trolled airborne movement of spray droplets, vapors or dust particles, away from the 
intended point of application, reducing the actual dose applied. Drift can cause 
injury to nontarget plants and animals and contaminate nontarget sites, in special, 
surface waters, sensitive crops, warehouses, populated areas, and fowering crops 
with bees present.
Any pesticide application may produce drift. The actual amount will depend on 
the pesticide formulation, the application method, the volume used, and the weather 
conditions during application. Pesticide drift is usually greater when the application 
height is large (e.g., by aircraft), so it is recommended not to exceed 1.2 m (above 
the crop) for ground applications. Drift is also important with light particles (e.g., 
dusts, low volatility oils) or small droplets. For sprays, droplet size increases with 
nozzle diameter and decreases with pressure. Droplets with diameters lower than 
100 microns favor drift so the 150–200 micron range is recommended. Thickeners 
reduce the frequency of small droplets.
Fumigants and highly volatile formulations may produce vapors that easily drift. 
Volatilization is proportional to evaporative demand and inversely proportional to 
drop size. Water-based sprays will volatilize more quickly than oil-based sprays. 
However, oil-based sprays can drift farther because they are lighter, especially at 
high temperatures.
The best conditions to minimize drift are low evaporative demand (temperature 
below 32–35 °C), low wind (1–2 m/s) with consistent direction, and a neutral tem￾perature profle. These conditions are more likely before mid morning and late in 
F. J. Villalobos and E. Fereres529
the afternoon. Unstable conditions favor the rise of droplets and therefore the hori￾zontal displacement. Under stable conditions (temperature inversion), a highly con￾centrated cloud may form and move outside the target area. This is highly risky for 
herbicides but might be acceptable for insecticides or fungicides. Spraying pesti￾cides, in special herbicides, should be avoided for calm (wind speed below 1 m/s) 
and windy conditions (above 2.5–3  m/s). Note that atmospheric instability adds 
thermal turbulence to mechanical turbulence due to wind, so for any given wind 
speed, the conditions for spraying get worse as instability increases.
Pesticide applications should be avoided when rain is expected in the short term. 
Wind direction should be considered to analyze the risk of drift arriving at sensitive 
areas. Untreated buffer zones should be established if needed.
34.5 Persistence of Pesticides
The persistence of pesticides determines the duration of the protective effect and the 
safety period between application and harvest. The persistence of an herbicide also 
may preclude planting a sensitive species in the same feld.
The degradation of pesticides is caused by:
– Microbial decomposition, enhanced by environmental conditions that favor 
microbial activity.
– Chemical decomposition by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis.
– Photolysis, i.e., chemical degradation due to light absorption.
Pesticides can be immobilized in the soil (adsorption by soil colloids), mostly by 
organic colloids. Therefore, soils with high organic matter or clay soils will require 
larger doses of herbicides.
Pesticides can be lost by leaching or volatilization. Leaching depends on its solu￾bility and its adsorption to colloids. The more volatile products should be incorpo￾rated into the soil to avoid volatilization. Residual herbicides (e.g., Atrazine) 
accumulate in groundwater after leaching, which led to restrictions in some coun￾tries (e.g., Atrazine use was discontinued in the EU in 2004).
34.6 Herbicides
34.6.1 General Characteristics
Herbicides are phytotoxic products. They may be classifed as total or selective 
when they affect all or just some species. In terms of time of application, we may 
distinguish preplant, preemergent, and postemergent (in relation to the crop), and in 
terms of mobility, we have systemic and contact herbicides.
The dose of herbicide depends on its phytotoxicity to the weeds and the crop and 
weed density.
34 Application of Herbicides and Other Biotic Control Agents530
Herbicides may be absorbed by roots, leaves, or stems. Leaf absorption is 
increased by adding wetting agents. The absorption of polar herbicides is more 
effective by the roots than by the leaves. Herbicides interfere with plant metabolic 
processes (photosynthesis, respiration, and metabolism of nucleic acids and pro￾teins). Visual symptoms of herbicide damage include reduced growth, malforma￾tion of leaves, and plant wilting.
The translocation of systemic herbicides can follow two paths. If it is absorbed 
by roots, the herbicide passes to the xylem and moves with sap fow. If it is absorbed 
by leaves, it moves via symplast to the phloem and then moves to the growing 
tissues.
34.6.2 Selectivity of Herbicides
The selectivity of an herbicide refects its ability to control weeds without signif￾cant damage to the crop. The selectivity depends on several factors:
(a) Plant: Sensitivity is higher in young and fast-growing plants. The highest sensi￾tivity in seedlings is due to their thinner cuticle. The morphology of the plant 
may be responsible for the selectivity. It may be due, for example, to differences 
between the crop and the weed in the root system or the location of sensitive 
organs such as the apical meristem.
(b) Climate: The selectivity of foliar-absorbed herbicides is reduced at high tem￾peratures. However, in these conditions, the rate of metabolism of the herbicide 
in the plant is higher which helps reduce its negative effects. In conditions of 
high humidity and/or high soil water content, the leaf cuticles have a higher 
degree of hydration that facilitates herbicide leaf absorption and can increase 
the potential damage to the crop.
(c) Soil: Texture and organic content determine the degree of fxation of the herbi￾cide to soil colloids and hence the concentration of the active ingredient in the 
root zone.
The high sensitivity of seedlings is the basis of the technique of split dosing 
which involves making several small-dose postemergence applications when weeds 
are emerging so that the crop hardly suffers their effects while weed seedlings are 
killed. The main groups of herbicides and their characteristics are presented in 
Table 34.5.
34.7 Insecticides
Insecticides are agents that control insects by killing them or preventing their 
destructive behaviors. Insecticides may be natural or artifcial and are applied in 
different formulations and delivery systems (sprays, baits, slow-release diffusion,

Table 34.6 shows a classifcation of insecticides.
By 1940, only some inorganic (e.g., sulfur) or botanical (e.g., pyrethrum) insec￾ticides were available. Then the frst synthetic organic insecticide, DDT, an organo￾chlorine, appeared. After that, the history of insecticides has been a mixture of 
success (high levels of control at low cost, development of specifc products with 
low persistence) and failure (e.g., organochlorines are toxic for animals, accumulate 
in the trophic chain, and had to be banned).
34.8 Fungicides and Control of Diseases
Plant diseases are best controlled by integrating several practices including sowing 
date, planting density, crop rotation, cultivar selection (using disease-tolerant or 
disease-resistant genotypes), fertilizer and irrigation programs, microclimate modi￾fcation, and application of fungicides.
Knowledge of the disease cycle of the pathogen is important when developing 
disease forecasting systems or economic thresholds. Forecasting systems are based 
on temperature and relative humidity or leaf wetness. Thresholds-based programs 
involve periodical monitoring of symptoms (e.g., number of disease spots per leaf).

Important aspects of the disease cycle include the number of generations per year of 
the pathogen and the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms 
(latent or incubation period) which may be a few hours for aerial diseases up to 
several weeks for soilborne pathogens.
Fungicides are products that kill or prevent the growth of fungi and their spores. 
They may be classifed according to different criteria.
F. J. Villalobos and E. Fereres533
(a) Mobility in the plant.
Contact fungicides remain on the surface after application, not entering the plant 
and having no after-infection activity. Repeated applications are needed to pro￾tect new growth and to replace losses by rain or irrigation, or degraded by envi￾ronmental factors.
Systemic fungicides are absorbed into the plant and move within it. They may 
offer some after-infection activity. Very few fungicides are truly systemic (the 
group of the phosphonates) but some are acropetal penetrant; they move upward 
in the xylem, protecting new growth. Other fungicides are localized penetrant, 
redistributing only within the treated leaf.
(b) Role in protection: We distinguish the following categories:
– Preventive fungicides offer a protective barrier that prevents infection.
– Early infection activity: The product enters the plant and stops the pathogen, 
acting until several days after infection. This type is also preventive and is 
most effective before infection.
– Eradication: A few products can stop disease development after symptoms 
appear. Even then, the damage caused by the disease often does not disappear.
– Anti-sporulant activity products prevent spore formation. The disease con￾tinues to develop, but spores are not produced, reducing the amount of inoc￾ulum to infect surrounding plants.
(c) Mode of action.
The mode of action is how a fungicide acts on a target fungus, i.e., the specifc 
process in the metabolism that is affected (e.g., damaging cell membranes, inac￾tivating critical enzymes). A single-site fungicide affects only one point in one 
metabolic pathway or a single critical enzyme or protein. These fungicides are 
less phytotoxic and tend to have systemic properties, but show a higher risk of 
pathogens developing resistance, as the mode of action is so specifc that small 
genetic changes in fungi can overcome the effect of the fungicide. On the other 
hand, a multisite fungicide affects different metabolic sites within the fungus.
34.9 Calculation of the Volume Application Rate of Pesticides
The minimum volume of pesticide to apply or volume application rate (VAR, L 
ha−1
) may be calculated as a function of the desired impact density (N, impacts 
cm−2
) and the droplet diameter (d, μm) as:
VAR f LAI d N
p p s d
= ( ) − −
− 10
6 1
7 3 π (34.1)
where ps and pd are the probability of droplets not being intercepted by the canopy 
and the fraction of droplets lost as drift, respectively. The f(LAI) function depends 
on the type of pesticide:
34 Application of Herbicides and Other Biotic Control Agents534
– Contact fungicides and insecticides f(LAI) = 2 LAI.
– Systemic fungicides and insecticides f(LAI) = LAI.
– Herbicides f(LAI) = 1.
If the calculated value of f(LAI) is lower than 1, f(LAI) = 1.
Example 34.1
We want to apply a contact fungicide on a wheat crop with full ground cover 
and LAI = 3. The required impact density is 60 impacts cm−2
 and our sprayer 
generates droplets of average diameter 150 μm. We will perform the applica￾tion with good conditions (drift loss of 10%). With full ground cover, we can 
assume that almost all (90%) droplets will be intercepted by the canopy 
(ps = 0.1). With a contact fungicide, we take f(LAI) = 2 LAI = 6. Therefore:

34.10 Calculation of Spray Volumes for Fruit Tree Orchards
The Tree-Row-Volume (TRV) system was developed for hedgerow apple orchards 
in the United States. Instead of using a standard volume application rate (VAR = 
3741 L/ha = 400 gallon/ acre), the VAR was corrected in proportion to tree volume 
per unit area (TRV, m3
 ha−1
):
VAR L ha TRV − ( ) = ⋅ 1 0.0937 (34.2)
where 0.0937 is the volume (in L) of spray necessary to wet 1 m3
 of crown (of low 
leaf area density). This value increases to 0.1337 L m−3
 for dense trees. This same 
approach may be applied also to orchards where tree crowns do not overlap. 
However, the specifc factor of spray volume per unit of canopy volume may change 
for high-density orchards or different leaf anatomy (e.g., for grapevines, 0.3 L m−3
).
If the recommended dose of pesticide is δp (kg active ingredient ha−1
) for a stan￾dard VAR of 3741 L/ha, then the actual dose of pesticide should be:

Abstract
Harvesting is the key operation in farming that culminates the season’s efforts. It 
took a large fraction of labor used in agriculture until recently. Mechanical har￾vesting has decreased costs dramatically, contributing greatly to lower food 
prices. Determining the harvest time is normally a compromise between factors 
that increase profts (e.g., delaying it for greater biomass) and risks (e.g., lower 
product quality or persistent bad weather). There are yield losses during the har￾vest operation that must be prevented and postharvest losses related to storage 
conditions. Drying grain and storing it under low relative humidity (RH) mini￾mizes fungal diseases that deteriorate the product. The water content of the seeds 
after harvest tends to an equilibrium value in storage that depends on the RH and 
air temperature. The equilibrium water content may be determined through 
Moisture Release Isotherms. Forage crops may be browsed by animals or cut and 
conserved as silage, haylage, or hay, with each process requiring drier plant 
materials before safe storage. Fruit harvest for the fresh market is still done by 
hand with special regard for quality. The harvest of fruits and vegetables for pro￾cessing has been extensively mechanized, but determining its timing is based on 
a trade-off between quality factors and yield and marketing objectives.

35.1 Introduction
Harvest is a key activity as it culminates all farming operations leading to the ulti￾mate goal of agriculture, producing food and useful materials. The frst agricultural 
practice in history was harvest. Long before actual crop husbandry began, humans 
were collecting seeds from some grass species as part of a diverse diet. These 
hunter-gatherers processed the seeds to produce ale and bread. A great advantage of 
seeds was the long-term storage for later use in contrast with the limited preserva￾tion time of meat from hunting. Furthermore, the low effciency of collecting seeds 
from natural populations where useful plants are scattered probably fostered the 
idea of crops. Someone must have wondered: What if this feld was flled every year 
only with the plant that I want? What if all the plants ripened at the same time, with 
larger seeds that would not shed before I collected them? Thus, harvesting the edi￾ble parts of plants in natural environments probably was pivotal to the invention of 
agriculture.
The great advances in crop productivity of recent decades have often been asso￾ciated with a reduction in harvesting costs through mechanization. In many cases, 
harvest costs limit the economic viability of crops. Traditionally, harvesting was 
based only on human labor with the partial support of beasts of burden for gathering 
and transport. The availability of labor for harvest often limited the area of arable 
land. For instance, hand harvesting 1 ha of wheat required about 180 man-hours of 
work (15 days of 12-h days) while current mechanized harvesting requires only 0.4 
man-hours. Therefore, if the time to harvest is between 30 and 60 days, one person 
could harvest 2–4 ha manually but as many as 750–1500 ha using a standard com￾bine harvester.
One important decision for the farmer is when to harvest. Physiological maturity 
is defned as the time when the biomass of the harvested part reaches a maximum. 
However, the best conditions for harvesting (harvest maturity) will occur later 
because, in most cases, reducing further the water content of the product facilitates 
mechanical harvesting, reduces weight to be transported, and improves conditions 
for storage. In the case of fruits, the level of ripeness involving color, accumulation 
of secondary products, and taste has to be considered. In the case of many vegeta￾bles, the harvest date may not be associated with physiological maturity when spe￾cial quality characteristics are the main concern.
The harvest method and associated operations also affect other components of 
the farming system. Normally, the harvested product represents only part of the 
biomass and the rest must be managed so that it contributes to the subsequent crop 
and does not interfere with subsequent farming operations. The management of 
crop residues has a major impact on the organic matter and nutrient balances of the 
soil and offers great opportunities for soil conservation. Harvesting can also have 
adverse effects on the agricultural system like the spread of pathogens, insects, and 
weeds and soil compaction due to the traffc of the heavy machinery used.
F. J. Villalobos and E. Fereres539
35.2 Harvest Operations
Harvest can affect the whole plant or only part of it. In this case, the harvested organ 
may be aerial or underground (Table 35.1). The crop residues may be also harvested 
and exported outside the feld, either separately or still attached to useful parts, for 
further separation. In the best case, only the useful organs are exported while crop 
residues remain in the feld.
Decisions about when and how to harvest depend on the fnal use of the product 
(Table 35.1). For example, vegetable and fruit products for fresh consumption are 
frequently gathered by hand in several passes as the crop ripens.
The operations involved in crop harvesting depend on the species and its use 
(Table 35.2). In most cases, the harvest consists of cutting part or the total aboveg￾round part of the plant and separating the useful fraction (e.g., seeds) from the resi￾dues. These two processes may occur at about the same time (e.g., combine harvest 
of grains) or the cut plants may be left in the feld for drying and then either com￾bined or transported out of the feld for threshing and winnowing. Before harvest, it 
may be necessary to prepare the crop (using defoliants or abscission promoters) 
and/or the soil (compaction, irrigation, etc.).
After harvesting, some postharvest operations may be performed in the feld/
farm or outside, like drying, cleaning, removing plant parts, sorting by size, etc.
Finally, the harvested product may go directly to the packing plant or the storage 
facility, which may require aeration and/or temperature control. For horticultural 
crops, a controlled atmosphere is frequently employed, with low oxygen and high 
carbon dioxide concentrations that slow down fruit ripening.

35.3 Yield Losses During Harvest
Not all crop biomass but only part (yield) is useful. The ratio yield/biomass was 
defned as the Harvest Index in Chap. 13. However, the harvested yield is always 
less than the actual yield (measured at physiological maturity) because of losses:
(a) Before harvest, due to:
– Respiration of the harvestable organ, which is proportional to the time in the 
feld after maturity and to its water content and temperature.
– Loss of harvestable structures (dehiscence of pods, abscission of fruits, con￾sumption by herbivores, fre, hail, etc.).
(b) During harvest:
– Not captured by the harvest system (e.g., parts below the cutter bar) or 
dropped by it.
– Deterioration of structures collected (broken grains, damaged fruits).
– Rejection due to low quality: Although not strictly a loss, part of the yield 
may be left uncollected because of poor quality or excessive harvest costs. 
For instance, a low grain yield may not compensate for the cost of mechani￾cal harvesting.
(c) After harvest (during packaging, transport, or storage).
– Respiration of the harvested organ: dependent on water content and 
temperature.
– Consumption or deterioration caused by pests and diseases: dependent on 
the humidity and sanitary conditions of the storage facility and the product 
water content and temperature.
– Rejection due to postharvest quality criteria: The collected product (or a 
fraction of it) may not meet quality standards implying a loss or an additional 
cost for sorting and separating those products not meeting the standard.
Box 35.1 The Year Without a Summer
Weather conditions in 1816 turned extremely cold. It was the result of the 
volcanic eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which ejected an enor￾mous amount of ash into the atmosphere, thereby reducing transmissivity and 
global radiation. It is estimated that the global average temperature decreased 
between 1.5 and 3 °C during the 3 years after the eruption. Heavy rainfall and 
cold temperatures during the summer in Western Europe delayed the develop￾ment of many crops that did not reach maturity. Those that did could not be 
harvested in many cases, and when harvested, the grain was lost later during 
storage. At that time, subsistence agriculture was common and people in the 
cities lived from harvest to harvest depending on fragile agricultural systems 
that did not produce suffcient food. Food shortages were dramatic during 
1816 and the two following years, not only in Europe but globally. In Asia, the 
monsoon patterns were disrupted causing not only famine but also epidemics 
that killed millions, and political unrest was at a high point in China.
F. J. Villalobos and E. Fereres541
35.4 Agricultural Operations Affected by Harvest
Harvesting normally requires the concentration of efforts by the farmer and its labor 
force thus restricting other simultaneous farm operations. The date and method of 
harvest of a crop determines the possible choices for the next crop in the rotation. 
The harvest method determines the amount and distribution of residues in the feld, 
which determines the need for additional operations (burning, chopping, removal) 
and, thus, the time required for land preparation before sowing the next crop.
Irrigation may improve soil conditions before harvest (e.g., before digging tubers 
or roots). Irrigations may also be stopped to promote abscission (of leaves or fruits) 
and to prevent soil compaction due to traffc on wet soil during harvest.
Some tillage operations may be required before harvesting (e.g., surface soil 
compaction to facilitate sweeping of fallen fruits after tree shaking of nut trees). 
Pesticide treatments must be stopped sometime before harvest to comply with the 
safety periods. In other cases (e.g., cotton), defoliants are applied to facilitate 
mechanical harvesting.
35.5 Harvest of Grains and Seeds
While there is some leeway in harvest time, delaying harvest in winter cereals, 
while leading to drier grain, has negative effects by increasing:
– Dry matter losses and/or reduced grain quality.
– Seed losses by dehiscence.
– The risk of deterioration or destruction by lodging, hail, or fre.
– Concentration of mycotoxins, toxic chemicals produced by naturally occurring 
molds, and some plant pathogens like Fusarium. The most common type is afa￾toxins, produced by molds of Aspergillus favus and A. parasiticus. The probabil￾ity of contamination with afatoxins is higher when the harvest is delayed during 
wet weather or when the grain is harvested wet and drying is delayed. Water￾stressed crops are more susceptible to infection. Afatoxin contamination occurs 
not only in grains but also in other agricultural products such as sunfower seeds, 
nuts, cassava, cottonseeds, spices, pepper, and hay. Maize harvest can be delayed 
longer than winter cereals but only if weather conditions are dry, thereby reduc￾ing drying costs without risking afatoxin contamination.
In many cases, harvest is performed before reaching the minimum water content 
required for safe storage and then the seed has to be dried out of the feld. In species 
where pod shedding is an issue (e.g., rapeseed), or when time is limited, harvest is 
performed in two stages. The frst is swathing, i.e., cutting the crop and leaving it to 
form windrows where it will dry for 5–10 days until the desired water content in 
seeds is achieved when the second stage to separate the seed from the pods (combin￾ing) is performed. Grain can be stored safely when clean, dry, healthy, and intact. 
Conditions improve if it is cold at the time of storage.
35 Harvest and Conservation542
The water content of the grain affects (Table 35.3):
(a) The risk of physical damage during harvest.
(b) The incidence of insect pests and fungal diseases.
(c) The metabolic activity of the seed, which affects its rate of deterioration, the 
release of oxygen by respiration, and heat generation in the stock.
The water content of the seeds in storage tends to an equilibrium that depends on 
the relative humidity (RH) and air temperature. Equilibrium is achieved when the 
water potential is equal in the air and the seed (Ψseed, J/kg):
Ψseed = − RT

where R = 8.3143 J mol−1
 K−1
, T is air temperature (K), Mw = 0.018 kg mol−1
, and 
aw is the water activity, equivalent to the equilibrium RH/100. Therefore, for a given 
air temperature and RH, the grain will reach an Equilibrium Moisture Content 
(EMC). This relationship is called moisture isotherm (Fig. 35.1) and is applied not 
only to seeds but to any material. The main factor determining EMC is RH, while 
temperature plays a minor effect. For instance, cereal grains at 25 °C and 70% RH
show EMC between 13% and 14% (wet basis) (−49 MPa). One of the main factors 
affecting the relationship between EMC and RH is the oil content: Seeds rich in oil 
will show a lower EMC for a given RH. This is seen when comparing seeds of wheat 
and sunfower (Fig.  35.1). Seed moisture may be expressed on a dry basis or 
wet basis:

Seeds are classifed as orthodox, which can be dried without being damaged or 
recalcitrant when desiccation kills the seed. Most agricultural species have orthodox 
seeds while those of Quercus spp., oil palm, chestnut, and cacao are recalcitrant. 
The seed longevity in orthodox seeds decreases linearly with temperature and water 
potential from −350 (2–6% water) to −14 MPa (aw from 0.1 to 0.9), regardless of 
species. Simple rules have been proposed for seed storage. For instance, the James’ 
rule establishes that the sum of temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) should 
be lower than 60. According to Harrington’s rule, seed longevity decreases by one￾half for every 1% increase in seed moisture content or every 6  °C increase in 
temperature.
To be on the safe side, the RH in the space between grains has to be lower than 
67–70% so that spore germination of pathogens is prevented. Therefore, low RH
prevents viability and respiration losses and attacks by pathogens and insects.
The grains may require conditioning (drying, cleaning) before safe storage. 
Postharvest losses of grains are signifcant, particularly in developing countries

where much of the production is conserved in the household. Although fgures as 
high as 40% are frequently cited, the World Bank estimated that in 2010, posthar￾vest losses were 15% of grain production in sub-Saharan Africa.
Table 35.4 presents values of seed water at physiological maturity and recom￾mended for harvest and storage of different crops.
35.6 Harvest of Forage Crops
In pastures and some forage crops, harvest may be performed directly by grazing 
animals. In this case, it is important to adjust the density of animals to maximize 
productivity. Animals may also graze feld crops during specifc growth stages or 
the stubble after harvest. The former is the case of dual-purpose crops (cereals, 
rapeseed) that may be grazed during vegetative growth. As the meristems are not 
affected, crop growth will resume afterward, leading to seed production if the sea￾son is long enough.
Harvested forages are stored as silage (50–65% water content), haylage 
(30–50%), or hay (15–25%). The best nutritive quality in most forages is achieved 
around fowering. Delaying mowing after that time implies greater (and drier) bio￾mass but lower quality. The other factor that determines mowing dates is the weather 
as conditions after mowing must be dry enough for successful drying.
For silage, the crop is cut, chopped, and taken to the silo where it is compacted 
to exclude air and then sealed with plastic to ensure anaerobic conditions. These are 
required for lactic bacteria to operate and reduce pH, thus ensuring long-term con￾servation. Some crops (maize, sorghum) may be taken to the silo just after cutting 
while others are left in the feld drying for 1–2 days before silage starts. For haylage, 
the crop is left to dry longer in the feld and then wrapped tightly in plastic￾covered bales.
F. J. Villalobos and E. Fereres545
Hay production requires a longer drying period. It starts with mowing and some￾times conditioning, followed by tedding (mixing and upturning) and windrowing 
(piling the plant material in rows). Finally, when the material is dry (15–25% of 
water), baling is performed. The time to dry has to be minimized to reduce respira￾tion losses. This time is proportional to forage biomass and inversely proportional 
to swath area and evaporative demand.
35.7 Harvest of Underground Organs
In this category, we include species that are harvested for their underground storage 
organs such as tubers (e.g., potato, yam), roots (sugar beet, turnip, cassava), and 
bulbs (onion, garlic).
Harvesting of underground organs should be performed around physiological 
maturity when little green area is left, although there are trade-offs between matu￾rity and market targets; for instance, in some areas, potatoes may be harvested ear￾lier than at maturity to fetch better prices even though some yield is sacrifced. 
Removal or killing of the shoot before harvest enhances periderm thickening of 
tubers which reduces the risk of peeling or bruising during harvest. Some root crops 
such as carrots are harvested when their size is adequate for the market.
The harvest process of underground organs includes cutting, digging, and lifting. 
The product may be transferred directly to a trailer after separating soil and plant 
residues or left in the feld for drying.
As opposed to seeds, desiccation of harvested underground organs should be 
prevented under storage. As water loss is proportional to Vapor Pressure Defcit, it 
will be reduced by applying cool moist air.
35.8 Harvest of Fruits and Vegetables
Fruits for the fresh market are usually collected by hand when they reach the desired 
size and are approaching ripening. Quality considerations are critical in some crops 
such as wine grapes. Here, harvest is delayed until a certain sugar content is reached 
in the grapes, as determined by periodic monitoring, and/or the desired colors are 
achieved. In olive oil production, early harvest produces higher-quality oil as 
demanded by markets (more fruity) at the expense of lower oil content in the fruit 
and thus lower oil yields. An important difference between species is the increase in 
respiration and production of ethylene during ripening. Climacteric fruits (e.g., 
pear; Appendix) can ripen off the plant once they have reached physiological matu￾rity, so they can be harvested at any time after reaching marketable size and ripened 
later or they may be harvested when fully ripe. Non-climacteric fruits (e.g., orange) 
complete ripening on the plant, so harvest must be delayed until then.
Fruits for processing (canning, dried, preserves, oil extraction, juice) may be 
mechanically harvested (e.g., using shakers) when ripe.
35 Harvest and Conservation546
Harvest of nut trees occurs after physiological maturity considering two factors: 
the decreasing water content and the formation of an abscission zone to promote 
fruit detachment at harvest time. Delaying harvest leads to a signifcant fruit drop, 
causing a fraction of the fruits to be on the ground with increased costs. Nut harvest￾ers are usually based on shaking the tree and collecting the fruits on inverted umbrel￾las or lateral boards before they are transferred to a trailer.

36 Cropping and Farming Systems
Helena Gomez-Macpherson, Francisco J. Villalobos , 
and Elias Fereres
Abstract
Cropping systems can be based on a single crop (monoculture) or many (polyc￾ulture), including intercrops and rotations. Intercrops are rarely used in Western 
agriculture although they offer several advantages (better use of resources, 
improved nutrient cycling) that are quantifed by the Land Equivalent Ratio 
(LER). Agroforestry systems are a case of intercrop in which trees provide pro￾tection to the soil, improve the crop nutrient balance, and can generate additional 
useful products. Rotations involve crop diversifcation in time and have many 
advantages over monoculture (control of weeds, pests, and diseases, improved 
nutrition, risk diversifcation). Farming systems have interlinked components of 
inputs and outputs managed to achieve economic agricultural production to meet 
enterprise and/or household requirements. Cropping and farming systems can 
provide other ecosystem services beyond the production of food or other 
products.
36.1 Introduction
During the twentieth century, agriculture evolved from low-input agriculture to 
intensive systems with high inputs of energy, inorganic fertilizers, and pesticides. 
During the 1960s and 1970s, the Green Revolution exported successfully this type

of agriculture to less developed countries, mainly in the tropics. Despite their suc￾cess, these agricultural systems that seek maximum yield have raised doubts, so 
alternative and more sustainable systems have been proposed aimed at long-term 
yield stability with minimal environmental impact. A sustainable system must have 
some of the characteristics of a mature ecosystem (e.g., diversity) but considering 
that nutrients are exported with crop products and have to be returned as inputs 
(fertilizers) to maintain long-term soil fertility. A sustainable intensifcation is pos￾sible if natural resources and imported inputs are used effciently while the soil and 
water quality are maintained or even improved. Understanding other farm ecosys￾tem services and trade-offs at the farming system scale can help implement more 
sustainable cropping systems and design better policies to support targeted changes.
36.2 Types of Cropping Systems
The cropping system refers to the crops, their sequence, and the management 
practices on a given feld. One type of cropping system is continuous monocropping 
(or monoculture) in which the feld is cultivated with the same species every year. 
This is characteristic of large areas of North and South America (e.g., the US Corn 
Belt) and often is based on high inputs of energy and fertilizers. Sometimes, particu￾larly in arid conditions, the crop is cultivated every other year leaving a long fallow 
period in between. On the other extreme, we fnd multiple (mixed) cropping systems 
that have in-common crop diversifcation in time and/or space. Multiple cropping is 
the oldest form of agriculture and remains a common practice in many tropical 
areas. In most developed countries, multiple cropping has disappeared and crop 
rotations, i.e., two or more crops grown sequentially in the same feld, are more 
common. In this case, the diversifcation is only performed over time.
Multiple cropping variations are characterized by the number of crops per year 
and the degree of crop overlap. Double cropping or triple cropping means systems 
with two or three crops grown sequentially in a single year with no overlap in cycles. 
For example, in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, farmers may cultivate two crops of rice in 
1 year, the main one during the monsoon season followed by another irrigated with 
a shorter cycle, or rice followed by wheat and then by berseem in 1 year. In this case, 
the production goal is not high yields for any crop but maximum yield per unit time 
(from kg/ha to kg/ha/day). Intercropping indicates that two or more crops are grown 
with partial or full overlap of their growing cycles. Relay cropping refers to the 
planting of a second crop before the frst is harvested so the two crops ft a single 
season or year. When a crop is allowed to regrow after harvest from the crowns or 
roots, the term ratoon cropping is used. This is the case for cereals with this regrowth 
capacity (e.g., barley) or sugarcane.
Service crops can be included for improving sustainability with no economic or 
subsistence interest. For example, cover crops can be established to reduce runoff 
and protect the soil against erosion in periods of high rainfall when the crop is not 
present, to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching during fallow periods (catch crops), 
and to provide habitats for pollinating insects or as green manure to improve soil 
H. Gomez-Macpherson et al.551
quality. Service crops usually fll the time windows between the main crops or 
occupy feld borders.
36.3 Intercropping
Intercropping is the simultaneous cultivation of two or more crops in the same feld 
to use resources more effciently and space out labor demand. Intercropping encour￾ages biodiversity in the paddock, which should increase stability. In Europe, inter￾cropping is present in pastures (mixtures of clover and grasses), backyard vegetable 
gardens, and fruit orchards (alley cropping) but uncommon in feld crops. The lim￾ited extent of intercropping can be explained, frstly, because the levels of soil fertil￾ity and the availability of inorganic fertilizers are high making it diffcult to fnd a 
productive advantage. Secondly, intercropping hardly compensates for the additional 
management diffculties and higher costs. However, organic production regulation 
in Europe is expected to increase interest in intercropping, including grain produc￾tion for feeding. This new interest should not mean returning to old systems but 
developing innovative technology-oriented new organic farming.
In developing countries in the tropics, intercropping is relatively common, gen￾erally combining a legume with a cereal. Legumes are intercropped in low fertile 
soils because of their N fxation ability. In Sahel, sorghum or millet is commonly 
sown with cowpea. The cereal grain is used for food, the straw as fodder, and the 
cowpea leaves and grain for fodder and food. In wetter environments, maize may be 
combined with high-value food legumes such as groundnuts or green gram. Other 
combinations of plant types that can use resources more effciently are (i) deep- and 
shallow-rooted crops; (ii) tall and short crops, the last being able to grow in partial 
shade; (iii) climbing crop on a tall crop, for example, beans around maize; (iv) alley 
cropping; and (v) fast- and slow-growing crops so that the fast one is harvested 
before the slow one reaches maturity.
Intercropping systems must be carefully designed to limit competition for light, 
water, and nutrients. Intercropping also poses challenges to fulfll increased labor 
requirements or to mechanizing operations, particularly harvesting. The following 
elements should be considered to minimize competition and maximize complemen￾tarity during their cycles:
• The spatial arrangement:
– Mixed cropping: The plants of the different species are distributed randomly 
in the feld, for example, vetch-oat association as a forage crop.
– Row intercropping: Two or more crops growing together with at least one 
crop planted in rows. Includes alley cropping and strip intercropping, with 
strips wide enough to facilitate the use of machines but close enough to inter￾act. In this category, we fnd also relay intercropping, establishing a second 
crop into a standing crop before its harvest.
• Plant density: It should be reduced compared to single cropping but less in the 
main crop.
36 Cropping and Farming Systems552
• Crop cycle/sowing date: Crops with different cycles or sowing dates would result in 
different peak demands of nutrients, water, and light so crop competition is reduced.
• Plant architecture: This is a key element when considering light competition and 
the possibility of using one crop as a support structure for other climbing crops.
• Proper management, i.e., adequate fertilization at optimal times, localized if 
there is spatial arrangement in rows, effective weed, and pest control and eff￾cient harvesting with minimum damage to crops still growing.
The potential benefts from intercropping are the following:
• Reducing the risk from pests, extreme weather events, and price fuctuations. 
Apart from reducing risk by diversifcation, the population of natural biotic pest 
control agents (predators, parasites) is usually increased in intercropping.
• More effcient use of resources (light, water, and nutrients) in time and space due 
to the different resource requirements of the components. For example, a com￾plex architecture cover can enhance the interception of light. The intensive use of 
resources by the intercrop also reduces their availability to weeds.
• Improved nutrient cycling: The combination of species with different temporal 
patterns of nutrient absorption reduces leaching. Moreover, crops with deep root 
systems absorb nutrients from deeper layers. Some of these nutrients then return 
to the soil surface after mineralization of the crop residues and can then be used 
by other crops with shallow root systems.
Intercropping advantages regarding pests and diseases are not clear in all cases. 
The number of parasites and predators increases with the number of plant species, 
but also the number of potentially harmful insect and fungi species may increase. 
The problem can be especially severe in the case of soil fungi. When the host plant 
is always present, the survival of pathogens is ensured. In the case of aerial diseases, 
a plant of a different species acts as a barrier to spore dispersal.
The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) is used to quantify the effectiveness of inter￾cropping systems. It is calculated as:

where K is the number of crops and YIi and YPi are the yields as intercrop and 
pure stand, respectively, for crop i. There is an advantage in intercropping if LER is 
above 1, which typically occurs when the soil resources (water and/or nutrients) are 
limiting and the species differ in their pattern of root growth or when one species is 
a legume. There is a disadvantage in using intercropping if LER is below 1.
The advantage of intercropping depends on the relative abundance of the different 
components. For example, in Table  36.1, yield and LER of vetch (legume) 
and oats (cereal) mixtures in the region of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) are shown. In 
this case, LER is only greater than 1 when the proportion of oats is 20% or lower, 
because oats in small proportions serve to support vetch growth as it is a creeping 
plant, so both species beneft. However, when the proportion of oats is high, this spe￾cies has a competitive advantage because of its greater height as compared to vetch.

Example 36.1
Maize and soybean were intercropped for silage in Canada. Intercrops were 
more cost-effective than pure stands although their success depended on seed￾ing rate and spatial arrangement. The best performance was observed using 
67% of the recommended planting density for pure stand in both crops. The 
resulting LER was 1.14. When mixed crops are intended for silage produc￾tion, harvesting is not a problem as silage quality improves mixing comple￾menting crops.
Example 36.2
In the United States, alternating strips of maize, soybean, and spring wheat in 
a ridge-till system were tested. The strip width was adapted to the equipment 
widths and herbicides were applied with a ground sprayer. The orientation of 
the strip was also a key to the system’s success. The best combination was 
E-W-oriented strips of wheat-maize-soybean, with soybeans on the north side 
of maize. Wheat was harvested before maize plants could shade it. Maize 
rows next to the soybean strip profted from additional incident light.
Example 36.3
Backyard garden combinations. When radish and carrot seeds are sown 
together, radishes germinate, grow quickly, and are harvested when carrots 
are just getting established. Lettuce plants tolerate shade so they are suited to 
interplanting among larger vegetables. Young tomato plants may be planted 
among declining pea vines to replace them on the trellis. Intercropping two 
vegetables with different architecture and nutritional value such as beet-okra 
or pepper-onion is practiced in tropical Asia.
36 Cropping and Farming Systems554
36.4 Agroforestry Systems
The practice of including trees in farming systems is an old form of intercropping 
still common in many parts of the world. Agroforestry systems are a good opportu￾nity, especially in tropical areas, to increase sustainability.
Overall, an agroforestry system is more stable than other cropping systems. 
Trees protect the soil and the crop from the direct effect of wind and rain and 
improve the nutrient balance. If trees (e.g., Acacia spp.) or shrubs (e.g., Leucaena
spp.) from the Leguminosae family are used, they contribute to nitrogen supply. 
Trees can also provide food (seeds) and frewood.
The need to conserve the soil in many agricultural systems worldwide will likely 
lead to a return to farming systems where trees and annual plants that act as protec￾tive covers from erosion are associated. In Europe, the European Silvoarable
Agroforestry For Europe (SAFE) project has described many different alley crop￾ping or agroforestry systems in the region. The equivalent dehesa in Spain and 
montado in Portugal is a good example of agroforestry in which oaks, pastures, 
crops, and livestock interact and complement each other. There are other examples 
of associated crops with little presence in developed countries. Cover crops are also 
common in orchards, particularly in areas prone to soil erosion.
In Kenya, fruit trees are intercropped with all types of herbaceous crops such as 
beans, peas, potatoes, maize, millet, and exotic and indigenous vegetables when 
they are still young as a way of attaining food security and income before the trees 
mature. Bananas may be intercropped with sweet potato and beans to reduce the 
incidence of weevils and nematodes and with Grevillea robusta for wood.
36.5 Crop Rotations
A crop rotation is a sequence of crops over time, repeated cyclically or not. The 
advantages of a crop rotation compared to monoculture are partly similar to those of 
intercropping:
– Better use of resources (water and nutrients) or improving fertility if legumes are 
included.
– Better control of weeds, pests, and diseases.
– Risk diversifcation.
– Better distribution of the means of production on the farm.
The choice of crop rotation is to be based primarily on economic factors. 
That being said, the species and their order in the rotation should consider the 
following aspects:
H. Gomez-Macpherson et al.555
(a) Duration of the cycles and environmental requirements of the species.
There is considerable variability among species and within species in the 
crop cycle duration and adaptability to climatic conditions. For temperate areas, 
the following classifcation can be made regarding sowing dates periods of the 
different species:
– Autumn-winter planting:
Winter cereals: wheat, barley, rye, oats, triticale.
Grain legumes: broad bean, pea, chickpea, lentil.
Oilseeds: rapeseed, saffower, fax.
– Spring planting:
Grains: maize, sorghum, rice.
Oilseeds: soybean, sunfower.
Some species may belong to different categories depending on the climatic char￾acteristics of the area. Sugar beet is sown in autumn in mild winter areas (e.g., south 
of Spain) and in the spring in colder areas like in most European countries. Winter 
cereals with low vernalization requirements may also be sown in early spring in 
cold areas or late autumn in the Mediterranean region.
This classifcation should not be taken strictly as the trend over the last 20 years 
has been to advance the date of sowing of spring crops. For instance, when sun￾fower was introduced in Spain in the 1960s, it was regarded as a spring crop planted 
in April or May, while today it is planted in many areas in February or March. 
Summer crops such as maize are sown in some areas of mild climates (California, 
Spain) 2 months earlier than 30 years ago. This is also due to the increased tolerance 
of this crop to suboptimal temperatures as it is being increasingly grown in the cool 
environments of the higher latitudes. The adoption of other cultural techniques like 
plastic mulching may allow an advance on the planting date of some species (e.g., 
cotton in the Guadalquivir Valley in Southern Spain).
(b) Time required for preparing the sowing of the following crop.
After harvesting a crop, a series of operations for soil preparation (residue 
management, primary tillage, seedbed preparation) can signifcantly delay the 
planting of the next crop. This time may be reduced by direct seeding the fol￾lowing crop (e.g., direct seeded wheat after rice harvest in South Asia).
(c) Ecological characteristics (e.g., rooting depth) and management of differ￾ent crops.
Alternating crops planted in narrow (e.g., cereals) and wider rows (e.g., sun￾fower) has been recommended traditionally to control weed populations. For 
pest and disease control, repeating the same (or similar) crop in the same feld 
should be avoided in consecutive years. Crop rotation is a good tool to reduce

the incidence of pests and diseases, particularly soilborne pathogens, as the 
absence of the host plant causes a strong reduction in the inoculum in the soil. 
Some Cruciferae crops (and weeds) generate glucosinolates such as isothiocya￾nates, which have insecticide and fungicide effects, therefore providing a clean￾ing effect on the soil.
(d) Use and conservation of resources.
The cropping system should help to prevent losses of water and soil nutri￾ents. The current situation in European agriculture can promote the adoption of 
more conservative cropping systems. Some crop management practices can be 
very useful although they are negative a priori. For example, in rainy areas 
where nitrogen is the limiting factor, keeping a clean fallow increases nitrate 
leaching. If weeds are left in the feld, they will capture N in organic form and 
reduce soil water content, which reduces deep percolation and therefore N 
leaching. The same objective is achieved with catch crops that “capture” N in 
periods of high leaching risk.
The inclusion of long clean fallows (uncultivated land free of weeds) is justifed 
only in areas with very low rainfall as leaving the soil bare increases the potential 
for soil erosion and N leaching. In principle, the rotation should keep the soil pro￾tected by a crop canopy or residues during the rainy period or when winds are strong.
The inclusion of legumes in the rotation improves N supply. The contribution is 
more important when the legume is incorporated into the soil as green manure 
which also helps increase the organic matter content. Deep root crops may use N 
left by shallow root crops.
The effects of some crops over others in a rotation are sometimes unclear as even 
the rotation of different cultivars of the same species is positive. This interaction is 
related to maintaining a large microbial soil biomass capable of rapid 
mineralization.
In summary, the primary concern for designing crop rotations is the farmer’s 
proft, i.e., reducing costs and optimizing farm production means, but the design 
should be fexible enough to accommodate possible changes and suit the environ￾mental and management (e.g., soil conservation) conditions.
36.6 Farming Systems
A farming system is a population of farms with similar resource bases, enterprise 
patterns, household livelihoods, and constraints. The following characteristics can 
be considered to classify a farming system, on one hand the available natural 
resource base, including water, land, grazing areas, and forest; climate; farm size 
and landscape; land tenure; mechanization and labor availability; and connection to 
transport networks; on the other hand the dominant farm activities, including annual, 
orchards and vegetable crops, livestock, processing and off-farm activities; and the 
technologies used often related to intensive production or to integrate different 
activities.
H. Gomez-Macpherson et al.557
In subsistence farming systems, farmers produce food for themselves and their 
families and there is no proft, for example, rice production in Bangladesh or rainfed 
sorghum-cowpea in Sahel, whereas in commercial farming, farmers sell their crops 
and animals to make a proft as in most European farming systems. In general, 
intensive systems require high inputs of capital, labor, or technology to achieve high 
outputs or yields per hectare; the farms are usually small, like in protected horticul￾ture in Almeria or pig production in Denmark. Extensive systems are, however, 
characterized by low use of inputs, large areas of land, and low outputs or yields per 
hectare, for example, wheat-sunfower production in the rainfed areas of Southern 
Spain. Arable systems are dedicated to growing crops, and pastoral systems to ani￾mal production, and in mixed systems, farmers grow crops and rear animals. 
Sedentary are the systems where the settlement is permanent and the landscape is 
farmed every year, whereas nomadic farmers move around looking for fresh pasture 
or new felds to cultivate. There are extensive subsistence systems, for example, 
nomadic pastoralism in Africa and Central Asia, or intensive subsistence systems, 
for example, rice-based farming systems in Sahel. Among the most complex are 
rainfed systems in humid tropics of high resource potential, characterized by a crop 
activity (typically cereals, cassava, banana, coffee, etc., at small scale or in planta￾tions, and commercial horticulture), often mixed with livestock production.
A farming system represents a resource management strategy to achieve eco￾nomic and sustainable agricultural production to meet some household require￾ments. Farming systems are not static as they have interlinked components of inputs 
and outputs through processes (Fig. 36.1). System management should give each 
crop its best chance of expressing its potential, and the spatial diversifcation of 
crops and farm activities results in more effcient use of resources as well as risk 
diversifcation. For this, an understanding of the system is required, frstly the 
inputs, processes, and outputs and then the infuence of natural (soil, slope, rain, 
temperature, sunshine, etc.) and human inputs (labor, machinery, energy, political, 
etc.) on the processes and outputs. Their combined effects on the scale of produc￾tion, methods of organization, and the products should be understood for optimizing 
the system, also in the mid and long term.
Understanding farm household decision-making is essential for targeting 
research, fostering innovation, and accelerating the adoption of innovations. How to 
manipulate natural inputs to use them optimally and avoid any waste? Could more 
inputs supporting diseases, weeds, and pests be reallocated to grain? Are diseases 
building up, and should a change in crop rotation be considered to control pests and 
diseases? Can spatial variation be profted for better adjustment of activities and 
diversifcation? Could the crop stubble be used to increase production of the next 
crops? Could water inputs be used more effciently for producing grain? Is the man￾agement system environmentally sustainable or are soil and water resources being 
gradually downgraded or overused? Is current irrigation management progressively 
increasing soil salinity? Are the yield targets too high for the location? Would a 
lower yield target lead to a more effcient use of resources?

36.7 Agricultural Ecosystem Services
The ecosystem services concept was proposed in the 1980s and developed concep￾tually in the late 1990s for improving the identifcation and valuation of benefts 
obtained by society, from functioning ecosystems. In the case of agriculture, eco￾system services go beyond producing food, fber, oil, or wood (provisioning ser￾vices) and include regulating services (e.g., water regulation and purifcation, air 
purifcation, climate regulation), cultural services (e.g., recreation, aesthetic values, 
tourism), or those needed to maintain the previous three, i.e., the supporting ser￾vices (e.g., soil formation, nutrient cycling, or refugia of fauna).
The ecosystem services approach is generally used for designing outcomes￾based policies that rely on more than just a fnancial cost-beneft analysis. However, 
giving value to ecosystem services is not straightforward as the connections between 
ecosystem processes and benefts to humans are complex. Knowledge is required of 
how decisions affect individuals and the community and the derived trade-offs. 
There are methodologies for valuing and assessing negative and positive effects at 
these scales. Valuations can combine values expressed in units (monetary, labor, 
time) or relative terms through indicators, for example, the number of benefciaries, 
H. Gomez-Macpherson et al.559
their preferences, the cost of maintaining access to the service or changing to alter￾natives. Additionally, individuals or groups can be confronted with hypothetical 
scenarios that affect an ecosystem and its services, vote on available options, and 
then infer the values of the services from these choices.

37 Energy Consumption in Agriculture
Francisco J. Villalobos and Luca Testi
Abstract
Agriculture requires energy in different forms and for different purposes. The 
energy requirement may be decomposed into a direct (consumption of fuel or 
electricity at the farm) and an indirect component, associated with machinery 
manufacture and maintenance, equipment, and inputs (fertilizers, pesticides). 
Energy consumption of a given tillage operation depends on the tilled depth, soil 
type, and water content. Primary tillage and harvesting require much more 
energy than secondary operations. Pressurized irrigation systems require more 
energy than surface systems. However, the lower pressure and energy required in 
drip when compared to sprinkler irrigation is partly compensated by a lower 
indirect component for the latter. Additional energy may be spent on improving 
water quality. Fertilization is often the highest energy consumer for crop produc￾tion due to the manufacturing of fertilizers, in special N. When compared to the 
other components, human labor requires a negligible amount of energy.
The energy effciency of farming (energy captured per unit of energy con￾sumed in all farming operations and materials) may be analyzed in terms of the 
inputs and outputs of energy. The latter, the captured energy in the harvested 
product can be estimated as the product of yield and its energy content.
Energy requirements of crop rotations may be performed using CropEBal, a 
free Windows application.

37.1 Introduction
The great leap forward in agricultural productivity that occurred in the XX century 
was partly due to the increased energy consumption, mostly using fossil fuels. The 
use of machinery and synthetic fertilizers, and the development of new irrigated 
areas with pressurized methods (sprinkler, drip), explain the need for large energy 
inputs. In many cases, those are associated with CO2 emissions, a major con￾cern today.
We distinguish between direct (on-farm) and indirect (off-farm) energy con￾sumption. Another possible distinction deals with the origin of the energy: renew￾able versus nonrenewable.
Despite the continuing increase in the use of renewable energy, agriculture still 
requires fuel as the only effcient alternative for machinery, thus the importance of 
reducing energy use per unit area and unit of product harvested. To do that, we need 
to understand the main factors affecting the amount of direct and indirect energy 
required by different operations or materials used in agriculture. This way, we may 
design and compare management alternatives. For instance, we need to know if 
moving from conventional to conservation tillage helps in reducing the energy 
requirement. We may also wonder if developing new irrigated areas is sustainable in 
terms of energy if we adopt a given irrigation method. In this chapter, we will ana￾lyze the different components of the energy requirement of agricultural production.
37.2 Energy Requirements of Farming
The energy balance of a feld may be analyzed in terms of the energy requirements 
associated to the different agricultural practices and the fnal energy stored in crop 
products. Energy requirements may be direct (fuel used, energy spent in pumping 
water) or indirect (energy spent in production of inputs, machinery, or equipment). 
Each category may be also divided in a variable component (being proportional to 
input rate) and a fxed component (not dependent on input rate). Therefore:
E E req d = + irfix d E E ir var i + + nd fix i End var (37.1)
Table 37.1 summarizes the types of energy inputs associated to different farm 
operations. For instance, the application of a pesticide requires a fxed direct input 
of energy to run the tractor, a fxed indirect input associated to tractor and machine 
manufacturing and maintenance, and a variable indirect input, the one of manufac￾turing pesticides that depends on the dose applied.
Table 37.2 shows some energy coeffcients useful for calculating the energy 
requirements of the farm.

37.3 Energy Requirements of Tillage
Primitive tillage was based only on human power with hand tools. It frst evolved to 
the ard with draft animals and then to the plow until now, when tillage is carried out 
with powerful tractors that require external energy sources (fossil fuel).
Apart from the risk of compaction, tillage has been questioned because it 
increases soil erosion risk and for its large energy expenditure. These negative 
37 Energy Consumption in Agriculture564
effects have fostered the adoption of reduced tillage systems (see Chap. 18). In the 
previous section, we discussed the classifcation of energy inputs in agricultural 
operations. In the case of tillage, only two components are relevant to calculate 
energy requirements per unit land area:
E E req dir E E ind fuel E E ind tractor ind machine = + = + + ( ) ( ) (37.2)
The direct component is the energy in fuel consumed and the indirect component is 
that corresponding to manufacturing, maintenance, and repair of the machinery 
(tractor and implement or machine). The calculation of indirect energy require￾ments (MJ ha−1
) may be performed with the following equation:
E E
M EM
L MFC
M ind tractor ind machine
tractor tractor
tractor
( ) ( ) + = + machine machine
machine
EM
L MFC (37.3)
where M is mass (kg), EM is the ratio of energy required and mass (MJ/kg), L is the 
useful life (hour), and MFC is the machine feld capacity (ha/hour). Using average 
values of these parameters, we have calculated the indirect energy requirements of 
different operations shown in Table 37.3). Typical values of direct requirements are 
also presented for comparison. These data should be taken as an example. Actual 
direct requirements will be higher when tillage is performed under conditions 
departing from optimal (see Sect. 17.3). Actual indirect requirements may differ if 
the parameters M, EM, L or MFC change. The consumption of energy increases 
with the use of high-power tractor for small operations and with deeper tillage and 
depends on the shape of teeth or disks of implements.
Many studies on energy requirements of agricultural practices ignore the energy 
associated to human labor. Table 37.3 also shows the energy required for labor cal￾culated as:
E EH
MFC labor = (37.4)

The value of EH, the energy required per human, has been taken as 1 MJ h−1
F. J. Villalobos and L. Testi565
where EH is the energy required per human (MJ h−1
) (see 37.6). The fraction of 
energy due to labor is negligible.
The relative importance of tillage in the energy requirements of farming is lim￾ited, as indicated in Example 37.1.
Example 37.1
A rainfed wheat farm produces 2500 kg grain/ha (dry matter basis) with a 
total energy requirement of 14,779 MJ ha−1
 (1500 for tillage; 1900 for sow￾ing, harvest, and other operations; 9613 for fertilizer; 1050 for seed; and 716 
for pesticides). In this case, tillage is limited to one plowing and one pass of 
cultivator, so the fraction of energy used in tillage is only 10% of the total, 
thanks to the use of herbicides. Even with intensive tillage, its share of energy 
is small as compared to the energy inputs in fertilizers. Therefore, the adop￾tion of reduced or no tillage should be primarily promoted for improving soil 
conditions rather than for saving energy.
37.4 Energy Requirements of Irrigation
The energy requirement (MJ ha−1
 year−1
) for irrigation may be calculated as:
E g I H H E E
p m
irrig w = + ater ( ) lift op + + ind fix ind var
− ρ
µ µ
10 1 2 6 . (37.5)
where:
ρwater: density of water (103
 kg m−3
),
g: acceleration of gravity (9.81 m s−2
),
10−6
 is used to convert from J to MJ
I: seasonal applied irrigation (m3
 ha−1
).
μp: pump effciency (typically between 0.6 and 0.8),
μm: motor effciency, which we may assume 0.4 for diesel and 0.9 for electric 
engines,
Hlift: the energy required to lift water from the water source (m). It is roughly equal 
to water table depth for groundwater and negligible for surface water sources.
Hop: operating pressure of the irrigation method (m). We may use typical values of 
10–25 m for drip and 30–40 m for sprinklers. The coeffcient 1.2 is based on the 
assumption that 20% additional energy is required to keep enough pressure in the 
whole network.
Eind fx: energy spent in the manufacturing and installation of the irrigation system 
divided by its life span. We may use values of 7000–9000  MJ  ha−1
  year−1
for 
sprinkler and 13,000 MJha−1
 year−1
 for drip irrigation. For surface irrigation, we 
should add here the energy required for land levelling and for shaping the ridges.
37 Energy Consumption in Agriculture566
Eind var: energy spent in desalination (if needed) and in delivering the water to the 
farm, which is proportional to the amount of irrigation applied:
E c I ind var w = (37.6)
where cw is the energy spent per volume unit of water. Therefore, we can calculate 
the energy requirement for irrigation as the sum of two terms, one variable and 
one fxed:

µ µ (37.7)
Example 37.2
A farm is irrigated using good quality water from a canal. During extended 
droughts, the canal stops the supply, but water may be obtained from a nearby 
brackish lagoon after desalination. The farmer irrigates maize with 7000 m3
/
ha/year, using a center pivot (Hop = 35 m, Eind fx = 8000 MJ/ha/year) using 
electric motors (μm = 0.9) and pumps with μp of 0.8. Hlift is negligible as the 
source is at ground level. Using Eq. 37.7, in normal years, desalinization is 
not needed (cw = 0) so the energy spent in irrigation is 12,000 MJ/ha/year. 
During drought periods, the water comes from the desalination plant 
(cw = 7 MJ/ m3
) and the total energy required is 61,000 MJ/ha/year, i.e., partial 
desalination multiplies the energy spent by 5. If the plant was processing sea￾water (cw = 12 MJ/ m3
), the energy required would be 96,000 MJ/ha/year. 
Irrigation with desalinized water is not sustainable unless the desalination 
plant runs on renewable energy.
37.5 Energy Requirements of Fertilization
The energy requirement of fertilization (MJ ha−1
 year−1
) is calculated as:
E n fert = + f a A N c P N a + + c K P a c E K + ind (37.8)
where
nf: the number of applications of fertilizer,
A: the energy consumption as fuel in each application (MJ ha−1
).
Na, Pa, Ka: amounts of N, P, and K (kg ha−1
 year−1
) applied.
cN, cP, cK: energy required for producing and transporting the fertilizers (MJ/kg N, 
MJ/kg P, MJ/kg K),
F. J. Villalobos and L. Testi567
Eind: energy spent in the manufacturing, repair, and maintenance of the fertilizer 
spreader or injector divided by its life span.
37.6 Energy Requirements of Human Labor
The energy spent in human labor is not easy to calculate. An average human being 
needs between 10 and 15 MJ day−1
 of energy as food. In the frst edition of this 
book, we adopted the concept of embedded energy for this calculation. However, 
although widely accepted, the embedded energy theory may not meet the principle 
of conservation of matter and energy. Therefore, we assume that energy associated 
to labor is equal to the increase of energy expenditure when humans perform hand 
labor as compared to energy expenditure for low activity. This increase may be 
around 4 MJ/day, so we have adopted a general value of 1 MJ/h labor (8 h/day with 
50% effciency in conversion from food). When agricultural activities are based 
mostly on labor, the total energy associated is small as compared to that of 
other inputs.
Example 37.3
The average needs of human labor for manual harvesting of wheat (yield of 
6 t/ha) are around 500 hours/ha, while using just machinery, it is reduced to 
2 h/ha. The energy requirements of manual harvest are therefore 500 MJ/ha. 
If we use a combine, the energy requirements would be the sum of a human 
component (2 h × 1 MJ h−1
 person−1
) and a machine component (1146 MJ/ha, 
Table 37.3), which gives 1148 MJ/ha.
37.7 Farm Energy Outputs and Efficiency
The energy outputs of a farm may be computed according to different criteria. We 
usually consider only the energy contained in all materials exported from the farm, 
so the energy content of crop residues is ignored (unless they are sold for feed out￾side the farm) and so is the energy stored in soil organic matter. On the other hand, 
the energy content of a given material varies according to the use of the energy. We 
use values of gross energy which are close to the combustion energy of the material 
(Heating Value). Table 37.4 shows typical values of gross energy in crop products 
and crop residues. Apart from the composition of dry matter, an important factor in 
evaluating the energy content of biomass is its water content. The Heating Value 
(HV, MJ/kg fresh biomass) is calculated as:
HV = − ( ) 1 2 w w HCB− .45 (37.9)
where w is the water content of biomass (g water/g fresh biomass) and HCB is the 
heat content of biomass (MJ/kg dry matter) (Table 37.4).
37 Energy Consumption in Agriculture568
Table 37.4 Energy content in agricultural products and residues

Oil crops Seed 26–29 18.3–18.8
Sugar beet Root without crown 17 16.7
Tuber and root crops Tubers, roots 17 18–20
Crop species have been grouped whenever possible: grain cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize, mil￾lets, sorghum, rice, triticale), forage cereals (maize, sorghum), seed legumes (bean, cowpea, faba 
bean, lentil, pea, peanut, chickpea), forage legumes (clover, alfalfa), oil crops (saffower, rapeseed, 
sunfower, fax), tuber, and root crops (potato, cassava, yam, sweet potato)
The total energy output will be the product of yield and the energy content of the harvested product
Example 37.4
In the case shown in Example 37.1, wheat yield is 2500 kg grain/ha (dry mat￾ter) and the total energy requirements are 14,779 MJ/ha. If both grain and 
straw are exported, the output is 88,750 MJ/ha and the ratio output/input is 
6.0. If only the grain is exported, the output/input ratio is 3.1. In both cases, 
the energy balance of farming is positive (more energy produced than 
consumed).
37.8 CropEBal
CropEBal is a Windows application to calculate the energy inputs of all agricultural 
operations and materials and the energy outputs from the farm. The calculations are 
based on the equations in this chapter and ASAE (2000). The program has been 
tested on computers running Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11. It includes a list of 149 crops.
The application is a standalone program. It is completely free and may be down￾loaded from https://www.uco.es/ftotecnia/cropebal.html.
The program frst opens a form with a list of crops. The user may add as many 
crops to the rotation as needed. The selected crops are shown along with data on 
gross energy, protein, fat, ash, and percent of residues remaining in the feld after 
harvest. The user has to supply the expected yield and the seed rate and mark if resi￾dues are burned.
Once the crop information is flled, the user has to indicate the soil type. If irriga￾tion is performed, the user indicates the method, the source of water, and some data 
related to pumping. The second form allows the user to pick a sowing method and a 
F. J. Villalobos and L. Testi569
set of tillage operations. The user may specify the depth and spacing between the 
tillage tools.
A third form allows selection operations related to fertilization, spraying, and 
harvest. The needs for additional labor, transport, or product drying are also 
contemplated.
Finally, the main results (required energy inputs for each operation type and 
material) and the energy captured in the product are presented in a text fle.

Remote sensing is obtaining information about an object without physical con￾tact, typically carried out with sensors onboard satellites, aircraft, or land-based 
platforms. Today, several technologies can be integrated into these carriers to 
map and monitor different plant biophysical traits with high spatial and temporal 
resolution.
New sensors and information and communication technologies provide 
opportunities to refne agronomic management and advance agricultural research. 
Understanding the nature and limitations of the available technologies is essen￾tial for their correct use in applications such as precision agriculture. These tech￾niques rely on identifying relationships between the sensor signals and plant 
traits such as biochemical composition, architecture, and water status. Depending 
on the type of sensor, we may use vegetation indices, physical models, or machine 
learning algorithms. A new paradigm in plant science called phenomics is 
emerging, combining information on plant genotypes and the environment with 
remote sensing.

38.1 Introduction
Agriculture started around 10,000 years ago and since then, improvements in agri￾cultural technology have contributed to increasing its productivity. Intensive agri￾culture in the second half of the twentieth century achieved high productivity from 
high inputs but also had some important environmental impacts.
The next step in agricultural technology is based on proximal or remote sensors 
and computers that allow a more precise and/or effcient application of inputs in the 
feld. This is based on the improved knowledge of crop physiology and the advances 
in agronomy during the twentieth century. At this point, we see that agriculture 
evolved from low input/low control to high input/low control during the 1950–1960s 
and is now turning to optimal input based on high control. In this chapter, we review 
some of the technologies that improve crop production using remote sensing.
38.2 Basic Principles of Remote Sensing
Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object without physical 
contact. Although it has been generally related to the acquisition of images from 
satellite platforms, the term remote sensing is broader. It includes data collection 
from different platforms, from long distances (i.e., 36,000 km from the Earth using 
a satellite) or from just a few centimeters using a camera or an instrument close to 
the object (e.g., a leaf).
The remote sensing (RS) of objects is conducted through a physical carrier (elec￾tromagnetic radiation) that travels from the objects to the sensors through an inter￾vening medium (the atmosphere). Depending on the nature of the radiation used, we 
can distinguish i) active RS, when a signal is emitted and received by the sensor, and 
ii) passive RS, which uses naturally occurring radiation (e.g., refected from solar 
radiation).
Electromagnetic radiation is energy propagated through space between electric 
and magnetic felds. The electromagnetic spectrum is the extent of that energy rang￾ing from cosmic rays, gamma rays, and X-rays to ultraviolet, visible, and infrared 
radiation, including microwave energy as a function of their wavelength (Fig. 38.1).
Our eyes detect radiation in the so-called “visible” spectral region, ranging 
between 400 and 700 nm in wavelength. Nevertheless, some sensors can detect and 
measure radiation below or above the 400–700  nm region. Remote sensing of 
objects is generally conducted with sensors working in wavelengths in the ultravio￾let (UV) (below 400  nm), the visible region and then in the refected infrared 
(beyond 800 nm), thermal infrared (3–14 μm), and microwaves above the visible. 
Above the visible region, some sensors detect refected radiation while others detect 
emitted radiation used to measure the object’s temperature.
The collection of refected or emitted data by sensors needs to be conducted in 
the so-called “spectral bands.” Each detector is sensitive to a different range and 
number of these specifc spectral bands. The width in wavelength units and the 
number of these spectral bands enable the acquisition of data from objects in a

multispectral way. Multispectral RS is the collection of refected or emitted energy 
from an object in multiple electromagnetic spectral bands (Fig. 38.2). The more 
bands there are and the narrower these bands are, the more information is obtained 
from the object. When the detector can gather hundreds of bands contiguously 
throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, the technology used is called hyperspec￾tral remote sensing or imaging spectroscopy.
38.3 Reflectance and Spectral Signatures
The refected radiation measured by a sensor is a function of the total incoming 
radiation at that moment, i.e., the refected radiation by an object will change as the 
sun changes. For this reason, RS methods rely on normalizing such refected energy 
to the incoming radiation at the time of the measurement to calculate the spectral 
refectance. Spectral refectance is the ratio of radiation refected by a surface to the 
radiation incident on the surface. Remote sensing methods are based on this refec￾tance as a function of wavelength, developing the so-called spectral signatures 
(Fig. 38.3). In Fig. 38.3, we can observe the refectance measured from three objects: 
(i) green vegetation, (ii) dry vegetation, and (iii) soil. Refectance changes with 
wavelength, which depends on the plant pigments absorbing and refecting energy 
from the object under study, and other factors such as the leaf structure, soil back￾ground, and the vegetation canopy architecture. Analyzing these spectral signatures, 
it is possible to infer the status of the vegetation and soils by estimating the concen￾tration of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, xanthophylls), the 
density of vegetation layers (leaf area index, leaf area density), and other biochemi￾cal constituents such as the water and dry matter content of plants.

38.4 Remote Sensing Resolution
Four defnitions of RS resolution are critical to understanding the data quality and 
image characteristics: spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal.
Spatial resolution is the size of each pixel recorded in an image, typically corre￾sponding to square areas. The minimum detail discernible in an image depends on 
the sensor’s spatial resolution and refers to the size of the smallest possible feature 
that can be detected. The spatial resolution of passive sensors depends primarily on 
the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) of the system, which is comprised of the 
detector and the lens. The area on the ground represented in the pixel is called the 
resolution cell and determines a sensor’s maximum spatial resolution.
The spectral resolution is the wavelength width and the number of the different 
spectral bands recorded by the detector, which determine the spectral signatures 
used to assess the objects by remote sensing methods.
Radiometric resolution is the number of different intensities of radiation the sen￾sor can distinguish. Typically, this ranges from 8 to 14 bits, corresponding to 256 
levels of the grayscale and up to 16,384 intensities in each band. It also depends on 
the instrument noise.
Temporal resolution is the frequency of satellite or plane overpasses over the 
same place. The temporal resolution is relevant in time-series studies to understand 
seasonal changes.
38.5 Sensors and Platforms for Remote Sensing
The sensors are generally classifed as optical or microwave sensors.
Optical sensors detect visible and infrared radiation (IR) in three subregions: 
near IR, intermediate IR, and thermal IR. Two types of radiation can be measured 
from optical sensors: (i) visible/near IR (refected) and (ii) thermal IR (emitted).
In the visible and near IR region, the sensors detect radiation of sunlight refected 
by the objects which is used to quantify land surface conditions such as the distribu￾tion of plants, forests and farm felds, rivers, lakes, urban areas, etc. This technique 
can only be used during the daytime under clear-sky conditions.
In the thermal IR region, the detected radiation is that emitted by the objects, 
typically used to monitor the temperature of the land’s surface (see Chap. 3). It is 
not restricted to the daytime period but is affected by cloudiness.
Microwave sensors may be active or passive and are designed to measure radia￾tion in the microwave spectral region, with wavelengths longer than the infrared. 
The observation is not affected by period (day or night) or weather as microwaves 
penetrate the clouds.
38 Remote Sensing576
The platforms used for RS can be divided into the following classes:
(a) Proximal sensing platforms are used to acquire high spatial resolution imagery 
from towers, cherry pickers, trucks, and mobile platforms in the feld.
(b) Airborne platforms (i.e., planes of different sizes and weights) are generally 
used for acquiring imagery at typical altitudes between 300 m and a few kilo￾meters over the ground. They can be divided into piloted and unpiloted aerial 
vehicles.
(b.1) Piloted vehicles are the traditional platforms for aerial photography 
and remote sensing using heavy cameras working in the visible, near 
IR and thermal regions. Access to these sensors is limited as they have 
a high cost of operation, so they are generally used for research pur￾poses and less often for operational applications. Sensors in these plat￾forms are very expensive, but they obtain high-quality imagery for 
validating remote sensing models and methods.
(b.2) Unpiloted aerial vehicles (also called as UAV, UAS), also known as 
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAS) or “drones,” are the result of trans￾ferring this technology from the military to civil applications. These 
drones are small planes that can fy autonomously over desired areas 
at low altitudes, therefore acquiring high-resolution imagery using 
miniature sensors carried onboard. Wingspan and weight for these 
platforms range between less than a meter up to 5 m, and under 2 kg 
up to several hundred kilograms. The sensors weigh between a few 
grams to several kilograms, and they are currently available to collect 
images from drones in the visible, near IR and thermal regions. Despite 
the legal limitations on drones for civil applications, they offer high 
fexibility in acquiring low-cost imagery, higher spatial resolution, and 
easy operation by end users.
(c) The satellite platforms follow typically elliptical orbits around the Earth. The 
time taken to complete one revolution of the orbit is called the orbital period. 
The satellite traces a path on the Earth’s surface as it moves across the sky. As 
the Earth below is rotating, the satellite traces a different path on the ground in 
each subsequent cycle. Remote sensing satellites are launched into orbits such 
that the satellite repeats its path after a fxed time interval. This time interval is 
called the repeat cycle of the satellite.
When a satellite follows an orbit parallel to the equator in the same direction as 
the Earth’s rotation and with the same period of 24 h, the satellite will appear sta￾tionary to the Earth’s surface (geostationary orbit), so it will be positioned all the 
time over the same spot on Earth. Satellites in the geostationary orbits are located at 
a high altitude of 36,000 km. They are commonly used for weather observations as 
they can monitor large areas continuously, i.e., acquiring one image of the same area 
every 30–60 min.
P. J. Zarco-Tejada and J. A. Jimenez-Berni577
A near-polar orbit is one with the orbital plane inclined at a small angle to the 
Earth’s rotation axis. A satellite following a properly designed near-polar orbit 
passes close to the poles and can cover nearly the whole Earth’s surface in a repeat 
cycle. Nevertheless, Earth observation satellites usually follow sun-synchronous 
orbits, i.e., an orbit whose altitude is such that the satellite will always pass over a 
location at a given latitude at the same local solar time. In this way, the same solar 
illumination condition can be achieved for the images of a given location taken by 
the satellite.
As a function of the orbit (distance to the Earth) and the type of sensors carried 
by the satellite platform, the satellite imaging systems can be classifed into low 
(>1000  m), medium (100–1000  m), high (5–100  m), and very high resolution 
(< 5 m).
38.6 Applications: Reflectance and Vegetation Indices
Most applications of remote sensing of vegetation use refectance to calculate veg￾etation indices due to their correlation with plant traits. A vegetation index (VI) is a 
mathematical combination of refectance bands collected at different spectral 
regions that are used as a proxy of vegetation characteristics. Depending on the 
bands used in the VI, the resulting number will be sensitive to different aspects, such 
as the concentration of plant pigments, water content, or leaf area density, among 
others. VIs have been developed for several applications, and each index has unique 
strengths and weaknesses. Many VIs are based on normalized differences of refec￾tance that minimize instrumental errors and atmospheric effects in the refectance, 
providing more robust correlations than other VIs based on direct ratios. Commonly 
used VIs include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced 
Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). These 
indices are very sensitive to the amount of green leaf area and are often used as 
biomass or fractional cover proxies. However, other VIs are sensitive to the chloro￾phyll content (chlorophyll has very high absorption of red and blue radiation) and 
other photosynthetic pigments; therefore, they have been used routinely as proxies 
for mapping crop nutrition, and in precision agriculture applications targeting vari￾able rate application of fertilizers (Table 38.1).
Applications requiring the quantifcation of specifc pigments or water content 
can use VIs incorporating bands within the spectral regions of the absorption of 
these components. For example, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) 
replaces the red band of the NDVI with a band in the shortwave IR, which falls 
within the major water absorption bands. Therefore, the higher the crop water con￾tent, the smaller the NDWI. In the case of pigments, the Carotenoid Refectance 
Index (CRI) or the Anthocyanin Refectance Index (ARI) incorporate specifc bands 
(510 and 550 nm in the case of CRI and ARI, respectively) that make the indices 
sensitive to these pigments while minimizing the infuence of chlorophyll. These 
specifc indices have been developed at the leaf level, and their application at the 
canopy level is not straightforward since the canopy architecture or the sun and

camera relative positions will signifcantly impact the refectance. This can be mod￾elled with radiative transfer models that can simulate the behavior of light within the 
canopy, providing a framework to upscale from the leaf to the canopy 
and allowing the development of functions for correcting the VIs for the specifc 
observation conditions.
Machine learning (ML) algorithms have recently become widespread in 
remote sensing, particularly with hyperspectral data. The high dimensionality of 
hyperspectral refectance, where each pixel or observation contains hundreds of 
spectral bands, makes this data ideal for the application of ML. The principle of ML 
is to train (calibrate) empirical models using many observations of a given trait 
(e.g., leaf N concentration) linked to spectral refectance. These models can then 
be used to predict (infer) this trait from refectance and applied at a large scale 
(e.g., with images). The biggest drawback of this approach is that it requires large 
amounts of data for calibration and validation. Also, these models are specifc to 
the training dataset (e.g., sensors, species, varieties, range of variation) and cannot 
be transferred easily to other conditions.

38.7 Applications: Thermal and Active Sensors
The applications of RS based on sensors sensitive to the emitted radiation are very 
different from those based on refected light. In the case of thermal imaging, sensors 
register the signal emitted by observed objects that is a function of their tempera￾ture. Canopy temperature depends mainly on the crop energy balance; therefore, it 
is a function of the incoming radiation, air temperature and humidity, and wind 
speed, but it is also infuenced by crop transpiration. Generally, a well-watered crop 
will have a lower temperature than a water-stressed crop due to the difference in 
stomatal conductance and transpiration. This simple rule can be used to examine the 
canopy temperature differences in a thermal image to identify stressed plants. 
Furthermore, canopy temperature can be used as an input into energy balance mod￾els for calculating sensible heat and transpiration. However, similar to the vegeta￾tion indices, simple indicators have been developed to normalize canopy temperature 
into a simple, easily interpreted number. The most widely adopted index based on 
canopy temperature is the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), which was developed 
to correct the effects of air temperature and vapor pressure defcit on crop tempera￾ture and allows quantifying water stress (see Chap. 21).
Thermal imaging requires calibration and atmospheric correction to obtain the 
actual canopy temperature. Infrared sensors operate by measuring the emitted 
energy by the object. This energy needs to travel across the atmosphere between the 
object and the sensor, which has a given transmissivity and attenuates the signal but 
can also contribute to the thermal radiance emitted by the air. These effects can lead 
to bias in the estimated temperature and must be corrected even at low altitudes, 
where drones operate. This bias can introduce large errors in calculating CWSI or 
energy balance components based on IR temperature.
Active sensors have the advantage of not relying on environmental conditions 
and, therefore, can be operated under cloudy conditions or even at night. The main 
active sensors used for monitoring crops are indicated below.
38.7.1 LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging)
Its energy source is a laser that emits pulses and measures the distance to the object 
by determining the time of fight of the light pulse. The pulses follow a scanning 
pattern, measuring the distance for different angles which makes it possible to esti￾mate the 3D coordinates of each laser hit. The result is a 3D canopy model whose 
resolution depends on the sensor specifcations and distance. The intensity of the 
refected light is also very valuable; depending on the laser’s wavelength, it can 
provide information about the crop status. For instance, a red laser can be sensitive 
to chlorophyll. The main applications of LiDAR in crop monitoring are measuring 
plant height, canopy architecture analysis, and biomass estimation. An example is 
shown in Fig. 38.4.
38 Remote Sensing580

a 2D profle across the orchard (c). The data was obtained with a prototype of a handheld ground￾based LiDAR acquisition system. (AgroLiDAR)
38.7.2 RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) or SAR (Synthetic 
Aperture Radar)
This method uses microwave radio signals covering the scanning area, often emitted 
from large antennae in satellites. The main advantage of RADAR remote sensing is 
that microwaves can penetrate clouds, making it the only available technology in 
areas almost permanently covered by clouds. The RADAR signal processing is 
based on analyzing the refected signals (backscattering) at different angles, which 
can provide information about the topography, surface roughness, or crop phenol￾ogy. Some applications of RADAR allow estimating soil moisture by measuring the 
changes in the dielectric properties of the soil as these modify the RADAR signal. 
However, when applied from space, the penetration of the microwaves in the soil is 
limited to a few centimeters, and vegetation will also interfere with the signal. 
Alternatively, when operated on the ground (ground penetrating radar or GPR), the 
method provides information about the soil properties so it is often used for map￾ping soil moisture, salinity, and texture.
38.8 Phenomics
Plant breeders and agronomists evaluate certain plant traits that differ depending 
on the genotype and environmental interactions, also known as the phenotype. 
These traits include plant establishment (number of plants per square meter), ground 
cover, plant height, biomass, yield, and visual scores for disease and pest damage. 
The use of remote and proximal sensing in phenotyping has been called phenomics, 
in analogy to other “omic” technologies. Phenomics allows measuring at a large 
scale with higher precision and avoids the subjectivity sometimes present due to the 
P. J. Zarco-Tejada and J. A. Jimenez-Berni581
human factor in many measurements. Moreover, phenomics is essential for obtaining 
the large amount of data required to link genetic information to the phenotypes 
across multiple environmental conditions, which is critical in genome-wide associa￾tion studies and gene function discovery.
Phenomics can be applied at different scales, from single plants growing under 
controlled conditions in growth chambers and greenhouses to more extensive feld 
trials distributed geographically. The sensing technologies used in phenomics also 
range from hyperspectral to determine the biochemical composition of plant organs, 
thermal for estimating stomatal conductance or 3D-RGB, and LiDAR for canopy 
architecture, height, or biomass. In feld phenomics, sensors can also be operated on 
platforms like ground vehicles (often known as phenomobiles) or aerial vehicles 
(including autonomous drones). Each of these platforms has unique advantages. In 
the case of ground vehicles, the proximity to the crop allows higher resolution for 
applications requiring single-plant imaging. At the same time, aerial sensors can 
map the entire feld trial in just a few seconds. This fast acquisition is critical for 
applications like thermal imaging, where changes in environmental conditions can 
conceal the phenotypic differences in canopy temperature.
One signifcant advantage of using remote and proximal sensing tools in phe￾nomics is that it allows repeated and non-destructive measurements of dynamic 
traits over time. This provides, for instance, crop growth rates or biomass accumula￾tion dynamics without cutting and processing biomass samples from the feld so 
plot size and sampling errors can be minimized.

Abstract
Site-specifc agriculture (SSA) enhances resource use effciency by exploring 
temporal and spatial variability in agricultural felds. SSA, also called precision 
agriculture, is based on the computation and analysis of intra-feld variability of 
soil or plant variables that affect the relationship between input application and 
crop productivity. The overall objective is to match crop demand and input sup￾ply while minimizing traffc. The development of GPS systems and new sensors 
and the ability to locate interventions have signifcantly boosted site-specifc 
applications. The application of site-specifc management follows three steps: 
(i) assessing variability and developing management and prescription maps, 
(ii) applications using the variable rate approach, and (iii) output evaluation. 
To address feld spatial variability, the commonly employed strategy is the

development of management zones based on similar crop production potential 
and the response to input application. The most effective strategy for implement￾ing precision agriculture schemes is to defne management zones based on yield 
patterns, which can be derived from yield monitors installed in harvesters or 
modeled using vegetation indices. The primary advancements have centered 
around the localized application of inputs, such as irrigation, fertilization, and 
herbicides, which have been facilitated by the development of tools for input 
precise application.
39.1 Introduction
Precision agriculture, or site-specifc crop management, is a farming management 
concept based on observing and responding to intra-feld variability. It is defned as 
a management strategy focused on the implementation of technologies and prac￾tices to apply the inputs according to the spatial and temporal variability, as opposed 
to a uniform application based on mean values. The inputs are thus applied accord￾ing to the 4R’s rule: from the right source, at the right time, in the right place, and at 
the right rate. Precision agriculture has been practiced for site-specifc nutrient or 
pesticide applications, varying seeding rates, controlling feld traffc, etc.
The beneft associated with site-specifc crop management depends on the local 
heterogeneity of the feld; it is thus useful only if there is substantial intra-feld vari￾ability. This variability must also respond to a clustered (nonrandom) distribution. 
There is no beneft in applying site-specifc strategies to an ideal completely uni￾form or entirely random feld. In agricultural felds, these extremes are never found, 
and the distribution of physical and chemical soil properties favors the application 
of site-specifc management. When there is a uniform application in a feld with a 
given coeffcient of variation (CV of 20% in the example plotted in Fig. 39.1), half 
of the area will receive lower inputs than needed, while the other half will receive 
an excessive amount. The amount of under- and over-applied product is related to 
the intra-feld variation (shaded areas in Fig. 39.1a). With site-specifc management, 
the area is split into different zones (four zones in Fig. 39.1b), and each zone is man￾aged independently. As a consequence, the input mismatch is reduced, and thus, 
resource use is optimized.
Precision agriculture involves several methods, technologies, and equipment that 
can be grouped into three activities, i.e., assessing variability, managing variability, 
and output evaluation.
39.1.1 Assessing Variability
The frst objective is quantifying the variability of the crop status or soil properties 
that would determine the response to the input application (i.e., water, nutrients, or 
pesticides). Techniques for assessing this spatial variability are already available 
and often are focused on proximal or remote sensing. Point sensors distributed

sources to account for natural heterogeneity. These data must be compiled in a geo￾graphic information system (GIS) and ingested into more or less complex models 
that calculate the necessary input applications in the feld according to sensor data. 
Often, the models estimate crop yield penalties associated with the different man￾agement strategies. Treatment decisions are taken according to the economic thresh￾old in the particular case of weed, pest, and disease management. In any case, the 
models must provide accurate and spatially distributed results in time within a pre￾scription map.
39.1.2 Managing Variability
The prescription maps are thus used to apply the inputs according to known feld 
conditions. Variable rate technology (VRT) has been developed to apply a variable 
amount of inputs in the feld using prescription maps and GPS systems. These sys￾tems differ according to the purpose. The most straightforward system is the fow￾based control system. In this case, a microprocessor calculates a servo valve’s fow 
and aperture according to the specifcations and the speed. More complex systems 
are based on modulated spraying-nozzle control, where the system controls the 
moment and duration of the discharge from nozzles, which is regulated by high￾speed valves.
39.1.3 Output Evaluation
The evaluation of the site-specifc operations should cover agronomic, economic, 
and environmental aspects. The proftability of the operations and the associated 
39 Site-Specifc Agriculture586
potential improvements in environmental quality are the most critical factors to 
evaluate. Techniques and models used in the variability assessment can be applied 
again for this evaluation. Some practices, such as those associated with soil health 
improvement, are not easy to evaluate and require long-term modelling approaches.
39.2 Positioning and Automation
High-precision positioning systems like GPS are key technologies for SSA. The 
systems record the geographic coordinates of the feld and management zones and 
locate and navigate agricultural vehicles with an accuracy of a few centimeters.
There are different levels of automated steering. Assisted steering systems show 
drivers the path to follow in the feld, but the farmer still needs to steer the wheel. 
Automated steering systems take full control of the steering wheel along the row, 
allowing the driver to watch the machine in use (sprayer, seeder). Intelligent guid￾ance systems allow different guidance patterns adapted to the shape of the feld.
Management zone maps, automated steering, and variable rate technology are 
used jointly to adjust machines to apply, for instance, seed or fertilizer according to 
the spatial variations in plant needs.
Data sensors can be mounted on moving machines also. Grain yield monitoring 
is becoming very popular. It consists of devices and sensors installed in the har￾vester that calculate and record grain yield and machine position as it moves, result￾ing in a yield map that can be useful for delineating management zones.
39.3 Definition of Management Zones
One of the most widely applied strategies to deal with spatial variability in SSA is 
the defnition of management zones. In this case, the feld is divided into zones that 
include areas with a similar crop production potential and that respond similarly to 
input application. This analysis is based on spatial statistics, searching for patterns 
according to point measurements and remote sensing-derived information. The spa￾tial variability in felds can be associated with static variables (i.e., soil and topog￾raphy properties) or can change dynamically along the cycle according to water and 
nutrient availability or crop health. In most situations, the management zones are 
defned according to soil properties because of their stability. Soil properties, such 
as texture or depth, largely infuence crop performance, although its determination 
is time-consuming and challenging. In the case of site-specifc irrigation, the tech￾nique most widely used by practitioners to defne feld zones is the electromagnetic 
induction survey of soil apparent electrical conductivity (EMI-ECa). In nonsaline 
soils, EMI-ECa varies primarily with soil texture, water content, and cation exchange 
capacity. Therefore, EMI-ECa maps are combined with soil sampling to determine 
those spatially variable soil properties effciently. EMI-ECa mapping is usually 
complemented by topographic, yield, soil, and multispectral vegetation indices 
maps to delimit management zones. The canopy temperature of crops at the onset of 
V. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.587
water stress could be used to determine the spatial variability of the critical soil 
water defcit. If the crop is not watered after heavy rainfall or uniform irrigation, 
canopy temperature will increase frst where the critical soil water defcit is 
the lowest.
Continuous monitoring of soil water content or soil water potential allows the 
introduction of real-time management decisions. The location of the sampling 
points may be based on EMI-ECa maps. Regarding plant-based measurements, the 
most widely used vegetation index is the NDVI, which is associated with radiation 
interception and, thus, with plant growth. It is of special interest when the manage￾ment zones are designed for inputs, such as fertilizers, or planning harvest opera￾tions. The characteristics of the different sensors are discussed in Chap. 21. The 
development of robust wireless networks facilitates the installation of sensors in the 
feld without interfering with cropping operations.
39.3.1 Yield Maps
Yield is the main measure of success in agricultural production and the main driver 
of the farmer’s revenues. The within-feld variability in yield results from the inter￾actions between management, climate, and soil environment. When the source of 
variability is identifed, we can redesign the management strategy. Because of the 
relevance of spatial yield patterns, the defnition of management zones based on this 
parameter is the best strategy for implementing precision agriculture schemes.
In most cases, the analysis mainly focuses on spatial variability, but it is also 
important to consider the relevance of these variations in the resulting growth rates 
that may affect the pace of yield formation. This aspect might be particularly inter￾esting for crops requiring multiple harvests for uniform and consistent maturity.
Yield maps can be derived from:
– Yield monitors installed in harvesters: Mainly developed for grain crops, the 
yield monitors have been available since the early years of the 1990s and can 
quantify yield in real time as the crop is harvested. The yield monitor is mounted 
on combine harvesters, usually placed near the grain tank, where the grain is 
stored after being separated from the straw.
– Empirical models that relate yield to remote sensing data like NDVI or thermal 
bands (Fig. 39.2). These models can be used before harvest but cannot be extrap￾olated to other regions.
39.4 Site-Specific Irrigation
Although the term precise irrigation usually refers to the application of precise 
amounts of water to crops at precise locations and at precise times—uniformly 
across the feld—precision irrigation, as part of SSA, differs markedly from this 
general meaning. It refers to water application in a volume and at a time needed for 
39 Site-Specifc Agriculture588
Fig. 39.2 Yield map in an almond orchard, derived from thermal and hyperspectral high-resolution 
imagery in Southern Spain
optimum crop production, or another management objective at each particular zone 
in the feld. Soil texture and depth are naturally heterogeneous, and so are the physi￾cal characteristics associated with soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity. 
Exogenous factors, such as the nonuniform distribution of irrigation water or the 
compaction related to traffc, can also increase the spatial variability of vertical and 
lateral water fows within a feld. Site-specifc irrigation considers the overall effect 
of these aspects on the soil water balance to maximize irrigation water 
productivity.
39.4.1 Precision Irrigation Technology
Site-specifc irrigation has been developed commercially for self-propelled center 
pivot and linear move irrigation systems. In contrast, site-specifc micro-irrigation 
(drip/trickle, micro-sprinkler) has not yet emerged from academia or industry. 
Center pivot and linear move manufacturers have produced commercial equipment 
to regulate water application in time and space (variable rate irrigation). The irriga￾tion machine is governed by a GPS controller, and the operator can enter irrigation 
prescriptions in the control panel directly or remotely. The prescription maps are 
V. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.589
based on feld-distributed soil or crop sensors, which collect and transmit data that 
will be used to determine precisely the timing and amount of water applications. 
Thermal-based indices based on sensors installed on the pivot and a nearby weather 
station may also support real-time management decisions. More recent studies have 
focused on using remote information acquired using UAVs or satellites although the 
design of the prescription map from this information is not straightforward.
39.4.2 Opportunities Provided by Site-Specific Irrigation
The overall objective of site-specifc irrigation strategies is to save water and opti￾mize crop yield by avoiding losses and defcits of water. In practical terms, it is 
associated with the adjustment of water application according to local conditions. 
Site-specifc variable rate irrigation (SS-VRI) adapted to irrigation machines allows 
stopping irrigation over roads, ponds, water courses, rocky outcrops, or any other 
landscape element that does not require irrigation. If various crops are grown under 
the same center pivot or linear move system, irrigation can be scheduled according 
to the needs of each crop.
Another case that may beneft from site-specifc irrigation is if runoff occurs. It 
is more likely to happen in steep slopes, where soil infltration capacity is low, and 
at the distal end of center pivots, where the application rate is highest. SS-VRI 
allows water to be applied at a reduced rate where infltration should be increased to 
minimize runoff.
In very arid environments, rainfall contribution to soil water storage is usually 
negligible for irrigated crops. Under these circumstances, uniform irrigation 
designed to prevent surface fow will result in even soil water storage as long as 
irrigation is scheduled for the feld zone where the critical soil water defcit (SWDc; 
Chap. 20) is lowest. Therefore, site-specifc irrigation does not help save water or 
improve yield in arid and semiarid environments. The situation is different in sub￾humid or Mediterranean environments in the spring where the contribution of rain￾fall to the irrigated crops’ water consumption may be signifcant. Using SS-VRI, the 
irrigation depth can be adjusted to each zone by applying less water where the water 
storage is greater. The crop will keep utilizing the rainfall water storage, where 
available, so that total irrigation will be reduced.
The response of yield to evapotranspiration of most crops is a linear function 
(Chap. 14). If irrigation ensures the feld does not suffer water scarcity, the yield 
would be maximal, and site-specifc irrigation would not represent any yield advan￾tage. However, some indeterminate crops and trees yield maximum under moderate 
defcit irrigation. Any deviation from optimal evapotranspiration for those crops 
will translate into yield loss. This deviation may be caused by variations in soil 
water storage due to nonuniform water application (rain, snow, or irrigation), vari￾ability of the soil water holding capacity, and lateral fow during or after the precipi￾tation event.
Evapotranspiration differences may occur across the feld due to differences in 
canopy cover. An appropriate way to estimate evapotranspiration for site-specifc 
39 Site-Specifc Agriculture590
irrigation schedules is by computing spatially distributed crop coeffcients based on 
multispectral vegetation indices related to the fraction of intercepted radiation as the 
NDVI. The so-derived evapotranspiration would account for the spatial variation of 
canopy cover and represent the non-stressed crop’s water needs. The idea is only 
valid before the full canopy cover.
39.5 Site-Specific Nutrient Management
The excess of fertilizer has resulted in the degradation of the environment by sur￾face and groundwater pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions of some nitroge￾nous compounds. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in water have 
led to the eutrophication of rivers and lakes in agricultural watersheds. Broadcast 
uniform application of fertilizer may lead to overfertilization in some areas, while 
others remain underfertilized (Fig. 39.1). Site-specifc nutrient management aims to 
optimize crop nutrient use over space and time. Its successful application can 
increase yield and proft by providing optimum plant nutrition and reducing nutrient 
leaching and nitrous oxide emissions.
39.5.1 Nitrogen
Site-specifc N management relies on the advanced technologies and data analysis 
characteristics of SSA, such as proximal sensors, remote sensing, variable rate 
machinery, and GPS mapping.
Proximal sensors acquire the measurement close to the crop canopy (≈ 1m) and 
may be handheld or tractor-mounted. Most of them are active, meaning that they 
generate their own light at different wavelengths and have receptors that measure 
the refectance of light. The wavelengths are mainly located in the far-red and the 
near-infrared regions to calculate an NDVI-like index, but some sensors incorporate 
also the near-green, a region strongly correlated with chlorophyll activity that allows 
the calculation of other indices. Tractor-mounted sensors linked to variable rate N 
fertilizer spreaders have shown a signifcant potential for site-specifc N fertilizer 
application. The reading from the proximal sensor is transmitted in real time to the 
spreaders, and the application of an algorithm allows ftting N fertilization to the 
estimated requirements. Being active, these sensors can be used on cloudy days and 
are increasingly used by advanced farmers with technical expertise.
Remote sensing technologies such as airborne sensors and satellite imagery can 
be used to monitor crop growth and assess the crop’s nutritional status. This infor￾mation can be used to create prescription maps loaded on the variable rate spreaders 
and guide fertilizer application on a site-specifc basis. Usually, prescription maps 
defne several management zones within the feld, and each zone receives a different 
N fertilizer rate. Most of the remote sensing to assess N crop status is based on col￾lecting the canopy refectance of sunlight. The sensors most commonly used are 
V. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.591
multispectral, and the measured wavelengths allow the calculations of a multiple set 
of indices related to crop N status. Satellites that provide multispectral imagery, like 
Sentinel-2 or the Landsat family, are used to create prescription maps for N fertiliza￾tion. Hyperspectral sensors mounted on aircraft have shown the potential to improve 
crop N status estimation but require large investments. Hyperspectral sensors are 
becoming more accessible, light equipment has recently appeared to mount on 
drones, and a new constellation of satellites (i.e., CHIME, Landsat Next) launched 
by the space agencies will become available in the next decade.
Remote sensors’ refectance imagery can be combined with additional informa￾tion to improve the reliability of prescription maps (Fig. 39.3). Combination with 
yield maps from previous crop seasons has shown the potential to improve the def￾nition of management zones. The N and water interaction may create a confounding 
effect on the fertilizer recommendation; therefore, combination with thermal imag￾ery contributes to apply the fertilizer where water availability ensures that the crop 
takes up the N and avoid fertilizer application in feld areas limited by water stress.
Most of the algorithms to adjust N fertilizer recommendations are based on the 
estimation of either the N nutritional status (i.e., NNI) or the yield potential. The 
decision algorithm follows either the “robin hood” or the “landlord” approach. The 
“robin hood” applies more N fertilizer in the sites where the crop shows an N defcit, 
and the goal is to avoid overfertilization and obtain a more homogeneous yield 
within the feld. The “landlord” approach applies more fertilizer where the yield 
potential is higher, enhancing yield differences and seeking higher productivity. The 
equipment allows the user to choose the approach that better suits his goals.

39 Site-Specifc Agriculture592
Fig. 39.4 Schematic timeline of the nitrogen fertilization program combined with crop sensor 
technology on wheat crop. Fertilization refers to nitrogen application at pre-sowing (frst applica￾tion) or as a top dressing in the second and third applications. (Adapted from Raya-Sereno et al. 
2021. Remote Sens 13: 1373)
The application of spectral information is not effcient at the start of the growing 
cycle as the crops are too small to provide enough information at this stage. 
Combining conventional soil testing and crop sensors is the most promising strategy.
Practical fertilizer recommendations for wheat are a good example (Fig. 39.4). 
The frst step is to determine the N requirements based on the expected yield. Then, 
the N fertilization is split into two or three applications. Despite the importance of 
N availability at tillering, we cannot use crop sensors to obtain a reliable assessment 
at this stage. The options are (1) apply 20% of N fertilizer before sowing, (2) apply 
20% of N at the beginning of tillering, and (3) tailor this application based on a soil 
test at the beginning of tillering (not needed if topsoil inorganic N >40 kg N ha-1). 
The next application at wheat stem elongation can be tailored with crop sensors, if 
possible including a reference strip in the feld that is fertilized at the recommended 
rate. Sensor readings above 95% of that measured in the reference strip show the 
sites that will not respond to additional N. A similar rule may be applied to an even￾tual third application applied at fowering to enhance grain protein content.
The machinery frst designed for variable rate application were spreaders for 
liquid fertilizers. Site-specifc machinery for broadcasting solid granules and 
organic fertilizers, either in liquid or solid form, have been developed later. Overall, 
site-specifc N management allows farmers to apply N fertilizer more effciently 
based on the specifc needs of different areas within a feld but needs to be integrated 
with other agriculture practices to optimize crop production and resource use better 
while minimizing environmental impacts.
39.5.2 Other Nutrients
Top-dress applications are feasible for N but not for P and K. Also, P and K concen￾trations in the plant are not related to canopy refectance which limits the potential 
of precision agriculture for those and other nonmobile nutrients.
V. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.593
Positive results have been obtained with the visible and near-infrared spectra 
(Vis-NIRs) in the lab, for the fast and simultaneous acquisition of data related to soil 
fertility, such as N, P, K, organic matter, carbonates, and clay content.
The only practical proposal for improving P and K with precision agriculture is 
to link the N application maps to variations in P and K to be applied as the total 
doses are directly related.
Regarding iron, chlorophyll defciency may be detected using portable chloro￾phyll meters or multispectral remote cameras. However, chlorophyll content is not 
only related to iron but also affected by N, Mg, K, and other nutrient defciencies, 
which limits its practical application. Thus, using chlorophyll-related spectral mea￾sures, mainly in the visible range, is practical when users have the security of having 
only one nutrient affecting the spectral traits of the crop. This explains why canopy 
spectral traits have been used more for nitrogen since it is usually the most limiting 
nutrient for crops.
39.6 Site-Specific Crop Protection
Site-specifc crop protection (SSCP) aims to protect crops from pests, diseases, and 
weeds to avoid yield losses while minimizing the application of treatments. 
According to FAO, 20–40% of global crop production is lost due to pests and dis￾eases. Disease control mainly relies on pesticide application. At the global scale, 2.7 
Mt of active ingredients were used in 2020. Under conventional application, the 
product is applied when the biotic stressor density exceeds the economic threshold 
level (Chap. 33). As a result, the pesticide is broadcast at a uniform rate that may be 
insuffcient in more affected areas and excessive in areas unaffected. Overusing 
pesticides might result in hazardous environmental impacts and residues in the 
products. Site-specifc application of treatments according to the presence and 
severity of biotic stresses reduces the total application amount. In this case, the 
treatment is only applied where the biotic stress causes a reduction in yield that 
exceeds the economic threshold, avoiding the application in areas with low infesta￾tion levels. The optimized application of site-specifc crop protection depends upon 
the rapid and accurate assessment of infested areas and the quantifcation of 
yield losses.
39.6.1 Site-Specific Weed Management
Conventional weeding methods are labor intensive and costly. They have been 
based on the uniform application of herbicides, which has led to an overuse of agri￾cultural chemicals and the rise of environmental and public health concerns. These 
problems could be alleviated by considering the spatial distribution of weeds. Fields 
present weed-free zones where weed control is unnecessary, allowing a potential 
reduction in herbicide use and the possibility of optimizing the fuel consumption, 
feld operating time, and cost of the weeding operations.
39 Site-Specifc Agriculture594
Site-specifc weed management (SSWM) is a strategy that seeks to apply weed 
control treatments only in the areas where weeds are located, adapting the treat￾ments to the variation in location, density, and composition of the weed population. 
SSWM is a cyclical process that can be divided into four steps: (1) weed detection, 
(2) design of the site-specifc weed control treatment, (3) execution of the treatment, 
and (4) evaluation of the safety, environmental impact, and economic proftability of 
the treatment. Depending on whether weed detection and control are performed by 
different machines or the same equipment, SSWM can be carried out in a map￾based or real-time approach. In the frst one, weeds are detected and mapped by one 
equipment, then the weed control treatment is designed, and another machine per￾forms the weed control operations. In the real-time approach, weed detection, 
decision-making, and control are carried out with the same equipment.
SSWM can be performed at three different levels according to its spatial resolu￾tion: (1) treatment of wide management zones or weed patches, (2) treatment 
adapted to a grid tailored to the weed control actuation unit (chemical or mechani￾cal), and (3) treatment of individual weeds. The frst level of spatial resolution is 
best suited to large stable weed patches, and the second one is well adapted to weeds 
growing in smaller patches distributed in the feld. An SSWM map-based approach 
can address both levels of spatial resolution. The treatment of individual plants 
requires the use of ultrahigh resolution images usually acquired by on-ground plat￾forms in real time.
39.6.1.1 Map-Based Approach
The data required to generate weed maps are usually acquired using remote sensing 
platforms. This avoids the need to circulate along the feld, which, together with the 
optimization of routes for weed treatment applications achieved through the cre￾ation of weed treatment maps, helps reduce traffc and, consequently, soil compac￾tion. The data for generating weed maps could also be obtained through proximal 
sensing using on-ground platforms, although this would increase the traffc on the 
feld and, consequently, the fuel consumption.
The frst works for weed mapping using remote sensing platforms were per￾formed using traditional platforms such as satellites and airplanes. The relatively 
coarse spatial resolution of these platforms only allowed weed mapping in the late 
season when weeds and crops were fully grown. Late-season weed mapping was 
used to design SSWM treatments for subsequent years based on the relatively stable 
location of weed patches from one growing season to the following. Furthermore, 
late-season weed maps would also allow for estimating the location of the weed 
seedbank in the feld. In most cases, weed control must be carried out in the early 
season when weeds and crops are in their frst stages of development. Weed detec￾tion through remote sensing at these early growth stages has been possible only in 
recent years through the acquisition of ultrahigh spatial resolution imagery using 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Fig. 39.5). Using images taken by UAVs and machine 
learning has allowed the mapping of weeds between and within the crop rows and 
to discriminate monocotyledons and dicotyledons. These achievements were not 
possible when working with satellite and airplane imagery.
V. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.595
Fig. 39.5 Example of the generation of a weed treatment prescription map using UAV imagery: 
(a) detail of original UAV orthomosaic in the early stage of a sunfower crop; (b) image classifca￾tion (brown for soil, green for crop, and red for weeds); (c) prescription map (areas to be treated 
appear in red)
Once the weed maps are created, the next step is the generation of weed treat￾ment prescription maps. The map-based approach is associated with creating man￾agement zones or grids where a decision about weed removal treatments must be 
made. The presence of weeds in a management zone or grid does not automatically 
imply the need for control, which depends on the competitive ability of the weeds, 
the market value of the crop, and the cost of control. The weed density above which 
a treatment will be applied is known as the weed threshold. There are competitive 
and economic thresholds depending on the factor dominating the defnition of the 
weed threshold. A competitive threshold refers to the level of weed infestation at 
which the crop begins to suffer signifcant negative impacts, such as reduced growth, 
yield, or quality. Economic thresholds are defned as the weed density whose con￾trol cost equals the beneft of controlling the weeds.
39.6.1.2 Real-Time Approaches
In real-time SSWM, a ground vehicle equipped with sensors performs the detection 
of weeds, the decision-making, and the control operations while circulating along 
the feld at a constant speed. Using sensors near the ground allows the acquisition of 
images with even larger spatial resolution than the ones acquired by UAVs. The 
advances in precision robotics make possible the control of weeds at the plant level. 
These facts, in combination with the latest advances in deep learning image analysis 
that allow the identifcation of weed species, make it possible to adjust the treatment 
to the specifcities of each species. For example, endangered or low-competitive 
species can be excluded from treatments, benefting the biodiversity of the agroeco￾system. On the other hand, weeds belonging to highly invasive species could be 
eradicated before creating a persistent seedbank.
Real-time approaches in SSWM can be performed in two different ways: by trac￾tors equipped with the necessary technological implements or by feets of small 
autonomous vehicles. The last option has advantages:
39 Site-Specifc Agriculture596
– Price: Farmers can purchase the equipment in an increasing manner.
– Fault tolerance: The failure of a small vehicle would only require the re￾coordination of the remaining vehicles, whereas the failure of a tractor would 
stop the weeding operation.
– Safety: Small vehicles are safer for their own and the crop.
– Reduction of soil compaction
39.6.2 Site-Specific Pest and Disease Management
Site-specifc pest and disease management (SSPDM) is not as developed as for the 
other domains described above. An aggregated spatial distribution (hot spots) of 
pests and diseases is typically found in the feld. This pattern eases the implementa￾tion of SSPDM as clumped spatial patterns are especially suited for site-specifc 
strategies. On the other hand, a clear-cut identifcation of affected zones is essential 
as untreated areas may serve as a refuge for susceptible pest populations and 
enhance resistance to pest management. Consequently, the level of risk perceived by 
growers may overcome the potential benefts of SSPDM. An alternative consists of 
combining SSPDM with a strategic broadcast application that can decrease the pest 
or disease prevalence in areas not targeted by the site-specifc applications.
39.6.3 Weed, Pest, and Disease Control Operations in SSCP
Although mechanical weeding is possible in a map-based approach using tech￾niques such as hoeing or faming, weed, pest, and disease control operations in this 
SSCP form are usually based on pesticide spraying. Independent of chemical or 
mechanical weeding, the prescription map must consider the biotic stressor density 
and the machinery available to the farmer to execute the necessary operations. The 
spatial resolution of the prescription map must be in accordance with the ability of 
the farmer to execute it; for example, more complex spray maps can be applied with 
sprayers that have more nozzles across the boom and graduated control of 
each nozzle.
In real-time SSWM, control operations can also be carried out by mechanical or 
chemical means. The recent advances that allow the location and control of indi￾vidual plants make the use of novel thermal technologies for weed control viable. 
Using lasers, electrical discharges, or microwaves was not economically viable in 
large-scale felds. Still, the ability to target these control measures to individual 
plants can make these techniques as resource-effcient as the application of 
herbicides.
In the case of pests and diseases, the spraying control can be adjusted to canopy 
density, considering that more dense canopies would require more product than 
sparse canopies. After the treatment application, the last step in the operations is 
monitoring the outcomes to assess the performance by the economic and environ￾mental evaluation of the applications.

Abstract
Crop models are simplifed mathematical representations of crop systems that can 
be classifed as mechanistic or empirical. The former uses the scientifc knowl￾edge of the system behavior to propose mathematical equations for the crop 
response to the environment. The latter are not constrained by scientifc principles 
and use regression or curve ftting to observational data to predict system outputs. 
Crop models have been extensively applied in agricultural research to help inter￾pret experimental fndings, separate casualty from causality, synthesize research 
understanding, facilitate the development of preliminary hypotheses, and opti￾mize crop performance across environments. Beyond research applications, crop 
models have been used in decision-making. Decision Support Systems are com￾puter software tools that integrate external information (soil, weather, sensors) 
with crop models to assist farmers, stakeholders, and policymakers in making 
informed decisions. Crop models have undergone continuous development since 
their inception in the 1960s. Starting in the 2000s, the integration of machine 
learning techniques into crop modelling has shown success, particularly in

of harvest and postharvest operations, as well as crop protection. Nevertheless, 
machine learning should be used with caution for yield prediction.
40.1 Introduction
A model is a simplifed representation of a system. In agronomy, we commonly 
refer to crop simulation models, which are a set of mathematical equations that 
describe different processes like biomass accumulation, yield, and/or water and 
energy fuxes. In a broader sense, we use mathematical models as static, empirical 
relationships between an input (e.g., rainfall) and an output (e.g., yield). In this 
chapter, we will focus on dynamic deterministic models that track system behavior 
through time, making defnite predictions (e.g., on July 1, the dry biomass of this 
potato crop will be 2000 kg/ha).
Crop models, as we conceive them today, appeared in the 1960s, thanks to the 
works by Cornelis Teunis de Wit at Wageningen University and Bob Loomis at UC 
Davis. Professor de Wit was a physicist who frst proposed the use of physical and 
biological principles to model agricultural systems. Later, in the early 1970s, during 
the Cold War, knowledge of expected yields in the Soviet Union, China, and else￾where became a strategic issue that boosted US public funding in crop models to 
predict wheat production worldwide using satellite data. The project, led by Joe 
T. Ritchie at the USDA, resulted in the family of Ceres models during the 1980s. At 
the same time, Jim Jones and colleagues developed the Gro models for legumes at 
U. Florida. Currently, we are experiencing a research networking explosion. The 
development of new open-source research communities, which freely exchange 
scripts through different platforms following the open-source rules, place crop 
model development in a new era.
40.2 Basic Concepts
Following the concepts developed in Systems Science during the 1950s, we can 
represent the crop using a set of state variables, like leaf or seed mass. We also need 
to defne the equations describing the change of these state variables in time, i.e., the 
rates, as a function of other state variables or external inputs (environment, manage￾ment). This formulation is based on our knowledge of the biological, chemical, and 
physical principles behind crop functioning. Then we will integrate numerically the 
equations of the system to predict the time course of the state variables. The integra￾tion that shows the time course of our system state variables is what we call a simu￾lation. Therefore, a crop simulation model is a dynamic mathematical model that 
defnes the state variables, the inputs, and the rates of the crop. It is, thus, a simpli￾fcation of the system as it does not incorporate all possible processes in the crop. 
For instance, we have many crop models that respond to nitrogen nutrition but not 
to other nutrients.
O. García-Tejera et al.601
The level of simplifcation—or model complexity—will vary depending on the 
model’s purpose and the system’s characteristics. As crop models are based on a 
reductionist approach, they will be wrong at some point. As the statistician G. P. Box 
said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” Simplifcation, therefore, will 
frame model capabilities, preventing us from using it in situations where it does not 
hold. This idea should always be present when performing one of the key processes 
of model development, the validation.
Biological systems exhibit a hierarchical structure wherein each level of organi￾zation represents an aggregation of lower levels. For instance, cells combine to form 
tissues, which in turn make up organs, and ultimately these organs results in a plant. 
When formulating a model, it is crucial to consider the properties inherent to hier￾archical systems. One of the most signifcant aspects is that each level possesses its 
distinct temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, one should limit the number of 
integrated levels in a model typically to two or three at most. For example, when 
modelling a plant, it is advisable to simulate organs (such as leaves and roots) or 
tissues at most, rather than attempting to integrate processes at lower scales, such as 
cells or organelles.
40.2.1 Model Formulation
The state of the system at a given time t can be defned by the value of its state vari￾ables. The state variables, defne the characteristics of the system being modelled. 
For instance, state variables can be the dry matter of leaves or stems or the soil water 
content. The scope of the model is therefore defned by the state variables selected, 
as they will represent our system. Since we are dealing with dynamic systems, we 
can mathematically defne them using frst-order differential equations:
dX
dt = f X( ) , P E, (40.1)
In equation 40.1, the rate of change in the state variable X, is a function of the 
state variable itself, the parameters (P), and the explanatory or external variables 
(E). The parameters are constants in the rate functions. In mechanistic models, P
should have a physiological meaning (like the specifc leaf area or the radiation use 
effciency). The E typically includes the value of the state variable at time zero, 
management inputs, and climate variables.
Usually, Eq. 40.1 can only be integrated numerically, which is frequently per￾formed using Euler’s method, i.e., assuming that the rate of change is constant dur￾ing the time interval ∆t:
X t( ) + ∆ ∆ t X = ( )t t + f X( ) ( )t t, (40.2)
40 Crop Models602
40.2.2 Calibration and Validation
The calibration and validation processes are fundamental pieces of model develop￾ment. Model calibration involves determining the model parameters. In mechanistic 
models, these parameters have a biophysical signifcance, making it possible to 
measure directly some of them. For instance, the specifc leaf area (see Box 40.1) 
Box 40.1: Construction of a Simple Biomass Accumulation Model
Let us consider an annual crop like wheat. We want to simulate how leaf bio￾mass (Wl) (our state variable) will change throughout the growing season.
From Chap. 13, we know that the rate of change in crop biomass can be 
modelled using the fraction of light intercepted (fi), the incoming par radiation 
(Rsp, MJPAR m−2
day−1
), and the radiation use effciency (RUE, g/MJPAR):
∆ ∆ B t RUE fi s R p / =
We can calculate the rate of increase in leaf biomass as:
∆
∆
∆ ∆
W t

LPC B t l ( ) = /
where LPC is the Leaf Partitioning Coeffcient, i.e., the fraction of total bio￾mass invested in new leaf growth. Therefore,
∆ ∆ W t t LPC RUE f R t l i ( ) / = sp ( )
In Chap. 3 (Eq. 3.14), we saw that fi can be computed from the leaf area 
index (LAI, m2
leaf m−2
soil) and the extinction coeffcient (k):
f e i
k LAI = − − 1
LAI is related to leaf biomass (Wl) at time t by:
LAI W= l ( )t SLA
where SLA is the specifc leaf area (m2
/g).
We will calculate the increase in leaf biomass each day as:
∆
∆
W t
t
LPC RUE e R t l kW t SLA
sp
l ( ) = − ( ) ( ) − ( ) 1
Note that the rate is calculated as a function of one state variable (Wl) at 
time t, four parameters (LPC, RUE, k, SLA), and one external variable (Rsp).
Once the rate of change of the state variable is calculated, we will update 
its value following the procedure depicted in Eq 40.2:
W t t W t W t l l ( ) + ∆ ∆ = ( ) + l ( )
O. García-Tejera et al.603
can be determined as the ratio of leaf area and dry mass from a leaf sample. Ideally, 
we should measure all the parameters. However, in many cases, it becomes imprac￾tical or costly to do so. Consequently, calibration is performed using optimization 
algorithms, which seek parameter values that minimize the discrepancy between the 
simulated and observed data.
Various optimization procedures are available. For “simple” models with less 
than 10 parameters, multiple alternatives exist (e.g., Simplex, Complex). For 
instance, within the DSSAT package, cultivar parameters can be calibrated using 
GenCalc, which employs a gradient search method. However, models with more 
than 10 parameters need more robust tools like global optimization algorithms, 
which systematically vary parameter values according to specifc criteria to identify 
a global minimum. An example of a global optimization tool is GLUE (Generalized 
Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation), also included in DSSAT. It is important to note 
that numerical methods carry the risk that a combination of incorrect parameters 
may yield correct model results. This risk is proportional to the number of parame￾ters being calibrated, underscoring the need for caution when employing numerical 
calibration methods.
As previously mentioned, crop models offers a simplifed view of the systems 
they aim to simulate. The “art” of modelling, therefore, lies in the ability to simplify 
without compromising the model’s capacity to represent the system. Simplifcations 
will be driven by model objectives. For instance, a researcher aiming to analyze 
potential yields of a specifc crop in diverse environments may not consider the 
equations that describe the effects of water or nitrogen defcits. Hence, simplifca￾tions should remain a focal point during the validation process.
Validation for model accuracy has been widely described in the scientifc litera￾ture. The idea is to compare observation data (independent of those used in the cali￾bration) with model simulations to test, through different statistical indicators, if the 
model correctly represents the observations. Some examples of statistical indexes 
are presented in Table 40.1.
Model validation should not be overrated for different reasons:
– Scientifc principles: A model is a set of hypotheses on crop functioning. The 
basis of hypothesis testing is rejection based on experiments. In other words, the 
only valid test of a model is showing that it is not valid in a given situation. 
Unfortunately, most literature on crop models shows instances where the model 
is right, which is of little help for users, as one cannot be sure that the model will 
also be right if used in different conditions.
– Data quality and completeness: On most occasions, validation is performed with 
data from experiments not specifcally designed for that purpose. Hence, some 
key input variables may be missing and are estimated, which preconditions the 
results of the validation. On the other hand, agricultural experiments are prone to 
large errors which may be systematic (e.g., incidence of a pest or disease, poor 
experimental design) or random (soil variability).
– Independence of validation and calibration data: Yield data obtained in different 
years in the same farm with the same management may be divided into a calibra￾tion and a validation set. Are they truly independent? For a statistician, yes. For

Box 40.2: Hypothesis Testing and Model Validation
During model validation, we will need to plot predictions against observation. 
The null hypothesis we want to test is that model predictions are equal to 
observations, i.e., H0: slope = 1.
We frst test for the regression Y = observed, X = predicted. We will reject the 
hypothesis if the confdence interval does not include 1. Otherwise, we do not 
reject the hypothesis; thus, it can be tested further. Now we will ft the regres￾sion Y=predicted, X=observed. The null hypothesis of this second test is also that 
the slope is equal to 1. If the confdence interval now does not include 1, then we

an agronomist interested in applying the model in other sites with different envi￾ronmental conditions, probably not.
Rather than solely relying on straightforward observed-predicted comparisons, 
model testing should encompass sensitivity analysis and response studies. The for￾mer assesses the model outputs’ sensitivity to variations in inputs or parameters, 
while the latter examines whether the model’s reactions to gradual alterations in a 
specifc input (such as irrigation) align with the expected responses or not.

40.2.3 The Need for Models in Agriculture
Agriculture is a unique feld characterized by a combination of traditional wisdom, 
trial and error, and scientifc knowledge. The former represents the conventional 
routine where practices are employed based on their known effectiveness. 
Conversely, scientifc knowledge offers a rationale to explore if a different routine 
will perform better or to provide alternatives when our agroecosystem changes.
Traditionally, agricultural research has relied on feld experiments, involving the 
comparison of crops under contrasting conditions, and applying statistical tech￾niques to interpret the resulting data. However, this approach is not only resource￾intensive but also time-consuming. Additionally, statistical techniques alone fail to 
differentiate between causal and casual relationships. To overcome these challenges, 
models emerged as invaluable research tools. They aid in interpreting experimental 
fndings, synthesizing research understanding, and facilitating the development of 
preliminary hypotheses, ultimately saving time and resources in experimen￾tal design.
One of the most successful uses of crop models in agricultural research has 
involved optimizing crop performance in diverse environments. A good example is 
the research conducted by Kirkegaard et al. (2014. Crop Pasture Sci 65:583–601) in 
Australia. The authors involved research groups from diverse areas of expertise to 
propose and evaluate novel management strategies aimed at improving rainfed 
wheat water-use effciency (WUE) by 10% across Southern Australia where annual 
rainfall ranges from 300 to 700 mm. Simulation studies provided initial insights that 
were subsequently validated through experimental trials. The authors demonstrated 
that the inclusion of break crops or the earlier sowing of appropriate varieties, 
among other strategies, could result in WUE surpassing the initial 10% target.
During the last decades, concerns about climate change and food security have 
boosted the integration of crop models into agronomy research. While global and 
regional circulation models have been employed to project climate trends, it is 
essential to interpret this information in terms of its impact on crop responses to the 
environment. For example, Asseng et al. (2015. Nature Clim Change 5:143–147) 
showed that global wheat production is projected to decline by 6% for each degree 
will reject the hypothesis that model predictions are equal to observations, even 
if the preliminary test (Y=observed, X=predicted) did not allow rejecting the 
hypothesis.
In summary, it is important to recognize that hypothesis testing is designed 
to reject rather than confrm. If either the frst or the second test results in 
rejection, the model is statistically different from the observed data. It is cru￾cial to emphasize that model validation does not aim to prove for model cor￾rectness but to identify potential faws or discrepancies. It should serve as a 
means of demonstrating the presence of errors rather than confrming models’ 
accuracy.

Celsius of temperature rise, primarily due to a shortened growing period. Crop mod￾els possess the capability to process this data and to separate the contributions from 
different climate variables. Such distinction is vital in proposing effective adapta￾tion and mitigation strategies.
40.3 Classification of Crop Models
Since crop models are developed for different purposes and crops, modelling 
approaches can vary widely in complexity, input requirements, robustness, and 
accuracy. Hence, we must be very careful in selecting the right model for the task at 
hand. We will focus on dynamic deterministic models, i.e., not including a probabi￾listic distribution as stochastic models do. Therefore, for a single input, we will 
obtain a single and specifc output. Crop models may be classifed according to dif￾ferent criteria, but in this section, we will focus on the distinction between models 
that are not directly constrained by scientifc principles or any knowledge of the 
system mechanisms (empirical models) and those that are concerned with the struc￾ture of the simulated system (mechanistic models).
40.3.1 Empirical Models
Empirical (also called statistical) models relate the output of a system to a set of 
environmental or management input variables providing no information on how the 
system works. The lack of an explicit description of the cause-effect relation 
between inputs and outputs has led to the name of black box models. Nonetheless, 
empirical models can be extremely useful for many practical applications and have 
been widely used in agricultural research.
The formulation and calibration of empirical models stems from empirical data 
and often involves defning the equation or set of equations that best ft experimental 
results. Figure  40.1 gives a simple example. Black circles show observed yield 
responses of a rainfed sunfower crop to the level of N applied with fertilization. The 
function that best fts the data is also depicted. The ftted curve represents an empiri￾cal model that predicts crop yield as a function of the N fertilization level. Note that 
the model (ftted equation) does not provide any new information beyond the origi￾nal data per se or give insight into why the yield response to the application of N is 
as it is. Yet, the model may still be useful to estimate the expected yield from a given 
amount of N applied under rainfed conditions.
The example above illustrates that empirical models are potentially very accu￾rate, which explains their success in agricultural research. However, they face 
important limitations when applied to conditions differing from those used for 
model calibration. This is also illustrated in Fig.  40.1. White circles show yield 
responses to N fertilization taken from the same experimental site and year under 
irrigated conditions. In this case, the ftted curve (solid line) for rainfed conditions 
is useless for describing crop responses to N under irrigation as both N and water 
O. García-Tejera et al.607

empirical model of crop 
yield response to N applied

conditions (black circles). 
The model is unable to 
capture crop responses to 
N application in the same 
experiments if the crop is 
irrigated (white circles)
were co-limiting crop yield in the original set. This model, therefore, would fail to 
reproduce yield responses for seasons or sites with contrasting rainfall regimes to 
those prevailing in the original experiment. Moreover, the response of yield to N 
applied may be affected by additional factors (e.g., differences in the initial inor￾ganic N in the soil) (see Chap. 26). Empirical models can be powerful tools in 
agronomy but should not be extrapolated to different environmental or management 
contexts than those considered in the calibration stage.
40.3.2 Mechanistic Crop Models
Mechanistic crop models are commonly known as process-based models since they 
incorporate our current understanding of how specifc processes function. One of 
the main characteristics of mechanistic crop models is that parameters and variables 
should have a biophysical meaning. As mechanistic models are complex, they 
require more input data and rely on many assumptions when the body of knowledge 
is limited, so they can be less effective than empirical models in predicting actual 
data. However, given their ability to show the dynamics of the system and the inter￾actions between its components using biophysical equations, they can be applied in 
conditions differing from those considered during their development. Furthermore, 
these features make them suitable for addressing the performance of crops under 
nonexisting scenarios (see Sect. 40.2.3).
The number and diversity of mechanistic crop models available nowadays are 
huge, but most share several structural features. The simulation of plant develop￾ment is typically independent of other model components and based on the concept 
of thermal time. Accordingly, genotype-specifc thermal time thresholds are usually 
defned for triggering transitions from a given phenological stage to the following. 
In addition, exposure to low temperatures and day length intervals are also consid￾ered at certain stages in models dealing with crops or genotypes with photoperiod 
or vernalization requirements.
40 Crop Models608
Historically, the two main schools of thought in crop modelling have been:
(a) Wageningen-type or photosynthesis-driven models: Inspired by pioneering 
work by de Wit and colleagues in the 1960s, models in this category estimate 
biomass production from the balance of gross assimilation and respiration; the 
latter usually split into maintenance and growth components. The simulation of 
gross photosynthesis requires a detailed characterization of plant morphologi￾cal and physiological traits. Examples of models in this family include ORYZA
(for rice) and WOFOST, a universal model (i.e., valid for any crop species).
(b) Radiation-use effciency models: These models estimate biomass accumulation 
from the product of radiation interception and radiation use effciency. The frst 
models within this group (Ceres family) were developed by Joe T. Ritchie and 
colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States and most of them are 
species specifc (i.e., valid for a single species). This family is included in the 
DSSAT package along with the Gro family of models (e.g., Soygro for soybean) 
that includes also a photosynthesis submodel.
Today, we have a wide range of approaches and combinations of submodels. For 
instance, OliveCan, the model of olive orchards, combines photosynthesis and sto￾matal conductance models, making OliveCan sensitive to changes in CO2
concentration.
One key aspect in crop model formulation is how the impact of stresses is 
accounted for. Each model considers a different set of abiotic or biotic stresses, and 
we may even fnd some models that disregard all of them, just being useful for 
assessing crop potential growth. As water and N defciency represent the major 
limiting factors for crop growth, these are the abiotic stresses accounted for by most 
crop models. Simulating the impact of limited water or N uptake requires modelling 
the main water fuxes within the soil-crop system (infltration, percolation, evapo￾transpiration, irrigation, etc.) and N transformations and fuxes in the soil (mineral￾ization, nitrifcation, denitrifcation, and leaching).
Most existing crop models have been built for annual species while only a few 
have been developed for fruit trees (e.g., OliveCan; Lopez-Bernal et  al. 2018. 
Frontiers Plant Sci. 9:632) because of the lower relevance, the larger complexity, 
and the scarcity of good data sets for calibration and validation. Access to crop 
models is becoming increasingly easier as many are freely available, along with 
online manuals and video tutorials. Models may be integrated into packages like 
DSSAT, which allows sharing of some components and the same graphical user 
interface (Table 40.2).

40.4 Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) includes different mathematical techniques used for ftting 
empirical models for prediction and decision-making using qualitative and/or quan￾titative data. ML was frst applied to identifcation problems, which led to the devel￾opment of Artifcial Neural Networks (ANN). Later, ANNs and decision trees were 
used for regression problems.
Applications of ML in agronomy have thrived since the 2000s. ANNs have been 
used successfully for identifcation and classifcation problems in mechanization of 
harvest and postharvest operations and crop protection. ANNs have been also 
widely used in regression problems as a more fexible alternative than Linear 
Models (LM) for ftting empirical quantitative models. A single hidden layer ANN 
with enough cells can ft any continuous mathematical function within a given inter￾val. However, ML algorithms should be used with caution for yield prediction for 
several reasons:
– Conditions in the farm or the agricultural system change very rapidly so we can￾not obtain enough data for ftting the model.
– Testing of the models requires separate data sets with different requirements 
depending on the objective of the model. Random partitioning of data for train￾ing and testing leads to underestimating model errors as compared to time￾dependent partition. Only when we want the model for past predictions (see Box 
40.3) the random partitioning is valid. However, for applying the model to future 
data or different areas, validation should be conducted in separate locations and 
in later years than those used during calibration.
Finally, it is important to bear in mind when using ML algorithms for yield pre￾diction that Random Forests are usually better than ANNs as they will always be at 
least as good as the best guess estimate (average of the farm yield on past data).

40.5 Decision Support Systems in Agriculture
Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are computer software tools that integrates exter￾nal information and crop models to aid farmers and agricultural stakeholders in 
making informed decisions. By leveraging data from various sources such as 
weather stations, soil characteristic, crop management, and market trends, DSSs 
provide real-time insights and recommendations for optimizing agricultural 
practices.
Some examples of free DSSs software include DSSAT (https://dssat.net/) and 
FertiliCalc (https://www.uco.es/ftotecnia/fertilicalc.html). The latter is a free DSS 
for N, P, and K fertilizer requirement calculation. It offers versions for Windows, 
Android, and iOS.  On the other hand, DSSAT (Decision Support System for 
Agrotechnology Transfer) comprises simulation models for over 42 crops, includ￾ing those within the CERES family (for the main cereal crops), the GRO family (for 
legumes), and other models like OilcropSun, for sunfower (Villalobos et al. 1996. 
88(3):403–415). DSSAT has been used for the last 35  years by researchers and 
stakeholders worldwide for different purposes like on-farm and precision manage￾ment, regional assessments of the impact of climate variability and climate change, 
gene-based modelling, and breeding selection, among others.
One of the primary strengths of DSSs lies in their capability to analyze intricate 
data sets and generate meaningful recommendations. While the advent of personal 
computers promoted the utilization of DSSs, the smartphones and the Internet of 
Things (IoT) have been a complete game-changer by providing widespread network 
connectivity and enhanced computing power. Furthermore, the emergence of satel￾lite programs such as Copernicus and Landsat have resulted in an unprecedented 
availability of data for informed decision-making in agriculture. DSSs has open a 
new era of data-driven decision-making. By evaluating the impact of various factors 
Box 40.3: Predicting the Past or the Future
The term “prediction” has a dual meaning. In statistics, prediction is a part of 
statistical inference: We ft a statistical model to a data set and use the model 
to estimate (predict) values of the dependent variable. Therefore, we can use 
the model to predict something that happened in the past. For instance, we 
may want to check if the yield data declared by farmers is true. We could build 
an empirical model of yield as a function of fertilizer and water applied in the 
farms of a given region. Then we would use the model to detect if yield data 
of each farm departs from the general model. We make predictions on a sys￾tem as it was at a moment in time. On the other hand, in many sectors, includ￾ing agriculture, we are interested in forecasting yields. Market regulations, 
stock management, planning of purchases of inputs, all beneft from the avail￾ability of yield forecasts. We can do that using models, but model testing 
should be stricter than when predicting the past.
O. García-Tejera et al.611
on crop yields, disease prevalence, pest control, and resource allocation, DSSs 
empower farmers to tailor their actions to the specifc characteristics of their felds. 
Consequently, they can optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application, 
minimizing environmental impact and promoting the effcient use of resources.
The combination of real-time data with forecasts facilitates proactive decision￾making by providing early warning systems and risk assessments. By monitoring 
weather conditions, soil moisture, and pest populations, DSSs can alert farmers in 
advance. This enables timely interventions, such as adjusting irrigation schedules, 
applying targeted pesticides, or implementing preventive measures, minimizing 
yield losses, and reducing the environmental impact of farming practices. Finally, 
DSSs foster a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between variables, 
enabling farmers and policymakers to make informed decisions to enhance produc￾tivity and sustainability. However, several challenges remain. One key factor is the 
need for user-friendly applications. Farmers are often reluctant to invest signifcant 
time and effort in learning how to navigate complex DSSs unless the benefts are 
readily apparent. Therefore, the development of novel DSS applications should pri￾oritize usability and intuitive interfaces to ensure farmer acceptance and engage￾ment. Another area that requires improvement is the inclusion of historical 
information analysis within DSSs. Many current DSSs lack the capability to employ 
effectively historical data. Incorporating such analyses can provide valuable insights 
for farmers and policymakers to identify changes in trends and develop innovative 
strategies. Despite these challenges, DSSs hold immense potential for revolution￾izing agriculture by harnessing the power of data analysis and modelling.

Abstract
Earth’s climate projections for the next decades raise concerns about the impacts 
on agricultural productivity and food security. Agricultural research is called to 
adapt crops and their management to the changing conditions although experi￾mental work is diffcult and expensive so crop models are needed. Higher tem￾peratures will alter crop phenology shortening developmental phenophases; thus, 
different managements and targeted cultivars will be needed. On the other hand, 
new areas may become suitable for agriculture. In many cases, temperate tree 
crops will need new cultivars with lower chilling requirements or will move to 
colder locations. On the other hand, the higher CO2 concentration will boost 
Gross Primary Productivity, especially in C3 crops, and increase the water use 
effciency, thus offsetting (at least partially) the negative impacts (higher water 
use, shorter cycles). Agriculture should also contribute to climate change mitiga￾tion although its real potential is still a matter of debate. Conservation agriculture 
aiming to enlarge the soil carbon pool and management options to reduce carbon 
emissions are the best options to ensure that farms are carbon sinks. Globally, 
intensive agriculture has more CO2 mitigation potential than extensive, low-input 
alternatives that would require more land for food production at the expense of 
forests.

41.1 Introduction
Embedded in the climate variability that agriculture has experienced since its inven￾tion, there is now a consensus that the climate is warming as CO2 concentration 
increases due to human activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation). The average 
temperature of the Earth has increased by about 0.8 °C since 1880, while the mag￾nitude of future warming is uncertain depending on the future scenarios of CO2
emissions and the Global Circulation Models used to project the climate. Current 
models predict a temperature increase of 1–4 °C with CO2 concentrations in the 
atmosphere between 500 and 700 ppm by the end of this century.
Although changes in Earth’s climate did happen many times—some of them 
already during the agricultural era—it seems clear today that the actual climate 
deviation is happening at an unprecedented rate, and its origin is anthropic. This 
acknowledgment raises serious concerns about the impacts we should expect in 
crop productivity under the future climate and adds uncertainty to the already 
strained expectations of world food security for the 10 billion population expected 
by the end of the twenty-frst century.
Research on the response of crops to climate change (CC) is hindered by sub￾stantial experimental limitations as it is mainly limited to strictly controlled envi￾ronments. Except for a few high-budget experiments, the costs and diffculty of 
maintaining crops in the open under an altered microclimate make feld trials 
impracticable. Therefore, the impact of this global change on agriculture has been 
studied mainly using crop simulation models (Chap. 40). Crop models often predict 
a general decrease in agricultural productivity, mainly caused by phenological mis￾matches with the new climate and increased crop evapotranspiration. However, 
most studies have not fully considered the effects of the elevated atmospheric CO2
concentration on photosynthesis. Higher CO2 leads to lower canopy conductance 
(therefore reduced water use) and will increase photosynthesis in C3 plants, the 
majority of crops. Simulations with advanced climate and crop models suggest that 
the overall result of these contrasting effects may either enhance or decrease pro￾ductivity in the future, depending on the crop and site.
41.2 The Carbon Cycle
The carbon cycle is among the most complex biogeochemical cycles on Earth. The 
largest C pool is stored in carbonate rocks like limestone. The rest is in the ocean, 
atmosphere, plants, soil, and fossil fuels (Table 41.1).
The fuxes between these pools occur at very different rates: it takes millions of 
years to move C in or out of the lithosphere and deep ocean pools and to form fossil 
fuels, whereas the interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere are much 
faster. The latter C pool has increased from 580 to 800 Gt in the last 300 years only, 
due to burning fossil fuels, the main anthropogenic emission.
Things are somewhat simpler at the scale of an agricultural feld or any natural 
vegetated surface. Here, we may simplify the cycle to three pools: atmosphere,

Table 41.1 Main carbon 
pools on Earth
Pool Gt C
Lithosphere 65–100 ·106
Ocean 35–40 · 103
 (97% in deep sediments)
Soil 1.5–2.0 · 103
Biosphere 500–650 (83% in plants)
Atmosphere 800
Fossil fuels 10 · 103
plants, and soil. Photosynthesis removes carbon from the atmosphere; the respira￾tion of the plant returns part of it, and the rest is stored in the crops’ living biomass. 
At harvest, part of the biomass is exported as yield (thus, it will return to the atmo￾sphere in some other place, in months or very few years, depending on the product 
life cycle); the rest are residues, part above and part belowground. The carbon stored 
in the aboveground residues may return immediately to the atmosphere if burned. 
Otherwise, part of it will eventually enter the soil pool where it will serve together 
with the dead roots of the crop as an energy source for microorganisms (heterotro￾phic respiration), thus returning over time to the atmosphere. The rate of heterotro￾phic respiration depends on soil management, soil water content, and temperature. 
The biomass C pool of feld crops increases substantially during the growing sea￾son, whereas the soil organic carbon changes slowly.
The carbon exchange with the atmosphere of an agricultural feld (Net Ecosystem 
Exchange, NEE) depends on the net balance between two opposite fuxes: the Gross 
Primary Productivity (GPP), the C extracted from the atmosphere by photosynthe￾sis, and the Ecosystem Respiration (Reco), the sum of C released from the respiration 
of living organisms. The latter may be plants (autotrophic respiration) or microor￾ganisms in the litter and soil (heterotrophic respiration).
NEE G= − PP R R eco = − GPP auto − Rhet (41.1)
The continuous variation of NEE can be measured with advanced instrumenta￾tion (Eddy Covariance, Chap. 9). GPP is nil at night (thus NEE = − Reco), and the 
feld is a net C source to the atmosphere. Crops are C sinks when actively growing 
(GPP roughly scales with LAI or canopy ground cover) and net C sources when the 
soil is bare or during the cold season. The C balance of a feld is infuenced by the 
climate and the interannual meteorological variability; therefore, the assessment of 
the C balance of a crop or a cropping system needs many years of experiments or 
simulation. When NEE is integrated over time, we have NPP (Net Primary 
Productivity). A positive NPP means that the sum of C pools of the soil and the 
plants is increasing so the feld is a C sink. The carbon balance can be manipulated 
by agricultural management. Irrigation and fertilization increase GPP, while soil 
conservation practices (Chap. 18 and Sect. 41.6.1 below) tend to reduce Rhet fuxes.
An agricultural feld also emits carbon of exogenous origin to power machinery 
and other agricultural operations such as irrigation. Additional C emissions will 
occur off-farm in manufacturing equipment and materials used in agriculture 
(Chap. 37).
41 Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation616
41.3 Main Effects of Climate Change on Crop Production
The two changes that have been documented are the increase in air temperature and 
CO2 concentration, which has gone from 360 to 420 ppm in the 2000–2023 period. 
Warming implies higher evaporation and presumably more precipitation at the 
global scale. Another prediction, not proven statistically, is the increase in the fre￾quency of extreme events, such as droughts or foods. Agricultural productivity is 
determined by the weather experienced in a particular season and location. How the 
global changes would be translated locally is a question that cannot be answered at 
this time although models at the regional scale are being built to downscale global 
predictions.
The temperature increase affects crop growth and development in different ways. 
If low temperatures limit productivity, as in the northern latitudes, crop growth rates 
would increase in response to the higher temperatures. On the contrary, in the lower 
latitudes, where air temperature does not limit growth, a temperature increase would 
increase respiration, resulting in a lower crop growth rate. Furthermore, high tem￾perature extremes may affect certain processes, such as pollination, reducing the 
Harvest Index (Chap. 15). Higher temperatures hasten crop development, which 
shortens developmental phases, leading to lower biomass production (Chaps. 11
and 13). The warming already experienced has had measurable effects on plant 
phenology all over the planet as documented by botanical gardens and other institu￾tions. For instance, the peak cherry blossom date in Kyoto, Japan, has advanced 
about 10–15 days on average over the last 50 years. The effects of rising air tem￾peratures would vary depending on the crop and location. In the high latitudes 
(Northern Canada, Russia), where low temperatures currently limit production, a 
crop such as wheat would have higher yields under CC. On the contrary, in warm 
areas (e.g., Sudan), wheat would have a shorter growing season and lower produc￾tivity. In extreme cases, there would be crop substitutions; for example, wheat 
would be introduced in areas where only rye or barley are grown because the envi￾ronment is currently too cold with a high risk of frost damage in wheat.
Another cropping system under risk is the grapevine for wine production. 
Currently, grapes are produced in a wide variety of climates in both hemispheres, 
but increasing temperatures may have different effects. In addition to the advancing 
harvest date, there will be effects on grape composition, primarily in sugars and 
acidity, but also on polyphenols, aromas, and other compounds infuencing wine 
quality. It is anticipated that wine quality will decline in warmer areas with high 
nighttime temperatures, while areas previously considered too cold to grow wine 
grapes are now going into production. The huge diversity in grape cultivars and 
wine types demands specifc studies to delineate the optimal environments for 
future production of the different wines.
The effects of CC on rainfall amount and distribution are uncertain because of 
the limitations of the current regional hydrologic models. Higher evaporation is 
predicted under CC due to the infuence of temperature in the Penman-Monteith 
L. Testi et al.617
equation that computes the reference ET (ET0; Chap. 10). However, higher ET0 does 
not imply higher transpiration because the increase in CO2 induces partial stomatal 
closure, which partly offsets the increase in transpiration. The impact of stomatal 
closure due to elevated CO2 varies depending on the degree of coupling of the can￾opy to the atmosphere. In general, transpiration will change little in smooth, short 
canopies and may decrease in tall, rough canopies such as trees and vines.
While most opinions predict negative consequences for crop production under 
CC, the increase in CO2 concentration will enhance photosynthesis and therefore 
crop productivity although the effect is stronger in C3 than in C4 crops. The 
responses to CO2 at the crop level have been experimentally assessed with open-top 
chambers or with a carbon enrichment technique named FACE (Free Air CO2
Enrichment). The growth stimulation by CO2 has been generally higher in open 
chamber experiments than in FACE experiments that are considered more represen￾tative of the effects of CC under feld conditions.
41.4 GHG Emissions from Food Production
The capacity of a gas to produce greenhouse heating is named Global Warming 
Potential (GWP) and is expressed as the ratio with the warming potential of CO2. 
GHG emissions are then quantifed in terms of mass of CO2 equivalents, indepen￾dent of the gaseous species emitted.
Agricultural systems generate around 12.2 Gt CO2 eq/year (not including 5.0 due 
to land use change). The GHGs emitted are CO2 (5.4 Gt CO2 eq/year), methane (4.7 
Gt CO2 eq/year), and N2O (2.1 Gt CO2 eq/year).
Energy use on the farm (fuel and electricity for agricultural machinery and irri￾gation) is responsible for 0.17 Gt CO2 eq/year while fertilizer production and trans￾port generate 0.67 Gt CO2 eq/year.
N2O is the most harmful of the naturally produced greenhouse gases. It has GWP
= 273 and a lifetime in the atmosphere longer than 100 years. N2O is emitted mostly 
by denitrifcation in saturated soils (Chap. 26). The process is favored in pastures 
with direct grazing and when organic fertilizers are used.
Methane has a GWP of 81 and slightly more than 10 years of lifetime in the 
atmosphere. Methane emissions from agriculture are generated by the enteric fer￾mentation of ruminants, manure management, rice cultivation, and burning of resi￾dues. Enteric fermentation alone generates 3.2 Gt CO2 eq/year. The frst two sources 
of methane (enteric fermentation and manure management) are linked to the inclu￾sion of animal protein in human diets. However, ruminants have been the only 
chance to exploit numerous ecosystems where limiting factors preclude growing 
food crops (dry savannah, cold deserts, waterlogged soils). Soils may capture a 
large proportion of methane emissions, but their capacity is reduced when cultivated.
41 Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation618
41.5 Crop Adaptation to Climate Change
41.5.1 Annual Crops
The two main phenomena associated with global change, higher atmospheric CO2
concentration and higher air temperature, require different adaptation approaches.
The increase in CO2 may improve crop photosynthesis, mainly in C3 crops. 
However, this increase is limited by other factors, especially the availability of pho￾tosynthetic enzymes (Rubisco) in the leaves. Furthermore, the yield increase may be 
lower than the increases in biomass because of limitations in reproductive growth; 
in other words, the Harvest Index may suffer reductions, which are diffcult to pre￾dict. Higher temperatures may partly offset the advantages of high CO2 as heat 
events will eventually reduce the Harvest Index.
The adaptation of annual crops may come from adopting new cultivars and 
changing agronomic practices. Breeding programs are focused on reducing the 
impact of heat damage on reproductive growth and increasing seed numbers. 
However, breeding for a higher photosynthetic response to high CO2 has failed so far.
In terms of management, the possibilities include:
– Modifcation of sowing date and/or adoption of shorter season cultivars: In most 
situations, we may reach an adequate thermal environment around fowering, 
which is the critical stage for yield determination.
– Increased N fertilizer: This will allow higher photosynthetic capacity to improve 
biomass accumulation (i.e., an adaptation to match the high-carbon supply) and 
a higher N concentration in fodder and grains.
– Irrigation management: The increase in ET0 will be partly offset by the increase 
in stomatal resistance brought about by high CO2. This compensation will only 
be partial for very short crops. Therefore, irrigation requirements should not vary 
by much. However, the negative effects of high temperatures during fowering 
may be alleviated by a good water supply, i.e., the benefts of irrigation may 
increase with global change.
– Pests: Changes in thermal conditions will likely cause changes in the incidence 
of pests and diseases. Although C4 weeds are already the main problem around 
the globe, their abundance will probably increase in colder areas, which will 
require adapting control measures.
41.5.2 Tree Crops and Vines
All trees have C3 carbon fxation pathway; thus, their gross photosynthesis 
increases—all else being equal—with the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere 
(Chap. 13, Eqs. 13.1 and 13.2). Model simulations and a few long-term experiments 
with CO2 enrichment suggest large increases in the growth and productivity of tree 
crops under future climate conditions. Models predict that the increase in photosyn￾thetic effciency of tree crops should more than compensate for the negative effects 
L. Testi et al.619
expected by warming, like the increase in water use or the reduced amount of rain￾fall in some regions. Fertilization will also need to adapt to the increase in biomass 
or productivity.
Nevertheless, the distortions expected in the phenological development of fruit 
trees due to climate warming are cause for concern. Higher temperatures may accel￾erate tree development, but this may be compensated by the chilling requirements 
in many species (Chap. 11). Models predict bud-burst, fowering, and fruit ripening 
to occur earlier in the season in species with low chilling requirements, which may 
have undesirable effects, like reducing the cumulative carbon assimilation associ￾ated with a phenophase (see Sect. 41.3 above). In many cases, the more detrimental 
effects will be a consequence of extreme temperatures occurring in sensitive stages, 
like bud-burst, fowering, or fruit set; also, the drop of developed fruits may occur 
in some species under high temperatures. However, the direct effects of temperature 
on the chemical composition, appearance, and quality of the fruit may also be 
extremely negative (see Chap.11, Box 11.2 for an example).
The adaptation measures to cope with phenological mismatching have been in 
use for thousands of years. Farmers’ selection continuously modifed the develop￾mental traits of fruit trees since domestication, as the growing areas expanded over 
the centuries, which generated strains adapted to new climates. The process acceler￾ated in the last century when modern breeding appeared, and strains with very dif￾ferent phenological cycles were made available within the same species or even as 
subvarieties to suit the markets. The task of phenological adaptation of fruit trees to 
a changing climate seems affordable for modern breeding science in many species. 
Despite the relatively long time needed for obtaining new varieties in tree crops, the 
appearance and acceptance of new adapted cultivars are rather quick in the fruit 
production sector worldwide.
A slightly different concern is vernalization failure. Temperate fruit trees evolved 
a vernalization mechanism to synchronize their annual development to the seasonal 
cycle; the development of fower buds is induced only after exposure to tempera￾tures lower than a threshold for a minimum amount of time (“chilling hours”; see 
Chap. 11). The number of chilling hours required for fowering varies among spe￾cies but also cultivars, with great amplitude: Apple trees in general have very high 
chilling requirements, but some genotypes can fower in subtropical climates. The 
future warmer winters will not supply enough chilling for some fruit cultivars in 
their actual growing areas, which will lead to changes in their geographical 
distribution.
41.6 Mitigation
41.6.1 The Role of Conservation Agriculture
Two main avenues are considered for mitigation of CC by agriculture: reducing the 
emission of GHGs and sequestering carbon. Conservation agriculture (CA) has a 
large mitigation potential as reducing or eliminating tillage may reduce CO2
41 Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation620
emissions and increase soil organic carbon (SOC). Avoiding tillage will minimize 
the disruption of soil aggregates and oxidation of SOC. However, increasing SOC 
and improving soil structure requires permanent soil coverage by residues or cover 
crops. The topsoil layer will then be protected from raindrops while providing 
organic material for the micro- and macrofauna. Conservation agriculture also pays 
attention to crop rotation to help with weed and pest control and residue management.
Although CA is effective for soil conservation, its potential for CC mitigation is 
questioned. Regarding carbon sequestration, the combination of no tillage and 
maintenance of residues generally results in higher SOC in the topsoil centimeters 
than in conventionally tilled soil. When a deeper soil profle is studied, differences 
are often nonsignifcant as buried residues can result in higher SOC in deeper layers 
of conventional systems. Nevertheless, positive effects of CA are expected in the 
long term and in arid and semiarid conditions. Higher biomass productivity does not 
imply a higher potential for C sequestration as it will depend also on the decomposi￾tion rate. Irrigation may result in more crop biomass but might also accelerate C 
losses under the typically high temperatures of irrigated agriculture.
Regarding soil CO2 emissions, the impact of reducing tillage has variable results. 
On the one hand, fewer operations reduce fuel consumption and associated CO2
emissions, a beneft partly offset by using more herbicides and fertilizers under no 
tillage (Chap. 37). On the other hand, different methodologies for determining the 
emissions, different interpretations of CA practices (e.g., the duration of reduced/no 
tillage), and the agroclimatic conditions make it hard to evaluate the potential ben￾efts. Disturbing the soil releases the CO2 contained in the pores within the soil, in 
proportion to the tillage depth. The CO2 in the soil is the result of heterotrophic 
respiration from soil organisms and autotrophic respiration from plant roots. Soil 
organisms use residues as an energy source and the process is favored after tillage 
by increasing soil-residue contact and porosity (aeration). High temperatures also 
favor microbial activity. Under heavy tillage systems, decomposition of residues is 
mainly driven by bacteria populations, while under conservation systems, by fungal 
species. Residues high in lignin and with high C:N ratio have lower decomposi￾tion rates.
The role of CA in climate change mitigation is also questioned because it can 
increase N2O emissions, in most cases when the soil is compacted and poorly aer￾ated. Another indirect effect of CA is improved soil water infltration resulting in 
lower runoff and dissolved nitrates although the risk of leaching may increase.
Under aerobic conditions, soils uptake CH4 for oxidation through methanotro￾phic bacteria. Tillage has little effect on CH4 emissions although well-drained soils 
are likely to become better sinks. Thus, if CA leads to waterlogging, the soil will 
emit more CH4 than in the conventional systems. In any case, except in rice produc￾tion, the CH4 emission or uptake associated with crop production is small.
L. Testi et al.621
41.6.2 Permanent Crops and Forests
The carbon balance of a permanent crop or a forest is similar to that of an annual, 
with a critical difference: The living biomass pool is not reset every season or crop 
cycle, but part is maintained in the permanent plant skeletons (wood and coarse 
roots) so that the standing carbon pool increases over time. The rate of increase of 
the living biomass carbon pool of stands varies considerably with the climate, the 
species, the availability of nutrients, etc., but is higher in young communities. In 
some cases, like in tropical forests, the biomass pool of tree stands may be compa￾rable in size to that of the soil organic carbon pool. It can be depleted abruptly by 
cutting or fres in forests or renewing/replanting in orchards. On the other hand, the 
standing biomass C pool can be rebuilt much faster than the soil C pool. While natu￾ral forests may last millennia, modern orchards have a life span of a couple of 
decades at most; nevertheless, the long-term size of their living biomass pool can be 
considered permanent as long as the land use is maintained.
There is consensus that forests are net global sinks of atmospheric CO2, thus key 
to the global strategy of climate change mitigation. It is critical to prevent deforesta￾tion and even to increase the extension of forests in competition with agricultural 
land to meet the growing food demand. The expected world population of more than 
10 billion at the end of the century will require higher agricultural productivity per 
unit of land. Intensive agriculture, perceived as a threat to the environment, will be 
the only way to stop deforestation. The key task for agronomy in the next decades 
will be to match intensifcation with environmental sustainability.
The carbon budget of orchards has been less studied. The living biomass C pool 
of tree crops is on average lower than that of forests, and their contribution to the 
increase of the soil carbon pool is questionable. However, the use of cover crops and 
other practices of soil conservation or soil C enrichment may foster soil carbon 
accumulation. Nevertheless, the few short-term measurements and the simulations 
(Fig. 41.1) suggest that they are active carbon sinks during their growth phase even 
considering the anthropic carbon emissions. The living biomass C pool is a net 
advantage of permanent crops for climate change mitigation compared to annuals.
Box 41.1. The Climate Change Mitigation Market
The Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015) signed by most 
countries set global carbon emissions targets and created an international car￾bon market. The system sets the allowance for the emission of a ton of CO2 as 
an exchangeable commodity–the carbon credit—whose price is dynamically 
set by market laws. Carbon credits are issued by national or international 
organizations. Companies seeking a reduction in their carbon footprint can 
buy carbon credits generated by other companies dedicated to implementing 
mitigation projects. When the trade occurs directly between companies, the 
ton of CO2 is called a carbon offset. Heavy CO2 emitters like a cement

olive orchards of different planting density in the climate of Tuscany. The simulation starts with

manufacturing company or a metal foundry may reduce their net carbon foot￾print at will by buying carbon credits or offsets from other companies or 
groups dedicated to the production of these virtual commodities through miti￾gation projects: for example, reforestation or the production of biofuels.
Forestry and agriculture generate benefts to society called ecosystem ser￾vices like the regulation of hydrological fows or the C sequestration into the 
soil and biomass pools. Carbon credits and offsets may be part of this 
philosophy.
Using economics to interpret and manage ecology is a diffcult task and is 
very prone to misconceptions and huge estimation errors. Nevertheless, it 
would be fair to compensate farmers for the services they provide. The market 
for carbon credits and offsets is beginning to reach the farmers in some coun￾tries through companies and projects dedicated to inventories of stocks and 
estimation of fuxes at a farm level. If this process succeeds, carbon sequestra￾tion may become a standard part of farms’ revenue, promoting the adoption of 
conservation agriculture techniques.

Abstract
Lessons learned since the discovery of agriculture suggest that good agronomy, 
as an integrative science, is essential for improving the sustainability of current 
agricultural systems. To meet the challenges of producing suffcient, safe, and 
nutritious food for a growing population, future agronomists will have to com￾bine advances in plant breeding and biotechnology with new approaches to 
increase further the effciency of nutrient and water use in agricultural produc￾tion. There is signifcant potential in many areas to increase yields by bridging 
the gap between potential and actual yields, but as average yields increase with 
time, such potential diminishes. The threats of soil degradation and water scar￾city will require widespread adoption of conservation practices based on strong 
extension efforts and new IT technologies. The most likely path to the sustain￾able intensifcation of production would be through continuous, small productiv￾ity improvements rather than through a few revolutionary discoveries, at least in 
the short term.
42.1 Introduction
Agriculture started with the domestication of cereals around 10,000  years ago 
(10,000 BP). Today, the same species (wheat, rice, maize) constitute the basis for 
global food production. Before 10,000 BP, seeds from some grass species were col￾lected and processed to increase digestibility, as part of a diverse human diet that 
included fruits, game, and fsh. Climate variations (colder, drier periods) probably

reduced the availability of natural food sources, making it diffcult to gather wild 
plants and hunt animals in suffcient amounts. That explains why humans were 
forced to move up the trophic chain as herbivores have greater conversion effciency 
than carnivores. Humans found that the productivity of natural grass populations 
increased with some management operations (e.g., weeding). While doing so, these 
proto-farmers, unconsciously, started selecting plants with favorable characteristics 
(larger seeds, lack of dehiscence, absence of dormancy), and after harvest, some 
seeds were saved for planting subsequently in other felds. This domestication 
occurred independently at about the same time in several areas such as the Far East, 
Mesoamerica, and the Near East where wheat and barley originated. Rice cultiva￾tion in China began 11,500 years ago, while squash was domesticated in Central 
America about 9000 years ago. That was the start, and very rapidly, a few species of 
cereals and legumes achieved the desired agricultural characteristics. At the same 
time, early farmers probably observed the advantage of concentrating useful plants 
in felds that could be protected from herbivores or neighbors and cleaned from 
other competing plants. This also allowed for a more effcient harvest.
Most hunter-gatherers had a varied diet of wild plants and animals although 
sometimes they subsisted almost entirely on meat or a few plant species. As agricul￾ture developed, some wild species were selected under domestication for different 
purposes, leading to different crops. For instance, Brassica oleracea has been 
selected for its leaves (cabbage), stems (kohlrabi), fower shoots (caulifower), and 
buds (Brussels sprouts).
The development of modern civilization started with agriculture. Increases in 
food production led to technological development because food surpluses could be 
used to feed full-time craftspeople and inventors, leading also to the diversifcation 
of human activities. It also led to social stratifcation, political centralization, and 
militarization by feeding full-time aristocrats, bureaucrats, and soldiers. These 
advantages enabled agricultural societies to eventually displace most hunter￾gatherers toward marginal environments.
Early agriculture was rainfed so it could only thrive in areas where enough rain￾fall could sustain grain production, which in the case of wheat and barley represents 
a minimum of 200–300 mm/year. In the arid zones, where precipitation was erratic 
and insuffcient to sustain crop production, irrigated agriculture appeared in 6000 BP 
in Egypt and Mesopotamia by merely diverting water from rivers to adjacent felds 
during food periods. This soon evolved into sophisticated systems of water distri￾bution which required a strong social organization for operation and maintenance. 
Similarly and at about the same time, irrigation techniques were developed in 
Mesoamerica and China. Interestingly, a lack of knowledge about the need to con￾trol salinity and remove excess water from irrigation through drainage led to the 
decline of some ancient civilizations in the arid areas of the Near East that had 
expanded, thanks to irrigated agriculture.
Continuous cropping of the same feld soon showed declining yields due to the 
loss in soil fertility from extraction and cultivation. This led to shifting cultivation 
systems such as slash-and-burn agriculture, a primitive mode of rotation aimed at 
concentrating mineral nutrients after many years of forest growth and then releasing 
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos627
them by burning the vegetation, which allowed a few years of cultivation with suf￾fcient production. This form of agriculture could be made sustainable if the turn￾around time for burning the forest would be long enough to allow for building back 
the natural soil fertility. However, population growth increased the pressure on land 
use and slash and burn expanded in many world areas. It was in the end responsible 
for the deforestation and land degradation of many regions, when population pres￾sure led to unsustainably low ratios of forest to cropped land.
The different agricultural techniques evolved in parallel. Tillage started using the 
ard which only cuts a small furrow (drill) in the soil and is therefore helpful for sow￾ing but not for weed control, incorporation of residues, or clearing new land. The 
ard appeared around 7000 BP in parallel with the domestication of cattle. The most 
primitive form of planting must have used a stick to drill a hole in the ground, place 
the seeds, and cover them with soil, a practice used by most indigenous societies. 
Moldboard plows appeared much later and were designed to turn the soil for more 
effective weed control. The plow, pulled by man or animals, became popular in 
Europe around 1500 AD, allowing a more complete and deeper soil disturbance and 
the upturning of the soil, which was the only way to control aggressive weed inva￾sions. The Europeans exported the plow to America, Asia, and Africa, enabling the 
expansion of commercial agriculture with limited human labor inputs. In some 
areas, particularly within the tropics and subtropics, moldboard plowing has become 
unsustainable due to enhanced soil erosion and land degradation problems.
Animal husbandry also evolved in parallel with crop agriculture. Domesticated 
animals not only provided for food and clothing but contributed as draft power for 
tillage, allowed the exploitation as pastures of lands unsuitable for crop production, 
and contributed to nutrient cycling by redistributing nutrients within the agricultural 
systems. Other domesticated animals had a more specifc role like cats as hunters of 
grain-eating rodents or dogs as guardians in rural areas. Production of animals and 
their products by grazing pasture and range lands in an extensive fashion is a prac￾tice that has ecological values such as contributing to the conservation of biodiver￾sity or preventing soil erosion.
Giant steps forward in agricultural science and technology have taken place in 
the last two centuries with the development of machinery, breeding of new cultivars, 
and use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides, all at an accelerated pace since the 
middle of the twentieth century. Modernization of agriculture has led to the separa￾tion of the different activities that once were all part of the life of farms and has 
transformed human society. Before mechanization, the manual labor of most farm￾ing activities represented a physical effort that required large numbers of farmwork￾ers with very low productivity. Additionally, life as a farmworker was not very 
pleasant, which inspired the mechanization of many farm operations. As technology 
improved, more specialization was required so farmers could concentrate on fewer 
activities for which they had to develop the proper skills and afford the required 
machinery and infrastructure. Rural societies thus experienced a revolution that 
changed how farming was conducted and led to land consolidation, fewer farmers, 
and vast migration movements from rural areas to cities in search of a better life. 
Before mechanization, farmers exploited crops, pastures, and forests using animals 
42 Agronomy and the Sustainability of Crop Production628
for different uses (food, draft, transportation). At that time, the life of most of the 
world’s population was based on agricultural activities, and even by 1950, more 
than 70% of the population lived in rural areas. Since the 1950s, the challenge of 
feeding a population growing at unprecedented rates was more than met by an 
evolving agriculture in what is now considered one of the most remarkable success 
stories of mankind. In 1950, about 2500 million people lived in rural areas and 
about 750 million in the cities. By 2024, the total population had reached 8100 mil￾lion with more than 4000 million in urban dwellings and yet, agriculture produces 
25% more calories per capita than in 1950. There continue to be, however, serious 
limitations in food distribution and access, primarily in remote, rural areas, as evi￾denced by the persistence of extreme poverty and hunger in hundreds of millions of 
persons. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the sustainability of present 
agricultural systems as to whether the recent productivity increases have been 
achieved at the cost of resource base degradation, with the ultimate consequence of 
reduced productivity in the future.
Although there is wide diversity among the different agricultural systems cur￾rently in existence, commercial agriculture has now been transformed into a set of 
industries where crops or animals are grown that may provide inputs for each other 
but operate in isolation. This new specialized agriculture has succeeded in increas￾ing productivity but its long-term sustainability remains unclear. In the following 
sections, we will discuss some important issues that represent future threats and 
challenges to agriculture and food production as it is presently carried out.
42.2 Climate, Soil, and Water
Agriculture takes place outdoors and plants are primarily dependent on the weather 
for growth and development, and on the soil for nutrient and water supply. The local 
climate determines what species can be grown and also the risk for selecting crops 
sensitive to extreme climatic features. As the climate becomes more limiting, the 
risk of very low yields or even crop failures increases (risk being the product of 
probability and impact), so crop choice is reached as a compromise between proft 
expectations and risks. While agriculture has always been pushing at the margins by 
approaching the climatic limits of the viability of higher-value crops, farmers are 
generally risk avoiders and always try to balance proftability against risk. An addi￾tional factor to consider is the normal climate variability that agriculture must deal 
with. Some of the variability can be explained by regional phenomena such as the 
warming of ocean waters in the Pacifc, an event called El Niño, which occurs with 
a periodicity of several years and causes excess rainfall in some regions and drought 
in others. In some areas such as Eastern Australia, predictive tools based on prior 
observations of El Niño events coupled with barometric pressure oscillations (El 
Niño-Southern Oscillation) have been developed to anticipate whether the upcom￾ing season would be wetter or drier than normal. This information is critical to 
optimize planting dates and the application of fertilizers and other inputs. Seasonal 
predictions are still in their infancy in many world areas but improving their 
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos629
reliability is essential to minimize the risks in farming. As climate science advances 
in the coming years, better seasonal predictions will lead to more predictive farming 
strategies and reduced risks.
42.2.1 Soil Degradation
Over the centuries, the conversion of lands for use in crop production has included 
fragile areas prone to degradation. The exploitation of soils without maintaining 
their fertility by restoring nutrient extraction and their physical properties (Chap. 
28) also leads to soil degradation. Exposure of bare soil to rainfall and tillage opera￾tions enhances soil erosion and the loss of the most fertile surface layers. A single 
soil erosion episode represents an amount of soil loss that exceeds by orders of 
magnitude the rate of soil formation. Despite the advances in methods of Earth 
observation, there are no good statistics on the degree of soil degradation around the 
world but estimates indicate that the problem is very relevant, requiring periodic 
monitoring to assess its severity in the different regions. Soil erosion will continue 
to be a major threat to the sustainability of agricultural systems around the world. 
The expansion of conservation agriculture (Chap. 18) is helping in many areas to 
control erosion but agricultural techniques (machinery, cultivars, pest control) have 
to be adapted to local conditions. Some soils require periodic tillage to maintain 
some physical properties, and in some regions, crop residues needed to protect the 
soil surface as part of conservation agriculture are used for animal feed and there￾fore are not available for soil protection. Intensifcation may lead to the production 
of enough crop residues for both uses. Soil salinization is another threat to sustain￾ability that affects possibly up to 15–20% of the world’s irrigated area. Again, new 
monitoring methods can reduce the risk and help to introduce salinity control mea￾sures to prevent the problem (Chap. 24).
The long-term maintenance of soil fertility is essential to ensure the sustainabil￾ity of agriculture. This is particularly important concerning phosphorus as sources 
for P fertilizers are limited (Chap. 28). Efforts here should focus on P recycling and 
on increasing the availability of soil P to plants. In the case of N, the availability of 
N fertilizers will depend on energy prices, so the inclusion of legumes in crop rota￾tions would be a partial solution when needed. Nevertheless, the use of synthetic N 
fertilizers in agriculture is extremely effcient in energy terms. If N concentration in 
grain is around 2%, each additional kilogram of N added to the crop will support a 
yield increase of 50 kg. The average energy required for producing the N fertilizer 
is 77 MJ/kg (Chap. 42), and since the energy content of the grain is around 18 MJ/
kg, the marginal effciency would be 900/77  =  11.7. Innovative approaches for 
improving the effciency of N fertilizer use will reduce N fertilization rates and the 
consequent non-source pollution that affects surrounding ecosystems and water 
quality in many intensive production areas.
42 Agronomy and the Sustainability of Crop Production630
42.2.2 Water Scarcity
Irrigated agriculture expanded greatly in the second half of the twentieth century, 
increasing from 120 to about 300 Mha. In fact, given that the productivity of irri￾gated systems is about 2.75 times more than that of rainfed systems on a worldwide 
basis, today the production of suffcient food relies signifcantly on irrigated agri￾culture. Irrigation expansion has come at a cost for the environment. On the one 
hand, the construction of reservoirs for irrigation has changed the natural environ￾ment and had an impact on river ecology. On the other hand, the return fows from 
irrigated lands constitute a major source of nonpoint pollution, unavoidable to some 
extent if irrigated agriculture is to be sustainable. This is because the maintenance 
of the salt balance through drainage is essential to prevent salinization of irrigated 
areas. Additionally, irrigated area expansion and agriculture intensifcation require 
large amounts of water to the point that irrigation is the primary consumer of the 
water diverted by man for various uses. More than two-thirds of diverted water is 
consumed in irrigation worldwide. Contrary to other uses (e.g., domestic) where 
water used can be recovered and reused after appropriate treatment, much of the 
water used in irrigation is evaporated and thus leaves the basin. While a fraction of 
the irrigation water can be reused, as irrigation becomes more effcient, such frac￾tion diminishes and the ET process dominates irrigation water use. With increases 
in effciency, due attention must be paid to the maintenance of salt balance in areas 
of low rainfall and/or where saline waters are used for irrigation.
An emerging problem that threatens the sustainability of irrigation in some areas 
is the excessive use of groundwater beyond the long-term recharge. Groundwater 
usage may exceed aquifer recharge in droughty years provided that the excess 
extraction is eventually replenished in the long run. However, long-term decline in 
water table depths as it is occurring now in some regions of China and India is an 
indication of unsustainable use. In extreme cases, land subsidence can reduce aqui￾fer capacity permanently or cause seawater intrusion in coastal areas with the per￾manent deterioration of water quality. Better assessment of groundwater resources 
combined with recharge programs and wise and strict resource management can 
bring solutions to this problem.
At present, irrigation is under scrutiny by the other sectors of society that per￾ceive that its share of water usage is too high. This is particularly critical in areas or 
times of water scarcity, where competition with other uses becomes ferce and urban 
and other demands have higher priority. Thus, while there is a need to expand irriga￾tion as one option for production intensifcation to meet future food demands, com￾petition for scarce water with other sectors, including the environment, is going to 
restrict such expansion forcing irrigated agriculture to do more with less water. 
Although many advanced technologies are available for improving irrigation man￾agement, widespread dissemination has been limited so far. The time has come for 
many irrigated areas to promote the large-scale adoption of effcient irrigation prac￾tices to meet both increased productivity needs and societal goals. Independent cer￾tifcation of effcient use of water in food production with appropriate indicators 
would be welcomed by consumers and the rest of society.
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos631
Promoting the effcient use of water in rainfed agriculture is also a very promis￾ing goal for production intensifcation in the future. The approaches should focus on 
other factors co-limiting yields (such as nutrients) and on accepting more risks, 
abandoning the conservative approaches to rainfed farming that avoided risk but 
that had little reward on good years. Acceptance of more risk in rainfed farming 
requires new tools such as reliable seasonal forecasts and advisory services that will 
assess risks quantitatively and offer fexible options adapted to local conditions. In 
its simplest view, risk equals the product of probability by impact, and the avoid￾ance of extreme events that could impact the viability of farming irreversibly caus￾ing famine has dominated past rainfed strategies. In this regard, the resilience of the 
agricultural system, that is, its capacity to recover after a perturbation, is critical for 
the sustainability of the system. As new technologies and policies enhance the resil￾ience of rainfed systems, accepting more risk will lead to productivity increases in 
the future.
42.3 The Role of Plant Breeding
The development of modern plant breeding technologies after 1950 has produced 
new cultivars which are highly productive and widely adapted. The major plant 
feature that has been improved in the major crops is its harvest index whereby cur￾rent varieties have HIs 50% greater than those of 50 years ago. The success of the 
recent agricultural intensifcation has often been attributed to the new varieties with￾out recognizing that varieties or agronomic inputs produce nothing in isolation. It 
was the combination of new varieties and new agronomy together with adequate 
management what enhanced the productivity of agricultural systems until now.
Plant breeding techniques are nowadays more powerful and more effcient due to 
genetic engineering whereby genes or traits from other organisms are introduced 
into crop plants. This has led to new cultivars labeled “transgenic” (Genetically 
Modifed Organisms, GMO). Transgenic crops have been highly successful so far 
by addressing crop features related only to a few genes. For example, the quality of 
the seed may be improved (e.g., golden rice with beta-carotene) or the plant may 
acquire insecticidal properties (e.g., Bt maize) or resistance to a given herbicide 
(e.g., Roundup-Ready soybean). The primary goals were to reduce production costs 
(lower pesticide use) and, by reducing/eliminating some pesticides, to improve 
human health and the environment. The improvements in farm proftability have 
been such that transgenic soybeans, maize, and cotton have been widely adopted in 
less than 20 years, not only in the United States where more than 90% of the three 
crops are now transgenic but also in some developing countries as India or China. 
Plant breeding efforts to produce transgenics are now being extended to other crops 
to address biotic stresses or crop quality problems.
By contrast, the promises of improving plants against abiotic stress 
(drought/salinity) using GMOs have not been fulflled so far. This is frstly due to 
the complex nature of the problem. What is drought? Is the pattern of water defcit 
the same every year? Should we look for plants that are “water savers” or “water 
42 Agronomy and the Sustainability of Crop Production632
expenders”? The former would grow slowly thus allowing more soil evaporation to 
occur but would generally have more water for completing seed growth, thereby 
ensuring a high HI. On the contrary, a “water expender” leads to higher biomass 
production and probably higher yield in good years at the expense of lower HI and 
yield in dry years. Thus, the best cultivar for rainfed conditions depends on local 
conditions (climate, soil) and changes from year to year. Furthermore, the tight 
relationship between assimilation and transpiration (Chap. 14) must be considered. 
Water use effciency is mostly dependent on the evaporative demand (air VPD) so 
little can be achieved by breeding for high WUE under specifc conditions. Breeding 
for high WUE could result in cactus-like cultivars that would keep their stomata 
closed most of the time! Breeding efforts should be directed instead at manipulating 
development to ft the most probable drought patterns and tuning stomatal aperture 
to periods of low VPD.
Despite the success of the frst transgenic crops, there are concerns about the use 
of this technology mostly related to perceived risks in food safety and the environ￾ment and the loss of autonomy of farmers for seed production. The risk for humans 
is unfounded and unfair as there are strict regulations regarding food safety and 
environmental impact assessment during the breeding process. Additionally, the 
improved GM varieties allow an important reduction in pesticide use thus reducing 
a potential toxic effect. The other concerns deal with broad social issues and intel￾lectual property rights and are beyond the scope of this book. Recent developments 
in genome editing permit modifcation of the genome to introduce desired traits, 
paving the way for increasing the precision and scope of plant breeding. One advan￾tage of genome editing is that it does not have the adverse public opinion that trans￾genic crops have in some circles. Advances in crop improvement may accelerate in 
the coming years due to the array of new genomic techniques applied to plant breed￾ing which has allowed for increasing productivity and adapting crops to new envi￾ronments. This will be even more important as global warming continues and crops 
have to be adapted to warmer environments or cold areas of the higher latitudes not 
suitable for agriculture until now. Every major crop species has many thousands of 
varieties offering wide adaptation that can be tested and adapted to specifc environ￾ments through advanced plant breeding combined with new agronomy and manage￾ment; thus, as in the recent past, crop adaptation will be a key target for the future 
of agriculture.
42.4 Alternative Agricultural Systems: Organic Farming
The intensifcation of agricultural production in recent decades with extensive pes￾ticide use and episodes of environmental nonpoint pollution have given way to 
movements that question mainstream agricultural practices, viewing them as unsus￾tainable and unhealthy. Such movements present forms of “alternative” agriculture 
that are different from what they termed “conventional” agriculture. The usual 
ingredients of alternative systems include some ecological principles and “tradi￾tional” knowledge, with emphasis on sustainability but with some disregard for the 
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos633
productivity and proftability of farming. These alternative movements have been 
met positively by some urban societies that perceive “industrial” agriculture to be 
unsustainable and as a threat to human well-being and to the environment. 
Periodically, new forms of alternative agriculture are proposed as being more sus￾tainable than conventional agriculture, for example, regenerative agriculture, based 
on leaving residues on the soil, high crop diversity, and use of animal husbandry. 
Needless to say, among the technical and ecological diversity of current agricultural 
systems, such principles have been widely practiced for a long time. The search for 
innovative methods to make current agricultural systems more sustainable is very 
positive but should not ignore the wide diversity that exists worldwide in what is 
called conventional agriculture.
The most popular alternative agriculture system is organic farming based on sev￾eral rules whereby only organic fertilizers such as manure may be applied and plant 
protection methods that forbid synthetic pesticides and are founded on biological 
pest control. Eliminating pesticide use has been welcomed by consumers and 
reduces the environmental impact of agriculture but organic farming has also estab￾lished a set of rules without scientifc basis, particularly those related to soil fertility, 
which are solely based on the naïve idea that natural is good and synthetic is bad. 
Molecules such as nitrate are the same independent of the origin of the fertilizer, so 
they produce the same benefts to the crop or may lead to the same environmental 
problem (groundwater pollution). Thus, when their systems are based on following 
a set of strict rules, organic farmers may be condemned to low yields/income if 
organic fertilizers are scarce and/or expensive. Often, additional land is required to 
fx the N needed in the soil with green manure crops. While organic agriculture has 
been successful in fnding a market niche among the urbanites of affuent societies, 
the feasibility of expanding organic farming beyond a relatively small share of 
world agricultural production is highly questionable. Global N fertilizer consump￾tion in 2021 was around 109 Mt N. If we eliminated synthetic fertilizers, we would 
require legumes incorporated into the soil as green manure. Assuming an average 
input of 100 kg N/ha/year, green manure would take 1100 Mha, which is impossible 
to achieve as total arable land is only 1500 Mha. In other words, green fertilization 
would reduce current world productive arable land to one-third of the current value.
Organic farming (OF) has expanded recently to meet the growing demand of 
societies suspicious of conventional agricultural production. Still in 2021, OF rep￾resented only 1.5% of the global farming area, while it is up to 10% in Europe. 
Agronomic improvements, particularly in crop protection, have raised the produc￾tivity of organic farming. Productivity comparisons between organic and nonor￾ganic production are meaningful only when conducted at the farming systems level, 
where the crop productivity ratios organic/nonorganic are low, varying from 0.3 to 
0.7, because in OF we would need additional land to produce the plant or animal 
manures. Nevertheless, farm proftability is another matter and there may be con￾sumers willing to pay the higher prices that organic produce fetch in urban markets.
42 Agronomy and the Sustainability of Crop Production634
42.5 Agriculture as an Energy Source
Primary production is an inexhaustible energy source and has been used by man 
since the discovery of fre. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, agriculture was 
frst considered a potential energy source, either through novel, energy crops or 
using some of the main crops for converting biomass and grain into fuels. Since that 
time, most of the energy crops that have been proposed have not fulflled their initial 
promises (although newly found C4 tropical species might be a viable option) and 
the focus has shifted to ethanol production from sugarcane and maize, with some 
attention paid to converting edible oils into biodiesel. The contribution of fossil 
fuels to global warming and the high prices of oil in the recent past have fostered 
policies for promoting the use of biofuels produced in agricultural lands, particu￾larly in South (sugarcane) and North America (maize). Globally, while the use of 
biofuels reduces greenhouse gas emissions, the competition between food and 
energy production is the subject of debate in ethical and environmental terms. For 
instance, the incentives for producing biofuels have contributed to the expansion of 
oil palm at the expense of food crops or the maintenance of tropical forests thus 
increasing deforestation. This debate is sided by proposals to use only crop residues 
as the energy source. This promise of “second generation” biofuels based on the use 
of residues by conversion of cellulose to sugars, which would then turn into alcohol, 
has been achieved in technical terms, although production costs are still high rela￾tive to those of biofuels from sugarcane or maize. However, crop residues have an 
important role in soil conservation and maintenance of soil organic matter (Chap. 
18), and as animal fodder in many farming systems. If sugars can be produced from 
residues, they could also be used for food production. As with alternative agricul￾ture, new proposals to use biomass for energy appear periodically, lately for its 
conversion to aeronautical fuels or hydrogen. These proposals have yet to be eco￾nomically viable and are associated with the pressures to contribute to climate 
change mitigation.
The relative capacity of agriculture as a potential energy producer may be quanti￾fed by comparing the energy contained in food products against the energy burnt in 
fossil fuels. The total global consumption in 2022 of liquid fossil fuels (gasoline, 
refned fuel oils, etc.) mostly used in transportation was 101 million barrels/day, 
equivalent to 191 1012 MJ/year. For the same year, global agricultural production 
was 4573 Mt of dry matter (Table 42.1) which corresponds to a total energy of 85.6 
1012 MJ which is less than 45% of the energy of liquid fuels. The EU established the 
goal of supplying 10% of fuel as biofuels by 2020. If that rule is applied globally, it 
would require 19.1 1012 MJ, equivalent to 22% of agricultural production.

42.6 The Role of Research, Extension, and Information/
Communication Technologies
The returns on past investments in agricultural research have been so high that some 
consider agricultural research the best business of the public sector ever. Modern 
agricultural research started in the last decades of the nineteenth century, primarily 
in Germany, the United States, and England. After the Second World War, given the 
need to produce more food for a growing population, there was an initiative led by 
private foundations and some countries to develop a system of international agricul￾tural research which eventually became the Consultative Group of International 
Agricultural Research (CGIAR) with research centers located in developing coun￾tries. The CGIAR developed the frst cultivars of dwarf wheat and rice that were 
more productive than previous tall cultivars, leading to what was later called “the 
Green Revolution.” All countries have since developed their agricultural research 
systems contributing to the sustained increases in food production worldwide 
since 1950.
Along with agricultural research, some countries as the United States developed 
in parallel a system of agricultural extension for disseminating the new results 
among farmers, promoting the adoption of new techniques as they were developed 
by researchers. Agricultural extension has also been very successful and there are 
many examples of fast adoption of new techniques that were experimented locally 
and tested by extension. Many newly developed techniques require adaptation to 
local conditions as a prerequisite for adoption by farmers. Without a good extension 
system, farmers hesitate to adopt new ideas that have not been adapted and tested 
locally, and progress is slower. Also, being extension services part of the public sec￾tor, they are independent of private corporations and free of biases toward certain 
varieties or products. Agricultural extension started in the United States before the 
end of the nineteenth century and has been largely responsible for the expansion and 
productivity increases of US agriculture. Other countries have created effective 
extension systems but many developing countries have not invested suffciently in 
42 Agronomy and the Sustainability of Crop Production636
them, which is limiting the rate of adoption of viable solutions to increase produc￾tivity and sustainability. One limitation is the huge number of small farmers that 
exist in many countries, which will require a large extension force to carry out the 
work in the feld if extension is to be conducted as it has been until now, face to face. 
However, new communication technologies such as cell phones readily available in 
most areas could serve as innovative ways to reach the large populations of small 
farmers effectively.
In general, communication technologies have accelerated access to vast amounts 
of information but cannot guarantee its quality. Information delivered by private 
companies is often biased toward promoting the benefts of their products and 
sometimes it escapes regulations on false advertising. It is common to see Web 
pages where companies mention “studies performed at different universities” (with￾out more detail) to support their products. Public research/extension systems will be 
required to address the needs of farmers and the whole society, in particular, provid￾ing assessments on long-term issues or large-scale effects on agricultural systems 
(e.g., soil erosion).
Given the predictions of global population and economic development, it is esti￾mated that 70% more food will have to be produced by 2050 (see below). The 
magnitude of this challenge cannot be underestimated given the current productivity 
trends of the major crops. Agricultural research will play an important role in meet￾ing this challenge as it has done in the past, provided that governments around the 
world realize the diffculties ahead and invest suffcient resources to tackle the 
research issues related to increasing production in a sustainable fashion. The associ￾ated extension efforts, which will be badly needed, will increasingly be based on the 
use of crop simulation models and the development of decision support systems 
tailored to the specifc needs of the farmers and communicated through the Web.
Box 42.1: Visualizing the Future
A farmer in 2050 is planning to sow wheat by November 1. By October 15, a 
sampling robot is sent to the different felds of the farm where it automatically 
samples the soil in different locations and produces maps of nutrients (nitrate, 
P, K) and soil water content, which the farmer checks against similar observa￾tions obtained two weeks ago from a satellite service that he subscribes. The 
robot also takes some samples that are packed and sent to the regional research 
center to test for soil pathogens or insects. On the same day, a drone fies over 
the farm and collects visual and NIR images to map the weed spots in the 
felds to be sown. Then, the farmer looks at a DSS that shows the estimated 
soil water content in the different felds. With that data and the local rainfall 
forecast for the next two weeks, the system connects with the websites of seed 
companies, collects information on the different cultivars available, runs a 
simulation model of the crop based on a reliable seasonal weather forecast, 
and compares which are the best options to purchase the seed, considering 
seed price, expected yields, product prices, and local availability. The farmer 
buys online the seed required.

42.7 Food Security and Food Safety
Concerns for food security, understood as a situation where all humans will have 
access to suffcient and nutritious food, have increased around the world in the last 
15 years. Food security is now high on the agenda of many countries that are plan￾ning for an uncertain future where, at the same time that global food trade is reach￾ing historical levels, food sovereignty issues related to the capacity of each country 
to be self-suffcient in food production are increasingly important given the current 
political climate. Food trade is effectively balancing supply and demand and is the 
major instrument now to cope with instability in production caused by extreme 
weather events and by changes in food demand due to diet changes or other eco￾nomic features. One recent threat to food security is the appearance and dissemina￾tion of emerging pests that can threaten agricultural systems. Olive production in 
Southern Italy or citrus production in Florida, where orange production decreased 
by 90% in 10 years, are two examples of emerging pest problems that are diffcult 
to contain in their centers of origin. The expansion of global trade among plant 
nurseries is a main cause of concern for the dissemination of emerging pests and 
diseases.
Food safety refers to health issues from the standpoint of ensuring that market￾able foods are both healthy and nutritious. Health-related problems in food produc￾tion may appear like the mad cow disease, caused by dubious animal feeding 
practices. These problems attract substantial attention from a society more and more 
The same DSS builds also a map of recommended applications of N, P, K, 
and contact herbicides and calculates the quantities to be ordered by checking 
the actual stocks. The farmer compares online the prices and conditions of 
different suppliers and confrms the order. According to the weather forecasts, 
dry conditions are expected by October 22 and 23 with rainfall afterward. 
These are appropriate for applying the N and the herbicide. By October 20, an 
email is received from the regional research center advising the use of an 
insecticide at a given rate along with the seed. The farmer confrms online the 
use of the insecticide, which is registered on an external public database of 
pesticide use.
On October 22, the robot fertilizer-sprayer goes to the felds and applies 
urea at variable rates depending on need. It also sprays herbicide only on the 
spots where weeds had been previously detected. After the job is done, the 
farmer confrms online the amounts of N and herbicide used in each feld. 
This information goes to the external databases for subsequent N fertilizer 
and pesticide use.
On November 1, the robot seed drill is sent to the felds to sow and apply 
localized P and K fertilizers at variable rates. The planter will follow always 
the same path as all other machinery to avoid compaction due to traffc.

distant from agriculture and food production processes. Periodically, episodes of 
food chemical or biological contamination occur in many countries and generate 
alarms regarding food safety. One important source of contamination is irrigation 
with untreated wastewater, still common in many world areas and that must be 
avoided by appropriate water treatment. Alarms due to food contamination cause 
great concern among consumers and this is rightly forcing more control and regula￾tion of food production processes from farm to fork. Agronomists must ensure that 
products leaving the farm are always safe for consumption, the major issue being 
inadequate pesticide usage. Another important goal is to enhance the nutritional 
qualities of the food produced. The contents of protein, essential amino acids, vita￾mins, and other nutritional factors must be enhanced where possible by good agron￾omy. Another interesting aspect refers to the positive interactions between nutrition 
and health of certain products such as red wine, nuts, and olive oil that have proven 
health-related benefts but where the content of the benefcial chemical products 
depends in part on the growing conditions. Finally, given the increasing importance 
of gastronomy in affuent societies, agronomists should focus more on ensuring or 
improving organoleptic quality.
Although predictions vary, it is estimated that agricultural production should 
increase by 70% to meet the demand of 9 billion people expected in 2050. Is the 
world going to provide food security for all by 2050? First, it is important to con￾sider that not all agricultural products are used directly for food. Around 10% is 
devoted to industrial crops including biofuels. The remaining 90% is shared between 
food (65%) and animal feed (35%), which results in an overall effciency of crop 
production for food of 0.65. This low effciency is due to the low conversion eff￾ciency of animals mainly for meat production. Here, there are ample differences in 
effciencies among animals, with chickens being the most effcient and cows the 
least (Table 42.2). However, ruminants exploit rangelands (which occupy more land 
than that used in agriculture) that otherwise would not be used for food production. 
This must be taken into consideration when addressing meat production in global 
food assessments. Calls have been made to reduce meat consumption in developed 
countries and this could have an impact on future food security. For instance, if feed 
for meat production was reduced by half, the overall effciency would increase theo￾retically from 0.65 to 0.74, a 14% increase in calories available to humans. Such a 
Table 42.2 Distribution of uses of edible crops and all crops circa 2020
Edible crops Total crops Effciency
Fraction used Fraction used Fraction
Humans 0.65 0.59 1
Pork 0.12 0.11 0.1
Dairy 0.09 0.08 0.4
Beef 0.05 0.05 0.03
Chicken 0.05 0.05 0.12
Eggs 0.04 0.04 0.22
The effciency of conversion for energy is taken 1 for humans as direct consumption. Using this 
data, a general effciency of global crop production to food of 0.65 is estimated as the weighted 
average of the effciencies, taking the fraction of use as weighing factors
E. Fereres and F. J. Villalobos639
drastic change would not free as many calories for humans as computed above, as 
animal feed includes pastures, residues, and other nonfood components, so grain 
may be just a supplement and not the basic animal diet. On the other hand, there are 
clear health-related advantages of reducing the amount of animal products in human 
diets, particularly in countries of high consumption where obesity is a growing 
problem.
Another area where improvements will contribute to future food security is 
reducing food waste. The nature of waste varies in different food chains but gener￾ally speaking, food waste in developing countries is primarily due to postharvest 
losses caused by pests and diseases. By contrast, in the developed countries, the 
majority of food losses occur at the consumers’ end of the food chain. Although 
efforts are being made to reduce waste, much of it is related to social and cultural 
factors, which, as in the meat consumption patterns, are diffcult to change. The cur￾rent hype on reducing food waste is probably the result of some overstatements. 
FAO published recently a study providing global “estimates” of losses at different 
levels of the food chain, namely, primary production, processing and distribution, 
and consumption. That study concluded that one-third of the food produced glob￾ally was lost. Thus, one may conclude that available food would increase by 50% if 
those losses were avoided. The problem lies in what is included in the defnition of 
food losses and waste while ignoring alternative uses. Our concern should be how 
much additional food could be made economically available. In fact, only food 
waste arriving at waste processing facilities could partly be avoided. Using data 
from urban waste in Mexican cities, a value of 5% of food dry matter is being lost 
and that includes inedible parts (fruit peels, animal bones, etc.), so the actual value 
of food waste might be only 3–4%. Excessive emphasis on food losses derives from 
studies on perishable products like vegetables where supply and demand imbal￾ances have generated surpluses. However, the relevance of vegetables is small when 
referenced to dry matter, representing only 50 Mt versus the 3000 Mt of major crops 
(cereals and oilseeds) in 2022.
The FAO report computes high food losses in primary production, processing, 
and distribution. However, those “losses” have alternative uses like feed or are eco￾nomically unavoidable. For instance, in the mechanical harvest of winter cereals, a 
3% loss is deemed acceptable. It could be physically possible but not economical 
for humans to pick up that 3% by hand. The same goes for losses during transporta￾tion and handling: They are the result of the best available technologies.
How can then agronomy contribute to food security in the future? We must make 
current agricultural systems more sustainable without losing sight of the need to 
intensify production in existing farmlands. The option of expanding agricultural 
land has signifcant ecological limitations and is not sustainable, as most of the best 
lands have already been put into production. Thus, the sustainable intensifcation of 
production by introducing new techniques adapted to local conditions should con￾tinue that path of increased productivity. Ample opportunities exist for increasing 
both agricultural productivity and sustainability by using good agronomy and 
appropriate crop management practices.

43 Quantitative Analysis of Crop 
Production in an Irrigated Farm (Part I)
Álvaro López-Bernal and Francisco J. Villalobos
Abstract
Degrees in agricultural engineering or agronomy include specifc courses study￾ing crop production techniques derived from agronomy, covering all or part of 
the contents described in this book. In the practical sessions of our class of 
Principles of Agronomy for Sustainable Agriculture at the University of Cordoba, 
a project-based learning methodology is used. The students, grouped in pairs, 
undertake diverse calculations for a specifc location and crop rotation through￾out the course. Each student is assigned a crop within the rotation, but some 
cooperative work is required in some sections, promoting teamwork. At the end 
of the course, each group produces a fnal report and gives an oral presentation 
defending its results. The report and the presentation are used as evaluation 
instruments and contribute to determining the student’s fnal grades. This chapter 
presents an example of the report for a leek-pepper rotation grown in Belmez, 
Spain. The practical project is divided into several sections dealing with (1) anal￾ysis of weather data and calculations of (2) potential productivity, (3) seed rates, 
(4) irrigation schedules, (5) required leaching fraction, (6) fertilizer programs, 
and (7) energy requirements.

43.1 Introduction
The class of Principles of Agronomy for Sustainable Agriculture (PASA) may 
require between 6 and 9 credits according to the European system (1 credit = 25 h 
of student’s work), depending on the actual background of students or the specifc 
interests in some of the topics (e.g., irrigation chapters may be skipped in humid 
environments). This would be equivalent to between 60 and 90 classroom hours 
with basic lectures and practical work split 50%.
In the practical sessions of our PASA course at the University of Córdoba, teams 
of two students undertake diverse calculations for a specifc practical project that 
includes both individual and cooperative work. Each project has a given location 
(with its climate characterized by a real weather station) and a crop rotation (e.g., 
barley/soybean), so each student has a specifc crop species assigned. At the end of 
the semester, each group submits a written report on the project results for evalua￾tion. Likewise, each group gives an oral presentation summarizing the main out￾comes of the project (10 min plus 10 min for questions). At this time, the teacher 
may ask specifc questions to check the ability of the students to support their cal￾culations. The quality of the presentation and the report and the answers to the 
teacher’s questions are major determinants of the student’s fnal grade.
The practical projects we propose are unique as they deal with different locations 
and periods, implying a different weather data set. The other calculations depend on 
the weather data, so they will be different in each case. If no weather data is avail￾able for a specifc location, a weather generator like ClimaSG (https://www.uco.es/
ftotecnia/climasg.html) may be used.
This chapter presents the statement of the practical project used in our PASA 
course (Sect. 43.2) and an example of a written report (Sects. 43.3, 43.4, 43.5, 43.6, 
43.7, 43.8 and 43.9). Additional or alternative sections of the practical project are 
presented in Chap. 44. At the end of the day, the teacher decides the sections that 
should be included and other aspects of the organization. For instance, groups of 
3 students could analyze a 3-year rotation or split the farm into half with feld crops 
(2-year rotation) and the other half with fruit trees or a fodder crop.
The last section of the written report should be a list of references. Apart from 
this book, the students should cite the sources of information for maximum yields 
in their region (Sect. 43.4) and fertilizer prices (Sect. 43.8).
43.2 Practical Project Statement
We will work in groups of 2 students, each with a different crop and the 2 crops will 
make the crop rotation. There are sections that must be performed by each of the 
students with the corresponding crop or option (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Sections 6 and 7 
require cooperative work by the team, while the two students are equally responsi￾ble for section 1. Data on the location, crops, irrigation system characteristics, soil 
fertility, and water quality are shown in Tables 43.1 and 43.2. Water is taken from a 
well using a pump with a diesel engine.

(c) Use CropEBal (https://www.uco.es/ftotecnia/cropebal.html) to check your 
calculations.
43.3 Analysis of Agrometeorological Data
Weather data was downloaded for the assigned location from a public network of 
weather stations in Andalusia (“Red de Información Agroclimática de Andalucía,” 
https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/ifapa/riaweb/web/). The weather 
station in Belmez is located in the north of the province of Cordoba, Spain (38.3°N, 
5.2°W, 523 m altitude). At the time of preparation of this report, the weather station 
had been operating for 13 complete years. Downloaded data included daily values of 
maximum (Tmax, °C) and minimum temperature (Tmin, °C), maximum (RHmax, %) and 
minimum relative humidity (RHmin, %), solar radiation (Rs, MJ m−2
), precipitation (P, 
mm), and average wind speed (U, m s−1
).

Table 43.3 shows the average values of all weather data. Averages and totals were 
computed using Microsoft Excel. Effective precipitation was estimated from 
monthly rainfall with the FAO equations (Eqs. 8.22a and 8.22b).
Table 43.4 shows the results for the other variables requested. Calculations were 
performed for each day as described below; then monthly averages and totals were 
deduced:
– Day length (Ns, h) was computed from solar declination, which depends on the 
date (Eq. 3.4) and the latitude (Eqs. 3.8 and 3.10).
– Average vapor pressure defcit (VPD, kPa) was calculated with Eq. 5.7, which 
implicitly assumes that the maximum and minimum relative humidity occur at 
the time of minimum and maximum temperature, respectively.
43 Quantitative Analysis of Crop Production in an Irrigated Farm (Part I)646
– Clear-sky solar radiation (Rs,clear, MJ m−2
 day−1
) was calculated for clear-sky con￾ditions as 75% of extraterrestrial radiation (i.e., for ns/Ns = 1 in Eq. 3.5). The 
latter was estimated from the day of the year and the latitude using Eq. 3.7.
– Net radiation over grass (Rn, MJ m−2
 day−1
) was computed from Eq. 3.13, where 
the albedo (α) was set to 0.23 (grass) and the longwave radiation losses were 
calculated with Eq. 3.11. The actual ratio ns/Ns and average vapor pressure were 
estimated by inverting Eq. 3.5 and applying Eq. 5.6, respectively.
– Reference evapotranspiration (ET0, mm day−1
) was calculated with the Penman￾Monteith-FAO (Eq. 10.3) and the Hargreaves (Eq. 10.2) methods. For the latter, 
the coeffcient was set to 0.16, as Belmez is far from the coast.
– The number of rainy days per month (NRD, days month−1
) was calculated by 
considering only those days with precipitation exceeding 0.5 mm as “rainy.”
43.4 Productivity
43.4.1 Leek Sown 1 October
The average duration of the 4 stages assumed for the calculations were 30-30-120-30 
days. The base temperature is 3 °C. Using average monthly temperatures for this 
location (estimated as the average of the Tmax and Tmin values for each month in 
Table 43.3) and assuming months of 30 days, the thermal time required to complete 
each of the 4 stages (TT) is:
Stage A (October):
TTA = × 30 ( ) 16. C 3 3 − = ° 399 day
Stage B (November):
TTB = × 30 ( ) 10. C 15 − 3 = ° 214 day
Stage C (December, January, February, March):
TTC = × 30 ( ) 7 4. . − 3 3 + ×0 7( ) 1 3 − + × 30 ( ) 7 9. C − 3 3 + ×0 1( ) 1 3 − = ° 641 day
Stage D (April):
TTD = × 30 ( ) 13. C 2 3 − = ° 307 day
Using the mean daily temperatures of the last campaign (2012/2013), we summed 
thermal time starting from October 1 until we accumulated the thresholds indicated 
above. According to this, the end of the four stages was estimated to occur on 
November 2 (stage A), November 27 (stage B), April 7 (stage C), and May 4 
(stage D).
The fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (fPI) was 
calculated for each day as a function of the crop coeffcient (see Sect. 13.7 in Chap. 
13). The maximum Kc for leek is 1.2 and the fnal Kc is 1.0. According to the project 
statement, we assumed fPI = 0.1 in stage A and fPI = Kc−0.3 in stages C and D. The 
values for stage B were calculated by linear interpolation between 0.1 (November 2) 
Á. López-Bernal and F. J. Villalobos647
and 0.9 (November 27). Likewise, the values for stage D were calculated by linear 
interpolation between 0.9 (April 7) and 0.7 (May 4).
Intercepted PAR for each day (IPARi) of the growing cycle was determined as:
IPAR R f i s = × × Pi 0 4. 5
where 0.45 is the ratio of PAR over solar radiation. Summing the values for the 
whole growing cycle, a total intercepted PAR of 846 MJ m−2
 was obtained.
The expected Radiation-Use Effciency (RUE) was calculated with Eq. 13.11. 
Yield composition was taken from Appendix in Chap. 35. On a dry matter basis, 9% 
is protein and 2% is fat. For simplicity, it is assumed that the remainder (89%) are 
carbohydrates. In the calculations, we considered an RUE for carbohydrates (RUEc) 
of 2 g MJ−1
 (C3 species) and a harvest index of 0.5, which led to an expected RUE
of 1.94 g MJ−1
.
Potential yield (on a dry matter basis) was calculated with Eq. 13.8:
Y H= ×I RUE × = ∑ IPARi × × = −
emergence
harvest
0 5 1 94 846 819gm 2 . .
Fresh yield was calculated by considering the fraction of dry matter in the har￾vested organ (fdm), which is 17% (Appendix in Chap. 35):
Y Y f t ha fresh d = = m = = − − / / 819 0 1. . 7 4817 48 2 2 1 gm
The average fresh yield in Spain is around 33 t ha−1
, which is lower than the 
calculated yield. The difference may be attributed to other factors limiting yield 
(water and nutrient defciencies, pests and diseases, incorrect management, etc.).
43.4.2 Pepper Sown 1 May
The average duration of the 4 stages assumed for the calculations were 20-35-40-20 
days. The base temperature is 7 °C. Using mean monthly temperatures for our loca￾tion, the thermal time required to complete each of the 4 stages was:
Stage A (May 1–May 20):
TTA = × 20 ( ) 17. C 3 7 − = ° 206 day
Stage B (May 20–30, June 1–25):
TTB = × 10 ( ) 17. C 3 7 − + × 25 ( ) 23− 7 = ° 503 day

Using the mean daily temperatures of the last campaign (2012/2013), we summed 
thermal time starting from May 1, until we accumulated the thresholds above. 
According to this, the end of the four stages was estimated to occur on May 25 
(stage A), July 1 (stage B), August 8 (stage C), and August 24 (stage D).
Again, the fraction of intercepted PAR was computed for each day as a function 
of Kc. The maximum Kc is 1.1 and the fnal Kc is 0.85 (mid values of the intervals 
shown in Appendix C in Chap. 10). We assumed fPI = 0.1 in stage A and fPI = Kc
−0.3 in stages C and D. The values for stage B were calculated by linear interpola￾tion between 0.1 (May 25) and 0.8 (July 1). Similarly, the values for stage D were 
calculated by linear interpolation between 0.8 (August 8) and 0.55 (August 24).
Intercepted PAR was estimated daily as in leek. Summing the values for the 
growing cycle, total intercepted PAR was 748 MJ m−2
. According to Appendix in 
Chap. 35, the average composition of red pepper on a dry matter basis is 11.3% 
protein and 2.8% fat. For simplicity, it is assumed that the remainder (85.9%) are 
carbohydrates. In Table 13.1, the maximum value for the HI of pepper is 0.6. A 
value of 0.55 was considered for the calculations. As we are dealing again with a C3 
species, RUEc was set to 2 g MJ−1
. Under these conditions, the expected RUE was 
1.92 g MJ−1
.
Using Eq. 13.8, yield (dry matter) was 790 g m−2
. According to Appendix in 
Chap. 35, fdm is 12.5%, leading to a fresh yield of 63.19 t ha−1
. The average fresh 
yield of feld-grown pepper in Andalusia, Spain, in 2012 was 32.52 t/ha, around 
50% of the calculated yield. The difference may be attributed to other factors (dif￾ferent growing cycles, water and nutrient defciencies, pests and diseases, incorrect 
management, etc.).
43.5 Seed Rates
In the calculations, we assumed that high-quality certifed seed is used, so high 
viability (f1 = 0.9) was considered for both crops.
43.5.1 Leek
According to Table 16.2, typical values of seed weight and planting density for leek 
are 2.8 mg seed−1
 and 25 plants m−2
, respectively. The seeds are very small, so a low 
fraction of emergence (f2 = 0.7) was assumed. Applying Eq. 16.1, the estimated seed 
rate yielded 1.1 kg ha−1
.
43.5.2 Pepper
According to Table 16.2, seed weight ranges between 5 and 10 mg seed−1
 (we took 
7.5 mg seed−1
) and planting density between 4 and 6 plants m−2
 (we took 5 plants 
m−2
). The seeds are very small, so a low fraction of emergence (f2  =  0.7) was 
assumed. Applying Eq. 16.1, the seed rate yielded 0.6 kg ha−1
.

43.6 Irrigation Schedules
43.6.1 Leek
The initial crop coeffcient (Kc,ini) was calculated as a function of average daily ET0
and the number of rainy days in stage A. In the last season (2012/2013), we had 7 
rainy days in 33 days (Phase A). Thus, the fraction of wet days (fw) was 0.21 and the 
wetting interval (WI):
WI
f f w w
= ( ) − = 1
0 75 1
8 . days
As WI > 4 days, Eq. 10.6b was applied, yielding a Kc,ini of 0.57. The mid and fnal 
values of the Kc for leek are 1.2 and 1.0, respectively. With these values and the 
duration of the 4 phases, the Kc curve was built (Fig. 43.1). Daily ET was calculated 
as the product of Kc and ET0.
The soil is of medium texture, so a plant available water (PAW) of 120 mm m−1
was assumed. Allowable Depletion (AD) was calculated using Eq. 20.5, where a 
value of 0.14 was used for FAD. As leek is not in Appendix C in Chap. 10, we 
adopted the value for onion, which is a close relative. The maximum ET0 during the 
cycle was 3.7 mm day−1
 (April). As a result, AD was 0.51. The maximum rooting 
depth of leek was not given in Appendix C in Chap. 10. By analogy, we adopted the 
minimum value (0.5 m) of the range reported for onion (interval 0.5–0.8 m).
The critical soil water defcit (SWDc) was calculated as the product of PAW, AD, 
and rooting depth (Eq. 20.2), yielding 30 mm. Following the basic rule for irrigation 
scheduling (Chap. 20), irrigation was applied whenever SWD was expected to 
exceed 30 mm and the applied depth was equal to the value of SWD to restore soil

water to feld capacity, minimizing the number of irrigations (Fig. 43.2). As rainfall 
is frequent during most of the growing season, we did not bother calculating the 
variation of SWDc in the initial stages of crop growth, using directly its maxi￾mum value.
According to the rules, fve irrigations would be required on dates 44, 104, 108, 
114, and 123 (day of the year). However, the fnal irrigation was recalculated to 
leave the soil as dry as possible and to save water. Typically, feld crops may end 
their growing cycle depleting 80–90% of PAW, but we should be more conservative 
as leek is harvested green. Considering a 60–70% use of PAW, the target SWD at the 
end of the cycle is around 36–43 mm. This was achieved by eliminating the last 
irrigation, which led to a fnal SWD of 44 mm and total net irrigation requirements 
of 120 mm for the season.
The hourly net application rate is calculated from the discharge rate of the sprin￾klers (q), their spacing (A), and the application effciency (AE), all of them given in 
Table 43.2:
q AE
A
× = − 6 375 1 . mm h
This value is used for calculating the duration of irrigation events. The irrigation 
schedule includes four 4.7 h irrigations on the days of year 44, 104, 108, and 114.
43.6.2 Pepper
In phase A (May 2013), we had 4 rainy days in 25 days and the average ET0
was 4.4  mm  day−1
. Therefore, fw and WI were 0.16 and 9.6  days, respectively. 
Á. López-Bernal and F. J. Villalobos651
These values led to a Kc,ini of 0.41 using Eq. 10.6b. The mid and fnal values of Kc
were 1.1 and 0.85 (Appendix C in Chap. 10). The Kc curve is shown in Fig. 43.3. 
Daily ET was calculated as the product of Kc and ET0.
In the calculation of SWDc, a PAW of 120  mm/m was again considered. The 
maximum ET0 during the cycle was 7.7 mm day−1
 (July) and FAD is 0.14 for pepper 
according to Appendix C in Chap. 10. Following Eq. 20.5, AD results −0.08. As this 
value is below zero, we adopt an AD of 0.2. The maximum rooting depth of pepper 
was taken from Appendix C in Chap. 10. We adopted the maximum value for the 
interval (1.0 m) which equals soil depth. Otherwise, SWDc takes a small value not 
suitable for sprinkler irrigation. Considering all this, the calculated SWDc was 24 mm.
Following the basic rule (Chap. 20), irrigation was applied whenever SWD was 
expected to exceed 24 mm and the applied depth was equal to the existing SWD to 
restore soil water to feld capacity (Fig. 43.4). In May 2013, the SWD was eventu￾ally negative, which means that some percolation could occur, but it was assumed 
as negligible. According to the rules, 23 irrigations of 24 mm would be required 
from DOY 133 to DOY 233. However, we need to leave the soil as dry as possible. 
Considering that the crop is harvested green, we were conservative and adopted a 
60% use of PAW by the end of the cycle, which implies fnishing the season with a 
SWD of 72 mm. This was achieved by eliminating the last two irrigations, leading 
to total net irrigation requirements of 504 mm for the season.
As seen before, the irrigation system delivers 6.375  mm  h−1
, so irrigations 
should last 3.76 h. Irrigation should be applied in the days of year 133, 159, 165, 
172, 176, 179, 182, 185, 188, 191, 193, 197, 200, 203, 206, 210, 213, 216, 219, 
222, and 225.

43.7 Leaching Fraction Required
The amount of irrigation that should be added to that calculated in Sect. 43.6 to 
obtain maximum yield is calculated here. Irrigation water has an ECw of 1.7 dS m−1
(Table 43.2).
43.7.1 Leek
Appendix in Chap. 24 shows the threshold EC for maximum yield (ECeu) for differ￾ent crops but does not include leek. We adopted the parameters of a closely related 
species, onion (ECeu = 1.2 dS/m). As we use sprinkler irrigation, Eq. 24.10 was 
applied, yielding a required Leaching Fraction (LFr) of 0.56. Now, the amount of 
water to maintain maximum yield will be (Eq. 24.9):
I = − = = 120 −
1 0 56
273 2730 3 1
. mm m ha
The duration of irrigations should be corrected accordingly. This implies that the 
4.7 h duration should be increased to 10.7 h.
Á. López-Bernal and F. J. Villalobos653
43.7.2 Pepper
ECeu for pepper is 1.5 dS m−1
 (Appendix in Chap. 24). As we use sprinkler irriga￾tion, Eq. 24.10 was applied, yielding a required Leaching Fraction (LFr) of 0.38. 
The amount of water to apply must be:
I = − = = 504 −
1 0 38
813 8130 3 1
. mm m ha
Therefore, the duration of irrigations (3.76 h) should be increased to 6.06 h.
43.7.3 Farm
The average irrigation requirement for the whole farm is obtained as the average for 
the two crops, which is 5430 m3
 ha−1
.
43.8 Fertilizer Program
43.8.1 N Fertilization
The N fertilizer requirement (Nf) was estimated using Eq. 27.7, with the following 
assumptions:
– Residual N (Nend): 10 kg ha−1
 (lowest value in the range indicated in Box 27.2)
– Ratio of N in roots and shoots (fNR): 0.2
– Mineralization coeffcient (kim): 0.7 (non-legumes with tillage)
– Total N received by atmospheric deposition and irrigation water (Nother): 10 kg/ha 
(upper value in the range indicated in Sect. 27.2.3)
– Fraction of residues left in the feld (Fres): 1 for the two crops, as indicated in the 
practical project statement
– Fraction of applied N lost (n): 0.1 (we aim at a high effciency)
The N in yield and residues was calculated for each crop as:
N Y yield y = ⋅NC ield
N Y HI
HI res r = NC es
1−
where Y is dry yield and NCyield and NCres are the N concentrations in the harvested 
organ and the residues, respectively. Y was taken as 80% of the value calculated in 
Sect. 43.4, as required by the project statement. NCyield and NCres were taken crop 
from Appendix in Chap. 26. The values used for the calculations are given in 
Table 43.5.

The values of yield (dry matter), concentration of N in the harvested organ (NCyield) and residues 
(NCres), and amounts of N in yield (Nyield) and residues (Nres) are also shown
The calculated N requirements (Nf) were 142 kg N ha−1
 for leek and 128 kg N ha−1
for pepper (Table 43.5). These amounts may be supplied with urea, which has a 
concentration of 0.46 kg N kg−1
 (Table 25.2). The results are shown in Table 43.5. 
The average use of urea in the farm corresponds to the average for the two crops, 
i.e., 294 kg urea ha−1
.
43.8.2 P and K Fertilization
A build-up and maintenance strategy was followed for calculating the P and K 
requirements (Pf and Kf). According to our data, Olsen P is 18 mg kg−1
 (Table 43.2). 
The threshold STL is calculated using Eq. 28.1. The soil is sandy loam, so we 
assume a clay content of 70 mg/kg (Table 8.2) and pH = 8, so the threshold is 17.4. 
Therefore, we are in the maintenance range and fertilizers should only add the 
amount of P exported. The same applies to K since the corresponding soil test level 
(300 mg kg−1;Table 43.2) exceeds the threshold (175 mg kg−1
; Table 28.3), but it is 
below the maintenance level (which is twice the threshold, i.e., 350 mg kg−1
).
As only yield is exported, Pf and Kf were estimated from:
P Y f y = × PC ield
K Y f y = ×KC ield
where Y is yield (on a dry matter basis), assumed as 80% of the value calculated in 
Sect. 43.4, and PCyield and KCyield are the concentrations of P and K in the harvested 
organ, which were taken from Appendix in Chap. 28. Fertilizer requirements were 
calculated considering their richness in P or K (Table 25.2). We will use straight 
fertilizers like triple superphosphate (TSP, 20% P) and potassium chloride (KCl, 
50% K) for both crops. The results are shown in Table 43.6. The average use of TSP 
and KCl in the farm corresponds to the average for the two crops, i.e., 83 kg TSP ha−1
and 223 kg KCl ha−1
.
43.8.3 Cost of the Fertilization Program
Our fertilizer dealer sells TSP at 300 € t−1
, KCl at 550 € t−1
, and urea at 550 € t−1
. 
Using these prices, the purchase of fertilizers at the farm requires 24.9 € ha−1
 year−1

43.8.4 Comparison with FertiliCalc Outputs
Our estimates of fertilizer requirements for P and K matched those obtained with 
FertiliCalc (Table 43.7). For N, the amounts of urea calculated by FertiliCalc were 
slightly higher for pepper and slightly lower for leek, but the value for the rotation 
was similar to our estimates.
43.9 Crops Calendars and Energy Requirements
43.9.1 Crop Calendars
We assume that the farm is divided into two felds of equal size (feld 1 and feld 2) 
and show in a simple diagram the distribution of the crops (L for leek and P for pep￾per) during the 2 years of the rotation (Table 43.8).
Then we establish the crop calendar for one of the felds. For instance, the calen￾dar for feld 1 is shown in Table 43.9. The crop calendar for feld 2 would be the 
same but starting with year 2.

Abstract
In the class of Principles of Agronomy for Sustainable Agriculture at the 
University of Cordoba, students are grouped in pairs to analyze a crop rotation in 
a specifc location. At the end of the semester, the students produce a written 
report and give an oral presentation of the main results. These activities are major 
determinants for the fnal grade of the students. The previous chapter presents a 
solved example of a practical project for a leek-pepper rotation grown in Belmez, 
Spain. Here we show a set of additional assignments for the practical project, 
presenting the solution for the same location and crop rotation. Sections within 
this chapter are related to frost protection, crop evapotranspiration, irrigation, 
salinity, fertilization, soil erosion, runoff, modifying the environment, and pesti￾cide application.
44.1 Introduction
Here we show a series of sections that may be included as additional assignments 
for the practical project described in Chap. 43. For the sake of simplicity, we present 
the solution for each of them considering the same crop rotation (leek-pepper), loca￾tion (Belmez, Cordoba), and farm characteristics.

The sections are related to frost protection (44.2–44.4), ET (44.5–44.7), irriga￾tion and salinity (44.8–44.10), fertilization (44.11–44.13), soil erosion and runoff 
(44.14 and 44.15), modifying the environment (44.16 and 44.17), and application of 
pesticides (44.18).
44.2 Probability of Frost
Calculate the probability of frost after March 1 and before December 1.
The dates of the frst and the last frost in every season are shown in Table 44.1.
44.2.1 Probability of Frost After March 1
The probability is calculated using Eqs. 32.2 and 32.1. March 1 corresponds to day 
181 after September 1 (t = 181), and the mean (mLF) and standard deviation (sLF) of 
the last frost were, respectively, 194.2 and 11.4 (Table 44.1), so:

Therefore, the probability of frost occurring after March 1 is 88%.
44.2.2 Probability of Frost Before December 1
Equations 32.2 and 32.3 should be applied this time, using the mean (mFF) and stan￾dard deviation (sFF) of the date of the frst autumn frost (Table 44.1). December 1 
corresponds to day 91 after September 1 (t = 91).

44.3 Certainty of Not Exceeding a Minimum Temperature
Calculate the certainty of minimum temperature not being lower than −13 °C in a 
period of 20 years.
The minimum temperature in the period from September 1 to May 1 is given for 
each year in Table 44.1. The minimum annual temperature in Belmez has an aver￾age (m) of −5.82 °C and a standard deviation (s) of 1.67 °C.
The certainty was calculated with Eq. 32.6. Input parameters are the temperature 
threshold under consideration (Tc = −13 °C), the design period (nd = 20 years), and 
two coeffcients which depend on the mean and standard deviation of minimum 
temperature (α = s/1.283 = 1.30 °C; β = m + 0.577α = −5.06 °C). Therefore, the 
certainty of temperature not being lower than −13 °C is:

The probability of frost before a given date (t) can be calculated with Eqs. 32.2
and 32.3. These can be inverted for estimating the date of the frst frost (t) at a given

44.5 Transpiration of an Isolated Tree
Calculate the transpiration of an isolated cypress with a crown of height of 6 m and 
width of 1 m in your location during July.
The mean ET0 in July in Belmez is 7.7 mm day−1
. If the tree crown can be repre￾sented by a spheroid with length h = 6 m and horizontal radius r = 0.5 m, the pro￾jected envelope area for 1 rad (PEA1) will be given by Eq. 3.24. For spheroids, the 
coeffcients ap and bp are 0.3 and 0.35, respectively, which leads to PEA1 = 3.53 m2
.
The mean interception of the tree envelope for 1 rad (c1) can be calculated from 
Eqs. 3.25 and 3.26. For spheroids, cp = 0.64 and dp = 0.026. Assuming a leaf area

For isolated trees, transpiration (Ep tree) can be calculated as the product of REA
(1.5 m2

; Table 43.4), and the transpiration ratio for full inter￾ception (Ktf), which takes different values for different species (Eq. 9.19). Taking 
Á. López-Bernal and F. J. Villalobos663
Ktf  =  1.1, reported for olive trees in Table 9.1, an evergreen species adapted to 
Mediterranean areas as cypresses, Ep tree is 12.7 L day−1
.
44.6 Calculation of ET for Designing an Irrigation System
Calculate the maximum ET that should be considered for designing the irrigation 
system assuming summer crops as maize or cotton.
The maximum ET0 in our location (Belmez) occurs in July (average of 
7.7 mm day−1
). At that time, summer crops have already achieved maximum cover, 
so expansion is no longer critical for crop productivity. Thus, an allowable depletion 
(AD) of 0.67 can be adopted. The soil is of medium texture, so a plant available 
water (PAW) of 120 mm m−1
 is assumed. Maximum root depth is restricted by soil 
depth (1 m). Therefore, the critical SWD will be:
SWDc = × 0 6. m 7 120× =1 80 m
This will be the typical irrigation dose if the basic rule (Chap. 20) is adopted. On 
the other hand, the maximum Kc for summer crops is 1.2. Therefore, for an ET0 of 
7.7 mm day−1
, the daily ET will be 9.2 mm day−1
. The climate in our location is 
semiarid (climate type 1 in Sect. 10.6) so C = 1.21. Therefore:

75 = − 0 0. . 6 1 ( ) − = − 1 21 0. . 06( ) 1 21 1− 80 = 1.097
where ETavg is the average crop ET (9.2 mm day−1
), Ia the mean irrigation applied 
(80 mm), and ET75 the ET exceeded in 25% of the years only, which should be used 
for designing irrigation systems. Under our conditions, the latter will be 
10.1 mm day−1
.
44.7 Calculation of ET Inside an Unheated Greenhouse
Calculate the ET of a tomato crop in May with full ground cover inside an unheated 
greenhouse with polyethylene cladding. Assume a transmissivity for solar radia￾tion of 0.7.
Reference ET (ET0) inside the greenhouse can be calculated using Eq. 10.10. In 
Belmez, during May, we have an average solar radiation (Rs) of 24.9 MJ m−2
 day−1
(Table 43.3) so the solar radiation inside the greenhouse (Rsi, MJ m−2
 day−1
) can be 
estimated as:
Rsi = × = − − 0 7 24 9 17 4 2 1 . . . MJ m day
The average temperature in May is 17.3 °C so the slope of the saturated vapor 
pressure versus temperature (Δ) is 0.12 kPa K−1
 (Eq. 10.4). Under these conditions, 
Eq. 10.10 leads to an ET0 of:

The maximum crop coeffcient (Kc) for tomato in the open is 1.2 (Appendix C in 
Chap. 10). In a greenhouse, crop coeffcients tend to be 10–20% higher. Assuming 
an increase of 15% in Kc (i.e., Kc = 1.38), crop ET would be 4.3 mm day−1
.
44.8 Optimum Seasonal Irrigation
Calculate the optimum seasonal irrigation for your crops in the last season with 
weather data. Consider prices of water 0.05 € m−3
 and 0.50 € m−3
. Assume that the 
average yields of your crops under no water stress are 80% of the maximum (calcu￾lated in Sect. 43.4). Distribution uniformity is 0.70. Assume that soil evaporation is 
25% of ET.
We will apply Eq. 23.12 for estimating the optimum irrigation amounts (Iopt). 
This equation requires data on the price of water (QI), total crop evapotranspiration 
(ET), soil evaporation (Es), distribution uniformity (DUlq), price of the crop at har￾vest (PH), maximum yield (Yx), and net irrigation requirements (Ireq):

80% of potential dry yields are 6550 and 6316  kg  ha−1
 for leek and pepper, 
respectively. After searching for prices for the farmer, we found selling prices of 
harvest of 0.255 € kg−1
 for leek and 0.25 € kg−1
 for pepper. Considering the fractions 
of dry matter in the harvested organ reported in Appendix in Chap. 35 (0.17 for leek 
and 0.125 for pepper), PH was estimated as 1.5  €  kg−1
 for leek and 2.0  €  kg−1
for pepper.
Seasonal ET (calculated in Sect. 43.6) is 398 mm for leek and 619 mm for pep￾per. As Es represents 25% of total ET, the seasonal Es is 99.5  mm for leek and 
155 mm for pepper. Ireq (calculated in Sect. 43.6) was 120 mm for leek and 504 mm 
for pepper in the 2012/2013 campaign.
Results for the two prices of water and the two crops are reported in Table 44.2. 
In summary, with cheap water, we should apply a gross amount of 194 mm to leek 
and 808 mm to pepper. With expensive water, the gross amounts should be 155 
(leek) and 623 mm (pepper).

44.9 Comparison of Alternative Water Qualities and Prices
The cost of pumping (energy + depreciation cost) is 0.10 € m−3
. You have two offers 
of irrigation water. Water A has ECw = 1 dS m−1
 and a price of 0.10 € m−3
. Water B 
has ECw = 1.5 dS m−1
 and a price of 0.05 € m−3
. Select the best option for your crops. 
Assume that the average yields of your crops under no water stress are 80% of the 
potential values (calculated in Sect. 43.4).

where B′ = Bs/100, PH is the selling price of harvest (€ kg−1

), Ireq is net irrigation requirement (m3
 ha−1
), 
QI is the price of water (€ m−3
), and ECeu is the threshold electrical conductivity for 
maximum yield (dS/m).
As the inequality indicates, the solution is valid below the value of I at which 
maximum yield is achieved. According to the statement, Ymax is 80% of the potential 
dry yield, 6550 kgha−1
 for leek and 6316 kg ha−1
 for pepper. After searching for 
prices for the farmer, we found selling prices of harvest of 0.255 € kg−1
 for leek and 
0.25  €  kg−1
 for pepper. Considering the fractions of dry matter in the harvested 
organ reported in Appendix in Chap. 35 (0.17 for leek and 0.125 for pepper), PH
(dry matter basis) was estimated as 1.5 € kg−1
 for leek and 2.0 € kg−1
 for pepper. Ireq
(calculated in Sect. 43.6) was 1200 m3
 ha−1
 for leek and 5040 m3
 ha−1
 for pepper in 
the 2012/2013 campaign.
Results for the two waters and the two crops are reported in Table 44.3. In both 
cases, the second term of the equation above is lower, so the maximum yield will be 
reached. For both crops, we get a higher beneft using the cheaper water (B).

44 Quantitative Analysis of Crop Production in an Irrigated Farm (Part II)666
The optimum leaching requirement (LFopt) can be calculated with Eq. 24.14, 
valid whenever it is lower than that the LF required for maximum yield (LFlimit). The 
electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw) is 1.7 dS/m (Table 43.2).
44.10.1 Leek
Appendix in Chap. 24 does not include leek so we adopt the parameters of a closely 
related species, onion. The threshold ECeu is 1.2 dS m−1
 and the slope Bs is 16.1% 
(dS/m)−1

According to Appendix in Chap. 24 the threshold ECeu is 1.5 dS m−1
 and the slope 
Bs is 14% (dS/m)−1
, so B′  =  0.14. Using the same equations, LFopt  =  0.20 and 
LFlimit = 0.29 are deduced. Therefore, the optimum LF will be 0.20.
44.11 Sulfur Exports in a Rotation
Calculate the exports of sulfur in your rotation. Modify the fertilizer program to 
compensate for these exports. Assume that the average yield of your crop is 80% of 
the estimated maximum. The concentration of S is 4  g/kg for leek and 1  g/kg 
for pepper.
Sulfur exports (Sexport) can be calculated by considering dry yield (Y), the fraction 
of residues left in the feld (Fres), and sulfur concentrations in the harvested organ 
(SCyield) and residues (SCres):
S Y SC F
HI
HI export y = × ield + − ( ) res r Y SC es

In our leek-pepper rotation, residues are left in the feld (Fres = 1), so the exports 
are directly calculated from the product of Y and SCyield. The results are presented in 
Table 44.4.

Crop rotation 16.25
To compensate for the exported sulfur, we have several alternatives to the fertil￾ization plan proposed for our leek-pepper rotation in Sect. 43.8. For instance, we may:
(a) Use superphosphate instead of triple superphosphate
The P requirement for the rotation was 16.5 kg P ha−1
 (Table 43.6) that may be sup￾plied by 206 kg/ha of superphosphate (8% P, 12% S; Table 25.2). With this amount, 
we are adding 24.75 kg S ha−1
. This is 8 kg S ha−1
 above the S requirement.
(b) Use potassium sulfate instead of potassium chloride
The K requirement for the rotation is 111  kg  K  ha−1
 (Table 43.6), equivalent to 
267 kg ha−1
 of potassium sulfate (41.5% K, 17% S; Table 25.2). Therefore, we will 
supply 45.5 kg S ha−1
, almost 30 kg S ha−1
 above the S requirement.
(c) Use ammonium sulfate instead of urea
The N requirement for the rotation is 135 kg N ha−1
 (Table 43.5). Using ammonium 
sulfate (21% N, 24% S; Table 25.2), we need 643 kg ha−1
 of the fertilizer, supplying 
also 154 kg S ha−1
, which implies a huge S excess.
(d) Use ammonium nitrosulfate instead of urea
Using ammonium nitrosulfate (26% N, 12% S; Table 25.2), we need 519 kg ha−1
 of 
the fertilizer, supplying 62 kg S ha−1
, which is clearly above sulfur requirements.
Comparing the different alternatives, the frst (superphosphate) is the one closest 
to the objective of compensating exported sulfur.
44.12 Selection of the Best Fertilizers
The prices of different fertilizers are shown in Table 44.5. (A) Calculate the best 
combination for your rotation assuming that around 30% of N and all P and K are 
applied before planting. (B) Repeat the calculations if sulfur exports have to be 
compensated with fertilizers.
For our crop rotation, annual requirements of P, K, and S were, respectively, 
16.5 kg P ha−1
 (Table 43.6), 111 kg K ha−1
 (Table 43.6), and 16 kg S ha−1
 (Sect. 
44.11). N fertilizer requirements were 142 kg N ha−1
 for leek and 128 kg N ha−1
 for 
pepper (Table 43.5).
The amounts of fertilizers needed to satisfy these requirements are calculated 
considering their concentration of N, P, and K (Table 25.2).

A. In general, the most economical option is using straight fertilizers. For P, how￾ever, DAP is competitive with TSP as it includes some N. The best alternatives 
are shown in Table 44.6.
B. Table 44.7 below shows different combinations of three to four products that 
meet the sulfur requirements. The most expensive option is the one that includes 
potassium sulfate. The cheapest alternative includes ammonium sulfate, DAP, 
urea, and potassium chloride. In this case, ammonium sulfate, DAP, and potas￾sium chloride would be applied before planting and all the urea would be applied 
as top dressing. DAP is slightly better than TSP (compare alternatives 2 and 4).
44.13 Leaching Index
Calculate the Leaching Index in your location.
The LI is calculated as the product of a Percolation Index (PI) and a Seasonal 
Index (SI). The former is calculated using Eq. 26.4. Inputs include annual rainfall 
(P = 533 mm in our location; Table 43.3) and a modifed curve number (CN′) that 
takes values of 28, 21, 17, and 15 for hydrologic groups A, B, C, and D, respectively 
(Chap. 8). Our soil is of medium texture, so we will assume that the hydrologic 
group is B (CN′ = 21), which leads to:

SI represents the concentration of rainfall during the winter period, and it can be 
calculated using Eq. 26.5, which requires total rainfall during autumn-winter (Pw, 
October 1 to March 31  in N latitudes) and annual rainfall (P). In our location 
Pw = 376.6 mm and P = 533 mm, which leads to:

44.14 Calculation of Soil Erosion
Calculate soil erosion for your rotation. Assume that the slope is 2% and the slope 
length is 100 m. Tillage is performed in the direction of the slope. Consider also that 
in your location, rainfall erosivity may be calculated as:
R P = ∑ 12 6 ( ) i P − 250 2 . /
where Pi is the mean monthly rainfall of month i and P is the total annual rainfall.
Considering the data reported in Table 43.3, Σ(Pi
2
/P) = 58.2 mm so R = 483. The 
factors related to soil erodibility (K), to the effect of the cover and management (C), 
to soil steepness (NT) and tillage direction (P) can be taken from Table 18.1. We 
select K = 0.027 (sandy loam soil with low organic matter), C = 0.37 (mid value 
with plow), NT = 0.3 (slope of 2%), and P = 1 (tillage in the direction of the slope).
The slope steepness and length factor (LS) is calculated from Eq. 18.3 from the 
slope (pt = 2%), slope length (lt = 100 m), and NT (0.3):

starting on the frst year of the weather data set. Consider separately the two crops 
of your rotation. Assume that the soil is very wet.
Our soil is medium texture, so we assume that the hydrologic group is B. In our 
location, Belmez, we have a rainfall of 51.8 mm on January 11, 2001. The farm is 
divided in two plots (one for leek, the other for pepper).
44.15.1 Leek Plot
At the time of the rainfall, the crop is in the feld so the hydrologic condition is good. 
From Table 8.2, we take row crops in straight rows for hydrologic group B with 
good hydrologic conditions, so CN2=78. As the soil is wet, we assume that 
CN = CN3, which is deduced from Eq. 8.17:

At the time of the rainfall event, the crop is not in the feld. In Table 8.2, we take bare 
soil for hydrologic group B, so CN2  =  86. As the soil is wet, we assume that 
CN = CN3, which is deduced from Eq. 8.17:

44.16 Calculation of the Maximum Temperature Inside 
an Unheated Greenhouse
Calculate the maximum temperature on a clear day in May inside the unheated PE 
greenhouse, which has a height of 3 m and is occupied by a tomato crop with full 
ground cover. The air inside is renewed 25 times per hour.
The maximum temperature in May is 24.9 °C (Table 43.3) and solar radiation on 
clear days is 29.8 MJ m−2
 day−1
 (Table 43.4). For transmissivity of 0.7, Rsi on a clear 
day in May will be:
Rsin = × = − − 0 7 29 8 20 86 2 1 . . . MJ m day

where Ns is the day length (Table 43.4). Now, we will use Eq. 31.3 to deduce the 
temperature inside the greenhouse (Tin) as a function of the temperature outside 
(Tout = 24.9 °C). For a temperature of 24.9 °C, Δ is 0.19 kPa K−1
 (Eq. 10.4). As vapor 
pressure in May is 0.89 kPa, assuming Pat = 101 kPa, ρCp will be 1207 J m−3
 K−1
(Eq.  5.9). kRN is the ratio of net radiation/solar radiation inside the greenhouse, 
which may be taken as 0.7 (Sect. 31.14). As the crop has reached full cover, we 
assume that ET is the equilibrium evaporation so their ratio, kL, is 1. Greenhouse 
height (hg = 3 m) and renovation rate (RR = 25 times h−1
) are known. All this leads to:

44.17 Shading by a Windbreak
If you establish a windbreak using a plastic mesh with E-W orientation and height 
of 3 m in your location, calculate the shade width at solar noon on December 21 and 
June 21.
The zenith angle (θ) can be calculated from the latitude (λ = 38.27°), solar decli￾nation (δ = 23.45° on June 21 and −23.45° on December 21), and solar time (when 
expressed as an angle, ha = 0° at solar noon) using Eq. 3.3. The width of the shade 
(wshade) is given by:
w w h shade = + tanθ
where w and h are the width and height of the structure (w is negligible, h = 3 m). 
The results are shown in Table 44.8.
44.18 Frequency of Days Suitable for Pesticide Applications
Calculate the frequency of days suitable for applying pesticides in your location. 
Assume that wind speed during the daytime can be calculated as
U N d U s
= avg
+
2
24 1
where Uavg is the average daily (24-h) wind speed and Ns is the daylength (hours).
The application of pesticides is not recommended on rainy days, when wind 
speed exceeds 2.5 m s−1
 or when air temperature is higher than 32–35 °C. We will 
consider as days not suitable for applications those that have rainfall and/or with 
daytime wind speed greater than 2.5  m  s−1
 and/or with maximum temperature 
exceeding 35  °C.  Calculations for our location (Belmez) were performed with 
Microsoft Excel. The frequency of days suitable for pesticide treatments for each 
month is shown in Table 44.9.

Intermediate variables used in the calculations are λ (latitude), δ (solar declination), ha (solar 
angle), and θ (zenith angle)
