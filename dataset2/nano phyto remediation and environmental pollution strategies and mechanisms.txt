Nano-phytoremediation and 
Environmental Pollution
The book discusses nano-phytoremediation: the use of nanotechnology in combination with 
phytoremediation to restore polluted environs. The potentiality of plants in association with 
nanomaterials to effectively remediate polluted areas is elaborated meritoriously in this book. New 
strategies are necessary because anthropogenic actions represent a serious threat to life on Earth. 
This book has given enough space for a discussion of innovative and efficient technologies to restore 
damaged environs primarily focused on nano-phytoremediation. The first part of the book is dedicated 
to exploring organic and inorganic pollution and the threats they pose to living forms. The second part 
explores the joint use of plants and nanomaterials and the nano-phytoremediation of water and soil 
ecosystems. The book offers readers extensive knowledge on nano-phytoremediation as a feasible 
strategy to clean environmental pollution. The key features of the book are as follows:
• Nano-phytoremediation strategies to remediate soil and water ecosystems.
• Special chapters dedicated to different kinds of pollutants and methods of phytoremediation.
• Strategies to evaluate the success of nano-phytoremediation strategies, cost-effectiveness, 
and nano informatics for safe nanotechnology.
The book can be used as a primary or supplementary text in undergraduate, graduate, and 
post-graduate courses such as biotechnology, biochemistry, and environmental engineering. It 
is an interesting edition for instructors, researchers, and scientists working on environmental 
management and pollution control.Nano-phytoremediation and

Foreword
The advancement of knowledge in different fields of expertise has made possible the development 
of elegant solutions to the problems that humanity faces and has drawn human beings’ attention to 
concepts necessary to a harmonic life on the Earth.
Therefore, diverse strategies to deal with environmental pollution, a consequence of human 
actions that seek development but ignore sustainability principles, are being proposed. Plants are an 
exciting tool in this sense as they promote the phytoremediation of contaminants. The nanotechnol￾ogy field is also a relevant source of these strategies involving the use of nanomaterials.
The book “Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution: Strategies and Mechanisms” 
includes 15 chapters to allow readers access to a comprehensive view of the theme.
The first chapter entitled “Environmental Pollution Caused by Organic Pollutants, Their 
Harmful Impacts, and Treatment through a Microbiological Approach” deals with the type of pol￾lution caused by organic contaminants, their harmful effects, and treatment with the help of dif￾ferent microbial species. Bioremediation with the help of indigenous microbial communities as a 
novel and effective solution for cleaning up the environment, specifically, organic pollutants, is also 
discussed in this chapter.
Authors from Morocco, China, and Iran have contributed Chapter 02, “Nanomaterial’s Interesting 
Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs.” The chapter focuses on the recent developments in 
nanomaterials and nanocomposites to remediate contaminated environs. Furthermore, it highlights 
the advantages and limitations of different nanomaterials in the cleanup of heavy metals, volatile 
organic compounds, and herbicides.
Chapter 03, written by authors from Brazil, discusses important classes of carbon-based nanoma￾terial and their derivatives for the remediation of environmental pollutants. The chapter addresses 
the main strategies using carbon-based nanomaterial to remediate soil, water, and air pollution.
Chapter 04, “Non-Carbon-Based Nanomaterials Used for Environmental Pollution Remediation,” 
is contributed by Indian scientists. They discuss at length the non-carbon nanoparticles in nano￾remediation. The physicochemical characteristics of these non-carbon nanoparticles to resolve 
environmental contaminants are the focus of this chapter.
Chapter 05, entitled “Green-Synthesis of Nanomaterials for Environmental Remediation,” was 
written by researchers from India. They concentrate on nanomaterials’ synthesis by using green 
techniques. Furthermore, the authors conclude that the green-synthesis of nanomaterials has 
emerged as an area that primarily considers environmental benefits.
Chapter 06, titled “Comparison between Traditional and Nanoremediation Technology with 
Special Reference to Soil and Heavy Metal Contamination,” is comprehensively presented to com￾pare traditional remediation technologies with nanotechnologies for dealing with a broad spec￾trum of environmental contaminants. A particular emphasis is put on heavy metal remediation 
techniques.
“Joint Use of Nanomaterials and Plants for the Remediation of Inorganic Pollutants” is the topic 
of Chapter 07 and was written by authors from Pakistan and Malaysia. This chapter explores the 
important strategies of phytoremediation assisted by nanotechnology to address inorganic pollut￾ants. The chapter centers on the biosynthesis of nanoparticles from plants to remove inorganic pol￾lutants from the environment.
Omics technology use for environmental remediation is the focus of Chapter 08. This chapter 
titled “Integration of Nano-Phytoremediation and Omics Technology for Sustainable Environmental 
Cleanup” explores the advances and challenges related to phytoremediation, particularly the essen￾tial potential of nanoparticles omics site-directed genome editing technology CRISPR/Cas9.
Authors from India write in Chapter 09, entitled “Water Nano-Phytoremediation,” to address nano￾phytoremediation strategies applied to polluted water. Current developments in nanotechnology to xiv Foreword
simplify the nano-phytoremediation of polluted water by using nanomaterials are examined in this 
chapter.
Researchers from Pakistan discuss in Chapter 10 “Nanotools-Coupled Phytoremediation: 
Auspicious Technology for the Detoxification of Contaminated Pedosphere Matrices.” They con￾centrate on nanotool-enabled phytoremediation in the detoxification of the pedosphere zone. This 
chapter specifically investigates the potential of phytoremediation in environmental cleanup, the 
interplay of different mechanisms in phytoremediation and nano-phytoremediation, and the chal￾lenges and prospects associated with the nano-phytoremediation carried out with different types of 
nanoparticles and plants.
Chapter 11 is entitled “Iron Nanoparticles for nano-phytoremediation” and is written by authors 
from China, India, Iran, and Morocco; it reviews the potential of iron-based nanomaterials as unique 
and promising alternatives to traditional environmental restoration techniques. Specifically, it con￾templates nano bioremediation using iron nanomaterial as an emerging environmentally friendly 
clean technology that requires further utilization.
Chapter 12, titled “Silver Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation: Recent Advancements 
and the Potential of Nano Silver Consolidated Phytoremediation in Ecospheric Decontamination,” 
reviews phytoremediation assisted by silver nanoparticles and its use as green nanotechnology. The 
authors from Pakistan appraise this nanomaterial as an important tool to restore polluted environs. 
This chapter comprehensively elaborates the role of Ag nanoparticles in a detoxifying environment 
in collaboration with different types of hyper-accumulator plants.
Chapter 13, entitled “Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation,” is written by an 
author from Morocco who reviews the magnetic nanoparticle-assisted phytoremediation of polluted 
ecosystems. The chapter summarizes the current progress in our perception of the role of magnetic 
nanoparticles for nano-phytoremediation processes in pollutant removal from different ecosystems.
Chapter 14, “Sustainability Aspects of Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation,” is writ￾ten by Indian authors who give special attention to the sustainability issues surrounding nanore￾mediation techniques and nanomaterials. They argue that the ecological risks posed by the use of 
nanoparticles need to be assessed and monitored. In addition, the need for innovative and advanced 
greener ways to synthesize nanoparticles is the central theme of this chapter.
In Chapter 15, the authors discuss some emerging methods for the treatment of wastewater that 
are easy to implement and environmentally feasible. Furthermore, they emphasize the utilization of 
advanced oxidation processes in the complete mineralization of organic contaminants.
The book unites authors worldwide to offer a multidisciplinary point-of-view on nanotechnol￾ogy and phytoremediation. Their capacity provides efficient strategies to remediate environmental 
pollution that are aligned with the idea of sustainable development. This book is unique and should 
be an idyllic source of scientific information to research scholars, faculty, and scientists globally.

Environmental Pollution 
Caused by Organic Pollutants, 
Their Harmful Impacts, 
and Treatment through a 
Microbiological Approach
Sneha Bhandari
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Environmental pollution is a significant challenge and a serious issue of concern throughout the 
world. When any physicochemical contaminant or pollutant causes a disturbance and alteration 
of the environment, the phenomenon is termed environmental pollution. Human activity and 
natural calamities are two significant factors that lead to pollution. Industrialization, urbaniza￾tion, deforestation, mining, excavation, and exploration have negatively influenced the environ￾ment and thus altered the ecological balance leading to pollution. This burden of environmental 
pollution is faced by both developed and developing nations, although developed nations have 
more awareness and strict guidelines and laws associated with environmental pollution. Despite 
worldwide awareness, the negative influence of environmental pollution can still be noticed 
because of long-term and continual impacts. Apart from the fundamental type of pollution 
related to air, water and soil, the world is also bearing the pollution associated with noise, radio￾activity, plastic, and light. Environmental pollution directly affects the health of living organ￾isms, not only humans but also non-human beings such as animals, plants, and others. It has 
been reported that environmental pollution results in a large number of diseases and premature 
deaths, and more than 9 million premature deaths have occurred because of air, soil, and water 
pollution. This death figure is three-fold more than the fatalities that occurred due to AIDS, 
tuberculosis, and malaria combined and is 15-fold greater than all wars and other types of vio￾lence that have occurred throughout the world. Moreover, soil and water pollution is a consider￾able crisis in the majority of regions of the world. This environmental pollution has led to several 
negative consequences such as vegetation loss (deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification) 
and soil fertility disruption, together with soil erosion and depletion, toxic acid rain, and species 
extinction (Bhandari and Nailwal 2020a).
Chemical pollutants can be fundamentally divided as organic and inorganic pollutants. Organic 
contaminants include polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, pesticides, azo dyes, polychlorinated 
biphenyls, chlorinated phenols, herbicides, fertilizers, and endocrine-destroying chemicals, 
whereas inorganic contaminants include various heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead. 
The recalcitrant, non-biodegradable nature of organic compounds has created an alarming situa￾tion, and their severity can be seen in the health and quality of living organisms. Industries such 
as textiles, pharmaceuticals, paper and pulp, chemical, sewage and water treatment plants, and 
petroleum and oil not only utilize these chemical compounds but also release them as industrial 
12 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
effluents. For instance, phthalates are used as plasticizers for toys and personal care products. 
Organic chemical compounds that follow four characteristics viz., persistence in the environment, 
capability of long-distance transport, bioaccumulation in the ecosystem, and potential of biological 
magnification, are termed persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These POPs pose serious health 
issues as they pass on from one living being to another from the food chain and food web, thus 
muddling the ecological balance. For example, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is one of 
the classic POPs that remain in the ecosystem for more than a decade, and it endangers not only 
humans but also other organisms. DDT and its related derivative compounds disturb the calcium 
metabolism in birds; thus, fragile eggshells are produced that are unable to hold the incubating 
bird, leading to the death of the developing embryos. The population of Brown Pelicans and Bald 
Eagles were greatly affected due to DDT. In humans, a higher percentage of DDT acts as mutagen 
and carcinogen and causes various symptoms and diseases such as seizures, neurotoxicity, trem￾ors, vomiting, and cancer.
POPs contribute considerably to the environmental pollution of air, water, and soil. Organic 
pollutants decrease the fertility of the soil and cause reduced agricultural productivity. Industrial 
wastewater as an effluent is extensively released in water bodies (either in freshwater or marine 
water) and deteriorates the water quality and habiting living organisms. Higher levels of organic 
pollutants in water cause hypoxia (a reduction of dissolved oxygen), which threatens the lives of 
water creatures. In industries, a combustion of toxic chemicals and release of noxious gases into the 
atmosphere disrupt the atmospheric gas system, resulting in air pollution. Long-term exposure to 
polluted air leads to severe respiratory-associated diseases and disorders.
To address harmful organic pollutants, various strategic methods have been proposed. These 
include both biological and non-biological approaches. As physicochemical techniques are dif￾ficult to manage, a biological method involving microorganisms that degrade organic contami￾nants has evolved and opened new paths in environmental cleaning. Microorganisms are present 
in every part of the world and colonize even in very intense environments such as in caves, deep 
oceans, cold Antarctic areas, hot volcanic areas, and hot springs. When habitats change, this also 
affects the growth, development, and nutrition behavior in microorganisms and alters the meta￾bolic activities within microbial communities (Bhandari and Nailwal 2020b). Microorganisms 
utilize energy sources according to the available nutrients present in their habitat. Therefore, in 
this chapter, we discuss the pollution caused by organic contaminants, their negative impacts on 
the health of living beings, and the microbiological approach for their treatment and removal from 
the environment.
1.2 ORGANIC POLLUTANTS
Organic chemical compounds are basically compounds that contain carbon-hydrogen bonding in 
their chemical structure. Organic compounds are in massive demand as manufacturing ingredients 
and are used in several industrial processes and applications, for instance, alcohols such as ethanol 
and isopropanol act as antiseptics and are utilized in the cosmetics industry and beverage industry. 
Organic compounds containing the carboxylic acid group are widely used in the pharmaceutical 
industry. Similarly, compounds such as toluene, benzene, naphthalene, carbon-tetrachloride, ben￾zoic acid, benzaldehyde, and many more are used widely in numerous industries. These compounds 
have various industrial applications, but many of them act as POPs (Figure 1.1) and cause environ￾mental pollution. Some of the major POPs such as chlordane, hexachlorobenzene, endrin, polychlo￾rinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltricholorethane (DDT), polychlorinated dibenzofurans, 
hexabromodiphenyl ether (hexaBDE), heptabromodiphenyl ether (heptaBDE), pentachlorobenzene 
(PeCB), lindane, tetrabromodiphenyl ether (tetraBDE), perfluorooctaesulfonic acid (PFOS), and 
endosulfans are being used as crucial manufacturing reactants in various industries, but these 
organic compounds act as pollutants, pose a severe threat to the environment, and are thus a topic 
of global concern.Environmental Pollution and Microbiological Treatment 3
FIGURE 1.1 Different types of organic pollutants.
1.3 SOIL POLLUTION
Soil pollution occurs when any contaminant present in the soil degrades its quality and disturbs the 
natural soil composition. Organic pollutants include petroleum hydrocarbons, solvents, azo dyes, and 
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo-pyrene and naphthalene; apart from these chemi￾cals, the extensive usage of chemical-based fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides are 
some factors that cause soil degradation. Heavy-duty vehicles transporting raw materials and other 
goods from place to place heightens the threat of oil spillage (which contains aromatic petroleum 
hydrocarbons and associated products), a common scenario on roads and land. It is difficult for these 
petroleum products to degrade from the soil, and extra endeavour is needed for their removal from 
the environment. The industrial discharge of both solid and liquid waste also consists of copious 
quantities of organic chemicals, which if untreated and directly discarded, causes both water and soil 
contamination. Agricultural wastes are composed of a higher concentration of chemical fertilizers, 
herbicides, and insecticides. Due to a lack of knowledge of fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, 
farmers use these chemicals in larger quantities than required in their fields. Not only does this result 
in the waste of these chemicals but also soil has to take up the burden of these chemicals. Moreover, 4 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
it has been reported that the continual usage of fertilizer and pesticides has reduced both the structure 
of the soil and its fertility. Because of a higher accumulation of toxic organic compounds, crop pro￾ductivity also decreases over time (Rahman and Zhang 2018). Furthermore, beneficial insects such 
as pollinators are highly affected by pesticide accumulation in the soil (Gullan and Cranston 2010). 
Fertilizers can help and support plant growth, but their excessive use causes only harm to the soil 
environment in terms of a disbalance in the nutrient and mineral biogeochemical cycles.
Direct exposure or contact with contaminated soil can act as a root cause of diseases both in 
humans and non-human species such as animals. Indirect effects may also arise when these organic 
pollutants leach and penetrate the groundwater, affecting its quality and making it unsafe for con￾sumption. In addition, soil pollution changes the metabolism of soil-associated microorganisms and 
small arthropods colonizing in the soil (Prashar and Shah 2016). Consequences can be easily seen 
in the primary food chain, which affects the food chain and food web of higher trophic levels such 
as consumers and predator species.
Although there are strict laws and regulation for discarding industrial waste, it seems that these 
regulations are not being followed well. Even if the rules are followed, these rules are of no use 
because environmental pollution has increased so much that it needs extensive efforts and strategies 
to first clean up the environment. Therefore, environmental cleanup needs to have an amalgamation 
of geology, chemistry, computer modelling and processing skills, hydrology, and most importantly, 
a thorough knowledge of the environmental sciences and associated fields.
1.4 WATER POLLUTION
Water contamination is a crucial and agitating issue throughout the globe. When any toxic com￾pounds or dangerous microorganisms pollute streams, rivers, lakes, canals, and oceans, deteriorat￾ing the water quality and making it unsafe for human consumption, the water is considered polluted. 
There are various sources that can contaminate and deteriorate water quality. Agricultural opera￾tions runoff (including animal excretory products, antibiotics, heavy metals, and salts), industrial 
effluents (from the pulp and paper industry, drug and pharmaceutical industry, mining and exca￾vation, fossil fuel burning, and petrochemical industry), suburban and rural waste, underground 
storage, piping, and sewer leakages, hazardous chemical waste, radioactive resources, and landfill 
leakage are some of the common causes of pollutants for water pollution. Common organic pol￾lutants of water are pharmaceutical drugs, aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon (PAH), microplastics, 
tannery waste, pigments, petroleum and other oil-based product spillage, and phthalates.
According to the survey of World Water Development 2017, barely 20% of produced wastewater 
is properly treated, while the remaining wastewater without any treatment is simply flushed into 
water bodies (Water 2016). The accumulation of organic pollutants has been increased tremendously 
in water bodies over recent years. Due to high toxicity, low water solubility, non-biodegradability, 
and a recalcitrant and semi-volatile nature, these organic contaminants have become a critical con￾cern for the world (Abdeen and Mohammad 2013; Chen et al. 2011). During the transportation of 
goods and petroleum-based products, leakage and spillage occur quite frequently from ships into 
the oceans. This spillage not only plays a considerable role in polluting ocean water but also has 
become a grave issue for aquatic life. This is because due to the accumulation and non-biodegrad￾able nature of organic pollutants, when water turbidity increases, it does not allow sunlight to pass 
through it, so the survival of photosynthetic organisms becomes difficult.
Consumption of contaminated water is a very basic reason for disease and disorder in humans. It 
has been reported that water contaminated by organic pollutants may lead to endocrine disruption, 
nephrotoxicity, cancer, hepatotoxicity, obesity, and reproductive system disorders (Nanseu-Njiki 
et al. 2010). Higher amounts of organic pollutants in water also lead to the death of aquatic animals 
due to asphyxiation and reduced fitness. Some marine organisms in which organic pollutants have 
been found are fishes (Moon et al. 2010; Wirnkor et al. 2020), Prena viridis (Bayen et al. 2004), 
barnacles (Karuppiah et al. 2004), and odontocete (Karups et al. 2004).Environmental Pollution and Microbiological Treatment 5
1.5 AIR POLLUTION
One of the most deadly types of pollution is air pollution, as living organisms share the common 
atmosphere so that any alteration in atmospheric gases that occurs in a particular region will also 
affect the gas composition of nearby places. Suspended solid and liquid particulates in the air are 
the main cause of air contamination. These suspended particles are gases, including nitrous oxide, 
carbon monoxide, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbon, biomolecules, and organic 
and inorganic particulate matter. Air pollution causes deleterious effects that involve diseases, dis￾orders, allergies, and even the death of living beings. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major 
air contaminants, which are generally classified as methane (MVOCs) and non-methane volatile 
organic compounds (NMVOCs). VOCs can be naturally synthesized by plants such as isoprenes, 
sesquiterpenes, methanol, and terpenes or they can be created from anthropogenic activities, includ￾ing solvents used for paints and inks and biofuel such as bioethanol. It is speculated that VOCs are 
more consistently found indoors than outdoors; in fact, many routine chemicals including paints, 
varnish, cosmetics, and disinfectants can release organic pollutants.
Methane is regarded as one of the most potent greenhouse gases that causes global warming. Some 
VOCs, such as limonene and styrene, when they react with ozone products or nitrogen oxide, form 
new oxidation products and secondary aerosols that possess sensory irritation properties (Nielsen et 
al. 2007). Some of the key symptoms related to the exposure of VOCs are nose and throat discomfort, 
skin allergies, nausea, vomiting, a reduction in serum cholinesterase concentration, fatigue, and diz￾ziness. Aromatic NMVOCs, such as toluene and benzene, are suspected to be carcinogens and are 
associated with leukaemia after long-term exposure. Chlorofluorocarbon, another important organic 
contaminant, is largely released from refrigerators and air conditioners into the stratosphere, where 
it comes into contact with other gases and damages the ozone layer. Earth is protected from harmful 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation that comes from the sun through the ozone, as large-scale air pollution has 
resulted in a thinning of the ozone layer in recent decades. Thinning of the ozone shield has allowed 
the penetration of UV radiation to the Earth’s surface, resulting in various health-related concerns 
such as skin cancer, skin pigmentation, and eye-associated disorders. Peroxyacetyl nitrate, an organic 
nitrogen compound, is a component of photochemical smog that acts as a secondary air pollutant 
and is a potent lung and eye irritant. It is also estimated that numerous POPs attach to particulates 
and contaminate the air. Semi-volatile POPs (such as VHCHs, DDT, etc.) can vaporize from the 
soil, water, and foliage directly into the ecosystem. As these chemicals are non-degradable, they are 
therefore transported through the wind to distant places (Bacaloni et al. 2011).
1.6 NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF ORGANIC POLLUTANTS
Organic contaminants, major environmental pollutants, not only disturb the ecological sustenance 
but also cause severe negative impacts on the health of living organisms such as humans and non￾human organisms, namely, microorganisms and plants. POPs also include many organo-metals, for 
example, methylmercury and lipophilic halogenated organics such as chlorinated pesticides, diox￾ins, perfluorinated compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated flame retardants. 
Some of these chemicals are byproducts of combustion and different industries.
1.6.1 Impacts on Humans
A variety of health ailments have been identified based on exposure to these POPs such as cancer, a 
reduction in cognitive and neurobehavioral functions, immune system repression, and disturbances 
in thyroid function, and some of them even have the potential to enhance chronic diseases including 
hypertension, diabetes, and heart-related disorders (Carpenter 2011). Chlordane, one of the pesticides 
used in agriculture as a termite and insect repellent, accumulates in the lipids of humans and animals. 
This compound is highly toxic and causes several health issues such as diabetes, testicular cancer, 6 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
prostate cancer, lymphoma, breast cancer, and obesity. Similarly, heptachlor, another organochlorine 
insecticide with no solubility in water, is a potent carcinogenic agent (Bandala et al. 2006). Oral expo￾sure and inhalation of this compound for long periods but in a lower concentration may lead to neu￾rological defects such as salivation, irritability, and negative blood effects (Ratola et al. 2003). Acute 
inhalation and exposure to this compound can also lead to gastrointestinal and nervous system issues.
Formaldehyde is a VOC that enters organisms upon inhalation and irritates the nose and lung 
linings; in addition, occupational asthma can be seen in some individuals. There are many other 
organic pollutants whose exposure is dangerous and sometimes lethal.

1.6.2 Impacts on Animals
Organic pollutants have greatly affected several animal species, particularly marine and aquatic life. 
Marine water and freshwater bodies are the potential dumping reservoirs of industrial effluents that 
contain massive quantities of chemical and radioactive waste. Industrial discharges heavily comprise 
hydrocarbons, biphenyl and associated products, pesticides, plasticizers, oil, pharmaceuticals, dyes, 
greases, fertilizers, dioxins, and furans, which are collectively known as organic contaminants. The 
treatment of industrial waste is a highly laborious and complex process and requires financial credit and 
support, skilled labour, and enough time to become effluent-free from toxic compounds. However, when 
this treatment is not performed properly and is directly discharged to water bodies, water pollution via
organic contaminants occurs. Organic pollutants cause various types of health issues in aquatic animals 
including neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, developmental issues, threats to larval and embryo survival, chro￾mosomal aberrations, and anatomical and morphological issues. Dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorooxanthrene) 
exposure led to declined spermatozoa, with a simultaneous elevation in spermatogonia and a reduction 
in the thickness of the germinal epithelium in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Gene expression for the develop￾ment of testis, spermatogenesis, hormone metabolism, steroidogenesis, and xenobiotic response was 
also changed. These genes are essential for the metabolism of lipids, cellular morphology, molecular 
transport, biochemistry of small molecules, and metabolism of vitamins and minerals. Overall, expo￾sure to Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin caused transgenerational infertility in Danio rerio (Baker et al. 2016). 
Similarly, runoff of Cyhalofop-butyl (herbicide) from paddy fields exhibited toxic effects in zebraf￾ish (Danio rerio). This herbicide elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and apoptosis 
near the heart area along with increased activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (Zhu et al. 2015). In the 
Canadian Arctic, the reproductive success of thick-billed murres and northern fulmars was greatly 
affected by dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as non-ortho PCBs (nPCBs), polychlo￾rinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) emission from indus￾tries (Braune and Mallory 2017). Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like 
polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) accumulated inside the livers of Caretta caretta and Chelonia 
mydas, thereby leading to a threat to their survival (Lambiase et al. 2021).
Negative and toxic effects of organic contaminants can be seen in all kinds of living organisms, 
but for simplicity, we include all non-human organisms such as birds, aquatic species, and other 
mammals in one group, that is, animals.

1.6.3 Impacts on Plants
Plants take up nutrients in the form of minerals directly from the soil; thus, altered soil composi￾tion in terms of minerals and other growth factors would directly lead to changes in plant growth. 
Organic pollutants not only hamper the normal physiological processes carried out by plants such as 
photosynthesis, seed germination, and transpiration but also interfere with the metabolic pathways 
occurring in plants, for instance, the biosynthetic pathways of primary and secondary metabolites. 
Accumulation of pollutants in soil alters the soil pH and solubilizes the toxic salts of metals such as 
aluminium. Similarly, exposure to peroxyacetylnitrate, a secondary pollutant, leads to necrosis and 
chlorosis in leaves. It also impedes other plant physiological processes such as photosynthesis, res￾piration, carbon dioxide fixation, photorespiration, NADP reduction, and the synthesis of cellulose, 
carbohydrates, proteins, and enzymes involved in the processes of respiration and photosynthesis 
(Gheorghe and Ion 2011).Environmental Pollution and Microbiological Treatment 11

Traces or sometimes whole antibiotics, if present in the industrial effluents of pharmaceutical indus￾tries, cause severe negative influences on plant growth. According to reports, at low concentrations, 
tetracyclin has shown hormetic effects that induce plant early development and seed germination, but 
chronic exposure led to the suppression of plant performance and activity (Xie et al. 2011). Chlorophyll 
biosynthesis was inhibited in Hordeum vulgare when it was exposed to a higher concentration of 
streptomycin (Yaronskaya et al. 2007). Antibiotics such as enrofloxacin and sulfadimethoxine notably 
decreased plant growth (Migliore et al. 2003; Migliore et al. 1996), whereas ciprofloxacin (Aristilde 
et al. 2010) led to a reduction of both plant growth and photosynthesis in various plant species. Similarly,

1.7 MICROBIOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR REMOVING 
ORGANIC POLLUTANTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT
Living organisms and the environment are massively affected by organic pollutants. Organic pol￾lution results when larger amounts of organic contaminants originate from sewage waste, domestic 
waste, industrial effluents, metallurgical procedures, vehicle emissions, fossil fuel emissions, and 
petroleum hydrocarbons spillage and accumulate in the soil, water, and air. Various organic com￾pounds have been characterized and categorized as POPs, which are persistent in nature, remain 
within living organisms for many years, and cause serious health issues. Several biological, chemi￾cal, and physical strategies have been formulated, designed, and utilized for removing these toxic 
organic contaminants. However, physical and chemical methods are quite tedious, are difficult 
to operate in rural regions, and require high-duty machinery, thereby increasing the cost of the 
treatment process, which results in a financial burden to industries and nations. Microbiological 
approaches involving different microbial species have captivated much attention and are becoming 
a popular strategy in the treatment of organic pollutants. Various microorganisms utilize organic 
pollutants as their energy source (if possible), and, thus, complex pollutants are degraded to simpler 
components with either low toxicity or no toxicity. If pollutants cannot be utilized as an energy 
source, then even microbial flora has the potential to degrade organic compounds via the ‘bioreme￾diation’ and ‘biotransformation’ processes.
Pseudomonas putida, oil-eating bacteria, is a famous example of a genetically engineered micro￾organism that has been designed to degrade the complex petroleum hydrocarbon spillage in oceans. 
A foreign plasmid consisting of genes essentially required for the degradation of hydrocarbon was 14 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
introduced in this bacterium. Wide varieties of hydrocarbon compounds including naphthalene, 
camphor, salicylate, and octane could be metabolized by Pseudomonas putida. In Ralstonia eutro￾pha CH34 (a heavy metal-tolerant bacterial strain), the PCB degrading genes of Achromobacter sp. 
LBSIC1, Ralstonia eutropha A5, and Achromobacter denitrificans were introduced for metaboliz￾ing and degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (Joutey et al. 2013).
Apart from bacteria, algae, fungi, and yeast species are also involved in the ‘bioremediation’ 
process. Metabolic and enzymatic processes of microbial communities can biotransform these toxic 
organic compounds. The process of biotransformation is performed through two methods: growth 
and co-metabolism. In growth, complete degradation of organic contaminant takes place, as the 
organic compound is itself used as an individual source of carbon and energy by the microorgan￾ism. However, in the case of co-metabolism, apart from the organic pollutant, microbes use another 
growth substrate as a carbon and energy source, so a partial degradation of the organic compound 
occurs (Fritsche and Hofrichter 2000). The efficiency of the microbes in metabolizing organic 
contaminants depends upon various factors, for instance, the chemical nature and quantity of the 
pollutants, their availability to the microorganisms, and the physicochemical features of the envi￾ronment (El Fantroussi and Agathos 2005). The microorganism involved in the process basically 
has to deal with biotic and environmental factors. The metabolic activity performed by the microbes 
is known as the biotic factor that is itself affected by the inhibition of elements of microbial enzymes 
and predation by other microbes such as bacteriophage and protozoa. Furthermore, a sufficient 
amount of nutrients and factors affecting enzyme action, for example, optimum oxygen, pH, and 
temperature, are equally important for organic pollutants to degrade microbes. Environmental fac￾tors including soil type and differences in the porosity of saturated and unsaturated regions of the 
aquifer matrix may impact the movement of the contaminants to the groundwater. In soil saturated 
with more water and in fine-grained sediments, the potential of the matrix to transmit gases such as 
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane is lowered. Thus, these factors can influence the type and rate 
of biodegradation occurring at the site.
Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which is extremely important and extensively utilized in sulphon￾amide antibiotics, is becoming an issue as an environmental pollutant due to its recalcitrant nature. 
By adopting a variety of microbial communities, the degradation of SMX has become possible. 
Bacterial species including Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aerugi￾nosa, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Pycnoporus sanguineus metabolize SMX when provided with an 
additional carbon source in the culture medium. Some other bacteria such as Acinetobacter sp. 
and Microbacterium sp. can totally metabolize the SMX, whereas species such as Achromobacter 
denitrificans strain PR1 and Rhodococcus equi require an additional carbon source that signifi￾cantly enhances the rate of SMX degradation (Reis et al. 2014; Nguyen et al. 2017). Fungal spe￾cies, namely, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus pulmonarius, and Tramete can also degrade SMX 
(de Araujo et al. 2017). Similarly, oleophilic microorganisms are employed for ‘bioremediation’ 
at oil spillage sites. Microbes such as Trichoderma harzianum, Cunninghamella elegans, and 
Aspergillus niger can metabolize petroleum hydrocarbon products, that is, naphthalene, phenan￾threne, and n-haxadecane, respectively (Mollea et al. 2005; Romero et al. 1998; Volke-Sepulveda 
et al. 2003).
Bacterial species such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, and Agrobacterium radiobacter were isolated from the PCB-contaminated sediments 
from the Strážsky canal and the Zemplínska šírava water reservoir. The bphA1 gene reported in 
the bacterial species encoded the enzyme biphenyldioxygenase, which catalyzed the first reaction 
in PCB degradation (Dercová et al. 2008). Similarly, bacterial strains Achromobacter sp. NP03, 
Ochrobactrum sp. NP04, Lysinibacillus sp. NP05, and Pseudomonas sp. NP06 were identified 
from the sediment samples of the Brisbane River, and Coombabah Lake, Gold Coast and a soil 
sample from the Brisbane City area, Australia, contaminated with PCB. These strains were able 
to degrade PCB, with Lysinibacillus sp. NP05 exhibiting the highest efficiency among all other 
microbial species (Pathiraja et al. 2019).Environmental Pollution and Microbiological Treatment 15
It was reported that Streptomyces alanosinicus, Streptoverticillium album, Nocardia far￾cinia, Streptomyces atratus, Nocardia vaccini, Nocardia amarae, and Micromonospora chalcea
can efficiently grow and metabolize pesticides (Jayabarath et al. 2010). Atrazine was success￾fully degraded by white-rot fungi (Elgueta et al. 2016) and green microalgae Chlamydomonas 
mexicana (Kabra et al. 2014), and in fact, the latter exhibited a degradation rate of 14–36%. 
Species of genera Pseudomonas can effectively degrade pesticides such as endosulfan hexachlo￾rocyclohexane, aldrin, parathion (Verma et al. 2014; Upadhyay and Dutt 2017), and many more; 
similarly, Bacillus sp. are efficient at degrading organic pollutants, for example, chlorpyrifos, 
dieldrin, monocrotophos, DDT, and PAH (Verma et al. 2014). Likewise, small green algae can 
degrade phorate and parathion (Tang et al. 2018), whereas some genera of diatoms can metabolize 
patoran and DDT (Shehata et al. 1997). Pyridine, an important organic compound used in sev￾eral applications such as paints, medicine, dyes, insecticides, and herbicides, has been reported 
to be effectively degraded by Paracoccus sp. NJUST30 with the production of major interme￾diates including piperidin-2-ol, 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-pyridine-3-one, 4-formylamino-butyric acid, 
2-carbonyl-succinic acid, and dihydropyridine alcohol or (1,2-dihydro-pyridin-2-ol) (Wang et al. 
2018c).
A moderate thermophile Paenibacillus napthalenovorans strain 4B1 discovered from the 
dioxin-contaminated soil in Vietnam was capable of degrading dibenzofuran (DF), taking it as an 
exclusive source of carbon and energy. The rate of degradation was comparatively higher than the 
reference Paenibacillus strain YK5, which proved that the Paenibacillus napthalenovorans strain 
4B1 produced a dbf gene cluster (dbfA1A2BC) (by encoding the alpha subunit of DF dioxygenase 
enzyme) and this expression level was four times higher than the one from reference strain (Thi 
et al. 2019).
1.8 INVOLVEMENT OF GENES AND ENZYMES IN 
THE ‘BIOREMEDIATION PROCESS’
Microorganisms can utilize organic compounds as their energy and carbon source and via dif￾ferent metabolic pathways, degrade these complex compounds into simpler forms. To achieve 
this challenge of biodegradation, various microbial genes are involved in this process. In simpler 
terms, genes encode enzymes that help in the catalysis and metabolism of these toxic organic 
compounds. The large group of dioxins and their derived compounds are chiefly present in the 
industrial effluents as POPs. Research shows that various microbial species have the potential to 
degrade and metabolize dioxins and related compounds. For example, Burkholderia cenocapacia
869T2 (an endophytic bacterium) has been reported to be effective in degrading the very toxic 
dioxin compounds 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorooxanthrene by utilizing gene encoding l-2-haloacid deha￾logenase (2-HAD) in the dioxin dehalogenation process (Nguyen et al. 2021). Bacterial species 
such as Cupriavidus necator JMP134 and Pseudomonas strains remove the side chain of 2, 4-D by 
α-ketoglutarate-dependent 2,4-D dioxygenase (tfdA) and form 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and 
use 2,4-DCP hydroxylase (tfdB) hydroxylate 2,4-DCP to form dichlorocatechol. Chlorocatechol 
1,2-dioxygenase (tfdC) is involved in the ortho or meta cleavage of dichlorocatechol by forming 
2,4-dichloro-cis,cis-muconate, which, in turn, is cleaved by chloromuconate cycloisomerase (tfdD) 
to form 2-chlorodienelactone. Chlorodienelactone hydrolase (tfdE) converts 2-chlorodienelactone 
to 2-chloromaleylacetate, and ultimately, the catalysis of 2-chloromaleylacetate to 3-oxoadepate via 
maleylacetate is performed by chloromaleylacetate reductase and maleylacetate reductase (tfdF), 
respectively. The final products are thus involved in the Kreb cycle within the microbes (Kumar 
et al. 2016). β-propeller phytase-like sequences (BPP-like sequences) are found in bacterial species 
colonizing in land, water, and plants and are actively involved in the degradation of dioxins and 
related compounds. Sphingomonas wittichii RW-1 exhibits the putative phytase gene (phySw) that 
encodes the novel enzyme β-propeller phytases to degrade polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and 
dibenzofurans (Sanangelantoni et al. 2018).16 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution

Paracetamol is extensively employed as an antipyretic and analgesic drug but is a potential 
organic contaminant. Bacterial genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Sphingomonas, and Pseudomonas
can metabolize paracetamol. Bacterial strain Pseudomonas moorei KB4 among all isolated bacte￾ria was reported to be the highest degrader of paracetamol. Deaminase, acyl amidohydrolase, and 
hydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenase were found to be the major enzymes associated with the degradation 
of paracetamol by Pseudomonas moorei KB4 (Żur et al. 2018). The enzyme 2-hydroxy-6-oxo￾6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase participates in the aromatic and biphenyl compound break￾down. Members of this enzyme family participate in the hydrolysis of C-C bonding in breaking 
down the pathway of biphenyls (Horsman et al. 2006). For metabolizing naphthalene sulphonates 
and anthracene, enzyme 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate isomerase has been identified from 
Pseudomonas testosteroni A3 and Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1 (Kuhm et al. 1993; Kim et al. 
1997).
Aromatic amines are a crucial ingredient of dyes, polymers, and other industrially derived prod￾ucts. Aromatic amines enter the soil ecosystem due to the usage of pesticides for the control of insects 
and pests in soybean, corn, and other crops. Enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase 
is actively involved in the degradation of aromatic ester 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (an intermediate Environmental Pollution and Microbiological Treatment 19

LadA gene encoding a novel alkane monooxygenase enzyme was reported in the thermophilic 
strain NG80–2 of Geobacillus thermodenitrificans and can catalyze the first reaction for the degra￾dation pathway of n-alkanes (Feng et al. 2007). The expression of the alkB gene was induced when 
different species of Geobacillus (G. thermoleovorans strain 27, Geobacillus caldoxylosilyticus 17, 
Geobacillus pallidus 2, Geobacillus toebii 1, and Geobacillus sp. 3) were used for the degradation 
of n-hexadecane (Marchant et al. 2006). It was later determined that three strains, G. toebii B-1024, 
Geobacillus sp. 1017, and Aeribacillus pallidus 8m3, with the potential of degrading C10–C30 
n-alkanes, showed elevated expression of alkB and ladA gene encoding the enzymes rubredoxin￾dependent alkane monooxygenase and flavin-dependent alkane monooxygenase, respectively. The 
alkB gene was expressed in all three strains, whereas the expression of the ladA gene was limited 
to G. toebiiB-1024 and Geobacillussp. 1017 (Tourova et al. 2016). Similarly, a thermophilic bacte￾rial strain Sulfolobus solfataricusP2 identified from a volcanic site, when sequenced, revealed the 
presence of genes encoding enzymes by participating in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (MAH) 
degradation, including mono- and dioxygenases (Chae et al. 2007).
1.9 CONCLUSION
Due to globalization and high-speed industrialization, the world has evolved a great deal, and some 
have become comfortable with a gracious lifestyle. However, because of industrial development and 
other human activities, the ecological balance has been disturbed by the continuous occurrence of 
environmental pollution. Organic pollutants are one of the major contaminates that pollutes the envi￾ronment including the soil, water, and air. POPs due to their recalcitrant and toxic nature cause severe 
health issues in both humans and other animals. Organic pollutants are also toxic to the physiologi￾cal processes of plants. These pollutants are mutagenic, carcinogenic, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, and 
endocrine-disrupting for both humans and other animals. In the case of plants, these pollutants affect 
the photosynthetic and transpiration rates, along with stomatal conductance and the biosynthetic 
and metabolic pathways. Various strategies have been applied for removing these noxious chemicals 
from the environment, but the problem with these techniques is their high cost. Moreover, physical 
and chemical processes to remove organic pollutants cannot be applied to remote and rural areas. 
Therefore, in the past few decades, scientists have been applying microbiological and biotechnological 
techniques to remove noxious chemicals. The biological method involving microorganisms and genet￾ically modified microbes is one of the safest and easiest approaches with less financial burden than 
conventional methods. Microbes are actively involved in various environmental cleaning processes 
such as ‘bioremediation’, ‘bioaugmentation’, ‘bioventing’, ‘biotransformation’, ‘mineralization’, and 
‘composting’. Bacteria and fungus are the most common species involved in the process of biodegrad￾ing complex organic pollutants. These microbial groups utilize organic contaminants as their energy 
and carbon sources and, thus, by different metabolic pathways, convert them into simpler compounds 
that are either less or not as toxic. The breakdown of organic contaminants through ‘bioremediation’ 
is an eco-friendly strategy that can be easily employed at contaminated sites. The large microbial 
diversity offers considerable potential in the biotransformation of toxic organic compounds to simpler 
compounds with less or no toxicity. The degradation and metabolic pathways of different organic pol￾lutants in various microbial communities are still unknown. By adopting a metagenomics approach, 
a molecular basis for the degradation pathways of organic compounds could be achieved. In fact, the 
‘bioremediation’ process could be made more efficient if certain constraints such as the bioavailability 
of organic compounds in the environment, functional capability within a limited range of physical and 
chemical conditions, and deactivation of enzymes associated with the bioremediation process at high 
threshold concentrations of recalcitrant compounds were addressed in better ways.24 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution

Nanomaterial’s Interesting 
Characteristics to Remediate 
Polluted Environs

2.1 INTRODUCTION
Although various studies have underlined the promising applications of nanotechnology in many 
fields, concerns about their use for the remediation of environmental compartments have not been 
resolved (Macoubrie 2006). Similarly, although many studies have indeed proven nanotechnol￾ogy’s efficiency in a laboratory environment, more studies are still needed to fully determine how 
nanotechnology can have a significant impact on the remediation of environmental contaminants in 
practical situations (for example, the effects of pollution in industrial processes and water, soil and 
air restoration) (Zhang et al. 2021). Similarly, although the mechanisms for applying different nano￾technologies are well known, the treatment of these materials after they are used for contaminant 
neutralization or elimination has not been fully studied (Zhou et al. 2020). Even though some of these 
materials are known to be recyclable, it seems that their efficiency decreases at some point, which 
ultimately limits their use. As a result, it is critical to conduct research to determine what happens 
to these materials after they repair and are released into the environment to avoid the risk of them 
becoming environmental threats. To access all of the possibilities of nano(scale)materials (NMs) in 
environmental applications, these challenges must be overcome (Roco, Mirkin, and Hersam 2011). 
Nanotechnology has a wide range of strategies to address environmental pollution. Nanotechnology 
has received a great deal of attention over recent decades due to their high physical characteristics 
(Lee, Park, and Lee 2020). NMs have increased reactivity because of their higher surface area-to￾volume ratio and are therefore more effective than larger materials of the same type. NMs can also 
be functionalized or associated with other functional groups to target specific molecular contami￾nation for effective repair because of their unique surface chemistry (Zhang, Mou, and Jiang 2020). 
In addition, deliberate changes to NMs’ physical properties (such as the size, morphology, porosity, 
and chemical composition) can confer additional benefits. These characteristics modify the effi￾cacy of the material for environmental cleanup (Manzano and Vallet‐Regí 2020). Compared with 
traditional methods to solve environmental pollution, the abundant surface modification chemistry 
and adjustable physical parameters of NMs provide obvious advantages (Khine and Stenzel 2020). 
Through expansion, the development of hybrid or composite materials by combining different mate￾rials with desired characteristics may be more effective, selective and certain than using a single 
nanoplatform. For example, when compared to using nanoparticles (NPs) alone, grafting NPs to the 
frame can improve the stability of the material. To a certain extent, the use of specific chemicals 
that can target certain pollutants to functionalize materials can improve the selectivity and efficacy 
of the materials. The use of NMs for environmental remediation is discussed in this chapter (Guerra 
et al. 2018). In the field of environmental remediation, NMs can efficiently eliminate biological 
and other pollutants. Detecting and removing contaminated gases (SO2, CO, NOx, etc.), chemicals 
(heavy metals, etc.), organic pollutants (aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) and certain biological 
238 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
compounds, nanoparticles, tubes, metal wires, fibres, and other composite materials with polymers 
are among the many shapes/forms of NM activity, and they act as adsorbents and catalysts (Khin 
et al. 2012). NMs outperform other conventional technologies in terms of remediation due to their 
surface area-to-volume ratio and associated high reactivity. This chapter focuses on the develop￾ment of new NMs and methods for the treatment of toxic metal ions, organic and inorganic sol￾utes, radionuclides, bacteria and viruses that pollute consumption and industrial wastewater (Wang 
et al. 2019). Furthermore, the most recent developments in the pollutant treatment and monitoring 
of polymer nanocomposites are debated. Additionally, imminent research trends and prospects are 
briefly discussed, because engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) have been designed for industrial and 
human commodities, by-products of waste and chemical industrial reactions are common, and inci￾dental nanoparticles can also be found in the environment (Qu et al. 2013).
Nanotechnology is currently being used to remediate contaminated soil, and it has great prom￾ise in terms of improving the performance of traditional remediation methods. When nanotech￾nology is released into the ecosystem, however, it causes environmental issues that affect human 
and environmental health. The goal of this chapter is to highlight the benefits and risks of using 
nanotechnology to remediate contaminated soil oil (Madhura et al. 2019). Soil nanoremediation has 
been found to have not only some benefits but also some drawbacks in terms of the final disposal of 
nanoparticles, NMs, or nanodevices (Wu et al. 2019). The most recent applications of these carbon 
NMs have been linked to heavy metal treatment in polluted water and environmental remediation. 
The use of carbon NMs (fullerene carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide and activated car￾bon) for environmental and special decontamination of heavy metals from pollutants is discussed 
(Zou et al. 2016). Heavy metal-polluted water has been successfully purified using carbon NMs. 
The reason for their widespread use is due to their intriguing properties, such as their high surface 
area, ease of recycling, and ease of adsorption, as inorganic acid solutions and regenerated materials 
can be recycled while still retaining adsorption capacity (Guerra et al. 2018). In addition to these 
characteristics, carbon NMs can also be easily manufactured in conjunction with other NMs and 
easily adapted to form a multifunctional nanoadsorbent material. Moreover, the biocompatibility 
of carbon-based materials with organisms and the environment is extremely high (Wu et al. 2019). 
Factors such as the pH, interaction time and adsorbent category have a significant impact on metal 
ion adsorption. According to this review, carbon NMs have excellent physical and chemical proper￾ties and a high potential for environmental remediation (Abbas et al. 2016). Here, structures up to 
1 μm will be referred to as NMs; NPs belong to this group of materials and present size most com￾monly in the range of 1 to 100 nm (Buzea, Pacheco, and Robbie 2007).
2.2 ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
The wide distribution of pollutants in the air, water and soil provides us with a novel technology 
that can detect, screen and remove pollutants irrespective of the medium. As a result, researchers 
and environmentalists have turned their attention to nanotechnology, which is part of an emerging 
field of purification with broad prospects for improving the quality of the existing environment. 
Nanotechnology includes NPs with a size range of 1–100 nm and has several unique features that 
are lacking in batch forms. The most important features are the increased surface area and the 
high reactivity of the nanoparticles, which are critical to the decontamination process. Therefore, 
nanoparticles can be effectively exploited to prevent and detect pollution and to decontaminate the 
pollutant screen (Yunus et al. 2012). In the following section, the role of NPs in the decontamination 
of air, water and soil is detailed.
2.2.1 NP Application for the Decontamination of Air
Air pollution is currently a critical concern as it is increasing every day, especially in cities all over 
the world. The major pollutants of air are chloroflurocarbons (CFCs), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur Nanomaterial’s Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs 39
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, toxic metal ions (e.g., arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cadmium 
(Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), etc.), hydrocarbons and organic compounds (e.g., dioxins). Most 
of these pollutants are released into the air through various anthropogenic activities including the 
combustion of fossil fuel, industrial activities, and smelting (Yunus et al. 2012). Nanotechnology 
can be effectively employed to clean polluted air through a sustainable approach. NP-like carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs) and gold NPs have been the most exploited NPs in recent years for the successful 
remediation of polluted air (Yunus et al. 2012).
For instance, CNTs are found to be exceptionally beneficial for the removal of dioxin, CO2 and 
NO from polluted air as suggested by Long and Yang (2001). This increased activity is due to the 
curved surface of CNTs that provides a stronger force of interaction between the pollutant and the 
NP (Bhushan 2017). In addition to CNTs, gold NPs, especially manganese oxide coated with gold 
nanoparticles, are excellent absorbers for volatile molecules since they are highly porous in nature 
and have a large surface area. Due to the presence of free radicals on the surface, the adsorbed 
molecules are effectively degraded, and gold NPs play an important part in the formation of free 
radicals apart from the NPs stated earlier, such as zeolite, silica-based NPs and activated carbon, 
which are also employed in the successful remediation of air pollutants (Yunus et al. 2012).
2.2.2 NP Application for the Decontamination of Soil
Decontamination and detoxification (phytoremediation) of pollutants in the soil with plants is a 
very mature strategy that has been applied since ancient times. However, in recent years, following 
the development of nanotechnology, the use of NPs in the phytoremediation process is also robust 
and has been widely accepted because of its high repair efficiency. Several NPs are employed for 
nano-phytoremediation, and most of them are excellent for removing/degrading the pollutant in situ. 
Some of them include CNTs, fullerenes, metallic NPs, iron NPs, grapheme oxide NPs and silver and 
gold NPs (Baragaño et al. 2020).
Quantum dots (QDs) have been shown to bind metals such as copper (Cu) and Pb in soil, which 
reduces their availability, and the cell walls provide additional protection by preventing the entry 
of these molecules (Worms et al. 2012). In addition, zero-valent iron (ZVI)-treated Panicum maxi￾mum showed a higher potential for the breakdown of Trinitrotoluene (TNT). It is therefore used 
for the remediation of TNT from contaminated soil; similarly, treatment with nano zero-valent 
iron (NZVI) in Panicum maximum and Helianthus annuus detoxifies TNT contaminants in soil. 
Moreover, plants treated with NZVI showed significantly higher polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) 
detoxification efficiency than untreated plants (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2012). Recently, Baragaño et 
al. (2020) described that two NPs, namely, graphene oxide nanoparticles (nGOx) and NZVI, are 
efficient in the decontamination of toxic metal ions in soil, which may include As, Pb, Zn, Cd and 
Cu. These types of nano-phytoaccumulation may be used to improve the texture of degraded soil.
2.2.3 NP Application for the Decontamination of Water
The pollution of water bodies must be considered a serious issue since the pollutants from water 
bodies may easily enter the food chain through bio magnification. The major source of pollutants in 
water bodies are oil spillage, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and waste disposal (Krantzberg et al. 
2010). A number of NPs are shown to be effective for the successful recovery of contaminated water 
including the NPs of ZVI, biopolymers, single-enzyme NPs, CNTs, zeolite, and self-assembled 
monolayers on mesoporous supports (Sharma et al. 2009).
ZVI is found to have reactivity towards a range of pollutants including NO3
−, Cu, Cr, and chlori￾nated hydrocarbons (Miehr et al. 2004). Another widely used NP for water purification is TiO2 NP 
mainly because of its low toxicity, high photoconductivity and photostability; it is also cost effective 
(Yunus et al. 2012). Generally, the antimicrobial properties of silver NP are well known, and it is 
commonly used to remove microbes such as bacteria from contaminated water. Polyacrylonitrile 40 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
(PAN) nanofibre and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with silver NP have the potential to reduce the micro￾bial level up to 91% without leaching the silver particles into the water, thus safeguarding the quality 
of drinking water (Du Plessis 2011). Accordingly, antimicrobial nanotechnology is now emerging 
as a promising branch of nanotechnology to decontaminate and thereby ensuring the quality of 
water bodies. In addition to silver NP, a number of NP-like TiO2, zinc oxide (ZnO), fullerol, CNTs, 
chitosan and peptides are also efficient in their antimicrobial activity and can act as potential agents 
of remediation (Li et al. 2008)(Figure 2.1).
2.3 THE PROSPECTS OF BIOSYNTHETIC NMS TO REPAIR ORGANIC 
AND INORGANIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS
Nanotechnology involves synthesis and extremely small NMs used in the fields of chemistry, biol￾ogy, physics, materials science and engineering. These uniquely structured NMs have different 
chemical, physical, electrical and mechanical properties. NMs have structures up to 1 μm (1000 
nm), and particles in the sub-micron range are called NPs (Buzea, Pacheco, and Robbie 2007), 
which usually range from 1 to 100 nm. Such nanoscale materials are potentially beneficial for 
economic and ecological applications. As NMs have a wide variety of semiconductors, examples of 
industrial applications include storage, display, optical and photonic technologies, energy and bio￾technology and health care, and they produce the maximum commodities, which are NMs (Meena 
et al. 2014). They are also used to store, produce and convert electricity, improve farm efficiency, 
treat and remedy water, and diagnose and detect systems for diseases; they are used in medicines, 
food handling and storage systems, air pollution and remediation, buildings and medical systems 
and as a vector for the control of pests (Murty et al. 2013).
However, nanotechnology increasingly employs various techniques to aid in the detection of pol￾lution, for example, fluorescence, electrochemical or optical detection, pollution prevention, and the 
long-term handling and cleaning of hazardous waste sites, as time and tools allow (Karn, Kuiken, 
and Otto 2009, Ghasemzadeh et al. 2014). These technologies are proving to be viable alternatives 
to existing in-situ organic and inorganic pollution remediation methods. The impact of nanotechnol￾ogy is the focus of current research, which emphasizes preventing pollution and removing various 
contaminated land, sediments, solid waste and water and air pollutants (Lowry 2007). NM-based 
FIGURE 2.1 Nanoparticle application in air, soil, and water remediation in the environment.Nanomaterial’s Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs 41
separation membranes have also been used to produce drinking water as part of a low-energy power 
supply process (Gehrke, Geiser, and Somborn-Schulz 2015).
The plan for the use of nanotechnology-mediated multi-functional processes is to provide high￾performance and reasonable wastewater action solutions without relying on large-scale infra￾structure (Qu, Alvarez, and Li 2013). Wastewater treatment based on nanotechnologies not only 
overcomes the major drawbacks of current treatment technologies and adds new treatment capa￾bilities but also expands the supply of non-traditional water sources and therefore provides a cost￾effective, safe and green method for various applications (Drexler and Minsky 1990; Ball 1996; 
Ando et al. 2012; Mehndiratta et al. 2013). The reduction of the source, the degradation of pollutants 
and the sensing of pollutants are the three steps in pollution control. Through different techniques, 
such as surface adsorption and surface interaction of metal ions with ohydroxy groups through 
permeable reactive barriers, several chemically synthesized NMs/NPs can remedy toxic metals and 
organic pollutants (Tungittiplakorn, Cohen, and Lion 2005; Cundy, Hopkinson, and Whitby 2008; 
Liu et al. 2011; Kharisov et al. 2012; Torabian et al. 2014). All the possible uses of biosynthetic 
NMs/NPs for sustainable environmental applications are still unknown; however, the prospects for 
biosynthetic NMs and their mechanisms to remediate organic and inorganic environmental pollut￾ants are discussed in this chapter.
2.3.1 Biosensing Mechanisms and the Remediation of Environmental Contaminants
In the past ten years, NMs based on environmental protection technology have been continuously 
developed for environmental restoration. Today, a variety of microorganisms has synthesized 
many inorganic and organic NMs/NPs with excellent chemical and physical properties, and they 
have been used in various applications in innovative and environmentally friendly technologies 
(Figure 2.2). Among several possible mechanisms, NMs/NPs follow three main methods, namely, 
adsorption, conversion and catalysis, to remedy environmental pollutants. Biological inorganic and 
organic NMs/NPs have so far reduced toxic metal and organic compound absorption, processing, 
photocatalysis, and catalytic reduction. The different mechanisms of biosynthetic NMs for the envi￾ronmental remediation of organic and inorganic pollutants are highlighted here.

2.3.1.1 Adsorption
The combination of pollutants on the surface of the adsorbent is called adsorption. This process is 
mediated by the interaction of exothermic surfaces and ions. Enthalpy is the amount of heat gen￾erated by the adsorbent during the adsorption of one mole of the adsorbate. Enthalpy adsorption 
is continually specified as a negative value because the liberty of movement of the adsorbate is 
restricted during the adsorption process, which leads to a decrease in entropy.
Adsorption occurs spontaneously under constant temperature and pressure, further reducing 
Gibbs free energy (Ruthven 1984). A variety of adsorption methods tend to effectively eliminate 
environmental pollutants. Due to their environmental protection and cost-effective characteristics, 
there is great demand for biologically produced nanoscale adsorbents to remove organic and inor￾ganic pollutants (Rizwan et al. 2014). Many organisms are used as factories to produce nanoscale 
adsorbents from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. All of them have components that can be used currently 
to make nanoscale adsorbents, and many biosynthetic nano-sorbents are employed to capture pol￾lutants from contaminated sites.
2.3.1.2 Nanoparticles of Metal/Metal Oxide (Me/MeONPs)
Heavy metal adsorbents are nanoparticles of metal/metal oxide (Me/MeONP). Recent research has 
shown that magnetic nanostructures can also be used to remove organic pollutants, and magnetic 
NPs are crucial in contemporary Me/MeONPs because they can treat vast quantities of wastewater 
while still allowing for rapid magnetic separation (Hu, Wang, and Pan 2010). Many studies have 
shown that among other low-cost adsorbents, NP iron oxide has the highest adsorption capacity. A 
study executed by Lunge, Singh, and Sinha (2014) found that in Fe3O4 NPs in the range of 188.69 
and 153.8 mg g-1, As (III) has a maximum capacity for adsorption, and As (v) ions have been deter￾mined to be much higher than those in conventional methods. This shows that the rapid removal and 
recovery of metal ions from wastewater discharge through a biologically produced Fe3O4 nano￾sorbent tea extract is actually economical.
2.3.2 Bimetallic Nanoparticles (BNPs)
Biological systems such as bacteria, yeast at room temperature, fungi and plants biologically pro￾duce BNPs inside or outside the cell, which provides a biocompatible method for the synthesis of 
NMs. Compared with uncoated iron metal, the reactivity of nanoscale iron particles enhances the 
deposition of discontinuous precious metal layers, thereby increasing the reaction speed (Chang, 
Lian, and Zhu 2011). Accordingly, in the field of remediation, the characteristics of BNPs make 
them useful in removing environmental pollutants. The use of biosynthetic BNPs is a low-cost, 
advanced green method to increase the rate of decontamination of organic and inorganic pollutants 
in the environment. Spirulina Platensis, a single-cell protein, has been used to synthesize bimetallic 
Au/Ag NPs (Chang, Lian, and Zhu 2011). Plants have also been studied as non-toxic and environ￾mentally friendly reducing agents for metal ions in the synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles, which 
is different from the reduction of chemicals. Some reports on BNP biosynthesis have been published 
that indicate that this process has been used to produce materials capable of removing environmen￾tal pollutants (Litter et al. 2014). However, further research is needed in this field concerning green 
BNP synthesis being used to eliminate environmental pollutants.
2.3.3 Modified Nanoparticles
Bimetallic NPs and Me/MeONP have been synthesized for environmental remediation in recent 
years. These BNPs and Me/MeONP usually have high reactivity, surface energy and magnetism, 
which makes it easy to oxidize the air dissolved in water. In addition, due to their high concen￾tration in wastewater, they may compete with other interference molecules at the adsorption site. 44 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
This limits the effectiveness of the nano-adsorbent. To prevent NM aggregation, the surface of 
NMs must be modified to make it stable in the system for a longer period of time, as organic and 
inorganic materials (e.g., polymers, biomolecules, silica and metals) may change the surface of 
NMs/NPs. Organic molecules (including small organic molecules, i.e., surfactants, polymers and 
biomolecules) and inorganic layer coatings are examples of this (such as silica, metal or non-metal 
elements, metal oxides or metals). The main stability strategy of the sulfide is as follows. The 
mechanism of the surface-modified NM/NP adsorption of wastewater pollutants includes surface 
bonding, selective magnetic adsorption, electrostatic interaction and modified ligand bonding. The 
biosynthesis of Me/MeONPs was noted by Li et al. (2011) and Jeevanandam, Chan, and Danquah 
(2016). Nonetheless, the modification of these NMs/NPs has been investigated by employing biode￾gradable material to remove organic and inorganic pollutants (Cho et al. 2015; Martínez-Cabanas 
et al. 2016). Biodegradable materials can be utilized to add an additional surface of biologically 
produced NMs/NPs that can be modified by binding sites for the enhanced removal of heavy met￾als and other contaminants from wastewater. Organic materials have been added to the surface of 
Me/MeONPs to create additional binding sites for Cd adsorption (II)(Singh et al. 2014). Organic 
(tricholorehylene) and inorganic (chromium) pollutants have been simultaneously removed from 
hydrogel green-synthesized agarose-Fe nanoparticles (Luo et al. 2016).
2.3.4 Multifunctional Nano-Composite
NMs/NPs are currently being explored because of their multi-functional actions, creating smart 
materials with two or more separate actions. Nanotechnology-based products have been developed 
recently to perform a variety of functions. For example, to perform multiple tasks simultaneously in 
the study, Ag NP was biosynthesized using vegetable A extract to produce NP-embedded polyvinyl 
alcohol film. Ag, Cu and zero-valent iron (ZVI) NP hybrid clusters have been patented and can be 
used to treat various industrial wastewaters in tannery, textile and pharmaceutical waste.
In water inclosing contaminated metals such as Cu (II), Cd (II) and Pb(II), the efficacy of chitosan/
silver nanoparticle/Cu nanoparticle/CNT multifunctional nanocomposite has been studied. In just 
10 minutes, these multifunctional nanocomposites almost completely removed metal ions from the 
solution. It is also possible to regenerate this multifunctional nanocomposite.
2.3.5 Transformation
Environmental human activities are leading to the accretion of new pollutants of organic and inor￾ganic contaminants in the environment, which can be purified from contaminated sites by converting 
them through oxidation or reduction; these reactions may lead to the formation of metals that may 
reduce their toxicity. In addition, site change and/or toxicity result from the presence of electron trans￾fer reactions in a stable oxidation state. Heavy metal conversions such as Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn and Pb have 
been extensively studied using ZVI NP in several experimental and field studies to reduce Cr (VI) 
by NZVI particles (Singh, Misra, and Singh 2012). NZVI particles act as an electron donor to reduce 
Cr (VI); during the reduction of Cr, ferrous iron is released from NZVI particles (VI) and molecular 
hydrogen, atomic active hydrogen and Fe (II)-containing solid minerals such as NZVI corrosion 
products, all of which contribute to the reduction process. NZVI particles effectively removed 85% of 
Zn2+ from an aqueous solution in the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) in a separate study. Due to 
DO corrosion, the surface of NZVI particles was coated with an iron (oxy) hydroxide shell, resulting 
in increased Zn2+ adsorption and co-precipitation (Liang et al. 2014). Numerous organic chemical 
pollutants have also been used to reduce NZVI particles. Chlorinated pesticides, organophosphates, 
nitroamines, nitroaromatics and chlorinated solvents may all contribute to organic chemical pollu￾tion (Liang et al. 2014). The metal oxidation states of ions and NMs offer considerable possibilities 
for redox cycling. For environmental remediation, the term transformation refers to the elimination 
of organic and inorganic chemical pollutants and their transportation and toxicity.Nanomaterial’s Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs 45
2.3.5.1 Catalysis
Catalytic technologies are a prerequisite for present and future energy, chemical processes and 
environmental sectors (Centi et al. 2002). Catalytic technology is used to convert crude oil, coal 
and natural gas into fuels and chemical raw materials, to produce various petrochemical and chemi￾cal products and to control CO, hydrocarbon and NO emissions (Centi, Quadrelli, and Perathoner 
2013). For efficient catalysts, high-quality products made from low-cost, environmentally friendly 
raw materials are required. Active catalysts must increase the number of sites not only to expand 
their surface area but also to reduce the size of catalytic particles (Chaturvedi, Dave, and Shah 
2012). The prospects for biological pathways for NM/NP synthesis therefore indicate that the two 
functions required for active catalysis are both low-cost and environmentally friendly. Most of the 
benchtop research and field applications for wastewater treatment materials are now concentrat￾ing their efforts on magnetic nanoscale materials (Westerhoff et al. 2016). Magnetic iron oxide 
NM/NP appears to have the ability to treat a large amount of wastewater and is suitable for magnetic 
separation, making it one of the most promising heavy metal treatment materials (Neyaz, Siddiqui, 
and Nair 2014). Photocatalysis is an acceleration of a photoreaction in the presence of a catalyst and 
is suitable for inorganic and organic photo degradations. First, in the photocatalysis process, visible 
light or ultraviolet radiation sensitizes a semiconductor catalyst, causing it to form electron and hole 
pairs (Navarro Yerga et al. 2009). If the incident light energy is equal to or greater than the band gap 
energy of the semiconductor, then the electrons in the valence band are elated and move up to the 
semiconductor conduction band, thus generating holes in the valence band (Umar and Aziz 2013). 
When these pores divide water molecules into hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, organic pollutants 
undergo oxidative degradation (Gratzel 2001). Redox reactions are caused by the reaction of con￾ductive band electrons with DO, which produces superoxide anions.
2.3.5.2 Fenton Reaction
A Fenton reaction is a progressed oxidation process (AOP) that has been advocated as a way to boost 
the efficiency of removing organic and inorganic pollutants from specific agents (Cuerda-Correa, 
Alexandre-Franco, and Fernández-González 2020). For different industries containing phenol in 
the wastewater (such as pharmaceutical industries and their wastewater treatment plants) and other 
organic pollutants, this response is one of the alternate methods for wastewater treatment. Since iron 
oxides are rich in content, easy to separate and low in cost, they are often used as heterogeneous 
catalysts in Fenton oxidation systems (Gadipelly et al. 2014). The heterogeneous Fenton reaction 
produces a hydroxyl radical (OH) and an ion of hydroxide (OH) when hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
oxidizes Fe2+ ion to Fe3+. Another H2O2 molecule further catalyses the dissolution of Fe3+ to 
form Fe2+ and generates a hydroperoxyl radical (OOH) and a proton (He et al. 2016). These free 
radicals are powerful oxidants associated with the oxidation process of organic pollutants. Li and 
Zhang (2016) noted that hematite NP, with the help of white rot fungi, promoted the degradation of 
bisphenol A caused by a Fenton-like reaction. The removal rate of nitrate in wastewater is evalu￾ated by using green synthetic iron nanoparticles through a Fenton reaction (Wang et al. 2014). The 
Fenton reaction, along with the fluidized-bed Fenton process (FBF), has recently been thoroughly 
reviewed (Garcia-Segura et al. 2016). This is one of the most promising methods for biologically 
producing iron nanoparticles to reduce the burden on organic and inorganic environments (Tisa, 
Raman, and Daud 2014).
2.3.6 Contamination Characteristics and Potential Environmental Implications
2.3.6.1 Environmental Contamination
The environment is often contaminated or polluted. There are different forms of pollution, and 
pollutants may cause harmful effects on the environment. According to the literature, pollution 
is defined as the direct or indirect introduction of human-released substances or energy into the 46 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
environment, resulting in harmful effects such as damage to life resources, human health, envi￾ronmental activities and the environment, including the quality of use of the environment and the 
reduction of facilities. Environmental pollution is an unfavorable and undesirable change. It has an 
impact on the physical, chemical and biological properties of air, water and soil. These will, in turn, 
have an injurious effect on organisms. Pollution may originate from natural or foreign chemical or 
energy substances (Wong 2012).
2.3.6.2 Types of Pollutants
Environmental pollutants are still a global problem and a challenge that mankind has faced in recent 
decades. Various types of pollutants exist, such as inorganic and organic pollutants (Amin, Alazba, 
and Manzoor 2014).
2.3.6.3 Heavy Metals
Heavy metals are defined in the literature as natural elements with atomic weights (AWs) and densi￾ties five times higher than water (Bánfalvi 2011). Amongst all contaminants, substantial metals have 
received considerable attention due to their enormous toxicity. Heavy metals in natural water usu￾ally exist in the form of trace elements, but even at very low concentrations, they are highly toxic.
Even in small amounts, metals including arsenic, lead, cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), 
chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn) and selenium (Si) are very toxic. Currently, the rise in heavy 
metal content in our resources is a major issue, particularly because many industries discharge 
metal-containing waste that has not been treated (Förstner, Mader, and Salomons 1995). Heavy 
metals become poisonous materials when they are not metabolized by the human body and are 
stored in soft tissues. They often impact people in agriculture, and one study (Singh et al. 2011) 
indicates that the collective route for adult exposure is industrial exposure. Ingestion is the most 
common way that children come into contact. The environment and its resources have been pol￾luted by natural and human activities, and the pollutants released exceed the environment’s capacity 
(Herawati et al. 2000; He, Yang, and Stoffella 2005).
2.3.6.4 Sources of Heavy Metals
Heavy metals could be the result of both natural and man-made processes and may eventually enter 
various environmental zones (soil, water, air and their interfaces).
2.3.6.5 Natural Processes
A number of studies have identified natural sources of several heavy metals. Under certain environ￾mental conditions, natural emissions of heavy metals will occur (Masindi and Muedi 2018). These 
emissions can be caused by volcanic eruptions, sea salt spray, forest fires, rock weathering, biologi￾cal sources and wind-borne soil particles, which are just a few of the sources of these emissions. 
Metal may be released from its endemic areas into altered ecological sections because of natural 
weathering. Hydroxides, oxides, sulfides, sulfates, phosphates, silicates and organic compounds are 
all examples of heavy metals (Tchounwou et al. 2012). The most common heavy metals are the fol￾lowing: Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, As, Hg, Zn and Cu. Even when trace amounts of these heavy metals can be 
identified, they may still cause serious health problems for humans and other mammals (Herawati 
et al. 2000).
2.3.6.6 Anthropogenic Processes
Pollution is also released into various settings as a consequence of agriculture, industrial activities, 
mining, metallurgical methods and runoff. For some metals, the amount of metal released by man￾made heavy metal processes is higher than that released by natural processes. Naturally discharged 
metals in wind-blown dust mainly come from the industrial sector. Automobile exhaust, smelting, 
pesticide production and fossil fuel combustion also lead to the release of large amounts of Pb, As, Nanomaterial’s Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs 47
Cu, Zn, Ni, vanadium, Hg, Si and tin, which ultimately increase the heavy metal pollution in the 
environment. Therefore, human activities amplify environmental pollution due to daily production 
that meets the needs of the world’s population (He, Yang, and Stoffella 2005).
2.3.6.7 Categories of Nanomaterials
NPs are mainly divided into various categories according to their shape, scope and chemical prop￾erties (Khan, Saeed, and Khan 2019). According to these physical and chemical characteristics, 
five categories can be distinguished, namely, carbon-based nanoparticles, metal NPs, polymer NPs, 
semiconductor NPs and lipid-based NPs.
2.3.7 Carbon-Based Nanoparticles
Carbon-based nanoparticles are made entirely of carbon. Since their discovery, they have attracted 
the scientific community (Zhang et al. 2013). They are formed by a cloud of weakly delocalized 
electrons along the z-axis and a layer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in which each atom is connected 
to the other three carbon atoms in the x–y plane (Scida et al. 2011). This configuration has many 
advantages, such as high electrical conductivity, π-plasmon resonance and the capacity to form 
charging-transfer complexes in contact with the donor groups of electrons (Barnes et al. 2007; 
Valcárcel et al. 2008). This configuration also allows the occurrence of robust van der Waals forces 
obstructing in a significant way the dispersion and solubility of this group of nanoparticles (Scida 
et al. 2011). Nanoparticles based on carbon are formed of fullerenes, CNTs, graphene and its deriva￾tives, graphene oxide, nanodiamonds and carbon-based quantum dots (Patel, Singh, and Kim 2019).
2.3.7.1 Fullerenes
Fullerenes are synthesized by evaporating, in an inert helium atmosphere, graphite electrodes 
(Stevenson et al. 1999). They can be synthesized in different ways, such as discharge, electron beam 
ablation and sputtering (Smalley 1997; Ross et al. 2009; Churilov et al. 2013). However, the high 
synthesis cost and low yield of existing production technologies considerably limit the use of these 
carbon-based nanoparticles. Fullerenes have high electrochemical stability due to their special char￾acteristics, small size, specific shape and neat structure, so they can be used in energy conversion 
FIGURE 2.3 Categories of nanoparticles according to their shape and chemical properties.48 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
systems (Kamat 2006). This finding marked the start of the era of carbon NMs, which are also 
called synthetic carbon allotropes (SCAs). Fullerenes have received significant consideration since 
their discovery due to their unique photophysical and photochemical properties. They are a 0D form 
of graphitic carbon and resemble an irregular sheet of graphenium curled up into a sphere by adding 
pentagons to its structure. They can be presented in different shapes and sizes ranging from 30 to 
300 carbon atoms. The majority of fullerenes (e.g., C60) have a spheroidal shape, but there are also 
some with oblong shapes similar to a rugby ball (e.g., C70). The smallest stable and most prominent 
fullerene is the Buckminsterfullerene (C60) that is spheroid in shape and formed by 60 structurally 
equivalent sp2 hybridized carbon atoms with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons or 60 C atoms consist￾ing of 12-five member rings and 20-six member rings (Kumar and Kumbhat 2016; Kour et al. 2020). 
With 0.7 nm in diameter, the C sites are equivalent, and the double and single bond lengths are 0.14 
nm and 0.146 nm, respectively.
2.3.7.2 Carbon Nanotubes
Carbon nanotube (CNT) is derived from carbon fiber and fullerene. The molecule has 60 carbon 
atoms and is cylindrical in shape (Polizu et al. 2006). CNTs can be classified into two separate 
categories depending on the number of carbon layers present in these nanostructures (Anzar 
et al. 2020). We distinguish single wall (SW) CNTs, which comprise graphene layers with a 
diameter between 0.4 and 2 nm (usually in the form of hexagonal bundles), from multi-walled 
CNTs containing two or more CNTs. The composition of CNTs (MWCNT) includes many cyl￾inders, and each cylinder is composed of graphene sheets. Their diameter is between 1 and 3 nm 
(He et al. 2013).
The arc discharge method, laser ablation method and chemical vapour deposition method are 
three different ways to produce CNTs (Anzar et al. 2020). CNTs display a wide range of chemical 
and physical properties, mainly a high tensile strength, ultra-light weight, special electronic struc￾tures and high chemical and thermal stability. Due to these outstanding properties, carbon NMs 
are the most widely applied nanostructures and are utilized for a number of applications, including 
their use as biomolecules, drugs and drug supply to target organs, biosensor diagnostics and analysis 
(Che, Cagin, and Goddard III 2000).
2.3.7.3 Graphene and Its Derivatives
Graphene discovery was the result of the work of Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 
2004 (Lee et al. 2019). Graphene has drawn the scientific community’s attention since its find￾ing, prompting extensive research into the NM’s potential applications (Novoselov et al. 2004). 
A single-atom-thick flat sheet of sp2—bonded carbon atoms perfectly arranged in a honeycomb 
lattice—makes up grapheme (Zhu et al. 2016; Paul et al. 2019). The carbon atoms forming this 
two-dimensional structure are bonded at a length of 0.142 nm (Paul et al. 2019). A graphene sheet’s 
thickness is approximately 0.34 nm, and its size can range from a few nanometers to several cen￾timetres depending on the synthesis method (Mahmoudi, Wang, and Hahn 2018). In addition to its 
particular structure, Each carbon atom is covalently bound together in the same plane in graphene, 
which is made of pure carbon, and the monolayer graphene sheets are bound together by van der 
Waals force (Lee et al. 2019).
Qualified as “supermaterial” or “miracle material,” graphene and its derivatives are studied in 
various fields due to the presence of an aromatic ring, free π-electron and functional reactive groups 
(Paul et al. 2019). It can be achieved using three unique techniques, namely, exfoliation, chemical 
vapour deposition and chemical-based techniques (Tahriri et al. 2019). Graphene is widely known 
for its high electrical conductivity, light weight (0.77 mg/m2), exceptional properties and high opac￾ity (only 2.3% of the white light is absorbed by graphene) (Nair et al. 2008; Chauhan, Yadav, and 
Sehrawat 2020). These great properties offer a large number of applications in mechanical engineer￾ing, electrical engineering and micro-electronics (Bharech and Kumar 2015).Nanomaterial’s Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs 49
2.3.8 Metal Nanoparticles
Metal nanoparticles are engineering NMs that have been generally used in the production of com￾mercial, industrial and environmental controls (Zhang et al. 2018). Due to their smaller size and 
higher specific surface area, Fe, Co and Ni metal nanoparticles have rare magnetic, optical, electro￾chemical and chemical catalytic properties, which have piqued the interest of the scientific commu￾nity (Khalid et al. 2017). Sunscreens, cosmetics and toothpaste are just a few examples of customer 
products, and in industrial catalysis, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO2) are added (Zhang 
et al. 2018). More than 400 products contain silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), including detergents, 
food packaging, cosmetics and textiles, while ceria nanoparticles (nCeO2) are part of the composi￾tion of diesel fuel additives and polishing agents (Ma et al. 2015; Vance et al. 2015).
Metal nanoparticles have long been used to remove and repair pollutants (organic pollutants, 
heavy metals and radionuclides) and pathogens in the environment. They can absorb toxic sub￾stances and convert them into non-toxic substances. They ensure the degradation and absorption 
of pollutants through different mechanisms (including redox reactions, ion exchange, surface com￾plexation, surface processes, adsorption and electrostatic interactions), (Trujillo-Reyes, Peralta￾Videa, and Gardea-Torresdey 2014). Iron NPs are said to be the first nanoparticles to be used for 
environmental cleanup (Chauhan, Yadav, and Sehrawat 2020). Nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) 
has also been used to remove As (III), immobilize Cr (VI) and Pb (II) from aqueous solution and 
reduce chromium to Cr (III) and Pb to Pb (0) (Ponder, Darab, and Mallouk 2000; Kanel et al. 2005). 
Organic contaminants such as atrazine and molinate can be suppressed with nano-sized zero-valent 
ions (Chauhan, Yadav, and Sehrawat 2020). Zero-valent iron particles immobilising in the silica 
microsphere can also be used to remediate soils from polybrominated diphenyl ethers, which are a 
class of environmental contaminants (Xie et al. 2016). This extraordinary ability to neutralize haz￾ardous environmental contamination is partially attributed to their potent reductant nature (Kanel 
et al. 2012).
2.3.9 Semiconductor Nanoparticles
Semiconductor nanoparticles are crystalline clusters of a few hundred to a few thousand atoms 
(Chen and Dobson 2012). They are made from a wide range of different compounds (Suresh 2013). 
Their size is typically comprised between 1–100 nm (Smith and Nie 2010). They are classified into 
three categories of nanocrystal semiconductor, specifically, II-VI, III-V and IV-VI, based on the 
periodic table groups forming these elements. For instance, ZnO, zinc sulfide and cadmium sulfide 
are II-VI semiconductors, and group IV-VI materials include silicon and germanium (Sahu 2019). 
Semiconductor nanoparticles show in most cases the behaviour of quantum containment in a size 
ranged between 1 and 20 nm (Suresh 2013). Semiconductor nanoparticles display attractive physical 
and chemical properties that include high chemical and photo bleaching stability, surface function￾ality, constant absorption bands and a slight and intensive emission spectra (Sahu 2019). Because 
of these outstanding properties, they have become the research focus for the last two decades, and 
several applications of these nanoparticles are used in a variety of disciplines, mainly solid state 
physics, chemistry, material sciences, biological sciences, medical sciences, and the engineering 
and interdisciplinary fields (Smith and Nie 2010).
2.3.10 Polymeric Nanoparticles
Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are solid or colloidal particles with a tiny size ranging from 10 
to 1000 nanometers (Nasir, Kausar, and Younus 2015). The term polymeric nanoparticle is attrib￾uted to any type of polymer nanoparticles, especially to nanocapsules and nanospheres (Rao and 
Geckeler 2011). Nanocapsules are defined as vesicular systems that act as a reservoir. They con￾sist of a cavity containing a liquid core in which substances can be trapped in the shell of a solid 50 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
material (El-Say and El-Sawy 2017). In contrast, nanospheres are the particles of a spherical matrix 
whole mass is solid. As a result, the molecules can be adsorbed on the surface of the sphere or 
encapsulated inside the particle (Vauthier and Couvreur 2000).
The main component of polymeric nanoparticles is the polymer, which can be natural or syn￾thetic depending on the polymer source of origin. Many materials need to be reassembled to create 
a polymeric nanoparticle (El-Say and El-Sawy 2017). Several methods can be applied to produce 
polymeric nanoparticles, depending on the requirements of their application (Nasir, Kausar, and 
Younus 2015). The different preparation methods that have been developed can be divided into 
two separate group: those that rely on monomer polymerization and those using predetermined 
polymers (Allouche 2013). Evaporation of solvents, salting-out, supercritical fluid technology and 
dialysis procedures are the main techniques used for polymeric nanoparticle formulation from pre￾existing polymers (Rao and Geckeler 2011).
2.3.11 Lipid-Based Nanoparticles
Lipid-based nanoparticles are colloidal carriers with a lipid matrix that is solid at body temperature 
(Shah et al. 2015). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have piqued scholarly interest in recent decades due 
to their unique and tremendous properties that allow them to be used in different domains (Mutyam 
Pallerla and Prabhakar 2013). LNPs can be divided into three categories according to their structure 
and composition: liposomes, solid lipids and nanostructured lipids (Shah et al. 2015).
2.3.11.1 Liposomes
Liposomes are circular vesicles covering the internal aqueous cavity of the lipid bilayer membrane 
(Naseri, Valizadeh, and Zakeri-Milani 2015). The diameter of the liposomes is between 400 nm 
and 2.5 μm (Malam, Loizidou, and Seifalian 2009). Both synthetic and natural phospholipids can 
form the liposome bilayer. Therefore, these nanoparticles are mainly defined by their physical and 
chemical properties and the properties of bilayer phospholipids (Bawarski et al. 2008). Liposomes 
can be synthesized using a wide range of procedures such as the extrusion technique, probe or bath 
sonication and microfluidization (Panahi et al. 2017).
Since their discovery in 1965, they are considered the basic models of lipid-based formulations 
widely used for bioactive component encapsulation and drug delivery (Mukherjee, Ray, and Thakur 
2009). They offer encouraging advantages as a pharmaceutical carrier by ensuring good protection 
of drugs against enzyme degradation and having less toxicity and great biocompatibility, biodegrad￾ability and non-immunogenicity (Kumar et al. 2010). Liposomes are widely used as effective DNA 
supply systems, siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (asODN) (Jayaraman et al. 2012; Kawabata 
et al. 2012). In addition to their use as a drug and DNA carrier, liposomes are also employed in the 
food industry to prevent the degradation of key enzymes, sugars and vitamins for great nutritional 
value (Panahi et al. 2017). They have great properties, but the use of liposomes can present some lim￾itations due to their low encapsulation efficiency and low storage stability (Bamrungsap et al. 2012).
2.3.11.2 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs)
Nanoparticles of solid lipids, also referred to as lipospheres, are colloidal particles between 50 and 
1000 nm in size (Malam, Loizidou, and Seifalian 2009). They are formed from a range of physi￾ological biodegradable lipids that remain constantly in a solid state despite temperature variation 
(García-Pinel et al. 2019). The synthesis of SLNs is accomplished by replacing the liquid lipid 
(oil) in an oil-in-water emulsion with a solid lipid, such as mono-, di- and triglycerides, fatty acids, 
waxes and combinations thereof (Malam, Loizidou, and Seifalian 2009). Several substances, such 
as phospholipids, Poloxamers and Polysorbates, are added to the SLN formulation to provide the 
steric stabilisation of nanoparticles (Geszke-Moritz and Moritz 2016). The majority of SLNs can be 
obtained by high shear, hot or cold homogenization, by ultrasonication or by solvent emulsification/
evaporation (Mukherjee, Ray, and Thakur 2009).Nanomaterial’s Characteristics to Remediate Polluted Environs 51
SLNs emerged in the early 1990s to overcome the weakness of other conventional lipid carriers 
by providing biocompatibility and storage stability and avoiding drug degradation (Geszke-Moritz 
and Moritz 2016). They display attractive features such as a small size, giant surface zone, low 
toxicity and greater cellular uptake than other carriers, which justify their use in the pharmaceuti￾cal and biomedical fields as carrier systems, thus substituting for liposomes (Yadav, Khatak, and 
Sara 2013; Lingayat, Zarekar, and Shendge 2017). Despite SLNs’ great advantages, they show many 
weaknesses that can considerably limit their use. The limitations include that they present low 
space for drug encapsulation, which ultimately leads to poor loading capacity, unwanted interaction 
among the different components and a moderate elevation in the water content of the dispersions 
(Mishra et al. 2018).
2.3.11.3 Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC)
Nanostructured lipids are modified SLNs in which the lipid phase is established by a mixture of 
solid and liquid phase lipids at ambient temperature (Tamjidi et al. 2013). They can be synthesized 
utilizing the same procedures used for the formation of SLNs (Yoon, Park, and Yoon 2013). Three 
forms of structure can be distinguished. Solid and liquid lipids are mixed in the imperfect type 
(Naseri, Valizadeh, and Zakeri-Milani 2015). The second form matches the non-crystalline matrix, 
that is, it is a formless type with no crystalline structure (Jaiswal, Gidwani, and Vyas 2016). The 
third or multiple type is identical to w/o/w emulsions and is characterized by an enormous drug 
solubility in liquid lipids compared with solids (Müller, Staufenbiel, and Keck 2014).
NLCs are the next generation of SLNs that were introduced at the end of the 1990s to overcome 
the drawbacks of SLNs (Müller, Staufenbiel, and Keck 2014). Indeed, NLCs have a higher loading 
capacity and a lower water content in the dispersion; more importantly, with NLCs, drug expulsion 
is minimized compared with SLNs (Naseri, Valizadeh, and Zakeri-Milani 2015).
2.4 CONCLUSION
To understand the full implications of NMs in eco-friendly applications, several challenges must 
be overcome. However, nanotechnology proposes many approaches that can be used to solve envi￾ronmental pollution. Although the detailed mechanism of the interaction among NMs’ interesting 
characteristics to remediate pollution and soil components are outside the scope of this work and 
should be clarified in future revisions, here, we determine the possibility of Me/MeONPs as an 
addition or additional nanoremediation technology that is directed at heavy metal adsorbents. Based 
on the advantages and limits of each material, we provide here an overall view of some NMs that 
have been used in environmental remediation.

Carbon-Based Nanomaterials 
to Environs’ Remediation

Fernanda Maria Policarpo Tonelli
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Environmental pollution is a problem that threatens the lives of countless species, is a major cause 
of mortality and morbidity and, although quite present today, is not recent. One of the main causes 
of this is human actions through industrialization, urbanization and mining exploration. This 
problem plagues not only developed countries but also underdeveloped countries and countries that 
are undergoing intense development. However, these countries have different ways of dealing with 
the problem. In general, developed countries have stricter laws and awareness of the environmental 
situation (Ukaogo et al., 2020).
Pollutants can be divided into two main groups, namely, organic and inorganic, and are spread 
over water, air and soil. Organic pollutants include pesticides and dyes, and inorganic pollutants 
encompass radionuclides and heavy metals (Tonelli and Tonelli, 2020). Most of these pollutants 
are persistent and accumulate in plant and animal species. Through the food chain, pollutants are 
passed from species to species. Therefore, humans can be in contact with pollution not just through 
direct exposure. Humans, when eating, for example, can also ingest pollutants and have their health 
impaired. This can intoxicate them, damage their DNA or even lead to death (Kazemzadeh and 
Zali, 2023; Venkatraman et al., 2024).
Regarding water pollution, special care must be taken since water is an essential substance for 
living beings whose quantity is limited and stocks are being depleted on Earth. Therefore, strate￾gies to purify water become even more necessary (Ying et al., 2017). Two sources of water pollution 
deserve to be highlighted: landfills and wastewater. Through the composition of wastewater, it is 
possible to obtain some information about the way of life of a given population. Organic pollutants 
are the main contaminants found when analyzing domestic wastewater. In general, there is a large 
amount of estrogenic hormones and drugs in wastewater from large urban centers. Estrogen and 
endocrine disrupting products, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, can be present in polluted waters, 
which can cause living systems to be unbalanced (Yeung et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2020). The presence 
of drugs in water is mainly due to the ease with which patients obtain them, even without a medical pre￾scription, and their incorrect disposal. These residues can contaminate animals, extend through￾out the food chain and impact human health, even at low casualties, since they remain present even 
after water treatment (Mezzelani et al., 2018).
In addition to domestic sewage, another important source of water pollution is industrial sewage 
contamination. In it, it is possible to find pollutants (products and by-products) that vary accord￾ing to the type of industry from which water is discharged, such as veterinary products, personal 
hygiene products, drugs, heavy metals, dyes and food additives. Organic pollutants and phosphorus 
from chemically improved primary industries are not usually removed from the water after 
treatment; then, they are released into the environment and modify the chemical composition of 
a given ecosystem. Dyes are also great environmental polluters. Azo dyes, for example, have 
great carcinogenic and mutagenic potential, and may be present in polluted water (Alharbi et al., 
2018; Guo et al., 2019).
3Carbon-Based Nanomaterials to Environs’ Remediation 61
In addition to water pollution, air pollution is another extremely important factor concern￾ing the destruction of the environment. With the increase in industrial activities, population 
growth and, consequently, consumption patterns, there is an increase in the concentration of 
toxic gases in the air, such as SO2, NO, CO2 and O3, in addition to suspended particles and other 
compounds. The origin of most of these pollutants relates to the production of energy by burn￾ing fossil fuels. These compounds are extremely harmful to humans and can cause respiratory 
problems and severe intoxication. In addition, through them, there may be an intensification of 
the greenhouse effect, which leads to an increase in Earth’s temperatures, unbalancing ecosys￾tems and threatening species. Climate change can also lead to the production of two allergens 
that become available in the air, specifically, pollen and mold, due not only to the lengthening 
of the pollen season and its greater production but also to the increase in humidity by floods 
and extreme climates.
Air pollutants can be deadly and present severe health risks. During the combustion of gas, 
gasoline and coal or incineration, they are released. Some of the most common pollutants 
are mercury, benzene, dioxin and lead. Mercury causes damage to the central nervous system. 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, in large quantities, can lead to problems with 
the liver and blood and irritation of the lungs and eyes, in addition to being carcinogenic. Dioxins 
can damage the nervous, endocrine, reproductive and immune systems. Lead in higher concentra￾tions can affect the nervous system and kidneys, especially in children. In small amounts, it can 
affect their learning and IQ.
Another environmental aspect directly affected is the soil. According to the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), because of population growth, which leads to greater 
food production, and incorrect soil planting and burning, soil degradation is already occurring, 
resulting in a lack of nutrients (micro and macronutrients) in and scarcity of soil (FAO, 2024). In 
addition to these issues, there continues to be great concern with the contamination of the soil by 
pharmaceutical products, toxic metals, such as Cd, Pb and Ni and pesticides that compromise the 
quality and safety of the food produced.
Nanoscale materials have been explored as important tools for the efficient remediation of 
contaminated environs. In this chapter, they receive attention, and some of the main uses of 
carbon-based nanomaterials to promote the remediation of water, soil and air are reviewed.
3.1.1 Nanomaterials
The term “nanotechnology” was created in 1974 by Norio Taniguchi and refers to nanoscale mate￾rials that have been produced and used since the 1950’s (Taniguchi, 1974). Many scientists have 
been searching different protocols to chemically modify and to even synthesize them to perform a 
specific task (Zhang et al., 2008). The field of nanotechnology has been in a development process 
that offers low-cost strategies to improve not only environmental remediation but also sensors, 
drug delivery and gene delivery, among other applications. Especially green synthesis has been 
explored to produce green-fabricated nanomaterials (NMs) as eco-friendly tools (Nasrollahzadeh 
et al., 2021).
NMs are classified based on their morphology/shape. In this way, they are mainly classified 
as nanoparticles (NPs—zero-dimensional), nanowires (NWs—one-dimensional), nanotubes 
(NTs—one-dimensional), nanofibers (NFs—one-dimensional) and nanomembranes (NMBs—
two-dimensional); there are also some 3D structures that can be synthesized and a one-dimen￾sional variation for some nanostructures such as gold that can be organized into rods (Figure 3.1). 
According to their composition, they can be classified as organic NMs based on organic molecules 
or inorganic NMs based on inorganic molecules (Lu and Astruc, 2020).
To be considered a nanomaterial, at least one dimension of the material has to present a size 
ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers. It must also demonstrate high stability (chemical, thermal and 
physical), catalytic activity and chemical reactivity (Xu et al., 2019). Nanomaterials usually have 62 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
the property of aggregating when hydrated and being sedimented at different rates, which depends 
on the charge of their surface and the charge magnitude. Regarding nanomaterials’ surfaces, they 
can be made by natural organic matter (NOM), other organic molecules or mono- or divalent cat￾ions (Keller et al, 2010).
Due to all these characteristics, NMs are versatile in their functions and can be used in processes 
such as imaging/diagnosis, vaccine development, tissue engineering and the treatment of health 
problems through drug and gene delivery. Scientists can chemically modify nanomaterials’ surface 
and functionalize them to perform specific desirable tasks, which makes them acquire specific 
characteristics that optimize them for the specific role to be performed (Tonelli et al., 2015, 2016, 
2020).
Safety for living beings is the main aspect regarding the extensive use of nanomaterials for the 
remediation of water, soil and air. The use of these materials and the final product of this remedia￾tion must not, under any circumstances, pose a high-risk threat to fauna and flora of the ecosystem 
that will undergo nanoremediation. Thus, a concern and a search for safety and biocompatibility 
must always be maintained so that this strategy can be used on large scales (Pulizzi and Sun, 2018; 
Tonelli and Tonelli, 2023). One of the strategies for the remediation of polluted water, for example, 
is the use of nanostructures (Khan and Malik, 2019) and nanosensors (Xie et al., 2019) to detect 
and remove contaminants. Different NMBs and nano-absorbents are in the development stage for 
large-scale industrialization.
The chemical constitution of nanomaterials can be classified into carbon- (CB) and non-carbon￾based (NCB) structures. Examples are graphene (CB), graphene oxide (CB), carbon nanotubes (CB), 
carbon quantum dots (CB), fullerenes (CB) (Figure 3.2), silver quantum dots (NCB) and magnetic 
NPs (NCB) (Trivedi et al., 2020).
The life of animal and plant species, including human life, is directly dependent on water, 
air and soil, and because these elements have been undergoing intense degradation, new safety 
and low-cost remediation strategies are increasingly required to promote efficient environmental 
pollution remediation; nanomaterials can be designed to perform this role with excellent results 
(Ghadimi et al., 2020).
3.2 CARBON-BASED NANOMATERIALS TO REMEDIATE POLLUTED WATER
The carbon element has some properties that make it extremely useful in the production of nano￾materials. First, it has natural (graphite and diamond) and synthetic (carbon-based nanomaterials) 
FIGURE 3.1 Nanomaterial classification based on morphology/shape.Carbon-Based Nanomaterials to Environs’ Remediation 63
allotropes. Second, it can hybridize sp, sp² and sp³ and can thus bind to several other elements, and 
even to another carbon atom, to form the structures of interest (Rauti et al., 2019).
Several carbon-based nanomaterials are used to remediate polluted water (Table 3.1), as high￾lighted by the following: amino-functionalized C60 immobilized on 3-(2-succinic anhydride) propyl 
functionalized silica to remediate Cimetidine and Ranitidine; C60 modified by Ag3PO4 to remediate 
Dye acid red 18; C60 modified graphite phase carbonitride to remediate Methylene blue and phe￾nol; carbon dots impregnated in defect-rich g-C3N4 to remediate hexavalent chromium, ofloxacin, 
bisphenol A and ciprofloxacin; nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots hybridized with g-C3N4 to 
remediate Methylene; graphene associated with iron oxide to remediate Methylene blue, rhodamine 
B, acid orange 7 and phenol; reduced graphene oxide functionalized and associated with MnO2
to remediate Methylene blue and arsenite; carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grafted-antifouling layer of 
polyacryloyl hydrazide in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane to remediate micro pollutants and 
heavy metals; Ag-embedded C60 to remediate 4-nitrophenol and orange G dye; fullerene coating 
nano titanium dioxide and Polyhydroxy fullerene to remediate the herbicide Mesotrione; anatase￾TiO2 NPs modified by fullerene to remediate Methylene blue; carbon dots decorating hollow carbon 
nitride nanospheres to remediate naproxen; carbon dots attached to tungsten oxide to remediate 
Cd2+ and crystal violet; graphene oxide in magnetic aerogel to remediate Congo red, Methylene 
blue, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Cr3+; a graphene oxide platform containing a nickel-benzene dicarboxyl￾ate nano-sized nickel metal organic framework and a CNT platform containing a nickel-benzene 
dicarboxylate nano-sized nickel metal organic framework to remediate Methylene blue; chitosan￾CNT-supporting palladium NPs to remediate 2-nitroaniline, 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitro-o-phenylene￾diamine and 2,4-dinitrophenol, methyl orange, Congo red, methyl red and Methylene blue dyes in 
water (Tonelli et al., 2020).
Carbon dots have a small size, high catalytic activity, superconductivity, good dispersibility, 
high crystallization and strong fluorescence, and they are considered materials with zero dimen￾sion (Semeniuk et al., 2019). They can easily be functionalized through various packages. They 
are useful in the remediation of polluted water in a chemical sensor/bioimaging field (Rani 
et al., 2020). Water contaminated with naproxen can, for example, be remedied by a metal-free 
FIGURE 3.2 Examples of carbon-based nanomaterials.64 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
photocatalytic nanoreactor composed of hollow carbon nitride nanospheres decorated with carbon 
dots, with an efficiency of 10 mg/L in five minutes of natural solar irradiation (Wu Y. et al., 
2020). Regarding mixed pollution involving the inorganic contaminant hexavalent chromium and 
the organic ones ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and bisphenol A, remediation can be carried out using 
g-C3N4 rich in defects impregnated with N-doped carbon quantum dots (Liu H. et al., 2020). 
Water polluted by Methylene blue can be remedied with nitrogen-doped quantum carbon dots that 
have been hybridized with g-C3N4. This hybridization leads to a 2.6-fold increase in efficiency 
compared to non-hybrid g-C3N4 (Seng et al., 2020).
Carbon-based materials obtained by a green synthesis protocol can also be used in water reme￾diation. For the removal of Cd2+ and degradation of violet crystal, it is possible to use a nanosystem 
composed of tungsten oxide and Trichosanthes cucumerina shells (Smrithi et al., 2020). TiO2 can be 
converted into a material with greater photocatalytic capacity through sustainable nitrogen-doped 
quantum carbon dots derived from Bombyx mori silk fibroin (Wang et al., 2020).
Graphene, another type of carbon-based nanomaterial, contains some interesting characteristics, 
such as high thermal conductivity and mechanical and optical properties. It is a two-dimensional 
nanomaterial composed of hexagonal rings of carbon atoms sp² (Novoselov et al., 2004). The 
remediation of water can be accomplished through graphene, including connecting it to a biochar 
(Tiwari et al., 2020). It is thus possible to form a graphene nanosystem containing biochar

(Fang et al., 2020). In addition, graphene can be linked to iron oxide to degrade waste pollutants, 
such as rhodamine B, Methylene blue, orange acid 7 and phenol, which leads to an increase in its 
activity. Another advantage of the system is the stability in different systems, from pH 3 to 9, allow￾ing it to be applied to water treatment (Hammad et al., 2020).
Graphene oxide can be generated by the oxidation of graphene flakes followed by exfoliation. 
Generating this structure is interesting, since it presents less toxicity and greater compatibility than 
graphene and does not need surfactant to be dispersed in water (Kiew et al., 2016)
Water polluted with Methylene blue has been remedied by the adsorption of the compound in 
graphene oxide bonded to the nickel-benzene dicarboxylate platform, an organic nickel metal nano￾structure (Ahsan et al., 2020). CNTs can also be used. Another way to remedy this and arsenide 
contamination is performed with reduced graphene oxide functionalized with functional groups of 
black cumin seeds and associated with MnO2 particles (Tara et al., 2020).
Graphene oxide can also be used to make an airgel. The oxide is self-gelling with Fe3O4 and 
forms a magnetic airgel. When in use, it has the capacity to adsorb metal ions such as Cr3+, Pb2+, 
Cd2+ and Cu2+ and dyes such as Methylene blue and Congo red (Xiong et al., 2020).
C60 belongs to the allotropic family of fullerene and is formed by the sp2 hybridization of car￾bon atoms arranged in rings of five or six members to form a hollow sphere. Its discovery was 
recognized in 1996 by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Biglova and Mustafina, 2019). The distance 
between the edges of two hexagons are 1.38 Å long (double bonds), and at each end of the penta￾gon and hexagon, they are 1.45 Å long (Hirsch, 1995). It is possible to functionalize fullerene to 
use it in the remediation of polluted water. The poly (N-vinylpyrrolidone) compound, for example, 
can be encapsulated and have greater efficiency than a hydroxylated version to generate reactive 
oxygen species that can destroy microorganisms sensitive to superoxide and singlet oxygen and 
remedy pollutants (Brunet et al., 2009). To degrade Methylene blue in water, fullerene photocata￾lytic activity can modify graphite phase carbonitride. It is also possible to degrade phenol in this 
way (Bai et al., 2014).
Methylene blue can also be degraded by fullerene and anatase-TiO2, as modified by C60, to pro￾duce an increase in its photocatalytic capacity (Qi et al., 2016).
To remedy pharmaceutical pollutants in water, such as ranitidine and cimetidine, 3-(2-succinic 
anhydride) propyl-silica functionalized in C60 amino-functionalized (photoactive structure) can be 
immobilized (Lee et al., 2010).
The orange dye G can be photodegraded by the incorporation of C60 in Ag, which leads to an 
increase in the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (Liu R. et al., 2020).
To remedy water contaminated with the herbicide mesotrione, it is possible to coat other nanomate￾rials such as titanium nano dioxide with polyhydroxy fullerene and fullerene (Djordjevic et al., 2018).
3.3 CARBON-BASED NANOMATERIALS TO REMEDIATE POLLUTED SOIL
Carbon-based nanomaterials have been configured as a good soil remediation alternative without 
prejudice to crops that depend on this soil (Lei et al., 2019). Carbon-based nanomaterials are easily 
absorbed by plant species and can influence their root growth and increase it and their development. 
Other possible actions are facilitated by the germination of seeds and increasing vegetal biomass. 
Precisely, due to the ease of plant species in absorbing nanomaterials, nanofertilizers have been 
researched. Due to carbon-based nanomaterials’ nanostructured information, porous structure, high 
specific surface area and crystallinity, nutrients can be stored in the nanostructure and be delivered 
more easily. In addition, these nanomaterials allow the slow release of active compounds for the 
development of plant culture (Achari and Kowshik, 2018).
Carbon-based nanomaterials are very effective in remedying contaminated soil, and they immo￾bilize contaminants. Antibiotics, paracetamol and chlorinated hydrocarbons can be immobilized by 
CNTs (Yan et al., 2017). Lead and cadmium can be adsorbed by graphene (GN) and graphene oxide 
(GO). These materials can also be used for the transport and slow release of micronutrients in plants 66 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
due to their adapted groups on the surface and high mechanical resistance. Stabilities can also be 
increased by these nanomaterials (Kabiri et al., 2017).
Soil improvement, which leads to increased crop knowledge, can be conducted through two other 
carbon-based nanomaterials: biochar-based fertilizer (BBF) and biochar (BC). These are nanostruc￾tured materials with a mixture of nanographic and amorphous carbon. They are inspired by the 
properties of the “Black Lands of Indians” (BLI) found in the Amazon region with great resilience 
and fertility (Glaser, 2007). The use of these materials leads to the improvement of soil physical and 
active properties and crop yield, nutrient retention and contaminant adsorption (Chew et al., 2020).
The organochlorine pesticide dichlorophenyl trichloroethane (DDT) can be immobilized by 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The same is true for naphthalene, pyrene, fluorene and 
phenanthrene. However, some factors may interfere with the efficiency of this immobilization, such 
as the soil composition and NT concentration. Lead, copper, nickel, mercury, lead and antimony can 
be immobilized on the ground by MWCNTs. However, the immobilization capacity of the nanoma￾terial also depends on the characteristics of the metal (Vithanage et al., 2017).
In addition, MWCNTs can be used as an adjunct in the adsorption of other metals. MWCNT 
participates, for example, with citric acid in the reduction of Cr6+ by citric acid in oxisol. The 
1,2-dichlorobenzene compound has been electrokinetically remedied in clay using a CNT barrier 
(Yuan et al., 2009).
Biochar can be used to remedy soil contaminated by heavy metals through several vehicles. 
One is the ion exchange between the metallic cation and cations associated with the biochar (Mg2+
and Ca2+) from mineral oxides and complexed humic matter. Another mechanism is the complex￾ation of phosphates, carbonates and sulfates in which heavy metals form poorly soluble salts (Lei 
et al., 2019).
Cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is more present in animal-derived than plant-derived biochar 
due to the high Ca2+ content. Thus, the ion exchange mechanism is dominant in biochars of animal 
origin. This can be used to immobilize ions from bovine and pig carcasses, such as Cu2+ and Cd2+. 
Pb2+ immobilization can be accomplished by using biochar. Notably, the metal adsorption mecha￾nism depends on its own characteristics and the structure of the biochar (Lei et al., 2019).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, agrochemicals, phenols, benzene, derivatives, plasticizers 
and medicines (for example, used to treat disorders of the endocrine system and antibiotics) in 
the soil can be adsorbed by biochar due to its great porosity, aromatic structure and large specific 
surface (Dai et al., 2019). It can also interact with several other aromatic and hydrophobic organic 
compounds (Jung et al., 2013). However, such interaction depends on the structure of the compound 
to be adsorbed and can occur in different ways such as through hydrogen bonding, complexation 
and electrostatic attraction.
17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol, bisphenol A and 17α-ethinylestradiol are adsorbed on the biochar 
of Eucalyptus globulus wood with hydrogen bonds. This type of interaction, however, depends on 
the pH change (Ahmed et al., 2018).
A factor that can limit adsorption by biochar is an electrostatic repulsion between groups charged 
with the same signal in the biochart and from the ion to an adsorbed one. This can occur, for exam￾ple, in the adsorption of sulfonic metazachlor and imazamox (Petter et al., 2019).
Graphene, graphene oxide and CNT are not commonly used in the remediation of contaminated 
soil. However, they are widely used for the remediation of water and air by sequestering toxic metal 
ions, organic compounds and rare earth metal ions (Wang et al., 2013). As they are non-porous 
adsorbent materials, contaminants adsorb only on their external surface. However, this does not 
limit their use for soil remediation. They can interact with different contaminants and be covalently 
modified to make such interactions. Graphene oxide, for example, has groups with oxygen, such as 
carbonyl, hydroxyl and carboxyl, which favours electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction, complex￾ation or the establishment of hydrogen bonds (Zhao et al., 2019).
One of the reasons why graphene oxide or graphene is not so used in soil remediation is the 
blocking of adsorptive sites by interactions with soil particles (Zhao et al., 2019). A possible solution Carbon-Based Nanomaterials to Environs’ Remediation 67
is the use of 3D composites containing graphene oxide that can retain solid particles on the external 
surface (Zhao et al., 2019).
Engineered carbonaceous nanomaterials are materials created by mixing carbon-based nanoma￾terials with other materials, or modifying them, to improve some characteristic that favors their use 
to remedy the soil. In general, they have a reduction in aggregation capacity, a higher adsorption 
density of active sites on the surface and an increase in the specific surface area. Thus, new strate￾gies are being adopted to expand the use of these nanomaterials in soil remediation, surpassing 
obstacles (Zhou et al., 2013).
3.4 CARBON-BASED NANOMATERIALS TO REMEDIATE POLLUTED AIR
Carbon-based nanomaterials can also be used in the remediation of polluted air, which can be 
performed by the isolation and filtering of nano-filters, nanocatalysis available in degradation and 
adsorption by nanomaterials (Mohamed, 2017).
The presence of pollutants in the air can be detected when the CNT in filter, for example, con￾tacts the air with the pollutant; this leads to a change in the conductance of the nanomaterial. 
Carbon-based nanomaterials have also been used in filters for filtering carbon dioxide needed by 
plants. This is due to the large specific area and the great adsorption capacity of CNTs (Ong et al., 
2010). Carbon dioxide filtration membranes from plants where they are emitted can also be built 
(Lin et al., 2008).
CNTs build high-energy binding sites, which gives them good adsorptive capacity to remove 
difficult air pollutants (PAHs). Prior to the use of CNT, it must be treated chemically, physically or 
physical-chemically, which will allow access to the internal structure of the tube as a passage for 
pollutants and the removal of impurities. For physical treatment, heat and an oxidizing agent, such 
as oxygen, can be applied. Chemical treatment can use acids, such as sulfuric acid. It is also possible 
to vary the time and temperature at which the process occurs (Gangupomu et al., 2014).
CNTs can be further modified with many amine groups to increase the absorption of carbon 
dioxide in a temperature range from 20°C to 100°C (Su et al., 2009). In addition to the absorption 
of carbon dioxide (CO2), CNTs are used to remove NOx, a mixture of NO and NO2. For this, the air 
containing NO and O2 passes through the NT where the NO is oxidized to NO2 and is then adsorbed 
on the surface of the nitrate species (Zhang et al., 2012). Isopropyl vapor, in contrast, can be chemi￾cally adsorbed on CNT on the surface of functional groups and physically adsorbed by van Der 
Waals forces. Volatile organic compounds can be adsorbed onto CNTs deposited on quartz filters. 
Carbon monoxide can be adsorbed by physisorption or chemisorption on Si-doped and boron-doped 
single-walled CNTs (Azama et al., 2017).
Fullerene is sphere-shaped and can have varying numbers of carbon, ranging among 20, 60, 70, 82, 
100 and even 960, and is organized into 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons (Inagaki and Kang, 2014). Its 
electron acceptors are efficient. They can undergo chemical and physical treatments to be suitable for 
the desired purposes for air remediation. After the heat treatment of fullerenes with carbon dioxide, for 
example, the functional groups methyl (-CH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) on the surface of fullerenes can be 
eliminated with the release of carbon monoxide after heat treatment with carbon dioxide (Silva 
et al., 1999). They can also be used to adsorb organometallics, organic compounds, 1,2-dichloroben￾zene, nitrous oxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene (Cheng et al., 2005).
The graphene family can be specified by a hexagonal graphite monolayer, two-dimensional 
hybridized allotrope sp2 of carbon, and graphene oxide, graphene and reduced graphene oxide are 
members of this family (Bergmann and Machado, 2015).
A strategy to increase the effective surface area to improve its adsorptive capacity is the addition 
of metals or other compounds of pure graphene. A number of carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the 
leaf’s edge and epoxy and hydroxyl in the leaf’s basal plane also enhance their ability to adsorb 
pollutants into the air (Stankovich et al., 2006). The presence of these groups increases the negative 
charge density in graphene oxide, which contributes to the absorption of positively charged heavy 68 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
metals, cationic dyes and synthetic dyes. This property can also be used for adsorbing organic com￾pounds such as drugs, for example, antibiotics, due to its aromatic nature (Bergmann and Machado, 
2015). The reduced form of graphene oxide can be used in effluents containing radionuclides, 
organic solvents and oils, synthetic dyes and metal ions. However, it lacks a high intensity of nega￾tive charge on its surface, which favors its activity to absorb anionic compounds, such as anionic 
dyes.
Currently, a NF-coated filter medium is already in use to capture polluting gases at the entrance 
to gasoline turbines in industrial plants. This represents a large specific surface area for adsorption. 
Polymer NFs are the most used. Carbon-activated NFs with groups of nitrogen-containing groups, 
for example, are efficient in the adsorption of formaldehyde even at low casualties. Another advan￾tage regarding filters containing carbon-based nanomaterials is their high stability (Li et al., 2014).
CNT sensors can be used to detect traces of benzene in the air. These nanomaterials are also 
effective against organic compounds, NOx and CO (Leghrib and Llobet, 2011).
3.5 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Environmental problems are serious threats and are present in the daily life of animal and plant 
species in all ecosystems worldwide. Thus, it becomes increasingly necessary to find alternatives 
to remedy water, soil and air pollution. However, these alternatives cannot be toxic or endanger or 
harm life forms in a given environment. Carbon-based nanomaterials have been shown to be effec￾tive in solving these problems. There are several options for using and modifying these tools to bet￾ter suit the intended use. In this way, carbon-based nanomaterials are manufactured of preferably 
biodegradable materials obtained through green synthesis for the remediation of water, soil and air 
contamination. There is also a need to produce safe, low-cost and biocompatible nanomaterials that 
can be used on a large scale without posing risks. Together with the production and use of these 
structures, environmental awareness and sustainable development must be prioritized in human 
actions.
3.6 CONCLUSION
Human actions have degraded the environment to unprecedented proportions, which leads to prob￾lems in the soil, air and water. These three components are essential for life on Earth. Environmental 
problems have become a serious issue in every country in the world. Thus, urgent measures need to 
be taken to preserve the life of the planet. Carbon-based nanomaterials have proved to be a useful 
alternative for environmental remediation. More research must be conducted to ensure not only the 
safe use of these materials but also ecologically friendly and large-scale production.

Nano-Materials Used 
for Environmental 
Pollution Remediation

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Our environment is surrounded by various harmful contaminants that need to be treated by envi￾ronmentally friendly approaches or techniques (Özkara et al. 2016). Innovative approaches for the 
remediation of air, water, and soil pollutants are continually being developed (Manisalidis et al. 
2020). In recent decades, “nanotechnology” has received a great deal of interest because of its dis￾tinctive characteristics (Guerra et al. 2018). Nanotechnology specifically means any technology 
on the “nanometer scale” (a nano-metre is 10−9 of a meter), which has numerous applications across 
the world (Capek 2019). Because of their higher surface/volume proportion, nano-particles offer 
improved reactivity and, therefore, enhanced efficiency compared to their chunkier equivalents. 
Furthermore, as opposed to conventional methods, nano-particles provide the ability to exploit spe￾cific surface morphology so that they can be conjugated or bonded with functional groups that 
might bind particular atoms of interest (contaminants) for effective remediation (Coetzee et al. 
2020). In addition, deliberately modifying some characteristics of nano-particles (such as the par￾ticle size, morphology, porosity, elemental makeup, etc.) may impart enhanced promising applica￾tions that have a significant impact on the efficiency of the contaminant remediating substance. 
Mechanisms that are produced as a fusion of many various components (hybrids, composites, etc.), 
extracting unique desirable characteristics from each of its constituents, are significantly quite pro￾ductive, versatile, and reliable, unlike techniques that focus on a limited nano-platform. The speci￾ficity and performance of the sample could be enhanced by fabricating the substance with particular 
molecules appropriate to target specific pollutants (Campbell et al. 2015). It is critical that after they 
have been used, the pollution remediation products should not result in some other contaminant. 
Thus, for this area of use, bio-degradable substances are highly significant. The incorporation of 
these substances can improve shareholder trust and appreciation of a specific technique in the sense 
that no waste production needs to be discarded, but it can also provide a cleaner and more sus￾tainable solution for pollutant remediation in the environment. Moreover, emerging advancements 
based on pollutant-specific detection are particularly appealing, as poor effectiveness resulting 
from non-specific can be resolved. Furthermore, many naturally occurring and crafted nano-par￾ticles, including chitosan, silver nano-particles (nAg), and photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO2), 
have shown to possess significant antibacterial effects. Thus, research efforts have been oriented 
to employing nano-technology principles and incorporating them with physio-chemical changes 
of the target particle surface to achieve crafted materials that can resolve various key difficulties 
in pollutant abatement (Pandey and Fulekar 2012; Guerra et al. 2018). Target-based detection, low 
cost, excellent thermal stability, non-toxicity, good biocompatibility, biodegradability, renewability, 
474 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
and reusability are among the primary concerns that need to be addressed in the development of 
innovative sustainable remediation nano-particles (Mishra et al. 2018). Some are fundamentally 
unstable in ordinary operating circumstances considering the possible benefits of the earlier dis￾cussed nano-particles, so their process entails specialised methods for nano-particle development. 
To deter accumulation, increase uniformity, and improve consistency, extra processes are required. 
A further consideration that can sometimes place limits on their usage is the potential toxicity of 
the metal-specific nano-particles used in the treatment methods including their derivatives and 
recovery expenses from the clean-up area. Therefore, to design potential nano-particles that can 
resolve environmental issues, detailed knowledge of substance-specific technologies, manufactur￾ing operations, and quality improvement is needed.
4.2 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Nano-particles are made up of a particular component or can be a combination of a variety of sub￾stances. Naturally found nano-particles are mostly aggregations of substances with different for￾mulations, while a range of methods can effectively synthesise highly pure substances with a single 
constituent. Three key forms of molecular sorting in hybrid nano-particles explain how the element 
atoms are ordered in the nano-particle.
4.3 MIXED NANO-PARTICLES
Mixed nano-particles can be either random or ordered. Randomly mixed alloys correspond to solu￾tions of solids, while ordered ones correspond to ordered arrangements of atoms.
4.4 CORE-SHELL NANO-PARTICLES
Core-shell nano-particles can have variable sizes, thicknesses, and shapes of the core and shell 
with varying surface morphologies. They may be of different forms viz., spherical, centric, 
eccentric, star-like, or tubular. Based on these forms, their functions change from material to 
material. In various disciplines of medicinal biotechnology, core-shell nano-particles have dif￾ferent uses, such as molecular bio-imaging, drug delivery, cancer therapy, and so on. When some 
functional group replaces the nano-particle surface or is covered with a thin coating with mate￾rials of altered different components, the functions of the nano-particles are improved relative 
to the non-functional uncoated ones. There are multiple kinds of core/shell combinations, such 
as metalcore; metal shells, metalcore; non-metal shells, metalcore; polymer shells, non-metal 
core; non-metal shells, polymer core; non-metal shells and polymer core; and polymer shells, 
and vice versa. Core-shell nano-particles specifically made up of metals such as platinum, pal￾ladium, and gold have gained much interest as their characteristics vary substantially from their 
mass (Khan et al. 2019). These nano-particles display electron containment and surface effects 
based on quantum-size effects and can be used as sensors, electronics, and catalysts for a vari￾ety of specialized functional purposes. Core-shells based on materials such as semiconductors 
and polymers have gained significant attention as a range of novel technologies with potential 
uses in different electronics, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovolta￾ics (OPVs), and sensors and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), because of their attributes, 
namely, low cost, effectiveness, and simplistic manufacturing capabilities (Watson et al. 2016). 
Furthermore, they exhibit applications in biomedical domains such as polymer-based drug carri￾ers, extra-corporeal tools, prostheses, and dental products. These nano-materials are synthesised 
via various fabrication techniques such as hydro; solvothermal synthesis, sol-gel technique, and 
emulsion; and micro-emulsion polymerisation. The synthesis methods, attributes, and morpholo￾gies can be altered based on the materials of the core and shell.Non-Carbon Nano-Materials for Pollution Remediation 75
4.5 LAYERED NANO-PARTICLES
Layered nano-particles are onion or dumb shell-like formations (Benelmekki 2015). They comprise 
a versatile and considerable unexplored range of two-dimensional structures of novel electrical 
characteristics and increased surface areas that are critical in features such as signalling, catalysis, 
and storing energy. Layered hydroxides and carbon-based layered substances such as graphene and 
graphite are widely known layered substances. However, some other types of layered substances, 
such as transition dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and two-dimensional substances, for 
example, bismuth selenide, boron nitride, and bismuth telluride, have also been fabricated (Yaya et 
al. 2012). Exfoliation is considered to be the basic technique to develop layered nano-particles in 
which a single layer/sheet from a voluminous product are removed either physically or chemically 
(Le et al. 2020). To achieve their maximum efficiency, layered structures should be exfoliated. For 
instance, exfoliated Bi2Te3 surfaces can demonstrate improved thermoelectric performance by sup￾pressing thermal conductivity. Residual bulk conductance can be minimized by the process of the 
exfoliation of two-dimensional topological insulators such as Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3, illustrating the 
surface effects. Furthermore, as the number of layers is decreased, we can anticipate modifications 
in electrical features, for example, the implicit conduction band of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) 
bulk appears to be direct in some layers/sheets. Hexagonal boron nitride is yet another structured 
substance with a graphite-like arrangement consisting of hexagonal ring structures divided by 
3.33 Å wherein each boron atom is bound to 3 atoms of nitrogen, and vice-versa; the range between 
boron and nitrogen is 1.44 Å. Each boron atom associates with a nitrogen atom between the layers/
sheets via electrostatic interaction and van der Waal forces. Such adaptability allows these sub￾stances to be exceedingly functional for electrical uses (Yaya et al. 2012).
4.6 TYPES OF NANO-MATERIALS
Nano-particles have been employed in different fields such as the environmental, industrial, and 
biomedical domains. They are categorized into three groups:
(i) Incidental nano-particles (ii) Naturally occurring nano-particles and (iii) Crafted nano￾particles. Naturally occurring nanoparticles are usually present in soil and perform a 
significant part in various biogeochemical processes viz. clays, organic matter, and iron 
oxides. Incidental nano-particles reach the surroundings via air pollution, solid or liquid 
waste systems from nano-particle processing plants, farming activities, burning of fuels 
and weathering. Crafted nano-particles are developed with unique features and can be 
discharged into the air via various industrial activities. Zero valent metals (zero-valent 
iron (nZVI), quantum dots, dendrimers, and composite nano-particles are some signifi￾cant illustrations of engineered nano-particles, these have been found highly applicable in 
areas like remediation of different components of the environment (soil, water, sediment 
etc.); photovoltaics; telecommunications; drug carrier; sensors; cancer detection etc (U.S. 
EPA 2007, 2008).
4.7 DIMENSION-BASED NANO-PARTICLES
4.7.1 One-Dimensional Nano-Particles
Small films or surface coatings are usually substances with a single dimension on the nano-metre 
scale. Examples include nano-tubes, nano-fibres, nano-wires, nano-rods, and nano-filaments 
(Bashir and Liu 2015). Over the years, thin films have been designed and employed in several areas, 
namely, electronics, data storage systems, chemical and biological sensors, fibre-optic systems, and 76 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
magnetic and optical devices. They can be accumulated using multiple techniques and can be stably 
developed at the atomic stage (a monolayer) Benelmekki (2015).
4.7.2 Two-Dimensional Nano-Particles
These nano-particles possess two dimensions on the nano-metre scale viz., fibres, nano-films, 
nano-layers, nano-coatings, nano-wires, nano-tubes, fibrils, and dendrimers. Particles having a 
wide aspect proportion on the nano-metre scale are often called two-dimensional nano-particles. 
The features of two-dimensional nano-particles are less known, and their production capacities are 
also less developed (Benelmekki 2015).
4.7.3 Three-Dimensional Nano-Particles
Three-dimensional nano-particles are known to be particles that are at nano-scale in all three 
dimensions, for instance, quantum dots, nano-crystals, fullerenes, particles, precipitates, and col￾loids. Many three dimensional structures are widely recognized including natural nano-materials 
and combustion products, metal oxides, black carbon, titanium oxide, and zinc oxide. However, 
some pose major obstacles in terms of development and the interpretation of characteristics, such as 
dendrimers, fullerenes, and quantum dots Benelmekki (2015).
4.8 POLYMER-BASED NANO-MATERIALS
Even though the broad surface area and volume proportion of nano-materials lead to high reactivity 
with increased efficiency, at the same time, because of the paucity of usability, the phenomena of 
accumulation, non-specificity, and poor stability can restrict the usage of such nano-technologies 
(Guerra et al. 2018). The use of a host material, which acts as a medium or aid for other kinds of 
materials, is a substitute for improving the strength of nano-scale materials such as nano-particles 
(Zhao et al. 2011; Guerra et al. 2018). Polymers are predominantly used for the identification and 
elimination of residues such as organic contaminants (viz., aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, 
volatile organic carbons, pharmaceuticals, etc.), heavy metals (viz., manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), 
arsenic (Ar), and other heavy metals), harmful gases (viz., carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur diox￾ide (SO2), and nitrogen oxide (Nox)), and a diverse range of pathogens (viz., viruses, bacteria, and 
parasites). Polymer-specific hosts such as emulsifying agents, surface-functionalized ligands, and 
stabilizers are being used to improve the strength and durability, to resolve some disadvantages of 
immaculate nano-particles, and to provide other potential benefits, such as improving the compres￾sive performance, thermal stability, and reusability of the substance. For the cleanup of poly-nuclear 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from soils, amphiphilic polyurethane (APU) nano-particles have 
been produced, authenticating the concept that organic nano-particles can be developed with desir￾able characteristics (Tungittiplakorn et al. 2004; Guerra et al. 2018). The nano-particles hydrophilic 
surface facilitates movement in the soil, whereas affinity for hydrophobic pollutants is conferred 
by the hydrophobic interior of the substance. Almost eighty per cent recovery of phenanthrene 
has been reported from polluted aquifer sand by using amphiphilic polyurethane nano-particles 
(Tungittiplakorn et al. 2004; Guerra et al. 2018). Various formulations studied have revealed 
that as the size of the hydrophobic base increases, the tendency of amphiphilic polyurethane nano￾particles to interact with phenanthrene also increases. Some polymer-based nano-particles are used 
for the sensing and identification of pollutants, which is summarized in Table 4.1.
4.9 METAL OXIDE-BASED NANO-PARTICLES
Inorganic nano-particles are oxide-specific nano-particles that are typically made up of non-metals 
and metals. They comprise semiconductor crystals that are densely packed consisting of hundreds Non-Carbon Nano-Materials for Pollution Remediation 77
or thousands of atoms. These are widely used in the treatment of harmful wastewater pollutants 
(Das et al. 2015). Nano-materials have shown different behaviour in an aqueous environment, where 
some nano-particles demonstrated the positive potential for the remediation of water contamination. 
Some of the nano-materials comprise TiO2 (Gao et al. 2008; Anaya-Esparza et al. 2019), dendrimers

categorised with an elevated Brunauer—Emmett—Teller (BET) surface area, reduced solubility, low 
environmental effects, and zero secondary contaminants (Anjum et al. 2019). Some metal-specific 
nano-particles/materials and their environmental remediation uses are summarised in Table 4.2.
4.9.1 Iron-Specific Nano-Particles
The inherent presence of iron and its easy method of transformation make ferric oxide a cost￾effective material for toxic metal adsorption. It is an environmentally friendly commodity that can 
be used explicitly in a polluted area with a much lower probability of secondary pollution (Guerra et

al. 2018). Numerous iron-containing compounds, including iron sulphide, oxyhydroxide-containing 
iron, and alumino-silicate minerals, have been employed successfully in reducing and depositing 
metal ions. Among the iron-specific substances, the most effective for groundwater remediation has 
been observed to be elemental iron. Also with the development of nanotechnology, the use of bulk 
iron-specific methods for water decontamination has been substituted by iron-specific nano-particles. 
Various factors influence the adsorption of heavy metals on ferric oxide nano-particles viz., the incu￾bation period, adsorbent dose, temperature, and pH. Several studies have been carried out to enhance 
the surface adsorption capability of ferric oxides. For instance, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane has 
been used to alter the surface of ferric oxide nano-particles (Palimi et al. 2014). Furthermore, the 
alteration of such nano-adsorbents indicates a better tendency for the elimination from wastewater of 
toxic pollutants such as Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and As3+(Gupta et al. 2015).
4.9.2 Manganese Oxide-Specific Nano-Particles
Because of their large surface area (BET) and polymorphic nature, manganese oxide nano-particles 
exhibit higher adsorption power (Luo et al. 2010). Manganese oxide nano-particles have succeeded 
in eliminating a range of heavy metals such as arsenic from wastewater (Wang et al. 2011). Nano￾porous and nano-tunnel manganese oxides are among the significant examples of altered manga￾nese oxides. Adsorption on hydrous manganese oxide of different heavy metals such as divalent Pb, 
Cd, and Zn typically occurs due to the inner sphere-forming pathway that can be described by the 
principle of ion exchange (Zaman et al. 2009). Nevertheless, in two phases, the process of adsorp￾tion takes place in two stages, metal ions initially adsorb on the outer surface of hydrous manganese 
dioxides (HMOs), and then, intra-particle diffusion proceeds.
4.9.3 Zinc Oxide (ZnO)-Based Nano-Particles
Zinc oxide (ZnO) has permeable nano-structures for the adsorption of heavy metals with an elevated 
BET surface region. For instance, nano-adsorbents such as nano-assemblies, nano-plates, nano-sheet 
micro-spheres, and nano-rods are commonly employed for heavy metal remediation from waste￾water. Compared to the conventional zinc oxides, these altered types of nano-adsorbents display an 
excellent elimination capacity of heavy metals (Kumar et al. 2013). Nano-plates and permeable nano￾sheets have been employed to strip Cu (II) from wastewater. These altered nano-adsorbents display 
an elevated removal performance of divalent copper because of their unique nano-structures com￾pared to conventional zinc oxide. In addition, nano-assemblies are being employed to extract various 
forms of heavy metals, including divalent metals such as nickel, copper, cobalt, lead, mercury, and 
cadmium (Singh et al. 2013). Nano-assemblies (micro-porous) have a strong tendency for Pb2+, Hg2+, 
and As3+ adsorption due to their electropositive character (Gupta et al. 2015).
4.9.4 Magnesium Oxide (MgO)-Specific Nano-Particles
Magnesium oxide (MgO) is being employed to clean up waters contaminated with various heavy 
metals. The MgO micro-sphere is a unique design that can enhance the tendency of adsorption for 
heavy metal elimination (Gupta et al. 2015). Different types of alterations have been conducted in 
the structure of nano-particles to maximise the adsorption ability of MgO such as 3D units, nano￾cubes, nano-rods, nano-belts, and nano-wires (Zhu et al. 2001; Yin et al. 2002; Klug and Dravid 
2002; Mo et al. 2005; Engates and Shipley 2011; Guerra et al. 2018).
4.10 SILVER NANO-PARTICLES
Silver can be used to produce nanosized materials (Chou et al. 2005). The effective bactericidal 
activity of silver nano-particles against a broad variety of species (for instance, viruses, bacteria, Non-Carbon Nano-Materials for Pollution Remediation 79
fungi, etc.) has been established. Thus, they are also commonly employed for water disinfection. In 
proteins, silver (Ag+) ions interact with thiol groups that contribute to the inhibition of respiratory 
enzymes and the development of a species of reactive oxygen. These ions also prevent the replica￾tion of DNA and impact the cell membrane’s structure and permeability. Ag+ ions are ultraviolet 
active ions that lead to an increase in bacterial and viral ultraviolet (UV) inactivation. Numerous 
pathways for their anti-bacterial effects have been proposed to date. The binding of nano-particles 
to the surface modifies the characteristics of the membrane. To degrade lipo-polysaccharides, these 
particles have been observed to accumulate within the membrane by developing holes, resulting in 
increased membrane permeability. The bacterial cell can be penetrated by silver nano-particles, 
causing DNA damage. Anti-microbial Ag+ ions are released through the breakdown of silver nano￾particles, and bacterial strains such as P. aeruginosa and E. coli are sensitive to silver particles of 
a size less than 10 nm (Gogoi et al. 2006; Guerra et al. 2018). One to 10 nm silver nano-particles 
link with the glycoproteins of viruses, thus preventing them to bind with the host cells. Moreover, 
it has been observed that triangular-shaped nano-plates (nAg) are much more noxious than silver 
ions, rods (nAg), and spheres (nAg). Anti-bacterial effects against Salmonella entrica, S. aureus 
E. Coli, and A. niger have also been demonstrated by the integration of silver nano-particles into 
polymer products, including poly-methoxybenzyl and poly(L-lactic acid)-co-poly(3-caprolactone) 
nano-fibres (Nair et al. 2009; Jin et al. 2012).
4.11 ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION METHODS: ENVIRONMENTAL 
REMEDIATION THROUGH CHEMICAL DEGRADATION
Chemical degradation is among the most employed techniques for environmental remediation. This 
comprises (i) ozone, UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide oxidation, (ii) photo-catalytic degradation, 
(iii) super-critical water oxidation, (iv) the Fenton technique, (v) sonochemical degradation, (vi) 
the electrochemical method, (vii) the electron beam process, (viii) solvated electron reduction, (ix) 
permeable reactive barriers of iron and other zero-valent metals, and (x) enzymatic treatment tech￾niques. Some of these are discussed below.
Technologies relying on ozone or UV radiations are chemical oxidative processes relevant to 
treat water for the deterioration of specific contaminants or to reduce organic pollutants such as 
chemical oxygen demand; they can also be used to increase the bio-degradability of wastewater. 
Furthermore, they can be used for disinfection purposes. These methods commonly include photo￾lytic and oxidative processes to eradicate foreign material present in water. Accordingly, they can 
interact independently or photolyse the organic material in water.
Similarly, in conjunction with UV radiation, when ozone or hydrogen peroxide is employed, the 
contaminants may be deteriorated by in-situ hydroxyl-based free radicals via an oxidative reaction. 
Phenols and certain pesticides have been the most prevalent aquatic pollutants. Some materials 
interact easily, while organo-chlorine derivatives show low reactivity, with hydroxyl radicals. A 
further characteristic of these oxidative reactions is that, because of the reaction of the contami￾nants with hydroxyl free radicals, it is a damaging method of elimination of water/air contamination 
(Khin et al. 2012).
Photo-catalytic degradation comprises a catalyst and photons. Photo-catalytic reactions of nano￾particles are focused on the association of light energy and metal-specific nano-particles and are 
of keen importance to different contaminants because of their vast and strong photo-catalytic pro￾cesses. These nano-particles typically consist of semiconductor metals that can degrade various 
permanent organic contaminants including dyes, solvents, detergents, pesticides, and hazardous 
chemical/biological compounds. In addition, they are often incredibly efficient in particular circum￾stances for the deterioration of halogenated and non-halogenated compounds and toxic metals. They 
have minimal operating requirements and even at low quantities, are quite efficient. The basic pro￾cess of photo-catalysis is premised upon electron photoexcitation in the catalyst. Holes and excited 
electrons in the band gap are produced by photoluminescence (UV light in the context of TiO2). The 80 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
free radicals are produced due to the capturing of holes by molecules of water in an aquatic system. 
These radicals are potent oxidizers; they oxidize contaminants into water and gas and are deterio￾rated upon reaction. Because of its unique characteristics including being highly reactive in UV 
radiation and strength, titanium dioxide is by far the most commonly used photo-catalyst among the 
several nano-photo-catalysts produced so far. Likewise, because of their photo-catalytic behaviour, 
zinc oxides have been thoroughly investigated as they comprise a broad energy gap similar to that 
of titanium dioxide. Various studies have demonstrated the photo-catalytic behaviour of different 
synthetic photo-catalyses. The effectiveness relies on multiple parameters, for instance, the energy 
band, density, dosage, contaminant composition, and pH. Furthermore, cadmium sulphide nano￾particles have also been employed to treat industrial wastes such as dyes. These photo-catalysts are 
UV active catalysts because of the presence of broad energy bands. Therefore, more improvements 
are required to enhance their operation in visible radiance for organic contaminant deterioration 
(Beltran 2003; Khin et al. 2012).
4.12 APPLICATIONS OF NANO-PARTICLES FOR 
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION
Over recent years, a growing range of nano-particles with environmental implications has been cre￾ated. For instance, nano-particles are being employed to remediate polluted soil and groundwater 
at hazardous dumpsites, such as sites polluted by chlorinated solvents or chemical accidents. In dif￾ferent fields of science and technology, several types of nano-materials are used. Nano-particles are 
of great significance to environmental remediation, as compared to their size, the particle surface 
area is substantial. Consequently, their reactivity in chemical/biological surface-mediated reactions 
could increase compared to similar substances at larger volumes (Das et al. 2019). For particular 
purposes, they can be engineered to establish unique characteristics that rarely exist on a small 
or large scale in molecules of the same substance. Their high reactivity and prevalence of a greater 
number of reactive sites enhance the chance of their contact with the specific pollutants, thus reduc￾ing pollutant concentrations rapidly. In addition, nano-particles encompass extremely tiny areas due 
to their minute volume and reside suspended in groundwater if suitable coatings are applied.
Effective coatings permit particles to migrate farther than larger particles and attain broader 
dissemination, which enhances the elimination of pollutants. A few nano-technologies for environ￾mental remediation are still in the testing process, while others are advancing progressively from 
the experimental phase to the application phase. For instance, in approaching difficult sites, such 
as polluted areas (chlorinated solvents), some nano-materials retain the potential for environmental 
applications. Currently, research is being conducted to examine particles viz., TiO2, self-assem￾bled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SAMMSTM), dendrimers, metalloporphyrinogens, and 
swellable organically modified silica (SOMS). Moreover, further investigation is required to explain 
the environmental existence and distribution of unrestricted nano-particles, if they are permanent, 
if they have toxicity impacts on multiple biological processes, or whether the hypothetical advan￾tages of nano-particles can be achieved in widespread practical products. Moreover, nano-particles 
are already being explored to be used in the detection and control of environmental pollutants, but 
nano-sensor research and development are still on-going.
4.13 CONCLUSION
Nanotechnology has proved to be an effective tool for environmental pollution remediation in a 
sustainable manner and has the power to impart enhanced promising applications that have a sig￾nificant impact on the efficiency of the contaminant remediating substance. Extensive research is 
being performed for the development and advancement of such technologies for the conservation of 
environs from pollution.Non-Carbon Nano-Materials for Pollution Remediation 81

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Pollutants introduced into the environment cause adverse effects to both the environment and 
human beings. Pollutants may be harmful trash, poisonous gases, the smoke that has been released 
into the environment due to rapid industrialization, and man-made and some natural activities 
(Khin et al., 2012). Hazardous waste, heavy metals, chemical compounds (fertilizers, herbicides, 
and pesticides), oil spilling, noxious gases, manufacturing wastes, manure, and organic compos￾ites are a few instances of pollutants (Vaseashta et al., 2007; Khan and Ghoshal, 2000). Released 
pollutants are highly unstable and greatly complex, and they have low responsiveness. Hence, the 
dilapidation of these contaminants can stimulate the soil, water, and air (Khin et al., 2012; Mohan 
et al., 2021). Nanotechnology has increasingly been a focus because of the physical characteristics 
of nanomaterials, which can help to reduce contaminants from the environment and help to main￾tain environmental sustainability. Nanotechnology is the conversion of material with a biological, 
physical, and chemical procedure through methods with or without another component to manufac￾ture materials that have specific functionality, improved features, and distinct properties that can be 
applied in several areas (Goswami et al., 2012; Taghizadeh et al., 2013). Nanotech has implemented 
new nanomaterials (NMs) for the redressal of heavy metals, organic-inorganic compounds, and 
microorganisms from contaminated water (Kumar et al., 2017; Awual et al., 2015). Nanoparticles 
(NPs) that have dimensions from 1 to 100 nm show specific physical and chemical features com￾pared to macro-scale components (Li et al., 2001). These NPs have attracted numerous researchers 
because of their morphologic, physical, and chemical characteristics including their miniature mea￾surements, distribution, and unique configuration. They also have catalytic, magnetic, electronic, 
optical, and mechanical properties, which provide distinct ways for their development (Bardos 
et al., 2015). NMs have high reactivity and a specific surface that help to render them unique with 
better functionality, which makes them good adsorbents, catalysts, and sensors. The large surface 
area-to-mass ratio can considerably improve the adhesion potential of the components. These dif￾ferent characteristics can be employed for the degeneration of pollutants from the environment 
(Sánchez et al., 2011).
Nanoscience is the study of components and structures on a miniature scale with the broader 
and safer utilization of green chemistry. Remediation with NMs includes the overall degrada￾tion of pollutants that have been released in the environment from various sources (Bardos et al., 
2015). Nanotechnology can help to prevent, mitigate, and minimize the harm affecting individual 
well-being and the environment (Hood, 2004). Green chemistry is a growing research area that 
focuses on sustainable chemical strategies in the modern period of sustainable development goals 
(SDGs) (Matlin et al., 2015). Green chemistry principles can be employed to minimize the usage 
and production of harmful substances with the production of clean, safe, and enhanced NMs. The 
5Green-Synthesis of Nanomaterials for Environmental Remediation 85
principles of green chemistry are described in Figure 5.1 (Anastas and Warner, 1998a, 1998b). The 
utilization of the values of green chemistry in nanotechnology will help the production of greener 
and more sustainable NMs with improved efficiency. Green technology uses renewable substances 
to reduce waste and helps to maintain environmental sustainability (Anastas and Eghbali, 2010). 
Green technology is unquestionably the most significant area of nanotechnology, employing the 
12 green chemistry principles for numerous uses, and it produces sustainability and protects and 
advance occupational security and well-being throughout production and process utilization (Matos 
et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2010). Green synthesis is a process of synthesizing NPs by maintaining 
the sustainability of the environment and minimizing its hazards (Fleischer and Grunwald, 2008). 
Green synthesis principles that are practised to synthesize NPs has been found to be highly assuring. 
Green chemistry is directing sustainable chemical strategies towards accomplishing the SDGs. It is 
an ecologically sound technique of generating substances that are less damaging due to the use of 
biodegradable reactants. Such a green strategy for the production of NMs is discovered to decrease 
the significant dangers regarding pollutants. Green technology is a merging of nanotechnology with 
green chemistry that showcases the purposes of producing eco-friendly NMs and determining their 
applicability to reducing environmental contaminants (Matlin et al., 2015). Integrated NPs create a 
limited harmful consequence on the soil, water, air, and individual wellness compared with those 
formed by chemical methods. (Anthony et al., 2013). The approach has environmental advantages, 
such as nanocatalysts for remediation, thermoelectric substances, low-weight nanocomposite sub￾stances, and small gadgets to decrease the utilization of material (Liang and Guo, 2009). This chap￾ter focuses on the greener routes of production of various metallic, carbon-based, and polymeric 
NPs with various natural sources and their use in the depletion of environmental pollutants.
5.2 APPROACHES OF NP SYNTHESIS
Conventional ways are still utilized, but it has been demonstrated that green approaches in the 
production of NPs have the added benefits of fewer odds of disappointment, a low price, and an 
affluence of description (Zhang et al., 2016). To obtain NMs of the required dimensions, form, 
and capabilities, there are two main methods to manufacture them, namely, the 1) top-down and 2) 
bottom-up approaches. In the top-down approach, the appropriate majority substance is fragmented 
FIGURE 5.1 Twelve general principles of green chemistry.86 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
into tiny elements by dimension reduction comprising lithographic methods, sputtering, etching, 
and grinding in a ball mill. In contrast, in the bottom-up method, NPs are produced by utilizing bio￾chemical and organic approaches through a flat pack of atoms to new nuclei, which rise in nanosized 
elements. The bottom-up approach involves biochemical decrease, electrochemical approaches, 
and sono-decomposition. Bottom-up methods comprise rising NPs from simple units, specifically, 
reaction predecessors. They regulate the dimension and form of NPs that utilize target predeces￾sors’ attention, reaction conditions (temperature and pH), and functionalization of external models 
(Virkutyte and Varma, 2013; Mathur et al., 2017). The creation of NPs through traditional chemical 
and physical methods creates a lethal secondary product that causes ecological threats. Traditional 
methods can be utilized to produce NPs in greater amounts with limited dimensions and figures 
in a smaller period; however, such approaches are complex, expensive, ineffective, and out-of-date. 
Currently, there has been increasing consideration in making ecologically approachable NPs that 
do not create deadly leftover materials during the procedure (Parashar et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011). 
Old-style approaches are still utilized, but researchers have demonstrated that green approaches are 
highly effective concerning the production of NPs with the benefits of lesser probabilities of disas￾ter, an economical price, and ease of description (Abdelghany et al., 2018). Chemical and physical 
methods of producing NPs have modeled numerous pressures on the atmosphere because of their 
lethal metabolites. The production of NPs with green approaches can be easily accomplished, and 
they are also economical. In light of their excellent characteristics, green-produced NPs are pres￾ently favoured over conventionally created NPs (Hussain et al., 2016).
Overcoming the limitation of this new age of green producing approaches is receiving great 
focus in the recent R&D on resource technology and science. Fundamentally, the green produc￾tion of NMs generated by control, clean up, regulation, and remedial procedures will no doubt 
help their ecological sociability (Singh et al., 2018). The biogenesis method involves the maximum 
number of green chemistry principles by utilizing biologically approachable, harmless, and safe 
substances and making it profitable, with little upkeep, and an effortless increase in the large-scale 
generation of NPs, in contrast to the biochemical methods that employ greater radiation and highly 
concentrated reductants and stabilizing agents that damage the atmosphere and social well-being 
(Narayanan and Sakthivel, 2011; Kharissova et al., 2013). A few fundamental principles of green 
production can thus be described by numerous aspects such as the inhibition of waste, a decrease 
of byproducts/contamination, the usage of non-toxic mixtures/aides, and inexhaustible raw mate￾rial. The green environmental methods in chemistry and biochemicals are gradually becoming well 
known and necessary because of global complications related to ecological worries (Ahmed et al., 
2016). Green production procedures grounded in biological predecessors rely on varied reaction 
agents including temperature, solvents, pressure, and the pH environment (basic, acidic, or neutral) 
(Doble et al., 2010). A biotic-dependent generation of NPs employs a bottom-up approach in which 
arrangements transpire with the assistance of stabilizing and reducing agents. Three significant 
stages in the production of NPs from a chemistry viewpoint consist of a safer solvent phase, a 
non-lethal reducing agent, and ecologically gentle stabilizing factors. Another important agent is 
the choice of the covering materials utilized to passivate the surface of the NP. The capping agent 
demonstrates an important impact on the geomorphologies, subjected implementations, and size 
ranges (Mohanpuria et al., 2008; Raveendran et al., 2003; Annu and Ahmed, 2018). Newer stud￾ies have showcased the production, application, and characterization of NMs. Accordingly, eco￾friendly resolutions are acquiring acknowledgement in the modern world (Machado et al., 2013; 
Huang et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2016).
5.3 GREEN SYNTHESIS OF VARIOUS NMS
5.3.1 Metal and Metal Oxide NMs
For environmental remediation, the most widely studied inorganic NMs are especially metal NMs 
and metal oxides NMs, which include silver, iron, gold, iron oxide, and titanium oxide. Metal NPs Green-Synthesis of Nanomaterials for Environmental Remediation 87
(MNPs) have shown more immeasurable catalytic properties than bulk compounds. The individual 
characteristics of MNPs depend on their appearance, size, crystalline structure, and composition 
(Selvan et al., 2003). Metals and metal oxide NMs have a higher functionality and lower cost for 
the elimination of pollutants; hence, inorganic NMs have interested researchers (Saravanan et al., 
2011) in numerous areas such as biomedicine, sensors, catalysis, fuel cells, and magnetic data stor￾age (Wu et al., 2016).
5.3.1.1 Biological Components
Recently, significant research has been carried out on biological systems involving bacteria, fungi, 
yeasts, and plants, and this has directed the transformation of inorganic metal ions into metal NPs 
(Devatha et al., 2018). For NM synthesis with the green approach, compounds from the biological 
system can act as a reducing and capping agent. Enzymes, polysaccharides, vitamins, and amino 
acids from natural entities help degrade metallic ions (Sahayaraj and Rajesh, 2001). For the green 
production of metal and metal oxide NPs, plants are considered because plants have active phy￾tochemicals, particularly in the leaves, such as ketones, aldehydes, flavones, amides, terpenoids, 
carboxylic acids, phenols, and ascorbic acids. These phytochemicals act as reducing agents that 
help transform the metal salts into metal NPs (Doble et al., 2010). Plant biodiversity has attracted 
high attention because of its biodegradability and availability. Metal oxide NPs have also been 
integrated with a green approach with plant parts and microorganism-based components (Annu 
and Ahmed, 2018). Bacteria can decrease metallic ions and are possible mortals in manufacturing 
NPs (Iravani, 2014). Similar to the bacteria and microorganism-mediated method, fungi-mediated 
synthesis is also highly effective in generating monodispersed inorganic NPs. With this method, 
several intracellular enzymes act as more active biological agents to generate NMs (Chen et al., 
2009; Mohanpuria et al., 2008).
5.3.1.2 Metal and Metal Oxide NMs for Environmental Remediation
Metals have been used for thousands of years as antimicrobial agents. Although the antimicrobial 
properties of metal have been used for various purposes in the past, their application in the medici￾nal field decreased after the development of antibiotics in 1920. Egyptians initially reported the 
application of copper as an adstringent. Indians, Egyptians, Persian kings, Phoenicians, Greeks, and 
Romans also utilized copper and silver for food preservation and water disinfection. Silver has also 
been utilized as suture and infection remedies (Gold et al., 2018).
FIGURE 5.2 Biological sources for the green synthesis of NPs.88 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
Metal oxides are a class of chemical composites with a varied structure and allied characteris￾tics. These properties are a crystal structure, thermodynamic endurance, morphology, connected 
electronic arrangement, and electric conductivity (Pal, 2020). There has been a remarkable increase 
in the improvement and manufacture of NMs in recent years with a wide extent of uses, from 
antimicrobials and drug transporters to next-generation computer chips and superior substances, 
to name but a few. Determined yearly global generation quantities for normal NMs, such as zinc 
oxide (ZnO), copper (Cu), Ag, titanium dioxide (TiO2), and iron (Fe), were recorded to be 34,000, 
200, 450, 88,000, and 42,000 tons, respectively, as of 2013 (Zhang et al., 2019). NMs as antibacte￾rial factors are not only reliant on material chemistry but also strongly connected to their physical 
characteristics, such as their shape, size, solubility, agglomeration, and surface charge. For example, 
the morphology of NPs has been established to perform a role in the antiseptic activity of NPs 
(Morones et al., 2005).
Green production of Fe NPs is the procedure in which plant excerpts, microorganisms such 
as fungi, yeast, algae, and bacteria, and an enzyme play an important part in the production of a 
natural decomposable substance. Amongst such methods, production with plant extract is beneficial 
as it reduces the danger of additional pollution by preserving the cell assembly and lessening the 
response time (Ajitha et al., 2015). Fe is easily available, and its magnetic nature has attracted the 
production of NPs that have a great opportunity in ecological usage. Fe NPs show great dimensional 
constancy and harmlessness and lean towards producing oxides. Separately from having a greater 
surface range and thermal and electrical conduction, Fe NPs also possess magnetic characteristics 
and are called magnetic NPs (Arabi et al., 2016). Spherical Fe NPs were produced by a facile one￾step green procedure utilizing Eucalyptus extract for the treatment of eutrophic wastewater (Wang 
et al., 2014), and it was described that 30% of complete phosphorus, 72% of complete nitrogen, and 
85% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were eliminated by the generated NPs. Thus, NPs might 
play a significant role in the remediation of wastewater. Fe NPs—trimetallic, bimetallic, metallic, 
and oxides—have been extensively described as hopeful mediators for ecological remedy (Sharma 
et al., 2018). There are 16 identified Fe oxides (Wu et al., 2015). They hold antimicrobic character￾istics and have been utilized to decompose colourants (by an absorption procedure) (Sharma et al., 
2017), treat wastewater (Fazlzadeh et al., 2018), and eliminate metal pollutants and other substances 
(Mondal and Purkait, 2018) through ecological methods. The rise of Fe NPs as a remedial process 
is because of their magnetic vulnerability, harmlessness, and dual oxidation-reduction ability upon 
reaction with water. Furthermore, they have a greater surface area and reaction rate. Fe NPs are 
widely reported for eliminating various heavy metals such as Ni2+, Co2+ (Hooshyar et al., 2013; 
Ebrahim et al., 2016), Cu2+ (Poguberovic et al., 2016), and Cd2+ (Ebrahim et al., 2016), along with 
the remediation of chlorinated organic solvents (Guo et al., 2017; Han et al., 2016). Fe oxide NPs 
FIGURE 5.3 Bio-based method for the production of NPs.Green-Synthesis of Nanomaterials for Environmental Remediation 89
have been broadly researched for wastewater remediation, air purification, self-purgation of sur￾faces, and as photocatalysts in wastewater remedy utilization because of their characterized cheap 
price and non-toxic, photocatalytic, semiconducting, gas sensing, energy converting, and electronic 
properties (Adesina, 2004; Li et al., 2008). Sankar et al. (2014) also described the probability of 
carboxyl, nitro, and amide groups from an Azadirachta indica leaf excerpt to produce TiO2 NPs of 
an average size of 124 nm with a spherical form. Moreover, they studied NPs as an active photo￾catalyst for the treatment of contamination. TiO2 NPs are adaptable; they can be used as reductive 
and oxidative catalysts for inorganic and organic contaminants (Hernández-Alonso et al., 2009; 
Nakata and Fujishima, 2012). Rajakumara et al. (2012) discussed the production of TiO2 NPs that 
have dimensions of 2–74 nm and an oval or spherical shape through Aspergillus flavus as a cap￾ping and reducing agent. The resultant NPs are an antimicrobic natural counter to Klebsiella pneu￾moniae, B. subtilis, Streptomyces aureus, and E. coli. Rice straw as a lignocellulosic waste material 
has been used for the production of TiO2 NPs by a sol-gel process (Ramimoghadam et al., 2014).
TiO2 NPs have been widely used in various fields including photo-catalysis (Fujishima et al., 
2000), sensors (Bai and Zhou, 2014), and antimicrobial agents (Kubacka et al., 2014). Semiconductor 
NMs such as TiO2 and ZnO NPs that have a broad gap of 3.2 eV are generally studied because of 
their higher photocatalyst activity. They are utilized not only for the dilapidation of organic pol￾lutants in air and water (Armon et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2005) but also for the application of 
antimicrobic factors (Pathakoti et al., 2014). Ag NPs are commonly recognized for their noteworthy 
antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal actions and are thus used as wastewater decontaminators 
(Chou et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 1998; Bosetti et al., 2002). The usage of the yeast R. mucilaginosa
to, through bioremediation, remove Cu-consisting wastewater is common through the production of 
Cu NPs (Salvadori et al., 2014). The Cu oxide (CuO) nanostructure was implied for the absorption 
of Pb (II) and organic dyes from aqueous solution (Farghali et al., 2013; Mustafa et al., 2013). CuO 
NPs have the possibility to adsorb both heavy metal ions and organic dyes. Moreover, the usage of 
gold and silver metallic NPs has been observed in ecological purification (Sundarajan et al., 2013).
5.3.1.3 Characterization of NPs
After the biosynthesis of NMs, there is a need to describe NMs with characterization techniques. 
This includes ultraviolet (UV)—Vis absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier energy dis￾persive X-ray analysis (EDAX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM). Characterization deals with measurements of the physical and chemical char￾acteristics of NPs. Conformational features about the appearance, size, uniformity, dispersion state, 
and surface properties are determined with different techniques.

et al., 2010)90 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
5.3.2 Carbon-Based NMs
Carbon-based NMs are better than conventional materials as they have a better surface area. 
Moreover, they are good adsorbents because of their individual electronic and structural charac￾teristics (Lianchao et al., 2006). The composition of carbon-based NMs and their various hybrid￾ization states is because of the physical, chemical, and electronic capabilities that are unique to 
carbon-based NMs (Ren et al., 2011). As nanotechnology is evolving, various types of carbon- and 
metal-based NMs have evolved. Some examples include NMs that have applications in water purifi￾cation, for example, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and graphene oxides (Perreault et al., 
2015). Most of the properties of these materials are dependent on their size. Carbon-based NMs are 
preferred to decontaminate the environment because
(1) They can inculcate various pollutants,
(2) They have an immediate reaction rate,
(3) They have an enhanced surface area of absorption, and
(4) They have an affinity for absorbing aromatic substances (Bosso and Enzweiler, 2002).
As these carbon-based NMs and their variants have a better surface area, flexible properties, abil￾ity to decontaminate foreign microbes, and efficient physio-chemical properties and because they 
are good decontaminators of pollutants, they have extensive applications in water purification 
(Smith and Rodrigues, 2015). Examples include C60, C540, nanotubes, and graphene (Mauter and 
Elimelech, 2008). Small nanoscale carbon NMs have high adsorption capabilities as they have 
micropores on their internal topology, which is accessible to humic acid, whereas larger carbon 
black-based NMs fail at this capability (Hochella, 2002). These carbon-based NMs also have pho￾tocatalytic techniques, and when these materials are radiated with UV light, the quanta greater or 
equal to the bandgap create band holes and electrons from the conductive bands. Hydroxyl radi￾cles are formed because of these holes that participate in the oxidation of chlorinated compounds 
through these reactions; superoxide intermediates are formed that contribute to the decontamina￾tion of heavy metals. Graphene has been reported in different studies to be used for photocatalytic 
activity (Yang et al., 2013). TiO2 NPs in graphene have a better photocatalytic effect due to their 
enhanced conductive properties (Zhang et al., 2010).
5.3.3 NMs Based on Silica
Silica has been very popular in nanosciences due to its dynamic applications such as catalysis and 
adsorption. Silica materials have great importance in environmental decontamination because of 
their large surface area, flexible pore sizes, and better pore volumes, which makes them an effective 
material against environmental decontamination (Tsai et al., 2016).

5.3.4 NMs Based on Polymers
NMs have an improved surface area, and because of this, they have enhanced performance, improved 
reactivity, and a nonspecific nature, but with these properties, the overall functionality of the NM 
reduces significantly, as it becomes unstable. To overcome this limitation and improve the stability ratio 
of the NM, host materials are preferred as they act as a matrix for other materials (Zhao et al., 
2011). Examples include amphiphilic polyurethane-based NMs that are used to remove polynuclear 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from earthly materials such as soils (Tungittiplakorn et al., 2004). 
5.4 APPLICATION OF GREEN NANOTECHNOLOGY 
IN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION
In the 21st century, the major focus of researchers has been on nanotechnology to improve the 
environment (green nanotechnology), and considerable studies and development are focused on 
this evolving area. These NMs are preferred more than metal-based NMs. In addition, green NMs 
have found their utility, specifically in the pharmaceutical sector. These NMs have also been 
extensively used in testing (in-vitro), clinical utilities, and even in medicines (Gunalan et al., 2012). 
NMs synthesized for decontamination have been proven to possess antibacterial effects (Mahdavi 
et al., 2013). They can destroy the bacteria by causing damage to its cell covering, which produces 
free radicles and inflicts oxidative damage on DNA (Chaloupka et al., 2010). These materials 
have therefore been essential for environmental decontamination (Njagi et al., 2011). Furthermore, 
green NMs are used as eco-friendly fertilizers that enhance crop production and have replaced 
pesticides in pest control and prevention (Kottegoda et al., 2011). They also have a broad scale 
of applicability in the treatment and decontamination of water from toxic biological and physical 
agents (Dhandapani et al., 2012).
5.5 CONCLUSION
Today, environmental contamination is one of the prime problems of the world, and there is a great 
necessity to maintain its sustainability. To overcome this problem, nanoscience plays a crucial role 
in environmental bioremediation. Progress in nanotechnology and green chemistry offers a simple, 
reproducible, and cost-effective method for synthesizing various NPs. Unique characteristics of NPs 
and the eco-friendly approach of their synthesis make them efficient and effective over the NPs that 
are synthesized with a chemical approach or commercially existing NPs. Considering the research, 
NPs, such as metal and metal oxide NPs, carbon-based, silica-based, and polymeric NPs synthe￾sized from biological agents, plants, or microbial agents, play a significant role in environmental 
remediation. Metallic, carbonaceous, and silica-based NMs synthesized with principles of green 
chemistry have gained attention for their ability to eliminate contaminants from the soil, water, and 
air because of their excellent characteristics and applications, some of which are discussed in this 
chapter. This might help researchers to develop an advanced method for synthesising NPs with a

Comparison between 
Traditional and 
Nanoremediation 
Technology with a Special 
Reference to Soil and Heavy 
Metal Contamination
J. Immanuel Suresh and A. Judith 
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Soil is found to be differentiated in the horizon of minerals and organic constituents that usually dif￾fers in physical properties, chemical properties, composition and biological characteristics from the 
parent material. It is composed of many elements such as mineral particles, humus, soil atmosphere, 
soil water and soil microorganisms. Therefore, soil plays a major role in maintaining a balanced 
environment. The life of many plants, animals, humans and microbes are dependent on soil. Soil 
performs essential functions that include regulating water, sustaining plant and animal life, filtering 
and buffering potential pollutants, cycling nutrients and providing physical stability and support. 
It contains both dynamic and inherent qualities. Thus, healthy soil provides access to clean air and 
water, healthy food crops, diverse wildlife and beautiful landscapes. Soil as the “universal sink” 
suffers heavily from the release and accumulation of toxic contaminants. Moreover, soil quality is 
being contaminated in various ways that includes the discharge of industrial waste, pesticides, heavy 
metals, organic waste and agricultural chemicals into soil. Soil contamination can be regarded as the 
accumulation of toxic compounds, radioactive elements and salts that result in adverse effects on 
plants and animals (Okrent, 1999).
Developing countries with industrialized economies are seriously affected by soil contamina￾tion due to heavy metals. Heavy metals accumulated in the soil are taken up by plants. Since plants 
serve as a major source of food for many living beings, including humans, heavy metals tend to get 
transported through the food chain, causing a major threat to human and animal health (Mohamed 
et al., 2010). A study undertaken on soil contamination by heavy metals in India revealed that the 
soil is significantly contaminated and shows higher levels of toxic elements. Some common heavy 
metals found in soil are cadmium, cobalt, chromium and copper. Heavy metals are also found in soil 
that is not contaminated by industrial effluents due to the weathering from their parent materials. 
They originate from mining, the combustion of fuels, industrial waste and agricultural chemicals. 
These heavy metals can lead to reduced soil fertility, ecological imbalance, increased salinity and 
health disorders.
698 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
6.2 HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION
In industrial areas, not only industrial pollutants, including carbon monoxide, chlorofluorocar￾bons and various heavy metals such as arsenic, lead and cadmium, but also hydrocarbons are 
released into the air. Nitrogen and sulfur-dioxide contaminants in the air result in acid rain, 
which ultimately pollutes the water and soil. Industrial effluents and sewage content released 
into water bodies also tend to settle in river beds, resulting in water and soil pollution. The 
range of toxicity or the toxic level differs based upon the various contaminants. Sometimes, 
even a minute quantity of a contaminant can cause a major threat (for example, arsenic exhibits 
toxicity when present at 10 ppm in soil). Heavy metal contamination occurs through various 
sources. Batteries are a major source of the generation of lead, nickel and cadmium contamina￾tion. Fertilizers, pesticides, paint, timber treatment, dyes and fumigants release heavy metal 
contaminants including cadmium, arsenic, chromium, copper, manganese, zinc, mercury, nickel 
and molybdenum (Malik and Biswasa, 2012).
Usually, contaminants are present in mixtures; therefore, it becomes ideal to develop vari￾ous techniques that favor the reduction, identification, quantification and treatment of haz￾ardous environmental contaminants present in mixtures (Filipponi and Sutherland, 2010). 
Even though traditional methods are widely in use, due to increasing challenges, the field of 
nanotechnology is being exploited for environment remediation. The distinguishing properties 
of nanoparticles can serve as a promising approach in achieving a safer environment through 
nanoremediation.
6.3 CONTAMINATED SITE ASSESSMENT
It is very important to assess a contaminated site before beginning the remediation process. 
Through assessment, the concentration and spatial distribution of harmful pollutants can be 
determined. An environmental and human health risk assessment is conducted by identifying 
the source, type and physical form of the contaminants, the extent of contamination and the 
potential receptors of contamination. The extent of site remediation must be determined. The 
various factors that influence the risk assessment are toxicity, reactivity, corrosivity and ignit￾ability (U.S. EPA, 1989; Asante-Duah, 1996). These will be useful in choosing the method of 
remediation. The various data required for planning contaminated site remediation are as fol￾lows: site history and land use pattern, geologic and hydrologic properties (pH, ionic strength, 
dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and 
sulfate), geotechnical information, the source and extent of contamination and hazard assess￾ment and zoning.
6.4 TREATMENT OF HEAVY METAL-CONTAMINATED SOIL
Environmental remediation is the process of removing toxic pollutants from the soil, air 
and water to protect the environment and the living organisms that rely on it. The process 
of remediation is chosen after assessing the contaminated site and determining the human 
health and ecological risks. Based upon the intensity of contamination and other assessment 
results, the method of remediation is determined. The various approaches used for remediation 
can be broadly classified into physical remediation, chemical remediation, bioremediation and 
nanoremediation.Comparison of Traditional and Nanoremediation Technology 99
6.4.1 Traditional Methods of Soil Remediation
6.4.1.1 Soil Isolation and Containment
This remediation method includes barriers and hydraulic containment. In this method, barriers 
are installed, and the contaminated soil is capped (Figure 6.1) and contained within the barriers. 
The barrier walls otherwise regarded as slurry walls are made up of impermeable materials such 
as grout, cement, clay, bentonite and steel (Mulligan et al., 2001). These materials can be used 
for horizontal or vertical containment. This method is useful for heavy metal-contaminated soil. 
Capping the contaminated soil within impermeable barriers can prevent the contaminated ground￾water from spreading to nearby water bodies. A vertical wall prevents the mixing of contaminated 
soil with uncontaminated water, whereas a horizontal wall restricts the downward movement of 
metal contaminants. Hydraulic containment is often preferred for groundwater contamination. It is 
not a direct remediation process but can widely be used to restrict the movement of hazardous heavy 
metals towards groundwater (ICS, 2005; Jankaite and Vasarevičius, 2005).
6.4.1.2 Solidification and Stabilization
The mobility of metal contaminants is reduced with the help of binders and additives in the solidi￾fication and stabilization method. It is suitable for highly toxic pollutants. The immobilized toxic 
contaminants do not have any spatial or temporal effect. Commonly used binders include cement, 
fly ask and zeolites; for soil contaminated with organic pollutants, polyethylene epoxy and resins 
(organic binders) are used (ICS, 2005). This method can be performed in a single step or in two 
steps. In the single-step process, to fix and render the polluted soil insoluble, it is mixed with a spe￾cial binder. Meanwhile, in the two-step process, the polluted soil is made insoluble and non-reactive 100 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
in the first step, and later, in the second step, it is solidified. In the event of solidification, the con￾taminated soil is primarily mixed with physical binding agents (cement, bitumen, thermoplastic 
binders, etc.), resulting in a crystalline glassy or polymeric mass. During stabilization, chemical 
reactions are initiated between the stabilizing agent and metal contaminant (Figure 6.2). This fur￾ther promotes the binding of contaminants to substrate thereby making it less mobile. Stabilization 
yields a chemically stable compound that can be removed later from the contaminated environment 
(Jankaite and Vasarevičius, 2005).
6.4.1.3 Vitrification
This method is a solidification and stabilization method that requires thermal energy. In this 
method, graphite electrodes are inserted with appropriate space in between and are energized with 
high resistance electrical heating to heat the contaminated soil at a high temperature, thereby melt￾ing it (Dada et al., 2015). The metals are immobilized by the glassy solid formed after cooling. 
These immobilized metals can then be taken out of the region under remediation when desired. 
It is highly applicable for polluted areas that have a shallow depth and for treating a large volume 
(Mulligan et al., 2001).

FIGURE 6.1 Soil isolation and containment.Comparison of Traditional and Nanoremediation Technology 101
6.4.1.4 Soil Flushing
This method involves flushing the soil with water or any other suitable washing solution. Organic 
and oil contaminants such as phenol are eliminated by adding acids, bases and surfactants to 
water that are used as extraction or flushing solutions to recover metals (ICS, 2005; Jankaite and 
Vasarevičius, 2005). Surface flooding, sprinklers, surface trenches, horizontal drains or vertical 
drains are used to directly inject or infiltrate the soil with the flushing solution. The contaminants 
react with the flushing solution and become mobilized by wither solubilization and by the formation 
of an emulsion or chemical reaction between them. This process further dissolves the contaminants 
in the solution used for flushing and leaches them into groundwater. The contaminant containing 
water and the flushing solution are collected with the help of wells or trenches that are placed stra￾tegically for further treatment and reuse (Dada et al., 2015).
6.4.1.5 Electrokinetics/Electroreclamation
This method utilizes electrical principles to decontaminate particular sites. This method is suit￾able for granular and clay types of soil, especially where the groundwater flow rate is low, to 
remove uranium, mercury and other heavy metals. In this technology, two metal/ceramic elec￾trodes are inserted into the soil. The two electrodes act as a cathode and anode and are posi￾tioned on each side (array) of the contaminated soil; meanwhile, its pH is maintained using buffer 
solutions. Electronic conduction, along with the charge transfer between electrodes and solids in 
the soil, occurs upon the establishment of an electric field (a low intensity direct current) across 
the electrodes. When the electric current is applied, it results in electro-migration (movement of 
charged chemicals), electroosmosis (movement of fluid), electrophoresis (movement of charged 
particles) and electrolysis (chemical reactions due to an electric field) (Rodsand and Acar, 2000; 
Mulligan et al., 2001). This leads to the movement of contaminants from one electrode to another 
based upon their charges.
Occasionally, the process of movement is facilitated by the use of surfactants and complexing 
agents. The contaminants are deposited at the electrodes. They are then recovered by electroplating, 
precipitation, adsorption, complexing with ion exchange resins or the pumping of water or any other 
fluid near the electrodes by using ion exchange resistance.
Advantages
• Remediation takes place between the electrodes. Hence, the process is target specific.
• Metal contaminants are moved as they carry a charge. Induced flow moves the non￾charged contaminants.
• It can be used as both in-situ and ex-situ methods.
• It can be tailored to site-specific conditions.
Disadvantages
• It is a time-consuming process.
• The current flow may get diverted.
• The electrolysis reaction may change the soil pH.
• A change in pH may have an adverse effect upon the microbial wealth of the soil.
6.4.1.6 Soil Vapor Extraction
This technique is also known as soil venting or vacuum extraction. It is used for remediating unsatu￾rated soils contaminated with diversified contaminants by installing either vertical or horizontal 
wells in the contaminated zone (Zhan and Park, 2002). The evaporation is facilitated by air blowers. 
The vacuums through the wells evaporate the volatile substances of the contaminated mass. They 
are further withdrawn using an extraction well. The vapors are then treated and released into the 
atmosphere.102 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
6.4.1.7 Soil Washing
This method involves the use of water in combination with solvents and mechanical processes to 
scrub the soil. Depending upon the nature of the contaminant, the solvents are selected (Chu and 
Chan, 2003). Pollutants such as hydrocarbon are usually found to be bound with clay and fine soil; 
therefore, in the soil washing process, clay (fine soil) is separated from sand and gravel (coarse soil). 
This process reduces the volume of polluted soil (Urum et al., 2003; Riser-Roberts, 1998). The pol￾luted fine soil is isolated and subjected to other treatment methods.
Advantages
• It is cost effective.
• When performed under ideal conditions, it can reduce about 90% of the originally con￾taminated soil (Sharma and Reddy, 2004).
• It is performed on-site. Therefore, the treated soil can be reused as backfill at the site.
• It is performed in a closed system where the pH and other factors involved in remediation 
can be easily monitored.
Disadvantages
• It requires a large area to set up the system.
• It is predominantly effective with coarse soil, and at a clay site, this technique will not 
work well.
• It is ineffective for soil containing more than 30 to 50% silt.
6.4.1.8 Land Farming
Land farming, an above-ground remediation technology, reduces the concentration of pollutants 
such as petroleum present in soil. Land farming is performed in association with bioremediation. 
Over the ground surface of the treatment site, the excavated contaminated soil is spread out as a thin 
layer. Later, the contaminated soil is subjected to bioremediation by stimulating aerobic microbial 
activity (Hejazi et al., 2003).
Advantages
• It requires low capital input.
• It has a simple design and is easy to implement.
• It is energy efficient, and even a large volume of soil can be treated.
Disadvantages
• Only biodegradable elements can be efficiently eliminated.
• A large area is needed for treatment.
6.4.1.9 Bioremediation
The organic pollutants in soil are biologically treated in the process of bioremediation. It can be 
in situ (treatment of contaminated soil at the site) or ex situ (excavation of contaminated soil and 
treatment at some other place). This method involves the use of natural or genetically engineered 
microorganisms (Vidali, 2001) and plants. Bioremediation is a natural process and usually occurs 
on its own as nature’s repair mechanism. It tends to metabolize organic chemical compounds and 
degrade them via reactions such as microbial degradation, hydrolysis and redox reactions (Dada 
et al., 2015). Bioremediation can be classified into microbial bioremediation and phytoremediation 
(Gupta et al., 2003).
Microbial remediation involves the use of a highly diverse microbial community (Giller et al., 
1998) to degrade the organic contaminants into less toxic substances (Garbisu and Alkorta, 2003). Comparison of Traditional and Nanoremediation Technology 103
Solvents, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides are some organic pollutants (Adeniji, 2004). 
Depending on the contaminant present at the site, specific microorganisms can be used to enhance 
the remediation process. Microorganisms used in the process of bioremediation are known as bio￾remediators. Various microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, fungi and actinomycetes facilitate 
bioremediation. Since the contaminants present in the soil are generally present in the mixture, a 
combination of microorganisms can be used for efficient treatment as it shows synergistic inter￾actions. Bacteria, for example, Pseudomonas, Modococci and Streptomyces, can be used for the 
removal of hydrocarbon contaminants from soil (Thapa et al., 2012).
There is limited evidence on the bioremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil using 
microbes (Sinha et al., 2010). However, some metal-tolerant bacteria carry out various mecha￾nisms to survive, resist and cope with heavy metal-contaminated soil. The mechanisms used by 
several microbes are as follows: a few microorganisms tend to bind the metals to proteins or extra￾cellular polymers; some even compartmentalize the metals within the cells; they form insoluble 
metal sulphides; they reduce heavy metals by synthesizing complex enzymes in a process known 
as enzyme reduction; and a few others produce metal chelators (Giller et al., 1998; Sinha et al., 
2010) to resist and cope with heavy metals. Pseudomonas are known to reduce chromium toxicity, 
and Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Citrobacteia are some of the commonly used 
bacteria for soil remediation. Bioremediation using microorganisms is performed through two 
mechanisms: bioaugmentation and biostimulation (Adeniji, 2004; Garbisu and Alkorta, 2003). 
While using microorganisms for remediation, the complexation and competition effects on the 
site have to be assessed. A study using the metal-resistant bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans
revealed that the accumulation of cadmium was affected by competition with calcium, mag￾nesium and zinc. The accumulation of lead was influenced by complexation with humic acids. 
Therefore, the assessment of chemical site specificity is very important (Hajdu and Slaveykova, 
2012; Dhal et al., 2013).
Mycoremediation involves fungi mycelia and mushrooms for remediating contaminants, includ￾ing heavy metals. The mycelium performs decomposition by secreting several enzymes and acids 
that degrade organic pollutants. Mushrooms possess an effective mechanism that enables them to 
readily take up metals from the ecosystem (Turkekul et al., 2004). Mushrooms can also bioaccumu￾late heavy metals (Asiriuwa et al., 2013). A determination of the right fungal species is necessary 
for significant remediation effects.
Phytoremediation is a method that involves the use of plants to remove pollutants from the eco￾system. It eliminates the need to excavate the polluted material for treatment (U.S. EPA, 1989). 
Some plant species have the potential to eliminate a wide range of organic, inorganic and heavy 
metal contaminants by degrading, metabolizing or immobilizing them (Vidali, 2001; Garbisu 
and Alkorta, 2003; Rahimi et al., 2012). Phytoextraction (phytoaccumulation) (Rahimi et al., 
2012; Njoku et al., 2009; Sinha et al., 2010; Gupta et al., 2003), phytovolatilization (Jankaite and 
Vasarevičius, 2005), phytostabilization, rhizofiltration and phytostimulization are the various tech￾niques employed by plants in phytoremediation.
Phytoextraction is the hyperaccumulation of heavy metals from the soil in the harvestable parts 
of plants. Plants such as Brassica juncea, Thalspi caerulescens and Helianthus annus are involved 
in the phytoextraction of inorganic metals including cobalt, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, gold, 
mercury, molybdenum, silver and cadmium. The plants that act as hyperaccumulators exhibit slow 
growth and development. Hence, the bioproductivity is less. After the process has been carried out, 
the plant mass should be disposed of properly.
Rhizofiltration involves the accumulation of heavy metals in the rhizosphere through sorp￾tion, concentration and precipitation. This technology is observed in plants such as Brassica jun￾cea, Helianthes annus, tobacco, rye, spinach and corn against cadmium, copper, nickel, zinc and 
chromium.
Phytovolatilization is performed by the leaves of plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, poplars, 
alfalfa and Brassica juncea through transpiration for the removal of selenium, mercury and arsenic. 104 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
The plants transform the pollutants to a less toxic form. This includes the risk of transfer of heavy 
metals through the food chain.
Phytostabilization involves the complexation, sorption and precipitation of inorganic metals such 
as arsenic, cadmium, copper, chromium, lead, zinc and hassium by Brassica juncea, hybrid poplars 
and grasses. The extra steps involved in conventional methods, for example, the removal of soil, are 
eliminated. Therefore, it is cost effective. However, the plants usually require modified soil specific 
for their growth.
One environmentally friendly and cost-effective method to clean up toxic metal-contaminated 
soil and water is by using metal accumulating plants (Raskin et al., 1997; Ali et al., 2013). A study 
revealed that plants such as Brassica juncea, Zea mays and Ambrosia artemisiifilia accumulate 
metals including lead, copper and nickel by concentrating it in their harvestable dried shoot bio￾mass. Almost 400 species of plants have been identified to be capable of removing toxic contami￾nants from soil and water.
Advantages:
• It is a natural process.
• The microbes increase in number at a high concentration of contaminant and decline when 
the contaminant quantity decreases.
• The residues of the treatment are usually harmless products.
• The complete destruction of the target pollutants is possible.
Disadvantages:
• It is limited to compounds that are biodegradable.
• The biological processes are highly specific. All essential factors such as suitable environ￾mental conditions, metabolically capable microbes and an appropriate level of nutrients 
are required for effective results.
• It is difficult to extrapolate from a pilot-scale to full-scale studies.
• The process is more time consuming.
6.4.1.10 Chemical Remediation
The addition of chemicals to heavy metal-contaminated soil can transform the heavy metals into 
a less toxic form. As a result, the heavy metals remain in the soil but in a less harmful form. This 
method is becoming popular due to its high rate of success, but it requires special equipment and 
operators. It is a periodical treatment. Large-scale heavy metal remediation is currently not possible 
with this method. Various methods include remediation using actinide chelators, chemical immobi￾lization and critical fluid extraction (Czupyrna et al., 1989; Gopalan et al., 1993).
Cyanide can be transformed into cyanate upon treatment with oxidants that have high electron 
affinity. Therefore, cyanide contamination in soil can be reduced by the addition of oxidants (Young 
et al., 1995).
Chromium (Cr) has applications in various industries, for example, leather tanning and wood 
preserving. Cr(VI) is a very toxic contaminant found in soil and water. It causes multiple serious 
health issues. On the contrary, Cr(III) is non-toxic. By reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III), the load of toxic 
contaminant in soil can be significantly reduced. This can be achieved by the inexpensive chemical 
precipitation method. It is a two-step process: first, Cr(VI) is reduced under acidic conditions, and 
then, the trivalent chromium is precipitated as hydroxyl species.
6.4.2 Nanoremediation for Heavy Metal Contamination
Nanotechnology, an emerging branch of science, has a wide range of applications in pharmaceuticals, 
the medical field, agriculture, etc. (Hasnain et al., 2013). Nanostructured materials are studied to be Comparison of Traditional and Nanoremediation Technology 105
used as adsorbents and catalysts for the transformation and detoxification of toxic environmental 
pollutants (Agarwal and Joshi, 2010). Nanoremediation is a process involving nano-sized materials 
that enable both chemical reduction and catalysis to eliminate pollutants. The use of nanoremediation 
methods prevents the pumping of groundwater and transport of soil for treatment and disposal (Otto 
et al., 2008; Karn et al., 2009). The valuable properties of nanoparticles, including their minute size, 
alterable surface coatings and various other physical and chemical properties, enable them to pass 
through less space and facilitate remediation. They can also retain groundwater for a longer period 
of time, thereby providing a long-term solution for soil remediation (Zhang, 2003). Even though the 
nanomaterials currently explored for remediation do not travel far from the site of injection, their size 
still gives hope for development in this aspect (Tratnyek and Johnson, 2006).
Nanomaterials such as nanoscale zeolites, metal oxides, carbon nanotubes and fibers, enzymes, 
various noble metals and titanium dioxide are used for nanoremediation. Iron nanoparticles have 
been shown to be effective against common environmental contaminants. These efficient nanopar￾ticles can be further catalyzed and modified for enhanced function in remediation. Titanium diox￾ide (TiO2) is also a leading candidate for nanoremediation and wastewater treatment, although it 
is reported to have not yet been expanded to full-scale commercialization. TiO2 and zinc oxide 
(ZnO) are capable of semiconducting, photolcatalysis and energy conversion. These materials are 
low cost, less toxic and easily available. They have grabbed the attention of researchers with their 
fascinating properties. Their photocatalytic property has been widely studied for its application in 
water (Mansoori et al., 2008). Magnetic nanoparticles enable the separation of contaminants using 
the magnetic field, and this is considered a quality step for nanoremediation. Polymer brush-grafted 
magnetic nanoparticles are efficient in removing mercury (II) ions from water (Farrukh et al., 2013). 
Biologically synthesized magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have been proven to reduce toxic Cr(VI) 
into a stable, nontoxic form, such as a Cr31 spinel layer when studied using X-ray absorption and 
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (Telling et al., 2009).
Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI), the most commonly used nanomaterial (Theron et al., 2008), 
ranges in size from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. The distribution of nZVI and its mobility can be fur￾ther enhanced upon creating a catalytic synergy by adding noble metals (which promotes iron oxi￾dation or electron transfer) such as palladium (which catalyzes dechlorination and hydrogenation) 
and silver (U.S. EPA, 2008). These metals are generally less reactive, but they make the reaction 
more efficient (Tratnyek and Johnson, 2006).
Nanoparticles attach to soil and aquifer materials via various aspects such as through the sur￾face chemistry, groundwater chemistry and hydrodynamic conditions (U.S. EPA, 2007, 2008). 
nZVI and carbon nanotubes can be used to clean up and reuse contaminated groundwater (Rajan, 
2011). Hexavalent chromium occupies the top priority position in the US Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)’s defined list of toxic and environmental pollutants. It is likely a carcinogen and a 
mutagen. Such a toxic compound can be eliminated by using nZVI. A study proved that 1.5g of 
nZVI can eliminate 98% of hexavalent chromium in a limited time (Singh et al., 2011).

6.4.2.1 Advantages of Nanoremediation
Nanotechnology in environmental remediation makes the process cost effective and reduces the 
effort involved in cleaning up contaminated sites. Its ability to be used as an on-site or in-situ treat￾ment is the major advantage of nanoremediation. Through this method, tedious processes, such as 
removing and transporting soil (involving excessive time and effort), can be avoided (Karn et al., 
2009). Nanotechnology can destruct organic contaminants and transform or precipitate inorganic 
contaminants. nZVI is also known to treat radionuclides including radium and uranium. Their par￾ticle size enables closer contact with the contaminant, thereby increasing the rate of contaminant 
destruction. A study revealed that degradation was much higher with the use of microscale iron par￾ticles in combination with bimetallic nanoparticles than the use of microscale nanoparticles alone. 
nZVI is found to be operative across a wide range of pHs and temperatures.
6.4.2.2 Disadvantages of Nanoremediation
Risk factors cannot be completely eliminated when new compounds are introduced into the envi￾ronment. Even though nanoparticles used for remediation are designed to reduce the contaminated 
toxicity, they may generate certain byproducts that have toxic effects and high mobility or they may 
stay at the site of injection for a longer duration. Recent research indicates that the nanoparticles 
used for remediation can enter the food chain and bioaccumulate (Karn et al., 2009).
6.5 TRADITIONAL REMEDIATION METHODS VERSUS NANOREMEDIATION
Traditional physical and chemical remediation methods are time consuming and expensive. 
Bioremediation specifically needs organisms that will successfully reduce pollutant levels. It is 
time-consuming that appropriate conditions empirically needed for the organism’s growth have 
TABLE 6.2
Nanoremediation versus Traditional Remediation Methods
Nanoremediation Traditional remediation techniques
It reduces the effort involved in cleaning up the 
contaminated site.
Traditional remediation methods involve tedious and complex steps.
It facilitates in-situ treatment. Therefore, excessive 
effort and time consuming steps such as 
removing and transporting soil can be avoided.
In a traditional remediation method such as soil washing, the soil 
from the contaminated site has to be removed and transported for 
ex-situ treatment.
The developing field of nanotechnology enables 
the smart design of nanoparticles. Accordingly, 
nanoparticles can be designed in such a way that 
they can treat an extended range of contaminants.
Every traditional remediation method focuses only upon a specific 
range of contaminants.
The changes in environmental factors will not 
pose a problem because nanoparticles can be 
designed to survive such changes.
In the case of bioremediation, the survival of microorganisms is 
highly favored by diverse environmental factors.
It also helps in improving the extent and speed of 
contaminant destruction.
The removal, transportation and treatment of soil, the time taken for 
the growth and multiplication of microorganisms and the setting up 
of the instruments delay the remediation process.
The particle size enables closer contact with the 
contaminant, thereby increasing the rate of 
contaminant destruction.
Traditional treatments including vitrification, electrokinetic 
remediation, solid isolation and containment aim to treat only a 
specific site at a time, leaving the adjacent area untreated.
Properly designed nanoparticles will not alter the 
nature of the soil.
The chemical agents used in traditional methods may change the 
nature of the soil and contribute toxicity. Microbes used in the 
remediation and electrolysis processes tend to alter the pH of the soil.Comparison of Traditional and Nanoremediation Technology 107
to be strictly maintained. Non-biodegradable contaminants such as polymers and plastic will still 
remain in the soil. In contrast, nanotechnology helps design nanoscale particles that can not only 
reach inaccessible areas such as crevices and aquifers but also degrade the contaminant. This will 
further eliminate costly traditional operations. Moreover, nanotechnology enables us to design 
nanoparticles specific to certain contaminants, therefore increasing the affinity, selectivity and sen￾sitivity of the technique. Therefore, nanoremediation is more specific and cost effective (Filipponi 
and Sutherland, 2010).
6.6 CONCLUSION
Air, water and soil are contaminated with different types of pollutants or contaminants generated 
by human activity. Heavy metal ions are one of the major pollutants that are hazardous to living 
beings. The traditional methods available for the removal of pollutants are generally labor inten￾sive, consume more time and are expensive. Apart from these techniques, the remediation of toxic 
compounds can be achieved by emerging nanotechnology. Various nanoparticles have been found 
to be very effective for the elimination of contaminants from the environment. This approach is 
comparatively cheaper and more efficient. Therefore, nanotechnology serves as a better alternative 
for remediating our environment (Ingle et al., 2014).

Joint Use of Nanomaterials 
and Plants for the Remediation 
of Inorganic Pollutants
Aqsa Nadeem Shah, Naila Safdar, 
Gul-e-Saba Chaudhry, and Azra Yasmin
7.1 INORGANIC POLLUTANTS
Waste from industries contains a variety of pollutants that are both inorganic and organic in nature. 
Many inorganic contaminants that can cause harm to the environment are produced and used in 
different ways and can cause serious health hazards. A wide range of inorganic pollutants is pro￾duced from industrial sources, for example, the pulp and paper industry (Tavangar et al., 2020). 
The pharmaceutical industry is the main source of inorganic pollutants (Singh & Chandra, 2019). 
These inorganic pollutants mainly include heavy metals and are released worldwide. According to 
one estimate, 50,000 tons/year of chromium are discharged from refuse incineration and the burn￾ing of coal and wood, and 60,000 tons/year of nickel is released by the combustion of coal, whereas 
the major portion of it remains in ash. In addition, 7,000 tons/year of cadmium are emitted from the 
combustion of coal and sewage sludge incineration (Ali et al., 2019). Some well-known inorganic 
pollutants include the following:
• Cadmium: It appears in rechargeable batteries, coating, pigments, plating, plastic stabiliz￾ers and tobacco smoke.
• Chromium: Many manufacturers use it for leather, brick, wood, pigments and dyes.
• Lead: It is utilized in paints, batteries, gasoline and explosives.
• Mercury: It is used in thermometers, incandescent lights, barometers, fossil fuel emissions 
and batteries.
• Arsenic: This element is employed as an alloy of lead, for example, in car batteries and 
ammunition (Saxena & Bharagava, 2017)
7.2 CRITICAL THRESHOLD VALUE OF INORGANIC POLLUTANTS
Allowable exposure concentrations are also known as the exposure limit, toxicity reference value or 
critical threshold. These threshold values are determined from toxicity experiments. A few heavy 
metals are known as essential heavy metals, and they are very important from a biological point of 
view. In contrast, if their dosage and contact time is increased, then they become dangerous to life. 
Non-essential heavy metals that include cadmium, lead and mercury and metalloids that include 
arsenic are toxic even at lower concentrations. Our body needs very small quantities of essential ele￾ments. However, if their concentration is increased above a specified limit, then they becomes toxic. 
As reported by Saxena et al. (2019), the highest threshold value in water for copper (Cu) is 2 mg/L, 
and the limit value for cadmium’s threshold in water is 0.003 mg/L. In addition, in soil, the high￾est threshold value is reported for chromium (Cr) at 1–1,000 mg/kg, and the lowest is reported for 
mercury (Hg) at 0.001–3 mg/kg. Moreover, these heavy metals can act in the body like a metabolic 
7
DOI: 10.1201/9781003186298-7Nanomaterials and Plants to Remediate Inorganic Pollutants 111
poison. Heavy metals’ reaction with the sulfhydryl enzyme system results in their inhibition as 
these enzymes are involved in cellular energy production; therefore, the metabolic system becomes 
disturbed (Ali et al., 2019).
7.3 INORGANIC POLLUTANTS IN AIR
Inorganic pollutants in gaseous form become part of the atmosphere because of human activities. 
The pollutants that are added to the atmosphere in large quantities include carbon monoxide (CO), 
sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). However, the quantity of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is more than these pollutants. Significant quantities of these pollut￾ants are added yearly to the atmosphere due to human activities. The worldwide emission of carbon, 
sulfur and nitrogen oxides are almost several hundred million tons each year (Manahan, 2017).
Many inorganic pollutants become part of the air, and their presence requires air treatment. 
These pollutants commonly include carbon, nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Volatile organic com￾pound (VOC) removal from the air is easier than the removal of inorganic pollutants, and a con￾siderable data exist about their removal. Compounds comprising nitrogen and oxygen are known 
as nitrogen oxides (NOs). Among them, the most toxic are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen oxide 
(NO2). Another toxic oxide of nitrogen is nitrogen pentaoxide (N2O5). The main sources of NOs 
are anthropogenic sources that include aircrafts, vehicles, power plants and volcanic eruptions, 
along with some other natural causes. NOs that are present in a sizable amount in large cities can 
be the contributing factor in monitoring the air quality. Along with their negative effects on human 
health, they also contribute to acid rain and global warming and damaging the tropospheric ozone 
(Ângelo et al., 2013). Sulfur oxide is also known as a common atmospheric pollutant (Boyjoo 
et al., 2017). It is responsible for causing not only damage to buildings and vegetation but also acid 
rain (Burns et al., 2016). When present in the atmosphere as airborne elements, sulfur oxides can be 
the source of a reduction in visibility. When inhaled for a longer duration, sulfur oxides can cause 
many problems in the respiratory tract, including asthma and the constriction of bronchi (Krishnan 
et al., 2013).
7.4 INORGANIC POLLUTANTS IN WATER
Water that is free from toxins and pathogens, that is, clean water, is important for human health. 
Clean water is also important in a variety of industries such as electronics, food and pharmaceuti￾cals. However, rapid industrialization has resulted in the production of hazardous waste, which is 
released directly in water. This includes arsenides, heavy metal ions, fluorides and inorganic toxic 
substances (Cao & Li, 2014).
The pulp and paper industry is the major contributor in releasing multifaceted pollutants in 
nature, namely, organic and inorganic pollutants. They are also released at the time of pulping and 
bleaching in the paper manufacturing procedure. The inorganic pollutants that are released during 
this process include Cu, nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), magnesium and ferrous, which has been shown to 
be a cause of neurotoxicity in catfish. It accumulates in muscles, gills, ovaries and the liver. Other 
basic contaminants include hexadecanoic acids, octacosane, benzoic acid, terpenes, phenols and 
decalones. Of these, a few chemicals are known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and 
they cause harm to the reproductive systems of aquatic life (Singh & Chandra, 2019).
The waste water released from the paint industry also contains many pollutants that have an 
organic and inorganic nature. Like organic and inorganic pigments, emulsion paint consists of 
emulsifying agents and non-cellulosic and cellulosic thickeners, extenders and latexes. The chemi￾cals used in paint manufacturing are responsible for the presence of hazardous pollutants, which are 
mostly heavy metals in released water. Heavy metals are persistent, and their uptake by aquatic life 
results in different health problems that include gene mutations, deformities, kidney problems and 
cancer (Aniyikaiye et al., 2019).112 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
7.5 INORGANIC POLLUTANTS IN SOIL
In soil, the major toxicants found consist of arsenic (As), Cu, Zn, Hg, cadmium (Cd) and Cr. These 
pollutants become part of the soil through poor management practices in agriculture, for example, 
industrial waste not being discharged properly, leakage of landfills, the unlawful discarding of 
household wastes, wet and dry depositions and industrial emissions, and through natural occur￾rences such as volcanic eruptions (Saha et al., 2017).
Paddy soils have a complex nature and are a source of the nutrients required for plant growth. 
The nutrient level of paddy soils is dependent upon factors including the application of fertilizer, 
tillage and movement of nutrients in the soil. Paddy soils become polluted with either industrial 
waste water or sewage waste water, which contain many pollutants, namely, heavy metals, fertil￾izers, pesticides and the leakage of petrochemicals. Inorganic pollutants that include heavy metals, 
for example, lead (Pb), Zn, Cd, As, Hg and Cu, cause serious health hazards to humans, plants 
and animals and also affects soil fertility (Akram et al., 2018). According to Li et al. (2018), urban 
soil, also known as anthropic soil, has been disturbed due to human activities such as importing, 
exporting and mixing, which causes contamination with many organic and inorganic pollutants. 
Urban soil contamination is because of emissions in urban areas through transport, the combustion 
of coal and industrial waste. Urban soil includes the soil in urban green areas such as gardens and 
parks. Therefore, the contamination of soil can directly affect human health when people come into 
contact with it. Urban soil contains non-biodegradable heavy metals. Moreover, they are difficult 
to remove.
7.6 HEALTH HAZARDS FROM INORGANIC POLLUTANTS
The global update 2005, air quality guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) provided 
an assessment of the health effects of air pollution. It also provided a threshold pollution level that 
is harmful to health. In 2016, 91% of the world’s population lived where the WHO guidelines for 
air quality were not satisfying. In 2016, city and rural air pollution triggered 4.2 million premature 
deaths all over the world. Moreover, in low- and middle-income countries, 91% of premature deaths 
occurred due to “Ambient (outdoor) air pollution” (2018).
Toxic heavy metals such as Cr, Cd and Pb are found in higher concentrations in cancer and 
diabetic patients than people without these diseases in the City of Lahore in Pakistan (Ali 
et al., 2019). Diseases including cholera, diarrhea, hepatitis A and dysentery are mostly the 
result of unsanitary and unclean potable water. According to one estimate, every year, more 
than 842,000 deaths occur globally from diarrhea. In addition, as pollution also affects ground￾water, this impacts 70 million people worldwide (Hasan et al., 2019). Inorganic pollutants 
that mainly include heavy metals result in various health hazards that are briefly described in 
Table 7.1. 
7.7 EMERGING POLLUTANTS
Other than inorganic pollutants, some pollutants have been found in nature and can enter the envi￾ronment. These pollutants are called emerging pollutants (EPos), and they have been part of our 
environment for a long time but have been ignored. These pollutants can affect human health, 
ecology and wildlife. EPos can be released from using inorganic chemicals or from dumping used 
chemicals. These pollutants are not even part of national and international routine monitoring pro￾grams, and their adverse effects and consequences are not well known. EPos can be organic or inor￾ganic in nature. Inorganic EPos include selenium, thallium, Cu, silver, perfluoroalkyl compounds 
and chlorinated paraffin. These pollutants arrive through urban, industrial, transport and agricul￾tural sources and are released by runoff, leaching and erosion (Geissen et al., 2015). EPos can also Nanomaterials and Plants to Remediate Inorganic Pollutants 113
be termed as materials that result from many daily uses whose nature can be biological or chemical 
(Pal et al., 2014). Different EPos are as follows.
7.7.1 Pharmaceuticals
The use of veterinary and human medicines, which includes antibiotics, analgesics and antidepres￾sants, is extensive and continuously enters aquatic environments; a majority of these compounds are 
not metabolized and are therefore toxic to living beings. In healthcare facilities, pharmaceuticals 
are consumed at different concentrations. In the case of Germany, the total consumption of pharma￾ceuticals for hospitals including the psychiatric, nursing home and general hospital was estimated, 
and it ranges from 32 for psychiatric hospitals and 1,263 kg per year for general hospitals, whose 
regular annual usage for single pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.1 to 1,000 g/bed. Upon consumption, 
the excretion of these drugs takes place through urine at about 55–80%, and a lower rate is excreted 
through feces at 4–30%. These drugs are either released as metabolites, in conjunction with inactive 
substances, or as non-metabolized substances (Oliveira et al., 2017).
7.7.2 Personal Care Products
Substances of common use such as shampoo, toothpaste, perfumes, sunscreens and soaps become 
a part of our environment and are detected in groundwater and waste water because they are not 
completely degraded. These products release several pollutants that are termed EPos (Rodriguez￾Narvaez et al., 2017).
Archer et al. (2017) conducted a study at a South African waste water treatment work (WWTW) 
and verified the existence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). About 90 emerg￾ing contaminants were detected in this study. The treatment site was the Province of Gauteng in 
South Africa. Water samples were collected and passed through treatment steps. Out of 90 EPos, 19 
classes of PPCPs were detected. Most of them were reduced in effluent, but some were retained and 
even showed higher concentrations.

7.7.3 Sunscreen Products
The use of sunscreen products has increased over recent years because of the popular trend of 
coastal sight-seeing all over the world. This has caused sunscreens to be a source of harmful chemi￾cals to marine life. Sunblock/sunscreen products comprise both organic and inorganic ingredients/
pollutants, which have not been addressed thus far. Among them are titanium oxide and Zn oxide 
that protect the human skin from direct ultraviolet (UV) radiation by scattering UV rays. In addi￾tion, these sunscreens also include certain products such as preservatives, different kinds of color￾ing agents and viscosity controllers and scents. These additives are fatal to phytoplankton in marine 
ecosystems; therefore, their removal is quite important, which can be performed either by biodeg￾radation processes or absorption sedimentation. Sunscreen products have accumulated easily in the 
food chain because of their stability against biodegradation.
7.8 STRATEGIES TO REMEDIATE INORGANIC POLLUTANTS
7.8.1 Bioremediation
Bioremediation is the process in which biological causes, namely, microbes (algae, plants, fungi 
and bacteria), are used to remove toxins from the environment. In a polluted environment, one of 
the most efficient tools includes bioremediation to manage the organic and inorganic environmen￾tal contaminants. The harmful wastes generated from chemical operations are treated with the 
help of physical or chemical methods by industries to meet the standards of cleanliness as set by 
Environmental Protection Act, 1986 (Singh, 2014). Moreover, these physical and chemical methods 
are not zero waste and pose various other environmental problems.
7.8.2 Types of Bioremediation
Bioremediation approaches to treat pollutants include microbial bioremediation in which bacteria, 
fungi and algae are used to treat both inorganic and organic contaminants (Bharagava et al., 2020). 
Another technique involves phytoremediation, which controls pollutants in an economical, environ￾mentally friendly and energy-efficient way. With this technology, plant parts and microbes interact 
together and mitigate the contaminants in the soil and air. The rhizosphere of plants is involved 
in the remediation of pollutants because pollutants accumulate in the soil when leaves fall off and 
precipitation occurs (Lee et al., 2020).
7.8.3 Phytoremediators in Pollutant Remediation
Plants can accept heavy metals from the soil in their leaves and shoots, without showing any 
toxicity, but only 0.2% of all plant species have this ability. The amount of metals that they can 
accumulate is 100–1,000 times greater than plants that are from a non-hyperaccumulator group. 
They also take up to 0.1% of metals including Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni and cobalt, whereas 1% of 
Zn and manganese are taken up by these plants. Plants such as Brassica campestris L., Brassica 
carinata, Brassica juncea L. and Brassica nigra L. can collect a noticeable quantity of Pb in 
their dry biomass. Cynodon dactylon is a plant species that can accumulate metals such as Zn, 
Pd and Cd in quantities of 14 mg/kg, 658 mg/kg and 828 mg/kg, respectively (RoyChowdhury 
et al., 2018).
Arundo donax is an invasive weed, but its role in phytoremediation has also been identified. This 
plant is also named for a giant reed, and it has a prominent role in the phytoremediation of selenium, 
which is a toxic element. This plant is used for the phytoremediation of soils rich in selenium in 
China and the USA (Fiorentino et al., 2017). A. Donax is tolerant against As in higher concentra￾tions. It not only bioaccumulates but also volatilizes As (7.2–22%) in concentrations from 300 
to 1,000 ug/L. Due to this property, it is used to re-establish As-contaminated soil (Prabakaran et al., Nanomaterials and Plants to Remediate Inorganic Pollutants 115
FIGURE 7.1 Modes of phytoremediation.
2019). Awa and Hadibarata (2020) described the well-known mechanisms used in the phytoremedia￾tion of heavy metal-contaminated soil and water, which are shown in Figure 7.1. Common modes of 
phytoremediation include phytovolatalization, phytoextraction, phytostabilization and rhizofiltera￾tion. Some other common techniques involved in bioremediation strategies are shown in Figure 7.2.

7.9 NANO TREATMENTS OF INORGANIC POLLUTANTS
One of the greatest challenges of the present century is environmental pollution. Different technolo￾gies have been invented to mitigate pollutants in water, soil and air. Among these, nano treatments 
are newly emerging technology adapted for the treatment of waste and pollutants in the environ￾ment. Nano treatments, also referred to as nano-therapy, involve the use of nanoparticles with a 
nanoscale (1–100 nm) for the remediation of different pollutants regarding their differentiated envi￾ronments of soil, water or air.
Nanoparticles that use a chemical method have been synthesized and employed to mitigate. Lim 
et al. (2018) reported that heavy metals and dyes can be removed from water by incorporating the 
usage of graphene and its oxides. Nano-sized graphene possesses a large surface area. It is possible to 
prepare it through both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Examples are the well-known method 
of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical exfoliation. Because of their porous structure, 
nanoparticles adsorb contaminants present in water. Huang et al. (2018) described nanoscale zerova￾lent iron (nZVI) nanoparticles as significant material for the removal of azo dyes, chlorinated and 
nitro aromatic compounds and heavy metals. The principle of this technology is based on a thin 
iron oxide core that through electronic interaction and surface complexation can quickly stop the 
uptake of pollutants. Nanofiber technology as reported by Lim (2017) has emerged because of its 
high specific surface area and high surface area-to-volume ratio. Nanofibers can be synthesized by 
different means through solution blow spinning, centrifugal jet spinning and electro hydrodynamic 
direct writing. Pollutants in water can be removed with particles that have a distinct pore size. The 
efficient removal of methylene blue from water has been conducted with hybrid MnO2-coated cellu￾lose nanofibers. These nanofibers showed efficient adsorption and oxidation in the decolonization of 
methylene blue. Cu and Ni from aqueous solutions can be successfully removed by using magnetic 
hydroxyapatite nano rods as indicated by Thanh et al. (2018). Nanomaterials of silica are utilized 
in eliminating cationic dyes, heavy metals and hydrogen sulfide from water, as reported by Guerra 
et al. (2018). Other various types of these compounds used in the mitigation of inorganic pollutants 
are listed in Table 7.2.

7.10 LIMITATIONS OF CHEMICALLY SYNTHESIZED NANO TREATMENTS
Various nanomaterials of a chemically synthesized nature are employed in the treatment of inor￾ganic pollutants, but because of their limitations, their usage is not common. Some of the limitations 
of chemically synthesized nanomaterials include
• High cost and low yield
• High temperature requirement
• High technical facilities are needed
• Potentially hazardous
• Capping ligands and residual toxins add to environmental toxicity
• They threaten the environment by generating new toxins and pollutants
(Khalil et al., 2016).
7.11 GREEN NANOMATERIALS
The term “green” denotes the utilization of plant or plant parts by following green chemistry and 
green engineering. The main purpose of this technology is to contribute towards environmental 
sustainability by producing nanoproducts for the benefit of mankind and the environment (Verma 
et al., 2019). Well-known advantages of green nanomaterials include
• Reduction of greenhouse gases and harmful remains
• Amplified energy competence
• Reduced intake of non-renewable raw provisions
• Lessen the risk for discharging toxic residues into the environment
• Ensure sustainable production and application.
Various types of plant-based nanoparticles are employed in the treatment of inorganic pollutants. 
The remediation efficiency of various types of synthesized nanomaterials vary with the class and 
type of green material used. Different classes of green nanomaterials employed in the remediation 
of pollutants are discussed in Table 7.3. 
7.12 MODE OF THE MECHANISM FOR NANO TREATMENTS
Nano treatments are one of the latest tools for the remediation of inorganic pollutants. Due to 
their small surface area, nanomaterials act as potent pollutant remediators. Common mechanisms 
employed for nano-remediation include
1. Adsorption (Figure 7.3) and
2. Photocatalysis.
7.12.1 Adsorption
Adsorption can be defined as the procedure of adsorption of heavy metals on the surface of a solid 
substance. When the heavy metal amount that has been adsorbed by water reaches to constant, an 
equilibrium is achieved. The adsorption rate is determined through different kinetic models. If 
the adsorption rate is fast, then this means that a shorter amount of time is required to attain the 
equilibrium in adsorption. The rate of adsorption is usually affected through different factors such 
as the pore diffusion velocity of the adsorbates, time, pollutants, concentration of the adsorbent, 
temperature and pH.118 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution TABLE 7.3 Class of Green Nanomaterials with Their Properties and Applications Groups Plant from which synthesized Properties Applications References Carbon-Based Nanoparticles Solanum lycopersicum, Brassica napus and Amaranthus dubius They consist of fullerenes, carbon dots and nano dots.

They are extensively used due to their high degree of biocompatibility. Pharmacological and pollution remediation García-Pinel et al. (2019), Yang et al. (2018)Nanomaterials and Plants to Remediate Inorganic Pollutants 119
Many nanomaterials including carbon composites and nanotubes, graphene, polymeric sorbents, 
metal oxides and nano metals are being used to remove inorganic pollutants in different mediums, 
namely, the air, soil and water. They possess an efficient adsorption ability. Major reasons for their 
usage are the easy removal of adsorbed contaminants from their surface and their recycling ability 
(Wang et al., 2020).
7.12.2 Photocatalysis
Photocatalysis is one of the evolving technologies for treating pollutants by using different types of 
semiconductors as a photocatalyst. Because of the electronic structure of the semiconductors, they 
contribute to photocatalysis. Semiconductors comprise a
• Valance Band (VB) and a
• Conduction band (CB).
The band gap is known as the difference in energy between these two bands. Its energy is > 3.5 
volts. The electrons and holes in the VB before exposure to light are not in an excited state. When 
the semiconductor surface is exposed to the light of a specific type of wavelength, a transfer of elec￾trons takes place from the VB to the CB. Because of this process, holes are produced in the VB that 
lead to the production of an electron-hole pair. Holes and electrons both reach the surface and cause 
oxidation and a reduction of adsorbed reactants, respectively. Additionally, from the electron-hole 
pair, a strong redox system comes into existence. This results in a generation of a hydroxyl radical 
by the photo produced holes via OH− and H2O oxidation that are being absorbed on the surface of 
the semiconductor. Meanwhile, a reduction of O2 molecules, which come from absorbed air, takes 
place by the action of the electrons in the conduction band. This eventually results in the synthesis 
of peroxyl radicals. These produced radicals have the potential for oxidation and the degradation 
of organic/inorganic substances. These reactions are the basis for any photocatalytic mechanism as 
shown in Figure 7.4.
Semicondutors are used because they are cost efficient, stable and harmless to humans and the 
environment. Applications of photocatalysis include the purification of waste water, photocatalytic 
self-cleaning, photovoltaics and photocatalytic water splitting. Commonly used semiconductors for 
photocatalysis are based on titanium and Zn, which are the ideal metals for nanoparticle synthesis 
when the goal is pollutant treatment (Jain & Vaya, 2017).

7.13 SUCCESS STORIES OF GREEN NANOMATERIALS IN THE 
TREATMENT OF INORGANIC POLLUTANTS
Nanoparticle formation by numerous biological systems has been described, but presently, the focus 
is on the biosynthesis of plant nanoparticles, which is considered among the most suitable methods. 
Listed below are some of the recent success stories of green nanomaterials used in the treatment of 
inorganic pollutants.
1. Shittu and Ihebunna (2017) reported the use of nanoparticles of Ag for the purification 
of waste water. They were synthesized from leaf extract of Piliostigma thonningii. These 
nanoparticles effectively removed heavy metals from water with a removal efficiency of 
96.9% and subchronic effect of purified water in in-vivo rats.
2. Abril et al. (2018) described the exclusion of heavy metals (Cu, Zn) in soil and water with 
a removal efficiency of greater than 99% for water and 95% for soil by using the extract of 
mortino fruit (Vaccinium floribundum Kunth).
3. Cd (II) is a toxic heavy metal that affects the health of all humans, animals and plants. 
Silver nanoparticles synthesized from the leaf extract of the Ficus tree (Ficus Benjamina), 
as reported by Al-Qahtani (2017), have been utilized to eliminate Cd (II) in water. The 
removal of Cd increased with the increase in the time of the biosorbent.
4. Samrot et al. (2019) described Araucaria heterophylla, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis 
chilensis as plants whose gums were used for the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles. These 
nanoparticles were less than 50 nm in size. Along with anticancer and antimicrobial activ￾ity, they were effectively used for heavy metals removal.
5. Goutam et al. (2018) discussed the production of titanium oxide nanoparticles synthesized 
from biodiesel from a plant known as Jatropha curcas L. and examined its activity to 
treat tannery waste water (TWW). Chemical oxygen demand was improved and Cr was 
removed from the TWW when the nanoparticles underwent secondary treatment. Because 
of the treatment in the self-designed reactor, a success rate of 82.26% COD and 76.48% Cr 
removal was achieved. Therefore, this treatment is being used popularly as green technol￾ogy for the in-situ remediation of TWW.
6. Yasmin et al. (2020) reported the production of Ag nanoparticles from the leaf extract of 
the plant Diospyros lotus. The best Ag nanoparticles were synthesized at a pH of 8.6 with

1.5 mM conc. of AgNO3 with a 10 ml concentration of leaf extract. The photocatalytic 
activity of these nanoparticles was observed at 72.91% for the decolorization of industrial 
waste water at 54 h.
7. Magudieshwaran et al. (2019) reported that cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles synthesized 
from Jatropha curcas L. have the potential of the photocatalytic degradation of indoor gas￾eous pollutants. These nanoparticles were found to be of a reduced particle size (3–5nm) 
compared to the chemically synthesized nanoparticles of CeO2 (18–25 nm). These green 
synthesized nanoparticles showed a more effective degradation of acetaldehyde through 
photocatalysis.
7.14 CONCLUSION
Many inorganic pollutants are released from different industries and become part of our envi￾ronment. Inorganic pollutants include heavy metals, which cause serious health hazards to living 
beings. Inorganic pollutants are found in the air, water and soil. Some pollutants are not well known 
and are found in the environment as EPos. These may be inorganic or organic in nature. These 
pollutants can be degraded through bioremediation. Nano treatment is the emerging technology 
for pollutant remediation, but due to its certain limitations, a more promising technology known 
as green technology is evolving. This new emerging technology is the future for the remediation of 
pollutants from the environment. Recent studies and developments emphasize using the plant-based 
synthesis of nanoparticles as a cost-effective and sustainable approach.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
Environmental pollution has become a major threat worldwide, and it is gaining rapid momentum 
due to various anthropogenic activities such as poor agricultural practices, geogenic and techno￾genic activities and natural calamities (Earth 88). In addition, population explosion during recent 
decades has become a serious issue, which forces us to rethink policy to meet our necessities, 
and from this point, severe challenges relating to the environment started. Unplanned coloniza￾tion, a lack of proper waste disposal and unsystematic solid waste management and salvage have 
also kept the environment at high risk. Deforestation has occurred mainly for the purpose of 
industrialization, agriculture and urbanization and has proved to be a major challenge and origin 
of many environmental problems through its degradation, as seen by the enhanced rate of soil 
erosion, sedimentation in rivers, silting, rate of floods and droughts and green house effects and 
a decrease in the top fertile soil; this has also produced a chain reaction. Developments in the 
field of agriculture have also degraded the environment mainly through the excessive applica￾tion of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and even banned chemicals for 
better yield to meet requirements. All of these negative practices have led to a disruption in 
plant-microbe dynamics. Rapid growth in industries has caused them to exploit natural resources, 
which creates several hazardous environmental problems and an ecological imbalance not only 
at the local level but also at the global level. Although these industries produce useful prod￾ucts, there are several unwanted byproducts that are lethal to the environment and health, and 
they thus pollute and degrade environment. Therefore, the natural composition of the soil, water 
and air are becoming imbalanced by a continuous increase in the level of polluting agents such 
as toxic gases, volatile organic compounds, organic substances, heavy metals, industrial dyes, 
solid wastes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 
Moreover, most of them degrade slowly and possess a longer residence time (Zhou et al. 2008; 
Jördening and Winter 2006; Roig et al. 2012; Cieślik et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2005; Joshi et al. 2014). 
Accordingly, due to these seen and unseen anthropogenic activities, the environment is now at 
a critical point. Pollution has affected not only food chains but also the overall food web, and as 
result, all elements of the environment are severely affected. Therefore, it is time to rethink and 
reframe environmental protection policies and to focus much more on the use of safer and more 
advanced tools and techniques to clean the environment by removing pollutants (Reddy 2017). 
However, soil has its own filtration systems, namely, physical filtration by a sieving action, chem￾ical filtration by adsorption and precipitation, transformation and biological filtration by decom￾posing organic materials, but they work only up to a certain limit. Several techniques are used 
to remediate pollutants from the soil, water and air by using physical, chemical and biological 
8126 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
systems (Figure 8.1). For example, phytoremediation is a natural, cost effective and eco-friendly 
technique where plants can be employed to clean up the environment by using their various 
mechanisms (Huang et al. 2004). In addition, nanoparticle-assisted phytoremediation is a very 
promising and interdisciplinary approach to detoxify toxic chemicals (Sozer and Kokini 2009). 
Moreover, CRISPER/Cas9—a genome editing tool—could revolutionize phytoremediation tech￾nology by designing engineered plants with immense phytoremediation potential (Mukherjee 
et al. 2017). In this chapter, we discuss the conventional and advanced technologies for the phy￾toremediation of environmental pollutants.
8.2 VARIOUS METHODS EMPLOYED IN SOIL REMEDIATION
8.2.1 Physical Method
Physical methods involve techniques including heat treatment, electroremediation, vitrification, 
soil flushing and replacement, air sparging and soil vapor extraction. Although these methods are 
helpful to decontaminate the soil from various pollutants, they have some limitations such as they 
require further dispensation and are costly techniques; thus, they are not suitable for a commercial 
scale (Shi et al. 2013).
8.2.2 Chemical Method
This method involves precipitation, ion exchange, chemical extraction and oxidation, soil amend￾ment, chemical leaching and stabilization and nanoremediation. This is an effective method to 
decrease the hazardous properties of pollutants (Leštan et al. 2008). Most of the techniques in this 
method require high-cost chemicals, thus limiting their large-scale adaptation.
FIGURE 8.1 Various methods used for the remediation of co-contaminated soil.Nano-Phytoremediation & Omics for Environmental Cleanup 127
8.2.3 Physiochemical Method
This method implies both physical and chemical methods, which makes it more effective where soil 
washing, ultrasonic leaching and chemically activated adsorption techniques are used (Dermont et al. 
2008).
8.2.4 Biological Method
The remediation of environmental contaminants by using microorganisms and plants is described as 
a biological method, and it has several advantages over conventional methods. It is a cost-effective, 
eco-friendly technique and never creates any resulting pollution. Moreover, it helps to maintain the 
microflora of the soil that play a pivotal role in the plant-microbe dynamics for enhancing agricul￾ture production (Abbas et al. 2014). It includes biological stabilization, bioleaching, biocomposting, 
phytoremediation, biofilm-based remediation, microbial remediation, integrated biosystem reme￾diation and genetic engineering. One potential biological method involves phytoremediation that 
employs the use of plants to remediate soil health. It is a cost-effective and eco-friendly remediation 
technique where plants metabolize compounds in their tissues and degrade them within their root 
rhizosphere. By nature’s virtue, plants can accumulate, metabolize and degrade pollutants from the 
soil, water and air. Recent advances in physiological and molecular mechanisms of phytoreme￾diation have improved its process for cleaning contaminants. Plants have various biophysical and 
biochemical mechanisms by which they can remediate both heavy metals and organic pollutants. 
Faster-growing plants have proved to be very effective for phytoremediation (Chiapusio et al. 2007; 
Fang et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2008). Plants with extensive root systems and a high transpiration rate 
such as poplar (Populus spp.) and willow (Salixspp.) have been shown to be very effective for phy￾toremediation (Jansson and Douglas 2007). Plants have multifarious actions against contaminants, 
for example, immobilization, storage, volatilization and the transformation into different levels or 
in combination, which mainly depend on the type of contamination, plant species and environmen￾tal conditions. Plants use various mechanisms to remediate contamination viz., phytoextraction, 
phytodegradation, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization and rhizodegradation (Subhashini and 
Swamy 2013; Rafati et al. 2011; Padmavathiamma and Li 2007; Barcelo and Poschenrieder 2003; 
Mukhopadhyay and Maiti 2010).
8.2.5 Phytoextraction
Phytoextraction is a phytoremediation technique where plants extract contaminants from soil and 
water into their roots and transfer them to their shoots or leaves. Such plants are tolerant to a 
higher concentration of contaminants; they have abundant biomass, grow faster and possess a pro￾found root system. These plants are able to accumulate biomass hastily with ample storage capacity 
(Blaylock and Huang 2000; McGrath 1998; Akanang and Adamu 2017).
8.2.6 Phytodegradation/Phytotransformation
In phytodegradation, plants use their metabolic pathways to degrade or break down organic pol￾lutants through their enzymes or enzyme cofactors into a simpler form (Susarla et al. 2002). Plant 
enzymes or enzyme cofactors phytodegrade or phytotransform pollutants such as those in the Cannas 
plant that detoxify different soil xenobiotics. Some enzymes from plants and soil are reported that 
have a role in the elimination of contaminants viz., nitrilase, laccase, peroxidase, nitroreductase and 
dehalogenase (Dec and Bollang 1994; Strand et al. 1995; Kvesitadze et al. 2006).128 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
8.2.7 Phytostabilization
Phytostabilization is a phytoremediation approach where plants decrease the migration of various 
contaminants in soil through, for example, erosion, leaching and run off. In this way, this method 
restricts not only the bioavailability of contaminants in the environment but also their mixing into 
food chains. The roots of Nerium oleander and Fetucarubra L. can phytostabilize heavy metals 
(Elloumi et al. 2017; Cunningham et al. 1996).
8.2.8 Phytovolatilization
Phytovolatilization is a method where plants take pollutants from contaminated soil and convert 
them into a volatile form and release them in the environment. The remediation of selenium (Se) 
and mercury (Hg) has been shown in some studies by using this method (Bañuelos et al. 2000; 
Henry 2000). Volatile contaminants resolve in plants and disseminate into the environment through 
a gas exchange from the stomata of leaves. Higher plants may biologically demethylate methylated 
phenol and tetrabromobisphenol back to their close relative compounds (Fu et al. 2018; Hou et al. 
2018; Sun et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2016b). Hydrophilic compounds such as phenol and acetone may be 
moderately phytovolatilized compared with hydrophilic compounds viz., lower chlorinated benzene 
and chlorinated ethenes (Grove and Stein 2005; Polprasert et al. 1996; MacLeod 1999; Bankston 
et al. 2002; Ma and Burken 2003).
8.2.9 Rhizodegradation/Filtration
In this process, specific vascular plants treat contaminants by increasing a microorganism’s activ￾ity in its rhizosphere. Plant growth-promoting bacteria show an increased bioavailability of heavy 
metals to the plant (Chen et al. 2017). Microorganisms and plants exhibit a symbiotic relationship, 
which makes the rhizosphere a very active microbial zone that has a dense population (Anderson 
et al. 1993; Anderson et al. 1994; Jordahl et al. 1997; Schwab et al. 1995; Siciliano and Germida 
1998). This is because plants have very deep and wide root systems that provide them the poten￾tial to degrade pollutants in the rhizosphere, which is triggered by enhancing microbial activity 
(Gerhardt et al. 2009). Meanwhile, phytoremediation is a very helpful, eco-friendly and cost￾effective technique, but it is somewhat slower in action than other methods of bioremediation as it 
requires a specific plant type, microbes, suitable weather and an appropriate growing season, which 
take time. Industries are discharging approximately ten million lethal chemical compounds every 
year (Avio et al. 2017; Alimi et al. 2018; Sousa et al. 2018; Thompson and Darwish 2019). Therefore, 
to enhance the phytoremediation process, a multi-interdisciplinary approach is needed that involves 
nanotechnology and other omics techniques to develop engineered plants with high hyperaccumu￾lating and remediation potential for environmental cleanup. The integration of nanotechnology with 
phytoremediation has proved to be a potential technique for the remediation of contaminated sites.
8.3 ROLE OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN PHYTOREMEDIATION
Nanotechnology is a very fast-growing and promising field of research that has a broad spectrum 
and applications. It has been found that nanotechnological approaches are more efficient than other 
traditional methods of remediation as nanoparticles have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio; 
hence, a larger quantity of the material can get in touch with nearby materials. A smaller size, 
superior physiochemical properties and the ability to form different shapes and sizes make them 
excellent tools for environmental cleanup (Baruah et al. 2019). Because they have a surface plas￾mon resonance property, nanoparticles can be used to detect toxic compounds. The green synthe￾ses of nanoparticles from plants and microorganisms have shifted the focus towards eco-friendly Nano-Phytoremediation & Omics for Environmental Cleanup 129
and cost-effective technology for the remediation of contaminants. Iron nanoparticles synthesized 
through a green route show their efficiency in remediation due to their redox potential while react￾ing with water (Bolade et al. 2020). Similarly, zinc oxide (ZnO), gold chloride (AuCl3), silver chlo￾ride (AgCl2) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles synthesized through a green route by using 
plants, fruit peels and vegetable extracts act as stabilizers and reducing agents to manage the growth 
of crystals (Elumalai and Velmurugan 2015; Mittal et al. 2013; Davar et al. 2015; Huo et al. 2017; 
Rosi and Kalyanasundaram 2018). Some of the potential nanoparticles that find great application in 
the phytoremediation process are depicted in Table 8.1. Figure 8.2 shows the application of nano￾technology in phytoremediation.
Phytoremediation efficiency can be enhanced by nanomaterials, and they can be used to remedi￾ate soil and water infected with organic, inorganic and heavy metal contamination. Several stud￾ies have found that nanoparticles have decontaminated organic pollutants including PCBs, PAHs, 
pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and solvents in soil (Crane and Scott 2012). 
Cd is one of the major pollutants that is widely released by industries, and it has been found that a 
number of nanoparticles improve its phytoextraction from soil. TiO2 nanoparticles showed a good 
response on Cd uptake in soybean plants (Singh and Lee 2016). Nanomaterials generally increase 
the bioavailability of materials by transporting them from the environment to a cell while they are 
taken up by plants (Su et al. 2013). Nanomaterials must be phytoavailable and adsorb the contami￾nants properly for the improved phytoavailability of contaminants to plants. Various researchers 
have found that a number of nanomaterials probably promote plant growth viz., Zn, Ag, nanopar￾ticles, graphene, carbon nanotubes and quantum dots. Graphene and quantum dots act as nanofer￾tilizers and pesticides (Chakravarty et al. 2015). The plant reproductive system has been activated 
by carbon nanotubes to thus help in fruit production (Khodakovskaya et al. 2013). Some functional 
nanoparticles enhance plant metabolism and create superior nitrogen uptake, thus supplementing 
chlorophyll activity and biomass production (Das et al. 2018). The utilization of Zn and P has 
been increased by ZnO nanoparticles without toxicity (Venkatachalam et al. 2017). Moreover, these 
FIGURE 8.2 Application of nanotechnology in bioremediation.130 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
nanoparticles also promote the growth and development of plants by improving the photosynthetic 
rate, osmolyte production and antioxidative defense system, in addition to helping chelate these 
toxic pollutants within the root rhizosphere (Pirzadah et al. 2020). Nanoparticles were found to 
be effective in endorsing the Pb phytoextraction competency by ryegrass (Liang et al. 2017). 
Improved phytoextraction has been shown in Lsatisca ppadocica by using salicylic acid nanopar￾ticles (Souri et al. 2017). In another study, it was reported that by providing nanoscale zero-valent 
iron (nZVI) particles, sunflower rhizosphere stabilized arsenic (Vıtkova et al. 2018). In addition, 
nanomaterials enhanced the phytoremediation of soil contaminated with trichloroethylene, endo￾sulfan and trinitrotoluene (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2012; Pillai and Kottekottil 2016; Ma and Wang 
2010). However, certain factors affect the nano-phytoremediation process and are depicted in Figure 
8.3. In nano-phytoremediation, some points must be considered: a) type of nanoparticle, b) toxicity 
of the nanoparticle, c) nanosystem should increase plant growth, biomass and plant height, d) nano￾system should increase plant enzymes, e) nanoparticles should enhance plant growth hormones,

f) nanoparticles must be capable of binding contaminants and increase their bioavailability to plants, 
g) nanoparticles should speed the phytoremediation process, f) plants should have a profound root 
system, g) plants should be tolerant of a higher concentration of contaminants, h) plants must be 
able to accumulate contaminants and i) plants should be fast-growing and have a high biomass rate. 
Many studies are being conducted in this field to improve the process of nano-phytoremediation by 
improving the features of nanoparticles, plants and microbes. Still, we need to focus on the interac￾tions among nanosystems, plants and the associated microorganisms to understand the mechanism 
of action, expression patterns and metabolic process for better results.
8.4 OMICS APPROACHES IN PHYTOREMEDIATION
Recent advances in the field of molecular biology have facilitated new approaches to find their 
applications for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in phytoremediation processes 
such as genomics, metagenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The emergence of next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinformatics tools have paved the way for environmental sci￾entists to explore more and solve the problems associated with the phytoremediation of environmen￾tal pollutants (Maphosa et al. 2010). Sequencing techniques and gene amplification have proved to 
be very helpful for assessing microbial population dynamics (Gołebiewski and Tretyn 2020). The 
gene sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA is a proficient and frequently used technology that is easily 
available through different bioinformatics tools for outlining a complicated microbial population 
(Han et al. 2020). Handelsman and colleagues first used metagenomics to understand the chemistry 
of undiscovered soil microorganisms (Handelsman et al. 1998). In this method, independent culture 
sequencing is performed based on DNA analysis, which is separated from environmental samples 
(Daniel 2005). Phylogenetic analysis of sequences gives trustworthy information concerning both 
FIGURE 8.3 Features affecting nano-phytoremediation.132 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
the diversity and function of the microbes. Several software tools are available to access metage￾nomics sequence data, which makes it easy to investigate metagenomic libraries (Dai et al. 2018). 
Transcriptome analysis is conducted by using microarray and sequencing technologies, where 
microarray helps to evaluate the expression of genes while next generation RNA sequencing helps 
to set the amount of RNA (Maroli et al. 2018). Omics technologies have revived the study of the 
catabolism of PAH and offer combined insight regarding the biochemical processes for the dilapi￾dation of PAH (Amrani et al. 2015). Possible transporters for phenols and upregulated degradation 
pathways have been found by using comparative transcriptomics to obtain a better accumulation 
and phenol tolerance through lipid accumulating Rhodococcus opacus PD630 (Yoneda et al. 2016). 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that have differentially expressed genes have been discovered by 
using transcriptome analysis for crude oil degradation (Das et al. 2020). Metabolites produced by 
the cells in reaction to changing environmental circumstances are analyzed by metabolomic studies 
that provide information regarding regulatory incidents in a cell; by using these metabolites as bio￾indicators, biological effects can be screened for pollutants for better insight into the environment 
(Krumsiek et al. 2015). It is well known that the microbial community is closely associated with the 
rhizosphere of plants and has a symbiotic association that promotes plant growth and development; 
thus, these microorganisms may enhance the process of phytoremediation by improving phytoex￾traction, rhizodegradation and the bioavailability of contaminants.
8.5 CRISPR/CAS9 TECHNOLOGY—A GENOME EDITING TOOL TO DESIGN 
ENGINEERED PLANTS WITH EFFICIENT PHYTOREMEDIATION POTENTIAL
CRISPR/Cas9 is a multipurpose gene editing tool that is used for amplifying chosen traits in plants 
through targeting extremely precise sequences of DNA (Wolt et al. 2016). It is a very promising tool 
of functional genomics (Perez-Pinera et al. 2013). The gene sequencing of plants can be changed 
by altering DNA using this technology to improve heavy metals detoxification and to increase the 
bioavailability of metals for plants via plant microbial interactions (Bortesi and Fischer 2015). It 
is reported that genes MTA1, MT1 and MT2 encoding metallothioneins when overexpressed in 
tobacco and Arabidopsis showed their increased ability to accumulate and stabilize Zn, Cu and Cd 
(Abhilash et al. 2012; Xia et al. 2012). MT2b gene expression in H. incana enhanced its ability for 
Pb tolerance and inflation. The genes APS and SMT, which are responsible for Se tolerance, have 
been transferred to B. juncea. Several organic contaminants such as PAHs, PCBs, and explosives 
including RDX and TNT can be detoxified by using this gene editing tool. Several studies revealed 
that plants have genes to detoxify organic xenobiotics (Banerjee and Roychoudhury 2019; Jaiswal 
et al. 2019). In plants, enzyme systems are accountable for the removal of contaminants that may 
be focused for their enrichment through CRISPR technology (Pandey and Singh 2019). Gene edit￾ing has been conducted in rice and Arabidopsis, which expressed tolerance against naphthalene 
and phenanthrene and were accountable for naphthalene dioxygenase production (Peng et al. 2014). 
Expression of the bph gene has been changed in alfalfa plants to enhance tolerance against PCBs 
and 2,4-dichlorophenol (Wang et al. 2015). CRISPR/Cas9 technology is an emerging tool to design 
engineered plants that could be used to remediate contaminated sites.
8.6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
Nano-phytoremediation is an emerging field for environmental cleanup, but it is currently in the 
infancy stage. Most of the current research is restricted to lab-scale and pot culture studies because 
of a difference in a number of parameters such as pH, temperature, soil texture, nutrients and other 
edaphic factors that play a vital role in the phytoremediation process. Plant-mediated synthesis of 
nanoparticles is a promising approach that could assist and enhance the phytoremediation potential 
of plants growing at contaminated sites. Although nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize 
the phytoremediation process, at the same time, the application of nanoparticles could lead to their Nano-Phytoremediation & Omics for Environmental Cleanup 133
deposition in the soil, and they could enter the food chain, which may be detrimental to human health 
and agricultural production. Therefore, using nanoparticles for remediation purposes should be seri￾ously debated by the scientific community. A comprehensive life cycle assessment of these engineered 
particles needs to be performed to ensure the safety of these materials. Thus, in employing nanotech￾nology in environmental cleanup on a commercial scale, scientists should focus on the pros and cons 
of this technology to prevent any potential hazardous environmental effects that they might cause.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
Water is the most plentiful and essential compound for all known forms of life, including humankind. 
Thus, it is vital to supply water to small and large cities and towns. Since water is directly connected 
with human welfare and its extent, water quality is the essential concern (Mishra et al., 2006). Globally 
increasing industrialization and urbanization causes damage to and contaminates natural water eco￾systems with their wastes. This may include different kinds of toxic pollutants such as domestic waste, 
industrial chemical waste, heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers, and many more, which create poten￾tially serious implications on human and animal health (Sankhla et al., 2016, 2018a, 2018b, 2019; 
Gulia et al., 2020). Waste contaminates water bodies and water channels or directly seeps into the soil 
itself, and from there, it enters the food chain and adversely affects human life directly or indirectly 
(Gupta et al., 2015). Nanotechnology is termed as the study, design, fabrication, and manipulation of 
resources at the nanometric scale, the transition scale among atoms and molecules to micro and bulk 
resources. At the nanoscale, materials exhibit different properties than the bulk state (Nanjwade 
et al., 2019; Devasahayam, 2019). Nanomaterial applications are not incomplete to cleansing; sensing 
rudiments such as probes have increased sensitivity and selectivity by applying nanomaterial probes 
in water monitoring devices. Although these applications are a part of nanotechnology, the green tech￾nology approach for sustainable development is also important. Nanotechnologies create immense 
environmental benefits in terms of water management and treatment through convalescing, filtering, 
decontamination, desalination, conservation, recycling, sewerage systems, and developing sensitive 
analytics or monitoring systems (Bhati and Rai, 2018). Phytoremediation is an effective technique to 
eliminate dangerous heavy metals from the polluted atmosphere. The term phytoremediation consists 
of the Greek prefix “phyto” which means plants that are attached to, and the Latin root medium means 
to correct or remove an evil (Tangahu et al., 2011). Because of the presence of many components in 
polluted water, toxic metals are sources of many diseases and effects in humans and plants (Rasheed 
et al., 2018). Phytoremediation comprises the approaches accepted by plants to neutralize soil, sludge, 
residue, and wastewater. Some of the recognized approaches of phytoremediation are phytoextraction; 
the elimination of heavy metal/toxic substances from soil/water; the phytotransformation/breakdown 
of organic contaminants; the phytovolatilization of contaminants taken up by tissue and then volatil￾ized into the environment; rhizofiltration, a technique of clarifying water concluded in a mass of roots; 
phytostimulation, which inspires microbial degradation in roots or plant parts; phytostabilization in 
which released composites upsurge microbial action in the rhizosphere; and phytoscreening where 
plants act like biosensors. Phytoremediation approaches are economical, can be functional in situ, and 
are solar-driven (Bhati and Rai, 2018).
9.2 WATER CONTAMINATION AND HEALTH IMPACTS
The occurrence of unwanted materials in water produces water contamination and water quality 
changes and creates an atmosphere very harmful to human health (Alrumman et al., 2016; Briggs, 
9Water Nano-Phytoremediation 139
2003). Water is a vital natural resource for intake and other developmental purposes in life (Bibi 
et al., 2016). All over the world, safe drinking water is essential for human health. As a universal 
solvent, water is a major source of infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
80% of syndromes are waterborne. The drinking water in various countries does not meet WHO 
standards (Khan et al., 2013; Sankhla et al., 2018b). Phytoremediation has used green florae and 
their related microorganisms, soil amendments, and agronomic methods to eliminate, absorb, or 
reduce offensive ecological contaminants. This occurs through the usage of living green florae 
and waste of the fruit/vegetal for the in-situ elimination or degradation of pollutants in soils, slurry 
residues, surface water, and groundwater. Phytoremediation allows cost-saving and solar energy￾driven attack methods. It is a lucrative method for remediation that involves plants metabolizing 
particles and reducing the damage to the environment. It is the usual aptitude of plants to accrue, 
degrade, or distillate pollutants from the soil, water, and air. Contaminants and poisonous metals 
are the main aims of phytoremediation. In recent studies, physiological and molecular mechanisms 
of phytoremediation have been designed to improve the phytoremediation process for environmen￾tal cleanup. It is also supportive of managing the utilization of food/vegetable/fruit waste (Srivastav 
et al., 2019). At the same time, an increase in urbanization has been observed, which affects the 
quality and availability of freshwater; meanwhile, the need for water for agriculture purposes, 
household consumption, and industrial use is also increasing. The result of this overuse is the deple￾tion and pollution of surface water and groundwater. In particular, waste is dumped into lakes and 
rivers, including untreated or partially treated municipal sewage, industrial poisons, and harmful 
chemicals that leach into surface and groundwater during these anthropological activities. Polluted 
water, water shortages, and unsanitary living might cause illnesses such as cholera, hepatitis A, dys￾entery, dengue, and malaria. These contaminants worsen the value of water even with remarkably 
low absorption and may instigate dangerous effects on human health, animals, plants, and aquatic 
organisms. Moreover, a significant amount of water is wasted because of inefficient irrigation sys￾tems, poor watershed management, and inappropriate agricultural subsidies (Hinrichsen and Tacio, 
2020). Meanwhile, an important food for many inhabitants of the globe is fish. Global per capita fish 
intake has increased to above 20 kg/year−1 (FAO, 2016). Most people who live near river banks are 
dependent on fish as a source of protein. In India, the annual per capita fish consumption is 5–6 kg 
for the general population and 8–9 kg for the fish-eating population, which is about 50% of global 
consumption (Salim, 2016). The current inland fish manufacture donates 6.57 million tonnes. The 
Ganga River provides extensive fish manufacture to its populations. The L. rohita, C. catla, and C. 
mrigala fish species originate in this watercourse. All of these fish are the main sources of protein 
for the people who live there. The health risks arising from the toxicity of metals mostly comprise 
kidney and emaciated injuries, neurological syndromes, endocrine distraction, cardiovascular dys￾function, and special carcinogenic effects (Renieri et al., 2019). Dietetic contact with numerous 
heavy metals has been recognized as a risk to human health through the intake of polluted food. 
Many heavy metals create an impasse with the sulfur existing in enzymes, thus disrupting their 
purpose (Renieri et al., 2019; Ali and Khan, 2018). Currently, the major and complex difficulty 
that directly adversely affects human health is air pollution. The growth of phytotechnologies for 
removing contaminants from the atmosphere to advance air excellence is obligatory for a quality 
life. Current studies are focused on mechanisms by which florae may constrain the air-polluted con￾taminants from the atmosphere. Because of anthropogenic actions, the attentiveness of rudiments 
and their composites is endlessly cumulative in soils. The physical examination and annihilation of 
all soil pollutants are expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, it is significant to distinguish 
the soil-polluted contact to avert the endorsement of pollutants from the soil to a plant (Henry et al., 
2013). Previous examinations examined the metal accretion in florae in the examination of hyperac￾cumulators; after that, the notion of consuming plants for the remediation method was advanced. 
Many researchers investigated other plant contaminant interactions, rhizosphere degradation, and 
the uptake of metals. The progression of research led to a full-scale phytoremediation process at 
various contaminated sites (Burken, 2001). Although plants may expel poisonous waste, there is a 140 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
chance of nanomaterials entering the food chain through these plants. The main challenge facing 
the nano-phytoremediation process is how to dispose of the accumulated heavy metals in plants, 
as they are considered toxic waste (Verma et al., 2021). Currently, most of the attention has been 
given to ecological issues, and a specific anxiety about safe food has developed that concludes with 
the appearance of various dangerous disorders. The maltreatment caused by heavy metal contami￾nation to agricultural activities is very illustrative. This concludes the food chain after which the 
contamination accumulates in the body, generating a dangerous risk to human vigor. The soil area 
contaminated by heavy metals in China is about 20 million hm2, accounting for 1/5 of the total 
refined terrestrial parts. Heavy metal soil contamination causes crop loss of over 10 million tons 
annually, and the loss of heavy metal-contaminated grains is about 12 million tons annually, with a 
yearly economic loss of over 20 billion (Wei and Chen, 2001).
9.3 REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED WATER
About 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, and about 95.6% of the Earth’s water is held 
by the oceans only. Water is a vital resource for human life. There are two kinds of water, namely, 
groundwater and natural water. Water is polluted due to human activities and industrialization, 
which further leads to causing disturbances in the ecosystem. The waste discharged from various 
industries contains both toxic and non-toxic metallic ions and is then dumped into water bodies 
leading to water pollution and many health effects for both humans and plants. Many harmful 
components present in polluted water are the source of many diseases in both plants and humans. 
The concentrations of toxic metals can be determined by using techniques such as atomic absorp￾tion spectroscopy (AAS) and some other chromatographic techniques. Among all methods, only 
AAS and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) provide effective outcomes. 
There are also many other biological, chemical, and physical methods for cleaning polluted water. 
After comparing all methods, phytoremediation is found to be more effective. This method is 
time-consuming, but it is the only permanent solution for the removal of contaminants compared 
to other methods (Jeevanantham et al., 2019). Excess use of pesticides is one of the greatest causes 
of water pollution, and its remains are a threat to the water supply and human health. Therefore, 
there is a need for a suitable approach for the remediation of such pesticides from drinking water 
(Romeh, 2020).
9.3.1 Nanoremediation
Materials having a size of 100 nm or less than 100 nm are known as nanomaterials. These materi￾als can be categorized into organic and inorganic nanoparticles. Organic nanoparticles are derived 
from dead organic matter such as potato and orange peelings, whereas inorganic nanoparticles 
comprise magnetic nanoparticles, noble metal nanoparticles, and semiconductor nanoparticles. 
Due to their specific size and brilliant properties, these nanomaterials have applications in manu￾facturing, medicine, energy, and electronics. Nanomaterials having magnetic properties are called 
magnetic nanomaterials and are widely used in remediation methods especially for the removing 
the contaminants from aqueous solutions due to their magnetic properties, less toxicity, high chemi￾cal stability, easy synthesis, and excellent recycling capability. Due to their unique structural and 
morphological features, carbon nanomaterials are considered excellent adsorbents for the removal 
of both organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater. These widely used nanomaterials are 
discharged into water resources and precipitate in river sediments. Nanomaterials’ main role is in 
shaping agriculture with the controlled release of nutrients, fertilizers, and pesticides to promote the 
growth of plants and prevent diseases.
The use of nanomaterials as alterations to fortify the method of phytoremediation is a new find￾ing that is holding environmental significance. The following characteristics should be present for 
the application of nanoparticles:Water Nano-Phytoremediation 141
 i. The nanoparticles should not be toxic.
 ii. Sorbents should have the capability of getting recycled infinitely.
iii. A low interaction between sorbents and contaminants should occur for the easy removal 
of contaminants later.
 iv. The nanoparticles should have high sorption capacity and selectivity (Jeevanantham et al., 
2019; Gong et al., 2019; Srivastav et al., 2019).
Nanomaterial-assisted phytoremediation comprises plants, pollutants, and nanomaterials. Nano￾materials can make phytoremediation better by directly acting through the redox and reactions or 
adsorption of both plants and pollutants. A number of studies have found the application of nano￾materials to be very beneficial in plant systems for plant protection, nutrition, and the recognition 
of plant diseases and contaminants. It has been found that approximately 40% of the contributors 
prefer carbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, liposomes, and organic polymers, as 
well as titanium dioxide, silica, and alumina nanomaterials (Srivastav et al., 2019). The application 
of nanoparticles is clean, non-toxic, eco-friendly, quick, and cost-effective and has the features of 
dynamic morphology, the required dimensions, and the desired nature for the treatment of waste￾water. This green technology is a new approach, and from a technical point of view, it is economi￾cally sustainable and reliable, but the techniques are still developing in the fields of fabrication 
mechanism, regeneration, and reusability (Bhati and Rai, 2018). Chlorfenapyr poses a considerable 
risk to the ecosystem and to the reproductive ability of birds. The implementations of green nano￾technology and phytoremediation by Plantago major have a significant role in soil remediation and 
water polluted with chlorfenapyr. By using Plantago major and nanoparticles supported by charcoal, 
chlorfenapyr was removed rapidly. This approach is environment friendly, time-efficient, and 
less expensive and comprises bio-organic compound coatings that can be used for multiple pur￾poses. Studies have found that nanoparticles such as gold (Ag) and iron (Fe) can remediate contami￾nants such as heavy metals, pesticides, nitro-aromatic compounds, and nitrates (Ali et al., 2020).
9.3.2 Phytoremediation
There are many physical, biological, and chemical approaches for the removal of pollutants in pol￾luted water. Comparing all of these methods, the phytoremediation approach has been found to be 
very significant and appropriate for pollutant removal by using plants. In this remediation method, 
plants are allowed to grow in the contaminated area, and during their growth, the plants will absorb 
the heavy metals from the soil and water. In this remediation approach, the mechanism that takes 
place changes the contaminated metals into a non-hazardous form, ultimately making the environ￾ment toxic-free. Two types of contaminants are present in the environment, specifically, organic and 
inorganic pollutants, and they are detoxified in several ways. Microbes are added to promote the 
growth of plants to let them survive for a longer time and to increase the tolerance of plants in the 
contaminated area; this is even possible in saltwater (Jeevanantham et al., 2019). Phytoremediation 
is an eco-friendly and low-cost in-situ remediation method for the removal of heavy metals from 
contaminated areas to treat contaminated sediments such as cadmium-polluted sediments (Gong 
et al., 2019). Over recent years, the increased deposition of hazardous metals and pollutants in soil 
has been found due to increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities. Many approaches 
and techniques have been established to decrease soil pollution. Among these, phytoremediation 
is a popular bioremediation technique that is inexpensive and simple, with an esthetic appearance, 
broad compliance, less damage to the soil configuration, and a high acceptance. This technique has 
been successfully implemented worldwide and has a broad global market. Many other techniques 
including agronomic management, treatment with chemical additives, the addition of rhizospheric 
microorganisms, and genetic engineering are also introduced to improve phytoremediation effec￾tiveness. Currently, nanotechnology is bringing more novel ideas to the phytoremediation of pol￾luted soil. This approach uses plants to remove the contaminants present in the environment such as 142 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
air, water, soil, and sediments. Heavy metal pollution is a serious issue and a significant challenge 
to human health and food protection across the world. Studies have found that this approach of phy￾toremediation could be further improved for the remediation of soil polluted with heavy metals such 
as cadmium, lead, nickel, and zinc by applying nanomaterials (Song et al., 2019).
9.3.2.1 Mechanism of Phytoremediation
A number of mechanisms are involved in tropical plants for their metal or mineral uptake in the 
remediation of pollutants to convert them into non-hazardous substances, and they vary accordingly, 
for example, organic and inorganic, as shown in Figure 9.1. The mechanism followed by plants for 
remediation comprises phytoextraction, phytotransformation, phytodegradation, phytostabilization, 
phytostimulation, phytovolatilization, and rhizodegradation, as described in Figures 9.2 and 9.3.
9.3.2.1.1 Phytoextraction
The capability of plants to absorb contaminants into their roots and translocate the contaminants 
above to the shoot system is known as phytoextraction. Briefly, this process is the removal of con￾taminants from either groundwater or surface water and soil by using live plants. The plants selected 
for this process should have the following characteristics for the phytoextraction mechanism:
• Tolerance to high concentration metals,
• High metal holding potential in the shoot tissues,
• Great biomass,
• Rapid growth capability, and
• Abundant root system.

FIGURE 9.2 The mechanism of phytoremediation.
FIGURE 9.3 List of the various mechanisms in the phytoremediation method.144 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
9.3.2.1.2 Phytodegradation
This method includes the metabolic breakdown of organic pollutants by the enzyme cofactors or 
plant enzymes and then eliminating these pollutants. The enzymes found are dehalogenase, nitrore￾ductase, peroxidase, laccase, and nitrilase in the soil and plant sediments.
9.3.2.1.3 Phytostabilization
Phytostabilization is a mechanism of phytoremediation comprising the decline of heavy metals’ 
mobility by reducing the bioavailability or solubility.
9.3.2.1.4 Phytovolatilization
In this mechanism, plants transform a pollutant into a volatile state and then eliminate this pollutant 
from the polluted sites of soil or water. It is a natural phenomenon in plants to evaporate any pollut￾ant or contaminant uptake through their root system, which is developed as a natural air stripping 
pump system. Then, these volatile pollutants diffuse from the plant into the atmosphere through the 
open stomata. The processes such as plant uptake, phytovolatilization, and metabolic conversion 
may be applicable to a few plants and organic chemicals. For some hydrophilic compounds such as 
acetone and phenol, the mechanism of phytovolatilization and direct volatilization are moderate. 
To the contrary, this mechanism of volatilization is considered a significant elimination method for 
volatile hydrophobic compounds, for example, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) 
compounds, lower chlorinated benzene, and ethenes.
9.3.2.1.5 Rhizodegradation
This is a biological treatment of pollutants through enriched bacterial and fungal action in the 
rhizosphere of some vascular plants. The rhizosphere is a region present at the root of legumes 
that has increased microbial activity and density. There is a symbiotic association between plants 
and microorganisms that increases the microbial activity in the root zone. Plant roots are usually 
dispersed miles away per acre, and this signifies the capability of contaminant reduction in the 
rhizosphere. There is a deposition of about 10–50% of plant photosynthate, that is, sugars, organic 
acids, and larger organic compounds in soil. The essential component of phytoremediation, namely, 
rhizoremediation, which occurs naturally, can be further enhanced by the addition of particular 
contaminant-degrading microbes or plant growth-promoting microorganisms.
9.3.2.1.6 Phytoscreening
This mechanism of phytoremediation involves the use of plants as sensors to indicate pollutant lev￾els on the subsurface level. This mechanism is simple, non-invasive, and less expensive. (Srivastav 
et al., 2019; Bhati and Rai, 2018).
9.3.2.1.7 Phytostimulation
This mechanism of phytoremediation involves the microbial stimulation in the root region by the 
various activities of plants.
9.4 NANOTECHNOLOGY AND PHYTOREMEDIATION: 
NANO-PHYTOREMEDIATION
The process of cleaning and removing contaminants, or decontamination, from the environment 
and related various ecosystems is referred to as remediation. Remediation protects the soil, air, 
groundwater, sediments, and surface water and is associated with protecting human beings from the 
threat of damage. The application of plants and their accumulating features for the purpose of reme￾diation is known as phytoremediation. Meanwhile, reactive nanomaterials are used for the transfor￾mation and detoxification of various environmental contaminants. Nanotechnology allows for more 
selective, cost-effective, and sensitive remediation tools (Karn et al., 2009). Nano-phytoremediation Water Nano-Phytoremediation 145
FIGURE 9.4 Nano-phytoremediation: The phytoremediation of contaminants using nanomaterials.
is employed to remediate environmental contaminants by applying both nanotechnology and phy￾totechnology together. That is, nano-phytoremediation is a technique of detoxifying and decon￾taminating environmental contaminants by using both nanotechnology and phytotechnology. 
Sometimes, the application of nano-phytoremediation is more effective than applying the individual 
techniques of nano-remediation or phytoremediation (Ingle et al., 2014; Srivastav et al., 2019).
9.4.1 Selection of Plant Species for Nano-Phytoremediation
The feasible plant species for the nano-phytoremediation of contaminated water depends on sev￾eral external factors such as the type of water and the quality of contaminants present in it. The 
plants utilized for nano-phytoremediation of contaminated water should have the following features 
(Ahmadpour, 2012; Jasrotia et al., 2017; Srivastav et al., 2019):
• A fast and specific growth rate in contaminated water,
• High root-shoot elongation, plant height, and productivity of biomass;
• A widespread and branched root system with a large root surface area and a large specific 
surface area of the other portion that is in contact with water,
• High translocation potential,
• High tolerance or accumulation potential for a variety of contaminants,
• Easy to harvest depending on the use of the sink organ,
• High hyperaccumulation potential for contaminants mainly in the aboveground parts,
• Susceptible and sensitive to genetic modification, and
• Non-consumable by humans and animals.
9.4.2 Ideal Nanoparticle Features for Nano-Phytoremediation
Several nanomaterials have been designed and employed for the purpose of environmental remedia￾tion and clean-up. The significant features of nanomaterials such as a large surface area, and con￾sequently, a higher reactivity than their bulk form, and the potential to penetrate contaminated sites 
make them an ideal component of the remediation process (Davis et al., 2017). Some ideal features 
of nanomaterials (Figure 9.3) are especially employed for nano-phytoremediation (Jeevanantham 
et al., 2019; El-Ramady et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020).146 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
9.4.3 Factors Influencing the Nano-Phytoremediation of Contaminants
The process of nano-phytoremediation depends on several factors including the nature of the 
nanoparticle, the plant species and its physiology, and the interaction between the nanomaterial 
and contaminants. Moreover, the size, morphology, type of nanomaterial, and chemical composi￾tion have a special influence on nano-phytoremediation. The presence of other organisms, such 
as bacteria and fungi, influences the plant uptake of nanoparticles (Feng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 
2016). Recent advancements and new perspectives of nano-phytoremediation nanomaterial surface 
functionalization and coating are determining factors for the penetration of nanomaterials into plant 
tissue (Judy et al., 2012; Raliya et al., 2016; Mohammadi et al., 2019). The factors affecting nano￾phytoremediation are as follows (Srivastav et al., 2019):
• Physical and chemical properties of the contaminants, for example, their reactivity, toxic￾ity, water-solubility, flexibility, type of bonds, vapor pressure, mobility, molecular weight, 
and hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions,
• Environmental factors such as pH, oxygen level, light, temperature, micro-organisms, and 
toxic components, 
• Plant characteristics such as the plant species, its root system, a high growth rate, large pro￾ductivity, enzymes, the potential for tolerance, and the accumulation of contaminants, and
• The structure, composition, size, shape, concentration, surface activity, and physical and 
chemical properties of the nanomaterials.
9.5 ADVANTAGES OF NANO-PHYTOREMEDIATION
Nanotechnology has the potential for environmental monitoring and remediation without harming 
nature by using eco-friendly and green technology approaches (Srivastav et al., 2019). Along with 
the purification and removal of contaminants from various ecosystems, nanotechnology also aids 
in the probe-like sensing of water contaminants with high sensitivity and selectivity. Therefore, 
nanomaterial probes have been successfully employed as water monitoring devices. The use of 
FIGURE 9.5 Ideal features of nanoparticles designed for nano-phytoremediation.Water Nano-Phytoremediation 147
FIGURE 9.6 Advantages of nano-phytoremediation.
nanotechnologies, along with phytoremediation, has provided immense environmental benefits, 
particularly the decontamination of water systems. This technology of nano-phytoremediation is 
significantly involved in water biomonitoring, management, and treatment by convalescing, filter￾ing, decontamination, desalination, conservation, recycling, and sewerage systems and by develop￾ing sensitive analytics or monitoring systems. Nano-phytoremediation includes the potential adopted 
by plants and nanomaterials to decontaminate soil, sludge, sediment, and wastewater (Bhati and 
Rai, 2018). Phytoremediation has the potential for environmental monitoring, detoxification, and 
decontamination with effective efficiency, eco-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. However, this 
technique is entirely influenced by the plant species, contaminant bioavailability, water quality, 
and weather conditions. Therefore, phytoremediation is a time-consuming and seasonal technique 
that is limited by the plant species and bioavailability of contaminants in water (Song et al., 2019). 
These limitations can be fulfilled with the help of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles increase the phy￾toremediation efficiency of plants through nanoparticles’ versatile and nano nature such as their 
dynamic morphology, desired size, superparamagnetic behavior, and high saturation magnetiza￾tion. These characteristics of nanoparticles make them effective for the remediation of various water 
ecosystems including groundwater and wastewater treatment (WWT). Nanomaterials provide green 
techniques for water environment biomonitoring and decontamination with their non-toxic, cost￾effective, eco-friendly, and less time-consuming approach (Bhati and Rai, 2018).
9.6 ROLE OF NANOPARTICLES IN PHYTOREMEDIATION
9.6.1 Plant Growth
Phytoremediation is a very effective, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and popular technique of envi￾ronmental remediation. This technique is also user-friendly, less damaging to analytical systems, 
and universally accepted, with an esthetic appearance and wide adaptability (Macek et al., 2000; 
Glick, 2003; Gong et al., 2018). Phytoremediation has been designed and greatly utilized for the 
remediation of sites and ecosystems polluted by radionuclides, heavy metals, crude oil, chlori￾nated solvents, pesticides, and explosives (Sharma and Pandey, 2014; Dubchak and Bondar, 2019). 
Phytoremediation technologies used for the remediation of water contamination include rhizofiltra￾tion, phytodegradation, phytostabilization, photodegradation, phytoextraction, and phytovolatiliza￾tion (Sakakibara et al., 2010). This method uses the metabolic system of plants for the uptake of 148 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
pollutants from their surroundings and accumulates them in the plant biomass or organs. Moreover, 
in other cases, the branched roots of plants remove the contaminants in water by sorbing them 
(Hanks et al., 2015). Aquatic plants are the primary stage of the aquatic food web and contribute to a 
large portion of primary productivity in their ecosystem. Several aquatic plants have the potential to 
rapidly produce large quantities of biomass. Furthermore, many of them have been reported to grow 
rapidly in the presence of contaminants in water. Several aquatic plants have a hyperaccumulator 
capacity of metal uptake and accumulation; therefore, they have the ability to remediate water and 
sediment contaminated with metals (Kaewtubtim et al., 2017b).
9.6.2 Phytoavailability of Contaminants
The physicochemical factors such as metal speciation, soil pH and texture, organic matter and clay 
content, cation exchange capacity, and soil’s redox status determine the bioavailability of metals to 
plants (Planquart et al., 1999; Notten et al., 2005). Phytoremediation is a green and environmen￾tally friendly technology for environmental remediation. Several types of plants act as significant 
hyperaccumulators and play a major role in contaminant uptake from groundwater, surface water, 
and sediment. Phytoremediation has been employed for the remediation of water contaminated with 
organic compounds, heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, and toxic chemicals such as 
trichloroethylene, ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), xylene, and radio￾nuclides. Although, phytotechnology is cost-effective and environmentally friendly compared with 
other technologies, it is a long-term treatment technology and takes comparatively more time for 
remediation (Paquin et al., 2004).
9.6.3 Nano-Phytoremediation of Contaminated Water
The nano-phytoremediation technique can be successfully employed for the remediation of 
wastewater, sludge, sediment, groundwater, and surface water. The desired size, superparamag￾netic behavior, high saturation magnetization value, and dynamic morphology of phytogenic 
magnetic nanoparticles (PMNPs) play a significant role in water treatment and WWT. This eco￾friendly technology is more suitable than other methods and is economically sustainable. The 
optimization of fabrication protocol solution parameters such as the solvent type, pH, extract 
volume, physical parameters including temperature, and strength of the precursor is required 
for the development of such PMNPs. The stability of PMNPs after pollutant removal and the 
yielding biomass separation can be enhanced by improving the morphology of the particles. The 
long-term health impact and sustainability of using such techniques are still under study (Ali 
et al., 2013, 2017).
9.6.3.1 Remediation of Groundwater and Freshwater Ecosystems
Polluted aquatic environments are a growing concern regarding the health of associated aquatic 
organisms, plants, microorganisms, and consequently, the whole food chain, which are ultimately 
posing a risk for ecosystems and human health (Batayneh, 2012). Carbon nanotubes have been 
significantly employed for the remediation of contaminated water in recent years due to their 
unique adsorption properties and their affinity towards the target analyte (Savage and Diallo, 
2005). Efforts for decreasing the release of pollutants and minimizing their effects as mediated 
by living organisms such as plants are approached with the phytoremediation technique (Pilon￾Smits, 2005; Conesa et al., 2012). This is the best solution for pollution control and the most effec￾tive technology that uses biological systems for the treatment of contaminants (Dua et al., 2002; 
Cardenas et al., 2008). Bioremediation is eco-friendly and utilizes natural biological processes 
to remove toxic pollutants. This technique employs microorganisms and their enzymes to reme￾diate the environment altered by pollutants and restore it to its original condition (Kensa, 2011; 
Chakraborty et al., 2012).Water Nano-Phytoremediation 149
9.6.3.1.1 Removal of Inorganic Contaminants
The remediation efficiency and decontamination potential of phytoremediation can be boosted 
with the gene manipulation of plants by enhancing their anti-oxidative enzyme systems (Mani and 
Kumar, 2014; Gomes et al., 2016). The modified or transferred genes in wild plants can improve the 
homeostasis mechanisms towards metal stress (Antosiewicz et al., 2014). Some plants can uptake 
and accumulate various inorganic environmental contaminants, which depends on their phytore￾mediation potential (Islam et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2019). Phytoremediation processes are directly 
associated with photosynthetic mechanisms and sequestering pollutants into the above-ground 
organs of the same plant (Pietrini et al., 2009; Kofroňová et al., 2018; Lima et al., 2019; Tang 
et al., 2019). Due to various pollutant doses and accumulation, the photosynthesis process in hyper￾accumulators becomes affected by impacting the phytoremediation mechanisms such as phytoex￾traction, phytodegradation, phytostabilization, and rhizofiltration (Pietrini et al., 2009).
9.6.3.1.2 Removal of Organic Contaminants
Hazardous organic contaminants have been identified as significant causative agents of environ￾mental degradation. Organic xenobiotics can harm environmental quality and affect the food chain 
by impacting the health of its biotic components (Tang et al., 2019; Hussain et al., 2009; Kang, 
2014). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have a high affinity for fatty acids, and consequently, 
they resist photochemical degradation (Rai, 2018a; Hussain et al., 2009). Such POPs with high tox￾icity also possess the tendency not only for bioaccumulation but also for biomagnification across 
different trophic levels (Lima et al., 2019; Matteucci et al., 2015; Hussain et al., 2009). Chlorinated 
organics are particularly persistent in human environments, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 
is also utilized as a raw material for insecticides in the agriculture sector (Husain et al., 2018; 
Hussain et al., 2009). Organophosphates such as paraoxon and parathion are a class of pesticides 
that are neurotoxic in nature and have the capability to degrade acetylcholinesterase; consequently, 
they pose serious health risks by perturbing systematic nerve transmission (Fernández et al., 2017). 
Moreover, pesticides, petroleum, explosives, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and their deriva￾tives are common organic pollutants in both the soil and water, and it is crucial to decontaminate 
such affected sites (Martin et al., 2016).
9.6.3.2 Wastewater Treatment (WWT)
Phytoremediation is an organic method that eliminates pollutants from a water resource by uti￾lizing plant life. This procedure applies the plant’s metabolic structure to remove pollutants and 
nutrients from their neighboring areas and stock these in its biomass. Perfect plants for phytore￾mediation need great root structures, as the root extent determines the closeness of the plant 
parts that can interrelate with the polluted water resources. To guarantee the active elimination 
of metals and pollutants from an aquatic source, the florae that work in phytoremediation must 
be copious metal and nutrient accumulators that will attain real pollutant exclusion. These flo￾rae require rapid duplication to ensure that the scheme for water remediation is self-sufficient, 
therefore reducing the treatment expenditure (Kang, 2014). These plants are presently employed 
in numerous parts of the world for heavy metal water purification drives and have shown hopeful 
outcomes in the elimination of silver and other metal ions from polluted water resources (Harris 
and Bali, 2008; Odjegba and Fasidi, 2004). However, few studies are available that assesses the 
efficiency of these plants at eliminating metal nanoparticles from a water source compared to 
their ionic counterparts.
9.7 CHALLENGES OF NANO-PHYTOREMEDIATION
Nanomaterial-aided phytoremediation studies are very rare. Only small-scale experiments have 
been conducted to date, so there is a requirement to use extra-accurate revisions in upcoming stud￾ies, and better strategies at the practical stage are highly required. Long-standing tests are needed 150 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
to understand the real effects of nanomaterials in phytoremediation procedures and in the altera￾tion of the soil productiveness status. Nanomaterials can cumulate this and may decrease their 
movement, so polymer or other coverings are needed to improve their bioavailability or flexibil￾ity. An assessment of the influences and security of nanomaterial implementation in polluted soil 
is needed. Maintainable nano-phytoremediation relies primarily on climatological circumstances; 
thus, ecologically unchanging nanomaterials should be recognized (Gupta et al., 2012). Nano￾phytoremediation is a suitable technique for places that have average amounts of contamination due 
to unmaintainable plant development in an extremely polluted land. An improved understanding 
of pollutant acceptance by plants from the soil will also help in stimulating agro-mining, which 
could be utilized to remove pollutants even from harvestable plant biomass. Nano-phytoremediation 
includes both nanotechnology and phytoremediation collectively to clean up the atmosphere. 
Nanomaterials are extensively used currently in the arenas of make-up, dyes, drugs, and fabrics. 
Nanotechnology increases phytoremediation’s efficacy, and nanoparticles can also be utilized to 
remedy soils and water that are polluted with metals and inorganic and organic contaminants. The 
current research has showcased that carbon-based pollutants, including chlorpyrifos, moline, and 
atrazine, can be tarnished with nano-sized zerovalent irons. Nanoparticles in enzyme-dependent 
bioremediation can also be used in a mixture with phytoremediation (Srivastav et al., 2019; Yadav 
et al., 2017b). Numerous nanomaterials have been technologically advanced for ecological utili￾zation. Nanomaterials are beneficial for remediation procedures due to their large surface area; 
hence, such resources are more sensitive than their bulk form, and they can effortlessly enter pol￾luted locations (Singh and Walker, 2006). The usage of nanomaterials for ecological remediation 
is rapidly developing. Iron nanomaterials are the most extensively utilized for remedy purposes. 
Some academics have found that nanomaterials disinfect organic contaminants (PPCPs, PAHs, 
PCBs, and carbon-based solvents) in land (Davis et al., 2017). According to Cooley et al. (2012) and 
Jiamjitrpanich et al. (2013), a mixture of nanotechnology and phytotechnology for TNT remediation 
from land is more operative than land without nanomaterials. Nanomaterials not only unswervingly 
catalyze the reduction of excess and deadly supplies but also help recover the efficacy of micro￾organisms in the degradation of waste and toxic materials. Bioremediation uses living organisms 
to break up or eliminate poisons and damaging materials from farming water and soil. Thus, with 
bioremediation, heavy metals can be separated from water and soil ecologically and profession￾ally by microbes (Jiamjitrpanich et al., 2013). Nano-structured materials, such as polyacrylic acid, 
zeolite, chitosan, hydroxyapatite, and clay minerals, are utilized to advance enrichers to be used for 
soil and/or foliar utilization. The greater surface area of hydroxyapatite and its strong connections 
with urea lead to the slow release of nitrogen (N) from urea (Dixit et al., 2015). Urea modified with 
hydroxyapatite nanoparticles release N for up to 60 days of plant growth compared to other con￾ventional fertilizers (urea and ammonium nitrate), which release N till 30 days (Dixit et al., 2015). 
Kottegoda et al. (2011) described an increase in the chlorophyll content of soybeans by using super￾paramagnetic iron oxide. A 10% increase in chlorophyll content was measured in cowpea (Vigna 
unguiculata (L. Walp.)) by applying iron (Fe) nanoparticles on foliage as a 0.5 g L−1 solution com￾pared with the same solution of common forms of Fe (Ghafariyan et al., 2013). Phytoremediation 
is a skill that uses plants and the related rhizosphere microbes to eliminate, alter, or cover toxic 
substances situated in soils, residues, surface water, groundwater, and even air (Karami et al., 2014). 
Numerous species of florae are utilized for the action or elimination of a diversity of pollutants, 
for example, radionuclides, chlorinated solvents, explosives, oil, nutrients, metals, and pesticides. 
The phyto-toxicity of the contaminants can disturb the phytoremediation procedure as florae that 
tolerate the occurrence of extreme quantities of toxic mixtures are more vulnerable to illnesses and 
stress circumstances (Susarla et al., 2002; Gulia et al., 2020). A particular type of phytoremediation 
grounded on swamp plants rising in a soil or grit substrate, usually known as constructed wetland 
systems (CWs), has been observed as a promising method for the elimination of drugs from waste￾water (Datta et al., 2013; Matamoros and Bayona, 2006). The elimination of ecological pollutants 
(including heavy metals) from polluted sites using nanoparticles/nanomaterial shaped by fungi, Water Nano-Phytoremediation 151
plant, and bacteria with the assistance of nanotechnology is called nano-bioremediation (NBR). 
NBR is a novel upcoming method for the elimination of contaminants through ecological clean￾ing. The present methodologies for the remediation of polluted locations are physical and chemical 
remediation, incineration, and bioremediation, which have their own benefits and drawbacks. With 
new progressions, bioremediation offers an ecologically approachable and sparingly practicable 
choice to eliminate pollutants from the atmosphere (Singh and Walker, 2006).
9.8 CONCLUSION
Nano-phytoremediation is a very effective technique and can be successfully employed for the reme￾diation of various types of contaminants from aquatic ecosystems. Although several studies have 
been conducted over the utilization of different nanomaterials, typically nanoparticles and nanotubes 
coupled with the technique of phytoremediation, limited studies have been conducted concerning 
the nano-phytoremediation of water and sediments. As with a number of processes in phytoreme￾diation, nano-phytoremediation can also involve processes such as nono-phytostabilization, nano￾phytofiltration, nano-phytovolatilization, nano-phytoextraction, and nano-phytovolatilization. As 
aquatic plants are the base of the aquatic food chain, there is a need to analyze the toxicity of com￾ponents produced during nano-phytoremediation.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
Human beings have been striving for the development of products and lifestyles that assures maxi￾mum facilitation (Jaffri and Ahmad 2020b). In such efforts aimed at the attainment of excellence in 
lifestyle and the fulfillment of the demands of human survival, many synthetic chemicals have been 
added to ecological settings, in addition to the inherently present chemicals, for example, heavy 
metals, in the environment. With the passage of time, as we are advancing towards a modernized 
and urbanized form of globalization, the contamination of different environmental compartments 
has been augmenting in a consequential manner (Jaffri and Ahmad 2018d; Jaffri et al. 2019b). In 
this regard, all aspects of the environment are at stake, inclusive of the hydrospheric, atmospheric 
and lithospheric regions. However, since the lithosphere is an immediately available base for the 
reception of different types of pollutants, its exposure and contamination is therefore comparatively 
higher than that of other compartments. Another considerable factor here is the transboundary 
nature of different pollutants and contaminants. This is true in terms not only of the geographical 
transferal of the pollutants but also of the transport of pollutants from one ecological compartment to 
another (Naeem et al. 2020). For instance, agrochemicals can be transferred to the soils where 
they are employed on crops, but there is a chance of the residues and daughter products of these 
agrochemicals to be transferred to the atmosphere via volatilization or leaching to groundwater 
reservoirs to cause a disturbance in the overall ecological functioning (Iram et al. 2020b, 2020a).
The contamination of the pedospheric region is not limited to only agrochemicals, and there are 
a variety of other anthropogenic sources, for example, waste produced from industries. In addition, 
numerous other human activities are responsible for the release of contaminants in soils, including 
nutrients, solvents, organic and inorganic substances and heavy metals (Iram et al. 2018; Shazia 
et al. 2018). The pedospheric zone of the environment is representative of the most important 
functionalities that it carries out in terms of supporting the life of the floral and faunal species 
residing inside and over it, production of food for various species, storage of carbon and acting as 
a carbon sink, purification of water, and conservation of biological diversity (Shaheen et al. 2016; 
Zahra et al. 2017). Such significant functionalities of soils are expressive of their essential nature 
for humans and other forms of biological diversity. Therefore, safer and healthier soils constitute 
an integral part of sustainable development for human society (Jaffri et al. 2019a). However, to our 
dismay, soils on a global scale are under a constant serious threat due to the enhanced extent of 
urbanization and the industrial and agricultural orientations being dependent on the utilization of 
synthetic chemicals for higher output (Tahir et al. 2020a, 2020b). Recent decades have especially

seen an exhausting trend in the release of such contaminants in soils through different activities. 
These chemicals are marked not only by their noxiousness towards human and other floral/faunal 
forms of biodiversity but also by their equal damage to environmental integrity (Amjad et al. 2019; 
Ali et al. 2019a).
The problem of the degradation and contamination of soils has adverse impacts on the agri￾cultural productivity and security of food. Degradation of soils is further worsened by the occur￾rence of other factors, such as the reduced fertility of soils, overgrazing and erosion. The global 
significance of soils and their essentiality in overall global functioning makes their remediation 
an urgent task (Iram et al. 2019; Ishtiaq et al. 2020). A myriad of physical, chemical and biologi￾cal approaches have been adopted for the remediation of soils and restoration of their ecological 
integrity. However, all kinds of methods have been known for their limitations and adoption at 
the field level. Such limitations identify the efforts to be exerted to improve these methods for the 
effective remediation of soils (Iftikhar et al. 2019). Biological methods are preferred over chemi￾cal and physical ones due to their eco-friendliness, facile nature and economic viability (Okaiyeto 
et al. 2021). In contrast to the chemical methods where synthetic substances further deteriorate 
environmental quality and the physical methods characterized by the need for complicated execu￾tional requirements, biological methods are actually based on the utilization of nature’s tools for 
the sustainable remediation of soils.
Nanoscience and nanotechnology are known for nanoscale materials possessing unique charac￾teristics, which have revolutionized human life in recent decades. A great deal of nanomaterial-based 
products have been developed using different types, morphologies and size ranges of nanomaterials 
aimed at human welfare (Shaheen et al. 2021; Ahmad et al. 2020). For instance, nanomaterials have 
now become part of our lives in the form of drug delivery agents, pesticides’ nano-encapsulation, 
medical diagnostic materials and pharmaceuticals. The unique characteristics associated with nano￾materials in contrast to their bulk counterparts make them further attractive for initialization in 
various applications ranging from biomedical employments and photovoltaics to agriculture and 
environmental remediation.
In terms of environmental remediation, these nanoparticles have been extensively used for the 
detoxification of persistent organic pollutants, including dyes (Cittrarasu et al. 2021; Uribe-López 
et al. 2021). The recent era has also seen the utilization of these nanomaterials in improving agricul￾tural productivity by the development of these nanomaterials into different products, for example, 
nano-pesticides (El Gohary et al. 2021), nano-fertilizers (Ahmadian et al. 2021) and nano-sensors 
(Verma et al. 2021). Nanomaterials can be altered through modifications in the synthesis route 
and manipulation at different scales, including the atomic, molecular, macromolecular and micro￾molecular scales; therefore, they are often referred to as engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) or just 
nanoparticles (NPs) (Tahir et al. 2020a, 2020b; Afsheen et al. 2020). In a more advanced manner, 
environmentalists and other members of the scientific community in the present era have been incul￾cating novel materials that have dimensions less than 100 nm and are referred to as nanomaterial 
inside biological methods for effective remediation. In this collaborative approach, nanomaterials 
in close association with hyper-accumulator plants detoxify soil matrices in an eco-friendly man￾ner; thus, this concept of “nano-phytoremediation” is gaining further interest among the scientific 
community (Romeh and Saber 2020). Phytoremediation is an effective phyto-technology and an 
extension of bioremediation that is highly appreciated due to its cost effectiveness, facile operation, 
wide-scale adaptability and aesthetic appeal, and it has also been publicly accepted on several occa￾sions (Dal Ferro et al. 2021). Therefore, the research on phytoremediation has been ongoing, result￾ing in further advancements aimed at the detoxification of soil matrices from various toxic and 
persistent pollutants, such as chlorinated solvents, heavy metals, explosive materials, agrochemi￾cals, radionuclides and crude oil (Moradi et al. 2021; Yan et al. 2021). The success stories based on 
the utilization of the phytoremediation technique through field trials have further encouraged the 
scientific community to adopt this method on a global scale, and numerous such cases have been 
reported (Amjad et al. 2021).158 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
The utilization of ENMs and NPs in association with phytoremediation is seen as an effective 
solution for the detoxification of the environment. However, some critical analyses also consider 
this advancement in terms of impacting the overall health of soils in different indigenous eco￾systems (Shrivastava et al. 2019). There has been an increment in the concerns over the health 
implications of these ENMs and NPs if utilized for pedospheric detoxification, inclusive of the 
impacts on the sub-surficial environment and ecological settings of soils (O’Connor and Hou 2018). 
However, the greater efficiencies obtained for such nano-phytoremediation approaches make them 
worthy of utilization after proper optimization for the concerns raised. Nano-phytoremediation can 
be successfully engineered for optimum output without impacting plant germination, roots/shoots 
development, microbial species growth, maturation and metabolic activities and non-target species, 
and the contaminants do not obtain access to the food chain (Chen et al. 2018). Therefore, during 
field application processes, such considerations need to be taken into account to derive the maxi￾mum benefit from nano-phytoremediation. The potential of nano-phytoremediation for the pedo￾spheric matrix cannot be overlooked and thus needs to be studied comprehensively by considering 
a variety of NPs and plants (Liu et al. 2018). Although some research has been conducted using 
nano-phytoremediation for the detoxification of the pedospheric matrix, to date, no comprehensive 
studies have been published that analyze the advancements made in this field. Therefore, the current 
chapter considers this knowledge gap and provides a comprehensive review and summarization of 
the potential of nano-phytoremediation in the detoxification of the pedospheric zone. The chap￾ter specifically aims at the potential of phytoremediation for environmental cleanup, the interplay 
of different mechanisms in phytoremediation and nano-phytoremediation and the challenges and 
future prospects associated with the nano-phytoremediation carried out with different types of NPs 
and plants.
10.2 METHODS
10.2.1 Search Strategy
This chapter is representative of the exploration of nanotechnology in the detoxification of the 
pedospheric region in collaboration with phytoremediation. Data regarding the subject matter have 
been obtained by a meticulous assortment of the limited materials from specific articles. The data 
were obtained from various electronic platforms and databases. Such databases are inclusive of Science 
Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, ProQuest and PubMed. Different types 
of articles were selected that encompass full-length research articles, reviews, perspectives, chapters 
of different books from renowned publishers and reports produced by different institutes. The mate￾rials studied for the current chapter were produced by various publishers, for example, Taylor &

In the contemporary world, contaminated pedospheric and hydrospheric regions are being reme￾diated with a variety of physicochemical methods that are aimed at the extraction of pollutants. 
More specifically, groundwater contamination is often remediated through precipitation–filtration 
(Kasaishi et al. 2021), ion exchange (Gao et al. 2021), flocculation (Naruka et al. 2021), reverse–
osmosis (Lee et al. 2021), coagulation (Campinas et al. 2021), electro-dialysis (Ramasamy et al. Nanotools-Coupled Phytoremediation 159
2021), carbon adsorption (Park et al. 2021), chelate-flushing (Omran 2021) and oxidation–reduction. 
In the case of soils, the extraction of contaminants is often performed through soil flushing, solidi￾fication, electro-kinetic treatment, stabilization and vitrification (Zhang et al. 2020; Vidal et al. 
2021). However, such methods have been known for their negative aspects of higher costs and 
their impacts on agricultural soils, which alter the soil structure and make it unsuitable for future 
agricultural activities (Ye et al. 2017). Such reservations have given rise to the advanced obstructive 
protocols and demanded fabrication of sustainable methods that could detoxify the environment 
without causing permanent changes in the environmental integrity of different areas.
Environmental quality maintenance achieved via phytoremediation signifies a sustainable and 
cleaner approach. Ecological detoxification using phytoremediation is in an emerging phase and 
needs further studies in an optimized manner for practical adoption in real life (Ahila et al. 2020). 
However, the concept of sustainability and sustainable development needs to be closely considered 
if we want future and present generations to be benefitted from sustainability. In this regard, sus￾tainable phytoremediation can be easily accomplished through the utilization of the plants that have 
the potential of natural colonization in terms of the unprompted development of vegetation. The 
pollutants and contaminants present in pedospheric matrices are well known for their persistence on 
a global scale (Brereton et al. 2020). In most cases, they are also resistant to any kind of degradation 
or destruction. In fact, they undergo the phenomenon of bioaccumulation via the food chain, which 
leads to negative impacts on the health of different species including humans and other forms of 
biodiversity.
Research on phytoremediation with different types of plant species has expressed a greater can￾didacy of these plants in terms of environmental friendliness, economic viability and facileness of 
use. Especially naturally colonizing plants can further add to the sustainability aspect in addition 
to these features since they are mostly perennial, economically viable and not easily palatable. 
Furthermore, such plants are also naturally equipped with the potential of growing even if ecologi￾cal succession takes place (Chiudioni et al. 2021). Many studies also support the fact that any plant 
species under consideration for phytoremediation needs to be beneficial from the point of view of 
society’s welfare and goods’ productivity. Phytoremediation is also considered an auspicious phyto￾technology due to its aesthetic advantages and long-term beneficial implications. It represents an 
in-situ detoxification system dependent upon solar irradiance and the plant species (Yadav et al. 
2018). In-situ detoxification via phytoremediation is a comparatively simpler technique marked by 
meagre labor intensiveness (Jaskulak et al. 2019). 
10.4 CATEGORIZATION OF PHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation can be used to clean the environment either in in-situ or ex-situ mode. In most 
cases, in-situ phytoremediation is preferred over ex-situ phytoremediation. In the in-situ mode, envi￾ronmental remediation is performed on site, and no excavation is conducted for the transferal of the 
contaminated samples to other sites or a relevant laboratory. Therefore, this method is often prefer￾able since it remediates the soil without causing further disturbance and labor exertion. More spe￾cifically, this method is often associated with the transfiguration or extermination of pollutants and 
contaminants; it is also based on the segregation or isolation of the pollutants or contaminants from 
larger clumps of soil. Furthermore, in-situ phytoremediation is often known for the immobilization 
of contaminants to alleviate their bioavailability (Nejad et al. 2018). In contrast, ex-situ phytoreme￾diation is associated with the displacement of polluted soils for the purpose of treatment away from 
the locality of contamination; upon treatment, the treated soils are returned to the site of excavation 
for the purpose of reversion of the resorted site. In this type of remediation, the efficiency of the 
removal of contaminants is based on several factors such as the excavation, transferal and recreation 
of the resorted site. Furthermore, the contaminated soil is transferred to a laboratory and several 
procedures are adopted for detoxification, for example, immobilization, stabilization, incineration 
and solidification. Phytoremediation has been classified into different categories depending upon 160 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution

the type of procedure, choice of plants and method of pollutant uptake as shown in Table 10.1. These 
categories are broadly classified as follows. 
• Phyto-stimulation: Phyto-stimulation is a type of phytoremediation in which various kinds 
of enzymes derived from microbial species, including bacteria, fungi, etc., are stimulated 
inside the rhizosphere zone, which leads to the bioremediation of the pollutants and con￾taminants. Such enzymes are actually released from the root exudates (Kumar et al. 2020). 
• Phyto-extraction or phyto-accumulation: In this type of phytoremediation, pollutant and 
contaminant species are eliminated by using different hyper-accumulator species that pos￾sess an inherent capacity of accumulating these pollutants inside them when grown in a 
contaminated pedospheric region. Such plants are actually known for storing these con￾taminants inside their shoots. The shoots of these phyto-extracted plants can then be used 
upon harvesting (Roshanfar et al. 2020). 
• Phyto-volatilization: Different hyper-accumulator plants take up chemicals from the envi￾ronment and deposit them in their leaves. Chemicals or contaminants that are often being 
phyto-volatilized possess a volatile nature and are produced by different anthropogenic 
activates (Osama et al. 2021). 
• Phyto-degradation: During the phyto-degradation process, the obnoxious chemicals and 
pollutants are broken down to less-toxic daughter products by the action of some spe￾cialized enzymes. This technique is often used in the case of persistent organic pollut￾ants (POPs), namely, agrochemicals, trichloroethylene, etc. Another interesting feature 
associated with phyto-degradation is that its occurrence can either be internal or external Nanotools-Coupled Phytoremediation 165
depending upon the type of plant species since some plants are also specialized in secret￾ing external enzymes (Mohanty et al. 2021).
• Phyto-rhizofiltration: Phyto-rhizofiltration is another advanced form of phytoremediation 
used for the detoxification of pedospheric matrices and protection of groundwater reser￾voirs from receiving different pollutants and contaminants produced due to anthropogenic 
activities. Phyto-rhizofiltration is accomplished with the help of plants that bear an exten￾sive system of roots, which can easily carry out the filtration of the contaminants through 
different mechanisms, such as adsorption and absorption (Castro-Castellon et al. 2021).
• Phyto-transformation: In phyto-transformation, complex and large-sized pollutants and 
contaminants are converted to smaller products through degradation accomplished by 
hyper-accumulator plants that have an inherent potential of doing this. Reaction products 
released in such reactions are then taken up by the plants and incorporated inside plant 
tissues.
• Phyto-stabilization: Phyto-stabilization stops all kinds of movement of organic and inorganic 
pollutants and contaminants by stabilizing them inside pedospheric matrices. Prevention 
of the movement of such contaminants in a timely manner is also known for stopping the 
entrance of these pollutants into food chains and disrupting consumer health. 
10.5 NANO-ENABLED PHYTOREMEDIATION
Nano-remediation is a new technology that is in an emerging stage and is associated with the imple￾mentation of nanoscale materials having size ranges less than 100 nm; it is aimed at the effective 
detoxification of the pedospheric and hydrospheric zones. A great deal of nanomaterials are being 
synthesized and employed for the environmental remediation of different pollutants, for example, 
dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and solvents (Jaffri and Ahmad 2018a; Jaffri and Ahmad 2018b). 
Table 10.2 expresses an account of nano-enabled phytoremediation. Zero-valent iron is known for 
the effective and rapid removal of dissolved heavy metals through immobilization. Previous stud￾ies support the remediation of heavy metals via adsorptive mechanisms over the surficial region of 
iron NPs (update). Another site of adsorption for heavy metals and other contaminants is created by 
the process of corrosion, in which the products act as an attachment site for pollutants. The recent 
era has seen an immense augmentation in the application of NPs in different sectors, such as the 
cosmetics, agriculture and biomedicine industries (Iqbal et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2019b). A variety 
of NPs can be fabricated through different physicochemical and biological methods, and they pos￾sess different size ranges, geometries and functionalities depending upon the type of application in 
which they are intended for utilization. NPs have advantageous features compared to other conven￾tional materials in terms of higher surficial activity, greater surficial reaction sites, remarkable cata￾lytic performance and exceptional opto-magnetic characteristics (Ijaz et al. 2020c, 2020a, 2020b).
The utilization of NPs in agriculture has extensively emerged, giving rise to the field of agri-nan￾otechnology. Previous studies have discussed the implications associated with the use of such NPs 
in agriculture. For instance, in a study by Hao et al. (2020), carbon-based nanomaterials were used, 
and the results were indicative of the sensitivity of rice fungal endophytes towards a meagre dose 
of 10 mg/L. In the case of exposing peanut to the minimum dose of 50 mg/kg of silver (Ag) NPs, 
negative impacts were exerted on the biomass and quality of peanuts (Rui et al. 2017). The impacts 
of such NPs have been studied on plants and have also been investigated for other fau3nal life forms. 
For example, nickel oxide (NiO) NPs in lower doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg were found to not affect 
the existence, reproduction and development rate of the test animals, namely, adult earthworms; 
however, when the dose was augmented to 200 and 500 mg/kg, comparatively negative impacts 
were exerted on the physiological and biochemical makeup of the earthworms Adeel et al. 2019. 
Nevertheless, other studies also support the effective results in the case of agriculture and the envi￾ronment obtained as a result of NP utilization. Applications of NPs are associated with a consider￾able improvement in the germination of seeds, photosynthetic rate, resistance towards oxidative 166 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution

stress, maturation and development of the rhizome and overall yield and quality of crops (Kah 
et al. 2019; Li et al. 2016). Applications of NPs are far ranging. For instance, they are employed on 
crops for fertility augmentation in the form of nanofertilizers (Li et al. 2020) and for exterminating 
pests in the form of nanopesticides (Adeel et al. 2020). Such nanofertilizers and nanopesticides are 
marked by the easier absorption of plants and comparatively slower emission into the target eco￾logical setting than that of conventionally employed fertilizers. Contrariwise, other NPs, including 
CeO2, TiO2 and Mn3O4, are known for their enhancement of the potential of antioxidant enzymes. 
Such enzymes then subsequently alleviate the aggregation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Nanotools-Coupled Phytoremediation 167
different types of plants, giving rise to a considerable reduction in the phyto-stress and improvement 
in the overall crop yield and quality (Usman et al. 2020). In a recent study by Zhou et al. (2021), a 
comprehensive study was conducted that reviewed the literature addressing nano-enabled agricul￾ture and discussing the mechanisms of the uptake and transport of different pollutants by plants. 
The analysis was supportive of the remarkable performance of NPs on the development of plants 
under the stress of different pollutants and heavy metals. Furthermore, the employment of NPs in 
collaboration with phytoremediation needs systematic research to achieve sustainable nano-enabled 
agriculture (Zhou et al. 2021).
Phytoremediation performed with the assistance of various types of nanomaterials is actually 
based on three major components, specifically, plant species specialized in the hyper-accumulation 
of the pollutants and heavy metals, target pollutants and contaminants and nanomaterials. The 
employment of NPs of different metals and other substances has a dual functionality of the direct 
action on the pollutants and the plant species through the development of the interaction. In addi￾tion, these NPs serve to develop an indirect association with the plants and pollutants, thus causing 
an indirect impact over the final detoxification efficiency (Jaffri and Ahmad 2018c; Ahmad and 
Jaffri 2018b). In this type of nano-phytoremediation, environmental decontamination is conducted 
by using the rhizospheric region of the plant that contains beneficial microbial species, inclusive of 
bacteria, that are specialized in plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM), nitrogen-fixa￾tion and fungal species, namely, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Nano-enabled phytoreme￾diation is performed to meet the challenges of the alleviated agri-productivity caused by some biotic 
and abiotic stresses. In this case, biotic stresses are inclusive of the phyto-pathogens and pests that 
cause different diseases, and abiotic stresses might be exerted due to the pedospheric matrix con￾tamination caused by heavy metals and other types of pollutants (Shang et al. 2019). Nano-enabled 
phytoremediation is advantageous over other detoxification methods for the remediation of toxic 
contaminants and heavy metals. Some of the famous nanomaterials in this regard are nanocarbon 
black, nanohydroxyapatite modified with biochar, Ag, zinc (Zn), Ni, tin oxide (SnO2), titanium 
dioxide (TiO2) and nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) (Yadav et al. 2017; Mousavi et al. 2018; Zhang 
et al. 2018; Romeh and Saber 2020). Variable results are obtained for each type of nanomaterial 
when coupled with phytoremediation, depending upon the plant type, nanomaterial size, morphol￾ogy, etc. In fact, the size tuning of these NPs can be performed since this factor has a real influence 
on the immobilization of the contaminants and heavy metals followed by the restoration of the 
affected soils (Shrivastava et al. 2019).
Among the different types of nanomaterials studied for phytoremediation coupling for soil 
cleanup, the role of TiO2 NPs has been quite influential (Waani et al. 2021). The treatment of dif￾ferent plants with TiO2 NPs is expressive of the significant improvement in the performance of 
floral species in terms of their growth, maturation, physiological aspects and agricultural yield. 
The improvement in this regard has been achieved under both normal and stressful circumstances 
and is used for the growth of the target plants. In a study conducted on spinach plants being 
treated with TiO2 NPs (Gordillo-Delgado et al. 2020), considerable improvement was observed in 
the dry weight of spinach, biosynthesis extent of the chlorophyll, overall rate of photosynthesis 
and activities of different enzymes. Such improvement subsequently led to the alleviation in the 
deposition of the ROS and other free radicals, augmented the extent of the enzymatic activities, 
for example, malionaldehyde and antioxidative actions, and regulated the chloroplast morphology 
and stability of the membranous structure in the target spinach plants (Gordillo-Delgado et al. 
2020). Another interesting feature associated with the utilization of TiO2 NP-based phytoreme￾diation is that it is known not only for alleviating the toxic impacts of contaminants and heavy 
metals and other disturbances in plants, such as stress inflicted due to UV-B, but also restrict￾ing the toxicity related to heavy metals and accelerating the rate of photosynthesis and growth/
maturation in plants. More specifically, TiO2 NPs confine the toxicity caused by Cd and augment 
the growth of plants in addition to enhancing the content of the water and chlorophyll in soyabean 
(El-Gazzar et al. 2020).168 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
NPs and other forms of nanomaterials are significant in the transportation of heavy metals and 
other contaminants inside floral samples; particularly, the transferal of these pollutants inside the 
root cell cytoplasm of the plants is highly impacted by nanomaterials. Plants coupled with NPs 
often exhibit varied responses in terms of the up taking of the heavy metals and the interplay of the 
rhizosphere’s chemico-biological reactions taking place in a complex manner. However, advanced 
research is needed to gain a complete and mechanistic understanding of the modified heavy metals 
and contaminants inside plant tissues coupled with nanomaterials. Many concurrent procedures 
are taking place in ecological compartments, especially in the pedospheric matrices at different 
profiles, which affects the association created between NPs and the co-existence of the ecological 
contaminants inside a nano-enabled phytoremediation system. Ma and Wang (2018) emphasized the 
investigation of relevant concepts of nano-phytoremediation since it is a highly understudied domain 
despite possessing remarkable potential. For instance, the concepts addressing different factors such 
as root exudates emitting phyto-chelating substances in the rhizospheric region and other types of 
enzymes and hormones need to be studied to comprehend the types of interactions developed with 
NPs and the consequent remediation of the environment. Nevertheless, the obstacles in this regard 
cannot be overlooked in terms of the adoption and implementation of nano-phytoremediation in 
pedospheric detoxification in a sustainable manner. One major objection and concern raised by 
conventional environmentalists is the inherent toxicity associated with the utilization of NPs syn￾thesized via the green route. However, this problem can be easily solved through the adoption of 
the facile, green and sustainable method of NP synthesis based on the utilization of reducing cum 
stabilizing agents from nature, specifically, plant phyto-chemicals. Through the utilization of bio￾genic NPs, including, nZVI (Martins et al. 2017), Ag (Bafana et al. 2018) and Au (Pati et al. 2014), 
ecologically friendly and economical nanotools can be used to detoxify the pedospheric matrices 
by coupling them with phytoremediation technology (Ahmad and Jaffri 2018a; Jaffri and Ahmad 
2020a; Jaffri et al. 2020).
10.6 CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The utilization of nanotools for coupling with phytoremediation is an emerging concept that has 
been gaining attention over time and as the domains of nanotechnology and bioremedial technol￾ogy are revolutionizing. Despite its auspiciousness in its different aspects of economic benefits, 
such as its facileness, simplicity and eco-friendly quality, nano-phytoremediation has faced a 
great deal of criticism and challenges in terms of its practical adoption at the field level. In this 
regard, the aspect that hinders the practical adoption of nano-enabled phytoremediation is the 
noxious toxicity associated with the use of NPs and other nanomaterials. Since the pedospheric 
matrices represent an ecological niche of several species that is inclusive of different floral, fau￾nal and microbial communities and because NPs are mostly known for their toxic impacts, their 
use is always therefore dealt with from a critical point of view. However, because of the practical 
results associated with nano-phytoremediation in terms of environmental decontamination, the 
scientific community is forced to explore the risks associated with NPs, work on improving them 
and then use them in nano-phytoremediation. Therefore, the approach that needs to be adopted 
in such a scenario must be dually addressed in terms of the investigation of the ecological risk 
associated with the utilization of NPs. Moreover, the process of phytoremediation and NP cou￾pling needs to be regularized so that the maximum advantage is accomplished with minimum or 
no risks at all.
Currently, the concept of nano-enabled phytoremediation is still at the inception and growth 
stage, and it is quite fortunate that several studies have expressed positive results; however, we need 
long-term experience in this domain through rigorous studies for further comprehension. Additional 
investigations in this regard will enable us to easily evaluate the causes and conditions that lead to 
the failure or minimum performance of nanotools coupled with phytoremediation. In this regard, 
the research areas that need immediate attention include the response mechanism of different Nanotools-Coupled Phytoremediation 169
plants towards different NPs, the variety of pollutants and contaminants, the types of pedospheric 
samples and the climatic factors involved in the nano-phytoremediation conglomeration system. 
Furthermore, the results obtained for nanotools-coupled phytoremediation can also be enhanced 
by inculcating different approaches, for example, agronomic managerial strategies, chemical addi￾tives incorporation, modification via microbial species through inoculation in the rhizosphere and 
genetic engineering.
10.7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Environmental remediation has become an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) in the current era of an increased and unregulated pattern of urbanization and industrializa￾tion. The decontamination of pedospheric and hydrospheric matrices has occurred with a variety 
of physicochemical techniques. More specifically, groundwater contamination is often remedi￾ated through precipitation–filtration, ion exchange, flocculation, reverse–osmosis, coagulation, 
electro-dialysis, carbon adsorption, chelate-flushing and oxidation–reduction. Meanwhile, in the 
case of soils, the extraction of contaminants is often performed through soil flushing, solidifica￾tion, electro-kinetic treatment, stabilization and vitrification. However, such methods have been 
known for their negative aspects of higher costs and their impacts on agricultural soils, as they 
alter the soil structure and make it unsuitable for future agricultural activities. Nanotools coupled 
with the green phyto-technology of phytoremediation have been seen as an attractive and advanta￾geous methodology marked by eco-friendliness, cheaper costs and simpler operation at the field 
level. Hyper-accumulator plants, known for their potential of taking up the contaminants and heavy 
metals, are especially emphasized in this type of cleanup process. Based on an extensive survey 
and comprehension of the literature analyzed in this regard, the current chapter points towards the 
need for comprehending the basic mechanism behind the transferal of contaminants inside hyper￾accumulator plants facilitated by the utilization of nanotools so that these procedures can be maxi￾mized and greater benefits can be accomplished from nano-enabled phytoremediation. There has 
been increasing interest in this cross-disciplinary domain due to its auspicious and future candidacy 
for sustainable environmental detoxification.

Iron Nanoparticles for 
Nano-Phytoremediation

11.1 INTRODUCTION
The size of iron nanoparticles (NPs) varies, ranging from 1 to 100 nm. They are super paramagnetic 
with copper oxide (CuO) and nickel oxide (NiO) (Darr et al. 2017). Two main forms of NPs are 
available: magnetite and an oxidized form of maghemite (Shah et al. 2015). Because of their super 
paramagnetism, they have been widely used in biomedical imaging, heavy electrons, catalysis and 
important chemical reactions (Khan, Saeed, and Khan 2019). Studies on zebrafish animal models 
have shown that iron oxide NPs are cytotoxic, and their stable properties help them reach a higher 
level of the ecosystem (Singh et al. 2021). In plants, they mainly affect the normal function of cells 
by destroying and blocking the aquaporins present on the cell membrane (Malhotra et al. 2020). 
Zhu, Tian, and Cai (2012) used pumpkin as their toxicity model to show how NPs transfer within 
plant tissues. Their transmission electron microscope (TEM) image is one of the earliest recorded 
descriptions of NPs entering the inside of root cells (from the root hair to the epidermis). It was 
found that the development of Arabidopsis is negatively affected by these NPs, and the root length 
and leaf number of exposed plants are reduced (Trujillo-Reyes et al. 2014).
According to the TEM image, regardless of the concentration of the iron precursor, about 90% 
of the NPs prepared with Vibrio flexneri have a diameter from 5 to 25 nm (Siddiqi, Husen, and Rao 
2018). Mineralogical analysis showed that vZVI NPs are formed by 24% of iron oxide and 76% 
of alpha iron. The centered body of these NPs displays a cubic crystal shape. Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy revealed that the presence of -OH and C=C groups of mulberry extract might 
be implicated in iron NPs’ establishment and stabilization (Murgueitio et al. 2018). Based on this 
finding, iron NPs are now produced by using mulberry berry extract (vaccinium floribundum) vZVI 
(Ossai et al. 2020). Generally, as shown by the chromatographic analysis of total petroleum hydro￾carbon (TPH) products, iron NPs are used to remove them successfully. For instance, it has been 
demonstrated that water and soil treatments with vZVI particles allowed the removal of more than 
80% of petroleum hydrocarbons. However, the presence of iron in these nano-sized particles seems 
to strongly impact this treatment (Kuppusamy et al. 2016). The great ability of pollutant removal 
(for example, of TPHs) is linked to NPs’ high surface area, upper reactivity and more importantly 
in-situ processing (Murgueitio et al. 2018). Therefore, compared with conventional bioremediation 
methods, this technology can be effectively used for the rapid soil and water remediation from 
petroleum hydrocarbons. Iron NPs can be produced to exhibit the ability to remove TPHs from soil 
and water samples was investigated by Alfadul (2006) using synthetic spherical nanoscale iron par￾ticles with a size ranging between 5 and 10 nm. vZVI NP application allowed the removal of more 
than 85% of TPHs found in water samples and up to 82% of the TPH content in soil samples (Hong 
et al. 2020). The results show that the addition of vZVI NPs accelerates the elimination of TPHs by 
creating a great reducing environment, which suggests that these NPs can be widely used to prompt 
the removal of TPHs from water and soil compartments (Ren et al. 2014).
11178 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
Iron oxide (IO) NPs are composed of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) and/or magnetite (Fe3O4) particles 
with a diameter ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, which can be used for magnetic data storage, bio 
sensing, drug delivery, etc. (Banerjee et al. 2010). In NPs, the surface area-to-volume ratio increases 
significantly. IO and iron oxyhydroxide are widely distributed in nature and play important roles 
in many geological and biological processes (Laurent et al. 2010). They are used as iron (Fe) ore, 
pigments, catalysts and thermite and are present in hemoglobin. IO is an inexpensive and durable 
pigment in paints, coatings and colored concrete (Ali et al. 2016). Nanomaterials (NMs) can play 
a role in phytoremediation systems by directly removing pollutants, promoting plant growth and 
increasing plants’ utilization of pollutants. Plant extraction is the most effective and recognized 
phytoremediation strategy to remediate contaminated soil (da Conceição Gomes et al. 2016).
11.2 SYNTHESIS OF IRON NANOPARTICLES (THE REDUCTION OF FE(II) OR 
FE(III) SALT WITH SODIUM BOROHYDRIDE IN AN AQUEOUS MEDIUM)
In the presence of solvent-containing carbonyl groups, researchers have used borohydride to reduce 
Fe ions to synthesize nano-sized Fe particles. When we change the content of the solvent, the syn￾thesis and the form of Fe will also change accordingly (Samaddar et al. 2018). Each synthetic Fe 
particle sample was characterized by TEM and powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The content of 
zero-valent iron (ZVI) in the synthetic particles was measured to study the effect of the solvent ratio 
on the reduction of Fe particles in the aqueous organic solvent system (Saif, Tahir, and Chen 2016). 
With the addition of the solvent, the proportion of ZVI in the synthetic particles decreases, form￾ing a well-dispersed Fe particle suspension. Their dispersibility was also characterized by a light 
scattering particle size analyzer, which allowed us to confirm the changes in the dispersion charac￾teristics of wet synthesized Fe particles in a multi-component system (Bagheri and Julkapli 2016). 
NP synthesis technology has attracted attention in catalysts’ technical application and in industrial 
and therapeutic applications. These size ranges are in the particles’ nanostructured domain. Pure 
Fe NPs have attracted special attention due to their reactivity and relatively biologically inert nature 
(Nath and Banerjee 2013). Fe NPs are particularly used in tumoral disease treatment and as tool 
to perform drug delivery. Unfortunately, due to their reactivity, pure Fe NPs have been difficult to 
understand. This is because they accelerate the tendency to form oxides in the air, which is due to 
their increased surface area-to-volume ratio (Sajid et al. 2015). Synthetic methods use polyphenols 
or long Amine chains use air-stabilized Fe NPs with a diameter size range of about 2 to 10 nm, 
but apparently due to internal pressure, the crystallographic defects are transformed into the face￾centered cubic (FCC) stage. It has been found that FCC crystals form icosahedral and decahedral 
shapes. Within this size, they are used as a catalyst for boron and carbon nanotube development 
(Quideau et al. 2011).
11.2.1 aDvantages of catalysts
The growth of nanotubes can be detached from catalyst synthesis for the first time. In addition, the 
catalyst size can be selected in advance to grow nanotubes of a specific size (Smalley et al. 2004). 
That is, (1) NPs’ size distribution has been identified for many synthesis procedures, (2) the appro￾priate size range of vZVI NPs has been determined for nanotube synthesis, (3) the internal pressure 
of NPs has been quantified (4) as has their FCC phase, (5) Fe NP shapes have been discovered (6) 
with an internal crystalline structure, (7) FCC crystal deformation is due to carbon in the octahe￾dral position, (8) Fe NPs have high stability in the air and (9) the addition of Cu (low concentration) 
decreases Fe NPs’ size (Thomas and Raja 2006). Compared with other solvents, the possibility of 
hydroxylation in water is higher. For Fe(III), the hydroxylation of ions can start in a pH range as low 
as 1 and as high as 5 and can occur in acid. Fe(II) is more resistant to hydrolysis and can be in an 
ionic form, with a pH of up to 7 to 9 (Que, Domaille, and Chang 2008). This results in the formation 
of IO NPs at a lower pH than otherwise. In addition, due to the loss of control over maintaining Fe Iron Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 179
ions, the size distribution of NPs is due to oxide contamination occurring at different rates. For this, 
a case buffer must be added. An example of such a buffer is citric acid, which can be obtained from 
a pH of 3 to about a pH of 6 (Guo and Barnard 2013).
11.2.2  Using Iron Nanoparticles to Promote the
Phytoremediation of Contaminated Soil
Soil pollution is widely considered by the world’s scientific community as an environmental issue 
that affects living organisms. Phytoremediation has emerged as a promising technology for soil 
decontamination from environmental pollutants and has been widely accepted. Various stud￾ies have been conducted to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation through various methods. 
Nanotechnology application offers a new way to improve phytoremediation efficiency and to con￾tribute to soil decontamination (Liu, Xin, and Zhou 2018). This chapter reviews the latest advances 
in the use of NMs to promote the phytoremediation of contaminated soil. NMs can contribute to 
the phytoremediation system by prompting the direct removal of pollutants or through the stimula￾tion of plant growth and the improvement of pollutant utilization by plants. Plant extraction is the 
most effective and recognized phytoremediation strategy for remediating contaminated soil (Wang 
et al. 2017). Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is the most studied NM for phytoremediation due 
to its great soil and water remediation. Fullerene NPs can increase the use of pollutants by plants. 
Generally, the use of NMs to promote the phytoremediation of contaminated soil is an effective 
strategy, but it is still in the exploratory and experimental stage. More application case experience 
is needed, and the long-term performance of NMs in phytoremediation systems needs further study 
(Rizwan et al. 2014).
Phytoremediation consists of the use of plants for pollutant removal, degradation or containment 
in environmental media (soil, water and air). Phytoremediation techniques for soil pollution include 
plant volatilization, plant extraction, plant degradation, plant stabilization and rhizosphere degra￾dation (Wenzel et al. 1999). Plant volatilization can be defined as the ability of plants to absorb 
pollutants and transform or degrade them into volatile forms. These volatile products are then trans￾located to leaves and evaporated. Arsenic and mercury are usually studied in the process of plant 
volatilization because of their great ability to transform to gaseous forms through plant organisms 
(Jeevanantham et al. 2019). With the development of nanotechnology, the repair and pollution reduc￾tion of NMs used in the environment have attracted more and more attention from environmental 
researchers. NMs are materials with nanoscale dimensions (1–100 nm) in at least one dimension 
(Mura et al. 2013). Extensive research has been conducted on carbon-based NMs and metal-based 
NMs (Bayatsarmadi et al. 2017). Engineering NMs in many areas of soil and soil remediation has 
successfully developed groundwater in Europe and the United States (Mueller et al. 2012). Recently, 
some studies have reported the application of NMs in the phytoremediation of contaminated soil. 
Incorporating NMs into conventional phytoremediation is a promising system. An NM-assisted phy￾toremediation system includes three main parts: plants, pollutants and NMs (El Wakeil, Alkahtani, 
and Gaafar 2017). NMs can increase phytoremediation efficiency through direct action on plants. 
They can also indirectly participate in the plant-pollutant interaction. Moreover, they affect the final 
repair efficiency. On this basis, the following section discusses how NMs can play a role in phytore￾mediation from the following three aspects: NMs directly remove pollutants, stimulate plant growth 
and increase the utilization of pollutants by plants (Rai et al. 2020).
11.3 NANOMATERIALS’ FUNCTION IN THE PHYTOREMEDIATION SYSTEM
Nano-phytoremediation entails either employing reactive NPs for the degradation/transformation 
of various kinds of pollutants or aiding the plant to detoxify pollutant as an intermediate (Figures 
11.1 and 11.2). A number of NPs have been found to be exceptional for the purpose of environ￾mental cleanup, which include nanoscale zeolites, fullerenes, metal oxides, carbon nanotubes and 180 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
fibers and bimetallic NPs (Patil et al. 2016). These NPs can remediate a number of pollutants such 
as organo chloride pesticides, toxic metal ions, chlorinated compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls 
and inorganic anions (Karn, Kuiken, and Otto 2009). NPs may either directly remove the pollutants 
from the soil/water or indirectly assist plants in the phytoremediation process.
11.3.1 Direct Removal of Pollutants
NPs can be effectively exploited for the direct removal of various types of pollutants (toxic met￾als, explosives, herbicides, pesticides and organic and inorganic contaminants) from contaminated 
water, air and soil. Extensive application of NPs in the environmental cleanup process is mainly due 
to their large surface area compared to their bulk, which provides them with a high rate of reactiv￾ity for the chemical/biological process of decontamination (Sozer and Kokini 2009). NPs can also 
adhere to the roots of higher plants and are further transported to the shoot, thereby enhancing the 
efficiency of phytoremediation (Srivastav et al. 2018).
NPs have the potential to directly degrade, reduce, absorb or adsorb contaminants in the envi￾ronment, which is influenced mainly by not only the type of pollutant, concentration of pollutant 
and charge of pollutant but also the soil characteristics including the soil texture, pH and soil 
aggregates (Srivastav et al. 2018; Song et al. 2019). Among different types of NPs, nZVI is exten￾sively used in the field of phytoremediation (Song et al. 2019). Hence, the chemistry of nZVI is 
known much more than other NPs. During its interaction with pollutants, nZVI is converted from 
Fe0 to Fe2+ and subsequently oxidized to Fe3+ (Patil et al. 2016). Organic contaminants such as 
molinate, atrazine and chlorpyrifos can be effectively degraded by nZVI. nZVI also has the poten￾tial to reduce other pollutants including tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE) and 
cis-1, 2-dichloroethylene (c-DCE).
In addition to nZVI, nFe3O4 (magnetite NP) and Pd/Fe (bimetallic NP) are excellent in the 
degradation of organic pollutants such as lindane, pentachlorophenol, pyrene, polychlorinated 
FIGURE 11.1 Nanoparticles’ prospects for the phytoremediation of contaminated soils.Iron Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 181
biphenyls (PCBs), 2, 4-dinitrotoluene and ibuprofen (Satapanajaru et al. 2008; Reddy et al. 
2013; Singh et al. 2012). Moreover, organic contaminants, including DDT, diuron and pyrene, 
can be effectively degraded through photocatalyis and thermal destruction by TiO2 NPs (nTiO2) 
(Makarova et al. 2000). In addition, PEI-Cu NPs are efficient degraders of pesticides such as 
atrazine (Kalidhasan, Dror, and Berkowitz 2017).
The reclamation of polluted water bodies with toxic metal ions, explosives such as TNT and chlo￾rinated compounds is also facilitated by NP-like bi-metallic NPs, for example, Cu/Fe, silver (Ag)/
Fe and Ni/Fe (Koutsospyros et al. 2012; Nie et al. 2013; Yan et al. 2010). Engineered NPs includ￾ing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also found extensive application in the water decontamination 
process because of their increased adsorption rate and potential to interact with the functional group 
of the target compounds. CNTs are excellent agents for the remediation of toxic metal ions such as 
Zn2+, Cr3+ and Pb2+ (Savage and Diallo 2005; Liang et al. 2004; Patil et al. 2016).
11.3.2 Promoting Plant Growth
The growth and development of plants may be greatly influenced by various NPs, which may offer 
considerable benefits in the phytoremediation of different kinds of pollutants. The small size and 
large surface area-to-volume ratio provide them with increased affinity for the adsorption of pollut￾ants, thereby enhancing the rate of phytoremediation to a greater extent (Mohammadi et al. 2020). 
In addition to their small size, factors including their physical and chemical structure, surface layer, 
reactivity, shape and NP concentration determine the efficiency of nano-phytoremediation (Ma et al. 
2010; Khodakovskaya et al. 2012). The increased adsorption/absorption of pollutants through NMs 
may induce several physiological and biochemical alterations in plants so that they can cope with 
the stress caused by the pollutants. For example, ion NPs (Fe0
) enhance the growth of sunflower 
(Helianthus annuus) plants under chromium (Cr) stress by significantly boosting the activity of anti￾oxidant enzymes, for example, SOD, POX, CAT and APX (Mohammadi et al. 2020). Nano-silicon 
application in Oryza sativa helps the plant tolerate heavy metal stress by regulating the accumula￾tion of toxic ions such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and Cu (Wang, Wang, and Gao 2015). 
FIGURE 11.2 Nanomaterials’ purpose in phytoremediation classification.182 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
Likewise, nano-zinc oxide (ZnO) and nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) application in plants results in 
increased water uptake and the accumulation of osmolytes including proline, thereby improving the 
tolerance for environmental pollutants (Shalaby et al. 2016).
Recently, much attention has given to increasing plant productivity under stress conditions 
and can be achieved to some extent with engineered NPs. For example, NPs such as single￾walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have the potential to enhance the rate of electron transfer in 
chloroplasts during the light reaction of photosynthesis (Giraldo et al. 2014; Shang et al. 2019). 
In addition, SWNTs can suppress the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the chloro￾plasts, thereby enhancing the quantum yield and efficiency of photosynthesis (Shang et al. 2019; 
Giraldo et al. 2014). The phytoremediation of salinized soils or desalination is greatly influ￾enced by NPs through the modification of the photosynthetic process including the enlarged leaf 
surface, augmented pigment composition, increased rate of photosystem II (PSII) and better car￾bon dioxide (CO2) assimilation and sub-stomatal CO2 concentration, as reported in tomato and 
sunflower by the application of nano-SiO2 and nano-FeSO4, respectively (Haghighi, Afifipour, 
and Mozafarian 2012; Siddiqui and Al-Whaibi 2014; Torabian, Zahedi, and Khoshgoftar 2017; 
Rastogi et al. 2019). Moreover, NP applications in plants also alter the expression pattern of 
several stress genes, such as antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes, which further detoxifies the 
pollutant. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, nano-Ag application has induced the expres￾sion of genes including SOD, GPX and Cyt-P450-dependent oxidase as reported by Banerjee 
and Kole (2016).
11.3.3 Enhanced Phytoavailability
Soils are in general enriched with different elements of nutrients, minerals and metals, which 
will be taken up by plants for their growth and development through the root system. However, 
some nutrients, such as phosphorus (P), are not mobilized much through plant roots and need a 
supplemental mechanism for their absorption. NPs play a crucial role in this regard by enhanc￾ing the mobility of ions in the soil through various mechanisms such as adsorbing-desorbing, 
increasing the dissolution rate of ions, changing the soil pH and boosting the root exudates in 
the rhizosphere (Zahra et al. 2020). For example, P mobilization was increased in Brassica 
napus plants upon exposure to aluminum oxide (Al2O3) NPs under hydroponic culture con￾ditions (Santner et al. 2012). Likewise, in Lactuca sativa, P phytoavailability was stimulated 
by approximately 56% after the application of TiO2 NPs (Hanif et al. 2015). In general, TiO2
NPs have been extensively used to enhance the P mobility in many plans, including wheat and 
cucumber (Rafique et al. 2018; Rafique et al. 2018; Servin et al. 2013). This is because Ti3+ pos￾sesses the features of cations that provide more sites for PO4
3− absorption. This will induce a pH 
reduction in soil that will subsequently enable increased root exudation and finally increase P 
mobilization (Zahra et al. 2015; Zahra et al. 2020).
NPs modify the availability of mineral elements and other ions in the soil, thereby influencing 
the nutritional status of the plant. For example, the phytoavailability of minerals such as nitrogen 
(N), P and toxic metal ions of Zn and Pb is increased significantly when the soils are exposed to 
CeO2 and TiO2 NPs. The increased phytoavailability of Pb is attributed to the reduced soil pH and 
increased sorption sites for Pb2+ ions as induced by the CeO2 NP. However, in the case of mineral 
N, the increased phytoavailability is due to the altered mineralization (i.e., nitrification) by the 
antimicrobial or catalytic properties of both NPs. Likewise, P is increasingly mobilized through 
the anti-microbial properties of NPs that modify the activity of P-solubilizing microbes. In the case 
of metal ion Zn, the increased phytoavailability accounts for the competition between positively 
charged ions and the NP of the same charge (Duncan and Owens 2019). In addition, NMs includ￾ing fullerene are known to enhance the phytoavailability of various environmental pollutants as 
reported by Song et al. (2019). Iron Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 183

Nano bioremediation is the process of the elimination of both organic and inorganic environmental 
pollutants with the use of NPs formed by living organisms such as algae, fungi and bacteria (Yadav 
et al. 2017). That is, nano-phytoremediation refers to the use of NPs produced by or involving 
plants to eliminate organic or inorganic pollutants. Therefore, nano-phytoremediation involves the 
following strategies: nano-phytoextraction, nano-phytodegradation, nano-phytostabilization, nano￾rhizofiltration and nano-phytovolatilization (Singh 2010). Classical phytoremediation, which is the 
process of using plants to eliminate contaminants from soil, has various limitations including its 
time-consuming nature and lower biomass of plants (Zhao et al. 2010). Thus, it becomes necessary 
to amend the phytoremediation process. The incorporation of nanotechnology into phytoremedia￾tion is a good option that augments phytoremediation’s potential. Therefore, NPs can be used for 
the reclamation of water and soils polluted with toxic metals and other inorganic and organic sub￾stances (Singh 2010).
The most commonly used NPs for environmental cleanup are Fe NPs (Kanel et al. 2005; Shipley, 
Engates, and Guettner 2011). The electron-donating capacity of Fe makes it reduce, and this is its 
role in remediating a contaminated matrix. Its strong reducing property makes it an excellent choice 
to remove any contaminant that can be reduced (Mehndiratta et al. 2013). The increased absorption 
capability, surface modifiability, biocompatibility, increased reaction potential and high surface 
area of IO NMs are the characteristics that attract wide attention to this field of environmental 
restoration (Waychunas, Kim, and Banfield 2005; Komárek, Vaněk, and Ettler 2013; Martínez￾Fernández et al. 2017).
The usage of IO NPs in the field of agriculture and environmental remediation has increased 
recently, which indicates their effectiveness and environmentally friendly nature. Pollutants such as 
Cr, PCBs and trichloroethylene (TCE) can be removed from soil using Fe NPs (Varanasi, Fullana, 
and Sidhu 2007; Zhang et al. 2011; Singh, Misra, and Singh 2012). In addition, various studies have 
underlined the scavenging nature of IO NPs for the toxic forms of heavy metals (Zhang et al. 2010; 
Lin, Lu, and Liu 2012; Tuutijärvi et al. 2012; Akhbarizadeh, Shayestefar, and Darezereshki 2013; 
Jiang et al. 2013; Roy and Bhattacharya 2012; Komárek et al. 2015; Chen and Li 2010; Nassar 2010; 
Xu et al. 2012; Chomoucka et al. 2010; Martínez-Fernández, Barroso, and Komárek 2016).
The amorphous form of IO NPs makes them the most suitable substances for land contaminated 
with toxic metals due to their large surface energies and considerable surface area-to-volume ratio

(Anjum et al. 2019). The added advantages of IO NPs are that they can be manipulated easily 
by applying an external magnetic field, they are recyclable and they are cheaper (Mulens-Arias, 
Rojas, and Barber 2020). In the absence of materials that coat their surface, magnetic IO par￾ticles are hydrophobic. Therefore, these particles cluster together, thus increasing their particle size. 
They then show strong magnetic interactions, which is the reason for their ferromagnetic behavior 
(Hamley 2003). Moreover, when each of these large particles comes into the vicinity of one another, 
each cluster falls into the magnetic field of one another. This leads to a further magnetization of 
particles (Tepper et al. 2003). This again enhances their aggregation properties (Gupta and Gupta 
2005). A similar report by Xia et al. (2012) also supports the fact that due to the strong magnetic 
attraction among NPs, van der Waals forces and a high surface energy, the aggregation of IOs with 
bare surfaces occurs. Coating a shell on IO NPs makes them hydrophilic, and making them func￾tionalized and compatible with the environment can prevent aggregation (Sheng-Nan et al. 2014). 
Usually, it is desired to coat IO NPs with a high-density substance to stabilize them. The addition 
of a polymer or a surfactant during the time of preparation helps in preventing the aggregation of 
a nanoscale particulate stabilizer. The adherence of these polymers occurs in a substrate-specific 
manner (Ghosh et al. 2011).
The synthesis of IO NPs can be carried out by using three methods, namely, physical, chemical 
and microbial methods. Among these, the chemical method is the easiest, fastest and cheapest. Yadav 
and Fulekar (2018), Zhao et al. (2020), Asab, Zereffa, and Abdo Seghne (2020), Kayani et al. (2014), 
Vallejos et al. (2016) and Zhu et al. (2013) synthesized IO NPs with the co-precipitation method, sol￾vothermal method, microemulsion method, sol-gel method, chemical vapor deposition method and 
sonochemical method, respectively.
The characteristics of magnetic IO NPs vary with the procedure adopted for their synthesis. 
Magnetite (Fe3O4), maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) and hematite (α-Fe2O3) are the different forms of IO NPs. 
The superparamagnetic property and high saturation magnetization of magnetite and maghemite 
lead to their biomedical applications including tumor targeting and magnetic resonance imaging 
(Gupta and Gupta 2005; Atta et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015; Augustin et al. 2016; Karimzadeh, Dizaji, 
and Aghazadeh 2016; Yin et al. 2016). Fe2+/Fe3+ salts’ double precipitation of hydrazinated Fe(II) 
oxalate decomposition by temperature, microemulsion, sol-gel syntheses, hydrolysis and pyrosol 
are the methods employed in magnetite and maghemite synthesis (Alibeigi and Vaezi 2008; Babay, 
Mhiri, and Toumi 2015; Jafari et al. 2015; Rane and Verenkar 2001; Chin and Yaacob 2007; Woo 
et al. 2003; Herrero et al. 1997).
Magnetite can be converted to maghemite through calcination in the air (4Fe3O4 + O2 → 6γ-Fe2O3). 
Magnetite has a spinal structure. Fe3+ occupies the tetrahedral sites and Fe3+ and Fe2+ occupy the 
octahedral sites of magnetite. Maghemite has the same structure as that of magnetite except that it 
has cationic vacancies in one-third of the octahedral sites (Laurent et al. 2008). Nanomaghemite 
can also be formed by the oxidation of nZVI (Zhang et al. 2011). Synthetic nanomaghemite 
(nFe2O3) is a good sorbent of metals and metalloids. Its magnetic property makes it easily sepa￾rable and can therefore be recovered and reused (Komárek et al. 2015). SiO2- (Hu, Wang, and Pan 
2010), organic molecules- (Ozmen et al. 2010) or goethite- (Cundy, Hopkinson, and Whitby 2008) 
coated magnetite NPs have great capacity for the remediation of metal ions such as Cu2+, Hg2+ and 
Pb2+. The sorption capability of Cu2+ can be reduced by the clustering of IO NPs. This proves the 
efficiency of IO NPs in removing metal ions (Gilbert et al. 2009). This treatment, which can be 
called assisted natural remediation, can reduce the concentration of metals in leachates and water, 
thereby reducing microbial toxicity (Cundy, Hopkinson, and Whitby 2008). Nano bioremediation 
using IO NPs can decrease the economic burden since they can be recovered and reused (Dave 
and Chopda 2014).
11.4.2 Applications of Iron Nanoparticles
Currently, the applications of NPs in different areas of science are increasing considerably. This is 
because NPs’ nanoscale size and other properties make them more efficient than other materials. Iron Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 185
The ultra-nanosize ranging from 1 to 100 nm in diameter enables them to exhibit unique physical, 
chemical, optical, mechanical, electrical and magnetic properties. (Srivastava, Chaubey, and Ojha 
2009; Chaturvedi, Dave, and Shah 2012).
NPs have more applications in the environmental, medical, agricultural, chemical, industrial, 
energy production, information and communication areas. Fe NPs also have various applications in 
various fields. These applications include the ecofriendly decontamination of pollutants from the 
environment—especially toxic metal absorbents—the degradation of ionic dyes and the magnetiza￾tion of sediments/cycling of Fe of stratified marine environments. Moreover, they have very high 
antioxidant and anti-bacterial potential (Harshiny, Iswarya, and Matheswaran 2015). NPs can play 
an important role in the remediation process by directly removing pollutants from the environment 
(due to their large surface area-to-volume ratio) by increasing the phytoavailability of pollutants and 
indirectly promoting plant growth. This remediation technique with the help of NPs is generally 
termed nano-remediation.
The application of nZVI has been widely used for groundwater remediation and has been success￾ful in the remediation of chlorinated solvents, Cr and other toxic compounds. The strong reduction 
potential of zero-valent Fe makes it a more suitable agent for the removal of chlorinated solvents. It 
converts the toxic form to nontoxic forms such as ethene and ethane (Macé et al. 2006). NPs used 
in phytoremediation technology increase the efficacy of a plant to extract toxic metals, and they 
improve plant growth. The adsorption of toxic metals is improved in NP-assisted phytoremediation. 
The application of zero-valent Fe plays a significant role in the removal of toxic metals Cd and Pb. 
The phytoextraction potential of Boehmeria nivea and Lolium perenne showed an improved anti￾oxidant system and became more tolerant under heavy metal stress (Song et al. 2019). Ryegrass has 
been used for the remediation of toxic Pb from the soil. Huang et al. (2018) studied the application 
of nZVI in the phytoremediation of Pb. It effectively increased the Pb accumulation in plants even 
at a low concentration of nZVI.
The overuse of pesticides on agricultural fields potentially increases the arsenic in soil, which 
is the most toxic heavy metal chiefly present in pesticides, herbicides, phosphate fertilizers and 
wood preservatives. The decontamination of arsenic-affected soil with plants is sustainable and 
ecofriendly. Plants absorb these toxic metals from the soil and remediate arsenic pollution. The 
phytostabilization of arsenic by sunflower was effectively improved in nZVI-treated plants over the 
control (Vítková, Puschenreiter, and Komárek 2018). Gao and Zhou (2013) studied the potential use 
of nZVI with the plant Impatiens balsamina. The results revealed that the combination (plant with 
nZVI) made it more efficient in the remediation of e-waste-contaminated soil than without nZVI. 
Hussain et al. (2019) reported the potential of IO NPs (Fe NPs) in alleviating Cd stress in wheat 
plants. IO NPs (20 ppm) diminish the effects of Cd toxicity through antioxidant pathways and result 
in improved growth, higher efficiency in photosynthesis and decreased Cd absorption. Similarly, 
Cd(II) and Cr(VI) toxicity in wheat plants was reduced by applying citrate-coated magnetite NPs 
(López-Luna et al. 2016). The PCB- and trinitrotoluene-contaminated soil was remediated with 
Panicum maximum and Helianthus annuus, and its phytoremediation potential was increased more 
in nZVI plants than the control. Thus, it changed the texture of the contaminated soil and made it 
more suitable for the growth of other plants (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2012). 
11.5 USING NANOMATERIALS TO FACILITATE PHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation is a sustainable approach of environmental cleanup in which pollutants are effec￾tively tackled in an ecofriendly manner with the help of plants. To date, a number of plants have 
been identified as promising candidates for phytoremediation. However, in some cases, the decon￾tamination process may not be satisfactorily fulfilled because of various problems, for example, the 
limited bioavailability of pollutants, lack of an efficient uptake mechanism, etc. These can be over￾come by the employment of an intermediate agent in the remediation process, and for this purpose, 
NPs and engineered NMs offer legitimate solutions since NPs are harmless to plants. The following 
sections discuss the role of NPs in the phytoremediation process and how NPs are involved.186 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
11.5.1 How Nanomaterials Can Function in the Phytoremediation System
Many NMs have been widely employed in the remediation of environmental pollutants during 
recent years due to the ecofriendly attributes of nano-phytoremediation technology. The unique 
feature of NPs that makes them ideal for this technique include their large surface area-to-volume 
ratio when it is converted from a bulk to a nanoscale particle. Due to this particular quality, NMs 
can absorb/adsorb a large number of materials (pollutants) with which they come into contact in 
their surroundings, thereby increasing the reactivity (Rizwan et al. 2014; Tyagi et al. 2017). Thus, 
NMs make suitable agents for the environmental cleanup of various pollutants. However, for suc￾cessful remediation with NPs, a number of criteria have to be fulfilled. The most important one is 
the selection of the proper NPs, which must be based on the type of pollutants and the nature of the 
plants with which they will interact.
11.5.2 Selection of an Ideal Nanoparticle for Phytoremediation
In recent years, a variety of NPs have been found to be excellent in removing certain pollutants, 
which reinforces the fact that selection of the proper NPs for remediation is crucial in defining the

efficiency of the process. For example, ZnO and Fe NPs are excellent for the removal of toxic metal 
ions, whereas gold (Au) and Ag NPs are exceptional for removing organic/inorganic pollutants 
(Yadav et al. 2017; Verma, Roy, and Bharadvaja 2021). In addition, the stability of NPs is of great 
significance since it may negatively affect the process of remediation; sometimes, there is a chance 
that the NP itself becomes a pollutant (Srivastav et al. 2018). Hence, before selecting an NP for 
phytoremediation, it has to be ensured that the selected NP is appropriate for the kind of pollutants 
to be removed, and it must be harmless and nontoxic for the plant.
11.5.3 Selection of the Proper Plant Species for Remediation
It is equally important to choose the right plant species for remediation since each plant differs in its 
metabolism, and accordingly, the interaction with the NP also differs, which is critical for defining 
the efficiency. For any type of pollutant, before selecting the plants, it must be assured that the plant 
is fast growing with a dense root system and can produce a large biomass. Well-developed and expan￾sive roots are crucial since they provide a large surface area for the pollutants to absorb/adsorb so as 
to initiate the decontamination process. Another important aspect for consideration is the tolerance 
level of plants towards the contaminants. This obviously must be good if they are hyperaccumulators 
of pollutants and can carry out their growth and development process without any sign of toxicity 
(Verma, Roy, and Bharadvaja 2021). Moreover, if the accumulated contaminants are mainly translo￾cated aboveground, then it will be more convenient to handle the biomass after successful remedia￾tion. It is more ideal when the plant selected is non-consumable for humans and other animals so that 
the chance to enter and contaminate the food chain can be avoided (Srivastav et al. 2018). In addition, 
in the recent approaches towards nano-phytoremediation, the generation of transgenic crops with a 
high potential to accumulate and detoxify contaminants is more focused. For this, plants that are eas￾ily manipulated through genetic engineering techniques are highly recommended since they can be 
easily incorporated with stress-resistant genes that will, in turn, enhance the rate of detoxification.
11.5.4 Phytointeraction with the Nanoparticle
The proper interaction between plants and the selected NP is very important as this will increase the 
reactivity between them, which will subsequently improve the efficiency of nano-phytoremediation. 
The size, shape and chemical nature of the NP are critical since these factors will influence the uptake 
of NPs by the plant (Romeh and Saber 2020). Among these features, size is the rate-determining 
feature since the uptake will be limited if the size of the NP is larger. An increased size of the NP will 
also negatively affect the transportation of the NP within the plant. Hence, the penetration of the NP 
through the plant root is the first and crucial step in the process of nano-phytoremediation and thereby 
defines the efficiency of the technique (Schwab et al. 2016). Immediately after entering the root, the 
NP can move inward either through the apoplastic pathway (through cell walls) or through the sym￾plastic pathway (through cytoplasm) (Sattelmacher 2001; Roberts and Oparka 2003; Srivastav et al. 
2018). In addition to the roots, NPs can directly enter plants through structures such as the stomata, 
cuticle and trichomes (Khan et al. 2019).
The uptake and distribution of NPs within plants may be affected by several internal and exter￾nal factors, which also influence the rate of nano-phytoremediation. External features involve the 
atmospheric parameters including the temperature, moisture content, soil pH and amount of organic 
matter in the soil. One major internal feature is the anatomy of the roots and the chemical nature 
of the enzymes and other compounds in the plant. In addition to phytoenzymes, the nature of the 
plant growth regulators also becomes critical for the effective reactivity of NPs in the detoxification 
process. Moreover, the bioavailability of NPs is also considered because it will delimit the uptake 
of NPs from the soil; it is suggested that coating the NPs with polymers or similar compounds will 
increase the bioavailability (Srivastav et al. 2018). NPs employ several strategies for the decontami￾nation/detoxification of pollutants within plants. These may include mechanisms such as adsorption, 188 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
absorption, redox reactions, degradation, precipitation and transformation. However, the exact reac￾tion between the NPs and the plant components that results in detoxification has yet to be revealed.
11.6 CONCLUSION
Nanotechnology can provide effective solutions to many pollution-related problems, such as heavy 
metal pollution, oil pollution, adverse effects of chemical pollutants and soil pollution. Nano biore￾mediation is one of the promising technologies to detoxify various harmful pollutants in the envi￾ronment. The unique application of NPs makes them very useful in various fields, especially in 
environmental remediation. The combination of NP biosynthesis and repair is a new hope for a 
clean environment. A sustainable future large number of NPs (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe and Zn) are obtained 
from living organisms, including bacteria, fungi and plant extracts. The biosynthesis of NPs is very 
simple and cost-effective, minimizes the use of harmful chemicals and takes less time. Many poten￾tial environmental pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic molecules such as toxic dyes, have 
already been removed from polluted areas by NPs. Considering that they have great potential to 
reduce environmental pollution, researchers are most interested in finding novel and effective meth￾ods to biosynthesize various NPs.

Human civilization has been innovating modern approaches via enhanced urbanization and indus￾trialization. Converting manual methods into completely mechanized forms is often seen as good 
progress. However, the negative impacts on the environment exerted due to such urban sprawl and 
unregulated industrialization, in addition to the chemicals of modern agricultural methods, cannot 
be overlooked (Ijaz et al. 2020c; Jaffri and Ahmad 2018d). In fact, the environment and other floral, 
faunal and microbial species have been undergoing the worst kinds of impacts in human history in 
terms of disruption to the overall health of the ecological compartments. In this regard, all compart￾ments are equally disturbed by the contaminants produced by anthropogenic activities including 
the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. The contamination of all compartments has its own 
implications, but pedospheric matrices and the hydrosphere are particularly prone to pollution since 
they act as a sink for different contaminants (Zahra et al. 2017).
A variety of pollutants that are released from industrial activities, for example, solvents, dyes and 
pharmaceuticals, find their way into wastewater streams. In a similar manner, soils are a reception 
ground for the contaminants associated with agricultural practices. For instance, the agrochemicals 
sprayed on a target crop are received by the target in a very meagre percentage, while the rest of the 
chemical is received by the immediate ground. In this way, the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene-based products, including phenanthrene, heavy 
metals, pesticides and fertilizers, become a part of the pedospheric matrices and undergo several 
biochemical procedures (Ali et al. 2019; Amjad et al. 2019). The persistence and stability associated 
with different types of contaminants pose a serious threat to the achievement of the Sustainable 
Development Goals. In addition to such contaminants, soils and water bodies are also reception 
media for various types of nanomaterials released because of anthropogenic activities. The pedo￾spheric compartment has been known especially as a primary sink for the aggregation of nanopar￾ticles (NPs) in environmental settings (Ma et al. 2018) and in soils exceeding the hydrospheric and 
atmospheric compartments in accumulating nanomaterials (Nair 2018).
In the face of such contamination, the sustainable remediation of the pedospheric matrices and 
hydrosphere has become an urgent matter to protect the environment from further deterioration and 
maintain its integrity (Shaheen et al. 2016). A myriad of physical, chemical and biological methods 
have been devised, and research is ongoing in each domain to develop the best possible solution

that is acceptable in terms of monetary considerations, environmental quality and simpler operation 
and that is not marked by complicated operational procedures requiring labor-intensive work. More 
specifically, the cleanup of the hydrosphere is performed through different techniques, for example, 
precipitation–filtration (Estay et al. 2021), ion exchange (Mabrouk et al. 2021), flocculation (Naruka 
et al. 2021), reverse–osmosis (Jafari et al. 2021), coagulation (Campinas et al. 2021), electro-dialysis 
(Ramasamy et al. 2021), carbon adsorption (Xu et al. 2021), chelate-flushing (Omran 2021), and 
oxidation–reduction (Lukashev et al. 2021). In the case of soils, the extraction of contaminants is 
often conducted through soil flushing (Senevirathna et al. 2021), solidification (Tang et al. 2021), 
electro-kinetic treatment (Ali et al. 2019), stabilization (Bazarbekova et al. 2021), and vitrification 
(Shu et al. 2021). The ongoing research in this area related to physicochemical and biological meth￾ods suggests further investigation since none of these methods has completely fulfilled the sustain￾ability criteria. In fact, in most cases, the site to be restored is deprived of its intrinsic value due to 
the disruption of the soil inherent structure; sometimes, the chemical treatments might remove the 
target pollutant but end up releasing even more synthetic substance into the environment.
Considering the unsatisfactory results associated with physicochemical methods, the utilization 
of nature’s tools for the remediation of the environmental compartments has become a sustainable, 
facile, economic and environmentally friendly option (Shazia et al. 2018; Iram et al. 2018; Iftikhar 
et al. 2019). In this type of remediation, the pedospheric matrices and hydrospheric regions are 
detoxified by utilizing different plants that have the potential of taking up pollutants in their bod￾ies and cleaning the environment where they are grown (Yan et al. 2021). This phyto-technology 
referred to as phytoremediation has been gaining interest in the last four decades because of its 
advantageous features and public acceptance on a global scale, in addition to its aesthetic appeal. 
Phytoremediation is based on the utilization of the metabolic system of hyper-accumulator plants 
to remove different types of contaminants and nutrients from the immediate environment where 
they are grown (Sangsuwan and Prapagdee 2021). The contaminants are then stored in the bod￾ies of such phytoremediant plants obtainable upon harvesting. The selection of the plant species 
aimed at the cleanup of soils and water bodies needs to be very meticulous to derive the maximum 
results. For instance, the hyper-accumulator plants should ideally possess larger root systems since 
a greater length of the roots in close proximity to the contaminated site will lead to greater contam￾inant uptake due to enhanced interaction. Moreover, to ensure the effective detoxification of the 
lithosphere and hydrosphere, the hyper-accumulator plants need to be aggressive in the accumula￾tion of the heavy metals, nutrients and other contaminants (Khalid et al. 2021; Han et al. 2021). 
Furthermore, the rate of reproduction in such plant species is also an integral factor in determining 
the overall success of the phytoremediation system. If the plants rapidly reproduce, then this will 
be representative of self-sustenance and will directly reduce the costs incurred for the remediation 
procedure. The phytoremediation process is comparatively dynamic and is aimed at the removal, 
transferal, stabilization, metabolization and detoxification of contaminants by employing special￾ized plants and has several advantages including long-term applicability (Nedjimi 2021; Rono 
et al. 2021).
Nanotechnology and nanoscience have been revolutionizing human life since their inception. 
A great deal of nanomaterials are being produced on a daily basis and applied in practical life to 
derive maximum benefits. The application of different types of nanomaterials have encompassed 
all fields such as biomedicine, photovoltaics, textiles, cosmetics, food packaging and agricultural 
products, including nano-fertilizers and nano-pesticides (Ahmadian et al. 2021; Morab et al. 2021). 
Nanomaterials are referred to as a unique class of materials that have at least one dimension less 
than 100 nm (Krishna et al. 2018), and they are engineered to obtain desired results depending 
upon the type of physicochemical and biological application in which they are being employed. A 
great variety of engineered nanomaterials have been fabricated through different routes, and they 
are often classified broadly into carbon-based, polymeric, metal/metal oxide-based, semiconduc￾tors and ceramic nanomaterials (Jaffri and Ahmad 2018a, 2018b; Ijaz et al. 2020a). Such nano￾materials exist in a myriad of morphologies, for example, nanospindles, nanofibers, nanofalcates, 198 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
nanotubes, quantum dots and nanocrystals (Ijaz et al. 2020b; Tahir et al. 2020). The type of appli￾cation usually takes into account the physicochemical features of any NPs such as the morphologi￾cal aspects, size ranges, type, functionalization and any type of surficial coating on it (Iqbal et al. 
2019; Afsheen et al. 2020). Previous studies are supportive of the repetitive utilization of silver 
(Ag) and gold (Au) NPs in various industrial, medical and agricultural applications by the dint of 
their auspicious features (Khan et al. 2019).
Among many different NPs, Ag NPs are studied in various applications in the agriculture, com￾munications, biomedical and energy fields, among others. In this way, there are fair chances of the 
release of these Ag NPs into the environmental compartments. Interestingly, 25% of the consumer 
products using nano-range materials are based on the utilization of Ag NPs (Vance et al. 2015). 
Therefore, these NPs need to be studied comprehensively to gain a better understanding of them in 
the environment and agricultural systems. Moreover, plants express varied physiological and molec￾ular reactions upon exposure to Ag NPs compared with the salt of silver nitrate (Noori et al. 2020). In 
terms of biological applications, Ag NPs have been known for their antimicrobial (Jaffri and Ahmad 
2018c), antifungal (Ahmad and Jaffri 2018b) and antiviral (Ismail et al. 2021) actions against vari￾ous species. Additionally, they are also employed in different domains of radiotherapy and wound 
healing (Sears et al. 2021), food packaging, water disinfection, and as nano-pesticides for crop 
improvement. The field of agri-nanotechnology is revolutionizing agricultural products by utilizing 
Ag NPs to improve the pedospheric quality and plant development and maturation (Fraceto et al. 
2016; White and Gardea-Torresdey 2018). Previous studies conducted with Ag NPs expressed their 
profound impacts on the growth of plants by affecting plants’ physiology, biochemistry, metabolism, 
taking up of water and other nutrients, rate of photosynthesis, rate of respiration and transpiration, 
stress inflicted due to oxidative reactions, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxi￾dant reactions. Notably, Ag might exhibit varied responses in different environments. For example, 
Ag NPs in the nanoscales have proved to be more effective and reactive inside bio-systems than 
their bulk form because of their minute size ranges and comparatively larger surficial area (Dobias 
and Bernier-Latmani 2013). Furthermore, Ag NPs can undergo various types of oxidative reactions 
inside the pedospheric matrices that can lead to the emission of Ag ions, which are characterized by 
their higher availability and interaction than those of Ag NPs (Castro-Mayorga et al. 2017).
The miraculous features of nanotechnology, especially Ag NPs and phytoremediation, can be 
employed inside one consolidated system and used for the remediation of environmental contami￾nation occurring in the pedospheric matrices and hydrosphere. The concept of nanotools-enabled 
phytoremediation is a great candidate for ecological detoxification from different pollutants and 
is an emerging concept. However, the analysis of the literature in this regard shows that it is a 
highly understudied and underapplied domain despite the vast potential associated with it. A 
large number of review articles have been produced on the miraculous functionality of Ag NPs 
(Das et al. 2020; Saim et al. 2021; Dawadi et al. 2021) and phytoremediation (Durand et al. 2021; 
Nguyen et al. 2021; Rathika et al. 2021) in an isolated manner. However, no review article has 
been produced that reports the potential and utilization of Ag NPs for environmental detoxifica￾tion in collaboration with the process of phytoremediation. Considering the auspicious role of 
nanotechnology combined with phytoremediation, the current chapter summarizes for the first 
time the studies performed with Ag NPs coupled with different hyper-accumulators to detoxify 
the pedospheric and hydrospheric compartments. The chapter highlights the significant role of 
the consolidation of nanotechnology and phytoremediation, the remarkable features associated 
with the utilization of Ag NPs and the synthetic routes towards Ag NPs’ fabrication. The chapter 
also emphasizes the role of Ag NPs in environmental cleanup by coupling Ag NPs with the con￾cept of phytoremediation. More specifically, current and previous studies are compared to gain 
a better comprehension of the interaction developed between Ag NPs and phytoremediant plants 
in a nanotools-enabled phytoremediation system. Finally, the chapter discusses the challenges of 
and recommendations for using an Ag NP-coupled phytoremediation system (ACPS) in the prac￾tical sense and the reservations associated with it.Silver Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 199
12.2 METHODS
12.2.1 Search Approach
This chapter is based on a comprehensive study of the role of Ag NPs in environmental detoxifica￾tion coupled with the concept of phytoremediation. Data were collected in a detailed manner through 
strict selection from a variety of the databases, namely, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science 
Direct, Cochrane, Embase, ProQuest, and PubMed. Different types of research-based articles were 
included by considering peer-reviewed research articles, short communications, reviews, perspec￾tives, different book chapters and reports produced by different organizations. An effort was made 
to consider only research items published by authentic authors such as Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, 
Springer, Springer Nature, De Gruyter, IET, etc. In terms of the timescale, all of the articles produced 
that address Ag coupled with phytoremediation were considered, but since the topic is quite under￾studied, other facts and figures researched were chosen from publications produced from 2010–2021. 
Special emphasis was placed on articles produced in the last three years. The search criteria in dif￾ferent types of electronic search engines was varied by feeding them terms such as “Environmental 
pollution”, “Soil pollution”, “Heavy metals in soils”, “Phytoremediation”, “Hyper-accumulators”, 
“Nano-remediation”, “Nano-phytoremediation”, “Ag NPs”, “Synthesis of Ag NPs”, “Ag NPs in phy￾toremediation”, “Ag NPs environmental remediation”, etc.
12.3 ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY: THE ROLE OF 
NANOTECHNOLOGY AND PHYTOREMEDIATION
Environmental integrity in the current era is seriously threatened due to the uncontrolled release of 
contaminants into the lithospheric and hydrospheric regions. Therefore, sustainable efforts are required 
immediately to protect the environment from further deterioration. The physico-chemical methods 
employed for environmental remediation are characterized by various limitations in terms of the mon￾etary considerations, operational complexity and damage to the environment. In the conventional way 
of remediating the pedospheric zone, the target soils are cleaned either through the in-situ mode or they 
are excavated and moved to the remediation site or landfill for disposal without treatment. In such an 
excavation mode, the pollution source is not actually treated but is shifted from one place to another, 
and the problem of the contamination of such pedospheric swatches remains consistent. To add to the 
issue, such treatment can be labelled as a source of spreading further environmental threats by the 
transferal of the contaminants to the lower soil profiles and to other compartments in close proximity 
in an immediate or slower manner depending upon different factors (Naeem et al. 2020; Tahir et al. 
2020a). In another remediation strategy known as soil washing, the contaminated pedospheric samples 
are remediated through a costly washing method that subsequently leads to the production of residues 
rich in metallic content. Such residues are laden with metals and need further processing, which incurs 
the most cost. Furthermore, this type of remediation is also associated with the rendering of the treated 
land unsuitable for the growth of plants as this land is converted to barren land with no biological organ￾isms carrying out activities (Iram et al. 2019; Ishtiaq et al. 2020; Iram et al. 2020). Such concerns and 
inherent pedospheric micro-floral and micro-faunal disruption discourage the scientific community 
from adopting these methods on a practical scale.
Phytoremediation is a sustainable alternative to such limitations since it uses nature’s tools and 
solar irradiance for the cleanup of environmental compartments in an easier and simpler way (Iram 
et al. 2020a). The word phytoremediation is derived from the Greek phyto, which refers to the plant, 
and remedium is Latin and refers to the concept of balancing or remediation. Phytoremediation is 
advantageous over other remediation modes in terms of the exclusive and discerning uptake poten￾tial of the root systems of phytoremediant plants. Furthermore, phytoremediation is also known 
for the application of naturally occurring processes together with other procedures concerning the 
degradation of pollutants, bioaccumulation and translocation (Parihar et al. 2021; Viana et al. 2021). 200 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
Therefore, the application of phytoremediation for the cleanup of the hydrospheric and pedospheric 
matrices is a good choice to reduce higher amounts of contaminants. The success of this concept 
can be realized from the fact that phytoremediation only started about a few decades ago, but as a 
green alternative, previous studies have identified over 400 plants as hyper-accumulators. In recent 
years, the inherent detoxification potential of hyper-accumulators has further been augmented by 
engineering them with different microbial species. Genetically engineered phytoremediant plants 
are known for their increased potential of metal decontamination and survival under stressful cir￾cumstances (Shah and Daverey 2021; Rai et al. 2021). For instance, the utilization of the endophytic 
rhizospheric microbial species to modify phytoremediated plants has indicated an increase in the 
extent of the environmental cleanup (Durand et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2021).
NPs of different metals and substances are usually aggregates of atoms or molecules. NPs have 
their origin in natural reserves, that is, they are produced by volcanic eruptions, lunar dust, com￾posites of different minerals, etc. They can also be incidentally released from several anthropo￾genic activities, such as engineered NPs and combustive processes (Ahmad et al. 2020). Some 
studies support the facts regarding the toxicity of NPs to living organisms, but notably, the toxicity 
is exhibited only in the tested organisms, which points towards further investigation in this regard 
(Haghighat et al. 2021; Chang et al. 2021). Nevertheless, multitudes of studies have approved the 
positive role of NPs in several domains (Said et al. 2021; Mohammed et al. 2021). In fact, the 
concept of nano-phytoremediation in the present era has shown greater potential for environmental 
remediation by exerting the synergistic impacts of the nano-range of NPs and inherent potential 
of hyper-accumulator plants. For instance, the treatment of plants with titanium dioxide (TiO2) 
NPs not only resulted in an increase in the plants’ dry weight, chlorophyll generation and rate 
of photosynthesis but also enhanced the activity of some specific enzymes. In addition, no toxic 
impacts were seen (Zhang et al. 2019). In other reports, an increment was observed in the activity 
of Rubisco carboxylase upon treatment with TiO2 NPs (Gao et al. 2006). In addition to TiO2 NPs, 
aluminum (Al) NPs were also evaluated in Phaseolus vulgaris and Lolium perenne plants, and the 
results indicated no adverse impacts on the growth of the target plants (Doshi et al. 2008).
12.4 AGRICULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE AND SYNTHETIC ROUTES OF AG NPS
Among all NPs, Ag NPs have received special emphasis from the scientific community because of 
their physicochemical and biological characteristics. Such features have contributed to the remark￾able catalytic and photocatalytic potential of Ag NPs, in addition to their astounding antimicrobial 
impacts, employed in a range of nano-biotechnological investigations (Jaffri and Ahmad 2020a, 
2020b). The route of administration for Ag NPs can be through foliar application from where they 
ideally enter the stomatal openings. Ag NPs usually reside in trichome bases followed by their 
transportation to other plant tissues (Tripathi et al. 2021; Li et al. 2020). In some cases, the accu￾mulation of NPs can occur in the photosynthetic surficial region, leading to the heating of the foliar 
region, and subsequently end up in a gaseous exchange. This gaseous exchange is attributable to the 
obstruction in the stomata and thus causes alterations in the physiological and cellular functionality 
of the plants (Zhang et al. 2019; Lalau et al. 2020). The rate and extent of accumulation of NPs vary 
in the case of different types of plants, which can be associated with the alleviated ionic potential 
and sinking potential of different plants. This, in turn, is associated with the existence of the poly￾phenolic content and other types of heterocyclic compounds. When Ag NPs were applied on zuc￾chini plants being held inside a hydroponic solution during an investigation of their impacts on the 
emergence of the seeds and growth and maturation of the roots, the results indicated the absence of 
any kind of negative impact (Almutairi and Alharbi 2015).
The previous data dealing with the investigation of Ag NPs coupled with phytoremediation are 
very limited. This identifies this domain as still in its infancy, with all reports published in approxi￾mately the last 10 years. However, the promising results are what makes this field interesting and 
worth investigating. Ag NPs possess remarkable surface plasmon resonance (SPR), lower electro Silver Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 201
thermal resistance and antimicrobial potential. With the passage of time, when the utilization of Ag 
NPs was augmented in different fields, new routes also emerged in terms of their synthesis. Many 
procedures have been tested for the fabrication of Ag NPs, namely, physical, chemical, thermal and 
spray pyrolysis (Emil Kaya et al. 2020), mechanical ball milling and biogenic and electrochemical 
approaches (Hoang et al. 2021). Different types of synthetic routes produce Ag NPs with variable 
particle size ranges, distributions, stability indices and other considerations. Generally, two famous 
approaches are adopted for the synthesis of Ag NPs. They are the “top to bottom” method or the 
“bottom to top” method. In the latter method, Ag NPs are synthesized through physicochemical and 
biological methods through the self-assemblage of the atoms to newer nuclei, which subsequently 
grow into a particle that has a nano-range size. In the top to bottom method, material in bulk form 
is broken down through a number of lithographic methods, for example, thermal/laser ablation, 
grinding, sputtering and milling, into finer particles that have alleviated sizes (Beyene et al. 2017). 
Chemical reduction is one of the most frequently used bottom to top approaches in the synthesis of 
Ag NPs. In this method, Ag NPs are synthesized by reacting metal salt with chemically reducing 
agents, such as, N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), Tollen’s reagent 
and ascorbate (Kamaraj and Vivekanand 2020). In addition, Ag NPs have been stabilized with cap￾ping agents for their use in long-term applications.
There has been increasing concern regarding the utilization of chemically synthesized Ag NPs 
and their employment in environmental remediation and other applications due to some extent of 
toxicity associated with them. However, this challenge is easily met by adopting the green route for 
synthesizing Ag NPs with nature’s tools, specifically, plants, microbes, etc., as a source of reducing 
substances in a sustainable and facile manner without using any chemical reducing agents (Shaheen 
et al. 2021). The concept of green chemistry and the biogenic synthetic route have been gaining 
attention in the last two decades. The main goal of the green route is the cost-effective synthesis of 
Ag NPs while ensuring the elimination of the chemicals used for the capping or reduction of the 
NPs. A number of reducing agents from plants have been derived and used for the synthesis of Ag 
NPs, for example, Ixora brachypoda (Bhat et al. 2021), Rehmannia glutinosa (Yong et al. 2021), 
Grewia lasiocarpa (Akwu et al. 2021), Spondia mombins (Asomie et al. 2021) and Tabebuia rosea 
(Dugganaboyana et al. 2021). Different parts of plants have different phytochemicals that can be 
used for the reduction cum stabilization of the NPs. Green synthesized Ag NPs can a be a sustain￾able alternative to chemically synthesized Ag NPs, thus their coupling with the concept of phytore￾mediation for environmental detoxification with no toxicity objections (Saim et al. 2021). In fact, 
scant studies have been published in this regard that express the utilization of green Ag NP-enabled 
phytoremediation. Although many other applications with Ag NPs are frequently reported, the less￾studied green Ag NPs in association with phytoremediation must spark an interest in the scientific 
community. This opens great room for investigating the use of such Ag NPs.
12.5 AG NP-ENABLED SUSTAINABLE PHYTOREMEDIATION
Agri-nanotechnology-based products have been used frequently in the improvement of agricultural 
production and yield. Ag NPs represent auspicious NPs that have been extensively used in agriculture 
in the form of stimulators for plant growth (Tripathi et al. 2021), fungicidal and bactericidal agents 
to prevent the pathogenicity in plants incurred due to pathogenic fungi or bacteria (Ahmad and Jaffri 
2018a) and agents specialized in the enhancement of fruit ripening (Ijaz et al. 2020b). With an incre￾ment in the utilization of Ag NPs, there is also an increasing chance of their inevitable release into 
ecological settings during fabrication and modification to form different products, in addition to 
handling or recycling. Meanwhile, a large number of studies have been reported for Ag NPs in terms 
of environmental remediation. For instance, Ag NPs have been used for the photocatalytic degrada￾tion of methylene blue (Wali et al. 2019), norfloxacin (Kanagamani et al. 2019), nitrophenol (4-NP) 
(Samuel et al. 2020) and paraoxon-ethyl (Zhao et al. 2020). However, it is quite interesting that only 
a limited number of studies can be found that report the utilization of Ag NPs in environmental 202 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
remediation combined with phytoremediation (Verma et al. 2021). The scarce studies conducted 
in this regard are usually based on the Ag NP-enabled phytoremediation of different pollutants 
including chlorfenapyr, fipronil, molinate, heavy metals, atrazine and chlorpyrifos (Cao et al. 2020). 
Furthermore, Ag NP-enabled phytoremediation has also been employed to combat various plant 
diseases. The following section elucidates the studies performed with Ag NPs and phytoremediation.
Chlorfenapyr-contaminated pedospheric and hydrospheric matrices have been successfully detox￾ified by the integration of green NPs, agents specialized for solubility improvement and Plantago 
major-based phytoremediation. The experimental results supported the faster and efficacious removal 
of Chlorfenapyr from the soil and water samples by the collaborative use of green NPs, specifically, 
F—Fe0, Ip—Ag0 and Br—Ag0, and Plantago major, which was supported over an activated charcoal 
medium. The remediation of Chlorfenapyr was performed in a sustainable and cost-effective man￾ner through by utilizing nano-enabled phytoremediation (Romeh and Saber 2020). In another report 
by Romeh (2018), another toxic pollutant was degraded by utilizing nanotools-enabled phytoreme￾diation. In a nanotools-enabled phytoremediation consortia, Ag NPs were added to different plants, 
namely, Brassica Ag NPs, Plantago Ag NPs, Ipomoea Ag NPs and Camellia Ag NPs, and used for 
the detoxification of flooded pedospheric and hydrospheric samples contaminated with Fipronil. 
The 6-day treatment resulted in an effective detoxification of the samples, and degraded products 
of Fipronil were obtained, such as fipronil amide and fipronil desulfenyl, expressing the candidacy 
of such Ag NP-enabled phytoremediation consortia in environmental cleanup processes (Romeh 
2018). There has been increasing interest in the collaborative treatment of Ag NPs and plant growth￾promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) aimed at the alleviation of heavy metals including manganese (Mn), 
nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and lead (Pb) in the shoots of the maize plant. The synergistic utilization of 
Ag NPs and PGPR improved the growth of the maize plants by the induction of gibberellic acid (GA) 
and abscisic acid (ABA) phytohormone generation. Such phytohormones assist in enduring stress and 
augmenting the uptake of nutrients (Khan and Bano 2016b).
The treatment of municipal wastewater with Ag NPs and PGPR is also found to enhance the area 
and length of the root, in addition to effectively countering different types of stresses, for example, 
oxidative and osmotic stress (Khan and Bano 2016a). Ag NPs are inherently equipped for the immo￾bilization or adsorption of heavy metals via alleviation in their motion and absorption. Furthermore, 
Ag NPs have the potential to attenuate the oxidative harms inflicted on plants through heavy metal 
absorption. Treatment of M. oleifera with Ag NPs and subsequent exposure to Cd and Pb expressed 
their enhanced ability of scavenging free radicals and repressing the physiological forbearance 
towards the stress. The addition of Ag NPs enhanced the photosynthetic pigment, polyphenolic con￾tent and the tolerance index of the growth and antioxidant activities. Such results indicate the value of 
Ag NPs in agro-systems to mitigate the adverse impacts of heavy metals on agriculture crop produc￾tion, in addition to the sustainable bioremediation of the contaminated sites (Azeez et al. 2019). Ag 
NPs were utilized in association with Phragmites australis for the phytoremediation of contaminated 
sites, and impacts on the rhizospheric microbial community were observed (Fernandes et al. 2017).
Ag NPs have also been employed for environmental remediation in terms of different plant 
diseases. For instance, Ag NPs have been used in collaboration with cyanobacterium Calothrix 
elenkinii (Ce) for biocontrol against A. alternata-attacked tomato plants. The Ag NP-Ce consortia 
that were employed on the leaves of the tomato plant expressed remarkable augmentation of the 
foliar chlorophyll, carotenoids and polyphenol oxidase. The synergistic impacts of Ag NP-Ce con￾sortia on the biocontrol of A. alternata-attacked tomato plants in an agro-climatic region signifies 
a sustainable approach (Mahawar et al. 2020). In another report based on the citrus disease known 
as Huanglongbing (HLB), regularly referred to as “yellow dragon disease”, Ag NPs were applied 
on the foliar regions of the citrus to eradicate the bacteria-causing HLB. Compared to other meth￾ods, the Ag NP-based remediation produced 3–60 times better results through foliar sprinkling 
(Stephano-Hornedo et al. 2020). A study conducted with roses applied Ag NPs and Co NPs to com￾bat various negative impacts including yellowing and the abscission of foliar regions, and there was 
an increase in the quality of the roses (Ha et al. 2020).Silver Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 203
12.6 CHALLENGES AND CONCLUSION
Ag NPs’ beneficial collaboration with phytoremediation is indicated by the effective results 
obtained against a variety of pollutants and heavy metals and by its ability to combat different 
diseases. However, the major challenge lies in the further research required to evaluate the toxic￾ity caused by Ag NPs to different types of species. There is a considerable inhomogeneity in this 
regard if the existing literature is considered. This is actually further complicated by the variety of 
Ag NPs synthesized through different routes, and the variation in the size ranges, morphologies, 
surficial chemistry, etc. further adds to the puzzle. Therefore, the future directions need to closely 
address these issues and employ Ag NPs in close association with phytoremediation to derive the 
maximum benefits. In this regard, the toxicity-based objections also make practical application a 
challenging matter. However, the previous studies performed with biogenic NPs and the advance￾ments made in the field of green chemistry are suggestive of producing sustainable, facile and 
effective results that can be employed for the remediation of the environment (Figure 12.1). In 
addition to the different concerns associated with the utilization of Ag NPs, some challenges are 
also associated with the type of the hyper-accumulators used. Some of the major disputes in this 
regard are listed as follows.
• Phytoremediation is often a time-consuming process compared to other detoxification 
methods. However, it can be adopted by developing a synergy between hyper-accumulator 
plants and nanomaterials.
• There are issues of lesser biomass and a slower rate of growth in the case of most hyper￾accumulator plants. Therefore, the choice of the plant selected for phytoremediation needs 
to be faster in growth so that it can act as a self-sustaining system that does not incur 
further costs.
• The pedospheric and hydrospheric regions contain different types of pollutants and con￾taminants. However, their bioavailability is limited, which is attributable to the slower 
motion of the metal fragments of the metallic ions in soils.
• In the changing global scenario, fewer plants are effective in the detoxification of pollut￾ants. Even their efficacy can be adversely affected if they are attacked by pests and other 
phyto-pathogens.
• The currently developed method of nanotools-enabled phytoremediation is ineffective in 
detoxifying lower soil profiles and groundwater.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
The pollution of the environment is the greatest challenge of our time and has created serious 
human costs. Pollution is mainly the result of the rapid progress of urbanization and industrializa￾tion, changes in urban lifestyle, variations of industrial strategy, the economic evolution mode and 
residents’ consumption style (Fayiga et al. 2018; Mohammadi et al. 2020; Ukaogo et al. 2020). The 
constant upsurge in industrial waste and urban effluent affects ecosystems and human health world￾wide by polluting the soil, water and air. The remediation of environmental matrices has become a 
vital interest with the intense increase in environmental pollution in recent decades.
Recently, to remediate the destroyed environment that has different impurity types, abundant 
remediation strategies have been developed, including coagulation/flocculation, reverse osmosis, 
photocatalysis, filtration, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, electro-chemical methods, electro￾dialysis, advanced oxidation, electrode ionization, reduction, biological decomposition and adsorp￾tion (Kaur and Roy 2020; Peng and Guo 2020; Singh et al. 2021). Adsorption is one of the main 
methods to remove venomous pollutants from water and wastewater. Therefore, various adsorbents 
with different components have been synthesized, especially low-cost adsorbents, such as agricul￾tural waste (Chakraborty et al. 2020; Nouri 2021). Notably, conventional approaches encounter 
many difficulties when producing concentrated torrents; they also require high energy, have high 
costs, engender enormous amounts of residue, are low in process and instigate consequential con￾tamination (Kaur and Roy 2020; Peng and Guo 2020).
Environmentally friendly remediation strategies are an alternative to restrict biodiversity destruc￾tion. Phytoremediation is a well-liked method of biological remediation. Compared to other meth￾ods, phytoremediation is more economical and simple, has a pleasing appearance, large adaptability 
and public acceptance and causes only slight destruction to the soil structure (Song et al. 2019). 
Nevertheless, phytoremediation often takes a prolonged time (many years), and its treatment is con￾trolled by climate conditions, pollutant toxicity and soil quality. To evolve the effects of phytoreme￾diation, agronomic management, chemical additive treatment, rhizosphere microbial inoculation, 
genetic engineering and other measures have been taken (Song et al. 2019). The extension of nano￾technology has brought inventive ideas for the phytoremediation of polluted ecosystems. Of course, 
researchers hope to conjoin the benefits of both approaches in a novel remediation technology for 
prospective pollutants (Zhu et al. 2019). The latest investigations have confirmed that it is practicable 
to employ nanomaterials and plants to clean up various pollutants in the ecosystem milieus (Liu et al. 
2020b; Mohammadi et al. 2020; Romeh 2020; Romeh and Saber 2020; Hidalgo et al. 2020).
In addition to their encouraging effect on contaminant remediation, nanoparticles (NPs) possibly 
will react with living and nonliving constituents, both positively and negatively; for this reason, 
countless attempts have been made to assess the synergistic influence of the conjoined use of NP 
and phytoremediation techniques and to reveal their biological, chemical and physical exchanges in 
water or soil (Zand and Tabrizi 2020; Youssef et al. 2020).
To date, there are no harmonious decisions as to whether the joint technologies are advantageous in 
enhancing the efficiency of pollutant elimination and whether the combination of phytoremediation

and NPs to eliminate contaminants has not been extensively reported, this is why the principal pur￾pose of this chapter is on the functioning of NPs applied in nano-phytoremediation. The interactions 
between pollutants, plants and MNPs are discussed. In addition, the challenges associated with the 
use of MNPs in nano-phytoremediation are considered to identify future research needs. Given that 
the most used and effective MNPs are iron MNPs (Fe-MNPS) (Singh et al. 2020), this chapter has 
focused on iron MNPs for nano-phytoremediation.
13.2 NANOPARTICLES
NPs are aggregates of atoms or molecules that vary in dimension from 1 to 100 nm, which can 
radically change their physicochemical properties compared to bulk materials (Martínez-Fernández 
and Komárek 2016). They are predominantly partitioned into two categories, namely, inorganic and 
organic NPs. The organic group includes carbon (C) NPs, while the inorganic category involves mag￾netic NPs (MNPs), noble metal NPs and semiconductor NPs, such as TiO2 and ZnO (Figure 13.1).
Several NPs are liberated into soil and other environments through the utilization and discarding 
of nanomaterial products. It is approximated that around 5500, 3000, 550, 300, 55, 55, 55, 55, 0.6 
and 0.6 tons of SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, CNT, FeOx, Ag, AlOx, CeOx, quantum dot and fullerenes, respec￾tively, are engendered worldwide each year (Piccinno et al. 2012). It is estimated that 0.1 to 2% of all 
NPs formed are freed into nature throughout the manufacturing process (Keller et al. 2013). About 
63–91% of NPs are deposited in landfills, and 8–28%, 0.4%–7% and 0.1%–1.5% were assessed to 
be in soil, water forms, and air, respectively (Keller et al. 2013).
In addition, NPs’ annual production involving SiO2, TiO2, ZnO2, FeO2, AlO2 and CeO2 has been 
approximated at 270,000 tons (Kumar et al. 2019). SiO2, TiO2, FeOx, ZnO and Al2O3 are the most 
abundant NPs discharged into soil and landfills (Khan 2020a). The fate of NPs in soil and other 
milieus differs depending on their intrinsic properties and environmental properties (Klaine et al. 
2008; Saleh 2020). The development of nanotechnology guides the continuous delivery of NPs into 
nature, resulting in the NPs piling up in organisms (e.g., plants).
It is estimated that the world’s largest emissions of NPs are in soils, landfill sites and aquatic and 
air environments (Keller et al. 2013). Scientists all over the globe have been studying the impacts 
of numerous NP types on the ecosystem, but the outcomes are inconclusive as to the comparative 
suitability and harm of NPs.
FIGURE 13.1 Main NP classes.216 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution 
Metal NPs are utilized to cleanse pollutants. However, care should be exercised to prevent utiliz￾ing an NP that could poison nature. In this regard, Fe-MNPs are an opportunity (Souza et al. 2020). 
Remember, there are many factors that affect the performance of NPs (Figure 13.2) (Hasan et al. 
2020; OECD 2010). 
13.3 MAGNETIC NPS 
MNPs are favored by researchers because of their various properties (Figure 13.3) that render them 
more attractive in diverse applications (Singh et al. 2020; Yogalakshmi et al. 2020). 
MNPs consist of magnetic ingredients including iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) and Cobalt (Co). Because 
of minimal coercivity and great magnetization, they promote magnetic division for reutilization 
(Tombuloglu et al. 2021). They may reach surroundings such as landfill sites, sewage sludge and 
wastewater throughout their manufacture or after utilization. In this context, they may amass in soil 
and water (López-Luna et al. 2018). Nevertheless, investigations on their probable ecotoxicological 
and toxicological influences are incomplete and have yielded divisive results based on the type of 
plants and NPs employed and the conditions of manipulation (Tombuloglu et al. 2021). However, 
MNPs have gained a lot of consideration due to their green and durable chemical properties (Khan 
et al. 2020b). 
Fe-MNPs have been widely studied in several environmental treatments. Fe-MNPs are the great￾est usual metal-reducing agents, which are extensively employed to remove dyes, phenols and oil 
(Singh et al. 2020; Yogalakshmi et al. 2020). 
FIGURE 13.2 The principal factors influencing NP properties. 
FIGURE 13.3 Main MNP features. Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 217 
Fe-MNPs are good candidates for immobilizing contaminants in soils, water sources and sedi￾ments, and since they are naturally omnipresent, they have the promise to be a sustainable and 
economical technology used to develop adsorbents to perform remediation (Gillispie et al. 2019). 
Fe-MNPs (less than 20 nm) have unique magnetic properties (such as super-paramagnetism). 
Superparamagnetic αFe3O4, αFe2O3, γFe3O4 and γFe2O3 NPs have attracted significant attention due 
to their exclusive mesoporous, physical and chemical properties (Ahmadi 2020). Moreover, zero￾valent iron NPs (nZVI) are largely employed in the remediation of wastewater, soil and groundwater 
because of their high reactivity and particular redox potential (Zhang et al. 2020). However, there 
are numerous investigations on the influence of Fe-MNPs on flora; some studies highlight their 
beneficial impacts, and others report their toxic effects (Brasili et al. 2020; Pizarro et al. 2021; Yang 
et al. 2020). 
13.4 NPS AND GREEN PLANTS 
NPs can radically modify their physicochemical characteristics from bulk-sized particles and touch 
sundry components of the environment, including water, soil and air. NPs can react with their 
milieu, and plants are an important part of ecosystems. The four key factors affecting the contact 
between NPs and plants can be categorized into NPs, plants, contaminants and media (Figure 13.4). 
The interaction between green plants and NPs is an intelligent system because it (1) controls 
the liberation of compounds, (2) reduces the environmental loss of products and (3) reduces plant 
toxicity (Fincheira et al. 2020). Moreover, NPs are a natural abiotic substance produced by plants 
under environmental stress, which vitally assists in the cleanup of contaminated air, water and soil 
(Khan 2020b). 
Clearly, the successful application of NPs depends on the balance between their advantages 
and risks. In addition to the NP quantity and species of organisms, the pathway of exposure also 
crucially contributes to the generation of toxicity. NPs can stimulate plants growing at petite levels, 
whereas they become risky at superior amounts (Brasili et al. 2020). In addition, many NPs did not 
FIGURE 13.4 Different parameters affect the interaction among NPs, plants and pollutants. 218 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
disturb the germination of Oryza sativa and zea mays seeds, but the root dimension was consider￾ably restrained (Liu et al. 2020a). However, the fully non-toxic employment of NPs cannot exist 
even if no poisonous influence has been detected (Liu et al. 2020a).
Accordingly, and as reported by Hasan et al.’s (2020) synthetic method, investigations of NPs’ 
particle shape and size, dose and toxicity are essential before they are applied in the field.
The effects of NPs on plants depend on their properties (Figures 13.3 and 13.4) and plant spe￾cies. Therefore, it is helpful to know whether plants can extract NPs from the original surrounding 
and whether NPs can be transferred to other organs of plants according to the NP characteristics. 
These data are pertinent in, for example, the treatment of plant waste, the harvesting of aboveground 
plant parts after media purification or in agricultural procedures of crops for human and animal 
consumption. For example, knowing the dissemination of NPs absorbed by diverse plant organs is 
helpful to develop safe harvesting technology and prevent the combine from being exposed to risky 
phyto-accumulated NPs. The distribution of NPs in plant organs may also affect the inclusion of 
NPs into the diet of animals and/or humans who consume NPs.
13.5 FE-MNPS AND GREEN PLANTS
Fe is an indispensable nutrient for plants, beneficial in the right dose but harmful in excess. Preceding 
studies have revealed that Fe-MNPs have beneficial or phytotoxic effects on plants. Clear effects on 
crop performances were discovered in previous experiments (Table 13.1).
13.5.1 nFe2O3
The appropriate concentration of nFe2O3 could upgrade the physiological function, improve environ￾mental stress resistance, increase seed germination and develop seedling development of Citrullus 
lanatus (Li et al. 2020a), Zea mays (Li et al. 2016; Youssef et al. 2020), Coriandrum satinvum
(Fahad et al. 2020), Cicer arietinum (Irum et al. 2020), Arachis hypogaea (Rui et al. 2016) and 
Triticum aestivum (Adrees et al. 2020) (Table 13.1).
Moreover, nFe2O3 can reduce the toxicity of cadmium (Cd)2+ and the accumulation of Cd2+ in 
plant tissues by increasing the growth and iron content of maize seedlings. Furthermore, nFe2O3
could attenuate Cd2+ toxicity by involving Cd2+ detoxification mechanisms (Youssef et al. 2020).
Adrees et al. (2020) showed that nFe2O3 improved wheat physiology and growth and dimin￾ished Cd content in sundry wheat tissues under drought stress, including grains. Moreover, nFe2O3’s 
restricted levels augmented photosynthesis but diminished oxidative stress. In general, the correct 
level of nFe2O3 treatment in Cd-polluted soils could be a successful way to produce crops more 
safely (Adrees et al. 2020).
However, Lu et al. (2020) confirmed that nFe2O3 applied to leaves was stored in the seedlings of 
wheat via stomata and then transferred from the leaves to the roots. Furthermore, nFe2O3 in leaves 
provoked a Fenton-like reaction, produced severe •
OH, destroyed the redox balance and instigated 
oxidative stress. In addition, excessive •
OH can accelerate chlorophyll degradation, lead to the dimi￾nution of the chlorophyll amount and photosynthesis, and thus inhibit biomass synthesis (Lu et al. 
2020). The results are of great significance to assess the effects of atmospheric Fe-MNPs on plants 
(Lu et al. 2020).
nFe2O3 at 4 mg Kg−1 decreased A. thaliana biomass and the chlorophyll content (Marusenko et al. 
2013). Overall, 100 mg L−1 γFe2O3 NPs remarkably augmented MDA synthesis and diminished the 
chlorophyll level and activity of the root (Hu et al. 2017). Moreover, αFe2O3 NP treatment considerably 
lowered germination and the chlorophyll level. αFe2O3 NPs also caused damage to the root cell mem￾branes and altered the morphology of the root, showing that they were barley phytotoxic (Tombuloglu 
et al. 2020a).
In another study, αFe2O3 and γFe2O3 had no considerable effect on watermelon fruit growth 
(Li et al. 2020a). Compared with the control, 400 ppm of γFe2O3 NP usage diminished the fresh Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 219 TABLE 13.1 The Fe-MNP Effects on Different Plant Species MNPs Size (nm) Plant Species Concentration Observed Effect References Fe2O3 nFe2O3 5 Glycine max 15, 30 and 60 mg/pot Chlorophyll level, root development and plant biomass indices increased (Yang et al. 2020) γFe2O3 6 Glycine max 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000 or 2,000 mg L−1 Enhanced photosynthetic parameters and root elongation (Alidoust and Isoda 2013) γFe2O3 6 Oryza sativa 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000 or 2,000 mg L−1 Enhanced root elongation (Alidoust and Isoda 2014) γFe2O3 20 Citrus maxima 20, 50 and 100 mg L−1 50 mg L−1 γFe2O3 significantly improved root activity by 23.8% and the chlorophyll level by 23.2% compared to the control; γFe2O3 had no influence on the expression of the AHA gene; 50 mg L−1 of γFe2O3 and Fe3+ considerably augmented the expression intensities of the gene and congruently had an advanced activity of ferric reductase (Hu et al. 2017) γFe2O3 <50 Arachis hypogaea 2, 10, 50, 250, and 1,000 mg kg−1 Root length, plant height, chlorophyll content and biomass increased (Rui et al. 2016) nFe2O3 50–100 Triticum aestivum 25, 50 and 100 mg kg−1 Improved photosynthesis performance and Fe contents and decreased Cd contents in tissues; NPs reduced oxidative stress in the shoots (Adrees et al. 2020) nFe2O3 32.0–35.78 Zea mays 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 and 8,000 mg kg−1 Fe2O3 NPs proved dual effects: 500 mg kg−1 NPs notably promoted maize growing; 4,000 and 8,000 mg kg−1 NPs notably promoted the peroxidation of lipids (Youssef et al. 2020) αFe2O3 50±0.2 Cicer arietinum 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg L−1 Could improve the development factors of chickpea (Irum et al. 2020) αFe2O3 <50 Arabidopsis thaliana 4 mg kg−1 Chlorophyll level and biomass decreased (Marusenko et al. 2013) Fe2O3 10.2±2.6 Mycorrhizal clover 0.032, 0.32 and 3.2 mg kg−1 Biomass reduced (Feng et al. 2013) γFe2O3 20–100 Helianthus annuus 50 and 100 mg L−1 The employment of 50 mg L− 1 considerably downgraded the hydraulic conductivity of the roots by up to 57% and by 26% at 100 mg L− 1 but had no influence on the shoot or root length or on plant biomass and did not stimulate oxidative stress (Martínez- Fernández et al. 2016) γFe2O3 7–13 Oryza sativa 2, 20 and 200 mg L−1 Had a significant impact on the production of abscisic acid and indole acetic acid hormones; however, provoked inhibition of the root phytohormone (Gui et al. 2015) γFe2O3 20 Citrus maxima 20, 50 and 100 mg L−1 100 mg L−1 amplified MDA synthesis and root activity and reduced the chlorophyll amount (Hu et al. 2017)

mass but augmented the water content. Different concentrations of γFe2O3 NPs had great effects 
on the nutritional characteristics of watermelon fruit and could diminish the contents of sugar and 
total amino acids (Li et al. 2020a). In addition, diverse concentrations of αFe2O3 and γFe2O3 can 
significantly increase the content of vitamin C in fruits (Li et al. 2020a).
13.5.2 nFe3O4
Some reports have indicated that nFe3O4 may have a negative, positive and/or no effects on seed 
germination, root elongation and crop development (Cai et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020b; Pizarro et al. 
2021; Sun et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2011) (Table 13.1).
nFe3O4 may lead to severe alterations in crops, leading to genotoxicity (Kokina et al. 2017; 
Kokina et al. 2020). Kokina et al. (2020) showed that Fe3O4 NPs synchronously increase the expres￾sion of miR159c, stimulate genome instability and provoke genotoxicity in yellow medick.
Konate et al. (2018) reported that after 21 days of treatment with different nFe3O4 concentrations, 
more oxidative stress and a series of antioxidant enzyme activities were induced. Moreover, biomass 
restraint and oxidative stress were attained at small nFe3O4 concentrations (50 mg/L) (Konate et al. 
2018). Likewise, Pizarro et al. (2021) reported that Fe3O4 NPs have a negative impact on growth and 
increase oxidative stress in plants. Fe3O4 NPs could also clog the plant’s channels and prevent water 
and nutrient uptake (Pizarro et al. 2021). Conforming to Wang et al. (2011), Fe3O4 NPs were not 
transferred from the roots to the leaves in ryegrass and pumpkin but could provoke more oxidative 
stress in the two plant species.
In contrast, Plaksenkova et al. (2019) revealed that Fe3O4 NPs had a beneficial influence on the 
quality and yield of rocket seedlings and low genotoxicity and could improve the plants’ environ￾mental stress resistance. In addition, Fe3O4 NPs’ foliar deposition increased the fresh and dry plant 
masses, activated the antioxidants of the plant and increased salicylic acid synthesis and the expres￾sion of salicylic acid-sensitive PR genes, thereby increasing plant resistance against the tobacco 
mosaic virus (Cai et al. 2020). Furthermore, a lower concentration of Fe3O4 NPs notably inhibits 
the arsenic level and improves plant growth, while a higher concentration does not. It seems that 
Fe3O4 NPs have different effects according to their dosage (Khan et al. 2020a). Similarly, nFe3O4
application has significantly augmented the length of the shoots and roots of Prosopis juliflora. 
However, at greater than 200 mg Kg−1 of NPs, the shoot and root elongation and chlorophyll content 
are lowered (Kumari and Khan 2018).
A new study showed a substantial diminution in the germination rate with CoFe2O4 NPs (up 
37% at 1,000 mg L−1); nonetheless, notable growth (up 38–65%) and biomass rise (up 72–133%) 
were revealed after 3 weeks of contact with CoFe2O4 NPs (Tombuloglu et al. 2021).
Finally, Kornarzyński et al. (2020) concluded that no considerable effects of nFe3O4 and the 
magnetic field on seedling growth and seed germination were demonstrated. In this regard, Barrena 
et al. (2009) concluded that 116 µg mL−1 of Fe3O4 NPs has no toxicity for Cucumis sativus and 
Lactuca sativa seed germination. In addition, another study proved that 2,000 mg L−1 of nFe3O4 did 
not have a significant influence on the augmentation of shoot and root elongation of wheat seedlings 
(Konate et al. 2017).
13.5.3 nZVI
nZVI is the most typically studied NP and is widely employed in environmental clean-up. It has 
been proved to be an operational adsorbent, catalyst and reductant and can be utilized for a variety 
of pollutants, such as metals, halogen organic composites, dyes and pharmaceuticals (Brasili et al. 
2020; Irum et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020b; Zand et al. 2020a).
In this regard, low nZVI concentrations can encourage plant development by increasing the leaf 
area and the root length of the seedling (Mokarram-Kashtiban et al. 2019).224 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
nZVI exercised promoting influences exclusively at small doses on Typha latifolia (Ma et al. 2013), 
Oriza sativa (Guha et al. 2018, 2020a, 2020b; Li et al. 2020b), Salix alba (Mokarram-Kashtiban et al. 
2019), Arabidopsis thaliana (Yoon et al. 2019), Agrostis capillaris, Solanum lycopersicum (Brasili 
et al. 2020) and Festuca rubra (Teodoro et al. 2020). However, excessive nZVI has caused damage 
to many plants such as hybrid poplars, cattail (Ma et al. 2013) and Oryza sativa at elevated concen￾trations (Zhang et al. 2020). Meanwhile, Martínez-Fernández and Komárek (2016) reported that no 
effect was detected after Solanum lycopersicum treatment with nZVI. In contrast with Martínez￾Fernández and Komárek’s (2016) results, Brasili et al. (2020) concluded that Solanum lycopersicum
treatment with nZVI (100 and 1,000 mg L−1) negatively influenced the germination of tomato seeds.
Using ZVI NPs at a small dose (50 mg L−1) augmented chlorophyll content by 30.7%. They also 
improved plant stress as confirmed by decreased oxidative stress and reduced contents of phyto￾hormones such as indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellin. Small-dose ZVI NP applications lead to a 
greater stock of Fe in plants and regulate the expression of YSL15 and IRT1 (Li et al. 2020b).
The utilization of 50 and 250 mg L−1 of nZVI attenuated the oxidative stress induced by 
Quinclorac. Nevertheless, 750 mg Kg−1 of nZVI severely destroyed the seedlings of Oryza sativa, 
perhaps due to the lack of active iron (Zhang et al. 2020).
It is emphasized that, at Citrus maxima harvest, the level of Fe deficiency was classed in the fol￾lowing succeeding order: Fe-free treatment > Fe3+ > α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3 NPs > Fe3O4 NPs. This partly 
determined that nFe3O4 was less sensitive to the uptake and use by plants than other iron oxide NPs 
(Li et al. 2018).
The controversy in the published findings may be principally related to the plant species, NPs or 
culture medium utilized in diverse investigations. Therefore, more experiments are needed to com￾pletely comprehend the influences of Fe-based NPs so that they can be safely utilized in agriculture 
and environmental remediation (Li et al. 2020b).
Accordingly, some Fe-MNPs have an encouraging influence on plant growth, which is advan￾tageous to the nano-phytoremediation of environmental pollutants. Nevertheless, some Fe-MNPs 
also have poisonous consequences on plants, as exposed in Figure 13.5.
13.6 FE-MNPS AND ECOSYSTEM REMEDIATION
In terms of environmental remediation and resource conservation, NPs are considered cost-effective, 
efficient and environmentally friendly replacements to current processing materials (Nwadinigwe 
and Ugwu 2019). The beneficial impacts of NPs on living communities, ecosystem functions and 
exchanges beyond ecosystem boundaries deserve exclusive consideration (Ahmad et al. 2019). The 
magnetic quality of MNPs has significantly influenced the physical characteristics of water pollut￾ants and contributes to water purification (Shahi et al. 2021). Moreover, MNPs have been revealed 
to be efficient in the degradation of several types of dyes from textile effluents (Yogalakshmi et al. 
2020) and in the clean-up of metal-polluted soil, sediment and water (Latif et al. 2020).
The combination of biosorption technologies and magnetic separation can effectively achieve the 
adsorption of metal ions, which has the advantages of being an environmentally friendly, low cost and 
flexible operation (Khan et al. 2020b). As a suitable adsorbent, MNPs have the following advantages: 
(1) a significant amount of particles can be formed by a simple and convenient technique; (2) important 
adsorption capacity; (3) low toxicity and an exceptional magnetic force; and (4) metal adsorbents are 
easy to separate from the wastewater treated by an external magnetic field (Khan et al. 2020b).
Fe-based NPs such as ZVI, Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and FeOOH NPs have been utilized for numerous 
usages in environmental fields. For example, nZVI is employed to clean up polluted soil and water. 
In this context, nZVI can simultaneously reduce the availability of As, Pb, Zn, Se, Cr, Cu, Cd, Sb, 
Ag, Hg and Ni in polluted soil (Baragaño et al. 2020c; Galdames et al. 2020; Slijepčević et al. 2021). 
The interaction between metals and nZVI can be recapitulated as oxidation/reoxidation, reduc￾tion, adsorption, coprecipitation and precipitation (Xue et al. 2018). Moreover, nZVI usually has 
been utilized in the remediation of organic pollutants (PAHs, perchlorate, nitrate, TCE, bromoform, Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 225
ibuprofen, DDT, etc.) (Galdames et al. 2020). Iron oxide has similarly been investigated as a sub￾stitute for nZVI, while the majority of studies have concentrated on water remediation (Singh et al. 
2020). nFe3O4 and nFe2O3 have excellent potential to be utilized in water treatment because of their 
super-paramagnetic and adsorption attributes (Li et al. 2020b; Singh et al. 2021).
nFe3O4 has been revealed to be more effective as an arsenic (As) adsorbent, and iron oxide NPs 
are very effective in eliminating As from aqueous milieus due to the strong affinity of iron oxides for 
As (Pizarro et al. 2021). Moreover, Fe3O4 NPs can extract Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cu, Zn and Fe from water 
and soil samples within a 20-min time interval, and the removal efficiency for metal ions is between 
50 and 95% (Singh et al. 2021). Furthermore, nFe3O4 decreased the As, polyaromatic hydrocarbon 
(PAH) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) contents in polluted soils (
a, unique super
obial immobiliz
 oxide NPs are 
Baragaño et al. 2020b).
In addition, due to their enormous specific surface are -paramagnetism and easy 
separation, MNPs are widely employed as enzyme or micr ing vectors in wastewater 
treatment (Shahi et al. 2021; Yogalakshmi et al. 2020). Iron high potential wastewater 
remediation agents due to their chemical inertness, high adsorption capacity and super-paramagnetism. 
Fe3O4 NPs can encourage the synthesis and activity of degrading enzymes. They are likewise respon￾sible for improving membrane permeability. Consequently, nFe3O4 is the most investigated immobiliza￾tion vector in bioremediation (Shahi et al. 2021).
FIGURE 13.5 Benefits and toxic effects of Fe-MNPs on plants.226 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
Iron oxide NPs have been applied in several environmental sectors, such as aquatic nano￾remediation, due to their exclusive super-paramagnetic and nano-specific properties. However, 
iron oxide NPs provoke excessive Fe bioaccumulation in the whole soft part of Biomphalaria 
glabrata tissue. Chronic exposure to iron oxide NPs increased the behavior harms of snails and 
reduced fertility, while fertility reduction and mortality were detected after exposure to iron 
oxide NPs at 15.6 mg L−1 (Caixeta et al. 2021). Numerous morphological modifications and 
cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and larvae have also been identified (Pereira et al. 2020). 
In addition, Lacalle et al. (2020) revealed that, different from the existence of organic change, 
nano-remediation with nZVI was not a useable choice for Cr(VI)-polluted soils under the experi￾mental conditions. Kamran et al. (202

Finally, NP tly to remove organic contaminants by adsorption, chemical 
modification and immobilization of the vectors of enzymes or microbes, and they can also serve as 
a facilitator in the phytoremediation and/or bioremediation of pollutants. Nevertheless, the human 
health and environmental dangers related to NPs must be assessed before employment for real 
usages, specifically in cases of the direct use of these elements by humans (Saleh 2020).
13.7 PHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation employs green plants to degrade, remove, contain or stabilize contaminants in 
environmental milieus (soil, water and air). Phytoremediation strategies applied to polluted ecosys￾tems involve phytoextraction, phytovolatilization, phytostabilization, rhizodegradation and phyto￾degradation (Figure 13.6). It is recorded that phytoextraction is the most useful and acknowledged 
phytoremediation approach for reducing environmental pollution. Moreover, phytoremediation

phytoextraction candidate (Nouri et al. 2013).
Source: Adapted from Song et al. (2019)Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 227
technology has attracted increasingly more consideration because of its economical, environmental 
protection and self-propulsion advantages.
Phytoremediation involves a series of biochemical procedures that incorporate (1) systems of tol￾erance to probable contaminants; (2) the generation of phyto-chelators for transport; (3) microbial￾plant exchanges; and (4) plant absorption (Ebrahimbabaie et al. 2020).
Phytoremediation is a promising technology, but its effect is influenced by many features, includ￾ing the plant species, rhizoplane microorganisms, climate conditions, pollutant quantities, pollutant 
bioavailability and environmental matrix conditions (Zand et al. 2020a).
Due to the slow growth of hyperaccumulator plants, a limited treatment depth and long repair 
cycle, traditional phytoremediation methods are not economical for large-scale application (Souza 
et al. 2020). Therefore, nano-phytoremediation could be a successful method to solve this problem.
13.7.1 Phytoremediation of Fe-MNPs
Plant uptake and accumulation of NPs are the fundamental factors in the potential effect of 
nano-phytoremediation. NPs’ uptake by plants is influenced by many features as recapitulated 
in Figure 13.4. Therefore, sometimes contradictory results will appear regarding NP plant uptake 
(Ebrahimbabaie et al. 2020).
The processes of NP uptake, accumulation and translocation in plants are influenced by (1) the 
stability and type of NPs, (2) the plant physiology and cell structure and (3) the interaction between 
NPs and the media (Fincheira et al. 2020). It is highlighted that the detailed absorption, accumu￾lation and translocation of NPs are yet undiscovered (Fincheira et al. 2020). Plants have special 
obstructions to control the access of NPs; cell wall constituents can regulate the solubility and fluid￾ity of NPs according to their characteristics (Fincheira et al. 2020).
Notably, rhizosphere, rhizoplane and/or endophytic microorganisms could modulate physio￾chemical interactions with NPs. In this context, various examinations have revealed the ability of 
bacterial and fungal species to tolerate, accumulate and/or detoxify metals to control the perfor￾mance of NP-contaminants. In the meantime, fungi can create a robust association with plants by 
controlling the amount of metal NPs inside the plant (Fincheira et al. 2020).
Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska et al. (2012) studied the accumulation aptitude of nFe3O4 by L. sati￾vum and P. sativum. These species have stored > 90% of nfe3O4 in the roots due to their high adsorp￾tion (approximately 7.8 g Kg−1 for L. sativum and 39.5 g Kg−1 for P. sativum).
Zhu et al. (2008) examined the consequence of nFe3O4 on pumpkins (Cucurbita maxima) and 
found that nFe3O4 was transported and accumulated in pumpkin tissue. However, Wang et al. 
(2011) revealed that nFe3O4 was not stored in ryegrass and pumpkin. It is worth remarking that 
Zhu et al. (2008) indicated that diverse plants have different responses to NPs. Bystrzejewska￾Piotrowska et al. (2012) believed that the Fe3O4 accumulation in growth liquid and other media is 
dose-dependent.
13.8 NANO-PHYTOREMEDIATION
Nanotechnology can modernize numerous environmental restoration and water management tech￾nologies (Romeh 2020; Souri et al. 2020). The environmental employment of NPs has attracted 
specific consideration in recent years. These NPs have outstanding physicochemical features such 
as a large surface area and petite size (Figure 13.4), which improves their performance compared 
to their bulk counterparts (Hasan et al. 2020). Recently, there has been increasing attention on the 
progress of bioharmoniously engineered NPs with various physiochemical traits for different types 
of technological applications (Souri et al. 2020).
Nanotechnology is the science of creating and using “small” constituent parts with proportions 
of 10–9 m (Martínez-Fernández and Komárek 2016), characterized by the utilization of extremely 
small fabricated particles (NPs). Phytoremediation, in contrast, is an aspect of biological remediation 228 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
that employs green plants to eliminate, transport, stabilize and/or degrade pollutants in soil, water 
and sediments. Nano-phytoremediation is a combination of nanotechnology and phytoremediation 
for the cleaning of contaminated milieus (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2012; Nwadinigwe and Ugwu 2019; 
Pillai and Kottekottil 2016; Romeh and Saber 2020; Hidalgo et al. 2020).
As noted, the phytoremediation method is termed a clean and green eco-friendly method to clean 
up contaminated ecosystems, but often, it takes a long time to operate (Zhu et al. 2019). Therefore, 
grouping phytoremediation and nanotechnology (nano-phytoremediation) has attracted the consid￾eration of numerous researchers for environmental management.
As described by Nwadinigwe and Ugwu (2019), numerous procedures including nano￾phytodegradation, nano-phytoaccumulation and nano-phytostabilization can take place simultane￾ously in one plant. The grouping of nanotechnology and phytoremediation has been revealed to be 
more operative than NP-free soil (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2012). It is crucial to guarantee that the by￾products of poisonous pollutants that are degraded in the nano-phytoremediation procedure do not 
appear in the food chain or groundwater.
13.8.1 Fe-MNP-Based Nano-Phytoremediation
The use of NPs to sustain the phytoremediation of polluted soils is slowly attracting worldwide 
attention (Song et al. 2019). MNPs have an imperative task in the nano-phytoremediation approach. 
They can directly remove organic and inorganic pollutants (Figure 13.7), upgrade plant progress 
and improve the phytoavailability of pollutants (that is, increase the plants’ pollutant upta
r and genetic chara
t al. 2020) and in 
d ecosystems. Thes
mediation is a com

ke) (Song 
et al. 2019). Moreover, NPs can significantly regulate the molecula cteristics 
of hyperaccumulator plants, promote nano-phytoremediation (Rai e this way, 
increase the effectiveness of nano-phytoremediation in contaminate e effects 
depend on a number of factors (Figure 13.8). Therefore, nano-phytore plex pro￾cess in which plant physiology, NP transformation, pollutant reaction nteract to 
guide the process (Figure 13.8). The recent studies of MNPs to upgrade the nano-phytoremediation 
of contaminated ecosystems are reviewed in Table 13.2.
FIGURE 13.7 Recapitulation of the key pollutants remediated with Fe-MNP-based nano-phytoremediation.Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 229
Certain studies have demonstrated the role of Fe-MNPs in improving nano-phytoremediation, 
and as shown in Table 13.2, nZVIs are widely used. In this regard, nZVI particles have been found to 
effectively accelerate the nano-phytoremediation of TNT (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2013; Jiamjitrpanich 
et al. 2012), enriched soil with endosulfan (Pillai and Kottekottil 2016) and heavy metals (Vítková 
et al. 2018; Hidalgo et al. 2020; Gong et al. 2021). According to the research results, the most com￾monly identified Fe-MNP-based nano-phytoremediation strategies include the following.
13.8.1.1 Fe-MNP-Based Nano-Phytoextraction
The employment of reasonable levels of nZVI (100–500 mg Kg−1) improved the aptitude to accu￾mulate Pb in the roots (142.22 ± 4.47 mg Kg−1) and shoots (49.78 ± 5.87 mg Kg−1) of K. scoparia, 
judged against the control treatment. In contrast, advanced amounts of nZVI have shown Pb transfer 
suppression, chlorophyll content decrease, inhibitory impacts on plant growth and, thus, the effi￾ciency of Pb remediation (Zand and Tabrizi 2020). In t
ed levels produce
his context, minor amounts of utilized nZVI 
increased plant growth, while elevat d nanotoxicity (Ma et al. 2013; Guha et al. 
2020b).
In antimony (Sb)-polluted soil, the combined application of nZVI and plant growth-promoting 
bacteria (PGPR) stimulated the development of T. repens. The accumulation of Sb was greater in 
the aerial parts than in the roots of T. repens. The maximum accumulation of Sb in T. repens was 
3,896.4 μg/Kg (Zand et al. 2020a). However, the usage of 1,000 mg/kg of nZVI has harmful con￾sequences on plant evolution and phytoremediation capacity. Therefore, the joint employment of 
nZVI and PGPR can diminish the need for nZVI to remediate metalloid-contaminated soil (Zand 
et al. 2020a).
Additionally, the accumulation and transportation of nFe3O4 and F in plant tissues have been 
confirmed (Kumari and Khan 2018). In this respect, the application of nFe3O4 at 200 mg Kg−1 sig￾nificantly augmented the stem and root length of Prosopis juliflora and encouraged the accumula￾tion of F in stems and roots of up to 34.64 and 28.43 mg Kg−1, respectively (Kumari and Khan 2018). 
Thus, the utilization of nFe3O4 up to 200 mg Kg−1 could improve the fluoride absorption efficiency 
of Prosopis juliflora (Kumari and Khan 2018).

Gong et al. (2021) confirmed that 100 mg Kg−1 nZVI improved Cd accumulation by 13% and 
decreased dry biomass slightly but not significantly; other amounts of nZVI significantly down￾graded the dry biomass. The existence of Fe and Fe(OH)x on the exterior of nZVI might react with 
Cd (establishing composites such as FeOCdOH), which could enhance the reducible amount 
of Cd in polluted sediments (Gong et al. 2021). nZVI usage can promote the phytoremediation of a 
Cd-polluted environment by modifying Cd portions, sediment characteristics and structure of the 
bacterial community (Gong et al. 2021).
Gong et al. (2017) showed that nZVI (100 mg Kg−1) encouraged the accumulation and transloca￾tion of Cd in Boehmeria nivea seedlings. In addition, 100 mg Kg−1 nZVI could alleviate the oxida￾tive damage of Boehmeria nivea under Cd stress, while 500 and 1,000 mg Kg−1 nZVI restrained 
plant development and provoked oxidative damage (Gong et al. 2017). Therefore, a low amount of 
nZVI can enhance the phytoremediation efficiency of metal-contaminated sites.
Huang et al. (2018) proved that the overall Pb levels in Lolium perenne with the usage of small 
amounts of nZVI (<500 mg Kg−1) were higher than those without nZVI. Nevertheless, the total 
content of Pb in Lolium perenne diminished at elevated levels of nZVI (>1,000 mg Kg−1). Moreover, 
small levels of nZVI (<500 mg Kg−1) can effectively promote the growth of Lolium perenne, encour￾age the absorption and transportation of Pb, and improve the stabilization of Pb in sediments. 
This shows that nZVI-aided phytoremediation is an encouraging technique for the remediation of 
Pb-polluted sediments (Huang et al. 2018). Therefore, 100 mg Kg−1 was the optimal dose of nZVI to 
aid in the phytoremediation of lead-contaminated sediments (Huang et al. 2018).
The usage of nZVI notably augmented the accumulating competence of Trifolium repens for 
Cd (Zand et al. 2020b). The accumulation of Cd in Trifolium repens roots was significantly higher 
than the shoots, indicating that the roots of Trifolium repens were the preferred storage organ for 
Cd (Zand et al. 2020b).
Moreover, nZVI’s interaction with Avicennia Germinans is an effective way to boost the bio￾availability of Pb2+ and Cd2+ and allow plants to translocate them well to their aboveground parts 
(Hidalgo et al. 2020).
Furthermore, Mokarram-Kashtiban et al. (2019) reported that an elevated amount of nZVI had 
no encouraging consequence on heavy metal absorption and bioconcentration factor (BCF) for Salix 
alba and that it instigated stress and diminished development of Salix alba. Nevertheless, a small 
amount of nZVI had no damaging influence on plant development or the biochemical and physi￾ological parameters and augmented the root measurement and leaf surface according to the plant 
root Cd accumulation and the Cd BCF level in seedlings. They also showed that a small quantity of 
nZVI could advance phytoremediation efficiency, and the use of rhizosphere microorganisms could 
diminish the stress of nZVI on plants, even at a high dose.
Souri et al. (2020) indicated the high efficiency of nFe3O4@GSH as a new As nano￾phytoremediation promoter for Isatis cappadocica. They also proved that the advantageous con￾sequences of nFe3O4@GSH on As nano-phytoremediation are due to the improvement of the 
activities of numerous enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidants (Souri et al. 2020).
13.8.1.2 Fe-MNP-Based Nano-Phytostabilization
The utilization of immobilization agents in general, including nZVI, can reduce the solubility 
and bioavailability of contaminants (Baragaño et al. 2020a). This is an important factor in nano￾phytostabilization and in establishing a vegetation covering that can lead to ecological restoration. 
Increased levels of nZVI in the growing medium augmented the uptake of Fe and Mg and dimin￾ished the Fe translocation factor for Festuca rubra and Agrostis capillaris (Teodoro et al. 2020). 
The stabilization of inorganic pollutants can be deemed as one of the greatest practical and feasible 
substitutes for the restoration and protection of seriously polluted soils (Baragaño et al. 2020c).
Adrees et al. (2020) reported that the appropriate amount of nFe2O3 in Cd-contaminated soil 
immobilizes Cd in soil, decreases Cd bioavailability, diminishes Cd translocation to aerial tissues 
and grains and therefore reduces the Cd content in grains.Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 233
In general, the three promising procedures for the diminution of Cd stress by Fe-MNPs are 
(i) reducing Cd accumulation in roots and stems, (ii) diminishing oxidative stress caused by Cd 
accumulation and (iii) controlling nutrient uptake, which should lead to oxidative protection 
(Rahmatizadeh et al. 2019). Generally, NPs can affect the organismal, cellular or molecular level 
of plants in many ways by (1) disrupting physiological processes, (2) releasing particulate forms 
and ions, (3) inducing oxidative stress and (4) impairing or altering plant gene expression (Liu 
et al. 2020a).
Mohammadi et al. (2020) proved that with an nZVI concentration increase, the Cr absorption rate 
of plants decreased, which significantly enhanced the morphological and physiological characteris￾tics of plants. nZVI treatment decreased the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and transport factor (TF) 
in the roots and shoots, but with an increase in Cr(VI) concentrations, the BAF and TF decreased sig￾nificantly. In addition, Cr stress increased the antioxidant enzyme activity, and adding nZVI further 
augmented this activity, thus improving the growth features (Mohammadi et al. 2020). Furthermore, 
nZVI could improve sunflower plant properties under Cr contamination by diminishing the absorp￾tion of Cr and increasing the activities of intracellular detoxification enzymes (Mohammadi et al. 
2020).
Vítková et al. (2018) stated that the employment of nZVI may benefit the stabilization of As in 
the rhizosphere of sunflower. They added nZVI to polluted soil; after a 5-week growing period, the 
content of As in the soil declined by more than 80%, and the accumulation of As in the shoots and 
roots diminished by 24% and 47%, respectively (Vítková et al. 2018). Thus, the utilization of nZVI 
stabilizes metals in the soil and decreases the absorption of As, Cd, Pb and zinc (Zn) in Helianthus 
annuus and Lolium perenne (Vítková et al. 2018).
Gil-Díaz et al. (2016) confirmed the usefulness of nZVI in diminishing the availability of As in 
heavily As-polluted soil. In this regard, the inferior availability of As in soils treated with 10% nZVI 
encouraged the growth of barley and reduced the uptake of As (Gil-Díaz et al. 2016).
Jiamjitrpanich et al. (2013) indicated that the nano-phytostabiliziation of TNT and its metabo￾lites in polluted soil resulted in advanced accumulation of TNT and its metabolites in the roots.
Nano-phytostabilization is an effective restoration method that employs species that can accu￾mulate or precipitate pollutants in the root zone to establish vegetation cover, thus reducing pol￾lutant mobility and bioavailability (Lebrun et al. 2019; Sigua et al. 2019). Therefore, species that 
simultaneously tolerate high levels of contamination and have a large fasciculate root organization, 
a fast-growing organization, long longevity, simple maintenance, appropriate contamination toler￾ance and an underground metal store are suitable applicants for nano-phytostabilization (Sigua et al. 
2019). The interaction among the plant species, the designated immobilizer and consequently, the 
pollutant will determine the remediation procedure. The encouraging results of these interactions 
in soil remediation contribute to successful nano-phytostabilization. Therefore, understanding such 
interactions has recently attracted a lot of consideration (Teodoro et al. 2020).
Bidabadi (2020) proved that the utilization of Fe-MNPs notably enhanced plant development and 
encouraged plant protection tools against heavy metal toxicity. However, they had an undesirable 
effect on the phytoremediation features of S. splendens by lessening the heavy metal accumulation 
in plant tissues. Therefore, the utilization of Fe-MNPs is not appropriate to support the phytoreme￾diation aptitude of S. splendens (Bidabadi 2020).
13.8.1.3 Fe-MNP-Based Nano-Phytodegradation
nZVI increased personal care product (PCP) degradation and facilitated its rhizosphere microbial 
degradation (Liu et al. 2020b). Liu et al. (2020b) revealed that the cooperation of nZVI and rice 
cultivation offers a broader path of PCP degradation. Additionally, root iron plate formation was 
encouraged by adding 100 mg of nZVI Kg−1 to PCP-polluted soil, which upgraded the quality and 
yield of the rice. Co-treatment with nZVI and rice agriculture has synergistically incorporated the 
dehalogenation capabilities of nZVI and rhizosphere microorganisms to realize soil clean-up (Liu 
et al. 2020b).234 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
Romeh (2020) verified that the utilization of nZVI as a green nanotechnology and P. major as a 
candidate for the phytoremediation approach plays a key role in the elimination of chlorpyrifos from 
water with an important reduction in the toxic degradation product (TCP). Moreover, the grouping 
of nano-phytoremediation technology, green nanotechnology and solubility enhancement agents 
is of great significance for the clean-up of chlorfenapyr-polluted soil and water (Romeh and Saber 
2020). The consequence of nZVI may be that chlorpyrifos degrades to TCP, which is stored in the 
leaves and roots of P. major (Romeh 2020).
The nZVI and enzyme degradation mechanism of endosulfan seems to be hydrolysis and contin￾uous dehalogenation. Moreover, the adding of nZVI could promote the reductive dechlorination of 
endosulfan; thus, only a small amount of endosulfan was accumulated in these plants (Cymbopogon 
citratus, Ocimum sanctum and Alpinia calcarata) (Pillai and Kottekottil 2016). Researchers found 
that that nano-phytoremediation technology could remove endosulfan from soil rapidly and effec￾tively, and A. calcarata and nZVI could accelerate the removal of endosulfan from the soil in 30 
days (Pillai and Kottekottil 2016).
In the combination of Plantago major and nZVI, the degradation of chlorfenapyr increased from 
the soil (Romeh and Saber 2020). Likewise, the rapid and efficient elimination of chlorfenapyr 
from water was revealed using Plantago major and nZVI (Romeh and Ibrahim Saber 2020). Romeh 
and Saber (2020) confirmed that the effect of nano-phytoremediation was better than phytoreme￾diation for cleaning-up chlorfenapyr-polluted water. Similarly, endosulfan nano-phytoremediation 
was more effective than endosulfan phytoremediation within 7 days (Pillai and Kottekottil 2016). 
Consequently, green nanotechnology based on nZVI and phytoremediation serves an imperative 
function in pesticide removal from the ecosystem.
Jiamjitrpanich et al. (2012) verified that the degradation and elimination competence of TNT in 
polluted soil was better by nano-phytoremediation than by nano-remediation and phytoremediation. 
The highest elimination competence of nano-phytoremediation was attained in soil with a TNT/
nZVI ratio of 1/10 that is treated with P. maximum (Jiamjitrpanich et al. 2012).
Overall, Fe-MNPs appear to be a promising option for strategies to mobilize and immobilize 
soil nano-remediation when joined with other techniques such as phytoremediation (Baragaño et al. 
2020c). When using NPs in nano-phytoremediation or agriculture, it is crucial to consider the serious 
consequences on plants under actual conditions (Pizarro et al. 2021).
Nano-phytoremediation is a novel practice to clean up polluted soils, water and sediments. 
To date, the manipulation of nZVI in soils with plants has been chiefly limited due to stresses 
produced in plants by these NPs (Huang et al. 2018; Mokarram-Kashtiban et al. 2019), and 
the data on the clean-up of polluted soils under the joint influence of plants and nZVI are still 
weak.
Indeed, the application of elevated amounts of certain NPs for clean-up applications has higher 
research interest because of their unclear consequences on the environment and likely lethal impacts 
on animals, microorganisms and plants; contradictory results have been published in the literature 
as discussed in section 13.4. An ideal plant for removing environmental pollutants should have a 
variability of the features shown in Figure 13.9.
Currently, nano-phytoremediation strategies are still in the exploration and experimental stage, 
but their employment provides a new way to advance the efficiency of nano-phytoremediation. 
Figure 13.10 illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of nano-phytoremediation.
13.9 NANO-PHYTOREMEDIATION APPLICATIONS
13.9.1 Nano-Phytoremediation of Pollutants in Soil
Soil contamination by poisonous substances is a recurring problem instigated by environmental 
catastrophes, industrialization, petroleum combustion and urbanization, which participate in soil 
contamination (Souza et al. 2020). Therefore, the clean-up of poisons in the soil is still a critical Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 235

subject as polluted soils could disturb the environment, human health and agricultural security 
(Nouri and Haddioui 2016a; Nouri and Haddioui 2016b; Nouri et al. 2017).
NPs employed for the nano-phytoremediation of polluted topsoil should be non-toxic to vegeta￾tions and their rhizosphere and rhizosplane microorganisms, and can be combined with pollutants 236 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
to make them bioavailable to improve the phytoextraction procedure. Sundry NPs formed by topsoil 
microorganisms and plants also encourage the synthesis of phytohormones, resulting in a superior 
biomass and good extraction of soil pollutants to plant organs (Khan 2020b).
The joint application of nZVI and PGPR can diminish the need for nZVI in the remediation 
of metalloid-contaminated soil. The intelligent application of plants (Trifolium repens) com￾bined with NPs and PGPR for antimony removal from soil has broad application prospects 
(Zand et al. 2020a).
The content of Cd in the tissues of Trifolium repens improved with an increase in the nZVI 
amount. Moreover, the combined treatment of nZVI and biochar is beneficial to the phytoremedia￾tion of topsoil metals and has broad usage prospects in topsoil clean-up (Zand et al. 2020b).
nZVI participates with an imperative function in soil in-situ clean-up by fixing Cd and enhancing 
vegetable growth (Guha et al. 2020a). Nevertheless, to guarantee the commercial use of nZVI, it is 
necessary to conduct repetitive field trials and exhaustive investigations on the impact of nZVI on 
topsoil and microflora ecosystems (Guha et al. 2020a).
13.9.2 Nano-Phytoremediation for Water Contamination
Regardless of the source, the majority of released NPs are expected to finally arrive to water 
milieus. Finding and quantifying the quantity of NPs in natural situations is difficult because uti￾lized technologies and methods have not yet been standardized. Certain aquatic vegetation’s apti￾tude to absorb and store metals to remove metal-contaminated water and sediments have been 
verified. Some vegetation has been distinguished that can absorb NPs via roots or leaves.
It is imperative to comprehend the exchanges between NPs and aquatic vegetation and to evalu￾ate the probable influences on metal absorption and phytoremediation methods (Ebrahimbabaie 
et al. 2020).
Once arriving in aquatic and terrestrial settings, NPs are subjected to several biological, chemi￾cal and physical variations. NPs can undergo agglomeration, dissolution, adsorption, redox effects, 
deposition and further procedures, which frequently occur simultaneously. The diverse modifica￾tions of NPs depend on their native characteristics (Figures 13.4 and 13.8). In addition, NPs are very 
sensitive to the chemical conditions of the reception milieu (Figures 13.4 and 13.8) (Ebrahimbabaie 
et al. 2020).
The absorption, storage or utilization of pollutants by plants are the vital features to improve the 
quality of water and preserve the survival of aquatic organisms. Due to the strong absorption and 
accumulation potential of numerous forms of aquatic vegetation, phytoremediation has become a 
hopeful technology to remove surplus metals from aquatic environments. Moreover, several types 
of aquatic vegetation fix metals to the root and the root area. Rhizosphere and rhizoplane micro￾organisms also participate with imperative functions in the phytoremediation of aquatic locations 
(Ebrahimbabaie et al. 2020).
The capacity of aquatic vegetation to eliminate metals, either in a dissolved form or as NPs, 
depends on the characteristics of the roots, genotypes (e.g., rapid reproduction) and physiology. 
If vegetation is to be utilized for phytoremediation, then all of these factors must be counted 
(Ebrahimbabaie et al. 2020).
Constructed wetlands can utilize the aptitude of aquatic vegetation to fix and/or absorb NPs. 
So far, the elimination of NPs in constructed wetlands has not attracted enough consideration 
(Ebrahimbabaie et al. 2020).
Bao et al. (2019) assessed the removal efficiency of silver NPs by a vertical movement wetland 
technique. The results revealed that the removal rate of water-soluble NPs by a constructed wet￾land planted with P. australis was 78.53%, that of an unplanted system was 40.96% and that of 
plants was 37.57% (Bao et al. 2019). However, P. australis has not shown great effectiveness in 
removing cerium NPs (Hu et al. 2018), as these plants remove only 17.9% of the NPs (principally 
stored in the roots). A maximum number of NPs are stored in the biofilm of the system, and their 
harmfulness to vegetation and microorganisms is very obvious (Hu et al. 2018).Magnetic Nanoparticles for Nano-Phytoremediation 237
Huang et al. (2019) also revealed the effective elimination of silver NPs (about 96%) by planting Iris 
pseudacorus in a vertical movement wetland and detected the diminution of COD (83%), total N (61%), 
NH3 (42%) and total phosphorus (P) (70%). However, there are few investigations on the elimination of 
NPs in wetlands and the role of vegetation in this process. The available findings are only separate studies 
that do not normally include the interaction with other environmental factors (Ebrahimbabaie et al. 2020).
The application of nFe3O4@GSH (200 mg/L) considerably upgraded Isatis cappadocica devel￾opment in aqueous media and lessened the poisonous traces in As-treated plants (Souri et al. 2020).
13.10 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF 
NANO-PHYTOREMEDIATION
With the progression of nanotechnology and bioremediation technology, the usage of NPs for phy￾toremediation is an innovative idea. Despite the many benefits of nano-phytoremediation, there are 
still several challenges in its application to pollutant remediation that require special attention in 
future studies, including NPs and nano-phytoremediation challenges (Figure 13.11).
Consequently, to achieve effective nano-phytoremediation under different environmental treat￾ment conditions, it is obligatory to conduct a large number of studies on promising NPs and plant 
species. Most recent research was conducted in closed environments (laboratory or greenhouse), 
and the results are sometimes unreliable or even contradictory. Therefore, it is mandatory to per￾form further studies under normal environmental conditions and in the field to better comprehend 
the encouraging and undesirable effects of Fe-MNPs on plants, biodiversity and human life. In 
addition, the literature on the regeneration of Fe-MNPs is very limited, so it is crucial to study the 
regeneration process for environmental sustainable develop
 the respons
ment.
Moreover, it is necessary to further study es of NPs to diverse vegetable species, 
contaminants, media types and climatic conditions in plant protection systems. Therefore, to 
diminish the potential risk of Fe-MNPs in the soil-plant system, further study is required on 
the fate, migration and action mechanism of Fe-MNPs in the soil-plant system. Additionally, it 
is obligatory to investigate the harmfulness of Fe-MNPs and their absorption by plants over a

long time. More consideration should be given to whole life cycle experiments. Consequently, it 
is crucial to examine the trophic migration of Fe-MNPs in the food chain. Finally, the efficient 
production of NPs necessitates more care to amplify intelligent nano-materials for environmental 
purification.
13.11 CONCLUSION
This chapter is helpful to progress knowledge concerning nano-phytoremediation. The collected 
literature clearly shows that Fe-MNPs can remove pollutants, are easily absorbed by plants, pro￾mote plant development and advance the phytoavailability of pollutants; thus, FeMNPs improve the 
nano-phytoremediation efficiency of polluted environmental matrices.
Low concentrations of Fe-MNP can modify plant carotene and chlorophyll, intensify plant pro￾tein content, progress the plant photosynthesis rate, encourage growth, improve soil richness and 
diminish the availability of metals and toxicity to vegetation. However, high amounts of Fe-MNPs 
have poisonous effects on plants, which are mainly manifested as germination and growth inhibi￾tion, leaf toxicity, oxidative stress promotion and induced genotoxicity.
Accordingly, nano-phytoremediation technology that combines NPs with plants has broad appli￾cation prospects in environmental remediation, and its development direction should be quickly 
found in large-scale application. To accomplish this, additional investigation is required, and the 
long-term performance of nano-phytoremediation systems needs to be further studied.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
The environment needs continuous observation of the impurities that are added to it through dif￾ferent anthropogenic activities; this will, in turn, lead us to understand and help us to manage the 
threats posed to human health and the environment. Increases in the global temperature and envi￾ronmental pollution level are some of the notable global defects of current times (Rogers 2006; Soler 
and Sánchez 2014; Pino et al. 2017). In addition, the scarcity of fresh water, especially in underde￾veloped countries, is creating a life-threatening situation that needs to be addressed as quickly as 
possible (Qu et al. 2013; Thines et al. 2017). Nanotechnology, as one of the interdisciplinary areas of 
science, has generated tremendous potential and has received sufficient attention from researchers. 
Presently, nanotechnology is a swiftly evolving area of investment from which most countries are 
interested in obtaining commercial benefits. Nanotechnology can be summarized as technologi￾cal innovation and development at the atomic and molecular levels that uses a measuring scale of 
one to one hundred nm in any dimension. Since the generally employed treatment methods have 
a number of limitations in decreasing the amount of pollutants exclusively in water and soil, this 
has ultimately resulted in their reduced use on a comprehensive scale and in long-term applications 
(Ifang et al. 2014). Employment of nanomaterial and microbes for the abstraction of environmental 
pollutants has received great impetus and consideration from the scientific community as it has 
one important feature: sustainability (Werkneh and Rene 2019). Moreover, the use of nanoparticles 
(NPs) has been thoroughly explored for their incredible potential in the remediation of water, air 
and soil contaminants (Boente et al. 2018; Guerra et al. 2018a, 2018b; Mueller and Nowack 2010; 
Tratnyek and Johnson 2006; Wang et al. 2018; Yunus et al. 2012). Nanoscience actually provides 
prospective solutions by allowing the investigation of materials at the nanoscale (Das et al. 2015).
After nanomaterial has been employed in the remediation process, it is very important to ensure 
that the utilized material does not act as a contaminant itself. Therefore, there is an urgent need for 
biodegradable material in this field of application. Using biodegradable nanomaterial will ensure 
that there is no production of waste after the remediation process, which will, in turn, increase 
consumer confidence and the recognition of a new greener/safer alternative for different types of 
environmental pollution remediation. Off-targeting results in low efficiency, and overcoming the 
target-specific capture of pollutants is a good option and especially appealing. Thus, consider￾able work has been published in this regard that considers not only the use of nanotechnology but 
also merging it with physical and chemical modifications on the surface of the materials to obtain 
engineered NPs that overcome the challenges involved in environmental remediation (Kamat and 
Meisel 2003). Although NPs have generated tremendous potential for environmental remediation, 
unfortunately, some NPs are inherently instable under different environmental conditions; therefore, 
the preparation method involved needs special formulation at the nanoscale. In addition, actions are 
14Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 247
needed to prevent aggregation and increase stability. There are chances of toxicity because of the 
use of metallic NPs during environmental remediation, along with the creation of by-products and 
recovery costs form the site, and these factors may limit the use of NPs. This is why an intense 
understanding is needed of the material required for NP fabrication and performance optimiza￾tion to have excellent NPs that can address environmental issues. However, there are many options 
to remediate pollutants such as absorption, adsorption, chemical reactions, photocatalysis and 
filtration, as summarized in Figure 14.1.
14.2 NANOREMEDIATION: A NEW AND EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE 
ELIMINATION OF TOXIC WASTE PRODUCTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT
The word remediate means problem solving, and nanoremediation elucidates the use of different 
NPs/nanomaterials and plants in a technique called nanophytoremediation that controls environ￾mental contaminants (Khan 2020). Currently, nanoremediation is a favorable approach to contain 
pollution. Nanoremediation takes into consideration the applicability of NPs in the conversion and 
detoxification of environmental contaminants. The properties of nanomaterials that make them 
compatible for contaminant removal and that make pollutants less toxic are chemical reduction 
and catalysis. For nanoremediation in-situ, no groundwater is pumped for aboveground treatment, 
and no soil is transported to other locations for treatment and disposal (Otto et al. 2008). For the 
elimination of different contaminants from air, water and soil, various conventional methods are 
employed including absorption, adsorption, photocatalysis, chemical reactions and filtration [mol￾ecule]. However, nanoremediation has the prospective ability not only to decrease the overall result￾ing cost, time and lifting and disposal of contaminated soil offsite but also to bring the concentration

of contaminants down to an almost level zero (Karn et al. 2009). The novel properties and enhanced 
efficacy of nanomaterials make them compatible for remediation processes because of their high 
surface area-to-volume ratio that ultimately provides them with higher reactivity. Nanomaterials are 
actually anticipated for in-situ applications as they have novel properties, namely, a very minute size 
and groundbreaking surface coatings that enable them to infuse very small spaces and remain sus￾pended in groundwater. In addition, nano-sized particles travel farther than macro ones and attain 
a wider distribution (Tratnyek and Johnson 2006). It is very well-known that every new technology 
possesses both benefits and limitations. Similarly, nanoremediation has its own probable good and 
bad characteristics in effectively eradicating contaminated sites. In-situ applications of nanoreme￾diation compared to other remediation processes provide us with very important benefits such as 
being cost-effective and faster than other methods to clean up polluted sites (Yan et al. 2006).
However, at the same time, there are growing concerns about the use of nanomaterials to clean 
up contaminated environments. At the field scale, nanoremediation is almost untested. Questions 
have been raised regarding not only the real-world usefulness of nanoremediation for large-scale 
field sites contaminated with different sorts of pollutants but also the way that these NPs behave 
in dissimilar environments, which differ in the soil porosity, temperature, hydrogeology and pH. 
One benefit of NPs is that they generally move farther than macroparticles. It has been generally 
observed in practice, however, that NPs currently employed in the remediation process do not actu￾ally move far from the injection site (Karn et al. 2009). Similarly, other questions involve the con￾frontational effects on the environment in general, probability of persistence/bioaccumulation and 
changes in microbial populations (Mueller and Nowack 2010; Grieger et al. 2010). Various kinds of 
NPs and nanomaterials can be used for the techniques summarized in Figure 14.2.
14.3 TYPES OF NANOPARTICLES
14.3.1 Nanomaterials of an Inorganic Nature, Based on Metals and Their Oxides
Various NPs are employed for remediating a number of pollutants typically from water, which 
includes heavy metals and chlorinated pollution-causing agents. Among these nanomaterials, metal 
and metal oxides have shown promising results as they are highly proficient adsorbents and possess 
swift kinetics (Santhosh et al. 2016). Nanomaterials are being increasingly used for environmental 
remediation because they have potential application towards both in-situ and ex-situ aqueous sys￾tems (Das et al. 2015).
The antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal capabilities of silver (Ag) NPs are well established, 
and they are thus useful as water decontaminators (Chou et al. 2005; Bosetti et al. 2002). Ag NPs of 
fewer than 10 nm have been found to be highly toxic to E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ag 
NPs have also proved to be effective against viruses as they prevent their binding to host cells by 
favorably binding to virus glycoproteins. The size and shape of Ag NPs have a great influence on 
FIGURE 14.2 Types of nanoparticles.Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 249
the effect of antibacterial activity; particles of 11–23 nm have lower activity (Gogoi et al. 2006). In 
addition, triangular Ag nanomaterials have better antibacterial activity than rod- and sphere-shaped 
Ag NPs (Pal et al. 2007). Ag NPs, together with other metal oxides, have increased the efficiency 
of the resulting coupled NPs.
Titanium oxides are a metal-based nanomaterial that is frequently used for environmental reme￾diation. They have been exclusively prepared for the study of waste treatment, air purification and 
as photocatalysts in treating water because they have cost-effective, non-toxic, photocatalytic, semi￾conducting and energy-converting properties (Adesina 2004). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs are 
regularly used for their potential to remove organic pollutants and are activated by light. They also 
produce highly reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals that assist in sterilizing fungi, bacteria, 
viruses and algae (Cho et al. 2005; Li et al. 2014). TiO2 NPs alone have little photocatalytic poten￾tial; accordingly, they are doped with transition metals to enhance their performance. Investigations 
have been carried out with metal-doped TiO2 NPs. The sol-gel electrospinning technique utilized 
by Park and Lee (2014) assigned TiO2 nanofibers to be Ag-doped and were subsequently evaluated 
for their photocatalytic degradation of 2-chlorophenol underneath ultraviolet (UV) irradiation while 
the TiO2 nanofibers were maintained as the control. From the results obtained, there was a clear 
indication that Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers showed enhanced photodegradation over the control. This 
significant increase was credited to including a sufficient number of Ag on the surface, which aids 
in effectively capturing photoinduced electrons, shifting these captured electrons to the surface of 
nanofibers where adsorbed oxygen is present and stretching the response array to the visible region. 
Inorganic compounds of titanium oxide known as titanates have also been found to be effective in 
environmental nanoremediation. Chen et al. (2013) assessed the hydrothermal method that fabri￾cates acidic, basic and neutral titanate nanotubes and utilized these materials for the catalytic reduc￾tion of nitric oxide (NO) with ammonia. Titanate nanotubes were doped with manganese oxides to 
produce nanosheets, nanorods and nanotubes and were subsequently evaluated for the reduction of 
NO with ammonia; neutral (Mn/TNTs) titanates were found to possess better catalytic reduction 
potential than acidic and basic (Mn/TNTs) titanates, whereas basic (Mn/TNTs) titanates showed 
the least activity.
Likewise, bimetallic oxides have been explored for their nanoremediation properties. Rasalingam 
et al. (2014) utilized TiO2-silicon dioxide (SiO2) bimetallic nanomaterial for the photocatalytic deg￾radation of methylene blue dye from water, and the results showed efficient photoactivity. Bimetallic 
oxide nanomaterials have tremendous potential to remove many pollutants as can be seen from 
Table 14.1.
Moreover, the adsorbents of a nano metallic nature are especially eye-catching as they can be 
retained and detached easily from treated water. The literature has extensively described the use 
of iron and iron oxide NPs for the removal of different heavy metals, for example, Ni2+, Cu2+, 
Co2+ and Cd2+ (Hooshyar et al. 2013; Ebrahim et al. 2016; Poguberović et al. 2016), and for the 
remediation of chlorinated organic solvents (Guo et al. 2017; Han and Yan 2016). However, there 
are some problems when using NPs of this class in environmental remediation. One of the great￾est concerns is accumulation as this affects the reactivity of material and therefore diminishes the 
benefits of using nanoscale materials as a way to improve efficiency. In addition, working with NPs 
of metal and metal oxide causes possible toxicity. Furthermore, the cost of remediation technology 
is also one of the significant aspects to consider when choosing the NPs of this class as remediation 
material.
In examining the structure of iron NPs, they have a core comprising elemental iron (zerovalent 
iron) covered with a shell that has mixed valent oxides of iron, namely, Fe(II) and Fe(III). Figure 
14.3 demonstrates the way in which iron NPs help in environmental remediation. Zerovalent iron 
present inside the core donates electrons, which are actually used for the reduction of heavy metals 
and chlorinated compounds. Furthermore, this shell part of the iron NP aids in pollutant removal, 
such as heavy metals, and has a higher standard reducing potential (E0) than the Fe2+/Fe couple 
(Li and Zhang 2006).250 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
14.3.2 Nanoparticles Based on Silica
Silica materials have considerable importance due to their flexibility for various applications includ￾ing catalysis and adsorption. Furthermore, mesoporous silica nanomaterial has a number of ben￾efits from an environmental remediation point of view viz-a-viz a high surface area, facile surface 
modification, large pore volumes and a tunable pore size (Tsai et al. 2016). Extensive studies have 
conveyed that utilising silica materials for environmental remediation in the gas phase shows prom￾ising results. The modification of mesoporous silica material has been also performed as shown in 
many publications (Brigante et al. 2016). Table 14.1 summarizes some of the reported works found 
in the literature that investigate the use of silica nanomaterials for the environmental remediation of 
different contaminants. Silica material has the presence of a hydroxyl group on the surface, which 
is further important for modification, adsorption of gas and wetting one of the surface phenomenon. 
Designing new adsorbents and catalys
03).
ts involves the embedding of functional groups onto the pore 
walls (Huang et al. 20
The abstraction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) using an amine surface 
modified by silica xerogels from natural gas was attributed to the fact that there is a high disposal 
of amine groups on the surface of the silica materials, which subsequently resulted in increased 
efficiency towards the removal. It was found that 80% of the removal of CO2 was obtained in the 
first 30 minutes, revealing a high rate of adsorption and large capacity. A similar outcome was 
achieved for the removal of H2S as 80% adsorption took place in first 35 minutes (Huang et al. 
2003). Subsequent investigations have revealed the efficacy of amine-modified aluminosilicates 
for the removal of CO2 and other carbonyl compounds, along with ketones and aldehydes. CO2 cap￾ture was made possible through the reversible adsorption of gaseous molecules onto the aminosil￾ica material. Likewise, for the removal of aldehydes and ketones, imine or hemiaminal formation 
was required. For CO2, the remediation recyclability and capacity of these silica-based mesopo￾rous NPs were analyzed, and it was found that CO2 gets adsorbed reversibly and that the material 
relics were stable even after 50 cycles of continuous adsorption-desorption. Subsequently these 
silica-based materials can be considered a good alternative to conventional CO2 capture in that 
they are cost-effective, synthesis is easy and they possess enhanced performance and stability (Qi 
et al. 2011). Instead of subjecting post-treatment scaffold material to a functionalization technique, 
FIGURE 14.3 Degradation mechanism of chlorinated contaminants and heavy metals from aqueous sys￾tems using iron nanoparticles/nanomaterials.Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 251
the amine functional group is integrated due to the polymerization of aziridine. However, one issue 
arises when incorporation is performed that actually confines the use of the material to pollutants 
especially reacting with amines. Moreover, this monomer of aziridine is difficult to care for with￾out dedicated equipment.
Amine functionalized porous silica nanomaterial was used by Drese et al. (2011) for aldehyde 
reduction, such as formaldehyde, which is a low molecular weight compound. The results obtained 
showed 1.4 mmol·g−1 and 10.8 mmol·g−1 of formaldehyde retention on silica material that has 
primary and secondary amines, respectively, and an insignificant quantity for the tertiary amines. 
The results deducted from this experiment convey that primary and secondary amines are suitable 
for aldehyde remediation, which agrees with the covalent capture of the target contaminant by the 
creation of imine and hemiaminal intermediates. Remediation of some higher molecular weight and 
fewer volatility aldehydes was also carried out by Bollini et al. (2011). Unfortunately, the required 
time to achieve comparable performance for the target pollutants was more than 10 hours, which is 
more than enough when compared with the adsorption of formaldehyde (Nomura and Jones 2014). 
This lengthy reaction time has restrained the use of these materials in an industrial environment, 
which requires the swift remediation of pollutants.
The removal of dyes organic in nature from wastewater by utilising silica-based nanomaterial 
has also been reported. Tsai et al. (2016) investigated the functionalization of mesoporous silica 
with –COOH groups because carboxylic acid can form hydrogen bonds with different types of com￾pounds, such as metal ions, dyes and pollutants. The group was able to successfully functionalize 
mesoporous silica SBA-16 with the tunable loadings of carboxylic acid groups. The study revealed 
that the interaction between the functional groups of carboxylic acid and the target pollutant for 
adsorption depends on a particular pH value, which was found to be reliable with the proposed 
hydrogen bonding capture model. For methylene blue at a pH of 9, maximum uptake was attained. 
In basic conditions, these materials may be effective for adsorption, but this has, in turn, led to the 
creation of limitations on the practical aspects of these materials. In addition, different metals ions 
have been removed including Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Al2+, Cr3+, Pb2+, Hg2+ and U6+ 
(Wang et al. 2015; Hernández et al. 2012; Nakanishi et al. 2015; Repo et al. 2013; Arencibia et al. 
2010; Rostamain et al. 2011). Figure 14.4 explains mesoporous silica nanomaterial and its charac￾teristic surface properties that are particularly important for adsorption.
FIGURE 14.4 Mesoporous silica materials used for remediating the environment.252 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
14.3.3 Carbon-Based Nanomaterials
Compared to nanomaterials based on metal, elemental carbon has exceptional physical, chemical 
and electronic properties due to its mutable hybridization state (Ren et al. 2011). This hybrid￾ization state has yielded many structural conformations such as fullerene C60, fullerene C540, 
single-walled nanotubes, multi-walled nanotubes and graphene (Mauter and Elimelech 2008). 
Considerable research has been carried out to determine the appropriateness of carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs) and graphene for remediation; the requirements of treating the surface and activating the 
carbon material are first involved. The adsorption properties of multi-walled and single-walled 
carbon tubes make them predominantly helpful for the degradation of organic and inorganic con￾taminants in the air and in aqueous systems (Ren et al. 2011; Theron et al. 2008; Di Paola et al. 
2012; Kharisov et al. 2014). NPs based on carbon are used for environmental remediation through 
photocatalytic methods. Figure 14.5 demonstrates the photocatalytic approach for the remedia￾tion of environmental contaminants. Due to UV, photons get excited when they have energy more 
than or equivalent to the band gap of the nanotubes, promoting the creation of valence band holes 
(h+) and conduction band electrons (e−). These holes play an important role in the formation of 
radicals of hydroxyl, which ultimately lead to the oxidation of chlorinated organic compounds. 
Heavy metal contaminants are reduced by the electrons from superoxide radicals. Moreover, there 
is already published work that has indicated the use of graphene to fabricate photocatalytic nano￾composites (Liu et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2013a). Graphene in association with TiO2 NPs has shown 
enhanced photocatalytic activity when matched to simple TiO2 NPs because of a surge in conduc￾tivity (Zhang et al. 2010a).
14.3.4 Graphene Materials
Two forms of graphene such as modified and pristine have already been explored for environ￾mental remediation uses. Pristine graphene was utilized in aqueous solution to adsorb fluoride, 
and the adsorption potential of fluoride by graphene was 35.59 mg/g at pH 7 and 298 K. Due to 
its increased efficiency and adsorption capacity, gra
be direc
phene is very effective in adsorbing fluoride 
from aqueous systems. Pristine graphene can tly employed for environmental remediation; 
however, different environmental remediation techniques depend upon the exercise of modifying 
graphene to remediate different pollutants (Wang et al. 2013). An effective surface area can be 
FIGURE 14.5 Mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation for metal and organic contaminants.Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 253
enhanced by preventing the accretion of graphene layers, thus creating modified graphene, which 
is more promising than pristine graphene (An and Jimmy 2011). One good example of modified 
graphene is graphene oxide that has been used for the environmental remediation of different pol￾lutants, for example, sulphur oxide (SOx), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), volatile organic 
compounds, heavy metals, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. In addition, graphene oxide (GO) has 
been reported to present high adsorption capacity for cationic metals. Nonetheless, the removal of 
anionic metals requires the modification of GO with organic or metal oxides (Wang et al. 2013).
14.3.5 Polymer-Based Nanomaterials/Nanoparticles
Because of their greater surface area-to-volume ratio, NPs possess enhanced performance and 
higher reactivity. However, some reasons can limit the use of these nanotechnologies due to a lack 
of functionality such as aggregation, lower stability and non-specificity. To increase the stabil￾ity of nanoscale material, the best substitute is to use host material that will serve as a support or 
matrix for other NPs (Züttel et al. 2002). Polymers mostly find their use in detection and chemical 
contamination removal including iron, arsenic, manganese (Mn), nitrate, and heavy metals, dif￾ferent gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and NOx and pollutants that 
are organic in nature, for example, aromatic/aliphatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals and a wide 
range of biological agents involving bacteria, parasites and viruses. To overcome the shortcomings 
of pristine NPs and to provide them with required characters, polymeric hosts include surfactants, 
emulsifiers, stabilizing agents and surface functionalized ligands.
Aromatic hydrocarbons have been degraded from the soil by amphiphilic polyurethane 
NPs, thereby validating the claim that organic NPs can be planned with anticipated properties 
(Tungittiplakorn et al. 2004). NPs’ flexibility in the soil can be enhanced by making a hydro￾philic surface, and a hydrophobic interior promotes an affinity towards organic contaminants. 
Phenanthrene pollutants have been removed from aquifer sand with almost an 80% recovery rate 
by polyurethane NPs. Amphiphilic polyurethane (APU) NPs’ removal potential for phenanthrene 
improved by an increase in the size of the hydrophobic backbone. In addition, it was observed that 
by having more ionic groups on the hydrophobic backbone, the aggregation of particles was pre￾vented because of polyvalent cations (Tungittiplakorn et al. 2004). For environmental remediation, 
these NPs could be helpful; however, no description on their biodegradability has given rise to seri￾ous questions about their fate after application.
Since many investigations have been conducted regarding the potential of NPs/nanomaterials, 
Table 14.1 provides a glimpse of the type of NPs and the applications achieved. 
14.4 NANOREMEDIATION CHALLENGES INVOLVED
The increased reactivity due to a decrease in the particle size may affect a substance and make it 
harmful. Hence, the basic property that makes nanomaterials widely applicable also makes them 
a potential toxic substance. Accordingly, a complete understanding about the transport and mobil￾ity of nanomaterial use should be evolved, and their potential risks and toxicity should be keenly 
understood. The following sections will aid comprehension of the hardships faced by researchers 
during nanoremediation.
14.5 ECONOMICS OF NANOREMEDIATION
Nanotechnology has a cross-disciplinary nature, and its valuation for economic impact is rather 
complex because this technology is still in its early stages of development, innovation and growth. 
In addition, it is far more difficult to estimate its economic influences on the separation sciences as 
there are no indicators for this field. Nevertheless, nanotechnology will certainly leave its impact 
on specific disciplines in the near future. Additionally, once nanomaterial use has achieved its full 254 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution

potential, wide-ranging economic and societal advances will be attained. Once nanotechnological 
expansion occurs, this will create a way for policymakers and stakeholders to design and assess 
more confidently the economic forecasts and benefits of nanoremediation (Vijaya et al. 2018). It is 
hoped that the investments being made in nanotechnologies will prove to be worthwhile and not an 
economic burden in the future.
14.6 HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS
The nanosize of the material has raised number of objections regarding its potential toxicity to 
the environment and exposure to mammals, because NPs will be absorbed in cell membranes 
as they can easily pass through the skin. Different characters of nanomaterial determine the rate 
of adsorption in cells such as their size, aggregation and sedimentation (Binderup et al. 2013). 
The possible avenues for NP exposure include oral, skin, nutrient supplements, skin care products 
and food coloring (Ma et al. 2015). Some studies have mentioned that during the early phases of 
life, nanomaterials act as allergens and may prompt an immune response at later stages of life, 
causing allergic inflammation (Sly and Schüepp 2011). Iron oxide NPs, which occur naturally, 
bind to different metals such as copper; because they can travel long distances downstream from 
mining sites, this indicates that nanomaterials’ toxicity depends upon their transport (Hochella 
et al. 2005). There are observations about colloidal NPs’ ability to move sorbed pollutants and 
transport them long distances, which affects the ecosystem. Hence, it is very easy to deduce that 
although nanomaterial may not be harmful to the environment, they can transport pollutants 
with them. Many researchers have found that aqueous systems contain mineral NPs. According 
to Villalobos et al. (2003), numerous processes of a natural and biological origin might create 
mineral NPs of metal oxides and sulphides. Nanomaterials could affect aquatic organisms as 
revealed by some toxicological studies (Gao et al. 2018). The results of nanomaterial exposure 
to neonates during the early phases of life have been thoroughly explored. Meldrum et al. (2017) 
assessed that nanomaterial exposure can cause different ailments, for example, asthma, dimin￾ished lung function and cough, without affecting neonates. Furthermore, different epidemiologi￾cal investigations have revealed that nanomaterial exposure may affect the cardiovascular system, Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 257
for example, an altered coagulation of blood, which may ultimately result in changes in cardiac 
functions (Araujo and Nel 2009; Quan et al. 2010; Liou et al. 2012). Particular NPs have a variety 
of applications, but numerous unknown NPs are added to the environment unintentionally, which 
may have serious negative results on human health. The disposal of plastics in a non-scientific 
way has enhanced the amount of plastic in the environment at an alarming rate, particularly in 
aquatic systems (Bouwmeester et al. 2015; Prata 2018). Because of the presence of nanoplastics in 
the ecosystem, these materials can far more easily enter the food chain. Moreover, from the food 
chain, these materials may find their way to human systems and ultimately affect human health 
through circulation.
14.7 FUTURE OF NANOREMEDIATION
The speed with which innovations and unique development take place in science and technology 
has extended the range of nanotechnology and its implications across multidisciplinary areas. 
Nanotechnological exploration has generated many practical applications in terms of economics, 
and in recent times, the economic relevance side has intensified, thereby extensively increasing nan￾otechnological research. Because of widespread application and the potential of nanotechnology, 
especially in environmental remediation, the fabrication of sensors and green synthesis is currently 
attaining impetus. Nanomaterials have a high efficiency that has actually led to the formulation of a 
broader range of products. Nanoscale material produced through synthetic and biological methods 
has paved the way for toxic metal remediation, an area of significance. By utilising pulsed laser 
deposition technology, microscopic structures have been coated with nanometre-thick particulates. 
The scope of commercial applications has extended by blending microelectronics with molecular 
biology. Altering the optical characteristics of NPs and enhancing the magnitude of their applica￾tions in several aspects of nanotechnology need to be followed up for proficient pollutant remedia￾tion. By putting nanotechnology to appropriate uses, a constant inter-relationship between energy 
and the environment can be established. The progress made in nanotechnology broadens its role 
in the protection of the environment and remediation. Nanoscale material demand from a global 
perspective has been continuously increasing. Despite their advantages, the environmental impact 
in terms of their toxicity, transportation, bioavailability and bioaccumulation has yet to be fully 
interpreted. Eliminating waste at the source through the aid of nanotechnology via environmentally 
friendly manufacturing aspects holds sufficient potential. Therefore, a complete analysis about the 
negative effects of nanomaterials on the environment and their production is to be given priority for 
the potential service of nanoscale material in the monitoring and judicious supervision of contami￾nants through remediation.
14.8 CONCLUSION
Continuous and swift efforts that are required to create sustainable methods for the management of 
toxic contaminants have led us to transform ideas into experimental designs and manufacture useful 
products with due convenience and cost-efficiency. Environmental remediation by nanotechnology 
is one tool under exploration globally. By remediating contaminants with a target-based approach, 
the potential of nanomaterials has enhanced their role in different fields, such as sensor fabrication, 
catalysis, remediation and green synthesis. Their extraordinary adsorption and reactive capacity 
prompted the utilization of nanomaterials in the early stages of green processing. A vision regarding 
the commercial aspect has been achieved by combining molecular biology with microelectronics. 
Concerns about discarding harmful metals can be managed with the production of synthetic nano￾materials, thereby enhancing the demand for these nanomaterials while raising issues about the 
negative effects on the environment and human health in the future. Hence, before fully considering 
nanotechnology and broadening its practicable possibilities, its toxicological effects on the environ￾ment in the long term need to be elucidated.258 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
14.9 NANOPHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation takes into consideration the expenditure of plants to remove, reduce and degrade 
contaminants in different environmental media such as water, air, sediments and soil. One of the 
greatest concerns currently faced by the world is pollution that can be remediated with phytore￾mediation (Asante-Badu et al. 2020). Some of the compounds that can be remediated by utilizing 
phytoremediation include wastes of an organic origin, metals, metalloids, inorganic substances, 
petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents (Misra and Misra 2019). The level of these con￾taminants is on the rise because of enhanced anthropogenic activities, for example, pesticide and 
herbicide use in agriculture, petrochemical usage in industry, spillage of fuel and solvents, pro￾cessing of wood and defense activities such as chemical weapons and explosives (Tripathi et al. 
2020). One important feature of phytoremediation is cost-effectiveness, which implicates plants 
in metabolizing contaminants in their tissues and thereby reducing these contaminants. The 
accumulation of contaminants from different environmental media is a natural ability of plants. 
Nanophytoremediation encompasses nanotechnology and phytoremediation together for environ￾mental remediation. Nanotechnology enhances the effectiveness of phytoremediation (Song et al. 
2019). The nanophytoremediation of pollutants is affected by different factors including the physi￾cal and chemical aspects of pollutant such as their solubility in water, molecular weight, bond 
type, hydrophobicity, toxicity, mobility and reactivity. Moreover, the characteristic features of the 
environment that affect chemical uptake include the temperature, the amount of moisture in the 
soil, pH, light, microorganisms, humidity and oxygen. In addition, different plant features influence 
chemical absorption viz-a-viz the root system involved, the type of plant, the potential to accumu￾late contaminants and a high biomass. The chemical configuration, size and type are prime features 
upon which the intake of NPs into the plant rely. The mobility and translocation of NPs from the 
roots inside the plant primarily depends upon the size of the nanomaterial. To determine how pro￾ficiently plants take in nanomaterials, the penetration process is one factor (Schwab et al. 2016). 
Inside plants roots, NPs move via apoplastic and symplastic transport (Sattelmacher 2001; Roberts 
2003). Environmental situations serve an important function in this uptake (Burken and Schnoor 
1996). Growth ingredients are affected by temperature and subsequently, the length of roots. The 
root structure varies both in natural conditions and in greenhouses. The accomplishments of phy￾toremediation, explicitly, phytoextraction, rest upon contaminant-specific hyperaccumulator plants. 
The NPs utilized in phytoremediation should possess some of the ideal characteristics, specifically, 
non-toxicity towards plants, potential binding with the pollutant, a significant increase in the plant 
growth regulators within the plant and enhanced germination and biomass production.
Nanophytoremediation generally utilizes two types of NPs/nanomaterials, namely, ones that 
occur naturally and others that are plant-assisted and genetically modified for cleaning polluted 
environments. Some selected NPs have expressively increased plant growth, and nanoaugmentation￾enhanced phytoremediation has resulted in considerable increments in pollutant removal from the 
soil environment. Some NPs have also been recognized as promoting plant growth due to their 
potential to increase the growth hormones in plants and encourage the healthier intake of pollutants. 
In addition to the advantages already known of nanomaterials for soil remediation and other media of 
the environment, testing their potential in the field and accessing the toxicity of nanocarbon to plants 
and microbes in soil is an important aspect (Sajid et al. 2015).
The effectiveness of nanomaterials in the soil is influenced by the type of contaminant, amount 
present, size, charge, organic content and other physical/chemical properties of soil. Various tech￾niques are involved in using NPs in the soil remediation process such as injection under pressure, 
recirculation, pressure pulse technology and hydraulics. The type of plant species that is used in 
the nanophytoremediation method for soil remediation is particularly grounded in the application 
of NPs and method of phytoremediation (e.g., phytostabilization, phytoextraction and phytodeg￾radation). It is obvious that nanophytoremediation has impending potential for remediating and 
neutralizing pollutants of an organic nature in sediments. Contaminant removal takes less time than Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 259
normal, which is accelerated by the plant species. Significant pollutant removal results have been 
obtained from contaminated soil (Ma et al. 2010; Pillai and Kottekottil 2016; Souri et al. 2017). 
Table 14.2 offers a small glimpse of various plant species and different NPs utilized to remove 
contaminants.
14.9.1 Phytodegradation
In phytodegration, organic contaminants are taken up by plants for the purpose of decomposition 
(metabolized) or mineralization that is attained by the aid of different enzymes present inside plant 
cells. Some examples include nitro-aromatic compound decomposition by nitroreductase, pesticide 
decomposition by enzyme dehalogenase and aniline decomposition by volatile enzymes (Kumar 
et al. 2018). The tissues of Armoracia rusticana have been found to possess the potential to degrade 
benzophenone (Chen et al. 2016). The label biosphere green liver has been given to these plants. 
In addition to organic compounds, phytodegradation can remove or reduce insecticides, different 
herbicides, nutrients of an inorganic nature and chlorinated solvents (Kumar et al. 2019).
14.9.2 Phytostabilization (Phytoimmobilization)
To diminish the amount of pollutants from agricultural and natural environments, phytostabiliza￾tion is of paramount importance; this is an in-situ technique in which toxic contaminants are inte￾grated with the lignin root cell wall to make them less toxic (Khalid et al. 2017). Under the influence 
of exudates from roots, metal contaminants are precipitated and consequently move into the soil 
medium. One of the major pitfalls involved in this in-situ method is that the concentration of pollut￾ants and their overpowering dispersion in soil cannot be avoided (Fan et al. 2017). It has been found 
by Lebrun et al. (2018) that the phytoimmobilization of polluted soil can be attained by shielding 
it with the type of vegetation that is resistant to toxic elements; this constrains soil erosion and the 
discharge of contaminants into groundwater. These substances immobilize pollutants by inhibiting 
their uptake and reducing their mobility in soil. The renovation of vegetation and remediation of 
contaminated areas of agricultural production can be achieved by these plants that have stabilizing 
potential (Eskander and Saleh 2017; Saha et al. 2017). Soil contaminated with inorganic pollutants 
such as arsenic (As), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) can be 
remediated through phytostabilization (Yadav et al. 2018).
FIGURE 14.6 Desired properties of nanoparticles for nanophytoremediation.260 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
14.9.3 Phytovolatilization
Some plants actually have the potential to engulf/absorb contaminants of metal, metalloids and 
organic and heavy metals and afterward, to release them through vaporization. Mercury (Hg), As 
and selenium (Se) are absorbed by the roots, converted into non-toxic forms and finally volatilized 
(Limmer and Burken 2016). Plants that have phytovolatilization potential as verified by different 
studies include Stanleya pinnata, Astragalus bisulcatus, and transgenic plants (with bacterial genes) 
such as Liriodendron tulipifera, Brassica napus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Nicotiana tabacum (Ali 
et al. 2013; Mani and Kumar 2014). One of the drawbacks of this method is that harmful compounds 
released into the atmosphere may undergo precipitation and re-deposit back into the environment, 
which will give rise to other toxic substances (Nikolić and Stevović 2015).
14.9.4 Phytoextraction (Phytoaccumulation)
Contaminant absorption via roots succeeds through the translocation and accumulation in air 
particles. Insights provided by Parmar and Singh (2015) about phytoextraction encompass the 
removal by plants of pollutants from different environmental media such as the soil, groundwa￾ter and surface water. Phytoextraction is primarily associated with contaminated soil remedia￾tion from various metals, for example, Cd, nickel (Ni), Cu, Zn, and Pb, in addition to organic 
compounds. Hyperaccumulator plant species are favored for this method, and these plants have 
great tendency to absorb metals in certain portions (0.01–1% dry weight) (Parmar and Singh 2015). 
Hyperaccumulators rely on the use of sorption and cationic pumps to remove different contaminants 
including organic compounds, salts and metals by engrossing the water available to plants (Xiao 
et al. 2017). This process starts by planting metal-accumulating plants in polluted soils, which is 
integrated with vast agricultural practices. Elsholtzia splendens, Alyssum bertolonii, Thlaspi caer￾ulescens and Pteris vittata are known examples of hyperaccumulating plants for Cu, Ni, Zn/Cd, and 
As, respectively (van der Ent et al. 2013; Xiao et al. 2017; Reeves et al. 2018).
14.9.5 Rhizodegradation/Phytostimulation
Due to the microbial activity of the rhizosphere (roots), organic compounds in the soil are bro￾ken down (Echereme et al. 2018). Roots associated with particular fungi and bacteria enhance the 
biodegradation of pollutants (Khalid et al. 2017). Some symbiotic free-living mycorrhizal fungi 
FIGURE 14.7 Methods of phytoremediation involved and their role.Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 261
associated with plant roots are considerably more significant for the production and biochemi￾cal accessibility of nutrients including nitrogen, cobalt, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, and cal￾cium. Sarwar et al. (2017) found that certain bacterial species such as pseudomonas, bacillus and 
Actinobacter have enriched their adaptability to the environment and are resistant to Pb, Cd and 
Cu in the rhizosphere soil around the plant. Moreover, these plants have the inherent potential to 
release some of the biodegradable enzymes. Due to the changing nutrient conditions around the 
rhizosphere, microbial association is therefore heterogeneous in nature, but the species belonging 
to the genus Pseudomonas are predominantly associated with roots (Singh and Singh 2016). The 
death of plants should be considered, and agronomic methods must be used to reduce plant death by 
timely planting in the growing period, digging an adequate hole, and feasibly filling it with unpol￾luted plant soil to better ensure the survival of plants and a greater efficiency of phytoremediation.
14.9.6 Phytofiltration
Phytofiltration relies upon the absorption of precipitate pollutants, particularly radioactive elements 
and heavy metals, to remediate the environment through the plant root structure or submerged 
organs. In this method, plants kept in a hydroponic system perform rhizofiltration once wastewater 
passes through them or the pollutants remain in the plant structures that have the potential to absorb 
contaminants (Parmar and Singh 2015). Different metallic compounds can be remediated with phy￾tofiltration such as Cu, Ni, vanadium, Cr, Pb and other radionuclides, namely, caesium, strontium 
and uranium. An investigation conducted by Cule et al. (2016) found that in the Canabis indica
remediation for Pb in wastewater removal, efficiency was enhanced by 81%.
14.10 NANOMATERIAL-FACILITATED PHYTOREMEDIATION 
FOR THE REMOVAL OF HEAVY METALS
14.10.1 Lead (Pb)
Soil polluted with heavy metals is one of the most critical issues around the globe because it poses 
a serious threat to human health and food safety. Contaminated soil can be remediated from heavy 
metals with in-situ phytoremediation (Liang et al. 2017). The phytoremediation of contaminated 
soil can be increased by the application of NPs (Khan and Bano 2016). The two most commonly 
studied heavy metal pollutants are Pb and Cd as these are the most common at polluted sites. 
Generally for Pb removal from the soil, phytoextraction is considered (Ali et al. 2013). Because of 
its swift growth rate and high potential to tolerate Pb, cost-effective Lolium perenne is employed for 
phytoextraction. In addition, NPs have been found to be effective in promoting Pb phytoextraction 
by Lolium perenne. In another study conducted by Liang et al. (2017), the application of nanoma￾terials such as nano-hydroxyapatite in the Pb phytoextraction by Lolium perenne was determined, 
and it was found that efficiency increased from 16% to 31%. Huang et al. (2018) assessed different 
concentrations of nZVI particles on the phytoextraction of Pb by Lolium perenne. Concentrations 
of 100mg/kg nZVI caused the maximum amount of Pb to be phytoextracted.
14.10.2 Cadmium (Cd)
As a result of industrial processes, mining, electroplating and phosphate fertilizers, harmful met￾als such as Cd are added to the soil (Godt et al. 2006; Mahabadi et al. 2007). One of the primary 
phytoremediation methods is to use hyperaccumulators to extract Cd, but these plant species 
are confined in their number and capacity (Kirkham 2006). NPs have been found to enhance 
the phytoextraction of Cd from soil. In soyabean plants, utilising Tio2 NPs on Cd accumulation 
showed a positive response (Singh and Lee 2016). The authors added TiO2 NPs of 100, 200 and 
300mg/kg to the soil and analyzed the accumulation and distribution of Cd in plants on the 60th 262 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
day after sowing; with the assistance of TiO2 NPs, the Cd accumulation in the shoots increased 
by approximately 1.9, 2.1 and 2.6 times, while the Cd accumulation in the roots increased by 2.5, 
2.6 and 3.3 times, respectively. The maximum accumulation of Cd reached 1,534.7 mg/g with 
TiO2 NPs of 300 mg/kg.
14.10.3 Arsenic (As)
As is highly harmful and has carcinogenic properties; it is added to the environment via the 
use of As-possessing pesticides, herbicides, phosphate fertilizers, wood preservatives and some 
operations related to industry (Singh et al. 2015). The phytoremediation techniques that have 
been found to be more fruitful for As reduction in soil are phytoextraction and phytostabilization. 
Three individual systems are used by plants to absorb As, namely, active uptake by the symplast, 
passive uptake by the apoplast and direct transcellular transport from the environment to the plant 
vascular system (Vithanage et al. 2012). Salicyclic acid NPs are effective in As phytoextraction 
(Souri et al. 2017).
The interaction between NPs and plants lead to various morphological and physiological 
changes; for example, the application of Ag NPs to Zea mays L. enhanced the amount of ABA and 
gibberellin, which aid the plant in enduring stress and enhance the nutrient uptake for enriched 
growth (Khan and Bano 2016). Similarly, in Vicia faba L., germination increased due to graphene 
oxide (Anjum et al. 2014), and the response of plants to NPs depends on the type, dose and the 
plant species involved (Dimkpa et al. 2012). Chemical/physical qualities including the size, shape, 
surface area, reactivity and amount of NPs determine their effectiveness, which considerably varies 
among plants (Ma et al. 2010; Khodakovskaya et al. 2012). Salicylic acid NPs are also considered 
to increase phytoremediation and plant growth under the influence of As stress (Souri et al. 2017). 
Pradhan et al. (2013) and Pradhan et al. (2014) assessed that Mn NP application increased not only 
the root and shoot length but also nitrogen uptake. Nano-fertilizers aid in the regulation of and 
release of nutrients into the soil system (Subramanian et al. 2015), which enhances the germination 
of seeds, the chlorophyll amount and soil fertility (Varma and Khanuja 2017) and promotes enzyme 
activity in plants (Yang et al. 2017).
A primary concern that must be prioritized while utilizing NPs for nanophytoremediation is that 
it must be ensured that they are not toxic to plants and to plants’ rhizospheric micro-biota. Micro￾biota has the potential to bind pollutants and afterwards, to make them bioavailable to complete the 
phytoextraction process (Khan 2020). The biological synthesis of engineered NPs is rapid by the 
plants and microbes whose roots grow at polluted sites (Singh et al. 2009). However, these engi￾neered NPs need to be evaluated for their toxic effects on the environment and human health, and 
subsequently, this knowledge will be helpful in designing and employing NPs (Ma and Wang 2018). 
Due to inconsistencies found in the literature regarding nanotechnology, addressing NP toxicity is 
the need of the hour to understand their genotoxic potential (Singh et al. 2009). The biological syn￾thesis of NP purification can be accomplished through their filtration with antioxidants to reduce 
heavy metals to their respective NPs such as Ag, gold and platinum (Yadav et al. 2017). 
14.11 NANOREMEDIATION ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABILITY
The sustainability aspect of nanoremediation and nanophytoremediation can be broadly viewed 
as an all-inclusive approach where benefits from remediation in different spheres, for example, 
the environment, economic and social spheres, are maximized for all shareholders for current and 
future generations. Alternatives for every viable remediation are estimated with evidence based on 
sustainability valuations of the impacts on these spheres. The selected remedial material should 
have greater sustainability advantages and surpass the detrimental effects on a life-cycle basis. To 
decrease secondary emissions, energy requirements, the use of resources and ecological impacts, 
reliable and up-to-date management practices should be utilized. According to the United States Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 263

Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), green remediation employs various approaches to have 
minimalistic detrimental effects on the environment while eradicating pollutants from their source, 
reducing waste generation and integrating options that will ultimately enhance the overall benefits 
of environmental remediation actions (USEPA 2008).
Sustainable remediation takes into consideration the ideal outcome for both present and future 
generations. Since the environment has a dynamic nature, it must be remembered that sustainable 
remediation methods should be robust to endure changes in the environment such as the deple￾tion of groundwater, a rise in sea levels and enhanced levels of precipitation. Sustainable remedia￾tion should possess certain features to consider these changes including the potential to cope with 
evolving human health and standards in the environment, a resilience to the dynamic geophysical 
conditions (climate change) and flexibility in various choices for future site development (Hou and 
Al-Tabbaa 2014). According to complexity theories, the sustainability of coupled human nature 
systems requires both change and persistence (Holling 2001). From a remediation perspective, per￾sistence can be summarized as the effectiveness of the remediation platform and an assurance to 
clean up contaminants. Remediation change involves adaptability, the acceptance of novel ideas 
from remediation practitioners and the tractability of the remediation system to integrate new tech￾nologies. Activities encouraged and supported by nature fall under nature-based solutions (van den 
Bosch and Sang 2017). Implementation of nature-based solutions to remediate contaminated sites 
provides us with different environmental, economic and social welfares (Song et al. 2019) such as 
energy and enhanced material efficiency for promoting resilience to combat environmental change 
globally (Chi et al. 2017; Liang and Wang 2017). Different substitutes that have been actually uti￾lized in polluted sites are re-vegetating, urban planning, developing green industrial heritage parks 
and creating nature reserves.
There are basically four primary objectives for sustainable development, specifically, prog￾ress at a social level, which takes care of everyone’s needs, environmental protection, a judicious 
use of natural resources and the maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and 
employment.
14.12 PROCESSES OF SUSTAINABLE REMEDIATION
Sustainable remediation assesses the alternatives not only for remediation but also decision making. 
A pivotal feature is the employment of green and clean processes in environmental remediation. 
The overall sustainability has a strong interconnection with the alternative of either ex-situ or in-situ 
remediation. It has been found that remediating groundwater with the in-situ method that utilizes 
permeable reactive barriers has very low life cycle impingement compared to the ex-situ method 
with a pump and treat system (Higgins and Olson 2009). Likewise, Lemming et al. (2010) inves￾tigated in-situ bio-remediation and in-situ thermal desorption and found that they have minimal 
life cycle impacts compared to transporting the contaminated medium for off-site treatment and 
disposal. Several studies have been conducted based on a life cycle assessment, and the results indi￾cated that in-situ remediation is more sustainable than ex-situ handling (Blanc et al. 2004: Harbottle 
et al. 2008). Quantitatively assessing remediation methods and ground-breaking, pioneering tech￾nology for remediation is currently needed to lower the primary, secondary and tertiary environ￾mental impacts and maximize the sustainability benefits.
14.12.1 Phytoremediation
Generally, the term phytoremediation indicates the use of plants to eliminate or diminish contami￾nant levels. It involves various processes such as phytodegradation, phytovolatilization, phytoex￾traction, phytostabilization and rhizofiltration.Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 265
14.12.2 In-Situ Bioremediation
In-situ bioremediation involves treating polluted soil and groundwater biologically while nei￾ther unearthing the soil nor driving water for treatment above the soil. Basically, in-situ bio￾remediation relies upon the use of microbes in plants to degrade or restrain pollutants in situ. 
Furthermore, this technology provides the option of equilibrium between cost and effectiveness 
while upholding site availability. If there is a lack in characterising the site and a poor design for 
application, there may be some problems. In-situ bioremediation can be employed in geochemi￾cal circumstances that have an anoxic feature and that rely on pollutants and their mechanism for 
degradation. For chlorinated solvents, anaerobic in-situ bioremediation is a better choice, with a 
nominal disruption of the ground surface. However, this technique may sometimes have serious 
costs (Griffiths 2019), such as effects on groundwater quality including color, smell, turbidity and 
a changed pH.
Organic contaminants such as coal tar and crude oil from soil can be remediated using a novel 
technology viz, active remediation for self-sustaining treatment; in this technology, air is used for 
smoldering, which is basically flameless low-temperature combustion. Through contaminated soil, 
this self-sustaining reaction moves from the ignition point while destroying pollutants along the way 
(Gerhard et al. 2019). It involves both in-situ and ex-situ methods. Some studies have described that 
this novel technique rendered an order-of-magnitude lower environmental footprint compared with 
thermal desorption and dig-and-haul technologies.
14.12.3 In-Situ Solidification/Stabilization
Stabilization/solidification is a remediation technique that has various advantages such as rapid 
implementation, swift site development and diminished disposal off-site and utilizes advanced 
equipment and novel techniques that, in turn, result in reduced risk for workers. Stabilization/
solidification remediation treatment bounds the load of the pollutants released from solid harm￾ful wastes. As the name suggests, solidification includes the encapsulation of particular solids, 
and stabilization hints at constraining pollutants’ mobility and converting them to a less-toxic 
form. The reaction for stabilization involves adsorption, precipitation, isomorphous substitu￾tion and lattice incorporation. However, one of the greatest concerns related to this technique is 
contaminant retention in the ground. The effectiveness of solidification/stabilization has been 
considered doubtful in the long run as there are various environmental stresses that damage 
solidification/stabilization materials. On-site solidification/stabilization under natural conditions 
has been observed to be effective (Jin 2019). Durability and long-term effectiveness are elements 
in the assessment of the sustainability of contaminated land remediation techniques. However, 
other aspects of sustainability, for example, energy use and the use of natural resources, are soon 
likely to become as much of a concern as durability with the increased pressures to address the 
technical, environmental and social elements of sustainability on contaminated land remediation 
projects (Harbottle et al. 2005).
14.12.4 Remedial Process Optimization
To assess the performance and efficacy of site remediation and recognize the different strategies 
for cost effectiveness, one systemic approach is remedial process optimization. This applies the 
principles of value engineering to the implementation components of remediation (Leu and Hou 
2019). From a sustainability point of view, it is recommended that the remediation industry consider 
all environmental, economic and social benefits. In general, remedial process optimization is an 
operational way to diminish the life cycle environmental footprints of remedial processes, thereby 
making them greener and more sustainable266 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
14.13 CRITERIA FOR SUSTAINABILITY REMEDIATION 
(M.J. HARBOTTLE & A. AL-TABBAA)
14.13.1 First Criterion
The benefits of remediation to future and current generations must outweigh the costs. A quantifi￾cation of cost and benefits (non-financial) can be performed by including terms such as the quality 
of the water, groundwater, air and soil, the overall risks to site users and the general public, non￾recyclable contaminants and future land use. In addition, financial considerations include the effect 
on surrounding areas, costs such as capital, operation and maintenance, labor, site investigation, 
monitoring/post-closure maintenance and off-site contaminant disposal.
14.13.2 Second Criterion
While employing remediation processes, the effect on the environment should be less than the 
impact of untreated land. Different factors can be used to measure and compare the impact of both 
remediation on the environment and no action taken on contaminated land such as the imminent 
risks to human health, effects on water flow, air pollution, the pollutants’ fate, impacts on flora and 
fauna, constraints on the future use of land and influences on the landscape/other sites.
14.13.3 Third Criterion
The environmental impact of the remediation process is minimal and measurable. This requires 
the environmental impact from the remediation process itself to be minimal. This includes emis￾sions into the air, energy use, the use of secondary materials, waste, the direct use of natural 
resources and the impact of the materials used in the remediation process. All impacts must be 
measurable.
14.13.4 Fourth Criterion
The timescale over which the environmental effects arise and, thus, the intergenerational risk are 
part of the decision-making mechanism. Parameters include long-term surveillance, post-closure 
maintenance, durability, future underground operations, land use problems, long-term depletion of 
the pollutants and sustainable use of the soil.
14.13.5 Fifth Criterion
The decision-making process includes an appropriate level of engagement of all stakeholders. However, 
a discussion of the potential consequences of these technologies for stakeholders should be held.
14.14 NANOPHYTOREMEDIATION CHALLENGES
Although there are many known advantages of nanomaterials, research related to nanophytoreme￾diation has not explored very much. Thus, in the future, diverse studies are required to ensure a 
proper understanding at the field level, to check the concrete effects of NPs in the nanophytoreme￾diation process and to induce changes in the soil fertility status. NP aggregation is one of the main 
issues that gives rise to their limited mobility, so NP fabrication is a win-win situation to increase 
their bioavailability. NPs’ influence and safety in contaminated soil have to be estimated and evalu￾ated. Meteorological situations are the main factors on which sustainable nanophytoremediation 
depends; thus, NPs stable in the environment identification are important. Nanophytoremediation 
is a suitable method for places that have a moderate amount of contaminants due to the unsuitable 
plant growth in extremely polluted environments. Pollutant uptake in plants from the soil needs Sustainability Nanoremediation and Nanophytoremediation 267
better understanding and will also aid agro-mining, which can be utilized for contaminant extrac￾tion from plant biomass even before harvesting.
14.15 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
OF NANOPHYTOREMEDIATION
It is a well-known fact that nanophytoremediation for environmental remediation is a new technol￾ogy, and studies related to nanophytoremediation are usually limited to labs and culture pots, that 
is, full-scale research has not yet been conducted. Based on their research, Ji et al. (2011) assessed 
that performing experiments in the field actually provides practical information towards nanophy￾toremediation technology development that cannot be delivered by tests in the lab. This difference 
is the result of culture experiments in the lab and field due to factors such as temperature, pH, soil 
type, nutrients and the moisture content of the soil, which play roles in the actual field environment 
(Vangronsveld et al.2009). Environmental remediation through nanotechnology can provide eco￾friendly and better substitutes and management without harming nature. Some hyperaccumulators 
have been identified including plants, fungi and bacteria, which have the potential to accumulate 
a considerable concentration of metals. These hyperaccumulators serve an important function in 
bioremediation in heavy metal-polluted areas. Different forms of nanomaterials can be employed 
for environmental clean up, and there is a basic need to understand the process behind the mobility 
of NPs in the environment to ameliorate any detrimental effects posed to plants or the environment 
overall. Accordingly, the selection of suitable NPs and plant species for the environment should be 
the priority, along with agronomic optimization management for high-end remediation processes. 
With its innovative potential, multi-disciplinary nature, foreseen opportunities and influences from 
its probable benefits, nanotechnology has been acknowledged as a field of the utmost importance. 
To find solutions for hunger and increase production, the hope lies in nanoproducts utilized in an 
eco-friendly manner.

Emerging Techniques for the 
Treatment of Wastewater
Neha Naaz, Zubair Ahmad, Adil Shafi, and Sana Choudhary
15.1 INTRODUCTION
Over recent decades, drugs, personal care products, xenobiotics, steroid hormones and volatile 
organic compounds have been described as emerging contaminants (ECs) because of their probable 
inimical effects on aquatic environments and their anthropological strength, and they have been 
extensively reported to be in different water matrices such as surface water, drinking water treatment 
plants, wastewater and wastewater treatment plant effluents (Anawar and Ahmed, 2019; Sgroi et al., 
2017; Tran et al., 2018). Thus, the elimination of ECs is imperative to the generation of safe drinking 
water, and water supply and treatment has frequently taken precedence over wastewater collection 
and treatment in the past (Grassi et al., 2012). Some of the main sources of ECs are untreated urban 
wastewater and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that cause serious soil and water pol￾lution (Petrović et al., 2003). Conventional techniques cannot eradicate emerging pollutants and their 
metabolites from the water. Consequently, ECs end up threatening all living organisms through the 
feminization of aquatic organisms, endocrine disruption, bacterial resistance and cancer (Mohapatra 
and Kirpalani, 2019). Hence, the development of advanced wastewater treatment technologies is 
necessary to recover the final status or biodegradability of the water. Emerging technologies include 
innovations that correspond to an advanced progression within a domain of competitive worth.
15.2 EMERGING TECHNIQUES FOR THE TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
15.2.1 Advanced Oxidation Processes
Glaze (1987) interpreted advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as near-ambient temperature treat￾ment procedures attributed to extremely reactive radicals; specifically, the hydroxyl radical (·OH) 
is the primary oxidizing agent. The hydroxyl radical is a potent, unselective reactive species that 
oxidizes several reduced compounds and starts a sequence of oxidative degeneration reactions (Goi, 
2005; Bajpai, 2017). Table 15.1 illustrates the redox potential of several chemical oxidizing agents 
that are generally used in water and wastewater treatment. Various strong oxidants applied in AOPs 
are shown in Table 15.2. The OH radicals are usually generated by integrating ozone (O3), titanium 
dioxide (TiO2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, high electron beam irra￾diation and heterogeneous photo-catalysis. Of these, O3/H2O2, O3/UV and H2O2/UV facilitate the 
detoxification of water and wastewater (Zhou and Smith, 2002).
Usually, extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals recruit a sequence of oxidative deterioration reac￾tions of organic compounds existing in wastewater through subsequent methods (Huang et al., 1993):
1. Hydroxyl radical addition reaction:
OH· + R → ROH· → hydroxylated products K≈ 107–1010 M−1s−1
2. H2 abstraction:
OH· + R → R· + H2O → oxidized products K≈ 107–1010 M−1s−1
15Emerging Techniques for the Treatment of Wastewater 277
However, the hydroxyl radical causes the partial oxidation of non-decomposable organic com￾pounds. Accordingly, the biodegradability of effluent will intensify and could be decisive for the 
proper elimination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in a post-biological treatment method (Chang 
et al., 2004; Balcioğlu et al., 2007; Bijan and Mohseni, 2008; Simstich and Oeller, 2010).
AOPs are employed as pre- and/or post-procedures of biological treatment (Figure 15.1). 
AOPs endeavor to improve the quality of wastewater and facilitate their process of treatment 
through ordinary microorganisms in the pre-procedure (Karimi et al., 1997; Karrer et al., 1997; 
Yu et al., 1998; Bila et al., 2005; Cesaro et al., 2013). In the post-procedure, the process of 
oxidation excludes the pollutants, but they are not entirely destroyed throughout the biological 
treatment (Poole, 2004; Cesaro et al., 2013). High concentrations of aliphatic carboxylic acids 
or hydroxyl radical scavengers in the effluents are difficult to oxidize, resulting in reduced deg￾radation rates (Bajpai, 2017). 
15.3 OZONATION
Ozonation reveals a strong oxidizing power with brief reaction periods, although it is an energy￾intensive process described by high operating costs while allowing the treatment of a considerable

amount of wastewater (Cesaro et al., 2013). Ozone (O3) is a strong oxidizing agent for water and 
wastewater with a redox potential of 2.07 V. Once O3 is dissolved in water, it undergoes a complex 
series of reactions in two dissimilar ways: through direct oxidation or by the creation of OH radicals 
and superoxide radicals (Al-Kdasi et al., 2004).
O3  OH-   O* * 
2 2 HO
O O 3 2  O O * *  
2 3  
O* *  
3 3  HO
HO*
3  OH * + O2
Ozonation is feasibly carried out at diverse pH values. Of these, the best results are shown at high 
pH values because of the reaction of organic and inorganic complexes with the ozone and radicals. 
Another significant parameter is the dose of ozone, which affects the extent of oxidation. A ten-fold 
increase of ozone dosage enhances the rate of the discoloration of treated water (Bajpai, 2017).
Various devices can be operated to transfer the generated ozone into water including jet reac￾tors, countercurrent bubble columns, static mixers, agitated vessels and packed and plate columns 
(Bowers et al., 1973; Glaze et al., 1987; Munter et al., 1993). Figure 15.2 depicts the equipment 
generally employed for ozonation (Goi, 2005).
Presently, there are more than 4,000 ozonation plants functioning globally. Moreover, ozone 
applications can be categorized as a potent disinfectant and a strong oxidizing agent (Paillard et al., 
1989). For disinfection, ozone effectively inactivates the bacterial species including the coliform 
bacteria and other resistant pathogenic microbes, specifically, Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia
spp., from municipal waters through water treatment. As an oxidant, ozone will become more potent 
after disintegration and turn into extremely reactive radicals to oxidize the chemical contaminants 
(Zhou and Smith, 2002). Sangave et al. (2007a) considered what ozonation meant for the biological 
processing of distillery wastewater alone as pre- and post-treatment, which achieved a 79% reduc￾tion of pollutants; moreover, a 35% COD reduction occurred over the non-ozonated sample.
Ozone should be united with other oxidizing agents, particularly UV irradiation or hydrogen per￾oxide, thereby increasing the formation of radicals and thus degrading the contaminants at higher 
rates (Gogate and Pandit, 2004).
On combining O3 with UV or peroxide, AOPs are generated, which reduce the highly persistent 
substances and assist in rendering nondegradable water contaminants to be non-toxic (Bajpai, 2017).
The UV/ozone system is an efficient technique intended for the oxidation and demolition of 
organic compounds existing in water (Rodríguez, 2003). UV photons stimulate the ozone molecules,

thus enabling the production of hydroxyl radicals (Peyton and Glaze, 1988). Hydrogen peroxide 
is generated through the photolysis of O3 in water and is then photolyzed into hydroxyl radicals 
(García et al., 2017). Several researchers have examined the efficacy of this process with distinct 
aromatic compounds. It was observed that the ozone/UV system is more efficient, except for the 
UV/H2O2 system, for the deprivation of p-chloronitrobenzene (Guittonneau et al., 1990). However, 
it was stated that ozone alone was not more economical than the O3/UV system (Rodríguez et al., 
1999). The UV/O3 process improves the aerobic deprivation of distillery wastewater and reduces the 
COD up to around 45% (Sangave et al., 2007b).
O3/H2O2 (Peroxone): The incorporation of H2 2
yl radicals, where H2O2 is –
2 ), which reacts with ozo
O into ozone in water accelerates the degradation 
of ozone and leads to the production of hydrox partially segregated in the 
aqueous solution as hydroperoxide anion (HO ne and initiates a series of 
chain reactions (Rodríguez, 2003).
H2O2 + H2O → HO2
− + H3O+
HO2
− + O3 → ·OH + O2
− + O2
At lower concentrations, the hydroperoxide (HO2
−) ion is efficient in commencing ozone degrada￾tion and facilitates the OH radical’s creation. The degradation of ozone increases with an increase 
in the pH level.
Alnaizy and Akgerman (2000) reported that the H2O2/UV combination improved the derogation 
of phenol compared to direct photolysis.
In the H2O2/UV system, hydroxyl radicals are formed through the photolysis of H2O2. Then, OH 
radicals react with organic impurities or undergo an H2O2 degeneration creation cycle (Crittenden 
et al., 1999).
H2O2 + hv → 2 ·OH
H2O2 + ·OH → H2O + HO2
HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2
Alaton and Balciog (2002) demonstrate the efficacy of the H2O2/UV approach even as a pretreat￾ment method or by integrating it with additional AOPs of textile wastewater.

15.4 FENTON PROCESS
This process was reported for maleic acid oxidation by Fenton in 1884. Amongst all AOPs, The 
Fenton process has been demonstrated to be easier to operate and is found to be more efficient 
with reference to the removal rate. Fenton’s reagent targets organic pollutants such as poly￾phenols, soluble substances and aromatic nucleophilic compounds (Bajpai, 2017). According 
to Haber and Weiss (1934), the Fenton reaction is built on the electron transfer between H2O2
and Fe2+ and acts as a catalyst to produce an OH radical, which, in turn, degrades the organic 
compounds:
Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + OH
The factors affecting the extent of Fenton processes are the concentration of H2O2, pH of the 
solution, amount of Fe2+ ions, initial concentration of contaminants and the occurrence of other 
ions (Gogate and Pandit, 2004). Furthermore, Fenton reagent action can be enhanced once it is 
subjected to UV radiation (Arana et al., 2001). Pirkanniemi et al. (2007) analyzed the mean￾ing of the Fenton procedure for the elimination of EDTA from ECF bleaching effluent and 
concluded that it can be utilized as an efficient pretreatment that precedes biological treatment. 
Fenton processes employed to industrial wastewaters, such as tannery effluents with low pH and 
the presence of aromatic compounds at high temperature (Cesaro et al., 2013). Pera-Titus et al. 
(2004), proved to be beneficial in terms of the removal of insecticides and contaminants from the 
refinery, rubber and plastic industries. By considering some disadvantages of Fenton’s process, 
Fenton’s method is applied in combination with the cavitation process. Here, ultrasound waves 
are used to produce hydroxyl radicals to enhance the conversion rate and degeneration of organic 
compounds present in wastewater. Moreover, cavitation, along with the ultrasound waves, affect 
the organic contaminants through pyrolysis, as many of them are not influenced by OH radicals 
(Sharma et al., 2019).
15.5 PHOTO-FENTON PROCESS
Fenton’s elemental incorporation with UV light reduces the ferric ions and thus produces ferrous 
ions along with hydroxyl radical content through photolysis (Hermosilla et al., 2015):
Fe (III) OH2+ + hv → Fe2+ + OH
Photo-Fenton process proved to be better at eliminating organic compounds and appears in the con￾centrate from reverse osmosis (RO) (Hermosilla et al., 2012). This method is more economical in 
the deprivation of effluent elements compared to its dark version and thus enhances both the amount 
and the rate of total organic carbon (TOC) decline in contrast with the UV/H2O2approach (Catalkaya 
and Kargi, 2007; Karimi et al., 2010; Hermosilla et al., 2009, 2012).
15.6 HETEROGENEOUS PHOTOCATALYSIS
Heterogeneous photocatalysis processes enhanced via the activity of a semiconductor catalyst are 
broadly utilized, and the most efficient is TiO2 (Vogelpohl, 2007). The anatase form of TiO2 pos￾sesses the remarkable attributes of being economical and highly robust and shows good performance 
(Andreozzi et al., 1999). The mechanism involves the transition of electrons from the valence to 
the conduction band as a product of the light irradiation of the catalyst. Thus, drifting electrons, 
along with the holes formed in the valence band, can contribute to redox reactions with compounds 
immersed on the photocatalyst (Rizzo, 2011). TiO2/UV and TiO2/H2O2/UV are the most significant 
heterogeneous photocatalytic processes.Emerging Techniques for the Treatment of Wastewater 281
15.7 AOPS COMBINED WITH BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS
Biological analyses of groundwater, hazardous waste and wastewater are considered the most effi￾cient alternatives compared with other analyses (Rodríguez, 2003). The capability of a compound 
to experience biological deprivation is influenced by various aspects (Bajpai, 2017):
• Chemical structure,
• Substituents of the target compound,
• Concentration,
• pH, and
• Occurrence of inhibitory compounds.
According to Scott and Ollis (1995), AOPs combined with biological processes can successfully 
treat industrial wastewater containing bio-resistant and recalcitrant compounds along with waste￾waters holding toxins that cause noxiousness to microorganisms. Several researchers have exhib￾ited the efficiency of a coupled chemical and biological treatment leading to the mineralization 
of biorecalcitrant industrial impurities (Scott and Ollis, 1995; Pulgarin et al., 1999; Parra et al., 
2000; Sarria et al., 2001). According to Alaton and Balciog (2002), ozonation, in addition to H2O2/
UV, for the pretreatment of textile wastewater improves the efficacy of a subsequent biological 
treatment.
15.8 MEMBRANE FILTRATION TECHNOLOGIES
Membrane filtration processes offer several advantages over conventional water treatment proce￾dures and reduce the environmental effect of effluents while offering reduced land obligations and 
the capability for mobile analysis units (Owen et al., 1995). Membrane filtration is an innovative 
technique for the exclusion of tint, COD and salinity through the treatment of wastewater (Zheng 
et al., 2013). The membranes used in filtration techniques may be polymeric, organo-mineral, 
metallic or ceramic (Van Der Bruggen et al., 2003). Membrane filtration is classified with respect 
to the pore sizes of the membranes. However, the membrane’s potential is estimated over the perme￾ates flux and the rejection mechanism (Ahmad et al., 2015).
15.8.1 Ultrafiltration
Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes possess pore sizes ranging from 0.1 to 0.001µm. However, lower 
rejection can be achieved through a larger pore size. This filtration process requires lower pres￾sure to be more economical than nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. UF membranes are prepared

Microfiltration (MF) ˃0.05 High 0.03–0.3 Disinfection barrier282 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
with polysulphone/poly(ether sulfone)/sulphonated polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile and related block 
copolymers, polyvinylidene fluoride, cellulosic, etc. by phase inversion. Polymer blends with poly￾vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are frequently used to increase the membrane’s hydrophilicity (Van Der 
Bruggen et al., 2003). Alventosa-deLara et al. (2012) used the ceramic membrane of 150kDa as an 
ultrafiltration membrane to eradicate Reactive Black 5. More than a 79.8% rejection was achieved 
through RSM optimization, and the rejection persisted over 70% even at a high dye application 
(500 mg/L). Mondal et al. (2012) studied polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration (PEUF). Here, a 
polymer such as poly (ammonium acrylate), poly (acrylic acid) and cellulose membrane of 10kDa 
is used. The polymer molecules are complexified with solutes to produce macromolecules that could 
be preserved by the ultrafiltration membrane. Consequently, there was an increase in rejection with 
the polymer concentration. Dye-polymer interactions are pH-dependent. Dye removal will be higher 
at a 2-bar transmembrane pressure. Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) augments UF by add￾ing surfactants to the dye solution and forming micelles with dye molecules trapped in it. Ngang et 
al. (2012) studied MEUF including SDS as the surfactant by utilizing a polysulfone membrane, and 
the polyvinylidene fluoride-titanium dioxide (PVDF-TiO2) mixed membranes showed 99.3% rejec￾tion at 300kPa and 99% rejection at 0.5 bar, respectively. Therefore, PVDF-TiO2 has considerable 
UV disinfecting activity, which simplifies its management.
15.9 NANOFILTRATION
Nanofiltration (NF) is a recently established membrane technique for the treatment and decontami￾nation of wastewater. NF membranes have pore sizes ranging from 1 to 10 Å and are designed for 
the elimination of organic pollutants. NF membranes offer a higher permeate flux, lower osmotic 
potential and higher retention of multivalent salts over UF and RO membranes, but they are not effi￾cient for the rejection of monovalent ions, especially chloride (Mänttäri and Nyström, 2007). The 
membranes are fabricated of polysulfone/poly(ether sulfone)/sulfonated polysulfone, aromatic poly￾amide, poly(piperazine amide) or cellulose acetate. NF membranes can reduce the hardness, total 
dissolved solids (TDS), tint and odor and can eliminate heavy metals from groundwater (Sharma 
and Sharma, 2012). NF has the ability to eliminate 98% of the color from industrial effluents, while 
UF eliminates only 90% (Aouni et al., 2012). Interfacial polymerization has led to the development 
of innovative NF composite membranes, which are able to eliminate over 90% of Safranin O and 
Aniline Blue dyes at pH 11 (Shao et al., 2013).
15.10 NANOTECHNOLOGY
Recent innovations in environmental techniques have revealed nanoparticles as efficient solu￾tions to various current concerns involving energy utilization, pollution and waste control. The 
nano dimensional particles have accelerated innovative and upgraded technologies in several fac￾ets of environmental preservation and remediation (Dervin et al., 2016). The approach of nano￾technology has offered innumerable prospects to decontaminate water even at the ionic state (Das 
et al., 2014).
15.11 NANOPARTICLES
A nanoparticle is very minute, possesses a high surface area-to-volume ratio and is employed to 
distinguish subtle contaminants (Lu and Zhao, 2004). Nanomaterials have advantages of a high 
surface area, advanced reactivity and better discarding ability (Yunus et al., 2012). Nanomaterials 
have displayed effective antimicrobial activities through diverse mechanisms, including the photo￾catalytic creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that disfigure cell constituents and viruses, and 
they comprise a bacterial cell envelope such as carboxyfullerene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), ZnO 
and silver nanoparticles (nAg). Nanomembranes and nanosensors have also been utilized effectively 
to generate potable water and to detect single cells, respectively (Ahmed et al., 2014).Emerging Techniques for the Treatment of Wastewater 283
Several researchers have reported that on applying an external magnetic field, magnetic nanopar￾ticles have the potential to remove dyes from wastewater (Kong et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013b). Acid 
leaching-precipitation and co-precipitation are the procedures to produce magnetite nanoparticles. 
Recently, manganese ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized via manganese nitrate and iron 
nitrate for the exclusion of dyes (Direct green 6, Acid red 18 and Direct red 31) from the binary 
system (Mehmoodi, 2014). Additionally, non-magnetic nanoparticles were tested for the exclusion 
of dyes from wastewater. Assefi et al. (2014) synthesized a cobalt (III) oxide (Co2O3) nanoparticle 
stacked on an adsorbent (activated carbon) and detected it as an excellent adsorbent for the exclusion 
of Eosin Y, a perilous dye, from the solution. As a result, it was determined that Co2O3-NP-AC is 
considered an efficacious, green and economical adsorbent with high adsorption ability for remov￾ing dyes from solutions.
15.12 SILVER NANOPARTICLES
Silver nanoparticles can be used against bacteria, fungi and viruses due to their biocidal efficacy in 
the exclusion of small impurities, water filtration and water quality assessment (Ahmed et al., 2014). 
Some researchers have evaluated the biocidal action of Ag nanoparticles (Panáček et al., 2006; Kim 
et al., 2007; Shrivastava et al., 2007). Silvestry-Rodriguez et al. (2007) reported that silver dimin￾ishes aquatic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila by immobi￾lizing them. Silver nanoparticles exhibit a prominent antibacterial/antifungal impact (Khaydarov 
et al., 2009). Another finding revealed that the bactericidal impact of silver (Ag) nanoparticles on 
gram-negative bacteria is size-reliant (Morones et al., 2005).
The usage of Ag nanoparticles along with ultrasonic emissions for a brief time in the case of coli￾form bacteria improves the antibacterial outcome (Tiwari et al., 2008). It was reported that polypro￾pylene filters coated with Ag nanoparticles of size 45 nm were used in water purification. After 6.5 
hours, no bacteria were identified in the solution when the water had a bacterial load of 103 CFU/ml. 
Furthermore, nano silver-coated filters are absolutely active in the case of E. coli, and the leaching of 
Ag nanoparticles examined through the inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry of a filtered 
water sample was found to be nil (Heidarpour et al., 2011). Water filters fabricated of Ag nanoparti￾cles coated on polyurethane foam were utilized, and leaching was not seen (Jain and Pradeep, 2005).
15.13 NANO ZERO-VALENT IRON
Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) is a promising treatment for polluted soil and groundwater. Until 
1998, a common system was used to rectify water, namely, the ‘pump and treat’ system. Currently, 
another approach to rectify water is a permeable reactive barrier (PRB), which purifies groundwa￾ter. This system is utilized to clean up contaminants including aromatic nitro compounds, chlori￾nated hydrocarbons, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chromate compounds (Yunus 
et al., 2012). Uyttebroek et al. (2010) observed that zero-valent metals, particularly iron (ZVI), 
which is recommended as a filter material of PRB, reduces hazardous pollutants from the water 
in bulk amounts. The nano-iron is efficient in its multifunctional utilization for remediation pur￾poses. It was recognized that nZVI possesses high reactivity for a substantial quantity of chemicals, 
involving chlorinated hydrocarbons, Cu2+, Eqn0008.eps and nitrate (Yunus et al., 2012). Ferritin is 
an iron-encompassing protein and has the potential ability to rectify toxic metals and chlorocarbon 
in solar radiation or visible light (Moretz, 2004). Ferritin is more stable and does not react under 
photoreduction, which is an advantage over ordinary iron.
15.14 NANO-ADSORBENTS
Adsorption is a highly technical and economically sustainable approach for removing organic and 
inorganic pollutants by treating water and wastewater. Nano-adsorbents offer a large surface area, 284 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
short intraparticle diffusion gap, associated adsorption sites, surface chemistry and tunable pore 
dimension (Qu et al., 2013). Activated carbon, aluminosilicate, zeolites, clay and peat kaolin are 
the different materials used for removing metals from solutions through wastewater treatment. 
Currently, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) acquire an arrangement of carbon nanofibers (CNFs), 
and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are novel adsorbents with exceptional performance because of their 
elevated aspect ratio and high specific surface area (Sharma and Sharma, 2012). Based on several 
findings, CNTs are found to be superior adsorbents in contrast to activated carbon in terms of heavy 
metals (e.g., Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+), and because of the short intraparticle diffusion gap and 
highly exposed adsorption sites, the adsorption kinetics are rapid on CNTs (Qu et al., 2013). Gao 
et al. (2011) stated that sand pellets encrusted by graphite oxide were effective in eliminating Hg2
+
and a large dye particle (Rhodamine B) in contrast to commercially activated carbon. Metal oxide 
nanoparticles such as TiO2, iron oxide and alumina have been investigated to exclude certain types 
of heavy metals, particularly mercury, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, lead, copper and nickel, and 
have a significant ability to defeat activated carbon (Qu et al., 2013). According to Li et al. (2003b), 
multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have a metal-ion adsorption capacity 3–4 times greater 
than granular activated carbon (GAC) and powder.
15.15 NANOFIBERS AND NANOBIOCIDES
Nanofiber technology, combined with biological treatment, is an advanced method for the exclusion of 
noxious xenobiotics in industrial wastewater treatment procedures. Nanobiocides (metal nanoparticles 
and engineered nanoparticles) are effectively merged among nanofibers, and they exhibit both anti￾microbial action and stability in water. The quality of water is reduced by membrane fouling caused 
by bacteria, and these bacteria are immobilized by triggering surface-modified nanofibers. On the 
basis of these outcomes, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers, including 
Ag nanoparticles, have antimicrobial action, with a 91–99% reduction of bacteria in a polluted sample 
by PVA nanofibers and 100% by PAN nanofibers (Yunus et al., 2012). Regarding the polymer nature, 
nanofibers are moldable, durable and chemically resistant. An important benefit of nanofiber is its 
contrasting nature with the surface morphology, biocompatibility and dimension of microorganisms, 
which allows surface colonization by the microorganisms (Sharma and Sharma, 2012).
15.16 NANOSENSORS
New sensor techniques have been established through merging fabrication approaches at the 
microscale and nanoscale to generate tiny, compact and extremely specific sensors that identify the 
minute quantity of biochemical and chemical material in water (Hillie et al., 2006). The analysis 
of water quality can be conducted via nanosensors as these are utilized to detect E. coli and other 
bacteria. They can distinguish bacteria in a short period of time, as nanosensors flash light on the 
existence of bacteria in water samples. Nanoshells, quantum dots and CNTs are the nanomateri￾als employed within nanosensors to analyze water status (Ahmed et al., 2014). Schoen et al. (2010) 
stated that a gravity-fed device functioning at 100,000 l/(hm2
) inactivates >98% of microorganisms 
at minute flashes of the incubation period through silver nanowires, cotton and CNTs. The recogni￾tion of microbes through gold nanoshells associated with antibodies is one nanotechnology-based 
method (Nostrand, 2007). Antibodies identify the antigens and apply infrared (IR) radiation for 
5 min at 808 nm at 1 W cm2; the transmission of energy leads to bacterial cell lysis.
15.17 PHOTOCATALYSIS
Photocatalysis utilizes nanostructures of a metal oxide semiconductor, particularly titania (TiO), ZnO, 
zinc stannate (Zn2SnO) and tungsten oxide (WO3). Photocatalysis is a mode of water decontamina￾tion, as it removes chemical and biological pollutants (Ahmed et al., 2014). TiO2 has been extensively Emerging Techniques for the Treatment of Wastewater 285
exploited for water or wastewater treatment as it is a semiconductor photo-catalyst due to its chemical 
firmness, economical attribute, low toxicity and profusion as a raw material. It creates an electron/
hole (e-
/h+) pair upon imbibing a UV photon, forming ROS or undergoing an undesired recombina￾tion. In optimizing the particle size and shape, the photo-activity of nano-TiO2 can be improved by 
diminishing e-
/h+ recombination via noble metal doping, amplifying reactive facets and enhancing 
surface treatment pollutant adsorption. Nano-TiO2-assisted solar disinfection (SODIS) has generally 
been tested and exists as a viable alternative to generate safe drinking water in remote zones of devel￾oping countries. The conventional technique of photocatalysis applied to water decontamination can 
be operative by using ZnO and TiO2 nanostructures. Through this method, E. coli concentration in 
water reduces in just 1 hour to a safe level (Li et al., 2010). Accordingly, ZnO and TiO2 photocatalysis 
has emerged as an alternative technique designed for the decontamination of industrial run-off and 
drinking water (Grieken et al., 2009; Baruah and Dutta, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012).
15.18 NANOCELLULOSE
Because of its high strength and significant surface area, nanocellulose is utilized in eliminat￾ing pollutants and disinfecting industrial and drinking water systems (Wang, 2019). Cellulosic 
materials in mechanical or chemical processes can be transformed within cellulose nanofibers 
(CNFs), nanocrystals (CNCs) and nanowhiskers (CNWs), which have excellent capability for water 
purification. The pioneering effort by Saito and Isogai (2005) directed the practice of TEMPO￾oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNFs) for the exclusion of different metals including Pb2+, La3+
and Ag1+ from water. TEMPO oxidation of cellulose pulp results in the formation of 2,3,6-tricar￾boxy cellulose nanofibers (TPC-CNFs), followed by periodate-chlorite oxidation (Abou-Zeid et 
al., 2018). TPC-CNFs assist in the effective adsorption of Cu2+, Ca2+ and Pb2+ (heavy metal ions) 
from samples.
Nanocellulose with succinylation leads to stable, effective and biodegradable adsorbents. 
Furthermore, Yu et al. (2013) reported that the esterification of OH groups on CNC associated 
with succinic anhydride results in the maximal adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ at pH 5.5 and 6.5, 
respectively. Srivastava et al. (2012) demonstrated the ability of functionalized CNFs attained 
by succinic anhydride-modified mercerization to adsorb Cr3+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ with superior 
efficacies compared to unfunctionalized CNFs. The modification in succinylated CNFs results 
in an expanded surface area and the approachability of a large quantity of hydroxyl moieties for 
succinylation.
Mercury ions are believed to be a major health issue because of their noxiousness and bioac￾cumulation. It was suggested that the feasibility of spherical nanocellulose (SNC) be assessed as 
adsorbents for metallic ions from water (Peng et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2015). Other efforts stated 
that the production of novel thiolated-SNCs through acid hydrolysis and lipase-catalyzed esterifica￾tion with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) exhibits prompt adsorption of 98% Hg2+ ions within 
20 mins from a 100 ppm solution (Ram and Chauhan, 2018). The carboxylated CNCs are produced 
via the esterification of surface hydroxyl moeities with maleic anhydride, which shows a higher 
uptake efficiency of cationic dyes, including methylene blue, crystal violet and malachite green 
(Qiao et al., 2015). Moreover, phenol uptake in the water was examined for a composite film com￾prising CNF, along with in-situ fabricated hydroxyapatite particles by wet chemical precipitation 
(Narwade et al., 2017). Jackson et al. (2011) confirmed that sulfated CNCs could imbibe drugs 
such as tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) from the water. 
Additionally, deposits of imipramine hydrochloride and procaine hydrochloride were adsorbed 
by biodegradable b-cyclodextrin-modified CNC/Fe3O4/SiO2 superparamagnetic nanorods from 
wastewater (Chen et al., 2014). The nanocellulose approach is believed to be a favorable mode 
to combat the evolving water pollution crisis worldwide. However, functionalized nanocellulose 
exhibits adsorption performance, which is better for conventional adsorbents meant for the elimina￾tion of organic contaminants and heavy metals.286 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
15.19 CARBON NANOTUBE MEMBRANES
CNTs are innovative membrane techniques that offer minimal energy solutions for water detoxifica￾tion. CNTs allow an ultraefficient route to water due to their high aspect ratio, smooth hydrophobic 
walls and inner pore diameter. Thomas and Mcgaughey (2008) stated that water does not follow a 
simple fluidics mechanism. Ahn et al. (2012) explained “Nanofluidics” to simulate water movement 
through a nanotube structure. It was observed that the frictionless passage of water had high-level of 
velocities of 9.5 to 43.0 cm s−1/bar over a 7-nm diameter of membrane pore. It was 4–5-fold more rapid 
than standard fluid movement (Majumder et al., 2005). CNT membranes are fabricated with vari￾ous nanoparticles for example, Cu, Pt, TiO2, Ag, Pd, Au, biomolecules (DNA, proteins and pollutant 
degradative enzymes) and polymers that have effectual membrane properties, which consequently 
widened the use of CNTs in water salination (Hooijdonk et al., 2013). CNTs with nano-porous sur￾faces are suitable for declining micropollutants and ions in the sample. The cytotoxic effects reduce 
biofouling and enhance membrane survival by killing and eliminating pathogens (Das et al., 2014).
The functionalization of CNT membranes is a prerequisite for CNT-based water desalination. 
CNTs are usually tainted with impurities, metal catalysts and physical heterogeneities (Mauter and 
Elimelech, 2008). In addition, CNTs are capped into the hemisphere like fullerene-type curvatures 
throughout production and decontamination (Li et al., 2003a, 2003b). Functionalization can attach 
negative (-COO-, sulfonic groups), positive (-NH3+) and hydrophobic (aromatic rings) moeities on 
CNT surfaces (Goh et al., 2013; Guillen and Hoek, 2009). This makes CNT membranes selective for 
specific pollutant retention and improves water influx over the nanotube hole. CNTs show mechani￾cal and thermal strength, good water permeability, fouling resistance, self-cleaning functions and 
pollutant degradation (Qu et al., 2013). Chan et al. (2013) attained 100% ion rejection with simulated 
and manufactured CNTs that possessed two zwitter ions at their apex while having 0% in the non￾functionalized membrane. Corry (2011) successfully eliminated 100% Na2+ and Cl- through func￾tionalized CNTs holding -COOH, -NH3 and -OH moieties. Yang et al. (2013) investigated modified 
CNTs through plasma treatment, and the ability of salt uptake exceeded 400% by weight, which is 
higher than the activated carbon-based material by two orders of magnitude, for water desalination. 
CNTs with an elevated water flux and selective salt rejection have elevated their potential for water 
detoxification.
15.20 2D NANOSTRUCTURES
2D nanostructures, because of their large specific surface area, atomic thickness, mechanical 
potency and extreme durability, are considered to be suitable as a detoxification and water decon￾tamination membrane substance (Dervin et al., 2016). David Cohen-Tanugi and Jeffrey Grossman 
(2012) observed the desalination ability of graphene membranes that reveals synthetic nanopores 
that essentially filter sodium chloride salt from water, which have a permeability larger than tra￾ditional RO membranes. The outcomes indicated that graphene membranes were efficient in the 
100% rejection of salt ions, thus allowing water transport at speeds ranging from 10–100 L/cm2/day/
MPa (Nicolaï et al., 2014). Graphene oxide framework (GOF) materials are nanoporous materials 
that include loaded sheets of graphene oxide (GO) covalently bonded with one another via a linear 
boronic acid backbone, which are called linkers. Thus, the hydrophobicity of graphene and linker 
concentration offers tremendous water permeation and filtration, respectively (Srinivas et al., 2011). 
Nicolaï et al. (2014) highlighted that the water permeability of GOF membrane at levels ranging 
from ̴ 5 to 400 L/cm2/day/MPa with a linker concentration of n ≤ 32 exhibits a 100% rejection. GO 
combined with polymer enhances water flux and antimicrobial and mechanical properties (Hu and 
Mi, 2013). A 1,3,5-benzene tricarbonyl trichloride associated GO membrane resulted in a 46–66% 
rejection of methylene blue and 93–95% rejection of Rhodamine-WT at flow rates ranging from 
80–276 L/M/H/MPa. Ultimately, polymer cross-link GO membranes are model water distillation, 
pharmaceutical and fuel separation membranes (Ma et al., 2017). Xu et al. (2013a) determined that 
GO-TiO2 composite membranes successfully eliminate 100% of methyl orange and Rhodamine B Emerging Techniques for the Treatment of Wastewater 287
from water flux at a 7 L/m2/h flow rate. The GO-TiO2-decorated polysulfone membrane rejects 90% 
of methylene blue at an increased water flux of 45 L/m2/h (Gao et al., 2014). The aPES/GO/aGO 
functionalized membrane showed a water flux of 28 L/m2/h and a 98% salt rejection (Kim et al., 
2013). The SWCNT intercalated GO ultrathin film retained 97.4% to 98.75 of contaminants com￾prising Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), Coomassie Brilliant Blue, cytochrome c and Rhodamine B, 
which signifies ten times more water flux (660–720 L/m2/h/bar) than traditional NF membranes 
(Gao et al., 2015). MWCNT intercalated rGO membranes improved the water flux on rising inter￾layer spacing. They reject >96% of organic dyes including methyl orange and Direct yellow, along 
with 51.4% of NaCl ions and 83.5% of Na2SO4 (Han et al., 2015). Sun et al. (2013) depicted the 
rejection of 89% and 98% of Evans blue and cytochrome C when a flexible laminar partition mem￾brane made from MoS2 sheets has 3–5 times more water flux than GO at 245 L/m2/h/bar. Mxenes, 
which are 2D materials with a few atoms and dense sheets of transition metal carbonitrides and 
carbides, were utilized as filtration membranes meant for the segregation of ions and molecules 
in water. Ti3C2Tx membranes are flexible, robust and hydrophilic, and they exhibit a water flux of 
37.4 L/m2/h/bar and an increased dissociation of higher charge cations such as K+, Mg2+, Li+, Al3+, 
Na+, Ca2+, Ni2+, methylthioninium+ and MB dye cations compared to GO (Ren et al., 2015). Hence, 
2D nanostructured membranes can offer a resolution to the potential water crisis by enhancing the 
execution and commercial feasibility of existing water analysis performances.
15.21 MAGNETIC SEPARATION
Magnetic separation is a physical property that assists water decontamination; along with other 
procedures, it facilitates an improved purification technique. High-gradient magnetic separation 
(HGMS) is a widely exploited method in magnetic separations (Ambashta and Sillanpää, 2010). 
This method operates by the principle of coagulation and water purification by applying a magnetic 
field. Despite this, the steel and power industries utilize HGMS for coolant pipeline maintenance. 
Magnetically aided water purification can be categorized by relying on the variation in the adoption 
of the physical method:
• Direct decontamination,
• Seeding and parting of magnetic flocculent,
• Magnetic adsorbent use in organic and inorganic pollutants, and
• Combination activities aided by magnetic assistance.
In direct decontamination, the most common method is anti-scaling. The common elements of scale 
are CaSO4.2H2O, CaCO3 and silica, whereas additional possible scale elements are SrSO4, BaSO4, 
Ca3(PO4)2 and aluminum and ferric hydroxides. The salt concentration, intensity of the magnetic 
field, anion present in salt, physicochemical properties of water, pipe material and extent of mag￾netic field usage are only some parameters that alter the de-scaling mechanism. Magnetic pulse 
compressors are an emerging technique for the disinfection and decontamination of water (Narsetti 
et al., 2006). A brief period of electrical pulses from the pulse compressor is applied for immobiliz￾ing bacteria, spores and viruses in drinking water.
The development of a continuous low magnetic field filtration system is used together with speci￾fications for seeding and flocculating phytoplankton to disinfect lake water (Saho et al., 1999). The 
exclusion of algae, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) 
was simultaneously detected. About 93% of the phytoplankton can be flocculated out from the lake 
water by using a superconducting magnetic filter at 400 m3/day flow rates. Particular elements such 
as arsenic and phosphate pollutants have been eliminated by the seeding process for water decon￾tamination (Gokon et al., 2002; Okada et al., 2004). Through 15 mg/L of FeCl3 solution, phosphate 
ion recovery improved from 20% to 80% without the addition of magnetite but with a rising mag￾netic application from 0.8 to 8 T.288 Nano-phytoremediation and Environmental Pollution
In 1995, magnetic ion exchange resins (MIEX) were established to exclude natural organic 
matter (NOM) from water, which was advanced to the coagulation process. Coagulation elimi￾nates 60% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) linked by the 1–10k fraction, although it has a 
slight influence on the DOC concentration of the <1k fraction, while the MIEX eliminates 80% 
of DOC linked by the 1–10k fraction and 60% of the DOC related to the <10k fraction (Ambashta 
and Sillanpää, 2010). Magnetic chitosan gel particles, magnetic alginates and magnetic charcoal 
assist in the exclusion of malachite green, polycyclic dyes, crystal white and additional organic 
dyes from water solutions and suspensions (Rocher et al., 2008). The high-level efficacy of mag￾netic separations has been directed to a another arena of investigation, namely, the range of 
magnetically aided chemical separation of radionuclides (Ngomsik et al., 2005). Dendrimers 
associated with the terminal amino groups linked to the magnetic particle surface displayed a 
50–400-fold increment in the distribution coefficients for americium and europium, which is 
comparable to those devoid of dendrimers (Grüttner et al., 2005). Furthermore, 10 ppb uranium 
ions in the sample can be lowered up to or less than a 1-ppb level on using a 10 T superconducting 
high-gradient magnetic separator with a 100-ppm magnetic adsorbent (Nishimura et al., 2009). 
To exclude polluted oil from radioactive liquid waste through HGMS, the seeding process prin￾ciple was followed effectively. Subsequently, nanoscale iron materials are very efficient when 
they are intended for detoxification and the transformation of environmental chemicals, par￾ticularly organochlorine pesticides, phenols, trinitrotoluenes, chlorinated organic solvents, amino 
carboxylic acids, herbicide molinate and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. It was proved that in addition 
to organic chemicals, inorganic anionic chemicals (NO3−, Cr2O7
2−) could be deteriorated by iron 
nanoparticles (Cundy et al., 2008).
15.22 CONCLUSION
Accordingly, wastewater treatment using emerging treatment methods such as AOPs, nanomem￾branes and nanoadsorbents prove to be efficient remediation techniques for wastewater treatment. 
In addition, the nanoremediation techniques can treat persistent pollutants by both chemical reduc￾tion and catalytic processes and can be beneficial in reducing the clean-up time and avoiding deg￾radation intermediates.
The conventional techniques are not able to eliminate ECs and their metabolites from water; thus, 
they are considered less efficient compared to modern and emerging treatment methods. The emerging 
treatment methods discussed in this chapter require less manpower and are cost-effective and facile.
