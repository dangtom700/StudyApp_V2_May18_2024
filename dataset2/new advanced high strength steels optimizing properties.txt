Introducing a new book on the metallurgy of modern steels, it is appropriate to 
place the topic in a historical and economic context. In 1900, world production of 
steel was of the order of 50 million metric tonnes; in 1950, it was 200 million metric 
tonnes, and in 2018, the production was 1,800 million metric tonnes. An 
examination of the relative production in various countries reflects the complex 
economic and, alas, at times military competition that occurred during the 20th 
century and in the first 20 years of the 21st century. If we consider an economic 
indicator such as the production of automobiles, the world production is now of the 
order of 90 million vehicles each of which contains some 900 kg of steel. This figure 
reflects two essential aspects of this book. In considering the use of steel in 
automobiles, the steel is no longer simply a raw material and the detailed nature of 
the steel is integrated into the design of the automobile. This essential emphasis 
on the process of design both of the material and the engineering product is evident 
in the titles of the various chapters of this book and their authorship. The authors are 
drawn both from academic institutions and from the steel industry. In concert, they 
present not a standard text book on the detailed metallurgy of modern steels, but a 
very broad and penetrating analysis of a wide range of properties in the context of 
the utilization of steel, in the context of its behavior during the complex sequence of 
manufacturing processes, and the functionality of the material. This makes the book 
of great value both to the student and to practicing engineers and designers in 
various industries. 
In essence, the physical metallurgy of modern steels combines the factors of 
microstructure, properties and design, and essentially all the chapters in this book xiv New Advanced High Strength Steels 
reflect this concept. They also reflect advances both in experimental methods of 
analysis and in mathematical modeling. This is illustrated very clearly in Chapter 2, 
where both elastic and plastic anisotropy are treated together with predictions of the 
detailed shape of the yield surface, which are important in the analysis of sheet 
forming operations. A major change in the analysis of microstructures in steels has 
occurred since 1950, with the development of a variety of techniques in both 
scanning electron microscopy and transmission microscopy as well as new 
techniques such as atomic probe tomography (APT). The power and potential of 
these advances is well illustrated in steels in Chapter 9, where there is a remarkable 
image showing the segregation of hydrogen at a small particle of vanadium carbide 
in a high-strength steel. The study and characterization of steel microstructures has 
become much more quantitative. Instead of characterizing steels by the dominant 
phases such as austenitic, ferritic, pearlitic, bainitic or martensitic, it is now possible 
to define in a quantitative manner the dominant length scales in the microstructure 
such as grain size, the size and spacing of second phases, or the thickness, aspect 
ratio and spatial orientation of twins and a variety of lamellar phases, or the density 
of defects such as dislocations. The length scales permit the microstructure to be 
linked directly to essential basic mechanical properties such as yield stress and work 
hardening capacity. In addition, a variety of basic fracture modes such as cleavage, 
ductile fracture and intergranular fracture can be characterized by critical stresses 
linked to the scale of the microstructure. This essential linkage between 
microstructure and properties is developed in a clear and elegant fashion in the 
chapters on strain hardening (Chapter 1), resistance to fracture (Chapter 3) and 
fatigue (Chapter 4) together with modeling based either on the accumulation and 
dynamic recovery of dislocation or models based on fracture mechanics. 
Two aspects of microstructure that are more difficult to investigate and quantify 
are the nature and properties of various interfaces and gradients of microstructure. 
However, these are essential in the understanding and engineering development of 
both coating processes such as galvanizing and welding. These aspects are dealt 
with in this book in a manner that relates the important aspects of the 
microstructures to the detailed parameters of the processes. 
Earlier it was opined that the important paradigm shift in dealing with high￾strength structural steels is from given steels and structures to an integrated view of 
the relationship of microstructure – properties – and design. It is the integration of 
design that presents the biggest challenge because it involves not only design in the 
context of both process and product, but a change in scale from the microscopic (and 
indeed nanoscopic) to the full-scale macroscopic. This aspect is dealt with in the 
chapters on crash resistance (Chapter 7) and formability (Chapter 8). In crash 
resistance, the behavior of the material at very high strain rates must be considered Foreword xv 
and the detailed knowledge of the mechanical properties and fracture criteria for a 
variety of high-strength steels related to finite element models of the behavior of 
specific automotive components. In similar fashion, the assessment of formability is 
much more complex than the uniaxial tensile test because it involves interaction of 
the steel with the forming process and a sequence of complex stress states. The 
treatment of these topics in this book provides a valuable intellectual link between 
the metallurgist and the product designer. 
In summary, this is not a standard metallurgical text: It examines the 
development and utilization of modern high-strength steels in a very comprehensive 
manner, which integrates the structure and utilization of modern steels in a manner 
of basic value to a very wide audience and will be of lasting value to the 
technological community. New Advanced High Strength Steels,

The desire for stronger steels probably goes back to the origins of the first 
transformations of a mixture of ore and charcoal into iron. This was done by the 
Chalybes and the Hittites in the South Caucasus. The Hittites were certainly the first 
to use iron in weaponry, as Hittite cuneiform tablets from the 18th-century BCE 
indicate the production of iron weapons. As for the Chalybes, they were the first 
metallurgists to produce steel at the beginning of the first millennium BCE: “the hard 
iron of the Chalybes” was much sought after for its hardness. The desire to have 
stronger steels increased during the Iron Age. It was discovered that heat treatment 
in carbonaceous residues followed by tempering allowed the manufacture of very 
resistant weapons and tools. It is necessary to remember that at that time, weapons 
were mainly cast in bronze, and whoever mastered the manufacture of more resistant 
weapons had a strategic advantage that allowed them to establish their domination.
I.1. Steels, a rich metallurgy 
This ancient use of iron and steel was possible because of the large presence of 
iron ore in the earth’s crust and the specific characteristics of this alloy that make it 
both ductile and resistant. These properties come mainly from some specificities of 
steels and alloys based on the iron-carbon couple. First of all, iron has different 
structures depending on the temperature: ferrite or α iron, with a body-centered 
cubic structure, for temperatures below 912°C; austenite or γ iron, with a face-xviii New Advanced High Strength Steels 
centered cubic structure, for temperatures between 912 and 1394°C; and finally, 
again the body-centered cubic structure phase between 1394 and 1538°C, the 
melting temperature of pure iron. These different phases are inherited by the steels, 
and the content of carbon and different alloying elements can influence the size of 
the domains of existence of these different phases and the critical temperatures. For 
example, while the solubility of carbon exceeds 2 wt% in austenite at 1154°C, it is 
extremely low in ferrite and of the order of a few parts per million (ppm) at room 
temperature. Moreover, the small size of carbon atoms compared to that of iron 
atoms leads to a solid solution of insertion, that is, carbon atoms are positioned 
within the network formed by iron atoms. 
Finally, it can form a eutectoid compound, the pearlite, formed by alternating 
parallel lamellae of almost pure iron and iron carbide, the cementite, Fe3C. This 
constituent is in fact a lamellar composite associating a deformable phase and a hard 
phase. 
It is these microstructural features of steels that give them such different 
properties in terms of hardness, deformability, toughness, etc. The engineer has the 
full range of metallurgical mechanisms at his/her disposal by adjusting the chemical 
composition and the thermo-mechanical processes. By adjusting the carbon content, 
it is possible to develop different families of steels, from the softest, ferritic 
interstitial-free (IF) steels with a yield strength of just over 100 MPa, to pearlitic 
grades in which the strength increases as the spacing between the cementite lamellae 
is reduced. As the solubility of carbon is relatively low in ferrite, it is possible to 
obtain a fine hardening precipitation by adding titanium and niobium. In high￾strength low alloy (HSLA) steels, the presence of carbonitrides of about 10 nm of 
size and the small grain size, whose growth is limited by the precipitates, lead to 
mechanical strengths of up to 800 MPa. Finally, by increasing the carbon content of 
the alloy, it is possible to develop a whole range of two-phase steels composed of a 
ferritic matrix and an increasingly large volume fraction of pearlite islands. The 
mechanical properties of these steels are directly related to the volume fraction of 
the hard phase. 
In parallel, the existence of an austenitic phase at a higher temperature makes it 
possible to play on the cooling rates after hot deformation or heat treatment in order 
to obtain metastable phases. Martensite and bainite are thus hardened by an 
oversaturated carbon content and by numerous dislocations resulting from a 
non-equilibrium transformation. These hardening phases reach yield stresses above 
1000 MPa. By combining the composition of the steel and the cooling kinetics from 
the austenitic phase, it is possible to obtain dual-phase (DP) steels where the 
martensite is a hard phase in a more deformable ferritic or bainitic matrix. Introduction xix 
The addition of certain alloying elements such as nickel or manganese 
considerably increases the size of the austenitic domain to such an extent that, for 
certain chemical compositions, the steels can retain a face-centered cubic structure at 
room temperature. This is the case for austenitic stainless steels where the addition 
of more than 11% by weight of chromium provides surface protection, while the 
further addition of 8–10% nickel stabilizes the austenite. Thus, grade 18-10 
(18% Cr and 10% Ni) has been the most developed grade for cutlery and household 
items. The cost of nickel and its variability have led to a search for other alloying 
elements that can stabilize austenite, which has the advantage of a high strain 
hardening rate leading to a potential elongation greater than 50% in tension. Steels 
with a high manganese content (of the order of 22% by weight) and carbon (around 
0.6% by weight) have represented the second generation of advanced high strength 
steels, the TWin-Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steels. 
Finally, more recently, steels have been developed which combine a ferrite￾bainite matrix and metastable austenite islands, that is, that can be transformed into 
martensite under the effect of stress or strain: TRansformation-Induced Plasticity 
(TRIP) steels. These steels present a new mode of hardening insofar as the fraction 
of the second hardening phase increases during deformation. This mechanism makes 
it possible to combine high mechanical strength values – above 1200 MPa – with a 
tensile elongation of more than 15%. Precise control of thermomechanical cycles, 
in particular step cooling, enables the industrialization of these third-advanced 
high-strength grades, which are useful for lightening structures and increasing their 
safety. 
It is clear from these few examples, which are not exhaustive, that the richness 
and particularities of steel metallurgy have enabled a development that continues to 
this day. 
I.2. Steel, a dense history 
Until the 17th century, steels did not evolve much and the main mode of 
hardening remained quenching, with no study on the hardening mechanisms. One of 
the first models of hardening is attributed to René Descartes in 1639. He introduced 
the concept of “fire particles” at high temperatures, “air particles” during slow 
cooling and “water particles” during rapid cooling. The hardening of steel would 
thus result from the replacement of the “fire particles” by the smaller “water 
particles”. In 1671, Jacques Rohault used Descartes’ theory to explain that a 
“sudden” cooling prevents the particles from returning to their original position. 
They then appear frozen, leading to a denser and “stronger” steel. The work of René 
Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, published in 1722 and entitled L’Art de convertir le xx New Advanced High Strength Steels 
ferforgé en acier et l’art d’adoucir le fer fondu, marked a turning point. Based on 
the observation of the metal structure revealed by the fracture surfaces, he proposed 
an explanation of the steel hardening mechanism based on “molecular 
transformations” produced by heat. In the molecules, he distinguished between “iron 
particles” and “sulfide and salt particles” and explained that steel becomes harder 
because the “sulfide and salt particles” cannot be removed and remain fixed in the 
steel during rapid cooling. However, Réaumur was unable to define the nature of the 
“sulfide and salt particles”. They were successively renamed “phlogiston”, 
“plumbago” and “carbon” in 1800. All of this academic work gave a strong impetus 
to a better understanding of steels and to their industrialization. The industry of 
“cemented steels” developed throughout Europe and America during the 18th 
century and the first half of the 19th century. It met the needs of the mechanical 
industry, which required parts with a high surface hardness. Hardened steels were 
also highly sought after in the military field because of their hardness, as Gaspard 
Monge’s treatise Description de l’art de fabriquer des canons published in 1794 
attests. However, until the beginning of the 19th century, the design of steels was 
only based on empirical elements. 
In 1868, in a paper to the Russian Technical Society entitled The Structure of 
Steel, Chernov, an engineer at the Obukhov steel mills in St. Petersburg, 
demonstrated the existence of critical temperatures for the transformation of steel in 
the solid state. He defined the critical temperature from which it is necessary to heat 
a steel if one wants to harden it by rapid cooling. This was an important step 
forward, as Chernov’s work allowed Johan Brinell to describe, in 1885, the 
mechanism of hardening by cooling, as a process either to conserve “hardening 
carbon” as “hardening carbon” (for high cooling rates) or to convert “hardening 
carbon” into “cemented carbon” (for low cooling rates). The “cemented carbon” was 
identified in 1881 and 1888 by Abel and Muller as the compound Fe3C. Floris 
Osmond gave it the name cementite a few years later. Moreover, Osmond’s work is 
of major importance. In 1885 and 1887, he established the importance of the 
different states of carbon and showed the existence of two allotropic varieties of 
iron: α iron and β iron. He attributed the hardening properties to the ability of the 
steel to retain the stable high-temperature phase β at room temperature, which he 
called “hardenite”. However, the high-temperature β-phase and the low-temperature 
β-phase cannot have the same composition and structure, as one is non-magnetic 
and the other magnetic. To solve this contradiction, Albert Sauveur proposed to look 
at the high temperature phase as a solid solution and not as a defined compound, this 
solid solution being able to decompose during cooling into carbides dispersed in a 
magnetic ferritic matrix. This was an important step, because the hardening of steel 
was no longer seen as a process of retention of the high-temperature phase β, but as 
the decomposition of the latter. Introduction xxi 
In 1897, Le Chatelier presented the theory developed jointly with Osmond and 
concluded that above 900°C, steel is composed of a homogeneous non-magnetic 
solid solution of carbon in γ iron. On slow cooling, this solution behaves like an 
aqueous solution containing a eutectoid with 0.8% carbon, named pearlite. By rapid 
cooling, the formation of pearlite is avoided and a magnetic solid solution is formed. 
This solid solution will be named martensite in honor of the metallographer Adolf 
Martens and γ iron austenite by Osmond. Meanwhile, a first Fe-C phase diagram
was proposed by Roberts Austen in 1895. By applying the phase rule explained by 
Gibbs in 1878, Roozeboom proposed, in a 1900 work entitled Iron and steel from 
the point of view of the phase doctrine, an Fe-C diagram very similar to the one used 
today. By the end of the 19th century, the mechanisms of hardening of tempered 
steels could be considered to have been elucidated. 
At the same time, large-scale steelworks based on the Bessemer–Thomas or 
Siemens–Martin process were operating efficiently, alloying metals were available 
in large quantities, and demand was growing in fields as varied as armaments, 
railway construction, machine tools and energy. All the conditions for the 
transformation of the steel industry and the development of steel in the 20th century 
were met. As early as 1880, steel supplanted puddled iron. Interest in so-called 
special alloy steels quickly piqued, as the addition of alloying elements gave the 
steels remarkable properties, which were mainly used in the manufacture of shells, 
cannons and armor. From 1880 onwards, the steelworks concerned began to develop 
increasingly resistant special steels, fueled by a self-perpetuating process: the 
strength and toughness of the shells increased as the hardness of the armor plates 
increased and vice versa. Chrome steel shells were produced as early as 1882, and 
nickel steel armor as early as 1891. In terms of the development of alloy steels, we 
can mention the patent filed in 1882 by Sir Robert Hadfield for a revolutionary steel 
with 1.2% carbon and 12% manganese, the patent filed by the Creusot steelworks 
for the manufacture of ferrochromes and nickel stainless steels, an exhaustive 
description of which can be found in Léon Guillet’s work published in 1902 and 
entitled Étude micrographique et mécanique des aciers au nickel. In addition, the 
Americans Taylor and Maunsel White discovered self-hardening high-speed tool 
steels composed of chromium and tungsten in 1899, for which industrial production 
began in the United States in 1910. 
The discovery of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 and the 
construction of the first transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1932 by Knoll 
and Ruska accompanied the development of steel. This period marks the transition 
from empirical to scientific metallurgy. The concept of dislocation was introduced in 
1934 by Orowan, Taylor and Polanyi. The role played by dislocations on plastic 
deformation, precipitation hardening, solid solution hardening and grain size xxii New Advanced High Strength Steels 
hardening was understood well before their direct observation in TEM by Hirsch 
and Whelan in 1952. The first criterion of rupture stress based on the theory of 
elasticity was published by Griffith in 1921 under the title The Phenomena of 
Rupture and Flow in Solids. This work, taken up by Irwin in 1948 and Orowan in 
1949, was consolidated and gave the basis for modern fracture mechanics. 
A better knowledge of the relationship between the microstructure and the 
properties of steels, industrial development and the needs of the post-war period led 
to the development of steels whose mechanical properties were constantly improved. 
At the end of the First World War, governments in Europe became aware that the 
steel sector was strategic. The automotive sector became the lifeblood of national 
trade and industry in the 1920s. In Europe, from 1930 onwards, steel was produced 
not only in ingots but also as rolled products, sheets, beams, rails, tubes, wires, 
wheels, fishplates and axles. 
The 1970s marked a break in the development model for steels due to the 
combination of several factors. On the one hand, the rise in energy prices due to the 
oil crises of 1973 and 1979 had significant repercussions on energy consumption, 
production, transport and recycling costs; on the other hand, the first European 
standards relating to the emission of polluting and harmful particles by motor 
vehicles appeared as early as 1970. Finally, there was an increasing international 
awareness of environmental issues. In 1970, the Meadows report warned of the 
depletion of raw material resources and the Stockholm Conference in 1972 put 
ecological issues on the international agenda for the first time. Since then, these 
trends have become more pronounced: energy costs are higher, emission standards 
are increasingly stringent and governmental bodies are imposing financial penalties 
for CO2 emissions. In this particular context, the lightening of steel structures has 
become an important issue for the steel industry. In an attempt to meet this 
challenge, the strategy chosen has been based mainly on reducing the thickness of 
the products developed. However, it requires the development of increasingly 
resistant steels, mainly for reasons of rigidity and/or impact resistance. In fact, at 
iso-energy absorption, any relative reduction in thickness must be compensated by a 
greater relative increase in mechanical strength. This paradigm shift is the basis for 
the development of advanced high-strength steels. 
I.3. Steels, a continuous development 
This trend, observed in many sectors such as automotive, packaging, 
construction and energy, requires the search for new compromises between 
mechanical strength and processing and usage properties. Introduction xxiii 
We can mention the effort to lighten packaging steels. Over the last 20 years, the 
thicknesses of these steels have been reduced by an average of 33%. For example, 
the average thickness of a can has been reduced from 0.20 mm in 1986 to 0.13 mm 
today. 
The automotive sector has also followed this trend. In the 1990s, the need for 
lighter weight led to the massive use of HSLA steels micro-alloyed with niobium 
and titanium. Their strength was around 750 MPa. Now, ultra-high strength steels 
(1500 MPa) are widely used. A macroscopic analysis shows that these steels 
currently represent more than 15% of the steels used in vehicles. The strength target 
for vehicles is now 2000 MPa. Different steel families have been developed to meet 
this high-strength requirement. Multiphase steels of the dual phase or TRIP type 
have good forming properties. They are mainly used for cold forming of complex 
parts. The strength levels reach 1200 MPa, with developments toward 1500 MPa. In 
the case of hot forged or stamped parts, bainitic or martensitic grades are mainly 
used. They cover the range from 1000 to 2000 MPa. 
In the energy market, the evolution of in-use temperatures (an increase in 
temperatures in the context of thermal power plants, or a decrease in the context of 
fluids such as natural gas or liquefied hydrogen) requires that high-strength steels 
improve their properties such as high temperature resistance or cold fracture 
resistance (toughness). Examples are the bainitic or martensitic grades used for gas 
transport pipes or power plants. These grades are developed for their excellent 
fracture toughness. Special attention is given to their weldability, which may require 
a high reduction of carbon content. For use at very low temperatures (e.g. natural 
gas or hydrogen), steels with a high nickel content (7–9% wt) are suggested. 
The automotive sector is a good example of the development of ultra-high 
strength steels. Since the 1990s, their commercial use has developed to meet the 
challenges of safety and weight reduction. Sales of these steels1
, with a maximum 
strength of over 450 MPa and up to 2000 MPa, represented 1.3 million tons in 2010 
in Europe. With a double-digit annual growth rate, more than 4 million tons of 
ultra-high strength steels were sold in Europe in 2018. Considering that Europe 
accounts for about 20% of global automotive production, it is reasonable to estimate 
that the global figure of 20 million tons will be exceeded during the 2020s. 
1 From a commercial point of view, very high strength steels include multiphase steels 
(excluding HSLA), DP, TRIP, CP, ferrite/bainite, bainitic grades and martensitic steels. In 
2018, the production of TWIP steels represents only a marginal percentage of the production 
of very high strength steels. xxiv New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The years to come will open up new perspectives for the development of steels. 
It will be necessary to respond to environmental concerns (reduction of CO2 
emissions and increase in the use of recycled steel in steel production). As a material 
of choice in construction, steel will contribute to sustainability objectives in this 
field. New emerging manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing, also 
offer new opportunities for this material. Thus, the performance and progress of 
steels, validated by decades of experience, have excellent development prospects. 
This book, dedicated mainly to high strength steels, is based on the trade-offs 
between mechanical strength and certain properties such as strain hardening, 
anisotropy, damage and fracture, fatigue resistance and endurance, corrosion and 
oxidation resistance, crash resistance, cut edge resistance, hydrogen resistance and 
weldability. Based on a review of the physical mechanisms underlying the various 
properties sought, this book should provide a better understanding of the 
metallurgical developments in terms of microstructure, chemical composition and 
elaboration processes that have been necessary for the emergence of these new 
generations of steels. Thus, mainly intended for students and young engineers, this 
book also aims to propose an approach to development and innovation that may 
prove to be a useful guide for their future needs as materials specialists. New Advanced High Strength Steels,

1.1. Introductory remarks 
In a context of reduced energy consumption and increasingly stringent emission 
standards, many sectors such as transport, construction, packaging and energy are 
demanding increasingly resistant steels. Depending on the application, this demand 
is often accompanied by requirements for ductility, yield strength and the ratio 
between yield strength and mechanical strength. One of the most illustrative 
examples in this field is certainly the automotive sector. The steel developed and 
used must ensure passive safety through its ability to absorb kinetic energy or to 
play an anti-intrusive role in the passenger compartment. The average crushing 
force, which is the relevant quantity for energy absorption, is proportional to the 
product of the square root of the mechanical strength times the thickness of the 
material squared (Bouaziz 2013). For the anti-intrusion aspect, the maximum impact 
force (i.e. the force before buckling of the structure) is more appropriate. It is 
proportional to the product of the square root of the yield strength times the 
thickness of the material to the power of 1.75 (Bouaziz 2013). As the reduction of 
product thicknesses remains the preferred way to lighten structures, it is easy to 
understand the growing demand for steels with higher mechanical strength and/or 
yield strength. However, these aspects, which refer to the optimization between 
passive safety and weight reduction, hide another major constraint, namely 
formability. For example, formability in stamping depends on the strain hardening 2 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
and deformability in bending depends on the deformation at break usually measured 
by the area reduction (AR) of the tensile specimen after breakage (Bouaziz 2013). 
Lightweighting therefore introduces a search for trade-offs between properties that 
generally evolve antagonistically (e.g. mechanical strength and uniform elongation), 
or even a paradigm shift. The tensile properties and the possible trade-offs between 
these properties will be conditioned by the chosen metallurgical route, as the 
deformation mechanisms depend on the microstructural parameters. In this chapter, 
we will discuss the relationship between the microstructural state, the deformation 
mechanisms and the tensile properties of single and multiphase high-strength steels. 
1.2. Stress/strain curve: macroscopic quantities 
Yield strength (𝑌𝑆), mechanical strength (UTS), uniform elongation (𝑈ா௅) and 
strain hardening rate are physical quantities that characterize the mechanical 
behavior of a material. They are usually determined from the conventional tensile 
curve, which has, in the case of a ductile material, three parts marked by the 
numbers 1, 2 and 3 in Figure 1.1a: the domain of reversible elastic deformation, 
homogeneous plastic deformation and inhomogeneous plastic deformation. The 
transition between the first two domains can be marked, in which case it is easy to 
determine 𝑌𝑆 (yield strength). However, in the case of a continuous transition, yield 
strength is usually defined as 0.2% residual strain (𝑌𝑆଴.ଶ ). This transition may also 
exhibit a Lüders plateau that results from the interaction between carbon atoms and 
dislocations. It is generally characterized by a maximum and minimum stress called 
the high (𝑌𝑆௎) and low (𝑌𝑆௅) yield stress, respectively (Figure 1.1b). In the 
irreversible homogeneous plastic domain, the value of the slope ௗఙ
ௗఌ, called the 
consolidation or strain hardening rate, is less than the value of Young’s modulus and 
gradually tends to zero at the maximum of the tensile curve. Once the maximum has 
been reached, plastic deformation is found to continue, but localized in the necking 
region. This is the domain of inhomogeneous plastic deformation. The consolidation 
of the material can no longer compensate for the increase in stress. There is 
instability and progressive necking until failure is reached in the weakest cross￾sectional area of stress. 
The strain hardening of a material can be appreciated by the evolution of the 
strain hardening rate 𝜃 = ௗఙ
ௗఌ
 and/or the instantaneous strain hardening coefficient 
defined by the following relation: 
𝑛 =
𝑑𝑙𝑛(𝜎)
𝑑𝑙𝑛(𝜀) = 𝜀
𝜎
𝑑𝜎
𝑑𝜀 [1.1] Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 3 
At necking, that is, when the stress is equal to UTS, the relative increase in stress 
is exactly equal to the relative decrease in section. Taking into account that the 
volume of the specimen remains unchanged, equation [1.2] defines the criterion for 
the appearance of the necking, the so-called Considère criterion: 
𝑑𝜎
𝑑𝜀 = 𝜎 [1.2] 
This condition can also be written using the strain hardening coefficient n: 
𝑛=𝜀 [1.3] 
Equation [1.2] or [1.3] allows us to define the stress and strain at necking, which 
we will call maximum stress 𝜎௠ and uniform strain 𝜀௨. These quantities can be 
associated, respectively, with the mechanical strength UTS and the uniform strain 
𝑈ா௅.

sum of the dislocation displacement resistance stresses. In a single crystal, these are 
mainly the lattice friction stress known as Peierls–Nabarro and the Frank–Read 
source activation stress (see Appendix). In steel, other strength stresses related to the 
presence of obstacles such as atoms in solid solution and precipitates will also have 
to be considered. 
If a steel is equated with a polycrystal consisting of randomly distributed crystal 
orientations, the yield stress becomes (see Chapter 2): 
𝜎௘ = 𝑀𝜏஼ [1.4] 
where 𝑀 is the Taylor factor. 
1.3.2. Strain hardening and plasticity 
Hardening is the increase in flow stress required to plastically deform the 
material. It results from the ability of mobile dislocations to move in the material. It 
depends on the microstructure, because it is related to the density and strength of the 
obstacles constituted, in single-phase steels, by atoms in solid solution, “forest” 
dislocations, grain boundaries, twin boundaries and precipitates. 
1.3.2.1. Hardening by interaction of dislocations 
The “forest” dislocations that cut a gliding plane of a mobile dislocation will 
constitute an obstacle to the gliding of the latter (see Appendix). The critical stress 
for the crossing of “forest” dislocations by mobile dislocations is given by the 
Taylor relation: 
𝜏ௗ = 𝛼𝜇𝑏ඥ𝜌
where 𝛼, a constant between 0.2 and 0.5, measures the intensity of interactions 
between dislocations, 𝜇 is the shear modulus and 𝑏 is the modulus of the Burgers 
vector. 
Hardening by strain hardening, defined here by the formation of junctions 
between non-coplanar slip systems, called “forest” hardening, is then written as: 
𝜎௙ = 𝛼𝑀𝜇𝑏ඥ𝜌 [1.5] 
where 𝛼𝑀 is a constant close to unity in most structures present in steels. Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 5 
1.3.2.2. Isotropic component of strain hardening 
In the framework of the Mecking–Kocks–Estrin theory (Mecking 1981; Estrin 
1984), the evolution of the dislocation density per increment of plastic deformation 
is given by the following general relation: 
𝑑𝜌
𝑑𝜀 =𝑀ቌ1
𝑏෍ 1
𝐿௝ ௝
− 𝑘ଶ𝜌ቍ [1.6] 
The first term in the parenthesis, which involves the mean free path 𝐿௝ that a 
mobile dislocation can travel before encountering an obstacle j, corresponds to the 
storage of dislocations that causes hardening. It is worth, for example, ଵ
௕஽ for grain 
boundaries. The second term, proportional to the density of dislocations, 
corresponds to the dynamic recovery related to the process of annihilation of 
dislocations. It leads, by nature, to a softening. The efficiency factor 𝑘ଶ delivers that 
only dislocations of opposite Burgers vectors can annihilate. Since annihilation 
involves a thermally activated deflected slip process, it is expected, strictly speaking, 
that 𝑘ଶdepends on temperature, strain rate and stacking fault energy (SFE). 
If, for example, the relations [1.5] and [1.6] are combined, we obtain a plastic 
flow stress 𝜎௙(𝜀) that is generally independent of the deformation path, hence the 
term isotropic component of strain hardening. 
1.3.2.3. Kinematic component 
The storage of dislocations at the base of plastic hardening can have two origins: 
on the one hand, as we have seen previously, the dislocations stored under the effect 
of the forest mechanism, which are called “statistically stored dislocations” (SSD), 
and on the other hand, the storage of dislocations necessary to accommodate the 
deformation incompatibilities between the different microstructural objects. These 
are called “geometrically necessary dislocations” (GND). These two populations of 
dislocations are also differentiated by the stress fields they generate. GNDs or 
stacks, unlike SSDs, generate a long-range, polarized stress field, which is the 
source of kinematic strain hardening. 
The isotropic and kinematic components of strain hardening must often be taken 
into account if we want to understand and describe the plastic behavior of steels. 
The Bauschinger tests allows to decouple them and to measure the intensity of the 
kinematic component on strain hardening (Aouafi 2009). 6 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
1.3.2.4. Flow stress

with: 
– 𝜎଴ = 𝜎௘ = 𝑀𝜏஼, it is preferable to use the notation 𝜎଴ than 𝜎௘, because it

in all rigor, to the real elastic limit; 
– 𝜎௜௦௢: the isotropic component of strain hardening; it can be written in a general

1.4. Strain hardening and mechanical behavior of precipitation 
hardened micro-alloyed steels 
1.4.1. Introductory remarks 
In the case of single-phase ferritic matrix steels, the precipitation of nanometric 
particles and the resulting grain size refinement is an important way to increase 
mechanical strength. These steels, which can be grouped under the name “high￾strength low-alloy steels” (HSLA), generally have very good trade-offs between 
manufacturing cost, tensile mechanical properties, weldability, toughness and 
formability. They are therefore used in many fields such as transportation, 
construction, energy and packaging. Precipitation can be homogeneous and/or 
heterogeneous on microstructural defects such as grain boundaries, dislocations, but 
also on the austenite/ferrite transformation interface (Figure 1.2). 
Figure 1.2. (a) Homogeneous precipitation of titanium and molybdenum carbides 
in ferrite (repurposed from Kim 2014); (b) interphase precipitation of 
vanadium carbides in ferrite (repurposed from Chen 2014) 
In the latter case, the precipitation of carbides is called interphase, because it 
takes place on the austenite/ferrite transformation interface and concomitantly with 
the motion of the latter. This generally results in a particular arrangement of the 
carbides, because they are aligned in a direction perpendicular to the interface 
motion. This phenomenon, which generally leads to a high level of hardening, has 
received particular attention in recent years (Seto 2007). 
Figure 1.3 summarizes the possible trade-offs between strength levels and 
elongation at break of ferritic steels hardened by homogeneous/heterogeneous 
precipitation and interphase. For comparison, the properties for steels hardened 
exclusively by ferritic grain size refinement are shown. The presence of precipitates 
and grain size refinement resulting from the interaction between precipitation and 
recrystallization of hot austenite and/or cold ferrite contribute to higher strength 
levels and interesting strength/ductility trade-offs.

precipitation (empty circles) and interphase precipitation (diamonds). For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
1.4.2. Identification of the different contributions to strain hardening 
In the presence of micro-alloys and precipitates, the ferritic grain size is 
generally small of the order of a few micrometers. We can then identify four main 
types of obstacles to the movement of dislocations: atoms in solid solution, “forest” 
dislocations, grain boundaries and precipitates. In the system of equations [1.7], we 
will identify each contribution. 
1.4.2.1. 𝜎଴
Let us assume, often verified in steels, that atoms in solid solution are not the 
cause of isotropic and kinematic strain hardening. In this case, the solid solution 
hardening mainly participates in the increase of the yield strength. The quantity 𝜎଴
includes the contribution of the friction stress of the iron in the ferrite and the solid 
solution hardening. 
1.4.2.2. The average free paths Lj
The “forest” dislocations, grain boundaries and precipitates will provide a strong 
barrier to dislocation gliding (𝑗 = 1, 2, 3). The mean free path associated with the 
“forest” dislocations, if they are assumed to be homogeneously and randomly 
distributed, is simply written as 𝐿ଵ = ଵ
௞భඥఘ ; the one related to grain boundaries is 
written 𝐿ଶ = 𝐷, where D is the average ferritic grain size; the one related to Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 9

൰, where 𝑑௣
and 𝑓௩ correspond to the mean diameter and volume fraction of the precipitates, 𝑛௣
and 𝑛௣
଴ represent the number of dislocation loops around the precipitates and the 
saturation value of the number of dislocation loops (Fribourg 2010). 
1.4.2.3. Isotropic component σk and value of m 
Here, we consider that only the precipitates directly influence the isotropic 
component 𝜎௞ (𝑘 = 1). If the particles are considered to be randomly distributed 
obstacles, then: 
𝜎ଵ = 𝜎௣ = 𝑀𝜇𝑏
𝜆௣
[1.8] 
where 𝜆௣ is the average distance between precipitates. In the case of spherical 
precipitates, the average distance 𝜆௣ can be written as a function of the average 
diameter 𝑑௣ and the volume fraction 𝑓௣ of the precipitates as follows: 
𝜆௣ = 𝑑௣
2 ඨ2𝜋
3𝑓௣
[1.9] 
The value of 𝑚 in the stress additivity law 𝜎௙ and 𝜎௣ depends on the density and 
strength of the obstacles (in this case “forest” dislocations and precipitates) to 
dislocation movement, with values of 𝑚 generally between 1 and 2. In the presence 
of obstacles of equal strength and different densities, which will be assumed, 𝑚=2
(Cheng 2003), implying that precipitation hardening influences strain hardening in 
the plastic domain. 
1.4.2.4. Kinematic components 〈σb
l 〉
The origin of the internal stresses results, on the one hand, from the stacking of 
dislocations at the grain boundaries (see Appendix) and, on the other hand, from the 
formation of loops of dislocations around the precipitates. Two kinematic 
components (𝑙 = 1, 2) must therefore be taken into account: 
– The kinematic component that results from the stacking of dislocations at grain 
boundaries and is written in its simplest form (Sinclair 2006):
〈𝜎௕
ଵ〉 = 〈𝜎௕
௚〉 = 𝑀𝜇𝑏
𝐷 𝑛௚10 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
where 𝑛௚ is the number of dislocations stopped at grain boundaries along a given 
slip plane. It is expected that 𝑛௚ saturates as the plastic strain increases, because in a 
polycrystal there is a critical value of 𝑛௚ for which a total skimming by deviated slip 
occurs. This phenomenon occurs, for example, when dislocations of opposite signs 
arrive and are stored at the grain boundaries. It is then proposed to write 𝑛௚ in the 
following integrated form (Sinclair 2006): 
𝑛௚ = 𝑛௚
଴ ቆ1 − exp ( −𝜆
𝑏𝑛௚
଴ (𝜀 + 𝜀௦௞))ቇ
where 𝑛௚
଴ is the maximum number of dislocations stopped per geometrically 
necessary slip line, 𝜆 is the average spacing between slip lines intercepting the grain 
boundary, ఒ
௕
 can be seen as the number of dislocations per slip line geometrically 
required and 𝜀௦௞ is the strain at the skin pass. The process described here is not 
completely efficient, as only a portion of the dislocation line is likely to reach the 
grain boundary. One must therefore include in the storage term ଵ
௅మ
 a corrective term

௡೒
బ൰, which is related to the number of sites available for dislocations at grain 
boundaries (Sinclair 2006). 
– The kinematic component that results from the formation of loops of 
dislocations around the particles and which is written as (Proudhon 2008): 
〈𝜎௕
ଶ〉 = 〈𝜎௕
௣〉 = 𝑓௣𝐸௣𝑏
𝑀𝑑௣
𝜑𝑛௣
where 𝑛௣ represents the number of Orowan loops around the precipitate, 𝐸௣ is the 
elastic modulus of the precipitates and 𝜑 is an efficiency factor related to the 
stability of the dislocation loops. To account for stress relaxation phenomena around 
the precipitates, it is proposed to write that: 
𝑛௣ = 𝑛௣
଴ ቆ1 − exp (−𝑀𝑑௣
𝑏𝑛଴
௣ (𝜀 + 𝜀௦௞))ቇ
where 𝑛଴

 depends on the stress relaxation mechanism and corresponds to the 
saturation value of the number of Orowan loops around the precipitates. Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 11

1.4.3. Reference materials and data from the theoretical analysis 
The reference materials consist of three single-phase ferritic ultra-low carbon 
steels and one HSLA 360 steel. Their composition and microstructural 
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.1. The titanium in the very low carbon 
steels is added in particular to “trap” the interstitials (C, N) by forming titanium 
carbides in order to limit the aging phenomena and the formation of generally 
undesirable deformation heterogeneities (or Lüders bands). The HSLA 360 steel 
sustained a skin pass strain rate of 1.5% and has a relatively high-volume density of 
fine niobium carbide precipitates (Aouafi 2009).

1.4.4. Strain hardening and mechanical properties: effect of grain size 
The presence of precipitates generally induces a decrease in the ferritic grain 
size. In order to better understand the effects related to grain size only, we will first 
look at ferritic steels without precipitates, whose grain size varies between 3.5 µm 
and 20 µm (Table 1.1). In this particular case, equation [1.10] at the basis of the 
theoretical approach is simply written as:

The experimental data for the tensile curve and the evolution of the strain 
hardening rate as a function of (𝜎−𝜎଴) for different ferrite grain sizes are 
satisfactorily compared with the data from the theoretical approach (Figure 1.4). 
Due to the presence of a Lüders plateau in the experimental curves, only the 
stress levels outside the heterogeneous deformation zone will be considered. It 
appears that a decrease in grain size is accompanied by an increase in stress at 0.2% 
strain, an increase in maximum stress and a decrease in uniform strain. The stronger 
is strain hardening rate θ measured in the plastic domain, the smaller is the ferritic 
grain size. 
This effect can be attributed, on the one hand, to the isotropic component related 
to the storage of dislocations, as the smallest grains contribute more strongly to the 
increase in the average dislocation density and, on the other hand, to the back stress, 
which is all the greater as the grain size is small (Figure 1.5). Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 13

curves; (b) measured and calculated strain hardening rate evolutions. For

Figure 1.5. Evolution of back stress as a function of ferritic grain size. 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
It is interesting to note that the evolution of the theoretical strain hardening rate 
does not have a linear behavior with the increase in the applied stress (Figure 1.4b). 
It presents an almost parabolic evolution. However, the experimental points are 14 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
located in the quasi-linear part of θ and the slope ௗఏ
ௗఙ is steeper at smaller grain sizes. 
The dislocation annihilation process is therefore more active when the grain size is 
smaller. This results in a decrease in the uniform deformation, which is clearly 
visible on the evolution of the strain hardening coefficient n (Figure 1.6). To better 
understand the effect of the different contributions, we propose to plot the evolution 
of θ and n for a grain size of 3.5 µm by taking into account all the contributions and 
successively removing the kinematic contribution and the isotropic contribution 
linked to the storage of dislocations at the grain boundaries (Figure 1.7). In the 
absence of the kinematic and isotropic contributions, the strain hardening rate is 
relatively small and its evolution shows a linear behavior typical of a stage III strain 
hardening (Figure 1.7a). The slope ௗఏ
ௗఙ can be determined from the system [1.11] 
and is equal to ିெ௞మ
ଶ , that is, the decrease in the strain hardening rate is only related 
to the dislocation annihilation process. The low strain hardening rate does not allow 
access to high-strength levels, but the relatively small ௗఏ
ௗఙ slope allows large uniform 
strains to be achieved (Figure 1.7). 
Figure 1.6. Evolution of strain hardening rate n as a function of ferritic 
grain size. Solid circles indicate uniform deformation. For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
It can be estimated that this type of behavior prevails for ferritic grain sizes of 
the order of a few hundred microns, that is, when the isotropic contribution related 
to the storage of dislocations at the grain boundaries and the kinematic contribution Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 15 
are small compared to the isotropic contribution related to the interaction between 
the mobile and “forest” dislocations. 
The analysis of Figure 1.7 shows that the kinematic contribution is more 
important as the strain (or stress) increases. It also appears that the back stress 
allows to reach higher levels of strength and ductility, because it opposes the process 
of annihilation of dislocations. In the absence of precipitates and neglecting 
dislocation/dislocation interactions, a limited expansion to order 1 (𝜀 → 0, 𝑛௚ ≪

same ferrite grain size, the presence of precipitates increases the yield strength 𝜎௘, 
strength, strain hardening rate and decreases the uniform elongation. 
The direct effect of the presence of precipitates on strain hardening results from 
precipitation hardening that is not purely additive, storage of dislocation loops 
around precipitates, and, to a lesser extent, kinematic contribution. The quasi-linear

ferritic grain size at 3 μm. The main results are presented in Figure 1.9. The 
evolution of the uniform strain as a function of the maximum stress shows a similar 
pattern to that presented in Figure 1.3. From the analysis of the results, the following 
conclusions can be drawn: (i) the precipitation of nanoparticles in ferrite allows 
high-strength levels to be reached; (ii) the presence of particles increases the ratio ఙబ.మ

, mainly due to the effect of precipitation hardening on the yield strength at 0.2% 
which is not compensated by the increase in mechanical strength induced by the

1.4.5.3. Interphase precipitation hardening: strategy implemented 
At the industrial level, these steels were initially developed by JFE Steel 
Corporation under the trade name Nanohiten. The idea is to precipitate particles 
whose characteristic size is around the nanometer in order to maximize the 
mechanical strength and to ensure a better thermal stability of the particles. This 
steel is also silicon-free and can be hot-dip galvanized directly after hot rolling. It 
has been shown that these very high-strength steels also have remarkable trade-offs 
between ductility and hole expansion (Seto 2007). From a microstructural point of 
view, Nanohiten 780 steel has an average ferritic grain size between 3 µm and 5 µm 
and a high-volume density of very fine (Ti0.54Mo0.46) C type precipitates whose 
average size is around 3–4 nm (Seto 2007; Sun 2013). Although experimental 
measurements show that interphase precipitation of very fine particles leads to 
relatively good ductilities, the origin of such a phenomenon is not clearly established 
(Kamikawa 2015). The approach proposed in this chapter provides some insights, 
especially with respect to the effect of particle size. The phenomena of interphase 
precipitation and ferrite formation from austenite by a so-called ledge mechanism 
are strongly coupled (Chen 2014). The conditions of ferrite formation (nucleation 
rate and velocity of the ferrite/austenite interface) influence the precipitation state 
and vice versa. It is interesting to note that interphase precipitation favors the 
formation of small particles. This is because, on the one hand, the precipitation 
driving forces are larger due to the establishment of a compositional gradient ahead

of the transformation front and, on the other hand, the average particle size can be 
reduced under conditions for which the velocity of the ferrite/austenite interface is 
slower (Chen 2014). We therefore propose to study the effect of particle size on the 
strength/ductility trade-off. To do so, we determined (Figure 1.10) the evolution of 
𝜀௨ = 𝑓(𝜎௠) for different precipitate sizes (from 4 to 18 nm every 2 nm) and for 
different average distances between particles (from 80 to 400 nm). The ferritic grain 
size considered is 3 µm. The points connected by solid lines are located on average 
iso-distances between particles (and thus on iso-elastic limit) and the points 
connected by dashed lines are located on average particle iso-sizes (for clarity, we 
have represented only those relative to 4 nm and 18 nm). We move on the iso-lines 
by varying the particle volume fraction in accordance with the relationship [1.9]. 
Figure 1.10. Effects of particle size 𝑑௣ of interparticle distance 𝜆 on the 
evolution of uniform strain and maximum stress. For a color version 
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
The evolutions (Figure 1.10) highlight the important role that particle size plays 
on the uniform elongation/strength trade-off. At an average iso-distance between 
particles, and thus at the iso-elastic limit, any increase in particle size results in a 
more pronounced increase in mechanical strength and a decrease in ductility, and in 
better 𝜎௠/𝜀௨ trade-offs. This is related to a higher strain hardening rate at the 
beginning and lower at the end of the plastic deformation when the particle size 
increases. 
This behavior results from the effect of particle size on the competition between 
back stress and storage of dislocation loops around precipitates. The size, more than 
the arrangement of the particles, thus controls the mechanical strength and the 
trade-off between mechanical strength and uniform elongation.

1.5. Strain hardening and mechanical behavior of martensitic steels 
1.5.1. Multiscale structure and mechanical properties 
A quenched martensitic steel is composed mainly of fresh martensite. It has a 
multi-scale structure illustrated in Figure 1.11 and characterized by the prior 
austenitic grain boundaries, lath block packets, martensite laths separated by low 
misorientation boundaries and nanoscale carbon redistribution on martensite defects 
(e.g. dislocations, lath boundaries).

boundaries observed in TEM; (d) 3D atomic probe reconstruction of carbon 
redistribution on structural defects. For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co. 
uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Martensitic steels have very high strength, combined with good fatigue and wear 
properties. Yield strength and strength can reach exceptionally high levels while 
uniform elongations are relatively low (Figure 1.12). The addition of hardening 
elements, such as boron and molybdenum, is often necessary to overcome the 
presence of ferrite and/or bainite. Martensitic steels are used in fields as varied as 
aeronautics (landing gear and turbine blades), machine tools (tipping buckets), 
cutting tools and the automotive industry (anti-intrusion parts). They are generally 
produced by austenitization followed by rapid cooling and can be shaped by hot 
stamping. Ductile martensitic steels generally contain carbon contents of less than 
0.4% C and are composed primarily of martensite laths. 20 New Advanced High Strength Steels

1.5.2. Tensile properties and strain hardening 
The materials studied consist of five quenched martensitic steels (Allain 2018). 
Their composition as well as the lattice friction stress associated with iron and 
alloying elements are given in Table 1.3. The friction stress is evaluated from the 
following relationship, which takes into account the mass fraction of alloying 
elements (Allain 2018):

(b) evolution of strain hardening rate as a function of applied stress; (c) determination

newsteels.zip 
The tensile curves as well as the evolution of the strain hardening rates as a 
function of the applied stress, given in Figure 1.13, highlight a ductile behavior. The 
evolution of the strain hardening rate can be decomposed into three distinct parts 
(Badinier 2008): an elastic regime during which θ is almost constant (regime 1), 
followed by a quasi-linear decrease of θ with the applied stress (regime 2), and 
finally, from a relatively high stress level close to 𝑌𝑆଴.ଶ (indicated by the solid 
circles in Figure 1.13b), a more nuanced decrease in θ is observed (regime 3). The 
initial strain hardening rate is extremely high, greater the higher the carbon content, 
and well above the maximum strain hardening rate expected in cubic metals whose 22 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
strain hardening is dominated by dislocation storage. Indeed, the latter is around 𝜃 ≈
ா
ହ଴
≈ 4000 MPa. It can be seen in Figure 1.13b that this strain hardening rate is only 
reached in the third strain hardening regime for stress levels above 𝑌𝑆଴.ଶ. 
Furthermore, the slope of the strain hardening rate in regimes 2 and 3 is lower the 
higher the carbon concentration of the steel. This partly explains why higher 
uniform strain can be obtained for higher carbon content (Figure 1.13c). 
Surprisingly, the microplasticity stress is relatively low (around 400–500 MPa) and 
hardly depends on the carbon content (vertical arrow in Figure 1.13b). The yield 
strength of martensitic steels is therefore low compared to their maximum strength. 
1.5.3. Effect of carbon on changes in YS0.2 and UTS 
To describe the strain hardening of quenched martensitic steels, the approach of 
equating martensite with very fine-grained ferrite and using a Mecking–Kocks type 
approach is not convincing due to (i) an extremely high level of strain hardening and 
the linear evolution of the strain hardening rate in regime 2 and (ii) the lack of 
knowledge of the scale length that controls strain hardening, internal stresses and the 
strong Bauschinger effect observed in martensitic steels (Allain 2018). However, it 
is interesting to note (Figure 1.14) that YS0.2 and UTS depend, over a wide range of 
composition, on the square root of the carbon content in the martensite. 
Figure 1.14. Evolution of YS0.2 and UTS as a function of the square 
root of the carbon content in martensite for low alloyed steels. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Although the observed evolutions (Figure 1.14) suggest that carbon plays a 
central role in the mechanical behavior of martensite, it is difficult to explain them, 
as the strain hardening mechanisms in martensite still remain poorly understood.

1.6. Austenitic steels Fe-0.6C-22Mn with TWIP effect 
1.6.1. Introductory remarks 
High manganese “Hadfield steels”, discovered in 1882, can be considered as the 
first generation of twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels. Because of their 
exceptional levels of strength and ductility combined with very high toughness and 
excellent wear resistance, they were used for forging parts, including machine tools, 
rails and railroad switches. At the end of the 1970s, Remy observed the 
accumulation of dislocations at the twin boundaries and hypothesized that twins 
constitute, like grain boundaries, an obstacle to the gliding of dislocations (Remy 
1977). The behavior of TWIP steels would therefore be explained by their 
propensity to activate twinning. The application of these grades to flat products is 
very recent due to the fact that it was necessary to determine compositions that 
induce intense twinning at room temperature (Bouaziz 2011). In this chapter, we 
will focus on the TWIP Fe-22Mn-0.6C grade. Due to its composition, it is austenitic 
at room temperature, exhibits an optimized TWIP effect, and avoids ε martensite 
formation during deformation (Figure 1.15).

from Allain 2004); (b) austenitic grain structure and evidence of twins in austenite 
(re-adapted from Barbier 2018). For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co. 
uk/goune/newsteels.zip 24 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
1.6.2. Role of twins and nature of strain hardening 
The mechanical properties of high manganese austenitic steels result from the 
competition between different plasticity mechanisms whose activation depends on 
the value of the SFE Γ. From a crystallographic point of view, this energy per unit 
area corresponds to that of the defect associated with the dissociation of perfect 
dislocations in dense {111} type planes into gliding Schokley partials. The creation 
of this defect is energetically unfavorable and limits the dissociation of dislocations. 
From a thermodynamic point of view, the SFE Γ can be evaluated by considering 
that it corresponds to the free energy required for the formation of a ε martensite 
platelet of thickness two atomic planes, twinning and ε martensitic transformation 
being very close processes that can be associated (Allain 2004). This approach, 
although qualitative because it hides the kinetic processes of twins nucleation (or 
ε−martensite), allows the link between chemical composition, temperature and SFE 
to be described in a two-dimensional diagram. 
For the design of a TWIP alloy, it is necessary to add the composition and 
temperature conditions for the formation of thermal and athermal ε-martensite. An 
example is shown in Figure 1.16. At room temperature, the Fe-0.6C-22Mn alloy has 
a low SFE (≈ 20 mJ/mଶ). It is therefore deformed by competition between 
dislocation gliding and mechanical twinning. The mechanical twins appear as fine 
platelets of about 10 nm, structured in a complex way and whose volume fraction 
increases with the deformation. They constitute, as well as the grain boundaries, 
strong obstacles to the gliding of dislocations. The occurrence of other strain 
hardening mechanisms such as pseudo-twinning and/or dynamic aging (dynamic 
interaction between dislocation gliding and solute atoms) has been considered in the 
literature and is still the subject of much debate (Bouaziz 2011). However, their 
contributions to hardening would be limited and twinning would be the predominant 
deformation mechanism at the origin of the plastic behavior of TWIP steels. 
To describe the behavior of Fe-0.6C-22Mn steel, we can use the Mecking–Kocks 
approach, developed for ferritic structures with, however, an important nuance: the 
mean free path of dislocations decreases during the deformation due to the activation 
of new twins. Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 25

1.6.3. Strain hardening and mechanical behavior of Fe-0.6C-22Mn steel 
If we make an analogy with the behavior of single-phase ferritic steels (equation 
[1.11]), the flow stress of austenitic Fe-0.6C-22Mn steels is written as (Bouaziz 
2008):

where D is the austenitic grain size and T is the inter-twins spacing. The latter is 
expected to decrease during deformation due to the appearance of new twins. To

where 𝜀௜௡௜௧ is the critical strain value at which twins form, 𝐹଴, 𝛽 and 𝑝 are constants

Moreover, Bauschinger tests show that strain hardening is not only isotropic

Table 1.4. Data used in the theoretical approach 
The experimental data for the tensile curve and the evolution of the strain 
hardening rate as a function of the applied stress for an austenitic grain size of 3 µm 
are satisfactorily compared with the data from the theoretical approach (Figure 1.17). 
The results obtained highlight a low-yield strength, a uniform elongation (~50%) 
and a high mechanical strength (~1600 MPa true stress). The evolution of the strain 
hardening rate is mainly related to the activation of the twinning, as shown by the 
evolution of the instantaneous strain hardening rate as a function of the applied 
stress. It is typical of CFC steels with low SFE and characterizes the twinning 
activity. The initial drop in the strain hardening rate linked to dynamic recovery and 
corresponding to strain hardening stage III is followed, from a strain level of about Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 27 
0.1, by a stage linked to the activation of primary twins and during which the strain 
hardening rate increases by a dynamic Hall-Petch effect. The difficulty to produce 
deformation twins when the deformation increases explains the decrease in the strain 
hardening rate observed for deformation rates of the order of 0.3. This process also 
affects the kinematic contribution, which represents an important part of the strain 
hardening of Fe-0.6C-22Mn steel. Indeed, for an austenitic grain size of 3 µm, the 
theoretical approach gives kinematic contributions of 161, 270 and 580 MPa for 
strain rates of 5.5%, 11% and 20%, values in good agreement with those measured 
(Bouaziz 2008).

and the experimental data are compared to the theoretical ones. For a color version 
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
1.6.4. Evolution of the yield strength 
The low-yield strength of TWIP steels limits their application in anti-intrusion 
assemblies. To increase the yield strength of TWIP steel, the first strategy is to 
decrease the grain size by acting on the cold thermo-mechanical processes. The 
yield strength of TWIP Fe-0.6C-22Mn steel can be approximated by a Hall-Petch 
type relationship (Bouaziz 2011): 
𝑌𝑆 = 𝜎଴ +
𝑘௬
√𝑑
where 𝜎଴, equal to 132 MPa, is the solid solution hardening in austenite, 𝑘௬ is a 
dimensional constant equal to 449 MPa·µm1/2 and d is the austenitic grain size in 
µm. By conventional thermo-mechanical processes, the highest yield strength that 
can be obtained is of the order of 450 MPa, as it is difficult, if not impossible, to 28 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
obtain grain sizes below 2.5 µm. To reach the required yield strength for anti￾intrusion applications (in the range of 600–700 MPa), other complementary routes 
must be considered such as (i) pre-strain with and without partial recrystallization of 
the austenite and (ii) precipitation of carbides of alloying elements in the austenite. 
The main difficulty lies in increasing the yield strength without adversely affecting 
formability. As such, precipitation offers an interesting alternative, as it affects the 
strain hardening rate less in the plastic range (Bouaziz 2011).
1.7. Multiphase quenching and partitioning steels 
1.7.1. From dual-phase, TRIP to quenching and partitioning steels 
Dual-phase (DP) steels are the first generation of advanced high-strength steels 
for the automotive industry. They consist of a soft phase, ferrite, and a hard phase, 
martensite. They are obtained by a heat treatment that allows the transformation of 
austenite into martensite from a two-phase ferrite/austenite structure (Figure 1.18a). 
Apart from carbon, the main alloying element is manganese, which ranges from 
0.5 to 2.5 wt%. The tensile curve of DP steels is mainly characterized by (i) the 
absence of a Lüders plateau due to mobile dislocations generated at the 
ferrite/martensite interface and internal stresses; (ii) a low-yield strength controlled 
by the mechanical behavior of ferrite, which plasticizes for lower stress levels than 
martensite; and (iii) a high initial strain hardening rate, the origin of which comes 
from the composite nature of DP steels (Schmitt 2018; Allain 2020). The difference 
in mechanical behavior between ferrite and martensite is the basis of deformation 
incompatibilities between the phases. The resulting deformation gradients, generally 
localized in the ferrite, are revealed by the presence of geometrically necessary 
dislocations around the martensite islands. The strain hardening of DP steels is 
therefore sensitive to the kinematic contribution whose origin comes from the GND 
dislocation-induced back stress, the martensite volume fraction and the phase size 
effect (Allain 2015); (iv) a low ோ೐
ோ೘
 ratio, generally between 0.5 and 0.6. To optimize 
the mechanical strength/ductility pairing, the next step was to develop so-called 
TRIP steels (for Transformation Induced Plasticity). They comprise, at room 
temperature, a ferritic matrix in which a certain proportion of residual austenite is 
dispersed (around 10–15% for a TRIP 800 steel), stabilized by a high carbon content 
(>1% wt) in the austenite islands. This local enrichment results from the bainitic 
transformation that takes place during a holding temperature around 400–500°C, and 
from the presence of silicon and/or aluminum, which are known to delay the 
precipitation of carbides in the austenite (Figure 1.18b). Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 29

steels. Micrographs associated with the structures: (a) dual phase; (b) TRIP. 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
The TRIP effect can be seen as a “dynamic composite effect” and corresponds to 
the progressive transformation of austenite into martensite during deformation. As a 
result, and contrary to DP steels, the strain hardening does not saturate at high strain 
levels and leads to better strength/uniform strain trade-offs (Figure 1.19a). 
Moreover, the martensitic transformation induced by the deformation results in a 
gradual and marked increase in the strain hardening coefficient n, typical of the 
TRIP effect (Figure 1.19b).

in mechanical properties between first generation steels, such as DP and TRIP steels, 
and second-generation steels, such as TWIP steels. The idea behind the development 
of Q&P steels is to replace the ferrite and bainite of TRIP steels by a harder phase, 
martensite, while benefiting from the TRIP effect provided by the presence of 
residual austenite. 
They are made from an innovative thermo-mechanical treatment originally 
proposed by Speer (2003). It consists of a quenching to a temperature Tq, below the 
martensitic transformation starting temperature Ms, then a reheating and holding at a 
partitioning temperature Tp (Figure 1.20). The latter is called “partitioning”, because 
the carbon initially present in the martensite diffuses toward the austenite under the 
effect of the chemical potential gradient. This results in a carbon enrichment in the 
austenite that contributes to its stability at room temperature.

The desired microstructural evolutions as well as the critical temperatures Tp 
and Tq are represented. For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/ 
newsteels.zip Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 31 
The exceptional mechanical properties of Q&P steels are due to their fine duplex 
microstructure: very fine islands of residual austenite stable at room temperature 
embedded in a tempered and/or fresh martensitic matrix. The presence of bainite is 
often highlighted, because its nucleation is favored by the presence of martensite 
(Figure 1.21).

1.7.2. Phenomenological approaches to the mechanical behavior of 
multiphase steels 
Phenomenological approaches have been developed to account for the 
mechanical behavior of multiphase steels. They are based on the principle that each 
phase behaves mechanically in a homogeneous way. The difficulty inherent to these 
approaches is the determination of the stress and strain states in each phase. There

are several formulations, but we will base our analysis on the one that relies on the 
fact that the average strain and stress are different in the phases, and on the iso-work 
principle (Bouaziz 2002). The latter imposes that the work increment is the same in 
each phase (𝜎ଵ𝑑𝜀ଵ = 𝜎ଶ𝑑𝜀ଶ in equation [1.13]). In this framework, if we consider a 
material consisting of two phases 1 and 2 of volume fraction 𝑓ଵ and 𝑓ଶ, the stress 𝜎
and the strain 𝜀 in the two-phase material are obtained by solving the following 
system: 
ቐ
𝜎(𝜀) = 𝑓ଵ𝜎ଵ(𝜀ଵ) + (1 − 𝑓ଵ)𝜎ଶ(𝜀ଶ)
𝜀 = 𝑓ଵ𝜀ଵ + (1 − 𝑓ଵ)𝜀ଶ
𝜎ଵ𝑑𝜀ଵ = 𝜎ଶ𝑑𝜀ଶ

version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
The graphical variation of this system of equations allows, for example, to 
understand the macroscopic behavior of a DP steel in three deformation domains:

martensite continues to deform elastically while ferrite plasticizes, and the last in

which ferrite and martensite deform plastically (Figure 1.22). The dashed line 
characterizes the mixing law on stress and strain and its slope is the iso-work 
condition. Even if this type of approach requires knowledge and/or determination of 
the individual phase behavior, it allows the prediction of the mechanical behavior of 
DP and TRIP steels with ferritic matrix and that of multiphase steels containing 
more than two phases including bainite (Perlade 2003). However, in the case of 
TRIP steels, it is necessary to introduce martensitic transformation kinetics during 
deformation. 
1.7.3. Mechanical properties and strain hardening of Q&P steels 
The mechanical behavior of Q&P steels depends primarily on the stability of the 
retained austenite. The latter is influenced by the austenite topology, morphology, 
fraction and carbon composition at the end of the holding stage (Calderon 2015). If 
the austenite is not very stable, the TRIP effect is ineffective or even non-existent, 
and it is then expected that the strain hardening of a Q&P steel will rather approach 
that of a DP steel (Arlazarov 2013a, 2013b; Seo 2016).The temperatures Tq and Tp as 
well as the holding time at Tp are the process parameters that influence the strain 
hardening and the mechanical properties of Q&P steels. Their choice is therefore 
essential. In the following, we will focus on the behavior of a Q&P steel with a 
composition (%) of 0.3C-2.5Mn-1.5Si. 
1.7.3.1. Choice of temperatures Tq and Tp 
The amount of carbon transferred from martensite to austenite during the 
partitioning step depends on the martensite fraction at Tq. The latter can be 
determined by the phenomenological equation of Koïstinen–Marburger: 
𝑓ఈᇱ
்೜ = 1 − exp (−𝛼௠൫𝑀௦ − 𝑇௤൯) [1.14] 
For Q&P steels, the following evolutions of 𝑀௦ and 𝛼௠ as a function of alloying

 [1.15] 
The optimum temperature 𝑇௤, that is, the one that allows the highest fraction of 
residual austenite to be stabilized at room temperature, can be determined from the 
following procedure: (i) the fraction of primary martensite at 𝑇௤ is calculated from 34 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
equations [1.14] and [1.15]; (ii) the fraction of primary austenite and its carbon 
composition are determined by subtraction, assuming that the carbon partitions 
completely between martensite and austenite at 𝑇௣; (iii) equations [1.14] and [1.15] 
to determine the fraction of fresh martensite that forms from the primary austenite 
upon final cooling; and (iv) the fraction of retained austenite at room temperature is 
determined by subtracting the primary austenite and fresh martensite. 
This procedure applied to the 0.3C-2.5Mn-1.5Si steel gives the evolutions 
(Figure 1.23). The maximum fraction of retained austenite defines the optimal value 
of 𝑇௤, that is, 220°C for the reference steel. This temperature is however purely 
qualitative, because it is based on two strong assumptions: there is no precipitation 
of carbides in the martensite during the carbon partition and no bainitic 
transformation. This approach nevertheless allows us to have an estimate of the 
temperature range to consider for 𝑇௤. It can be seen that a decrease in 𝑇௤ allows for a 
higher martensite fraction and thus a larger available carbon to enrich the austenite. 
The choice of 𝑇௣ is mainly based on kinetic criteria of carbon enrichment of the 
austenite. Generally, it is observed that an increase in 𝑇௣ makes it possible to reach 
the austenite carbon enrichment peak for a shorter time due to a higher diffusivity of 
carbon in the martensite and austenite. However, care must be taken not to increase 
𝑇௣, too much, as a decrease in the fraction of retained austenite and its composition 
can be observed due to exacerbated carbide precipitation kinetics in the martensite. 
Generally, 𝑇௣ temperatures between 400 and 450°C are required.

1.7.3.2. Effect of temperature Tq on mechanical properties 
Three temperatures Tq (200, 230 and 260°C) around the optimal temperature of 
220°C were chosen. The partition temperature 𝑇௣ was set at 400°C and the holding 
time at 𝑇௣ was 200 s. The microstructural states obtained correspond to those given 
in Figure 1.21. The microstructure is composed of fresh martensite, tempered 
martensite, bainite and retained austenite. The relative proportion of these phases 
depends on Tq while the carbon composition is, with the exception of experimental 
errors, identical (Table 1.5).

Unlike DP and TRIP ferritic matrix steels, Q&P steel has high yield strengths 
and ௒ௌ
௎்ௌ ratios. The lower the temperature Tq, the higher the yield strength and the 
higher the mechanical strength. This can be related to the evolution of the tempered 
martensite fraction as a function of Tq. In all cases, Q&P steel has very good 
compromises between high strength and ductility levels. The presence of a strong 
TRIP effect, highlighted by the typical evolution of the strain hardening coefficient 
n, could explain the ductility levels reached. On the other hand, the strain hardening 
rate in the plastic domain, obtained from the tensile curves (Figure 1.24a), is not 
very sensitive to Tq despite the observed microstructural differences. It is as if the 
tensile curves are translated to higher stress levels as Tq decreases. 
1.7.3.3. Hardening behavior: comparison with an equivalent TRIP steel 
To understand the strain hardening of Q&P steel, it is necessary to compare its 
behavior to that of a TRIP steel with a ferritic matrix. To do this, we propose to 
conduct a “numerical experiment”. We consider a TRIP steel called “equivalent”, 
that is, of the same composition and whose metallurgical parameters are identical to 
those of the Q&P steel, except for the fact that the matrix is ferritic. The ferritic 
grain size is obtained from the size of the martensite islands by the following 
geometrical relation: 
𝑑ఈ = 𝑑ఈᇲ
𝑓ఈ
ଵ
ଷ

ଷ
The characteristics of the TRIP steel equivalent to the Q&P steel for 𝑇௤ = 260°C
are given in Table 1.6. All else being equal, it is important to note that considering 
ferrite instead of tempered martensite introduces a distortion in the carbon mass 
balance, which can be resolved by considering that the equivalent TRIP steel 
contains a carbon content lower than 0.3% C. 
The second step consists of using a model to predict the mechanical properties of 
TRIP steels with ferritic matrix and to compare the mechanical properties obtained 
with those of the Q&P steel. We chose the model developed in (Perlade 2003), 
which allows us to take into account the presence of bainite and fresh martensite. 
The results obtained are summarized in Figure 1.25. We have also represented the 
properties of a TRIP steel whose ferrite would have a much higher yield strength 
(noted TRIP_eq_HLE). In order to reproduce the experimental data, we therefore 
considered an additional and additive hardening of 525 MPa in the ferrite. Strain Hardening and Tensile Properties 37

Table 1.6. Metallurgical characteristics of the equivalent TRIP steel for Tq = 260°C 
The tensile curve of TRIP_eq_HLE is therefore a simple translation of the curve 
of TRIP_eq_Tq_260 to higher stress levels. TRIP_eq_HLE has the same strain 
hardening rate as TRIP_eq_Tq_260, a higher yield strength and a lower elongation 
because the Considère criterion is verified for a smaller strain. It is interesting to 
note that the modeled behavior of TRIP_eq_HLE steel perfectly reproduces the 
tensile curve and the strain hardening coefficient n of Q&P steel. We can therefore 
deduce that the tempered martensite, as a matrix of Q&P steels, has little or no 
influence on the strain hardening in the plastic domain, the latter being mainly 
imposed by the TRIP effect, as shown by the evolution of n. The hardening of the 
tempered martensite, which can therefore be considered as purely additive, is very 
important (of the order of 1000 MPa for Tq = 260°C). It would result, in descending 
order, from hardening by the obstacles constituted by the martensite lath boundaries, 
hardening by carbide precipitation, and by solid solution (Soler 2019). Finally, 
Figure 1.25b shows that the average strain hardening coefficient of Q&P steel is 
lower than that of ferritic matrix TRIP steel. This is shown to be attributable to the 
higher yield strength of the tempered martensite than that of the ferrite. 
Calculations conducted for QP_ Tq_200 and QP_ Tq_230 steels with the 
microstructural parameters in Table 1.5 corroborate the conclusions already drawn 
and provide additional clarification. The presence of bainite, in small amounts and 
much softer than the tempered martensite, does not significantly affect the yield 
strength or strain hardening of the Q&P steel. The increase in yield strength as Tq 
decreases is related to the fraction of tempered martensite. The carbon content of the 
residual austenite is the first-order parameter that controls strain hardening in the 
plastic domain, which is the main reason why the strain hardening of Q&P steel 
does not depend significantly on Tq. 38 New Advanced High Strength Steels

1.8. Conclusion 
In this chapter, we have studied the link between the microstructural state, strain 
hardening and tensile properties of high-strength steels mainly dedicated to the 
automotive sector. In micro-alloyed ferritic steels, the effect of microstructural 
parameters (grain size and precipitates) on strain hardening and tensile properties 
can be understood by a simple Mecking–Kocks–Estrin type model. It is then 
necessary to take into account the isotropic and kinematic components of the strain 
hardening. It is shown that interphase precipitation favors the formation of small 
particles and allows to obtain higher levels of ductility. 
Martensitic steels have high mechanical strengths and an initial strain hardening 
rate that is significantly higher than the maximum strain hardening rate expected in 
cubic metals whose strain hardening is dominated by dislocation storage. Moreover, 
the micro-plasticity stress is relatively low compared to the mechanical strength and 
does not depend significantly on the carbon content. The strain hardening of these 
steels clearly cannot be described by a simple approach and still requires further 
study. 
In the TWIP Fe-22Mn-0.6C steel, the evolution of the strain hardening is mainly 
related to the activation of the twinning. To describe its behavior, we can use the 
Mecking–Kocks–Estrin approach developed for ferritic structures, taking into 
account that the mean free path of dislocations decreases during the deformation due

to the appearance of new twins. It is important to note that the kinematic 
contribution represents an important part of the strain hardening of TWIP steels. 
Finally, in Q&P steels, there are no simple models to describe their strain 
hardening. By comparison with an equivalent TRIP steel, the following conclusions 
can be drawn: (i) the strain hardening in the plastic domain is mainly imposed by the 
TRIP effect and more particularly by the carbon content of the retained austenite; 
(ii) the hardening of the tempered martensite is important and can be considered as 
additive; (iii) the bainite, present in small quantities and much softer than the 
tempered martensite, does not significantly affect the yield strength nor the strain 
hardening of Q&P steels.

This chapter deals with the anisotropy of mechanical properties, that is, the fact 
that they are dependent on the direction of loading. This means, for example, that 
different values of strength or elongation can be measured in an anisotropic sheet 
depending on whether it is loaded in tension in a direction parallel to the rolling 
direction (RD) or at 90° to it. Anisotropy can be a desired quality when the forming 
modes are themselves anisotropic, as in the case of deep drawing with swaging, 
where it is desired to limit the thinning of the sheet while deep drawing it. For 
ductile alloys, the anisotropy depends mainly on the crystallographic textures. A 
polycrystalline material is said to have a texture when its grains are preferentially 
oriented in one or more identical orientations. Thus, a sheet whose grains are 
randomly oriented is said to be “isotropic”, while a sheet whose statistically large 
number of grains has, for example, a direction parallel to the RD (a fiber-type 
texture α) may have anisotropic properties. Some mechanical properties are indeed 
sensitive to the crystallographic direction of stress. For example, for an iron single 
crystal loaded in tension along the <100> direction, we will find a Young’s modulus 
of about 120 GPa, and about 280 GPa if loading takes place along the <111> 
direction. It is then understandable that, for a polycrystal, the presence of a texture, 
that is, a large number of identically oriented grains, can induce a global anisotropy 
of the mechanical properties. 44 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
This chapter is structured in three parts. In the first part (section 2.1), we briefly 
introduce the problem of measuring, understanding and modeling textures in steels 
with multiple phases and various morphologies. As there are very little data in the 
literature on the anisotropy of third-generation high-strength steels (see Appendix), 
we have deliberately chosen to gather in this chapter only the didactic elements that 
we think are useful for the understanding and the analysis of the textures of these 
steels. This is the purpose of the second part (section 2.2), which represents the main 
part of this chapter, and where the anisotropy of the mechanical properties (Young’s 
modulus, Lankford’s coefficient and plasticity surface) for the orientations typically 
found in ferrite or austenite, whether deformed or recrystallized, as well as in their 
phase transformation products, are presented in the form of tables. For these phase 
transformation products, we will insist on some precautions to take when measuring 
the textures. We will conclude in the third part (section 2.3). Section 2.4 contains the 
description of the present calculations. 
2.1. Challenges 
Modern steels are characterized by the presence of multiple phases whose origin 
varies according to the thermomechanical treatment that gave rise to them, whether 
they are derived from a parent phase in a deformed or recrystallized state, by 
quenching or slow cooling. If there are little data in the literature on the crystalline 
anisotropy of third-generation steels, it is partly because the measurement of their 
textures is complex and recent. 
2.1.1. The problem of textures in modern steels 
Historically, the link between textures and anisotropy of mechanical properties was 
made on single-phase, essentially ferritic steels (Meyzaud and Parniere 1977; 
Hutchinson 1999). The way the textures were measured, by X-ray diffraction in 
goniometers, did not allow phases of close structures to be distinguished, such as 
ferrite and martensite, or the texture of minority phases to be evaluated, such as 
residual austenite. The measurement of textures in multiphase steels became really 
possible only after the development of electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) in 
scanning electron microscopes in the early 2000s (Wilson and Spanos 2001). This 
technique led to knowing not only the orientations of each of the phases present but 
also their volume fraction, their morphology and their distribution in space. 
Nevertheless, it took another decade for high-speed cameras, as well as automatic 
indexing software for Kikuchi diagrams, to allow a statistically valid measurement of 
these multiphase steel textures (Cabus et al. 2014). This explains why the literature on 
this topic is recent (e.g. Jirkova and Kucerova 2016; Neves Moura et al. 2020). Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 45 
Furthermore, assuming the textures are correctly measured, the link between 
them and the observed anisotropy is not easy to establish (Nesterova et al. 2015). Of 
the homogenization models used to establish this (Kocks et al. 1998), the Taylor 
model (used later to treat single-phase textures) is no longer suitable for calculating 
the mechanical properties that would theoretically arise from these multiphase 
textures. Self-consistent models, theoretically better adapted, require however many 
approximations on the distribution, the morphology and the properties of each 
phase. Finite element models remain, which could be based on the two-dimensional 
measurement of the textures obtained by EBSD, but these calculations are long and, 
here again, an expertise in the mastery of these models is required in addition to the 
knowledge of the properties of each phase1
. 
Finally, assuming that we manage to measure these textures and to evaluate their 
link with anisotropy, if we want to optimize them in order to obtain adequate 
properties for the desired forming, we still need to be able to physically model their 
origin according to the elaboration process. However, in these steels, the 
understanding comes up against the almost total disappearance of the generating 
phases of the current microstructure. In situ measurements in SEM equipped with 
heating platforms that would enable following at least the phase transformations are 
in their infancy, because of the high temperature of the transformation points in 
steels and the sensitivity of EBSD cameras to these temperatures. Currently, this 
linkage is only possible a posteriori when fragments of the parent phase remain in 
the final microstructure, for example through reconstruction of the original phase 
from its residues (Cabus et al. 2007, 2014; Lubin et al. 2011).
2.1.2. The problem of phase transformation textures 
For the above-mentioned reasons, it is understandable that the textures resulting 
from phase transformation have been relatively little studied, even in single-phase 
steels. They have been of some interest when the processes of hot plate production 
1 The three types of models mentioned are associated with increasing implementation 
complexity. The Taylor model considers that all grains deform in the same way as the 
polycrystal. This simple model, which only takes into account the anisotropy via the 
crystallographic texture, is still useful, as it represents an upper bound for the mechanical 
behavior. With self-consistent models, mechanical interactions between a grain and the 
surrounding polycrystals are taken into account, resulting in different deformation modes 
depending on the crystal orientation and anisotropy of the crystal structures present. For FE 
approaches, the interactions between a grain and the neighboring grains are also taken into 
account; the deformation of each grain then depends on its orientation and crystal structure, but 
also on its location in the polycrystal (Kocks et al. 1998). 46 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
were refined and enabled products from deformed austenite to be obtained 
(essentially in order to decrease the grain size). The textures incidentally obtained in 
the ferrite made it possible to reinforce those that would develop during cold rolling 
and, subsequently, during recrystallization. However, this interest was limited, 
because the induced reinforcement was much less than that which could be obtained 
with greater ease by optimizing cold deformation and annealing.
The issue of phase transformation textures is back on the agenda with modern 
steels, since these are the textures that are found in the finished product. As 
mentioned earlier, it raises the question of the origin of the final phase. What was 
the orientation of the austenite that turned into ferrite or martensite? Was it in a 
deformed or partially recrystallized state? Assuming the characteristics of the parent 
phase are known, for example, from its residues, it is possible to get an idea of its 
transformation products based on the relatively well-established epitaxial 
relationships between ferritic and austenitic phases (so-called Bain, Kurdjumov–
Sachs, Nishiyama–Wasserman, etc.). However, the question arises as to whether all 
the variants predicted as a function of the crystal symmetry of these phases (3, 12 or 
24 equivalent variants) will actually be present (see section 2.2.3). But this does not 
seem to be the case. A phenomenon of “selection of variants” seems to operate, at 
least when there are residual constraints that control the nucleation or growth of 
certain variants. 
An additional difficulty is that of measuring, on a surface section, phases that 
often have a lath or needle-like morphology (Gourgues-Lorenzon 2009). Does the 
phase fraction measured in 2D really correspond to that present in the volume? A 
selection of variants that would only be apparent is conceivable and this point will 
be developed at the end of the following section. Let us now turn to the heart of this 
chapter, concerning the link between crystallographic textures and mechanical 
anisotropy. 
2.2. Textural anisotropy and mechanical properties 
Theoretical values of Young’s modulus (E), Lankford’s coefficient (R) and yield 
strength (𝜎) for a highly textured steel sheet that would be loaded in tension in the 
plane of the sheet and along a direction that makes an angle α with the RD are given 
in this section. The directional Young’s modulus E(α) measures the elastic stiffness 
of the sample. Unlike aluminum, it is, for steel, very dependent on the 
crystallographic direction of stress. The details of its calculation are reported in 
section 2.4.1. The Lankford coefficient R(α) characterizes more precisely the 
deformation anisotropy of a sheet loaded in tension and is in general much more 
dependent on the texture than the associated yield strength σ(α). The details of its Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 47 
calculation are reported in section 2.4.2. The yield surfaces of the material, which 
give information on the mechanical response associated with a given stress, also 
depend on the crystallographic textures and yield strengths of each of the phases 
present. The calculation details are reported in section 2.4.3.
We first present the mechanical characteristics obtained for orientations that are 
typical of those found in ferrite (section 2.2.1), then of those typically found in 
austenite (section 2.2.2). The last part (section 2.2.3) is a development of what can 
theoretically be obtained by phase transformation from these orientations. Most of 
the orientations studied are presented in the 𝜑ଶ = 45° cut of Euler space (Figure 
2.1). In this orientation space, each point represents a crystal orientationg, defined 
by 3 Euler angles, with an associated orientation density f(g) (see section 2.4.1) 
(Bunge 1969). The so-called fiber textures are sets of orientations represented by 
lines in Euler space, associated with the same crystallographic direction aligned with 
a macroscopic direction (see Figure 2.1). 
2.2.1. Typical orientations of ferrite 
The preferred orientations obtained when deforming a sheet in the ferritic 
domain are those of the fiber denoted α, where the crystals align a <110> direction 
parallel to the RD. There is no preferred crystal direction parallel to the direction 
normal to the sheet and this set of orientations is therefore denoted α={hkl}<110>. 
Specifically, this fiber is partial, extending from the “rotated cube” orientation 
({001}<110>) to the {111}<110> orientation, with a peak intensity at {112}<110>. 
The mechanical characteristics obtained for these orientations are presented in 
Table 2.1 for two typical single-crystal orientations of this fiber, and then for the 
entire partial fiber α. 
The two major components of this partial fiber appear strongly anisotropic in the 
plane of the sheet, both in terms of elastic and plastic properties. The “rotated cube” 
orientation leads to a maximum Young’s modulus of 210 GPa for a stress at 0° and 
90° (direction <110> parallel to the tension axis) and a minimum of 119 GPa at 45° 
(direction <100> parallel to the tension axis). The Lankford coefficient is maximum 
at 45°. 
The almost square-shaped yield surface indicates a very different response from 
that of the {112}<110> orientation, for example, with respect to the two points 
essential for stamping, which are 𝜎ଵଵ = 𝜎ଶଶ (biaxial expansion) and 𝜎ଵଵ = − 𝜎ଶଶ
(swaging). The shrinkage is indeed not favored in the case of orientation 
{001}<110>. Note that for a “primary cube” orientation ({001}<100>), the results 
would be identical to within 45° with respect to the evolution of the Young’s 48 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
modulus, Lankford’s coefficient and yield strength, whereas the flow surface would 
present a shape closer to that obtained for the {112}<110> component (but smaller). 
This orientation is however rarely obtained in ferrite. A <100>//ND fiber can be more 
easily obtained, for example, in ferritic rolling performed at high temperature, as this 
favors grain nucleation by plastic strain-induced grain boundary migration (SIBM, a 
process used to manufacture sheets for magnetic applications; Grégori et al. 2014). 
The “rotated cube” orientation is typical of cold or warm deformation textures. The 
{112}<110> orientation is associated with very strong deformation (tensile) 
anisotropy, with very large values of the Lankford coefficient, but also higher values 
of the yield strength than for the “rotated cube” orientation. The partial fiber is 
therefore also characterized by a strong anisotropy of the elastic and plastic properties. 
It is therefore conceivable that the stamping of such a texture could be critical. 
Figure 2.1. Identification of the main orientations present in the steels 
(section 𝜑ଶ = 45°of the Euler space). For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Table 2.2 groups the results obtained for the two major orientations composing 
the so-called γ = {111}<uvw> fiber, which are the {111}<110> or {111}<112> 
orientations, as well as for the complete fiber. These orientations are obtained 
mainly by recrystallization of low carbon steels. It can be seen from the table that 
these components are elastically isotropic (and have a Young’s modulus equal to 
228 GPa, regardless of the tensile direction in the plane of the plate) and that, 
furthermore, the complete fiber is also plastically isotropic. Therefore, it is the Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 49 
intensity of this fiber that is sought to be optimized for drawing properties. The high 
and constant value of R indicates that a high and homogeneous deformation in the 
plane of the sheet can be achieved, associated with a yield strength close to that of a 
material with an isotropic texture.

Table 2.3 groups the calculations obtained for two orientations close to the 
{111}<112> orientation on the one hand and for the Goss = ({011}<100>) 
orientation on the other. The first two, {554}<225> and {223}<582>, develop 
successively when the cold rolling rate increases (Akisue 1976), but also when the 
rolling temperature increases (warm rolling; Ruddle et al. 1992). Their impact on the 
planar anisotropy of the Young’s modulus is small. In both cases, the modulus 
remains between 200 and 250 GPa. On the other hand, the plastic anisotropy in 
deformation can be relatively high, just as for an isolated {111}<112> or 
{111}<110> orientation. 
The “Goss” orientation, on the other hand, has the advantage of having a 
<111>direction in the plane of the sheet. This is the direction along which the 
Young’s modulus is maximum. For this orientation, the direction <111> is located at 
55° from the RD, the modulus value is then 283 GPa. This orientation presents a 
very large anisotropy in elasticity as well as in plasticity. Regarding the tensile 
response, it exhibits the particularity 𝜎(0) ≅ 𝜎(90) with 𝑅(0) ≠ 𝑅(90). The large 
difference observed between the values of R makes the mechanical behavior of this 
orientation difficult to reproduce using simple plasticity criteria such as the Hill 
criterion (Woodthorpe and Pearce 1970), whereas micromechanical models that take 
crystallographic slip into account reproduce it very well. The development of this 
Goss orientation is favored during recrystallization if the deformation contains shear 
components (e.g. by rolling without lubrication), if the grains are coarse (because 
homogeneous deformation is difficult) and if there is carbon in solid solution 
(dynamic aging favors shear deformation). The development of this orientation can 
therefore be promoted by ferritic rolling without lubrication in an unstabilized steel. 
This component is also sought in Fe-Si electrical steels, as it is then associated with 
good magnetic and electrical properties (Faba and Antonio 2021). 
2.2.2. Typical orientations of austenite 
As in other alloys of face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with high stacking fault 
energy (copper alloys, for example), one can find in cold-deformed austenite the 
orientations composing the so-called α2
 fiber, which goes from the Goss = 
{011}<100> orientation to the brass or Bs = {011}<112> orientation, as well as the 
2 The two major fibers are called α and γ in ferrite and α and β in austenite. It is important to 
note that the two fibers do not coincide at all in orientations. Moreover, although the same 
orientation such as the Goss orientation can be found in both ferrite and austenite, it does not 
deform in the same way, since the slip systems are not identical in the two phases (see section 
2.4.2). The profiles of R and σas well as the 2D cross-section of the plasticity surface are, 
however, qualitatively very similar and are therefore not reproduced for the fcc structure. Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 53 
orientations composing the so-called β fiber, which goes from the Bs orientation 
to the copper or Cu = {112}<111> orientation, through the S = {123}<634> 
orientation, not localized in the 𝜑ଶ = 45° cross-section (see Figure 2.1). 
The percentage of each of these orientations depends in a complex way on the 
rolling parameters (reduction rate, deformation rate and temperature). The elastic 
and plastic behavior of the last three orientations is shown in Table 2.4. 
A strong elastic and plastic anisotropy is observed for the three orientations. The 
Young’s modulus reaches 295 GPa for the Cu orientation at 0°. The values of R are 
also very high around 45° for these orientations, thus “mixing” these three 
orientations will not contribute to decreasing the plastic anisotropy. This could be 
reduced by adding recrystallization type components such as the cube orientation for 
example. 
2.2.3. Typical orientations of phase transformation 
2.2.3.1. Orientation relationships between ferrite and austenite 
The most frequently cited and studied orientation relationships in steels are listed 
in Table 2.5. The number of variants corresponds to the number of possible 
transformation orientations, taking into account crystal symmetries, from a single 
given parent orientation. 
Even if the number of variants and the angles of misorientation differ, the major 
orientations resulting from the transformation are in fact very close. The most 
commonly used orientation relation in steels is the Kurdjumov–Sachs (KS) relation, 
which induces the formation of 24 variants. The textures obtained by assuming a KS 
orientation relation from the four main components encountered in austenite (Cu, 
Bs, Goss and cube) are represented in Table 2.6, as well as the evolution of the 
associated elastic and plastic properties. 
Even though preferential orientations are still seen in the Euler space sections, 
considering all 24 variants equally in the transformation texture results in a strong 
evolution of the elastic and plastic properties toward isotropy. The Young’s modulus 
varies between 210 and 230 GPa for the four orientations and the calculated 
Lankford coefficient does not exceed 1.5. A slight plastic anisotropy remains visible 
on the shape of the yield surface, and in particular for the texture resulting from the 
transformation of the cube orientation. 54 New Advanced High Strength Steels

Table 2.5. Main orientation relationships observed between ferrite 
(noted α) and austenite (noted γ) (*approximately <0.85,0.29,0.44>) 
The phenomenon of “variant selection” (Cabus et al. 2007) is often cited in the 
literature to explain why not all texture components predicted by these orientation 
relationships are observed experimentally. 
We will not detail the reasons based on physical metallurgy that would induce 
such effects (effects due to residual stresses that would direct the growth of nuclei 
are often evoked). We draw attention to the fact that the transformation products of 
austenite generally show a strong morphological anisotropy. As soon as we are 
talking about laths or needles, the plane in which the textures are measured has an 
impact on the fractions of the different variants obtained, even if present in 
equivalent quantities. This point is illustrated in Figure 2.2. 
We can see two laths coming from the same austenite grain of copper 
orientation, which are, for example, two variants among the 24 possible according to 
the KS transformation. Depending on whether the 2D investigation plane (by EBSD 
or X-ray goniometer) is the one containing the normal direction (ND) and the RD, or 
the one containing the ND and the transverse direction (TD), the volume fractions 
taken into account for these two laths are different. 
This results in an apparently different texture, as can be seen in the Euler space 
sections of the orientation distribution function (ODF), which take into account the 
24 possible variants according to KS, giving the impression that some variants are 
less present than others. This is why we prefer to present in the following

In Figure 2.3, on the left is shown the theoretical texture obtained by plane

58 New Advanced High Strength Steels Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 59 
Of course, it is possible that there are selections of variants during the 
transformation (just as it is possible that the synthetic texture does not quite reflect 
that of the austenite), but this result is consistent with what has been observed (Ray 
and Jonas 1990). This calculation shows that the texture resulting from the 
transformation to ferrite from austenite that has retained its deformation structure is 
relatively close to that of hardened ferrite deformed in plane compression (its 
intensity is lower, since one austenite orientation produces 24 ferrite variants). 
Let us now assume that the austenite is strongly sheared. In Figure 2.4, on the 
left is represented the theoretical texture obtained by shearing an austenite (e.g. near 
the surface of the sheet and for certain rolling conditions such as a high friction 
coefficient or rolls of different diameters), and on the right is represented the texture 
of the resulting transformation products in the ferrite (still with an assumption of a 
KS-type orientation relationship, without selection of variants). To obtain this type 
of texture, it is assumed that the austenite does not have the time or the possibility to 
recrystallize (e.g. due to rapid cooling after deformation or cold cylinders or alloying 
elements inhibiting recrystallization). Brass and copper type texture components, 
usually typical of deformed autenite, are obtained in the ferritic structure.

austenite texture; (b) ferrite texture calculated assuming a Kurdjumov–Sachs 
orientation relationship between phases. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
At this point, it seems appropriate to review the textural similarities that can be 
encountered in centered cubic (cc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) structures deformed 
in plane compression or shear. 60 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
2.2.3.3. Similarities between the textures of cc and fcc systems 
The slip-induced change in orientation in the cc system is equivalent to the 
change in orientation in the fcc system if one rotates 90° about the TD, due to the 
symmetry of the considered slip systems, {111}<110> in the fcc structure and 
{110}<111> in the cc structure (see, e.g., Hölscher et al. 1991). Thus, for small 
strains, equivalences can be deduced between the deformation textures obtained by 
shear or plane compression in the fcc or cc structures. 
This point is illustrated in Figure 2.5, where we find the main deformation 
orientations of austenite if we rotate 90° around TD a rolling deformation texture 
measured on a ferrite. 
Figure 2.5. Cross-section of Euler space at φ2 = 45°: (a) the planar compression 
texture of a ferrite (measured at mid-thickness of an IF-Ti steel after 90% cold 
rolling); (b) the same texture after a 90° rotation around TD. For a color version of 
this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Similarly, when the ferrite is shear deformed, one obtains maxima close to the 
brass and copper orientations, typical of plane compression deformation of austenite, 
as shown in Figure 2.6. And if we rotate this texture 90° about TD, we obviously 
find the orientations typical of plane compression of ferrite, and particularly 
{112}<110> and {001}<110>. 
Conversely, when austenite undergoes shear deformation, the texture that 
develops consists of a partial α fiber and a γ fiber, and thus resembles a plane 
compression deformation texture of ferrite. Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 61 
The equivalences between the textures are finally summarized in Figure 2.7.

2.3. Conclusion 
By examining the textures encountered in steels (third generation as well as older 
ones) component by component, we realize that they are most often associated with 
a strong anisotropy of elastic and plastic properties. 62 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
We have thus seen, for example, that the highest value of Young’s modulus that 
could be reached by playing with the crystallographic textures was of the order of 
280 GPa. This value will then be reached only along a macroscopic direction of the 
sheet (the direction parallel to the crystalline direction <111>). Along the other 
directions, the modulus will be lower and its value will depend on the main texture 
components (the minimum value will be all the lower as there will be many 
directions close to <100> in the plane of the sheet). For example, for a Goss-type 
texture, we get Emin = 120 GPa. In the same way, the Lankford coefficient can sweep 
a very large range of values in the plane of the sheet, leading to greater or lesser 
difficulties in shaping. 
The textures encountered in third-generation steels are not always isotropic, 
except in the case of complex multiphase structures, involving multiple phase 
transformation mechanisms, possibly associated with recrystallization or 
precipitation mechanisms (Nesterova et al. 2015). It is therefore still essential to be 
able to analyze these textures in a qualitative and quantitative way in order to allow 
the calculation of mechanical properties, but also to better understand the 
mechanisms involved, whether plasticity, recrystallization or phase transformation. 
2.4. Calculation details 
The results presented in Tables 2.1–2.4 and 2.6 were made from synthetic 
textures created by taking 20 orientations randomly dispersed around the main 
orientations considered with a maximum dispersion of 10°. Moreover, orthotropic 
symmetry is imposed, considering symmetrical orientations that respect this 
symmetry. Thus, the synthetic textures “cube”, “rotated cube” and “Goss” are 
described by a set of 20 orientations only, the orientations Bs, Cu, {111}<110>, 
{111}<112>, {110}<112> and {554}<225> are described by a set of 40 orientations 
and the orientations S and {223}<582> by a set of 80 orientations. The partial fibers 
α and γ, on the other hand, are described by sets of 100 orientations. Given the 
variable number of orientations necessary to respect the orthotropic symmetry and 
the number retained to model a certain dispersion around these orientations, the 
maximums of the ODFs (see section 2.4.1.1) can vary greatly from one texture to 
another (up to 80 for a cube texture for example). It is therefore not possible to plot 
all these ODFs with the same contour scale, and we will therefore not focus too 
much on the absolute value of these maximums. The contours correspond in general 
to levels varying by steps of 10 for the most marked textures (like the cube 
orientation for example), by steps of 5 for the other textures (including the fibers), 
and by steps of 4 for the textures resulting from KS transformations. Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 63 
2.4.1. How to calculate the Young’s modulus of a textured polycrystal? 
For small isotropic strains, the relationship between the stress tensor 𝜎 and the 
strain tensor 𝜀 is linear (Hooke’s law) (Nye 1985). The relationship between the 
stress and strain tensors is noted as: 
𝜎௜௝ = 𝐶௜௝௞௟. 𝜀௞௟or𝜀௜௝ = 𝑆௜௝௞௟. 𝜎௞௟ [2.1] 
where 𝐶௜௝௞௟ and 𝑆௜௝௞௟ are the elements of the stiffness and compliance tensors, 
respectively. This means that, for a given loading 𝜎௜௝, each component of the strain 
tensor will depend on all components of the stress tensor. 
2.4.1.1. Calculation of polycrystal properties 
The calculation of the average value for the polycrystal 𝑀ഥ of a physical or 
mechanical property 𝑀(𝑔) that depends on the crystal orientation g is expressed via 
the ODF f(g), which is equal to the volume fraction of grains that have the 
orientation g, to within dg (Bunge 1969): 
𝑀ഥ =∫𝑀(𝑔). 𝑓(𝑔). 𝑑𝑔 [2.2] 
The average value of the local moduli is thus written as: 
𝑆̅
௜௝௞௟ =∫𝑆௜௝௞௟(𝑔). 𝑓(𝑔). 𝑑𝑔 [2.3] 
However, for the polycrystal, one seeks to derive the Young’s modulus from the 
effective moduli, which relate the average macroscopic stresses 𝜎ത to the average 
macroscopic strains 𝜀, resulting in a relation ̅ 𝜀̅௜௝௞௟ = 𝑆ሚ

In the tables, the Young’s modulus is compared to that of an isotropic sample, 
equal to 202 GPa for ferrite and 191 GPa for austenite (curves in red). RD and TD 
indicate, respectively, the RD (for α = 0°) and the TD (for α = 90°). 
2.4.2. How to calculate the Lankford coefficient of a textured 
polycrystal? 
The Lankford coefficient is often used to characterize the anisotropy of a plate. If 
a tensile test is performed in a direction oriented at an angle 𝛼 to the RD, this Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 65 
coefficient is defined as the ratio of the strains in the width and thickness of the 
sample as follows: 
𝑅(𝛼) = ఌೢ೔೏೟೓
ఌ౪౞౟ౙౡ౤౛౩౩
 [2.9] 
This ratio is generally determined experimentally over a range of deformation 
typically varying from 5% to 25% of deformation, in which it is most often 
considered to be constant (this is the case for steels, excluding highly work-hardened 
materials, for which this factor becomes difficult to evaluate beyond a few percent 
of deformation). By calculation, we replace this coefficient by a ratio of the strain 
rates at the very beginning of the test (Jongenburger et al. 1974), expressed in the 
tensile frame by: 
𝑅(𝛼) = ఌሶ
ೢ೔೏೟೓
ఌሶ
౪౞౟ౙౡ౤౛౩౩
 [2.10] 
In this chapter, it has been calculated using the Taylor model (in a viscoplastic 
version) for all the synthetic textures studied, imposing on each orientation (defined 
by the index 𝑔) composing the texture the following strain rate tensor, expressed in 
the tensile frame (along axis 1): 
𝜀௚ሶ = 𝐸ሶ = 𝐸ሶ
ଵଵ. อ10 0
0 −𝑞 0
0 0 𝑞−1อ [2.11] 
𝐸ሶ
 represents the macroscopic tensor, 𝐸ሶ
ଵଵ represents the macroscopic strain rate 
imposed in the tensile direction and the factor 𝑞, referred to as the contraction ratio, 
is calculated by minimizing the macroscopic plastic power with respect to 𝑞, which 
is equivalent to finding the value of 𝑞 associated with a uniaxial macroscopic stress 
state in direction 1 (Bunge 1969; Arminjon and Bacroix 1991; Kocks et al. 1998). 
For each orientation, the viscoplastic behavior law is used to calculate the stress 
state 𝜎௚ associated with 𝜀௚ሶ (𝑞), and then to calculate the plastic power at the grain 
and polycrystal scale (the scale at which the minimization procedure is performed): 
𝑊ሶ
௚ = 𝜀௚ሶ . 𝜎௚ and 𝑊ሶ = 𝐸ሶ
ଵଵ. 𝛴ଵଵ [2.12] 
The macroscopic Lankford coefficient is then simply equal to: 
𝑅(𝛼) = 𝑞 (1 − 𝑞 ⁄ ) [2.13] 
For all calculations, two families of slip systems {110}<111> and {112}<111> 
were considered for the cc (ferrite) structure, while only one family {111}<110> 66 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
was considered for the fcc (austenite) structure. The reference shear stress 𝜏଴
௦ = 𝜏଴
is taken identical and equal to 1 for these three families of systems. With an 
exponent equal to 20 for the viscoplastic law (which approximates the plastic limit; 
Charles et al. 2020), we thus find a value of 𝑊ሶ equal to 2.98 for an isotropic texture 
(fcc) and 2.72 for an isotropic texture (cc). The macroscopic yield strength 𝛴ଵଵ(𝛼)
(denoted σ(𝛼) in Tables 2.1–2.6) was also extracted from this calculation (by 
averaging over the calculated stresses for each orientation) and shown normalized to 
the isotropic value. Similar to the ODF contours, the values of the maximums of the 
R profiles are strongly dependent on the texture discretization. No adjustment on 
experimental values has been performed here. 
2.4.3. How to calculate the yield surface of a textured polycrystal? 
In the most general case, the yield surface of a textured polycrystal, which allows 
one to evaluate the mechanical response to any imposed stress or strain rate loading, 
is defined in a five-dimensional reference frame associated with the five 
independent components of the strain rate tensors 𝐸ሶ
 and the stress deviator 𝑆. If we 
reduce to the biaxial stresses that can be imposed in the plane of a sheet, we can 
represent it in three dimensions associated with the three components 
𝐸ሶ
ଵଵ, 𝐸ሶ
ଶଶ, 𝐸ሶ
ଵଶ or 𝑆ଵଵ, 𝑆ଶଶ, 𝑆ଵଶ. Indeed, it has been shown that, for a material with 
orthotropic symmetry, this specific subspace is “closed”, that is, to a stress tensor 
expressed in this subspace (11, 22, 12) is associated a velocity tensor also contained 
in this subspace (Canova et al. 1985). As shown in the two-dimensional diagram 
(Figure 2.8), this surface can then be defined as the envelope of tangents 
characterized by their normal (defined from 𝐸ሶ
) and by their distance from the center 
equal to the normalized plastic power 𝑀. If one uses the Taylor model (in a 
viscoplastic version), this normalized power is nothing but the Taylor factor: 
𝑀൫𝐸ሶ
൯ = ௐሶ (ாሶ)
ఛబ.|ாሶ| = ாሶ
.𝑺
ఛబ.|ாሶ|
 [2.14] 
ห𝐸ሶ
ห represents the norm (e.g. in the sense of von Mises, ห𝐸ሶ
ห = ටଶ
ଷ
𝐸ሶ
௜௝𝐸ሶ
௜௝) of the 
tensor 𝐸ሶ
 and the stress state is normalized by the reference shear stress of the slip 
systems 𝜏଴. In order to plot this surface, again using the Taylor model, we therefore 
vary the tensor imposed on all grains in three-dimensional space (𝐸ሶ
ଵଵ, 𝐸ሶ
ଶଶ, 𝐸ሶ
ଵଶ
ሶ ) (so 
as to evenly cover all of 3D space), then deduce the Taylor factor 𝑀 averaged over 
all orientations, and then plot the yield surface as the envelope of the tangents 
associated with these data. For simplicity, we have represented only the section of 
this surface corresponding to 𝑆ଵଶ = 0, in (𝛴ଵଵ, 𝛴ଶଶ) space assuming 𝛴ଷଷ = 0.Anisotropy and Mechanical Properties 67 
In order to be able to compare the surfaces, the stresses are finally normalized 
with respect to the value obtained in tension along the RD for an isotropic sample; 
this value is equal to 2.72 for ferrite and 2.98 for austenite. These two values depend 
on the parameters retained in the viscoplastic behavior law and in particular on the 
exponent n describing the sensitivity to the strain rate (taken here as 20).

3.1. Introduction 
This chapter is intended to provide a concise description of the current state of 
our knowledge regarding the metallurgical aspects of damage and fracture in 
modern high-strength steel grades. 
Three aspects will be successively addressed: 
– the description of the methods of measurement of these properties will allow 
the reader to apprehend the importance of the geometrical and mechanical factors on 
the fracture properties; 
– we will then detail the damage mechanisms to illustrate how the main elements 
of the microstructure of steels influence them; 
– finally, some examples from the industrial development of high-strength steels 
will be described. 
3.2. Methods for measuring the resistance to damage and fracture 
This section describes the main mechanical tests used to characterize the 
resistance of steels to fracture. We will discuss the geometrical and mechanical 72 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
aspects that influence this property, in particular in relation with the properties of the 
stress and strain fields associated with each type of test. 
3.2.1. Fracture elongation 
It is important to start with this parameter, which is the basis of the 
communication on the development of ultra-high-strength steels. It describes the 
different families of ultra-high-strength steels in a diagram (fracture elongation vs. 
tensile strength) in Figure 3.1. It represents the regular drop in fracture elongation 
(also sometimes called total elongation) as the strength of the steels increases. 
Conventional steels are shown in blue (ferritic deep drawing steels, mild steels, 
HSLA steels). Very high strength steels are represented in other colors, taking the 
different development steps into account: 
– the first generation concerns martensitic and bainitic steels, as well as 
multiphase steels of the dual phase (DP), complex phase (CP) or TRIP type; 
– the second generation uses austenitic steels (alloyed with Mn or Ni) to reach 
very high elongations (> 50%); 
– the third generation is currently under industrial and commercial development. 
It does not aim at increasing the strengths, but, for a given strength, to propose 
higher elongations. This family consists of multiphase steels containing a large 
fraction of residual austenite (e.g. Q&P steels described in Chapter 1). 
Figure 3.1 represents one of the major challenges in the development of steels: to 
guarantee a minimal decrease of the fracture elongation when the mechanical 
strength increases. 
Regardless of the standards considered (American, European, or Japanese), it is 
explicitly stated that the tensile test allows determination of the fracture elongation. 
The ASTM E8/E8M 15 a (2015) standard describes the determination of fracture 
elongation, or total elongation in NF-EN ISO 6892-1 (2019), measured directly on 
the tensile curve; it also describes the determination of elongation after fracture, 
measured after rebuilding the broken specimen. 
In a tensile test (Figure 3.2), the first stage corresponds to a homogeneous 
deformation of the specimen until the maximum force is reached. Chapter 1 
describes the behavior of the steel during this stage. Beyond this point, the 
deformation becomes heterogeneous and is concentrated inside a zone of diffuse 
necking at first. The deformation is then concentrated in this relatively large area, 
then the localization stage occurs, which leads to fracture. Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 73

Figure 3.2. Evolution of the strain in a tensile specimen during the test 74 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Although the fracture elongation is a property integrated in the specifications of 
steels, it cannot by itself guarantee the fracture resistance performance of steels. In 
fact, its value depends on several factors: 
– The effects of the specimen geometry: the fracture elongation is the sum of 
the uniform strain and the strain in the necking region. A larger longitudinal gauge 
length, 𝐿𝑜, therefore incorporates a larger portion of uniform strain and decreases 
the value of fracture elongation. It also decreases as the slenderness ratio of the 
specimen, 𝐿𝑜/√𝑆𝑜, where 𝑆𝑜 represents the cross-sectional area, increases. In a 
recent paper, Hanlon et al. (2017) showed, on a 1500 MPa martensitic steel, that 
large variations in geometry had little impact on the strength or uniform elongation 
measurements (3 ± 0.5%), but a large impact on the measured fracture elongation, 
which varied between 4% and 12%. 
– The resistance to strain localization: this is an important parameter that 
controls the necking region in which the damage and fracture processes mainly 
occur. Localization is still the subject of much research. Different criteria give the 
conditions in which it occurs (e.g. Rice 1976; Needleman 1978). Different modes 
can be obtained, from pure opening mode to pure shear fracture that occurs in a 
plane that makes an angle ψ with the plane normal to the tensile direction (Figure 
3.3). For a tensile specimen, the geometry offering the highest resistance to 
localization is the cylindrical specimen (axisymmetric tensile), while localization is 
easier in flat specimens (plane strain or plane stress). This explains the beneficial 
effect of an increase in the specimen thickness/width ratio (from right to left in 
Figure 3.3) on the necking mode and thus on the fracture elongation. 
Figure 3.3. Evolution of the strain localization mode in a flat tensile specimen when 
the width increases for a constant thickness (case of a ferritic drawable steel) Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 75 
– The strain rate sensitivity: as explained in the chapter on crashing, the flow 
stress varies with the strain rate. It increases in most very high-strength steels with a 
parameter m= ቀ
∂lnσ
∂lnεሶ
ቁ
ε,T
 that varies between 0.005 and 0.01 (see Chapter 7). This 
positive strain rate sensitivity results in an increase in flow stress in the necking 
region where the strain localizes. Due to this local hardening, the strain imposed on 
the slices adjacent to necking is shifted to distant areas, where the strain rate is 
lower. The resulting deformation is therefore less localized, the strain more diffuse, 
and the elongation higher. Some very high strength steels, mainly second-generation 
austenitic steels, show a negative sensitivity to the strain rate. They soften in the 
necking zone, deformation therefore further localizes there, leading quickly to a 
fracture in shear mode. The non-uniform deformation zone is reduced and the 
fracture elongation is barely higher than the uniform elongation. 
Given the limitations described above, the fracture elongation can only be 
considered as an indicator and specific tests must be used to characterize the fracture 
resistance of steels. Some methods will be described in Chapter 7. They aim at 
measuring a local fracture strain, that is, in the final fracture region. This is always 
possible on a tensile specimen by measuring the reduction of area at fracture, 
defined as the area of the fracture surface compared to the initial cross-section area 
of the specimen. Other test geometries, allowing the mechanical loading state to be 
varied in order to be representative of real in-use conditions, are presented in 
Chapter 7. 
3.2.2. Bending impact toughness 
Impact toughness is the ability to absorb mechanical energy before fracture 
during an impact. It is generally evaluated under three-point bending by impact on a 
notched bar. The impact can be applied by a drop weight test (Pellini, Battelle tests) 
or by the action of a pendulum (Charpy test). Instrumentation of the impactor by 
strain gauges can provide the load–displacement curves of the bearing point. More 
generally, the examination of the fracture surfaces with a binocular magnifying glass 
makes it possible to quantify the shiny fraction (“crystalline”) attributed to brittle 
fracture and the dull fraction (“fibrous”) attributed to ductile fracture. The total 
amount of absorbed energy divided by the surface area perpendicular to the loaded 
region is called impact toughness and is expressed in J/cm². Like the reduction in 
thickness of the specimen, it is also a marker of the fracture resistance. The reader 
will find more detailed information in some previous studies (François 1984; Berdin 
and Prioul 2007). 76 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Most of the absorbed energy is dissipated by plastic deformation processes 
(linked or not to damage development). The contributions of free surface creation 
(cracking itself) and kinetic energy are very minor. Most steels with a body-centered 
cubic structure show a ductile-to-brittle transition in impact toughness (Figure 3.4). 
At low temperatures, the stress required for plastic flow is high. The competition 
between plastic dissipation and cracking is altered and brittle fracture, involving 
little macroscopic deformation and absorbing little energy, is then observed. At 
higher temperatures, plastic deformation is easier and the cracks possibly created by 
damage processes are more easily blunted, which slows down or even stops their 
propagation. 
Figure 3.4. Ductile-to-brittle Charpy transition curve, definition of the quantities of 
interest and macroscopic aspect of the fracture surfaces (after Lam Thanh 2003). 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
The sampling of the specimens and the realization of the tests are simple, but the 
fine interpretation of the results is more complex. The impact speed being high 
(about 5 m/s, test duration about 10 ms), deformation is fast (a few hundred s–1). The 
local stresses are high because of the viscoplastic character of the steels under these 
loading conditions. Self-heating at the notch tip can reach 150°C (Tanguy et al. 
2005). The inertia effects are negligible, however, as the impact speed is much lower 
than in a crash (Chapter 7). Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 77 
Being easy to perform, requiring little amounts of material, the Charpy test is 
commonly used during manufacturing controls as well as in the upstream phases of 
the development of a new grade. It has been adapted to the case of thin sheets, 
especially for the automotive industry. However, the transposition of the results to a 
larger structure (including drop weight tests and “full-scale” tests) is delicate. In a 
larger structure, the crack may accelerate more and a change in the fracture mode 
(whether ductile or brittle) to a less energy-intensive mode (slant fracture) may 
occur during crack propagation. In this case, the Charpy test alone is neither 
representative of the phenomenology nor conservative for the design. Generally 
speaking, the impact toughness is closely dependent on the type of test; this 
dependence is partially resolved by the use of fracture toughness tests. 
3.2.3. Fracture toughness: resistance to unstable crack propagation 
Near the tip of a sharp crack, the stress fields are characterized at any point M, 
located at a distance r from the crack tip and at a polar angle θ to the crack plane 
(Figure 3.5a). Initially, the material behavior is assumed to be linear elastic. Three 
crack opening modes are distinguished (Figure 3.5b). The stresses at point M, when 
r tends to zero, are dominated by a singularity as follows: 
𝜎௜௝ = ௄
√ଶగ௥ 𝑓௜௝ሺ𝜃ሻ ൅ 𝑂൫√𝑟൯ [3.1] 
Figure 3.5. (a) Notations used for the evaluation of the stress fields at the crack tip, 
plastic zone and contour, S, used for the calculation of the J-integral; (b) the three 
loading modes of a cracked component. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 78 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
In this expression, fij is physically dimensionless and K, the stress intensity 
factor, is expressed in MPa√m. It depends on the applied loading and on the 
geometry of the cracked component. It can be evaluated by finite element 
calculations; many tabulations exist for various geometries. In particular, K grows 
with the crack length, a, even for an infinite component (it is then of the order of 
𝜎√𝜋𝑎 with σ the remote stress). 
Still under an assumption of isotropic elasticity, one can also evaluate the energy 
release rate, G, per unit area of crack created. There are relationships between G and 
K. It is shown that under given load F, for a specimen of compliance C (or stiffness, 
1/C), A being the crack area:

ଶ 𝐹ଶ డ஼
డ஺ [3.2] 
For most metallic materials, however, plastic flow limits the stress magnitude 
near the crack tip, while blunting the crack. The plastic zone size, rZP, is typically in 
the order of ଵ

with α = 1 in plane stress conditions and α = 3 in plane strain 
conditions, where σy is the flow stress of the material. For example, for K = 
100 MPa√m in plane strain, rZP is 1.66 mm and 0.47 mm for a flow stress of 800 and 
1500 MPa, respectively. Other formulations of the stress and displacement fields 
exist for strain-hardenable materials. Another approach consists of calculating the 
curvilinear J-integral, called Rice’s integral, over a line S going around the tip of the 
crack. The J-integral is defined as follows: 
𝐽 = ׬ ቀ𝑤 d𝑦 − 𝑇ሬ⃗ ∙
డ௨ሬ⃗
డ௫ d𝑠ቁ S [3.3] 
In this equation, x and y are the usual coordinates (Figure 3.5a), 𝑇ሬ⃗ is the local 
stress vector, 𝑢ሬ⃗ is the local displacement vector, and w is the elastic energy density, 
such that 𝜎௜௝ = 𝜕𝑤
𝜕𝜀௜௝ ൗ . Under certain assumptions, this integral is independent of 
the chosen contour, S. The J-integral allows the stress fields near the crack to be 
calculated by simulating the elastoplastic behavior as a nonlinear elastic behavior 
(which prohibits, in passing, the consideration of any unloading). 
Strictly speaking, the determination of fracture toughness assumes the absence 
(or near-absence) of stable crack propagation and that plasticity is constrained to a 
small-sized region around the crack tip. In particular, the specimen must be thick 
enough to satisfy plane strain conditions along a large part of the crack front; the 
ligament (to be cracked) must be long enough so that no relaxation by generalized 
plasticity can take place. This is true only at the lower end of the ductile-to-brittle Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 79 
transition (Figure 3.6a). The fracture toughness test also requires controlled 
pre-cracking of the specimens in order to cause as little disturbance to the material 
behavior as possible by the pre-cracking procedure itself. This test is therefore more 
complex and expensive to perform than the impact test. However, it is simpler to 
model, since there are no effects of stress rate and self-heating.
In the case of very tough materials or very thin structures, crack propagation is 
(at least temporarily) stable. We then measure the progress of the crack throughout 
the test via, for example, partial unloading in order to monitor the loss of stiffness of 
the specimen. The evolution of J as a function of the crack advance, Δa is deduced, 
from which J0,2 (for a crack advance of 0.2 mm) and dJ/da are derived (Figure 3.6b). 
For thin plates, the stress on single-notched specimens and the measurement of the 
area under the load versus notch opening curve make it possible to estimate the 
energy required for the initiation and propagation of the crack, respectively.

specimen loaded at room temperature (according to Tanguy 2001). For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
From all these tests, we can see that there are several characterizations of the 
fracture resistance, in the presence or absence of geometric singularities such as a 
notch or a crack (François 1984; Berdin and Prioul 2007). The more severe the 
singularity, the smaller the severely loaded region. For a given singularity, the 
smaller the specimen (or component), the lower the probability of finding a 
microstructural weak point in this zone. The fracture resistance (impact or fracture 80 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
toughness) will be better on average, but also more scattered. The choice of the 
characterization test must therefore consider both the estimated mechanical loading 
on the real component and the heterogeneities of the material, sampled by the most 
severely mechanically stressed zone. It is therefore necessary to consider the impact 
of the microstructure on the (local) fracture resistance. This leads us to detail the 
physical fracture mechanisms of and the microstructural parameters that control 
them. Based on these mechanisms, so-called “local approach to fracture” models 
allow us to evaluate the fracture toughness (or impact toughness) by eliminating, as 
much as possible, geometry effects. 
3.3. Physical mechanisms and microstructural control of damage and 
fracture 
Apart from cyclic loading (Chapter 4), three main fracture mechanisms are 
encountered in steels: brittle (transgranular) cleavage fracture, cavitation-induced 
ductile fracture and brittle intergranular fracture. For each of them, we discuss the 
mechanical loading conditions to which they are sensitive (fracture criteria), but also 
the physical phenomena and the main microstructural parameters of interest. 
3.3.1. Brittle transgranular cleavage fracture 
Brittle cleavage fracture occurs by decohesion (breaking of bonds on an atomic 
scale) along particular planes of the crystal structure. It is accepted that in the 
absence of environmental effects (hydrogen, halides, see Chapters 6 and 9), 
austenitic steels are not sensitive to it. For microstructural constituents with a 
body-centered cubic structure (ferrite, ferritic phase of constituents such as bainite or 
tempered martensite), as well as for the body-centered tetragonal structure of fresh 
martensite, cleavage occurs very generally in {001}-type planes. 
When we calculate the stress required to break all the bonds between two {001} 
planes, we find values of the order of 14 GPa. These values are much higher than the 
values determined experimentally by mechanical analysis of the tests at the actual 
fracture initiation site (typically between 1 and 3.5 GPa depending on the 
microstructure). This paradox can be solved by considering that at the local scale, 
dislocation pile-ups on sessile defects or the presence of secondary hard phases 
(inclusions, carbides, etc.) concentrate stresses. This is particularly true when the 
particles are themselves brittle (e.g. TiN) or of low cohesion with the matrix (small 
carbides or sulfides). In particular, it is accepted that plastic deformation must be 
triggered, at least locally, to initiate a cleavage crack. Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 81 
Figure 3.7. Diagram showing the three stages of brittle transgranular cleavage 
fracture in the case of initiation via fracture of a hard particle. Thin lines represent the 
high angle boundaries between neighboring crystals. For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Whatever the fracture initiation mechanism, it is considered that once the crack is 
initiated in the matrix, it propagates along a {001} plane until it encounters a high￾angle boundary, which constitutes a barrier (Figure 3.7). Depending on the case, this 
can be a grain boundary, a packet boundary, a block boundary, etc. In the presence of 
low angle crystal misorientations, the crack deviates or even branches slightly. The 
merging of neighboring fracture planes forms what is commonly called cleavage 
rivers, which make a very characteristic fracture surface (Figure 3.8). These rivers are 
particularly visible for bainite and martensite, which carry strong internal 
misorientations due to the mechanisms of phase transformation from austenite. 
To further propagate, the cleavage crack must change its (geometric) plane. The 
joint is usually crossed at a point where a simple tilt of the propagation plane is 
sufficient (tilt configuration, Figure 3.9a). Otherwise (or on other portions of the 
same joint if it is not rectilinear), several local initiations events and merging of 
fracture planes are required due to the twist component (Figure 3.9a). This 
dissipative phenomenon consumes most of the cleavage fracture energy (a few 
J/cm²), which is much higher than the energy required by free surface creation 
(about 1 J/m²). 
Brittle cleavage fracture globally propagates perpendicular to the maximum 
principal stress, unless the anisotropy of the material is such that the population of 
favorably oriented {001} planes is minimal. The fracture criterion is therefore 
expressed as a critical stress: 𝜎ூ ≥ 𝜎௖. Recall that the yield stress must also be 
exceeded in the region in question. 82 New Advanced High Strength Steels

newsteels.zip 
At very low temperatures, the yield strength is high and plastic deformation is 
difficult. A microcrack propagated through a grain of size D under an opening stress 
𝜎ூ induces a stress intensity factor 𝐾ூ of the order of 𝜎ூ√𝜋𝐷. For a given value of 𝜎ூ, Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 83 
the higher D is, the higher 𝐾ூ is and easily reaches its critical value 𝐾ூ௖, called 
fracture toughness, allowing the crack to propagate abruptly across the boundary. 
Fracture is controlled by the initiation of the first crack, and no damage is observed 
outside the fatal crack. 
At higher temperatures, the yield strength is lower (this is a feature of the body￾centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal crystal structures of ferrous alloys). A 
microcrack of insufficient size D will blunt instead of propagating across the 
boundary. Grain boundary crossing itself constitutes the limiting step. For a given 
test temperature, the larger the size of the first cleavage crack, the more easily it 
crosses the boundary and the earlier it propagates during the test; the more brittle the 
fracture behavior and the higher the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. Because 
a blunt crack will not further propagate, one can find, connected or not to the main 
crack, cleavage facets arrested at high angle boundaries. 
Due to the stress concentration necessary for crack initiation and the 
heterogeneity of the grain size, brittle cleavage fracture presents an intrinsic 
microstructure-induced scatter (sampling effect). Associated with the heterogeneity 
of the mechanical loading, it generates scale effects that are taken into account by 
probabilistic models such as the so-called Beremin approach. 
The microstructural control parameters act on several levers: 
– resistance to plastic flow; plastic flow is necessary for the initiation of a micro￾crack, but harmful to its propagation, via blunting; 
– the critical stress necessary to initiate a microcrack: size and nature of the 
particles (inclusions, precipitates), strength of the particle/matrix interfaces, 
hardness contrast between particles and matrix; 
– the conditions of abrupt propagation of the microcrack by crossing a high angle 
boundary; to define these types of boundaries, one considers not the misorientation 
angles between grains, but the angles between {001} planes of adjacent grains. 
Regarding cleavage, an “effective grain” is a region in which a crack propagates in 
an almost uninterrupted way along {001} planes favorably oriented with respect to 
the maximum principal stress at the fracture initiation site. These zones can extend 
over several grains, they are even very large if processing of the material induced a 
strong anisotropy (Figure 3.9b). 
In some cases, the embrittlement of grain boundaries by thermal aging or chemical 
segregation can facilitate cleavage crack propagation beyond them, which lowers the 
toughness and increases the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, even though the 
fracture mechanism is dominated (at more than 95%) by cleavage. In the general case, 84 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
ductile fracture zones are found between the cleavage facets, often limited to a 
strongly stretched ligament, a few dimples or a small shear-fractured surface. 
The resistance to cleavage fracture depends on the microstructural state at the 
time of microcrack initiation. If significant plastic deformation has occurred during 
the test, the flow stress, grain morphology and local texture may be altered; the 
cleavage fracture resistance is in turn affected and depends on both the loading path 
and the crack plane considered. 
This is how we interpret the appearance of brittle delamination cracks, parallel to 
the loading direction, in some hot rolled steels: their resistance to cleavage is already 
anisotropic in the initial state and this phenomenon increases with plastic 
deformation when the specimen is loaded along the plane of the plate. These effects 
are only partially taken into account in the current local approach models. 
3.3.2. Ductile fracture by cavitation 
Ductile fracture is described by considering three stages as schematized in 
Figure 3.10. 
Figure 3.10. Ductile damage of a quenched and tempered medium carbon steel 
fractured in uniaxial tension at room temperature (after Tioguem Teagho 2019); the 
three stages of the process are schematized from details of the micrograph. SEM on 
polished longitudinal cross-section, backscattered electrons; carbides are in white, 
cavities are in black and matrix is in gray. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 85 
– Stage 1: Nucleation of the first cavities (also called voids): in the general 
case, it occurs by fracture of a hard minor phase (inclusion, large carbide or nitride, 
martensite particle or martensite-austenite island in a less hard matrix, etc.). It can 
also result from interfacial decohesion between these phases and the matrix. In both 
cases, a brittle microcrack, of the size of the minority phase involved, is created and 
quickly blunted. The result is a microcavity. The density of such nucleation sites is 
an important parameter. The nucleation criterion, whether it involves stress 
concentration in the particle or at the particle-matrix interface, depends on the local 
plastic strain (in the matrix) and possibly on the stress triaxiality ratio 𝜏 = ఙ೘
ఙ೐೜
, with 
σm the hydrostatic stress and σeq the equivalent stress (according to a yield criterion, 
e.g., von Mises). 
– Stage 2: Cavity growth: if the mechanical loading is further increased, the 
microcavities grow due to plastic deformation of the matrix. They may possibly 
encounter other hard phases or other individual microcavities, which limits their 
growth along the considered direction. The fraction of cavities (or porosity, f) 
increases linearly with the amount of plastic strain and exponentially with the 
triaxiality ratioτ (as long as the latter is positive). 
– Stage 3: Coalescence of cavities: as loading proceeds, the ligaments of matter 
between the cavities become more and more severely loaded. Clustering of cavities 
into macroscopic cracks can be governed by two phenomena. In the case of internal 
necking, a plastic instability occurs in the ligament, leading to the very rapid growth 
and meeting of the cavities via a thin thread of highly stretched material. Void 
sheeting occurs when a second population of cavities nucleates from other smaller 
particles (e.g. densely distributed fine carbides), in a region of the ligament where 
plastic deformation strongly localizes by shear. Coalescence of these secondary 
cavities takes place by internal necking. The void sheeting mode is all the more 
prevalent as the steel, at the time damage appears, has exhausted its work hardening 
capacity, and thus its resistance to plastic strain localization, and as a high density of 
fine particles strengthens the microstructure to optimize the UTS. 
The fracture surfaces show cavity halves, called dimples (Figure 3.11). 
Depending on the void nucleation mechanism and on the spatial distribution of the 
sites that gave rise to them, dimples contain, or not, particles. The dimples are all the 
more equiaxed and deep as the stress triaxiality ratio was locally high. Their size 
varies with the amount of plastic strain: a large dimple results from an early void 
nucleation. The coalescence by internal necking produces dimples of homogeneous 
size (if the particles are uniformly distributed in the fracture plane). 86 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Coalescence by void sheeting generally produces two populations of dimples: 
the larger ones (primary dimples) generated by Stage 1 and the smaller ones 
(secondary dimples) generated by Stage 3. The competition between these different 
phenomena depends on both the microstructure and the loading mode, in particular 
via the resistance to plastic strain localization. For example, low triaxiality 
conditions (stretching) favor localized ductile fracture dominated by void sheeting. 
The stronger a steel (high UTS), the more strongly it resists cavity growth by plastic 
deformation, the more sensitive it will generally be to plastic strain localization and 
early cavity coalescence. 
Figure 3.11. (a) Ductile fracture surface of a ferrite-bainite steel after a tensile test at 
room temperature (from Tankoua 2015); (b) slant ductile fracture surface, martensitic 
steel cracked by V-bending. For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/ 
goune/newsteels.zip 
Ductile fracture is controlled by several microstructural parameters: 
– populations of hard particles, potential cavity nucleation sites: size and shape 
distribution, spatial distribution (often at the origin of a strong anisotropy in 
resistance to ductile fracture), critical fracture stress of these particles, cohesion of 
the interface with the matrix; 
– populations of phases finely distributed in the matrix, potential nucleation sites 
of secondary cavities (future dimples) during void sheeting; 
– the parameters that govern the resistance of the matrix to plastic flow 
(chemical composition of the solid solution, dislocation density, grain size, 
strengthening precipitates, etc.): they control the contrast of properties between 
matrix and particles (thus cavity nucleation), the work hardening capacity, which Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 87 
influences both the cavity growth and the resistance to plastic strain localization 
(especially during coalescence). 
A ductile fracture mechanism is not always associated with high fracture or 
impact toughness. While the energy dissipated per unit damaged volume is very 
large, the total energy absorbed is related to the volume of the process zone, which 
can be very small. In the most resistant steels, deformation may localize within a 
thin strip of material (sometimes only 10 µm thick); fracture is then abrupt (and 
sometimes early) and generally occurs along a tilted plane (slant fracture). 
Sometimes there is no sign of damage outside the fatal crack. It is not easy to know 
the phenomenon at the origin of the fracture (damage due to an intense strain 
localization or intense strain localization following the onset of damage 
development). For less resistant steels, such a regime can also be reached with thin 
specimens, through-thickness necking leading to a plane strain state, favorable to 
this phenomenon. In some large specimens, the acceleration of the ductile crack can 
lead to a shift to this low-energy slant mode. 
3.3.3. Intergranular brittle fracture 
The intergranular fracture occurs by decohesion along grain boundaries. At a 
macroscopic scale, the fracture surface appears brittle. At a microscopic scale, 
decohesion can be brittle (presence of smooth zones, possibly decorated with second 
phases) or ductile (sub-micrometric dimples organized into sheets), especially if 
fracture occurs in a softened zone near the boundaries, for example, depleted in 
strengthening precipitates after a heat treatment. Intergranular fracture can occur 
along ferrite or austenite grain boundaries. It can also affect parent austenite grain 
boundaries, weakened by the segregation of impurities such as phosphorus, sulfur 
and/or by dense carbide precipitation. Oxidation, corrosion or certain high￾temperature viscoplastic deformation mechanisms can also lead to this type of 
fracture, especially in heat-resistant steels and stainless steels (see Chapter 6). 
Unless affected by corrosion or oxidation, the fracture surface clearly shows the 
grains (Figure 3.12). 
The control of this phenomenon involves several factors: 
– The chemical environment throughout the life of the material (Chapter 6); in 
particular, the trapping of dissolved hydrogen is to be avoided (Chapter 9); liquid 
metal embrittlement during welding of coated parts (Chapter 10) is another 
illustration. 88 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
– The heterogeneities in chemical composition at the grain boundaries, induced 
by the thermal history (e.g. segregation following a post-weld stress relieving heat 
treatment). The consideration of chemical heterogeneities at the part scale is 
important to make this estimation, especially for ingot processing. The higher the 
carbon content of a quenched steel, the more sensitive the steel is to intergranular 
embrittlement. Local chromium depletion along grain boundaries of austenitic 
stainless steels is another possible cause of intergranular corrosion cracking. 
– In some cases (especially in view of stress corrosion cracking), the distribution 
of grain boundary misorientations can be modified by appropriate thermomechanical 
treatments (successive sequences of work hardening and recrystallization). A high 
fraction of so-called “special” boundaries is developed, for which the crystal lattices 
of the two adjacent grains present a high density, 1/Σ, of common sites. As an 
example, a twin boundary is of type Σ3 for body-centered cubic and face-centered 
cubic structures. This method called “grain boundary engineering” is mainly applied 
to face-centered cubic alloys. 
Figure 3.12. Intergranular fracture surfaces: (a) fine-grained Mn-Al steel tested 
at –50°C (from Tonizzo 2017); (b) very small-grained, oxide-dispersion strengthened 
ferritic stainless steel creep-fractured at 650°C in a low-oxidizing environment (from 
Salmon-Legagneur 2017) 
A particular case of intergranular fracture is the decohesion at the 
ferrite/martensite interfaces of ultrafine grained (called UFG) duplex steels. It occurs 
mostly at low temperatures, but also governs the nucleation of cavities in ductile 
steels such as DP at room temperature. A possible cause, for certain alloyed grades, 
could be a segregation of manganese atoms at the interfaces, which would modify 
their structure. Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 89 
Generally speaking, intergranular fracture is prevented by acting on the chemical 
environment, the chemical composition of the material and the processing 
conditions (to limit segregation and embrittlement of the grain boundaries). 
3.3.4. Synthesis on fracture mechanisms 
All physical fracture mechanisms involve at the same time the resistance to 
plastic deformation (which imposes in particular the level of local stresses), the 
microstructural elements likely to trigger damage development (e.g. hard particles, 
chemically embrittled boundaries) and those likely to control its development (work 
hardening capacity, resistance to strain localization, density of grain boundaries able 
to hinder the propagation of a cleavage crack, etc.). The same microstructural lever 
can control several phenomena. For example, a fine grain size is beneficial in 
cleavage (as long as it does not excessively increase the flow stress), or even in 
ductile fracture (resistance to cavity growth) but is not always advantageous with 
respect to intergranular fracture. 
Except for some quenched grades, tempered or not, most steels are anisotropic 
and heterogeneous, both in their elastoplastic properties (due to their texture, 
Chapter 2) and in their resistance to damage (spatial distribution of potential 
nucleation sites, effective grains in cleavage, etc.). It is therefore necessary to adapt 
the mechanical characterization to the expected loading (processing, service 
conditions). The particular case of a change in loading path will be illustrated with 
the behavior of cut edges (Chapter 8). 
3.4. Examples of application 
3.4.1. Fracture toughness and ultra-high strength 
Developing tough, resistant steels is a necessity in applications where safety and 
structural integrity are fundamental. Examples include defense, energy (gas 
transportation, pressure vessels), mechanical engineering, shipbuilding and 
aerospace. The diagram in Figure 3.13 shows the different performances of high￾strength steels in a fracture toughness versus strength plane. Two main families 
present the best compromises. These are austenitic steels, which have the advantage 
of not being sensitive to cleavage fracture and which we will not detail in this 
chapter, and martensitic steels, the use of which goes back more than 3,000 years. 
These microstructures are also those used in cryogenic applications, where the 
transport and storage of natural gas or liquid hydrogen require very good fracture 
toughness at operating temperatures of −196°C or even −269°C. At these low 90 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
temperatures, fracture energy values measured on Charpy specimens can reach 100 
to 200 J/cm2
. 
Figure 3.13. Presentation of ultra-high-strength steels (>1000 MPa 
grades) in a fracture toughness versus UTS diagram. For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Martensitic microstructures reach strength values exceeding 2000 MPa while 
maintaining excellent fracture toughness. Two main families of martensitic steels 
can be distinguished in this diagram. 
In low-alloy martensitic steels, strength is given by a high carbon content 
(0.4–0.5% carbon is required to reach 2,000 MPa). In the as-quenched state, these 
steels are brittle, but tempering treatments allow a very good fracture resistance to 
be recovered. The mechanisms involved in tempering are detailed by Grange et al. 
(1977) and Krauss (1999). Below 100°C, carbon atoms in super saturation in the 
matrix segregate at dislocations, and at 150°C, they precipitate in the form of ε
or η iron carbides. Retained austenite then decomposes into iron carbides and ferrite 
(200°C). Between 250°C and 400°C, ε or η carbides transform into cementite, 
which then coalesces above 400°C. These microstructural changes result in a 
progressive improvement in fracture toughness accompanied by a decrease in 
strength. This trade-off is illustrated in Figure 3.14, based on data obtained by Horn Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 91 
et al. (1978) on an AISI 4340 steel with a composition of 0.41% C, 0.8% Mn, 0.79% 
Cr, and 1.75% Ni. On this curve, the phenomenon of temper embrittlement of the 
martensite (here around 275°C) clearly appears. It is due to the precipitation of 
cementite or ε carbides at lath or grain boundaries, and to the possible presence of 
retained austenite between the laths, which can be transformed into martensite 
during deformation. Fracture then generally occurs by cleavage. For higher 
tempering temperatures (>400°C), a second embrittlement phenomenon can occur, 
linked to the segregation of impurities (P, Sn, Sb, As) at the grain boundaries. In this 
case, fracture becomes intergranular (see section 3.3.3). 
Figure 3.14. Evolution of the strength/ fracture toughness combination of 
a 0.41% C quenched and tempered steel (according to Horn et al. 1978) 
The commercial ultra-high-strength steels with the best strength/toughness 
trade-off are maraging steels, whose name is a contraction of martensite aging (see 
Passarelo et al. 2021 for a recent review). These steels were developed starting in the 
1970s. They contain very little carbon (<0.03%) and their very high strength is 
achieved by the intense precipitation (volume fraction of 10%) of fine (down to a 
few nanometers) intermetallic compounds during aging, which occurs at 
temperatures between 400°C and 600°C. The very high strength is related to a 
precipitate density of up to 107
 particles/µm3
. This aging precipitation strengthening 
mechanism is also used in martensitic carbon steels when alloyed with Mo, Cr or V. 
In this case, the precipitates that form are chromium (Cr7C3), molybdenum (Mo2C) 
and vanadium (VC) carbides during aging treatments at 500–600°C. 92 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Initially, in maraging steels, the use of nickel in large quantities (18%) was 
proposed to benefit from the favorable effect of this element on cleavage fracture. 
Other elements have been added (Co, Mo, Ti) mainly to obtain compounds of the 
Ni3(Ti,Mo) or (Fe,Co)2Mo type for example. These steels are called MXXX (M300, 
for example, where 300 represents the UTS in ksi, to be multiplied by 6.9 to convert 
into MPa). The resulting properties range from (1500MPa – 200 MPa√m) to 
(2800 MPa – 30 MPa√m). The alloying elements are added in large amounts 
(Ni: 13–18%, Co: 8–15%, Mo 3–10%, Ti 0–2%), which requires long processing 
and homogenization times. Moreover, the content of residual elements (S, P, as well 
as C) must be very low, which requires successive steelmaking processes (vacuum 
induction melting, vacuum arc remelting or electroslag remelting). This implies that 
the price of these steels is high, but they remain indispensable for strategic 
applications related to nuclear power generation, defense and aeronautics. 
Despite their long-lasting development history, work is continuing to optimize 
the microstructures of these martensitic steels, with the dual objective of improving 
strength and fracture toughness. 
The limitation of the residual contents (P, S, N) is a first axis of development 
which further reduces the inclusion content (TiN, MnS), which, as we have 
described in section 3.2, influences damage nucleation mechanisms in both fracture 
modes, namely, ductile and transgranular cleavage. This also reduces the risk of 
intergranular fracture by boundary segregation of impurities. These improvements 
require advanced technological developments of steelmaking processes. 
Microstructure refinement is also an important area. In carbon martensitic 
microstructures, by refining the austenitic grain before quenching, the constitutive 
elements of martensite (blocks, packets) are also refined. For this purpose, the use of 
micro-alloying or an optimization of the thermomechanical treatment are 
recommended. This size reduction has a beneficial effect (see section 3.3.1) on the 
resistance to crack propagation. This effect has been analyzed, for example, by 
Wang et al. (2007) in low-alloyed 0.2% C martensitic steels. A continuous 
improvement of the impact toughness (Charpy fracture energy at 77 K) is measured 
when the grain size is reduced. The effect is very pronounced when the grain size is 
reduced from 11 to 6 µm, resulting in an increase in Charpy energy from 20 to 45 J. 
The effect is attributed to a reduction in the size of the martensite packets. In 
martensitic steels with higher carbon content (0.61% C), a drastic reduction in 
martensite brittleness was also recently reported by Sun et al. (2017). In this case, 
the authors attributed the improvement to the suppression of twinned martensite that 
forms when the C content exceeds 0.5%. Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 93 
The effect of austenitizing temperature (a pathway to change grain size) was 
recently studied by Lima et al. (2021) on a M300 maraging steel. In this case, 
increasing the austenite grain size promotes the formation of lath martensite. During 
the fracture toughness test, deformation accommodation is then possible, which 
explains the improvement in fracture toughness as the grain size increases. Note that 
this process does not occur during Charpy testing (at higher strain rates) and that the 
Charpy fracture energy drops with increasing grain size. From Figure 3.15, the 
correlation between these two parameters is not monotonic. This clearly illustrates 
the conclusion of section 3.2 about the appropriate choice of fracture resistance 
measurement methods. 
Figure 3.15. Effect of increasing austenitization temperature 
on the fracture resistance of an M300 steel (Lima 2021) 
Figure 3.16. Local damage at the interface of a wide martensite lath 
in a 0.2% C–2.5% Mn plain carbon steel (from Morsdorf et al. 2016) 94 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Other ways of development to improve the strength versus fracture toughness 
trade-off include control of retained austenite (quantity and morphology), 
optimization of the precipitation of iron carbides and intermetallic compounds 
(fineness and strength of the interface with the matrix), and improvement of the 
homogeneity of the microstructure. As an example, Figure 3.16 illustrates that the 
presence of coarse martensite laths (the first ones formed during quenching) results 
in interfacial damage related to associated strain heterogeneities (Morsdorf et al. 
2016). 
3.4.2. Fracture resistance of multiphase grades 
The previous section shows that it is possible to combine very good strength and 
fracture toughness. However, the steels presented there have a limited forming 
ability, and they are used after hot forming followed by a metallurgical treatment to 
obtain the final microstructures. In order to respond to applications requiring high 
forming capacities (e.g. cold forming for the automotive industry) while offering 
high-strength levels, it has been essential to develop new generations of multiphase 
high-strength steels, including DP steels, TRIP steels and more recently Q&P steels. 
Before detailing the associated mechanisms and the proposed metallurgical 
solutions, it is important to recall that the measurement of fracture toughness 𝐾ூ௖ is 
not possible in automotive steel sheets whose thickness can be less than 1 mm. Plane 
strain conditions (section 3.2.3) cannot be ensured. Initially proposed by Cotterell 
and Reddel in 1977, the measurement of the essential work of fracture on a notched 
specimen of the DENT (Double Edge Notched Tension) type has progressively 
become prominent to study the fracture resistance of sheets and to evaluate the 
fracture toughness under plane stress conditions.
3.4.2.1. DP steels 
Chapter 1 describes how the addition of a martensitic phase in a ferritic matrix 
has been the basis for the development of multiphase grades and has allowed good 
forming abilities to be achieved through high work hardening coefficients. In order 
to move on to the industrial and commercial deployment of these steels, steelmakers 
had to address the following problem: ensuring excellent fracture resistance of the 
multiphase steels developed in order to achieve very good strength/forming ability 
compromises (Figure 3.1). 
An illustration of this problem is given by Fonstein (2016) based on her work 
conducted on a low alloy 0.06% C steel bearing Cr, Mo and Ni. With this 
composition, a martensitic steel has a fracture toughness of 150 MPa√m together Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 95 
with a strength of 1100 MPa. With an austenitization heat treatment at 750°C, the 
steel is ferritic-martensitic with good forming ability, a strength of 700 MPa, but its 
fracture toughness drops to 120 MPa√m. This trend of reduction in both toughness 
and strength perfectly demonstrates the challenge of developing very high strength, 
formable carbon steels with good fracture toughness. 
The introduction of martensite in the ferritic matrix induces deformation 
incompatibilities between these two constituents and stress concentrations related to 
morphological irregularities. Two main fracture initiation mechanisms have been 
reported in the literature: fracture by martensite cleavage and fracture by decohesion 
at the ferrite-martensite interfaces. The comprehensive literature review by Tasan 
et al. (2015) shows that these two mechanisms coexist in industrial DP steels (Figure 
3.17) for which the ferritic grain size is generally less than 5 µm and the martensite 
content, for grades up to 980 MPa, less than 60%. 
Figure 3.17. Damage initiation mechanisms in 
dual-phase steels (from Tasan et al. 2015) 
Due to the presence of the ductile ferritic matrix, this damage does not lead to 
sudden and brittle fracture. Indeed, the cracks created are blunted due to the plastic 
deformation of ferrite and the mechanism leading to fracture is of ductile type by 
nucleation, growth and coalescence of cavities. 96 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The kinetics of damage occurrence is the critical step, which must be controlled 
as a priority to improve the fracture resistance of DP steels. Different solutions have 
been implemented during the industrial development of these steels. 
The difference in hardness between the constituents is the source of strain 
incompatibilities. Several approaches have been applied, sometimes in combination, 
to reduce this parameter. Low-temperature tempering softens the martensite without 
impacting the strength too much. A detailed study by Pushkareva et al. (2013) shows 
that beyond the direct effect of the drop of martensite hardness, local changes in the 
ferrite/martensite interface chemistry, including the carbon diffusion profile, help 
explain some of the improved fracture toughness. A refinement of the ferrite grain 
size strengthens the matrix and reduces the gap with the martensite. The impact is 
less significant than the effect of tempering, but microstructural refinement has other 
beneficial impacts, such as an effect on the plasticity of martensite and on the 
fracture resistance of ferrite. For this reason, fine-grained DP steels have been 
developed (with the use of micro-alloying or adaptation of the thermomechanical 
treatment). Finally, martensite can be partially replaced by bainite by cleverly 
adapting the heat treatment, for example with a bainitic step during continuous 
annealing (Fonstein 2011). This mitigates deformation incompatibilities between 
martensite and bainite, and the amount of bainite must be limited to avoid losing the 
work hardening capabilities of DP steels. 
Another lever is the morphological optimization of the microstructure and in 
particular of the martensite arrangement. For example, banded structures are 
detrimental to damage, as they have almost continuous martensite zones. These 
should be minimized by limiting chemical segregations during continuous casting. 
This is done, for example, by applying a small amount of strain during solidification 
(soft reduction), which reduces the sink of liquid steel (enriched with alloying 
elements) in the center of the slab and then of the sheet in the final product. It is not 
possible to reduce the chemical segregations that cause band formation to zero; 
however, Krebs et al. (2011) showed that optimizing thermal cycling and control of 
ferritic transformation upon cooling can limit the impact of these segregations on 
martensite band formation. Still regarding the morphology of the microstructure, a 
recent study by Ismail et al. (2021) showed that, in DP steels where the martensite 
islands had an elongated fibrous shape (known as Thomas fibers), the cracking 
resistance was improved compared to steels where the martensite was equiaxed. 
This remarkable improvement is associated with a better resistance to damage 
propagation due to the fine size of the fibers and their progressive alignment during 
deformation. In terms of morphological optimization, it is important to remember 
that only three-dimensional observations can describe this morphology. It is Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 97 
important to keep in mind that these observations are relatively long and expensive, 
so that conclusions are often given on the basis of two-dimensional sections only. 
3.4.2.2. TRIP steels 
The damage mechanisms in TRIP steels bring an additional complexity 
compared to DP steels. These steels contain a fraction of retained austenite 
(generally between 10 and 15%), which is present in two forms: laths, resulting from 
the bainitic transformation, or equiaxed. In the latter case, it is frequently associated 
with martensite formed during the final cooling and is then referred to as MA islands 
(for martensite-austenite). 
During plastic deformation, this carbon-rich austenite (up to 1–1.5% C) 
gradually transforms into fresh martensite. When the transformation has taken place, 
the damage mechanisms observed are the same as for a DP steel (ferrite-bainite￾martensite). The complexity of the analysis comes from the fact that the austenite 
transformation kinetics depends on its intrinsic parameters (size, local chemical 
composition, surrounding matrix, etc.), but also on the characteristics of the 
mechanical loading (stress triaxiality, loading rate, etc.). 
A clear illustration is given by Lacroix et al. (2008) with toughness tests on TRIP 
steels (0.15–0.4% C, 1.5% Mn and 1.5% Si) optimized with respect to the trade-off 
between strength and elongation. The volume fraction of residual austenite increases 
with the carbon content from 10% to 34%. On fatigue precracked DENT specimens, 
the fracture toughness at crack initiation decreases (from 135 to 35 kJ/m2
) as the 
austenite content increases. At the crack tip, during mechanical loading, austenite 
transforms into fresh martensite due to the high amount of strain and triaxial 
stresses, independently of its stability. As in DP steels, martensite plays a key role in 
the damage process by creating defects mainly at the fresh ferrite/martensite 
interfaces, which provide a preferential path for crack propagation. The decrease of 
the fracture toughness at crack initiation is explained by a higher amount of 
transformed martensite and by a higher connectivity of this phase as the volume 
fraction increases (in the case of steel at 0.15% C, martensite is not connected). 
During crack propagation, the resistance to shear ductile fracture is characterized by 
the essential work of fracture (Cotterell and Reddel 1977). In this case, higher 
austenite stability improves performance because of the additional strain-hardening 
capacity that austenite provides in the necking region that develops during crack 
propagation. 
3.4.2.3. Third generation ultra-high-strength steels 
To further improve the compromise between strength and elongation (Figure 
3.1), third-generation steels are being developed and the first ones (with a strength 98 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
of 1000–1200 MPa) are already on the market. The proposed path for TRIP steels is 
being pursued, increasing the retained austenite content to values of 30–40%. For 
this purpose, and compared to TRIP steels, an optimization of the chemistry (e.g. by 
addition of C and/or Mn at constant Si/Al ratio) as well as the heat treatment (e.g. 
interrupted quenching treatment followed reheating/holding as for Q&P grades) is 
proposed. The matrix of these steels is mainly martensitic. Similar concepts are 
being investigated to improve the performance of the quenched and tempered steels 
described in the previous section, with applications in plates, hot forged and 
heat-treated long products. A recent review article was published by Sugimoto 
(2021) about these advanced martensitic steels. 
The damage initiation processes are similar to those encountered in first￾generation steels, as we also find the multiphase character, the hardness differences 
between the constituents, the presence of numerous interfaces. Figure 3.18 illustrates 
some of these mechanisms in a third-generation steel. 
Figure 3.18. Damage initiation mechanisms in a Q&P steel 
(0.3C-1.5Si-2.5Mn) austenitized at 900°C, quenched down to 260°C 
and reheated at 400°C for 500 s (ArcelorMittal picture, T. Dieudonné et al.) 
As with TRIP steels, control of retained austenite is necessary to achieve the best 
resistance to damage, in conjunction with its mechanical stability. Recent studies 
(Xiong 2019) have shown that there is an optimum. Gradually increasing the 
residual austenite content improves the fracture toughness at crack initiation in a 
0.3C-1.5Si-2Mn-0.8Cr steel (compared to the same steel, but quenched and Compromise between Strength and Fracture Resistance 99 
tempered), but then a drop occurs as the content is further increased. Beyond the 
austenite content, this is explained by the change in morphology with a higher 
amount of coarse, equiaxed austenite which induces, after transformation, a network 
of brittle phases that can lead to intergranular type fracture.
In these advanced steels, a fracture mode not dominated by the nucleation, 
growth and coalescence of cavities frequently appears. Fracture is initiated by the 
appearance of plastic strain localization bands, for a critical amount of strain that 
conditions the ductility of the material. The deformation localizes and gives rise to a 
final fracture through the development of cavities. This problem is currently an open 
question and a research subject, to understand what triggers localization rather than 
damage, despite the high level of stresses and the large number of interfaces in these 
microstructures. The high number of parameters to be taken into account, both 
microstructural and related to the mechanical loading conditions, explains the 
complexity of the studies to be implemented to progress in this direction. Finally, it 
should be noted that this strain localization before fracture has already been 
encountered in second-generation steels (see section 3.2.1). 
3.5. Conclusion and outlook 
The optimization of the toughness of high-strength steels has made remarkable 
progress over the last decades for all market applications and all families of steel 
products. This progress has been possible thanks to academic and industrial research 
on the subject, which has taken into account the different aspects of the problem: 
understanding the impact of mechanical loading to ensure that the conclusions 
obtained are transposable to real use, taking into account the difference between 
fracture toughness, ductility and impact toughness, studying the mechanisms that 
explain the role of the microstructure on the damage and fracture modes, and 
implementing industrial solutions to control the microstructures during the steel 
making and manufacturing process. 
Not all problems have been solved, and the development of new steels regularly 
brings its share of new questions that must be solved to continue in this direction. 
Among these, let us mention the control of the strength of interphase boundaries in 
connection with the segregation of chemical elements, the understanding of the 
effect of the three-dimensional morphology of microstructures or the fracture by 
strain localization and shearing. 100 New Advanced High Strength Steels

4.1. Toughness: the main cause of part failure in service 
Material fatigue is the major cause of failure of mechanical parts subjected to 
varying loads over time. Steel parts are no exception. Famous accidents, such as the 
Meudon railway disaster in 1842, due to the failure of the front axle of the 
locomotive (de Bauziat 1842), or the capsizing of the Norwegian oil platform 
Alexander L. Kielland in 1980, due to the failure of one of the five support legs 
(Norwegian Public Commission 1981), caused hundreds of deaths and highlighted 
the major risk of the fatigue phenomena. In the case of helicopters, fatigue is the 
cause of 55% of failures. Transmission parts, such as gears and bearings, mostly 
made of steel, are the first victims of fatigue (Davies et al. 2013). Fatigue is a 
progressive, localized and permanent change in the material making up a part. It is 
caused by a mechanical loading that varies over time at a stress well below the 
material’s ultimate tensile strength or even its yield strength. It leads to the failure of 
the part following three stages: (i) the initiation of cracks, (ii) their propagation and 
in particular that of a main crack leading to (iii) the final failure. 104 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The search for improved fatigue properties, in contrast to ultimate tensile 
strength or ductility, has not been at the heart of the development of new steels. This 
can be explained by the fact that, in general, the search for an increase in ultimate 
tensile strength is also very beneficial for fatigue strength. The compromise between 
ultimate tensile strength and fatigue strength is therefore simple: at first glance, it is 
not necessary to make any! Does this rule always apply? In the case of very high 
strength steels, deviations from this rule appear: the role of surface and internal 
defects sometimes becomes decisive. Are not other properties such as yield strength 
or crack propagation threshold more relevant to compare with fatigue properties? 
Moreover, if metallurgy affects the fatigue properties of a mechanical system, these 
properties are also strongly dependent on the geometry of the part, the 
manufacturing process and the assembly methods. Specific processes can then be 
implemented to improve the resistance of parts to wear. 
In this chapter, we will start by giving a synthesis of the fundamental knowledge 
of material fatigue phenomena (section 4.2). The reader will understand the 
specificities of fatigue failure and the main physical mechanisms associated with it. 
The metallurgical ways to improve the fatigue properties will be seen in section 4.3. 
The reader will discover, as in the other chapters and properties, that the 
combination and spatial arrangement of phases with contrasting mechanical 
properties and various plastic deformation mechanisms allow an improvement of 
fatigue performance in the area of crack initiation and propagation. The detrimental 
role of defects (surface, porosity, inclusion) on the fatigue properties will be 
discussed in section 4.4. Finally, we will see some surface treatments specifically 
implemented to improve the fatigue properties (section 4.5). 
For a more in-depth reading of characterization methods and fatigue phenomena, 
the reader may refer to the following works (Suresh 1998; Rabbe et al. 2000; 
Bathias and Pineau 2010; Flavenot et al. 2014; Zerbst et al. 2016; Galtier et al. 
2019).
4.2. Fatigue: from crack initiation to failure 
4.2.1. Approaches to determine the risk of failure through mechanical 
fatigue 
4.2.1.1. Applied loading 
To characterize the fatigue properties of a material, a periodic cyclic loading in 
stress or in deformation is applied. In the case of stress loading, it is characterized by Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 105 
its period T or frequency, a mean stress 𝜎௠, zero, positive or negative, and a variable 
component, very often sinusoidal or triangular. Thus, the important characteristics of 
a stress cycle are as follows (see Figure 4.1): 
– the maximum 𝜎௠௔௫ and minimum 𝜎௠௜௡ stresses; 
– the stress amplitude 𝜎௔ = 1 2 (𝜎௠௔௫ െ 𝜎௠௜௡ ⁄ ); 
– the mean stress 𝜎௠ =1 2⁄ (𝜎௠௔௫ ൅ 𝜎௠௜௡); 
– the stress ratio 𝑅=𝜎௠௜௡⁄𝜎௠௔௫. 
Figure 4.1. Parameters used to 
characterize the cyclic loading 
4.2.1.2. Wöhler curves and fatigue strength 
A first approach to determine if there is a risk of fatigue failure consists of 
applying a cyclic loading to a smooth specimen (i.e. not notched) with a zero mean 
stress and a given stress amplitude. The loading is maintained until the specimen 
breaks. The number of cycles required to break the specimen is then recorded. A test 
with a new specimen, but for a different stress amplitude, is then performed. A new 
number of cycles to fracture is obtained. Several data are thus obtained. Given the 
local phenomenon of fatigue, the experimental results show a strong dispersion (two 
specimens subjected to the same level of stress will not have the same lifetimes). 
Using a regression model, the S-N curve (stress – number of cycles to failure), also 
known as the Wöhler curve, is plotted, giving the number of cycles to failure for 
each stress amplitude (see Figure 4.2). Fatigue strength for a given cycle life N is 
defined as the stress amplitude leading to specimen failure for N cycles. There are 106 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
three domains of fatigue: low cycle fatigue1
, typically < 10ସ, high cycle fatigue for 
10ସ < 𝑁 < 10଻, also called endurance fatigue2
, and fatigue at a very high number of 
cycles, 𝑁 > 10଻, also called giga cycle fatigue3
. The majority of mechanical 
systems are designed for a life corresponding to endurance fatigue. For this reason, 
we will focus on this domain by discussing the impact of metallurgy on the endurance 
limit or life for 10ସ < 𝑁 < 10଻. In the following, except for explicitly mentioned 
cases, we will use the 2×106
 fatigue strength property, 𝜎௙, as classically used in the 
automotive industry. We consider that there is no risk of fatigue failure if the material 
is subjected to a stress amplitude lower than 𝜎௙. In the regime of endurance fatigue on 
smooth specimen, the life is mainly controlled by the crack initiation stage.

geometrical defect (scratch, notch, hole, abrupt change of section, fillet) or an 
internal defect (porosity, inclusion, decohesion), the fatigue crack initiation stage

can be considerably reduced and the life span is then controlled by the crack 
propagation stage. Experimental measurements have shown that the propagation rate 
of the so-called long crack, which causes the failure of the specimen (whose length 
is about 10 times larger than the grain size), 𝑑𝑎 𝑑𝑁 ⁄ (expressed in mm per cycle), 
increases with the variation of the stress intensity factor, ∆𝐾. This factor reflects the 
intensity of loading at the tip of a crack of length 𝑎. Its expression is given in 
Chapter 3. This correlation, presented schematically in Figure 4.3, illustrates three 
regimes. The main regime (regime II) follows a linear dependence in a log-log 
diagram, modeled by the Paris law. Regime I, at low ∆𝐾, defines the ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ of 
propagation of the long crack. Regime III, at high ∆𝐾, reflects increasingly rapid 
propagation leading to sudden failure of the specimen when the stress intensity 
factor reaches the toughness 𝐾ூ஼ (see Chapter 3). Note that the calculation of ∆𝐾
assumes that the plastic zone at the crack tip remains very small in front of the crack 
size and that the material keeps a globally elastic response (linear elastic fracture 
mechanics [LEFM] approach). In this approach, it is considered that there is no 
risk of fatigue failure as long as there is no propagation of a long crack, that 
is, ∆𝐾 < ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ. ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ is defined when the propagation rate is equal 
to 10ି଼ mm/cycle (Taylor 1989).

4.2.2. Crack initiation mechanisms 
In the endurance fatigue domain, the stresses at the specimen scale are lower 
than the yield strength. Nevertheless, locally, some areas of the material, because 
they are more conducive to plastic deformation (large grains, grains favorably 
oriented for plasticity, grains on the surface) or because they are close to a 
heterogeneity generating strong deformation incompatibilities (presence of a defect 
or a phase that is stiffer and/or harder than the matrix) or because they are located 
more generally in a zone of higher concentration of stresses, are going to be the 
place of dislocation movement and microplasticity. Microplastic crystallographic 
slip at each cycle is small, but it accumulates into persistent slip bands over the 
course of cycles. The slip bands emerging on the surface are the seat of microcrack 
initiation. We understand that all the mechanisms seen in Chapter 1 – and in 
particular any reduction of the mean free path of dislocations by microstructural 
obstacles – which postpone to the highest stresses the appearance of plastic 
deformation will contribute a priori to increase the fatigue strength. In this approach, 
one must not forget that if the yield strength is a property determined at the 
macroscopic scale of a specimen, the microplasticity is very local and is also 
strongly linked to the presence of defects/stress concentrators. 
4.2.3. Crack propagation mechanisms 
4.2.3.1. Short cracks 
The appearance of microcracks usually occurs in several areas of the material. 
These microcracks, also called short cracks, propagate first along the persistent slip 
bands and are therefore crystallographic in nature. This stage of propagation is 
called stage I. The propagation is stopped at the grain boundary. Its continuation 
requires the formation of a new plastic zone at the crack tip. When the adjacent 
grains are not too disoriented, the formation of this plastic zone and the propagation 
are easy. When the disorientations are stronger, it is necessary to wait until the stress 
concentration due to the accumulation of dislocations at the grain boundary is high 
enough to activate the movement of dislocations in the next grain and allow the 
crack to cross the grain boundary. 
Thus, short cracks propagate irregularly because they are slowed by other grain 
boundaries (as illustrated schematically in Figure 4.4a) or by other microstructural 
barriers (precipitates, hard phase, etc.). Their propagation rate 𝑑𝑎 𝑑𝑁 ⁄ measured at 
the microstructure scale exhibits slowdowns and accelerations controlled by the Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 109 
microstructural barriers (Figure 4.4b). Beyond a certain length, the driving force of 
the propagation increases and the propagation is less and less slowed down by the 
microstructure. The propagation is in stage II: the crack propagates perpendicular to 
the direction of stress (see Figure 4.4a). The transition from stage I to stage II 
requires that the crack grows in depth but also in width through several 
microstructural barriers. This transition accounts for a large part (most) of the low 
stress life and is the major component of the fatigue strength of a material (Miller 
1993). It enables defining two critical crack sizes: the critical length d, called 
microstructural threshold, corresponding to the characteristic distance between 
the strongest microstructural barriers (which mark the transition between short 
non-propagating cracks and short propagating cracks) and the critical length 𝑎௡௢௖௜௙, 
corresponding to the length necessary for the crack to propagate in stage II (see 
Figure 4.4b). These two critical lengths depend on the microstructure and hardness 
of the steels, but, in general, cracks are considered short when their length varies 
between the grain size and 10 times the grain size. Figure 4.4b can be derived from 
Figure 4.4c, where the abscissa is now ∆K, which is known to be estimated for long 
cracks from linear elastic fracture mechanics (see Chapter 3). ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ is 
associated with 𝑎௡௢௖௜௙ (see section 4.2.4, equation [4.2]). Unlike long cracks, short
cracks can propagate at ∆K < ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ, but in this case we do not really know 
how to evaluate the value of ∆K.

as (b) for long cracks, but as a function of ∆𝐾 (adapted from Junet 2021 and Miller 
1993) 110 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
4.2.3.2. Long cracks 
When a crack propagates in stage II, it already has a large size (~10 times the 
grain size). If there are several zones of short crack initiation and propagation in the 
material, a single crack, usually propagating faster than the others, leads to the 
failure of the specimen. It is called main long crack. Its propagation rate is measured 
on a macroscopic scale. It represents an average value controlled by the driving 
force ∆K according to the curve given in Figures 4.3 and 4.4c. At the microscopic 
level, the rate can exhibit fluctuations related to the presence of microstructural 
barriers for ∆K, especially for values near ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ (Figure 4.4c). As the long 
crack advances, the driving force ∆K increases and the crack feels the 
microstructural barriers less and less. The rate fluctuations decrease and the velocity 
then follows the Paris law (see section 4.2.1.3). The tip of a long crack, like any 
defect, is a stress concentration zone. In ductile materials, the stresses are high 
enough to generate plastic deformations creating a plastic zone at the crack tip. 
During the unloading step of the cycle, the plastic zone becomes compressed, 
creating a closure effect (Elber 1971). In addition, the crack becomes blunted. These 
two effects lead to a reduction in the driving force for propagation. Thus, the rate of 
propagation in stage II depends on the stress field at the crack tip. This in turn 
depends on the cyclic strain hardening properties of the steel and not directly on the 
monotonic tensile properties. Cyclic strain softening induces lower stresses and 
slows down the crack propagation. It is then consistent to find that the propagation 
rate of a long crack does not depend significantly on the characteristic size of the 
microstructure, except when ∆𝐾is small and close to ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ. In this last case, 
the long crack finds characteristics of short cracks: it propagates through the plastic 
zone of size close to the characteristic size of the microstructure, it follows a sinuous 
path imposed by a crystallographic break through the grains and/or a propagation 
deviated by the presence of microstructural barriers. Thus, this path produces a crack 
surface whose roughness and asperities increase with the grain size or the distance 
between the microstructural barriers. This roughness creates an additional closure4
effect that makes propagation more difficult. Thus, it is found that the propagation 
threshold increases with grain size. However, the link between the microstructure 
and the value of ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ is not as clearly established as for the plasticity 
mechanisms. Thus, ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ depends on grain size, chemical composition of 
grain boundaries, cyclic strength, but the impact of these decreases with increasing 
stress ratio R. Moreover, in the case of high strength steels, ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ is also

crack tip. Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 111

embrittlement of grain boundaries (see Chapter 9; Ritchie 1979; Suresh 1998). 
4.2.4. Increasing the ultimate tensile strength or the propagation 
threshold? Approach of Kitagawa–Takahashi for the harmfulness of a 
defect 
We have seen previously that the initiation of cracks could occur in the matrix 
(grains favorable to plasticity) or on defects (inclusions, porosity). The Kitagawa–
Takahashi diagram shows the harmfulness of a defect on the fatigue strength (see 
Figure 4.5).
When “small” defects are not harmful, crack initiation occurs in the matrix. It is 
its mechanical properties that control the fatigue strength: the harder the matrix, the 
higher σ୤ is. 
For steels, the following relationship is observed experimentally: 
𝜎௙ = 𝛽 × 𝑈𝑇𝑆 [4.1] 
where 𝑈𝑇𝑆 is in first approximation the ultimate tensile strength of the matrix. 
Large defects are strong stress concentrators and promote crack initiation and 
propagation. They control the fatigue strength. The crack initiation is very fast. The 
defect is assimilated to a crack of size initially equal to that of the defect. The 
defect/crack then behaves like a long crack (see section 4.2.3.2). The fatigue 
strength is related to the propagation threshold and decreases with the size of the 
defect according to the relation: 
𝜎௙ = 𝛾∆𝐾௦௘௨௜௟/√𝜋𝑎 [4.2] 
The intersection between the two lines described by equations [4.1] and [4.2] in 
Figure 4.5 gives the critical size 𝑎௡௢௖௜௙ beyond which a defect is harmful and 
controls the fatigue strength. It can be seen that increasing the propagation threshold 
increases 𝑎௡௢௖௜௙. On the contrary, increasing 𝑈𝑇𝑆 leads to a decrease in this critical 
size. In this case, the fatigue strength becomes increasingly sensitive to the presence 
of defects and decreases from that expected by equation [4.1]. 112 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The trade-off between mechanical strength and fatigue life is not so simple and 
deserves to be discussed in the following sections.

Figure 4.6 shows the evolution of 𝜎௙ as a function of 𝑈𝑇𝑆 for a set of high and 
very high strength steels from most steel classes. These data were collected by 
Cetim and are available in Cetim’s Fatigue collection (Flavenot et al. 2014). It is 
observed that 𝜎௙ increases with 𝑈𝑇𝑆, but the slope 𝛽 of this relationship (see 
equation [4.1]) decreases from 0.5 to 0.2 for UTS ranging from 300–1000 MPa to 
1000–1200 MPa. Furthermore, the dispersion of 𝜎௙ for a given 𝑈𝑇𝑆 increases for 
large values of 𝑈𝑇𝑆, indicating that equation [4.1] is no longer reliable for values of 
𝑈𝑇𝑆 > ~1200 MPa. Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 113

to 2000 MPa were quenched and tempered 
4.3.1.2. Ultimate tensile strength or yield strength? 
Table 4.1 compares the plastic properties, 𝑌𝑆 and 𝑈𝑇𝑆, and 𝜎௙ for two hot rolled 
steels from different families. The DP780 steel is a dual-phase (DP) family steel 
consisting of a ferritic matrix with grains with an average diameter around 4 µm and 
martensite islands mainly located at the ferrite grain boundaries and with a volume 
fraction of about 20% (see Appendix). The yield strength is quite low (528 MPa) 
and the 𝑌𝑆/𝑈𝑇𝑆 ratio (~0.5) is also low, showing a good workability. The latter 
results from the multiplication of dislocations in the ferrite. Martensite has very little 
plastic deformation. CP800 steel is a multiphase steel containing mainly granular 
bainite (80–95%), ferrite (less than 20%) and some cementite. The yield strength of 
bainite is higher than that of ferrite. Indeed, bainite is a fine structure made of 
cementite platelets (needles) and ferrite rich in dislocations. The fineness of the 
platelets and the high dislocation density of ferrite explain the higher hardness of 
bainite compared to ferrite in DP steels. As a result, the yield strength of CP800 is 
higher than that of DP780. On the other hand, the higher density of dislocations in 
the ferrite reduces the work hardening capacity of CP800, leading to a 𝑌𝑆/𝑈𝑇𝑆 ratio 
reaching 0.9. Under forming stress, plastic deformation is localized at relatively low

strain values and results in a wide necking zone favorable to the bending process and 
hole expansion (see Chapter 8). In contrast, DP780 steel has a wider uniform plastic 
deformation capacity, favorable for processes such as stamping. Thus, these two 
steels have different yield strengths, ductilities and strain hardening rates for a 
similar 𝑈𝑇𝑆.

Table 4.1. Comparison of plastic properties and fatigue 
strength of a DP780 steel and a CP800 steel (R = 1) 
What about their fatigue strength? Table 4.1 shows that CP800 steel has a better 
fatigue strength than DP780 steel, but the 𝜎௙/𝑌𝑆 ratio is about the same. This better 
fatigue strength is due to the higher yield strength of CP800, as the local activation 
of plasticity required for short crack initiation requires the application of a higher 
stress (see section 4.4.2.). This example shows that although the value of UTS is 
used to quickly estimate 𝜎௙ using equation [4.1], from a mechanism perspective, the 
relevant plastic property is the yield strength. From the perspective of improving 
fatigue strength through metallurgy, it is therefore on the possible ways to increase 
YS that we will first focus in the following section. 
4.3.2. Postpone the crack initiation or activation of plasticity to the 
highest stresses 
4.3.2.1. Effect of a second hard phase on fatigue strength: case of dual￾phase ferrito-martensitic steels 
As previously mentioned, DP steels (developed for deep drawing) have a fairly 
low yield strength and a high strain hardening rate, producing good ductility and 
high ultimate tensile strength. The yield strength is proportional to the martensite 
fraction (Chapter 1). As shown in Figure 4.7, the same is true of the fatigue strength 
and 𝜎௙⁄𝑌𝑆 ≅ 0.3. This figure gathers data from different DPs produced by 
ArcelorMittal. At imposed strain, the stress in martensite is higher than that in 
ferrite. During cyclic fatigue loading, for a given stress amplitude, the plastic 
activity in the ferrite during the crack initiation phase is therefore reduced compared Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 115 
to the case of a fully ferritic steel. The DP steel is therefore able to withstand a 
higher stress amplitude and has a better fatigue strength than a purely ferritic steel. 
The higher the volume fraction of martensite, the greater this effect.

evolution of σf (R = 1) and martensite volume fraction with YS0.2
4.3.2.2. Effect of precipitates on fatigue strength: case of bainitic steels 
containing vanadium 
Vanadium bearing steel 35MnCrV5 is used for hot forged parts. It is formed in 
the austenitic range and then cooled in air. The austenite then transforms to bainite, 
which gives the steel high yield strength, high ultimate strength and good ductility. 
Table 4.2 compares 𝑌𝑆଴.ଶ, 𝑈𝑇𝑆 and 𝜎௙ for 35MnCrV5 steel after normalization 
treatment alone or followed by tempering at 600°C. The normalization treatment 
simulates the hot forging step followed by air quenching. For applications where an 
even higher 𝑌𝑆 is required an additional tempering at 600°C is carried out. This 
causes the precipitation of vanadium carbides. This results in an increase in yield 
strength with a similar ultimate strength and a lower ductility. Table 4.2 shows that 
secondary precipitation hardening produces an increase in fatigue strength, since 
activation of microplasticity requires higher stresses. Note that this example again 
shows that yield strength is more appropriate than ultimate tensile strength for 
estimating the impact of metallurgy on 𝜎௙. 116 New Advanced High Strength Steels

4.3.2.3. Effect of a pre-strain on the fatigue strength: case of an austenitic 
iron-manganese steel with TWIP effect 
In the search for steels combining high strength and good ductility, austenitic 
manganese steels present a quite exceptional compromise (see Appendix). The latter 
is attributed to the deformation mechanism by twinning, which causes a high strain 
hardening rate: the twins formed are new obstacles to the movement of dislocations 
and thus reduce their mean free path (see Chapter 1). This results in a high ultimate 
tensile strength (>1000 MPa). The yield strength of these steels is quite low and 
often lower than that of DP steels. The 𝑌𝑆 𝑈𝑇𝑆 ⁄ ≅ 0.3 ratio leads to a fatigue 
strength that is also quite low (Wang et al. 2015). One proposed possibility to 
increase the yield strength is to preform and thus harden this type of steel, which has 
a high strain hardening capacity. Table 4.2 illustrates the effect of pre-straining on 
𝑌𝑆, 𝑈𝑇𝑆 and 𝜎௙ of Fe-30Mn-0.9C steel subjected to tensile pre-strain ranging from 
30 to 70% before fatigue loading (Wang et al. 2015). As expected, the yield strength 
increases very strongly with pre-strain. It increases by a factor varying between 2 
and 5. The fatigue strength also increases, but by a smaller factor, around 1.4–1.5. It 
should be noted that the ratio 𝜎௙/𝑌𝑆 varies between 0.7 and 0.2 and decreases with 
the increase in the yield strength. During the pre-strain, numerous twins are 
generated. The volume fraction of twins increases, but its progression slows down 
with the deformation to reach a saturation value. Simultaneously, the density of 
dislocations increases, but also reaches a saturation value with deformation. These 
two mechanisms explain the increase in the yield strength which slows down with 
the pre-strain. During cyclic fatigue loading in the endurance range, the plastic 
stresses and strains are too low to activate twinning. Microplasticity occurs by 
dislocation movement, producing crystallographic slip. Its activation is directly Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 117 
related to the yield strength, explaining why 𝜎௙ also increases with pre-strain. The 
increase in 𝜎௙, however, is less than that of 𝑌𝑆, as the higher stress levels associated 
with high yield strengths favor damage mechanisms such as cavity and microcrack 
formation at twin and grain boundaries. 
In conclusion, promoting the production of twins by pre-straining improves the 
fatigue strength of TWIP steels. Nevertheless, this effect saturates and a pre-strain 
beyond 30% is not necessarily beneficial.

4.3.3. Slowing down the propagation of cracks 
We saw in section 4.2.3 that the propagation of short cracks or long cracks for 
low ∆𝐾 and near ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ is controlled by the presence of microstructural 
barriers. In the following, we show how various microstructures of steels slow down 
the propagation of microcracks or postpone the propagation of the main crack at 
higher stresses and thus increase the fatigue life and strength. 
4.3.3.1. Increasing microstructural barriers: case of ferrito-pearlitic steels 
Ferrito-pearlitic low carbon steels are the most common multiphase steels. They 
combine a very good hot formability and are used for heat engine parts. 
Figure 4.8 schematically illustrates three spatial distributions of pearlite within 
the ferritic matrix. The ferrite grains have the same size. In distribution A, the 
pearlite is present as uniformly distributed grains. In distribution B, the pearlite is 
present as islands of pearlite colonies. The distance between the islands is highly 118 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
variable, but can reach more than 40 times the average ferrite grain size. In the C 
distribution, the pearlite is in the form of parallel bands placed alternately with 
ferrite bands. From a practical point of view, the reader may refer to the articles of 
Korda et al. (2006a, 2006b) to observe the real microstructures schematized in 
Figure 4.8 obtained after rolling of thick sheet metal. 
Figure 4.8. Ferrito-pearlitic steels, schematic representation of pearlite distribution 
within a ferritic matrix and crack propagation path: (a) distribution in which pearlite 
occurs as grains uniformly distributed in the matrix; (b) distribution in which pearlite 
occurs as islands of pearlite colonies; (c) distribution in which pearlite occurs as 
bands 
In all three distributions, crack initiation occurs in ferrite grains that are softer 
than pearlite grains. Figure 4.8 shows the crack path for the three distributions. The 
propagation of these cracks is easy in ferritic grains. It is either intragranular along 
slip bands or intergranular along a grain boundary. However, the propagation is 
temporarily stopped by the pearlitic zones, which are too hard for a plastic zone to 
form at the crack front. These zones constitute microstructural barriers to the crack 
growth. These stops are all the more frequent as the distance d between these 
barriers is small, which leads to a decrease in the average growth rate, as illustrated 
in Table 4.4. We see that for distributions A and C, which have a similar d, the crack 
growth rates are very close. In addition to the effect of these temporary stops, it is 
found that the path of the main crack is much more tortuous for distributions A and 
C than for distribution B, slowing down the propagation of the crack. The crack that 
encounters a pearlitic obstacle is deflected and prefers to propagate along a 
pearlite/ferrite interface. Finally, the C-distribution also produces secondary cracks 
from the main crack, relaxing the stresses at the crack tip, and consequently the crack growth rate

produce intermittent propagation and variations in propagation rate around the mean 
value in Table 4.4 (Figure 4.8d, see section 4.3.2.1 and Figure 4.4)5

tests with a constant ∆K equal to 15.3 Pa m, which emphasize the microstructural 
barrier effects, since the driving force for crack growth is constant (Korda et al. 
2006a, 2006b) 
4.3.3.2. Trade-off between propagation threshold and yield strength 
Figure 4.9 shows a common trend for ferritic, martensitic and bainitic steels: the 
decrease in the yield strength leads to an increase in the propagation threshold. A 
compromise between yield strength and propagation threshold seems to be 
necessary. Nevertheless, the correlation between these two properties is indirect, 
since steels with a propagation threshold of 7 MPa√m have yield strengths varying 
between 100 and 1400 MPa. This correlation is in fact verified for classes of steels 
with comparable microstructures. In the case of ferritic steels, it is the variation of 
the grain size between 3 µm and 3 mm that leads to a decrease in the yield strength. 
In parallel, the increase in the propagation threshold is due to an increase in the 
closure effect induced by the roughness of the fracture surface, which is greater the 
larger the grain size (see section 4.2.3.2) (Pippan 1991). For quenched and then 
tempered steels, the decrease in yield strength with tempering temperature is related 
to carbon precipitation in the form of iron carbides and, at higher temperatures, to a 
decrease in dislocation density because of recovery. The increase in the propagation 
5 Note that in the case of standard crack propagation tests, growth rate fluctuations are not 
detected, because crack advances are measured on a macroscopic scale (over a long distance), 
while decelerations occur on a microscopic scale. 120 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
threshold is due to several mechanisms whose predominance is difficult to identify. 
On the one hand, the increase in the tempering temperature produces a decrease in 
the hardness of the martensite, which hinders the intragranular fracture, because it 
has to occur in a larger and less stressed plastic zone. The presence of cyclic 
softening enhances this effect. On the other hand, the increase in tempering 
temperature leads to an increase in ductility and toughness and thus decreases the 
susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement (see Chapter 9). It promotes the diffusion 
of residual embrittling elements from the joints to the interior of the grains, 
strengthening the cohesion of the grain boundaries. Therefore, in addition to 
intragranular failure, it impedes intergranular failure (Ritchie 1977; Taylor 1989; 
Bulloch and Bulloch 1991). These examples show that some of the mechanisms 
explaining the yield strength and propagation threshold evolutions are different. In 
particular, while the yield strength is clearly related to the mean free path of 
dislocations, the origin of the evolution of the propagation threshold is much more 
complex and depends on both plasticity and failure mechanisms. 
Figure 4.9. Evolution of the propagation threshold as a function of yield strength for 
ferritic steels with grain sizes ranging from 3 µm to 3 mm, quenched and tempered 
steels at different temperatures containing 100% martensite or bainite and having

Pippan 1991). The dots correspond to the experimental values, the dashed lines

It is interesting to note that, according to Figure 4.9, ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ typically varies 
between 2 and 10 MPa√m, a range corresponding to the majority of steels. 
4.3.3.3. Case of multiphase ferrito-martensitic steels: a possible design to 
combine high yield strength and high propagation threshold? 
The arrival of ferrito-martensitic steels has made it possible to obtain very strong 
and ductile steels (see Chapter 1). It also gave a glimmer of hope in the search for 
improvement of the propagation threshold without reducing the yield strength. 
Suzuki and McEvily (1979) were the first to show that ferrito-martensitic steels 
exhibited both an increase in yield strength and propagation threshold. It is known 
that the yield strength increases with the volume fraction of martensite (see section 
4.3.2.1). Figure 4.10 shows that, depending on the studies (and associated heat 
treatments), the evolution of the propagation threshold with martensite volume 
fraction is variable (Shang et al. 1986; Chen et al. 1987; Deng and Ye 1991; Sun 
et al. 1995; Sudhakar and Dwarakadasa 2000; Li et al. 2014). Overall, however, a 
trend can be drawn: at low martensite fractions, the propagation threshold tends to 
increase with the amount of martensite. Therefore, as the yield strength also 
increases with the martensite fraction (see Figure 4.7), the propagation threshold 
increases with the yield strength, as confirmed in Figure 4.10b. High values of the 
propagation threshold, reaching 15–20 MPa√m, are obtained. At high volume 
fractions, the propagation threshold tends to decrease. An optimum martensite 
fraction tends to emerge. At low martensite fractions and when the ferrite forms a 
continuous phase, crack propagation occurs mainly in the ferrite. The martensite acts 
as a microstructural barrier and deflects the crack path. This results in a closure 
effect induced by the microstructure and the roughness of the fracture surface and an 
increase in the propagation threshold. This effect is all the stronger as the amount of 
martensite is large and the distance between the barriers is small. It is also stronger 
the more the martensite is also connected (see section 4.3.2.1). When the amount of 
martensite becomes higher, the crack propagation takes place mainly in the 
martensitic phase. As the martensite phase is harder, the crack growth occurs over a 
short plastic zone and probably follows a more linear path than in the previous case. 
These two effects contribute to lower the propagation threshold. Thus, it seems that 
an optimum is obtained when the martensitic phase is connected and the ferrite 
volume fraction remains high. The dispersion of the results in Figure 4.10 is due to 
the microstructures that differ in hardness, thinness and connectivity of the two 
phases. 122 New Advanced High Strength Steels

4.3.3.4. Third-generation steels 
Third-generation steels have been developed to increase ductility compared to very 
high strength steels such as martensitic or DP steels while having similar maximum 
strengths (see Appendix). Their properties result from the combination of several 
ductile (residual austenite, ferrite) and resistant (martensite, bainite) phases coupled 
with the TRIP effect. There are still very few studies on the fatigue performance of 
these steels (Hockauf et al. 2019; Song 2020). Initial work shows that the main crack 
exhibits secondary deflections and branching along the phase boundaries or grain 
boundaries of transformed austenite and martensite laths. This results in a sinuous 
crack path and a closure effect slowing down the crack propagation. Martensitic 
transformation at crack tips for ∆𝐾 close to ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ was not observed. In this 
family of steels, initial studies also show that ∆𝐾௧௛௥௘௦௛௢௟ௗ decreases as the yield 
strength increases (Table 4.5). This result is mainly attributed to the residual austenite. 
The latter is distributed in thin layers between the martensite laths or at the grain 
boundaries. It presents a cyclic hardening requiring an increase in stress during the 
cycles to activate the plasticity. Moreover, the residual austenitic phase is enriched in 
carbon. This enrichment favors planar slip and its reversibility, and consequently 
reduces plastic irreversibility and damage. As the volume fraction is higher in 
quenching and partitioning (Q&P) steel than in conventional TRIP Q&T (quenching 
and tempering) steel, the two previous effects lead to an increase in the threshold.

4.4. Increasing role of defects in high strength steels 
4.4.1. Murakami’s approach: small defects and short cracks 
In addition to the Kitagawa diagram seen in section 4.2.3, the harmfulness of a 
flaw can be approximated by the Murakami criterion (Murakami and Beretta 1999). 
While Kitagawa’s approach is dedicated to the impact of the size of “large” defects 
(size > 𝑎௖௥௜௧௜௖௔௟) on the propagation of long cracks, Murakami’s approach studies the 
impact of a defect of size between 𝑑and 𝑎௖௥௜௧௜௖௔௟ on the propagation of short cracks. 124 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Based on tests performed on 14 steel grades, Murakami proposes a relationship 
between the fatigue strength and Vickers hardness (HV) of the material by 
incorporating the size of the initial defect (the size of the defect is represented by the 
projected area of the defect perpendicular to the applied principal stress) (Figure 
4.12) (Murakami 2019). The relationships are given in the case of a surface defect: 
σ௙ = 1.43 × (𝐻𝑉 ൅ 120)/൫ඥ𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎൯

× ሾ(1െ𝑅)⁄2ሿఋ [4.4] 
with δ = 0.226 ൅ HV × 10ିସ.
These results show that the larger the defect, the more it reduces the fatigue 
strength. Furthermore, unlike the cases of “large” defects and long cracks discussed 
in section 4.3.2.2, an increase in the hardness of the steel produces an increase in 
fatigue strength. This difference is due to the fact that, in the case of short cracks, 
the plastic zone remains small and propagation occurs over a small distance. The 
microstructural effects (microstructural barriers) and the closure effects observed in 
the case of long cracks do not exist. Moreover, for an equivalent size, a surface 
defect is more harmful than an internal defect.

4.4.2. Decreased fatigue strength of quenched and tempered steels in 
the presence of sulfide inclusions 
As we have seen, the presence of defects such as inclusions can degrade the 
fatigue strength. Current manufacturing processes reduce their presence for highly 
stressed applications such as bearings or aeronautical parts. Electro Slag Remelting 
can also be used to reduce their quantity to a minimum. In any case, certain 
properties, especially machinability, require inclusions to allow chip fragmentation 
and reduce tool wear. The most commonly used elements are metallic inclusions 
such as lead (soon to be banned), bismuth or manganese sulfides. These inclusions 
are very ductile during rolling, giving very elongated inclusions (see Figure 4.12) 
and anisotropic behavior between the long and cross directions. This effect can be 
reduced by additions of elements leading to fragmentation of the inclusions 
(Mahmutoviü et al. 2015). 
In the field of crack initiation, the Kitagawa criterion can be considered as a first 
approach to estimate the fatigue strength in the presence of inclusions. With a load 
in the long direction, the projected surface of the inclusions being very small, the 
fatigue strength is driven by the matrix for grades of ultimate tensile strength lower 
than 1200 MPa. On the other hand, in the transverse direction, the equivalent size 
(diameter of the circle with the same surface) generally exceeds the 𝑎௖௥௜௧௜௖௔௟ size, 
leading to a decrease in fatigue strength (Figure 4.3). For free-cutting steels 
(high-volume machining), the sulfur content can be as high as 200 ppm, lowering 
the fatigue strength by more than 30% in the cross direction (Table 4.6) 
(Maciejewski 2015).

morphology of a sulfide inclusion obtained after rolling; (b) fracture surface 
after fatigue loading in the transverse direction (Uystpruyst-Lesage 1980) 126 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
In the propagation domain, if the crack propagates perpendicular to the 
inclusions (long direction), the crack growth rate is reduced, the inclusions acting as 
barriers on the crack path. On the other hand, in the other direction (cross direction), 
the crack growth rate increases with the sulfide content, the inclusions acting as a 
guide for the crack path (Uystpruyst-Lesage 1980).

4.5. Specific treatments for fatigue performance 
When the fatigue properties of a component do not allow it to meet the 
specifications in terms of service life or when one wishes to guarantee a better safety 
coefficient, strengthening processes are frequently used. We distinguish two families 
of processes: those using thermochemical treatments for the first and those based on 
mechanical treatments for the second. In both cases, we will speak of surface 
treatments, insofar as they affect the steels in depths of the order of a millimeter. 
4.5.1. Thermochemical treatments 
Case-hardening and nitriding consist of carrying out a chemical reaction, at more 
or less high temperature depending on the process, which affects the surface layers. 
The case-hardening process enriches the surface with carbon and is followed by a 
hardening process that hardens the surface of the part. In the case of carbonitriding, 
nitrogen reduces the treatment temperature by promoting the quenching effect, 
nitrogen acting as a gammagenic element. Nitriding, on the other hand, consists of 
nitrogen diffusion resulting in surface hardening by nitride precipitates, but does not 
require quenching. These thermochemical treatments result in a significant increase 
in strength, especially if the part is subjected to surface stresses such as bending or 
contact fatigue. The most common example of surface fatigue crack initiation is in 
gears. They must resist bending fatigue at the root and spalling at the tooth flank. 
The carbon and nitrogen enrichment of the material depends on the thermal cycle 
and the nature of the furnace atmosphere, but the amount of carbon targeted is 
generally of the order of 0.6% of carbon on the surface, making it possible to obtain Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 127 
a martensitic phase of about 850 HV0.3 after quenching. Too much carbon can lead to 
the presence of harmful austenite in the enriched layer. The depth treated varies 
from a few tenths to several millimeters depending on the application and size of the 
part (e.g. ISO 6336-5 (ISO 2016) indicates the optimum depth for gears). Note that 
these treatments are often followed by tempering to soften the fresh martensite and 
shot peening to further enhance fatigue strength. Depending on the material, this 
treatment increases the fatigue strength by 70–100% (Davis 2005). 
4.5.2. Mechanical treatments 
As far as mechanical treatments are concerned, the purpose of these processes is 
to introduce residual compressive stresses on the surface of the part. The principle is 
based on the plastic straining of the surface layers, which leads to their hardening. 
The consequence of this heterogeneous deformation in depth is to generate residual 
compressive stresses by elastic recovery of the deeper layers not strained. There is a 
great diversity of mechanical treatments more or less intense such as shot peening, 
hammering or deep rolling. If the first processes are obtained by repeated impacts of 
balls or needles of various natures, or even by laser peening, the last process, the 
deep rolling, is carried out by pushing back material. In all cases, obtaining residual 
compressive stresses on the surface, the preferred site for fatigue crack initiation, 
makes it possible to reduce the stress loads by subtraction. It should not be neglected 
that these residual compressive stresses are also likely to relax more or less 
according to the intensity of the loading, and more particularly if this one 
approaches the initial yield strength of the material, whether in tension or in 
compression (this last case being the most critical). These mechanical treatments can 
give the surface other advantages such as improved resistance to corrosion and wear 
or, on the contrary, disadvantages such as deterioration of roughness and damage to 
a sub-surface area. 
4.5.3. Case of welding 
Mechanical treatments are very frequently used as a fatigue strengthening 
process for welded assemblies. The fatigue strength of welds is the result of many 
parameters, those related to the welding process, those related to the geometry and 
loading and finally those related to the steel used. It is commonly accepted that the 
fatigue strength of a welded joint is not very sensitive to the steel grades when the 
weld presents a strong stress concentration, which is frequently the case. Indeed, the 
consequence of a stress concentration (notch), in a zone which will see its 
microstructure recombined by the welding process (melted zone, thermally affected 
zone, see Chapter 10), as well as possible unfavorable residual stresses, leads to no 128 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
grades differentiation anymore. Thus, in the fatigue design of a welded joint, only its 
“detail” is considered, that is, its geometry, dimensions and loading, which will 
define its strength class (Hobbacher 2007). In addition to strengthening techniques 
by introducing compressive residual stresses, there are other specific methods for 
improving fatigue properties such as for arc welding, grinding and TIG dressing, 
which will increase fatigue strength by more than 50% (Haagensen and Maddox 
2013). The fatigue strength of welded joints under high stress concentrations is then 
only dependent on the dimensions of the joint, with the relatively fast initiation 
phase giving way to a longer crack propagation phase. As an example, results from 
Mohan Iyengar et al. (2009) (Figure 4.13) show that the fatigue strength of electric 
resistance welded spots under tensile–shear conditions on products of the same 
thickness leads to similar fatigue curves regardless of the steel grade. 
Figure 4.13. Wöhler tensile–shear curves on welded spots on plates of 
different steel grades with the same thickness (Mohan Iyengar et al. 2009) 
4.6. Conclusion 
The improvement of the fatigue properties can be done in two main ways: 
increasing the yield strength and increasing the crack propagation threshold. The 
physical mechanisms of plasticity increasing the yield strength are now well known 
and the associated metallurgical developments are well mastered. As far as crack 
propagation is concerned, although numerous studies have led to a better Compromise between Tensile and Fatigue Strength 129 
understanding of the phenomena, they are more complex and involve plasticity and 
fracture mechanisms intrinsic to the material, but also environmental effects. With 
the development of very high strength steels, local stress concentrations become 
very intense, especially at the level of defects (geometry, roughness, porosity, 
inclusions). They promote early crack initiation, reinforcing the role of propagation 
in fatigue properties. It is therefore necessary to continue the studies on propagation. 
The example of dual-phase steels has shown that it is possible to develop a steel 
with a high crack propagation threshold while maintaining a high strength and 
therefore a good resistance to crack initiation. Third-generation three-phase steels 
could meet such a challenge without making a yield strength–crack propagation 
threshold compromise with a tailor-made design to best combine the properties of 
the phases and their interactions. Moreover, we have seen that, in the case of high 
strength steels, the role of the defects becomes predominant before that of the 
matrix. It is important to note that this harmful effect on the service life present in 
endurance fatigue is at the origin of the failure in the very high cycle fatigue domain 
for which the stress level is even lower. The result is an initiation on internal defects 
and a lifespan that is difficult to predict today. Finally, whatever the metallurgy of 
the steels, there are also different processes reinforcing the surface of the parts in a 
global way or more locally at the level of geometrical defects, and thus to prolong 
the lifespan of the structures.

5.1. Introduction 
The development of high-strength steel grades is aimed at reducing the thickness 
of steel plates and the weight of assembled objects. This reduction in thickness 
makes the need for corrosion protection all the more critical. Zinc-rich coatings have 
emerged as the dominant solution because they provide two mechanisms of 
corrosion protection: a barrier effect as the corrosion products of zinc are much 
more impermeable to corrosive agents than those of iron, and an electrochemical 
effect as zinc, being more electronegative than iron, acts as an anode during 
corrosion, thus giving steel the role of a cathode (Marder 2000). 
There are three technologies for the industrial coating of flat steel coils: zinc 
electroplating, vacuum deposition processes and continuous hot-dip galvanizing 
(ArcelorMittal n.d.). 
In all cases, flat steels are continuously annealed before the coating step to 
recrystallize the steel structure after cold rolling. During continuous annealing, the 
more oxidizable alloying elements of the steels can segregate to the surface and 
form oxide particles or films (Grabke et al. 1995). Successful coating deposition on 
the steel surface after annealing requires good control of its surface condition, 134 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
especially its oxidation state, because the continuity of the metallic bond along this 
interface ensures the adhesion of the metal coating to the steel. 
In the case of electroplating and vacuum deposition processes, the coating 
operation is decoupled from the annealing so that it is possible to interpose a 
pickling of the steel surface between annealing and coating. The hot-dip galvanizing 
process is the most common industrial process, because it is more economical since 
the recrystallization annealing and coating operations are combined in a single 
process. However, in this case, it is necessary to obtain the metallic state of the 
surface of the steel as soon as it is annealed, which is not easy to guarantee for 
high-strength steels, often alloyed with highly oxidizable elements (Mn, Si, Al, etc.). 
It is then necessary to develop specific annealing techniques to obtain the desired 
metallic state on the surface of the annealed steel. This chapter will be mainly 
devoted to these issues. 
5.2. The continuous galvanizing process 
The continuous hot-dip galvanizing process is the most common way to coat flat 
steel for corrosion protection. The steel strip from the continuous annealing process 
passes for a few seconds through a bath of molten metal, usually a zinc alloy, at the 
bottom of which a roller guides the strip vertically upwards. As the steel stripe 
merges, it takes away too much liquid metal. The thickness of the final coating is 
adjusted by an air nozzle system in the wiping stage. A few more seconds pass 
before the coating is completely solidified (Marder 2000; Marder and Goodwin 
2022). We will first describe the physicochemical mechanisms that lead to the 
formation of a coating on low-alloyed steels before discussing the specifics of 
high-strength steels. 
5.2.1. Mechanisms involved in the steel/liquid metal interaction 
In hot-dip galvanizing, the adhesion and homogeneity of the zinc coating depend 
on the initial wetting of the steel by the liquid zinc alloy (Guttmann 1994). Wetting 
refers to the ability of a liquid to spread over a solid substrate. At high temperatures, 
the wetting of a solid/liquid system is studied with either of two techniques 
(Eustathopoulos et al. 1999): 
– the Wilhelmy’s method, whose principle is to bring the solid of well-defined 
geometry (e.g. a plate) in contact with the liquid and to measure the capillary force 
which is exerted on the solid; High Strength Steels and Coatings 135 
– the sessile drop method, which consists of depositing a droplet of the liquid on 
the solid and measuring the contact angle defined by the horizontal substrate and the 
tangent to the droplet at the triple line (Figure 5.1a). The triple line is the droplet 
boundary where the three phases (liquid, solid and vapor) are in contact. It is 
referred to as perfect wetting if θ = 0°, strong partial wetting if θ < 90° (Figure 
5.1b), weak partial wetting if θ > 90° (Figure 5.1c), and no wetting if θ = 180°.

The equilibrium contact angle on an ideal (i.e. smooth and homogeneous) 
surface, noted 𝜃௒, is called the Young’s contact angle. It is constant at any point of 
the triple line and is given by Young’s equation: 
cos 𝜃௒ = ఊೄೇିఊೄಽ
ఊಽೇ
 [5.1] 
where 𝛾௅௏ is the surface tension of liquid L in contact with vapor V, 𝛾ௌ௏ and 𝛾ௌ௅ are 
the solid/vapor and solid/liquid interfacial tensions. For non-ideal (i.e. rough and/or 
chemically heterogeneous) solids, the contact angle is no longer unique, but lies 
between a receding contact angle 𝜃௥ and an advancing contact angle 𝜃௔. If some 
liquid is removed from a sessile drop, the triple line remains pinned and the contact 
angle decreases to 𝜃௥. At this angle, the triple line shifts. Conversely, if some liquid 
is added to this drop, the contact angle increases to 𝜃௔, beyond which the triple line 
can move. The difference between 𝜃௔ and 𝜃௥ defines the contact angle hysteresis. 
When the contact angle is time dependent (e.g. when the drop spreads), it is referred 
to as the dynamic contact angle 𝜃ௗ (Eustathopoulos et al. 1999; Kaplan et al. 2013). 
Wetting of steel by liquid metals used in hot-dip galvanizing is mainly studied by 
the Wilhelmy’s method with capillary force measurements and the sessile drop 136 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
technique with 𝜃௒, 𝜃௥ and 𝜃௔ measurements (section 5.4.1). The objective is to 
highlight the wetting quality obtained for a given steel/liquid metal system. In the 
industrial line, the hydrodynamic conditions differ from these laboratory 
measurements since the steel strip runs through the metal bath at a speed of the order 
of 1 m·s−1
. The wetting is then dynamic. Dynamic wetting by low-viscosity liquids 
such as liquid metals still needs to be better understood, even if some scaling law 
models exist in the literature (Eustathopoulos et al. 1999), applied in particular to 
continuous galvanizing (Mataigne 2017). 
In hot-dip galvanizing, wetting is also reactive, as reactions occur at the interface 
between the steel and the liquid metal (Guttmann 1994; Marder 2000; Giorgi et al. 
2005). First, iron dissolves, causing its concentration in the liquid bath to increase in 
the vicinity of the steel. Then, when the iron supersaturation at the interface is large 
enough, nuclei of one or more intermetallic compounds form on the steel. Their 
nature depends on the composition of the galvanizing bath. The next step is the 
growth of these nuclei. The final coating is thus composed of a thin crystallized 
layer of intermetallic compound(s) about 0.1 µm thick, covered by a zinc alloy layer 
about 10 µm thick (section 5.2.2). 
5.2.2. Intermetallic compounds and coating 
In batch galvanizing, steel pieces, already shaped, are dipped into liquid zinc 
(containing some other elements, like bismuth, at low concentrations) at about 
460°C. The resulting coating is a succession of layers of Fe-Zn (Γ1, Γ2, δ, ζ), 
intermetallic compounds present in the binary equilibrium diagram at this 
temperature (Xiong et al. 2009; Okamoto 2016). Their thickness depends on the 
steel’s residence time in the liquid metal. It would reach several micrometers in 
continuous galvanizing. These intermetallic compounds are solid at galvanizing 
temperatures, which prevents the production of thin coatings during wiping. In 
addition, they are brittle when drawn and in service, which leads to an increased risk 
of flaking under deformation (Marder 2000). 
The idea of continuous galvanizing is based on adding aluminum to the liquid 
zinc to promote the growth of the thinner (a few tenths of a micrometer) iron- and 
aluminum-rich intermetallic compounds, which temporarily inhibit the growth of 
brittle Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds (Guttmann 1994; Marder 2000). Zinc alloys 
used are distinguished by their low (less than 1 wt.%, section 5.2.2.1) or 
intermediate (5 wt.%, section 5.2.2.2) aluminum content. Also referred to are 
Zn-free alloys, containing 90 wt.% Al and 10 wt.% Si, developed for high-strength 
hot-drawing steels, the so-called press-hardening steels (section 5.2.2.3). High Strength Steels and Coatings 137 
5.2.2.1. Coatings from zinc alloys with low aluminum content 
The most common galvanizing bath, noted GI for GalvanIzed, contains about 
0.2 wt.% Al and is saturated with Fe (about 0.015 wt.%). In this case, the 
intermetallic compound formed on the steel is Fe2Al5Znx (0 < x < 1). The resulting 
phase sequence, Fe/Fe2Al5Znx/liquid Zn-Al, can be visualized with a diffusion path 
in the Al-Fe-Zn phase diagram at 450°C (Tang 1995), as shown in Figure 5.2a. In 
this schematic representation, the regions of the different phases are larger than in 
reality to facilitate the understanding of the presented diffusion path. 
The Fe/Fe2Al5Znx and Fe2Al5Znx/liquid Zn-Al (bath) interfaces are represented 
by the ends of the two dash-dotted line segments corresponding to the tie lines in the 
two-phase domains. This means that the interfaces are in local thermodynamic 
equilibrium and explains the temporary inhibition of the growth of Fe-Zn phases 
(Leprêtre 1996). After solidification, the GI coating consists of a 0.1 µm thick 
crystallized Fe2Al5Znx layer (Figure 5.2c) covered by about 10 µm of solidified zinc 
(Figure 5.2b).

450–460°C and diffusion path representing the phase sequence Fe/Fe2Al5Znx/liquid

(ArcelorMittal n.d.); (c) Fe2Al5Znx surface after selective dissolution of zinc. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
A lower Al content (0.10–0.13 wt.% Al) galvanizing bath, denoted GA 
for GalvAnnealed, is used to allow the formation of a thinner (or even discontinuous 
for lower Al contents) 20 nm thick Fe2Al5Znx layer, topped by a 200 nm thick 
δ layer (Zapico Álvarez et al. 2020, Figure 5.3b). The phase sequence of 
Fe/Fe2Al5Znx/δ/liquid Zn-Al corresponds to an experimental diffusion path in the 138 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Al-Fe-Zn phase diagram at 450°C (orange, Figure 5.3a). The three interfaces, 
Fe/Fe2Al5Znx, Fe2Al5Znx/δ and δ/liquid Zn-Al, are represented by the ends of 
dash-dotted line segments corresponding to the tie lines in the two-phase domains. 
The interfaces are, therefore, in local thermodynamic equilibrium. It explains the 
temporary inhibition of the growth of Fe-Zn phases (Leprêtre 1996). The thickness 
of the coating, which remains liquid upon emersion, is adjusted by wiping.

of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
However, the inhibition by δ is weak and can be broken by performing a 
reheating treatment at 500°C for about 15 s immediately after wiping. This induces 
zinc diffusion through the inhibition layer and Zn enrichment of the steel surface. As 
a result, solid phases Γ1 and Γ2, in equilibrium with the Zn-saturated steel, precipitate 
at this location. The local equilibria between the inhibition layer and the liquid phase 
are then broken, and a flux of iron reappears toward the liquid phase, which 
eventually turns into a solid phase δ with some ζ crystals if the reaction temperature 
is lower than the peritectic temperature of ζ. With this process, the thicknesses of the 
resulting layers are well controlled and limited to the total thickness of zinc after the 
wiping process (which would not have been possible if the Fe-Zn compounds had 
developed in the liquid metal bath). These alloyed or galvannealed coatings High Strength Steels and Coatings 139 
(Figures 5.3a and 5.3c, blue diffusion path) were developed for the automotive 
industry, which makes extensive use of resistance welding in body assembly. These 
higher melting point coatings induce lower degradation of the welding electrodes. 
The heat treatment required to produce Zn-Fe alloyed coatings can profoundly 
change the phase distribution of high-strength steels. For example, to obtain a TRIP 
steel, the bainitic transformation must be managed to stabilize the austenite by its 
enrichment in carbon. TRIP grades are suitable for galvanizing since the desired 
bainitic transformation occurs during holding at 460°C. However, the reheating 
treatment at 500°C induces the precipitation of carbides in the Mn and Si alloyed 
grades. To use this process, it is then necessary to replace the silicon in the steel with 
aluminum and possibly add molybdenum to slow down the bainitic transformation 
and stabilize the austenite. 
5.2.2.2. Coatings from zinc alloys with intermediate Al content 
When zinc is alloyed with aluminum and magnesium, much better corrosion 
resistance is observed. The most classic coating in this category is Galfan, containing 
5 wt.% Al. Coatings alloyed with Al and Mg, such as Magnelis, containing 
3.7 wt.% Al and 3 wt.% Mg are also being developed. Al enhances the barrier effect of 
zinc through improved passivation and Mg enhances cathodic protection.

Magnelis coating; (c) FeAl3Znx on the surface after selective dissolution of the coating 
(private communication, Musik, ArcelorMittal). For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 140 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Magnesium does not participate in the interface reactions occurring upon 
immersion. When the Al content becomes higher than 1 wt.%, the intermetallic 
compound in equilibrium with the Fe-saturated liquid metal is no longer Fe2Al5Znx 
but becomes FeAl3Znx (Tang 1995). This phase precipitates onto the steel until it 
completely covers it (Figures 5.4b and 5.4c). The liquid Zn/FeAl3Znx interface is in 
local thermodynamic equilibrium (ends of the dash-dotted line segment, Figure 
5.4a), but the FeAl3Znx/Fe interface is not (dotted line segment, Figure 5.4a). Local 
thermodynamic equilibrium would be achieved if Fe2Al5Znx were formed between 
Fe and FeAl3Znx, which requires Zn enrichment and Al depletion. However, the Fe 
and Al interdiffusion is 10–100 times lower in FeAl3Znx than in Fe2Al5Znx at 1000°C 
(Bamola and Seigle 1989; Guttmann 1994). This result suggests that the diffusion 
rate of Zn is also low through FeAl3Znx. The Zn flux is then reduced, and Fe2Al5Znx 
does not form. The FeAl3Znx layer thus behaves as an inhibition layer from a kinetic 
point of view. This situation is encountered in both Galfan and Magnelis. 
The Zn-Al phase diagram shows a eutectic at 5 wt.% Al and 381°C, consisting of 
two Zn-rich solid phases, one noted as (Zn) containing 1.2 wt.% Al and the other 
noted as (Al) at 16.9 wt.% Al (Okamoto 1995). The composition of Galfan is close 
to this eutectic. The first stage of solidification is the nucleation/growth of the 
primary phase (Zn) at the interface with the steel. The remaining liquid is enriched 
in Al and joins the eutectic composition. Solidification of the lamellar eutectic can 
then begin from the primary (Zn) crystals (Figure 5.5a). 
The composition of the Al- and Mg-alloyed coatings is close to the composition 
of the liquid phase L at two particular points in the liquidus of the Al-Mg-Zn phase 
diagram (blue point at 8.1 mol.% Al and 7.3 mol.% Mg, Figure 5.6a): A 
ternary eutectic E at 343°C, 3.9 wt.% Al and 2.4 wt.% Mg (or 8.7 mol.% Al and 
5.9 mol.% Mg), corresponding to the equilibrium L = (Zn) + (Al) + Mg2Zn11 and a 
quasi-peritectic π at 365°C, 5.2 wt.% Al and 3.2 wt.% Mg (or 11.1 mol.% Al and 
7.6 mol.% Mg), corresponding to L + MgZn2 = (Al) + Mg2Zn11 (Liang et al. 1998). 
If the solidification of the Magnelis coating followed the formation of the phases 
predicted by the phase diagram, it would consist of Mg2Zn11 as the primary phase, a 
binary eutectic Mg2Zn11 + (Zn) and mostly the ternary eutectic Mg2Zn11 +(Zn) +(Al). 
This is not the microstructure obtained in practice on industrial coatings (Figure 5.5b). 
Instead, a primary phase (Zn) and a metastable ternary eutectic involving the 
phases (Zn), MgZn2 and (Al) are detected, with an overall composition close to 
3.75 wt.% Al and 3 wt.% Mg (or 8.2 mol.% Al and 7.3 mol.% Mg). There may be 
epitaxial relationships between (Zn) and FeAl3Znx covering the steel surface (Figure 
5.4c), which would promote the nucleation of primary metastable (Zn) due to a low 
FeAl3Znx/(Zn) interfacial energy. Similarly, epitaxial relationships between (Zn) and 
MgZn2 could favor the solidification of the metastable eutectic. High Strength Steels and Coatings 141 
5.2.2.3. High Al content coatings 
For certain structural parts, the automotive industry requires high-strength steels, 
which can be drawn without spring back. An industrial technical solution consists of 
supplying steels for hot drawing containing C, Mn and B. Formability is obtained by 
austenitizing the steel to be drawn at 900°C. The hot drawing is performed on a 
deformable austenite. A quenching of the structure at the end of the deformation 
transforms the austenite into martensite. To avoid oxidation of the steel surface 
during high-temperature holding, a protective coating against hot oxidation, called 
Alusi (ArcelorMittal n.d.), is applied beforehand. It consists of an aluminum alloy 
containing 9–10 wt.% Si and saturated with Fe (2–3 wt.%) (blue polygon, Figure 
5.6b). During austenitization, the aluminum in the coating provides passivation of 
the deep-drawing blank against oxidation (Grigorieva 2010). 
Figure 5.5. (a) Cross-section of the Galfan coating (ArcelorMittal n.d.); 
(b) cross-section of Magnelis coating (private communication, Musik, ArcelorMittal); 
(c) cross-section of Alusi coating (ArcelorMittal n.d.). For a color version of this figure, 
see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
In an Alusi bath at 675°C, the intermetallic compound in equilibrium with the 
iron-saturated liquid phase is τ6 (Al4,5FeSi) (blue polygon, Figure 5.6b). However, 
following the dissolution of iron from the steel, τ5 (Al7,4Fe2Si) locally becomes the 
compound in equilibrium with the liquid phase (arrow , Figure 5.6b) and τ5 forms on 
the steel. Fe and Al interdiffusion in τ5 leads to the τ5 growth and the FeAl3 and Fe2Al5
formation at the τ5/steel interface (Grigorieva 2010). At emersion, the Alusi coating 
consists of a liquid with a composition in the blue polygon (Figure 5.6b) on the 
5–6 µm thick τ5 solid. The coating cools by natural convection after wiping. 
Solidification can be predicted from the liquidus structure (Krendelsberger et al. 2007; 
Raghavan 2011) of the Al-Fe-Si diagram (Raghavan 2009) (path , Figure 5.6b). 
First, solid τ6 crystals precipitate in the liquid coating. Then, at a temperature between 
577 and 609°C, Al dendrites nucleate and grow (L = (Al) + τ6). Finally, the last step is 
the solidification at 577°C of a ternary eutectic (L = (Al) + (Si) +τ6, Figure 5.5c). 142 New Advanced High Strength Steels

5.3. Selective oxidation during continuous annealing 
We have just described the most common coatings deposited on steels by 
immersion in a molten metal bath (section 5.2). These steels come from continuous 
recrystallization annealing, where the most oxidizable alloying elements selectively 
oxidize. Selective oxidation is called external when the oxides nucleate and grow 
only on the steel surface, which can prevent wetting by liquid metals and cause 
defects in the coatings (section 5.4.1). Selective oxidation is internal when the 
oxidation front penetrates inside the steel. We will discuss the mechanisms of 
selective oxidation based on thermodynamic (section 5.3.1) and reactive diffusion 
(section 5.3.2) calculations. 
5.3.1. Thermodynamic stability of oxides 
5.3.1.1. Theoretical determination of stable oxides 
The purpose of continuous annealing is to recrystallize the structure of the 
cold-rolled steel by heating it to a temperature of 750–850°C. To avoid iron 
oxidation, a N2-H2 (5 to 15 vol.%) atmosphere is used, which decreases the partial
pressure of oxygen in the gas and thus the fraction of oxygen dissolved in the steel 
by the equilibria: 
Hଶ + ଵ
ଶOଶ ⇆ HଶO [5.2] 
ଵ
ଶOଶ ⇆ O [5.3] 
Industrially, the reducing or oxidizing power of the gas atmosphere is controlled 
by the dew point (DP > 0°C) or frost point (FP < 0°C). The dew point (respectively, 
frost point) is the temperature that corresponds to the saturation vapor pressure of 
water in equilibrium with liquid (respectively, solid) water. The partial pressure of 
Oଶ is deduced from the Gibbs free energy associated with the reaction [5.2] knowing 
the partial pressures of Hଶ and HଶO. The mass fraction of O dissolved in ferrite and 
in austenite is known by measurements (Swisher and Turkdogan 1967). A summary 
of all thermodynamic data can be found in Appendix A in Huin et al. (2005). 
Typically, the frost or dew point is chosen between –40 and + 10°C, that is, 𝑝ୌమ୓ ௦௔௧
from 13 to 1230 Pa. In this case, for N2-5 vol.% H2 at 800°C, 𝑝୓మvaries from 
2.6 × 10–19 to 2.4 × 10–15 Pa and 𝑤୓
ఈ୊ୣ from 0.01 to 0.88 ppm. 
Figure 5.7a shows the stability domains of Fe and Mn and their single oxides 
MOఔ (M = Fe or Mn) as a function of temperature and dew point in N2-H2 (5 or 
15 vol.%). The reactions are written as follows: 144 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
M + 𝜈HଶO ⇆ MOఔ + 𝜈Hଶ [5.4] 
Under the annealing operating conditions, the possible oxides are Fe0.95O, Fe3O4, 
Fe2O3 and MnO, assumed to be pure. From the Gibbs free energy associated with the 
reaction [5.4] for M = Fe (Barin and Knacke 1973; Barin et al. 1977), Figure 5.7a 
can be constructed considering that iron, which is the main element of the steels 
considered here, is pure. For the Mn/MnO equilibrium, since the solution of Mn in 
Fe is dilute (calculated with 𝑤୑୬
ఈ୊ୣ = 1.5 wt.%), the activity of Mn is assumed to 
follow Henry’s law (Huin et al. 2005, Appendix B). The speckled rectangle 
represents the usual annealing temperature and dew point conditions. It is positioned 
in the domain of metallic iron and MnO, meaning that the native iron oxides are 
reduced, and Mn is oxidized. Similar calculations show that the main alloying 
elements of high-strength steels, Si, Al, Mn and Cr, also oxidize.

(5.10–9 and 16 ppm, respectively). For Al and Mn contents above 1 wt.% (i.e. 
104 ppm), typical of high-strength steels, Al and Mn are therefore oxidized High Strength Steels and Coatings 145

solubility products of the different oxides following the method initially proposed by 
Huin et al. (2005) for steels containing Mn and Si. Al and Mn oxidize at very low 
contents (5.10–9 and 16 ppm, respectively). For Al and Mn contents higher than 
1 wt.% (i.e. 104
 ppm), typical of high-strength steels, Al and Mn are thus oxidized. 
5.3.1.2. Link between the metallurgy of steels and the selective oxides 
formed 
Steels are distinguished primarily by their alloying elements and the phases they 
contain. However, if we are interested in their galvanizability, it is useful to classify 
them according to their behavior toward selective oxidation during recrystallization 
annealing. Indeed, we have just seen that the oxides of the alloying elements, more 
oxidizable than iron, can be stable. 
The first category of steels includes ferritic steels, such as interstitial-free (IF) 
steels, which contain little carbon (0.002 to 0.003 wt.%) and are low alloyed (0.01 
wt.% Si, 0.15 wt.% Mn, 0.01 wt.% P, 0.04 wt.% Al). For these steels, selective 
oxidation never generates covering oxide films, which are likely to disturb the 
wetting (Ollivier-Leduc et al. 2010). These steels can be hardened with 
substitutional elements such as Mn, Si and/or P, with contents up to 0.5 wt.% Si, 
0.6 wt.% Mn, 0.1 wt.% P. Often, these steels also contain 0.001–0.002 wt.% boron to 
avoid grain boundary embrittlement induced by phosphorous segregation. Boron is 
highly oxidizable and forms an external oxide, such as MnB2O4, in typical annealing 
atmospheres at low dew points of −40°C (Mataigne 2011; Giorgi et al. 2012). 
Selective oxidation becomes intense when steels contain oxidizable alloying 
elements with contents higher than 1 wt.%. This is always the case for modern 
high-strength steels, such as TRIP and third-generation steels. These steels are 
alloyed with carbon (0.175–0.250 wt.%), manganese (1.0–2.5 wt.%) and silicon 
(1.0–2.0 wt.%, TRIP MnSi) or aluminum (1.0–2.0 wt.%, TRIP MnAl). The selective 
oxides formed are mainly SiO2 and Mn2SiO4 for TRIP MnSi steels (Staudte et al. 
2011; Cho et al. 2014; Seyed Mousavi and McDermid 2018a) or Al2O3 and MnAl2O4 
for TRIP MnAl steels (Paunoiu 2018). These are very stable oxides with solubility 
products close to zero (Huin et al. 2005). 
DP steels, alloyed with carbon (0.08–0.18 wt.%) and manganese (1.6–2.4 wt.%), 
contain less silicon and aluminum, typically <0.5 wt.%, than TRIP and third- 146 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
generation steels. In this case, during recrystallization annealing, the solubility limits 
of Mn2SiO4 and MnAl2O4 are reached first (steel composition in the MnAl2O4 range, 
right-hand extension of the compositions in Figure 5.7b). These mixed oxides are 
formed by consuming the Si and Al available for selective oxidation. SiO2 and Al2O3 
may then not be stable. If the oxidizing power allows it, the oxide that precipitates 
afterwards is MnO. This situation is also encountered for duplex steels enriched in 
Mn (3–7 wt.%). 
The second-generation austenitic steels of the TWIP type deserve to be 
mentioned. In order to stabilize the austenite at room temperature, these steels are 
alloyed with Mn up to 15–25 wt.%. This Mn content induces MnO precipitation 
rates at the steel surface above the critical rate blocking inward oxygen diffusion 
(equation [5.8]), and selective oxidation remains external (Cho and De Cooman 
2012). 
5.3.2. Reactive diffusion

N2-5 vol.% H2 and DP = 0°C (Drouet 2021) and concentration profiles of dissolved 𝑂
and 𝑀 in the steel on either side of the oxidation front (Wagner 1959). M corresponds 
to Al in the example chosen here, as the solubility product of Al2O3 is very low (Huin 
et al. 2005); (b) system of equations [5.5] to be solved to calculate the position of the 
oxidation front ξ as a function of time t (Wagner 1959). For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip High Strength Steels and Coatings 147 
Under annealing conditions, oxygen atoms dissolve in the steel, and the oxides 
of Mn, Si, Al and Cr are stable (section 5.3.1). These added elements diffuse to the 
steel surface and react with the dissolved oxygen atoms, which diffuse in the 
opposite direction. Depending on the chosen operating parameters, the oxides are 
formed internally (internal selective oxidation, section 5.3.2.1) or on the steel 
surface (external selective oxidation, section 5.3.2.2) without a continuous outer 
layer of iron oxides (Guttmann 1994). 
5.3.2.1. Internal selective oxidation 
Wagner proposed the first model of internal selective oxidation of a binary A-M
alloy with the following assumptions: a single oxide MOఔ is formed whose solubility 
product, 𝐾୑୓ഌ = 𝑤୑
ఈ୊ୣ ∙ ൫𝑤୓
ఈ୊ୣ൯
ఔ
, is very small (the mole fractions 𝑤୑
ఈ୊ୣ of M and 
𝑤୓
ఈ୊ୣ of O in the ferrite are equal to zero at the oxidation front); the rate of MOఔ
formation is limited by the diffusion of oxygen O and/or solute metal M that 
oxidizes; the already-formed oxides do not interfere with the diffusion of atoms 
(Wagner 1959; Rapp 1965).

Many works have proposed improvements to the original Wagner model. For the 
selective oxidation of steels, the most comprehensive model to date considers all 
chemical elements in the steel and their oxides with non-zero solubility products 
(Huin et al. 2005; Brunac et al. 2010). Since the oxides present are barriers to 
diffusion, the oxygen flux is multiplied by the fraction of the surface area occupied 
by the metal matrix over a section of the material perpendicular to the diffusion 148 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
direction. This fraction is equal to the volume fraction occupied by the metal matrix 
if the oxides are homogeneously distributed (Kirkaldy 1971; Brunac et al. 2010; 
Leblond 2011).
5.3.2.2. External selective oxidation 
The work on internal selective oxidation (section 5.3.2.1) can be used to study 
the transition to external oxidation. Indeed, the position of the oxidation front 𝜉
depends on the oxygen flux to the steel bulk and the M flux to its surface (last 
equation of [5.5]). One can consider external oxidation as a limiting case of internal 
oxidation when the oxygen flux is negligible in front of the M flux. Now, the 
oxygen flux, given by Fick’s law, decreases if the gradient of the oxygen 
concentration in the metal matrix decreases or if the path of the oxygen atoms is 
obstructed with oxides. 
The oxygen concentration gradient decreases as the 𝑐୓
௘௤ concentration at the 
interface decreases, that is, as the dew point of N2-H2 decreases (equations [5.2] and 
[5.3]). External oxidation is favored for dew points below –30°C or –40°C 
depending on the composition of the steel. On the contrary, internal oxidation will 
be favored for dew points higher than – 10°C or 0°C (section 5.4.2.1). 
Oxygen diffusion into the steel bulk is blocked if the volume fraction of oxides 
reaches a critical value near the surface (Wagner 1959). This critical value can be 
estimated analytically from Wagner’s model by writing that the oxygen flux is a 
decreasing function of the volume fraction F of the oxides and a shape factor 𝑊 that 
characterizes them (Leblond 2011; Leblond et al. 2013). If the oxides are spheroids 
of revolution, 𝑊 is the ratio of the lengths of the major axis and the minor axis of 
the spheroid (𝑊≥1). The minor axis is perpendicular to the steel surface and, 
therefore, parallel to the diffusion direction. In this configuration, Leblond et al. 
(2013) estimated a mathematical model of the oxygen diffusivity in the presence of 
oxides. They used the analogy with a thermal conductivity calculation in a 
conducting medium containing insulating spheroidal inclusions. If 𝐷୓

diffusivity of oxygen in the unoxidized metal matrix:

Very few models of external selective oxidation exist in the continuous 
annealing domain. Gong et al. (2020a, 2021) developed a model describing the 
nucleation and growth mechanisms of external MnO oxides under isothermal 
condition and an isothermal annealing condition. The time-dependent oxide 
coverage rate and size calculated by the models agree with the experimental results 
of MnO particles formed at 800°C on a binary Fe-Mn alloy in N2-H2 at DP = –40°C. 
5.4. Coatings on high-strength steels 
Here, we propose to discuss strategies for depositing the coatings described in 
section 5.2 on high-strength steels that become covered with oxides during 
conventional continuous annealing (section 5.3.1). We will first show that these 
oxides are not wetted by the liquid metals (section 5.4.1). 
5.4.1. Liquid metal wetting of partially oxidized steels 
5.4.1.1. Wetting degradation in the presence of selective oxides 
Many publications attribute the lack defects in galvanized coatings (bare spots, 
Figure 5.9) to the presence of oxides on the surface of annealed steels (Mataigne 
2011; Staudte et al. 2011; Seyed Mousavi and McDermid 2018b). 
From the wetting point of view, annealed steels are heterogeneous solid surfaces 
composed of metallic iron more or less covered with oxides. It is well known that 
solid metals are well wetted by liquid metals, but that oxides are generally poorly 
wetted by liquid metals (Eustathopoulos et al. 1999). Figure 5.10 shows wetting 
experiments (section 5.2.1) by a Zn-Al alloy (0.2 wt.%) of metallic iron surfaces 
more or less covered by SiO2, with the surface fraction 𝑓ୗ୧୓మcovered by SiO2 varying 
from 0.2 to 100% (Diawara 2011; Giorgi and Koltsov 2017). Two examples of these 
surfaces are shown in Figures 5.10a, b. Drops of Zn-Al at 450°C deposited on these 
substrates spread and reach a contact angle denoted 𝜃௙ at the end of spreading. The 
evolution of 𝜃௙ is plotted as a function of 𝑓ୗ୧୓మ in Figure 5.10c. The experimental 
points are represented by black squares and compared to an apparent contact angle 
𝜃஼ estimated in either of two cases: 150 New Advanced High Strength Steels

Fe/Zn-Al interface (section 5.2.2.1). At equilibrium, 𝜃஼ verifies equation [5.9] with

– The drop does not penetrate between the SiO2 particles and rests on a composite 
air/SiO2 surface. At equilibrium, 𝜃஼ verifies equation [5.10] (Figure 5.10c): 
cos 𝜃஼ = −1 + 𝑓ୗ୧୓మ + 𝑓ୗ୧୓మ cos 𝜃ୗ୧୓మ [5.10] 
Figure 5.9. (a) Bare spot defect in the Zn coating of a TRIP MnSi steel: EDS analysis 
in the defect showed enrichment in Mn and Si, attributed to the presence of SiO2 and

Zn coating of a boron-containing ferritic steel: Auger analyses in the defect showed 
Mn and B enrichment, attributed to the presence of MnB2O4 (Mataigne 2011; Giorgi 
et al. 2012) 
Note that 𝜃஼, estimated by equations [5.9] and [5.10], is called the Cassie angle, 
obtained at thermodynamic equilibrium on heterogeneous surfaces (Cassie and 
Baxter 1944). High Strength Steels and Coatings 151 
At 450°C, the final contact angle of Zn-Al (0.2 wt.%) on pure Fe is about 20° 
and on SiO2 is 160°. This contact angle increases with the surface area fraction 
covered by SiO2. The transition between wetting and non-wetting corresponds to
𝑓ୗ୧୓మ around 35% under the experimental conditions of the dispensed drop device 
used. For 𝑓ୗ୧୓మ below this 35% limit, Fe/SiO2 substrates are wetted by Zn-Al 
(0.2 wt.%) with a contact angle less than the Cassie angle for Fe2Al5Znx/SiO2 
substrates (Figure 5.10c). In a dispensed drop experiment, the initial wetting is 
forced by the kinetic energy of the drop, which reaches a maximum spreading 
diameter before receding and stabilizing at its final position. The final contact angle 
is then a receding angle 𝜃௥, close to the contact angle measured on the best-wetted 
parts of the surface (in this case, Fe2Al5Znx formed on metallic iron). For 𝑓ୗ୧୓మ more 
than 35%, the final contact angle is close to the Cassie angle for air/SiO2 substrates. 
This means that, in this case, gas bubbles are trapped under the drop between the 
SiO2 particles.

surface fraction: (a) 34 ± 6% ; (b) 74 ± 10% ; (c) contact angles (black squares) of a

In conclusion, oxides can cause wetting problems with galvanizing alloys 
because of their nature. They can also promote the entrapment of gas bubbles at the 
liquid metal/steel interface. The latter interpretation is even truer on industrial lines 
where gas bubbles can be entrained at the entrance of the steel sheet into the liquid 
metal in case of non-wetting (Mataigne 2011, 2017). 
5.4.1.2. Mechanisms of interaction between Zn alloys and oxidized steels 
The presence of oxides on the steel surface does not always result in coating 
defects. If the oxide coverage is low enough (less than a few tens of percent, Figure 
5.10c), the liquid metal contacts the metallic iron and the intermetallic compound(s) 
that provide coating adhesion (section 5.2.2) can form. 
Several mechanisms that explain the formation of these interface compounds are 
mentioned in the literature. 
The predominant mechanism relies on the detachment of the oxides from the 
underlying steel, following the dissolution of the iron underneath the oxide particles 
or films and the nucleation/growth of the interface compounds (Cho et al. 2013; Sagl 
et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2019). The oxides then become incorporated into the 
inhibition layer (Figure 5.11, Paunoiu 2018). Another mechanism, with very slow 
kinetics, which is not expected to affect wetting, is the reduction of oxides by 
dissolved Al in Zn alloys (Kavitha and McDermid 2012; Cho et al. 2013). The 
Al2O3 layer formed around the oxides indeed blocks this reduction very quickly 
(Sagl et al. 2013).

annealed at 860°C in N2-H2 (3 vol.%) with a dew point of –40°C and galvanized in a 
Zn-Al alloy (0.122 wt.%). The EDS map of Fe (green), Al (red), Mn (yellow) and Zn 
(blue) shows that the Mn-rich oxides (yellow) are embedded in the Fe2Al5Znx 
inhibition layer (red) and δ (blue) (section 5.2.2.1; Paunoiu 2018). For a color version 
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip High Strength Steels and Coatings 153 
5.4.2. Process adaptations for galvanizing high-strength steels 
The oxide detachment mechanism discussed earlier (section 5.4.1.2) only works 
if the oxides are spaced far enough apart to allow contact between the galvanizing 
alloy and the metallic iron. During conventional continuous annealing at low dew 
point (–30°C or –40°C), selective oxidation is mainly external (section 5.3.2.2). 
However, since high-strength steels contain high levels of alloying elements, more 
oxidizable than iron (section 5.3.1.2), the surface area fraction covered by oxides 
after annealing is high, which results in significant wetting degradation (Figure 5.9). 
The solution to galvanize these high-strength steels is to find annealing operating 
conditions that favor selective oxidation in the internal mode rather than in the 
external mode. Two industrial technologies have been developed to achieve this: 
increasing the dew point of the N2-H2 mixture (section 5.4.2.1) or starting the 
annealing with an iron oxidation step (section 5.4.2.2). 
5.4.2.1. Increase of the dew point 
We have described the main oxides formed in high-strength steels during 
recrystallization annealing (section 5.3.1.2). Here, we will show that it is possible to 
control where they form in the steel by changing the dew point (and thus the 
oxidizing power) of the annealing gas atmosphere. 
In Wagner’s model, the position of the oxidation front 𝜉 depends on the oxygen 
flux to the steel bulk (section 5.3.2.1). One solution to increase this oxygen flux and 
thus promote internal selective oxidation is to increase the oxygen concentration 
gradient, that is, to increase the concentration 𝑐୓
௘௤ at the steel surface and thus the 
oxidizing power of the gas atmosphere. An industrial solution consists of injecting 
water vapor (equations [5.2] and [5.3]) into the annealing gas atmosphere without 
reaching the thermodynamic conditions of iron oxides’ stability. Numerous 
publications have proven that bare spot defects in galvanized coatings (Figure 5.9) 
disappear (e.g. Staudte et al. 2011; Seyed Mousavi and McDermid 2018b) and that 
wettability by liquid zinc alloy improves (Bordignon and Vanden Eynden 2007) 
when the dew point of the annealing gas atmosphere increases. This is attributed to 
the decrease in the surface area fraction covered by oxides following the selective 
oxidation transition from an external to an internal mode (Figure 5.12). 
The first example chosen concerns ferritic steels hardened with Mn, Si and P and 
containing boron. Boron diffuses interstitially into the ferrite with a higher diffusion 
rate than oxygen. For usual annealing atmospheres, at a low dew point of −40°C, the 
boron flux to the surface is higher than the oxygen flux entering the steel. Under 
these conditions, an external boron oxide film forms (Figure 5.9b; Mataigne 2011; 
Giorgi et al. 2012). The dew point of the annealing atmosphere is increased slightly 154 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
from −40°C to −20°C to avoid wetting defects induced by this oxide. The incoming 
flux of oxygen becomes dominant again and the boron oxides form below the steel 
surface.

annealed at 860°C in N2-H2 (3 vol.%) with a dew point of (a) −40°C; (b) −20°C; (c) 
0°C. The selective oxides appear in black and the steel in gray. The oxidation depth 
increases with increasing dew point (Paunoiu 2018)

N2-H2 (5 vol.%) and partially immersed at 460°C in Zn-Al (0.2 wt.%): (a) when the 
annealing dew point is −35°C, the steel is uncoated; (b) TEM analysis shows that the 
uncoated steel is covered with SiO2 and Mn2SiO4 films; (c) when the annealing dew 
point is +10°C, the resulting Zn coating no longer exhibits wetting defects (Staudte 
et al. 2011). For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels. 
zip High Strength Steels and Coatings 155 
TRIP MnSi and TRIP MnAl steels are other examples of successful industrial 
galvanizing due to increased dew point in annealing (Staudte et al. 2011). After 
annealing in an atmosphere of N2-5 vol.% H2 with a conventional dew point of 
−35°C, a TRIP steel grade alloyed with 1.7 wt.% Mn and 1.7 wt.% Si is not wetted 
by the zinc alloys (Figure 5.13a). The reason for this non-wetting is the precipitation 
during annealing of an external selective oxide film consisting of SiO2 and Mn2SiO4 
(Figure 5.13b). Conversely, if the annealing is carried out with a dew point of 
+10°C, the selective oxidation switches to the internal mode, which keeps metallic 
the surface of the annealed steel and thus ensures a good wetting (Figure 5.13c). 
When the content of oxidizable alloying elements is too high, the mass fraction 
of oxides formed during annealing can reach the critical threshold defined by 
equation [5.8], above which oxidation becomes external, even if the dew point is 
high. In this case, an increased oxidizing power leads to the precipitation on the steel 
surface of oxides, containing Fe, which become stable, like Fe2SiO4. These mixed 
oxides cover the steel surface entirely, and galvanizing becomes impossible. 
For steels rich in Mn compared to Si and Al, such as DP steels or duplex steels, 
the first oxides formed are mixed oxides Mn2SiO4 and MnAl2O4 (section 5.3.1.2). 
MnO can then precipitate. A simple order-of-magnitude calculation allows us to 
evaluate the possibility of forming MnO from the ratios of the mass fractions of Mn 
and Si, on the one hand, and Mn and Al, on the other hand: 
– The formation of Mn2SiO4 consumes 1 mol of Si and 2 mol of Mn. For MnO to 
form, the molar fraction of Mn must be greater than twice the molar fraction of Si in 
the steel. Considering the mass fractions of Mn and Si and noting 𝑀୑୬ and 𝑀ୗ୧ the 
molar masses of Mn (55 g·mol–1) and Si (28 g·mol–1), we obtain: 
୵୲.% ୑୬
୵୲.% ୗ୧ = ୫୭୪.% ୑୬
୫୭୪.% ୗ୧

ெ౏౟
≥ 4 [5.11] 
– Similarly, the formation of MnAl2O4 consumes 2 mol of Al and 1 mol of Mn. 
For MnO to form, noting 𝑀୅୪ the molar mass of Al (27 g·mol–1), it is necessary that:

୫୭୪.% ୅୪

≥ 1 [5.12] 
When the composition ratios given by equations [5.11] and [5.12] are less than 4 
and 1, respectively, an increase in the dew point will promote the internal selective 
oxidation of Mn2SiO4 and MnAl2O4 as expected. Conversely, when these 
composition ratios are higher than the values given by equations [5.11] and [5.12], 
MnO precipitates. However, the MnO/FeO solid solution is an ideal solution. 156 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Increasing the annealing atmosphere’s oxidizing power can enrich the first MnO 
particles growing on the steel surface with FeO (even if pure FeO is not stable). An 
increase in oxidizing power to promote selective internal oxidation of Mn will have 
the opposite effect to that sought by developing a covering external oxide 
increasingly rich in FeO (Mataigne 2011; Staudte et al. 2011, 2013). There is then 
no longer a boundary between selective and total oxidation: the oxidation always 
remains external. In this case, a total pre-oxidation process can be considered 
(section 5.4.2.2). 
5.4.2.2. Total iron pre-oxidation 
When dew point rise does not work to force selective oxidation to proceed 
internally, another industrial technology can be implemented for annealing with two 
successive steps (Bordignon et al. 2004; Bordignon and Goodwin 2021). The first 
step of total oxidation stabilizes an iron oxide covering the steel surface. The second 
step is carried out under a reducing atmosphere for the iron oxides but remains 
oxidizing for the most oxidizable alloying elements. This process is used in the 
industry for Mn-rich steels. 
The first treatment step, which allows for surface oxidation of the iron, must 
occur during the annealing heating step at a temperature low enough that enrichment 
of the iron oxide with oxidizable alloying elements is minimal. Because Mn 
diffusion becomes active above 600–650°C (Ollivier-Leduc et al. 2010; Gong et al. 
2020b), the iron oxidation step must be completed before the sheet reaches 650°C. 
Suppose this step is performed at too high a temperature. In that case, the oxide 
formed on the surface will become enriched in Mn, its stability will increase, and it 
will no longer be possible to reduce it during the second part of the annealing. This 
first step can be achieved by localized injection of oxygen into the furnace or by 
adjusting the air/CH4 ratios if the preheating is performed in a direct flame furnace
(in these furnaces, the steel strip is in contact with the combustion atmosphere of the 
burners). 
The second stage of annealing, which extends to the end of the high-temperature 
holding, is carried out under a reducing N2-H2 atmosphere for the iron oxides. The 
hydrogen reduces the iron oxide on the surface of the steel (equation [5.13], Figure 
5.14), restoring the metallic state on the surface, which is necessary for proper 
wetting by the galvanizing alloy. The reduction of iron oxide by Mn at the FeO/steel 
interface releases oxygen atoms that diffuse inside the material (equation [5.14], 
Figure 5.14), ensuring the internal mode formation of selective oxides of oxidizable 
alloying elements, such as manganese. Figure 5.14 shows the case of a Mn-rich DP 
steel galvanized in Zn-0.2 wt.% Al after the pre-oxidation/reduction treatment 
discussed here. The steel surface consists of a thickness of about 100 nm of metallic High Strength Steels and Coatings 157 
iron (3, Figure 5.14) that originates from the reduction of iron oxide and a zone of 
internal Mn oxidation (4 and 5, Figure 5.14) of about 1 µm in thickness. Sufficient 
wetting of the surface reduced iron by the liquid metal allowed the formation of a 
continuous layer of Fe2Al5Znx. 
Figure 5.14. Cross-section of a DP steel (1.0 wt.% C and 1.7 wt.% Mn) that has

tube furnace before being galvanized in Zn-Al (0.2 wt.%). The Fe2Al5Znx inhibition 
layer (2) is continuous on the reduced iron (3). Mn is oxidized internally (4-5) (private 
communication, Musik, ArcelorMittal; Mataigne 2011). For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
5.4.2.3. Decarburization 
High-strength steels are generally richer in carbon (in the range of 0.1 to 
0.25 wt.% C). Carbon participates in selective oxidation reactions along with the 
other oxidizable alloying elements in the steel (equation [5.15]). Under annealing 
conditions, the CO formed is gaseous. A hypothetical internal oxidation of carbon 
would have to produce gaseous CO at a pressure exceeding the internal stress of the 
steel, which is very high in high-strength steels and therefore impossible. This 
means the oxidation of carbon is always external. This decarburization forms a 
ferrite layer on the steel surface (Liu et al. 2011; Paunoiu 2018; Seyed Mousavi and 
McDermid 2018a). The CO produced then oxidizes to CO2 (equation [5.16]), which 
decreases the oxidizing power of the gas atmosphere seen by the steel. The 
decarburization reaction thus promotes the external selective oxidation of the other 
alloying elements. In practice, the level of steam injection into the furnace to 
achieve the internal selective oxidation of the oxidizable alloying elements must be 
adjusted to the amount of CO produced. This amount of CO can be calculated by 
solving the carbon diffusion equation in the decarburized zone. The first boundary 
conditions is a zero carbon concentration on the steel surface. The second boundary 
layer is written at the decarburized zone/steel interface. The carbon concentration is 158 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
equal to the carbon concentration in ferrite in equilibrium with austenite at the 
temperature considered. 
C+HଶO ⇆ CO + Hଶ [5.15] 
CO + HଶO ⇆ COଶ + Hଶ [5.16] 
Surface decarburization may be desired to improve the resistance to liquid metal 
embrittlement (LME). Zinc-coated high-strength steels can be susceptible to a loss 
of hot ductility caused by the penetration of liquid zinc into the grain boundaries. 
This sensitivity manifests in the loss of mechanical strength of resistance welded 
joints. 
Embrittlement of steel grain boundaries by liquid zinc can occur at high 
temperatures during spot welding when three conditions are met: low miscibility 
between liquid zinc and steel iron, the presence of high-energy grain boundaries (i.e. 
high disorientation) and the application of tensile stress that can open the embrittled 
grain boundaries (Bhattacharya 2018; Bhattacharya et al. 2021; Razmpoosh et al. 
2021; Zapico Álvarez et al. 2021). 
– The poor miscibility between Zn and Fe can occur when the steel contains 
elements such as Si or C that have low solubility in liquid Zn. In the presence of 
these elements, the kinetics of the dissolution reactions of iron in liquid zinc and 
diffusion of zinc into the solid iron crystal are slow because they are limited by the 
diffusion of Si and C from the steel/liquid metal interface to the steel bulk. Until 
the concentration of these two elements is sufficiently reduced at the interface, the 
diffusion kinetics of zinc into the steel grain boundaries is the fastest (Zapico 
Álvarez et al. 2021). 
– At high temperatures, zinc penetration occurs in high-energy grain boundaries, 
with a driving force defined by the difference between the surface energy of the 
grain boundary and twice the energy of the steel/liquid zinc interface. These grain 
boundaries then undergo a wetting transition (complexion) as soon as their zinc 
content exceeds a critical value (Kaplan et al. 2013), and their mechanical strength 
becomes that of a liquid. 
– A tensile stress applied at this time will open these joints, which have lost their 
mechanical strength. The wetting transition of these joints continues through the 
thickness of the steel until it breaks completely. Thermal gradients between 
the center and the periphery of the welding electrode creates this tensile stress in the 
steel. High Strength Steels and Coatings 159 
These high-strength steels can be protected from liquid zinc embrittlement. The 
solution is the decarburization of the steel surface and the formation of selective 
silicon oxides near the future steel/coating interface during annealing. In this case, 
since the concentrations of Si and C in the ferrite are very low, the kinetics of the 
dissolution of iron in liquid zinc and diffusion of zinc into the iron crystal become 
the fastest and the penetration of liquid zinc into the grain boundaries becomes 
impossible. 
A difficulty may appear when decarburization and wetting must be obtained for 
the richest steels in Mn. These are annealed according to the total pre-oxidation 
process at low temperature, followed by a reduction phase in a H2-rich atmosphere 
(section 5.4.2.2). The decarburization is then strongly slowed down because it can 
only occur during the last part of the annealing when the iron oxide covering the 
surface has been reduced. The right compromise is obtained by adjusting the speed 
of the steel strip, and thus its residence time, in the different parts of the annealing 
furnace. 
5.4.3. Use of other coating processes 
As the introduction explains, the continuous galvanizing process is the most 
economical because it combines two operations in one treatment: recrystallization 
annealing and coating. However, for the more alloyed steel grades, it may not be 
possible to achieve good wetting by the liquid zinc alloys if the high dew point 
annealing (section 5.4.2.1) or the pre-oxidation/reduction process (section 5.4.2.2) 
does not result in a sufficiently metallic surface upon immersion. 
Two other zinc coating processes can be used in these situations: electroplating 
and physical vapor deposition (PVD). These processes take place after the annealing 
treatment and provide a metallic steel surface after annealing through a low￾temperature chemical pickling step. The acids used are either hydrochloric acid or 
sulfuric acid. These acids can dissolve simple oxides of Mn and Fe and mixed 
oxides containing Si or Al (such as MnAl2O4 and Mn2SiO4), but not SiO2 and Al2O3. 
For steels rich in Si and/or Al, care is then taken to anneal under sufficient oxidizing 
power so that the iron participates in the surface oxidation in order to generate an 
oxide that dissolves easily during pickling. These two processes also allow simpler 
metallurgical routes because the cooling at the end of the annealing process is 
carried out without the constraint of a temperature step necessary for the immersion 
in the liquid metal bath characteristic of hot-dip galvanizing.
Zinc electroplating is the oldest of these processes, developed several decades 
ago (Winand 2010). After pickling, the steel strip is passed through an electrolytic 160 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
cell. The acidic electrolyte, based on chlorides or sulfates, is rich in Zn2+ ions, which 
come either from dissolving zinc anodes or from a supply of zinc salts in the case of 
insoluble anodes. The steel strip is the system’s cathode and receives solid Zn 
deposition under the action of the imposed electric current. This deposition is 
accompanied by a release of dihydrogen at the steel surface. High-strength steels are 
sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement. They must be annealed, after the Zn deposition, 
at a temperature below the Zn melting point to ensure sufficient desorption of the 
hydrogen charged into the steel during electroplating. 
PVD processes for Zn coatings have been industrialized more recently. Zinc is 
particularly suitable for PVD deposition due to its high saturation vapor pressure in 
equilibrium with the liquid phase (1.91 × 10–4 atm at the melting temperature of Zn; 
Cheynet and Chaud 2001). In this process, Zn vapor is created and deposited on the 
steel strip that runs inside a chamber maintained under vacuum (~0.1 mbar). The Zn 
retains its metallic state due to the vacuum maintained in the chamber. This coating 
technique is often too slow to allow industrialization. However, recently, a jet vapor 
deposition (JVD) technology, industrialized in 2016, has enabled deposition rates of 
the order of 10 µm of Zn per second, compatible with the usual rates of steelmaking 
processes (Chaleix et al. 2021). The main advantage of vacuum processes over 
electroplating is to avoid hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels. 
5.5. Conclusion 
The development of high-strength steels makes the deposition of metallic 
coatings against corrosion much more critical. In the conventional continuous 
galvanizing process, the coating quality and its adhesion to the steel surface require 
the continuity of the metallic bond between the steel and the coating. This condition 
is difficult to meet for high-strength steels, as they are necessarily alloyed with 
highly oxidizable elements, such as Mn, Cr, Si and Al. Conventional annealing 
processes cannot avoid the accumulation of oxides of these elements on the steel 
surface during annealing, and wetting in liquid zinc is no longer ensured. 
Two annealing processes have been developed to solve this problem. The first 
technique involves annealing under a higher oxidizing power but still low enough to 
avoid iron oxidation. The selective oxidation then takes place preferentially in the 
internal mode. The surface of the annealed steel retains its metallic character 
sufficiently to guarantee good wetting and good adhesion of the coating. For the 
most Mn-rich steel grades, for which the stable, selective oxide is MnO, the simple 
increase in the oxidizing power during annealing is insufficient because the 
oxidation remains external due to the dissolution of FeO in MnO. The industrial 
solution for coating these steels consists of annealing in two operations. The first High Strength Steels and Coatings 161 
step is carried out under oxidizing conditions for iron with a temperature low 
enough for the diffusion of Mn to remain negligible. The second step is performed at 
a higher temperature, during which the iron oxides are reduced by H2 on the steel 
surface and Mn at the FeO/steel interface. The oxygen atoms from this last reduction 
allow the precipitation of selective oxides in internal mode. 
When these annealing atmosphere management processes are insufficient to 
guarantee good coating adhesion, electroplating or vacuum deposition processes can 
be used. These processes are more expensive since they are not coupled with 
annealing. However, they allow localizing an intermediate step of pickling between 
annealing and coating, guaranteeing the obtaining of a metallic steel surface 
necessary to the good adhesion of the coating.

6.1. Introduction 
The focus here is on the development of corrosion resistant steels – including 
low temperature wet corrosion and hot oxidation – with high mechanical properties 
at room temperature, but also with a high creep resistance at elevated temperatures. 
Thus, this chapter is mainly – but not exclusively – concerned with so-called 
“stainless” steels. Far from being exhaustive, this chapter is structured around 
examples showing how various mechanisms and concepts have been exploited to 
develop certain categories of high strength alloys with either good resistance to wet 
corrosion (weathering steels, austenoferritic duplex stainless steels [DSS], 
precipitation-hardened martensitic stainless steels), or good resistance to hot 
oxidation and creep (ferritic-martensitic steels, alumina-forming austenitic [AFA] 
steels). Moreover, the characteristics of alloys are often linked to the processing 
techniques; therefore, the links between processes, microstructure and properties 
will be highlighted when necessary. Among other things, it would be difficult today 
to ignore additive manufacturing processes, which will be illustrated with specific 
examples. 168 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
6.2. General principles of corrosion/oxidation and corrosion/oxidation 
resistance 
Corrosion can be defined as a loss of metal, in the sense of a decrease in the 
quantity of elements in the metallic state. It involves the oxidation of metals, with, 
for example, metallic iron, from oxidation state 0, passing to oxidation state +2 
(dissolution in the form of Fe2+, formation of hydroxide Fe(OH)2 or oxide FeO, etc.). 
The oxidation of most metals is thermodynamically favorable under usual 
conditions, whether in an aqueous medium or in a hot atmosphere, with a few 
exceptions (the so-called “noble” metals such as gold or platinum, copper which can 
be stable in the metallic state in an aqueous medium under certain conditions, or the 
reduction of silver in air by heating it moderately). Thermodynamically, it is 
therefore generally impossible to prevent the oxidation of steels, since they are 
iron-based and contain alloying elements that are themselves oxidizable. To make 
metallic objects resistant to corrosion, several strategies are used. The first, 
pragmatic one, consists of taking into account the metal loss in the dimensioning of 
the parts, by imposing an initial thickness higher than the expected loss by corrosion 
over the entire lifetime. This requires knowledge of corrosion kinetics, but the 
principle has been incorporated into many engineering codes and standards. Some 
strategies consist of playing on factors that are external to the material, by modifying 
the thermodynamic conditions of exposure (cathodic protection) or by isolating the 
steel from the corrosive environment thanks to a coating (see Chapter 5), which 
requires an additional operation in the manufacture of the parts. These strategies will 
not be detailed in this chapter, which focuses on the behavior of uncoated steels. The 
corrosion resistance of steels, which is generally not based on thermodynamic 
immunity, can also be improved by “isolating” the metal from the corrosive 
environment with a non-metallic layer on the surface, originating from the substrate 
oxidation itself. This is another strategy, which consists of exploiting the 
“spontaneous” growth, or in forcing the growth, on the surface, of a stable oxide 
layer which isolates the material from the external environment and thus stops or 
slows down the corrosion. This strategy is called passivation; we will understand it 
here in a broad sense, even if this term is rather used in the case of wet corrosion at 
low temperature and rarely in the case of hot oxidation. The two situations differ in 
the nature of the layers formed, in their thickness and in their formation 
mechanisms. Under hot conditions, these layers are usually the result of natural 
oxidation and are often micrometers or tens of micrometers thick. Passivation in 
a wet environment, on the other hand, is usually induced chemically or 
electrochemically prior to use, with layers typically a few nanometers thick. If the 
oxide layer formed does not sufficiently insulate the metal, that is, if it is permeable, 
locally degraded or degradable, it can give way to various attack mechanisms, 
including localized corrosion (pitting, intergranular corrosion, stress corrosion Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 169 
cracking, etc.). The same is true for high temperature exposure, where spalling, 
internal oxidation, etc., can be observed. The physical phenomena and mechanisms 
associated with each category of material will be presented in the corresponding 
sections. 
6.3. Wet corrosion resistant and high strength steels 
This part is devoted to steels that are resistant to wet corrosion, that is, during an 
interaction with an aqueous environment, whether we consider a large volume of 
solution or a water film. When a steel is put in the presence of water, two 
electrochemical reactions can occur: an elementary anodic reaction corresponding to 
the oxidation of iron (Fe → Fe2+ + 2e–
, or Fe → Fe3+ + 3e–
) and an elementary 
cathodic reaction of reduction of an oxidant present in the medium, such as oxygen 
or protons (O2 + 2H2O + 4e– → 4OH–
, or 2H+ + 2e– → H2), considering a relatively 
pure water. These half-reactions involve, on the one hand, electron exchanges, 
indicating the electrochemical nature of the corrosion and consequently the 
importance of the potential and the existence of associated currents, and, on the 
other hand, H+ and/or OH–
, indicating the role played by the pH. These synergistic 
effects can be seen in a Pourbaix diagram, which represents, in pH-potential 
coordinates, the thermodynamic stability domains of a metal. Thus, the Pourbaix 
diagram of iron includes three domains: the immunity domain, where the metallic 
iron is stable, domains of corrosion, for which the stable form is a cationic oxidized 
species, thus soluble, and possible domains of passivation, associated with 
uncharged oxidized forms, thus in solid form in aqueous medium (oxides or 
hydroxides). Depending on the microstructure of the material, the nature of the 
medium and various physicochemical parameters, the interaction of the steel with 
the aqueous medium may lead to the formation of Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions and their passage 
into solution, that is, to corrosion. In other cases, hydroxides or oxides will form: 
depending on the formation mechanism of these species and their stability, the 
dissolution kinetics of iron will be different. Baroux (2014) distinguishes two 
situations. The first corresponds to the case where the surface will become covered 
with an oxide or hydroxide as a result of a dissolution reaction followed by 
precipitation; depending on the properties of this layer, the dissolution kinetics of 
the steel may or may not be slowed down considerably: these are the processes that 
are exploited for so-called “weathering” steels, discussed in section 6.3.1. In the 
second situation, the material is sufficiently oxidizable to react directly with water to 
form a stable and protective oxide film, called a passive film: this paradox of 
passivity will be illustrated by discussing some aspects of the corrosion of high 
strength stainless steels (section 6.3.2). 170 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
6.3.1. Weathering steels 
Weathering steels are low carbon steels in which certain alloying elements (Cu, 
Cr, Ni, P, etc.) have been added for a total of at least 1% by weight, but not 
exceeding 5%. These elements will give these steels excellent mechanical properties 
and a high resistance to atmospheric corrosion. The latter is based on the ability of 
these steels to corrode when exposed to urban, rural, marine, etc., atmospheres, but 
forming corrosion products that are denser and more adherent than those formed on 
conventional carbon steels. Therefore, it is precisely their corrosion products that 
will give weathering steels their corrosion resistance (Townsend et al. 1994). This 
concept was exploited as early as 1933 by the US Steel Company, which proposed 
the “USS-Cor-Ten steel” grade, whose name reflected the advantages of these new 
steels over simple carbon steels: “cor” referred to the excellent resistance to 
corrosion and “ten”, for tensile strength, to the increment in mechanical resistance, 
close to 30%, which allowed for a reduction in the mass of parts and structures. 
From the 1970s onwards, certain grades of weathering steels were used for bridges, 
and in the 1990s, new steels called HPS, for high performance steel, were 
introduced. The latter are improved weathering steels, with greater weldability 
obtained by lowering the C, P and S contents, and more interesting values of 
toughness and yield strength due to control of the Mn content, while maintaining an 
excellent corrosion resistance. Today, steel manufacturers are offering grades with 
yield strengths close to 1000 MPa, and an atmospheric corrosion resistance 
corresponding to an index greater than 6 in relation to the ASTM G101 standard 
(this criterion will be specified later). All the grades available today allow 
applications for maritime and rail transport, engineering structures, construction, but 
also artistic and decorative parts. These steels are indeed very useful for applications 
where the risk of damage due to handling is high or accessibility for painting is 
difficult, and drastically reduce maintenance and surface treatment costs. Of course, 
these steels are not infallible, and the protective corrosion product layer that forms 
during atmospheric exposure can lose its properties when the chloride ion 
concentration becomes higher than 0.5 mg/100 cm2
/day, when the exposure time to 
the wet environment is prolonged or if the level of industrial pollutants is too high. 
We will not develop here the different forms of corrosion that can then develop, 
which are relatively similar to the corrosion observed on other steels. It seems more 
interesting to describe in detail the protective layer and to analyze how it differs 
from the layer of corrosion products that forms on simple carbon steels. The 
corrosion products that form on iron and its alloys, commonly called “rust”, 
correspond to a mixture of more or less hydrated oxides (hematite α-Fe2O3, 
maghemite γ-Fe2O3, magnetite Fe3O4, ferrihydrite Fe3HO8.4H2O), iron II and III 
hydroxides, oxyhydroxides (goethite α-FeOOH, akaganeite β-FeOOH, lepidocrocite 
γ-FeOOH and feroxyhyte δ-FeOOH), and various crystalline and amorphous Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 171 
compounds, depending on the steel, the environment, and the exposure time 
(Morcillo et al. 2019). On weathering steels, the corrosion products form a bilayer 
structure with a weakly adherent outer layer, consisting mainly of lepidocrocite, and 
a very adherent and protective inner layer, made of goethite and small islands of 
maghemite and magnetite. One of the existing growth models (Oh et al. 1998) 
proposes that the initial corrosion product is a mixture of lepidocrocite, amorphous 
FeOOH and goethite that forms within a few years. Then, the lepidocrocite partially 
transforms, first to amorphous FeOOH, in several years, and then to goethite after 
several decades (Figure 6.1). This stable Cr-substituted goethite layer prevents the 
entry of Cl–
 and SO4
2– anions for example, in addition to acting as a physical barrier 
due to its high density. This morphology of the layer is obtained due to the repeated 
drying/humidity cycles during its formation, as rainwater leaches the surface of the 
steel. Thus, the maximum corrosion resistance of weathering steels is only achieved 
after several years of exposure. An essential point is the high concentration of Cr 
(5–10% by weight) in the inner layer. This beneficial effect of chromium is 
reinforced in the presence of copper, which plays a fundamental role in the 
anticorrosion protection of the patina. Some authors put forward an accumulation of 
copper on the surface of the steel following the corrosion processes: the metallic 
copper layer thus formed could promote passivity by anodic polarization of iron. 
Moreover, copper is also supposed to increase the density of the layer due to the 
formation of insoluble copper complexes (especially sulfates) that would block the 
pores. Phosphorus does not play a fundamental role in corrosion; however, when 
added along with copper, it improves corrosion resistance, but has a negative impact 
on mechanical properties, as it segregates at the grain boundaries and contributes to 
a decrease in fracture resistance and ductility. Finally, nickel minimizes the 
embrittlement of the steel during hot rolling and improves the resistance to 
atmospheric corrosion in marine environments; indeed, the Ni2+ ions incorporated in 
the layer of corrosion products stabilize the Fe II and III oxides. Thus, the corrosion 
resistance of weathering steels is strongly related to their composition. The empirical 
method of calculating the CI-1 parameter, described in ASTM G101, attests to this, 
the higher the value of CI-1, the greater the resistance of the steel to atmospheric 
corrosion: 
CI-1 = 26.01 (% Cu) + 3.88 (% Ni) + 1.20 (% Cr) + 1.49 (% Si) 
+ 17.28 (% P) – 7.29 (% Cu) (% Ni) – 9.1 (% Ni) (% P) – 33.39 (% Cu)2
One of the challenges is to find the best possible compromise between various 
characteristics, including mechanical properties. Weathering steels belong to the 
category of so-called structural steels and are obtained by the same processes. The 
least resistant steels generally have a hypoeutectoid composition, which, following 172 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
hot rolling and sometimes a heat treatment known as “normalization” in the 
austenitic range, leads to a ferritoperlitic microstructure on cooling. Differences in 
composition and process parameters lead to different strengths, in particular by 
influencing the fraction of pearlite and the fineness of the microstructure. A process 
called “thermomechanical rolling” (TM), which consists of deforming the steel 
during cooling, slightly above and/or below the austenite/ferrite transformation 
temperature, leads to finer ferrite and pearlite microstructures, with higher strengths 
while maintaining a low enough carbon content to ensure ductility and weldability. 
The addition of Ti, V or Nb in low contents allows the formation of carbonitrides, 
which increase hardening and/or refine the grains. The strongest grades have a 
predominantly martensitic microstructure resulting from quenching from the 
austenitic range, followed by tempering. High-yield strength TM steels have also 
been obtained with martensitic and/or bainitic microstructures, with lower carbon 
contents than in the quenched and tempered grades. Weathering steels (with Cr, Cu, 
Ni, Si, P, etc., added) can be found in some of the above-mentioned grades. Figure 
6.2 illustrates, for various steels, trade-offs between yield strength and corrosion 
resistance index CI-1, as well as ductility and “equivalent carbon”, which is 
supposed to represent empirically weldability (which improves if Ceq decreases) and 
is calculated from the mass percentages of alloying elements: Ceq = C + Mn/6 + (Cr 
+ Mo + V)/5 + (Ni + Cu)/15. It can be seen that most of the characteristics of the 
historical “Cor-Ten B” have been improved for the other more recent grades.

6.3.2. Stainless steels 
In the usual definition, a steel is said to be stainless when it contains chromium 
and when the content of this element is greater than or equal to 12%. In fact, and in 
particular according to the standards, this critical chromium content can vary; 
moreover, depending on the nature of the other alloying elements, stainless steels 
can correspond to alloys that are very different from one another. Thus, we will 
generally distinguish ferritic and martensitic steels from austenitic steels on the one 
hand, and austenoferritic steels called “duplex” on the other hand. We will deal here 
with only two examples: martensitic stainless steels and DSS. Despite the diversity 
of their microstructures, these stainless steels share a common point, that of being 
covered, in a large majority of cases, by a film of passivity when exposed to an 
aqueous medium. This behavior is explained by the very high oxidability of 
chromium, compared to iron, which regularly leads authors discussing this subject to 
raise the nonsense of the term “stainless”. This passive film has been widely 
described in the literature as having a bilayer structure, with an outer layer 
consisting mainly of iron and chromium hydroxide, and an inner layer made mainly 174 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
of chromium oxide. Marcus (1994) clearly explains the processes of formation of 
this film based on the adsorption of oxygen or OH– from water followed by the 
nucleation and growth of an oxide. He also shows the influence of the alloying 
elements constituting the steels by distinguishing the promoters of passivity, for 
example, chromium, and the moderators of dissolution, for example, molybdenum 
and niobium. These considerations highlight the importance of the chemical 
composition of stainless steels for their corrosion resistance. However, another key 
point is the microstructure of the material, that is, the nature and distribution of the 
phases which can lead to heterogeneities of the passive film, thus reducing its 
protective character. The breakage of this film, even if only at certain points of the 
surface, is then at the origin of so-called localized corrosion phenomena, such as 
pitting corrosion, intergranular corrosion, etc. In sections 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2, we will 
try to highlight this link between corrosion behavior and microstructure, with a view 
to finding a compromise between mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. 
6.3.2.1. Austenoferritic DSS 
The first Fe-Cr-Ni ternary phase diagram showing a domain of coexistence of 
ferrite and austenite was proposed by Bain and Griffith in 1927. Based on this 
scientific breakthrough, the first industrial DSS was produced in Sweden in 1929. 
This was grade 453E (25%Cr-5%Ni) which contained only a very small volume 
fraction of ferrite. An important advance took place in 1933 in France with the 
accidental production of a duplex grade 20%Cr-8%Ni-2.5%Mo containing a very 
high ferrite content (around 25–30%). These stainless steels were produced in 
high-frequency induction furnaces with a partial vacuum that ensured the 
elimination of carbon, rudimentary deoxidation and limited nitrogen entry. The most 
important fact is that this alloy had a much higher resistance to intergranular 
corrosion than austenitic grades in many aggressive environments. Two French 
patents were then filed in 1935 and 1937. The second patent concerns a DSS with 
added copper to increase corrosion resistance in the most aggressive environments. 
DSS have constantly evolved in terms of chemical composition. These evolutions 
are often the result of compromises between the supply capacity of raw materials 
(alloying elements), the evolution of elaboration and refining technologies and the 
desired in-service properties. 
The nickel shortage in the 1950s–1960s (especially due to the Korean War) 
encouraged research into low-nickel DSS (compared to austenitic grades). 
Nevertheless, these DSS were subject to a significant loss of ductility in the heat￾affected zones (due to an increase in ferrite content). In the late 1960s and early 
1970s, another nickel shortage led to an increase in the price of austenitic stainless 
steels, making DSS financially attractive. Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 175 
At the same time, the installation of argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) 
converters or vacuum refining technology for the refining operation and of the 
continuous casting process made it possible to considerably improve the control of 
the chemical composition of DSS and to reduce their production cost. The control of 
low carbon, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen contents allowed the development of new 
DSS grades with very good stress corrosion cracking resistance.
At this stage of DSS development, nitrogen is a very important alloying element. 
It limits microstructural changes by stabilizing the austenitic phase during heat 
treatment and improves the corrosion resistance properties (pitting and crevice 
corrosion) and the mechanical strength of the alloy. Thanks to their high mechanical 
properties and very good resistance to various types of localized corrosion, some 
grades currently being developed are excellent candidates for a wide range of 
industrial applications (seawater desalination, offshore marine engineering, 
petrochemical, chemical and food processing industries, pharmaceuticals, mining 
and liquefied natural gas [LNG] processing, nuclear power plant equipment, etc.). 
The different grades are defined according to the pitting resistance equivalent 
number (PREN = % Cr + 3.3 × % Mo + 16 × % N), characterizing the resistance to 
pitting corrosion, as follows: 
Hyper Duplex ≥ 45 > Super Duplex ≥ 40 > Duplex > 35 ≥ Economical duplexes 
They all have relatively low nickel and molybdenum contents (alloying elements 
whose price fluctuates greatly). Increasing the chromium and molybdenum content 
(ferrite-forming elements) allows the addition of higher nitrogen contents (an 
austenite-forming element), thus further improving the corrosion properties of the 
DSS (up to hyper duplex). Nevertheless, the challenge of developing highly alloyed 
DSS is to control the risk of intermetallic phase formation. DSS present a relatively 
complex precipitation and phase transformation behavior. These aspects have been 
the subject of numerous academic and industrial studies. From a thermodynamic 
point of view, the number of phases likely to precipitate is very high (Figure 6.3). 
Precipitation occurs mostly in ferrite, in which the diffusion rates of the interstitial 
elements are much higher than in austenite (and the solubility of the alloying 
elements much lower). The effects of precipitates on the microstructure and on the 
properties of use depend on their nature, but also on their fraction, their size and 
their distribution in the matrix. A degradation of the properties of use (to a greater or 
lesser degree) is often observed. The mechanisms involved in the corrosion behavior 
of DSS in the presence of precipitates are still under investigation and discussion. 176 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 6.3. Schematic representation of a temperature-time-transformation curve for 
precipitation in DSS and influence of some elements (according to Charles 1991) 
6.3.2.2. Precipitation-hardened martensitic stainless steels 
Martensitic stainless steels generally contain 12–18% chromium, which gives them 
very good corrosion resistance, while the martensitic structure obtained by quenching 
the austenite gives them excellent mechanical properties, in particular a high yield 
strength. The development of age-hardened martensitic stainless steels reflects the 
desire to further improve mechanical properties by precipitation while maintaining an 
excellent corrosion resistance. Hardening is due to alloying elements such as copper, 
which is associated with the development of certain PH type steels for precipitation 
hardening. In these grades, the best known of which being 17-4PH and 15-5PH steels, 
the hardening of the steel is due to the formation of copper-rich precipitates in a 
tempered martensitic matrix. In the 17-4PH steel, this can lead to strength values 
around 1400 MPa. Of course, the hardening provided by the copper precipitates 
depends on the size of the precipitates that form during the tempering process. It is 
therefore the characteristic time–temperature relationship of the tempering process that 
will largely control the precipitation and thus the mechanical properties. Thus, most 
industrial treatments start with a solution treatment at 1040°C, which induces a 
homogeneous distribution of copper in solid solution. Following the martensitic Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 177 
quenching, an annealing treatment is applied, the most common one corresponding to 
a holding at 482°C for 1 h (H900 for a hardness of 440 HV), 566°C for 4 h (H1050, 
370 HV) or 621°C for 4 h (H1150, 300 HV) depending on the desired mechanical 
properties (Hsiao et al. 2002). These hardness values can be explained by referring to 
studies done with respect to the precipitation sequence of copper, which highlight the 
transition from precipitates with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure to a 9R structure 
(orthorhombic twins), then 3R (twins close to a face-centered cubic structure, fcc), and 
finally fcc, with a gradual increase in the size of these precipitates in the course of this 
sequence (Yeli et al. 2017). With such properties, these steels are highly valued in the 
aerospace sector in particular; as a result, good corrosion resistance is also required. 
Like other stainless steels, so-called PH steels will develop very stable passive films 
with a duplex structure. Nevertheless, they are susceptible to various forms of 
localized corrosion, including pitting. Nevertheless, the efforts made to optimize the 
mechanical properties will prove to be deleterious with regard to corrosion resistance. 
In fact, the heat treatments carried out in order to optimize the yield strength of the 
steels will induce other microstructural modifications, among which the growth of 
carbides other than chromium carbides. In the 17-4PH steel, these are niobium 
carbides, NbC: in fact, this steel is one of the so-called “stabilized” grades, that is, in 
which niobium is added up to 0.3% by mass, in particular to slow down the 
precipitation of chromium carbides, which are unfavorable in terms of susceptibility to 
intergranular corrosion, since their formation at the grain boundaries locally depletes 
the matrix in chromium. However, a tempering treatment can induce an increase in the 
NbC population, compared to what is observed after the solution treatment. Maugis et 
al. (2001) have shown that nucleation and growth of NbC carbides can be observed at 
temperatures around 600°C. Depending on the steel and its thermomechanical history, 
these phenomena can even occur at lower tempering temperatures. In addition, 
numerous works in the literature have also highlighted a very detrimental role of NbC 
carbides with respect to pitting corrosion resistance. For example, Clark et al. (2020) 
have shown, for an austenitic stainless steel, that the NbC carbides constitute cathodic 
sites. A galvanic coupling is thus established between the NbC and the matrix when 
the steel is exposed to an aqueous solution at its corrosion potential, leading to a 
preferential dissolution of the matrix near the NbC: pitting is thus observed. However, 
it has also been shown that NbCs are often found near the grain boundaries and 
therefore play a significant role in the initiation of intergranular corrosion (Clark et al.
2020). This is a paradox, since niobium was originally added to increase the 
intergranular corrosion resistance of stainless steels! This deleterious effect of NbC on 
the corrosion susceptibility of 17-4PH steel has been well explained by Barroux et al.
(2021). These authors showed that the passive film formed on these precipitates was 
not only thinner than that formed on the matrix (1.3 ± 0.3 nm on NbC vs. 2.4 ± 0.1 nm 
on the matrix), but also had a very different chemical composition (Figure 6.4). 178 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 6.4. Passive film formed on 17-4PH steel obtained by conventional metallurgy 
after polarization in 0.5 M NaCl medium at 150 mV/Ecorr: (a) STEM-EDS mapping of 
oxygen; (b) high-resolution XPS spectra of Nb 3d. The STEM/EDS mapping was 
performed by L. Laffont (Cirimat/Toulouse INP). Figure adapted from Barroux et al. 
(2021). For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
In this sense, the NbCs induce a discontinuity in the passive film formed on the 
17-4PH steel, causing a sensitization of the material to corrosion. This example 
highlights the difficulty of obtaining both excellent mechanical properties and a very 
good corrosion resistance. It is all a question of compromise, and this is the guiding Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 179 
principle of this work: a solution at a higher temperature would make it possible to 
reduce the quantity of NbC, but the mechanical properties would be modified. This 
notion of compromise, illustrated here by the search for the optimal heat treatments 
for a given alloy, is omnipresent when it comes to alloying. 
Thus, if we are interested in a set of steels, the aforementioned 17-4PH and 
15-5PH, but also PH 13-8Mo, or alloys of the latest generation such as MLX17, 
MLX19 or Ferrium S53, depending on the case, age-hardening can be achieved by 
precipitating copper and MC carbides (17-4PH and 15-5PH), NiAl intermetallics 
(PH 13-8Mo and MLX17), NiAl and Ni3Ti intermetallics (MLX19) or M2C carbides 
(Ferrium S53). However, it seems that no matter what is done, trade-offs between 
characteristics cannot be avoided. Indeed, if we consider all these materials in the 
heat treatment state leading to their highest mechanical strength, we can see in 
Figure 6.5 that none of them has a better combination of yield strength, ductility and 
chromium content (supposed to reflect corrosion resistance) than another.

strength, ductility here indicated in white in bubbles of corresponding size) and 
corrosion resistance (via Cr content) of various steels. For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
6.3.3. Process–corrosion relationship: examples in additive manufacturing 
In the current period, which sees the development of the so-called additive 
manufacturing processes, it seems difficult to deal with the correlation between 
microstructure and corrosion behavior without evoking the specificity of the 180 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
microstructures resulting from these processes. The aim here is not to describe these 
processes, of which there are many, but to discuss the trade-off between mechanical 
strength and corrosion resistance, illustrating in particular the point on the basis of 
two examples of materials produced by laser-powder bed fusion: 17-4PH steel, 
studied in the previous section for its version produced by conventional metallurgy, 
and austenitic stainless steel 316L. 
Strongly inspired by the efficiency of rapid prototyping of polymer parts, the 
application of additive manufacturing processes to metals was first approached as a 
way to reproduce existing parts without machining operations, and then to develop 
parts with a design integrating several functionalities while eliminating assembly or 
shaping operations. The specifications for these processes included, of course, 
maintaining properties that were at least as good as those obtained with conventional 
manufacturing processes. This applies to mechanical properties as well as to 
corrosion resistance. One of the first difficulties encountered was the formation of 
pores during additive manufacturing processes, with so-called gaseous pores formed 
during the solidification of the material due to the trapping of gas in the liquid phase, 
and pores linked to a lack of fusion (Leo et al. 2019). Many authors have shown that 
these pores have a negative influence on mechanical properties, leading to a lack of 
repeatability and a drastic drop in elongation to fracture (Lebrun et al. 2014). These 
pores also contribute to explain lower hardness values and have been identified as 
crack initiation sites. Furthermore, these same defects are also detrimental to the 
corrosion resistance of the materials. Thus, many authors have highlighted an 
increase in the susceptibility to pitting corrosion of steels produced by additive 
manufacturing in relation to porosity, with however a distinction between the two 
types of pores. Laleh et al. (2019) actually showed for the 316L steel that the 
gaseous pores, spherical and of small size (diameter lower than 1 µm), did not allow 
the establishment of conditions leading to the initiation of corrosion pits; on the 
contrary, the pores related to a lack of fusion could lead, by their very irregular 
morphology and their larger size, to phenomena of confinement of the trapped 
electrolyte, which thus quickly became sufficiently aggressive to allow the initiation 
of pits. Barroux et al. (2020) confirmed these results for 17-4PH steel obtained by 
laser-powder bed fusion, highlighting the initiation of pits on the pores due to the 
lack of melting. However, what emerges from this analysis is that, for once, the 
battle to improve mechanical properties and corrosion behavior is the same – to 
reduce porosity – a battle that can be won by optimizing the powder characteristics 
and manufacturing parameters. 
Apart from these microstructural singularities, which are specific to it, additive 
manufacturing raises other questions in the sense that, for the same state of heat 
treatment, the microstructure of a steel produced by conventional metallurgy also Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 181 
differs from that of a steel produced by additive manufacturing with regard to the 
nature, morphology and distribution of the phases. In this case, the search for high 
mechanical strength is often at odds with good corrosion resistance, and a 
compromise must be found. Let us illustrate this point by taking the example of 
17-4PH steel. For this steel, the maximum mechanical strength is obtained by 
carrying out a heat treatment called H900, which leads to an essentially martensitic 
microstructure. When this same treatment is applied to a raw steel from additive 
manufacturing, a comparable mechanical strength is obtained, as long as the 
porosity of the material is controlled. However, microstructural analyses reveal a 
very high proportion of austenite, in particular reversed austenite, compared to 
conventional steel. For example, Barroux et al. (2020) measured austenite contents 
of 0.8% and 12% for 17-4PH steels produced by conventional metallurgy and laser￾powder bed fusion, respectively. However, these same authors also showed that the 
reversed austenite content of the 17-4PH steel significantly influenced the chemical 
composition of the passive film, with an overall lower chromium content in the 
passive film formed on the additively manufactured steel (Barroux et al. 2021). This 
result can be explained by considering the alphagenic effect of chromium associated 
with a higher content of this element in martensite compared to austenite, which 
results in a passive film less rich in chromium on the islands of reversed austenite. 
This is not without consequence on the susceptibility to pitting corrosion of 17-4PH 
steel, and in particular on its susceptibility to metastable pitting (Barroux et al. 2020, 
2021). These authors effectively analyzed the current transients associated with 
metastable pits formed on 17-4PH steel from additive manufacturing: when a pit 
forms on a steel under polarization, the current increases. If the pit is metastable, this 
current drops after a few seconds, as the pit re-passivates. This current peak is called 
a current transient. For additive manufacturing steel, the current transients 
correspond to higher intensities compared to conventional steel, with longer pit 
propagation and repassivation times (Figure 6.6). 
The second example concerns 316L austenitic stainless steel, which is used in 
many industrial sectors (e.g. jewelry, food processing, nuclear, sealing and fluid 
transfer, processing industry, oil and gas and mining or marine). Being able to 
produce 316L parts by additive manufacturing is therefore a considerable 
technological and financial challenge, associated with important scientific issues. 
For these reasons, it has been the subject of many applied and fundamental studies. 
As mentioned in the previous example, additive manufacturing makes it possible to 
reduce (and eventually eliminate) assembly or forming operations that often 
generate areas with poor mechanical properties or corrosion resistance (areas 
affected thermally during welding or areas plastically deformed during forming, for 
example). Another identified challenge of additive manufacturing of 316L stainless 
steels is to be able to use a part without performing a post processing heat treatment. 182 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
These heat treatments are nowadays commonly used to homogenize the 
microstructure or relax residual stresses in classical microstructures. However, they 
are relatively complex to control and not very ecological (high energy consumption). 
The underlying idea is to optimize the conditions of elaboration of 316L by additive 
manufacturing in order to obtain directly (without post processing heat treatment) a 
specific and dense microstructure (no pores) with a low level of residual stresses so 
that the mechanical and corrosion properties are equivalent (or superior) to those of 
316L elaborated by the classical processes. 
Figure 6.6. Analysis of current transients formed on 17-4PH steels obtained by 
conventional metallurgy and additive manufacturing. Both steels are in the so-called 
H900 state. Shown here are the cumulative probabilities of the characteristic 
intensities of the current transients (according to Barroux et al. 2020) 
As in the case of 17-4PH steel, the presence of pores decreases the mechanical 
properties and corrosion resistance of 316L (Sander et al. 2017). Nevertheless, at 
present, it is possible to produce 316L without pores (fully dense structure) and this 
topic is no longer discussed extensively. The microstructure obtained by additive 
manufacturing is specific. In the case of laser-powder bed fusion, a fine 
microstructure with columnar grains (oriented in the manufacturing direction) is 
observed (Gorsse et al. 2017; Kurzynowski et al. 2018; Rosa et al. 2018; Wang et al. 
2018). The width of the grains is generally of the order of 10 µm. By comparison, Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 183 
equiaxed grains (diameter of several tens of micrometers) are present in 
conventional 316L. Under certain processing conditions, and in contrast to the 
conventional alloy in which the metal matrix (solid solution, i.e., apart from 
inclusions and particles) is chemically homogeneous, intercellular segregation of 
molybdenum, chromium and silicon can occur in additive manufacturing 
(Kurzynowski et al. 2018). This segregation leads to the formation of eutectic (i.e. 
non-equilibrium) ferrite. Submicron-scale (nanoscale to atomic-scale) analyses by 
transmission electron microscopy (Gorsse et al. 2017) reveal the existence of very 
fine dislocation cell structures. These structures are very similar to those observed in 
conventional alloys that have undergone severe plastic deformation. 
Studies show that these particular microstructural characteristics give 316L made 
by additive manufacturing, and more specifically by laser-powder bed fusion, 
superior corrosion properties to those of conventional alloys (Vignal et al. 2021). 
Nevertheless, the results are relatively scattered and, more importantly, are generally 
not explained. The main reason for this is that the description of the alloys is too 
often incomplete. Important data on the nominal chemical composition (especially 
the content of minor elements such as sulfur, nitrogen or carbon, etc.), on the level 
of residual stresses or on the physicochemical characteristics of the passive film 
(thickness, chemical composition, dopant density) are almost always missing. A 
recent study (Vignal et al. 2021) shows that the residual stresses and properties of 
the native passive film (formed in ambient air) are not affected by the elaboration 
process (conventional versus laser-powder bed fusion). On the other hand, the 
characteristics of the passive film after liquid aging under potentiostatic control can 
be significantly different from those of the passive film formed on the conventional 
alloy (Yue et al. 2020). The first-order parameter influencing the corrosion behavior 
of 316L steels developed by laser-powder bed fusion is clearly inclusional 
cleanliness (Vignal et al. 2021). In the absence of microparticles in the analyzed 
zone, the conventional 316L has an identical behavior to the 316L obtained by 
laser-powder bed fusion (Figure 6.7). Under optimal conditions of additive 
manufacturing of 316L alloy, silicate nanoparticles are generally found, while in 
conventional alloys, microparticles of Ca-, Mg-, Al-, Si- and Mn-based oxides are 
systematically found as weak points. 
Heat treatment is a privileged axis of study. Depending on the strategy chosen 
and the experimental conditions adopted, the heat treatment can lead to the 
precipitation of particles (carbides for example) or modify certain microstructural 
parameters (dislocation structures, size and crystallographic orientation of the 
grains, distribution of the alloying elements, etc.). A literature review shows that the 184 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
corrosion resistance of 316L can be improved under certain heat treatment 
conditions or decreased under other conditions. The application of a post-elaboration 
heat treatment requires a clear strategy and precise experimental conditions to 
achieve the objectives. An analysis of the state of the art suggests that at the present 
time, no strategy including clear recommendations emerges concerning 
postprocessing heat treatments.

Many applications (boilers, incinerators, chemical reactors, engines, power 
plants, fuel cells, etc.) involve temperatures high enough to make solid state 
diffusion possible. Oxidizing species (O, N, C, S) can then penetrate the material, 
and the alloying elements can diffuse to the surface to react with the external 
environment (O2, H2O, N2, carbon or sulfur compounds, etc.). Diffusion thus partly 
controls the oxidation and degradation kinetics, while thermodynamics governs the 
nature of the possible reactions. Young has provided a fairly exhaustive overview of 
oxidation situations and associated theories (Young 2008); here, we will limit 
ourselves to a few metallurgical strategies that allow the development of high￾performance steels at high temperatures. As will be seen in the examples, the alloys 
concerned often contain, among others, nickel, chromium or aluminum, and 
sometimes manganese or silicon. All these elements, like iron, are susceptible to Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 185 
oxidation. If the oxidizing species penetrate the alloy, oxidation can occur in the 
volume of the material, under the surface, in the form of precipitates (oxides, 
nitrides, carbides). In this case, we are dealing with the phenomenon of internal 
oxidation, often associated with volume variations and significant internal stresses 
as well as material embrittlement, all of which lead to rapid degradation of the alloy. 
We therefore try to avoid this phenomenon by favoring the formation of an oxide 
layer that grows on the surface, if possible slowly, without cracking or detaching 
from the substrate, with a dense morphology and acting as a barrier against the 
penetration of oxidizing species. The phenomena involved are complex, diverse and 
specific to the exposure conditions, but experience shows that, on the whole, 
chromia (Cr2O3) and alumina (Al2O3) layers best meet the specifications, even if 
iron oxides are sometimes an inevitable solution. The growth of the different types 
of layers depends on the composition of the alloy and the exposure conditions, but 
their occurrence can be represented empirically, for example, by projecting the types 
of oxides formed on ternary maps as shown in Figure 6.8a. 
Figure 6.8. (a) Schematic representation of the Fe2O3, Cr2O3 and Al2O3 oxide 
formation domains in Fe-Cr-Al alloys at 1000°C; (b) mass gain of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys as a 
function of chromium content (data from Croll and Wallwork 1972; Tomaszewicz 
and Wallwork 1978) 186 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
For example, it can be seen that more than 13% Cr is required to form a 
chromium layer at 1000°C, or that for alloys containing more than 20% Cr, only 2 or 
3% Al is required to form an alumina layer. This is understood in the majority sense, 
as there may be mixtures or solid solutions of oxides (of Fe, Ni, Cr, Al; mixed 
spinel, etc.). For about 5% of Al, on the other hand, we obtain a layer formed almost 
entirely of alumina. The exclusive formation of these layers at the expense of 
internal oxidation is only possible, however, if the diffusion flux of Cr or Al is 
sufficient to feed the growth of the oxide layer by consuming oxygen before it can 
enter the material. This flux depends mainly on the diffusion coefficient and on the 
concentration of the alloying elements; there are thresholds on the Cr or Al contents 
to avoid internal oxidation. These thresholds, which are indicative, depend on the 
composition of the alloy and the exposure conditions (temperature, nature and 
activity of the oxidizing species), and their knowledge is mostly empirical, but they 
are often of the order of 10–20 mol.% for steels (i.e. about 10–20 wt.% in Cr and 
5–10 wt.% in Al). Figure 6.8b shows the consequences, in terms of oxidation 
kinetics, of the importance of the nature of the oxide layer formed: iron being more 
soluble than nickel in chromia, it can diffuse into it to form iron-rich oxides on the 
surface; increasing the Ni content thus favors the formation of a higher proportion of 
an oxide closer to Cr2O3 and lowers the oxidation rate. The Cr content is also crucial: 
it lowers the oxidation rate, which becomes minimal from about 20% Cr, 
a phenomenon associated with the almost exclusive growth of a continuous Cr2O3
layer. On the other hand, alumina layers generally offer better protection, either at 
very high temperatures, due to the evaporation of chromia above 900–1000°C, or to 
prevent the penetration of other oxidizing species such as carbon or sulfur into the 
alloy. In the presence of precipitates that “consume” part of the chromium (carbides 
of the M23C6 or M7C3 type) or aluminum (intermetallics of the B2-(Fe,Ni)Al or 
γ'-Ni3Al type), it is rather the concentrations of “free” Cr and Al in the metal matrix 
that will condition the resistance to oxidation. The following examples will help to 
understand certain phenomena and mechanisms. They deal with high performance 
steels with different combinations of resistance to oxidation in various environments, 
mechanical resistance at high temperatures (creep resistance), processing and even 
physical properties. 
6.4.1. “9-12 Cr” ferritic-martensitic steels 
These steels are used in severe conditions, in particular in the steam circuits of 
power plants (steam generators, piping, turbines, etc.), at temperatures typically 
between 500°C and 650°C, in the presence of corrosive species (water/supercritical 
steam or gas/fumes/combustion ash), with stresses of the order of a few tens of MPa, 
over durations of several years or decades. The materials must therefore have good Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 187 
creep resistance and good oxidation resistance while allowing the production of 
piping by hot forming and welding. Some austenitic alloys (stainless steels, Fe-Ni￾Cr–based alloys, nickel-based alloys) could meet the technical specifications, but the 
steels described here are often preferred, for cost reasons, but also for their physical 
properties (better thermal conductivity, lower coefficient of thermal expansion), 
which they owe to their ferritic structure. Note that, depending on the case, they are 
called ferritic, martensitic or ferritic-martensitic steels. Indeed, a quenching step 
gives them a martensitic structure and microstructure, but annealing above 600°C 
and then prolonged exposure in service to temperatures of the same order allow 
them to recover a ferritic crystal structure while retaining the morphology of the 
martensitic microstructure, which is partly responsible for their good mechanical 
properties. These are steels that most often contain between 9 and 12% Cr by mass, 
hence their usual name “9-12 Cr” (Yan et al. 2015; Abe 2016). However, it has been 
seen that a chromium content of about 13% is necessary to form a chromium layer at 
high temperature (Figure 6.8a), which is more effective in protection than a layer of 
iron oxides, and that such protection becomes optimal for a chromium content of 
about 20% (Figure 6.8b). Chromium also allows the precipitation of M23C6 type 
carbides, which are necessary to ensure a good creep resistance. These apparent 
contradictions (modest Cr content while it is necessary for oxidation and creep 
resistance) will be discussed later on the basis of various compromises. Examples of 
steels, with their usual names and compositions, are given in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1. Common names and typical concentrations of 
the main alloying elements of some steels (% by mass) 
Many steels exist, but the table illustrates various categories. They differ in 
particular by the content of elements affecting the creep resistance, but also in Cr 
(9–12%) for the resistance to oxidation. The latter is faster in the presence of steam 
than in dry gases, as water accelerates the evaporation of chromia, which causes the 
formation of porous layers of spinel FeCr2O4 in contact with the steel and iron 
oxides Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 toward the surface (Figure 6.9a); surfaces exposed to dry 
gases are covered with a dense layer mostly constituted of chromia (Ehlers et al. 
2006; Young 2008). 188 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 6.9. 9-12Cr steels: (a) diagram of the structure of the oxidized layer of 
steels exposed to humid air around 600–700°C; (b) diagram of the microstructure 
(grains are delimited in bold lines, martensite blocks and laths in thin lines) 
In any case, alloys with 9% chromium are sufficient to withstand the less severe 
conditions (500–600°C); thus, what is insufficient at 1000°C (Figure 6.8) may be 
sufficient at 600°C (note that most steels also contain some Si, which improves 
oxidation resistance). To resist oxidation at higher temperatures (650°C), the 
chromium content needs to be increased to 11 or 12%, which forces the search for 
trade-offs with respect to mechanical properties, in particular creep resistance, which 
also need to be improved (Yan et al. 2015; Abe 2016). In addition to its contribution 
to oxidation resistance, chromium combines with carbon to form M23C6, carbides, 
mainly at the interfaces (grain boundaries, low angle grain boundaries, martensite 
interlath boundaries, Figure 6.9b). These carbides, in the range of 50–200 nm in 
size, precipitate during tempering in the 600–780°C range. They pin the interfaces 
and prevent their migration during creep. Vanadium and niobium combine with 
carbon and nitrogen to form MX-type carbides or carbonitrides during tempering, of 
the order of 10–50 nm in size, mainly within the ferrite crystals (Figure 6.9b). These 
precipitates slow down the dislocations during creep. All the precipitates represent 
1–3% of the total volume of the material. Increasing the carbon content beyond 0.1 
or 0.2% would lead to M23C6 and MX precipitates that are larger or coarsen at high 
temperature, thus being less effective, and potentially leading to weldability 
problems. Boron segregates at the interfaces, increases their cohesion and limits the 
growth of precipitates. The elements Cr, V and/or Nb can also form, in the long term 
in service, the Z phase, Cr(V,Nb)N, which degrades the mechanical properties. The 
heavy elements Mo and W strengthen the solid solution and improve the creep 
resistance by slowing down the diffusion, but too high concentrations lead to the 
formation of Laves phases, Fe2(Mo,W), which degrade the mechanical Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 189 
properties. Ni and Co contribute a little to the strengthening of the solid solution, but 
also play on the phase equilibrium at high temperature. Indeed, to obtain a 
martensitic microstructure, it is necessary to go through an austenitization step at 
about 1000 or 1100°C, followed by quenching. However, strengthening elements 
such as Mo, W, V or Nb, as well as Cr and Si, are alphagenic: increasing their 
concentration reduces the existence range of austenite to the benefit of δ ferrite, 
which then remains after quenching, this phase being detrimental to creep strength 
(Yan et al. 2015). This can be compensated for by gammagenic elements such as Ni, 
Co, C and N, but all alloying elements except Co and V lower the martensitic 
transformation start temperature, Ms (see, for example, Ishida 1995), leading to the 
presence of unwanted retained austenite. Some of the trade-offs to be sought 
between microstructural characteristics, oxidation resistance and creep resistance are 
illustrated in Figure 6.10 (Figure 6.10a uses the Thermo-Calc software, using the 
“CALPHAD” method, CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). 
Extrapolating the curves, it would thus seem possible to increase the Cr content a 
little beyond 12% while preventing the formation of δ ferrite and while maintaining 
a sufficiently high Ms temperature thanks to an increased concentration of Co, with 
austenitization in the vicinity of 1200°C, but the margin for improvement seems 
small with these elements alone. 
Figure 6.10. (a) In blue: minimum cobalt content allowing the presence of ferrite to 
be avoided, calculated for four austenitization temperatures, the other elements 
being at NF12 alloy concentrations (Thermo-Calc software, TCFE9 database). In red:

design of alloys according to different criteria. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 190 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
As the precipitation of Laves phases in service has already reached critical levels 
in recent alloys, it seems difficult to significantly increase the Mo and/or W contents 
beyond the existing ones. 
Only a global multi-objective optimization, by playing on all the elements and 
their interactions, could enable significant improvements. 
6.4.2. AFA steels 
As previously discussed, a better creep resistance than that of 9-12Cr steels, 
which is required for higher temperature applications, can be obtained for alloys 
with an austenitic structure. The higher temperatures involved in some applications 
(boilers, chemical engineering), typically in the range of 650°C–1100°C, also 
require increased resistance to oxidation. 
One of the paths followed was to increase the content of Cr, which is an 
alphagenic element, which required a concomitant increase in the content of Ni to 
guarantee the austenitic structure necessary for creep resistance (Ni also contributing 
positively to oxidation resistance by synergy with Cr, Figure 6.9b). A quasi￾continuum between iron-rich alloys on the one hand – austenitic stainless steels – 
and nickel-rich alloys on the other hand, including superalloys, with an increase in 
thermomechanical and environmental performance, has then appeared. There are 
hot-formed versions with a relatively low carbon content (such as the famous 
800/800H/800HT alloys: ~33Ni-21Cr-0.1C, wt.% + reinforcing elements like Al and 
Ti), and versions with a higher carbon content, produced by casting processes, such 
as the HK (~20Ni-25Cr-0.4C) or HP (~35Ni-25Cr-0.4C) series, which can be 
strengthened by adding Ti and/or Nb in particular. However, the best of these alloys 
have limited environmental resistance due to their protection by a chromia layer, 
which is less effective than alumina above 900°C and/or in the presence of water 
vapor as already mentioned. 
Besides, alumina-forming alloys have existed for a long time, in particular 
ferritic Fe-Cr-Al alloys, mainly used as electrical heating components, but with poor 
mechanical performance, as well as nickel-based superalloys rich in aluminum, 
reinforced by an abundant precipitation of intermetallics called γ', of the Ni3Al type, 
widely used in the hot parts of aircraft engines. While the former are rather cheap, 
the latter are very expensive. The gap between the two has been filled by the 
development, in recent years, of AFA stainless steels. Like chromia-forming alloys, 
these materials exist in the form of both hot-formed and higher carbon cast alloys 
(Brady et al. 2008; Muralidharan et al. 2016).Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 191 
The positioning of the different categories of alloys mentioned above is 
illustrated schematically in Figure 6.11. 
Figure 6.11. Schematic positioning of various families of alloys in terms of oxidation 
resistance, creep resistance and cost (from green = least expensive, to red = most 
expensive), according to the crystalline structure of the matrix and the nature of the 
protective layer. Note: There are actually large overlaps between categories. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
The main challenge for AFA steels is to maintain both the alumina-forming 
character, for which a sufficient aluminum content is required, and an austenitic 
matrix, for which a sufficient Ni content is required, whereas nickel must be 
minimized to limit the cost and aluminum is an alphagenic element. Chromium, also 
being alphagenic, contributes to oxidation resistance as well. These alloys therefore 
contain, by mass, 2.5–4% aluminum, 12–15% chromium and 12–35% nickel. Good 
creep resistance must also be ensured, for which elements such as Nb, Mo or W 
(alphagenic) are introduced in low concentrations. The addition of silicon 
(alphagenic) improves the oxidation resistance, but degrades the creep resistance, 
etc. The trade-offs are manifested in the search for balances between mechanical 
properties – achieved through solid solution and precipitation strengthening – and 
oxidation resistance. As shown in Figure 6.8a, an alumina layer can be formed at 
the expense of a chromia layer, almost independently of the chromium content, as 
long as the aluminum content is sufficient (typically a few mass%). Nevertheless, 
the oxidation resistance increases with the content of these two elements; however, 
their addition can cause the formation of δ ferrite during processing or σ phase in 
service, both of which are detrimental to the creep resistance. Strengthening is 
achieved by solid solution hardening, through heavy elements such as Mo or W, as 
well as by the precipitation of carbides (Nb-rich MC, Cr-rich M23C6 or M7C3, or 192 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Mo-rich M6C) or intermetallics (γ′-Ni3Al, B2-(Ni,Fe)Al, or Laves-Fe2(Nb,Mo) 
phase). Depending on the manufacturing process, interdendritic primary carbides (in 
cast alloys containing 0.2–0.5 wt% C) that limit grain boundary sliding, or fine 
intragranular precipitates (in wrought alloys containing less than 0.2 wt% C and in 
cast alloys) impeding dislocation movement, can be obtained. Trade-offs must be 
made between the penalizing alphagenicity of the elements involved (Al, Cr, Nb, 
Mo, W), the fraction and morphology of the precipitates and the properties. For 
example, it has been found that niobium stabilizes the alumina layer for contents of 
2.5–3 wt%, and thus improves the resistance to oxidation (contrary to N, Ti and V 
which degrade it), but its optimal concentration for creep resistance is rather around 
1 wt%. In cast alloys, a compromise is also sought on the silicon content (up to 
2 wt%), since it improves castability but degrades creep resistance. 
Table 6.2 shows the results of several comparative studies where these two 
properties were investigated. They were characterized under different conditions 
from one study to another, making it impossible to compare them, but for each study 
the alloys are ranked from the most resistant (rank 1) to the least resistant (rank 3) to 
creep and oxidation.

steels: Mural. = (Muralidharan et al. 2016)). The last two columns show, for each 
study, the ranks in terms of creep and oxidation resistance (from 1 = best to 3 = 
worst) 
These alloys correspond to the best compromises obtained between creep and 
oxidation resistance; other alloys, not optimal, are not reported here. In any case, Corrosion Resistant Steels with High Mechanical Properties 193 
this notion of trade-off is easily observed. The complex interdependencies between 
elements are not yet fully understood, but, for example, it can be noted that the best 
creep resistance is always obtained for an Nb concentration close to 1%, while the 
oxidation resistance is always the best for the maximum Nb content; this element 
thus seems to play a key role, even if the oxidation resistance seems to result from a 
synergy between Al, Cr and Nb. The consolidation of this still young field by 
experimental knowledge, theoretical description, but also the accumulation of data 
should allow in the future to propose a real search for the optimal compromises. 
6.5. Conclusion 
Far from being exhaustive, the objective of this chapter was to show, on the basis 
of various categories of steels chosen as examples, the systematic existence of 
trade-offs between the mechanical properties and the behavior of a material resulting 
from interactions with its environment, but also, depending on the case, its physical 
properties, its suitability for processing or its price. The corrosion resistance, if it is 
in the first order influenced by the composition of the alloy, depends quite strongly 
on the microstructure, in that it concerns the phases present (austenite, ferrite, 
martensite, carbides, intermetallics, etc.), their morphology, size and location, but 
also defects such as pores, the whole being the consequence of the response of the 
material to the processes. In addition, the microstructure has a major influence on 
the mechanical properties. Obtaining a good compromise between the various 
characteristics mentioned here requires knowledge and description of the phase 
equilibria as a function of temperature (austenite, α or δ ferrite, secondary phases, 
etc.), transformation kinetics (austenitization and grain coarsening, martensitic 
transformation, recrystallization and fineness of ferrite/perlite structures in TM 
steels, precipitation, etc.) and microstructure stability during service at high 
temperature (coalescence of precipitates, undesirable phases, etc.), as well as an 
in-depth knowledge of corrosion mechanisms and kinetics. 
A predictive set of data, being quantitative or at least semiquantitative (trends), 
involving for example the CALPHAD method, kinetic models, rules of thumb (see 
the Ms, Ceq, PREN or CI-1 calculations already discussed), but also data 
mining/machine learning, if the data are sufficiently numerous and diverse, may 
eventually allow the search for materials with the best possible trade-offs through 
multi-objective optimization approaches (Menou et al. 2016). 194 New Advanced High Strength Steels

7.1. Introduction and industrial issues 
Since the early 2000s, automakers have begun to massively implement ultra-high 
strength steels in automotive body structures (Cornette et al. 2001, 2005; Fonstein 
2015; Keeler et al. 2017; Allain et al. 2022) to address two major concerns which 
are:
– the tightening of crashworthiness standards, notably with the arrival of the fifth 
star, which rewards the vehicle’s passive safety performance in the Euro NCAP test. 
The first vehicle to receive this distinction was the Renault Laguna 2 in 2001;
– the lightening of motor vehicles, initially to reduce the fuel consumption of 
thermal vehicles and their CO2 emissions to meet environmental constraints; today 
to increase the range of electric or hybrid vehicles.
In this chapter, we will first describe the current tests, we will try to transpose 
the behavior of the complete vehicle on laboratory components and to relate it to 
the properties of the constituting steels. Then, we will discuss the material 
transformation steps during the manufacturing of the vehicle that influence the final 
crash behavior. Finally, we will analyze the adaptation between steels and 
components for crash behavior according to different evaluation criteria (energy 
absorption, anti-intrusion or rupture).198 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
7.2. The tests in force, or how to pass from the behavior of the 
complete vehicle to the behavior of the material 
7.2.1. Full vehicle test 
Current crash performance standards are based on full-scale tests on complete 
vehicles. Organizations such as Euro NCAP in Europe define the conditions for 
these tests and the criteria for evaluating vehicles in a crash. The occupant protection 
score is determined from frontal crash tests (Figure 7.1a), side impact tests (Figure 
7.1b), tests relating to cervical injuries as well as from an analysis of the measures 
provided to enable rapid and safe decarceration. These tests are performed to 
evaluate the protection offered by the vehicle for the driver, for the passengers, but 
also for other road users such as pedestrians. 
Figure 7.1. (a) Example of a frontal collision of the vehicle at 50 km/h on a 
progressive deformable barrier also moving at 50 km/h with 40% overlap; 
(b) Example of a lateral collision of a deformable barrier propelled at 60 km/h. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
During a frontal impact, several aspects of the car’s safety are evaluated. In order 
to protect the occupants of a vehicle, the impact forces must be directed to the 
structural components where the energy can be absorbed safely and effectively. The 
front of the vehicle must absorb the impact in a controlled manner so that the 
passenger compartment experiences the least amount of deformation possible. 
Movement of the pedals and steering wheel into the passenger compartment must be 
limited to avoid serious injury. In addition, the way the impactor truck decelerates 
during the collision and the damage inflicted by the test vehicle on the deformable 
barrier reveal the effectiveness of the interaction between the two collision partners. 
A vehicle that causes considerable deceleration of the carriage or causes significant 
localized deformation is considered “poorly compatible”. In the real world, these Crashworthiness by Steels 199 
vehicles do not always absorb their own energy as effectively as they should and 
pose a threat to other road users. 
Side impact collisions are the type of crash that accounts for the second highest 
frequency of fatalities and serious injuries. The interior of the vehicle cabin has very 
little lateral space to absorb energy and serious head and torso injuries are common. 
The corresponding tests ensure that there is adequate protection of critical body 
areas. This has led to the reinforcement of the peripheral structures of the “B-pillar” 
(the strategic body pillar between the front and rear doors) of vehicles, the 
installation of side airbags or curtain airbags, but also to the development of less 
conspicuous energy-absorbing structures integrated in the seats and door panels of 
cars. The timing and deployment of airbags must be carefully controlled to provide 
the best possible protection. 
Other tests exist to assess passenger behavior, namely rear impact, which can 
result in whiplash-type injuries to passengers. Although these accidents rarely result 
in fatalities, the consequences of the associated injuries have a considerable impact 
on individuals and society, with an estimated annual cost of about 10 billion euros in 
Europe. 
7.2.2. Component testing and performance and evaluation criteria 
Figure 7.2. Distribution of energy absorption (light gray) and anti-intrusion 
(dark gray) components in the vehicle architecture. For a color version 
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 200 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
In order to transpose the global behavior of the vehicle to the scale of the 
structural component, two types of parts are generally considered:
– The so-called fusible or energy-absorbing parts (in light gray in Figure 7.2), 
these must deform as much as possible to absorb a large proportion of the impact 
energy. The test generally used to quantify the performance of these parts is a 
dynamic axial compression test of this component.
– The so-called anti-intrusion parts (in dark gray in Figure 7.2), unlike the 
previous ones, these must deform very little to protect the passenger compartment, 
which is considered as the survival cell of the occupants. The test generally used to 
quantify the performance of these parts is a dynamic bending test of this component. 
7.2.2.1. Axial compression test on component 
During the axial compression test, the part to be tested is impacted at one of its 
ends by a mass M of initial velocity V while the other end of the component is fixed 
against a rigid wall (Figure 7.3a). The component during the test will therefore 
collapse along its length by a succession of lobes (local plastic buckling). The 
behavior of the component is described by the force-crushing curve in Figure 7.3b. 
The main characteristic quantity to be considered for this test is the average crushing 
force, as shown in Figure 7.3b. The energy dissipation is obtained by plastic 
deformation of the material during the successive formation of these lobes. 
Fluctuations around the mean value during crushing are due to these. The energy 
dissipation is thus all the more important as the lobes are numerous and as the 
process is stabilized over a significant crushing length, while transmitting a high 
effort. The peak of maximum force at the beginning has no exploitable meaning, 
because triggers (local stamping) are often used to control the buckling of the 
structure and to initiate the first lobe. Consequently, this value can be adjusted by a 
simple geometrical design of the component during the experiment.
7.2.2.2. Dynamic bending test on component 
During the dynamic bending test, the part to be tested is placed on simple 
supports or embedded at one and/or the other of its ends. It is impacted by a tool of 
mass M and initial speed V at its center or in a zone of interest (laser welding for 
example) (Figure 7.4a). The behavior of the part is described by the force-crush 
curve in Figure 7.4b. The main characteristic quantity for this test is the ultimate 
force (Fmax). This threshold corresponds to the force value for which the part will 
start to collapse and create a local deformation, which is called “plastic hinge”. 
Since the deformed areas are concentrated and not very large, the energy dissipation 
by plastic deformation of the steel is relatively low. The force curve decreases 
rapidly after the maximum force. Crashworthiness by Steels 201

7.2.3. Tests on simple specimens (strain rate and failure strain) 
During the crash tests on components described above, the characteristic quantities 
such as the ultimate force and the average force will depend, of course, on the 
geometry of the component, but above all on the local behavior, the work hardening of 
the steel and its resistance to failure. Indeed, the higher the flow stress level during the 
plastic deformation of the steel, the higher the ultimate stress or the energy absorbed 
by the component during the stress. In this section, we will discuss the sensitivity of 
steels to the strain rate and their deformation at failure as a function of the stress path, 
particularly from the point of view of modeling and numerical simulation.Crashworthiness by Steels 203 
7.2.3.1. Viscoplastic behavior of steels under uniaxial loading 
In order to evaluate the dynamic behavior of steels in uniaxial tension, Yan et al. 
(2006) give recommendations for the performance of experimental tests on high￾speed hydraulic tensile machines and so-called “Hopkinson bars” devices. The work 
hardening of steels, that is, the increase in their flow stress σ with plastic 
deformation, is a process that will depend on the deformation (different stages of 
work hardening), but also on the strain rate and temperature. It is commonly written 
that: 
σ = σሺε,εሶ,Tሻ [7.1] 
Figure 7.5 shows, for example, the evolution of the yield strength after a very 
small plastic deformation of a mild steel (0.12% C) as a function of the strain rate 
(in logarithmic scale) and temperature T. This figure shows three main domains of 
behavior. In domain I, the behavior is insensitive to the strain rate and depends 
weakly on temperature. The decrease of the yield strength with temperature can only 
be explained by the evolution of the shear modulus of the steel µ. This is called 
“athermal” plasticity. In domain II, the yield strength increases with the strain rate 
and this effect is more pronounced at low temperatures. It is a domain where the 
dislocation slip is “thermally activated”. Note that the boundary between the two 
domains is a function of temperature and velocity. Finally, at very high strain rates, 
in domain III (>10,000 s–1), the slip of dislocations is controlled by interactions with 
phonons (phonon-drag controlled plasticity) of the crystal. The yield strengths then 
increase very strongly with the strain rate. In the rest of this chapter dedicated to the 
crash, we will restrict ourselves to domains I and II, because very high strain rates 
are never reached. Similarly, the possible creep mechanisms at very low speeds will 
not be discussed. Figure 7.5 is very representative of the behavior of ferritic steels 
(ferritic, bainitic, martensitic). 
Austenitic steels exhibit similar behaviors, but transitions between domains do 
not occur at the same temperatures (Allain et al. 2010). For example, Allain et al. 
showed that an austenitic FeMnSi alloy exhibited a transition around 400 K for 
strain rates of 10–3 s–1 and that at room temperature the alloy exhibited thermally 
activated slip (domain II) throughout the rate range of interest. These regime 
changes depend directly on the elementary mechanisms controlling the mobility of 
dislocations in the phases considered. For this reason, some steels may show more 
complex behaviors in particular ranges of strain rates and temperatures (e.g. in case 
of dynamic aging). 204 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 7.5. Evolution of the yield strength of a low-carbon ferritic alloy with 
strain rate at different temperatures (Uenishi and Teodosiu 2004). For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
In the thermally activated domain, it is customary to characterize the strain rate 
sensitivity using the function m(ε,T): 
m = ቀ
∂lnσ
∂lnεሶ
ቁ
ε,T
 [7.2] 
Figure 7.6a shows the evolution of this representative function m for two ferritic 
steels, a DP600 steel and an 800 MPa grade alloy steel. In general, the strain rate 
sensitivity decreases with plastic strain in these ferritic steels. It should be noted that 
this result is specific to ferritic matrix steels and is not found for austenitic steels, 
which rather follow the Cottrell–Stockes law (Mecking and Kocks 1981; Klepaczko 
and Chiem 1986). This evolution suggests that the strain rate sensitivity of steels 
decreases with increasing dislocation density. From a more macroscopic point of 
view, Figure 7.6b illustrates the dependence of the average coefficient m on the 
mechanical strength (ultimate tensile strength [UTS]). This m is deduced from a 
simple version of the Hollomon law: 
σሺε,εሶሻ = kεnεሶ

Phase steel of grade 600 MPa and an HSLA steel of grade 800 MPa (Kot 1981); (b) 
evolution of the average strain rate sensitivity (coefficient m) as a function of the 
mechanical strength of ferritic matrix steels 
It should be noted that AHS Steels have low strain rate sensitivities. In some 
cases, their sensitivity can even become negative when they are subjected to a 
dynamic aging mechanism, as is the case for austenitic FeMnC steels or some 
medium Mn duplex steels with TRIP effect (Bouaziz et al. 2011; Callahan et al. 
2019; Lamari et al. 2020). This negative sensitivity is detrimental for stamping, but 206 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
often disappears at high strain rates and affects little the crash behavior of the latter 
steels. 
Many models have been developed to empirically describe the behavior curves 
of steels at different strain rates and temperatures (see the review by Sung et al. 
2010). The Cowper–Symonds or Hollomon-type approaches respecting the 
Cottrell–Stockes law do not reproduce faithfully the behavior of ferritic steels (m 
is assumed constant). On the contrary, models like the Tanimura–Zhao model 
(equation [7.4]), explained below, with many adjustment parameters, show better 
performances, as illustrated in Figure 7.7. This figure shows the experimental 
flow stresses of a mild steel and a dual-phase steel as a function of strain rate for 
different strain rates and the models fitted to these data (Cowper–Symonds and 
Tanimura–Zhao, respectively). In the Tanimura–Zhao law, the parameters A, B, C, 
D, E, εሶ
0, m, p and n are fitted to the experimental data: 
σሺε,εሶ,Tሻ = ቀA+Bεn+ሺC+Dεmሻlog ቀ εሶ
εሶ
0
ቁ +Eεሶ
p
ቁ ሺ1-μΔTሻ [7.4] 
These empirical relationships are of great practical interest and are used in most 
numerical simulation codes. However, the meaning of their parameterization is not 
obvious, and can be clarified by studies at the scale of physical metallurgy. 
The viscoplastic behavior derives directly from the collective dynamics of 
dislocation gliding in the steels considered. The strain rate is expressed at this scale 
in the form of Orowan’s law: 
εሶ= ρmbvത [7.5] 
where ρm is the density of moving dislocations, b is the Burgers vector of 
dislocations, and vത is the average velocity of dislocations. In many situations, ρm is 
considered constant and represents a small proportion of the dislocations present in 
the steel. vത is, on the other hand, a function of the applied stress σ and will depend 
on the nature of the “obstacles” seen by the moving dislocations. Strong obstacles, 
such as the trees in the dislocation forest, cannot be overcome by thermal agitation 
and contribute to the so-called “athermal” stress σi. This stress will depend on the 
strain hardening and plastic deformation. On the other hand, the crossing of other, 
weaker obstacles, such as interactions with the crystal lattice or carbon atoms, will 
be sensitive to temperature. The velocity of the dislocations will depend on the 
additional stress σ* needed to overcome these weak obstacles. In a very general 
way, the average velocity of dislocations can be written as:

ΔG0 is the activation energy for the crossing of the considered obstacles (of the 
order of eV), νDebye is the Debye frequency and V* an apparent activation volume 
(typically of the size of the obstacles to be crossed). In the literature, for ferritic 
steels, a degraded version of the previous expression is often found (Uenishi and 
Teodosiu 2004):

In austenitic steels, the flow stress required to move the dislocations is the sum 
of three contributions: 
σሺε,εሶ,Tሻ = σ0 + σi
ሺεሻ+σ*ሺεሶ,Tሻ [7.8] 
σ0 corresponds to lattice friction, solid solution hardening or precipitate hardening. 
Since σ0 and σi are athermal contributions, only the σ* term depends on strain rate 
and temperature. For ferritic steels, since the mobility of screw dislocations is lower 
than that of edge dislocations, Edgar Rauch proposed to write (Allain et al. 2009; 
Bui-Van et al. 2009; Pipard et al. 2013): 
σሺε,εሶ,Tሻ = σ0+ 1
2
σ*ሺεሶ,Tሻ+ 1

ට൫σ*ሺεሶ,Tሻ൯

+4൫σi
ሺεሻ൯

 [7.9] 
This last expression explains why the sensitivity of ferritic steels decreases with 
the work hardening and thus globally with the increase in the strength level of steels. 
Indeed, the work hardening σi increases and will dominate the term σ* under the 
root. This type of approach captures the velocity and temperature effects as shown in 
Figure 7.7(B[b]). Finally, it should be noted that work hardening, and thus the σi
term, can depend on temperature and strain rate through dynamic recovery (Verdier 
et al. 1998). However, this effect alone cannot explain the strain rate sensitivity of 
steels. 
For multiphase steels, the macroscopic behavior can be deduced from a 
homogenization procedure considering the individual behavior of the constituent 
phases (Montheillet and Damamme 2005; Pipard 2012). A specificity concerns 
steels with a transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect such as third-generation 
AHS Steels. Indeed, the kinetics of mechanically induced martensitic 
transformations are strongly dependent on temperature, but also on strain rate 
(Van Slycken et al. 2007; Larour et al. 2013; Callahan et al. 2019; Xia et al. 2019). 
However, it should be noted that these steels generally show very low strain rate 
sensitivity, in the trend highlighted in Figure 7.6b (e.g. see TRIP1000). 210 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Plastic deformation is an irreversible process from a thermodynamic point of 
view. Consequently, the work supplied to the material during this deformation is 
partially dissipated as heat (about 90% – this ratio is known as the Taylor–Quinney 
coefficient) and contributes to a lesser extent to increasing the internal energy of the 
steel in the form of defects (dislocations). When the heat produced in this way does 
not have time to be evacuated, the temperature can significantly increase locally 
(typically in the order of a hundred degrees). Such heating can lead to softening, 
particularly in the cases of TRIP steels, whose residual austenite will be stabilized 
by this temperature increase (Callahan et al. 2019). 
7.2.3.2. Numerical simulation of the influence of the impact speed 
In terms of crash performance, the positive strain rate sensitivity of the steel is a 
beneficial effect. Considering strain rate hardening as an intrinsic behavior of steel: 
– the average crushing force of a shock absorber or front/rear rail will increase 
with the impact speed; 
– the ultimate bending force before a bumper collapses will increase with the 
impact speed. 
This is an additional advantage of steel over aluminum: the latter consolidates 
only slightly with the rate of deformation. 
Light weighting or anti-intrusion and energy absorption performance will be able 
to be evaluated using numerical simulation, provided that the dynamic behavior is 
properly introduced into the finite element code. Figure 7.8 shows the strain rate 
contours in an axial compression specimen and the map of these values, in the model 
at a state representative of the final crush (56 km/h). It is important to note that the 
strain rate values given by the numerical simulation are very sensitive to the mesh size.
Figure 7.8. Strain rate mapping in a typical energy absorbing part. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip Crashworthiness by Steels 211 
In this example, most elements encounter strain rates from quasi-static to 500 s–1. 
It is important not to neglect values up to 1000 s–1 in order to maintain accuracy in 
the edges of the specimen, since these edges absorb 60% of the energy on this type 
of component and these areas have the highest local deformations. The size of the 
mesh is therefore an important parameter, since it governs both the local strain rate 
in the elements, but also the local plastic stress on the elements. A finer mesh size 
allows a better approximation of the deformed geometry and therefore leads to 
larger plastic strain values. However, this fine mesh will also lead to increased 
computationally predicted strain rates. Consequently, the choice of the mesh in this 
type of modeling is as crucial as the choice of the behavior law. 
Therefore, it is recommended to fix the size of the shell elements by simulating a 
quasi-static test for a good description of the local strain levels. In a second step, the 
same test can be performed under dynamic conditions in order to validate the 
dynamic behavior law of the material (see previous section) and to take into account 
viscoplasticity effects. We generally recommend using a mesh size of 3 mm for the 
shell finite elements, which proves to be the right compromise between computation 
time and prediction.

law. For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 212 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 7.9 illustrates the need to use a constitutive law that takes into account 
strain rate sensitivity to obtain an accurate simulation result in comparison to 
experiment. A mild steel and a TRIP800 steel were tested in compression at 
56 km/h. Then, finite element simulations using a static behavior law (only 
quasi-static stress-strain curves) and a dynamic law (stress–strain curves from 
0.008 s–1 to 1000 s–1) are compared with the experimental results. The results 
confirm the influence of the dynamic law on the average stress, but also the higher 
sensitivity to the strain rate of mild steel compared to TRIP800 (+23% in average 
stress for mild steel; +15% for TRIP800). 
This difference is explained not only by the dynamic behavior law and the 
intrinsic positive sensitivity of steels to the strain rate, but also by an inertial effect. 
This effect results from the amount of energy required to give motion to the same 
mass from a slow speed to a high speed and is directly related to the density of the 
material. 
7.2.3.3. Characterization and modeling of the rupture during a crash 
To take into account the strain at failure during a complex crash loading, it is 
necessary to characterize the loaded material under different elementary strain paths 
(Zouari et al. 2006; Dietsch et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). Figure 7.10 shows the 
equivalent ultimate strain at failure of a steel as a function of triaxiality η and Lode 
angle θ of the stress state. When modeling by finite elements with shell elements 
(plane stresses), this result is simplified by considering only the effect of triaxiality. 
Figure 7.10. Representation of the strain at failure as a function of the triaxiality. 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Figure 7.11 shows some experimental tests and the corresponding specimens 
generally used to access this deformation at failure according to the strain path. The 
combination of the geometry of the specimen and the nature of the load allows the 
steel to be deformed according to the desired strain path: Crashworthiness by Steels 213 
– for uniaxial tension, the tests consist of bending the edge of an L-shaped 
specimen (double-bending) or in pulling on a tension specimen with a hole 
machined in its center in order to maximize the deformation on the edges of the 
specimen and to get rid of the “cutting edge” effect; 
– for plane tension, the tests consist of bending very locally a rectangular 
specimen until it breaks or in tensile stressing a notched specimen in order to 
concentrate the deformation in its center; 
– for equibiaxial expansion, it is preferable to press the square blank using a 
hemispherical punch (Nakajima or Erichsen test); 
– for shear, a tensile test on a specifically machined specimen allows local 
deformation in shear. 
Figure 7.11. Test specimens and tests to determine 
the strain at failure for different strain paths 
The tests described above are conducted until the specimen breaks. To measure 
the deformation at failure, different techniques can be used: 
– Direct measurement of thickness on broken specimen with a microscope. 
– Measurement of angles on shear specimens. 
– Digital image correlation (DIC): a grid is printed on the specimen and the 
deformation is measured by following the displacements of the points of this grid by 214 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
image correlation. The final strain measurement will be very sensitive to the 
resolution of the camera and the size of the grid. The most recent DIC systems 
require a random speckle pattern to achieve even better resolutions. This technique 
has become the reference. 
– An inverse method: the deformation at failure is obtained by finite element 
simulation of the test, the stopping criterion of the simulation remaining 
experimental (generally a displacement for which the failure appears 
experimentally). 
7.3. Parameters influencing the material during the manufacturing 
process and the behavior in service 
In this part, we will deal with three steps in the manufacturing chain of the 
automotive component that will influence the behavior of the part during the crash 
behavior, namely: 
– forming of the component: deformation leads to a hardening and an increase in 
the final mechanical properties of the part (Cornette and Galtier 2002); 
– assembly: we will limit ourselves here to the case of spot welding, which is 
mainly used in the automotive industry; 
– painting and the associated thermal treatment of the paint. 
It is rather difficult to establish general rules concerning these operations, 
because the behavior will depend on the steels considered. We will therefore 
illustrate these possible effects mainly through concrete examples and results of 
specific studies. 
7.3.1. Forming/cutting 
In order to quantify the effect of forming step on the crash behavior of a steel 
structure, axial compression crash tests were performed on omega-type specimens, 
either deep-drawn to study the influence of work hardening or made by bending. In 
this second case, the material retains the properties of the raw material, as only the 
edges are deformed. For this study, three multiphase grades with the same tensile 
stress level (~800 MPa), but different work hardening curves due to their 
microstructure (DP, CP, TRIP), are used. Figure 7.12 shows the rational tensile 
curves and instantaneous strain hardening rates of these steels under quasi-static 
conditions. Crashworthiness by Steels 215

Figure 7.13 shows the energy absorbed after a 150 mm axial crush on the drawn 
and bent specimens. These results are corrected for thicknesses. Comparing the 
steels in pairs, this figure shows that strain hardening due to stamping increases 
crash performance by 17% for DP780 and 10% for TRIP800. There is no increase in 
performance for the CP800 steel. In this case, the work hardening of the material 
(the lowest of the three) cannot compensate for the thinning due to stamping. The 
forming work hardening must therefore be taken into account to finely estimate the 
crash properties of a component.

geometries, bent or drawn, of three 800 MPa grade steels. For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
7.3.2. Assembly (spot welding) 
During a crash loading, steel failure can be one of the modes of failure of a 
component. However, the deformations of the assembled parts can generate 
important reaction forces in the welded spots and lead to a rupture of these 
connections. This failure will depend on many factors, such as the welding 
conditions, the material couples, the spacing of the spot welds on the part and the 
boundary conditions inducing the loading mode. An incorrect estimation of the Crashworthiness by Steels 217 
failure criterion for spot welds can result in damage and failure of a joint, as shown 
in Figure 7.14. This scenario is dramatic, as the component deformation mode and 
potential energy absorbed can therefore be degraded from those targeted and 
estimated under good joint performance conditions. 
Figure 7.14. Example of joint failure (spot welds) during an axial compression crash 
test. For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
A simple approach is to consider as the first model a force envelope at failure 
based on single tests such as those mentioned in Figure 7.12. This type of model, 
commonly referred to as the “elliptical model”, is based on normal and tangential 
forces at failure. The equation governing the failure of a spot weld is:

ேೠ
ቁ
௔
+ ቀ ்
்ೠ
ቁ
௕
≤ 1 [7.10]
where N and T are the actual normal and tangential forces at the spot weld, 
respectively, Nu and Tu are the forces at failure in the cross-tension and tension￾shear tests, respectively, and a and b are exponents. Figure 7.15 shows how single 
spot weld can be characterized with different loading angles (between 0°: shear, and 
90°: tension) and it shows the corresponding so-called KS2 specimens.218 New Advanced High Strength Steels

different orientations. For a color version of this figure,

7.3.3. Paint curing treatment 
The automotive structure, in its manufacturing phase after forming and assembly, 
will undergo a painting stage where different surface deposition treatments will be 
applied, but what interests us here is the final baking stage, which corresponds, at the Crashworthiness by Steels 219 
material scale, to a low temperature heat treatment (170°C for 20 min). This heat 
treatment will have three consequences on the previously deformed material: 
– An increase in its yield strength that will result in increased crushing force 
performance of the component. Figure 7.16 shows the corresponding increase in 
average stress on various ultra-high strength steels. The gain observed on the 
specimens after paint curing, a phenomenon called bake hardening (BH), is 6.1–12.8% 
depending on the different grades tested compared to their un-cured reference. 
– An improvement of the ductility, in particular on martensitic steels obtained by 
hot stamping (tempering mechanism). 
– An improvement in the mechanical strength of the welded points, particularly in 
cross and peel tension on certain third-generation very high strength steels such as 
quenching and partitioning (Q&P) or carbide-free bainite (CFB) steels, containing 
more carbon and silicon. Figure 7.17 shows the increase in spot weld strength for a 
Q&P 980HF steel using the KS2 specimen (described earlier) after the paint cure 
step.

7.4. Adequacy between material properties and crash behavior 
according to the different evaluation criteria 
7.4.1. Anti-intrusion effort 
In this section, we will describe which are the main material properties that will 
influence the ultimate anti-intrusion force (Fmax) of a safety component. We have 
seen in section 7.2.2.2 that the dynamic bending test on a component allows us to 
obtain the peak collapse of the structure. The analysis of results on a large panel of 
steels with UTS ranging from 300 to 1800 MPa and thicknesses ranging from 1 to 
3 mm has allowed us to establish simple regression formulas to show the 
characteristics of the material that govern this maximum stress necessary for the 
design. The simplest of them shows a correlation of the ultimate force (Fmax) with 
only two parameters, which are the yield strength (YS) and the thickness (Th) of the 
component steel: 
F୫ୟ୶ = Kୱ୦ୟ୮ୣ√YS. Thଵ.଻ [7.11] Crashworthiness by Steels 221 
Figure 7.18. (a) Evolution of ultimate collapse force as a function of grade; 
(b) lightweighting potential of each grade compared to the reference mild steel. 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 222 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The form factor Kshape is calibrated on experimental data and depends on the 
component geometry. To a first approximation, when the geometry of the 
component is fixed, the thickness and yield strength of the material are the two main 
parameters that will govern the ultimate collapse force. Other parameters discussed 
in the previous sections such as material strain rate sensitivity, material flow stress, 
or thickness after the component forming step will refine the prediction but will 
however be of second order to establish the performance. Figure 7.18(a) shows the 
evolution of the ultimate collapse force in dynamic bending at 28 km/h for several 
grades, while Figure 7.18(b) shows the thickness reduction potential of each of these 
grades compared to the reference mild steel. This potential is calculated by 
identifying the thickness of the high-strength grade to achieve the same ultimate 
dynamic bending stress as the reference steel.
7.4.2. Average crushing force – energy absorption 
By analogy with the previous section, axial compression tests on spot-welded 
components were performed on a wide range of grades from 300 to 1200 MPa 
strength and thicknesses from 1 to 3 mm. The range of grades tested for mechanical 
strength is narrower than for the bending test, as we restrict ourselves here to results 
for which no failure, both in the material and the weld points, was observed when 
the structure was completely crushed. The analysis of the results allowed us to 
establish simple regression formulas to show the characteristics of the material that 
govern this maximum effort necessary for the design. The simplest of them shows a 
correlation of the average crushing force (Favg) with only two parameters that are the 
UTS and the thickness (Th) of the component steel: 
Fୟ୴୥ = Kୱ୦ୟ୮ୣ√UTS. Thଶ [7.12] 
Similarly, the form factor Kshape is calibrated on experimental data and depends 
on the geometry of the component. Again, the strain rate sensitivity of the material, 
material flow stress or new thickness after the component forming step will help 
refine the prediction but will however be of second order for the energy absorption 
performance. The only influential parameter that is not considered here is the failure 
strain of the material, as we have purposely limited the performance evaluation for 
grades that did not show failure in the crash test. Failure strain will be discussed in 
more detail in section 7.4.3. In this section, we will establish the prerequisites for a 
material dedicated to applications to absorb impact energy by plastic deformation. Crashworthiness by Steels 223

lightweighting potential of each grade compared to the reference mild steel. For 
a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Figure 7.19a shows the evolution of the average crushing force in dynamic axial 
compression at 56 km/h for the different grades, and Figure 7.19b shows the 
thickness reduction potential of each of the grades compared to the reference mild 
steel. 224 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
7.4.3. Ductility/failure of the material in crash 
In this section, we will define the strain-to-failure requirements of a steel for the 
two major types of applications that are anti-intrusion and energy absorption. 
In section 7.2.3.2, we described a number of tests that allow us to evaluate the 
strain at failure during a crash loading. When observing a yield curve as a function 
of strain path, it can be seen that the lowest strain values are obtained for the strain 
path corresponding to plane tension. This is the most severe mode of loading. To 
illustrate the critical strain levels, we will use the characteristics from the VDA238-
100 standardized V-bend test (Figure 7.20) used by automotive manufacturers to 
classify the crash ductility of very high strength steels. This bending test was 
developed by analogy to the deformation mode observed during a bend formed on a 
buckling lobe of the crashing structure. The localization of the deformation is 
obtained by using a very small distance between supports, corresponding to twice 
the thickness of the material plus a clearance of 0.5 mm. Although, during the 
formation of the fold, the deformation is not homogeneous through the thickness, the 
mode of deformation on the extrados of the fold is indeed in plane tension. The 
detection of the failure is done from a drop in force observed on the corresponding 
force–displacement curve. The criterion generally used is a decrease in about 60 N, 
which can be adjusted according to the thickness and the resistance of the tested 
product.
In order to access the strain at failure for the steel under test, a fine volume finite 
element modeling of this test must be conducted, as shown in an example in Figure 
7.21. The strain at failure retained is the equivalent plastic strain obtained on the 
outer fiber elements of the ply for a displacement corresponding to the maximum 
stress observed experimentally. 
Figure 7.22 shows the failure strain obtained with this VDA238 test for a panel 
of steels with strengths ranging from 600 to 1800 MPa, used for the construction of 
automotive safety parts. The graph shows a tendency for the tensile strain to 
decrease with increasing strength of the steel, but we can see that at the same 
strength level, the steels can show a large variability in tensile strain depending on 
the microstructure (dual phase, complex phase, TRIP, third-generation Q&P, 
martensitic). Crashworthiness by Steels 225

Figure 7.22. Plane tensile strain at failure for different steels 
with mechanical strength between 600 and 1800 MPa 
Within the framework of applications dedicated to energy absorption and in 
order to apprehend the acceptable level of deformation at rupture in plane tensile for 
steels whose mechanical strength is higher than 1000 MPa, the crash behavior in 
axial compression of an omega spot welded structure was simulated by finite 
elements. 
The model incorporates a material failure criterion whose value in plane tension 
is adjusted. When the local deformation during the simulation of the test exceeds the 
deformation at failure of the material in plane tension, the corresponding elements 
are eliminated from the calculation. As an example, in Figure 7.23, two levels of 
strain at failure in plane tension were considered: for a value of 0.45, 46 elements 
were eliminated, while if the level is set at 0.65, no failure is observed. 
Figure 7.24 summarizes the risk of failure in the component during crash as a 
function of the level of strain to failure in plane strain initially considered for the 
material (with two possible thicknesses, namely 1 mm and 1.5 mm). Below a strain 
to failure of 0.5, many elements are removed, indicating a high risk of failure during 
the crash, while above, the material/component pair is adapted. The possible failure 
initiations are confined to the closed fold of the buckling lobe, and therefore, they Crashworthiness by Steels 227 
will not propagate throughout the structure and affect the amount of energy absorbed 
by the component. The threshold value established in Figure 7.25 is very general. It 
is clearly established that, for parts dedicated to energy absorption, the minimum 
level required in plane tensile strain to failure is greater than 0.5. 
Figure 7.23. Simulation of the crash of a component for energy absorption with 
deformation at failure: (a) 0.45 and (b) 0.65. In (a), 46 elements have been removed, 
unlike (b). For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Figure 7.25 illustrates the possibilities for crash applications (energy absorption 
and anti-antrustion), as a function of the failure strain in plane tension and for 
different steels of mechanical strength between 600 and 1800 MPa. It clearly shows 
that, for an energy absorption application, the choice of a grade cannot be made 
solely on the ultimate stress level of the grade (UTS), and that the strain to failure 
level remains the main criterion. Strain at break depends on two main factors in 
ultra-high strength steels, above 1000 MPa:
– the mechanical behavior (work hardening); 
– the damage behavior (tempering, precipitation, C content in martensite and 
austenite stability in Q&P). 228 New Advanced High Strength Steels

7.4.4. Ductility/failure of crash assemblies: special case of the 
thermally affected zone 
In section 7.3.2, we described the tests that allow us to characterize a spot weld 
under different stresses in order to feed the associated models to simulate the crash 
behavior of a structure. However, these tests do not take into account a particular 
structural behavior related to a localized deformation in the heat-affected zone 
(HAZ) of a very high-strength steel. Figure 7.26a shows a dynamic structural test to 
induce this failure in the HAZ of a spot weld. The prerequisite for failure to initiate 
around the spot weld during the test is that the spot weld has a sufficiently 
significant drop in hardness in the HAZ. This hardness drop can be observed in 
particular on ultra-high strength martensitic steels. In Figure 7.26b, the red profile 
shows a very sharp decrease in hardness (~100 Hv) in the HAZ compared to that of 
the base material (BM) and that of the molten zone (MZ).
Figure 7.26. (a) Structural test causing failure in the HAZ of a weld spot; (b) 
hardness profile (in red) on micrographic section of weld spot between two 
martensitic steels of grade 1500 MPa (thickness: 1.5 mm). MZ = molten zone, BM = 
base material, HAZ = heat affected zone. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 230 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The behavior of the HAZ can be modeled by failure criteria similar to those 
presented for the BM. These criteria will allow automotive designers to ideally 
position the weld points so that they do not end up on force transmission paths, 
which favor this local deformation around the weld point during a crash load. 
Technological solutions also exist, especially for martensitic steels produced by hot 
stamping. The edge area of the part used for joining is not hardened by using locally 
heated drawing tools. As a result, the BM of the joining edge is no longer 
martensitic and has a much lower hardness, with no hardness sink in the HAZ. 
7.5. Conclusion 
Safety and environmental requirements are the main drivers for the development 
of new automotive steels. Despite the sometimes significant changes in the 
viscoplastic behavior of the new metallurgies, the existing characterization and 
modeling tools remain fairly well adapted. On the other hand, the implementation of 
steels increasingly resistant has the collateral effect of introducing or giving more 
importance to issues related to the failure of parts or assemblies during a crash. 
These aspects are therefore the subject of more and more research in order to take 
into account this risk as early as possible in the design of the body in white, but also 
in the design of the steels themselves. The characterization and modeling methods 
have therefore evolved and become more complex in order to meet this increasingly 
important need. 
Additionally, as products become more technical, the effects of interactions 
between crash behavior and the vehicle manufacturing process are reinforced. It 
becomes important to integrate as soon as possible the effects inherited from the 
manufacturing process on the in-service behavior. This is one of the main 
challenges, especially in the industry, which is trying to limit its development costs.

8.1. Introduction/problem analysis 
In the automotive industry, sheet metal forming by stamping is the first step in 
the manufacturing of a vehicle. The coils are uncoiled and cut by tools into shaped 
blanks that are then pressed. On some advanced high strength steel grades, cases of 
cracks starting on the edges of the parts can sometimes be detected during the 
stamping process (Figure 8.1) or during the use phase of the product (e.g. during a 
crash). It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms involved in the 
cutting processes of steel sheets and how these processes affect the quality and 
durability of the cut edges. 
First, we will present the main cutting operations, in particular the punching 
process, which is widely used because of its speed, simplicity and low cost. We will 
describe the consequences of punching on work hardening and damage of the metal 
near the cut edge. 
In a second step, we will study the behavior of the cut edge during a post-cutting 
straining by explaining the links between the cutting process, the microstructure and 
the behavior of the cut edge of the different steel families. 234 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 8.1. Case of a crack appeared during the stamping process 
at the edge of a DP780 sheet metal blank (Dalloz 2007) 
8.2. Cutting processes and characteristics of the cut edge 
8.2.1. The different cutting processes 
There are various industrial processes for cutting sheet metal, including 
machining, water jet cutting, laser cutting, shearing and punching: 
– Machining and water jet cutting produce cuts of very good quality, without 
deformation and with little thermal impact. However, these processes are relatively 
expensive due to their slow speeds. 
– Laser cutting also produces very precise cuts at a relatively high speed, but 
creates a heat-affected zone that can be brittle in some steel grades (see section 
8.3.4). 
– The most commonly used processes for cutting sheets are shearing and 
punching. They are easy to implement and inexpensive. The shearing process cuts 
the sheet metal in a straight line by the action of a moving blade perpendicular to the 
plane of the sheet. The punching process shears through the metal with a punch and 
die. It produces edge profiles similar to those created by the shearing process.
8.2.2. Description of the punched or sheared edge 
Figure 8.2(a) describes the punching process schematically. Based on the 
recording of punching force curves, the process can be broken down as follows: 
– an elastic deformation phase [OA]; 
– a plastic deformation phase with strain hardening [AB]; Cut Edge Behavior 235 
– a plastic deformation phase with reduction of section [BC]; 
– a phase consisting of the initiation of the crack in C and its propagation until 
the final failure in D. 
The punching or shearing profile is then characterized by the existence of four 
zones (Figure 8.2b): 
– the rollover area, formed by the bending of the sheet during the [AB] phase; 
– the sheared zone, with a shiny aspect, and formed by the contact of the punch 
during the phases [AB] and [BC]; 
– the fractured zone, with a ductile fracture surface, and the burr, formed during 
the propagation of the crack [CD]. 
The geometry of the cut edge has long been the main criterion for the quality of 
the cut, the most sought-after characteristics being: 
– minimal burr size, to facilitate assembly or simply the stacking of cut blanks; 
– a maximum sheared area, to ensure straightness of the sides in the case, for 
example, of a punched hole. 
The mechanisms induced during sheet metal cutting have been the subject of 
numerous experimental studies and numerical analyses (Maillard 1991; Pyttel et al.

process (from Johnson and Slater 1967); (b) schematic description of the 
punching process and the cross-section of the sheet showing the edge profile 
Beyond the cutting profile, it can be seen that punching affects the steel in a zone 
that extends for about 500 μm near the edge. This zone is characterized by 
significant strain hardening and microstructural deformation and locally leads to: 236 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
– damage near the surface of the edge (Figure 8.3); 
– hardening in the area affected by the cut (Figure 8.4). 
These evolutions depend on the cutting process on the one hand (in particular the 
cutting clearance) and the behavior and the microstructure of the material on the 
other. The influences of these parameters are described in the following sections.

8.2.3. Parameters influencing the quality of cutting by shearing or 
punching 
8.2.3.1. Process parameters 
The cutting clearance characterizes the spacing between the die and the punch 
and is defined by the following equation: 
Clearance =
𝐷ୢ୧ୣ − 𝐷୮୳୬ୡ୦
2𝑡 × 100
where Ddie and Dpunch are, respectively, the diameters of the die and the punch and t is 
the initial thickness of the sheet. 
Many studies have shown that the clearance has a major influence on the profile 
of the edge (Figure 8.5) and thus on its mechanical behavior: at low clearance, the 
fraction of sheared zone is maximal, while the rollover zone increases with the 
clearance due to the extended plasticity. There is an optimum clearance, often 
between 10 and 15%, which improves the quality of the edges and their resistance to 
further straining (Figure 8.6). 
Figure 8.5. Influence of the distance between punch and 
matrix on the quality of the cut (according to Dieter 1961) 
The effect of cutting temperature has been the subject of only a few works 
(Johnson and Slater 1967; So et al. 2012; Mori et al. 2013). It was concluded that the 
punch load decreased for increased temperature due to the decrease in flow stress. 
During “high speed” cutting, high punching speeds lead to an increase in 
temperature in the cut area and on the tool surface. This can result in stress 
relaxation in the shear zone and improved part edge quality (smaller burr, larger 
sheared area). Punching tests performed at varying speeds, between 0.2 mm/s and 
300 mm/s, however, did not show a marked improvement in edge performance for 
most of the characterized steels (CP800, HSLA460, DP780, medium Mn duplex), 238 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
with the exception of TWIP steel, whose hole expansion increases from 40% at 
0.2 mm/s to 60% at 300 mm/s (Goncalves 2018).

for a punch edge radius of 0.13 mm (Mori et al. 2013); (b) evolution 
of hole expansion rate with cutting clearance of a TRIP780Gl steel 
8.2.3.2. Product parameters: strength and microstructure 
With the cutting process fixed, many studies have emphasized that the edge 
profile is highly dependent on the behavior of the material and in particular its 
ability to resist damage (Maillard 1991; Pyttel et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2004; Bacha 
2006; Dalloz 2007; So et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2012; Kahziz 2015). 
The main mechanisms that occur during the intense punching-induced shear are 
the stretching of the microstructure in the direction of flow, and the initiation and 
growth of ductile cavities, which are clearly visible on the microstructure close to 
the cutting surface (Figure 8.3). In general, damage occurs on microstructural 
elements with a significant hardness contrast to the matrix: 
– In dual-phase (DP) steels, it is observed that the damage and failure of the 
steel is driven by the decohesion of the ferrite-martensite interfaces (Figure 8.3). 
– In TRIP steels containing residual austenite, damage is often observed only 
after destabilization of the austenite into martensite, by decohesion of the interfaces 
between the matrix and the martensite. The lower the mechanical stability of the 
austenite, the deeper the damaged zone (Sugimoto et al. 2000) (Figure 8.7). 
– In ferrite-bainite (FB) steels, cavities are formed preferentially on the cementite 
and inclusions (Figure 8.8). In these grades with high damage resistance, the cutting Cut Edge Behavior 239 
surface can sometimes be strongly affected by a slightly harder band from the 
central segregation formed at continuous casting (Figure 8.9). This band, even if 
thin, seems to be more harmful than in DP steels, as it certainly constitutes one of 
the few microstructural heterogeneities in these grades. 
– Finally, in TWIP steels and third generation ultra-high strength steels 
(1200 MPa and above), the failure seems to be conditioned by the appearance of 
plastic localization bands. The damaged zone is therefore very narrow and the 
cavities very little developed. 
Figure 8.7. In TRIP steels, the lower the mechanical stability of the residual austenite 
(R.A.), the larger the area damaged by cutting (according to Sugimoto et al. 2000)

crack formed in the fractured zone. The SEM cross-section (right) correlates this 
crack with a more intense damage on the central segregation line. The inset shows 
the enlargement of this zone marked by a fine pearlite band about 10 µm thick 
8.3. Behavior of the cut edge 
It is clear from the above that the mechanical behavior of the cut edge is critical 
to the final quality of the formed sheet. After cutting, the edge can turn out to be the 
weak link, reducing to nothing the efforts developed in the optimization of the sheet 
behavior. It is clear that the problem is complex, because it combines both (i) the 
parameters of the cutting process and its consequences on the microstructure of the 
edge and (ii) the microstructural parameters and mechanical properties of the sheet. 
In order to decorrelate the effects as well as possible and to tend toward a 
quantitative understanding of the phenomena, it is crucial to develop dedicated 
mechanical tests, which allow to stress the cut edge in the most controlled way 
possible. We will focus on tensile tests on cut specimens, hole expansion and 
bending tests. Cut Edge Behavior 241 
8.3.1. The different edge characterization tests 
8.3.1.1. Characterization of the sheared edge in uniaxial tension 
Various tests are used to evaluate the formability of sheared edges under uniaxial 
tensile loading: 
– The uniaxial tensile test on a sheared specimen consists of imposing a uniaxial 
tensile test on a rectangular sheared specimen on which a grid of 1 mm2 has been 
printed (Figure 8.10a). This grid is used to determine the local maximum strain 
value. The cutting clearance used is 12%. The limit value is defined as the average 
of the six maximum strains measured closest to failure. 
– The uniaxial tensile test with a hole punched in its center maximizes the 
deformation on the edges of the specimen (Figure 8.10b). 
– The double bending test consists of bending the sheared edge of an L-shaped 
specimen (Figure 8.10c). 
Figure 8.10. Different tests to characterize the sheared edge in uniaxial 
tension: (a) uniaxial tensile teston sheared edges; (b) uniaxial 
tensile teston punched hole; (c) double bending test 
8.3.1.2. Hole expansion test 
The most commonly used mechanical test to characterize the behavior of the cut 
edge during forming is the hole expansion. This test consists of deforming with a 
punch, conical or flat, a sheet of 100 × 100 mm2
 pierced in its center by a hole of 
10 mm in diameter. The test with a conical punch is presented in Figure 8.11a. The 
ISO 16630 standard recommends punching the center hole using a 12% clearance. 242 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
During the test, the sheet is held between the upper and lower dies and the 
advancing punch causes the punched sheet to deform. According to the ISO 
standard, the burr is not in contact with the conical punch (burr at the top of the 
diagram in Figure 8.11a). The test is stopped when the operator sees the first crack 
through the entire thickness (Figure 8.11b). Hole expansion capability is quantified 
by the hole expansion ratio (HER), which is defined as: 
𝐻𝐸𝑅ሺ%ሻ = 𝑑௙௜௡௔௟ − 𝑑௜௡௜௧௜௔௟
𝑑௜௡௜௧௜௔௟
× 100
Figure 8.11. (a) Schematic of hole expansion test with conical punch; 
(b) the test is stopped when the operator observes a crack 
through the entire thickness of the sheet 
Figure 8.12. Many parameters can influence the results of the 
ISO 16630 hole expansion test and are listed schematically 
here (according to Schneider and Eggers 2011) Cut Edge Behavior 243 
The final hole diameter is calculated as the average of two perpendicular 
diameters on the part after testing. The stress state at the edge of the hole is close to 
a uniaxial tensile state. A significant difference between the uniaxial tensile and hole 
expansion tests is the existence of a strain gradient in the radial direction for the hole 
expansion test. This test is complex and its value depends on many parameters. The 
most important are the quality of the hole and the visual detection of the crack by the 
operator (Figure 8.12). For this reason, the standard recommends a minimum of 
three tests to reduce the dispersion of the measurement. In addition, the crack is 
more and more commonly detected by a camera to gain repeatability. 
8.3.1.3. Bending test (90° flanging test) 
The resistance of the cut edge can also be evaluated by bending tests. This 
involves determining the minimum bend radius for which no macroscopic cracks are 
observed (Figure 8.13). 
As with hole expansion, the position of the burr is important, since the resistance 
of the edge is degraded when the burr is placed on the extrados of the bend, in the 
area of highest strain. 
The 90° flanging tests are performed with tools of different radii (from 0 to 
10 mm) by clamping the sheet between the tool and the blank holder. In order to 
compare products of different thicknesses, the results are often expressed in terms of 
the R/t ratio (bending radius/sheet thickness). 
Figure 8.13. (a) Schematic of the 90° flanging test; (b) the test is 
stopped when the operator observes a macroscopic crack 
8.3.2. Parameters influencing the behavior of the cut edge 
Of all the cutting processes, punching and shearing are the most damaging 
processes (Figure 8.14) and can severely degrade edge ductility during hole 
expansion (Hance et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014) or uniaxial tension through the 
abrupt decrease in ductility (Dalloz 2007). 244 New Advanced High Strength Steels

Figure 8.14. Hole expansion and tensile test on central hole specimen to 
demonstrate the influence of cutting process on edge performance: (a) crack 
distribution after hole expansion; (b) HER and fracture strain (Wang et al. 2014) 
After a few elements on laser cutting, we will focus on the behavior of sheared 
and/or punched edges in this section. 
The deterioration of formability due to sheared edge is highly dependent on the 
microstructure (Hance et al. 2013) and test parameters such as sheet thickness, hole 
diameter and burr position (Kahziz 2015; Pathak et al. 2016; Goncalves 2018). Cut Edge Behavior 245 
We will first focus on the latter parameters and then address the microstructural, 
damage and work hardening effects induced by cutting. 
8.3.2.1. Special case of laser cutting 
Among the various cutting processes, laser cutting produces very precise cuts 
without causing damage. Laser-cut edges are therefore generally more durable than 
sheared edges. However, in some cases, especially for steels with high hardenability 
and high equivalent carbon (see Chapter 10), the heating induced by the cutting 
process can lead to the formation of a heat-affected zone of about 50 µm, whose 
martensitic microstructure is hard and brittle. The strength of the cut edge is 
degraded, and the application of a tempering treatment may be necessary. 
8.3.2.2. Effect of sheet thickness, hole diameter, burr position 
Sheet thickness also plays a role in edge behavior. According to Nakamura et al. 
(2000), while the hole expansion of a machined edge increases continuously with 
thickness, it has an optimum around 2 mm for a punched edge (Figure 8.15a). This 
evolution is quite similar to the evolution of toughness with thickness and the link 
will be detailed in section 8.3.3.1. 
Kahziz further notes that DP steels show greater sensitivity to the cutting process 
as the sheet thickness increases (Kahziz 2015). 
Hole expansion also depends on the hole diameter. For example, Iizuka et al. 
have shown, on a number of steels, a decrease in hole expansion with increasing 
hole diameter (Iizuka et al. 2017). Such behavior is explained by the increase in 
fracture strain with the strain gradient in the radial direction (Figure 8.15b). These 
results suggest that the formability of the cut edge should be determined not only 
from the maximum principal strain, but also from the strain gradient in the radial 
direction. 
Positioning the burr down (toward the conical punch) improves the hole 
expansion capability (Pathak et al. 2016; Nguyen and Tong 2020). This is due to the 
presence of a deformation gradient through the thickness of the sheet when 
expanding the hole; deformation is maximum at the outer edge (i.e. the top edge), 
while the surface near the punch is compressed. When the burr is up, this highly 
deformed area is also the one that contains the most defects created during the 
cutting process, which accelerates the propagation of the crack. When, on the 
contrary, the burr is down, the evolution of the material damage in the fracture zone 
and the burr in compression is strongly attenuated. In the case of a flat punch, where 
there is no contact of the punch with the cut edge, the tensile stress remains uniform 246 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
throughout the thickness of the sheet. Therefore, there is no effect of burr position 
for this type of test (Pathak et al. 2016). 
Figure 8.15. (a) Evolution of hole expansion with sheet thickness (Nakamura et al. 
2000); (b) effect of strain gradient on maximum strain (Iizuka et al. 2017) Cut Edge Behavior 247 
8.3.2.3. Effect of the microstructure: evolution of the damage during hole 
expansion 
The degree of pre-existing damage and deformation in the area affected by the 
cutting operation and their evolution during stamping are intrinsically linked to the 
microstructure. To better understand how the different microstructural elements may 
behave during stamping operations, the damage mechanisms of three families of 
steels are discussed here. 
Figure 8.16. Effect of tempering temperature (230°C, 360°C and 460°C) on hole 
expansion and strength of DP steels containing high martensite contents obtained 
using different intercritical holding temperatures (760°C, 790°C, 810°C and 840°C) 
(Pushkareva et al. 2015) 
DP steels generally have the lowest hole expansions, often below 50%. In 
addition, they show very high levels of strain hardening in uniaxial tension, which is 
obtained thanks to the composite effect between martensite and ferrite. In these 
steels, damage is mainly initiated at the ferrite/martensite interfaces, at the interfaces 
between the inclusions present in the material and by cleavage fracture of the largest 
martensite islands. The coalescence of these microcavities follows the alignment of 
the martensite islands, thus following the rolling direction. This coalescence is more 
pronounced in the central segregation. The increase in the surface fraction of the 
ferrite/martensite interfaces, which is maximal when the martensite fraction reaches 248 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
50%, and the significant contrast in hardness between ferrite and martensite degrade 
the toughness of these steels. Pushkareva et al. (2015) show that the hole expansion 
ratio of DP steels is significantly improved by the application of tempering at 
different temperatures (Figure 8.16), which is accompanied by the decrease in the 
hardness gradient between ferrite and martensite. Nevertheless, this improvement in 
cut-edge ductility by tempering inevitably leads to a loss of mechanical strength. 
The choice of tempering temperature is therefore crucial to obtain the best 
HER/UTS compromise (Figure 8.16). 
Several elements alter the sheared edge performance of DP steels: 
– The roughness of the fractured surface of the sheared edge generates stress 
concentrations that accelerate the growth of the damage. The coalescence of these 
cavities with the growing crack initiated on the geometric defect of the edge leads to 
the propagation of the crack through the entire thickness of the sheet (Figure 8.17). 
Note that the fracture of the sheared edge occurs without reaching the necking in the 
material, contrary to the fracture of a machined edge. 
– Cutting-induced deformation and strain hardening reduce the resistance to 
cavity growth. These are found to be the primary factor controlling edge ductility 
(Levy et al. 2013). 
In TRIP steels, high tensile ductility does not necessarily mean good edge 
ductility. The latter is rather related to the stability of the residual austenite and the 
microstructure of the matrix. Indeed, a low austenite stability leads to the formation 
of hard martensite in the zone affected by the cutting and leads to deformation 
incompatibilities during loading. When, on the other hand, the matrix is composed 
of ferrite and bainite (case of first-generation TRIP steels), the edge behavior is 
relatively similar to that of DP steels. 
When the matrix is composed of tempered martensite (the case of third￾generation quenching and partitioning [Q&P] steels) and the austenite is very stable, 
edge ductility can be improved and interesting trade-offs of strength, tensile ductility 
and hole expansion can be obtained. For example, Zhiping et al. (2019) highlighted 
that the austenite present in Q&P steels, stabilized by its high carbon content, small 
grain size as well as its environment consisting of tempered martensite, allowed for 
stable damage propagation, even under high stress triaxiality conditions. This is 
because the very stable austenite at the crack tip must continuously reach high levels 
of plasticity before it transforms into martensite, which leads to crack progression 
(Figure 8.18). Cut Edge Behavior 249 
Figure 8.17. Evolution of maximum microcavity volume fraction (VVF) for different 
crack openings (CMOD) in (a) punched edge; (b) machined edge during a 
laminography test on DP600 steel. Damage distribution at the end of the test for (c) a 
punched edge and (d) a machined edge (Kahziz 2015) 
Very high strength FB steels generally have very good cut edge properties. Their 
hole expansion can vary from 60% to 120% depending on the microstructure and 
strength. These steels have rather low strain hardening rates, compensated by high 
post-uniform elongations in uniaxial tension. The damage of these steels is mainly 
initiated on the inclusions and the iron carbides of the bainite. The largest and most 
elongated inclusions are often the most damaging and can significantly reduce edge 
ductility. Coalescence between cavities on inclusions is late and facilitated by 
damage on the fine carbides. 
Thus, Kahziz (2015) showed using in situ tomography tensile tests that FB600 
steels were particularly resistant to crack propagation, explaining their very good 250 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
sheared edge performance. Indeed, ductility is not limited by the presence of pre￾existing damage near the edge and the evolution of damage in the early stages of 
loading is homogeneous throughout the material (Figure 8.19a). This damage 
dictates the position of the final crack, which occurs by coalescence of cavities near 
the edge, while it appears away from the machined edge in the zone of highest 
triaxiality (Figures 8.19c and d). Note that, in both cases, we observe a necking of 
the sheet before fracture.

steel containing different initial martensite fractions. Fracture facies: (c) brittle,

to the high stability of the filmy austenite (Zhiping et al. 2018). For a color version of 
this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Kahziz (2015) also looked at the isolated effect of initial strain hardening on 
edge ductility. For all levels of rolling-induced pre-strain, no deterioration was 
measured on the hole expansion. This suggests that it is the presence of cutting￾induced damage that plays the greatest role in the decrease in hole expansion, or a 
combination of both. Cut Edge Behavior 251

test for (c) a punched edge and (d) a machined edge of a FB600 steel 
Let us also recall the sensitivity of FB steels to the central segregation formed 
during casting. This harder central band, which deteriorates the homogeneity of the 
microstructure, can alter the cutting surface and thus significantly limit the edge 
ductility (see Figure 8.9). 
Necking of the edges prior to fracture can also cause FB steels to become 
susceptible to the planar anisotropy that may be present in the sheets, and commonly 
measured by the Lankford coefficient r (see Chapter 2). These are the directions 
along which the coefficient r is smallest that will first incur the necking (Hance et al. 
2013) and will lead to material fracture. 252 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
8.3.3. In-use behavior: fatigue and crash cases 
In service, the cut edge is generally detrimental to fatigue resistance: its high 
roughness and the possible existence of micro-cracks induce premature edge 
fracture, while fracture starts from the sheet metal surfaces when the edges are 
machined. 
The loss of fatigue strength due to cutting is reflected in practice by a translation 
of the Wöhler curves (see Chapter 4), which is more marked for a load ratio Rs = −1 
than for Rs = 0.1 (Figure 8.20a). We note that the loss is constant as long as the 
cutting clearance remains below a critical clearance. Beyond the critical clearance 
corresponding to the formation of burrs on the edge, the degradation becomes more 
severe and increases as the clearance increases (Figure 8.20b). The threshold loss 
(for a clearance below the critical clearance) increases with the yield strength of the 
metal. 
Figure 8.20. (a) The Wöhler curve of steel is shifted to the lower maximum 
stresses when the fatigue specimens are sheared; (b) the loss of 
fatigue strength depends in particular on the cutting clearance 
Some post-treatments applied to the cut edge help to limit the loss of fatigue 
strength. For example, the stamping of the edge allows to close some cracks in the 
burr and to induce hardening and compressive stresses in the fractured area. These 
are the most widely used and industrialized techniques today to improve the fatigue 
properties of cut edges of wheel disks or other chassis parts, for example. 
During a crash, when the fracture starts at the edges (generally due to cutting), 
we can observe a strong decrease in the absorbed energy if this fracture propagates 
and does not allow anymore to ensure a good stability as well as the plastic 
deformation of the structure during the buckling. The criteria for predicting this loss 
of ductility are identical to those used in the case of static or quasi-static loading 
(e.g. stamping). Cut Edge Behavior 253 
8.3.3.1. Effect of dwell time between punching and expansion on coated 
steels 
The time between the punching operation and the hole expansion test can have a 
significant influence on edge ductility. This effect has been studied for various 
products and coatings (Atzema and Seda 2017). It was found that some zinc-coated 
materials show a deterioration in edge ductility with increasing time, while this 
sensitivity is absent for the same uncoated products (Figure 8.21). 
Figure 8.21. True strains of sheared edges just before fracture for two 
DP800GI steels: fracture strains decrease with increasing dwell time 
between cutting and straining (according to Atzema and Seda 2017) 
The loss of edge ductility is explained by the embrittlement induced by the 
diffusive hydrogen initially contained in the steel (hydrogen is said to be “diffusive” 
when it is able to diffuse in the steel at room temperature). After punching, the 
plastic deformation and the residual tensile stress are high and the edge quality is 
low. The internal hydrogen then diffuses until it is trapped by dislocations and 
cavities in the edge, weakening its strength (see Chapter 9). In the absence of zinc, 
which acts as an impermeable barrier to hydrogen, hydrogen can desorb through the 
surface, thus avoiding embrittlement. 254 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Local electrochemical measurements confirm the presence of high hydrogen 
concentrations in the sheared zone. It is also found that if the hydrogen content is 
below a critical level, the loss of ductility can be neglected.
The critical hydrogen level depends on the strength of the steel, its 
microstructure (solubility and diffusion of hydrogen, hardness contrast between 
phases, etc.) and the coating. 
8.3.4. Cut edge behavior of the main families of steels 
We are now going to look at the cut edge behavior of the main families of steels, 
and more particularly high strength steels for automotive applications. This is an 
exciting subject, because the improvement of the edge behavior and the 
microstructural optimization required for the targeted mechanical properties are 
often antinomic. Indeed, as we have already illustrated earlier, the failure of the cut 
edge is usually due to the propagation of cracks from damage caused by the cutting. 
This suggests that it would be worthwhile to develop microstructures that are 
resistant to damage and crack propagation, in short with good toughness (see 
Chapter 3). On the other hand, automotive steels must be able to withstand the 
localization of deformation during forming or in service during an accident. These 
constraints have led to the development of grades with excellent work hardening 
properties (see Chapter 1). The work hardening of these steels very often comes 
from the mechanical contrast between the different phases of these multiphase 
grades. This is called kinematic strain hardening. The corollary of this mechanical 
contrast is that the interfaces are extremely stressed and are often the site of early 
damage. It is therefore understandable that the optimization of work hardening and 
edge ductility will de facto involve a compromise. 
In the following, we will show how the edge behavior depends on the damage 
resistance. Then, we will try to identify tensile properties that could be used to 
predict the edge behavior. 
8.3.4.1. Link with toughness 
The measurement of the toughness of a thin sheet is a real challenge, because it 
depends on its thickness. Indeed, as explained in Chapter 3, the toughness must in 
principle be determined in a plane strain condition, whereas thin sheets are in plane 
stress condition. In order to overcome this problem, it is possible to measure an 
essential work of fracture thanks to tests on double-notched specimens with varying Cut Edge Behavior 255 
lengths of ligaments. These are called double-edge-notched tensile (DENT) tests 
(Pardoen et al. 2002). Recent studies (Casellas et al. 2017) have shown an excellent 
correlation between essential work to failure and hole expansion in various families 
of multiphase steels (Figure 8.22). These results confirm that the toughness of 
multiphase steels can be used as an intrinsic property to predict edge behavior. 
Figure 8.20 also echoes what was discussed in section 8.3.2.2. Specifically, it 
compares, for the same strength value (1000 MPa), a DP steel, a TRIP steel 
(TBF1000) and a bainitic steel (CP1000). It can be seen that the damage resistance of 
DP is the lowest and comes from the important mechanical contrast between phases. 
This mechanical contrast is not present in the CP1000 steel. TRIP steel also suffers 
from the mechanical phase contrast. Moreover, in these steels, the retained austenite 
transforms very quickly in the presence of strong triaxiality and thus does not 
participate in energy dissipation at the crack tip. The Q&P steel, studied in Casellas et 
al. (2017), shows a better toughness. This can be explained by the lower mechanical 
phase contrast in this type of grade. In addition, Q&P steels often have austenite in the 
form of thin films that are stable in tension but transform at the crack tip. 
Figure 8.22. Correlation between edge resistance measured by hole 
expansion ratio and essential work of fracture (Casellas et al. 2017) 256 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The measurement of the toughness of a thin sheet via the essential work of 
fracture approach is nevertheless complex and very material intensive. It is therefore 
interesting to ask whether one or more of the tensile properties can be used to 
predict the edge behavior. 
8.3.4.2. Trade-off between tensile properties and HER 
Figures 8.23a and b show the relationship between hole expansion, strength and 
uniform elongation for TRIP ferritic matrix and Q&P steels, respectively. It appears 
that strength shows no clear correlation with hole expansion. Thus, Q&P steels with 
a strength of 1300 MPa can have twice the hole expansion of TRIP steels with a 
strength of 1000 MPa. Turning now to the relationship between uniform elongation 
and hole expansion in Figure 8.23(b), a trend seems to emerge: hole expansion 
decreases as uniform elongation increases. This can be explained by the strong 
kinematic component of strain hardening, which allows large uniform elongations to 
be achieved in these grades. 
In the field of sheet metal forming, a distinction is made between global ductility 
and local ductility. The global ductility is directly related to the ability to resist 
localization and thus uniform elongation. This property has a first-order influence on 
the ability to be formed by stamping. The edge properties such as resistance to hole 
expansion are directly related to the local ductility. This local ductility is often 
measured by the reduction of area or fracture strain (sometimes called total 
deformation). It is the ability of the material to resist damage in the necking zone 
that is the source of significant area reduction at fracture. It is therefore interesting to 
consider the post-uniform deformation and the total deformation in order to predict 
the edge performance. This correlation can be clearly seen in Figure 8.24 for 
high strength steels (Larour et al. 2017). In Figure 8.25, the magnitude of 
post-uniform deformation is represented for materials with quite different strength 
levels: a ferritic low-carbon steel, an austenitic stainless steel and a third-generation 
TWIP steel. The low-carbon steel has the lowest uniform elongation, but the highest 
post-uniform elongation. This results in a much better hole expansion ratio. The 
review article by Paul (2020) does confirm the relevance of the correlation 
between post-uniform strain and hole expansion ratio for a very wide range of steels 
(Figure 8.26). Cut Edge Behavior 257

8.3.5. Modeling the cut edge in finite elements stamping codes 
The drawability of a material can be evaluated through its forming limit curve 
(FLC), which defines the deformation capacity of a material according to different 
stress modes. For each of these modes, the limit is marked by the appearance of a 
localized necking or a fracture. Once the FLC of a material has been determined 
experimentally, it is then possible to determine the feasibility of a part by a finite 
element simulation of the stamping process. 
When the blank to be stamped contains sheared edges, it is important to predict 
edge cracking, which tends to “reduce” the FLC of the product. Different 
formability values should then be used depending on the case under study (Figure 
8.27): 
1) if the forming operation involves a cut edge bend, the feasibility of the part 
can be directly evaluated using the 90° flanging test limits; 
2) if the forming operation involves stretching of the cut edge, the limit defined 
by uniaxial tensile tests on sheared specimens is used;
3) if the forming operation involves a hole flanging, the feasibility of the part is 
evaluated from the limits of the hole expansion test.

reduced compared to that of a blank of the same product with machined edges; (b) to 
define the formability of the edges, different tests are required depending on the

8.4. Conclusion 
A famous quote from Wolfgang Pauli says that God created the volume while 
the devil created the surface. Although the edge of a part constitutes only a small 
portion of it, this chapter has demonstrated how controlling and understanding edge 
behavior is a real technological and scientific challenge. Indeed, it is determined 
both by the parameters of the cutting process and by the intrinsic mechanical 
properties of steels. For the grades developed in the automotive field, this challenge 
is particularly critical. Indeed, the parts are very often formed after cutting steps 
inducing a pre-damage of the edges. Moreover, the desired work hardening 
properties in the volume of the material often go hand in hand with a degradation of 
the toughness, making it difficult to optimize a compromise between the in-use 
behavior of the sheet and the behavior of the edge during forming and in service. 
Generally speaking, we can say that the damage always finds its source in a weak 
link of the microstructure: interfaces, inclusions, etc.

The Relationship between 
Mechanical Strength and 
Hydrogen Embrittlement

9.1. Introduction 
This chapter is intended to provide the non-specialist with a concise summary of 
the current state of our knowledge regarding the metallurgical aspects of hydrogen 
embrittlement (HE) and its consequences on delayed fracture (DF) in modern grades 
of advanced high strength steels (AHSS). This topic presents some of the greatest 
experimental and modeling challenges in physical metallurgy. The available 
literature is extensive and, unfortunately, often contradictory. A unified theory of 
HE in steels does not yet exist, but steady progress toward this goal is being made. 
In particular, recent rapid advances in observation and measurement techniques as 
well as in computing power are playing a crucial role in developing our 
understanding of this complex problem. As early as 1873, Johnson reported that 
temporary immersion in hydrochloric or sulfuric acid caused an extraordinary 
decrease in the toughness and mechanical strength of steel (Johnson 1873), a 
phenomenon all the more remarkable because once removed from the acid, the 
metal slowly regained its original properties (reversible embrittlement). It was noted 
that after 10 min in dilute sulfuric acid, a coil of quenched and tempered steel wire 
Courtesy of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), CanmetMATERIALS. 264 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
broke into several pieces while still in the liquid (delayed brittle failure, effect of 
residual stress). After 30 min in HCl, the high-carbon steel (0.6 wt% C) became so 
brittle that no exposure to air or heat could restore it (irreversible embrittlement). 
The decrease in toughness produced by acid immersion was found to be greater and 
faster for quenched and tempered steels than for the same steel in the softer “as￾rolled” condition (influence of the strength level). A year later, O. Reynolds 
concluded that it was the introduction of small amounts of diffusible hydrogen into 
the steel matrix that caused the remarkable degradation of the physical properties of 
the material (Reynolds 1874). 
9.2. How to identify and characterize HE 
HE requires a redistribution of hydrogen within the material over time in order to 
reach a local critical condition that leads to damage. Therefore, it is a delayed failure 
mechanism. The time between fabrication, commissioning and failure is a key 
parameter in the identification of this phenomenon. There are many HE variants, 
each of which is derived from experimental observation (Bosch et al. 2016). Without 
being exhaustive, we speak of hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) when internal 
decohesion occurs in the absence of external stress, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) 
when hydrogen is involved in a stress corrosion process, DF when stress fracture 
occurs rapidly without the presence of corrosion, sulfide stress cracking (SSC) when 
an environment containing H2S favors hydrogen penetration and stress-oriented 
hydrogen induced cracking (SOHIC) when, following an internal decohesion, the 
cracking propagates in a direction imposed by the thermomechanical history of the 
alloy. 
9.2.1. Fractographic analysis 
The fracture surfaces of hydrogen embrittled steels can vary considerably 
depending on the initial microstructure and the fracture mechanism involved. In 
extreme cases, the fracture is completely intergranular (Figure 9.1a) with marked 
decohesion at grain boundaries. Exposed grain boundary surfaces may or may not 
show details such as micropores or ductile striations. In centered cubic and 
tetragonal alloys where the prior austenite grain boundaries are preserved 
(martensitic and/or bainitic structures), the fracture surface follows these boundaries. 
This is the case for the martensitic PHS steel electrolytically charged with hydrogen 
(Figure 9.1a). In Figure 9.1b, the same alloy was modified by the addition of a small 
amount of Nb to reduce the austenitic grain size (from 8.4 to 6.7 µm) and, under 
identical loading conditions, the fracture surface changed to show transgranular 
quasi-cleavage (QC) type cracking. This was associated with a change in the The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 265 
embrittlement mechanism from hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) to 
hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) (see sections 9.3.3 and 9.6). HE 
cracks usually start at free surfaces (often associated with corrosion events), but not 
always. In the austenitic steel shown in Figure 9.1(c), the oxide inclusion marked by 
an arrow is the initiation site of a localized zone of QC. That is to say failure on 
non-cleavage planes (e.g. for ferrite this would be planes other than {111}) with fine 
lines or steps often parallel to the direction of crack advance. Some ductile tearing 
(D) has occurred outside of this area. Failed parts often show zones of brittle failure 
around the initiation sites, connected by regions of ductile failure (ligaments) formed 
when the remaining material can no longer withstand external stresses. An excellent 
example of this can be seen in Figure 9.8. 
Figure 9.1. (a) Intergranular fracture in hydrogen-charged martensite; (b) quasi￾cleavage fracture in the same steel with the addition of Nb; (c) initiation site around a 
“fish-eye” oxide inclusion in an austenitic steel. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
9.2.2. Chemical and microstructural analysis 
In any suspected HE case, one of the first parameters to determine is the total 
amount of hydrogen in the part. This is done by inert gas fusion (IGF) analysis: 
a small sample (5–10 g) is rapidly heated in a graphite crucible under a stream of 
inert carrier gas, and the amount of hydrogen released is measured in a thermal 
conductivity cell or mass spectrometer. In commercial systems, the measurements 
take a few minutes and can be performed “online” for industrial process control. As 
will be described in detail in section 9.3.2, the hydrogen content consists of two 
parts: mobile or diffusible hydrogen and trapped hydrogen. It is the amount of 
mobile hydrogen that determines the probability of HE in steels. Trapped hydrogen 
can be found in irreversible or reversible traps. Care must be taken, as under certain 
conditions (temperature, applied stress) the latter can also contribute to HE. Thermal 
desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS) has become the standard technique for 
determining the relative amounts of mobile and trapped hydrogen in steels with 
predominantly cubic or tetragonal centered microstructures. TDS analyzers use a 266 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
controlled heating ramp (typically 100°C/h for steels). Hydrogen released from the 
sample surface at different temperatures is transported by a carrier gas to a 
quadrupole mass spectrometer where detection levels in the ppb (weight) range are 
achievable. The resulting spectrum of hydrogen desorption rate versus temperature 
reveals overlapping peaks centered at different temperatures. The higher the 
temperature, the stronger the trapping site associated with the peak in question (see 
section 9.3.2 for a discussion of trapping energy). Integrating the area under each 
peak provides the amount of hydrogen associated with each type of trap. For 
high-strength steels, it is often considered that all hydrogen released below 270°C is 
mobile, and thus critical to the HE. Overlapping peaks can be deconvoluted and 
analyzed to determine the type of trapping site (grain boundaries, dislocation 
neighborhood and core, precipitates, etc.) (Pressouyre 1979; Hurley et al. 2015; 
Martin et al. 2019). 
TDS is more complex to implement for samples with an austenitic matrix 
(face-centered cubic [fcc]), because the hydrogen diffusion rate is so low (see 
section 9.3.2). Similarly, thick samples are difficult to analyze due to exacerbated 
peak overlap associated with a hydrogen distribution gradient. Zinc-coated samples 
may require removal of the zinc prior to testing for two reasons: there may be a 
significant amount of hydrogen (often in the form of hydroxides) present in the 
coating itself or trapped at the Zn/steel interface, and evaporation of Zn during 
testing may damage the instrument, although newer TDS systems can be equipped 
with filters to handle Zn vapor. 
Direct observation of atomic hydrogen in steels is not yet possible within a 
transmission electron microscope (TEM), but it is technically feasible in atom probe 
tomography (APT) and in secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). SIMS can 
provide 1D depth profiles with a detection level below the mass ppm, whereas APT 
is capable of full 3D atomic resolution. In practice, the high levels of background 
hydrogen present in APT and SIMS vacuum systems will completely dominate the 
smaller signals from the sample. This problem is usually resolved by replacing 
hydrogen with the 2
H (deuterium) isotope. Deuterium is in this case assumed to 
behave in the same way as atomic hydrogen. For APT samples, deuterium loading 
must be performed after the APT tip is fabricated, and the sample must be 
cryogenically transferred to the analyzer to avoid deuterium outgassing (Takahashi 
et al. 2018). Despite these considerable difficulties, 3D APT images of deuterium 
trapped in steels have been made (see Figure 9.6). Several other indirect methods of 
hydrogen detection are available. A non-exhaustive list includes small-angle neutron 
scattering (SANS), scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) and 
hydrogen micro-imaging (Barrera et al. 2018; Oudriss et al. 2019). The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 267 
Permeation tests are used to study the transport behavior of hydrogen, that is, to 
determine the parameters of surface adsorption kinetics, effective diffusivity and 
effective solubility of hydrogen in steels (Kittel et al. 2016). Hydrogen is introduced 
to the upstream surface of a thin steel membrane via an electrochemical load cell 
(ASTM G148-97) or by direct contact with high-pressure H2 gas. Hydrogen atoms 
diffuse through the test sample and are collected from the downstream side (the 
latter can be coated with Pd to avoid molecular hydrogen formation) in a detection 
cell to determine the permeation rate. Detection can also be performed by measuring 
the H2 pressure rise in a constant volume chamber or by gas chromatography. 
Measurement of the effective diffusivity coefficient can be used to estimate the 
density of hydrogen trapping sites in steel (Frappart et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2020). 
9.2.3. Laboratory mechanical testing 
The types of mechanical tests applied differ depending on the geometry (plate, 
sheet or rod) of the specimen in question. Rods and plates are tested in tension or 
four-point bending, and the specimens are usually notched. Most authors publish 
their results in terms of a normalized embrittlement index, which is the ratio of 
certain parameters such as elongation at fracture, reduction in area at fracture, 
notched fracture stress (and possibly fatigue limit or K1C toughness), obtained under 
hydrogen-charged conditions to the same value obtained in the uncharged state 
(Brahimi et al. 2017). Others use time to failure under constant loading conditions 
(Namimura et al. 2003). In situ hydrogen loading is typically performed in an 
environmental cell (containing 3.5–5 wt.% NaCl) under a constant cathodic 
potential, although a few laboratories are equipped with high-pressure hydrogen gas 
cells. The most reliable results are obtained when rising step-load (RSL) test 
methods (e.g. ASTM F1624) are used, as this avoids the need to monitor the 
hydrogen content in the sample during testing (Nanninga et al. 2010). The 
disadvantage of this technique is the increased number of samples and longer test 
time required. 
For thin sheets, HE test methods are less well standardized. Some of the greatest 
difficulties encountered involve quantifying the effects of different edge cutting 
methods (punched, sheared, machined, laser-cut or waterjet-cut) and the influence of 
plastic deformation in cold-formed parts, both of which have important 
consequences on the response to HE. Early research on stainless steel used deep￾drawn cups (see section 9.5.1) immersed in water or salt solutions. The VDA/VDEh 
group in Germany has proposed standards for constant load tests on notched or 
punched tensile specimens and spot-welded joints (Bergmann et al. 2018). These 
specimens are electrolytically precharged and then immediately coated with Zn to 268 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
reduce hydrogen effusion prior to testing. Alternatively, they can be charged in situ 
by immersion in a 5% NaCl solution. In these tests, the threshold stress, defined to 
be 25 MPa below the failure initiation stress for fixed test times (typically 72–96 h), 
is plotted against the diffusible hydrogen content (measured by TDS). The effect of 
plastic deformation can also be studied by cutting the tensile samples from sheets 
with different cold rolling reductions. 
9.3. Solubility and (apparent) diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in 
steels 
From current knowledge, it seems that a large part of the susceptibility to HE of 
a metal alloy is dictated by its ability to limit the mobile hydrogen content. Two 
quantities are commonly used to characterize this property: the solubility Sapp and the 
diffusion coefficient Dapp. Experimental diffusion coefficients for hydrogen in steels, 
measured by various techniques, are apparent (or sometimes qualified as effective) 
as they depend strongly on the microstructure of the alloy, its composition and even 
the concentration of defects. The solubility is given at thermodynamic equilibrium 
by Sieverts’ law, which describes the equilibrium at the interface, for a given 
temperature, between a hydrogenating medium (pressure for a gaseous environment, 
cathodic overvoltage for an aqueous environment) and hydrogen in solid solution. It 
is first necessary to define the elementary processes that lead to the sorption or 
desorption of hydrogen by underlining the potentially rate-limiting steps. Next, we 
will describe the important hydrogen transport mechanisms and the processes that 
influence them (segregation, trapping, short-circuit diffusion). Based on these 
elements describing the dynamics of hydrogen mobility, we will critically analyze 
the simplified and/or operational criteria that are commonly associated with HE. 
9.3.1. Hydrogen sources (intrinsic/environmental) 
There are many situations that can lead to the presence of hydrogen in a metal. 
For example, certain manufacturing processes are likely to introduce hydrogen, 
which we will qualify as intrinsic hydrogen (see Figure 9.10). On the other hand, 
extrinsic hydrogen originates from particular in-service conditions, where the 
environment leads to its introduction into the metal. In both cases, the question 
arises as to the source of hydrogen that can lead to the embrittlement of the alloy and 
the different steps that lead to it. Thus, the introduction of hydrogen, whether from 
gaseous or aqueous origins, requires a solid/fluid interaction step whose kinetics 
must be known (Brass et al. 2000; Marcus 2002; Turnbull 2012; Martin et al. 2019). 
The different states and stages of hydrogen introduction can be described by an 
energy profile from the surface to the core of the material, thus providing a measure The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 269 
of how easy or difficult it is to introduce hydrogen (Marcus 2002). Depending on the 
complexity of the system, these energy profiles are now accessible by atomistic 
calculations (Traisnel et al. 2021). They allow us to distinguish three fundamental 
steps, which are the adsorption of hydrogen at the surface, its absorption to the 
subsurface and its transport within the material, governed by diffusion and trapping 
processes. The first step depends on the medium considered and the nature of the 
surface. In the case of a gaseous medium, the hydrogenated molecules interact with 
the surface in order to lead to a dissociation allowing the following absorption step. 
This process is classically described by an elementary step: 
𝐻ଶ(௚) ⇄ 2𝐻௔ௗ௦ [9.1] 
The latter is “catalyzed” by all surface defects (steps, notches, etc.) and by a 
certain number of chemical species that are sometimes called “poisons”. It can also 
be reduced by the presence of a surface oxide when the adsorption step is limited to 
the level of the metal cation. In the latter case, which is common in steels (presence 
of a native oxide layer), the concentration of hydrogen CH(0) on the surface will be a 
function of the coverage rate θads of the potential adsorption sites as well as of the 
kinetic constants describing the reactions at the surface of the oxide, at the 
metal/oxide interface and eventually the transport properties within the oxide. An 
engineering approach to the problem will then be guided by the need to identify the 
rate limiting factors. Finally, it should be noted that, for certain conditions (pressure, 
temperature), hydrogen is able to reduce the oxide film (Spreitzer and Shenk 2019), 
thus rendering it ineffective in protecting against hydrogen penetration. 
In the case of an aqueous medium, when the overvoltage (deviation from the 
corrosion potential) generated at the surface favors a cathodic reaction, the 
adsorption of hydrogen is dictated by three elementary reactions (hydrogen 
evolution reaction [HER]): 
H(ୟ୯) ା + e(ୱ୭୪)
ି → Hୟୢୱ [9.2] 
H(ୟ୯) ା + Hୟୢୱ + e(ୱ୭୪)
ି → Hଶ(୥) [9.3] 
Hୟୢୱ + Hୟୢୱ → Hଶ(୥) [9.4] 
Kinetic equations can be derived for each of these reactions. The associated 
reaction constants must be identified in order to predict the adsorption recovery rate 
(ratio of the number of hydrogen atoms occupying an adsorption site to the number 
of potential adsorption sites associated with a surface) that will subsequently dictate 270 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
the hydrogen penetration rate. Both stationary and non-stationary electrochemical 
techniques are suitable for this identification (Orazem and Tribollet 2017). In the 
same way as for a gaseous medium, the set of characteristic parameters of a surface 
as well as the medium are likely to influence the kinetic constants. In this context, 
we note that the presence of some hydrides (H2S, PH3, AsH3, etc.) can facilitate the 
entry of hydrogen (acting as “promoters” or “poisons” depending on the context). 
Another important element for steels is the fact that the native oxide layer (generally 
an iron oxide formed in air) in cathodic conditions is necessarily reduced during the 
reactions described above, which favors the introduction of hydrogen. 
Finally, whether under gaseous or aqueous loading, one must be aware that the 
adsorption stage inevitably leads to surface reconstruction processes, surface 
diffusion, self-organization, etc., which can eventually profoundly modify the 
hydrogen adsorption kinetics. These changes must also be considered in modeling. 
Following the adsorption step, hydrogen penetration within the metal requires an 
absorption phase that depends on the subsurface atomic organization. The kinetic 
constants associated with this step can be understood by atomistic modeling 
(Traisnel et al. 2021), pulsed techniques (Lekbir 2012) and instrumented permeation 
experiments to follow the reaction kinetics at the entrance and exit surfaces of the 
permeation membrane (Frappart et al. 2010; Kittel et al. 2016). Hydrogen solubility 
corresponds to the hydrogen concentration in the first few atomic layers. This 
therefore partly determines the conditions for hydrogen entry. Setting the chemical 
potentials between hydrogen in the fluid (aqueous or gas) and solid phases to be 
equal leads to the definition of solubility as a function of fugacity 𝑓ுమor 
overpotential η in the form of an equation commonly referred to as Sieverts’ law 
(Bockris and Subramanyan 1971; Atrens et al. 1980; Fukai 2005; Liu et al. 2014;

where ∆𝐺଴ is the free enthalpy of formation of the standard state of the absorbed 
hydrogen, 𝑓଴is the fugacity of the gas in the standard state, 𝑁௅ is the number of 
available interstitial sites, η is the overpotential, R is the perfect gas constant, T is 
the temperature and Z is a constant determined empirically and dependent on the 
kinetic constants governing the hydrogen flow (Fukai 2005). A large amount of 
thermodynamic data on energies is available in Fukai’s (2005) monograph; on the 
other hand, the equivalence between fugacity and overpotential has only been 
determined for only a few materials (Martin et al. 2019) and thus this approach The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 271 
remains to be formalized. Let us finally stress that the equality between fugacity and 
pressure is only valid for pressures below 40 MPa (400 atm), above this value the 
gas no longer shows an ideal behavior and must be described by a different set of 
equations (Lide 1994).
The last step, which leads to the transport of hydrogen within the material, 
imposes the distribution of the solute. This is governed by diffusion and trapping 
equations. There are many publications on this specific topic (McNabb and Foster 
1963; Oriani 1970; Leblond and Dubois 1983; Krom and Bakker 2000; Legrand 
et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017) as well as more generic texts on diffusion (Mehrer 2007; 
Philibert 2012). Here, we propose a classical formalism (Legrand et al. 2015; Li 
et al. 2017), where mobile hydrogen transport is driven by a chemical potential 
gradient, not a concentration gradient, and that trapping is not a priori a steady-state 
process:

𝐶ு and 𝐶்௜ are the concentrations of diffusible hydrogen and trapped hydrogen at 
a site i, 𝐽̅ is the diffusible hydrogen flux, ∇𝜇 represents the chemical potential 
gradient, 𝐷ന is a diffusion tensor, 𝜎ധ defines the stress state, kB is the Boltzmann 
constant, T is temperature, t is time and 𝑟̅is the position vector. Γ௅்௜ and Γ்௜௅
represent the jump rates between an interstitial site (L) and a trapping site (Ti) and 
vice versa, respectively. 𝑃்௜ and 𝑃௅are the probabilities that the sites are free. Each 
of the traps i is defined by an energy and a trapping and detrapping frequency, which 
makes their identification complex. The diffusion tensor reduces to a scalar for cubic 
crystallographic structures, but diffusion can still be anisotropic due to the impact of 
the stress state on the chemical potential. This dependence emphasizes that a stress 
gradient is a driving force for solute mobility. In view of the complexity of the 
previous equations, many authors propose simpler expressions to be implemented in 
calculation codes or for the analysis of experimental results that make use of 
hypotheses that are difficult to justify. It is therefore necessary to be very cautious 
about the origin and precision of certain values and to be familiar with the 
techniques or models that have made it possible to establish these expressions. 272 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
9.3.2. Hydrogen transport in steels 
Steels present a great variety of microstructures, which can lead to a diversity of 
hydrogen behavior in terms of diffusion and solubility. Most of the techniques used 
to measure these quantities lead only to apparent values based on a simplified 
description of the microstructure and on a diffusion/trapping model expressed 
mostly in the steady state. The mobility and solubility of hydrogen are characterized 
in a simple way by an apparent diffusion coefficient Dapp and by an apparent 
concentration Sapp respectively, both depending on the crystallographic nature 
(quadratic centered [qc], cubic centered [bcc] and fcc) of the constituents present 
(martensite, ferrite, bainite, austenite), the presence of solutes, the nature of 
interfaces, interphases and grain boundaries, the precipitation state, the distribution 
of inclusions and the density of vacancies and dislocations. Classically, the data in 
the literature are presented according to Arrhenius laws of the type: 
𝐷௔௣௣ = 𝐷଴𝑒𝑥𝑝 ቂ− ாವ
ோ்ቃ and 𝑆௔௣௣ = 𝑆଴𝑃ଵ/ଶ𝑒𝑥𝑝 ቂ− ாೄ
ோ்ቃ [9.9] 
While these are generally true at high temperatures, the same is not true at lower 
temperatures, where there is a wide disparity in values for the same metal or alloy. 
As an example, the compilation by Kiuchi and McLellan (1983) shows a great 
disparity of results for the apparent diffusion coefficient in α iron below 700 K. This 
highlights the importance of the microstructure at these temperatures, particularly 
the short-circuit of diffusion and trapping processes. In contrast, for higher 
temperatures, the energies deduced from the experiment are close to those expected 
for diffusion and solubility from atomistic calculations (Fukai 2005). For α iron 
(bcc), the solubility energy is in the range of 0.26–0.3 eV and the diffusion 
activation energy in the range of 0.059–0.074 eV. In contrast, for γ iron (fcc) the 
solubility energy is in the range of 0.07–0.12 eV (higher solubility than α iron) and 
the diffusion activation energy in the range of 0.11–0.14 eV (lower mobility than in 
α iron). For diffusion, the pre-exponential terms vary only over an order of 
magnitude, ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 for α iron and from 2 to 9.2 for γ iron (units: 
10–7 m2
·s–1). On the other hand, 𝑆଴ is 3.3 × 10–5 mass ppm for α iron versus 33 mass 
ppm for γ iron. At 300 K under 1 atmosphere, this leads to orders of magnitude for 
the (Sapp, Dapp) pair of (5 × 10–4, 10–8) for α iron and (1.3, 10–14) for γ iron (units: 
mass ppm and m2
·s–1). In other words, low solubility seems to favor high diffusivity. 
In the context of alloys, elements in solid solution can significantly modify Sapp 
and Dapp. For example, substitution elements in α iron can decrease the hydrogen 
diffusion coefficient by an order of magnitude (up to 2 × 10–9 m2
·s–1) for contents of 
6 wt.% (Hagi 1992). Nickel, vanadium and molybdenum have notable effects, 
whereas cobalt and chromium have less influence. Furthermore, Counts et al. (2010) The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 273 
used density functional theory (DFT) to show that carbon decreases the solubility 
energy in a similar manner to a number of other elements (Mg, Ti, Cu, Al). In contrast, 
some elements remain relatively neutral (Ni, Co, Mo, V). In the case of γ iron 
(Duportal 2020), a chromium and/or nickel content ranging from 40 to 60 mass% 
decreases the diffusion coefficient by two orders of magnitude (1.35 × 10–16 m2
·s–1). A 
similar effect is obtained with only 0.08 mass% carbon. On the other hand, the role of 
nitrogen is more complex. At concentrations lower than 0.1 mass%, nitrogen 
increases the diffusion coefficient but for higher contents it decreases it. Finally, 
manganese can increase the diffusion coefficient by one order of magnitude (Ismer 
et al. 2010). 
Data on the influence of solutes on the solubility of hydrogen in the austenitic 
phase are much scarcer. However, we note that the latter increases with increasing 
manganese content (Ismer et al. 2010). Bainitic and martensitic structures generally 
lead to higher apparent solubilities (2–3 mass ppm) and much lower diffusion 
coefficients (10–12 to 10–10 m2
·s–1) than those of ferrite, although the origin of these 
discrepancies (lattice distortion in the presence of solutes and/or defects such as 
vacancies and dislocations) has not been clearly determined (Frappart et al. 2012). 
On the other hand, we note little difference between martensitic and bainitic steels, 
which suggests that it is more the solute content than the nature of the crystal lattice 
that distinguishes the alloys in this case. Finally, it should be noted that in the case 
of two-phase alloys, the data are only average values and are highly dependent on 
the volume fraction of the constituent phases and their degree of percolation. As an 
example, we will cite the work of Wang et al. (2020) and Fielding et al. (2021) in 
a dual-phase (DP) ferrite/martensite steel for which the diffusion coefficient 
decreases, and the solubility increases as a function of the martensite fraction. For 
martensitic steels, the residual austenite fraction is a determining factor on the 
average properties. As such, Bacchi et al. (2020) show that the presence of less than 
15% of retained austenite leads to a decrease of one order of magnitude in the 
apparent diffusion coefficient (of the order of 2 × 10–13 m2
·s–1). Austenite is 
generally positioned at the interface of the martensite laths and its effect on diffusion 
depends on its distribution (Turnbull 2015). In the case of α/γ duplex steels, the 
diffusion coefficient is dependent on that in the individual phases, but also on the 
distribution and degree of percolation of the phases, which can lead to anisotropy of 
properties (Ping Tao et al. 2020). The solubility and the apparent diffusion 
coefficient Dapp are not only dependent on the nature of the matrix phase, but also on 
trapping processes for which we can give orders of magnitude values for the 
trapping energies ETL and the number of potential trapping sites NT that depend on 
the nature of the defects and/or the metallurgical characteristics. These quantities are 
derived from the interpretation of experimental data using a trapping/untrapping 
model (equation [9.8]) which is often expressed by a steady state where the 274 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
detrapping frequency, trapped hydrogen concentration, and apparent diffusion 
coefficient are given by (Oriani 1970; Legrand et al. 2015):

𝜈்௅ and 𝜈௅் are, respectively, the jump frequencies between trapping sites and 
interstitial sites and vice versa. In view of the orders of magnitude proposed in the 
literature, of which a non-exhaustive list of binding enthalpies (Eb = ETL – ES) is 
given in the references (Hirt 1979; Pressouyre 1979; Martin et al. 2019), it seems 
appropriate to distinguish three types of hydrogen: hydrogen in solid solution (Eb = 
0.1–0.2 eV), hydrogen weakly trapped in elastic stress fields (reversible trapping) in 
the vicinity of dislocations, precipitates and grain boundaries (Eb of the order of 
0.3 eV) and hydrogen deeply trapped (irreversible trapping) in vacancies, at 
dislocation cores or even some grain boundary sites (Eb higher than 0.5 eV) 
(Frappart et al. 2011). The first two states are often considered mobile and promote 
DF. The density of trapping sites and their occupancy is a major issue motivating the 
development of models that can approximate these quantities (Hurley et al. 2015; 
Legrand et al. 2015). Amongst the deep traps, we will only consider vacancies and 
clusters of vacancies, whose formation and stabilization by hydrogen trapping have 
an important influence on the change of physical properties such as diffusion, 
elasticity or even interface energies (Feaugas and Delafosse 2019). In steels, the 
MxCy carbides (M = Cr, V, Mo, Ti, Nb) and the intermetallics FexMoy, Ni3(Ti, Mo), 
Ni(Al, Fe) are all potential trap sites for hydrogen. For coherent or semi-coherent 
states (between precipitates and matrix), the deviation from coherence induces an 
elastic stress field that traps hydrogen reversibly (Frappart et al. 2010; Rousseau et 
al. 2020). For semi-coherent or incoherent states, the presence of vacancies at the 
interface as well as within the precipitate itself can be a vector for irreversible 
trapping (Di Stefano et al. 2016; Martin et al. 2019). Finally, like precipitation, 
dislocations are both sites of reversible trapping (tensile regions of elastic stress 
fields) and irreversible trapping (dislocation cores) (Martin et al. 2019). 
The complexity of the structure of grain boundaries and more generally of 
interfaces and interphase boundaries leads to a multiplicity of situations. The most 
recent studies show that, depending on the nature of the grain boundary, it will trap 
hydrogen or promote its diffusion, in which case we speak of short-circuit diffusion The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 275 
paths (Du et al. 2011; Oudriss et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2019; Li et al. 2021). This 
duality leads to thinking about the diffusion path according to the distribution of 
grain boundaries and in particular the degree of percolation of the boundaries 
according to their nature (Osman Hoch et al. 2015). The final element to incorporate 
into a consideration of the interaction of solute and defects is that of the potential for 
hydrogen transport through these defects. In the case of the vacancy/hydrogen 
complex, this diffusion is slowed by several orders of magnitude depending on the 
concentration of hydrogen trapped in the vacancy (Wang et al. 2020). On the other 
hand, hydrogen trapping by mobile dislocations allows, to some extent, solute 
transport during plastic deformation (Shoda et al. 2010). This is a function of the 
respective velocities of dislocations and hydrogen (Martin et al. 2019). We will end this 
section on the effects of a hydrostatic pressure, an important feature that may, like 
mobile dislocations, redistribute hydrogen within the material. Indeed, under a 
hydrostatic stress 𝜎௠, the apparent solubility is expressed as 𝑆(𝜎௠) = 𝑆(0)𝑒𝑥𝑝 ቂఙ೘୚ഥಹ
௞ಳ் ቃ
where 𝑆(0) is the solubility in the absence of stress and 𝑉ுതതത represents the partial 
molar volume of hydrogen (Martin et al. 2019). Both hydrostatic pressure and 
dislocation density can therefore play a key role in the redistribution of hydrogen in 
the vicinity of a notch (stress concentration) or crack (Dadfarnia et al. 2015). 
9.3.3. Evidence of HE 
Fundamental research has led to the definition of four broad classes of HE 
processes, which we briefly recall here based on review literature on the topic 
(Lynch 2011; Gangloff and Somerday 2012; Bosch et al. 2016; Feaugas and 
Delafosse 2019): brittle fracture by decreasing the cohesion of an interface (lattice, 
grain boundaries, interphases, etc.) caused by hydrogen segregation (HEDE), 
damage due to the formation of vacancies and their condensation in the presence of 
hydrogen (supra abondant vacancy [SAV]), failure by local increase in plasticity 
(adsorption-induced dislocation emission [AIDE] and/or HELP) and failure by 
formation of a brittle phase (hydride). Note that these four mechanisms are likely to 
occur separately or synergistically (Djukic et al. 2019). 
At the macroscopic scale, the presence of HE is characterized by two 
antagonistic effects on the strain hardening curve (stress vs. plastic strain): softening 
when HELP-type mechanisms are involved and hardening associated with Cottrell 
cluster formation (Feaugas and Delafosse 2019). Both of these processes are highly 
dependent on the plastic deformation rate (Bosch et al. 2016). Damage in the 
presence of hydrogen is generally characterized by a loss of ductility. The most 
relevant brittleness indices IHE = [1 – X(H)]/X (X = Z% or X = KIC) are based on 
the reduction in cross-sectional area at tensile specimen failure and on the 276 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
toughness. These effects increase as the strain rate decreases and the hydrogen 
content increases. However, recent studies have shown that more than the mobile 
hydrogen content, it is the hydrogen flux that seems to be the most relevant 
parameter with respect to HE (Frappart et al. 2012; Guedes et al. 2020). Where 
fatigue is concerned, it has been shown that in the presence of hydrogen, crack 
propagation can be accelerated by a factor of 10–100 depending on the steel, the 
hydrogen content and the test frequency. For more details, reference can be made to 
recent reviews on the subject (Gangloff and Somerday 2012; Bosch et al. 2016; 
Blanc and Aubert 2019). 
9.4. Case study: embrittlement of fastener steels 
The purpose of this section is to show, in the case of a few in-service situations, 
how the assessment of embrittlement situations could be conducted. Among the 
many possible examples, we have chosen to describe two particular applications 
where HE is a serious problem: high-strength fasteners and hot and cold stamped 
thin sheets. We could have chosen to discuss many other areas such as pipelines for 
the oil industry, aircraft landing gear, railroad tracks, steel cables for suspension 
bridges, or heat exchangers, to name a few critical applications. Although the 
techniques used by engineers and scientists to control HE differ depending on the 
end product, there are broad similarities in approach that we will highlight here with 
examples. 
High-strength fasteners are produced by cold stamping from wire or rod. The 
final components usually consist of a tempered martensitic microstructure. Bolt 
threads can be either machined or stamped. ISO 898-1 (ISO 2009) provides 
compositional limits for allowable carbon, phosphorus, sulfur and boron contents as 
well as the minimum tempering temperature. Other elements are not standardized. 
9.4.1. Recent incidents of in-service failures 
Since 1985, there have been five cases of SCC leading to the sudden and 
catastrophic failure of suspended ceilings in swimming pools, resulting in a 
combined loss of 56 lives in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Russia: Uster indoor 
pool (Zurich, Switzerland) in 1985, Steenwijk municipal pool (Steenwijk, the 
Netherlands) in 2001, Transvaal Park (Moscow, Russia) in 2004, Dolphin aquatic 
complex (Chusovoy, Russia) in 2005, and Zwembad Reeshof pool (Tilburg, the 
Netherlands) in 2011. In all cases, there was a catastrophic collapse of the suspended 
ceiling. In most of these incidents, the pools had fasteners made of insufficiently The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 277 
coated carbon steels or austenitic stainless steels (such as AISI 304 or AISI 316), 
which are susceptible to SCC cracking. 
In 2013, the San Francisco Bay Bridge in Oakland suffered a serious problem 
when 32 of the 96 anchor rods of 5 m long A354 grade BD (39 HRC max) 
galvanized steel used to hold giant seismic stabilizers on the span broke less than 
2 weeks after tightening (Chung and Fulton 2017). The failure was attributed to 
hydrogen that infiltrated the rods when they were left exposed to rainwater for 
5 years. The cost of the repairs was US$25 million. 
9.4.2. Phenomenological description and sensitivity parameters 
It is generally accepted that only electroplated fasteners with UTS> 1200 MPa 
(Rockwell C37/380 HV/ISO 12.9 and above) are susceptible to HE. If the fastener 
fails within a short period of time, that is, less than 48 h after installation, DF may be 
the cause. On the other hand, if the fastener fails in the same manner, but after a 
longer period of time, then SCC may be suspected. Of course, SCC can also occur 
on uncoated steels. 
Figure 9.2. Breakage frequency according to location on the part in two different 
environments (urban and in a seafront industrial area) (Uno et al. 2008) 278 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure 9.3. Notch failure stress as a function of hardness for hydrogen-loaded and 
unloaded steels with different microstructures (Nanninga et al. 2010). For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
HE always occurs first in the areas where the highest tensile stresses are present. In 
the case of screws and bolts, this corresponds to the root of the first engaged thread 
(Figure 9.2, zone c) or the fillet radius under the head (Figure 9.2, zone a). However, 
failure due to SCC can start from a different location if the corrosion attack is 
localized. In the case of nuts, the load distribution in the internal threads makes it 
much less likely that the threshold associated with HE will be exceeded. Therefore, 
HE-type failure of a nut, although theoretically possible, is rare. As an example, Figure 
9.2 shows the frequency of delayed failures of high-strength bolts as a function of their 
position along the test samples obtained during a 5-year controlled exposure trial in 
Japan at two different locations (Uno et al. 2008). It is clear from the graph that bolts 
fail most often by fracture in the threaded portion and especially at incomplete threads, 
where stress concentrations and plastic deformation are high. Several authors have 
studied the HE/SCC sensitivity of fastener steels. Hereafter, we list the most critical 
parameters with some comments. The chemical composition is a determining factor, 
which will be discussed in section 9.4.3. Hardness values and which phases are present 
are the two most commonly investigated elements. Nanninga et al. (2010) clearly 
demonstrated the negative effect of an increase in hardness (Figure 9.3). What is more 
surprising is the minor influence of the crystallographic phase. Overall, for the same The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 279 
hardness, there is no significant difference between tempered martensite, bainite or 
even pearlite. The tempering temperature (martensite) is an element affecting the 
metallurgical state. Several researchers have reported that the higher the tempering 
temperature of martensite, the lower the susceptibility to HE (Kuduzovic et al. 2014), 
for comparable values of YS and UTS (Manabe and Miyakoshi 2019). This behavior 
is related to the increase in martensite impact toughness and ductility with tempering 
temperature. The absence of cementite film formation at prior austenite grain 
boundaries after tempering at 600°C is an important advantage to note (Manabe and 
Miyakoshi 2019). 
Steel cleanliness is associated with the concentration of non-metallic particles 
(such as oxides, sulfides and nitrides) that are known to act as sites of stress 
concentration and irreversible hydrogen trapping. The higher their density, the lower 
the HE strength (Bhadeshia 2016). Grain boundary embrittlement is particularly 
important during intergranular crack propagation, which occurs preferentially along 
prior austenite grain boundaries. Residual elements that may segregate and weaken 
these joints, such as phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S), should be minimized. P levels 
below 100 ppm mass and S levels below 50 ppm mass are generally recommended. 
Grain size is a controllable parameter that can influence HE. Indeed, since cracking 
often propagates along prior austenite grain boundaries, several authors propose to 
minimize the size of these grains before the martensitic transformation (Morbacher 
and Senuma 2020). Nevertheless, the relative importance of this parameter is not 
clearly established and there are a number of contradictions in the literature (Kimura 
and Tsuzaki 2005). Intrinsic hydrogen content is an important issue, primarily for 
coated parts where the coating layer acts as a diffusion barrier for mobile hydrogen. 
There are many sources of intrinsic hydrogen. To name just a few: casting, slab 
reheating furnace, pickling (especially with acid such as HCl), cold forming (rolling 
or drawing with water-containing lubricant), austenitization annealing before 
quenching. Electrolytic coatings are also likely to introduce hydrogen during the 
coating process. Thus, the main drawback of electrogalvanization is the evolution of 
hydrogen at the cathode during Zn deposition. Hydrogen evolution and permeation 
occur in the initial stages when the steel surface has just been partially coated. Most 
of the hydrogen released is dissipated to the atmosphere, but some of the H2 
molecules dissociate at the surface and diffuse into the steel. In order to reduce this 
risk, ASTM B850 (ASTM 2015) strongly recommends that, for steels with UTS > 
1000 MPa, a thermal post-treatment (embrittlement relief treatment) be performed at 
190–220°C for at least 4–22 h within 1–3 h immediately after the electroplating 
phase. For galvanized coatings, here is very little or no hydrogen present during 
galvanization. Nevertheless, some authors have reported an up-quenching effect that 
would release some of the intrinsic hydrogen retained in the reversible traps of the 
ferritic matrix, leading to a certain brittleness of the steel (Brahimi and Yue 2009). 280 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
9.4.3. Martensitic steels – industrial strategies 
Two Japanese steelmakers, Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel, have published a series 
of papers on potential methods to improve the HE resistance of bolts made from ISO 
12.9 and higher high-strength martensitic steels. In doing so, the two manufacturers 
developed new compositions and heat treatments to produce the base rod, and then 
modified the fastener geometry to reduce local plastic deformation and tensile 
stresses. Setting aside the purely mechanical aspects of the bolt design changes, 
Nippon Steel’s strategy focused on four aspects: improving the toughness of the 
prior austenite grain boundaries (PAG) by reducing the concentrations of embrittling 
elements (P, S, Mn), reducing the size of the prior austenite grain boundaries by 
adding Nb, reducing cementite formation at the grain boundaries by using high￾temperature tempering (requires the addition of Mo), and introducing hydrogen traps 
by introducing precipitates of VC and Mo2C (Manabe and Miyakoshi 2019).

Kobe Steel followed a very similar approach, but also reduced the silicon (Si) 
content to a minimum (0.05 wt%) and added nickel (Ni) to achieve better PAG 
toughness (Namimura et al. 2003). They also added titanium (Ti) instead of niobium 
(Nb) for grain size control and to form mixed (Ti-Mo-V)C nanoprecipitates. Kobe 
reported that this reduced the austenitic grain size to 8 µm compared with 18.9 µm 
for a standard AISI 4140 grade. Both steelmakers presented logical arguments and 
experimental data for reducing the elements Mn, Si, P, S and, in the case of Kobe 
Steel, for adding Ni. However, it is important to compare this with a recent 
comprehensive study of nine commercial non-microalloyed fastener grades 
conducted by Brahimi et al. (2017). In this group of steels, P ranged from 40 wt ppm 
to 130 wt ppm, S ranged from 10 wt ppm to 180 wt ppm, Si ranged from 0.17 to 
0.27 wt%, and Ni ranged from 0.04 to 1.74 wt%. The steels were quenched and 
then tempered to four different hardness values (35 HRC, 39 HRC, 45 HRC and 
53 HRC). The authors then plotted the normalized HE ratio for each hardness level 
as a function of composition (expressed by the carbon equivalent value; CE(wt%) 
= C + Si/24 + Mn/6 + Cu/15 + Ni/12 + [Cr(1 − 0.016√Cr)]/8 + Mo/4) as shown in 
Figure 9.4. Surprisingly, they found no clear composition dependence in their 
results, but did find a strong dependence on hardness. 
If there is still some doubt about the influence of the martensitic base 
composition on the HE/SCC strength, the effect of the addition of the micro-alloying 
elements is much clearer. In Kobe Steel’s alloy, the precipitation of complex 
(Ti-Mo-V)C particles was observed. The authors state that a measured decrease in 
the amount of diffusible hydrogen is associated with hydrogen trapping by these 
precipitates. The alloy developed by Nippon Steel showed a marked improvement in 
a 200-h constant load notched tensile test under in situ hydrogen loading (Figure 9.5). 
Three tempering temperatures were tested: 550°C, 600°C and 630°C. Compared to 
the reference non-microalloyed steel (SCM440), the new alloy is clearly superior 
with the best results obtained at the highest tempering temperature. It should be 
noted that the presence of vanadium (V) also prevents the softening associated with 
tempering in this alloy. The authors also presented evidence that the mixed (V, Mo) 
C precipitates trapped more hydrogen than the VC precipitates, more so as the Mo 
content increased. 
Meanwhile, a different group of researchers at Nippon Steel led by Jun 
Takahashi used APT to directly visualize the interactions between deuterium and 
TiC and VC nanoprecipitates in ferritic steels (Takahashi et al. 2018). Deuterium 
loading is necessary as atom probe instruments have a high hydrogen background 
that completely masks the hydrogen signal of the analyzed volume. Another 
technical challenge is to avoid outgassing of the loaded deuterium during sample 
fabrication and transfer. Takahashi and colleagues designed an in situ loading cell so 282 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
that deuterium could be introduced into the sample after tip fabrication. In addition, 
the charged samples could be kept at cryogenic temperature during the transfer 
procedure.

under continuous H charging to the uncharged condition as a function of UTS for 
different alloys. The effect of tempering temperature is shown (Manabe and 
Miyakoshi 2019) 
The authors found that the amount of trapped D (or H), as measured by TDS, 
varied with the state of the precipitates. Samples that were aged before charging at 
610°C for up to 4 h showed low volumes of trapped hydrogen in the TDS analysis. 
However, the trapping efficiency increased sharply for aging times of 8 h and above, 
which corresponds to the maximum aging response time of the alloy. An example of 
the TAP results can be seen in Figure 9.6, where deuterium atoms strongly segregate 
on a precipitate of VC1–x (NaCl type cubic structure) that formed in the ferrite after 
8 h of aging. No such segregation was observed in the vanadium precipitates formed 
at 4 h. By comparing the total amount of trapped D with the C/V ratio in the 
precipitates they analyzed, the authors proposed that the site of trapping is not, as 
often postulated, geometric accommodation dislocations at the ferrite interface, but 
rather carbon vacancies in the {001}VC planes on the surface of the carbon sub- The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 283 
stoichiometric precipitates. This interpretation is in agreement with trapping 
energies of the order of 0.5 eV and is consistent with irreversible trapping. They 
noted that the measured C/V ratio decreased from 0.9 at aging times up to 4 h to 
0.75 (V4C3) at 8 h. This implies that stoichiometric VC precipitates are not effective 
hydrogen traps. It should be mentioned that the exact stoichiometry and 
crystallography of VC1–x in ferrite is still under debate (Epicier et al. 2008). It is 
possible that a similar mechanism occurs for hydrogen trapping by V, Nb and Ti 
carbides. Further research is therefore necessary. Finally, it should be noted that 
recent work has shown in maraging steels the great capacity of hydrogen storage by 
the elastic strain fields associated with B2-NiAl intermetallic particles. This storage 
being reversible does not guarantee a good resistance to HE (Rousseau et al. 2020).

9.5. Case study: HE of thin sheets 
Of particular current interest is the case of AHSS thin sheets developed to reduce 
vehicle weight (i.e. cold-rolled sheets of 1.5 mm or less) with strength levels equal to 
or greater than 1 GPa. These steels are formed by hot stamping (e.g. martensitic grades 
22MnB5), roll forming (martensitic grades such as MS1500) or cold stamping 
(DP980-1180). The specific case of hydroforming will not be discussed, because 
industrial experience on these parts is limited. Compared to the fasteners discussed in 
the previous section, HE of thin sheets is exacerbated by the effects of plastic 
deformation, either from cold forming or from cutting operations. We can differentiate 
between products where in-service deformation is low (DP1180 profiles or hot 
stamped martensitic grades) and those where significant plastic deformation is 
expected (stainless steels, Gen 2 and Gen 3 alloys). The former are very sensitive to 
HE due to edge cracking while the latter may exhibit both edge and matrix cracking. 
Figure 9.7 shows a rather extreme example of an electrogalvanized DP1180 
grade with delayed intergranular fracture after a slitting operation. The defect was 
found to occur even when the level of diffusible hydrogen measured by TDS was 
significantly less than 1 wt ppm. In this case, the in-plane tensile residual stresses 
measured by high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) in transmission 
mode were very low, ~100 MPa, illustrating the severity of the problem and the high 
susceptibility of this particular alloy. The same process improvement (hydrogen 
control, degassing annealing) and metallurgical techniques (austenitic grain size 
reduction, Mn reduction, hydrogen trapping by precipitates) cited in section 9.4.3 
were successfully applied to reduce the risk of HE on these products. 
The first thin sheet products to present a HE risk were austenitic steels, 
particularly those with low Ni content (200 series), which form large amounts of 
ε and α’ martensite during cold forming. The traditional method of DF/SCC risk 
evaluation in austenitic stainless steels is to deep draw a set of cups to the maximum 
drawing ratio βmax, where β is the ratio of the diameter of the circular blank to that of 
the drawn cup. As β increases, the circumferential residual stresses near the cup 
edge also increase. The time to the formation of the first DF crack at βmax, or 
alternatively, the drawing ratio β where no cracks occur during a given observation 
period, can be used as a qualitative indicator of HE susceptibility. 
The same technique can be applied to carbon steels under bare or coated 
conditions. The most aggressive accelerated test involves immersing the cups in 
water or even in a salt spray atmosphere. The great advantage of this simple test is 
the ease with which statistically significant amounts of data can be obtained. 
Samples are quick and easy to produce, and no other equipment (e.g. dedicated The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 285 
tensile testing machines) is required. Sometimes these tests can result in quite 
violent reactions, especially for martensitic steels, and care must be taken when 
handling the test specimens (Figure 9.7b).

9.5.1. Specific case: austenitic TWIP steel 
The steel in question, Fe-0.6C-22Mn, is a second-generation twinning induced 
plasticity (TWIP) steel originally developed for deep-drawn parts for car body-in￾white applications. The microstructure consists entirely of stabilized austenite and 
the mechanical properties in the cold rolled and annealed format are excellent with a 
tensile strength greater than 1 GPa and a uniform elongation of 50%. Unfortunately, 
it is susceptible to DF by HE (DF and SCC). 
Figure 9.8 shows an electrogalvanized cup with β = 1.8 that cracked in dry air a 
few days after drawing. The fracture surfaces were mixed, being mostly 
intergranular with a small fraction of QC at the initiation point A on the rim, then 
mixed islands of intergranular fracture connected by ductile ligaments at B, and 
finally to fully intergranular fracture with strong grain boundary decohesion at C. 
The amount of plastic strain and the circumferential tensile stresses increase from C 
to B to A. The intergranular islands at B were all centered around oxide inclusions. 
TEM and HEXRD studies confirmed that the matrix remained fully austenitic at the 
crack initiation point (A), that is, no martensitic transformation had occurred. Fully 
drawn cups in bare and EG-coated formats were formed with draw ratios that ranged 
from β = 1.1 to β = 1.8. The cups were immersed in tap water at 25°C and the time 
to first crack formation was recorded (Figure 9.9). When the cup drawing ratio was 286 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
equal to or less than β = 1.2, no cracking was observed even after 300 days (the 
observations continued up to 650 days with no change). In this experiment, the 
process or intrinsic hydrogen was progressively augmented by extrinsic hydrogen 
formed during the corrosion reactions, so that the total hydrogen content in the cups 
could theoretically reach very high values. Thus, the hypothesis of a critical residual 
tensile stress level required for DF/SCC was developed. At β = 1.3, the bare cups 
cracked while the zinc-plated cups did not. This clearly showed that SCC and not 
DF was the dominant mechanism at lower residual stress levels. At higher drawing 
ratios (residual stresses), the coating had no influence, and the failure mechanism 
was DF. Other related experiments involved heating and cooling the cups after 
formation and applying external compressive and tensile stresses.

Heating the uncoated cups tended to reduce DF, as recovery and relaxation 
effects acted to reduce residual stresses (note that applying the same heat treatment 
to the blanks before cup formation was not effective in reducing DF). In addition, 
cooling also produced a beneficial effect, probably because the diffusion rate of [H] 
was reduced. Increasing the residual stress by mechanically compressing or 
stretching the cup rims greatly accelerated the time to failure. The influence of the 
rim edge condition was found to be minor compared to the magnitude of the residual 
stress levels.

electrogalvanized (green) TWIP cups. Dotted columns indicate cracked cups, and 
solid columns mean no cracks were observed. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
9.5.2. TWIP steels – industrial strategies 
The main countermeasures taken to reduce the DF/SCC sensitivity were to 
reduce the amount of intrinsic hydrogen by modifying the production process and 
introducing an effusion annealing step after continuous annealing, to introduce 
hydrogen trapping via V(C,N) precipitates formed during the continuous annealing 
step, and to identify a safety criterion via experiment and finite element (FE) 
modeling. In some cases, this last countermeasure allowed critical regions of parts 
where the residual stresses/local strains were too high to be redesigned. 288 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
A significant reduction in the amount of intrinsic hydrogen was achieved by the 
method shown in Figure 9.10. In this way, it was possible to limit the total hydrogen 
content in finished coils to <2 ppm wt for uncoated coils and <3 ppm wt for 
electrogalvanized coils. The composition was modified by the addition of V to 
promote the precipitation of a fine dispersion of V(C,N) particles during the 
continuous annealing step. These served as additional traps for intrinsic hydrogen 
and also provided a useful increase in yield strength. Figure 9.11 is a TEM image of 
an extraction replica showing intra-granular V(C,N) precipitates with an average 
radius of 3.7 nm (data from industrial coils). Note that tomographic atom probe 
analysis indicated that these precipitates were stoichiometric. On the right is the 
striking effect of V additions on cups of β = 1.8 in dry air. All cups in an initial 
version of the alloy cracked within 1 day, while the first crack in the V-steel made 
under low intrinsic hydrogen conditions formed after 245 days (Figure 9.12). 
Figure 9.10. Method for controlling the amount of intrinsic hydrogen. For 
a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Although the introduction of V(C,N) precipitates is very successful in reducing 
DF, it is not able to eliminate SCC. The cup that cracked after 245 days did so due to 
surface corrosion, and similar cups immersed in water cracked within 10 days. The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 289 
Figure 9.11. TEM image of an extraction replica showing intragranular 
V(C,N) precipitates (sample from an industrial coil) 
The idea of a safety criterion stemmed logically from the realization that 
steelmakers could not reasonably expect to control or even predict the mobile 
hydrogen content of an arbitrary part subject to hydrogen ingress through corrosion 
reactions over time. A crucial observation justifying this approach was that the 
DF/SCC fracture surfaces were always normal to the sheet surface and that delayed 
cracking always occurred at the same positions in similar formed parts, regardless of 
the test environment. FE modeling was used to calculate residual stress mappings 
for different critical shaped stamped parts, and it was found, surprisingly, that the 
areas where cracks appeared first did not correspond to the regions with the highest 
levels of residual tensile stresses; ultimately, it was concluded that the missing 
parameter was related to the amount and type of local plastic deformation. In 
general, cold forming leads to a change in the recrystallized grains from an initially 
spherical shape to an elongated ellipsoidal shape. This effect is particularly apparent 
in the deep drawing region of the forming limit diagram (FLD). The intergranular 
nature of DF/SCC crack nucleation implies that grain boundaries are weak points in 290 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
this alloy and the most critical case was observed when the largest residual tensile 
stresses were aligned in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of the deformed 
ellipse. Stresses acting parallel to this axis were much less likely to generate cracks. 
In the augmented principal stress (APS) approach (Scott et al. 2009), the cross￾sectional area S′ of the deformed ellipse normal to the principal stress σI is 
calculated from the local strain tensor. S′ is then normalized by dividing it by the 
equivalent cross-sectional area S0 of an undeformed grain. The value of the APS 
(MPa) is given by: 
σAPS = (S’/So) ×σI [9.13] 
Figure 9.12. The effect of V(C,N) precipitates on the cracking time of uncoated cups 
with drawing ratio β = 1.8 in dry air. For a color version of this figure, see 
www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Thus, for the same level of residual stresses, grains in the thickening regions (ε3 > 0) 
due to deep drawing will tend to have a higher σAPS than grains in the expansion region 
of the FLD. This criterion is simple to incorporate into existing forming codes. The 
model provides a risk map for DF/SCC on any stamped part – it predicts the exact The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 291 
location and even the surface (interior or exterior) from which cracks initiate. It does 
not contain any description of crack propagation; however, the most likely direction of 
crack growth can be identified. A good example of the predictive capability of the 
model is the asymmetric box in Figure 9.13. The σAPS map on the right indicates that 
cracks tend to form at different positions (red areas) around the base of the box. 
A more detailed map of the indent region is shown in Figure 9.14. Two red areas 
slightly inclined from the vertical direction can be seen. Close inspection of the 
original part revealed the two very fine DF cracks in exactly these regions. These 
cracks had not been noticed before running the APS model!

surface. For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip

Although the model can predict where a part is likely to crack, it cannot predict 
when. This requires experimental observations of the behavior of a set of parts with 
different σAPS values in different corrosive environments (air, water, salt spray test, 
etc.). The simplest and most accurate experiments are based on constant load tensile 
tests where the stress state is defined by the testing machine. Experimentally, plots 
of σAPS versus time to nucleate the first crack show an asymptotic behavior, very 
similar to a Wöhler curve for fatigue. Below a certain critical value, σAPScrit, the 
specimens do not crack and the part can be considered completely safe. The power 
of the APS approach is that once the experimental value of σAPScrit has been 
determined for a given alloy, any arbitrary part can be evaluated for DF/SCC risks. 
In Figure 9.15, we can see that σAPScrit for the TWIP alloy is 600 MPa. Changing the 
severity of the corrosive environment – humid air, tap water, salt water, or salt spray 
– has a major influence on the cracking time, but it does not change the σAPScrit
value. Similarly, it does not matter whether the part is coated or not. Assuming 
hydrogen is present, parts containing regions where σAPSmax>σAPScrit will all 
eventually crack – sometimes more than 10 years after forming! In contrast, parts 
with σAPSmax<σAPScrit are completely safe, regardless of the corrosive environment.

A part with σAPSmax<σAPScrit will be free of cracking by DF/SCC. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 293 
This approach was successfully used in 2008 to predict the safety of a structural 
component of a popular vehicle from a major European car manufacturer. The part, 
as designed by the manufacturer, was analyzed to identify two critical areas where 
σAPSmax>σAPScrit. Then, the design was modified to reduce σAPSmax in these areas. 
After 12 years of production and with over 2 million examples sold, no hydrogen 
cracking problems were detected. 
9.6. Research and perspectives 
There are currently many active areas of research on HE of high-strength steels. 
In the automotive sector, the most industrially important work is in the area of 
martensitic hot forming steels (PHS), where strengths in excess of 1500 MPa are 
sought. These new grades are needed to reduce vehicle weight, but can be extremely 
sensitive to HE, especially in the coated condition when outgassing of H by natural 
aging is strongly suppressed. Building on previous work on martensitic fasteners, 
researchers are testing the effects of controlling PAG size and micro-alloying with 
carbide-forming elements (Nb, Mo, V) as a means of reducing sensitivity to HE. For 
example, Morbacher and Senuma (2020) reported the positive effect of Nb and Mo 
additions in PHS alloys with UTS > 2 GPa. They showed a significant improvement 
in fracture time in constant load tests with reduced PAG size. Interestingly, they 
attributed the enhancement to solid solution interactions of Mo with H atoms, 
reducing the effective diffusivity of H, and to the interactions of dislocations with 
NbC, which acts to reduce the HELP mechanism. 
The influence of NbC precipitation is clearly illustrated in Figures 9.1a and 9.1b, 
which show the effect of NbC on the fracture surface morphology of a hydrogen￾charged 1400 MPa PHS steel (Pushkareva et al. 2010). The two alloys have very 
similar tensile properties and PAG sizes. However, the presence of NbC in the alloy 
on the right, formed during the austenitization step before entering the hot press, 
drastically changes the fracture mode from totally intergranular (HEDE mechanism) 
to predominantly transgranular (HELP mechanism). Other authors have investigated 
V additions as a means to reduce the detrimental effects of hydrogen uptake in the 
hot forming furnace of AlSi-coated PHS steels (Cho et al. 2018). Although positive 
results were shown, it is unclear whether the effect is due to precipitated VC or V in 
solid solution due to the rapid dissolution of VC during the austenitization process. 
A similar study (Lin et al. 2021) performed on an uncoated electrolytically charged 
material at room temperature concluded that the incoherent precipitation of VC was 
beneficial for HE in that it contributed to the refinement of the PAGs, and that any 
direct H-trapping effect was secondary. 294 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
The risk of HE in medium Mn steels has been extensively studied and a recent 
review article by Cho et al. (2021) is available. These multiphase alloys are often 
extremely complex with highly variable microstructures depending on the 
processing route. The authors concluded that the HE of medium Mn steels was 
strongly correlated with the mechanical stability of the residual austenite. Stable 
austenite is considered beneficial for HE because it forms less fresh martensite 
during deformation, that is, the TRIP effect is reduced. If the mechanical stability of 
austenite is kept constant, then alloys containing higher austenite fractions are more 
resistant to HE. The effect of microstructural morphology (e.g. lamellar or equiaxed 
austenite) is unclear and conflicting results have been reported. The influence of 
microalloying on HE has not been studied much in these steels. Although the final 
microstructures of medium Mn alloys are generally extremely fine, some data 
suggest that further reduction in PAG grain size (e.g. by warm rolling) contributes to 
reduced HE. 
Some authors have proposed that grain boundary engineering may be a useful 
solution to HE. In particular, the introduction of more coherent type Σ3 joints seems 
to be beneficial. For example, high entropy alloys (HEAs) such as Cantor’s alloy, 
CoCrFeMnNi, which show improved ductility at cryogenic temperatures, are known 
to suffer from HE at room temperature, but appear to be immune to HE at 77 K (Luo 
et al. 2018). This has been linked to the large increase in the deformation twin 
density that occurs under low-temperature straining. Furthermore, Koyama et al. 
(2018) claim that large fractions of ductile ε-martensite formed in metastable HEAs 
are beneficial for fatigue crack growth resistance in hydrogen environments. 
Similarly, texture manipulation has been claimed to have an effect on the HE of 
pipeline steels with a mixed matrix containing the presence of ferrite, bainite and 
martensite (Arafin and Szpunar 2009). For example, there is evidence that textures 
with grains oriented such that the {111} planes are parallel to the normal direction of 
the rolling plane (ND) exhibit increased resistance to hydrogen-induced cracking, 
while grains oriented with {001} parallel to ND are more susceptible to hydrogen 
cracking. 
HE in additively manufactured products has not yet been studied extensively, 
although the high residual stresses generated during the melting and solidification 
process are likely to cause HE in susceptible alloys. One area of interest is the 
influence of the 3D cell structure observed in austenitic steels fabricated by laser 
powder bed melting (LPBF), which has been proposed as a favorable site for 
hydrogen trapping and improved resistance to HE (Kong et al. 2021). The Relationship between Mechanical Strength and Hydrogen Embrittlement 295 
Finally, modeling HE from the atomic to the continuum scale is a challenging 
area where new advances are constantly being made. The latest DFT modeling 
results for hydrogen trapping energies in MC precipitates is a good example (Zhang 
et al. 2021). We have commented little on this approach due to space constraints, but 
recent review articles describing the state of the art are available (Barrera et al. 
2018; Blanc and Aubert 2019). 
The major challenge in the HE of steels is to determine which of the many 
possible failure mechanisms is important in complex microstructures under widely 
varying sets of experimental conditions. In conclusion, the main options for 
mitigating DF/SCC can be summarized as follows: 
– reduce residual or applied stress levels; 
– reduce the amount of intrinsic hydrogen (manufacturing process control); 
– if possible, use degassing treatments to decrease the diffusible hydrogen 
content; 
– introduce deep trapping sites (e.g. VC) to further reduce diffusible hydrogen; 
– reduce the grain size of austenite/prior austenite; 
– prevent the entry of extrinsic hydrogen, for example with protective coatings or 
surface passivation techniques; 
– use “clean” steelmaking methods to minimize the amount of inclusions; 
– minimize the segregation of known embrittling elements such as P, S at 
austenite/prior austenite grain boundaries; 
– avoid weakening the grain boundaries by the presence of intergranular 
precipitates or second phases. This is especially important for prior austenite grain 
boundaries in martensitic steels; 
– if residual austenite is present, it must be made as stable as possible.

10.1. Introduction 
10.1.1. Overview 
The processes for joining materials by welding are numerous and can essentially 
be classified either in the family of solid phase processes or in the family of 
processes leading to fusion. The latter are the most common and lead to higher 
working temperatures, and therefore to more modifications of the base materials, we 
will concentrate this chapter on the description of their effects. 
In this zone, which is heated to a very high temperature, the steel melts locally 
and then resolidifies, generating locally what we will describe later as the fusion 
zone (FZ). This zone can be punctual, as in resistance spot welding, or continuous, 
for example in laser welding. An external addition of material (filler) can also 
intervene, diluting the original chemical composition. The change is then even more 
radical. We can quote as examples the GMAW or submerged arc processes. 
Maintaining adequate properties in the weld despite these upheavals is therefore 
a major challenge, especially since the steel was precisely designed to optimize 
these properties. Although it is theoretically possible to control the thermal cycle of 
welding to recover optimized properties in the welded zone, in practice, strong 304 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
constraints generally prevent the implementation of this strategy: limited time 
available, impossibility of thermomechanical treatments such as work hardening, 
etc. We also note the existence of a thermal gradient in the welded zone, which 
prevents the optimization of both the hottest zones in the heart of the weld (where a 
“reset” of the microstructure can be considered) and the least hot zones close to the 
base metal (where the inheritance of the initial microstructure remains inevitable). 
The intense local heating due to welding also results in expansion and shrinkage 
phenomena that will introduce a stress field following the welding. The 
establishment of these stresses is complex due to the variable physical properties and 
structural modifications occurring during cooling. The level of stresses introduced in 
the welded areas can be very high, up to two-thirds or even 100% of the material’s 
yield strength. 
Traditionally, weldability is considered under the following three aspects: 
metallurgical, operative and constructive (ISO/TR 581:2005): 
– Metallurgical weldability: covers the ability of the welded material to undergo 
the thermal cycle of welding without developing prohibitive defects concerning 
material properties influenced by manufacturing and design (risk of cold cracking, 
hot cracking, reheating cracking, local softening, etc.); these aspects are the focus of 
this chapter. 
– Constructive weldability: covers the ability of the weld to meet the 
serviceability requirements of the part, influenced by the material and design 
(mechanical strength, fatigue failure, brittle fracture, corrosion resistance, creep 
resistance, etc.); although part of the constructive weldability is determined by the 
geometry of the welds, the transformations of the initial steel are also important, and 
some of these aspects are also considered in this chapter. 
– Operative weldability: covers the ability of the chosen process to be 
implemented robustly and without producing defects in link with the design and the 
materials (lack of fusion, porosities); it may happen that the design choices of the 
steel influence the operative weldability (e.g. some alloying elements added to 
obtain mechanical strength may modify the thermal properties of the steel to the 
point of making it difficult to weld with another steel of more standard thermal 
properties, or may create hygiene constraints due to the toxicity of the fumes emitted 
during welding), but this is relatively secondary and will not be discussed further in 
this chapter. 
All these aspects interact to finally obtain a joint giving the expected 
serviceability: for example, the welding conditions with the metallurgy will lead to a 
residual stress field which will influence the service life. Weldability of High Strength Steels 305 
10.1.2. Microstructural changes in the heat-affected zone 
Whatever the welding process, the thermal cycle is characterized by a very rapid 
rise of the local temperature, followed by a more or less rapid cooling depending on 
the different operating parameters. Thus, cooling times between 800 and 500°C of 
the order of 2–3 s can be observed for laser and electron beam welding processes, 
but also for spot welding. On the other hand, much longer times up to several tens of 
seconds can be obtained with more energetic processes such as submerged arc 
welding. In the case of fusion welding processes, this local temperature exceeds the 
melting temperature of the metals concerned and can even approach 2000°C in the 
case of steels. 
Figure 10.1. Representation of the thermal distribution through a welded 
joint and the different zones of the HAZ. For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
We can distinguish between the FZ, where the metal has been melted and where 
the steels of each part to be welded are mixed, and the heat-affected zone (HAZ), 
generally defined by the passage through the austenitic phase, that is, beyond the 
Ac1 temperature (700–750°C) of the iron-carbon diagram (Granjon 1995). It is 
therefore possible to delimit the width of the HAZ by plotting the evolution of the 
maximum temperature reached as a function of the distance to the welded joint on a 
graph called thermal distribution (Figure 10.1). In the case of steels with allotropic 
transformations, we can distinguish the intercritical zone, ICHAZ, where the 306 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
temperature is between Ac1 and Ac3, then the zone that has been completely 
austenitized, including both a fine-grained zone, FGHAZ, and a coarse-grained 
zone, CGHAZ, where the temperature has exceeded 1200°C. We will see later in 
this chapter that this description of the HAZ can be restrictive considering materials 
that may show softening of the initial microstructure at temperatures below 700°C 
(subcritical zone SCHAZ), especially by recovery or tempering effect. 
The microstructures obtained in these different areas of the weld are also 
determined by the post-weld cooling rate, usually expressed as the cooling time 
from 800 to 500°C (tr85). This rate, or cooling time, is representative of the thermal 
cycle of welding and depends on several factors (see equation [10.1]): 
– First of all the welding process. Resistance or high energy density processes 
(laser, electron beam) have significantly shorter cooling times than arc welding 
processes. 
– Then the geometry of the parts to be welded; a greater mass of metal (high 
thickness) generally means faster cooling by conduction. 
– Finally, a higher welding energy, noted Q hereafter, results in longer cooling 
times (thermal inertia effect). 
Calculation formula of tr85 for thin sheets (NF EN 1011-2:2002) where Q is the 
heat input (welding energy), t is the sheet thickness, T0 is the preheating 
temperature, λ is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density and c is the specific heat 
capacity: 
𝑡𝑟଼ହ = ொమ
ସగఒఘ௖௧మ . ቀ ଵ
(ହ଴଴ି்బ)మ − ଵ
(଼଴଴ି்బ)మቁ [10.1] 
The cooling rate is generally defined at 700°C and its expression for a bithermal 
(or thin sheet) regime is defined by the following equation (Adams 1958): 
𝑉௥଻଴଴°஼ = ଶ஠஛஡ୡ୲²
୕² ሾ700 − T଴ሿଷ [10.2] 
The welding energy is the essential parameter available to the welder to 
influence the quality of the welded joint. In the case of arc welding processes, such 
as GTAW, GMAW, etc., this energy Q is related to the electric current I, the arc 
voltage U and the welding speed Vs by equation [10.3]. The parameter η represents 
the thermal efficiency of the process, that is, this coefficient takes into account the 
losses induced by spatter, radiation, etc., and varies between 60 and 100% 
depending on the process considered: Weldability of High Strength Steels 307 
𝑄 = 𝜂. ௎.ூ
௏௦ [10.3] 
It is therefore possible to describe the final microstructures of the HAZ using 
so-called CCTw (continuous cooling transformations adapted to welding), which 
take into account the microstructure evolutions by considering an austenitic 
microstructure cooled at high speeds such as those observed in welding. The 
example of Figure 10.2 illustrates the case of a dual-phase DP780 steel for which the 
critical quenching rate tr85leading to the formation of a 100% martensitic structure is 
close to 10 s. 
Figure 10.2. CCT diagram of a dual-phase DP780 steel 
10.2. Weldability issues 
10.2.1. Softening in HAZ and FZ 
As the welding operation leads to a local melting supported by a temperature 
gradient spreading from the FZ to the base metal, a possible modification/alteration 
of the mechanical properties of the initial base metal in HAZ should be considered. 
These modifications generally appear beyond the Ac1 isotherm, but also potentially 
in subcritical HAZ depending on the microstructure of the metal in the delivery 
state. Several mechanisms can occur and are detailed below. As modern high￾strength steels have fully or partially martensitic and bainitic microstructures, only 308 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
the softening mechanisms are presented here. It is also necessary to take into 
account a potential softening of the FZ under the effect of slow cooling rates, 
generating solidification structures forming at higher temperatures, as well as 
coarser grains. Finally, the thermal inertia of the part can play the role of post-weld 
heat treatment (PWHT) and generate self-tempering phenomena. 
10.2.1.1. Annealing 
During the temperature rise, the HAZ heated to a temperature higher than Ac3 
will then be totally austenitic, erasing locally all the thermomechanical history of the 
base metal. Only the heritage of solidification (inclusions or precipitates, 
segregations, etc.) will remain. Depending on the cooling rate and on the 
hardenability of the steel, generally transcribed through a notion of equivalent 
carbon, all the classical structures can then be formed, from ferrite to martensite, as 
illustrated on the CCTw diagram (Figure 10.2). In fact, it is not uncommon to see 
materials delivered in the martensitic and/or bainitic state presenting ferrito-perlitic 
structures in HAZ. 
10.2.1.2. Grain coarsening 
Grain coarsening, already presented in the appendix for the case of base metals, 
can also occur during welding operations. This can appear in particular in the case of 
ferritic steels and ferritic stainless steels, which will then see their grain size 
increasing linearly along the HAZ as the maximum temperature reached is higher. 
Such a grain size increase induces a local drop in the mechanical properties (YS, 
UTS, CVN), illustrated by the Hall–Petch law recalled below, where the grain size is 
represented by the letter D: 
𝜎=𝜎଴ + ௄
√஽ [10.4] 
Most steels have allotropic transformations and are less sensitive to the 
coarsening of their initial microstructure, this phenomenon being attenuated by the 
austenitic transformation during heating, starting at Ac1 and ending at Ac3. 
Nevertheless, this austenite will be sensitive to this phenomenon and we observe a 
significant coarsening of the size of the austenitic grains in the HAZ at more than 
1200°C (CGHAZ). These large austenitic grains lead to a modification of the 
transformations during cooling (larger ferrite grain size, greater hardenability with 
greater presence of bainite and martensite). This zone generally measures a few 
hundred micrometers for the lowest welding energies and can reach a millimeter or 
more in case of slow cooling (Figure 10.3). Weldability of High Strength Steels 309 
To limit this phenomenon of grain coarsening, it is possible to slow down the 
movement of the grain boundaries by adding titanium and boron, for example, or, in 
the case of micro-alloyed steels, by forming niobium or vanadium carbides. 
Figure 10.3. Grain growth in the overheated HAZ. For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
10.2.1.3. Recrystallization and recovery 
The recrystallization and recovery phenomena used during high-temperature 
rolling are also undergone in subcritical HAZ (SCHAZ) for steels showing residual 
work hardening in the delivery condition. This is, for example, the case of 
thermomechanical steels, for which it is advisable to limit the welding energy and 
the interpass temperature in order to limit the extent of this phenomenon. 
Recrystallization phenomena (to be taken here in the broad sense of new grain 
formation) are also present in the case of multi-pass welding, where part of the 
microstructure from the previous passes is reaustenitized, leading to the appearance 
of finer grains in these areas of the FZ during the cooling process (Figure 10.4). 
These fine-grained areas may have higher mechanical properties than the rest of the 310 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
FZ. It is therefore strongly advised to anticipate these phenomena and to pay 
attention to the filling sequence in order to maximize the percentage of recrystallized 
zone. 
It is also common to make “additional” beads above the bevel in order to 
recrystallize the last filling passes as well, and then to level off this deposit which 
has no mechanical role and may reduce the fatigue strength. This is called temper 
bead.

microalloyed steel illustrating interpass recrystallization in the fusion zone 
10.2.1.4. Tempering and over-tempering 
It is common in high-strength steels to have non-equilibrium structures such as 
bainite and martensite present in the delivery state. If these structures are partially 
or completely lost beyond the Ac1 isotherm, they remain submitted to high 
temperatures just below Ac1. It is in fact possible to observe in this zone tempering 
phenomena of martensitic structures and overtempering of structures initially 
delivered in the tempered state (S690QL steel, for example). Weldability of High Strength Steels 311 
Figure 10.5. Subcritical HAZ softening of a 1500 MPa martensitic steel. 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
These local softening phenomena (Figure 10.5) can be problematic, as they lead 
to a drastic decrease in the tensile properties in materials with high mechanical 
properties. This softened zone represents a weak point and can lead to premature 
failure of the parts in case of strong stress, the deformations being concentrated in 
this zone. An example is the case of automotive parts made of AHSS subjected to 
high stresses in case of a crash (see Chapter 7). It is then necessary to integrate this 
area during the design process, trying as much as possible to place the welds in less 
stressed areas. It should also be noted that for most hardened and tempered steels 
this softening is very small in intensity and width, not leading to a degradation of the 
overall properties. 
10.2.2. Toughness-resilience 
10.2.2.1. In the heat-affected zone 
Depending on the structure obtained, the HAZ hardness as well as the transition 
temperature in the CVN test (see Chapter 7) change (Figure 10.6). The optimum for 
the transition temperature is at the critical cooling rate leading to a 100% martensitic 
structure (see Figure 10.2). The appearance of bainite at grain boundaries results in 312 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
an increase in this temperature (Bernard and Prudhomme 1972; IRSID 1976; 
Liégeois 1980; Bonnet 2001; Kaplan and Murry 2001; Haouas 2015). As a result, 
welding conditions will aim to maintain a minimum level of hardness.

temperature at 28 J in Charpy-V Notch test. E470 (20MnV6) low-alloy steel, 
simulated HAZ, maximum temperature 1250°C, dwell time 1 s, bithermal cooling 
mode (Ferrari 2017) Weldability of High Strength Steels 313 
The optimal thermal cycle should be controlled so as not to exceed the critical 
cooling rate leading to a fully martensitic structure. The hardness levels will then be 
close to the hardness of martensite in the coarse-grained zone of the HAZ (i.e. close 
to the fusion boundary), but without excess to avoid a possible risk of cold cracking. 
This critical speed can be expressed as a function of the chemical composition 
(expressed in mass percentage) (Bourges et al. 1993): 
𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑉𝑟଻଴଴°஼) = 7.42 − 3.13 × C − 0.71 × Mn − 0.37 × Ni − 0.34 × Cr −
0.45 × M [10.5] 
In HAZ, vanadium and niobium precipitates can be dissolved during the welding 
thermal cycle. On cooling with slow thermal welding cycles, hardening precipitates 
can lead to a decrease in the transition temperature (Blondeau 1980). The addition of 
stresses, in relatively small amounts, has a beneficial role in slowing down the 
growth of the primary austenitic grain, either by forming carbides or by fixing some 
of the free nitrogen in the form of nitrides. Titanium precipitates are also much more 
difficult to dissolve. Boron, on the other hand, must be limited to 10–15 ppm to 
avoid embrittlement by precipitation of intermetallic compounds (Lafrance 2000; 
Kaplan and Murry 2001). 
Nickel lowers processing temperatures and refines grain size. It has a positive 
effect on the toughness in HAZ (Blondeau 1980).
10.2.2.2. In the fusion zone 
In the FZ, the brittle fracture toughness can be related mainly to two parameters: 
the tensile strength (UTS) and the oxygen content, especially at the upper shelf of 
the transition curve (Bourges et al. 1993). For an energy absorbed in an impact 
bending test at a given temperature, the influencing parameters may also include the 
nickel content, which increases the mechanical properties without decreasing the 
toughness of the FZ. 
10.2.3. Cold cracking 
During welding operations, the hydrogen present in the high-temperature zone 
around the weld will be dissociated into H+ protons, which will then get into the FZ 
and partially diffuse toward the HAZ. The sources of hydrogen are multiple, but we 
can mention among others the humidity of the ambient air, the presence of grease, 
the humidity on the surface of the parts to be welded or in the consumables. 
The hydrogen recombination equations described in Chapter 9 remain true in this 
case. Thus, mobile hydrogen as described in this chapter, or diffusible hydrogen as it 314 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
is named in standards such as ISO 3690:2018, will be able to diffuse and concentrate 
in areas where it can find space, such as gaps, but also areas of weld defects. This 
concentration will then generate a local increase in pressure and the appearance of 
stresses. 
If the residual shrinkage stresses in this area are high (not to mention the stress 
concentrations due to geometry, clamping and clearance adjustment) and if the 
microstructure has a certain brittleness, such as high-carbon martensite for example, 
then the cold cracking mechanism can be triggered, leading to partial or total 
cracking of the part. It should be noted that the welding sequences must be carefully 
prepared and respected to avoid/limit the tensile loading of a previous welds. 
Since the simultaneous action of these three parameters (stress, structure, 
hydrogen) is necessary (see Chapter 9), the suppression of one of them is sufficient 
to avoid the cracking occurrence. 
Welders frequently use the concept of carbon equivalent to evaluate a potential 
cold cracking risk. The most known formula is the one determined by Dearden and 
O’Neil for the International Institute of Welding (IIS/IIW). This formula gives 
different weight to various alloying elements so that their effect can be compared to 
that of carbon alone. Through the welding tests carried out by the various 
laboratories working on weldability, it is commonly accepted that the weldability of 
steels becomes more complex for a CEIIW higher than 0.43, and even becomes 
delicate beyond 0.50. Note that, in some supply standards, this CEIIW can also be 
noted CEV:

It should be noted that steelmakers have little or no recourse to normalized steels 
for high-strength steels, but rather to thermomechanical rolling or to steels that are 
quenched and tempered, which make it possible to achieve high levels of tensile 
properties with a low-alloy chemical composition compared to normalized steels. 
This reduction in carbon equivalent is obviously favorable to improved weldability, 
but it should be noted that the CEIIW does not take into account certain elements such 
as titanium, boron or niobium. It should also be noted that, in the case of high￾strength steels, the CET carbon equivalent formula established using Tekken-type 
weldability tests on a large panel of high-strength steels is generally preferred:

The Graville diagram (Figure 10.7), using yet another carbon equivalent formula, 
allows defining three different weldability zones. Zone I, where the risk of cracking 
is very limited, includes thermomechanical steels in particular; Zone III, where the 
risk is real and preheating is necessary, and includes tempered steels; and Zone II, 
where control of welding energy may be sufficient to prevent against the risk of 
cracking, and includes mainly normalized steels (Jubin et al. 2015). 
Figure 10.7. Distribution of different normalized, thermomechanical and 
tempered structural steels on the Graville diagram. For a color version 
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
All these formulas provide a simple method of assessing cold cracking 
susceptibility, but diffusible hydrogen content must not be forgotten. Thus, in most 
cases, a diffusible hydrogen content of less than 5 mL/100 g of deposited metal 
should be guaranteed, or even less than 2 mL/100 g of deposited metal for the most 
sensitive materials. 
10.2.3.1. Cracking in the HAZ 
Cold cracking in HAZ is a well-known mechanism and generally efficiently 
controlled by welders who have a strong experience in low alloy steels. However, it 316 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
is not uncommon to find cracks at the tacking zones where the welder has neglected 
to apply the same rules of execution as for the weld (Figure 10.8). 
Figure 10.8. Cold cracking in HAZ of a fillet weld made between a 
6 mm S235 plate and a 42CrMo4 steel pin. For a color version 
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
In addition to controlling the diffusible hydrogen content, the first action lever 
available to the welder is to increase the welding energy in order to control the 
cooling rate in the HAZ and thus limit the formation of the “brittle” phases, thus 
suppressing one of the three parameters essential to this mechanism. However, 
welding energies should be limited to avoid degradation of the mechanical 
properties of the FZ and the HAZ (see sections 10.2.1 on softening and 10.2.2 on 
toughness). 
When the control of the cooling rate by the welding energy is not possible, the 
use of preheating is essential. The numerous weldability tests carried out in research 
laboratories have made it possible to define several methods for predicting the 
sensitivity to cold cracking, described in the standard NF EN 1011-2:2002 and the 
technical document FD CEN ISO/TR 17844:2005. Weldability of High Strength Steels 317 
These methods make it possible to link the heat input, the hydrogen supply and 
the carbon equivalent to the minimum preheating temperature to be used, but they 
have the disadvantage of being either too conservative or on the contrary 
insufficient, as in particular the formula based on the CET carbon equivalent. 
Moreover, they can lead to preheating temperatures that are too high, resulting in 
significant softening phenomena, and the use of postheating may then become 
necessary. 
Unlike preheating, postheating does not affect the cooling kinetics, but rather the 
diffusion of hydrogen, which is activated by temperature. Thus, holding the 
temperature after welding allows the hydrogen diffusing outside the HAZ, or even 
outside the part, while blocking the establishment of residual shrinkage stresses. It is 
common to use preheats near 150°C with postheats at 150°C for 1–2 h (Figure 10.9). 
It has been shown that a 2-h postheating lowers, on average, the preheat temperature 
by about 50°C. 
The determination of the optimal welding operating conditions can only be done 
through weldability tests such as Tekken tests (NF EN ISO 17642-2:2005) or 
implant tests (NF EN ISO 17642-3:2005).

steel, as a function of the diffusible hydrogen content in fusion zone – welding energy

uk/goune/newsteels.zip 318 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
10.2.3.2. Cracking in the FZ 
Unlike base metals, which benefit from thermomechanical treatments, the FZ 
mechanical properties come mainly from its chemical composition (partly also from 
its basaltic microstructure and potential interpass recrystallization). 
Since the welding of steels requires matching filler metals, that is, filler metals 
that give at least the same mechanical tensile properties as the base metals, it is 
common to obtain higher carbon equivalent values in the fusionzone than in the 
HAZ, and thus to see the risk of cracking shifting from the HAZ to the FZ. 
Maltrud et al. showed that the FZ should be considered whenever the FZ CET 
value is greater than the HAZ plus 0.03. In this case, the predictive methods cited in 
section 10.2.3 should be used, taking into account the carbon equivalent value of the 
FZ. At the same time, it is necessary to take into account the temperature of the 
beginning of the martensitic transformation generally marked Ms (Maltrud 2006). 
Thus, if MsHAZ > MsFZ, the weld remains austenitic at temperatures where the HAZ 
is already transformed, little hydrogen would diffuse toward the HAZ, thus shifting 
the risk to the FZ. The formulas for calculating Ms proposed by Self are recalled 
here: 
Msୌ୅୞(°C) = 521 − 350C − 14.3Cr − 17.5Ni − 28.9Mn − 37.6Si −

10.2.4. Hot cracking 
The solidification of the FZ is accompanied by a shrinkage which is more or less 
compensated by the displacement of the elements to be joined. As a result, 
solidification is accompanied by clamping leading to plastic deformation at high 
temperature. Cracking can then occur according to two mechanisms (Maltrud and 
Decaestecker 1991; Granjon 1995) (Figure 10.10): 
– high temperature cracking, caused by the lack of liquid metal necessary to fill 
the voids resulting from shrinkage during solidification: this type of cracking is 
similar to a shrinkage and is found in the axis of the FZ; Weldability of High Strength Steels 319 
– cracking at lower temperature of brittle constituents segregated during 
solidification in the HAZ and in the FZ. This is called hot cracking (by liquidation 
when it is the HAZ). 
Figure 10.10. Hot cracking: (a) longitudinal; (b) interdendritic. For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 320 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
While the intensity of restraint is theoretically related to the mechanical 
properties of the base materials and the FZ as well as the welding energy, the risk of 
hot cracking is more related to the chemical composition, the shape of the weld pool 
and the welding speed than to the mechanical properties (Bonnet 2001).
10.2.4.1. Hot cracking in FZ 
The chemical composition of the fused metal – that is, that of the filler metal, but 
taking into account the dilution of the base material – is important, with in particular 
the contents of elements that can segregate in the interdendritic zones, or even 
combine to produce eutectics: carbon, sulfur, phosphorus as well as boron (Bailey 
and Jones 1978; Liégeois 1980). For the latter, the critical threshold to generate a 
risk would be higher than 0.01% (Bailey 1994). Vanadium, which is found in many 
high-strength micro-alloyed steels, would limit the risk of hot cracking (Bailey 
1994). 
The best-known formulation that summarizes these effects is known as UCS 
(units of crack susceptibility) (Garland and Bailey 1975; Bailey and Jones 1978): 
UCS = 223 × Maxሾ0.08; Cሿ + 190 × S + 75 × P + 45 × Nb − 12.3 × Si −
5.4 × Mn − 1 [10.10] 
This formulation developed for submerged arc welding is valid for other arc 
processes for the following chemical compositions: 0.08 ≤ % C ≤ 0.23; 0.010 ≤ % S 
≤ 0.050; 0.010 ≤ % P ≤ 0.045; 0.15 ≤ % Si ≤ 0.65; 0.45 ≤ % Mn ≤ 1.6; % Nb ≤ 0.07. 
Although carbon content increases the risk of hot cracking, it only has an effect 
above a content of 0.08%, that is, above a peritectic reaction during solidification. 
Many steels with high mechanical properties obtained by thermomechanical rolling 
have carbon contents lower than or equal to this value. 
For steels with high mechanical properties, the sulfur content is generally 
contained at low values, avoiding this risk. However, a certain number of grades are 
micro-alloyed with boron, an element that can promote this risk of cracking. 
Similarly, other grades involving heat treatment hardening phenomena after forming 
(bake hardening) are based on the addition of phosphorus to obtain this hardening 
effect. 
The application of this formula to high energy density welding processes is not 
wise because of the cooling speed and the shape of the beads; however, the interest 
of reducing the carbon, sulfur, phosphorus and niobium contents and the beneficial 
effect of manganese and silicon will be retained. Weldability of High Strength Steels 321 
Figure 10.11. Influence of UCS susceptibility index and feed rate on the risk of hot 
cracking in fusion zone during fillet welding with GMAW process – G3Si1 wire 
(Maltrud and Decaestecker 1991). For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co. 
uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
The increase in heat input results in greater dilution of the base metal as well as 
increased penetration. These two factors combined lead to an increased risk of hot 
cracking. It thus appears possible, for a given assembly, once the heat input has been 
chosen, to determine a maximum critical welding speed that will avoid hot cracking 
(Maltrud and Decaestecker 1991) (Figure 10.11). 
Other factors favoring the risk of hot cracking are the shape of the bath, in 
particular the depth to width ratio, and the welding speed. The criticality of these 
two parameters is related to the chemical composition of the FZ (Maltrud and 
Decaestecker 1991). 
10.2.4.2. Liquation 
Liquation cracking is sometimes referred to as hot cracking, which is actually 
cracking near the fusion boundary in the heat affected zone. In this zone, sometimes 
called PMZ (partially melted zone), grain boundaries where low melting point 
elements have segregated will be brought to a liquid state during welding. The 322 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
shrinkage stresses generated by the cooling of the liquid bath will, during the 
cooling, tear these films and create the cracking. These liquaction phenomena are 
relatively well documented on nickel base alloys as well as on aluminum alloys. 
They can also exist on certain steels with a poorly elaborated design. 
Liquation in the heat-affected zone occurs on steel supplies with high contents of 
sulfur, copper, arsenic and tin. The transformation kinetics at high temperatures, in 
the immediate vicinity of the melt, lead to a migration of impurities present in the 
base material and to their accumulation in the joints of the first layer of primary 
austenitic grains. If the quantities of certain impurities are sufficient, embrittlement 
of this grain boundary alignment occurs. Cracking occurs if the mechanical 
characteristics of the filler material allow for the development of sufficiently high 
temperature stresses (Maltrud 1996). 
10.2.5. Reheat cracking 
Reheat cracking is initiated during the PWHT or even in service at elevated 
temperatures. It occurs mainly in boiler steels with low chromium, molybdenum and 
vanadium alloys (Dhooge and Vinckier 1992). But it can also be present in high￾strength steels micro-alloyed with vanadium. 
This cracking results from the fact that carbon, from the carbides that harden 
these alloys, is put back into solution at very high temperatures near the fusion 
boundary and, due to the cooling rate, remains in a free state at the grain boundaries. 
Then, upon reheating, carbides will precipitate within these grain boundaries, 
preventing creep due to stress relaxation and thus leading to cracking. Micro￾alloying elements such as vanadium and niobium used for high-strength steels have 
a deleterious effect on this risk (Vinckier et al. 1996). Elements segregating at grain 
boundaries such as S, P, As, Sb, Cu and Sn promote the risk of cracking (Bonnet 
2001). This sensitivity to cracking can be estimated by the reduction in area 
measured during a hot tensile test, noted RA%. Vinckier et al. have proposed an 
estimate of this necking capacity after a cycle at 1300°C for HSS steels, where the 
negative effects of micro-alloying elements, carbon and arsenic are clearly visible 
(Vinckier et al. 1996):

Chemical compositions are expressed in 10–3% and reheating temperature in K. Weldability of High Strength Steels 323 
Multi-pass welding, which leads to structural refinement as well as welding of 
the coarse-grained heat affected zone, is beneficial in that it restores high￾temperature ductility (Vinckier et al. 1996). 
10.2.6. Liquid metal embrittlement 
Liquid metal embrittlement (LME) is a phenomenon of penetration, at the grain 
boundaries of an alloy, of another metal in the liquid state. This penetration weakens 
the grain boundaries, which can open under the effect of stresses, leading to the 
failure of the material by intergranular fracture (Figure 10.12). 
In the case of steel, the other metal is usually zinc used to coat the steel against 
corrosion. Welds are concerned with LME in two main situations:
– when galvanizing a welded structure, high residual stresses from welding can 
cause local embrittlement leading to failure; 
– during the welding operation of galvanized steel, the thermomechanical 
stresses associated with welding and clamping can cause cracks in the HAZ. 
Figure 10.12. Example of LME crack in HAZ of a welded spot on galvanized steel. 
For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
In both cases, controlling the state of stress (and therefore the risk of 
embrittlement) is complex. The study of this phenomenon is therefore based on hot 
mechanical tests in a liquid zinc environment (hot traction of immersed or 
galvanized specimens). These studies have shown the harmful influence of certain 
alloying elements: 324 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
– In the case of galvanizing a welded structure, the SLM-400 criterion represents 
the applied stress below which there is no failure after 400 s of immersion in zinc (as 
a relative percentage of the stress obtained without immersion), with the tests being 
performed on a simulated HAZ. The statistical formula [10.12] (Abe et al. 1994) 
thus incorporates both the sensitivity of the grade to LME and the propensity to form 
sensitive microstructures in the HAZ: 
SLMିସ଴଴ = 227 − 320 ∙ C − 10 ∙ Si − 76 ∙ Mn − 50 ∙ Cu − 30 ∙ Ni − 92 ∙
Cr − 88 ∙ Mo − 220 ∙ V − 200 ∙ Nb + 200 ∙ Ti [10.12] 
where the SLM-400 criterion and the different alloying levels are expressed in 
percentage. 
– During welding (including resistance welding or copper brazing) of thin sheets 
of third-generation ultra-high-strength steels for automotive bodies, silicon has been 
identified as a major factor aggravating the occurrence of LME cracks in the HAZ 
(Tumuluru 2019) without a consensus explanation of the underlying mechanisms 
yet. 
10.3. Solutions for a good weldability of high-strength steels 
The aim here is to summarize the various possible recommendations for welding 
high-strength steels, which can sometimes appear contradictory depending on the 
property targeted for the weld. This approach will be followed through two 
fundamental choices for the welder (choice of filler metal and choice of heat 
treatment after welding) and completed by a discussion on the possibilities of 
designing weldable high-strength steels. 
10.3.1. Filler metals 
The optimization of the mechanical properties of the FZ is a prerequisite to 
ensure the integrity of a welded joint. First of all, we recall that the mechanical 
strength of a weld depends on the mechanical properties of the FZ, but also on its 
length and size, called throat. Thus, when possible, it can be interesting to increase 
one of these parameters to increase the maximum allowable loads for the weld. For 
example, it is possible to increase the throat or the length of a fillet weld, or the 
number of spots in resistance welding. 
In the case of butt welds and if a filler material is required, in most cases a 
matching filler material should be chosen, that is, one with the same or slightly 
better mechanical properties than the base metal. Because of the aforementioned Weldability of High Strength Steels 325 
risks of cracking in the FZ, overmatching products with a very high CEIIW compared 
to the base metal should be avoided. Note that the mechanical properties to be 
considered must also take into account all the post-welding operations that the 
assembly will undergo and that could reduce the mechanical properties, such as heat 
treatments. 
To limit the risk of cracking, it is possible to use different filler materials to 
make the first passes of a thick joint. These are indeed the most sensitive because of 
the natural notch effect generated by the root of the weld and the high levels of 
residual stresses on a smaller section. It is therefore possible to use: 
– Undermatching steel filler metals, thus having a lower carbon equivalent, but 
limiting this use to the first few passes in order to avoid obtaining a FZ with poor 
overall mechanical properties. The risk is mainly present at the root level where the 
notch effect and the shrinkage stresses are important. 
– Austenitic fillers, which will trap the hydrogen in a FZ not sensitive to cold 
cracking due to the high solubility limit of hydrogen in this microstructure. 
However, it will then be necessary to consider the risks of hot cracking of the FZ by 
using for example a Schaeffler diagram while taking into account the dilution in the 
FZ. Thus, filler materials of type 23 12L or 29 9 are often used. 
10.3.2. Post-weld heat treatments 
Heat treatment after welding is generally performed with two objectives: to 
improve the properties of the raw weld areas by a softening effect and/or to achieve 
a relaxation of the residual stresses. 
10.3.2.1. Softening 
In the example of spot-welded high-strength steels in the automotive industry, 
the most critical property of the weld is related to the brittleness of the martensite 
formed in the molten nugget when stressed in opening mode; indeed, the carbon 
contents of these steels (0.2 or even 0.3% or more) result in martensite hardnesses of 
500, 600 HV, and so on. 
A first positive effect is brought naturally, without additional cost, by the low￾temperature heat treatment (classically 170°C for 20 min) undergone by the whole 
structure during the paint baking, and which in some cases allows a low-temperature 
tempering sufficient to slightly soften the martensite and significantly improve the 
resistance of the spot welds in opening mode (cross-tension, peeling) (Ghassemi￾Armaki et al. 2018). 326 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
For the highest carbon grades, however, this may not be sufficient, and a true 
martensite softening treatment, much shorter but at higher temperatures, can be 
performed. Considering the speed of the automotive industry, an in situ treatment is 
preferred, which consists of re-heating the weld by a new passage of current brought 
by the welding electrodes. The delicate adjustments are the quenching time between 
welding and tempering (the microstructure must be completely quenched into 
martensite before it can be tempered), and the intensity of the tempering current (as 
the heating is not homogeneous in the weld, tempering temperatures of about 
600–700°C should be reached at the weld edge, without exceeding this limit to avoid 
any reaustenitizing of the zone and losing all benefit) (Dupuy et al. 2014). It can be 
noted that the tensile-shear strength can sometimes suffer slightly from this 
tempering, but the level remains largely high enough and the trade-off with the 
opening strength remains favorable to the tempering treatment (Figure 10.13). 
Figure 10.13. Mechanical tensile strength in cross-section of raw 
welded points or after heat treatment. For a color version of 
this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
10.3.2.2. Relaxation 
Relaxation heat treatment (or stress relief tempering) relies on the yield strength 
being exceeded upon heating as well as the creep of the material as a function of 
temperature and time. This influence of creep is such that, generally, the Hollomon–
Jaffe parameter used to evaluate the effectiveness of the heat treatment is identical to Weldability of High Strength Steels 327 
that used to characterize the creep behavior of a material (David et al. 1965; Michel 
2007): 
𝐻=𝑇× ሾ20 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑡)ሿ × 10ିଷ [10.13] 
where T is the dwell temperature in Kelvin, and t is the dwell time in hours. 
The relaxation is completed as soon as the holding time at the maximum 
temperature begins. As a first approximation, the percentage of relaxation is a 
function of the maximum temperature reached. 
However, PWHT generally leads to a loss of mechanical properties (tensile 
properties, impact strength) (FD A 36-200: 1982) (NF EN 13445-4 V3:2014). On 
the other hand, it can improve the toughness values (CTOD) at the welded joint 
although it generates a loss of Charpy-V impact strength due to the decrease of the 
residual stress level. 
The temperature is, with some exceptions, lower than the temperature of the heat 
treatment the steel undergoes during its production. A temperature of 25–50°C 
below this temperature with optimum duration avoids any reduction in mechanical 
properties. To avoid the risk of cracking on reheating in the case of micro-alloyed 
grades, the temperature chosen should be below the secondary precipitation of 
carbides (vanadium or niobium). 
The cooling rate during PWHT has an influence both on the loss of impact 
strength by embrittlement in the case of a too slow rate, but also on the residual 
stresses in the case of a too fast rate. 
10.3.3. Design of a weldable high-strength steel 
In spite of the difficulties of weldability described above, given the high alloying 
levels of high-strength steels, it is possible in some cases to make choices favorable 
to weldability during the design of the steel. 
10.3.3.1. Carbon equivalent 
The concept of carbon equivalent (see section 10.2.3), with the requests of the 
users for a limitation of this one so as to keep an optimal weldability with respect to 
cold cracking, resulted in a modification of the chemical compositions by the steel 
manufacturers. Thus, the requirement of a carbon equivalent CEV (equation [10.6]) 
limited to 0.40 or 0.42 has led to limit the content of carbon and alloying elements, 
and prefer the cooling rate after austenitization, so as to obtain very resistant 328 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
martensitic and/or bainitic structures. Thus, from a yield strength of 460 MPa, 
grades delivered in the quenched and tempered condition are preferred. This 
hardening can be carried out in the traditional way by reheating the plate in a 
furnace, but also by direct quenching (DQ) immediately after rolling. In addition, for 
beams, interrupted quenching can be used, leading to self-tempering through the 
heat remaining in the core of the product (quenching and self-tempering [QST]). 
A second development in sheet materials has been the use of thermomechanical 
rolling. This rolling method relies not only on increasing the properties by adding 
hardening elements, but also on the effect of a decrease in grain size (Hall–Petch 
law). This allows a strong decrease in the carbon content, and thus a limitation of the 
carbon equivalent index (Figure 10.14). 
Figure 10.14. Relationship between CEV carbon equivalent and 
material yield strength as a function of processing method. For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/goune/newsteels.zip 
Beyond the carbon equivalent, the carbon content also plays an important role in 
the risk of cold cracking. A carbon content below 0.08% generally leads to a low 
sensitivity to cold cracking. With this in mind, American steelmakers have defined 
high-strength low alloy (HSLA) steels for military applications, based on an 
application of the Graville diagram (see Figure 10.7). These grades are located in 
zone I of the diagram. The mechanical properties are obtained on the basis of the 
aging principle of a nickel-copper structure (NiCu Aged steel).Weldability of High Strength Steels 329 
It should be noted that, as the CEV carbon equivalent does not include all the 
elements leading to increased hardenability, new indices have been proposed in 
order to better take into account the effects of alloying elements for low carbon 
contents as well as the addition of micro-alloying elements such as boron or niobium 
not taken into account in the CEV: pcm index as well as CEN (Ito and Bessyo 1968; 
Yurioka et al. 1983). 
10.3.3.2. Compromise for car bodies 
To ensure the crash properties of car bodies, two main families of high-strength 
steels have been developed: 
– steels for cold stamping, of which the most advanced are those of the third 
generation (better compromise between UTS and drawability); 
– steels for hot stamping, which allow an even higher UTS to be reached. 
The choice between these two families depends on many properties (drawability, 
cost, corrosion, etc.) described in the other chapters, but their weldability (especially 
spot welding, the most common process in the automotive industry) also differs: 
– some problems are common to them, in particular the brittleness of the welds 
under opening stress due to the high level of alloying, which may require heat 
treatments (see above); 
– third-generation cold-stampable steels are generally more susceptible to 
embrittlement by liquid metals, although the most recent ones can limit this defect 
by limiting the silicon content and/or incorporating a less sensitive surface layer; 
depending on the applications and knowledge of the low impact of the cracks 
created (Benlatreche et al. 2017), the choice of these materials may be accepted; 
– the surface of hot-stamped steels is generally partially oxidized; depending on 
the nature of the initial coating and the control of the thermal treatment cycle, this 
surface condition may create some difficulties in terms of operative weldability (less 
robust weldability range), which are to be compared with the wear of the electrodes 
caused by the zinc for cold-stampable steels. 
It can be seen that, overall, none of these welding difficulties is prohibitive, since 
both families are widely used, but weldability issues may lead to one or the other 
choice depending on the welding possibilities of each car manufacturer. 330 New Advanced High Strength Steels

A.1. Introduction 
Steels, defined as iron alloyed with carbon in mass fraction ranging from a few 
parts per million (ppm) to 2%, bring together most metallurgical mechanisms, such 
as the presence of atoms in substitutional or interstitial solid solutions, the 
precipitation of carbides, nitrides and intermetallics, and the solid-state phase 
transformation. The development of different steel grades exploits this richness by 
combining chemical composition and thermomechanical treatments.
This appendix recalls the main constituents of steels and summarizes the 
hardening mechanisms and the main families of steels developed over the last 
decades. Without being exhaustive, it helps the understanding of the different 
chapters of this book. To go further, the reader can refer to the books and articles 
cited at the end of the Appendix (section A.6.2).
A.2. Constituents of steels 
Pure iron presents two allotropic varieties depending on the temperature: ferrite 
at low and very high temperatures and austenite at intermediate temperatures. These 
two equilibrium phases are also found in steels, their range of existence being a 334 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
function of temperature and composition as shown in the equilibrium (Figure A.1). 
The addition of specific alloying elements can promote the precipitation of a second 
phase. Finally, after very rapid cooling, constituents out of thermodynamic 
equilibrium can form at room temperature, the stability of which depends mainly on 
the composition. 
The following sections present the main characteristics of the constituents of the 
steels before describing their impact on the hardening. 
Figure A.1. Iron–carbon equilibrium diagram for the iron-rich part 
A.2.1. Equilibrium constituents 
Ferrite, or α iron, with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, is the stable phase of 
pure iron at room temperature and up to 910°C (Figure A.1). At room temperature, it 
represents the main phase of steels with less than 0.3 wt% carbon1
 after slow cooling. 
In pure iron and in steels with a very low carbon content, the bcc phase is also 
found at very high temperatures in equilibrium with the liquid phase. This phase, 
called δ phase, does not play a specific role in the properties of solid steel except in 
some austenitic stainless steels, where it remains in the form of metastable islands. 
1 In the following, the content of alloying elements is always given in weight percentage without 
this being expressly stated. Appendix 335 
Chromium addition significantly increases the domain of existence of ferrite. 
Thus, stainless steels with 17 wt% chromium are ferritic at any temperature if the 
carbon content is low enough. 
Between 910°C and 1450°C, pure iron has a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure 
(Figure A.1). This phase is called austenite or γ iron. At high temperatures, it is the 
main constituent of carbon and low-alloy steels. Its range of existence depends on 
the addition elements. The gamma-phase promoting elements (Ni, Mn, etc.) stabilize 
austenite, while the alpha-phase promoting elements (Si, Al, Mo, etc.) reduce the 
size of the austenitic domain. Thus, it is possible to obtain austenite at room 
temperature, in a stable or metastable state, by increasing the content of austenite￾former alloying elements. This is the case of the austenitic stainless steels derived 
from the Fe-18%Cr-8%Ni grade. 
Iron carbide, Fe3C, called cementite, is an equilibrium phase present in the iron￾rich part of the Fe-C diagram (Figure A.1). During continuous cooling it can appear 
in steels with a carbon content below the maximum solubility limit of carbon in 
ferrite at 727°C (of the order of 0.022 wt% in the Fe-C binary). In this case, 
cementite appears as precipitates located mainly at the ferritic grain boundaries. For 
higher carbon contents, cementite results from the eutectoid reaction: 
γ iron Fe3C + α iron 
Figure A.2. Scanning electron microscopy micrograph of a pearlitic 
microstructure in a 0.8 wt% carbon steel. The ferrite 
appears dark and the cementite light (MSSMat) 
Under equilibrium and for unalloyed steels, this reaction takes place at 727°C 
and for a carbon content in the austenite of 0.77 wt% (Figure A.1). The aggregate, 
product of this transformation, is present in the form of alternating ferrite and 
cementite lamellae (Figure A.2), commonly called pearlite. This morphology results 
from kinetic and diffusional processes. Given some heat treatments, the cementite 336 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
lamellae can evolve toward a more stable microstructure by forming spherical 
particles giving rise to a spheroidized or globulized pearlite.
A.2.2. Non-equilibrium constituents 
The ferrite/austenite transformation is diffusive in nature, controlled by the 
diffusion of carbon and alloying elements. Generally, when the cooling rate 
increases, the kinetics of ferrite formation is slowed down. There is a critical speed 
for which the diffusion has no more time to operate and the transformation from a 
face-centered cubic structure to a body-centered cubic (or tetragonal) structure 
results from a mechanism of coordinated displacement of the atoms. This displacive 
transformation is accompanied by important internal constraints and leads to a 
carbon supersaturation of the final phase. One thus obtains non-equilibrium 
constituents such as martensite and bainite (Figure A.3). 
Figure A.3. Schematic representation of a continuous cooling transformation (CCT) 
diagram for a 0.8% C steel. The red curve represents the cooling curve from 
austenite (temperature above Ac1). The green curves represent the beginning and 
end of transformation, the blue dashed curve giving the location of 50% transformed 
austenite. In general, the CCT curves are completed by hardness data of the alloy as 
a function of cooling schedule (40 HRC Rockwell hardness in the example) 
Martensite, sometimes called α′, has a centered tetragonal structure derived from 
the body-centered cubic structure of ferrite. Its formation starts below a critical 
temperature called Ms, depending on the composition of the alloy (Figure A.3). Appendix 337 
Different formulas are proposed in the literature for the evaluation of Ms; as an 
example, equation [A.1] was proposed by (van Bohemen 2012): 
𝑀𝑠ሺin °Cሻ = 565 − 600 ൫1 − expሺ−0.96ሾCሿሻ൯ − 31ሾMnሿ − 13ሾSiሿ −
12ሾMoሿ − 10ሾCrሿ − 8ሾNiሿ [A.1] 
where [X] is the content of element X, expressed in wt%. Various formulas from the 
literature, along with their range of validity, can be found in the review article by Li 
et al. (2021). 
The transformation continues as the temperature decreases. Contrary to the 
diffusive transformations, at a given temperature, the fraction of formed martensite 
does not evolve with the holding time. It is only a function of the end temperature of 
cooling. As shown in equation [A.1], most of the alloying elements, in particular 
carbon, lower the Ms temperature and reduce the critical cooling rate above which a
fully martensitic microstructure is obtained. 
Two martensite morphologies exist depending on the steel composition. Lath 
martensite is typical of stainless steels and carbon steels with less than 0.5 wt% 
carbon (Figure A.4a). The second form, plate martensite, appears in steels with a 
carbon content above 0.35% and becomes the unique morphology when the carbon 
content exceeds 0.6%. 
a) b) 
Figure A.4. Microstructures: (a) martensite; 
(b) bainite (optical microscopy after etching) 
A constituent called bainite (Figure A.4b) can form for cooling rates below the 
rates of martensite formation and above the rates of formation of a ferrite-pearlite 
microstructure. This constituent is a mixture of dislocation-rich ferrite and 
cementite. Depending on the carbon content and the cooling rate, different 338 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
morphologies appear. For the slowest cooling rates, the transformation takes place at 
relatively high temperature and leads to a upper bainite in which cementite 
precipitates along the ferrite lath boundaries. At faster cooling rates, lower bainite is 
formed. In this case, the cementite precipitates inside the laths in the form of needles 
or fine platelets. Finally, for steels with a very low carbon content, the bainite 
morphology takes the form of irregular ferrite grains with fine cementite particles: 
granular bainite. 
A.2.3. Minority constituents 
The addition of chemical elements in steel can lead, depending on the adapted 
thermal or thermomechanical treatments, to the formation of inter- or intragranular 
precipitates. The most common precipitates are formed from so-called carbide￾forming elements, which have a strong affinity for carbon and nitrogen. These are 
often transition metals (Ti, Nb, V, Cr, Mo) precipitating in the form of carbides, 
nitrides or carbonitrides (Goldschmidt 1967). By abuse of language, since these 
precipitates are formed from elements in interstitial solid solution, carbon and 
nitrogen, they are commonly called interstitial compounds. These compounds 
describe a continuous family of solid solutions containing both carbon and nitrogen, 
and, most often, a mixture of the various elements in addition. They are noted in a 
generic way Mx(C,N)y. The solubility limit of the interstitial compounds in the 
austenite decreases with decreasing temperature (Figure A.5). This dependence is 
expressed with good accuracy in the following form: 
𝑙𝑜𝑔ሺሾ𝑀ሿ௫ሾ𝑋ሿ௬ሻ =𝐴 𝑇⁄ + 𝐵 [A.2] 
where [X] and [M] are the carbon and/or nitrogen content and the content of the
carbide-forming element, respectively, T is the temperature and A and B are 
constants dependent on the addition elements M and X. 
The solubility of the alloyed carbides/nitrides in austenite decreases inversely 
with the chemical stability of the corresponding carbides/nitrides. 
Similar relationships exist for ferrite, but, practically, the solubility of 
carbonitrides can be considered as zero below 700°C. 
In addition to carbonitrides, there are a large number of intermetallic phases that 
can be found, as described for instance in Westbrook (1967) or Vilars and Calvert 
(1991). Because of the complexity of their crystal structure, the precipitation 
kinetics are often very slow. Thus, they usually appear only during the lifetime when 
the components are operating at high temperature. They usually result in a coarse Appendix 339 
precipitation, which does not contribute to the alloy hardening. However, they can 
have a negative impact on toughness due to their size. One exception is the 
compounds β′ (NiAl) and γ′ (Ni3Ti and Ni3Al), which contribute to the structural 
hardening of high-alloy steels.

delineate the phase transition of the steel (based on Vilars and Calvert 1991) 
A.3. Deformation and hardening mechanisms 
A.3.1. Deformation mechanisms 
In order to understand the hardening mechanisms of steels, it must be first 
looked at the different modes of deformation. Indeed, hardening results from the 
different restrictions imposed on these deformation mechanisms.
A.3.1.1. Deformation by dislocations glide 
The most common deformation mode in crystals is dislocation slip. 
A dislocation is a linear defect in the crystal structure, defined by a Burgers 
vector 𝑏ሬ⃗ and a dislocation line direction 𝑙
⃗ (Hull and Bacon 2011; Schmitt and Iung 
2016). The vectors 𝑏ሬ⃗ and 𝑙
⃗ define the slip plane; the normal 𝑛ሬ⃗ to the slip plane and 
the Burgers vector define the slip system. 
In the face-centered cubic structure, such as austenite, the slip systems are of the 
{111}<110> type. For the body-centered cubic structure, such as ferrite, they are of 
the type {110}<111> and {112}<111>. 340 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Figure A.6. Definition of the angles for the Schmid factor in tension 
Irreversible plastic deformation occurs when the shear stress on the slip plane 
reaches a critical value, τc, called critical shear stress. Thus, during a tensile test, 
yield stress is reached when the projection of the tensile stress σ on the slip plane 
parallel to the Burgers vector is equal to the critical shear stress: 
𝜏 = ሺcos 𝜙 cos 𝜆ሻ𝜎=𝜏௖ [A.3] 
where φ is the angle between the tensile direction and the normal to the slip plane 
and λ is the angle between the tensile direction and the Burgers vector (Figure A.6). 
The term in parentheses in equation [A.3], called the Schmid factor, is at most 0.5. 
When the yield point is reached, the dislocations move on their slip plane and 
multiply (e.g. by the Frank–Read mechanism, see Schmitt and Iung 2016 and 
section A.3.2.4). This results in plastic strain expressed as: 
𝛾 = 𝜌𝑏𝑙̅ [A.4] 
γ is the shear strain induced on the slip plane parallel to the Burgers vector 𝑏ሬ⃗. ρ is 
the dislocation density that corresponds to the total dislocation line length per unit 
volume and is expressed in m·m–3. This density is of the order of 1010 m·m–3 in 
annealed metals and can reach 1014 to 1016 m·m–3 after straining. b is the norm of the 
Burgers vector and 𝑙̅ is the mean free path of the dislocations, that is, the average 
distance swept between two obstacles. 
In a pure crystal, the only force opposing the dislocation glide is the lattice force, 
called Peierls force, due to the binding energy between atoms. The addition of 
elements in solid solution modifies this lattice force and contributes to the hardening 
of the alloy as seen later (section A.3.2.2). Appendix 341 
A.3.1.2. Deformation by twinning 
In materials with a face-centered cubic structure, deformation can occur by a 
collective displacement of atoms parallel to an atomic plane and along a given 
crystallographic direction. This mechanism is called twinning. The result is a twin 
boundary, which is a boundary between two crystalline entities with a particular 
orientation relationship to each other (Figure A.7). In face-centered cubic structures, 
the twin planes are the {111} planes and the twin directions are the <112> directions. 
In general, the growth of a twin is very fast and it crosses the whole grain. In 
some alloys, in particular some austenitic stainless steels, twins can result from the 
successive stacking of partial dislocations. In all cases, the twin boundaries represent 
strong obstacles to the dislocation glide and thus contribute to the hardening of the 
alloy concerned. 
Figure A.7. Diagram of the formation of a mechanical 
twin in a face-centererd cubic structure 
A.3.1.3. Martensitic transformation induced by deformation 
At temperatures above Ms, austenite is unstable and can transform under the 
effect of deformation. This transformation induced by deformation is called 
transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP). The austenite stability is frequently 
defined by the temperature Md30, corresponding to the temperature at which 50% of 
the austenite has transformed into martensite after 30% deformation (Nohara et al. 
1977; more recently Izawa 2019). This temperature depends on the composition of 
the austenite and is a few tens to a few hundred degrees higher than Ms. 
In 18%Cr-10%Ni austenitic stainless steels, the formation of α′ martensite is 
preceded by the appearance of a martensite with a hexagonal structure, ε martensite 
(Thomas and Henry 1990; Schmitt and Iung 2016). ε martensite has a fine platelet 
morphology running through the entire grain. α′ martensite nuclei then develop from 
the intersections of two ε martensite platelets. 342 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
A.3.1.4. In summary 
Perfect dislocations, especially in face-centered cubic materials, can dissociate 
into two dislocations separated by a stacking fault. An equilibrium is established 
between the repulsion energy of the two partial dislocations and the energy required 
to form the stacking fault, leading to an equilibrium distance. The stacking fault 
energy (SFE) is a function of the alloy composition, for example, for an austenitic 
stainless steel (Pickering 1984): 
SFE (mJ·m–2) = 25.7 + 410 [C] + 2 [Ni] – 77 [N] – 
13 [Si] – 1.2 [Mn] – 0.9 [Cr] [A.5] 
where [X] is the element content. 
When the SFE is high, above 40 mJ·m–2, the dislocations cannot dissociate. They 
move mainly on their slip plane and can eventually change direction by a 
mechanism called cross-slip. 
Figure A.8. Iso-SFE curves as a function of carbon and manganese content 
for TWIP Mn-C steels and limits of the deformation and transformation 
domains (after Allain 2004; De Cooman et al. 2018) 
When the SFE is lower, of the order of 30 mJ·m–2, the dislocations are 
dissociated. The dislocation glide is planar, because it is very difficult for the 
dislocation to change plane by cross-slip. When the SFE becomes lower (less than 
30 mJ·m–2), the stacking faults become very large. Partial dislocations sliding on 
parallel {111} planes then lead to the formation of platelets in crystallographic twin Appendix 343 
relationship with the surrounding matrix. During deformation, parallel twins develop 
within the grains. 
Finally, if the partial dislocations glide on every other {111} plane (for an SFE 
value lower than about 20 mJ·m–2), they lead to the formation of ε martensite 
platelets, precursors of α′ martensite. It can thus be seen that, as a function of the 
SFE, deformation progressively evolves from dislocation slip to induced martensitic 
transformation by way of twinning, as summarized in the diagram of Figure A.8 for 
a TWIP Mn-C steel (section A.4.2.1). 
A.3.2. Hardening mechanisms 
A.3.2.1. Hardening by grain size effect 
Since the movement of dislocations takes place mainly on a slip plane, a grain 
boundary represents a discontinuity. The mobile dislocations within a grain are 
stopped by the grain boundary. The piling of dislocations creates a stress 
concentration in the neighboring grain, which then triggers the dislocation glide in 
this grain. A reasonable assumption is that the length of the dislocation pile-up is 
proportional to the grain size. On other hand, it can be shown that the effective stress 
is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the pile-up length (Schmitt and 
Iung 2016). Thus, in general, the effect of grain size D on the yield stress σe is 
written as: 
𝜎௘ = 𝜎଴ + ௞
√஽ [A.6] 
where σ0 and k are material parameters, σ0 being very close to the stress due to 
lattice friction. In low carbon ferritic steels (<0.1%), σ0 is of the order of 100 MPa 
and k is estimated to be 20 MPa·mm–1/2. Equation [A.6] is known as the Hall–Petch 
relationship. A limit to hardening appears for grain sizes smaller than a micrometer 
(Masumara et al. 1998), for which the grain size hardening seems less efficient. 
Grain size can easily be controlled by deformation-recrystallization cycles 
(section A.3.2.5). It is therefore possible to vary the yield stress of a steel without 
varying its chemical composition. Thus, the yield stress of a low-carbon steel can 
reach 300 MPa for a grain size of 10 µm, which is twice the yield stress of the same 
steel with a grain size of about 30 µm. 
A.3.2.2. Solid solution hardening 
The addition of elements in solid solution locally modifies the interaction 
energies between atoms, which has a direct effect on lattice friction. Depending on 344 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
their size and electronic affinity, these atoms can form a substitutional solid solution 
or an interstitial solid solution. In the substitutional solid solution, the solute atoms 
replace the matrix atoms on the crystal sites of the base metal. This is the case for 
Mn, Si, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cr, for example, in steels. In most cases, this leads to an 
increase in the yield stress (Figure A.8). 
In the interstitial solid solution, solute atoms, generally much smaller than iron 
atoms, are placed in the interstitial sites of the crystal lattice. Carbon and nitrogen 
form interstitial solid solutions in steels. The hardening effect is much greater, on 
the order of 300 MPa for 0.1 wt% carbon, for example. 
Figure A.9. Hardening effect of solute atoms 
in ferritic steel (based on Pickering 1978) 
The interaction between dislocations and solute atoms is complex to predict, 
because it involves the binding energies between atoms, which depend strongly on 
the position of the solutes in the matrix. Simple models have been proposed in the 
literature and are now complemented by molecular dynamics simulations, for 
example. Most of these approaches lead to the following relation (Nabarro 1977): 
𝜎௦௦ = 𝐶ሾ𝑋ሿ௡ [A.7] 
where σss is the hardening due to the solid solution, [X] is the content of the addition 
element and C is a material constant. The exponent n is between 0.5 and 1. This 
value depends mainly on the concentration of the solid solution and the pinning 
force of the solute atoms. For low alloying element contents, it is usual to take n 
equal to 1 (Figure A.9). This is generally the case for low- and medium-alloyed 
steels, for which the total content of the alloying elements rarely exceeds 3 to 
5 wt%. Appendix 345 
In some cases, the affinity between solute and matrix atoms can lead to an 
ordered solution. Substitutional atoms distribute themselves periodically over the 
crystal sites. The hardening effect is then more important, because the dislocation 
slip creates a loss of periodicity. This case can be encountered in iron-chromium 
solutions, for quite high Cr contents. 
Figure A.10. (a) Schematic example of the Lüders plateau on a tensile curve for a 
very low carbon steel. The upper yield stress corresponds to the force required to 
unpin the dislocations from carbon atoms; (b) optical macrograph of a tensile 
specimen exhibiting Piobert-Lüders bands (IRSID photograph) 
Diffusion mechanisms can lead to a mobility of atoms in solid solution. This 
phenomenon is amplified by high temperatures, but it is already felt at room 
temperature for atoms inserted in steel. In order to reduce the binding energies, the 
atoms tend to gather around defects, in particular dislocations. They form volumes 
with a high solute content, the Cottrell atmospheres, which strongly pin the 
dislocations. It is necessary to apply a high stress on the dislocations to set them in 
motion. However, the mobility of the atoms remains low compared to the speed of 
the dislocations, which can then move under a lower stress. This mechanism leads to 
a stress plateau on the tensile curve of ferritic steels (Figure A.10). The plateau 
corresponds to the passage of localized deformation bands all along the specimen 
length: the Piobert-Lüders bands. The phenomenon appears for carbon contents in 
solid solution of the order of and above 10 ppm by weight. 
If the mobility of the atoms is greater, Cottrell atmospheres can reform around 
the dislocations when they are temporarily stopped on other obstacles. This results 
in a succession of pinning/unpinning of the dislocations leading to numerous 
serrations on the stress-strain curve in tension (Figure A.11). This mechanism, called 
Portevin–Le Chatelier (PLC), or dynamic aging, appears in a given range of 
temperature and strain rate, depending on the chemical composition of the alloy. It is 346 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
sensitive in the vicinity of 200–400°C for steels with a medium carbon content 
(0.2–0.3 wt%), mainly due to the diffusion of carbon atoms. It is also found during 
plastic deformation at room temperature of high-manganese austenitic alloys 
(Fe-22Mn-0.6C, second-generation steel (section A.4.2.2), room temperature curve 
in Figure A.11 – blue arrow). The deformation is then localized within deformation 
bands along the specimen. In practice, such deformation conditions are avoided, 
because, even if these localizations do not present mechanical weaknesses, they can 
generate marks on the surface of the parts.

austenitic Fe-22Mn-0.6C grade (after Scott et al. 2006) 
A.3.2.3. Precipitation hardening 
Under certain conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, the alloying elements 
can form defined compounds either with the atoms of the matrix or with other 
addition elements. These precipitates appear at the grain boundaries – intergranular 
precipitation – or inside the grains – intragranular precipitation. In this last case, 
the precipitates can be coherent with the matrix, that is, there is continuity of the 
crystal planes and directions between the precipitates and the matrix, only the 
composition of the two phases differs. Most often, especially if the precipitate 
diameter exceeds a few tens of nanometers, the precipitates are non-coherent. The 
crystal structures are different in the precipitate and in the matrix, and there is no 
crystal continuity. Finally, some intermediate cases exist leading to a semi-coherent 
precipitate. 
When a dislocation, moving on a slip plane of the matrix, encounters the 
interface of a coherent precipitate, it can continue its slip on a crystal plane of the Appendix 347 
precipitate. A step of length b is created at the intersection between the slip plane 
and the precipitate (Figure A.12a). This results in an increase in the surface energy 
of the precipitate, contributing to hardening. Thus, the hardening effect of a coherent 
precipitate is greater the larger the size of the precipitate and its volume fraction: 
𝜎௖௜௦ = 𝐾௖௜௦

where Kcis is a constant, b is the norm of the Burgers vector, γp is the energy of the 
precipitate/matrix interface per unit area, Dp is the average diameter of the 
precipitates and fv is their volume fraction. Note that the passage of dislocations
through the precipitate progressively reduces its diameter in the slip plane. It is then 
possible to reach the critical diameter of the precipitate leading to its dissolution. 
The consequence will be a localized softening in the slip bands. 
a) 
b) 
Figure A.12. Mechanisms of interaction between a precipitate 
and a dislocation gliding on its slip plane: (a) by particle shearing 
and (b) bowing around particles (Orowan mechanism) 
In the case of incoherent precipitates, the dislocations are stopped at the 
precipitate interface. It is then necessary to increase the applied stress so as to bend 
the dislocation line between two neighboring precipitates (Figure A.12b). When the 
dislocation segment forms a semicircle, the process becomes unstable, the 
dislocation reforms beyond the precipitate leaving a dislocation loop around it. 
Thus, the hardening obtained is proportional to the average distance between 
precipitates in the slip plane: 
𝜎௖௢ = 𝐾௖௢

where Kco is a constant, µ is the shear modulus, b is the norm of the Burgers vector, 
fv is the precipitate volume fraction and Ds is the average diameter in the slip plane. 
Thus, by combining equations [A.8] and [A.9], it is possible to determine an 
optimal precipitate size at constant volume fraction to obtain a maximum 
precipitation hardening (Figure A.13). This optimization is, for example, 
implemented during the heat treatment of maraging steels of the Fe-18Ni-8Co type. 
Hardening is ensured by the precipitation of fine intermetallic particles 
(Suzuki1974), coherent with the matrix and smaller than 10 nm for short annealing 
times at low temperature, then by a coarser and incoherent precipitation at higher 
temperature. Thus, there is a gradual shift from a shearing mechanism to a bypass 
mechanism. 
Figure A.13. Precipitation hardening and determination of the maximum stress 
(peak hardening) at the intersection of the two hardening mechanisms 
A.3.2.4. Work-hardening 
The mechanisms described in the previous sections increase the yield stress of 
steels. Their influence on the subsequent strain hardening depends very much on the 
deformation mechanism, but, in general, the stress increase can be considered as 
constant throughout the tensile test: the yield stress and the ultimate tensile stress are 
increased by the same Δσ. 
It is also possible to increase the material hardness by strain. For example, a 
tensile specimen machined from cold-rolled sheet metal, not annealed, has a higher 
yield stress than the original material. This work hardening mechanism is widely 
used to increase the mechanical strength of steel cord. In this case, the work 
hardening is obtained by cold drawing. Wire with an initial strength (UTS) of about 
1200 MPa can thus reach a strength of over 3000 MPa for a cross-section reduction Appendix 349 
of 80% (Figure A.14). This significant work hardening is achieved by a combination 
of dislocation hardening of the ferrite and an interaction between the dislocations 
and the cementite lamellae. In the remainder of this section, we will focus on the 
dislocation hardening mechanism. 
Figure A.14. Hardening of mild and pearlitic steels by wire drawing 
Figure A.15. Mechanism of dislocation multiplication by Frank–Read source 
When a dislocation moves on its slip plane, it may encounter obstacles that pin 
it. To continue the deformation, it is then necessary to increase the applied stress in 
order to unpin the dislocation from these obstacles. One of the most studied 350 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
mechanisms is the activation of Frank–Read sources. Let us imagine a dislocation 
segment pinned at two points A and B (Figure A.15), under the combined effect of 
an applied stress σ and the line tension of the dislocation, it bends progressively
between points A and B until it reaches the shape of a semicircle of diameter AB. It 
is shown that there is a relationship between the shear stress on the slip plane τ
(equation [A.3]) and the radius of curvature R of the dislocation segment (Hull and 
Bacon 2011): 
𝜏 = ఓ௕
ଶோ [A.10] 
The shear stress is maximal when R is equal to l/2, the half distance between A 
and B (Figure A.15). This first critical τmax value is used to determine the 
microscopic yield stress (section A.3.1.1). 
As the dislocation remains pinned at points A and B, its further movement can 
only be done with an increasing value of R (Figure A.15). It is possible to show that 
the two segments 1 and 2 are of opposite sign and can annihilate each other. The 
result is a dislocation loop that continues to grow and carries the plastic strain, and a 
new dislocation segment AB that will allow the previous process to reproduce itself. 
Thus, the plastic deformation leads to an increase in the density of dislocations 
clearly visible on this figure. 
Very shortly after the yield point, several slip systems are simultaneously active 
within the grains. Thus, each slip plane of a system is crossed by dislocations 
belonging to other systems (Figure A.16). 
When a mobile dislocation meets a dislocation crossing the slip plane, the two 
dislocations interact, which leads to a pinning of the mobile dislocation on the 
obstacle dislocation, called forest dislocation. This interaction, coupled with the 
multiplication of dislocations, induces strain hardening during plastic deformation. 
Between two dislocations crossing the slip plane, the mobile dislocation bends under 
the effect of the applied stress as we have seen previously. When the shear stress on 
the slip plane is such that the dislocation segment forms a semicircle between the 
two forest dislocations, the mobile dislocation unbends and continues to slip until a 
new interaction with another dislocation. Thus, if Λd is the average distance between 
two dislocations crossing the slip plane, the shear stress τd required for passing is 
written as (see equation [A.10]): 
𝜏ௗ = 𝛼 ఓ௕
ஃ೏
 [A.11] Appendix 351 
It can be shown that, if the forest dislocations are randomly distributed through 
the slip plane, the average distance between them is proportional to 𝜌ିଵ ଶ⁄ . Equation 
[A.11] is written as follows: 
𝜏ௗ = 𝛼𝜇𝑏ඥ𝜌 [A.12] 
The deformation mechanism by dislocation can also lead to kinematic strain 
hardening. Indeed, when a dislocation is blocked on a strong obstacle – incoherent 
precipitate, grain boundary, interface between phases, etc. – the other active 
dislocations on the same sliding plane progressively form a pile-up against the 
obstacle as shown in Figure A.17(b) in the context of a grain boundary. 
Figure A.16. Interaction between a mobile dislocation and the 
dislocations crossing the slip plane (forest dislocations) 
Since the dislocations in the pile-up are of the same sign, they tend to repel each 
other. To create the pile-up, it is therefore necessary to increase the applied stress to 
compensate the repulsion forces. It can be shown that at the head of the pile-up (at 
point O on the grain boundary in the example in Figure A.17a), the stress exerted by 
the dislocations is proportional to: 
𝜏௘௠௣ = ଶ௡ఓ௕
ஃ೐೘೛
 [A.13] 
where n is the number of dislocations in the pile-up and Λemp the pile-up length. 
When the applied stress is reversed, for example when tension is followed by 
compression, the stress due to the pile-up makes a positive contribution to the slip 352 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
plane yielding. Thus, if a specimen is deformed in tension up to a stress σt, the yield 
stress in compression after unloading occurs at σc such that: 
𝜎௖ = 𝜎௧ − 𝑀 ଶ௡ఓ௕
ஃ೐೘೛
 [A.14] 
where M is the Taylor factor for calculating the polycrystal yield stress from the 
yield stress of each grain weighted by the crystallographic textures (see Chapters 1 
and 2). The difference between σt and σc represents the so-called Bauschinger effect, 
characteristic of kinematic strain hardening (see Chapter 1).

a grain boundary; (b) example of dislocation pile-up on a grain 
boundary of a weakly deformed steel (after Whelan 1957) 
A.3.2.5. Recrystallization and grain growth 
In most materials, dislocations tend to cluster together to form dislocation cells 
bounded by walls with a high dislocation density (Figure A.18). The cell size is on 
the order of 0.5–1 µm and decreases with increasing strain. As strain increases, the 
total dislocation density tends to saturate by compensation between the storage of 
dislocations in the walls and the annihilation of dislocations of opposite sign due to 
dynamic recovery. This process explains why the strain hardening rate due to 
dislocations, dσ/dε, tends to decrease as deformation proceeds (see details in 
Chapter 1). The limit of uniform deformation in tension is thus reached when the 
strain hardening is equal to the applied stress (Considère criterion): 
ௗఙ
ௗఌ
= 𝜎 [A.15] 
The crystal lattice distortions around a dislocation induce an elastic stress field 
resulting from atom displacements from their equilibrium position near the 
dislocation line. This energy is of the order of (ρµb2
). During a heat treatment after a Appendix 353 
plastic deformation, it is possible to release this energy by a recrystallization 
mechanism. Dislocation-free nuclei then form new grains that grow progressively at 
the expense of the hardened zones. At the end of the recrystallization stage, the 
mechanical properties are again close to those of the material before deformation. 
Figure A.18. Transmission electron microscopy observation of intragranular 
dislocation cells in 8% strain ferritic steel under equibiaxial stretching. 
The electron contrast shows the dislocation walls in dark 
A low deformation or a low annealing temperature does not allow
recrystallization; the material is then annealed. Beyond a critical strain, 
recrystallization enables playing on the size of the grains: an annealing after a very 
important deformation leads to grains of micrometer size. The grain size then 
evolves according to the holding time at high temperature. Thus, a small grain size, 
favorable to Hall–Petch hardening and good toughness behavior (see Chapter 3), is 
obtained after extensive work hardening, for example by rolling or drawing 
(reduction greater than 90%), and short annealing at high temperature. In the case of 
ferritic steels, a compromise must be found between a temperature high enough to 
trigger recrystallization and below the austenite transformation temperature. 
In most steels, nuclei are formed from dislocation cells. They thus inherit their 
crystalline orientation after deformation. The strain energy stored in the grains is a 
function of their orientation. Thus, some orientations are preferred during the 
nucleation and some crystallographic components develop preferentially during the 
recrystallization stage. Grain growth is a function of the disorientations on both 
sides of the grain boundary. Continuing the recrystallization process amplifies the 
development of preferred orientations. It should be noted that a fine precipitation 
can slow down the recrystallization mechanisms and thus modify the evolution 
kinetics of the various crystal orientations. The process parameters, 354 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
thermomechanical and material, are thus adjusted to obtain the most favorable 
textures for the intended final use (see Chapter 2). 
Under certain conditions of hot deformation, recrystallization can occur during 
deformation. This is called dynamic recrystallization. This process occurs during the 
first stages of hot rolling in the roughing mill or in the last stands of the finisher. It 
also allows the refinement of microstructures if the deformed material is cooled 
quickly enough. 
A.4. The main families of steels 
A.4.1. Ferritic matrix steels 
A.4.1.1. Low carbon steels 
In order to achieve high formability, it is necessary to soften the steel as much as 
possible. This limits the volume fraction of alloying elements, and requires a sharp 
reduction of the carbon and nitrogen content by vacuum degassing in the steel mill. 
Thus, ULC (ultra low carbon) steels contain less than 100 ppm by weight of carbon 
and less than 0.3% of manganese. 
To avoid hardening due to carbon in solid solution and suppress the Lüders 
plateau (section A.3.2.2), the residual fraction of carbon can be precipitated by 
adding titanium and/or niobium. These steels are called interstitial free (IF) steels 
indicating that they no longer contain elements in interstitial solid solution. The 
carbon and nitrogen contents being sufficiently low and those of titanium and/or 
niobium being adjusted to obtain a complete precipitation, the precipitation does not 
create significant hardening. These steels are intended for deep drawing. The 
annealing treatment after cold rolling allows a favorable texture to be obtained, 
maximizing the transverse Lankford coefficient with a quasi-isotropy in the sheet 
plane (see Chapter 2). 
An additional hardening can be achieved after deep-drawing by keeping a few 
tens of ppm of carbon in solid solution after annealing and using the paint baking 
operation to diffuse or precipitate carbon onto the dislocations. This aging increases 
the yield stress of the weakly drawn parts by 40–60 MPa, improving the indent 
resistance. This range of steels constitutes the bake hardening steels (BH steels), 
indicating their ability to harden during paint annealing (about 20 min at 170°C). 
Another class of steels with low carbon content reaches a yield stress between 
220 and 280 MPa and an ultimate tensile stress between 400 and 450 MPa. These Appendix 355 
steels are hardened by an addition of elements in solid solution like manganese, 
silicium or phosphorus (interstitial-free high resistance [IFHR]). The resulting 
hardening is comparable to, but lower than, that of carbon. Thermomechanical 
treatments are optimized to avoid phosphorus segregation at the grain boundaries, 
which is a source of brittleness. 
Finally, a fine precipitation of titanium or niobium carbides is possible. The hot 
rolling temperature and the cooling rate are controlled in order to avoid early 
precipitation in the austenite. A fine and regular precipitation (precipitates of the 
order of 10 nm) is obtained during annealing after cold rolling. These micro-alloyed 
dispersoid steels are frequently referred to by the acronym HSLA (high-strength low 
alloy). 
A.4.1.2. Ferritic stainless steels 
Stainless steels contain at least 11 wt% chromium. This element is more 
oxidizable than iron and forms a thin, stable protective oxide layer on the surface. 
The most common grade of ferritic stainless steel contains 17% chromium. 
It is necessary to decrease the carbon content to avoid precipitation of chromium 
carbides, which would lead to local chromium depletion and local corrosion 
sensitization. This phenomenon can be particularly present in heat-affected zone 
after welding. However, the presence of chromium limits the minimum carbon and 
nitrogen contents achievable at the steel mill; 0.05% carbon is a usual limit. The 
trend for several years has therefore been to develop stainless steels containing less 
chromium (between 12 and 14%). 
As for ferritic steels with very low carbon content, it is possible to precipitate 
carbon and nitrogen by a controlled addition of titanium or niobium leading to 
titanium or niobium stabilized stainless steels. This precipitation has also the 
advantage to limit grain growth in the heat-affected zones during welding. 
Ferritic stainless steels can be hardened by precipitation of intermetallics such as 
NiAl or FexNb. The latter are used to develop a 14% chromium grade for the hot 
part of automotive exhaust pipes (Chassagne et al. 2006): Intermetallic precipitation 
slows down creep during high-temperature operation. 
A.4.1.3. Pearlitic steels 
During the slow cooling of a 0.8% carbon steel, the austenite is transformed into 
a fully pearlitic microstructure. This class of steels is mainly used for rails and wires 
which, after cold drawing, form the cables and reinforcements of tires. 356 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
Pearlite is made up of fine ferrite and cementite lamellae. The habit plane 
between ferrite and cementite is defined, so that in a ferrite grain, only a few 
cementite orientations exist. The microstructure is thus composed of pearlite 
colonies that correspond to a defined crystallographic orientation of the ferrite and a 
morphological orientation of the cementite (Figure A.2). The main hardening factor 
is the distance S between two cementite lamellae, a relationship similar to Hall–
Petch for grain size (equation [A.6]). Thus, the yield strength σe is written as (Baird 
1971): 
𝜎௘ = 178 + ଵଶଶ
√ௌ [A.16] 
The interlamellar spacing, S, is expressed in µm. It is possible to decrease S, and 
thus increase the yield strength, by decreasing the transformation temperature. 
However, a too-low temperature can lead to discontinuous cementite lamellae that 
no longer fully play their role as obstacles to ferrite dislocations. In practice, the 
cooling scheme is adjusted so that the transformation occurs at the nose of the CCT 
curve (see Figure A.3). Thus, the yield stress is close to 300 MPa for an 
interlamellar spacing of 1 µm and greater than 560 MPa for a spacing of the order of 
0.1 µm. 
The ferrite can be additionally hardened by the precipitation of fine carbides, 
mainly by vanadium addition to avoid precipitation in the austenite and interaction 
between precipitation and phase transformation. 
A.4.1.4. Martensitic and bainitic steels 
The most common martensitic steels contain about 0.35% carbon and alloying 
elements that promote hardenability (Cr, Ni, Mo, etc.). The mechanical strength of 
martensite increases very rapidly with increasing carbon content. It is possible to 
reach a maximum ultimate tensile stress between 2000 and 2500 MPa for carbon 
contents of 0.6–0.7%, for example. In addition to this effect of carbon, which is kept 
in solid solution during quenching, the hardness of martensite comes from: 
– the high density of dislocations generated by the transformation of the 
austenite; 
– crystalline discontinuities at the lath boundaries and block boundaries; 
– solid solution hardening coming from the alloying elements. 
The stress increase is at the expense of elongation. A martensitic steel with 0.6% 
carbon has a uniform elongation of a few percent. It is possible to recover ductility Appendix 357 
by tempering, which annihilates part of the dislocations and precipitates a fraction of 
the carbon in solid solution. 
For the automotive market, in order to combine forming ability with high 
mechanical strength, new grades have been developed that can be hot-formed in the 
austenitic phase and then quenched in the tool to obtain a final part with a 
martensitic microstructure. The 22MnB5 grade is representative of this steel family. 
Containing 0.2% carbon, 1.25% manganese, and boron to increase hardenability, 
this steel has a tensile stress of 1500 MPa after forming. 
Martensitic stainless grades have been developed to combine high strength with 
good corrosion resistance. The most common grades contain 12% chromium and 
between 0.1 and 0.4% carbon. In the quenched-and-tempered condition, yield 
stresses between 440 and 650 MPa can be achieved. It is also possible to induce a 
secondary precipitation during tempering, leading to grades with a yield stress of 
around 1,100 MPa. These grades are used to manufacture corrosion-resistant 
bearings and cutting tool blades. To achieve higher strengths, the PH (precipitation 
hardening) family of stainless steels has been developed. They contain about 17% 
Cr and 4% Ni. They are hardened by fine coherent precipitates formed during a heat 
treatment process. The alloying elements used are mainly Cu, Nb, Mo, Ti, and Al. 
As an example, the 17-4PH steel, hardened with Cu and Nb, reaches a maximum 
stress of 1200 MPa. The most recent families of PH stainless steels (Ferrium S53, 
for example) reach 2000 MPa. 
Finally, in order to reduce the carbon content of the alloys to improve their 
weldability, the thermomechanical parameters of hot rolling and cooling are 
controlled to obtain a bainitic microstructure instead of a ferrite-pearlite structure. It 
is then possible to decrease carbon contents close to 0.1% while ensuring a yield 
stress higher than 550 MPa. Hardenability is improved by adding a few tenths of a 
percent of chromium, molybdenum and nickel. Initially developed for long products, 
these grades were progressively used for thick plates for mechanical engineering and 
shipbuilding, and then for thin plates. They derive their hardness from (Bhadeshia 
2001): 
– a finer size of the microstructural units (bainite laths); 
– a relatively high density of dislocations resulting from the phase 
transformation; 
– a fine precipitation of carbides. 358 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
A.4.2. Austenitic steels 
A.4.2.1. Austenitic manganese steels 
The work hardening of austenitic steels mainly takes advantage of a stronger 
interaction between dislocations (formation of sessile dislocations) and of an often￾planar slip, which slows down the cross-slip (less annihilation of dislocations). A 
higher strain hardening allows higher uniform deformation to be reached (see 
Chapter 1). Stabilization of austenite at room temperature is possible by adding 
nickel, as in stainless steels (section A.4.2.2), but leads to cost variabilities that are 
often too high. 
Thus, more recently, a new family of very high strength steels has been 
developed, the second-generation AHSS steels, by stabilizing the austenite with 
manganese and carbon additions. The emblematic grade contains 22% manganese 
and 0.6% carbon. It achieves over 1000 MPa of ultimate tensile stress with a 
uniform elongation of over 50% (Figure A.10). 
These mechanical properties are obtained by optimizing the composition to 
promote twinning while avoiding martensitic transformation (Section A.3.1.4 and 
Figure A.8). The twins play a role of strong obstacles for the dislocations, equivalent 
to that of a grain boundary. Thus, their multiplication is equivalent to a regular 
decrease in the grain size during the deformation (“dynamic Hall–Petch” effect, see 
Chapter 1). 
The strength can be increased by reducing the initial grain size to about 1 µm. 
Additions of vanadium are sometimes made to increase the strength by precipitation 
of carbides and to reduce the sensitization of the alloy to hydrogen (see Chapter 9). 
However, these new steels are struggling to find a commercial outlet on the 
automotive market because of the difficulties of production on conventional lines for 
carbon steels and their higher cost. Other markets (e.g. tubes, cryogenic tanks) are 
currently studying the potential of these grades. 
A.4.2.2. Austenitic stainless steels 
The addition of chromium, necessary to protect stainless steels against corrosion, 
favors the existence of ferrite in the equilibrium diagram. To obtain austenitic 
grades, it is therefore necessary to add gamma-forming elements such as nickel to 
the alloy. Thus, austenitic stainless grades generally contain 18–25% chromium and 
8–20% nickel. They may also contain up to 3% molybdenum. Carbon is kept below 
0.05% to avoid intergranular chromium carbide precipitation, a source of corrosion Appendix 359 
pitting. The formability of these alloys is very good due to a high strain hardening 
and a relatively low yield stress (around 250 MPa). The yield stress can be increased 
by adding nitrogen, which does not lead to the same precipitation problems as 
carbon. An addition of 0.5% nitrogen leads to a yield stress increase of 480 MPa. 
Figure A.19. Mechanical properties of an austenitic 
stainless steel with 18% chromium and 10% nickel 
Depending on the chemical composition of the alloy, the SFE evolves and all the 
deformation mechanisms of a face-centered cubic structure are obtained: gliding of 
more or less dissociated dislocations, twinning, then induced martensitic 
transformation. Moreover, in this family of steels, the appearance of α′ martensite is 
generally preceded by the formation of ε martensite. All these mechanisms are 
sensitive to the temperature and the deformation rate. A lower deformation 
temperature shifts the mechanisms from dislocation glide toward the martensitic 
transformation. One can define a temperature Md, higher than Ms, below which a 
transformation induced by the deformation occurs (TRIP effect). The stability of the 
austenite is then defined by the parameter Md30, corresponding to the temperature for 360 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
which 50% of the austenite initially present is transformed into martensite after 30% 
of deformation (Pickering 1978): 
𝑀ௗଷ଴ሺ°Cሻ = 497 − 462ሾC+Nሿ − 20ሾNiሿ − 18.5ሾMoሿ − 13.7ሾCrሿ −
9.2ሾSiሿ − 8.1ሾMnሿ [A.17] 
where [X] is the content of element X, expressed in wt%. Other formulas for 
calculating Md30 can be found as a function of composition, but also grain size 
(Izawa 2019). 
This results in a significant sensitivity of the mechanical properties to 
composition and deformation temperature, as shown in Figure A.19. It can be shown 
that the best Rm-A% compromise is close to the conditions for the transition 
between twinning and induced phase transformation (red dotted line in Figure A.19). 
Due to the high cost of nickel additions and its strong variations over time, 
grades have been developed by replacing part of the nickel with manganese. In 
terms of equivalent nickel, it takes about 2% manganese to replace 1% nickel. 
However, the corrosion resistance may be slightly lower than that of austenitic 
nickel grades (Oshima et al. 2007). 
A.4.3. Multiphase steels 
A.4.3.1. High-strength multiphase steels 
A.4.3.1.1. Dual-phase steels 
As the carbon content increases, the austenite transformation during cooling 
leads to a two-phase ferrite-pearlite microstructure. The volume fraction of pearlite 
can vary from a few percent to 100% depending on the carbon content and the 
addition elements. However, as both phases are deformable, it is not possible to 
reach mechanical strengths well above 500 MPa. 
Thus, in order to obtain higher strengths, between 450 and 1200 MPa, it is 
necessary to adapt the process in order to obtain a harder second phase. When the 
temperature annealing after cold rolling is within the ferrite-austenite equilibrium 
domain, a given fraction of austenite forms and is enriched in carbon during 
annealing (Figure A.20a). Upon sufficiently rapid cooling, austenite transforms into 
martensite, leading to dual-phase (DP) steels. It is possible to vary the final 
martensite content between 0 and 100% and to obtain very different microstructures, 
from martensite islands dispersed in a ferritic matrix to a martensitic skeleton 
surrounding ferrite grains. The carbon content of the martensite varies in the Appendix 361 
opposite direction, leading to a martensite hardness that is all the lower as its volume 
fraction increases. These microstructures may also exhibit a banded microstructure, 
aligned along the rolling direction, associated with segregation of the alloying 
elements during casting and solidification. In practice, the martensite content is 
often limited to 10–20% by volume. This also results from a carbon content of the 
steel being kept between 0.1 and 0.2% to ensure a good weldability. In this case, the 
amount of carbon in the martensite is about 0.6%. The main alloying elements are 
manganese (between 1.5 and 2.4%) and silicon (between 0.1 and 0.3%). Although 
the yield stress remains moderate due to the ferritic matrix, the existence of a 
significant mechanical contrast between the two phases leads to a strong work 
hardening allowing uniform elongations of the order of 10–20%.

Figure A.20. Heat treatment to obtain (a) a DP grade and (b) a TRIP grade 
Conventional annealing lines, associated with continuous galvanizing, can lead 
to a slight tempering of the martensite and to the beginning of carbide precipitation, 
which should be avoided by the use of water quenching (see Chapter 5). The control 
of the hot-rolling finishing temperature and the final cooling rate on the run-out 
table also allows these grades in hot-rolled plates to be obtained. 
A.4.3.1.2. Multiphase steels with TRIP effect 
In order to further improve the uniform elongation while increasing the 
mechanical strength, it is necessary to implement a hardening mechanism 
complementary to that coming from the dislocations. As seen in the case of stainless 
steels, this could come from a progressive transformation of austenite into 
martensite during deformation. The development of TRIP steels adapts this idea for 
low-alloy carbon steels. The challenge is to stabilize austenite at room temperature 
while limiting the carbon content and the alloying elements. To ensure good 362 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
welding, carbon contents are only slightly higher than those of DP steels: 0.2–0.25% 
carbon. The main difference is the addition of aluminum and silicon (up to 2% for 
the total of both), elements that delay the precipitation of carbides in the austenite. 
The first part of the annealing after cold rolling is similar to that for DP (Figure 
A.20b). The temperature and holding time are adjusted to obtain about 50% of 
each phase, ferrite and austenite. For this volume fraction, the carbon content of the 
austenite, 0.3–0.4%, is not enough to stabilize the austenite at room temperature. 
A second step is therefore introduced in the annealing cycle: after quenching to 
300–450°C, which avoids pearlite precipitation, the sheet is held at this temperature, 
allowing part of the austenite to transform into bainite (Sakuma et al. 1992). During 
this holding time, carbon diffuses from the bainite to the untransformed austenite. 
The sheets are then cooled to room temperature, with sufficient carbon enrichment 
of the austenite to make it metastable, that is, room temperature is between Ms and 
Md for the actual composition of the residual austenite. The resulting microstructure 
is quite complex with about 50% ferrite, 35–40% bainite and 10–15% austenite. 
This austenite fraction gradually transforms during deformation, leading to an 
ultimate tensile stress of more than 1200 MPa at a uniform elongation of more than 
15%. 
The ductility is high enough for the stamped parts to retain a capacity of residual 
deformation. Taking into account the high work hardening, this allows TRIP steels 
to exhibit higher crashworthiness than other ultra-high strength grades (Galan et al. 
2012) (see Chapter 7). 
Figure A.21. Heat treatment to obtain a Q&P steel Appendix 363 
A.4.3.1.3. Third-generation ultra-high strength steels 
The main limitations of TRIP steels are the low volume fraction of residual 
austenite and the low strength of the ferritic matrix. A third generation of very high 
strength steels has therefore been developed based on a quenching and partitioning 
(Q&P) process (Speer et al. 2004). 
A typical example of Q&P treatment can be given for a steel with 0.22% carbon, 
1.8% manganese and 1.4% silicon: heating in the austenitic range followed by 
interrupted quenching. The microstructure is then a mixture of martensite and 
austenite depending on the final cooling temperature (Figure A.21). This treatment 
is followed by a reheating, called the partitioning step, during which carbon diffuses 
from the supersaturated martensite so as to: 
– enrich the austenite in carbon, favoring its stability at room temperature and 
the TRIP effect during the subsequent deformation; 
– form a tempered martensite, which improves resistance to damage while 
maintaining high mechanical strength. 
More generally, Q&P steels contain between 0.15 and 0.4% carbon, between 1.5 
and 2.5% manganese and around 1.5% aluminum and silicon. Temperatures for 
quenching are between 200 and 350°C and for partitioning between 300 and 500°C. 
The small grain size of the complex microstructure – martensite, bainite and residual 
austenite – of the order of 1 µm (Figure A.22), and the TRIP effect allow a tensile 
stress between 1000 and 1500 MPa to be achieved with a total elongation of up to 
20%. However, the industrial development of this new generation of steels requires 
heavy modifications of the annealing line, as the current lines are generally not 
designed to allow continuous reheating and holding after quenching.

A.4.3.2. Austenite-ferrite steels 
A.4.3.2.1. Duplex stainless steels 
Duplex stainless steels, that is, two-phase austenite-ferrite, were developed to 
increase the resistance to chloride corrosion in the paper industry (Charles 2010). 
Depending on their composition, they contain between 40 and 60% of ferrite and 
austenite. Because stainless ferritic steel has a higher yield stress than austenite, the 
yield stress of duplex steels increases from 400 to 600 MPa when the volume 
fraction of ferrite increases from 30 to 60%. 
As with austenitic grades, new duplex grades are being developed with reduced 
nickel and molybdenum contents to limit cost. These new grades are sometimes 
called lean duplex stainless steel. 
More recent developments for oil industry have led to the addition of nitrogen, 
which enhances the corrosion resistance and improves the toughness of welded 
joints. Moreover, the addition of nitrogen promotes hardening by fine precipitation 
that increases yield stress and fracture stress without affecting toughness. 
A.4.3.2.2. Medium Mn steels 
As seen for stainless steels and very high manganese steels, it is possible to 
manage the proportion of austenite and its stability by changing the steel 
composition. Thus, a new family of very high strength steels has recently been 
developed: the so-called third-generation advanced high-strength steels (AHSS), 
which are medium manganese steels (Arlazarov et al. 2012). 
To maintain acceptable weldability, the carbon content is limited to around 
0.2%. The choice of manganese to increase the austenite content was imposed for 
cost reasons compared, in particular, to nickel. Therefore, between 3 and 8% 
manganese is added, hence the name of this steel family, and up to 3% aluminum. 
Cold-rolling produces a very fine deformed martensitic microstructure which is 
annealed in the intercritical region. Depending on the annealing temperature, the 
austenite volume fraction varies, as well as its composition. After cooling, a duplex 
microstructure containing between 15 and 40% residual austenite is obtained 
(Figure A.23) with a micrometer or even sub-micrometer grain size. The addition of 
manganese effectively exceeds the typical volume fractions of residual austenite in 
first generation TRIP steels (section A.4.3.1.2). Furthermore, the stability of 
austenite varies with its composition, that is, alloy composition, and annealing Appendix 365 
temperature and time. During plastic deformation, induced martensitic 
transformation thus takes place more or less rapidly depending on the annealing 
conditions, leading to relatively different mechanical behaviors: if the 
transformation is rapid, the strain hardening is important and the uniform elongation 
remains moderate – behavior close to that of a DP steel – if the transformation is 
slower, the elongation increases, but the fracture resistance can also become lower. 
Figure A.23. SEM image of the microstructure of a medium Mn steel of composition 
0.2%C-4%Mn-1.5%Si-0.8%Al after annealing at 700°C in the austenite-ferrite 
domain. The austenite forms small islands (in light gray) within a ferritic matrix 
Several studies have investigated an alloy with 0.2% carbon, 5% manganese and 
2.5% aluminum annealed at temperatures between 740 and 780°C. After annealing 
at 740°C, the microstructure is composed of 70% ferrite and 30% austenite. After 
780°C, the austenite is less stable and about 25% martensite appears on cooling, 
with 60% ferrite and 15% residual austenite. 
The effect of these microstructural differences are clearly evidenced by the 
tensile curves in Figure A.24. It is possible to define the composition and the 
annealing temperature to obtain the targeted Rm-A% for a given application. 
Finally, we note that these curves show a Lüders plateau when there is no martensite 
formed on cooling, as well as a PLC effect, at least for the lowest annealing 
temperatures. 
Finally, other work aims to improve the specific strength (mechanical strength 
divided by density) by reducing the density of medium Mn steels by adding 
aluminum. The addition of 1 wt% aluminum reduces the density of the alloy by 
1.5% (Frommeyer and Brüx 2006). Thus, for example, a steel with a tensile strength 366 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
of 800 MPa forms parts of the same weight as a 1000 MPa steel if its density is 
10% lower (Schmitt and Iung 2018). 
Alloys containing 1.2% carbon, 30% manganese, and 2% aluminum have been 
studied in the laboratory. The resulting steels are fully austenitic (Gutierrez-Urrutia 
and Raabe 2013), but combine the problems of high-manganese TWIP steels with a 
reduction in elongation due to the precipitation of complex (Fe,Mn)3AlC (phase κ). 
It is therefore necessary to reduce the manganese content to avoid this precipitation. 
Promising routes are around 0.2–0.5% carbon, 2–8% manganese and 5–8% 
aluminum. Solidification occurs in phase δ and the austenitic transformation is not 
complete after cooling. After cold-rolling and annealing, the microstructure is 
bimodal with ferrite bands of a few tens of micrometers containing relatively large 
grains and fine-grained ferrite-austenite bands. Although allowing interesting 
mechanical properties (yield stress of 600 MPa and uniform elongation of 30%), the 
large ferrite grains can generate brittle fracture at low temperature. Further research 
is still needed to bring these alloys to industrial maturity.

What’s Next for Ultra-high 
Strength Steels? 
François MUDRY
French Academy of Technologies, Paris, France 
The previous chapters have shown the extent of the efforts that had to be made to 
meet the demands of the automotive industry for lighter steel parts, as well as those 
of other sectors. It has been necessary to harden steels while maintaining acceptable 
ductility, correct weldability and corrosion resistance as good as before. This 
required an adaptation of the manufacturing processes, both for continuous casting 
and for hot and cold rolling. In particular, continuous annealing had to be adapted. It 
was also necessary to make efforts to dialogue with car manufacturers to show them 
that these new steels could indeed be used at the cost of adapting the design of their 
parts as well as their internal processes. 
This development is a good example of the industry’s ability to adapt when a 
new social demand emerges; in this case, the reduction of CO2 emissions from cars 
with the same type of engine. It took about 20 years from the first regulations issued 
by the European Commission to achieve this result through a complete reorientation 
of all metallurgical research and a very close technical dialogue between 
manufacturers and steelmakers on the various possible solutions. This dialogue was 
intensified despite the reluctance of buyers who feared that the supplier would 
increase its prices unreasonably and, finally, changes in manufacturing processes at 
both the steelmakers and the manufacturers in a situation where it was very tough 
for both to invest! 374 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
This history is now largely behind us, although significant progress is still 
possible in the field of hydrogen embrittlement control, for example. 
Societal pressure to reduce CO2 emissions is far from over, but it is moving in 
other directions without abandoning the objective of reduction. This implies, in 
particular, the development of other forms of motorization for the automobile: 
electric cars, use of hydrogen, etc. 
In this spirit, we can mention the following points that will certainly require 
important modifications in the steel industry as well as in metallurgical research on 
steels. It is possible to discern three of them: 
– the decarbonization of steel manufacturing and, in particular, the 
industrialization of sophisticated steel manufacturing processes based on recycled 
scrap metal; 
– the development of electricity production from decarbonated sources; 
– the possibility of assembling steels with other materials to make the most of 
the advantages of each. 
P.1. Decarbonization of steelmaking and recycling 
Steel is made either from iron ore (the so-called “integrated” process) or from 
scrap metal (the so-called “recycling” process). The processes for both are well 
known and used daily. They each emit quantities of greenhouse gases that are also 
well analyzed. For the integrated process, eliminating oxygen in the iron oxide 
molecules by carbon inevitably leads to the emission of a lot of carbon dioxide. This 
is by far the most essential item for an integrated plant. In a well-tuned plant, 
emissions are in the order of 1.8 tons of CO2 per ton of iron produced. This can be as 
much as 2.5 tons for less well managed plants. In contrast, the production of 1 ton of 
steel from scrap emits only about 0.3 ton of CO2. This figure includes emissions 
from electricity consumption, as the melting of scrap metal takes place in an electric 
furnace that consumes a lot of electricity. The figure shown is therefore crucially 
dependent on the amount of CO2 associated with the production of 1 kWh. The 
decarbonization of electricity mentioned below will therefore mechanically lead to 
decreased emissions. 
Given these figures, the administration is obviously seeking to favor this second 
route, as the emissions are significantly lower. However, the deployment of the 
recycling sector is limited by the quantity of scrap metal available. Indeed, today’s 
scrap metal comes from products that were put on the market an average of 30 years Postface 375 
ago. The annual growth of steel production in the world, driven by China and then 
by India, has been between 2 and 6% for the past 20 years. The amount of scrap 
available on the market is therefore, assuming a perfect recycling system, at most 
50% of the current product demand. 
Nevertheless, Chinese production is currently stabilizing, and India should 
follow within the next 20 years. Only Africa will then be left to equip. We can 
therefore anticipate a saturation of the steel demand linked, initially, to the 
equipment of countries (bridges, stations, railroads, power stations, etc.), then, in a 
second phase and after a “steel crisis”, a renewal market. Steel consumption is 
estimated at between 250 and 350 kg per capita per year. If the world’s population 
stabilizes at around 10 billion, the demand for steel will undoubtedly follow suit. 
Figure P.1, based on data from World Steel in Figures 20201
, shows the growth 
in steel production since 1950 and the two consumption asymptotes mentioned 
above. The extrapolation gives a stabilization between 2030 and 2050, or even 
further, because there may be an overshoot phenomenon, as has happened in the past 
for many countries. 
Figure P.1. Evolution of steel production (continuous blue curve) compared to two 
possible asymptotes according to the estimated per capita consumption: 250 (dotted 
line) and 350 (mixed dotted line) kg/inhabitant. For a color version of this figure, see

Then the amount of scrap available could be 80% or more of the steel demand. It 
could even reach 90% if recycling techniques are further improved. We can see that 
the older industrialized countries have a higher share of production through 
recycling: 41% for Europe, 67% for North America and only 10% for China! 
Thus, a steady growth in the proportion of the recycling industry could be 
anticipated. The trigger will be the price of scrap metal, which is unfortunately very 
volatile. Nevertheless, steelmakers can be counted on to exploit a steady downward 
trend in this price while the quality of iron ore would have a steady tendency to 
deteriorate. 
However, this will take time. World production is only half to two-thirds of what 
it could be. One alternative is obviously to decarbonize the integrated route. Much 
research has been undertaken to develop processes to produce steel without 
greenhouse gas emissions from iron ore. It has focused on the equipment that 
reduces iron oxides, namely the blast furnace, as this is where most CO2 emissions 
come from (Meijer 2009). Possible ways are to modify the blast furnace to allow 
geological storage or reuse of the emitted CO2, change the technology by using 
direct electrolysis of iron ore, or finally modify the direct reduction technology by 
methane to allow the use of hydrogen. These processes are at the industrial research 
stage. In all three cases, industrial use in significant quantities still seems rather far. 
It should be noted, however, that the direct reduction iron (DRI) process using 
hydrogen rather than natural gas is in the industrialization phase in the ArcelorMittal 
group. However, it assumes the availability of hydrogen at a competitive cost. 
This is why the development of the recycling sector seems to be preferred for 
reasons that go beyond the problem of greenhouse gases, if only to avoid the use of 
primary materials. This development will require numerous adaptations, both in the 
products’ metallurgy and processes used. The first development will concern the 
techniques of scrap preparation to obtain, in fine, a quality product. The current 
recovery and sorting schemes will have to be further improved. The automatic 
sorting tools after an on-the-fly analysis of the chemistry of the inputs seem to have 
good improvement capacities. Thus, we can expect to have relatively good control 
of the chemistry of the electric furnace feedings. Nevertheless, unwanted elements 
like copper or tin cannot be completely avoided. This is very important because the 
chemistry of the liquid bath can only be improved slightly in the subsequent 
secondary metallurgy steps. However, this step will require special attention. The 
casting will also need to be optimized to avoid temperature zones where hot 
cracking occurs. Postface 377 
In the future, certain very ductile products requiring very low carbon or nitrogen 
contents will probably be challenging to produce by this method. There will 
therefore remain a share of production by the integrated route, let us say, 0–15%. 
In particular, the high- or very high-strength steels discussed in this book will 
need to be adapted to be made by the recycling route. This will probably require 
adaptations in the chemistry to accept higher copper or tin contents. It will also 
require the development of suitable secondary metallurgy at the cost of possible 
investment. Similarly, casting at higher cooling rates (and therefore at lower 
thicknesses) will probably be preferable. All the experience gained in the dialogue 
with customers will, of course, be used to further optimize the design and adapt the 
manufacturers’ processes. 
P.2. The development of electricity production from decarbonated 
sources 
The other likely development is the increasing share of electricity in overall 
energy consumption, again to address the issue of greenhouse gases. 
Some think that hydrogen could also play an important role. This is possible for 
certain modes of transport. However, electricity will still be the primary source of 
energy, and it will have to be decarbonized. The evolution will be slow at the global 
level, but it seems inevitable. 
This decarbonized electricity production can be done by conventional means 
with sequestration of CO2 emissions, by wind or solar power, or even by geothermal 
energy or, finally, from nuclear energy. For the latter, it is very difficult to anticipate 
what may happen as the evolution of public opinion on this type of energy is 
difficult to predict at the global level. 
In the nuclear sector, changes in the metallurgy will be very slow, because the 
safety files must be completely reconstituted, which requires considerable work. For 
other types of primary energy, some development of new steels will be required. 
One example is wind turbine gears, as their degradation mechanisms are unique 
(Greco 2013) and their replacement cost is high. Another example is the degradation 
mechanisms of bacterial corrosion-resistant alloys for geothermal or sequestration. 
These cases are quite similar to those for oil wells with some specificities (Nogara 
2018a, 2018b). In contrast, for solar energy, existing steel products should suffice. 378 New Advanced High Strength Steels 
P.3. Multi-material assembly 
This evolution is already well underway. More and more products from the 
manufacturing industry are composed of many materials. The aim is to make the 
most of the advantages of each material for the intended application. There are, 
however, two difficulties raised by this trend. 
First of all, assembling different materials is not always easy: no matter what you 
do, an assembly line between two materials is always a weak line. This is why, 
during the design phase, one will arrange to position them in weak loaded areas. 
However, this is not always possible. 
The assembly techniques are very varied: 
– mechanical assemblies such as screws, rivets or other more recent 
developments; 
– collage, a very active research subject with multiple very significant advances; 
– welding or brazing, where the story is also far from over. 
In all these cases, steel must be adapted to allow the connection to be made and 
to hold under the anticipated stresses. This is a complex problem because of the 
variety of joining methods. We can therefore anticipate that consortiums between 
users, developers of joining solutions and metallurgists will be necessary. 
The other difficulty concerns recycling. The more a product is composed of 
different materials, the more complicated the end-of-life treatment is. When, for 
design reasons, one has been obliged to make very resistant assemblies, it will be 
impossible to carry out the separation with the current tools used by the recycling 
industry. It will probably be necessary to use new techniques such as cryogenic 
grinding or specific chemical attacks. This kind of development is particularly 
difficult to finance, as the nagging question of “Who will pay for it?” is not easy to 
answer. 
P.4. A conclusion? 
Finally, steel will still be used a lot in the world and for a long time. We can 
estimate the annual consumption between 2.5 and 3.5 billion tons when our planet 
has developed in all its components. Today, we are at a production of 1.8 billion 
tons. So there is still room for improvement. A naive extrapolation gives 20–30 
years to reach the figures mentioned. Postface 379 
Steel is very easily recyclable, which is a significant advantage in the long term. 
It will therefore still be used very heavily in the future. Will per capita consumption 
be higher or lower than today? It is hard to say because user markets can change 
significantly. We have seen this in the automotive and energy sectors, but it may 
also be the case for buildings and public works, which have always accounted for a 
large share of consumption. 
There is therefore little doubt that a lot of work will still be required of 
metallurgists in the future. What has been understood and dominated about the 
development of high- and ultra-high-strength steels for various markets, including 
the automotive market, will still be helpful to know in the future. This book recalls 
the main advances for future metallurgists, who will certainly face different 
problems but will be able to build on the developments already achieved.
