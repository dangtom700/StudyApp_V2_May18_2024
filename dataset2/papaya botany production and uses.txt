Papaya is the third most widely produced tropical fruit worldwide after mango and 
pineapple. It is grown commercially and as a backyard crop in more than 60 countries. 
Production is generally found between 30°N and 40°S, but commercial production is com￾pressed in a circumferential region around the equator 25°N to 25°S.
Information on the biology, production and utilization of papaya has been available for 
over 100 years in the form of articles in scientific and popular journals, advisory pamphlets, 
bulletins, reports, crop information kits and booklets. Global sharing of information on 
papaya was advanced by the First International Papaya Symposium held at Genting Highlands, 
Malaysia in 2005 under the aegis of the International Society for Horticultural Science 
(ISHS). This has been followed by regular symposia every 4 years in different papaya￾producing countries, including India, Thailand and Mexico. Proceedings of these symposia 
were published as volumes of Acta Horticulturae that provide a rich source of scientific 
literature. These meetings successfully open a dialogue among papaya researchers, and this 
book has indirectly grown out of such interactions.
This publication presents the current state of knowledge concerning the history, physiology, 
culture and marketing of papaya throughout the world. The book is mainly targeted at 
papaya researchers, teachers, academics, students, growers and industry support personnel.

1.1 Origin and History
Carica papaya belongs to the family 
Caricaceae which consists of 34 species (and one 
formally named hybrid) and six genera (Cari￾ca, Jacaratia, Horovitzia, Jarilla, Vasconcellea
and Cylicomorpha) (Carvalho and Renner, 
2014). It has been suggested that the genus Car￾ica was separated from its sister clade (Vascon￾cellea and Jacaratia) 25 million years ago, and 
since then it has had its own lineage (Carvalho 
and Renner, 2012; Pérez-Sarabia et al., 2017). 
The closest relatives to C. papaya are Jarilla and 
Horovitzia, both of which have a Mexican ori￾gin (Carvalho and Renner, 2014). The largest 
genus in the family Vasconcellea comprises 20 
species and a naturally occurring hybrid, Vas￾concellea × heilbornii (Badillo, 2000; Van 
Droogenbroeck et al., 2002). The centre of spe￾cies diversity of the Vasconcellea genus is in 
north-western South America, especially Ecua￾dor, Colombia and Peru. The genus Jacaratia
comprises seven species, and is widespread in 
the lowlands of the Neotropics with only one 
species, Jacaratia chocoensis that is found at 
altitudes up to 1300 m in the Andes. Jarilla com￾prises three herbaceous species with perennial 
tubers that resprout annually during the wet 
season (Diaz-Luna and Lomeli-Sencion, 1992).
The first botanic record of C. papaya
was made in 1753 by Linneaus (the Herbar￾ium of the Missouri Botanical Garden – 
Tropicos.org, 2019) but this does not 
include historical botanic records deposited 
in local or national herbaria (Fernández 
et al., 2012). C. papaya L. is considered na￾tive to southern Mexico and Central America 
(Northern Mesoamerica) (Carvalho and Ren￾ner, 2012, 2014; Fuentes and Santamaria, 
2014; Chávez-Pesqueira and Nuñez-Farfán, 
2016). Wild papaya plants can be observed 
in populations distributed in several local￾ities of the Mayan region (Yucatán and south 
of Mexico). Wild plants can be observed 
on the roadside and especially on the edges 
of roads and rural roads (Fig. 1.1). Wild pa￾paya plants, native or non-domesticated, 
can be observed in ruderal vegetation 
(roadsides), and in successional vegeta￾tion or secondary vegetation. C. papaya
wild plants are found with other plant 
species typical of the vegetation of the 
medium subperennifolia forest, subca￾ducifolia and deciduous or caducifolia low 
forest (dry forest) or secondary vegetation 
(G. Fuentes and J.M. Santamaria, personal 
observations; Flora de la Península de 
Yucatán – CICY, 2010). The wild populations

that can be found in Yucatán normally have 
three or four individuals, but populations 
with up to 40 individuals can also be found. 
Wild populations of C. papaya can survive 
in adverse environments such as burning 
habitats, or in environments with temperat￾ures above 40°C, or even in environments 
with prolonged drought (April and May in 
Yucatán, Mexico) (Alcocer, 2013; Girón, 
2015; Chávez-Pesqueira and Nuñez-Farfán, 
2016). In the dry season when other species 
such as trees and shrubs can be found with￾out leaves, the wild papaya plants are 
found with leaves and flowers, and most of 
the papaya plants have a great number of 
fruits that survive until the rainy season 
in late June.
Interestingly, wild papaya plants have 
some characteristics that differ from those 
of papaya plants found in backyards of 
Yucatán towns. Wild plants cross pollinate, 
generating a very particular group with char￾acteristics from wild and cultivated plants 
(feral populations). Semi-wild papaya plants 
can be found in backyards of many houses in 
the Mayan community. However, older people 
in the community who have traditional 
knowledge suggest a loss of traditional know￾ledge about the reproduction and sexuality 
of this species. This loss has implications

for the conservation of the germplasm of 
this species (Moo, 2015). Two characteris￾tics of these fruits are: (i) fruits of larger size 
than those from wild plants; and (ii) the fact 
that it is possible to find fruits that are borne 
on hermaphrodite plants. On the contrary 
in wild C. papaya populations, fruits are 
rounded and small and only female and 
male plants are found.
An isozyme analysis of numerous 
papaya accessions, while revealing limited 
genetic diversity, showed that wild papaya 
plants from Yucatán, Belize, Guatemala and 
Honduras were more related to each other 
than to domesticated plants from the same 
region (Morshidi et al., 1995).
The origin of C. papaya is in the north 
of Mesoamerica and the later domestication 
and cultivation also involved the adaptation 
of wild papaya to climate change over time 
(Zizumbo-Villarreal et al., 2014). The domes￾tication in many forms by different groups 
in different environments expanded its gen￾etic diversity. C. papaya is found in differ￾ent environments, records of papaya plants 
(herbarium data) can be found from 1000 to 
1981 m above sea level (masl), from the Mexi￾can states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Oaxaca and 
Veracruz (3% of records). However, a large 
number of records are located at low eleva￾tions, between 0 and 200 masl (41% of re￾cords). The states with a high number of 
records (herbarium samples) are Veracruz 
(21%), Chiapas (20%), Oaxaca (18%), Cam￾peche (9%), Tabasco (6%), Quintana Roo 
(6%) and Yucatán (5%) (Herbario Nacional de 
México, UNAM, 2019). On the other hand, 
it is interesting that wild C. papaya plants 
are dioecious (with female and male plants), 
and pollen must be transported by a vector 
and/or by air to carry out pollination. There 
are a lot of male plants (Y) in the Yucatán 
vegetation. In Yucatán it is possible to find 
wild C. papaya plants bearing very small 
rounded fruits (2–3 cm long).
Wild papaya plants should be a great 
reservoir of potential genes that may have 
been ‘lost’ (not expressed or repressed) dur￾ing the domestication process. These wild 
plants are in contact with adverse physical 
environmental conditions (abiotic agents) 
and with other animals (biotic agents), and 
their genetic base is broadened in order to 
survive these conditions (Fig. 1.2). By having 
the genome of a commercial papaya sequenced 
(Ming et al., 2008), it is very interesting to 
know the genome of a wild papaya.
Even if 100% of national requirements 
are currently satisfied with domestic pro￾duction in relation to the varieties or types 
that are grown, one of the great challenges 
has been to diversify the species (i.e. to gen￾erate varieties or types of papaya that can al￾ready either meet demands or offer products 
for particular needs). For example, fruit with a 
high content of lycopene versus a fruit with 
a high content of β-carotene or fruits that are 
about the size of a mango that could be con￾sumed individually by a single person or a 
fruit that can be used as vector of vaccines.
C. papaya is thus one of the genetic re￾sources provided by Mexico and Central 
America to the world. The papaya (pitzáhu￾ac or chichihualtzapotl in Nahuatl), that can 
be translated as ‘zapotenodriza’ in Spanish, 
is a fruit native to Mexico and Central 
America (Mesoameric zone) that has been 
used since the pre-Hispanic period (Vargas, 
2014). The Spanish distributed this fruit 
around the world (particularly in Asia and 
Europe) since the 16th century, so that it is 
now known in most places around the 
world (González and del Amo, 2012).
In pre-Hispanic México, the main plants 
included in the Mesoamerican diet were: 
nopales, quelites, sweet potatoes, algae, 
mushrooms, tamarindo, capulines, tejocotes, 
jicama, chirimoya, guanabana, mesquite, sun￾flower, guava, mamey, papaya, jicama, pine￾apple, banana, zapote, as well as grasshoppers 
and maguey worms, among others (Gior￾dano, 2018). C. papaya is a fruit associated 
with the traditional agriculture of the lowland 
Maya that currently have wild populations 
or wild ancestors within the Mayan area 
(Colunga-García and Zizumbo-Villareal, 2004; 
González and del Amo, 2012).
1.2 Composition and Uses
It seems that papaya is a crop with a lot of 
potential as many countries are interested

in consuming papaya fruit. This interest may 
increase as the knowledge of its great bene￾fits for nutrition and health may increase. For 
example, papaya is a relative low-price source 
of lycopene, β-carotene, polyphenols, many 
vitamins and fibre. Thus, it is likely that 
papaya will be consumed in future years 
not only for its flavour, but also for its nutri￾tional and nutraceutical properties.
Papaya is a rich source of many nutri￾ents and vitamins. The fruit is an excellent 
source of vitamins such as vitamin C, and is 
rich in folic acid (FDC, 2020). The fruit also 
contains a relatively high content of dietary 
fibre (Desjardins, 2019). The ripe fruit con￾tent is about 8% sugar, mostly in the form of 
glucose, fructose and sucrose. In ripe fruits, 
sucrose is the predominant sugar (Selvaraj 
et al., 1982). Ripe fruit is rich in vitamin C 
at levels which are close to those found in 
orange (FDC, 2020) and quite comparable to 
mango and strawberry (Septembre-Malaterre 
et al., 2016). Papaya contains high levels of min￾erals such as calcium, potassium, phosphorus 
and iron (Table 1.1). The fruit is also rich in 
protein (0.4–1.1 g 100 g-1 fresh weight 
(FW)) compared with other tropical fruits 
(Desjardins, 2019). These proteins are es￾sentially cysteine-type proteases, which have 
long been used by Mayans for medicinal 
purposes (Perez, 2009). Non-volatile organic 
acids form the major portion (about 80–90%) 
of total acidity in fruits. Citric and malic 
are the predominant acids, but the pres￾ence of tartaric, malonic, fumaric and 
succinic acids was also noted (Chittiraichel￾van and Shanmugavelu, 1978; Selvaraj 
et al., 1982).
The fruit contain polyphenols, provita￾min A carotenoids and glucosinolates known 
for their antioxidant action (Desjardins, 
2019). In terms of extractable polyphenol, 
papaya contains essentially glycosides of 
hydroxycinnamic acids like coumaric acid, 
ferulic acid, caffeoyl-hexosides, protocatechuic￾hexosides and some flavonols (Gayosso￾Garcia Sancho et al., 2011; Calvache et al., 
2016). Isorhamnetin, rutin, quercetin and 
myricetin are the main flavonols found in 
papaya (Rivera-Pastrana et al., 2010).

The flesh colour of papaya, red or yel￾low, is due to carotenoids. The red-fleshed 
papaya contains lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin, 
β-carotene-5-6-epoxide and zeta-carotene 
(Chandrika et al., 2003). Red-pulped papaya 
accumulated more lycopene, with contents 
reaching as much as 3000 μg 100 g-1 FW. 
Red-pulped genotypes show low contents of 
yellow pigments, such as β-cryptoxanthin, 
zeaxanthin and violaxanthin (Chan-León 
et al., 2017). β-Carotene of papayas is approxi￾mately three times more bioavailable than 
that of carrots and tomatoes (Schweiggert 
et al., 2019). An increased bioavailability of 
lycopene from red-coloured papaya could 
be explained by the fact that lycopene crys￾tals in papaya were smaller when compared 
with those found in tomato (Schweiggert et al., 
2014). Papaya is therefore a valuable source of 
lycopene and provitamin A carotenoids, and 
it could be used to reduce the incidence of 
vitamin A deficiency, in particular in devel￾oping countries (Desjardins, 2019; Schweig￾gert et al., 2019).
Papaya also contains glucotropaeolin, 
a glucosinolate that upon hydrolysis by the 
enzyme myrosinase produces benzyl iso￾thiocyanate (Spencer and Seigler, 1984). 
The peel of papaya contained as much as 
125 mg 100 g-1 FW glucotropaeolin, an amount 
equivalent to the consumption of 100 g fresh 
broccoli containing glucoraphanin (Rosset￾to et al., 2008). Papaya is a good source of 
serotonin (0.99 mg 100 g-1 FW), which has 
been associated with enabling the gut to 
mediate reflex activity and also decreasing 
the risk of thrombosis (Santigo-Silva et al., 
2011).
Papaya has been used in traditional 
medicine to treat many disorders. Leaves, 
bark, roots, latex, fruits and seeds contain 
specific phytochemicals that are bioactive 
against many diseases. Experiments have 
shown that papaya possesses anthelmintic, 
antiprotozoan, antibacterial, antifungal, 
antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, 
antihypertensive, hypoglycaemic and hy￾polipidaemic, wound healing, antitumour, 
free-radical scavenging, antisickling, neuro￾protective, diuretic, abortifacient and antifer￾tility activities (Desjardins, 2019). It has been 
reported to prevent cancer (Pathak et al., 2014), 
and to regulate lipidaemia (Esmael et al., 
2015), type 2 diabetes (Aruoma et al., 2010), 
cardiovascular disease (Jarisarapurin et al., 
2019), macular degeneration (Gouado 
et al., 2007) and gastric lesions (Murakami 
et al., 2012). Both seed and pulp of papaya 
have bacteriostatic properties against several 
enteropathogens such as Bacillus subtilis, 
Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Klebsiella pneumoniae determined via 
the agar cup plate method (Osato et al., 
1993). Subenthiran et al. (2013) investi￾gated the platelet increasing property of 
C. papaya leaves juice (CPLJ) on patients with 
dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic 
fever (DHF). They concluded that CPLJ sig￾nificantly accelerates the rate of increase in 
platelet counts in patients with DF and DHF. 
The anthelmintic activity of papaya seed has 
been predominantly attributed to carpine 
(an alkaloid) and carpasemine (later identi￾fied as benzyl thiourea) (Boshra and Tajul, 
2013). Chinoy et al. (2006) reported the an￾tifertility, anti-implantation and abortifa￾cient properties of extracts of papaya seeds.

different laboratories around the world has

demonstrated that consumption of papaya 
definitely provides positive effects against 
a number of chronic diseases. The exact 
modes of action of the different bioactive 
compounds on health are slowly being 
unraveled. It is becoming clear that their 
preventive influence is mediated not only 
by their effect on antioxidant capacity, but 
also the effect of papaya polyphenols is 
gaining much credence (Desjardins, 2019).
Using the combined techniques of gas 
chromatography and mass spectrometry, 
Flath and Forrey (1977) identified as many 
as 106 volatile components in papaya fruit. 
Most of the components are present in low 
concentrations, which varied among the 
cultivars and locality (MacLeod and Pieris, 
1983). Linalool has been identified as the 
major volatile component in cultivar ‘Solo’ 
(Franco and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1993). Kelebek 
et al. (2015) identified a total of 46 and 42 
aroma compounds including esters, alcohols, 
terpenes, lactones, acids, carbonyl com￾pounds and volatile phenols in papaya cul￾tivars ‘Solo-42’ and ‘Tainung’, respectively. 
The major aroma components of mountain 
papaya (Vasconcellea pubescens) have been 
identified as ethyl butyrate, butanol, ethyl 
acetate, butyl acetate and methyl butyrate 
(Morales and Duque, 1987). These aspects are 
also discussed in Chapter 11, this volume.
1.3 Processing
The prospect of increasing the production 
of papaya in many countries, and their rela￾tively short postharvest life as fresh com￾modities, raises expectations for increased 
processing opportunities of this crop. Papaya 
can be processed to obtain many preserved 
products such as candy, jams, jellies, dried 
and canned papaya. It can also be converted to 
ready-to-drink beverages and nectar (Devika 
et al., 2015).
1.3.1 Candy
Fruits are peeled, trimmed and cut longitu￾dinally into pieces. The fruits are then soaked 
overnight in lime water (saturated calcium 
oxide solution), blanched in boiling water 
for 3 min and soaked in a 30°Brix sucrose 
solution at a ratio of 1:1.5 (fruit:sucrose 
solution) for 10–12 h with 1000 ppm of 
sodium metabisulfite, 0.5% salt and ad￾justed with citric acid to pH 3.5. The slices 
are held at 40°, 50° and 60°Brix with addition 
of extra sugar (Chavasit et al., 2002). The 
process of impregnation with sugar must 
not be hurried otherwise the fruit will shrivel 
and be unfit for glazing and crystallizing 
(Kumar et al., 2019).
1.3.2 Jam
Jams are fruit preserves, which consist of 
45 parts prepared fruit with 55 parts of sugar 
concentrate to make 65% or higher solids, 
resulting in a semi-solid product (Devika 
et al., 2015). Papaya jam is prepared by 
cooking peeled ripe papaya slices with an 
equal weight of sugar. Citric acid at 5 g kg-1
of pulp is added to improve the sugar acid 
ratio which also helps in the production of 
inverted sugars that prevent sugar crystal￾lization in the jam during storage. Cooking 
the fruit pulp and sugar mixture is con￾tinued until it attains a thick consistency, 
which usually corresponds to a 65–68°Brix. 
Clean, dry and sterilized glass jars are filled 
with the hot jam, sealed airtight and cooled 
(Lal and Das, 1956).
1.3.3 Dehydrated
Papaya slices pretreated by steeping in 
70°Brix sucrose solution along with 1000 
ppm of SO2
 yielded a good product with 
50% retention of carotenoids. The product 
had 0.42% acidity, 32% reducing sugars, 
70% total sugars, 600 ppm SO2
 and 18.2% 
moisture, with a rehydration ratio 1:2.1 (Me￾htha and Tomar, 1980). Osmotic dehydra￾tion has received greater attention in recent 
years as an effective method of preservation 
which is a simple process, facilitating 
processing with retention of the initial fruit 
characteristics (i.e. colour, aroma, texture 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

and nutritional composition) (Singh et al., 
2015). Papaya slices treated with a 60°Brix 
sucrose solution as the osmotic agent at 
50°C temperature with 30 min immersion 
followed by further drying in dryer at 70°C 
showed the papaya slices were easily rehy￾drated and there was good nutrient reten￾tion, texture, colour, taste and acceptability 
(Singh et al., 2015).
1.3.4 Minimal processing
Minimally processed freshly cut papaya 
that is ready to eat and for consumption 
after storage with instant sensory and nu￾tritional properties have great potential. 
Papaya cubes treated with sanitizing agent 
(dipped in 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite 
for 5 min) and antioxidant (soaked in 5% 
w/v citric acid for 30 s) and packed in 
19  μm semipermeable film and kept at 
5  ± 1°C, 85% relative humidity, can be 
stored up to 16 days with the colour, fla￾vour, taste and quality of the fruit intact 
(Singh et al., 2010).
1.3.5 Beverages
Formulation of different types of papaya 
juice blend (with mango, guava, lime) and 
nectars have been reported by different re￾searchers. A blend of 15% papaya and 15% 
mango nectars has been reported to have 
high acceptability (Mostafa et al., 1997). 
The process of beverage preparation in￾volves peeling and macerating peeled tissue 
in 25% water, straining through a 0.8 mm 
sieve, adjustment of the pH of the juice with 
citric acid and flavour adjustment with su￾crose. For acceptability the fresh juice 
should be maintained at pH 3.9 and 10% 
sucrose (w/v). Heating for 6 min at 72 ± 2°C 
is required to achieve commercial pasteur￾ization. Adding sodium benzoate (125 
mg/100 ml) extended the shelf life up to 80 
weeks at 30°C (Okoli and Ezenweke, 1990).
Nectar produced with 37.5% papaya 
pulp, 7.5% passion fruit juice and 5% ace￾rola pulp with 15% sucrose added had a 
high vitamin C content and presented good 
sensory acceptance suggesting commercial 
potential (Matsura et al., 2004).
1.3.6 Papain
Papaya contains significant amounts of the 
proteolytic enzymes papain and chymopapa￾in. They have diverse uses as meat tenderizers, 
digestive medicine, in brewing applications, 
the manufacture of chewing gums, and in 
pharmaceutical applications in the skincare 
and tanning industry (Nakasone and Paull, 
1998). The mountain papaya (genus Vas￾concellea) is a potential source of papain 
(Drew et al., 1997). The pericarp of the fruit 
is composed of laticifers which develop 
close to the vascular bundles. The laticifers 
are ramified throughout the fruit. They secrete 
latex which contains papain. The papain is 
extracted from the fully grown unripe fruit 
by making superficial and longitudinal inci￾sions in the fruit; the white liquid that drips 
from the fruit is called latex. Latex is col￾lected and sun dried or dried in chambers 
until the moisture content is reduced to 5% 
or 8%, and this is known as crude papain 
(Jacquet et al., 1989). Fruits should be tapped 
at intervals of about 4–7 days. Latex is col￾lected in steel/glass trays. The latex is stored 
at -20°C after adding NaOH at 0.3 M to avoid 
oxidation. Before being used by the food in￾dustry, crude papain is purified by precipi￾tation of papain with an organic solvent. 
The yield of crude papain from raw green 
papaya is reported to be around 0.025% 
(Nanjundaswamy and Mahadeviah, 1993).
Papain from papaya latex is purified by 
removal of material insoluble in the extract at 
pH 9.0, an ammonium sulfate precipitation 
by three recrystallizations. Kimmel and Smith 
(1954) stated that the resulting protein con￾tains three components: (i) active papain; 
(ii) activatable papain; and (iii) non-activat￾able papain. In active papain, the thiol 
group is fully reduced. Activatable papain, 
which itself is inactive, can be converted to 
active papain by reaction with thiols. How￾ever, non-activatable papain cannot by acti￾vated to an enzymatically active material 
by addition of thiols (Kimmel and Smith,

1954). The crude papain is purified by dis￾solving in water and precipiting with alco￾hol (Rehm and Read, 1986).
1.4 Conclusion
Increasing evidence points to the fact that 
Mexico and Central America are the centre of 
origin of C. papaya. In fact, it is only in Yuca￾tán, Mexico and some places in Central Amer￾ica where wild C. papaya populations can be 
found. The fruit of C. papaya was consumed 
by Mayan pre-Hispanic civilizations and they 
also used it for its curative properties.
It appears that the Spanish brought this 
fruit to Asia and Europe since the 16th cen￾tury. Since then, it has been grown in most 
tropical countries throughout the world. 
The importance of papaya has increased 
greatly in the last decade, and it is now the 
third most consumed fruit worldwide.
It can be expected that this trend of in￾creasing production and consumption of 
papaya will be maintained in future years, 
as there is increasing evidence that this fruit 
is not only accepted for its organoleptic 
properties but it also appears that its routine 
consumption may assist the consumer in 
preventing the occurrence of important dis￾eases such as diabetes.

2.1 Introduction
Global production of tropical fruits is on the 
rise due to a combination of increased area 
cultivated and yield. World papaya produc￾tion has grown by about 27.8%, from 10.11 
million t in 2008 to nearly 13.02 million t in 
2017. Despite the increase in production, 
supply continues to be constrained by Pa￾paya ringspot virus (PRSV) which is endemic 
in most of the main papaya production 
areas. Although transgenic papaya cultivars 
tolerant to PRSV have been developed, wide￾spread adoption of these cultivars has been 
stymied due to various regulations and con￾sumer acceptance of these varieties.
Most of the global papaya production is 
consumed in the producing countries, with 
less than 3% traded on the international mar￾kets. None the less, during the period 2007 
to 2016, papaya exports increased by 28.66% 
to 356,950 t from 277,446 t in the previous 
period. In value terms, this represents the 
third highest growth rate of all tropical fruit, 
behind avocados and mangoes.
Based on the data for the period 2014–
2016, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil have 
dominated the papaya export market, ac￾counting for almost 68% of the export trade. 
On the import side of the trade, the USA, 
Singapore and Canada have been the top 
importing countries, accounting for about 
68% of the import trade.
Ethnicity is an important demographic 
factor driving papaya demand in the main 
importing countries, with Asian and His￾panic consumers showing the greatest pro￾pensity for purchasing papaya, no doubt 
due to their familiarity with the fruit. Pro￾motion and advertising activities in key 
export markets are needed to strengthen 
demand for the fruit and to improve prices. 
Getting papaya into the mainstream market 
will require targeting consumers worldwide 
on the health benefits associated with the 
fruit.
This chapter presents an overview of 
the world production, export, import and 
consumption trends of papaya in the US 
and European Union (EU) markets.
2.2 Global Production, Trade 
and Consumption
2.2.1 Global production
Global papaya production has increased at 
an annual rate of 3.20%, from 10.11 million t 
in 2008 to 13.02 million t in 2017. Significant

factors that have fostered increased produc￾tion include increases in harvest area and 
rising yield at average annual growth rates 
of 1.51% and 1.48%, respectively (Fig. 2.1). 
Asia is the leading production region for 
papaya, accounting for 54.98% of total world 
production during the period 2008–2017, 
followed by the Americas and the Caribbean 
(33.46%), Africa (11.43%) and Oceania 
(0.12%) (FAO, 2019).
Papayas are grown in almost 60 coun￾tries worldwide, yet production remains 
highly concentrated. The top three papaya￾producing countries, accounting for 60.78% 
of global production between 2015 and 
2017, are India (43.13%), Brazil (10.35%) 
and Mexico (7.30%), respectively. Other 
major producing countries and their shares 
include Indonesia (6.87%), Nigeria (6.65%), 
the Dominican Republic (6.50%), the Demo￾cratic Republic of the Congo (1.69%), Colombia 
(1.39%), Thailand (1.35%) and the Philip￾pines (1.31%), respectively (Table 2.1).
Several different papaya cultivars are 
grown for consumption in domestic markets. 
For international markets, ‘Solo’ and ‘Mara￾dol’ are the main papaya cultivars traded. 
The ‘Solo’ cultivars are relatively small, 
weighing from 250 g to 500 g, while the 
‘Maradol’ cultivar is much larger, weighing 
from 1000 g to 2000 g or more.
Because of the growing interest in func￾tional food products, the opportunity to 
increase the market for papaya exists. The 
fruit is rich in antioxidants (carotenes, vita￾min C and flavonoids), B vitamins (folate 
and pantothenic acid), minerals (potassium 
and magnesium) and fibre (Mahattanatawee 
et al., 2006). In addition to its nutritional 
properties, the fruit is also rich in bioactive 
phytochemicals, which have the potential 
to be used in combating cancer (Nguyen et al., 
2013). Papaya is a very versatile fruit that 
can be used in different culinary prepar￾ations as both green and ripe fruit. Green 
papayas are used in South-east Asia, where 
they are consumed as raw and cooked fruit. 
Raw green papayas are suitable for salads 
because of their cucumber-like texture and 
mild flavour.
PRSV disease is the main factor limit￾ing papaya production worldwide. PRSV, 
which is transmitted by several species of 
aphids, is universally recognized as a very 
serious threat in tropical and subtropical 
papaya-growing areas. Severity of the dis￾ease ranges from significant decline in fruit 
production to total loss of the crop. Conven￾tional disease management strategies, such 
as the use of insecticides, removal and de￾struction of diseased plants and quarantine 
regulations, have had limited success in

controlling the disease, resulting in papaya 
plantations with a shorter productive lifespan.
Because of the limited success of trad￾itional disease management practices, re￾searchers have turned to plant genetic 
engineering to reduce the impact of PRSV 
disease. In 1992, PRSV was first discovered 
in Hawaii; by 1997, Hawaii’s papaya pro￾duction was reduced by half. As part of the 
effort to save the industry and prevent the 
spread of the disease, the transgenic papaya 
line ‘55-1’ was obtained to develop the 
Hawaiian papaya cultivars ‘SunUp’ and ‘Rain￾bow’. The ‘Rainbow’ hybrid has proved to 
be highly resistant to PRSV, and possesses 
desirable production and marketing attri￾butes. In 1998, seeds of the new transgenic 
papaya cultivars were released for commercial 
use in Hawaii (Gonsalves and Gonsalves, 2007).
Before the commercial release of the 
transgenic papaya cultivars in Hawaii, Japan 
was the main export market for Hawaiian 
papayas. Once the commercial production 
of transgenic papayas started in Hawaii, 
they were banned from the Japanese market 
for over a decade. After years of extensive 
testing, Japan finally approved imports of 
Hawaiian transgenic papayas in 2012 (The 
Packer, 2012).
Due to seed licensing agreements, 
transgenic Hawaiian papaya cultivars were 
restricted to Hawaii only. As a result of this 
restriction, Australia, Jamaica, Venezuela, 
Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philip￾pines developed their own transgenic papaya 
cultivars using PRSV strains from their own 
geographic regions (Fermin et al., 2010).
Global adoption of transgenic papaya 
cultivars remains very low; challenges asso￾ciated with the development of commercial 
cultivars and consumer acceptance remain 
major obstacles for the expansion of trans￾genic papaya cultivation. A recent assess￾ment of the adoption of transgenic papayas 
indicated that in 2016, the global economic 
benefit of the transgenic papaya trait to the 
growers was estimated at US$1.3 million 
(ISAAA, 2017).
2.2.2 Global trade exports and imports
Most of the global papaya production is 
sold on the domestic market in the produ￾cing countries. For example, in 2016, only 
about 2.72% of the global papaya produc￾tion, valued at US$276.9 million, was sold 
on the international markets. Despite the 
small percentage of production allocated to 
exports, trends in export volume and value 
have exhibited significant growth. Papaya 
exports grew from 277,446 t in 2007 to 
356,950 t in 2016, an overall increase of 
28.66%. Export value increased by 49.92%,

from US$184.7 million in 2007 to US$276.9 
million in 2016 (FAO, 2019).
During the period, 2014–2016, Mexico 
dominated the papaya export market (44.90%), 
followed by Guatemala (11.72%) and Brazil 
(11.21%), respectively (Table 2.2). These 
top three exporting countries accounted for 
67.83% of the papaya export trade, suggest￾ing a highly concentrated market. Other 
significant papaya-exporting countries and 
their shares include Malaysia (7.33%), the 
USA (3.96%), India (3.53%), Belize (3.31%), 
China (2.38%), the Netherlands (2.21%) 
and Ecuador (1.21%), respectively. It is worth 
mentioning that the Netherlands re-exports 
papayas to other countries in the EU, hence 
its presence among the top papaya exporters.
Trends in papaya supply from Central 
American countries reveal a shifting market. 
Guatemalan papaya exports increased by 
more than 600% during the period 2007–
2016, from 6,680 t in 2007 to 49,421 t in 2016. 
At the same time, exports from Belize dras￾tically decreased, with supply volume in 2016 
being 89.79% lower than in 2007, due to 
bad weather events and a changing business 
environment. As a result, papaya production 
has shifted from Belize to Guatemala (Ramos, 
2014; P. Brooks, Homestead, Florida, 2019, 
personal communication).
Consistent with the global growth of 
tropical fruit imports, papaya import volume 
grew by 38.28%, from 254,171 t in 2007 to 
351,462 t in 2016, resulting in an average 
annual growth rate of 4.25%. Import value 
increased by 38.39%, from US$236.8 million 
in 2007 to US$327.7 million in 2016. The 
USA has been the leading papaya importer, 
accounting for 56% of total imports during 
the period 2014–2016, followed by Singapore 
(7.53%) and Canada (4.82%), respectively 
(Table 2.3). Other prominent papaya-importing 
countries include El Salvador (4.64%), 
Germany (3.53%), the Netherlands (3.48%), 
United Arab Emirates (3.09%), Portugal 
(2.24%), Spain (2.02%) and the UK (2.00%), 
respectively (FAO, 2019).
2.3 US Papaya Market
2.3.1 US production
The USA is a net papaya importer because 
domestic production volume does not sat￾isfy the demand for the fruit. US commercial 
papaya production takes place in Hawaii 
and Florida, along with some marginal pro￾duction in California and Texas. In general, 
Hawaii produces ‘Solo’ (e.g. ‘SunUp’, ‘Rain￾bow’ and ‘Sunrise’) papaya cultivars, while 
Florida produces the ‘Maradol’ papaya culti￾var. The Hawaiian papaya industry has con￾tracted as result of high input and labour 
costs, and low crop returns. The papaya￾bearing area in Hawaii has decreased by 
20.28%, from 558.4 ha in 2008 to 445.15 ha in

2017. That same year, papaya production 
reached 11,611 t (USDA-NASS, 2019). 
Hawaii’s papaya production goes to the US 
mainland, particularly cities on the west 
coast, and to international markets in Can￾ada, Hong Kong and Japan. Fresh papaya 
exports from Hawaii were valued at US$7.17 
million in 2017 (USDA-FAS, 2019).
In 2017, the Florida papaya production 
area (Miami-Dade County) was estimated at 
152 ha (J. Crane, Homestead, Florida, 2018, 
personal communication). Florida markets 
both green papayas (sought by Asian con￾sumers) and ripe papayas. The Florida pa￾paya industry is in decline due to increased 
competition from Mexico, higher production 
costs and the lack of PRSV-tolerant cultivars.
2.3.2 US imports
US total papaya imports (fresh and processed) 
grew by 52.91%, from 132,825 t in 2008 to 
203,102 t in 2017 (Fig. 2.2). At the same time, 
import value increased by 42.50%, from 
US$84.7 million in 2008 to almost US$120.7 
million in 2017. The bulk of the imports 
consisted of fresh papayas, with only about 
6% of the volume being processed fruit. 
Fresh papaya imports have grown at an an￾nual rate of 6.29%, from 124,355 t in 2008 
to 194,759 t in 2017. Over the same period, 
import value increased at an annual rate of 
5.30%, from US$72.3 million to US$106.8 
million. US imports of processed papaya 
have fluctuated from a high of 13,405 t in 
2014 to a low of 8,343 t in 2017 with import 
value of processed papayas reaching US$13.90 
million in 2017. Preserved papaya and frozen 
papaya are the main products imported 
within the processed papaya category.
Mexico is by far the largest supplier of 
fresh papayas to the US market, accounting 
for 80.25% of the total imports during the 
period 2015–2017, followed by Guatemala 
(14.74%), Belize (3.07%), Brazil (1.34%) 
and Jamaica (0.33%), respectively (Table 2.4). 
During the period 2008–2017, papaya imports 
from Guatemala rapidly increased at an 
average annual rate of 88%. Meanwhile, im￾ports from Belize severely decreased, from 
28,170 t in 2008 to just 1,509 t in 2017.
Cost, insurance and freight (CIF) prices 
for selected exporters of fresh papayas 
fluctuated during the period 2013–2017 
(Table 2.5). During this period, Mexico, 
Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and 
Belize exported the lower price ‘Maradol’ 
papaya cultivar, while Brazil and Jamaica 
exported the higher price ‘Solo’ papaya 
cultivars. CIF prices for ‘Maradol’ papayas 
fluctuated from a low of US$0.51 kg-1 in 
2015 to a high value of US$0.97 kg-1 in 2016 
(Mexico was the lowest cost supplier of 
‘Maradol’ papayas to the US market). Prices

2.3.3 US consumption
US fruit consumption has undergone signifi￾cant changes in recent years as consumers 
have year-round access to a wider variety of 
fruit. During the period 2008–2017, per-capita 
consumption of some traditional fruits de￾creased (Fig. 2.3). For example, consumption 
of oranges followed a downward pattern, 
decreasing by about 1% from 9.06 lb in 2008 
to 8.41 lb in 2017. In contrast, per-capita 
consumption of tropical fruits have increased; 
consumption of mango and pineapple increased

by 53.33% and 54.38%, respectively, followed 
by an increase in papaya consumption of 
38.78% from 0.98 lb in 2008 to 1.36 lb in 
2017 (USDA-ERS, 2018).
Different papaya cultivars are sold in the 
US market. In terms of volume, ‘Maradol’ is 
by far the predominant cultivar, followed by 
the ‘Solo’ and ‘Tainung’ cultivars, respect￾ively. Ethnicity is an important demographic 
factor driving papaya consumption in the 
USA, as Asian and Hispanic groups continue 
to increase in the US population.
Food safety remains a critical issue for 
US papaya consumers, major Salmonella 
outbreaks linked to papaya occurred in 
2011 and 2017 (US-FDA, 2017). As a result of 
the 2011 outbreak, papayas from Mexico are 
now screened for Salmonella at the border.
2.3.4 US wholesale and retail prices
Prices at the wholesale level for the ‘Maradol’ 
and ‘Solo’ papaya cultivars are presented for the 
US west and east coast markets. Los Angeles is 
selected as a representative market for the west 
coast while New York City is selected as a rep￾resentative market for the east coast. Figure 2.4

Hawaii (USDA-AMS, 2019).
Using US average retail prices for ‘Mara￾dol’/‘Tainung’ and ‘Solo’ papayas from 2015 to 
2017, ‘Solo’ papayas have commanded higher 
prices over ‘Maradol’/‘Tainung’ papayas in 
the US market (Fig. 2.6). Retail prices for ‘Solo’ 
papayas have been noticeably volatile, reach￾ing a high of US$1.95 lb-1 in April 2015. The 
average retail price for ‘Solo’ papayas during 
the period 2015–2017 was about US$1.49 
lb-1. Prices for ‘Solo’ papayas increased by

2.4 EU Papaya Market
Imports of papaya into the EU fluctuated 
over the period 2008–2017, ranging from a 
low of 37,700 t in 2012 to a high of 59,700 t 
in 2017. The EU market for papayas is 
highly concentrated, with the top five im￾porting countries accounting for 82.38% of 
total imports over the period 2015–2017 
(Table 2.6). During the period 2015–2017, 
the primary EU importer of papayas was the 
Netherlands with a market share of 21.86%, 
followed closely by Germany (21.21%). As 
previously noted, the Netherlands is a 
re-exporter of papaya in the EU, which ex￾plains its prominence as the top importing 
country. Portugal, Spain and the UK were 
also among the top importing countries in 
the EU, with market shares of 14.02%, 
13.02% and 12.26%, respectively.

The value of papaya imports increased 
at a faster rate than quantity demanded 
during the period 2008–2017. Import value 
increased by 54.89%, from €75.02 million 
in 2008 to €116.2 million in 2017 (Table 2.7). 
The Netherlands is the leading importer of 
papaya in terms of volume, while France is 
the main importer in terms of value. During 
the period 2015–2017, France accounted for 
23.4% of papaya import value in the EU, 
followed by Spain (16.24%), Sweden 
(14.59%), Germany (12.55%) and the Neth￾erlands (12.22%).
Brazil is the predominant fresh papaya 
supplier to the EU market. In 2017, Brazil 
exported about 40,000 t of papayas, valued 
at €87 million (Fig. 2.7). Thailand and Ecua￾dor also supply the fruit but at a much lower 
volume. Costa Rica and Mexico are new 
entrants to the EU market (CBI, 2018). Given 
the dominance of Brazil in the EU market, 
‘Solo’ papayas are the most popular cultivar 
marketed.
It is important to note that the EU does 
not allow imports of transgenic papayas. The 
main varieties marketed on the EU market are

the ‘Solo’ cultivars ‘Sunrise’ and ‘Golden’ for 
small fruits up to 700 g, and ‘Formosa’ for 
large fruits above 1 kg. European consumers 
tend to prefer smaller papayas, particularly 
in north-western Europe. The ‘Formosa’ cul￾tivar is often sold as well, due to its longer 
shelf life and good flavour (CBI, 2018).
2.5 Market Outlook
Despite the noticeable rise in global demand 
for papaya, production issues, particularly 
PRSV disease, remains a major obstacle to 
increase the supply of the fruit, because of 
the disease growth in papaya production 
has lagged behind other tropical fruits such 
as mangoes and pineapples.
Although there is a niche market for 
organic papaya, especially in the USA, be￾cause of the severity of the PRSV disease, 
major scale production of organic papayas 
remains an elusive target. While the use of 
transgenic papaya cultivars represents an 
opportunity to overcome the PRSV disease, 
there are still major obstacles related to 
commercial cultivar development and consumer 
acceptance of these new papaya cultivars. 
In addition, papaya producers have adapted 
by managing papaya plantations with a short￾er productive life due to the PRSV disease.
Promotion and advertising activities tout￾ing the health benefits of papayas are needed 
to strengthen demand for the fruit and im￾prove prices in export markets. This approach 
may be useful to target consumers from ethnic 
groups other than Asians and Hispanics.
Countries such as Mexico and Guatemala 
have been responsive to opportunities in the 
US import papaya market, given their close 
proximity to the USA. These countries are ac￾tively promoting the production and trade of 
the fruit, resulting in improved economic 
conditions in the growing areas and increases 
in export revenue.
Because of the wide use of papaya in 
different culinary preparations, processed 
papayas may represent an interesting alter￾native for countries with a desire to diversify 
their papaya industry, add value to their 
exports, and increase demand for papaya in 
international markets.

3.1 Introduction
Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is the only species 
of its genus, one of six genera in the family 
Caricaceae, which includes at least 34 spe￾cies (Carvalho and Renner, 2012). The nat￾ural distribution range goes from northern 
Mexico to Costa Rica, from where it was fur￾ther dispersed by the Spaniards in the 16th 
century, first to neighbouring islands and 
then to tropical South America. Later on, 
papaya was brought to Indonesia and other 
tropical Asian countries, and finally to Africa 
by European colonists (Chávez-Pesqueira 
and Núñez-Farfán, 2017). Current distribu￾tion to tropical environments is restricted 
by its susceptibility to chilling temperatures 
(Pradhan et al., 2019). Domestication led to 
morphological and physiological changes 
(e.g. smaller plants bearing larger fruits with 
increasing pulp fraction) and development of 
hermaphroditism in this originally dioecious 
crop (Chávez-Pesqueira and Núñez-Farfán, 
2017). This plasticity and the existing gen￾etic diversity ultimately led to the current 
situation, with many different papaya var￾ieties being cultivated around the world 
(Moore, 2014).
The papaya plant is a fast-growing, single￾stemmed, semi-woody herb with a lifespan 
of up to 20 years, although it is usually con￾strained to 2–3 years in commercial orchards. 
The plant flowers 3–8 months after seed ger￾mination (Saran et al., 2016). Once it starts 
flowering, vegetative growth, flowers and 
fruits frequently coexist simultaneously 
(Jiménez et al., 2014). This is a pioneer spe￾cies that rapidly colonizes disturbed sites, 
where wild accessions and high diversity 
are still possible to be found (Brown et al., 
2012; Nafus et al., 2018).
3.2 Taxonomy
3.2.1 Phylogeny of the Caricaceae
Papaya is part of the order Brassicales (which 
also includes Arabidopsis), where the Cari￾caceae is one of 17 families (Kanchana￾udomkan et al., 2014). The sister family of 
the Caricaceae is the Moringaceae (Carval￾ho et al., 2015). It seems that the Caricaceae
originated in Africa and later on it dispersed 
to the neotropics. Cylicomorpha parviflora
(a large tree from East Africa) and Cylico￾morpha solmsii (from West Africa) are the 
closest relatives to the New World Caricaceae. 
The other five genera in the family (compris￾ing 34–35 species) are Carica, Horovitzia,

Jarilla, Jacaratia and Vasconcellea (Carval￾ho and Renner, 2012). Vasconcellea species, 
of Andean origin and commonly referred 
to as ‘highland papayas’, were previously 
positioned within the genus Carica, and 
considered as the closest relatives to C. pa￾paya; however, the studies of Badillo (2000), 
later on confirmed with molecular data, showed 
that Vasconcellea was more related to Jaca￾ratia and identified Horovitzia (endemic to 
southern Mexico) and Jarilla (endemic of 
Mexico and Guatemala) as sisters of papaya. 
This also points to Mexico and Guatemala 
as a possible domestication origin area. The 
genus Vasconcellea was, consequently, re￾habilitated and C. papaya stayed as the sole 
species in the genus Carica (reviewed by 
Carvalho and Renner, 2014). Vasconcellea
remained then the largest genus in the fam￾ily Caricaceae (Carvalho and Renner, 2012).
Additional genetic studies, based on the 
ploidy levels found within the clade, showed 
that the African genus Cylicomorpha has 
the same chromosome number as papaya 
(2n = 18), while in the case of Horovitzia 
cnidoscoloides and Jarilla caudata the 
chromosome numbers are 2n = 16 and 
2n = 14, respectively. Moreover, phylogeny 
studies indicate occurrence of dysploidy 
events ~16.6 and ~5.5 million years ago and, 
in the case of Jarilla, a doubling of genome size 
took place as well (~450 Mbp to 830–920 
Mbp per haploid genome). C. papaya and 
Horovitzia have smaller genomes than other 
Caricaceae (442.5 Mbp and 401 Mbp, respect￾ively), while J. caudata has the largest gen￾ome (924 Mbp). All members of the family 
Caricaceae are diploid and to date no evi￾dence of polyploids is available (Rockinger 
et al., 2016).
3.2.2 Papaya diversity
Early studies conducted on papaya taxonomy 
employed isozymes, restriction fragment 
length polymorphisms (RFLPs), nuclear in￾ternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid 
sequences. Nowadays with the development 
of molecular tools and high-throughput 
sequencing, taxonomy studies are faster and 
yield much more data. Sequencing of the 
papaya genome (Ming et al., 2008a) sped up 
the development of tools for molecular ana￾lysis of papaya diversity and confirmed and 
generated new sets of microsatellites for that 
purpose (Chen et al., 2007; de Oliveira et al., 
2010) that subsequently allowed quantita￾tive trait loci (QTL) studies to be conducted 
(Blas et al., 2012). In addition, more recent 
analyses were conducted with morphological 
and molecular markers such as simple 
sequence repeats (SSR) and inter-simple 
sequence repeats (ISSR) to study the genetic 
diversity in mountain papaya (Vasconcellea
spp.) populations (Warnakula et al., 2017). 
Moreover, genotyping by sequencing has 
allowed robust genotype information in other 
species to be quickly obtained and, hopefully, 
will be soon implemented in papaya genetic 
diversity and genome-wide association 
studies (Elshire et al., 2011; Ott et al., 2017).
The main traits that have been studied in 
papaya are plant size, fruit size, sex types and 
morphology, and seed germination (Chávez￾Pesqueira and Núñez-Farfán, 2017). Variation 
in fruit size is considerable and it might be 
the result of the popularity of small fruit, like 
in the ‘Solo’ cultivars weighing from 300 g to 
650 g, and in the ‘Formosa’ varieties weighing 
from 1000 g to 1300 g (de Oliveira et al., 2012). 
Even QTLs for fruit size have been identified 
using crosses from small and medium-size 
fruits (Blas et al., 2012). Other interesting 
mutations in papaya key traits are the ones 
that confer a higher proportion of hermaph￾rodite individuals (Mora-Newcomer and 
Bogantes-Arias, 2005; Chen et al., 2019).
Additional research has been conducted 
in papaya and Vasconcellea (Van Droogen￾broeck et al., 2004) to study the presence of 
resistance gene analogues (Sengupta et al., 
2014). In the future, sequencing and use of 
Horovitzia and Jarilla may provide relevant 
information regarding diversity, evolution 
and domestication of papaya. For a review 
on papaya domestication please refer to 
Chávez-Pesqueira and Núñez-Farfán (2017).
3.2.3 Commercial importance and breeding
The world papaya production increased 
from 10.8 million tonnes (Mt) in 2010 to 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditions26 V.M. Jiménez et al.
13.0 Mt in 2017. The major producers in 2017 
were India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, the 
Dominican Republic and Nigeria, account￾ing for nearly 10 Mt (FAOSTAT, 2019). 
While C. papaya is mainly commercialized 
as fresh fruit or ready-to-eat products and 
purées, Vasconcellea spp. fruits are mostly 
used as a source of the proteolytic enzyme 
papain (with values up to 17 times higher 
than in common papaya) and are commer￾cialized as fresh and processed fruits in a 
growing but smaller niche market (Schelde￾man et al., 2011). Due to the increasing trade, 
papaya breeding is also gaining importance. 
In addition to the long-standing breeding 
programmes in Hawaii, South Africa, Cuba, 
Taiwan and Australia (that delivered the well￾known varieties of the ‘Solo’ type, such as 
‘Sunset’, ‘Sunrise’ and ‘SunUp’, as well as 
‘Maradol’ and ‘Tainung’, among others), emer￾ging ventures have started in Costa Rica (the 
University of Costa Rica in cooperation 
with the Instituto Nacional de Innovación y 
Transferencia en Tecnología Agropecuaria 
(INTA) developed the ‘Pococi’ hybrid), 
Mexico (Semillas del Caribe and Carigen), 
the Philippines (East-West Seed) and Brazil 
(Rubisco Sementes).
3.3 Botany
3.3.1 Plant architecture
The single-stemmed papaya plant has an 
orthotropic indeterminate growth, and seldom 
branches when the apical bud remains intact. 
It can grow 1–3 m in the first year and barely 
surpasses 10 m when growing wild and 5–6 m 
under cultivation. The species is character￾ized by its large palmate-shaped leaves with 
long petioles. Axillary buds can produce female 
flowers and male inflorescences (in diclinous 
usually wild individuals), as well as hermaph￾roditic flowers (generally as consequence of 
domestication) (Jiménez et al., 2014).
3.3.2 The stem
Papaya is not a true tree because it does 
not have a lignified secondary xylem and, 
therefore, does not comply with the botanical 
definition of wood. The usually unbranched 
and cylindrical stem, with large and protu￾berant superficial scars denoting the position 
of the fallen leaves and flowers, offers struc￾tural support to the plant’s aerial organs and, 
because of its characteristics (spongy fibrous, 
loose and hollow), also serves as transport 
and storage structure for water, nutrients, 
diverse organic substances and signalling 
compounds. Additional characteristics found 
in papaya adult plants, such as the stem 
diameter (10–30 cm at the base and 5–10 cm 
at the crown) and density (c.0.13 g cm-3) 
help to support the entire plant weight. This 
support partially relies on the stem anatomy, 
mainly formed by parenchymatous tissue, 
in which the secondary growth is composed 
only by interspersed lignified xylem con￾duits embedded in parenchyma, which is 
enclosed circumferentially by the secondary 
phloem. The latter forms a mesh of lignified 
phloem fibres embedded in parenchyma. 
The arrangement of the secondary growth in 
papaya led to a very unusual functional 
anatomy: since the phloem is located at the 
periphery of the stem, it can sustain bending 
tension forces, while at the same time the 
xylem parenchyma, which is much larger 
than the phloem, plays an essential role in 
the mechanical performance and can with￾stand the compression and shear forces of 
the oval stem through a high turgor pressure 
(Kempe et al., 2014b). The poorly lignified 
xylem helps storing water and starch (Jimé￾nez et al., 2014; Kempe et al., 2014b; Saran 
et al., 2016).
As mentioned above, papaya plants rarely 
form axillary branches (Ono et al., 2004; 
Kempe et al., 2014a). This is the result of a 
strong apical dominance that can only be 
eliminated by removing the apical buds in 
mature plants (Texeira-da Silva et al., 2007), 
but that does not occur in juvenile plants 
without applying growth regulators (Ono 
et al., 2004). Once the plant starts flowering, 
each axillary node displays flowers, limiting 
the possibility that the axillary meristem 
develops into a vegetative ramification. The 
stem colour varies from greenish-light grey 
or greyish-brown to green with shades of 
red-purple pigmentation (Rieger, 2006, 2009).

Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsTaxonomy, Botany and Plant Development 27
As mentioned above, the stem exhibits 
a considerable turgor pressure. High water 
transport and phloem translocation capacity 
sustain not only growth, but also the high 
gas exchange rates observed in the field, 
which go along with the xylem sap flow, the 
source:sink quotients and annotations on 
the hydraulic architecture of papaya plants 
(Jiménez et al., 2014).
3.3.3 The leaves
The leaves are palmately lobed or deeply 
incised, with between five and nine pinnate 
lobes, arranged spirally; the blades are usu￾ally large (40–80 cm). Papaya cultivars can be 
distinguished by several phenotypic char￾acteristics, including leaf main veins, num￾ber of lobes at the leaf margin, leaf shape, 
and the colour of the leaf petiole, which are 
probably influenced by climatic conditions 
(Rieger, 2006; Texeira-da Silva et al., 2007). 
In this sense, Rieger (2009) found that papaya 
plants growing on the Caribbean (tropical 
humid) side of Costa Rica have leaves with 
overlapping lobes, narrow margins and few 
sinuses, while on the Pacific side (tropical 
dry), leaves had larger lobes, wider margins 
and more sinuses. The length of the petioles 
varied from 0.3 m to 1.2 m, with a thickness 
of 0.5–1.5 cm, and their colour fluctuated 
from dark green to red-purple, also influ￾enced by the climatic conditions (Rieger, 
2009; Saran et al., 2016).
Papaya leaves only have one layer of 
palisade mesophyll cells and four to five 
layers of loosely arranged and attached cells 
with irregular shape that create intercellular 
spaces. Stomata are located only on the leaf 
underside (hypostomatic), with a density of 
approximately 400 mm-2 on sun-lit leaves 
but with variations according to light, water 
and heat conditions (Saran et al., 2016). 
Chloroplasts are comparatively large with 
dense grana. The leaves also contain star￾shaped crystals called druses, mainly located 
in the vascular bundle and within the vacu￾oles of the lower mesophyll cells (Shai et al., 
1986). In addition, the anti-proliferative 
effects of several papaya leaf sub-fractions 
(found using automatic semi-preparative 
high performance liquid chromatography) on 
prostate cancer cells has been documented 
(Pandey et al., 2018).
3.3.4 The root system
The fibrous root system usually consists of 
one or two taproots measuring 0.5–1.0 m in 
length, with superficial secondary roots 
branching profusely. Size, number, distribu￾tion and orientation of the roots adapt 
throughout the plant’s life and to the soil 
properties, reflecting the plant’s plasticity. 
Relevance of mycorrhizas for papaya nutri￾tion has been confirmed, with higher respon￾siveness in the female plants (Jiménez et al., 
2014).
As with the stem, most of the root tissue 
is parenchymatous, and the secondary xylem 
is diffusely porous with indistinct growth 
rings. Only xylem vessels are lignified and 
have a simple transverse perforation plate 
with alternate bordered pits on lateral walls. 
Vessels are found to be mostly solitary, but 
on rare occasions they occur in radial mul￾tiples. A distinct cambial zone separates the 
secondary xylem from the phloem. Ligni￾fied fibres are observed only in the phloem, 
while the phloem rays enlarge and became 
more dilated as they progress towards the 
periphery of the roots (Rao et al., 2013).
An interesting aspect is the presence of 
articulated laticifers (latex secretory cells 
joined together) with thicker walls, in 
the xylem and among ray cells, but not in the 
phloem. While these laticifers are found iso￾lated in the mature secondary xylem, they are 
articulated and anastomosing in the early 
stages of differentiation (Rao et al., 2013).
Diversity in root system architecture 
and functioning has been exploited in the 
selection of both dwarfing and vigorizing 
rootstocks, suitable for greenhouse and field 
production, respectively. Dwarfing root sys￾tems seem to have a reduced number of 
xylem vessels, which also tend to be of 
smaller diameters. This is functionally ex￾pressed in restriction of the hydraulic cap￾acity of the root, which affects the transport

of sap, nutrients and hormones acropetally, 
and causes reductions in gas exchange, carbon 
gain and overall plant growth. Vigorizing 
rootstocks, by contrast, show extraordinary 
development and distribution down the soil 
profile, and confer tolerance to various soil￾induced stresses (Fisher and Mueller, 1983; 
Marler and Discekici, 1997).
3.3.5 The seeds
Papaya seeds, up to 600 in a well-pollinated 
fruit, are located in the central cavity of the 
fruit, and are coated by a transparent gelatin￾ous layer. They have an ovoid shape and black￾brown colour at maturity, with an average 
size between 4 mm and 6 mm (Gil and Mi￾randa, 2005; Rieger, 2006). Internally, the 
seeds are composed of three structures: (i) the 
seedcoat; (ii) the endosperm; and (iii) the em￾bryo. The seedcoat originates from the 
seminal rudiment and has two teguments. 
The external tegument forms the mucilagi￾nous exotesta (also termed the sarcotesta), 
the mesotesta (dark brown, rough and hard) 
and the endotesta, while tissues from the in￾ternal tegument are the origin of the tegmen. 
The hilum is conspicuous, round shaped 
and with a clear yellow colour. The proxim￾ity of the micropyle to the hilum is due to 
its development from anatropous ovules 
(Gil and Miranda, 2005). The seeds are joined 
to the funiculum in a parietal position. The 
endosperm has a fleshy consistency and is 
considered external since it completely sur￾rounds the embryo (Webster et al., 2016). It 
is composed of cells with oil bodies and 
aleuronic grains, without starch at maturity 
(Texeira-da Silva et al., 2007). The expanded, 
flattened cotyledons do not cover the radicle 
(Gil and Miranda, 2005; Saran et al., 2016). 
According to Saran et al. (2016), several 
authors considered papaya seeds as recalci￾trant, while others reported an orthodox 
behaviour.
3.3.6 Sex determination
As mentioned above, wild papaya popula￾tions are dioecious (with male and female 
plants) and cultivated papayas are gynodio￾ecious (with hermaphrodite and female plants) 
(Yu et al., 2008). Papaya has been employed 
as a model organism for sex determination 
studies (Aryal and Ming, 2014), where sex 
differentiation is regulated by an emergent 
X-Y chromosome system, in which the Y 
chromosome bears a small region that spe￾cifically defines male (XY), female (XX) and 
hermaphrodite (XYh) genotypes (VanBuren 
et al., 2015). Hermaphrodite and male forms 
are heterozygous because any Y and/or Yh
combination is deleterious (Ming et al., 
2007). Analyses of this male specific region 
(MSY) were conducted in wild populations 
and cultivated hermaphrodites, and the se￾quence of a specific Y haplotype (referred to 
as MSY3, from wild populations in Costa 
Rica) pointed to the involvement of human 
beings in development of hermaphrodite 
papaya (VanBuren et al., 2015).
3.4 Development
Development of the papaya plant is the 
product of the organized and continuous ac￾tivity of apical and lateral meristems, which, 
in combination with ontogenetic changes in 
the nature of growth, permit the rapid unfold￾ing of a relatively simple crown of leaves 
at the top of a monocaulous stem (Kempe 
et al., 2014b). In this section, development is 
viewed as an emergent property of the fast 
and vigorous growth of the short vegetative 
phase, continued throughout an extended 
reproductive stage. The three already men￾tioned possible sex forms can differentiate 
in reproductive plants, while flowering and 
the continuous formation of fruits, at differ￾ent stages of development, continues until 
plant senescence (Ming et al., 2008b).
3.4.1 Germination
C. papaya seeds are readily permeable and

as a barrier because its removal accelerates 
germination (Webster et al., 2016). An add￾itional effect of ambient temperature has 
been observed, with higher temperatures 
(27–30°C) promoting superior germination 
rates, while lower temperatures (22–23°C) 
induced a kind of dormancy that needs to 
be broken for germination to occur (Toku￾hisa et al., 2008).
Stored and desiccated seeds frequently 
also enter into a state of coat-enhanced dor￾mancy, which reduces the embryo growth 
potential as well. This dormancy can be re￾leased through a heat shock (35°C for 1–4 h) 
but only after a period of water imbibition, 
which is an indispensable prerequisite. This 
treatment leads to de novo protein synthesis, 
which induces activity of cell wall hydrolysing 
enzymes that weaken the seedcoat, allowing 
an embryo with reduced growth potential to 
overcome the mechanical barrier of the seed￾coat (Webster et al., 2016).
Photosensitive seeds of wild papayas 
are dormant at maturity, being induced to 
germinate by changes in light quality near 
the ground (Paz and Vázquez-Yanes, 1998). 
Adequate water, light, oxygen, air tempera￾ture and humidity conditions allow papaya 
seed germination (Fig. 3.1A). Germination in 
papaya is epigeous and in 2–3 weeks emer￾gence is typically completed. Papaya seedlings 
exhibit foliaceous, exposed and persistent 
cotyledons, typical of species with small 
seeds, which in the absence of substantial 
reserves, display high photosynthetic rates 
that support fast seedling growth under full 
high radiation and shade avoidance in 
understories (Fisher, 1980).
3.4.2 Seedling and juvenile growth
Primary leaves of young seedlings become 
lobed only after the appearance of the second 
leaf (Fig. 3.1A). Papaya seedling growth is 
achieved through the continuous produc￾tion of leaves at the apex of the plant in a 
3/8 spiral phyllotaxy every week (Fisher, 
1980), indicating the existence of three par￾astichies within the stem, as evidenced by 
three leaves located at every 360° turn around 
the stem, and that eight leaves must be 
counted to find the next leaf best aligned 
above in the canopy. This spiral disposition 
of leaves, whose large blades are displayed 
at the tip of long petioles around the trunk 
(Fig. 3.1B), allows for highly efficient light 
interception within the papaya canopy (Fer￾raz et al., 2016). Leaves of juvenile plants are 
palmate and simple, and become progres￾sively larger (Fig. 3.1C).
Leaf loss in the lower section of the 
plant, in combination with continuous emer￾gence of new leaves at the tip, produce an 
umbrella-shaped crown that casts consider￾able shade underneath. Juvenile papaya plants 
develop quickly; it takes 3–8 months from 
germination to first flowering, and 9–15 
months to the first harvest (Paterson et al., 
2008). Leaf lifespan is 3–6 months, and leaf 
abscission is recorded by the permanence of 
persistent scars along the trunk (Fig. 3.1D).
Although papayas are considered to be 
pioneering plants in disturbed environ￾ments and, therefore, can grow under direct 
sunlight, seedlings have a high morpho￾logical plasticity, showing acclimatization 
to shading in traits like leaf mass per area, 
chlorophyll a/b ratio, stomatal density, 
internode length and degree of blade lob￾bing (Buisson and Lee, 1993). Papaya seed￾lings also show thigmomorphic responses 
to mechanical stimuli, producing touch￾regulated phenotypes (Fisher and Mueller, 
1983; Porter et al., 2009), with increased lig￾nification, compact architecture and the 
formation of petiole cork outgrowths (Clem￾ente and Marler, 2001; Porter et al., 2009).
3.4.3 Adult vegetative growth
Adult papaya plants conform to Corner’s 
architectural model (Hallé et al., 1978), in 
which vigorous vegetative growth produces 
one unbranched axis on which flowers differ￾entiate laterally in the axils of current leaves. 
Papaya growth is indeterminate; therefore, 
reproduction does not arrest stem extension 
and leaf production, and the plant does not 
suffer monocarpic senescence.
During maturation, pith at the internodes 
dissolves and, as a consequence, young

stems become progressively hollow (Fig. 
3.1D, E), together with fibre thickening and 
hardening (Carneiro and Cruz, 2009). Rigid￾ity relays, consequently, more in the inner 
layers, which also broaden to allow the stem 
to expand (Fisher, 1980). The size, quantity, 
distribution and orientation of the roots 
adapt to differences in the soil profile, and 
to various soils (Fig. 3.1F) (Fisher and Muel￾ler, 1983; Marler and Discekici, 1997).
Domestication of papaya has resulted 
in considerable variation in vegetative growth 
and sexual forms that distinguish cultivated 
genotypes from wild populations (Niklas 
and Marler, 2007). From the pioneer species 
characterized by traits such as reproductive 
precocity, fast growth, high rate of emission of 
short-lived leaves, low construction cost of 
hollow organs, production of many seeds, high 
reproductive output and high phenotypic

plasticity that allow this plant to establish 
in recently disturbed, early successional 
sites, and as members of diverse agroecosys￾tems, papayas evolved and were domesti￾cated to serve agriculture. The height of 
wild plants can exceed 6–10 m and they can 
live up to 20 years; however, the commercial 
life of a papaya orchard is normally restricted 
to 2–3 years because of management strat￾egies (Jiménez et al., 2014).
3.4.4 Reproductive development
Papaya plants start to flower 6–8 months after 
germination. Height and number of nodes 
at which the first flowers appear varies be￾tween genotypes: 40 cm and 24 nodes for 
cultivar ‘Betty’, while for the cultivar ‘Solo’ 
it is 140 cm and 48 nodes. As described 
above, papayas are ‘trioecious’ plants, since 
separate plants have either male, female or 
hermaphrodite flowers (Saran et al., 2016). 
The sex of a plant can be distinguished 
visually only after flowering onset. Female 
plants (Fig. 3.2A) must be cross-pollinated 
by pollen coming from either male or herm￾aphrodite flowers, while only the latter can 
be self-pollinated (Rieger, 2006; Saran et al., 
2016).
Staminate or male plants are character￾ized by having smaller flowers, 2.0–3.0 cm 
long, attached to long racemes (Fig. 3.2B) 
(León, 1987; Rieger, 2006), a calyx of five 
small united sepals and a long petal (corolla) 
tube, with pointed lobes (Fig. 3.2C). At the 
mouth of the tube the stamens are epipe￾talous, ten in number, arranged in two rows 
of five (Ronse De Craene and Smets, 1999; 
Saran et al., 2016). The ovary was trans￾formed into an elongated pistillode, which 
functions as a nectary that produces nectar. 
Interestingly, the anthers also possess oxal￾ate crystals or druses (Ronse De Craene and 
Smets, 1999).
Hermaphrodite or andromonoic plants 
have cymes 2.5–25.0 cm long, with one to 
six flowers; the terminal flowers of the pri￾mary and secondary peduncles are perfect, 
while lower orders may be perfect or stamin￾ate (León, 1987; Saran et al., 2016). Hermaph￾roditic flowers (Fig. 3.2D) tend to be highly 
variable in the extent of stamen and carpel 
development, producing flowers with ten 
stamens and five carpels (‘elongata’ type, with 
an elongated ovary and with stamens found 
at the upper border of the corolla), to flowers 
with five stamens and five or ten carpels 
(‘pentandria’ type, with the ovary and sta￾mens below the tip of the corolla) (Ronse De 
Craene et al., 2011). The former is the most 
common type and is considered the perfect 
flower (León, 1987; Saran et al., 2016). En￾vironmental stresses caused by water deficit, 
extreme high or low temperatures, excessive 
soil moisture and nitrogen imbalances (Awa￾da and Ikeda, 1953, 1957; Awada, 1958; 
Texeira-da Silva et al., 2007) exacerbate fe￾male sterility. In fact, perfect flowers can 
suffer fusions of stamens and ovary, produ￾cing carpellodic fruits (Awada and Ikeda, 
1957; Arkle Jr and Nakasone, 1984; Ronse 
De Craene and Smets, 1999; Almeida et al., 
2003), flowers that resemble female ones 
with rounded ovaries and free petals, and 
stamens transformed into carpels in the 
‘pentandria’ type. These and other intermedi￾ate carpellodic states are common and re￾sult in the development of misshapen fruits. 
The tendency to produce carpellodic flowers 
has a strong genetic component (Storey, 
1953; Ramos et al., 2011).
Female flowers (Fig. 3.2E) appear in 
leaf axils along the main stem on short ped￾uncles, single or in small cymes of three to 
five individuals from which generally only 
the terminal one develops into a fruit (León, 
1987; Rieger, 2006; Saran et al., 2016). The 
ovary position is superior. Female flowers, 
4.0–5.0 cm long, are pear shaped before 
opening (Saran et al., 2016). They have a 
short calyx tube with five short lobes and 
petals only fused at the base, with twisted 
point tips. The ovary is composed of five 
fused carpels and a single locule with many 
ovules; the stigma is large. These flowers 
are purely pistillate without stamens (León, 
1987; Ronse De Craene and Smets, 1999; 
Saran et al., 2016).
Under particular climatic conditions 
(León, 1987; Saran et al., 2016) or contact 
with certain chemicals, such as ethrel and 
chlorflurenol (Kumar and Jaiswal, 1984), 
sex reversion has been observed in male

and hermaphrodite plants (mainly in the 
‘elongata’ type), but not in female plants. 
Parthenocarpy in papaya is not common, 
but has been reported (Saran et al., 2016).
Pollen grains are tricolporate (i.e. three 
germination apertures) (Santos et al., 2008; 
Saran et al., 2016), with no significant dif￾ferences in diameter (25.18–25.72 μm) and 
weight (11.76–15.45 ng). Staminate flowers 
have the lowest amount of pollen (12,638 
grains per anther) and a germination rate 
of nearly 53%. The ‘elongata’ type of herm￾aphrodite plants produced the highest amount 
of pollen (14,884 pollen grains per anther) 
and germination (~46%) (Saran et al., 2016). 
On the viability test of the cultivar ‘Sunrise 
Solo’, several stain procedures (Alexander’s 
stain, acetocarmine, iodine-potassium iod￾ide and Sudan IV) overestimated pollen via￾bility, reporting values higher than 90%.

The use of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chlor￾ide results in a viability of 67%, similar to 
germination results (65%) (Munhoz et al., 
2008). In a dioecious plantation, female plants 
required at least 6–10% male ones to reach 
good pollination and fruit production (An￾negowda and Bhat, 2016). Female plants 
pollinated with pollen from hermaphrodite 
ones, set a maximum number of fruits (Saran 
et al., 2016).
Fruits also differ among papaya sexual 
types and are very diverse in terms of shape 
and size. Fruits from hermaphroditic plants 
are more elongated, varying from cylin￾drical to pear-shaped forms (Fig. 3.2F), while 
those from female plants are rounded 
(Fig. 3.2G). As for the rest of the plant, the 
fleshy fruit is built mostly of parenchymat￾ous tissue, and its contribution to whole￾plant photosynthesis might be only relevant 
in young fruits, when their chlorophyll con￾tents are high and the surface:volume ratio 
likewise (Bron et al., 2004). However, since 
the fruits mostly develop in the shade under 
the dense papaya canopy, photosynthesis is 
rather limited. Photosynthesis may be more 
relevant for re-fixing CO2
 released during 
respiration to the massive fruit inner parts.
Fruits develop in c.5 months until they 
are physiologically ripe. The ripening process 
follows a climacteric behaviour and, there￾fore, ethylene is produced and released 
only a few hours after harvesting at the right 
moment (when one to two yellow stripes 
are visible on the fruit surface). With ripen￾ing, papaya fruits suffer several changes 
(carbohydrate contents, texture, colour and 
synthesis of secondary compounds) that 
lead to the final colour and fragrance when 
fully ripe (Bron and Jacomino, 2006). Col￾our at full ripeness may vary from yellow to 
salmon red depending on the genotype be￾cause of the carotenoids profile, mainly of 
lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene 
(Schweiggert et al., 2011, 2012). Regarding 
fragrance, ripe papaya fruits contain over 
150 volatile esters and alcohols, which are 
responsible for the fruit flavour and sweet 
aroma (Pino et al., 2003). These aspects are 
also discussed in Chapter 11, this volume.

4.1 Introduction
Papaya is propagated by seed in most of the 
countries where it is grown. Since it is a 
cross-pollinated crop, the plants raised from 
seeds have a mixed inheritance which makes 
them highly variable in performance. It is 
important, therefore, for the grower to secure 
seed from a reliable source, where selection 
and, perhaps, controlled pollination are car￾ried out. Papaya can also be propagated by 
cutting and grafting. Methods of asexual 
propagation have been standardized and are 
used in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, 
Nigeria and South Africa. Micropropagation 
from shoot tips is the common method of 
propagation in Taiwan and China.
4.2 Seed
Papaya is generally propagated by seeds 
obtained through controlled pollination. In 
terms of seed storage behaviour, papaya seed 
is categorized as ‘intermediate’ between 
orthodox and relcalcitrant seeds. Drying and 
cooling increased longevity of papaya seed 
germination but only at defined treatments. 
Papaya seeds with approximately 10% moisture 
content when stored at 15°C had increased 
seed viability compared with further drying 
and storage at 0°C or –20°C (Ellis et al., 1991). 
Seeds dried to a moisture content of 6–8% and 
packed in an airtight, moisture-impervious 
container can be stored at ambient tempera￾ture in the short term (18 months) and at 
15°C for medium-term storage (2–3 years) 
(Satisha et al., 2016). Seedling vigour, how￾ever, decreased with increasing storage time 
(Doijode, 1992). Freshly harvested seeds of 
the cultivar ‘Tainung 01’ showed dormancy, 
which was overcome by 6-months’ storage. 
Seeds with 8–11% moisture content and with￾out sarcotesta (gelatinous material covering 
the seed) maintained better physiological 
quality for about 12–15 months under ambi￾ent conditions (Dias et al., 2009).
The presence of the sarcotesta, containing 
phenolic compounds, inhibits the exchange 
of liquids and gases, prolongs the drying 
period and facilitates colonization of patho￾gens (Romero-Rodriguez et al., 2013). Rubbing 
with coarse sand, smearing with a plastic 
bristle brush or sieving under running water 
(Melo and Seleguini, 2013) and immersion 
of seeds in 25% sodium hydroxide solution 
for 15 min (Romero-Rodriguez et al., 2013) 
were suggested as suitable methods for 
removal of sarcotesta of papaya seeds.

Treating the seeds with gibbrellic acid 
(GA3) at 50–1000 ppm (Shen et al., 2006; 
Zanotti et al., 2014), potassium nitrate at 0.30 M 
(Bhering et al., 2007), salicylic acid at 10-4 M 
(Carrillo-Castaneda et al., 2013), calcium 
chloride at 10-5 M (Carrillo-Castaneda et al., 
2013) or tannic acid at 10-3 M (Hore and Sen, 
1993) enhanced germination. Seed germin￾ation has also been dealt with in Chapter 3 
and Chapter 9, this volume.
4.2.1 Raising seedlings
Seeds may be sown in trays filled with a suit￾able medium, peat pots, plug trays (Fig. 4.1), 
perforated polythene bags (20 cm × 15 cm) or 
directly in the soil. Most propagators choose 
to prepare the substrate by mixing the com￾ponents in such a way that suitable air flow 
and drainage are ensured. Unfavourable se￾lection of substrate makes the seedling growth 
weak and erratic (Nwofia and Okwu, 2015). Use 
of peat moss (Muhamad Hafiz et al., 2017) 
and a farmyard manure, red soil and sand 
mixture (1:1:1) (Satisha et al., 2016) were sug￾gested as good media for raising seedlings.
The seeding rate varies according to the 
plant density required. Usually 30–40 g seeds 
for gynodioecious varieties and about 100 g 
of seeds for dioecious varieties are required 
per acre of plantation. In the case of the pot or 
bag sowing method, two to three seeds per 
pot or bag are sown to compensate for poor 
germination, insect damage and removal of 
male plants at the time of flowering. Seeds 
should be sown 1–2 cm deep and 5–8 cm 
apart in a raised bed which should contain 
a well-drained sandy loam or similar soil. 
Inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense cell 
suspension increased germination (Carrillo￾Castaneda et al., 2013). Seeds germinate in 
about 12–20 days depending on the ambi￾ent temperature. Immediately following 
germination, partial shade is desirable, es￾pecially during hot weather. Watering should 
be carried out with a watering (sprinkling) 
can or with a fine spray head on a hose at 
low pressure.
Seedlings raised in containers should 
be hardened gradually in sunlight and field 
transplanted around 45–60 days after ger￾mination when they are about 20–25cm 
in height.

4.3 Vegetative Propagation
4.3.1 Cuttings
Commercially, papayas are propagated by 
seed. However, even if the lines have been 
sib- or self-pollinated for several generations, 
there is still some variability in fruit size, 
shape, productivity, flavour and other char￾acteristics between plants of the same sex 
type, while plants of different sex types are 
produced in the progenies (Allan, 1995). The 
advantages of using cuttings are that the sex 
of the plants is known, elite plants can be 
perpetuated, remain true-to-type, start flower￾ing within a few months close to the ground 
and produce uniform quality fruits that sell 
for premium prices (Allan and Carlson, 
2007). Allan (1964) was the first to develop 
a protocol for cloning a female papaya 
plant, the ‘Honey Gold’ clone at the Univer￾sity of Natal, South Africa.
One of the limiting factors of propagating 
papaya by cuttings is availability of large 
quantities of cuttings for mass propagation. 
Side shoots are normally not produced by 
papaya plants, which have a strong apical 
dominance. Growth of axillary buds can be 
induced by cutting back the stem (Soomark 
and Tai, 1975; Allan, 1990, 1995). Suitable 
small, vigorous cuttings can also be induced 
to develop on older, branched plants by 
simply repeatedly topping the growing points. 
Initially a few thick side shoots grow, but 
after repeated topping many small pen-sized 
shoots are produced (Allan, 1995) (Fig. 4.2).
Mixtures of cytokinin and GA3
 induce 
bud break and subsequent elongation of 
the side shoots. A combined treatment of 
6-benzylaminopurine (6-BAP, 500 mg l-1) and 
GA3
 (1000 mg l-1) in a lanolin paste, or three 
sprays at weekly intervals with 6-BAP (500 
mg l-1) and GA3
 (100 mg l-1) effectively re￾leased axillary buds of young greenhouse 
seedlings or 2-year-old field-grown plants 
(Reuveni and Schlesinger, 1990). Allan and 
MacMillan (1991) showed that injection of 
this solution on the base of the stem of young 
2.0 m tall, and old plants, followed by top￾ping the stem and removing all leaves and 
fruits a day later in spring, induced the pro￾duction of a large number of pen-sized side 
shoots (Fig. 4.3). Desouky et al. (2000) recorded 
the highest mean number of lateral shoots 
with GA3
 at 500 ppm, whereas the greatest 
mean shoot length was obtained with GA3
 at 
1000 ppm in decapitated 8-month-old seed￾lings of ‘Solo’ papaya. Detopping followed 
by spraying with 6-BAP (500 ppm) and GA3
(100 ppm) encouraged a higher number of 
laterals (66.17 per plant) suitable for use in 
preparing cuttings (Das et al., 2018).
On collection, the lower leaves are re￾moved to leave three to four upright leaves

(Fig. 4.3). The cuttings are then immersed 
completely in a fungicidal bath, with a wet￾ting agent to protect them from infection 
(Allan et al., 1993; Allan, 1995). The cut￾tings are treated with indole butyric acid 
(IBA) (at 0.4%) rooting powder (Allan, 
1995) or dipped (30–50 mm) in a solution 
containing IBA at 3.0 g l-1 (Ruiz et al., 2016) 
before being placed in the sterile mist bed 
(Allan, 1995). The rooted cuttings are then 
planted in polyethylene bags (Fig. 4.4) or 
potted in coconut fibre (Ruiz et al., 2016). 
Coarse perlite medium resulted in signifi￾cantly better rooting than pine bark (Allan 
and MacMillan, 1991). Semi-hardwood cut￾tings rooted well in an aerated medium and 
with bottom heat of 30°C (Reuveni and 
Shlesinger, 1990). Day and night temperat￾ures from 27°C to 30°C in the rooting media 
are optimum for rooting cuttings. The 
control of the substrate temperature and the 
frequency of intermittent mist were empha￾sized to avoid high losses due to bacteria 
and fungi proliferation (Fitch et al., 2005). 
Rooting varies from 30% to 65% in the dif￾ferent varieties tested (Fitch et al., 2005; 
Allan and Carlson, 2007; Ruiz et al., 2016; 
Schmildt et al., 2016). Survival rates of 
between 57% and 90% of the cuttings were 
achieved by Allan (1964, 1990).
Plantations raised by cuttings flower 
early at the lower nodes compared with 
seed-propagated plants and could be kept in 
production for a longer time (Allan, 1995). 
Limitations of papaya produced from cut￾tings may include bearing the fruit very low 
on the trunk making management of plants 
as well as growing fruits difficult, as they 
are prone to infection by Phytophthora and 
other soil-borne pathogens as well as spread

of bacterial, phytoplasma and viral diseases 
from the mother stock. Lack of uniformity 
will be an added complication when a mix 
of mother stocks is used to generate large 
numbers of cuttings for a commercial oper￾ation. Therefore, stringent disease indexing 
of mother stocks is required to achieve cut￾ting production for commercial operations. 
Alternatively, plantlets micropropagated from 
disease indexed explants can be used as a 
safe stock mother plant for commercial pro￾duction (P. Josekutty, Queensland, Australia, 
2019, personal communication).
4.3.2 Grafting
Propagation of papaya by grafting or budding 
from certified clonal plants ensures better 
uniformity of fruits and resistance to pests 
and diseases. During 2005–2006, Allan and 
co-workers planted papaya seedlings in 
plastic bags (13 mm × 20 mm) containing 
milled and composted pine bark medium, 
and grew them outdoors. Once established, 
they were used as rootstock and side grafted 
with ‘Honey Gold’ scions, that had most of 
their leaves removed and had a similar diam￾eter (5–10 mm). Where small leaf blades were 
still present they were covered with a thin 
plastic sheet to maintain humid conditions. 
After 6 weeks of grafting, the terminal grow￾ing point of the rootstock was broken out 
and subsequently any growing lateral buds 
were removed. Once the scion started to 
grow, the rootstock was cut back to the graft 
union. Spraying of household bleach (con￾taining 3.5% sodium hypochlorite) at 5–10% 
for surface sterilization of rootstock and scion 
was effective to control bacterial infection. 
Allan et al. (2010) reported a success rate of 
81%, after 15 weeks, when side grafted on 
to well-fertilized and vigorous rootstocks.
Chong et al. (2005) developed a 100% 
hermaphrodite plantation of ‘Eksotika’, 
which normally produce hermaphrodite and 
female seedlings in the ratio of 2:1, through 
cleft grafting the seedlings at the nursery stage 
using healthy, disease-free, hermaphrodite 
scions. The grafted region was wrapped 
firmly with Parafilm® before covering with 
a plastic bag to retain humidity. Grafted 
plants were ready for field planting 8 weeks 
after grafting (Chong et al., 2008). The ini￾tial grafting success was about 80% and 
some diebacks occurred after removal of the 
plastic covers. Spraying of oxychloride fun￾gicide and sterilizing the scions and grafting 
knives with chlorine solution during graft￾ing reduced the soft rot and Pythium damp￾ing off infection (Chong et al., 2005). Scion 
shoots of ‘CO-1’ and ‘Honey Dew’ papayas 
were successfully cleft grafted on to uni￾formly established seedlings (Airi et al., 
1986). Ramkhelawan et al. (1999), in com￾paring different methods of grafting and 
budding, recorded 100% success with ter￾minal wedge grafting followed by 85% with 
chip budding and 75% for side grafting. The 
age of the rootstock and grafting season had 
a significant effect on graft success (Nguyen 
and Yen, 2018). One-month-old rootstocks 
gave the best result (93% success) for cleft 
grafting ‘Red Lady’ papaya in the summer 
(Nguyen and Yen, 2018).
4.3.3 Budding
Budding consists of grafting a bud on to a 
seedling, usually as a shield, patch or forekert 
bud. Singh et al. (1985) suggested growing 
seedlings in a pot and when the seedlings 
attained a diameter of 1.0–1.5 cm, these 
were ready for budding. They used vigorous 
female plants of ‘Pusa Dwarf’ as the scion. 
Side shoots of 1.2 cm diameter, were used 
as bud wood. Patch and shield budding was 
carried out during July–October. Budded 
seedlings were decapitated after a week of 
budding to promote growth of the grafted 
bud by removing the apical dominance. The 
buds sprouted after 15 days. Patch budding 
gave better success than shield budding in 
their experiment. The highest success of 
90% take was recorded in patch budding 
when done in the first fortnight of Septem￾ber. Shield budding showed the highest 
take of 80% when practised in the first fort￾night of September. It appears that the time 
of budding (early September with mild wea￾ther and reasonable relative humidity) is 
vital for the success of budding in papaya

apart from other factors such as suitable root￾stock and bud stock.
Sookmark and Tai (1975) found two bud￾ding techniques – forkert and chip budding – 
were successful in papaya. The rootstock 
seedlings were grown in polyethylene bags 
(20 cm × 30 cm) in a mixture of two parts of 
loam soil and one part each of coco peat and 
rotted compost. Budding was done when 
the seedlings were 1.0–1.5 cm in diameter 
and 9–12 weeks old. In forekert budding, 
the stem of the rootstock was wiped clean to 
a height of 7 cm, then at 5–6 cm a transverse 
cut was made to the depth of the cambium 
and a strip of bark, 1 cm wide pulled down 
for a distance of 3–4 cm, part of the strip 
was cut off to leave a flap of about one-third 
of its original length. The herbaceous nature 
of young papaya seedlings made it neces￾sary to exercise great care in making all cuts 
in the preparation of the rootstock. A scion 
patch with a bud to fit the stripped portion 
of the rootstock was removed and inserted 
in the rootstock. The lower part of the patch 
was then covered by the rootstock flap and 
covered with plastic tape, leaving the ‘eye’ of 
the bud exposed. The potted, budded seed￾lings were kept under shade inside a green￾house for the next 14 days. After 7 days of 
budding the rootstocks were decapitated 
5–7 cm above the bud. All shoots arising from 
the rootstock were removed soon after they 
emerged. The budded plants were ready for 
transplanting in 2 months. In chip budding, 
a notch was made on the rootstock by remov￾ing a chip. This was done by making two 
standing cuts of different lengths on the 
same side of the stem, the first at an angle of 
15° to the vertical, at 6 cm from the soil level, 
while the second was made 2 cm lower at 
30°, and this intersected the first cut at a 
depth of 0.5 cm from the surface of the stem. 
A scion chip bearing a bud near to its lower 
end was cut to fit the notch and after it was 
put in place, the cuts were covered with 
plastic tape leaving the ‘eye’ of the bud ex￾posed. Subsequent treatment was identical 
with that of forekert budding. Sookmark 
and Tai (1975) recorded 80–100% success in 
forekert budding when practised in Decem￾ber and January with ‘Sunrise’ seedlings as 
the rootstock.
Grafted or budded papaya plants bear 
fruits earlier at lower nodes and are dwarf 
with a longer economic life, suitable for close 
planting (Allan, 2007; Chong et al., 2008; 
Allan et al., 2010) and they yielded better 
than ungrafted trees (Lima et al., 2010).
4.4 In Vitro Propagation
Papaya is commonly micropropagated 
through shoot tip or axillary bud culture. 
Explant types have a direct effect on prolif￾eration. Field-grown stock plants often have 
bacterial contamination. Litz and Conover 
(1978) recorded 95% contamination in pri￾mary cultures when the explants were col￾lected from mature field-grown plants. It is 
suggested that mother plants should be tested 
for the presence of pathogens (i.e. disease 
indexing of mother stocks), particularly vir￾uses and bacteria, prior to the collection of 
shoot tip or axillary bud explants (Teixeira 
da Silva et al., 2007). The axillary buds 
should be sterilized using rifampicin and 
sodium hypochlorite solution. Initial treat￾ments with 500 mg l-1 gentamycin (Mondal 
et al., 1990) or shaking of propagules with 
300 mg l-1 rifampicin (Reuveni et al., 1990) 
for 24 h minimizes the seasonal endophytic 
contamination. Similarly, incorporation of 
antibiotics such as rifampicin (50 mg l-1) 
(Reuveni et al., 1990) or miconazole (5–20 
mg l-1) (Tynan et al., 1993) into culture me￾dium were able to inhibit hyphal growth 
and sporulation of a wide range of microbes 
commonly associated with papaya plants. 
Bindu and Bindu (2017) used mercuric 
chloride (0.08%) for 10–12 min with inter￾mittent shaking for surface sterilization of 
apical and lateral buds of papaya.
Several researchers (Litz and Conover, 
1977; Rajeevan and Pandey, 1986; Mondal 
et al., 1990; Reuveni et al., 1990; Drew, 1992; 
Drew and Miller, 1993; Patel et al., 2013; 
Bindu and Bindu, 2017; Ryavalad et al.,

regenerate plants. One involved regeneration 
of plants from callus and the other, production 
of multiple plants from single shoot-tip ex￾plants. Callus was induced from stem sections 
of papaya seedlings in a medium containing 
1 mg l-1 naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 
0.1 mg l-1 kinetin. The callus regenerated 
shoots and/or embryoids when transferred 
to a medium of lower auxin (0–0.05 mg l-1
indole acetic acid (IAA)) and higher cytoki￾nin (1–2 mg l-1 kinetin). Multiple shoots 
were produced when the excised shoot-tip 
explants were cultured in a medium sup￾plemented with 0.05 mg l-1 IAA and either 
5 mg l-1 kinetin or 0.5–1.0 mg l-1 6-BAP. Root 
formation of the shoots or embryoids that 
derived from callus or shoot tips occurred 
in a medium containing 5 mg l-1 IAA and in 
a light intensity of 3000–4000 lux. The 
rooted plants were successfully established 
in the greenhouse after they were acclima￾tized by initially growing in moist vermicu￾lite. Litz and Conover (1978) recorded rapid 
proliferation of tissue taken from the petiole 
with an axillary bud at the base in Mu￾rashige and Skoog (MS) medium supple￾mented with 2.0 μm 6-BAP and 0.5 μm 
NAA. Tissues were then transferred to MS 
medium without hormones and explants 
reached a suitable size in 3 weeks. Reuveni 
et al. (1990) obtained a high rate of success in 
culture establishment of two seedling clones 
from open-pollinated dioecious papaya and 
five clones obtained through mass selection 
of dioecious seedlings using explants of ax￾illary buds taken from lateral shoots of hedged 
rooted cuttings grown in a greenhouse. MS￾based medium supplemented with 6-BAP at 
0.5 mg l-1 and NAA at 0.1 mg l-1 was used for 
establishment and proliferation. The add￾ition of adenine sulfate (160 mg l-1) im￾proved multiplication and shoot growth. 
They thought that shoot elongation stage 
on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg 
l-1 kinetin and 0.5 mg l-1 NAA was necessary 
before rooting. High percentage rooting of 
shoots was obtained on MS medium with 
half-strength macroelements supplemented 
with 1.0 mg l-1 IBA. Using this procedure, 
they produced several thousand plants.
Wu et al. (2012) achieved shoot initi￾ation from axillary buds in MS medium 
supplemented with 0.5 mg l-1 6-BAP and 
40 g l-1 sucrose. An average of 6.7-fold prolifer￾ation rate per subculture was obtained on MS 
medium containing 0.25 mg l-1 6-BAP and 
40 g l-1 sucrose after five subcultures. Shoot 
elongation was induced in MS medium 
supplemented with 0.25 mg l-1 6-BAP and 
1.0 mg l-1 GA3
 and 40 g l-1 sucrose. Cultures 
were maintained for 20 months (22 subcul￾tures) without any loss in multiplication rate 
or change in growth habit. The 3/2 MS me￾dium (i.e. with 1.5 times the macroelements 
of MS) with 500 mg l-1 activated charcoal 
and 5 g l-1 sucrose was found to be optimum 
for root development. In the greenhouse, 
bags with sand (filled to one-third volume) 
over a mixture of peat and vermiculite (1:1 
v/v) were used and 87% of plants survived. 
These in vitro-raised plants were all herm￾aphrodites and showed no distinct pheno￾typic variation. Patel et al. (2013) standard￾ized the micropropagation protocol for 
papaya cultivar ‘Red Lady’. In a multiplica￾tion study, maximum shoot multiplication 
was observed by alternate subculturing in 
MS medium + 0.5 mg l-1 6-BAP and in MS 
medium + 0.1 mg l-1 NAA. Adding sucrose 
at 30 g l-1 in the medium increased the num￾ber and length of roots. In proliferation me￾dium, addition of 160 mg l-1 adenine sulfate 
in MS medium further increased shoot 
growth. Rooting treatment consisting of half 
MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg l-1
IBA caused early induction of roots (28 days), 
maximum number of roots per shoot (5.0) 
and length of root (6.0 cm).
In developing the tissue culture proto￾col for papaya cultivar ‘Pusa Nanha’, Bindu 
and Bindu (2017) used apical buds and lat￾eral buds from seedlings and mature plants 
as explants. They reported maximum shoot 
proliferation by using full-strength MS me￾dium supplemented with sucrose at 30 g l-1
and agar at 6.5 g l-1. Application of 6-BAP at 
0.50 mg l-1 along with NAA at 0.1 mg l-1 was 
found better for initial culture establish￾ment and proliferation, while the highest 
shoot length was obtained by adding argin￾ine at 100.0 mg l-1. In vitro rooting was 
higher in full-strength MS medium supple￾mented with 0.05% activated charcoal, IBA 
at 3.0 mg l-1 and sucrose at 30 g l-1. Shoot

tips of papaya variety ‘Surya’ showed max￾imum shoot multiplication when cultured 
on full-strength MS medium supplemented 
with 2.0 mg l-1 6-BAP and 1.0 mg l-1 NAA. 
The best rooting was observed by using 
NAA at 3.0 mg l-1 (Ryavalad et al., 2019).
4.4.1 Embryogenesis
Somatic embryogenesis has been observed 
from papaya callus (de Bruijne et al., 1974; 
Yie and Liaw, 1977). Highly efficient somatic 
embryogenesis has been reported from cul￾tured papaya ovules (Litz and Conover, 1983). 
Somatic embryogenesis from explants from 
hermaphrodite papaya mother plants is an 
alternative for the production of true-to-type 
plants without the need for sexing (Gouvea 
et al., 2019). Somatic embryogenesis was 
obtained from callus of root explants after 
3 months of culture (Chen et al., 1987). A me￾dium containing half-strength MS inorganic 
salts, 160 mg l-1 adenine sulfate, 1.0 mg l-1
NAA, 0.5 mg l-1 kinetin and 1.0 mg l-1 GA3
was reported optimal for embryogenesis. 
The callus maintained high regenerative 
capacity after 2 years of the culture on this 
medium. Plants derived from somatic em￾bryos were raised under greenhouse condi￾tions (Chen et al., 1987). Castillo et al. (1997) 
could produce somatic embryos of papaya 
cultivar ‘Solo’ in a liquid production system 
and encapsulated the embryos in two different 
encapsulation compounds. They reported that 
the frequency of regeneration from encapsu￾lated embryos was significantly affected by: 
(i) the concentration of sodium alginate; (ii) 
the presence or absence of nutrient salts in 
the capsule; and (iii) the duration of expos￾ure to calcium chloride. Sodium alginate (2.5%) 
in a half-strength MS salts base resulted in 
higher germination frequencies and a short 
(10 min) exposure to calcium chloride pro￾vided uniform encapsulation of embryos and 
the highest germination (77.5%). Fitch (1993) 
achieved high frequency somatic embryo￾genesis by culturing hypocotyl sections from 
10-day-old seedlings on half-strength MS 
medium containing modified MS vitamins, 
2.3–112.5 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic 
acid (2,4-D), 400 mg l-1 glutamine and 6% 
sucrose. Four hermaphroditic Hawaiian 
cultivars produced embryogenic calli after 
10–14 weeks of culture at 27°C in the dark. 
Efficiency in embryogenic response differed 
among genotypes as follows: ‘Kapoho’ > ‘Sun￾set’ > ‘Sunrise’ > ‘Waimanalo’. The frequency 
of embryogenesis in induction medium con￾taining 4.5 μM 2,4-D was highest with 7% 
sucrose. Somatic embryos were found to 
develop directly from embryogenic calli on 
induction medium, or, more often, they dif￾ferentiated from calli subcultured on a me￾dium devoid of growth regulators. Between 50 
and 500 embryos were produced from each 
2-mm hypocotyl section after at least 2 months 
on induction medium and 2 months on mat￾uration medium. Embryos subsequently de￾veloped into normal-looking plants on MS 
medium. Shoot cuttings from germinated 
embryos and micropropagated plants were 
rooted with 5.0 μM IBA, grown in the green￾house, and transferred to the field. Farzana 
et al. (2008) successfully initiated embryogenic 
calli from zygotic embryos and hypocotyl ex￾plants on MS media containing 3 mg l-1 NAA. 
Immature leaf explants of papaya cultivar 
‘Rathna’ cultured on 1 mg l-1 2,4-D was found 
most suitable for callusing. Casein hydrolys￾ate at 100 mg l-1 helped for maturation of calli. 
Matured embryonic calli proliferated on MS 
medium supplemented with 0.5 mg l-1 6-BAP. 
The medium supplemented with 0.02 mg l-1
NAA and 0.5 mg l-1 6-BAP caused higher ger￾mination of embryos. Further development of 
plantlets was achieved through germination 
of somatic embryos on hormone-free MS me￾dium. The plantlets were acclimatized in 
coir dust: sand (1:1) medium in a propagator. 
Gouvea et al. (2019) cultured leaf disks from 
in vitro shoots originated from ex vitro herm￾aphrodite papaya ‘UNEF/Caliman 01’ in induc￾tion medium supplemented with different 
concentrations of 2,4-D and 4-chlorophe￾noxyacetic acid (4-CPA). Embryogenic effi￾ciency of axenic leaf explants from in vitro
shoots of this hybrid hermaphrodite papaya 
was found to be higher (96%) by using 4-CPA at 
25 μM. Maturation and conversion of somatic 
embryos were higher (36.6 somatic embryos 
per callus) using MS medium supplemented 
with abscisic acid (0.5 μM) and activated

charcoal (15 mg l-1). Germination of cotyle￾donary somatic embryos into plantlets was 
higher with GA3
 at 2.80 μM.
In embryogenesis culture, callus forma￾tion at the radical end is frequently observed 
during germination (Sekeli et al., 2013).

Plants of somatic embryos cultured in liquid 
medium have less exposure to the medium, 
greater oxygenation and agitation. A favour￾able alternative is a temporary immersion 
system such as the RITAR type. RITAR (CJ 
Diffusion, CIRAD, France) is a polycarbon￾ate container (15 mm × 13 cm, 1 l volume) for 
semi-automated temporary immersion and 
is a single jar with upper and lower com￾partments, which reduces the risk of air 
leakage and contamination. Complete ger￾mination of papaya cultivar ‘Maradol Roja’ 
somatic embryos was achieved with the use 
of the temporary immersion system RITAR
in MS culture medium with 0.02 μM 6-BAP 
and an initial inoculum density of 200 mg 
fresh weight of somatic embryos (Posada￾Perez et al., 2017a). The somatic embryos 
were immersed in the liquid medium for 12 h 
and withdrawn for 1 min before being 
re-immersed. The use of 475.8 μM phloro￾glucinol in semi-solid medium achieved 
complete germination of papaya somatic 
embryos with low callus (13%) formation 
(Posada-Perez et al., 2017a). Posada-Perez 
et al. (2017b) developed a protocol for obtain￾ing 100% hermaphrodite plants of cultivar 
‘Maradol Roja’ through somatic embryogen￾esis from immature zygotic embryos (Fig. 
4.5). Consistent with a strategy aimed to cir￾cumvent the high mortality rates in vitro, 
during the ex vitro acclimatization phase a 
high ex vitro survival rate was achieved, 
and regenerated plants showed high genetic 
homology. The methodology developed was 
supported by histology and electron micros￾copy studies. The expression of the genes 
AUX/LAX and PIN (coding for the polar 
transporters) was demonstrated for the first 
time at all stages of histological differenti￾ation during the development of the somatic 
embryos.
4.5 Conclusion
Papaya is mainly propagated by seeds. The 
issue of poor and/or limited seed production 
from hybrid papaya varieties is a serious 
problem because seed must be produced 
under controlled conditions, which is hard 
to achieve in the field. The best seed for ger￾mination of seedlings is obtained from ripe 
or overripe fruits. Environmental factors, 
including temperature and light influence 
seed germination.
Clonal propagation by cutting, grafting, 
budding and micropropagation have been 
standardized, but are still not used commer￾cially in most of the countries where papaya 
is grown. The advantages of using clonally 
propagated plants are that the sex of the 
plant is known, they are more vigorous and 
earlier in bearing than seedling plants. 
There is good potential for adoption of 
clonal propagation when production be￾comes efficient enough to compete in price 
with the current practice of planting two to 
three seedlings in a single hole and thinning 
after 3–4 months.

5.1 Introduction
The application of biotechnology to plant 
breeding includes the development of tools 
and knowledge to increase accuracy and 
efficiency for pre-breeding and selection for 
crop improvement that have multiple advan￾tages over traditional technologies. Biotech￾nology is also applied for the characterization 
of an organism at cellular or molecular levels 
to accurately genotype for authentication and 
monitoring. Novel technologies have opened 
new horizons for genetic improvement 
through to intellectual property protection 
of the ownership of genetic materials. One 
horticultural crop that has already benefited 
greatly and has the potential for a great deal 
more benefit from these technologies is 
papaya, a relatively short generation, small￾genome sized, tissue culturable and genetic￾ally transformable species. In papaya, these 
technologies have already included tissue 
culture, genetic transformation and various 
molecular approaches. Specifically, in vitro
culture methods have been developed for 
clonal propagation for mass production, em￾bryo rescue techniques have been developed 
to overcome genetic incompatibility from 
intergeneric crosses, and embryogenesis and 
plant regeneration methods now exist to 
apply on genetic transformants (Torres, 1989; 
Idowu et al., 2009; Hussian et al., 2012; Dhek￾ney et al., 2016). These new methods, know￾ledge and tools may be applied in breeding 
to improve fruit quality, and in selecting and 
breeding for disease resistance. To underpin 
the development of papaya biotechnology 
tools, the initial papaya whole genome ref￾erence sequencing project was successfully 
published in 2008 by Ming et al. Conse￾quently, genomics studies in papaya have 
dramatically advanced with the generation 
of several whole genome sequences, high 
density genetic maps (Yu et al., 2009), iden￾tification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) 
conditioning quantitative traits and for can￾didate gene characterization (Blas et al., 2012) 
and for the development of implementable 
genetic markers linked to traits of interest 
(de Oliveira et al., 2012; Matos et al., 2013; 
Kanchana-udomkan et al., 2014). Sequen￾cing technologies have also generated new 
types of markers, such as single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), which have also been 
utilized for quantitative trait mapping and 
marker-assisted selection (MAS). In addition, 
the information obtained from gene expres￾sion studies has been exploited to improve

efficacy of these newly developed molecu￾lar markers. This chapter reviews recent 
applications of in vitro culture, genetic trans￾formation and genomics studies towards 
papaya crop improvement.
5.2 In Vitro Culture in Papaya
Micropropagation has been used to provide 
disease-free planting material and for the rapid 
propagation of elite propagules with genetic 
uniformity. It also facilitates quarantined 
movement of germplasm among localities 
and countries, and assists in commercial plant 
production when traditional methods are 
unable to meet demand. Efficient protocols 
for papaya micropropagation were initially 
developed for research and commercial pro￾duction by Drew and Smith (1986). This topic 
is reviewed by Mitra in Chapter 4, this vol￾ume. In this chapter, we present a review of 
the application of tissue-culture technology 
for crop improvement including embryo res￾cue, protoplast culture, double haploid pro￾duction and conservation of germplasm.
5.2.1 Embryo rescue technique
Although papaya has a comparatively short 
generation time to fruit crop, at least seven 
or eight generations (at least 7 years) are re￾quired to produce a new variety using trad￾itional breeding methods (Ray, 2002). To 
reduce this, embryo rescue may be applied 
and thereby improve breeding efficiency. 
Embryo rescue is mainly used to increase the 
number of surviving intergeneric and inter￾specific hybrid embryos when incompati￾bility barriers are encountered. This technique 
is used for wide crossing of distantly related 
horticultural species and plays an import￾ant role in haploid production and shorten￾ing breeding cycles. For this, cultures of 
excised embryos obtained at suitable stages of 
development are grown in vitro on a suitable 
nutrient culture medium under controlled 
environmental conditions until they develop 
viable plants that can be acclimatized (Mag￾dalita et al., 1996).
Lack of disease-resistant genotypes in 
Carica is a major constraint to the industry, 
while resistance to all identified papaya dis￾eases are found in the wild relative Vascon￾cellea species (d’Eeckenbrugge et al., 2014). 
Among these diseases, papaya ringspot caused 
by Papaya ringspot virus type P (PRSV-P) is 
widely reported as the most devastating dis￾ease of papaya production worldwide (Azad 
et al., 2014; Mishra et al., 2016). Diseases 
of papaya are comprehensively reviewed 
by Vawdrey and Campbell in Chapter 14, 
this volume. The most sustainable method 
to manage PRSV-P disease is to produce 
improved papaya varieties that contain resist￾ance genes/alleles to the pathogen. A breed￾ing programme for PRSV-P resistance, that 
aimed to transfer resistant genes from Vas￾concellea spp. into the cultivated papaya, is 
proposed to be a sustainable solution to 
control the disease. Crosses between Carica 
papaya and Vasconcellea species were re￾ported as early as 1958 (Jiménez and Horo￾vitz, 1958; Sawant, 1958). However, there is 
a large genetic distance between the two 
genera. Postzygotic disruption has been the 
main hurdle encountered when generating 
intergeneric crosses of C. papaya and Vas￾concellea spp. Often embryos abort before 
differentiating into polyembryonic struc￾tures (Manshardt and Wenslaff, 1989). Ac￾cordingly, the production of hybrid plants 
requires embryo rescue and plantlet pro￾duction in vitro to avoid abortion before 
seeds mature (Magdalita et al., 1996).
Magdalita et al. (1996) reported an im￾proved protocol for embryo rescue to regen￾erate plantlets of C. papaya (clone 2.001) × 
Vasconcellea cauliflora Jacq. A high suc￾cess rate of embryo germination (94%) was 
observed at 90 days after pollination via 
5 days of pre-incubation in liquid medium of 
half-strength DF basal nutrients (De Fossard 
et al., 1974) supplemented with 10 μM gib￾berellic acid, 0.25 μM 6-benzylaminopurine 
(BAP), 0.25 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid 
(NAA) and 2% sucrose. Subsequently, the 
germinated embryos were transferred to 
solid half-strength DS (Drew and Smith, 
1986) medium plus 0.8% agar without add￾ition of supplementary plant growth regu￾lators. This protocol was also successfully 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

applied to other crosses between papaya 
clone 2.001 and other Vasconcellea species 
(Vasconcellea pubescens, Vasconcellea 
goudotiana, Vasconcellea quercifolia and 
Vasconcellea parviflora) (Drew et al., 1998, 
2006) but with varying success rates for dif￾ferent genotypes (Siar et al., 2011; Azad 
et al., 2012). Azad et al. (2012) reported an 
improved embryo rescue protocol using the 
same intergeneric cross used by Magdalita 
et al. (1996) but with different papaya culti￾vars (cultivars ‘Shahi’ and ‘Ranchi’). The 
highest percentage of germination (75%) was 
observed when pre-incubating 90-day-old 
embryos of C. papaya cultivar ‘Shahi’ × V. 
cauliflora on half-strength Murashige and 
Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0.2 
μM BAP, 0.5 μM NAA and 6% sucrose, fol￾lowed by regeneration on growth regulator￾free culture medium.
Tamaki et al. (2011) suggested that the 
quality of an embryo (dimension, germin￾ation ability and/or seedling vigour) could 
be improved by treating immature fruit, as 
young as 65 days old, with ethrel solution 
(100 μl l-1 ethephon: 2-chloroethylphos￾phonic acid for 20 days, resulted in about 
70% embryo germination rate). Using the 
optimal conditions for embryo rescue and 
survival, the papaya breeding cycle could 
be shortened from seed harvesting to seed￾ling establishment and from fruit set to fruit 
harvest by approximately 3 months. Simul￾taneously, a reduction in breeding times 
may be achieved using pure lines created by 
haploid production.
5.2.2 Protoplast culture
During the 1980s to late 1990s, many scien￾tific papers were published describing the 
use of isolated protoplasts to generate trans￾genic plants and somatic hybrids (Davey 
et al., 2005). Protoplast technology has become 
a feasible method in genetic improvement 
of papaya as it has offered the possibility to 
produce virus-free papaya plants and the 
direct transfer of valuable agronomic traits 
from germplasm into cultivated papaya while 
avoiding the barrier of interspecific and 
intergeneric incompatibility. Several attempts 
have been made to isolate protoplasts of 
papaya and wild species (Vasconcellea stip￾ulata and Vasconcellea candamarcensis) 
using tissue of leaf (Litz and Conover, 1979, 
1980; Jordan et al., 1986), hypocotyl, cotyle￾don (Litz, 1986) and callus (Liu et al., 1984; 
Jordan et al., 1986). However, their methods 
of isolation yielded low numbers of viable 
protoplasts and the protoplast cultures were 
unable to regenerate shoots or calli. Several 
years later, Chen and Chen (1992) reported 
successful plant regeneration using proto￾plasts isolated from embryogenic cell suspen￾sions of an intergeneric hybrid from 
C.  papaya and V. cauliflora. Under their 
experimental conditions, protoplast yield was 
1.5 × 106 protoplasts g-1 fresh weight and 
approximately 1.4% of the protoplasts devel￾oped into somatic embryos. The protoplast￾derived somatic embryos proliferated rapidly 
through embryogenesis on modified MS me￾dium supplemented with 1 mg l-1 abscisic acid, 
and further formed plantlets after transfer to 
MS medium without plant growth regulators. 
Although a protoplast-to-plant system has 
been established in papaya, the focus on 
genetic transformation and somatic hybrid￾ization by protoplast-based approaches de￾clined due to low viability of protoplasts and 
difficulty in plant regeneration. Protoplast 
transformation was replaced by other trans￾formation technologies such as Agrobacte￾rium- and biolistic-mediated gene transfer. 
Until the present time, papaya transgenic 
and hybrid cultivars have not been gener￾ated by protoplast techniques.
Recent studies have paid attention to 
the use of protoplast cultures for novel ap￾plications such as gene functional analysis 
and the mechanism of PRSV infection in the 
papaya protoplast. Zhang et al. (2011) in￾vestigated factors affecting the production 
of protoplasts from papaya leaves, aiming to 
optimize isolation conditions for high yield 
and viability of protoplasts, in order to obtain 
sufficient protoplasts for subsequent appli￾cations. Their optimum protocol allows pro￾duction of more than 1.5 × 107
 protoplasts 
g-1 fresh weight with viability of more than 
90%. Jiang and Pan (2012) reported the 
use of protoplast technology to screen for

and identify C2H2 proteins associated with 
defence responses to abiotic and biotic stress￾es in  papaya. Their results showed that 
ZF(30,912.1) could be an important transcription 
factor that plays a role in defence responses 
to abiotic and biotic stresses in papaya.
5.2.3 Double haploid production 
through anther culture
Crop improvement programmes require 
homozygous, genetically pure lines at par￾ticular loci to eventually assemble genotypes 
with desirable gene combinations sourced 
from different backgrounds. Traditional breed￾ing aims to create homozygous and genetic￾ally stable material. However, this may take 
up to 15–20 years to achieve in papaya due 
to the length of time required to produce 
seed for each generation, together with the 
time required to assess for and select indi￾viduals that carry the traits of interest. To 
speed up the movement and incorporation 
of traits of interest into an otherwise genet￾ically elite background, a haploid approach 
may be undertaken. Haploid production may 
be achieved through anther culture (andro￾genesis) (Das et al., 2018). Initially reported 
by Conover and Litz (1978), haploid papaya 
plantlets were developed in liquid MS me￾dium supplemented with 3.0% sucrose, 1.0% 
activated charcoal, 2.0 μM BAP and 0.5 μM 
NAA. This was to establish PRSV-resistant 
haploid cultures of V. stipulata, however, 
the induction efficiency was not reported. 
Tsay and Su (1985) subsequently reported a 
low rate (0.7%) of embryo induction of three 
papaya cultivars, ‘Sunrise’, ‘Tainung-CY’ and 
‘Florida’ (a PRSV-tolerant cultivar), on agar 
medium without the addition of growth regu￾lators. Next, Rimberia et al. (2005) investi￾gated the effects of pre-cultural conditions 
(temperature, physical state of medium and 
sugar starvation) on papaya haploid induc￾tion. Embryos were induced at about 1.0% 
(rate of anthers forming embryos) in MS liquid 
medium at 25ºC for 3 or 5 days. Embryo 
induction increased to 4.0% when the tem￾perature was increased to 35°C. Further￾more, gametic embryogenesis, obtained via 
anther culture, seemed to contribute directly 
to the production of female pure lines in pa￾paya, where female plants are generally more 
productive than hermaphrodites (Rimberia 
et al., 2006). Importantly, anther culture 
techniques contribute directly to the breed￾ing of female papaya parent lines, and when 
successful this can reduce 10 years of breed￾ing time. Meanwhile, another application of 
tissue culture techniques to papaya breeding 
programmes is for the preservation of gen￾etic resources.
5.2.4 Conservation of germplasm
Traditional methods for preservation of plant 
germplasm are seed storage and mainten￾ance of plants in the field (Thinh et al., 
1999). However, the long-term conservation of 
papaya germplasm is not possible through 
seed storage. Like many other tropical fruit 
species, papaya seeds are characterized as 
non-orthodox and can only be stored for 
1–5 years (Ashmore et al., 2001). Con￾versely, stock plant material may be held in 
tissue culture, free of external and disease 
stress and as genetically pure as possible.
In vitro germplasm conservation is fre￾quently used for the management of genetic 
resources that contain a reservoir of genes and 
alleles that are preserved for future utility. 
These may be unique due to isolation in 
genetic evolution of the germplasm involved 
(Cowling et al., 2017) and potentially offer 
rare resources for the future genetic im￾provement of particular traits to the breed￾ing programme. Drew (1992) first proposed 
the storage of papaya explants in vitro by 
substitution of 1% fructose for 2% sucrose 
in growth medium. This technique can be 
used to store cultures for 12 months of incu￾bation at 25°C without subculture. New 
plants may then be regenerated from the 
stock plant material using a growth medium 
that contains suitable nutrients and plant 
growth regulators. The stock plant material 
is also relatively easy to transport and share 
among collaborators when stored in this way 
and may be barcoded following molecular 
genotyping to maintain identity. In future, 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsBiotechnology 53
this may be done in a similar way to the gen￾etic barcodes generated with simple sequence 
repeat (SSR) markers for clover (Jahufer et al., 
2003), guava (Kanupriya et al., 2011) and 
SNP-based molecular barcodes developed 
for wheat collections (Gao et al., 2016).
Meanwhile, several methods for cryo￾preservation of tissues have been developed 
to facilitate long-term storage of papaya 
breeding lines (Yuan-Long et al., 2005; Ash￾more et al., 2007; Kaity et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 
2009). Shoot tips of PRSV transgenic papaya 
lines, after a vitrification-based procedure, 
were successfully cryopreserved with a 90% 
regeneration rate up to 2 months post-thawing 
(Tsai et al., 2009). Meanwhile, shoot tips of 
three non-transgenic varieties, ‘Sunrise’, 
‘Thailand’ and ‘Tainung No. 2’, and 13 trans￾genic lines were successfully vitrified and 
warmed to resume growth within 2 months 
and these developed shoots in the absence 
of intermediate callus formation (Tsai et al., 
2009). Similarly, cryopreservation of the shoot 
tips of six genotypes of papaya (‘Tainung 
No. 1’, ‘Tainung No. 2’, ‘Tainung No. 5’, 
‘Tainung No. 6’, ‘Red Lady’ and ‘Florida’) 
had recovery rates from 48% to 93% (Wang 
et al., 2005), and six out of 12 elite female C. 
papaya genotypes showed high recovery 
rates from 61% to 73% (Kaity et al., 2008). 
However, levels of genomic DNA modifica￾tions (0–10.07%) and methylation modifica￾tions (0.52–6.62%) were detected and may 
indicate some genotype-dependent DNA 
changes occur when using cryopreservation, 
potentially resulting in somaclonal variation 
(Kaity et al., 2008). Apart from vitrification￾based cryopreservation using shoot tips, Azi￾mi et al. (2005) also reported a successful 
cryopreservation method using desiccation 
of papaya seed. Meanwhile, an important 
rationale for the development of stable in vitro
culture for papaya was to ensure successful 
regeneration of genetic transformants.
5.3 Papaya Genetic Transformation
Genetic transformation is a powerful bio￾technology tool that can be used to increase 
the diversity within a gene pool to enable 
improvement in elite genotypes without the 
need to backcross repeatedly to recover an 
original genotype. As mentioned in Section 
5.2.1 ‘Embryo rescue technique’ of this chap￾ter, incompatibility between papaya and the 
wild relative Vasconcellea species is a major 
limitation to the generation of useful inter￾generic hybrids that possess desirable traits. 
Therefore, direct transfer of genetic material 
harbouring the traits of interest through a 
transgenic approach is an excellent strategy 
to rapidly incorporate specific alleles and/
or sequences for individual traits such as 
virus resistance (Gonsalves, 1998). As an ex￾ample, transgenic varieties that are resistant 
to PRSV have been produced successfully and 
are grown commercially in Hawaii (Gon￾salves et al., 2004). Transformation systems 
and the use of transgenic technology to 
introduce important quality and horticul￾tural traits in papaya has been reviewed by 
Mendoza et al. (2008). This has included: 
(i) pathogen and pest-resistant transgenic 
papaya (PRSV, mites and Phytophthora); 
(ii) papaya with delayed ripening for longer 
shelf life through inhibition of ethylene 
production; and (iii) papaya with herbi￾cide and aluminium toxicity tolerances. At 
the time of review, the only promoter used in 
the transformation of papaya was the cauli￾flower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, 
however, a large body of work has been 
achieved subsequently to build on these 
older studies.
The PRSV coat protein was used to pro￾duce the first transgenic resistant line, 55-1, 
in Hawaii (Fitch et al., 1990). PRSV-resistant 
lines were subsequently produced in Brazil, 
Jamaica, Venezuela, Thailand, China and the 
Philippines (summarized in Davidson, 2008). 
Most recently, Jia et al. (2017) optimized a 
particle bombardment transformation sys￾tem to produce transgenic PRSV-resistant 
papaya lines using RNA interference (RNAi) 
hairpin structures from a conserved coat 
protein sequence inserted into a pCAM￾BIA2300-35S-OCS vector. Transgenic line 
474, containing a single transgene insert was 
resistant to PRSV subgroups I, II and III and 
was subsequently deployed in the major 
growing area of Hainan, China.
Another major fungal disease affecting 
papaya production is Phytophthora fruit and

root rot caused by Phytophthora palmivora. 
This pathogen can infect both seedlings and 
mature plant stages, particularly during the 
rainy season and in poorly drained soils 
(Nishijima, 1994). To improve the resistance 
of papaya to Phytophthora, the defensin 
gene from Dahlia merckii was transformed 
into embryogenic calli by particle bombard￾ment (Zhu et al., 2007). The gene construct 
used by Zhu et al. (2007) contained the dah￾lia defensin gene driven by the CaMV 35S 
promoter and the nptII gene under the control 
of the nopaline synthase (NOS) promoter. 
Twenty-one resistant calli were selected 
from 20 bombarded plate cultures. Mean￾while, López-Gómez et al. (2009) generated 
transgenic papaya plants that constitutively 
expressed an 1-aminocyclopropane-1-
carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase fragment using 
the CaMV35S promoter. The transformants 
had delayed fruit ripening, again a useful 
trait for prolonging shelf life when the fruit 
is required to be transported large distances 
and/or stored prior to sale.
Commercialization of transgenic papaya 
resistant to PRSV in Hawaii is a great example 
of technology adoption compared with other 
genetically modified (GM) crops. In this in￾stance, 98% of the growers within a region 
received seed, 73% grew it and of this, 56% 
produced fruit in the second year of cultiva￾tion (Gonsalves et al., 2004). However, so￾cial acceptance and regulatory hurdles of 
growing GM papaya outside the USA and 
China (Azad et al., 2014) currently limit the 
adoption of the technology despite the ad￾vantages of GM papaya globally. Perhaps 
the fact that papaya is consumed largely as 
a fresh and uncooked food also impacts on 
the acceptance of GM varieties (Migicovsky 
and Myles, 2017). This is despite the fact 
that there has not been a single health im￾pact proven to be through consumption of 
any GM food source anywhere.
In the past decade, research related to 
genetic modification has been mostly con￾strained to developing methods to detect 
contamination from GM papaya using PCR 
(Guo et al., 2009; Nakamura et al., 2011, 
2016). Recently, Loo et al. (2019) developed 
a rapid sample-to-answer detection of GM 
papayas with loop-mediated isothermal 
amplification (LAMP) and a compact, portable, 
integrated microfluidic platform using micro￾fluidic lab-on-a-disc (LOAD). GM samples 
were differentiated from non-GM papaya 
based on the detection of a specific GM 
(P-35S – a CaMV 35S promoter) and non-GM 
(papain) DNA marker within 15 minutes. 
Potentially, the dawn of the newer CRISPR/
Cas9 method will enable efficient genetic 
modification of papaya and avoid the label￾ling of GM, as recently achieved in maize 
(Svitashev et al., 2016) and bread wheat (Trit￾icum aestivum) (Liang et al., 2017).
Regardless of the ability to move alleles 
and genes into papaya from external sources, 
the need remains to determine the mechan￾isms and underpinning genetic factors of 
desirable traits, and preferably from 
within the cultigen itself. For this, excellent 
quality genome sequences, genetic maps, 
identification of major QTL, candidate 
genes and characterized selection markers 
are sought.
5.4 The Papaya Genome Project 
and Sequencing Technology
Papaya is considered a model fruit tree for 
genome research: it shared a common ancestor 
with Arabidopsis approximately 72 million 
years ago (Wikström et al., 2001) and has a 
relatively short generation period compared 
with other fruit species. Papaya produces a 
large number of seeds per fruit (approximately 
500–1000) and as previously stated, already 
has a robust in vitro propagation system for 
the production of clonal material for evalu￾ation in multiple environments (Drew et al., 
2004) as well as an established transform￾ation system for genetic and genomics stud￾ies (Fitch et al., 1992). Papaya is also diploid 
with nine pairs of chromosomes 2n = 18 
(Heilborn et al., 1921) and has a relatively 
small genome size (372 Mbp) (Ming et al., 
2008) in comparison to other fruit crops 
such as banana, plum and avocado (875, 883 
and 883 Mbp, respectively) (Arumuganathan 
and Earle, 1991).

(accessed 23 February 2020)). The ‘SunUp’ 
variety of papaya was chosen for sequen￾cing as a representative of the ‘Solo’-type of 
papaya. This had undergone over 25 gener￾ations of inbreeding and thus had an ex￾tremely low level of heterozygosity (Storey, 
1969). The ‘SunUp’ variety was also genet￾ically engineered to produce the PRSV coat 
protein (Lius et al., 1997). A female plant 
was chosen for sequencing to avoid the 
complication of assembling the heterogam￾etic X and Y chromosomes. The draft genome 
sequence was generated using Sanger se￾quencing along with integration of bacterial 
artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences 
and physical and genetic maps (Ming et al., 
2008). From a total of 2.8 million whole￾genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing reads, 
low-quality reads and organelle-based se￾quences were removed, yielding 1.55 million 
high quality reads. Cumulatively, the obtained 
reads represented three-times (3 ×) genome 
coverage. These reads were assembled to 
produce 47,483 contiguous, gap-free se￾quences with 34.9% GC content of 271 Mbp 
that represented ~75% of the papaya genome 
including 90% of the genic regions. The 
contigs derived from WGS were constructed 
into scaffold sequences (spanning 370 Mbp) 
using the physical map and BAC-end sequences 
(Ming et al., 2012).
Although, a significant proportion of the 
sequence remained unassembled (approxi￾mately 25%), the work of Ming et al. (2008) 
represents an important resource for papaya 
research and genetic improvement and was 
used to support evolutionary and genomics 
studies of the Caricaceae. The papaya genome 
was found free of recent genome duplica￾tion and automated annotation of the gen￾ome resulted in ~27,950 genes (Ming et al., 
2008). Consequently, several important gene 
families essential for papaya health and 
fruit development were categorized (Paull 
et al., 2008; Ming et al., 2012). The genome 
analysis revealed that papaya contains an 
extremely small number (55) of disease re￾sistance related genes of the nucleotide￾binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) 
class, while more than 200 NBS-LRR genes 
were found in Arabidopsis  (Meyers et al., 
2002) and more than 600 genes were found 
in rice (Zhou et al., 2004). Interestingly, the 
papaya genome has a similar number of 
genes for cellulose biosynthesis, cell wall 
and lignin syntheses and ethylene biosyn￾thesis as Arabidopsis and poplar. There are 
also fewer genes involved in cell wall deg￾radation and in light-induced biological 
processes of papaya. In contrast, more genes 
associated with starch metabolism and the 
development of volatiles were detected in 
the papaya genome than in Arabidopsis or 
poplar. Ming et al. (2008) and Nagarajan 
et al. (2008) also reported that 52% of the 
papaya genome comprised repetitive elem￾ents, mainly long terminal repeat retrotrans￾posons. This has yielded a significant genetic 
sequence resource that may be further ex￾ploited for pre-breeding.
Recently, sequencing technologies 
such as BAC-by-BAC-based (Sanger et al., 
1977) and Roche 454 (Margulies et al., 
2005) methods have become less popular 
as they have been outcompeted by far more 
affordable high-throughput short-read tech￾nologies such as Illumina HiSeq (Bennett, 
2004; Bentley, 2006) and SOLiD (Shendure 
and Ji, 2008). These newly developed ‘next 
generation sequencing’ (NGS) technologies 
have already contributed to marker-assisted 
breeding approaches in papaya (Nantawan, 
2018). For example, two genotypes of pa￾paya, ‘RB2’ and ‘Sunrise Solo’, were se￾quenced using an Illumina Hi-Seq 4000 
and yielded 32.4 Gb and 30.2 Gb of short 
reads for ‘RB2’ and ‘Sunrise Solo’, respect￾ively, which represented an approximate 
80–85 × coverage of the papaya genome 
(372 Mbp). Over 95% of the reads were 
successfully mapped to the papaya refer￾ence sequence, indicating that the WGS 
sequencing approach was suitable for 
reconstructing these papaya genomes. Sub￾sequently, 239 Mbp of ‘RB2’ and 236 Mbp 
of ‘Sunrise Solo’ genomic sequences were 
produced. Variant analysis of the candi￾date gene sequences between ‘RB2’ and 
‘Sunrise Solo’ genomes revealed sequence 
variation within the coding regions of sweet￾ness related genes, cpAINV2 and cpSPS3
(Nantawan, 2018).

5.5 Gene Identification 
and Characterization
Genetic improvement of papaya will benefit 
from the isolation, functional analysis and 
eventual incorporation of genes that underlie 
desirable traits. The identification of genes 
responsible for important agricultural traits 
in papaya has been mostly conducted by 
construction of genetic maps and traditional 
molecular genetics using rapid amplifica￾tion of cDNA ends (RACE) and quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques 
(Razean Haireen, 2013). Recent and future 
advances in sequence technologies, poly￾morphism detection and genome editing pose 
potential applications for selection and incorp￾oration of polygenically controlled traits. 
This will necessitate the identification of 
additional genes governing fruit quality 
traits and disease resistance in papaya.
5.5.1 Genes related to papaya fruit 
quality traits
Since the first draft of the papaya genome 
sequence was published by Ming et al. 
(2008), several genes related to fruit quality 
traits were discovered including those re￾lated to flesh colour (Blas et al., 2010), fruit 
ripening (Fabi et al., 2012; Sanimah et al., 
2013) and sweetness (Paull et al., 2008; 
Nantawan et al., 2018). Many studies have 
applied genome sequencing techniques for 
gene cloning and gene characterization (Chen 
et al., 2003), transcript derived fragment 
(TDF) profiling for protein identification 
(Fabi et al., 2009b, 2012), transcriptome 
sequencing for identification of phytochem￾ical associated genes in ripening fruit (Sanimah 
et al., 2013), and comparative expressed se￾quence tag (EST) analysis for developing new 
SSR and SNP markers (Zeng et al., 2014). A 
number of genes related to fruit ripening have 
been predicted through comparative analysis 
of the papaya genome with those present in 
other species: Arabidopsis, tomato and grape 
(Paull et al., 2008; Fabi et al., 2012). These 
tools allow researchers to investigate puta￾tive genes and to develop effective molecular 
markers, which are tightly linked to the genes 
controlling fruit quality traits.
Fruit flesh colour was thought to be a 
single gene trait (Hofmeyr, 1938; Storey, 1969), 
with yellow colour dominant over red. 
Subsequently, studies of the lycopene￾carotenoid pathway have indicated that 
lycopene β-cyclase is involved in the alteration 
between red and yellow flesh colour. In 
2006, Skelton et al. identified the first major 
gene (CpLCY-B) for lycopene β-cyclase pro￾duction in papaya using a candidate gene 
approach. Other genes influencing flesh col￾our in papaya are LCY-B2 (Devitt et al., 2010), 
CpPDS and CpZDS (Yan et al., 2011). A full 
sequence of the flesh colour gene (CpCyC-b) in 
papaya was published along with a marker 
(CPCF2) located 580 bp away from the gene 
(Blas et al., 2010). In addition, the NAC 
(NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) transcription 
factor (CpNAC1) was detected as a major 
regulator in the expression of carotenoid 
biosynthesis genes, phytoene desaturases 
(CpPDSs). CpNAC1 was upregulated during 
fruit ripening and by propylene treatment, 
which correlates well with the elevated 
CpPDSs transcription level and carotenoid 
content in papaya (Fu et al., 2016).
In recent years, fruit eating quality has 
attracted research interest to increase the 
value and expansion of the papaya market. 
Researchers have begun work on gene clon￾ing studies and differential gene expression 
analysis for marker development with respect 
to a range of important fruit quality traits. 
Cloning and characterization of papaya 
putative cell wall invertase and sucrose 
synthase genes from papaya ‘Sunset’ was 
performed by Zhou et al. (2003) to investi￾gate the relationship between the expres￾sion and activities of invertase and sucrose 
synthase genes and enzymes during fruit 
development. The result from gene expres￾sion analysis by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) suggested that the enhanced 
expression and activity of cell wall invert￾ase was possibly related to the accumulation 
of sugars at late fruit development, while 
sucrose synthase was possibly involved in 
the early stages (Zhou et al., 2003). Fabi et al. 
(2009a) investigated transcripts from the 
pulp of unripe and ripe fruit of papaya 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

‘Golden’ and differential expression observed 
by qPCR. Fabi et al. (2009a) indicated the 
involvement of ten downregulated genes 
during ripening, which code for a UDP￾glucose glucosyltransferase, α-2 importin, 
RNase L inhibitor-like protein and a syntaxin 
protein. The upregulated genes were a car￾boxylesterase, an integral membrane Yip1 
family protein, a glycosyl hydrolase family￾like protein and an endopolygalacturonase. 
The same technique was applied to study 
the change in expression level of 1-amino￾cyclopropane 1-carboxylate oxidase (cpACO2) 
and 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylate 
synthase (cpACS1 and cpACS2) genes for 
encoding ethylene formation during fruit 
ripening (Chen et al., 2003; Othman and 
Nuraziyan, 2010). In addition, coding se￾quences related to flesh softening have been 
published as a result of gene expression stud￾ies and comparative analyses. These have 
included subtilase (cpSUB1) genes involved 
in fruit cell wall modification (Othman and 
Nuraziyan, 2010), β-galactosidase (cpb-GAL) 
(Lazan et al., 2004; Othman et al., 2011), 
polygalacturonase (cpPG) (Fabi et al., 2009a) 
and endoxylanase (cpEXY1) (Manenoi and 
Paull, 2007) for fruit softening during ripening. 
Other putative genes related to cell wall 
softening detected by Arabidopsis-based 
microarray and qPCR were reported by Fabi 
et al. (2012, 2014) including pectin methyl￾esterase (PME), polygalacturonase isoforms 
(cpPG1, cpPG2, cpPG3, cpPG4) and α-galac￾tosidase (A-GAL). The A-GAL gene was also 
proposed to play a role in sugar alcohol me￾tabolism in papaya (Sanimah et al., 2013).
Transcription factors also have a role in 
the regulation of fruit quality traits. Differ￾ential expressions of transcription factors of 
the MADS-box, NAC and AP2/ERF gene 
families during papaya fruit development 
were observed by Fabi et al. (2012) using 
microarray and qPCR analysis. Five mem￾bers of the MYB family were differentially 
expressed during ripening. Three closely￾related AP2/ERF genes had diverse expres￾sions throughout papaya ripening, with an 
AP2 gene (AT4G39780) and an ERF gene 
(AT1G15360) being upregulated. Three gene 
members of the auxin signalling pathway 
(ARF18, AXR1 and ARP) were identified, 
with ARP being the only upregulated gene 
during ripening (Fabi et al., 2012). Further￾more, the expression profiles of four ethylene 
response factors (cpERFs) were examined 
during fruit development, under 1-MCP 
treatment, ethephon treatment, biotic stress 
(temperature stress) and pathogen stress (Li 
et al., 2013). CpERF2 and CpERF3 showed a 
close association with fruit ripening and all 
tested cpERFs had a high expression level in 
the earlier fruit development stage (Li et al., 
2013). In addition, 11 auxin response factors 
(cpARFs) were reported to regulate the flower 
development and fruit ripening processes 
in papaya (Liu et al., 2015).
Recently, gene studies have attempted 
to search for novel genes, transcripts and 
allelic variants for important biological 
processes related to fruit quality traits of 
papaya using NGS. Nine putative enzymes 
and a unigene associated with sugar alcohol 
pathways were identified using mRNA 
sequencing and the analysis of fruit from 
papaya ‘Eksotika’ (Sanimah et al., 2013). 
These coded for α-galactosidase, α-glucosi￾dase, β-glucosidase, β-fructofuranosidase, 
myo-inositol monophosphatase, xylose isom￾erase, fructose biphosphate aldose, ribose 
5-phosphate isomerase and arabinose kinase. 
Also, a combined and comparative genom￾ics approach was undertaken by Nantawan 
(2018) using sequencing and qPCR tech￾niques, to uncover the putative sweetness￾related genes within the papaya genotype 
‘Sunrise Solo’ (Nantawan et al., 2018). Iden￾tification of genes was achieved by assessing 
transcription profiles and their associa￾tion(s) with sucrose accumulation. This 
included assessing the expression of four 
invertase (cpCWINV, cpAINV), three sucrose 
synthase (cpSUS) and four sucrose phos￾phate synthase (cpSPS) genes in two papaya 
genotypes, ‘RB2’ and ‘Sunrise Solo’. In all 
harvest stages, ‘Sunrise Solo’ showed greater 
expression of cpCWINV1 than ‘RB2’ ran￾ging from 0.5- to 4-fold increases. Other dif￾ferentially expressed genes were cpAINV2, 
cpSPS1 and cpSPS3, which were highly 
expressed in genotype ‘Sunrise Solo’ during 
ripening stages. A relationship between the 
tested genes and the sweetness was as￾sessed and presented in Fig. 5.1. The genomic

locations of the differentially expressed 
genes were identified and sequence variants 
within these target genes were identified as 
further evidence for their role in the sweet￾ness trait and potential for validation as can￾didate sweetness markers in future selective 
breeding strategies.
5.5.2 Genes related to papaya disease 
resistance
The first resistance gene analogues (RGAs) in 
papaya, which encoded for nucleotide bind￾ing site (NBS) proteins, were isolated by 
Amaral et al. (2006). They used degenerate 
oligonucleotide primers drawn from highly 
conserved motifs of published R genes in the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) database. The availability of the papaya 
genome sequence (Ming et al., 2008) con￾tributed to the understanding of the roles 
of putative PRSV R genes in durable and 
stable resistance in Vasconcellea species and 
C. papaya (Porter et al., 2009).
To characterize PRSV resistance genes in 
V. pubescens, the marker Opa11_5r, linked 
to PRSV resistance in V. pubescens, was se￾quenced, aligned to the NCBI database and 
shown to have similarity to a kinase (STK) 
gene (Dillon et al., 2006). Novel genes of 
VP_STK1, VP_STK2 and VP_LRR1 were 
characterized from V. pubescens (Razean 
Haireen, 2013). The full sequence of STK 
genes revealed a 1bp insertion/deletion in 
the coding region of V. pubescens and was 
predicted to be derived from alternative

splicing (Razean Haireen, 2013). Gene expres￾sion supported the function of VP_STK2 in 
relation to resistance to PRSV in V. pubescens
as it was upregulated 15 days after inocula￾tion. Two genes, VQ_STK2 and VQ_LRR1, 
were identified and characterized from 
V. quercifolia using RACE PCR (Kanchana￾udomkan, 2015) based on serine/threonine 
kinase protein sequences which were char￾acterized in V. pubescens (Razean Haireen 
and Drew, 2014). Both genes, in both species, 
shared homology at a high level (88.81% for 
the STK2 gene and 99% for the LRR1 gene). 
Subsequently, gene sequence information 
was used to design primers to study the 
gene expression. In V. quercifolia, VQ_STK2
and VQ_LRR1 were expressed and upregu￾lated 5 days after infection, while this pat￾tern was not detected in C. papaya ‘2.001’, a 
susceptible control. The lowest expression 
of both genes in ‘2.001’ occurred at 20 days 
after infection which was the same day that 
the CP gene started to be upregulated. 
Therefore, the STK2 and LRR1 genes could 
play an important role in PRSV resistance 
in Vasconcellea spp., though research is 
needed to confirm this hypothesis.
To understand the mechanisms involved 
in papaya sticky disease (PSD) symptoms, 
the global gene expression patterns of C. pa￾paya infected with Papaya meleira virus
(PMeV) (PMeV2 and PMeV complex) at pre￾and post-flowering stages were assessed by 
RNA sequencing analysis (Madroñero et al., 
2018). The result revealed 633 and 88 differ￾entially expressed genes at pre- and post￾flowering stages, respectively. Genes related 
to stress and transport were upregulated 
while metabolism-related genes were down￾regulated at the pre-flowering stage. At post￾flowering, when PSD symptoms appeared, 
the downregulation of the PR-1 encoding gene 
and the induction of BSMT1 and JA metab￾olism-related genes were observed. The results 
reveal that host stress responses mediated by 
salicylic acid (SA) are active at pre-flowering 
and likely account for prevention of sticky 
disease symptoms until post-flowering; also, 
that SA signalling plays a role in altering 
PMeV and PMeV2 load. However, the activa￾tion of genes whose functions limit the SA 
signal, such as the natriuretic peptide re￾ceptor 1 (NPR1)-inhibitor candidate gene, 
NPR1-I/NIM1-I (nitroimidazole resistance 
protein), UGT (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) 
and ET (effector of transcription), may prevent 
the full-scale and long-lasting SA-associated 
resistance, allowing PSD symptoms to de￾velop (Madroñero et al., 2018).
5.6 Genetic Linkage Maps of Papaya 
and Identification of QTL
The use of mapping populations that segregate 
for traits of interest has been the principle 
approach to identify molecular marker–trait 
association in papaya. The map position of 
major genes and QTL governing trait expres￾sion can be identified through the analysis 
of cosegregation between markers and traits. 
Despite the advent of molecular techniques 
and the genome database, genetic linkage 
and QTL identification in papaya has lagged 
behind that in other plant species.
Initially, a linkage map of papaya was 
constructed by Sondur et al. (1996) using an 
F2
 population of 253 individuals derived 
from a ‘Sunrise Solo’ × line UH356 cross. 
A total of 596 random amplified polymorphic 
DNA (RAPD) primers were screened, and 96 
polymorphisms were detected. About 80% 
of these markers conformed to expected 
Mendelian segregation ratios.  At an LOD 
(logarithm of the odds) of 4.0, 62 non-distorted 
markers (61 RAPD markers and morpho￾logical marker sex type) were divided into 
11 linkage groups (LGs). The map spread 
over 999.3 cM with an average gap between 
markers of 19.6 cM. In 2004, amplified frag￾ment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based 
genetic maps were produced by Srinivasan 
and Manshardt (2004) and Ma et al. (2004). 
The genetic map constructed by Srinivasan 
and Manshardt (2004) was based on 281 F2
population derived from ‘Kapoho’ × ‘Saipan 
Red’. A total of 513 AFLP markers, an isozyme 
marker, and a morphological marker for sex 
type were mapped into 15 LGs that covered 
2066 cM. Ma et al. (2004) applied 1501 
markers, including 1498 AFLP markers, the

PRSV coat protein marker, morphological 
sex type, and fruit flesh colour, to construct 
the linkage map on an F2
 population com￾prising 54 individuals from a cross between 
‘Kapoho’ and the transgenic papaya ‘SunUp’. 
This map comprised 12 LGs with a total 
genetic distance of 3294.2 cM. The resolution 
of this map showed a significant improve￾ment in average distance between markers 
over the 2.2 cM map of Sondur et al. (1996). 
Later, Chen et al. (2007) generated a linkage 
map from 54 F2
 plants of ‘AU9’ × ‘SunUp’ 
using 706 SSR markers and one morpho￾logical marker (fruit flesh colour). The markers 
mapped to nine major and three minor LGs, 
spanning 1068.9 cM with an average distance 
of 1.5 cM between markers (Chen et al., 2007). 
Blas et al. (2012) exploited the same mapping 
population and added another 277 AFLP mark￾ers and reduced the average marker interval to 
0.9 cM and joining several minor LGs to major 
ones. This recent map spans 945.2 cM and 
covers nine major and five minor LGs. Mean￾while, the whole genome sequence of papaya 
‘SunUp’ was released in 2008 by Ming et al. 
(2008; available at: http://www.plantgdb.org/
XGDB/phplib/download.php?GDB=Cp (ac￾cessed 23 February 2020)), making the devel￾opment of integrating physical and genetic 
maps of papaya possible (Yu et al., 2009). 
However, there are still many minor LGs and 
unmapped contigs on this current genetic 
map of papaya which may be resolved with 
larger populations and more markers.
Only a few QTL have been mapped on 
the papaya genome due to a lack of high￾density maps and poor trait quantification 
tools (Ming et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009). A total 
of nine QTL were first reported for plant 
height, stem diameter and node of first flower￾ing, with phenotypic variance explained 
ranging from 12% to over 77% (Sondur et al., 
1996). Three QTL influenced fruit weight 
and explained over 87% of the total pheno￾typic variance among 253 F2
 progeny from 
the cross ‘Sunrise Solo’ × line UH356. The 
QTL for fruit weight were located on LG 1, 2 
and 7. QTL affecting node number at floral 
conversion, number of carpellody fruit and 
fruit weight were observed by Srinivasan 
and Manshardt (2004) using 281 F2
 progeny 
from the cross ‘Kapoho’ × ‘Saipan Red’. One 
major QTL was found for node number at 
floral conversion on LG 4 that explained 
64.3% of the trait variation. Four QTL as￾sociated with carpellody characteristics 
aligned in blocks on LG 2, 3, 4 and 7 explain￾ing from 13.2% to 68.1% of the phenotypic 
variance. A QTL peak for fruit weight was 
unable to be detected, however, single marker 
analysis showed five markers from LG 2, 3 
and 7 significantly associated with this trait 
(P = 0.005). In another QTL analysis performed 
by Blas et al. (2012), 14 QTL for weight, 
diameter, length and shape of papaya fruit 
were reported with phenotypic effects ran￾ging from 5% to 37%. These QTL were mapped 
on LG 2, 3, 7 and 9 using a mapping popula￾tion of 219 F2
 from ‘Khaek Dum’ × line 2H94 
(Blas et al., 2012).
Recently, advanced SNP methods have 
been used extensively on saturated linkage 
maps to accurately identify QTL and candi￾date genes in several fruit crops, for example 
in zucchini (Montero-Pau et al., 2017) and 
tomato (Celik et al., 2017). Among the SNP 
genotyping system available, the genotyping￾by-sequencing (GBS) approach based on 
high-throughput sequencing is rapid and 
cost-effective (Ma et al., 2012; Ward et al., 
2013; Gardner et al., 2014). The advantage 
of GBS technology is that it holds great 
promise for simplifying the construction 
of high-density maps and identifying QTL 
linked to economically important traits in 
papaya, which has a narrow genetic base and 
a low rate of molecular marker polymor￾phisms (Matos et al., 2013). Nantawan (2018) 
attempted to develop an SNP linkage map 
and identify key genomic locations under￾lying key fruit quality traits using a GBS 
approach in papaya. The steps in the GBS 
library construction sequencing and ana￾lysis are shown in Fig. 5.2. Twenty-one QTL 
conditioning seven fruit quality traits in￾cluding flesh sweetness, fruit weight, fruit 
length, fruit width, skin freckle, flesh thick￾ness and fruit firmness were detected using 
226 F2
 progeny from ‘RB2’ × ‘Sunrise Solo’. 
Several QTL for flesh sweetness, fruit 
weight, length, width and firmness were 
stable across harvest years and individually 
explained up to 19.8% of the phenotypic 
variance of a particular trait.

5.7 Molecular Markers for Papaya 
Crop Improvement
Molecular markers have contributed im￾mensely to the development of papaya breed￾ing. The advanced technologies of genome 
sequencing and gene identification have 
dramatically changed the way molecular mark￾ers in papaya have been developed. A review 
of molecular marker development in papaya 
was published by Kanchana-udomkan et al. 
(2014) and this chapter presents updated 
research subsequent to this review.
The use of molecular marker-assisted 
breeding poses great potential to reduce the 
time, cost and effort involved in papaya 
breeding. By molecular analysis, trait selec￾tion can be more precise without environmen￾tal interference. In addition, screening for 
traits of interest can be achieved at early growth 
stages. However, the success of molecular￾assisted breeding relies on several factors 
such as marker types, transferability, marker–
gene association and genetic backgrounds.
Developments in molecular marker tech￾niques have made it possible for papaya sex 
types to be accurately differentiated at an 
early stage. Kanchana-udomkan et al. (2018) 
developed a high-throughput PCR-based 
detection system without prior DNA extrac￾tion to discriminate papaya sex type at the 
seedling stage using sequence-characterized

amplified region (SCAR) markers. This tech￾nique is being applied in the current Austra￾lian papaya breeding programme. Tsai et al. 
(2016) developed a rapid and efficient method 
for detecting the male/hermaphrodite-specific 
marker to examine papaya sex type based 
on the LAMP assays without prior DNA 
purification. Abreu et al. (2015) developed 
a probe for a fluorescence in situ hybridiza￾tion (FISH) protocol to differentiate between 
hermaphrodite and female papaya, which 
gave fluorescent signals in hermaphrodite 
nuclei isolated from leaves, but no detect￾able fluorescence in female nuclei.
Although, the use of MAS in papaya has 
been very scarce, a molecular marker linked 
to the underlying genes for trait expression 
may be extremely useful in future research. 
Functional genomics methods and gene studies 
have made it possible to develop markers from 
genes themselves. With increased informa￾tion on genes available in the database, ap￾plication of the sequencing and candidate 
gene approach can be combined to acceler￾ate the development of new markers within 
a marker-assisted breeding programme.
5.8 Conclusion
Biotechnology tools for papaya have been 
developed continuously over the last 30 
years. Knowledge of tissue culture, genetic 
engineering, gene expression and genomic 
studies have enabled improvement of papaya 
via precision breeding. The invaluable 
resources derived from genome projects 
will continue to serve as a platform for the 
papaya research community. Advance sequen￾cing technology such as PacBio single￾molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing may 
be considered to address the issues of in￾complete, highly fragmented and missing 
complex repeat regions of the previously pub￾lished reference genome (Morrell et al., 2012). 
Advancements in high-throughput sequen￾cing technologies will lead to the increased 
availability of the whole genome sequences 
for specific papaya genotypes, to enable faster 
marker development. This will also open up 
prospects for rapid high-throughput geno￾typing.
Additionally, targeted genome editing 
such as zinc-finger nuclease (Miller et al., 
2007), TALENs (Joung and Sander, 2013) and 
CRISPR/Cas9 (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014) 
may be utilized to discover more agronom￾ically and economically important genes. 
Knowing the candidate genes for traits of 
interest and having the knowledge of exact 
functional nucleotide polymorphisms within 
the gene and/or genetic controller, breeders 
can select for and create elite varieties in a 
fast and efficient manner.

6.1 Introduction
There are many distinct, true breeding papaya 
varieties in the world today. Many of these 
were developed from systematic breeding 
programmes and selections were made by 
growers. Recently, transgenic varieties were 
developed through biotechnology processes. 
It is estimated that more than 300 papaya 
varieties are available in the world.
6.2 Varietal Diversity
The varietal diversity in papaya is broad with 
regards to horticultural traits, viz. length of 
the juvenile phase, plant stature, leaf shape 
and size, inflorescence types, flower, fruit and 
seed characters, stress susceptibility and re￾actions to pests and pathogens (IBPGR, 1988). 
The most distinctive and economically most 
significant phenotypic traits of papaya var￾ieties are related to flower and fruit charac￾teristics. The inflorescence peduncles of male 
plants are 60–90 cm to over 150 cm long 
and pendulous and bear numerous smaller 
trumpet-shaped flowers with the petals and 
stamens fused in a narrow tube which has 
flared lobes. Generally large fruits of certain 
varieties vary from spherical or ovoid to pear 
shaped or elongate and from 10 cm to 50 cm in 
length. Fruit weight and pulp colour can vary 
from 0.35 kg to 12 kg with yellow, orange 
or reddish pulp dependent on selection by 
growers for specific local markets.
Morphological characterization is one of 
the ways to estimate the genetic diversity and 
identification of duplicates. The germplasm 
of papaya has been characterized by using the 
Bioversity International descriptor (IBPGR, 
1988). Chan (1985) characterized the ger￾mplasm of papaya for traits, viz. earliness, 
height at first fruiting, fruit weight and quality. 
Silva et al. (2017) also studied 17 morpho￾agronomic variables from 59 accessions of 
the active germplasm bank in Linhares, Espír￾ito Santo, Brazil. The fruit weight, fruit diam￾eter and plant height parameters contributed 
the most to the genetic diversity.
The major advantage of molecular 
methods over phenotyping for characterizing 
diversity is the greater resolution at the DNA 
level and that sequences can provide a direct 
link to diagnostic genes. The molecular methods 
exclude all environmental influences; these 
can be applied at any developmental phase. 
Identification of genetic diversity relation￾ships and germplasm identification have 
been determined by using several molecular

markers, namely random amplified poly￾morphic DNA (RAPD), restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (RFLP), inter-simple 
sequence repeat (ISSR), amplified fragment 
length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple se￾quence repeat (SSR) markers (Jesus et al., 
2012). Among the molecular markers, RAPD 
and ISSR markers have been extensively used 
to study genetic diversity and relationships in 
papaya germplasm and can be utilized in its 
genetic improvement (Rodriguez et al., 2010; 
Saran et al., 2015). The earliest published 
molecular study of genetic diversity in papaya 
germplasm was on a small group of seven 
Hawaiian ‘Solo’ cultivars and three unre￾lated papaya lines, using RAPD markers (Stiles 
et al., 1993).
6.2.1 Varieties growing in different 
countries
Australia
Both dioecious and gynodioecious varieties of 
papaya are grown in Australia. The Queens￾land papaya industry is mainly based on di￾oecious outcrossed varieties which are high 
yielders (Chay-Prove et al., 2000). In north 
Queensland, yellow hybrids ‘Hybrid 1B’ and 
‘Hybrid 11B’ and the red-fleshed Hawaiian 
‘Sunrise Solo’ and ‘Hybrid 29’ are grown in 
the lower rainfall areas. In central Queens￾land yellow-fleshed hybrids ‘Hybrid 29’ and 
‘Hybrid 14’ are grown while in south-east 
Queensland inbred yellow-fleshed lines and 
‘Richter Gold’ lines are in cultivation. Red￾fleshed papaya ‘RB1’ (Fig. 6.1), ‘RB2’, ‘RB4’, 
‘Skybury’ and ‘IB’ are presently preferred by the 
growers (Chutchamas Kanchana-udomkan, 
Nathan, Queensland, Australia, 2017, personal 
communication; Ian Bally, Queensland, 
Australia, 2017, personal communication).
The main cultivars of Australia are 
‘Improved Petersen’, ‘Petersen Hybrid No. 
5’, ‘Yarwun Yellow’, ‘Gold Cross’, ‘Goldy’, ‘Hong 
Kong’, ‘Guinea Gold’, ‘Golden Surprise’, 
‘Sunny Bank’, ‘Sunnybank/S7’ and ‘Richter/
Arline’. ‘Guinea Gold’ is a yellow-pulp 
hermaphrodite cultivar. ‘Improved Petersen’, 
‘Sunnybank/S7’ and ‘Richter/Arline’ are di￾oecious and have yellow pulp. The Australian 
papaya industry has differentiated the mar￾ket according to papaya flesh colour: yellow 
papaya and red papaya. The varieties are 
‘H1B’, ‘H13’ (yellow pulp), ‘RB1’, ‘RB2’ and 
‘RB4’ (pink/red pulp).
Brazil
The production of papaya is mainly based on 
the Taiwan variety ‘Tainung 1’ (99%) and ‘Bela 
Vista’ (1%). ‘Sunrise Solo’ is grown for the 
domestic market. ‘Golden THB’ is also in 
cultivation (O. Yamanishi, Brasilia, Brazil, 
2017, personal communication).
Caribbean
The main cultivars are: (i) ‘Wakefield’, 
‘Graeme 5’ and ‘Graeme 7’ from Barbados; (ii) 
the hermaphrodite and red-pulp cultivar 
‘Maradol Roja’ (short-statured and bears 
fruit very close to the ground, fruit are about 
2.6 kg in weight, elongate in shape with 
green or yellow skin) from Cuba; (iii) herm￾aphrodite yellow-pulp cultivar ‘Cartagena’ 
from the Dominican Republic; and (iv) ‘Santa 
Cruz Giant’ and ‘Cedro’ from Trinidad.

Fiji
‘Fiji Red’ is grown commercially. Fruits are 
400–600 g in weight, sweet (total soluble 
solids (TSS) 10–120°Brix) with red-coloured 
pulp which has good keeping quality (Stice 
et al., 2010).
India
Papaya breeding and selection work has been 
carried out for over 30 years beginning with 
100 introduced strains and 16 local variations. 
About 30 varieties of papaya are grown in 
India. The varieties cultivated in India show 
great diversity based on their height (tall, 
medium or dwarf), vigour (dwarf to vigorous), 
stem and petiole colour (yellow, green and 
purple), utilization (fresh fruit or papain), 
pulp colour (yellow, orange, pink or red), sex 
expression (dioecious or gynodioecious), etc. 
The improvement work was done at several 
stations.
The breeding programme at Indian 
Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) Re￾gional Station, Pusa (Bihar), initiated in 
1966, has led to the release of five varieties: 
‘Pusa Majesty’, ‘Pusa Dwarf’, ‘Pusa Nanha’, 
‘Pusa Delicious’ and ‘Pusa Giant’. A system￾atic papaya breeding programme was 
started at G.B. Pant University of Agricul￾ture and Technology, Pantnagar, India lead￾ing to the development of three superior 
varieties: ‘Pant 1’, ‘Pant 2’ and ‘Pant 3’. 
Similarly, Tamil Nadu Agricultural Univer￾sity (TNAU) also started work on papaya 
improvement at Coimbatore. It has released 
eight varieties: ‘CO.1’, ‘CO.2’, ‘CO.3’, ‘CO.4’, 
‘CO.5’, ‘CO.6’, ‘CO.7’ and ‘CO.8’.
At the Indian Institute of Horticultural 
Research (IIHR) Bengaluru, improvement 
work was started in the early 1970s with a 
view to develop gynodioecious types.  At 
the Regional Station, Chettalli, the cultivar 
‘Coorg Honey Dew’ has been developed. At 
the main institute two gynodioecious culti￾vars, viz. ‘Arka Surya’ and ‘Arka Prabhath’ 
have been developed.

are also available.
Kenya
Papaya was introduced in Kenya during the 
colonial times. The varieties were intro￾duced from Hawaii (‘Solo’), the Philippines 
(‘Cavity Special’), India (‘Coorg Honey Dew’) 
and Indonesia. The other varieties available 
are ‘Red Lady’, ‘Sunrise’, ‘Apoyo’, ‘Kiru’, 
‘Papyi’, etc. (Asudi, 2010).

Malaysia
A number of varieties were selected/bred 
from Malaysia. The main commercial var￾iety is ‘Eksotika II’.
‘batu arang’. This is a gynodioecious variety 
suitable for the table and for processing. 
The fruits are medium sized, about 1.5 kg 
with red pulp that is thick, firm and sweet 
(TSS 12–13°Brix).
‘eksotika’ (‘sunrise solo’ × ‘subang 6’). This is 
a self-pollinated hermaphrodite cultivar. 
The fruits are small to medium in size (400–
800 g). The fruit has orange-red pulp with a 
pleasant aroma and high sugar content of 
12–14°Brix but it does not keep well owing 
to its soft texture. It is also quite susceptible 
to fruit freckles (Fig. 6.5) and malformed top 
disease.
‘eksotika ii’ (‘eksotika’ line 19 × line 20). This is 
a hermaphrodite cultivar. The fruit is large 
(600–800 g) with a smooth skin and high 
tolerance to freckles. The pulp is firm with 
good keeping quality and the fruit stores 
longer, making ‘Eksotika II’ more preferred 
than its predecessor for export (Chan, 1993).
‘frangi’. This was developed by Malaysian 
Agrifood Corporation Berhad (MAFC) from 
hybridization of two inbred lines ‘LSGC 1’ 
and ‘LSG 2’. It is a high-yielding hybrid. The fruit 
is attractive with a uniform full-yellow skin 
at ripening. Its delicate flavour and fragrance 
are unique and its deep salmon-coloured 
pulp is very sweet with Brix above 13°. 
‘Frangi’ has a long storage life. ‘Frangi’ was 
later marketed under the brand name ‘Paiola’ 
(Chan and Baharuddin, 2010).
‘morib’. This is an interesting local selection 
with fruit that has an attractive yellow skin 
even at an immature stage. The tree is dwarf 
and has yellowish-green foliage.
‘sekaki’ (also known as ‘hong kong’ papaya).
This is the second most popularly culti￾vated hermaphrodite cultivar in Malaysia 
after ‘Eksotika’. It is a dwarf cultivar and a 
prolific bearer (60–70 t ha-1 year-1) with 
medium-size fruit of 1.5–2 kg. The fruit is 
attractive with smooth, freckle-free skin 
(Fig. 6.6) and red pulp that is firm with a sugar 
content of 10°Brix. It is also easy to manage 
in the field because of its tolerance to mal￾formed top disease.
‘sitiawan’. This is a gynodioecious selection 
with vigorous plants. The fruits are long 
and cylindrical while female fruits are more 
rounded. Pulp colour is red but paler at the

periphery of the skin, with low TSS (10°Brix). 
The fruit size is very large ranging from 2 kg 
to 4 kg (Chan et al., 1994).
‘subang 6’. This is a hermaphrodite cultivar. 
The fruits are long and cylindrical with bright 
red pulp that is firm and has 10.5–11.5% TSS. 
The average fruit weight is around 1.3 kg.
Mauritius
The most known varieties are ‘Farc’, ‘Rose 
Belle’, ‘Uganda Female’, ‘Uganda Red’, ‘Gool￾and Pink’, ‘Long Orange’, ‘Ramnan’, ‘Chinni￾ah’ and ‘Wilcox’. The pulp colour of ‘Ramnan’ 
is reddish orange while it is bright yellow in 
‘Farc’ and deep yellow to orange in ‘Uganda 
Female’. The fruit size of ‘Long Orange’ 
is  about 1.26 kg while it is about 2.0 kg 
in  ‘Ramnan’ (Madarbokus and Ranghoo￾Sanmukhiya, 2012).
Mexico
In Mexico, the major papaya-growing areas 
are devoted to the Cuban cultivar, ‘Red Mara￾dol’. Other papaya varieties cultivated are 
‘Hawaian’, ‘Cera’ and ‘Mamey’ (Calderon et al., 
2014) and also ‘Verde’, ‘Gialla’ and ‘Chincona’. 
More recently two ‘Maradol’ type cultivars 
were released: ‘Kanput’ and ‘Chakput’ (Jose 
Saul Padilla, Merida, Mexico, 2017, personal 
communication).
‘red maradol’. This cultivar originated from 
Cuba. The fruit is 2.5 kg in weight and it has 
yellow-orange skin with red pulp with TSS 
10–11°Brix.
‘maradol roja’. This cultivar originated in 
Cuba. It has small to medium-sized fruit and 
is sweet with good aroma.
‘mexican red’. This is a red-pulp papaya that 
is higher in flavour than ‘Mexican Yellow’. 
It has medium to large fruit (1–3 kg) but is 
generally not as sweet as Hawaiian types.
‘mexican yellow’. This is a very sweet variety 
with pleasant aroma. It has medium to large 
fruit, yellow pulp and is a prolific bearer.
‘msxj’. This is a hermaphrodite and carpel￾lody-free cultivar developed from a cross 
between ‘J’ hybrid and ‘MST’. The fruits are 
elongated in shape, 10–13 cm in diameter with 
red pulp and weighing 1.4–1.7 kg per fruit 
with TSS content 11°Brix (Mirafuentes￾Hernandez and Santamaria-Basulto, 2014).
The Philippines
The commonly known Philippine varieties 
are ‘Cavity Special’, ‘Sinta’, ‘Solo’ and ‘Red 
Lady’ (Teixeira da Silva et al., 2007). Eighteen 
F1
 hybrids from different crosses of highly in￾bred plants were generated (Magdalita et al., 
2007). Out of these, three promising hybrids 
with suitable industrial criteria (bright red 
and thick pulp) and good fruit quality (sweet, 
firm, high edible portion, pleasant flavour 
and aroma) plus tolerance to Papaya ringspot 
virus (PRSV) were identified. The hybrid 
‘Kapoho’ × ‘Tainung’ was reported better in terms 
of fruit weight (0.98 kg) and TSS (12.94°Brix) 
compared with the parent (‘Tainung’) (Magdalita 
et al., 2007).
‘cavity special’. This is a semi-dwarf variety 
that comes into bearing 6–8 months after 
planting. The fruit is long, oblong and 3–5 
kg in weight with yellowish-orange pulp.
‘sinta’ (‘py-5’ × ‘py-3’). This was the first 
Philippine-bred papaya tolerant to PRSV, 
released in 1995. It is semi-dwarf and the 
fruits weigh about 1.5–2.0 kg (Teixeira da 
Silva et al., 2007).
Singapore
The Singapore Primary Production Depart￾ment developed ‘P10’ and ‘P15’.
‘p10’. This was developed by crossing ‘Ek￾sotika’ (‘P4’) with ‘Ng Toh Seng’ (‘P5’). The 
fruits are bigger (600–1000 g) than ‘P15’ fruit 
(400–700 g). The yield of ‘P10’ and ‘P15’ 
vary between 43–50 kg and 36–66 kg per 
plant year-1, respectively (Chan et al., 1994).
‘p15’. This was developed by crossing ‘Ek￾sotika’ (P4) and a cultivar obtained from

Guam Island Department of Agriculture. 
Both varieties have fruit that are oblong in 
shape with orange-red pulp and high TSS 
(14°Brix).
South Africa
In South Africa, two varieties namely ‘Hortus 
Gold’ and ‘Honey Gold’ have been developed 
through conventional breeding. ‘Honey Gold’ 
is a clonal selection from ‘Hortus Gold’ with 
a higher sugar content and more disease 
resistance than ‘Hortus Gold’.
‘bh65’. This is a ‘Solo’ type papaya with 
dwarf growth and excellent fruit character￾istics.
‘selection 42’. This is a high-yielding ‘Solo’ 
type with good fruit characteristics.
‘honey gold’. This is a late-maturing selec￾tion made from ‘Hortus Gold’ and has many 
similar features with ‘Hortus Gold’ but with 
improved sugar content and disease resist￾ance (Fig. 6.7).
‘hortus gold’. This is a dioecious, early 
maturing cultivar with fruits that are round 
to oval in shape. The fruit weighs about 
0.9–1.36 kg and has a high sugar content. 
The fruits have a slight beak at the apex, 
golden-yellow skin and pulp, a sweet fla￾vour and good texture.
Taiwan
The main varieties in cultivation are ‘Tainung 2’ 
(95%), ‘Sunrise’ (4%) and ‘Red Lady’ (1%). 
The other varieties released from Taiwan 
are ‘Tainung 1’, ‘Tainung 3’, ‘Tainung 5’, 
‘Tainung 6’, ‘Tainung 7’, ‘NTU No.8’, ‘Kaih￾siung No.9’ and ‘Tainung 10’.
‘tainung 1’. This was developed from a 
cross between ‘Costa Rica Red’ and ‘Sunrise 
Solo’. Its female fruits are oblong and herm￾aphrodite fruits are long and pear shaped 
(Fig. 6.8). Average fruit weight is about 900 g. 
The pulp is bright red with a unique aroma 
and the TSS reaches 13°Brix.
‘tainung 2’. This is an F1
 hybrid of ‘Thai￾land’ and ‘Sunrise Solo’. This is a red-fleshed, 
gynodioecious variety, with average fruit 
weight of 1.1 kg, and a soluble solids con￾tent of 11–12°Brix with good aroma. This is 
the most widely-grown commercial variety 
in Taiwan and accounts for up to 90% of the 
production area (Fig. 6.9A, B).

‘tainung 5’. This is the first PRSV-tolerant 
variety in Taiwan. It is the offspring of a Flor￾ida cultivar and a Costa Rica hybrid. The fruit 
has reddish-orange pulp with 10–11°Brix.
‘red lady’. This was developed by Known￾you seed Co. Ltd in 1986. It is an early 
bearer and high yielder. The fruit weight 
is 1.5–2 kg and fruits are elongate with 
bright red pulp. Plants are tolerant of PRSV 
(Fig. 6.10A–C).
‘taiwan#785’. The plant is dwarf in stature, 
producing the first fruit within 60–75 cm 
from the ground level. Fruits are oblong with 
thick, orange-red and sweet pulp. It has a 
good keeping quality and disease tolerance.
‘taiwan#786’. This is a gynodioecious var￾iety cultivated for the table as well as for 
processing purposes. The fruits are oblong 
with a tasty sweet pulp having few seeds. 
The plant starts bearing fruits from 100 cm 
above the ground level. The fruit weighs be￾tween 1.0 kg and 3.0 kg and has excellent 
keeping quality.
Thailand
The commercial papaya varieties of Thai￾land are ‘Kayek Dum’, ‘Kaknuan’, ‘Krung’ 
and ‘Holland’ (Phummalee, 2013). The popu￾lar native papaya cultivars are: ‘Kayek Dum’, 
‘Khaek Nuan’, ‘Coco’, ‘Sai Nam Phueng’, 
‘Klang Dong’, ‘Pak Chong’, ‘Hawaii’ and 
‘Holland’ or ‘Pak Mai Lai’.
‘holland’. This variety is famous commer￾cially for its fresh consumption value, at￾tributable to its lack of sap odour, fruits 
weighing about 800–1200 g, thick pulp that is 
sweet and has good shelf life (Fig. 6.11A, B).
‘khon kaen 80’. This is a hybrid between 
‘Kayek Dum’ and ‘Florida Tolerant’. It is 
suitable for use as table fruit as well as for 
export. It flowers early (74 days) at a height 
of 1.32 m. The fruit is pyriform, weighing 
770 g, with orange-red pulp and 13.1% TSS 
(Fig. 6.12).
‘kayek dum’. The fruit of this variety weighs 
about 0.6–2.0 kg and the pulp is 2.3 cm 
thick, reddish, firm and sweet (TSS 10.7–
13.5°Brix) (Fig. 6.13).
‘kaknuan’. This variety is very similar to 
‘Kayek Dum’ with respect to canopy, leaf,

Dum’ and ‘Florida Tolerant’. It flowers early 
(85 days) at a height of 1.27 m, has an aver￾age fruit weight of 1.5 kg, with yellow pulp 
and TSS content of 11.2°Brix. It is more tol￾erant to PRSV than ‘Kayek Dum’.
The USA
The Hawaiian papaya researchers contrib￾uted a lot to developing the best varieties 
in the world. Papaya was introduced to 
Hawaii in around 1820. In 1911, Gerrit P. 
Wilder collected seeds of a single small pa￾paya from Barbados (Storey, 1941). This 
was the introduction of the ‘Solo’ papaya, a 
‘Red Lady’

small-fruited, high-quality gynodioecious line, 
the descendants of which, over the subse￾quent 25 years replaced the dioecious types 
originally introduced into Hawaii in the 
1800s (Manshardt, 2012). The Hawaiian ‘Solo’ 
type is perhaps one of the few cultivars that 
have been continuously inbred since its 
introduction from Barbados. ‘Solo’ cultivars 
such as ‘Kapoho’, ‘Sunrise’, ‘Sunset’ and 
‘Waimanalo’ have been inbred for many 
generations (Nakasone and Paull, 1998).
The other important cultivars are 
‘Higgins’ (Line 17A), ‘Wilder’ (Line 25), 
‘Dwarf Solo’ (‘Solo’ × ‘Florida’s Betty’), ‘Big 
Bluestem’ (‘Purple stem’ × ‘Blue stem’).
‘waimanalo’. This cultivar is a gynodioec￾ious type. The fruit weighs about 600–900 g 
and is pear shaped to round ovoid with 
orange-yellow pulp (Fig. 6.14). It has been 
inbred for many generations (Nakasone and 
Paull, 1998).
‘solo’. This is a gynodioecious variety and 
is the most popular cultivar in the world. 
Fruits are small, weighing about 350–500 g 
which is convenient as a single serving. 
Many lines such as ‘Line 5’, ‘Line 8’, ‘Line 
10’, ‘Kapoho’ (‘Puna Solo’), ‘Waimanalo’ 
(‘Line 77’), ‘Sunset’ and ‘Sunrise’ (red pulp) 
have been developed (Fitch et al., 2002).

‘line 5’ and ‘line 8’. These are improved 
‘Solo’ strains selected in Hawaii. ‘Line 5’ 
was released in 1947–1948 while ‘Line 8’ 
was distributed to the growers in 1954. Both 
are highly inbred ‘Solos’ with desirable 
plant characteristics and fruit of high qual￾ity and uniformity. ‘Line 5’ and ‘Line 8’ are 
both yellow pulped and the average fruit 
weighs about 500 g with TSS content of 
14–15°Brix. ‘Line 8’ fruits are smoother and 
less furrowed than ‘Line 5’ fruits.
‘kopho solo’. This is a gynodioecious culti￾var. Fruits are pear shaped, weighing about 
0.45 kg with orange–yellow pulp.
‘sunrise solo’. This is a gynodioecious pink￾pulp line widely grown in many parts of the 
world. Fruits are small and pyriform in 
shape (Fig. 6.15).
‘uh rainbow’ (‘sunup’ × ‘kopho solo’). This is 
a gynodioecious hybrid developed at the 
University of Hawaii at Manoa. The fruits are 
pear shaped (with a short neck) to elliptical, 
weighing 650 g, with yellow-orange pulp 
which has TSS of 12–16°Brix and is uni￾form, juicy textured with a mild aroma. ‘UH 
Rainbow’ combines the superior quality typ￾ical of Hawaii’s ‘Solo’ papayas with excel￾lent resistance to the devastating plant virus 
disease – PRSV.
‘cariflora’. This is a new dioecious cultivar 
developed at the University of Florida, 
Homestead. It is nearly round, 0.5–0.8 kg in 
weight, with thick, dark yellow to light 
orange pulp. It is tolerant of PRSV, but sus￾ceptible to Papaya mosaic virus or Papaya 
apical necrosis virus.
Venezuela
The important cultivars are ‘Paraguanera’ and 
‘Roja’ (red pulp).
Vietnam
The most popular variety is ‘Dai Loan Tim’ 
(meaning purple Taiwan variety). The fruit 
has high-quality pulp that is red in colour. Four 
mutant dwarf selections (‘M064’, ‘M070’, 
‘M160’ and ‘M313’) were made. These se￾lections have better fruit quality than ‘Dai 
Loan Tim’ (Nhat Hang and Chau, 2010).
A list of papaya varieties grown in differ￾ent countries are summarized in Table 6.1.
6.2.2 Clonal cultivars
‘Honey Gold’ is a well-known papaya clone. 
It is a dioecious cultivar selected in South 
Africa from plants propagated by leafy cut￾tings over generations as it does not repro￾duce from seed. The clonal plants have greater 
uniformity especially in fruit shape, which 
is a sex-linked character.

6.2.3 Transgenic cultivars
The world’s first transgenic papaya was 
‘SunUp’, which is line ‘55-1’ that was 
transformed with the coat protein gene of 
PRSV HA (a Hawaiian isolate) to be re￾sistant to PRSV disease. The line ‘55-1’ 
was originally derived by transforming 
‘Sunset’, which is a sib selection from the 
popular ‘Sunrise’ (Gonsalves, 2007). ‘Rain￾bow’ was the first transgenic commercial 
cultivar developed in Hawaii from a cross 
between ‘SunUp’ and the conventional 
cultivar ‘Kapoho’. Since the cost of de￾regulating, licensing and commercializing 
a new transgenic papaya was expected to 
be high, the researchers also undertook 
conventional hybridization and backcross￾ing of the cultivar ‘Kamiya’ to create 
PRSV-resistant plants for farmers on Oahu 
where the cultivar is important. Somewhat 
complex hybrids between ‘Kamiya’ and 
two random ‘Rainbow’ F2
 plants were 
made and planted in a commercial field in 
1998. The farmers liked the first hybrid 
and continue to use this new commercial 
hybrid that was named and patented as 
‘Laie Gold’ (Fitch, 2010).
Transgenic papaya cultivars with delayed 
fruit ripening and resistance to PRSV disease 
are being developed in Malaysia, Thailand, 
Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam

under the Papaya Biotechnology Network 
of South East Asia. China developed its own 
virus-resistant GMO (genetically modified 
organism) papaya. At South China Agricul￾tural University, Guangzhou, researchers 
reported that the PRSV replicase gene con￾ferred virus resistance in transgenic papayas 
(Chen et al., 2001). The transformant was 
‘Huanong 1’ which was deregulated in 2006. 
The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, 
Regional Station, Pune, has successfully 
developed two high-yielding PRSV-tolerant 
dioecious lines with yellow (‘Pune Selec￾tion-3’) and red pulp (‘Pune Selection 1’). 
These lines performed better than other com￾mercial cultivars under high disease pressure 
(Sharma et al., 2017).
6.2.4 Varieties suitable for greenhouse 
cultivation
Galan Sauco and Rodriguez Pastor (2007) 
suggested the low-height variety ‘Solo’ for 
greenhouse cultivation. In Japan, ‘Sunrise’, 
‘Wonder Flare’, ‘Tainung 1’, ‘Tainung 2’ and 
‘Tainung 5’ are successfully grown in green￾houses. In Israel, the local selection ‘Paradise’ 
is the planting variety of choice. In the 
Mediterranean region of Turkey, ‘Sel-42’ and 
‘SS-45’ varieties were recommended for grow￾ing in unheated greenhouses (Gunes and 
Gubbuk, 2012).
6.3 Improvement
The breeding aims of papaya have not changed 
much over the last 100 years. Future breed￾ing objectives are: (i) tree vigour; (ii) low 
bearing height with short internodes and 
precocious fruiting; (iii) minimum expres￾sion of stamen carpellody and female steril￾ity; (iv) uniform fruit shape with smooth 
skin, free from blemishes, firm with thick 
pulp; (v) small and round ovarian cavity 
with easily separable placenta and absence 
of internal lumps; (vi) long shelf life; 
(vii) good yielding ability; (viii) increased latex 
yield for papain production; and (ix) resist￾ance to cold and waterlogging, diseases 
(especially resistance to PRSV) and insect 
pests. The desired fruit size, shape and pulp 
colour may differ in different regions (Naka￾sone and Paull, 1998; Chan, 2009).
The limitations of papaya breeding are 
lack of diversity, sterility, incompatibility, 
parthenocarpy, unpredictable sex expres￾sion and identification, embryo abortion, 
lack of established asexual multiplication 
protocol and maintenance of purity (Man￾shradt, 1992). High heterozygosity results in 
more generations of selfing for attaining 
homozygosity of traits.
6.4 Genetic Resources
The genetic resources of papaya are a valuable 
source of genes for important traits (includ￾ing dwarfing, gynodioecious, red pulp, high 
TSS content, keeping quality, papain content, 
and biotic and abiotic stress) used in im￾provement programmes (Ray, 2002; Dinesh, 
2010; Scheldeman et al., 2011) and can be 
used for developing new cultivars (Table 6.2). 
The Vasconcellea species can also be used 
as a source of new genes for papain and re￾sistance to PRSV (Manshardt and Drew, 1998), 
mosaic virus and leaf curl disease, and cold 
tolerance (Capoor and Varma, 1961; Horo￾vitz and Jiménez, 1967; Drew et al., 1998; 
Chan, 2009; Scheldeman et al., 2011). Gen￾etic resources used for different characters 
in papaya breeding are listed in Table 6.2.
6.5 Inheritance Pattern
6.5.1 Precocity and plant stature
Precocity or earliness to fruiting is a factor 
of the number of nodes produced before the 
first flowering node, while the number of 
nodes to flowering and the internode length 
determine height to first fruit (Nakasone and 
Storey, 1955; Lim and Siti Hawa, 2005). 
These characters are governed by additive

gene effects with the hybrid having the 
geometric mean between the two parents 
(Nakasone and Storey, 1955). Subhadraband￾hu and Nontaswatsri (1997) reported that the 
height of the first flower and number of nodes 
to fruiting are controlled by both additive 
and non-additive genes.
6.5.2 Sex type
Papaya is a trioecious species with a pair of 
nascent sex chromosomes controlling sex type: 
females are XX, males XY and hermaphro￾dites XYh (Ming et al., 2001, 2007). The sex￾determining region contains not only the 
genes controlling sex type (male and female 
sterile genes) but also genes controlling sex￾linked traits such as peduncle length and in￾florescence branch number (Han et al., 2014).
The occurrence of seasonal floral sex 
reversal is common in the papaya crop, where 
male plants may have hermaphrodite flowers 
and vice versa, whereas female flowers are 
considered stable (Storey, 1953). These floral 
reversals, known as ‘summer sterility’ (XYh? 
XY) or ‘male papaya’ (translated from 
the Portuguese mamao macho) (XY? XYh) 
(Damasceno Junior et al., 2008), are attrib￾uted to genetic and environmental factors 
(Hofmeyr, 1938; Silva et al., 2007; Dama￾sceno Junior et al., 2008), besides epigenetic 
alterations (Negrutiu et al., 2001; Vyskot 
and Hobzar, 2004; Aryal and Ming, 2014; 
Liao et al., 2017). Nevertheless, these reversals 
are seasonal and do not change the genetic 
constitution of the plant. Though at a low 
frequency, natural sex reversal in a male 
plant to hermaphrodite is a spontaneous 
phenomenon (Liao et al., 2017), as was seen 
in the dioecious genotype Cariflora (Ramos 
et al., 2011), for which only genetic material 
of the male and female sexes were known 
then. The occurrence of natural sex reversal 
provides breeders immediately with mater￾ial that would take several generations to be

obtained via introgression of the allele re￾sponsible for hermaphroditism, in breeding 
programmes (Silva et al., 2007; Ramos et al., 
2014). These two loci are amplified only in 
male plants and hermaphrodites originating 
from sex reversal (XY to XYh), with no amp￾lification occurring in female or hermaphro￾dite plants. These loci were validated in 11 
gynodioecious varieties and four dioecious 
varieties, making an efficient distinction be￾tween gynodioecious and dioecious culti￾vars in addition to a clear identification of 
male-to-hermaphrodite sex-reversed plants.
6.5.3 Fruit weight and shape
Fruit weight is a quantitative character deter￾mined by multiple alleles (Chan, 2001). The 
shape of fruit is a sex-linked character. The 
female flower has a globose ovary that de￾velops into round or ovoid fruit. The elong￾ate or hermaphrodite flower has a slender, 
tapering ovary and this subsequently devel￾ops into a fruit that is elongated and cylin￾drical or pyriform in shape depending on 
the variety of papaya.
6.5.4 Fruit skin colour
Fruit skin colour is governed by a single gene 
with green (G) being dominant and yellow 
expressed in a double recessive (gg).
6.5.5 Fruit yield
The yield is significantly correlated with 
number of fruit, fruit weight, fruiting length 
and leaf length. Higher estimates of herit￾ability and genetic advance are observed for 
fruit weight, fruiting length and fruit yield.
6.5.6 Carpellody and female sterility
Carpelloid fruit development is significantly 
influenced by plant age, genotype and their 
interaction. Carpellody and female sterility do 
occur in dioecious and gynodioecious culti￾vars whereas carpellody phenomena takes 
place in cultivars having hermaphroditic sex 
type. Carpellody and female sterility may in￾volve a number of gene pairs involving three 
loci, two for carpellody (c/c, c/c) and one for 
sterility (s/s). Their normal alleles (+) are 
partially or completely dominant. The s/+ 
combination is normal. In c/+, the + is par￾tially dominant over ‘c’, so there will be 
some carpellody. The ‘s’ factor, whether 
homozygous or not (s/-), is epistatic over the 
‘c’ allele when the carpellody factors are het￾erozygous. The phenotype would be normal 
but unstable, depending upon environmen￾tal conditions. If either of the ‘c’ factors is 
homozygous (c/c), the combined strength of 
the two alleles at one locus can overcome 
epistasis, thus exhibiting carpellody. High 
heritability (h2 = 82%) is obtained for car￾pellody, but effective phenotypic selection may 
be interfered with by the ‘change-in-rate’ type 
of interaction between genotype and plant age 
(Chan, 1984). A strong correlation was found 
between incidence of fruit carpellody and 
internode length (r = 0.68–0.86).
6.5.7 Flavour and TSS
Muskiness has been reported to be caused 
by a homozygous recessive allele of a single 
gene (Storey, 1969). TSS content is usually 
associated with sweetness and may range 
from 8.0°Brix to 16°Brix or more in the 
‘Solo’ and ‘Eksotika’ varieties. This trait is 
governed by quantitative genes with addi￾tive effects and hybrids are expected to have 
intermediate values between the parents 
(Subhadrabandhu and Nontaswatsri, 1997).
6.5.8 Pulp colour
Pulp colour is governed by a single gene with 
yellow (R) being dominant over red (r). Vary￾ing intermediate shades of pink may be attrib￾uted to modifier gene effects. All red-pulp (rr) 
varieties like ‘Sunrise Solo’ and ‘Eksotika’ 
will breed true for pulp colour but progenies 
of heterozygous (Rr) yellow F1
 hybrids like 
‘Rainbow’ will segregate in this trait.

6.5.9 Fruit freckle
Freckle is a disorder where superficial wa￾ter-soaked spots of variable size appear on the 
exposed surface of mature fruit. It is genetic￾ally controlled (Chan and Toh, 1988).
6.5.10 PRSV
Heritability of tolerance to PRSV in a popula￾tion showed h = 61% on the disease index. 
Yield and TSS are positively correlated to the 
degree of tolerance (Chang and Guo, 2002). 
The resistance to PRSV-type P (PRSV-P) was 
controlled by a single dominant gene (prsv-1) 
in Vasconcellea pubescens (O’Brien and 
Drew, 2009) but still it is not clear whether 
it is single dominant gene or multiple genes. 
Hence, further investigation is required (C. 
Vasugu, Bengaluru, India, 2019, personal 
communication).
6.6 Conventional Breeding
6.6.1 Introduction
Introduction of new crop varieties is one of the 
important methods for crop improvement. 
The National Germplasm Repository at Hilo, 
Hawaii, currently holds 37 accessions of pa￾paya and 13 species of Vasconcellea (Chan, 
2009). The Malaysian Agricultural Research 
and Development Institute (MARDI), Kuala 
Lumpur also has 52 accessions of papaya 
collected from different parts of the world. 
This genetic resource can be used for hybrid￾ization and improvement of papaya. There is 
a need to introduce dwarf accessions ‘Baix￾inho Sta Amalina’ and ‘Puerto Rico 217’ 
(Chan, 2009) to use in breeding programmes 
to develop dwarf hybrids of papaya. There 
is an urgent need to introduce the species of 
Vasconcellea such as Vasconcellea goudoti￾ana, Vasconcellea cauliflora, Vasconcellea 
sphaerocarpa, Vasconcellea quercifolia, 
Vasconcellea monoica, V. pubescens and 
Vasconcellea stipulata as these have resist￾ance to various diseases and pests and toler￾ance of frost, etc.
The main methods of breeding papaya 
are: (i) the Hawaii method used for improving 
gynodioecious cultivars; and (ii) the Yarwan 
method which is followed in Australia for 
improving dioecious cultivars (Aquilizan, 
1987; Manshardt, 1992). Each breeding method 
requires seven or eight generations (about 
15 years) to produce a new strain or cultivar 
(Ray, 2002).
6.6.2 Inbreeding and selection
Hamilton (1954) studied the inbreeding and 
cross-breeding of two ‘Solo’ strains and 
showed that inbreeding has no effects on 
plant vigour. In the case of dioecious lines, 
the desirable female was crossed with at least 
three hermaphrodite plants as the male par￾ent. Sib mating in female and selfing in 
hermaphrodites may go simultaneously to 
speed up the breeding programme. This pro￾cess should be continued for seven to eight 
generations for satisfactory homozygosity to 
be achieved (Ram, 1996).
The cultivars ‘CO.1’, ‘CO.2’, ‘CO.5’ and 
‘CO.6’ were developed through inbreeding 
following selection at TNAU, India. The 
hybrid papaya ‘CO.8’ was developed in 
the dioecious group through sib mating of 
the ‘CO.2’ variety, and this variety is unique 
for the red pulp colour (Ray, 2002). Similar 
work was started at IARI Regional Station, 
Pusa (India). As a result of inbreeding and 
selection for eight generations, uniform 
lines of ‘Pusa Delicious’, ‘Pusa Majesty’, ‘Pusa 
Giant’ and ‘Pusa Dwarf’ with desirable attributes 
were developed (Ram, 1996). The gynodioe￾cious varieties, viz. ‘Kapoho’, ‘Sunrise Solo’, 
‘Waimanalo’, ‘Kamiya’ and ‘Eksotika’ were 
established by inbreeding by means of the 
pedigree or backcross breeding method 
(Manshardt, 1992; Chan, 2009).
6.6.3 Mass selection
Mass selection can be used for cleaning and 
stabilizing local varieties selected by farmers. 
In Malaysia, a simple mass selection method 
was used for improving local varieties, for 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

example ‘Subang-6’ selected for fresh fruit 
and ‘Sitiawan’ for processing (Chan and 
Ooi, 1975).
6.6.4 Recurrent selection
The selection of superior genotypes based 
on the simultaneous response to several char￾acteristics of agronomic importance is a key 
strategy to overcome the scarcity of available 
varieties of papaya (Ramos et al., 2014). Re￾current selection has been used for develop￾ment of superior genotypes with desirable 
characters in papaya. The basic technique 
in recurrent selection is the identification of 
individuals with superior genotypes, and 
their subsequent intermating to produce a 
new population (Ray, 2002). The principal 
characters of papaya that have been studied 
as targets for selection under domestication 
are: (i) tree size; (ii) fruit size; (iii) sex types; 
(iv) morphology; and (v) germinability of 
seeds (Chavez-Pesqueira and Nunez-Farfan, 
2017). Tree size has been considered to se￾lect smaller trees to facilitate harvesting 
(Niklas and Marler, 2007). Some type of 
progeny test, depending on the selection 
system, may be necessary to measure the 
genotype value of the parents. Parental 
genotypes are retained often by controlled 
selfing, so that following selection and pro￾geny evaluation, the best one can be grown 
and intercrossed. After intercrossing of the 
superior plants, selection can again be prac￾tised in the new population (Ray, 2002).
The  most  important  commercial  pa￾paya cultivars in the world are inbred pure 
lines such as ‘Kapoho’, ‘Sunrise Solo’ and 
‘Eksotika’ that are propagated from gener￾ation to generation from seed obtained by 
setting hermaphrodite flowers of gynodioe￾cious varieties. No inbreeding depression was 
recorded during selfing of gynodioecious 
populations (Hamilton,  1954) or dioecious 
populations (Aquilizan, 1983). Dwivedi (1998) 
reported indirect selection of plants on the 
basis of a higher number and weight of seeds 
per fruit. Higher number of fruits and 
low-to-moderate fruit length is more effect￾ive in increasing fruit yield than direct 
selection. The selection of fruits for higher 
peel weight, fruit weight and diameter is 
expected to improve pulp weight in papaya 
(Dwivedi and Jha, 1999). Oliveira et al. 
(2012) reported the mixed model method￾ology for selection in F2
 populations from 
‘Tainung’ and ‘Calimosa’ hybrids. Estimates 
of individual heritability were high for fruit 
length and weight, moderate for fruit diam￾eter, and low for TSS and fruit firmness. The 
segregating populations from the hybrid 
‘Calimosa’ are more promising for the selec￾tion of papaya lines.
Ramos et al. (2014) stated that a safe 
way to identify genetic material with char￾acters of interest is the evaluation based on 
genotypic values, which has an additive na￾ture and greater accuracy. These estimates 
can be obtained using mixed linear models 
of the restricted maximum likelihood/best 
linear unbiased prediction (REML/BLUP) 
(Moreira et al., 2018a, b). The genotypic val￾ues predicted by the mixed models were 
found to be more efficient than the pheno￾typic values in the selection of individuals 
of interest in the ‘Solo’ group of papaya 
(Pinto et al., 2013; Ramos et al., 2014). The 
REML/BLUP methodology was also reported 
efficient in identifying the papaya geno￾types of the ‘Formosa’ group to be selected 
in order to obtain greater mass and number 
of fruits, pulp thickness and soluble solids 
content. Due to the greater additive herit￾ability within the progenies and the indi￾vidual variation of coefficient, the selection 
practised between and within the half-sib 
families could provide greater genetic gains 
when compared with the selection based on 
the average of the progenies (Moreira et al., 
2018a, b).
6.6.5 Hybridization
Hybridization is an important method to de￾velop varieties by incorporating specific 
genes from selected varieties. There have 
been reports of improved yields in cross 
combinations between different cultivars of 
papaya, although commercial hybrids of 
papaya are rare. Agnew (1968) reported a

vigorous hybrid derived from ‘Bettina 100A’ 
and ‘Peterson 170’. Breeding for gynodioecious 
lines involves selfing of a prolific-bearing 
hermaphrodite or sib mating the female with 
the hermaphrodite.
Hybridization was initiated in India 
and through intervarietal crosses at TNAU. 
Three varieties have been developed: (i) ‘CO.3’ 
(‘CO.2’ × ‘Sunrise Solo’); (ii) ‘CO.4’ (‘CO.1’ × 
‘Washington’); and (iii) ‘CO.7’, developed by 
multiple crosses involving ‘Pusa Delicious’, 
‘CO.3’, ‘Coorg Honey Dew’ and ‘CP.85’. 
At IIHR, Bengaluru, two varieties named 
‘Arka Surya’ (‘Sunrise Solo’ × ‘Pink Fleshed 
Sweet’) and ‘Arka Prabhath’ ((‘Arka Surya’ × 
Tainung 1) × Local dwarf) were developed 
(Dinesh and Yadav, 1998). Hybrid ‘HPSC-3’ 
(‘Tripura local’ × ‘Honey Dew’) was devel￾oped at the Indian Council of Agricultural 
Research (ICAR) Research Complex, Trip￾ura (Singh and Sharma, 1996). Cultivar 
‘Cariflora’ was developed at the Tropical 
Research and Education Center of the Uni￾versity of Florida at Homestead by crossing 
the ‘K2xK3’ line of papaya which is tolerant 
of PRSV (Conover et al., 1986).
Before the establishment of MARDI in 
1969, there was no official papaya breeding 
programme in Malaysia. MARDI picked 
‘Subang 6’ to promote as fresh fruit and ‘Si￾tiwan’ for canning. Y.K. Chan at MARDI ini￾tiated papaya breeding in 1972. He crossed 
‘Subang 6’ with ‘Sunrise Solo’. The progeny 
was backcrossed to ‘Sunrise Solo’ and one 
of the results was the ‘MARDI backcross 
Solo’ that was later released under the name 
of ‘Eksotika’. ‘Eksotika’ was found suscep￾tible to fruit freckles caused by the com￾bined action of the fungus Cladosporium
and thrips. However, one of the backcross 
lines related to ‘Eksotika’ known as ‘Line 
19’ was resistant. ‘Eksotika’ Line 19 was 
crossed with Line 20 and out of this cross 
came ‘Eksotika II’. This was the first com￾mercial F1
 papaya hybrid, in the world 
(Chan, 2015). The hybrid released in 1991, 
has similar features to ‘Eksotika’, but the 
yield is 14–33% higher due to the larger 
fruit weighing between 600 g and 800 g. The 
appearance of the fruit is more attractive, 
with smooth skin and high tolerance to 
freckles. The flesh is firmer and the fruit 
stores longer, making ‘Eksotika II’ more pre￾ferred than its predecessor for export 
(Chan, 1993).
The hybrids derived from crossing two 
lines of ‘Eksotika’ and ‘Sekaki’ showed a 
dramatic increase in yield. One of the hybrids 
(i.e. ‘L19 × Sekaki’) cannot be recommended 
as a commercial cultivar because of a problem 
of severe carpellody. ‘L20 × Sekaki’, on the 
other hand, has acceptable levels of carpel￾lody and improved yield and sugar content 
which make it a potential candidate to replace 
the current ‘Sekaki’ cultivar (Chan, 2001).
The skin colour trait has been transferred 
to ‘Sunrise Solo’ after hybridization with 
‘Morib’, followed by selection for promising 
yellow-skinned progenies in the subsequent 
inbred generation. The F1
 progeny for the 
cross between ‘Sunrise Solo’ and ‘Morib’ 
was an all-green fruit population while the 
F2
 generated a typical 3:1 segregation of 
green: yellow population (Chan, 2009).
An important hybrid developed in Tai￾wan that has resistance to  PRSV disease 
is  ‘Tainung 5’  which was  developed  from 
a  cross  between  ‘Florida’  (‘FL-77-5’) and 
the ‘Costa Rica Red’ (TFNet, 2016).
6.6.6 Intergeneric hybridization
PRSV-P is the greatest problem of papaya 
production worldwide. Almost all cultivated 
papaya varieties are highly susceptible to 
PRSV-P (Jayavalli et al., 2011; Pujar et al., 
2019). Resistance to PRSV-P exists in wild 
Vasconcellea species (e.g. V. cauliflora, V. 
pubescens, V. quercifolia and V. stipulata) 
but not in Carica papaya. The genus Vas￾concellea (family Caricaceae) was con￾sidered for a long time a section within the 
genus Carica L. (Badillo, 2001). However, 
Badillo (2000, 2001) separated the mono￾specific section Carica from the section 
Vasconcellea, based on morphological and 
genetic evidence rehabilitating the Vascon￾cellea section on a generic level; since then the 
genus is formed by 25 species, and the Carica
genus by only one species, the cultivated 
form, C. papaya. Based on chromosome 
features, Vasconcellea cundinamarcensis, 
V. cauliflora and V. monoica are closer to 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

papaya than V. goudotiana (Pereira et al., 
2014). Much effort is being spent to intro￾duce resistance genes from wild species even 
though the resistance appears to be variable 
and depends on the geographical origin of the 
virus and the environmental conditions (Gon￾salves et al., 2004). Vasconcellea species 
also have other useful traits such as cold tol￾erance (V. pubscens), higher sugar content 
in fruit (V. quercifolia) and Phytophthora re￾sistance (V. goudotiana) (Drew et al., 1998). 
Consequently, if foreign traits are to be in￾trogressed they must come from a tertiary 
gene pool, organisms with which hybrid￾ization can be accomplished only with 
great difficulty and non-traditional methods 
(Hoover and Manshardt, 2019). In papaya, 
the tertiary gene pool consists of other gen￾era within the family Caricaceae. Papaya is 
a Central American species, and molecular 
data show that its sister clade consists of 
the monotopic genus Horovitzia, endemic 
to southern Mexico, and Jarilla, endemic to 
Mexico and Guatemala (Carvalho and Ren￾ner, 2012). However, the Central American 
genera have different chromosome num￾bers, with Jarilla (n = 7), Horovitizia (n = 8) 
and Carica (n = 9) (Rockinger et al., 2016) 
indicating that papaya may have better 
chromosome homology with South Ameri￾can Vasconcellea or Jacaratia (both n = 9). 
Of these two genera, Vasconcellea seems to 
be the better source of genetic traits for pa￾paya improvement, due to greater similarity 
in morphology, growth and development 
(Hoover and Manshardt, 2019). Intergeneric 
hybrids between C. papaya and V. cauliflora
have been tried for a long time (Horovitz 
and Jimenez, 1967; Khuspe et al., 1980; 
Manshardt and Wenslaff, 1989; Chen et al., 
1991; Magdalita et al., 1997a, b). Hybrids 
between these two species lack vigour, 
rarely survive until flowering and if they 
do, are infertile (Horovitz and Jimenez, 
1967; Litz and Conover, 1983; Manshardt 
and Wenslaff, 1989; Drew et al., 1998). Mo￾lecular analysis has shown that V. cauliflora
is the most distantly related Vasconcellea
species from C. papaya (Jobin-Décor et al., 
1997), hence intergeneric hybrids between 
these two species have been met with 
limited success due to the infertility of the 
hybrid progeny. Numerous hybrids have 
been produced at Griffith University in 
Australia between Carica and Vasconcellea, 
including hybrids with V. goudotiana, Vas￾concellea parviflora and V. quercifolia
(Drew et al., 1998). Papaya has been hybrid￾ized with PRSV-P resistant V. quercifolia
and the virus resistance backcrossed into 
papaya. Backcross 4 and 5 generations have 
been shown to exhibit resistance to both the 
Philippine and the Australian strains of 
PRSV-P (Siar et al., 2011; Drew, 2014). A more 
durable resistance to PRSV-P has been dem￾onstrated by V. pubescens which appears to 
be immune to PRSV-P. As F1
 populations 
between papaya and V. pubescens are infer￾tile, V. parviflora is being used as a bridging 
species to transfer PRSV-P resistance from 
V. pubescens to papaya (O’Brien and Drew, 
2009). Subramanyam and Iyer (1981) and 
Iyer and Subramanyam (1984) stated that an 
F1
 hybrid of V. cauliflora × V. monoica when 
crossed with C. papaya resulted in fertile 
hybrids. Although V. cauliflora and V. mo￾noica are incompatible with C. papaya, 
hybrids of V. cauliflora × V. monoica are 
compatible.
Iyer et al. (1987) later reported that hy￾bridization between C. papaya and V. cauli￾flora easily produced F1
 plants. After back￾crossing with C. papaya, they evolved a 
line, 21–19 showing resistance to mosaic 
virus with normal fruit quality. Magdalita 
et al. (1998) have also described an efficient 
protocol for intergeneric hybridization 
between C. papaya × V. cauliflora that 
involved: (i) the use of highly viable pollen 
of V. cauliflora produced during summer, 
autumn and spring; (ii) the use of an isola￾tion time ranging from 90 days to 120 days 
post-pollination of hybrid embryos; and 
(iii) the use of the most compatible papaya 
varieties for crossing with V. cauliflora.
Muthulakshmi et al. (2007) attempted 
incorporating cold tolerance from V. cundi￾namarcensis to cultivated variety ‘CO.2’. 
The hermaphrodite progeny showed lesser 
plant height, petiole length, leaf area, num￾ber of leaves per tree, fruit length, fruit 
weight and yield. In the F2
 progeny, wide 
variations were observed in morphological 
characters of plants. Recently Pujar et al.

(2019) carried out intergeneric hybridiza￾tion to know the cross compatibility between 
papaya varieties (‘Arka Prabhath’, ‘Arka Surya’ 
and ‘Red Lady’) with Vasconcellea species 
(V. cauliflora, V. cundinamarcensis and V. 
parviflora). ‘Arka Prabhath’ was found to be 
a good combiner with all three Vasconcel￾lea species tested. Among the male parents, 
V. cauliflora was found as a good combiner 
with all three female parents (‘Arka Prab￾hath’, ‘Arka Surya’ and ‘Red Lady’). The 
cross combination ‘Arka Prabhath’ × V. cau￾liflora resulted in a higher mean number of 
fertile seeds (heterotic combinations) which 
helps in generating a greater number of inter￾generic populations for screening of PRSV.
6.6.7 Interspecific hybridization
Interspecific hybridization was found to be 
successful among Vasconcellea species. A 
systematic hybridization programme us￾ing Vasconcellea germplasm was reported 
in Venezuela by Horovitz and Jiménez 
(1967). They reported that V. cauliflora, V. 
pubescens, V. stipulata and Vasconcellea 
candicans are resistant to distortion ring￾spot virus. Zerpa (1959) made several inter￾specific crosses, viz. V. cauliflora × Vascon￾cellea microcarpa, V. monoica × V. cauliflora, 
V. monoica × V. cundinamarcensis, F1
 (V. 
monoica × V. cauliflora) × V. cundinamar￾censis and V. cauliflora × V. cundinamar￾censis. Cytological investigations of these 
crosses showed that only the cross of V. cau￾liflora × V. cundinamarcensis produces 
multivalents at metaphase I, while others 
produce bivalents indicating high interspe￾cific genetic affinity. Mekako and Nakasone 
(1975), while making interspecific hybrids 
using six Vasconcellea species, obtained viable 
seeds from the combinations V. monoica × 
V. goudotiana, V. parviflora × V. goudotiana, 
V. goudotiana × V. monoica and V. cauliflo￾ra × Vasconcellea peltata. Interspecific F1
hybrids between V. pubescens and V. parv￾iflora produced vigorous F1
 hybrids which 
varied in sex expression and comprised fe￾males, males and hermaphrodites. All F1
 and 
F2
 plants were resistant to PRSV-P (Magdal￾ita et al., 1997b; Drew et al., 1998).
6.6.8 Biotic resistance breeding
Among biotic stresses, PRSV is a major 
limiting factor in improving papaya produc￾tion. The development of papaya hybrids that 
are phenotypically desirable and resistant 
to PRSV-P is one of the important compo￾nents of an integrated disease management 
strategy against the virus. While moderately 
tolerant varieties such as ‘Sinta’ provided 
some protection against the disease, new 
virus strains could evolve and overcome the 
resistance, hence new resistant varieties are 
necessary (Magdalita and Signabon, 2017). 
The wild species V. microcarpa, V. cundi￾namarcensis, V. monoica and V. cauliflora
were found to be resistant. However, hybrid￾ization with papaya was not successful due 
to embryo abortion at 70–90 days and through 
in vitro culture, hybrid plants were raised. 
The most effective and economical way to 
control PRSV is to incorporate resistance 
genes into papaya cultivars.
Research on developing PRSV-resistant 
papaya was initiated in 1987 at the Horticul￾tural Research Institute, Khan Kaen Agricul￾tural Research Station of the Department of 
Agriculture (DOA), Thailand. A tolerant var￾iety was bred by crossing ‘Florida Tolerant’ 
with ‘Khakdam’. Three lines of PRSV-re￾sistant hybrids – ‘Thapra 1’, ‘Thapra 2’ and 
‘Thapra 3’ – were developed. Until 2004, 
‘Thapra 2’ (renamed ‘Khahdam Thapra’) was 
the primary variety recommended by DOA, 
Thailand (Napasintuwong and Traxler, 2009).
A partial diallel crossing scheme was 
used to generate F1
 hybrids between diverse 
inbred lines by Magdalita and Signabon 
(2017). Out of the eight F1
 hybrids evalu￾ated, F1
 hybrids 4 and 7 were selected based 
on evaluation of horticultural traits and 
tolerance to PRSV-P.
6.7 Overcoming Barriers 
to Hybridization
Conventional intergeneric hybridization of 
C. papaya with Vasconcellea species has 
been difficult owing to intergeneric repro￾ductive barriers (Manshardt and Wenslaff, 
1989). The interspecific incompatibility is 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsVarieties and Crop Improvement 89
less common within Vasconcellea and cases 
of spontaneous hybridization have been 
reported (Badillo, 1993). Meiosis is often 
regular in hybrids (Zerpa, 1959).
Poor success can be attributed to sexual 
incompatibility followed by post-zygotic 
incongruities including embryo abortion, 
poor seed viability and sterility in progeny 
obtained following hybridization between 
two genera (Horovitz and Jiménez, 1967; 
Manshardt and Wenslaff, 1989). It was 
possible to overcome the incompatibility by 
using techniques such as embryo rescue, 
use of nutrient solution and use of bridge 
species (e.g. V. parviflora) (Manshardt and 
Drew, 1998; O’ Brien and Drew, 2009; Jayav￾alli et al., 2011).
6.7.1 Embryo rescue technique
Embryo rescue is the best technique to over￾come incompatibility barriers. Papaya em￾bryo culture has been applied to produce 
intergeneric hybrids through in vitro em￾bryo rescue (Chen et al. 1991). The embryo 
rescue protocol was developed for 90-day-old 
C. papaya embryos (Magdalita et al., 1996). 
A highly efficient protocol was used for res￾cue and germination of C. papaya × V. cau￾liflora immature embryos. The C. papaya × V. 
cauliflora hybrids lacked vigour and were 
generally infertile. Subsequently, the proto￾col was adopted to produce hybrids be￾tween C. papaya and other PRSV-P resistant 
species, V. quercifolia and V. pubescens. 
Hybrid plants grew vigorously in the field 
and a few C. papaya × V. quercifolia plants 
produced some viable pollen. Interspecific 
hybrid plants between C. papaya, V. goudo￾tiana and V. parviflora were also produced. 
Plants of all these crosses could be grown in 
the glasshouse or in the field. The success of 
intergeneric crosses depends on the genotype 
of the papaya parent used as well as the time 
of year in which pollen was collected and 
the post-pollination time at which hybrid 
embryos were rescued (Magdalita et al., 1998). 
Azad et al. (2012) achieved plant regener￾ation and somatic embryogenesis through 
intergeneric hybridization between the 
Indian papaya varieties ‘Shahi’ and ‘Ranchi’ 
with V. goudotiana and V. cauliflora, re￾spectively. The immature 90-day-old hybrid 
embryo of C. papaya variety ‘Shahi’ × V. 
cauliflora showed the highest percentage of 
germination as well as plant regeneration.
6.7.2 Use of bridge species
The compatibility between Carica and V. 
parviflora can be exploited to bridge hy￾bridization between C. papaya and PRSV-P 
resistant species (Drew et al., 1998). The 
PRSV-P resistance gene from V. pubescens
was successfully backcrossed into V. parvi￾flora from F2
 hybrids, and in the F1
 hybrids 
between C. papaya and V. parviflora, 45% 
pollen fertility was obtained, thereby indi￾cating V. parviflora as a potential bridging 
species between C. papaya and V. pubescens
(O’ Brien and Drew, 2009).
6.7.3 Use of nutrient solution
The intergeneric barrier could be broken by 
applying 10% sucrose on to the surface of the 
stigma before dusting with pollen to overcome 
the pollination barrier between C. papaya
variety ‘Pusa Nanha’ and V. cauliflora at the 
time of crossing (Jayavalli et al., 2011).
6.7.4 Shortening the breeding cycle
A short juvenile period is important for 
breeders as hybrid seedlings can be evalu￾ated for flowering and fruiting traits. The 
breeding cycle of papaya can be shortened 
using embryo culture and treatment with 
100 μl ethrel on 55-day-old fruit for 10 or 
20 days. Embryo development was enhanced 
by ethrel treatment of 55-day-old fruit. The 
seedlings of ethrel-treated fruit grew more 
vigorously than those in the control. The period 
from pollination to seedling establishment 
which is generally 6–9 months could be 
shortened by approximately 3 months using 
these techniques (Tamaki et al., 2011).

6.8 Backcross Breeding
Backcross breeding has been frequently used 
in papaya improvement programmes. The 
dioecious papaya varieties such as ‘Pusa 
Dwarf’ and ‘Hortus Gold’ rapidly degener￾ate due to outcrossing (Saran et al., 2016). 
Backcrossing is often used for the recovery of 
desirable traits in such cultivars. Ram (1993) 
suggested use of backcrossing in the improve￾ment of inbred lines for use in developing 
papaya hybrids.
This method of breeding was also used 
successfully for increasing adaptability and 
fruit size. The variety ‘Eksotika’ was devel￾oped by backcrossing ‘Sunrise Solo’ and 
‘Subang 6’ (large fruit) as the non-recurrent 
parent (Chan, 1987). Backcross breeding 
was also used in development of ‘Poamoho 
Gold’ that was a backcross F1
 hybrid between 
‘Kapoho’ and ‘Rainbow’ F2
 (Fitch et al., 
2002). Backcrossing was also carried out for 
transferring PRSV resistance from the donor 
parent V. quercifolia to the cultivated var￾ieties (Drew et al., 2005).
6.9 Heterosis
Heterosis (i.e. improvement of the F1
 pro￾genies over the best parent involved in a 
cross) has been observed in papaya. The 
heterosis capitalized among hybrids from 
different groups is expected to high, com￾pared with hybrids obtained from the same 
group (Cardoso et al., 2014). Chang and Wu 
(1974) and Subramanyam and Iyer (1984) 
demonstrated marked heterosis in crosses 
between varieties. Ram (1982) reported het￾erosis up to 11.4% for yield in the cross ‘Solo 
Yellow’ × ‘Washington’. In crosses between 
‘Pusa Delicious’ × ‘Halflong’ and ‘Pusa Deli￾cious’ × ‘Homestead’, high heterotic responses 
(47.34% and 39.77%, respectively) were 
observed with respect to fruit yield over 
mid-parent. High heterosis (31.29%) was re￾corded in the progeny obtained from ‘Pusa 
Delicious’ × ‘Homestead’ with respect to 
fruit yield. Chan (1992) reported heterosis in 
yield and fruit quality of F1
 hybrids devel￾oped from closely related sib crosses. One 
such cross between Line 19 and Line 20 
resulted in the development of ‘Eksotika II’. 
The first transgenic papaya from Hawaii 
‘Rainbow’ with resistance to PRSV is an F1
hybrid between the conventional ‘Kapoho’ 
and transformed ‘SunUp’ (Gonsalves, 1998). 
Chan (2001) evaluated two hybrids derived 
from crossing two ‘Eksotika’ lines (L 19 and 
L 20) with ‘Sekaki’. Heterosis (over the better 
parent) in yield was evident, ranging from 
47.5% for ‘L 20’ × ‘Sekaki’ to 72.5% for ‘L 
19’ × ‘Sekaki’. Heterosis in yield increase 
was mainly from gain in fruit weight of hy￾brids rather than increase in the number of 
fruits. Heterotic effects for earliness and 
plant height, as well as fruit yield, weight 
and number of fruits in different hybrid 
combinations was reported by Vasconcelos 
et al. (1982).
The F1
 hybrid ‘Kapoho’ × ‘Tainung’ was 
found to be better in terms of fruit weight 
(0.98 kg) and TSS (12.94°Brix) than the better 
parent ‘Tainung’. The fruit weight (0.92 kg) 
and TSS (12.80°Brix) of the F1
 hybrid between 
‘Solo’ × ‘Cavite’ was found to be better than 
both the parents. The hybrid of ‘Cavite’ × 
‘4172’ showed a fruit weight of 1.08 kg and 
edible portion of 72.35%, almost intermedi￾ate of the parents, but the TSS (12.60%) was 
better than both parents (Magdalita et al., 
2007). Kamalkumar et al. (2010) developed 
five hybrids by crossing five gynodioecious 
and five dioecious parents. The hybrids 
‘CO.2’ × ‘Pusa Giant’, ‘9-1(D)’ × ‘CO.5’, and 
‘Pusa Dwarf’ × ‘9-1(D)’ registered high posi￾tive significant heterosis for the number of 
fruits. The cross, ‘CO.7’ × ‘Exotica’ was highly 
heterotic for fruit number. The dioecious 
cross ‘CO.2’ × ‘CO.5’ showed high positive 
relative heterosis for fruit weight (Mitra and 
Dinesh, 2019). Except for ‘IIHR 37’ × ‘Coorg 
Honey Dew’, all four of the other gynodioe￾cious hybrids showed high positive signifi￾cant heterosis and heterobeltiosis for fruit 
weight. Cardoso et al. (2014) developed 56 
hybrid progenies (F1
 and reciprocal) from 
crosses among four lines of the ‘Formosa’ 
heterotic group (‘Maradol’ (MR), ‘JS 12’ (JS), 
‘JS12/4’ (J4) and ‘Sekati’ (SK)) and four of 
the ‘Solo’ group (‘Wimanalo’ (WM), ‘Golden’ 
(GG), ‘SS 72/12’ (SS) and ‘Sao Mateus’ (SM)). 
Among the ‘Formosa’ intragroup hybrids, 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

two hybrid combinations (MR × J4 and MR 
× SK) showed heterosis for all traits, as well 
as good average total fruit production. 
Among the ‘Solo’ intragroup hybrids, three 
hybrid combinations (WM × GG, WM × SS 
and WM × SM) showed higher production and 
high content of soluble solids. In ‘Formosa’ 
× ‘Solo’ hybrids, all hybrid combinations 
with the parent JS showed high fruit quality 
and a good average for fruit production.
Higher papain recovery was reported in 
F1
 hybrids of ‘CO.2’ × ‘Pusa Nanha’ and 
‘CO.5’ × ‘Pusa Nanha’. At first harvest, hy￾brids ‘CO.4’ × ‘Pusa Nanha’, ‘CO.4’ × ‘Pusa 
Nanha’, ‘CO.6’ × ‘Pusa Nanha’ and ‘CO.5’ × 
‘Pusa Nanha’ showed higher fruit yield over 
mid- and better parental values (Davamani 
et al., 2013). Heterosis was also observed 
and pointed out by Mekako and Nakasone 
(1975) in crossing of V. cauliflora × V. gou￾dotiana and V. cauliflora × V. monoica. In 
both crosses, the plant height, stem diam￾eter, fruit number and mean fruit weight in 
the F1
 generation were significantly higher 
than in the most vigorous parents.
Studies show that heterosis is possible 
and feasible in papaya to exploit the vigour. 
Dai (1960) reported heterosis in the cross 
between ‘Philippine’ and ‘Solo’ varieties. 
Heterosis existed in the progeny obtained 
from ‘Pusa Delicious’ × ‘Homestead’ with 
respect to fruit yield over the better parent 
(Ram, 1982).
The F1
 exhibited reduced number of 
seeds and enhanced vigour. Chang and Wu 
(1974) and Subramanyam and Iyer (1984) 
also reported heterosis in crossing between 
varieties.
Mekako and Nakasone (1975) also ob￾served heterosis for vegetative and fruit 
yield characters in the crosses V. parviflora
× V. goudotiana and V. cauliflora × V. mono￾ica. High heterosis for fruits in certain 
crosses was observed in the combinations of 
‘Solo Yellow Sweet’ × ‘Washington’; ‘Pink 
Flesh Sweet’ × ‘Coorg Honey’; ‘Pink Flesh 
Sweet’ × ‘Washington’ and ‘Thailand’ × 
‘Washington’ (Iyer and Subramanyam, 1981). 
In crosses between ‘Pusa Delicious’ × ‘Half￾long’ and ‘Pusa Delicious’ × ‘Homestead’, high 
heterotic responses (47.34% and 39.77%, 
respectively) were observed with respect to 
fruit yield over mid-parent (Saran et al., 
2016).
The hybrids were generally superior to 
inbred individuals with regards to charac￾ters such as vigour, precocity and yield. The 
mean heterosis for yield in the first year of 
harvest was an astounding 175% over the 
mid-parent value (Chan, 1995).
Ram et al. (1999) have reported positive 
heterosis for fruit yield and number of fruits 
per plant, however, the heterosis was nega￾tive for characters such as single fruit weight 
(average), fruit length, first fruiting node, 
plant girth, plant height and days to first 
flowering. Dwivedi (1998) has also indi￾cated a negative influence of fruit length on 
fruit yield and pulp weight. The papaya hy￾brids ‘SS-72/12 × 4’, ‘SS-72/12 × 6’, ‘SEKA￾TI × 1’, ‘SEKATI × 2’, ‘SEKATI × 6’, ‘SEKATI 
× 9’ and ‘SEKATI × 20’ derived from the 
cross between 14 superior lines and four 
elite genotypes (‘SS72/12’, ‘SEKATI’, ‘JS/12’ 
and ‘41/7’), two commercial cultivars 
(‘Golden’ and ‘Tainung 1’) and the superior 
line ‘36/7’ showed negative heterosis values 
for improved black spot resistance (Poltron￾ieri et al., 2017).
6.10 Combining Ability
Ram (1982) observed that ‘Washington’ × 
‘Ramnagar Local’ had the highest specific 
combining ability (SCA) for the fruit yield 
per plant followed by ‘Pusa Delicious’ × 
‘Homestead’, ‘Waimanalo’ × ‘Halflong’ and 
‘Pusa Delicious’ × ‘Halflong’. It was the com￾bination of average combiners from both the 
inbred lines on the one hand and testers on 
the other which showed the maximum SCA 
(Ram, 1993). Dinesh et al. (1991) observed 
that the variety ‘Thailand’ was a good com￾biner for fruit length, breadth and volume, 
while ‘Sunrise Solo’ and ‘Waimanalo’ were 
good combiners for quality characters. Hybrid 
vigour is directly related to the degree of 
genetic divergence of the parents involved. 
However, a high genetic divergence does 
not necessarily increase the expression of 
heterosis (Duarte et al., 2003). The ‘Pusa 
Dwarf’ and ‘Sunrise Solo’ varieties were found

to have a greater general combining ability 
(gca) effect for various characters than the 
variety ‘Coorg Honey Dew’ indicating the 
predominance of additive gene action and 
the possibility of further selection (Jayachan￾dran Nair et al., 2010).
The ‘Pusa Majesty’ variety showed the 
highest general combining ability effects for 
fruit weight and yield. ‘Bhubaneswar Local’ 
recorded the highest specific combining 
ability effect for earliness and quality and 
‘Pusa Giant’ for dwarf habit character. The 
cross ‘Pusa Giant’ × ‘Bhubaneswar Local’ 
recorded the highest specific combining 
ability effects followed by ‘Pusa Majesty’ × 
‘CO.6’, and ‘Pusa Delicious’ × ‘Bhubaneswar 
Local’ (Dash et al., 1988). Similar results 
were reported by Ram (1993). The following 
hybrids were found to be the best combin￾ations for parents in reducing the severity of 
powdery mildew: (i) ‘Maradol’ × ‘Waimana￾lo’; (ii) ‘Maradol’ × ‘Sunrise Solo’; (iii) ‘JS 
12-4’ × ‘Sao Mateus’; (iv) ‘Sekati’ × ‘Waimana￾lo’; (v) ‘Sekati’ × ‘Golden’; (vi) ‘Sekati’ × 
‘Sunrise Solo 72/12’; (vii) ‘Sekati’ × ‘Sao 
Mateus’; (viii) ‘Waimanalo’ × ‘Sao Mateus’; 
and (ix) ‘Golden’ × ‘Sao Mateus’. The results 
also show the possibility of obtaining hy￾brids with the potential for reducing the 
severity of powdery mildew from crosses 
between genotypes of the groups ‘Solo’ and 
‘Formosa’ and at crossings within the ‘Solo’ 
group (Vivas et al., 2012). Barros et al. (2017) 
studied the combining ability estimates 
in 22 lines of papaya using testers from 
the ‘Solo’ and ‘Taiwan’ group in a top￾cross scheme.
6.10.1 Polyploidy
The genus Carica possesses nine pairs of 
chromosomes and a small genome (375 Mb). 
Meiosis is normal in the three sex types and 
there are no known polyploid cultivars. 
However, Hofmeyr (1945) reported tetra￾ploidy after colchicine treatment. Fruits 
were better than the diploid with a small 
seed cavity. However, tetraploids were less 
fertile than diploids as indicated by com￾parative seed count. According to Singh 
(1955) there was complete sterility in both 
female and male tetraploids and Singh 
expressed doubt about their commercial 
utilization. Further, Zerpa (1957) reported that 
colchicine-induced tetraploid hermaphro￾dite plants, which were used as the male 
parent in crosses with a female diploid, pro￾duced few seeds without endosperm, by 
embryo culture; two triploid plants were 
obtained which turned out to be hermaph￾rodite. Recently haploid papaya was gener￾ated by using anther culture (Tsay and Su, 
1985; Rimberia et al., 2005). The anther￾derived triploid papayas were found to be 
of short stature and high yield of partheno￾carpic fruit (Rimberia et al., 2005). The trip￾loids and tetraploids showed a lot of potential 
for exploitation in commercial production of 
seedless fruits (Rimberia et al., 2009). The 
aneuploids and polyploids were detected in 
somatic embryogenesis cultures of papaya 
and in vitro regeneration of polyploids was 
successful (Clarindo et al., 2008).
6.11 Mutation Breeding
Irradiation-induced mutation is increas￾ingly used as a complementary tool in plant 
breeding. It is most appropriate for improv￾ing one or two easily identifiable traits in an 
otherwise well-accepted breeding line or 
commercial variety (Chan et al., 2007). Ram 
and Majumder (1981) developed a dwarf 
mutant line in India by treating papaya seeds 
with 15 krad gamma rays. Initially, three 
dwarf plants were isolated from the M2
population which on repeated sib mating 
among the dwarf plants helped in establish￾ing a homozygous dwarf line. This was later 
named as ‘Pusa Nanha’. This is a dioecious 
variety, a dwarf (160 cm in height) and pro￾duces about 10 kg fruits per plant (Mitra 
and Dinesh, 2019). Irradiation of seed of 
‘Eksotika’ was made by using 525 Gy for dry 
seed and 42.5 Gy for pre-soaked seed. The M2
population, that was developed by self￾pollinating M1
 hermaphrodite plants, was 
dwarf and had good vigour, as expressed by 
the longer leaves (Chan and Lam, 2003; 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsVarieties and Crop Improvement 93
Chan et al., 2007). The effect of a higher ir￾radiation dosage (525 Gy) was evident, with 
more seedlings showing stunted growth 
(Chan et al., 2007). Several M2
 mutants showed 
very good resistance to malformation 
caused by Cladosporium. However, no re￾sistance to PRSV disease was found in the 
192 M2
 seedlings that were inoculated and 
screened.
Seeds of six cultivars (‘Bh65’, ‘Maradol’, 
‘Shew Mee’, ‘Sunrise Solo’, ‘Tainung’ and 
‘V3’) were irradiated at 0 Gy (control) to 120 
Gy using Cobalt-60 with strength of 237.89 
Rad min-1 by Husselman et al. (2016). They 
observed that irradiation affected seed ger￾mination negatively from 60 Gy onwards 
for most cultivars. Although ‘Sunrise Solo’ 
had poor germination, the seed that germin￾ated was of high quality as it produced 
strong trees with positive characteristics 
(stunted growth). Irradiation of ‘Sunrise 
Solo’ and ‘Bh65’ resulted in stunted plants, 
a positive effect in papaya breeding. Fruit 
production was negatively influenced by 
radiation as all treatments produced a lower 
number of fruit compared with the un￾treated control. Radiation did not influence 
fruit quality. Kumar et al. (2017a) reported 
that seeds of ‘Pusa Dwarf’ when treated with 
10 krad gamma rays before sowing produced 
fruits with a minimum central cavity, higher 
fruit weight (1463.40–1669.78 g) and greater 
pulp thickness compared with the untreated 
control. The treatment also improved fruit 
quality (soluble solids, sugars, protein and 
carotene). Higher doses (15 and 20 krad) 
were reported to be detrimental for vegeta￾tive growth, yield and quality characters. In 
the gynodioecious cultivar ‘Arka Prabhath’, 
treating the seeds with 100 Gy gamma radi￾ation before sowing caused first flowering 
at 73.41 cm plant height compared with 
82.73 cm in the untreated control. Treat￾ment with 100–500 Gy yielded fruit weigh￾ing 30.97–35.52 kg per plant compared 
with 25.60 kg per plant in the control. Sex 
type among the mutagenic population did 
not show any significant difference (Ramesh 
et al., 2019).
Chan-Tai et al. (2003) reported a herm￾aphroditic papaya mutant (SR*) from the 
‘Sunrise’ papaya cultivar that can be used to 
develop hermaphroditic progenies by self￾pollination and this trait can be transferred 
to other papaya cultivars. Hang and Chau 
(2010) used gamma irradiation ranging from 
10 Gy to 60 Gy to improve precocity and re￾duce plant height on a local papaya variety 
‘Dai Loan Tim’. Four mutants were reported to 
be superior in plant height at first flowering, 
plant vigour, fruit yield and quality com￾pared with non-mutants.
‘Pusa Dwarf’ seeds when treated with 
0.50% EMS produced fruits with a min￾imum central cavity, maximum fruit length, 
fruit diameter, weight and pulp thickness. 
The fruits obtained from the seeds treated 
with 0.50% EMS had significantly higher 
TSS, sugar, fat, ash, carbohydrate, protein and 
carotene and minimum moisture content 
during both the years of study (Kumar et al., 
2017b).
6.12 Marker-assisted Breeding
The use of marker-assisted breeding poses 
great potential to reduce time, cost and ef￾fort involved in papaya breeding (molecular 
markers for crop improvement have also 
been discussed in Chapter 5, this volume). 
Marker-assisted selection (MAS) has allowed 
important progress in terms of crop improve￾ment. RAPD was exploited for this purpose 
of understanding the genetic relationship 
among different varieties of papaya with less 
defined genetic background (Stiles et al., 
1993). Saraswathi et al. (2007) used RAPD 
markers to determine the pulp colour of 
gynodioecious varieties ‘Sunrise Solo’ and 
‘Kopho Solo’ and dioecious selection ‘9-1D’. 
The extent of polymorphism (47.74%) 
indicated the existence of a narrow genetic 
variation among the test types. The arbi￾trary primer OPC-05 discriminated between 
the red and yellow types of dioecious pa￾paya, similarly primer OPK-13 distinguished 
the indigenous dioecious form from exotic 
gynodioecious forms which confirm the 
hypothesis that the male parent governs the 
pulp colour in papaya. MAS is considered to

be a simpler strategy for breeding selection 
than selection based mainly on phenotype 
(Kwon et al., 2001). Oliveira et al. (2010) 
demonstrated that the use of SSRs in MAS 
is an effective procedure for developing in￾bred lines in that genotyping and selection 
for desired traits can be carried out in early 
generations on these homozygous individ￾uals. Priyanka et al. (2017) developed ex￾pressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from 
SSR markers which are considered more 
valuable as they are derived from the con￾served genetic portion. These developed EST￾SSR primers are being used for the genetic 
improvement of papaya, for example to study 
cross-transferability across genera/species, 
evaluation of genetic diversity, and identifi￾cation of sex-specific markers.
6.13 Conclusion
Papaya continues to increase in importance 
as a fruit crop. Although more than 300 
papaya varieties are grown in about 60 
countries of the world, only about 20 var￾ieties are involved in international trade. 
The obvious reason is that established com￾mercial varieties translate to revenue and 
diverse varieties have too many variations 
for effective marketing and sales.
Highland papayas (Vasconcellea spp.) 
possess a number of desirable traits. Pre￾breeding of papaya by hybridizing it with 
wild relatives in the family Caricaceae
could yield new traits of value to papaya 
production. Priorities in papaya breeding 
are for development of ‘designer’ papaya 
varieties that could: (i) have extended ripen￾ing; (ii) be resistant to PRSV; (iii) be tolerant 
of waterlogging and cold; (iv) have in￾creased nutritive values for vitamins and 
antioxidants in the fruit; and (v) have the 
novelty of serving the fruit with minimal 
handling.
PRSV is the major threat for papaya 
production throughout the world. Trans￾genic papayas have been developed, but the 
breakdown of PRSV resistance is the major 
challenge facing transgenic papaya cultiva￾tion. Researchers from producing countries 
should develop PRSV-resistant transgenic 
varieties using their own PRSV isolates 
through post-transcriptional gene silencing 
technology. The other option is to develop 
intergeneric hybrids (Carica with Vascon￾cellea) resistant to PRSV.
Techniques have been developed to 
overcome genetic incompatibility from 
intergeneric crosses, using embryogenesis 
(also discussed in Chapter 4, this volume). 
Recurrent somatic embryogenesis may pro￾duce attractive explants for genetic trans￾formation and production of transgenic 
plants. These new methods, knowledge and 
tools may be applied in breeding to improve 
fruit quality, and in selection and breeding 
for disease resistance.

7 Nutrition and Irrigation
Sisir Mitra*
Former Professor, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, 
Mohanpur, West Bengal, India
7.1 Introduction
The nutritional demand of papaya differs from 
other fruit crops because of its tremendous 
yield potential, precocious bearing and in￾determinate growth habit with simultaneous 
vegetative growth, flowering and fruiting 
(Jadhav et al., 2016). The nutrient uptake 
of papaya variety ‘CO.1’ was studied by 
Veerannah and Selvaraj (1984). Maximum 
uptake of nutrients was observed after 
flowering (Table 7.1). The nutrients removed 
by the whole plant at harvest were 305 kg 
ha-1, 103 kg ha-1, 524 kg ha-1, 327 kg ha-1and 
183 kg ha-1 of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respect￾ively. Thus, the ratio of N, P, K removal was 
1:0.34:1.71. This nutrient uptake data shows 
that a continuous supply of nutrients is 
essential for proper growth and fruiting of 
papaya.
7.2 Soil
The papaya tree is able to grow on many dif￾ferent soils. The most important requirement 
for successful papaya cultivation is that soil 
should have good drainage: poor drainage 
leads to the development of root rots. A porous 
loam or sandy loam soil is preferred. It 
grows best in deep, rich, sandy loam soils.
Papaya grows well at a soil pH between 
5.0 and 7.0, with the range between 5.5 and 
6.5 being more desirable (Awada et al., 
1975). In Australia, commercially planted 
papaya performs best in well-drained soils 
with a minimum topsoil depth of 0.5 m, a 
pH of 5.5–6.5 and shelter from strong winds 
(O’Hare, 1993; Elder et al., 2000). In south 
India, it grows well in well-drained, medium 
black to red loamy soils with a pH range of 
6.5–7.0 (Satisha et al., 2016).
7.3 Salinity
Fruit crops are moderately to highly suscep￾tible to salt stress and their production is 
adversely affected by accumulation of salt. 
Salinity affects growth and development of 
plants in various ways through its impact on 
photosynthesis, water relations and nutri￾ent absorption (Ramteke and Sachin, 2016).
Although papaya exhibits different sen￾sitivities to salinity, it can grow in semi-arid 
regions (Pares and Basso, 2013). The pres￾ence of NaCl in irrigation water caused inhib￾ition of growth in young plants. A significant

reduction in chlorophyll content was also 
detected. Tissue concentration of N and Na 
increased with increasing levels of NaCl 
(0.001–8.0 ds m-1), while K, Zn, Cu and Fe 
decreased. The contents of Ca, Mg, P and 
Mn were not affected (Pares and Basso, 
2013). Ritter and Marler (1990) reported a 
50% reduction in seedling emergence when 
irrigated with saline water at 5.1 ds m-1. No 
seedling emergence occurred by using sa￾line water at 13.9 ds m-1. From the results of 
an in vitro experiment, Beniwal and Laura 
(2010) ranked papaya cultivars ‘Ranchi 
Dwarf’ and ‘Farm Selection’ as susceptible/
sensitive, cultivar ‘Honey Dew’ as moder￾ately tolerant, and cultivar ‘Local’ as com￾paratively tolerant to salinity. In a semi-arid 
region, cultivar ‘Maradol’ showed moderate 
tolerance to salinity (Pares and Basso, 2013).
7.4 Mycorrhizas
Mycorrhizal associations occur in about 
90% plants (Atwell et al., 1999). The plants 
supply carbon to the symbiotic fungus, 
which assists the plants with nutrient up￾take from the soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizas 
(AM) are the most common fungi associated 
with plants and they colonize about 80% of 
all species. The two other mycorrhizal types, 
ectomycorrhizas and ericoid mycorrhizas 
are found only in a few families, including 
some trees (Menzel, 2005).
Papaya plants have shown high capabil￾ities from association with AM and to benefit 
from AM in fumigated and unfumigated soils 
(Trindade et al., 2000). Trees responded to 
inoculation with efficient AM fungi and re￾duced the need for P fertilization (Mamatha 
et al., 2002). Inoculation with AM fungus 
Glomus fasciculatum at 2.0 g of AM fungus per 
10.0 g of seeds before sowing resulted in 
significant benefits to seedling growth in 
the nursery (Lessa et al., 2013). Khade and 
Rodrigues (2009) reported an increase in 
elements P and K in papaya plants inocu￾lated with AM fungi, and Glomus mosseae
was found to be the most effective species of 
AM fungus causing the highest root colon￾ization and exerting a profound influence on 
growth of papaya. Mohandas (2012) reported 
better performance of AM-inoculated plants 
than the uninoculated control at all levels of 
applied P (50%, 75% or 100% of the recom￾mended dose of P fertilizer, i.e. 240 g per 
plant year-1). G. mosseae was more effective 
in improving plant growth, fruit yield, and 
P and Zn contents of leaf tissues than G. fas￾ciculatum at 75% and 50% P levels. The 
total soluble solids (TSS) content of fruit in￾creased at 75% of the recommended dose 
of P with both fungi. It was suggested that 
applying on-farm-produced AM inocula to 
papaya cultivation could save 25% of the P 
application. Higher yields were achieved 
in the presence of AM fungi even under 
drought conditions (Elder et al., 2002). The 
improved growth and development of mycor￾rhizal plants, especially in a stressful envir￾onment, is partly attributed to better water 
status of leaf tissues (Colla et al., 2008). Spe￾cies richness of AM fungi is higher in semi￾organically to organically managed fields than 
in conventionally managed fields (Khade 
and Rodrigues, 2008). In field studies, both 
G. mosseae and Entrophospora colombiana
resulted in increased growth, average fruit 
weight and yield for ‘Maradol’ papaya 
(Vazquez-Hernandez et al., 2011).

7.5 Effect of Nutrients
7.5.1 Nitrogen
Papaya plants generally respond quickly to 
soil-applied nitrogen (N). N is the most im￾portant nutrient affecting growth and prod￾uctivity of papaya. The critical levels of 
N in the petiole was estimated to be 1.44% 
in dry matter (Awada and Long, 1980). In a 
sand culture experiment, Thomas et al. (1995) 
observed progressive change in colour of 
only the older leaves from green to light 
green to yellowish green to completely yel￾low of ‘Cariflora’ papaya under N deficiency. 
The deficiency also caused reduced leaf size. 
When N deficiency was severe, all of the 
leaves turned yellow, new leaves had slim￾mer stems and leaf laminas were not well 
developed (Cibes and Gaztambide, 1978; 
Costa and Costa, 2003).
The literature concerning N nutrition 
in papaya is fairly extensive. Application of 
250 g N per plant caused highest yield 
(18.35 kg per plant and 56.63 t ha-1) of pa￾paya cultivar ‘Coorg Honey Dew’ (Reddy et al., 
1990), however, fruit quality was not affected 
at different rates (0–750 g per tree year-1) of 
N (Reddy and Kohli, 1989) or increasing the 
rates from 50 kg ha-1 to 150 kg ha-1 (Werner, 
1993). Bakshi et al. (2012) reported max￾imum average fruit weight (1624.75 g) and 
average fruit yield (42.3 kg per plant) in cul￾tivar ‘Coorg Honey Dew’ with 250 g N per 
plant year-1.
Different sources of N (e.g. ammonium 
sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea) are used 
for fertilizing papaya. Urea is used most 
commonly in many countries. Nitrate is eas￾ily leached from the soil, and volatilization 
of N may be excessive from urea placed on 
the soil surface (Noellch et al., 2009). Use of 
ammonium nitrate as a source of N increased 
yield and ascorbic acid content compared 
with ammonium sulfate in yellow Acrisol 
(Marinho et al., 2001). The use of controlled￾release N fertilizers, which constitute in￾puts whose granules are protected with a 
layer of composed mineral additives and 
polymers, favours gradually increasing the 
N supply in the soil solution and consequently 
improving its use efficiency by plants 
throughout their cultivation (Grant et al., 2012).
7.5.2 Phosphorus
Symptoms of phosphorus (P) deficiency 
have been induced in sand culture and vari￾ous symptoms of deficiency have been de￾scribed. Deficiency symptoms first appeared 
in older leaves, which showed a yellow 
mottling along the margins. As the deficiency 
became acute, the mottled areas turned nec￾rotic and the lobe tips and margins rolled 
upwards. Finally, these leaves yellowed com￾pletely and abscised. Younger leaves were 
smaller and deep green in colour (Cibes and 
Gaztambide, 1978).
High rates of P fertilization (200 lb acre-1
/224.17 kg ha-1) at an early growth stage 
increased fruit set and yield, however, it 
lowered the TSS content of fruit (Awada 
and Long, 1978). Significant increases in 
the plant growth were reported with in￾creased rates of P application, when soil P 
was 4.8 kg ha-1 at all stages of growth (Jau￾hari and Singh, 1971). Using 32P-labelled 
single superphosphate (250 g of 0.1 mCig-1 P 
specific activity), Kotur and Murthy (2003) 
suggested placement of fertilizer in 15–20 cm 
bands between 10 cm and 60 cm radial dis￾tance from each plant during pre-bearing for 
optimum absorption. During the fruit-bearing 
stage, 30 cm bands may be placed between a 
distance of 20 cm and 80 cm radial distance 
from each plant to achieve high absorption 
of P from phosphate.
7.5.3 Potassium
Potassium (K) is required in relatively large 
quantities by fruit trees. The papaya plant 
requires more K than N (Veerannah and Sel￾varaj, 1984; Mitra and Dhaliwal, 2009). K is 
recognized as an element which improves 
major quality parameters of papaya fruit 
such as increasing pulp thickness and TSS 
and decreasing fruit acidity (Mitra and 
Dhaliwal, 2009; Romheld and Kirkby, 2010).

Plants deficient in K developed a poor 
root system. The first symptom of K defi￾ciency was found to be the angle at which 
the peduncle grew in relation to the stem. In 
normal plants, the leaves were usually at an 
acute angle or slightly upright while the 
leaves grew at an oblique angle when the 
plant was growing under conditions of K 
deficiency. The older leaves turned green￾ish yellow with a slight marginal necrosis in 
some of the deep lobes (Cibes and Gaztam￾bide, 1978). In severely K-deficient plants, 
leaf margins appeared burnt and sap would 
not flow freely when the skin was broken 
and plants were most susceptible to disease 
(Anonymous, 2000). K deficiency caused 
reduced leaf water potential, increased 
soluble protein and carbohydrate content, 
accumulation of putrescence, increased res￾piration and reduced pyruvate kinase 
activity (Pan et al., 1994).
In sandy soil, K is easily leached out. 
Acidic sandy soils located in high rainfall 
zones are often K deficient. In such situations, 
the K requirements are usually high. Experi￾ments conducted at different locations hav￾ing varying soil types in India revealed that 
K requirement of papaya plants varied from 
140 g per plant to as high as 600 g per plant 
(Kumar et al., 2006).
Application of K at 500 g K2
O per plant 
was suggested by Purohit (1977) for papaya 
cultivar ‘Coorg Honey Dew’. Harjadi et al. 
(1995) reported increased fruit yield, latex 
yield and shelf life by applying increased 
K rates from 0 to 504 g K2O per plant. In 
papaya cultivars ‘CO.2’ and ‘CO.7’, the fruit 
yield and fruit weight increased signifi￾cantly by increasing the K application rate 
from 150 to 300 g K2
O per plant year-1 and 
thereafter declined at an application rate of 
450 g K2
O per plant year-1. K nutrition im￾proved fruit quality characters such as Brix, 
pulp thickness and carotenoid content (Mitra 
and Dhaliwal, 2009; Kumar et al., 2010).
7.5.4 Calcium
Calcium (Ca) is a major plant nutrient that 
affects cell wall and plasma membrane 
formation and plays a key role in plant 
growth, biomass production and function 
(Madani et al., 2015a).
Papaya grown in sand without Ca pro￾duced leaves that are light olive green in 
colour with yellow blotches scattered along 
the lamina. These leaves also developed 
fewer lobes than those fertilized with Ca. 
In more advanced stages of deficiency, 
the leaves turned completely yellow and 
abscised (Cibes and Gaztambide, 1978). Ca is 
needed for root and stem growth (Ganmore￾Neumann and Devidov, 1993).
Madani et al. (2013) planted seedlings 
in pots and irrigated them with a standard 
nutrient solution in a net house. Four pre￾harvest sprays were applied to the foliage 
with three different sources of Ca (calcium 
chloride, calcium nitrate and calcium propi￾onate) at four different Ca concentrations (0 
mg l-1, 60 mg l-1, 120 mg l-1 and 180 mg l-1). 
Spraying started 1 month after the seed￾lings were transplanted and was carried out 
every 2 weeks for 2 months. Results showed 
that leaf Ca concentrations were not affected 
significantly by different sources of Ca, how￾ever, increased Ca concentration applied to 
the leaves increased P and Ca content but 
decreased K and Mg contents of leaves. The 
height and diameter of the stem increased 
significantly with Ca at 180 mg l-1. In a field 
trial with mature trees, pre-harvest applica￾tion of Ca in the form of CaCl2
 at increasing 
concentrations (0 mg l-1, 4000 mg l-1 and 
5400 mg l-1) improved fruit Ca content, tex￾ture and flavour, and decreased postharvest 
weight loss and apparent disease incidence 
of the fruit (Madani et al., 2015b). Increas￾ing Ca content in fruit by using Ca sprays 
reduced anthracnose incidence of fruits in 
storage at 12 ± 2°C (Madani et al., 2014).
7.5.5 Magnesium
Research on magnesium (Mg) nutrition in 
papaya has been limited to potted plants, 
from which leaf concentrations associated 
with deficiency have been determined. In 
a sand culture experiment in Puerto Rico (Ci￾bes and Gaztambide, 1978), the first evidence 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditions106 S. Mitra
of Mg deficiency appeared near the margins 
of older leaves as numerous small necrotic 
spots. With time, these spots coalesced to 
form large straw-coloured areas. However, 
the interveinal space of such leaves remained 
green.
7.5.6 Sulfur
The only deficiency symptoms showed by 
papaya trees grown without sulfur (S) in 
sand culture was a slight yellowing of the 
leaves. However, there was no reduction in 
growth of plants which confirmed that the 
symptoms due to S deficiency were mild 
(Cibes and Gaztambide, 1978). Variations in 
S content of leaf and petiole at different growth, 
flowering and fruiting stages indicated that 
there is a smaller demand for S than other 
major nutrients by the growing papaya 
fruits (Sanyal et al., 1990).
7.5.7 Boron
High boron (B) concentrations are generally 
required for satisfactory fruit set in plants. 
Deficiency reduced flowering and pollin￾ation, whereas vegetative growth was often 
unaffected (Hanson and Breen, 1985). B as￾sists in the movement of K to the guard cells 
of leaf stomata, which help to regulate gas 
exchange and tissue hydration (Cakmak and 
Romheld, 1997).
In a sand culture experiment, Cibes and 
Gaztambide (1978) noted peculiar growth 
behaviour of papaya trees grown under con￾ditions of B deficiency. The leaves failed to 
grow to normal size and were dark green 
and leathery with part of the lamina missha￾pen. Elongation of the stem practically 
ceased, giving a tree a ‘bunchy top’ appear￾ance. In field-grown plants, symptoms first 
appeared in the shoot apical meristem and 
in fruits. In non-fruiting papaya plants, the 
young leaves became distorted, brittle and 
claw like. Mature plants were dwarfed and 
fruit set was severely reduced. Affected 
fruits tended to be seedless and poorly de￾veloped or absent, to ripen unevenly, and to 
have low sugar content (Nelson, 2012). The 
surface of fruit showed lumps of irregular 
shape and size. If symptoms appeared on 
young fruits, the fruits may not have devel￾oped to full size (Wang and Ko, 1975).
To correct a B deficiency, the right amount 
of the element must be applied to the soil or 
plant leaves. B is available as borax (11% 
B), solubor (22% B) or boric acid (17% B). B 
can be applied by spraying the foliage or 
drenching the soil with 0.25% borax or 
boric acid, alternatively soil application can 
be made with 0.5 g borax around the base of 
the plant (Wang and Ko, 1975). The critical 
level of B appears to be about 20 ppm in the 
petiole and leaf, whereas excess B occurred 
at about 70 ppm and 300 ppm, respectively 
(Perez and Childers, 1980). Acute B-deficient 
plants had a B content of 6.7 μg g-1 dry matter 
compared with 17.3 μg B g-1 dry matter in 
normal plants (Nautiyal et al., 1986).
7.5.8 Iron
Research on the role of iron (Fe) in nutrition 
of papaya is limited. Deficiency symptoms 
started to appear in the younger leaves. In a 
sand culture experiment, Cibes and Gaz￾tambide (1978) observed the pale yellow 
colour of leaves at the incipient stage under 
Fe deficiency. Subsequently, the pale yel￾low coloration became deep yellow, and fi￾nally the leaves became almost white. Soon 
after, the uppermost leaves became bleached, 
the apical portion of the stem broke down 
and turned necrotic. Lin et al. (1994) sug￾gested estimation of peroxidase activity 
which was found as a much faster and more 
sensitive method of diagnosis than the ap￾pearance of leaf yellowing. Peroxidase, 
catalase and polyphenol oxidase (catechol 
oxidase) activities increased with increas￾ing Fe concentration in the nutrient solu￾tion, but decreased at toxic levels (the 
activities of all three enzymes were higher 
at 10 μM Fe, when plants appeared nor￾mal, than at 0.0 μM or 0.5 μM Fe, when 
they appeared Fe deficient or at 100.0 μM 
Fe). The affected leaves from plants which 
were acutely deficient in Fe contained

about 85 μg Fe g-1 dry matter compared with 
140 μg Fe g-1 dry matter in normal plants 
(Nautiyal et al., 1986).
Fe is available as iron sulfate (23% Fe) 
and iron chelate or iron EDDHA (Sequestre￾neTM, 5–15% Fe). Deficiencies can be cor￾rected by foliar spray.
7.6 Effect of Nitrogen, Phosphorus 
and Potassium
Depending on the cultivar, soil fertility sta￾tus and growing environment, the require￾ment of N, P and K for papaya growing in 
India varies from 140 g to 375 g N per 
plant, from 70 g to 340 g P per plant and 
from 140 g to 600 g K per plant (Kumar 
et  al., 2006). Fertilizer recommendations 
for optimum yield for locally available 
varieties of small-sized ‘Sunrise Solo’, 
medium-sized ‘Homestead selection’ and 
large-sized ‘Dahomey Large’ in south-west 
Nigeria include 50 g per tree month-1 of 
NPK (15-15-15) mixture (Adelaja and 
Olaniyan, 2000).
Productivity of the papaya plant is de￾pendent on its constant growth, for which 
required rates of fertilizers and organic ma￾nures should be applied at frequent inter￾vals. Application of fertilizers at an interval 
of 15 days for the first 6 months after plant￾ing was suggested by Ochse et al. (1961). 
Application of N, P and K each at 200 g per 
plant in four split doses at 1, 3, 5 and 
7 months after planting increased the growth, 
caused early flowering and increased yield 
(Rao and Shanmugavelu, 1971), however 
Perez and Vargas (1977) did not find any 
significant difference between the mean 
yield of plants receiving monthly applica￾tion of 0.227 kg per plant and 0.454 kg per 
plant of 15-15-15 (NPK) commercial fertil￾izer mixture. Purohit (1977) reported the 
highest yield from plants of cultivar ‘Coorg 
Honey Dew’ receiving 250 g N, 110 g P and 
415 g K per plant year-1 applied in six split 
applications. Sulladmath et al. (1981) re￾ported that application of N and P at 250 g 
per plant year-1 produced 79.9 fruits per 
plant weighing 25.7 kg (64.4 t ha-1) during a 
12 month period. Peel thickness and seed 
weight decreased at higher rates of N, P and 
K application while it increased the TSS 
content of fruit. Application of 250 g N per 
plant year-1 and 150 g P per plant year-1
resulted in a yield of fruit of 38.2 kg per 
plant to 39.5 kg plant in ‘Sunrise Solo’ 
(Jayaprakash et al., 1992).
Clonal ‘Honey Gold’ papaya requires 
about 250 kg N ha-1, 20 kg P ha-1 and 340 kg 
K ha-1 to produce 100 t of fruit (Cripps and 
Allan, 1997). In Udipsamment Alfic soil in 
Corrientes, Argentina, application of 200 g 
N, 64 g P2
O5
 and 166 g K2
O per plant resulted 
in an average yield of 16.3 t ha-1 compared 
with 7.8 t ha-1 in the absence of N, P and K 
(Bertuzzi et al., 1996). Singh et al. (1998) 
recorded the highest yield (26.5 kg per plant) 
by application of 200 g N, 300 g P2
O5
 and 
150 g K2
O per plant year-1.
7.7 Effect of Micronutrients
Not many field trials have been conducted 
to determine the response of papaya to 
application of micronutrients. However, 
some information is available about symp￾toms of micronutrient deficiencies from sand 
culture experiments (Wang and Ko, 1975; 
Cibes and Gaztambide, 1978; Nautiyal et al., 
1986; Costa and Costa, 2003).
Improvement in flowering, fruiting and 
fruit quality of papaya by foliar spraying of 
boron at 2 ppm was reported (Shanmugavelu 
et al., 1973). Chapman et al. (1978) recom￾mended basal dressing of fertilizer along with 
20 g borax m2
 in sandy soil or 10 g borax m2
on heavy soil, side dressing in 9–10-month￾old plants at 10 g borax per plant, or foliar 
spray of soluble polyborate (20.5% B) at 
300 g 100 l-1 or borax at 500 g 100 l-1 to minimize 
the boron deficiency in papaya. Spraying 
with borax (15 days after transplanting the 
seedlings and three times at monthly intervals) 
at 0.15% improved fruit quality (sugar: acid 
ratio) (Pant and Lavania, 1989).
A combined spray of Mn (0.25%) and 
Cu (0.25%) twice, at 60 days and 90 days 
after transplanting, increased yield (39.98 kg 
per plant) of papaya cultivar ‘Ranchi’. The

treatment also increased average fruit weight, 
total sugar and sugar: acid ratio (Ghanta et al., 
1992). Addition of B (0.1%) in this combin￾ation (Mn + Cu) significantly increased the 
papain yield (5.20 g per plant) compared with 
untreated plants (3.40 g per plant) (Ghanta 
et al., 1994). Pant and Lavania (1998) re￾ported that spraying papaya cultivar ‘Pant 
Papaya 1’ with 0.15% FeSo4
 + 0.15% ZnSo4
produced the highest percentage of female 
plants (56.3%). However, yields were high￾est with larger fruits when 0.15% borax was 
included in the spraying treatment. In pa￾paya cultivar ‘Washington’, foliar spraying 
of CuSo4
 (0.25%), MnSo4
 (0.25%) and borax 
(0.1%) caused significant increase in plant 
growth, fruit yield, size, Brix, total sugar 
and ascorbic acid content of fruit (Chandra 
Shekhar et al., 2010). Deshmukh et al. (2013) 
reported significant increase in plant growth, 
yield and fruit quality by foliar application 
of ZnSo4
 (0.5%) and borax (0.1%) at 4, 8, 12 
and 16 months after transplanting. Com￾bined spraying of zinc and boron increased 
sugar and ascorbic acid content of fruit and 
decreased fruit acidity (Kavitha et al., 2000; 
Singh et al., 2010, Modi et al., 2012).
7.7.1 Tissue analysis
Tissue analysis is based on the premise that 
the plant behaviour is related to the concen￾trations of the essential minerals in tissue. 
Leaf analysis is a method for assessing the 
nutrient requirements of a given crop, and 
is based on the assumption that within cer￾tain limits, there is a positive relationship 
between the doses of the nutrient supplied, 
leaf content and the yield (Bhargava and 
Singh, 2001). Viegas et al. (1999) observed 
higher nutrient accumulation and dry 
matter at 210, 270 and 330 days after trans￾planting. The accumulation of different 
macro- and micronutrients was in the order 
N > K > Ca > Mg > S > P > Fe > Mn > Zn > B 
> Cu, with values of 208 kg ha-1, 180 kg ha-1, 
87 kg ha-1, 47 kg ha-1, 15 kg ha-1, 0.373 kg ha-1, 
0.282 kg ha-1, 0.216 kg ha-1, 0.199 kg ha-1 and 
0.116 kg ha-1, respectively. The highest plant 
dry matter accumulation was 4.844 kg ha-1 by 
application of 343 g N per plant.
Many researchers compare the sensitiv￾ity of the blade and the petiole when study￾ing diagnosis of the nutritional status of 
papaya, obtaining mixed results. Bhargava 
et al. (1989) suggested estimation of the sixth 
petiole from the apex to understand the nu￾tritional status of the plant. Using the sixth 
leaf as an index leaf, Sanyal et al. (1990) 
observed that the concentrations of all elem￾ents (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) were generally 
higher in the leaf blade except K which was 
higher in the petiole. The leaf blade tissue 
was suggested for determining P, Ca and Mg 
status of the plant while the petiole was best 
for K, and the optimum sampling time was 
at flowering. However, both leaf and petiole 
were suitable for analysing N status and the 
optimum sampling time was at flowering. 
Awada and Long (1971) identified the re￾cently matured leaves as the index tissue for 
analysis of N, P and K in papaya. Costa 
(1995) found that nutrient concentrations in 
the petiole correlated best with the nutri￾tional state of the plant.
The diagnosis and recommendation in￾tegrated system (DRIS) has been used in 
studies of the diagnosis of nutritional status 
in crops. This makes it possible to carry out 
the nutritional diagnosis of a plant or crop 
based on the calculation of indices for each 
nutrient, evaluated by the ratio of each ele￾ment to the other elements, and comparing 
them in pairs with other standard ratios, where 
mineral composition is obtained from a popu￾lation of highly productive plants (Barbosa 
et al., 2006). Once such norms are derived, it 
is possible to make a diagnosis of the crop 
condition at any stage of the crop develop￾ment, thereby isolating the factors which 
are likely to be responsible for limiting the 
growth and production (Bhargava and 
Singh, 2001). Bhargava et al. (1989) devel￾oped the optimum status of nutrient in peti￾oles (Table 7.2) using the DRIS approach for 
papaya cultivar ‘Coorg Honey Dew’. The 
values may be used for monitoring nutrient 
application.
DRIS, when used in conjunction with a 
critical concentration approach to interpreting 
tissue analysis data, appears to be a useful 
technique for identifying nutrient deficien￾cies of papaya (Bowen, 1992).
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsNutrition and Irrigation 109
Anjaneyulu and Raghupathi (2010) de￾veloped multivariate diagnostic norms for 
papaya using compositional nutrient diag￾nosis (CND) to improve diagnostic preci￾sion and carried out principal component 
analysis (PCA) to understand interactions 
among different nutrients that govern yield 
and quality of papaya. They conducted a 
survey of commercial papaya-growing or￾chards, collecting petiole samples to estab￾lish a data bank of nutrient concentrations 
versus yield. The data bank was used for de￾veloping multivariate CND norms for assess￾ing the nutritional status of various orchards. 
The mean N, P and K concentrations were 
1.14%, 0.198% and 2.32%, respectively. The 
mean Ca (2.95%) concentration was three 
times higher compared with Mg (1.03%). The 
mean values of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu were 1.956 
ppm, 76 ppm, 56 ppm and 8 ppm, respectively. 
The multivariate CND norms developed for 
ten nutrients proved to be an important tool 
for diagnosis of nutrient imbalance in papaya. 
However, large variations in absolute nutrient 
concentrations necessitated the application 
of PCA, which explained the interaction 
among different nutrients. The nutrient indi￾ces developed indicated that Zn was the most 
common yield-limiting nutrient. The CND 
norms and the indices developed can be used 
for identifying the hidden hunger of various 
nutrients in papaya for evolving nutrient 
management strategies.
7.7.2 Nutrient content in leaf tissue and yield
Maximum yield of ‘Solo’ papaya was found 
to be associated with petiole N content of 
1.44% and 2.52% of K (Awada and Long, 
1980). Application of N at 250 g per plant 
year-1 produced a yield of 13.35 kg per 
plant which also showed increased N content 
in petioles at 6 months after planting but de￾creased the contents of P, K and Ca. Reddy 
et al. (1989) reported a highly significant 
correlation between petiole P concentration 
and yield. The relationship between petiole 
P and yield was better for recently matured 
leaves. The highest estimated fruit yield of 
155.5 t ha-1 over a 24-month cropping period 
was obtained with 250 g N, 375 g P2
O5
 and 
500 g K2
O per plant. Application of bovine 
biofertilizers (0–2.0 l per pit) in liquid form 
in the soil increased the N, P, K, Mg and S in 
the leaf dry matter. The addition of bioferti￾lizer to the soil met the requirements of P and 
S of papaya (Menezes-Junior et al., 2014).
7.8 Fertigation
Application of soluble fertilizers through 
the irrigation water has many advantages 
over broadcasting solid fertilizers (Menzel 
et al., 2002). Because of continuous growth, 
flowering and fruiting of papaya, the plant 
requires a regular supply of both nutrients 
and water for maximum growth and fruiting 
(Kumar et al., 2008). Frequent application 
of nutrients through a drip irrigation system 
improved the uptake of nutrients through 
two mechanisms: (i) continuous replenish￾ment of nutrients in the depletion zone in the 
vicinity of the root surface; and (ii) enhanced 
transport of dissolved nutrients by mass 
flow, due to high average water content in 
the medium (Sathya et al., 2008). Frequency 
of fertigation means that the concentration 
of immobile elements such as P, K and trace 
elements can be reduced. Fertigation sig￾nificantly increased yield at low concentra￾tion levels which is believed to be primarily 
related to enhancement of nutrient uptake 
(Silber et al., 2003).
By using fertigation, application of annual 
rates of fertilizers (N, P and K) can often be 
reduced by 30–50% compared with stand￾ard under-tree fertilizing. Jeykumar et al. 
(2001) reported an increase of 23.9% in the 
number of fruits produced per plant and a 
30.6% increase in fruit weight (Table 7.3) by 
Table 7.2. Critical nutrient concentration in papaya 
petiole of cultivar ‘Coorg Honey Dew’. From 
Bhargava et al., 1989.
Nutrient Sixth petiole (%) Eleventh petiole (%)
Nitrogen 1.66 1.38
Phosphorus 0.50 0.30

fertigation compared with conventional 
irrigation and placement of fertilizers. 
Sadarunnisa et al. (2010) indicated that 
75% N and K when applied through fertigation 
caused a yield of 100.42 kg per plant which was 
on a par with the yield of plants supplied with 
100% rates of N and K. Chaudhri et al. (2001) 
indicated that a normal yield as produced with 
the recommended dose (200 g each) of N, P 
and K could be achieved with even a 50% 
reduction in recommended fertilizer dose, 
provided liquid fertilizer (8:8:8) was used 
through drip irrigation. Fertigation of papaya 
‘CO.7’ with 100% N and K through drip ir￾rigation (50 g N at 6.25 g per plant week-1
and 50 g K2
O per plant week-1) for a 2-month 
period (starting from the third month after 
planting), in addition to soil application of 
50 g P2
O5
 per plant at bimonthly intervals re￾sulted in earlier flowering, and maximum 
yield (184.9 t ha-1) with a high cost benefit 
ratio (1:1.97) (Jeykumar et al., 2010).
7.9 Nutrition Management in Organic 
Production
The demand for large quantities of nutrients 
by papaya continues until the plants are 
approximately 12 months old. This is par￾ticularly so for the 5-month period from 
transplanting to first flowering, when the 
stem girth achieved by the plants just before 
flowering dictates the vigour and product￾ivity of the plant. Fruit production for the 
duration of the plant’s life is adversely affected 
if the plant receives insufficient nutrition dur￾ing the crucial period and the plant becomes 
weak (Martin et al., 2019).
The demand for organic papaya from 
different countries such as the USA, the 
European Union and Japan has increased in 
the recent past. However, very little infor￾mation is available in producing countries 
for nutrition management in organic papaya 
cultivation. Olubode et al. (2013) found that 
there was a positive effect of organic ma￾nure on papaya growth and yield, and it 
also had the ability to: (i) bind soil together; 
(ii) absorb water more easily; and (iii) release 
nutrients steadily. Although organic manure 
contains plant nutrients in small quantities 
compared with inorganic fertilizers, their 
positive attributes range from building up of 
organic matter, good soil aggregation, perme￾ability of soil and related physical properties 
to long-lasting supply of several macro- and 
micronutrients, and vital plant-health￾promoting substances, as well as increasing 
the soil microbe density (Martin et al., 2019).
Various types of organic compounds such 
as compost, vermicompost, vermicompost￾ing leachate, liquid bioferment, biofertiliz￾ers and green manure are used to supply 
nutrients or make the nutrients available to 
the plant from the soil. To control pests and 
diseases, predators, antagonistic organisms 
and extracts or infusions of various plants 
and trap plants are used in the organic pro￾duction system. As papaya is a high nutri￾ent-demanding crop, organic production 
decreases yield in most of the available 
reports. Reddy et al. (2010) recorded a yield 
of 55 t ha-1 with inorganic fertilizer treat￾ment compared with only 26.9–38.0 t ha-1 in 
an organic production system. However, the 
shelf life of the fruit was significantly higher 
in organic treatments (6.2–7.9 days) com￾pared with fruits produced with inorganic

fertilizer treatment (5.1 days). Stice et al. 
(2014) reported 5.75% higher yield in con￾ventional treatment than the organic treat￾ment. Average fruit weight was, however, 
about 2.5% higher in the organic system 
than the conventional system. Rekha Eda 
et al. (2018) reported increased fruit firm￾ness (11.53 kg cm-2), ascorbic acid content 
(67.33 mg 100 g-1), TSS (13.32°Brix) and 
total sugars (8.92%) of papaya fruit cultivar 
‘Arka Prabhat’ by use of farmyard manure 
and sheep manure compared with treatment 
with inorganic fertilizers.
Applying organic manures, bokashi com￾post (residues from leaves and stems of weeds, 
coffee pulp, sugarcane molasses, bovine ma￾nure and lactic acid bacteria), liquid bioferment 
and vermicompost and controlling pests and 
diseases by infusions of garlic, tobacco, worm￾seed, thyme and chilli, and ethanolic extracts 
of cloves, chamomile, cinnamon and garlic, 
Ruiz-Coutiño et al. (2019) reported higher 
TSS, vitamin C and reducing sugar contents 
of ‘Maradol’ papaya fruit. The fruit from the 
organically managed plots were also soft 
and juicy with a higher score in aroma com￾pared with conventionally produced fruits. 
Martin et al. (2019) reported higher yield 
of ‘Tainung No. 2’ papaya by using Agribi￾otics® (microbes and humic acid) compared 
with conventional fertilizer treatment.
7.10 Irrigation
Papaya responds readily to copious water￾ing in well-drained soil. It is, however, im￾portant to prevent ‘wet feet’ (i.e. watering, 
especially around the stem). During heavy 
rains care should be taken that no water 
stands around the tree trunk for a long period. 
Regular irrigation helps tree and fruit devel￾opment (Carvalho et al., 2014). Optimum 
soil moisture helps in rapid fruit develop￾ment and also to obtain regular fruit yield. 
Water deficit reduced the number of flowers 
and fruits by 86% and 58%, respectively, 
and also retarded growth and development 
of fruit (Masri et al., 1990). Giron et al.
(Chapter 8, this volume) provide further 
information on plant water relations that 
addresses the physiological changes due to 
deficit irrigation. In well-drained soil, irrigation 
at shorter intervals during the early crop 
stages results in good establishment and also 
encourages better plant development (Puro￾hit, 1981). The different systems of irrigation 
such as basin, ring and micro-irrigation have 
been used in papaya. Drip irrigation permits 
the efficient use of water and can save 30–40% 
water compared with traditional ring or 
basin systems of irrigation.
Papaya irrigation may be managed suc￾cessfully either by monitoring soil water 
data obtained from a neutron probe, diviner 
or Class A evaporation pan. Irrigation water 
savings of about 65% were obtained using 
any of these methods compared with using 
a set schedule of irrigation (Migliaccio et al., 
2010). The literature proposes several Class 
A pan evaporation coefficient recommenda￾tions, based on canopy development and 
the degree of stress the crop is capable of 
handling (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1975). In 
Hawaii, the pan evaporation coefficient 
values are between 0.33 and 1.62, demon￾strating that the amount of irrigation water 
has a positive relationship with the crop de￾velopment (Awada et al., 1979). In South 
Africa, the recommended coefficient is 0.65 
and the cumulative evapotranspiration should 
not exceed 25 mm in a sandy soil and 35 mm 
in a clay soil before irrigation can be applied 
(Villiers, 1999). Garcia et al. (2007) reported 
highest yield (38.98 t ha-1) of a papaya hybrid 
‘Know You Seed’ (‘Formosa’ group) by apply￾ing irrigation at 100% Class A pan evapor￾ation, corresponding to an irrigation depth 
of 1769.5 mm.
Proper irrigation and fertilizer applica￾tion for a particular environment should be 
practised if maximum productivity is to be 
achieved. High moisture levels associated 
with a normal growth rate tended to shift 
the plants towards the production of com￾mercially desirable fruit (Awada, 1961). The 
root system occupied a larger volume of soil 
under micro-sprinkler than under drip irri￾gation, with greater root concentration in the 
direction of the emitter. The effective root 
depth under surface or buried drip irrigation 
was found at 0.45 m and varied from 0.15 m 
between plant rows to 0.35 m between the

plant and the emitter in a coast Tableland 
latossol (Coelho et al., 2005). Awada et al.
(1979) studied the effects of drip irrigation 
at 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 gallons of water per plant 
daily on vegetative growth, fruit yield and 
mineral composition of the petiole in ‘Solo’ 
papaya. They recommended that the irriga￾tion rate should be 1.3 times the pan evapor￾ation of water from the previous week. The 
yield of ‘Solo’ papaya in terms of number and 
size of marketable fruits increased with 
increasing irrigation.
Biswas et al. (1999) investigated the 
effects of drip irrigation compared with 
conventional irrigation on the yield of culti￾var ‘Honey Dew’. The comparison was based 
on the ratio of irrigation water (IW):cumula￾tive pan evaporation (CPE) such that drip 
irrigation at 1, 0.8 or 0.6 IW:CPE was com￾pared with conventional irrigation. Higher 
yields (36–40 t ha-1) were obtained from 
drip-irrigated plots compared with those ir￾rigated using a conventional system (31 t ha-1). 
The best treatment in terms of yield and 
water use efficiency (WUE) was drip irrigation 
at an IW:CPE ratio of 0.8.
Water relations, growth, yield and water 
use under drip irrigation at different evapo￾ration-replenishment rates (20%, 40%, 60%, 
80%, 100% and 120% of the US Weather 
Bureau Class A Pan evaporation) with sub￾surface drip (at 250 mm depth in the soil) 
and surface drip irrigation were investigated 
at Bangalore, India (Srinivas, 1996). Increas￾ing the evaporation-replenishment rates 
from 20% to 120% increased the relative 
leaf water content by 13.2%, the transpir￾ation rate by 18.8%, plant height by 21.9%, 
stem girth by 12.5%, fruit number by 88.3% 
and yield by 34.6%. Yield during the 36 
months after planting was 96.7 t ha-1 with a 
20% evaporation-replenishment rate and 130.2 
t ha-1 with 120% evaporation-replenishment 
rate. Fruit yield differences above 60% 
evaporation-replenishment rates were not 
significant. Water use from 0 to 36 months 
after planting increased with an increase in 
evaporation-replenishment rates (from 1651 
mm to 4208 mm at the 20% and 120% re￾plenishment rates, respectively). WUE over 
this period decreased from 58.6 kg ha-1 mm-1
to 30.9 kg ha-1 mm-1 at the 20% and 120% 
replenishment rates, respectively. Subsurface 
drip irrigation resulted in significantly higher 
yields (averaging 121.4 t ha-1 compared with 
110.6 t ha-1) and WUE (averaging 40.6 kg ha-1
mm-1 compared with 37.2 kg ha-1 mm-1) than 
surface drip irrigation.
Papaya plants are considered to be 
relatively resistant to drought, although to 
achieve optimum growth or yield, sufficient 
water for irrigation is required (Bunya-atichart 
et al., 2014). Studies showed that leaf relative 
water content and xylem pressure potential 
were unaffected by drought and classified 
papaya as a species that responds to drought 
primarily via dehydration postponement 
(Mahouachi et al., 2006). However, reports 
suggest that water deficit restricts the plant’s 
growth and favours the production of male 
flowers (Niklas and Marler, 2007; dos San￾tos et al., 2008). The most sensitive stages to 
water stress are the mid-vegetative stage, 
flowering and fruit development (Aiyelaagbe 
et al., 1986).
In South Africa, 50–70 mm of irrigation 
water is applied in the dry months (Malan, 
1964). In Hawaii, papaya is irrigated with 
62 mm every 14 days in the summer and in 
Florida the irrigation frequency is every 5–6 
days (Manica, 1982). In the Canaries, fields 
are irrigated daily in order to avoid periods of 
stress (Santana and Fereres, 1986). In most 
parts of India, papayas are irrigated at 8–10-
day intervals during winter and weekly dur￾ing summer with at least 2.5 cm of water.
The water requirement for papaya grown 
under semi-arid conditions with drip irrigation 
in Puerto Rico was determined by Goenage 
et al. (2004). Five different pan evaporation 
factors between 0.25 and 1.25 in increments 
of 0.25 were tested. It was concluded that 
papaya grown under semi-arid conditions 
should be irrigated with a pan factor not 
less than 1.25. However, the different irriga￾tion treatments did not affect the sugar con￾tent of fruit. The deficit irrigation strategies 
can be used as an alternative in order to re￾duce the water amounts with the minimum 
effect on productivity (Sanchez-Blanco and 
Torrecillas, 1995). In clay loam soil with a 
pH of 7.5 and 2.3% of organic matter, the 
highest yield of papaya cultivar ‘Baixinho 
of Santa Amalia’ (a dwarf cultivar derived

from ‘Sunrise’) was obtained by irrigating 
at 1.1 class A pan evaporation level (Santana 
et al., 2008).
7.11 Conclusion
The rapid growth, continuous fruiting and 
high yield of papaya characterize it as high 
nutrient-exhaustive fruit crop. Judicious ap￾plication of fertilizers to meet a balanced 
nutrient supply is therefore necessary for 
obtaining regular and higher yield, better 
quality fruits and also increasing shelf life.
Papaya plant water demand varies in re￾lation to growth stage. Demand is substantially 
increased in trees producing new leaves, or 
coming into or being in flower, or having set 
fruit. The water requirement of plants pos￾sessing newly developing flowers is par￾ticularly high. Monitoring of water demand 
and application (irrigation) based on need at 
a particular stage, are essential to avoid crop 
loss. Flower drop, or drop of recently set 
fruits are often manifestations of poor soil 
water content. Use of fertigation based on 
nutrient needs at a specific stage and water 
demand is considered as the best option to 
supply both nutrients (especially N and K) 
and water. Foliar spraying of micronutrients 
and soil application of P are required to 
meet the requirements of the plant.

8.1 Introduction
Water deficits affect many aspects of plant 
physiology. In most species, drought causes 
stomatal closure and reduces CO2
 assimila￾tion, stem extension, leaf expansion and fruit 
growth. Some plant functions or tissues are 
more sensitive than others to drought 
(Menzel, 2005). Differences in the sensitiv￾ity of the shoots and fruit to drought have 
been used to increase yields and economic 
returns in some temperate fruits, however, 
these ideas have been little explored in 
tropical species.
Heat and decreased water availability 
may alter various physiological processes 
such as: (i) photosynthetic rate; (ii) respira￾tory rate; (iii) photosynthetic pigments con￾tent; (iv) electrolyte leakage; (v) chlorophyll 
fluorescence; (vi) fruit size; (vii) production 
and viability of seedlings; (viii) biomass pro￾duction (by decreasing the development and 
expansion of the leaves and foliar abscission); 
(ix) stomatal closure; (x) poor root develop￾ment, the rate at which water and nutrients 
are absorbed by the roots; and (xi) flowering 
and yields (Fig. 8.1). High temperatures can 
also facilitate the presence of insects and 
diseases in plants, aggravating the risk of 
crop losses (Wild, 1992; Betts, 1997; Prasad 
et al., 2002; Hewezi et al., 2008).
The productive potential of papaya is 
affected by diseases that attack foliage, roots 
and fruits. Causal organisms include vir￾uses, fungi, insects, nematodes and bacteria 
(Heine et al., 1965). However, there are also 
abiotic factors such as temperature, water 
deficit and salinity that may significantly 
affect its production. For example, during 
planting, the plant requires water for proper 
rooting, and during the flowering season to 
prevent the flowers from being sterile. Dry 
spells caused abortions of floral and fruit 
structures, leading to sterile phases and 
fruiting skips along the stem (Chan and Tee, 
1975). Constant availability of soil moisture 
caused continuous growth of papaya plants 
which resulted in regular production of 
flowers and fruits (Anonymous, 1982). Mas￾ri et al. (1990) reported reduction in flower 
(86%) and fruit (58%) production of ‘Eksot￾ika’ papaya under stress. On the other hand, 
an excess of water causes plant death due 
to the appearance of fungal root diseases 
(ASERCA, 1999), affects the absorption of 
nutrients and decreases oxygen availability 
in the root zone (Campostrini and Glenn, 
2007). Completely flooded soil can cause

death of plants in 2–4 days (Samson, 1980; 
Rodriguez et al., 2014). Mid-vegetative, 
flowering and fruit enlargement stages are 
more sensitive to water stress (Aiyelaagbe 
et al., 1986).
8.2. Water Deficit Stress
Currently, climate change has brought about 
an increase in temperatures, salinity of soils 
and a water deficit in many parts of the 
world. Those abiotic stress factors together 
affect the growth of plants and the productiv￾ity of many commercial crops, including pa￾paya. Despite being considered a tolerant crop 
to water deficit, papaya plants can experi￾ence fruit malformations, floral abortion and 
therefore production losses of up to 50% 
(Hewezi et al., 2008). Papaya requires an 
average annual rainfall of 1500 mm and aver￾age temperature of 25°C for adequate growth, 
development and high yields. In fact, water 
is the main contributor to the germination 
process, adequate growth at the nursery and 
during the first months after planting (ASER￾CA, 1999; Teixeira et al., 2007).
Water stress occurs when the amount of 
water that evaporates through transpiration is 
greater than that which the plant is able to 
incorporate through its roots. Water deficit 
stress considerably limits agricultural pro￾duction: it has been estimated that water def￾icit may decrease crop yield by up to 70% 
compared with that obtained under favour￾able conditions (Boyer, 1976). In fact, water

deficit is considered a limiting factor for 
plant growth and development, especially in 
semi-arid areas and is a recurring problem 
that affects crops worldwide. Water deficit 
stress leads to a reduction in nutrient absorp￾tion and transport from the roots to the leaves, 
a decrease in transpiration and a change in 
membrane permeability to reduce water loss 
by the plant, thus reducing production (Bota 
et al., 2004; Taiz and Zeiger, 2006).
Plants exposed to water deficit stress 
can develop through other mechanisms, 
allowing tissue turgidity to be maintained 
and evaporative loss of water to be reduced, 
which is an adaptive advantage of plants to 
water deficit (Levitt, 1980; Yancey et al., 
1982). Studies have shown that relative water 
content of leaves and xylem pressure potential 
were unaffected by drought and the papaya 
plant has been classified as a species that 
responds to drought via dehydration post￾ponement (Marler et al., 1994). Marler and 
Mickelbart (1998) reported that drought 
stress reduced net photosynthesis, altered the 
diurnal pattern of gas exchange, and decreased 
various measures of photochemical efficiency 
of papaya plants. It has been observed that 
gas exchange in papaya leaves is reduced 
under water deficit conditions. In addition, 
the decrease in soil moisture reduces plant 
height, trunk diameter, the number of leaves 
attached to the stem, and results in a delay 
in the growth and development of fruits. 
Additionally, water deficit in papaya caused 
an increase in root length relative to the 
stem, which can be considered as a mechan￾ism of tolerance to water deficit stress (Ivonne 
and Mirando, 2007).
Papaya plants from two different geno￾types, susceptible cultivar ‘Maradol’ and a 
tolerant wild genotype, were exposed to water 
deficit stress. Changes were observed in the 
morphology of leaves: leaves turned curly, 
chlorotic and finally abscission of the older 
leaves (middle stratum) occurred, leaving the 
plants with only one or two young leaves at 
the top of the stem. These changes were more 
evident in the commercial papaya cultivar 
‘Maradol’, which turned more chlorotic after 
21 days, showed more signs of wilting and 
leaf abscission was even more evident. In 
both populations, after 28 days without irri￾gation, none of the plants had green leaves, 
however, the senescent leaves were still at￾tached to the stem, which still retained greater 
turgidity in the wild population. This was 
unlike ‘Maradol’ where 30% of the plants lost 
stem turgor on day 21 of the water deficit ex￾periment, which suggests that the wild 
plants have a greater number of leaves than 
‘Maradol’ plants (Girón, 2015). Many authors 
have pointed out that plant height, the number 
of leaves, dry weight of the aerial part and 
the number of flowers per plant decrease as 
the available water in the soil is depleted 
(Qasem and Biftu, 2010; Okon, 2013).
The anatomical, morphological and 
phenological modifications of plants ex￾posed to prolonged periods of water deficit 
are basically due to alterations in seasonal 
patterns and rhythms of cell division and 
elongation. One of the main visible mani￾festations is the characteristic wilting of the 
leaves (Granados-Sánchez et al., 1998). In 
fact, a good indicator of tolerance to water 
deficit stress is late foliar senescence, which 
can be evaluated in the juvenile stage, together 
with other variables (Agbicodo et al., 2009). 
Late foliar senescence grants tolerance to 
water deficit stress, since it allows post-stress 
recovery (Hall, 2004).
De Lima et al. (2015), in a study with 
‘Grand Golden’ papaya, evaluated the mor￾phological and physiological response to 
partial root drying (PRD), regulated deficit 
irrigation (RDI) and no irrigation followed 
by rehydration in a greenhouse study (NI￾gh) or no irrigation in a field study (NI￾field), which were compared with full irri￾gation (FI). In the greenhouse study, plants 
were grown in pots with roots split equally 
between two soil columns. In the field 
study, drip emitters on opposite sides of the 
plant delivered irrigation water. In FI, the 
whole root system was irrigated at 100% of 
water use; in RDI 50% or 70% of FI water 
use was supplied to the whole root system 
(greenhouse and field study, respectively); 
in PRD 100% of FI was supplied to half the 
root zone while the other half was allowed 
to dry as only 50% or 70% of FI was sup￾plied (greenhouse and field study, respect￾ively). In the field study, PRD was achieved 
by applying different amounts of irrigation

water to alternate sides of the root system 
within the plant row. The application of 
50% water use in PRD and RDI in the green￾house study decreased shoot and root dry 
weight production, with a more pronounced 
effect on root dry weight compared with FI. 
This decrease in biomass was found to be 
associated with a decrease in net photosyn￾thetic rate on the day of most intense water 
stress for the plants in NI-gh. In the field 
study, a 30% water deficit in both PRD and 
RDI treatments showed no significant re￾duction in vegetative growth or yield com￾ponents compared with FI. In greenhouse 
conditions there was evidence of a non-hy￾draulic signal in PRD treatments decreasing 
stomatal conductance compared with RDI 
at a comparable soil water tension, but this 
showed no effect on growth and yield com￾ponents in field conditions. There was also 
no instantaneous change to leaf water use 
efficiency of PRD or RDI treatments in the 
greenhouse or the agronomic water use effi￾ciency (AWUE) (weight of fruits per litre of 
water (kg fruits l-1) and number of fruits l-1) 
in the PRD and RDI treatments in the field 
but both treatments improved AWUE com￾pared with FI. These results suggest that 
papaya can tolerate some water deficits 
without a significant reduction in yield 
components indicating that <100% ET0
 irri￾gation replacement can be scheduled but 
there is little or no benefit to PRD (ET0
 = 
reference evapotranspiration).
The sequencing of the complete genome 
of Carica papaya var. ‘SunUp’ offers a tool in 
identification of genes that participate in the 
response to abiotic stress (Ming et al., 2008). 
At the same time, wild genotypes should have 
genes related to metabolic mechanisms to 
cope with abiotic stress.
8.3. Chlorophyll Fluorescence
The parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence 
(Fv/Fm) are very sensitive physiological 
parameters that can be used as a very effect￾ive quantitative measure to characterize the 
degree of stress to which a plant is exposed. 
In addition to being sensitive, it is non￾destructive, in situ, in vivo and is a fast method. 
Therefore, its measurement is a way of esti￾mating the physiological state of photo￾system II (PS II), the main component of the 
photosynthetic apparatus (Smille and Nott, 
1982; González et al., 2000). In the litera￾ture, it has been reported for a large num￾ber of species that the value of Fv/Fm re￾mains close to 0.80. This value indicates 
that PS II is complete, and there is a highly 
efficient use of excitation energy in the 
photochemical processes, so it can be used 
as a criterion of the level of stress that a par￾ticular plant may be experiencing (Maxwell 
and Johnson, 2000; Willits and Peet, 2001).
Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) in 
young (90-day-old) well-watered papaya 
plants from cultivated and wild-type geno￾types showed values close to 0.84, indicat￾ing that PSII was not damaged and showed 
a highly efficient use of excitation energy in 
the photochemical process (Mohamed et al., 
1995). In plants exposed for 21 days to water 
deficit stress, the Fv/Fm value decreased 
slightly. However, during the recovery period

stress did not influence the values of Fv/Fm

around 0.74, compared with the Fv/Fm val￾ues found in control plants (0.80).
8.4. Electrolyte Leakage
Under stress conditions, membranes may ex￾perience changes associated with increased 
permeability and the loss of membrane in￾tegrity (Blokhina et al., 2003). Electrolyte 
leakage (EL) is a good indicator of the mem￾brane integrity and functionality and also an in￾dicator of the degree of damage to the mem￾brane, the higher the value the greater the 
membrane damage. Therefore, an increase in 
the percentage of EL indicates membrane 
damage under thermal, salinity and water def￾icit stresses. It has also been proposed that integ￾rity in upper membranes of tolerant plants 
results in a controlled EL when subjected to 
a stress condition (Chaves and Oliveira, 2004).
Well-irrigated plants from two genotypes 
(cultivar ‘Maradol’ and wild genotype) showed 
EL values of 25%. After 7 days of water def￾icit stress, EL values were higher for ‘Marad￾ol’ with 36%, compared with the wild geno￾type that only showed 29%. In ‘Maradol’ 
plants, EL values reached 50% on the day of 
maximal stress (day 21), while those from 
the wild population reached an EL of only 
36%, at the time of maximal stress. The re￾sults obtained for those plants exposed to 
water deficit treatments indicate that mem￾brane damage occurs during the first day of ex￾posure to water stress. Interestingly, after 1 
week of re-watering EL values decreased in 
both genotypes, although in ‘Maradol’ only 
to 45%. By contrast, after 1 week of being 
re-watered, plants from the wild type geno￾type did reach EL values of 25% that were 
close to those measured before the stress was 
imposed. Tolerant genotypes tend to have a 
lower EL rate compared with those susceptible 
to water deficit (Boldaji et al., 2012).
8.5 Water Potential
Water potential (ΨL) is based on the chem￾ical potential of water, that is, a quantitative 
expression of the free energy associated 
with water or, rather, the work that must be 
done to bring a unit of water mass, bound to 
the water itself or to the soil to reference state 
zero, which is pure water (Taiz and Zeiger, 
2006). It has been reported that approximate 
values of lethal foliar water potentials in 
plants are between −1.4 MPa and −6.0 MPa. 
Cowpea bean (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) 
showed values of −1.5 MPa and −2.5 MPa, 
which has allowed it to be classified as a 
species moderately tolerant to water deficit 
in the soil (Boyer, 1976); for papaya, values 
of −0.7 MPa to −0.8 MPa have been reported 
in cultivar ‘Baixinho de Santa Amalia’ 
(Mahouachi et al., 2006). These results pub￾lished by Mahouchi and others (2006) are 
supported by Marler and Mickelbart (1998). 
They showed that leaf water potential and 
xylem potential were not affected by stress 
in young papaya plants. According to the 
literature, papaya is a species that responds 
to the water deficit by postponing dehydra￾tion, so papaya plants under water deficit stress 
show a tendency to accumulate ions such as 
K+, Na+ and Cl-
 (Mahouachi et al., 2006).
The ΨL obtained for control plants of cul￾tivar ‘Maradol’ and the wild genotype was 
approximately −1.0 MPa. Values between 
−0.5 MPa and −1.0 MPa are considered to be 
an indicator that the plant is well watered 
and without stress (Taiz and Zeiger, 2006). At 
day 7 of water deficit stress, the ΨL de￾creased to −1.35 MPa in ‘Maradol’ and to 
–1.3 MPa in plants from the wild genotype. 
After 14 days of water deficit stress, the ΨL
decreased further to ΨL values of −1.8 MPa 
for ‘Maradol’, and only to −1.5 MPa in plants 
from the wild genotype (Table 8.2).
During the recovery period, both geno￾types showed the capacity to increase their 
ΨL after being re−watered, reaching ΨL simi￾lar to those measured before the water stress 
treatment was imposed. It has been widely 
documented that water deficit stress limits 
the rate of photosynthesis through stomatal 
closure (Chaves, 1991; Cornic, 2000). In pa￾paya plants, results obtained are quite inter￾esting, since water potential remains with￾out much change in the wild population and 
with a recovery in ‘Maradol’. Mahaouchi et al. 
(2006) also could not observe much variation

in leaf water potential of papaya seedlings 
undergoing a long period of water deficit 
stress.
Primed acclimatization (PA) in crop 
irrigation scheduling is the use of a temporary 
period of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), 
imposing mild or moderate deficits, to evoke 
a primed state, after which full evapotrans￾piration replacement is resumed (Vincent 
et al., 2015). Vincent et al. (2015) conducted 
two experiments to test a plant-based ap￾proach to determine the appropriate level of 
soil water potential needed to evoke a primed 
response in papaya plants. This was done 
through a substrate (potting media) dry-down 
experiment with one group of plants irri￾gated to field capacity and the second group 
of plants for which the soil was allowed 
to dry gradually. Physiological responses 
were assessed to determine at what point a 
mild-to-moderate level of stress was reached 
and the second experiment was conducted to 
test the effects of a priming stress (the level set 
in the first objective) on leaf gas exchange, 
net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conduct￾ance (gs
), transpiration (E) and chlorophyll 
fluorescence in papaya as compared to a 
control treatment in which soil water con￾tent was maintained at field capacity. The 
most sensitive variable in the dry-down ex￾periment was found to be gs
, which was 
used to select a soil water potential target of 
−30 kPa for subsequent priming treatments. 
Priming treatments using this predeter￾mined target resulted in increased A and 
leaf chlorophyll index (SPAD) during the 
period when irrigation to field capacity was 
restored. Primed plants had increased fluor￾escence performance indices, reduced an￾tennae size per PS II reaction centre, and 
increased fluxes and efficiencies from plas￾toquinone A through photosystem I (PS I). 
Increased A as a result of priming had both 
stomatal and photochemical components, 
however, increased A due to priming of pa￾paya appeared to be temporary. The results 
suggest that papaya has the capacity to 
reach a primed state and provide the soil 
water potential levels that could be utilized 
to achieve the appropriate level of water 
deficit for priming. In another experiment, 
Vincent et al. (2017) tested the duration 
of the PA effect when papaya plants were 
challenged with severe drought stress. Pot￾ted plants were stressed at 1, 2 and 3 months 
after conclusion of a PA treatment consist￾ing of 3 weeks at soil water tension (SWT) 
of −20 kPa. PA did not reduce net CO2
 as￾similation. The results showed that after 
the PA period, total dry matter accumula￾tion per plant for each organ was un￾affected, but proportional dry matter parti￾tioning to the roots was stimulated. After 
resuming full irrigation, A increased and 
whole plant water use was more than doubled 
in PA-treated plants. However, water use 
and A of PA-treated plants decreased rela￾tive to those of control plants by 6 weeks 
after PA treatment. Over the course of the 
study, PA plants maintained lower stem 
height to stem diameter ratios, and shorter 
internode length. However, these changes 
did not improve photosynthetic response 
to any of the water deficit treatments. Vin￾cent et al. (2017) concluded that papaya ex￾hibits some signs of stress memory, but 
that rapid short-term acclimatization re￾sponses dominate papaya responses to soil 
water deficit.

6 μmol CO2
 m-2 s-1 in cultivar ‘Maradol’ and 
in the wild genotype. The photosynthetic 
rate of both genotypes progressively de￾creased reaching values of 1.7 μmol CO2
m-2 s-1 after 14 days under water deficit 
stress. Similar results were obtained in 
other papaya genotypes (Mahouachi et al., 
2006). The decrease in the rate of photo￾synthesis of both genotypes suggests dam￾age in the photosynthetic apparatus due to 
water deficit. However, once the plants 
were re-watered, the photosynthesis values 
increased again for the wild genotype and 
‘Maradol’ reaching at day 21, values of 
6 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 and 4 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1, 
respectively.
It has been widely documented that a 
water deficit stress limits the rate of photo￾synthesis through stomata closure (Chaves, 
1991; Cornic, 2000) and by a deterioration 
in metabolism (Boyer, 1976; Flexas and 
Medrano, 2002; Lawlor and Cornic, 2002). 
When plants are exposed to water deficit 
stress, the rate of photosynthesis may or may 
not return to previous levels, depending on 
the genetic material, severity and duration 
of stress and relative humidity. In this way, 
the plants that return to the same rate of 
photosynthesis that they had before the 
stress occurred have a greater tolerance to 
the water deficit (Kozlowski and Pallardy, 
1997). Detrimental effects of water deficit 
stress on the photosynthetic apparatus can 
last days, weeks or even months; therefore, 
the ability of stressed plants to recover their 
photosynthetic capacity may be associated 
with the ability of stomata to partially or fully 
reopen and for protein synthesis to overcome 
the damage suffered by the photosynthetic 
apparatus (Kozlowski and Pallardy, 1997; 
Pompelli et al., 2010).
8.7 Stomatal Conductance
The limitation of plant growth in response to 
water deficit stress is due to reductions in the 
carbon balance in the plant, which greatly af￾fects photosynthesis (Flexas et al., 2009). 
However, there is a debate about whether the 
restrictive factor for photosynthesis during 
water deficit stress is stomatal closure or is 
due to incomplete metabolism (Flexas and 
Medrano, 2002; Lawlor and Cornic, 2002; 
Flexas et al., 2009; Pinheiro and Chaves, 
2011). A decrease in the diffusion of atmos￾pheric CO2
 to the carboxylation site in the 
leaves is considered to be the main cause in 
the decrease of photosynthesis under condi￾tions of water stress (Flexas et al., 2004; Grassi 
and Magnani, 2005; Chaves et al., 2009). 
However, when a decrease in gs
 is combined 
with strong radiation, the leaves are exposed 
to an excess of energy and low availability of 
intercellular CO2
 due to its consumption dur￾ing the Calvin cycle (Pinheiro and Chaves, 
2011). Under these conditions, low regula￾tion and even photoinhibition of photosyn￾thesis can become a potent defence mechan￾ism in C3
 plants (Demmig-Adams et al., 2006).
Plants experiencing little water stress 
may maintain higher stomatal conductance 
during cloud cover than plants under more 
severe water stress (Knapp and Smith, 1988). 
Plants with large leaves may maintain more 
favourable water balance on days with broken 
cloud cover than during a cloudless day 
(Knapp and Smith, 1989). Container-grown 
drought-stressed ‘Tainung#1’ papaya plants 
show declined gs
 to a greater magnitude fol￾lowing high (1600 μmol m-2 s-1) to low (250 
μmol m-2 s-1) photosynthetic photon flux 
(PPF) transition, and gs
 and net CO2
 assimi￾lation recovered slowly following the tran￾sition from low-to-high PPF than for 
well-watered plants (Clemente and Marler, 
1996). Water use efficiency declined to a 
minimum following the high-to-low PPF 
transition but recovered rapidly in drought￾stressed plants, which indicates that papaya 
stomata are able to track rapid changes in ir￾radiance, and mild drought stress enhances 
the tracking response (Clemente and Marler, 
1996). The influence of drought stress on 
gas exchange is, however, highly dependent 
on time of day, ambient sky condition, plant 
size, and speed with which drought stress 
occurs (Marler and Mickelbart, 1998).
The stomatal conductance for well￾watered wild and ‘Maradol’ papaya geno￾types had values of around 250 mmol H2
O 
m-2 s-1. When plants were exposed to water 
deficit stress, gs
 decreased as the exposure

to water stress increased, reaching the low￾est values at day 14 for both genotypes, with 
a value of around 2 mmol H2
O m-2 s-1. One 
day after recovery, the wild genotype in￾creased the values (50 mmol H2
O m-2 s-1), 
while ‘Maradol’ progressively increased the 
gs
 levels after 7 days of re-watering until 
reaching a value of 170 mmol H2
O m-2 s-1 at 
day 21, significantly lower than 250 mmol 
H2
O m-2 s-1 showed by the wild genotype. 
The decrease in the stomatal conductance 
rate is related to the loss of turgidity but also 
to the increase in the concentration of ab￾scisic acid (ABA), which accumulates in the 
apoplast surrounding the epidermal cells of 
the leaf. The saved cells recognize ABA and 
respond by closing stomata (Cowing et al., 
1993; Liang et al., 1997). Stomatal regulation 
is one of the physiological ways that pa￾paya plants respond to water deficit stress, 
and this regulation seems to be more effi￾cient in the wild papaya population, which al￾lows the plants to tolerate water stress and 
continue with the photosynthetic pro￾cesses (Girón, 2015).
8.8 Intercellular CO2
The intercellular CO2
 (Ci
) parameter was 
evaluated for cultivar ‘Maradol’ and in the 
wild genotype with values of 270 μmol CO2
mol-1 and 300 μmol CO2
 mol-1 under well￾irrigated conditions, respectively (Table 8.3). 
After 14 days under water deficit stress, the 
lowest values were obtained in ‘Maradol’ 
(30 μmol CO2
 mol-1) compared with the 
wild type (100 μmol CO2
 mol-1). After 1 day 
of re-watering, the wild type responded rap￾idly, increasing the Ci
 rate until reaching the 
initial values at day 21. On the other hand, 
‘Maradol’ increased the Ci
 rate more slowly 
and after 7 days of re-watering reached val￾ues similar to those recorded for wild plants 
(270 μmol CO2
 mol-1). The rapid response 
by the wild papaya type have a better use 
in the fixation of CO2
 in the plant, which is 
reflected in its ability to restore photosyn￾thesis values (Table 8.3). Stomatal conduct￾ance provides information on the opening of 
stomata, which controls the leaf’s fundamental 
internal processes for plant development 
such as the exchange of CO2
 required for 
photosynthesis and water vapour in tran￾spiration (Raschke, 1975). A decrease in the 
diffusion of atmospheric CO2
 to the site of 
carboxylation in leaves is considered the 
main cause of a decrease in photosynthesis 
under conditions of water stress (Grassi and 
Magnani, 2005; Chaves et al., 2009).
8.9 Conclusion
A common response of papaya to drought is 
to shed the oldest leaves. Plants that adapt 
to water deficits by delaying dehydration 
do so by reducing water loss, maintaining 
water uptake or by osmotic adjustment. 
Papaya can tolerate some water deficit with￾out significant reduction in yield compo￾nents, indicating that the full amount of the

recommended irrigation can be reduced but 
there is little or no benefit to partial root 
drying. Experimental evidence suggests that 
papaya plants exhibit some signs of stress 
memory, but that rapid short-term acclima￾tization responses dominate papaya’s response 
to soil water deficit.
Decreased plant growth under water def￾icit is due to reductions in the carbon balance 
in the plant which affects photosynthesis. 
However, it is still not clear whether the 
restrictive factor for photosynthesis under 
water deficit stress is due to stomatal closure 
or is due to incomplete metabolism.

9.1 Introduction
Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is a large herb￾aceous plant, reaching up to 9 m in height 
(Malo and Campbell, 1986). The stem is semi￾woody since lignin accumulation in the cell 
wall is at an intermediate level between 
Arabidopsis and poplar (Ming et al., 2008). 
It is generally considered to have originated 
from tropical America (including tropical 
terrestrial ecoregions of the Americas and 
the entire South American temperate zone), 
then spread throughout tropical and sub￾tropical regions (Carr, 2014). The plant is 
short lived with a rapid growth rate, able to 
produce fruit throughout the year and for up 
to 3 or 4 years. The tree is typically single 
stemmed, although branching can occur if 
the apex is removed (Marler et al., 1994). The 
fruit is rich in vitamin A and C, as well as 
calcium, which has made it popular for human 
consumption. In addition, unripe papaya is 
a good source of papain, which is an endo￾lytic plant cysteine protease enzyme, and 
plays a crucial role in many vital biological 
processes in all living organisms (Tsuge et al., 
1999; Mamboya, 2012). Due to its high prod￾uctivity, nutritional value and functionality, 
papaya has become an important commer￾cial fruit crop worldwide.
The optimum growing conditions for 
papaya are temperatures from 21°C to 33°C, 
in well-drained porous soils which are wet on 
hot days but dry in cold weather (Nakasone 
and Paull, 1998). Papaya prefers full sun￾light and high light intensity, with low light 
intensity resulting in significant alterations 
in the leaf anatomy and morphology leading 
to reduced photosynthesis efficiency, prod￾uctivity and fruit quality. Also, sex reversal 
may occur in papaya flowers exposed to high 
temperatures and water shortage, while low 
temperature and high soil moisture may lead 
to growth disorders and misshaped fruit. The 
purpose of this chapter is to present the po￾tential effects from a range of environmental 
factors on papaya development including 
on photosynthesis, productivity and whole 
plant physiology.
9.2 Physiology of Papaya
Understanding how environmental factors 
interact with physiological processes is vital 
for ensuring economically sustainable pro￾duction. Under suitable conditions of light 
intensity and quality, air temperature, water 
availability, soil humidity and oxygen, papaya 
seeds start epigeal germination, and finish

emergence within 2 to 3 weeks. After that, 
leaves start to emerge at the apex of the plant; 
this lasts for between 3 and 6 months in 
tropical environments. The sustained emer￾gence of new leaves at the apex with loss of 
leaves on the lower section of the plant forms 
an umbrella shape at the apex, casting a great 
amount of shade (Jiménez et al., 2014). It 
usually takes from 3 to 8 months for papaya 
to develop from seed germination to flowering, 
and from 9 to 15 months for seed-to-seed 
generation (Paterson et al., 2008). Papaya 
requires high amounts of mineral nutrients. 
Under full sunlight conditions, potassium 
followed by nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, 
sulfur and magnesium are the major macro￾nutrients required (Jiménez et al., 2014).
9.2.1 Seed germination
The issue of poor and/or limited seed produc￾tion from hybrid papaya cultivars is a ser￾ious problem, because hybrid cultivar seed 
must be produced under controlled condi￾tions, which is hard to achieve in the field 
(Nishina et al., 2004). To recover the required 
good-quality recombinants, it is essential to 
enhance the germination percentage, sur￾vival and viability of the hybrid seed (Bhat￾tacharya and Khuspe, 2001). Papaya seed is 
categorized by seed storage behaviour as 
‘intermediate’ between orthodox and recal￾citrant (Ellis et al., 1991), in which drying 
and cooling increase longevity but only at a 
defined treatment. Papaya seed with a mois￾ture content of approximately 10% stored at 
15°C had increased seed longevity compared 
with further drying and storage at 0°C or 
-20°C treatment (Ellis et al., 1991). Charac￾teristics of papaya seeds change with fruit 
maturity. The best seed for germination and 
the production of healthy seedlings is ob￾tained from ripe and overripe fruits (Sanga￾kkara, 1995).
The effects of several environmental fac￾tors, including temperature, light and gibber￾ellic acid (GA3
), have been evaluated for 
their potential effect on papaya seed ger￾mination. Bhattacharya and Khuspe (2001) 
compared factors which may influence seed 
germination under in vivo and in vitro culture 
environments. The comprehensive study as￾sessed intact seeds, naked embryos, halved 
seeds and halved embryos of ten widely 
cultivated papaya cultivars. One group of 
seeds were sealed with ‘Parafilm’ in the dishes 
and placed under light (16 h photoperiod 
under warm white tubular fluorescent 
lamps at 25 μmol m-2 s-1), and another group 
were wrapped with silver foil in the dishes 
and placed in a dark incubator. The conclu￾sion was that generally, the seed does not 
require light for germination but that when 
available, light hastens the germination pro￾cess. The influence of temperature on seed 
germination was also examined. Temperat￾ures of 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C and 40°C 
were assessed and found to strongly affect 
germination. Most germination occurred be￾tween 20°C and 30°C, confirming the previ￾ous findings of Yahiro and Hayashi (1982).
Beside the effects of temperature and 
light, GA3
 treatment was also found to be 
important in papaya seed germination since 
papaya seed is enclosed in a gelatinous sar￾cotesta (aril or outer seedcoat) which can 
delay germination and result in seed dormancy 
(Yahiro and Oryoji, 1980; Andreoli and Khan, 
1993). Several methods have been tested to 
overcome dormancy, such as removing the 
sarcotesta, pre-soaking seeds in distilled water 
(Pérez et al., 1980) and water leaching, which 
promotes Carica spp. germination (Riley, 
1981). The reported effect of GA3
 treatment 
in breaking seed dormancy has varied from 
positive (Lange, 1961; Yahiro, 1979; Riley, 
1981; Andreoli and Khan, 1993), to none 
(Ramirez, 1961; Chacko and Singh, 1966; 
Begum et al., 1998). To elucidate this further, 
Salomão and Mundim (2000) evaluated the 
effect of GA3
 treatment on seed that had been 
dehydrated at 25°C and then exposed to -20°C 
and -196°C. Consequently, GA3
 treatment was 
found to increase the germination rate in all 
treatments and be effective in breaking seed 
dormancy and promoting germination regard￾less of seed moisture content.
9.2.2 Flowering and fruiting
Papaya can be either dioecious (with male 
and female plants) or gynodioecious (with

hermaphrodite and female plants) (Jiménez 
et al., 2014). Female plants need wind and insects 
for pollination, while hermaphroditic plants 
can self-pollinate. Although several studies 
have reported sex conversion in hermaphro￾dite flowers ranging from totally perfect to 
totally sterile due to the effects of environ￾mental factors, the presence of hermaphro￾dite trees is sought in commercial orchards.
High temperatures and water stress ex￾acerbate female sterility, which may result in 
totally infertile (staminate) and unproductive in￾florescences (Awada and Ikeda, 1957; Arkle 
and Nakasone, 1984; Almeida et al., 2003). On 
the other hand, low temperatures and high soil 
moisture leads to the production of pistillate 
flowers, which are disordered and bear mis￾shapen fruits (Awada and Ikeda, 1953, 1957; 
Awada, 1958). Contrary to hermaphrodite 
flowers, female flowers are stable and will not 
experience sexual reversal during environmen￾tal fluctuations (Awada and Ikeda, 1957).
The shape of fruit from hermaphrodite 
plants is elongated, while female plants bear 
round-shaped fruit. The maturation of fruit 
happens 4–6 months after flowering. At this 
stage, carbon gain from fruit photosynthesis 
is small, while the main character of fruit 
photosynthesis is the refixing of respiratory 
CO2
 released in the fruit interior. During fruit 
ripening, the colour, flesh firmness, carbohy￾drate composition and production of second￾ary compounds are changed. The colour of ripe 
fruit varies from yellow to salmon red, attribut￾able to the carotenoids, including lycopene and 
β-cryptoxanthin (Schweiggert et al., 2011a, 
b). Around 160 volatile compounds were 
identified to contribute to papaya aroma (Pino 
et al., 2003). Among these, methyl butanoate, 
ethyl butanoate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 1-bu￾tanol are the main components that contribute 
to a favourable sweet aroma, and the esters of 
lower fatty acids are considered responsible 
for the flavour profile (Pino et al., 2003).
9.3 Effect of Light Intensity on Growth 
and Development
Light at wavelengths between 400 nm and 
700 nm is the range of photosynthetically 
active radiation (PAR, mol photons m-2 s-1), 
which initiates photosynthesis of plants 
(McCree, 1981). Wavelength and intensity dra￾matically influence the leaf photosynthetic cap￾acity of the developing canopy of erect 
herbaceous plants (Wang et al., 2014). As pa￾paya is a light-demanding plant, prolonged low 
light intensity can cause significant alterations 
in leaf anatomy and morphology, affecting 
photosynthetic activity (Buisson and Lee, 1993).
Early in 1993, Buisson and Lee assessed 
the effects of light intensity on papaya leaf 
development by comparing the morphology, 
anatomy and pigment composition of plants 
grown in high sunlight (HL) conditions (0.20 
μmol m–2 sec–1 400–700 nm of sunlight and 
red (R) to far red (FR) radiation ratio (R:FR) 
= 0.90) with those grown in low sunlight 
(0.02 μmol m–2 sec–1 400–700 nm of sunlight). 
The low sunlight experiment was con￾ducted using either shade fabrics to reduce 
irradiance but no spectral alteration (neu￾tral shade, or NS) or under reduced irradi￾ance and reduced R:FR (filtered shade: FS). 
This was achieved by spraying a clear 
greenhouse plastic cover with an experi￾mental spray paint designed to reduce R:FR 
to ratios experienced under forest canopies 
(Lee 1985, 1988). Based on their results, 
leaves of plants grown in low sunlight were 
thinner with reduced specific leaf weight 
than those grown under HL. The reductions 
of cell length and leaf thickness were also 
observed for plants grown under the shade 
treatments. These reductions were correl￾ated with palisade mesophyll cell shape. In 
the HL treatment, palisade mesophyll cells 
were long and columnar, while in the shade 
treatments, these cells were corn shaped 
(Buisson and Lee, 1993). In leaf transverse 
sections, the narrower palisade cells in HL 
treatment leaves were associated with nar￾row air spaces between the cells and had 
larger spaces beneath, resulting in a larger 
mesophyll air space surface to leaf surface 
ratio. This was positively correlated with 
gas exchange and photosynthetic activity. Al￾though leaves grown under shade treatments 
had lower mesophyll air surface to leaf sur￾face ratios, higher chlorophyll contents per 
unit leaf area were detected, which may 
promote total light absorption (Buisson and 
Lee, 1993). This indicated the acclimatization

potential of papaya to a wide range of light 
environments.
Wang et al. (2014) also determined that 
reduction of light intensity can decrease the 
efficiency of photosynthesis for papaya 
through examining the distribution of max￾imum net CO2
 assimilation in saturated light 
(ACO2
) versus photosynthetic photon flux 
densities (PPFD). In their study, leaf area 
index (LAI) was used as a light interception 
and transpiration measurement to establish 
the basis of canopy photosynthetic efficiency 
(Faust, 1989). The study found that leaves 
located in the centre part of the papaya canopy 
(the 11th to the 29th leaf below the apex) 
were exposed to the maximum amount of 
PPFD, could generate a LAI of 0.3–1.4 m2
 m-2
and were able to maintain around 90% of the 
maximum ACO2
. Leaves on the lower part 
(the 35th to the 45th leaf below the apex), 
where the light intensity was very low and 
leaves were almost completely shaded, had 
much lower ACO2
. Upper located leaves had 
a higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn) because 
of more light received. Wang et al. (2014) 
revealed that papaya leaf productivity de￾pends on the relationship between the LAI, the 
photosynthetic capacity and the light inter￾ception. To maximize the light effect on papaya 
growth, it was found feasible to remove leaves 
located in the lower part of the canopy to lessen 
the number of sinks and reduce transpiration. 
Accordingly, the plant water uptake dropped, 
and the transpiration and mineral nutrient 
was allocated to the upper leaves, which im￾proved the efficiency of light intensity on the 
photosynthetic process (Wang et al., 2014).
Commercial papaya cultivation has his￾torically been limited to tropical and subtropical 
regions, with optimum growing temperatures 
between 21°C and 33°C (Yadava et al., 
1990; Salinas et al., 2019). However, in recent 
years, papaya cultivation has expanded to 
cooler climates, such as those experienced in 
parts of Spain, Israel, Argentina, Australia 
and Japan (Drew et al., 2006; Galán Saúco 
and Rodríguez Pastor, 2007; Campostrini 
et al., 2018). Under such conditions, pro￾tective structures which allow better light 
distribution within the canopy are required 
to optimize photosynthesis and enhance 
plant growth as well as development.
In most plantations, papaya is planted 
in greenhouses covered either by mesh or 
polyethylene film or leaves are covered with 
particle films (Fig. 9.1: Glenn and Puterka, 
2005; Galán Saúco and Rodríguez Pastor, 
2007; Sharma et al., 2015). These are imple￾mented to adjust the amount of light absorbed, 
which is especially important for papaya grown 
in low water-availability locations where the 
net ACO2
 is reduced (Marler and Mickelbart, 
1998). Since particle films increase excess 
reflection of light energy, they protect the 
leaves from photochemical damage.
9.4 Photosynthesis and Fruit Quality
Papaya is classified as a C3 metabolism plant 
with characteristic C3 leaf anatomy (Marler 
and Mickelbart, 1998; Campostrini and Glenn, 
2007; Jeyakumar et al., 2007). The maximum 
net carbon assimilation (‘A’) rates for leaf￾level photosynthesis of C3 plants are reached 
at 2000 μmol m-2 s-1 PPFD when the light 
compensation point is 25–30 μmol m-2 s-1
(Marler and Mickelbart, 1998; Campostrini 
and Yamanishi, 2001; Jiménez et al., 2014). 
The net efficiency of carbon assimilation can 
be reduced by 25–30% during photorespir￾ation in a C3 plant (Lawlor, 1993), which 
may be improved under well-watered and 
PPFD-saturating conditions in papaya plant￾ations (Campostrini and Glenn, 2007). Vari￾ation of ‘A’ rates in papaya were observed 
among genotypes. Campostrini et al. (2001) 
compared the leaf gas exchange characteris￾tics among four papaya genotypes (‘Sunrise 
Solo TJ’, ‘Sunrise Solo 72/12’, ‘Baixinho de 
Santa Amália’ and ‘Know-You No. 1’), and 
found the highest ‘A’ rates were observed 
in cultivar ‘Baixinho de Santa Amália’ at 
25 μmol m-2 s-1, while only 20 μmol m-2 s-1 was ob￾served for the others. In addition, the ‘A’ rate 
may be affected by environmental factors. 
Jeyakumar et al. (2007) pointed out that the 
direct action of radiant energy on leaf heat￾ing decreased the stomatal conductance (gs
), 
which resulted in the reduction of photo￾synthesis at high PPFD after reaching the 
light saturation level. Chronic photoinhibi￾tion also reduced ‘A’ rates at high PPFD 
levels through damage and replacement of

the D1 protein in the reaction centre of photo￾system II (PS II) (Critchley, 1998; Jiménez 
et al., 2014). Lastly, root restriction will also 
lead to a feedback inhibition of photosyn￾thesis (Campostrini and Yamanishi, 2001).
Stomata are important in linking papaya 
photosynthetic responses to environmental 
conditions. Stomatal opening and closing 
changes the partial pressure of CO2
 at the sites 
of carboxylation. Consequently, the rate of 
transpiration, which eventually changes 
the temperature and water potential of the 
leaf (Farquhar and Sharkey, 1982) is affected. 
Simultaneously, the leaf-to-air vapour pres￾sure deficit (VPD leaf-to-air) affects the stomata 
movement associated with water loss directly 
from guard cells. High VPD leaf-to-air causes 
stomatal closure, thus leading to the reduc￾tion of gs
 and ‘A’ rates (de Oliveira Reis et al., 
2006). Papaya has stomata only in the leaf 
abaxial surface (El-Sharkawy et al., 1985). 
El-Sharkawy et al. (1985) found that the 
stomatal conductance and net rate of photo￾synthesis in papaya decreased by 48% when 
VPD leaf-to-air changed from 1–1.5 kPa to 
3.5–4.5 kPa. Marler and Mickelbart (1998) 
also pointed out that papaya gain less daily 
carbon on sunny days than on overcast days 
because of the higher VPD. Midday depres￾sion of photosynthesis (MDP) was also ob￾served in papaya, which happens when the 
increasing PPFD on leaf surfaces increases 
the temperature of leaf and air, which results 
in a decreased gs
 and increased VPD (Cam￾postrini and Glenn, 2007). MDP is thought to 
assist in avoiding cell drought stress under 
environmental pressures (Maroco et al., 1997; 
Franks and Farquhar, 1999) through redu￾cing excessive water loss under dry situations 
with intense sunlight and enhancing water 
use efficiency (WUE). In addition, the re￾sponses of papaya to VPD vary between dif￾ferent genotypes. Torres Netto et al. (2009) 
compared the photosynthetic performance

of five papaya cultivars (‘Golden’, ‘Sunrise 
Solo 7212’, ‘Tainung’, ‘Formosa’ and hybrid 
‘UENF-Caliman’) at midday. Of these, ‘Golden’ 
presented the highest gs
 related to VPD, 
which resulted in higher transpiration rates 
and intrinsic WUE. This effect may have 
been due to the pale green colouring of the 
‘Golden’ leaf, which significantly increased 
the leaf reflectance and decreased leaf tem￾perature (Campostrini and Glenn, 2007).
Papaya fruit quality traits are directly 
related to photosynthetic capacity of the 
plant. Phenotypes with large leaf areas may 
enhance plant photosynthetic capacity and 
gain higher fruit total soluble solids (TSS) 
levels under a given fruit load (Zhou et al., 
2000). Meanwhile, the rate of leaf photosyn￾thesis has been found to increase in defoliated 
papaya plants. Zhou et al. (2000) discovered 
that defoliation by approximately 75% sig￾nificantly reduced new flower production 
and fruit set and decreased ripe fruit TSS, 
while 50% defoliation did not reduce new 
fruit set or ripe fruit TSS. They also pointed 
out that if the photosynthetic capacity is not 
able to reach the requirement of a reduced 
sink (fewer and smaller fruit), final fruit 
TSS (sugar) is decreased.
9.5 Environmental Effects 
on Productivity
Crop productivity is defined by the yield 
of useful product per unit land area when 
taking the efficiency of yield inputs into 
consideration (Olubode et al., 2016). The 
production of papaya worldwide for the 
past 20 years has steadily increased, mainly 
because of increased production in India 
and demand by the USA (Evans and Ballen, 
2012), reaching a peak in 2016 (13.09 mil￾lion t). In 2017, 61.1% of the world’s total 
papaya production was focused in three 
countries, India (134 thousand ha and 5.94 
million t), Brazil (26 thousand ha and 1.057 
million t) and Mexico (16.67 thousand ha 
and 0.96 million t) (FAOSTAT, 2017). In 
terms of productivity, the Dominican Re￾public, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Mexico, 
India, China and Brazil had the highest fruit 
production with 281.6 t ha-1, 92.1 t ha-1, 60.0 
t ha-1, 57.7 t ha-1, 44.3 t ha-1, 43.2 t ha-1 and 
39.9 t ha-1, respectively. Although the pro￾duction of papaya is quite high, the growing 
demand for fruit in domestic and export 
trade markets has driven the increase in cul￾tivation. Thus, it is necessary to understand 
the impacts of environmental factors such 
as light, temperature, wind and water on 
papaya productivity, which provides a sci￾entific basis for the development of manage￾ment strategies to enhance fruit yield and 
quality (Schaffer and Andersen, 1994).
9.5.1 Temperature effects on productivity
Many hermaphrodite plants are found to bear 
distorted (carpellodic) flowers in cooler wea￾ther (Saúco et al., 2014), a trait previously 
predicted to be associated with seasonal 
factors such as temperature (Awada, 1958; 
Jiménez et al., 2014). Days with optimal di￾urnal ranges of 25–30°C day and 11–16°C 
night temperatures are required for optimal 
fruit production (Allan et al., 1987).
Awada (1958) compared papaya cultivar 
‘Solo’ grown at three different elevations 
(Honolulu at 30.48 m (100 ft), Kainaliu at 
457.20 m (1500 ft) and Makawao at 640.08 
m (2100 ft)). For each location, the mean 
temperatures were optimal, ranging between 
15°C and 27°C, while the mean minimum 
and maximum temperatures of each loca￾tion decreased with increasing altitude. The 
percentages of types of flowers and fruits 
were recorded over 1 year. Hermaphrodite 
trees can produce four different types of 
flowers: (i) type 4+; (ii) type 4; (iii) type 3; 
and (iv) type 2 (Fig. 9.2). Of these, type 4 is 
the preferred type with ten functional sta￾mens and bearing ‘Solo’-type fruit. Type 4+ 
lacks a functional pistil and is the most 
staminate type of hermaphrodite flower. 
Opposite to type 4+, type 2 is the least stam￾inate and most pistillate type, it only has 
five functional stamens and fruit become 
carpellodic. Type 3 is intermediate between 
type 2 and type 4, with six to nine functional 
stamens and fruit are also carpellodic. From 
this study, flowers and fruits produced by

plants grown at Honolulu were mostly type 
4 flowers and produced ‘Solo’-type fruit. On 
the other hand, most of the trees planted at 
higher altitudes produced carpellodic-type 
fruit. The mean minimum temperature at 
Honolulu was around 10° higher than at 
Kainaliu and Makawao, but the day lengths 
were the same. The conclusion was that the 
carpellodic disorder occurs mainly at low 
temperatures and high moisture levels caus￾ing severely deformed and unsaleable fruit 
(Awada, 1958; Ramos et al., 2011).
Meanwhile, high temperature can lead 
to sex reversal in papaya whereby hermaph￾rodite flowers may convert to staminate flowers 
and produce no fruit (Hofmeyr, 1939; Arkle 
Jr and Nakasone, 1984). However, the mo￾lecular mechanism of this environmental 
control in papaya sexual phenotype expres￾sion has not yet been studied, but it is very 
likely to be regulated by epigenetic mechan￾isms, because plants interact with the envir￾onment through DNA modification or small 
RNA expression (Aryal and Ming, 2014). The 
sex determination of papaya is regulated by 
a pair of recently evolved sex chromosomes 
(Ming et al., 2007; Aryal, 2013). Epigenetic 
regulation of sex determination happens at 
the transcriptional level by modifying gen￾omic loci in males and females, or at the 
post-transcriptional level by RNA-mediated 
regulation, and this then changes the sexual 
phenotypes of flowers (Aryal and Ming, 
2014). Epigenetic regulation of sex expres￾sion has been observed in many species such 
as maize, Silene latifolia and melon, but not 
in papaya so far (Janoušek et al., 1996; 
Hultquist and Dorweiler, 2008; Martin et al., 
2009). The exploration of epigenetic status 
in papaya with environmentally labile sex 
expression may have significant meaning in 
understanding the evolution of sex deter￾mination of papaya.
Moreover, Allan et al. (1987) grew male 
and female papaya plants within controlled￾temperature greenhouses. Under extreme 
heat (36°C/28°C), plants grew rapidly but the 
pollen viability was very low, while under 
extreme cool (20°C/12°C), fruit development 
took longer to occur. Furthermore, tempera￾ture strongly affects papaya seed germination. 
Previous studies have shown that none of the 
cultivars can germinate at temperatures below 
15°C or above 40°C (Yahiro and Hayashi, 
1982; Bhattacharya and Khuspe, 2001).
9.5.2 Wind effects on productivity
Wind exposure reduces plant growth and 
yield of many horticultural crops via dir￾ectly damaging plant leaves and affecting 
leaf gas exchange or through mechanically 
induced stress (Waister, 1972; Clemente and 
Marler, 2001; Marler and Clemente, 2006).

Meanwhile, papaya is grown throughout 
the equatorial regions where chronic trade 
winds occur throughout the whole year (Marler, 
2011). Papaya seedlings are sensitive to 
wind, and the mature trees are vulnerable to 
wind damage, especially when bearing large 
amounts of fruit and in wet soil (Carr, 2014). 
In addition, the effects of wind on plants may 
differ with duration and velocity (Nobel, 
1981). Clemente and Marler (2001) con￾ducted four experiments in Guam, to test 
the influence of trade winds on growth and 
gas exchange in papaya seedlings of three 
papaya cultivars (‘Known You No. 1’, ‘Sun￾rise’ and ‘Tainung 2’). Plants were exposed 
to three levels of wind for 3 weeks: (i) 0% 
(fully protected by using a polypropylene 
sheet); (ii) 36% (by covering the structure 
with fabric screen); or (iii) 100% (fully ex￾posed to the ambient wind). The wind was 
constant and from one direction with an 
average speed of 4.86 m s-1. Consequently, 
wind exposure lowered the stem height and 
leaf or stem dry weight, but had little influ￾ence on root growth. Also, a decrease of net 
CO2
 assimilation at midday and increase of 
dark respiration were observed, which may 
reduce overall productivity (Clemente and 
Marler, 2001).
In 2006, additional studies were done 
by Marler and Clemente to evaluate papaya 
plant responses to wind at speeds ranging 
from 0 m s-1 to 2.5 m s-1. With increasing wind 
speed, the rate of dry mass gain by papaya 
seedlings decreased continuously from an 
average of 1900 mg to 900 mg per plant 
(Marler and Clemente, 2006) demonstrating 
significant phenotypic plasticity in response 
to environmental heterogeneity. Marler (2011) 
carried out an in-depth study to quantify 
the growth responses of papaya roots, leaves 
and stems under ambient winds to contrast 
speed and degree of the plasticity among the 
organs. This study confirmed that responses 
of young papaya plants to wind exposure 
are fast. Stem height decreased significantly 
after only 1 week of exposure to wind and 
both stem and root tip density were reduced 
after 2 weeks. Also, adaptive responses to 
the direction of the winds was observed in 
the root tips and stem diameter measures, 
both of which increased on the windward 
side after 3 weeks of wind exposure 
(Marler, 2011).
In conclusion, strong ambient wind ex￾posure reduced stem and leaf expansion rates 
of papaya seedlings, decreased the photo￾synthesis efficiency by lowering the ACO2
rate at midday, and enhanced evapotrans￾piration rate at night to reduce growth. 
Moreover, the rapid adaptive responses of 
young papaya trees to wind differed, poten￾tially indicating that avoidance strategies 
are enacted that may be useful in minimizing 
impacts within orchards in windy locations 
(Marler, 2011; Carr, 2014).
9.5.3 Water effects on productivity
Water availability and WUE directly impacts 
crop development and productivity through 
influencing growth rate and resource alloca￾tion (Nilsen and Orcutt, 1996). Water shortage 
due to changes in climate is an increasing, 
crucial problem threatening the global pa￾paya industry. Moderate to severe water 
stress will not only decrease papaya pro￾duction through restraining the growth of 
stem and leaves, but also trigger the produc￾tion of sterile flowers (Lima et al., 2016). 
Although papaya is generally considered to 
be a drought-tolerant crop, when papaya trees 
are undergoing a shortage of water supply, 
the leaf area drops, the size of fruit declines 
and the new flower internodes are condensed 
(Carr, 2014; Lima et al., 2016). Additional 
effects of water on papaya growth, compos￾ition of sugar content, yield and sex expres￾sion were observed by Awada and Ikeda 
(1957) at the Hawaii Agricultural Experi￾ment Station at Poamoho, Oahu using two 
levels of irrigation treatments. Plants under a 
high level of irrigation generally grew faster 
than those under low level irrigation, meas￾ured according to the partial regression 
coefficients of trunk elongation. The fruit 
from the high irrigation plots were heavier 
and sugar concentrations in the petioles and 
fruit were negatively correlated with the water 
amount gained by the plants. In addition, 
high irrigation level was correlated with in￾creased nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus 
and moisture in the leaves. Meanwhile, low 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditions138 Z. Zhou et al.
level irrigation was correlated with decreased 
magnesium and calcium concentrations. 
Also, although the yield of hermaphrodite 
fruits was greater from plants grown with 
more water, this also correlated with higher 
frequencies of type 2 and type 3 fruit (Fig. 9.3), 
which were misshaped and unmarketable, 
while the yields of type 4 (‘Solo’) fruits were 
considerably higher with the lower water 
level. This indicates that sex expression of 
papaya is affected by water availability but 
this requires a deeper investigation to deter￾mine cause and effect. Besides, waterlogging 
is a common reason leading to papaya trees 
failing to fruit or even die (Storey, 1972). In 
waterlogged soil, it is hard for the plant roots 
to gain enough oxygen through soil pores, as 
well as the mineral nutrients, which result in 
a low growth rate or even growth being stopped 
(Setter and Belford, 1990). Overwatering can 
reduce the papaya growth rate, photosynthesis 
efficiency and plant productivity, while flood￾ing for 48 h is fatal (Khondaker and Ozawa, 
2007; Zhang et al., 2011).
Finally, Almeida et al. (2003) conducted 
a study to determine papaya productivity 
under a range of irrigation levels. For this, 
cultivar ‘Improved Sunrise Soil 72/12’ was 
planted in a fluvial-origin Cambisol with low 
fertility and moderate drainage at Campos dos 
Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (21°45′15′′S, 
41°19′28′′W), and irrigation was applied at 
seven water levels (0%, 40%, 80%, 120%, 
160%, 200% and 240% of the percentage of 
evapotranspiration (ET0
), respectively). After 
evaluating growth rate and yield parameters, 
height of the tree, stem diameter and mean 
productivity obtained were found to in￾crease with increasing water levels peaking at 
160% ET0
. In this study, a 2937 mm water 
depth contributed to the largest fruit yield, 
which corresponded to increased growth 
parameters as determined in previous stud￾ies (Awada and Ikeda, 1957; Srinivas, 1996). 
This strongly indicates that papaya growers 
should adhere to appropriate irrigation 
management for optimal productivity.
9.6 Summary and Future Direction
Papaya growth relies heavily on environmen￾tal factors, including sunlight, temperature 
and water availability. Understanding the 
interactions between environmental factors 
and papaya physiological processes are vital 
for economically sustainable production. 
Temperatures from 21°C to 33°C, well-drained 
porous soils, full sunlight and high light 
intensity contribute to high photosynthetic 
rates, carbon gain, good growth and high 
productivity. To achieve this, science-based 
management should be implemented. Tem￾peratures and light intensities can be ad￾justed through applying reflective materials 
such as shade fabrics and particle films or

using overhead cooling systems on extremely 
hot days. Suitable irrigation management 
for optimal productivity of papaya varies in 
different locations, thus more investigations 
are needed for breeders. Strong ambient wind 
exposure should be avoided for papaya 
trees, as it decreased the efficiency of photo￾synthesis. With the increasing threats to the 
global papaya industry caused by climate 
change, the expansion of knowledge of en￾vironmental factors relating to a physio￾logical response, photosynthesis rate and 
productivity of papaya will help breeders 
develop an optimal growth environment for 
papayas, thus enhancing the fruit quality 
and productivity.

10.1 Introduction
Papaya, Carica papaya L. (2n = 18), which 
originated in Central America from Mexico to 
Panama (Badillo, 1993, 2000), provides eco￾nomically important edible fruits and latex in 
tropical and subtropical areas. It has a small 
genome of 372 Mb (Arumuganathan and 
Earle, 1991; Ming et al., 2008) and a short 
generation time of 9–15 months. Papaya 
belongs to the small family Caricaceae with 
six genera and 35 species and is a dicotyle￾donous, polygamous plant (having male, 
female or hermaphrodite flowers on the same 
plant) (Figs 10.1 and 10.2). The genera in this 
family include Carica (one species), Jarilla
(three species), Horovitzia (one species), 
Jacaratia (seven species), Vasconcellea (21 
species), and Cylicomorpha (two species), 
according to Badillo (1971, 1993, 2000). In 
most areas hermaphrodite papaya fruit is 
desired for commercial production. Papaya 
grows as either dioecious or hermaphroditic 
plants in cultivated fields, with cultivars 
producing only female or hermaphroditic 
flowers. Flowers are solitary (one per flower￾ing stem) or small cymes of three individuals. 
Papaya plants are either hermaphrodite 
(flowers of both sexes), pistillate (flowers of 
female sex only) or staminate (flowers 
of  male sex only). Sometimes it is also 
called trioecious. Staminate papaya flowers 
earlier and produces male flowers in large 
numbers  on a  branched, drooping flower 
peduncle (Singh, 1990). Male flowers are 
funnel shaped, about 2.5 cm long, with five 
white petals joined towards the base and ten 
stamens near the opening of the tube (Singh, 
1990; Hastie, 1994). Occasionally male plants 
with bisexual flowers may produce a few, 
elongated, pear shaped, poor quality fruit 
during cooler months (Hastie, 1994). The 
female and hermaphroditic flowers are waxy 
and white and borne on short peduncles in 
leaf axils along the central stem (Fig. 10.3). 
Female flowers are pear shaped when un￾opened, borne singly or in small clusters in 
the axis of leaves. The hermaphroditic flower 
contains both male and female parts and is 
held on a much-reduced cyme in the leaf axils 
along the trunk.
In flowering plants, the strategy for floral 
sex determination is a developmentally 
regulated process that facilitates allogamy 
to support their fitness and survival (Knopf 
and Trebitsh, 2006). Sex determination has 
been studied in several flowering plants 
(Dellaporta and Calderon-Urrea, 1993; Pan￾nell, 2017). Sex chromosomes play a crucial 
role in sex determination in some crop plants.

Sex chromosomes have been identified in 
about 92 dioecious plant species, with ob￾servably different morphology between X 
(Z) and Y (W) (Ming et al., 2011; Kumar 
et  al., 2014; Renner, 2014; Charlesworth, 
2016). The XY sex chromosome system has 
been found in 44 out of 48 species of angio￾sperms (Ming et al., 2011; Kumar et al.,

Gschwend et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012), 
Silene latifolia (Kejnovsky and Vyskot, 2010), 
Diospyros lotus (Akagi et al., 2014), Phoenix 
dactylifera (Cherif et al., 2013), Actinidia 
rufa  ×  Actinidia chinensis (Akagi et al., 
2018). The ZW sex system in heteromorphic 
form also has been reported, with male the 
homogametic ZZ and female the heterogam￾etic ZW (female heterogamety), as in Populus
(Yin et al., 2008), Salix viminalis (Pucholt 
et al., 2015, 2017), Ginkgo biloba (Du et al., 
2016) and a wild species of allo-octoploid 
Fragaria chiloensis (Tennessen et al., 2016).
The papaya sex determination system 
is especially interesting, not only because of 
its three sex types, but also the environmental 
factors affecting its sex expression (Pannell, 
1997; Korpelainen, 1998; Adam et al., 2011). 
The complexity of the floral development 
and the large number of genes in the sex 
determination region caused difficulties in 
finding those directly implicated in sex de￾termination in papaya. However, the recent 
availability of genomic and molecular biol￾ogy has provided resources allowing us to 
characterize the sex determination system. 
In this chapter, we summarize the current 
understanding of papaya flowering time regu￾lation, floral development and sex deter￾mination mechanisms learned from recent 
genomic and molecular evidence.
10.2 Floral Development 
and Flowering
10.2.1 Floral morphology
Papaya flowers are borne on clusters of 
inflorescences. Female flowers are large 
and held close against the stem (Chay-Prove 
et al., 2000); male flowers are smaller and abun￾dant and are borne on 60–90 cm long pen￾dulous inflorescences. The hermaphroditic 
flower is intermediate between the two uni￾sexual forms (Nakasone and Paull, 1998). 
Further development leads to highly diver￾ging morphologies. In staminate flowers a 
combination of contorted growth and the 
development of a common stamen-petal tube 
produced a long floral tube. The pistillate 
flower grows into a central spear-like pistil￾lode. In the pistillate flowers, no traces of sta￾mens were observed and five antesepalous 
carpel primordia are initiated (Decraene and 
Smets, 1999). The hermaphroditic flower 
development was similar to unisexual forms 
up to locule initiation. Feminization regions 
contain normal functional pistils and a gy￾noecium comprising fused stamen tissue 
(Ronse De Craene et al., 2011).
10.2.2 Flower induction
Environmental factors and nutrition
Flowering, the first step of sexual reproduction 
is of paramount importance in agriculture, 
horticulture and plant breeding (Bernier et al., 
1993; Kim et al., 2009). Flower induction 
depends on some known factors such as 
physiological stress, nutrient availability, light, 
day length, hormonal regulation and tem￾perature (Baurle and Dean, 2006; Kim et al., 
2009). In papaya flower induction, changes

in environmental conditions (temperature, 
humidity, soil water status, nitrogen) can 
induce various alterations in flowering and 
reproduction of papaya (Lange, 1961; Singh 
et al., 1963; Rojas et al., 1985; Tennessen 
et al., 2016). When gynodioecious papaya 
develops in high temperature and dry con￾ditions, the inflorescence at each node may 
form a terminal hermaphroditic flower but 
become subtended by male (staminate) ax￾illary flowers (Manshardt, 2002). In hot 
(>35°C) and dry conditions, around 80% 
of bisexual flowers may become function￾ally male, with poorly developed and non￾functional female parts in  the  cultivar 
‘Sunrise Solo’ (Watson, 1997; Nakasone and 
Paull, 1998). Moreover, both dioecious and 
gynodioecious lines can cause a shift towards 
female flowers under high temperatures and 
increased humidity (Singh, 1990).
At low (<20°C) night temperatures in the 
winter months, bisexual flowers may be￾come functionally female because of carpe￾loidy, a condition in which the stamens 
develop to resemble carpels but remain as￾sociated with the developed fruit, leading to 
severely misshaped and unmarketable fruit 
(Chandrasekaran et al., 1950; Awada, 1958; 
OECD, 2003). In night temperatures of about 
12°C, in conjunction with intermediate (about 
11 h) day lengths, male plants may unusually 
develop the formation of hermaphrodite 
flowers (Allan et al., 1987), and short day, 
warm conditions may support this change 
(Aquilizan, 1987). In subtropical climates, 
fruit set on male plants may occur predict￾ably (Watson, 1997). In the tropics region, the 
trauma of a few machete or iron nail slashes 
to the trunk may stimulate male papaya to 
produce hermaphrodite flowers. The female 
reproductive system is stable, in contrast to 
the bisexual and male structures. However, 
the fertility of female papaya can be altered 
by environmental factors. Low moisture levels 
or low nitrogen content can induce female 
sterility (Awada and Ikeda, 1957). High nitro￾gen supply can stimulate male papaya to 
produce female or hermaphrodite papayas 
(Ghosh and Sen, 1975).
Photoperiod is an important environ￾mental factor for plant life, and the perception 
of light regulates plant growth, morphology 
and developmental changes (Kardailsky et al., 
1999; Yano et al., 2000; O’Malley and Banks, 
2008; Zhang et al., 2008a; Andres and Cou￾pland, 2012; Song et al., 2013; Wit et al., 
2016). Generally, long-day plants flower in 
summer; short-day plants flower in spring 
or autumn. Temperatures during the cooler 
months of the year (Nakasone, 1967) and 
photoperiodism (Hofmeyr, 1971) have been 
reported to induce sex reversal in papaya 
flowers. The male plant of Carica ‘Honey 
Gold’ in winter (22/12°C) produced elongata￾type hermaphrodite flower buds as well as 
some staminate flowers. However, during 
the longer days of summer (13 h day length) 
they reverted to producing only staminate 
flowers, even though the temperatures re￾mained at 22/12°C (Allan et al., 1987).
Gene regulation
The transition from vegetative growth to flower￾ing is controlled by environmental conditions, 
hormonal and developmental regulation. They 
induce the expression of genes that relate to 
floral transition. These signals integrate into 
a network of ‘floral pathway integrator’ 
genes, including FLOWERING LOCUS T
(FT), LEAFY (LFY) and SUPPRESSOR OF 
OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS (SOC1) 
(Nilsson et al., 1998; Kardailsky et al., 1999; 
Kobayashi et al., 1999; Blazquez and Weigel, 
2000; Lee et al., 2000; Samach et al., 2000; 
Verhage et al., 2014; Capovilla et al., 2015). 
FT in Arabidopsis was demonstrated to 
encode the florigen that moves from the leaf 
to the meristem and from the stock to the 
scion in grafting, which is a key flowering 
promoter (Kardailsky et al., 1999; Kobayashi 
et al., 1999; Corbesier et al., 2007; Yoo et al., 
2013). Florigen has been characterized in 
many crops, including poplar (Bohlenius 
et al., 2006), grape (Carmona et al., 2007), 
citrus (Nishikawa et al., 2007), apple (Kotoda 
et al., 2010) and, more recently, in mango 
(Nakagawa et al., 2012). In papaya, the ex￾pression of the CpFT1 gene has been found 
in male, female and hermaphrodite flowers, 
and at four different flower developmental 
stages (Liu et al., 2016). CpFT1 was ex￾pressed strongly in the hermaphrodite 
flower, and the authors suggest that CpFT1

expression may be indirectly correlated 
with sex determination (Liu et al., 2016).
Determination of  the identity  and de￾velopment of the floral meristem are known 
to be controlled by several genes, which have 
been well characterized in the herbaceous 
model plants Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum 
majus (Gutierrez-Cortines and Davies, 2000; 
Theissen, 2001; Mouradov et al., 2002; Simp￾son and Dean, 2002).The transition to flowering 
is dependent on the activity of floral meristem 
identity genes such as LEAFY (LFY), FRUIT￾FULL (FUL), APETALA1 (AP1) and CAULI￾FLOWER (Bowman et al., 1993; Kempin 
et al., 1995; Weigel and Nilsson, 1995; Pid￾kowich et al., 1999; Sawa et al., 1999; Simp￾son et al., 1999; Kieffer and Davies, 2001; 
Zik and Irish, 2003). The LFY gene  is a 
key regulator of flower meristem identity in 
angiosperms (Liljegren et al., 1999; Wagner 
et al., 1999). LFY serves two important roles 
in specifying flower development. First, 
LFY is a key integrator of environmental and 
endogenous signals of floral inductive path￾ways (Nilsson et al., 1998; Blazquez and 
Weigel, 2000). Secondly, LFY activity is re￾quired for the activation of A, B and C floral 
organ identity genes (Parcy et al., 1998; Busch 
et al., 1999; Blazquez, 2000; Ng and Yanof￾sky, 2000). A LFY homologue from the papaya 
was isolated. Papaya LFY (PFL) transcripts 
accumulated in the leaf primordia, but PFL
is expressed at a higher level in the floral 
meristem. PFL  was expressed in flower 
buds of all three sex types with marginal 
difference between hermaphrodite and uni￾sexual flowers. PFL may play a similar role 
to LFY in floral development regulation and 
has limited effect on sex determination in 
papaya (Yu et al., 2005).
The genetic and molecular basis of 
floral organogenesis has been extensively 
studied in the model species Arabidopsis
and Antirrhinum (Coen and Meyerowitz, 
1991; Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994; Theis￾sen and Saedler, 1995; Theissen, 2001) and 
led to the evolving ABCDE model of five 
major classes of homeotic selector genes: A, 
B, C, D and E. Most of these key floral regu￾latory genes belong to the MADS-box gene 
family encoding MIKC-type MADS domain 
proteins that function as transcription factors 
(Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2000; Theissen, 2001). 
A- and E-class genes control the develop￾ment of sepals in the first whorl (Ditta et al., 
2004). A-, B- and E-class genes work together 
to regulate petal formation in the second 
whorl, whereas B-, C- and E-class genes 
control stamen development in the third 
whorl. C- and E-class genes determine carpel 
development in the fourth whorl. D-class 
genes are involved in ovule development 
(Theissen, 2001; Krizek and Fletcher, 2005; 
Theissen and Melzer, 2007).
Papaya plants are polygamous, with 
female, male and hermaphroditic flowers. 
The male flowers have ten stamens and a 
trace of aborted pistil (Fig. 10.2A); female 
flowers have a large functional pistil, but 
are entirely devoid of stamens (Fig. 10.2B) 
and hermaphrodite flowers are radially 
symmetrical, with five sepals, five petals, ten 
stamens, five carpels, and a five carpellate 
pistil with five stigmatic rays (Fig. 10.2C) 
(Storey, 1967). Despite the economic and 
ecological importance of papaya, little is 
known on the genetic mechanisms control￾ling male, female and hermaphrodite flower 
development. Sex determination is a com￾plex phenomenon in the angiosperms with 
the involvement of several genes that are 
differentially expressed in diverse tissues 
and developmental phases (Charlesworth 
and Mank, 2010). The MADS-box gene fam￾ily, with a crucial role in many aspects of 
plant growth, may be involved in floral 
organ speciation and reproductive develop￾ment (Smaczniak et al., 2012; Theissen et 
al., 2016). Several empirical studies have 
evaluated the roles of the MADS-box floral 
homeotic genes in the floral development 
and sex determination process in many 
monoecious and dioecious plants, including 
Asparagus officinalis (Park et al., 2003), Betu￾la pendula (Elo et al., 2001), Gerbera hybrida
(Yu et al., 1999), Populus deltoides (Shep￾pard et al., 2000), Rumexa acetosa (Ainsworth 
et al., 1995), S. latifolia (Hardenack et al., 
1994), Quercus suber (Sobral and Costa, 
2017) and Momordica dioica (Mohanty and 
Joshi, 2018).
In angiosperms, where floral meristems 
are regulated by MADS-box transcription 
factors, different genders evolve via the se￾Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

lective abortion of male or female organs. 
Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of 
floral development and sex determination 
in papaya have not been fully elucidated. 
Several floral homeotic genes have been 
identified from various A, B, C, D and E 
classes. The papaya B-class genes, CpTM6-
1, CpTM6-2 and CpPI were highly expressed 
in young flowers across all floral organ prim￾ordia, petals of all three sex types and in sta￾mens of hermaphrodite and male flowers. 
CpTM6-1 was expressed at low levels in 
sepals and carpels, whereas CpTM6-2 was 
expressed at a low level in sepals and at a 
high level in leaves. CpTM6-1 and CpTM6-2
fall in the TM6 subfamily. The two paral￾ogues appeared to be the result of a recent 
tandem duplication event. These different 
patterns of gene expression in different parts 
of the flowers suggest functional diversifi￾cation after duplication (Ackerman et al., 
2007). Two AG subfamily genes CpPLE and 
CpSTK were found to be expressed in papaya 
flowers, not in roots and leaves. CpSTK is 
homologous to SEEDSTICK (STK), a D-class 
MADS-box gene that is expressed in carpels 
and ovules in Arabidopsis, and CpPLE is 
homologous to PLENA (PLE) in Antirrhi￾num. CpPLE expression was detected only 
in stamens and carpels and is thought to be 
the main C-class AG-like gene in papaya (Yu 
et al., 2008). Two E-class genes CpMADS1
and CpMADS3 were preferentially expressed 
in the carpel suggesting their potential role 
in female and hermaphroditic carpel devel￾opment. Southern blot analysis of genomic 
DNA from three sex types with probes for 
CpMADS1and CpMADS3 revealed similar 
restriction patterns and copy number, regard￾less of genotype and sex type. The two 
E-class genes might not directly participate 
in the determination of plant sex of male, 
female or hermaphrodite (Lee et al., 2014).
Although these studies have addressed 
the role of the MADS-box floral homeotic 
genes in the floral development and sex de￾termination process in papaya, it is unclear 
whether the differential expression of these 
genes is a cause or a consequence of organ 
abortion. Furthermore, the evidence that 
sex-determining mutants cosegregate with 
MADS-box genes is lacking. It is still not 
clear how MADS-box genes exert their 
influence in the sex-determining processes. 
That plants may not use MADS-box genes 
for sex determination would not be surpris￾ing given that most monoecious and dioe￾cious plants produce unisexual flowers.
10.3 Sex Determination System
The genetic basis of sex determination is 
well studied in several animals and fungi, 
particularly Drosophila melanogaster, Cae￾norhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevi￾siae and mammals (Hodgkin, 1990; Marin 
and Baker, 1998; Smith et al., 2009; Lee et al., 
2010). A sex determination system in plants 
is a complex and dynamic process that re￾quires the coordination of gene regulation, 
environmental conditions and hormones 
(Ming et al., 2011). In many dioecious plants, 
the sex-determining chromosomes or sex 
determination are either unstudied, or do 
not show any difference at cytological and 
molecular levels between the two sexes 
(Westergaard, 1958; Ming et al., 2011; Renner, 
2014). Sex determination is a complicated 
process involving regulated, large-scale modi￾fications in gene expression affecting floral 
development (Aryal and Ming, 2014).The 
regulatory  events  of sex differentiation in 
papaya may involve three major parts: (i) gen￾etic control by sex determining genes and 
sex chromosomes; (ii) epigenetic control by 
DNA methylation, histone modifications 
and non‐coding RNAs; and (iii) physio￾logical  regulation by plant hormones and 
probably other endogenous factors.
10.3.1 Genetics of sex determination
Genetic regulation of sex determination 
refers to nucleotide polymorphism in the 
chromosome loci directly implicated in 
the regulation of male and (or) female char￾acteristics. Papaya is an outstanding model 
system to study sex determination because of 
its excellent characteristic features, including 
a comparatively short life cycle, small gen￾ome size and readily available genetic infor￾Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsFlowering and Sex Expression 149
mation. According to the genetic hypothesis 
proposed independently by Storey (1953, 
1967) and Hofmeyr (1971), there were three 
alleles of sex determination: (i) M is domin￾ant for maleness; (ii) Mh for hermaphrodit￾ism; and (iii) m is recessive for femaleness. 
The diploid zygote may carry any one of the 
following six possible allelic combinations: 
MM, MhMh, MMh, Mm, Mhm and mm, based 
on the segregation ratios from crosses among 
three sex types (Table 10.1) (Storey, 1938). 
All combinations of dominant alleles, i.e. MM, 
MMh and M hMh (where M represents the 
male and Mh represents the hermaphrodite 
alleles) are lethal to the zygote (Storey, 1953; 
Samson, 1980; Arkle and Nakasone, 1984).
The pseudo-autosomal region of papaya 
sex chromosomes recombine normally and 
spans approximately 87% of the chromosome 
length. The remaining 13% is recombina￾tionally suppressed, signifying the sex￾determination region (Ming and Moore, 2013). 
The sex determination region in papaya, 
known as the hermaphrodite-specific or male￾specific region of the Y chromosome (HSY 
or MSY, respectively) covers about 8.1 Mbp, 
and its X counterpart is 3.5 Mbp with the 
annotation of 50 paired, 22 HSY-specific 
and 34 X-specific genes (Na et al., 2012; 
Wang et al., 2012). Vanburen et al. (2015) 
did the sequencing and resequencing of 
MSY and HSY portions using the bacterial 
artificial chromosome (BAC)-by-BAC ap￾proach. This study reported that high simi￾larity in gene content was predicted in both 
MSY and HSY regions and the similarity 
among MSY and HSY was 99.6%. The MSY 
sequences from wild males including MSY1, 
MSY2 and MSY3 haplotypes were identi￾fied from wild papaya males. The MSY1 
and MSY2 Y haplotypes were found in wild 
populations from two geographic regions on 
the two opposite coasts of Costa Rica. A third 
population of MSY3, as well as all HSY 
haplotype groups, were identified from the 
north Pacific region of Costa Rica.
10.3.2 Epigenetics of sex determination
Epigenetics is a very exciting area of modern 
biology that has been undergoing an impres￾sive expansion over the last few years. Epi￾genetic mechanisms include several gene 
regulation pathways: (i) DNA methylation; 
(ii) histone tail post-translational modifica￾tions; and (iii) the non-coding RNA-based 
mechanisms (Goldberg et al., 2007). Epigen￾etic regulation is also responsible for sex de￾termination and sex inheritance in plants. 
Plant microRNA (miRNAs) play critical 
roles in developmental processes, hormone 
regulation, organ polarity, organ boundary 
formation, nutrient homeostasis, stress re￾sponse and development of root, stem, leaf 
and floral organs (Rhoades et al., 2002; Kid￾ner and Martienssen, 2005; Jones-Rhoades 
et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Navarro et al., 
2008; Husbands et al., 2009; Lin et al., 
2013). The mature gametophyte produces 
male or female gametes regulated by the 
combinatorial action of various small RNAs 
(sRNAs) (Grant-Downton et al., 2009; 
Olmedo-Monfil et al., 2010). Several studies 
have analysed the roles of miRNAs and 
other regulatory RNAs in papaya (Porter 
et al., 2008; Aryal et al., 2012, 2014). A total

of 14 miRNAs were differentially expressed 
among male, female and hermaphrodite 
flowers, indicating their potential function 
in papaya sex determination (Aryal and 
Ming, 2014). All conserved miRNAs that 
expressed highest in male flowers (miR160, 
miR167a, miR167b, miR169 and miR393) 
regulate the genes in the auxin signalling 
pathway (Mallory et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 
2008; Liu et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011; Ar￾yal et al., 2014). DNA methylation is a com￾mon mechanism of epigenetic regulation in 
plants (Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014). 
A fluorescence in situ hybridization and 
immunofluorescence assay revealed that the 
papaya male-specific region of the Y chromo￾some (MSY) and hermaphrodite specific 
region of Yh (HSY) are highly methylated 
and exists in a high state of heterochromati￾zation compared with the corresponding 
region of the X chromosome. In papaya sex 
chromosome evolution, DNA methylation 
and heterochromatization may play an im￾portant role (Zhang et al., 2008b).
10.3.3 Plant growth regulators affecting 
sex expression
A plant growth regulator is an organic com￾pound, either natural or synthetic, that modi￾fies or controls an extensive influence on plant 
growth and development. Different types of 
phytohormones such as auxins, cytokinins, 
gibberellins (GAs), abscisic acid, ethylene 
and brassinosteroids have been shown to be 
responsible for regulation of sex determin￾ation in flowering plants (Dauphin-Guerin 
et al., 1980; Jaiswal et al., 1985; Irish and 
Nelson 1989; Dellaporta and Calderon￾Urrea 1993; Grant et al., 1994; Hartwig et al., 
2011). GA was proposed to regulate flower 
development and is essential for male and 
female fertility (Koornneef and van der Veen, 
1980; Nester and Jan, 1988; Goto and Pharis, 
1999). In monoecious maize and cucumber, 
cloning of the sex-determining key genes 
led to the finding that GA plays a significant 
role in the sex determination process through 
regulating and controlling stamen abortion 
and feminization of flowers (Spray et al., 1996; 
Perl-Treves, 1999). Exogenous applications 
of gibberellic acid (GA3
) on female and 
hermaphrodite flowers of papaya did not 
yield any sex reversal phenotype but only 
had a positive effect on peduncle length and 
inflorescence branch number in the treated 
plants. This result suggests an increase in bio￾active GAs may play a role in the extreme 
length and branch number seen in male 
papaya plants (Han et al., 2014).
Auxins and cytokinins  were reported 
to be key regulators of  sex expression in 
Mercurialis annua, the former feminizing 
and the latter mascularizing, probably by 
modification of the plant hormone biosyn￾thetic pathways (Durand and Durand, 
1984). Cytokinin activity was determined 
in male and female flowers of papaya with 
the activity higher in female flowers, and 
different metabolites including zeatin, ri￾bosylzeatin and cytokinin glucosides were 
present in both types of flowers. The cyto￾kinins were proposed to play a key role in 
female sex expression (Saha and Nagar, 1987).
The auxins have the role as an inducer for 
the genes directly controlling the synthesis 
of specific substances implied in sex deter￾mination. A direct effect of auxin treatment 
upon sex expression in members of the fam￾ily Cucurbitaceae has been reported. After 
treatment of cucumber leaves with a lanolin 
paste containing naphthyleneacetic acid, a 
significant increase in the number of female 
flowers was observed (Laibach and Kribben, 
1950a, b). Application of 100 ppm in￾dole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to papaya plants 
led to 108% more female flowers than control 
without a plant growth regulator. On the 
other hand, application of IBA at the same 
rate and concentration produced fewer herm￾aphrodite and male flowers (Higida and 
Pascual, 2015). When papaya was treated 
separately with auxin transport inhibitor 
morphactin (chlorflurenol) or 2,3,5-triiodo￾benzoic acid (TIBA) for sex changes, TIBA 
treatments at the fourth-leaf and sixth-leaf 
stages considerably promoted the female 
character of papaya plants, as evidenced by 
a decrease in the number of male plants and 
by an increase in the number of female 
plants (Jindal and Singh, 1976). Male plants 
of papaya were induced to bear female

flowers and yield a good fruit crop by 
the  application of chlorflurenol. Auxin 
is  reported to be a femininity-inducing 
hormone. The high levels of auxins in the 
tissues adjacent to differentiating floral 
primordia favoured pistil development; al￾ternatively, low levels of auxins favoured 
stamen development. An increase in auxin 
content during differentiation led to the for￾mation of female flowers at exactly the 
same loci as would be normally occupied 
by male flowers (Heslop-Harrison, 1956; 
Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison, 1958a, 
b; Frankel and Galun, 1977). Since TIBA 
and chlorflurenol act effectively to block 
basipetal auxin transport without affecting 
acropetal transport, auxin accumulates near 
the place of its origin/synthesis in plants treat￾ed with both chemicals (Heslop-Harrison, 
1957; Frankel and Galun, 1977; Gagianas 
and Berg, 1977). Therefore, it may be con￾jectured that auxin synthesized near the 
floral primordia region of papaya does not 
move from the place of its origin in response 
to TIBA and chlorflurenol treatment and its 
accumulation in greater amount in the vicin￾ity of a developing primordium controls the 
fate of the same (Jindal and Singh, 1976; 
Kumar and Jaiswal, 1984).
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone which 
stimulates growth and alters the sex ex￾pression character of cucurbits. In the ab￾sence of ethylene, female flowers produced 
stamens, suggesting a role for ethylene in 
the active suppression of stamen develop￾ment (McMurray and Miller, 1968; Iwa￾hori et al., 1970; Byers et al., 1972). Ethep￾hon (ethrel) is an artificial plant growth 
regulator that releases ethylene when dis￾solved in water and may increase its en￾dogenous level in plant tissues (Cooke and 
Randall, 1968). The spraying of papaya 
plants with ethrel solution induced the 
formation of female flowers on male plants 
(Jindal and Singh, 1976; Kumar and 
Jaiswal, 1984; Higida and Pascual, 2015). 
Ethylene was reported to inhibit auxin 
transport (Abeles, 1966; Beyer and Morgan, 
1969; Suttle, 1988), accordingly the ethylene 
application may be interfering with auxin 
movement, favouring female development 
in papaya.
10.4 Molecular Markers 
for Sex Determination
Molecular markers are the most widely used 
powerful tools in recent years in the agronomic 
sector for efficient plant improvement (Varsh￾ney et al., 2005; Grover and Sharma, 2016; 
Garrido-Cardenas et al., 2018). Several types 
of molecular markers are widely studied, 
including: (i) restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP); (ii) random-amplified 
polymorphic DNA (RAPD); (iii) amplified 
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP); (iv) 
simple sequence repeats (SSR); (v) short tan￾dem repeats (STR); (vi) inter-simple sequence 
repeat (ISSR); and (vii) single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) (Garrido-Cardenas 
et al., 2018).
The first report of a sex determination 
marker in papaya was reported by Sondur 
et al. (1996) using RAPD markers and an F2
population derived from a Hawaiian culti￾var ‘Sunrise’ × UH (University of Hawaii) 
breeding line 356 to construct a genetic 
linkage map. A total of 596 10-mer RAPD 
primers were screened and 96 polymorphisms 
were detected. The 62 markers were mapped 
to 11 linkage groups (LGs), spanning a total 
of 999.3 cM, with an average distance of 
19.6 cM between adjacent markers. The 
Sex1 segregated two hermaphrodites to one 
female (Sondur et al., 1996). The sequence 
characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker 
T12 cosegregates with the sex determining 
region and can be used to detect the herm￾aphrodite (Deputy et al., 2002). Lemos et al. 
(2002) screened 152 RAPD primers on female 
and hermaphrodite plants of C. papaya cul￾tivar ‘Baixinho de Santa Amália’. Primer 
BC210 produced a marker band at 438 bp 
(BC210438) that was present in all plants pre￾viously identified as hermaphrodites but 
absent from female plants. The marker was 
tested with 195 different samples from three 
cultivars and was present only in hermaph￾rodite plants, thus the marker was used as 
an efficient tool for differentiation between 
hermaphrodites and females. In another study, 
the sex-linked markers described previously 
were tested on three Columbian papayas. An 
RAPD marker of 900 bp was found in male 
plants but not in females or hermaphrodites.

The RAPD marker was further exploited as a 
SCAR and it was possible to amplify frag￾ments from the genomes of male and herm￾aphrodite plants to study sex determination 
(Chaves-Bedoya and Nuñez, 2007).
Microsatellites, SSRs and STRs are found 
in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Vieira et al., 
2016; Garrido-Cardenas et al., 2018). Micro￾satellite markers have been widely used in 
DNA-based genetic analyses. Parasnis et al. 
(1999) performed a genetic study by digesting 
papaya genomic DNA with various restric￾tion enzymes and microsatellite sequences 
were used as probes. Among these, only the 
microsatellite probe (GATA)4
 demonstrated 
sex-specific differences in male/hermaph￾rodite-specific bands at 5 kb and 4 kb after 
digesting the genomic DNA with HinfI and 
HaeII. Chiu et al. (2015) analysed the sexual 
ratio of offspring from the hermaphrodite 
cultivar ‘Taiwan Seed Station No. 7’ (T7) by 
a self-crossing and its cross with hermaph￾rodite ‘Taichung Sunrise’ (TS) and selected 
192 SSR primers to analyse the polymorph￾ism between T7 and TS. Three mating com￾binations, TS × TS, T7 × T7, and TS × T7, 
yielded the following independent ratios for 
the number of hermaphroditic: dioecious 
female offspring, 122:68, 102:0 and 68:36. 
The results of the Chi-square test supported 
a 2:1 ratio of hermaphrodites: dioecious 
females in TS × TS and TS × T7. However, 
the offspring of T7 selfing did not match the 
expected sex ratio. The authors suggested 
that a lethal recessive gene might be linked 
to the T7 cultivar and thus causes the fatality 
in female offspring. A total of 37 SSR mark￾ers were identified in T7 and TS. Among 
them, 14 SSRs served as the markers for 
identification of T7, TS and their hybrid 
offspring (Chiu et al., 2015).
Recent developments in next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) and the analysis of mas￾sive sequence information allowed for large￾scale screening of SNPs (Levy and Myers, 
2016). Lee et al. (2018) recently reported 
alternative splicing sequences (AS-seqs) 
with the Illumina NGS platform from a tran￾scriptome database of the three papaya 
flower sex types. After screening analysis, 
the cDNA regions of the three sex-related 
loci, including short vegetative phase-like 
(CpSVPL), the chromatin assembly factor 1 
subunit A-like (CpCAF1AL), and the somatic 
embryogenesis receptor kinase (CpSERK), 
which contained eight sex-related SNPs 
from the different sex types of papaya, were 
genotyped using high-resolution melting 
(HRM). The three loci were examined regard￾ing the profiles of the third whorl, as de￾scribed below. CpSVPL, which had one SNP 
associated with the three sex genotypes, 
was highly expressed in the male and female 
sterile flowers that lacked the fourth whorl 
structure. CpCAF1AL, which had three 
SNPs associated with the male genotype, 
was highly expressed in male and hermaph￾rodite flowers and had no AS-seqs, whereas 
it exhibited low expression. In addition, 
AS-seqs in introns 5, 6 and 7 of CpSERK con￾tained four SNPs associated with the female 
genotype, and the CpSERK and CpCAF1AL
loci exhibited no AS-seq expression in the 
third whorl of the male and hermaphrodite 
flower. Functional mapping of the third whorl 
of normal hermaphrodites indicated no 
AS-seq expression in CpSERK, low CpSVPL
expression, and, for CpCAF1AL, high expres￾sion and no AS-seq expression on XYh-type 
chromosomes. To identify the roles of these 
genes in sex determination, further func￾tional analyses, including genetic transform￾ation or mutation in papaya, are necessary.
10.5 Conclusion
Up to now, many papaya sex determination 
genes have been proposed based on recent 
molecular studies. However, functional iden￾tification of these candidate genes directly 
on papaya plants has not been achieved to 
confirm their roles in sex determination. 
Technology on overexpression or silencing 
of sex-related genes in papaya to regulate sex 
determination is awaiting further advance￾ment. The clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats-associated pro￾tein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, which is an 
unprecedented technological breakthrough, 
has provided a valuable means of creating 
targeted mutations in plant genomes (Jinek 
et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). The CRISPR/
Cas9 system probably can be applied to

generate mutations or corrections of candi￾date genes for sex determination in papaya 
to confirm their identity and regulation 
mechanism and is of value for advanced 
molecular breeding. Alternatively, we can 
develop tissue culture technology such as 
somatic embryogenesis of hermaphrodite 
plants and exploitation of the artificial seed 
technique without the concern of genetic 
modification.

11.1 Fruit Set and Development
11.1.1 Flowering habits and fruit 
characteristics
In nature, papaya, as with most species in 
the family Caricaceae, is dioecious, (i.e. a 
species having male floral organs, the sta￾mens, and female floral organs, the pistil, in 
two different kind of plants; male (androe￾cious) and female (gynoecious) individuals) 
(Fisher, 1980; Fuentes and Santamaría, 
2014). Therefore, dioecy likely represents 
the ancestral sexual state in this family 
(Charlesworth, 2013). Papaya sex chromo￾somes seem to have emerged only a few mil￾lion years ago (Yu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 
2012). Sex determination is based on three 
alleles (M, Mh and m) at a single locus 
(Storey, 1938).
In spite of the fact that dioecy is the nat￾ural condition of papaya, in cultivation there 
may be hermaphrodite individuals, in addition 
to male and female plants, a reproductive 
system termed trioecy. Although, trioecy is 
frequently assigned to papaya, the very ex￾istence of this condition is controversial in 
sex allocation models (Perry et al., 2012). 
The trioecious sexual type is therefore 
considered rare and transitory, and thought 
to derive from dioecious ancestors (Aryal 
and Ming, 2013). Hermaphroditism in papaya 
seems to have arisen in independent events 
in different places, and hermaphrodite 
individuals are found in many papaya 
cultivars. Different species of Vasconcellea
(‘highland or mountain papayas’) are de￾fined as polygamous (i.e. plants possessing 
inflorescences with male, female and herm￾aphrodite flowers) (Aguirre et al., 2009; 
Salvatierra-González and Jana-Ayala, 2016) 
as papaya is by Das et al. (2014) and Céccoli 
et al. (2012).
Although, male, female and hermaph￾rodite individuals exist in papaya cultivars, 
most growers prefer hermaphrodite plants. 
This is because they produce more elongated￾shaped fruit with a smaller internal cavity 
that is more marketable than fruit from 
female plants (Urasaki et al., 2012). Hermaph￾rodite plants, however, have the disadvantage 
of forming flowers of different morphology. 
Storey (1958) reported up to 31 types of 
flowers on the basis of peduncle length and 
ramification and of seasonal sexual responses. 
Fifteen of these are variations among stam￾inate plants and 15 are variations among 
hermaphrodite or andromonoecious plants.

The remaining phenotype is the pistillate 
plant. Later, these were classified into eight 
broad categories for classifying trees accord￾ing to modifications of sex expression. The 
categories are: (i) staminate; (ii) teratological 
staminate; (iii) reduced elongate; (iv) elong￾ate; (v) carpelloid elongate; (vi) pentandria; 
(vii) carpelloid pentandria; and (viii) pistillate.
These flower alterations produce fruit of 
variable morphology, very frequently mis￾shapen among them deformed fruit commonly 
known as cat face fruit. A hermaphrodite plant 
normally produces reduced elongate, carpel￾loid elongate, petandria and carpelloid petan￾dria type flowers. A male plant produces 
staminate flowers while a female bears only 
pistillate flowers. Teratological staminate 
flowers are produced by sex-reversing males 
(Ray, 2002). A detailed study using scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the 
morphology of the flower and therefore of 
the corresponding fruit is determined early 
in flower development. Flower buds 2 mm 
tall already show the changes in floral or￾gans characterizing elongata, pentandric 
and carpelloid fruit (Fig. 11.1) (Salinas et al., 
2019a). These results suggest that environ￾mental factors at the period of flower initi￾ation influenced the type of fruit produced. 
Therefore, the conditions leading to their 
formation must be tracked weeks before an￾thesis. Seasonal climactic changes caused 
huge variation in the proportion of flowers of 
different types in subtropical areas through￾out the year (Martelleto et al., 2011). The time 
from small flower buds to open flower is be￾tween 45 days and 47 days in both staminate 
and pistillate flowers, 2 days more in herm￾aphrodite flowers in tropical climates (Fisher, 
1980); more, up to 10 weeks, in subtropical 
areas (Sippel et al., 1989). Male flowers are 
smaller than female flowers, and the bisex￾ual flowers are of intermediate size. The 
size of the flower has a strong influence on 
the size of the fruit (Chango, 2017). Once 
flowers are initiated, their development 
proceeds without any kind of rest or quies￾cence as occurs in temperate and some sub￾tropical fruit crops where flower development 
is often interrupted until favourable weather 
arrives. These aspects are also discussed in 
Chapters 3 and 10, this volume.
11.1.2 Fruit set and parthenocarpy
Cerino et al. (2015) studied the reproduct￾ive biology of Vasconcellea quercifolia
(‘highland papaya’) and confirmed that this 
closely related species is mainly pollinated 
by moths attracted to the male flowers by 
the nectar produced while female flowers 
are pollinated by deceit because they do not 
produce nectar, although they do form stig￾matic exudate. Natural pollination of pa￾paya flowers by hawk moths has been also 
documented by Martins and Johnson 
(2009). Pollination syndrome characterized 
by melitophilly consists in large open 
white flowers mostly opening in the even￾ing, as takes place in papaya (Mekako and 
Nakasone, 1975; Dey et al., 2016). Papaya 
flowers last 2–3 days (Moo-Aldana et  al., 
2017), petal wilting starting a couple of 
days after anthesis, taking many more days 
for petal fall. Detailed studies analysing 
pollen viability, germinability and stigma 
receptivity have been carried out by Dama￾sceno et al. (2009). Hermaphroditic plants 
are autogamous (Wester, 1908), with self￾pollination likely occurring on the first day
of flower opening or before since anther de￾hiscence occurs before anthesis (Dama￾sceno et al., 2009; Dey et al., 2016). Wind 
has a limited role in papaya pollination 
(Wester, 1908; Dey et al., 2016). Many in￾sects often visit papaya flowers in the open 
field (Moo-Aldana et al., 2017), although 
they are not conspicuous in greenhouse 
cultivation. Parthenocarpy is common in 
female plants and also possible in female 
flowers but seldom occurs in hermaphro￾dite individuals.
Inflorescences appear in every leaf axis 
just below the growing point. The inflores￾cence is a cyme, very much branched in 
male plants and reduced in female plants. 
Flowers are formed in a high number in 
each node once the adult state is reached. In 
fact, the monopodial habit of papaya plants 
allows continuous flowering if growth is not 
interrupted and new nodes are formed. The 
first flower appears around node number 
41–45 in cultivars ‘BH-65’ and ‘Eksotica’, but 
before, in node 30, in ‘First Lady’ (Almodóvar 
et al., 2014); because of the different internode

length, the height at which the first flowers 
develop may differ noticeably among cul￾tivars of different vigour (‘BH-65’ 57 cm 
and 135 cm for ‘First Lady’). First flowers 
do not always set. A desirable character of 
the papaya tree is rapid maturity, leading 
to early flowering and yielding at a low 
height. In this regard, papaya propagated 
by tissue culture or from cuttings start to 
form fruit at a lower height given the adult 
condition of the material used. Forming 
fruit at a low height is very convenient and 
almost mandatory in protected cultivation 
of papaya (Nee et al., 1998), since it re￾duces production costs by facilitating har￾vest and crop protection in all conditions. 
The seedlings may take around 3 months to 
come into flower in protected cultivation 
(Almodóvar et al., 2014; Reddy and Gow￾da, 2014), 2 weeks earlier than in the open

field in Bangalore, India (Reddy and Gow￾da, 2014).
The removal of flower buds from a node 
allows new blossoms to arise as long as the 
stalk of the flower remains after flower 
elimination.This operation is often required 
if a misshapen flower and non-commercial 
fruit is formed in that node. The capacity to 
reflower allows a certain level of fruit set￾ting in previously fruitless portions of the 
stem, therefore recovering plant productiv￾ity. Fruit set is naturally high (over 70% of 
flowers formed) in most papaya genotypes 
(Das et al., 2014). This natural high fruit set 
can be further enhanced by use of different 
plant growth regulators such as naphthale￾neacetic acid (NAA), benzyladenine (BA) 
and gibberellic acid (GA3
) (Bhogave and Raut, 
2014; Hazarika et al., 2016). GA3
 and NAA 
also increased fruit size in tissue-cultured ‘Red 
Lady’ papaya plants (Hazarika et al., 2016).
Female plants produce rounded fruit 
with a large internal cavity. Seedless papayas 
are common in female plants and are the re￾sult of parthenocarpy due to lack of pollin￾ation. Seedless papaya can be formed from 
occasional female flowers formed on herm￾aphrodite plants. Male plants sometimes also 
produce fruit, because some flowers possess 
a rudimentary pistil that may be transformed 
into a seedless fruit.
11.1.3 Fruit growth models
Papaya fruit growth follows a single sigmoid 
curve. This is applicable to all cultivars of dif￾ferent geographic origin and pedigree, and 
does not depend on whether the cultivars 
are hybrids or not. The best equations that de￾scribe papaya fruit growth are those of the 
Richard and the Weibull distribution models. 
Accurate prediction of final fruit size can 
therefore be achieved using them weeks be￾fore harvest. Accurate forecasting of final fruit 
size and maturation time can also be obtained 
by the use of logistic and Gompertz equations; 
these are preferred because they are simple 
and easy to understand (Salinas et al., 2019b).
In subtropical areas, the number of 
days required from bloom to ripening varies 
across the seasons. It may require between 
100 days and more than 300 days from bloom to 
ripening, depending on the cultivar, location 
and season (Allan et al., 1987; Reddy and Gow￾da, 2014; Lima et al., 2018; Salinas et al., 
2019b). Fruit development from pollination to 
veraison (i.e. skin-colour-turning stage) takes 
135–140 days for ‘Coorg Honey Dew’, ‘Pink 
Fleshed Sweet’ and ‘Sunrise’, 140–145 days for 
‘Thailand’ and 150–155 days for the variety 
‘Washington’ in the milder climatic conditions 
of Bangalore, India (Selvaraj et al., 1982). In 
warm humid climates ‘Washington’ papaya 
takes 145–150 days to reach the skin-colour￾turning stage, and the change of seed colour 
from white to black starts at or after 130 days 
of fruit development (Ghanta et al., 1994). 
More accuracy can be achieved if instead of 
computing days from flowering to harvest, 
the thermal time is calculated (i.e. growing 
degree days (GDD) for the same period). Berilli 
et al. (2007) reported that between 1100 and 
1300 GDD are required from bloom to ripen￾ing (just 800 GDD for maximum fruit size) in 
the cultivar ‘UENF/Caliman 01’, depending on 
the season. Similar heat requirements have 
been found by Lima et al. (2018) in ‘Solo’ 
and ‘Formosa’ cultivars, without differences 
between sexually and vegetatively propagated 
plants. Between 1300 GDD and 1500 GDD are 
required for different papaya cultivars, using a 
base temperature of 15°C (Salinas et al., 2019b). 
In this approach, precise cardinal temperat￾ures (especially base temperature (Tb) and 
threshold temperature (Th)) are required. 
A Tb of 15°C has been proposed for papaya 
(Nakasone, 1988). Recent results challenged 
this value and suggest a lower Tb (Salinas 
et al., 2019b). These aspects are also discussed 
in Chapter 16, this volume.
The dynamic of growth in partheno￾carpic fruit from female plants has not yet 
been established to the best of our knowledge. 
We presume no variation in the models given 
the precedents observed in other crops with 
parthenocarpic fruit (Li et al., 2017).
11.1.4 Fruit size determinants: seediness, 
flower size and sink:source ratio
Despite the parthenocarpic potential of 
papaya fruit (Free, 1975), in seeded fruit,

Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsFruit Set, Development, Maturity and Ripening 165
the number of seeds imposes a moderate 
influence on final fruit size (Allan, 1969). 
A  closer relationship has been found with 
flower size. In this regard, larger, wider 
flowers produce larger and heavier fruit 
with more edible pulp (Chango, 2017). A 
significant relationship between the diam￾eter of the flower and the weight of fruit has 
been also reported. It was also verified that 
improving the climate inside the green￾house by heating has a positive effect on 
flower and fruit size, making them larger 
than the flowers developed in unheated 
greenhouses. Finally, the size of the fruit is 
influenced by the position of the flower in 
the stem node. Fruits from terminal king 
flowers are bigger and heavier than second￾ary lateral flowers (Chango, 2017). This in￾formation will allow us to estimate fruit size 
in advance and design tools for its improve￾ment under conditions of protected cultiva￾tion in areas of mild winter climate.
The sink:source ratio is essential to de￾termine fruit set and size in many fruit 
crops. The sink:source ratio can be experi￾mentally modified by defoliation and thin￾ning experiments. In an experiment carried 
out with ‘Sunset’ cultivar, Zhou et al. (2000) 
found that continuous removal of old leaves 
significantly reduced fruit set, weight and 
total soluble solids (TSS) content. The re￾sults were different when leaf removal was 
performed only once at the beginning of the 
experiment. In this case, the removal of 
75% of the leaves (from the oldest to the 
youngest) reduced flowering and setting 
and also fruit sweetness, but the removal of 
50% of the leaves did not. The authors con￾cluded that one leaf of ‘Sunset’ papaya is 
able to provide photoassimilates for around 
three fruits. Ito (1976) proposed that 15 
functional leaves might be able to support 
fruit growth and ripening of the usual fruit 
load simultaneously produced by a plant. 
Ito (1976) also observed the negative effects 
of defoliation when comparing the removal 
of old leaves versus young ones, the dam￾age being more severe when young leaves 
were eliminated. Defoliation also increases 
the proportion of staminate flowers and 
decreases trunk and leaf growth (Awada, 
1967).
The sink:source ratio can also be modified 
by fruit thinning. A moderate response has 
been observed to thinning. In an experiment 
aiming to reduce fruit size in ‘Intenzza’ by 
increasing the number of fruits per node, and 
to increase the size in ‘BH-65’ by removing 
excess fruits, we found a very modest response 
(Salinas et al., 2019c). The failure is inter￾preted in terms of the high photosynthetic 
capacity of papaya leaves and the high yield 
potential of plants.
In spite of the high flowering capacity 
in papaya, discontinuous fruit set is observed 
in subtropical areas. The lack of setting in 
summer is mostly due to fertility loss of 
flowers formed then, when the plant is be￾having functionally as a male during this 
period (Storey, 1954). Reduced setting in 
winter is interpreted partially as the lack of 
growth and therefore of flower formation 
due to low temperatures, but also as a lack 
of ovule fertilization probably because of 
slow pollen tube growth (Tamaki et al., 
2011). In tropical areas more continuous set￾ting is observed, without barren portions in 
the trunk.
11.2 Maturity and Ripening
11.2.1 Respiratory activity
The postharvest period of papayas is dir￾ectly related to the cultivar, environmental 
conditions and harvest time. The respir￾ation rate of ‘Sunset’ papaya fruit decreased 
prior to ripening from 48 ml CO2
 h-1 kg-1 in 
fruit at 14 days after anthesis (DAA) to 12 ml 
h-1 kg-1 at 70 DAA, then remained constant 
until ripening commenced (Zhou and Paull, 
2001). The respiration rate of the on-tree 
‘Pluk Mai Lie’ papaya increases from the 
colour-break (CB) stage, reaching the cli￾macteric peak (15.34 mg CO2
 kg-1 h-1) when 
the fruit is three-quarters ripe. The respir￾ation rate of detached fruit reaches 24.54 mg 
CO2
 kg-1 h-1 after 3 days of storage (Fuggate 
et al., 2010).
The respiratory activity of ‘Golden’ 
papaya harvested at the CB stage starts to 
increase after the third day of storage at

23°C, reaching ≈31 ml CO2
 kg-1 h-1 (Bron and 
Jacomino, 2006). According to Fabi et al. 
(2007), ‘Golden’ papaya harvested at CB and 
stored at 25°C has the respiration burst (≈60 
mg CO2
 kg-1 h-1) on the fifth day and decreases 
to ≈20 mg CO2
 kg-1 h-1 on the eighth day. 
‘Maradol’ papaya produces 36.5 ml kg-1 h-1 on 
the eighth day after harvest at the CB stage 
(Basulto et al., 2009). The papaya cultivar 
‘Sekaki’ produces ≈20 ml kg-1 h-1 (at the CB 
stage), reaching ≈33 ml kg-1 h-1 in the ripe stage 
on the eighth day of storage (Ong et al., 2014). 
In papaya cultivar ‘Rainbow’, Manenoi et al. 
(2007) recorded ≈15 ml CO2
 kg-1 h-1 at the CB 
stage, reaching a maximum (≈23 ml CO2
 kg-1 h-1) 
after 10 days at 22°C.
Ethylene production in ‘Golden’ pa￾payas harvested at the CB stage shows two 
increases, with the second peak on the sev￾enth day of storage at 23°C (2 μl kg-1 h-1). 
Fruits harvested with more than 15% yellow 
peel present the lowest ethylene level (0.57 
μl kg-1 h-1), indicating that the peak oc￾curred in attached fruits (Bron and Jacomino, 
2006). The endogenous ethylene of ‘Golden’ 
papaya has the peak on day 4 (≈14 μl kg-1 h-1) 
and precedes the respiration burst by 1 day, 
with a sharp decrease to ≈2.8 μl kg-1 h-1 on 
the eighth day (Fabi et al., 2007). In ‘Marad￾ol’ papaya, the ethylene increase starts on 
the sixth day, reaching its highest level (3.3 
μl kg-1 h-1) on the eighth day and gradually 
decreases to half this level at day 13 (Basul￾to et al., 2009). A more pronounced peak was 
found in mountain papaya fruit, reaching 
44 μl kg-1 h-1 after 11 days at 20°C (Balbontín 
et al., 2007).
Ehylene-forming enzyme (EFE) activity 
was found to be at the maximum in the exo￾carp of three-quarter-ripe fruits (Chan et al., 
1990); EFEs in the mesocarp and endocarp 
were more heat sensitive than EFEs in the 
exocarp (Chan, 1991). The heat inactivation 
of EFE was found to be biphasic, with phases 
following first order kinetics (Chan, 1986). 
Within the mesocarp and endocarp, EFE in 
quarter- and half-ripe fruits were more heat 
labile than those in mature green and CB fruits. 
Ion leakage increased firstly in the endocarp, 
followed by the mesocarp, confirming that 
papaya ripens differentially from the inner 
tissues outwards (Chan, 1991).
11.2.2 Physical and chemical changes 
at harvest and during ripening
Ripeness index
Papayas are harvested year round in tropical￾producing countries. Harvesting at the cor￾rect stage of physiological maturity (during or 
after the CB stage) ensures the full sensorial 
characteristics of papaya since the fruits 
ripen normally (Manenoi et al., 2007). The 
‘Sunset’ papaya fruit reach a trace of yellow 
peel at 140 DAA. The red-orange flesh a*
 value 
increases from -5, at 125 DAA, to 18 after fruit 
ripening (Zhou and Paull, 2001). In red-pulp 
papaya cultivar ‘Pococí’ at the preharvest 
stage (140 DAA), the fruit flesh takes on a 
slightly orange colour and the TSS rises to 
≈7.5°Brix. The CB characteristic of the peel 
(150 DAA) is marked by the appearance of one 
to two yellow lines and while at this stage, 
the mesocarp TSS reaches ≈8.5°Brix (Schweig￾gert et al., 2011).
The physiological maturity of ‘Maradol’ 
papaya is established at 135 DAA (CB stage) 
when the fruits reach their maximum bio￾chemical and physical development. After 
harvesting, the ripening could proceed for 
consumption at 156 DAA (Barragán-Iglesias 
et al., 2018). The highest sensory scores are 
attributed to ‘Golden’ papayas harvested after 
full ripening on the plant; however, ‘Golden’ 
papayas harvested at CB have lower fruit sen￾sory scores but still enables fruit with desir￾able sensorial qualities (Bron and Jacomino, 
2006). In the papaya cultivar ‘Pluk Mai Lie’, 
fruits harvested at early maturity were not able 
to complete the development of the peel col￾our. However, fruit ripening while attached 
to the tree produced fewer aroma-related es￾ters, suggesting that the proper harvesting 
index would be after the half-ripe stage in 
plants (Fuggate et al., 2010).
TSS and pulp firmness are suitable ripen￾ing parameters for the precise determination 
of papaya preharvest stages (Schweiggert 
et al., 2011).
Colour changes in peel and fruit pulp
The peel colour parameters (CIE L*, a*, b* 
and C*) of papaya cultivar ‘Sekaki’ follow a

single sigmoid curve, increasing throughout 
the ripening period. The hue angle (h°) values 
show the opposite curve, decreasing as the 
ripening progresses. The fruit is harvested in 
the CB stage presenting L*: 44.26, a*: -15.01, 
b*: 30.33, C*: 32.11, h°: 117.87 (Ruslan and 
Roslan, 2016). The lightness value (L*) for 
papaya ‘Sekaki’ increases from 41.0 (CB) to 
64.1 in ripe fruit, but gradually decreases from 
day 8 onwards (Ong et al., 2014). ‘Golden’ 
papaya shows h°: ≈110 at the CB stage, de￾creasing to h°: 83 on the seventh day of stor￾age at 23°C (Bron and Jacomino, 2009).
The peel colour of ‘Pluk Mai Lie’ papaya 
changes from dark green (L*: 47.04; b*: 
27.65) at the immature stage to orange-red 
(L*: 61.96; b*: 50.06) at the full-ripe (FR) 
stage. The yellow peel colour is fully reached 
after the ethylene peak plus 2 days (101 DAA). 
The orange-red-pulp varieties of papaya de￾velop an orange-red colour independently 
of whether they are ripened attached to the 
tree or not, with just the peel of on-tree FR 
fruit showing intensive a* values (Fuggate 
et al., 2010). The colour peel of ‘Maradol’ 
papaya fruit during ripening attached to 
the tree is different from detached ones, 
possibly because of previous pretreatment 
and the influence of storage (Basulto et al. 
(2009). The same trend was noted for culti￾vars ‘Pococi’ (Schweiggert et al., 2011) and 
‘Sekaki’ (Ruslan and Roslan, 2016).
‘Maradol’ papaya at the CB stage (a*: 
−15.1; b*: 30.1) can ripen correctly. Their 
a* value increases steadily, reaching full ripe￾ness (a*: 13.4 and b*: 49.8) on the 14th day. 
The peel luminosity (L*) increases from ≈41 in 
green fruit to 58.3 in stage 4 (orange colour 
with light-green areas), and then decreases 
slightly in further stages. The hue angle 
changes from 125° to 74°. Pulp L* values de￾crease from ≈70 in green fruit to 48.5 in ripe 
fruit (orange colour). The pulp is yellow at 
the CB stage (h°: 90°) and becomes orange at 
the ripe stage (h°: 63°) (Basulto et al., 2009).
The colour patterns differ among papaya 
varieties. In the ‘Golden’ variety, peel hue 
angle in ripe fruits is ≈86° (Bron and Jacomi￾no, 2006), more yellow than cultivars ‘Sun￾set’ and ‘Maradol’ fruit, with orange peel 
(Basulto et al., 2009). The pulp of ripe ‘Golden’ 
papaya shows colour values of a* equal to 
7.7 and b* equal to 2.6 (Fabi et al., 2007). 
These values are lower than the ones observed 
for the ‘Maradol’ variety, demonstrating that 
the pulp of ‘Golden’ fruit is less red and less 
yellow (Basulto et al., 2009).
Firmness
The firmness of papaya cultivar ‘Rainbow’ 
decreases markedly from ≈220 N at the CB 
stage to around 25 N after 5 days at 22°C and 
reaches 15.1 N after 10 days, when fruits 
have more than 90% yellow peel (Manenoi 
et al., 2007). The mesocarp firmness in 
‘Maradol’ was described as an exponential 
function that decreases rapidly in the begin￾ning of ripening and then becomes stable 
after the intermediate stages (Barragán￾Iglesias et al., 2018). The same pattern was 
also observed in ‘Solo’ (Gomez et al., 2002) 
and ‘Golden’ varieties (Bron et al., 2004).
‘Maradol’ papayas that ripen on the tree 
do not demonstrate huge changes in fruit 
firmness throughout ripening (Barragán￾Iglesias et al., 2018). After harvesting, the 
pulp firmness of green ‘Maradol’ papaya is 
140 N and decreases slightly at stage 1 (CB) 
but drops almost eightfold at the intermedi￾ate stages (16 N), which was found to be 
consistent with higher ethylene production 
(Basulto et al., 2009). According to Sañu￾do-Barajas et al. (2009), the firmness of 
‘Maradol’ papaya is 144 N at harvest, soft￾ening steadily to 105 N on the third day, 
reaching 17 N by 6 days of storage, with a 
strong dependence on ethylene perception. 
In ‘Golden’ papaya, the ethylene production 
does not peak until fruit reaches edible pulp 
firmness (Bron and Jacomino, 2006). Firm￾ness in mature green papaya cultivar ‘Sui 
you 2’ is about 250 N, but it decreases dur￾ing the first 10 days of storage at 20°C, 
reaching around 24.5 N, in concomitance 
with the increase in ethylene production 
(Guo et al., 2013). Papaya cultivar ‘Pluk Mai 
Lie’ developing on the tree looses pulp firm￾ness dramatically until the intermediate 
stage of ripening, dropping from 102.42 N 
to 10.76 N, whereas softening of detached 
fruit accelerates when the fruit is about 
70–80% yellow peel (Fuggate et al., 2010). 
Alterations in the cell wall during ripening

causes cells to become rounded and separ￾ated, with the collapse of tissue and changes 
in membrane integrity (Madani et al., 2016).
Fruits of papaya cultivar ‘Golden’ at the 
mature green stage (firmness ≈140 N) show 
a sharp decrease in pulp firmness, reaching 
consumption firmness (≤ 20 N) on the fourth 
day of storage at 23°C (Bron and Jacomino, 
2009). The same behaviour was also ob￾served by Fabi et al. (2007) in papaya culti￾var ‘Golden’, with a sharp decrease in flesh 
firmness in concomitance with the increase 
in ethylene production.
Changes in Total Soluble Solids (TSS)
The TSS of red-pulped papaya cultivar ‘Po￾cocí’ increases during ripening from 6.5°Brix 
(at preharvest) to 8.5°Brix (CB stage). Dur￾ing postharvest storage, the TSS rises to 
10.5°Brix at the ripe stage. Fruit attached to 
the tree until full ripening shows TSS con￾tents of 11.1°Brix, like ethylene-ripened 
fruit (10.8°Brix) (Schweiggert et al., 2011). 
It is assumed that cell wall degradation by 
polygalacturonase and β-galactosidase activ￾ities leads to pectin and hemicellulose 
hydrolysis which contribute to the increase 
in the TSS (Fabi et al., 2007).
Fruit attached to the tree of cultivar 
‘Maradol’ increases the TSS content up to 
40% during ripening, reaching 11.4%, close 
to the minimum value (11.5%) for sensorial 
acceptable quality (Barragán-Iglesias et al., 
2018). The TSS values of ‘Maradol’ papaya var￾ies with the season of harvesting, climatic 
factors, soil conditions and agricultural man￾agement practices (Basulto et al. 2009).
The TSS of ‘Pluk Mai Lie’ papaya attached 
to the tree increases continuously from im￾mature to the full-ripe stage at 99 DAA. The 
TSS of detached fruit at the CB stage remains 
unchanged for the first 3 days at ambient 
conditions and increases slightly to 11.7% 
on day 4 (Fuggate et al., 2010). However, in 
‘Golden’ papaya, irrespective of the matur￾ity stages at which they were harvested after 
the CB stage, the TSS do not differ during 
ripening, reaching an average of 11.9°Brix 
(Bron and Jacomino, 2006).
The increase in TSS was observed in 
different papaya varieties with progressive 
ripening. In the ripe stage, the Hawaii papaya 
reached 14.8°Brix, higher than ‘Khak Dam’ 
(9.7°Brix) and Holland papayas (11.4°Brix) of 
Thailand (Siriamornpun and Kaewseejan, 
2017). Papaya cultivar ‘Sekaki’ increases its 
TSS content from the green stage (10.5°Brix) 
until the yellow stage (13.5°Brix), but the 
TSS content drops when the fruit turns fully 
yellow, possibly due to sugar metabolism 
(Ruslan and Roslan, 2016). The same trend 
was also noted for papaya cultivar ‘Solo’ 
with TSS varying from 8.3°Brix to 12.5°Brix 
in 6 days of storage at ambient conditions, 
dropping thereafter due to the use of the sol￾uble sugars as a respiration substrate (Azene 
et al., 2014).
Changes in sugars
The principal sugars in papaya fruits are 
sucrose, glucose and fructose. In the early 
stages of fruit development, glucose is the 
predominant sugar, while at the pre-ripe and 
ripe stages, sucrose increases by two- to five￾fold, reaching higher levels in the fruit than 
fructose and glucose (Selvaraj et al., 1982; 
Chan et al., 1989). The variability in sugar 
concentrations at ripening varies among var￾ieties and growing conditions. Glucose, fruc￾tose and sucrose do not increase in ‘Sunset’ 
papaya until ≈112 DAA, about 1 month 
before ripening commences. Sucrose ac￾counts for 40–50% of total sugar in mature 
fruit just prior to ripening (Zhou and Paull, 
2001). Papaya needs a continuous supply of 
sugar for sweetness development during 
ripening on the tree, coming from photosyn￾thesis in the leaves (Paull et al., 2008). Fruits 
left to ripen on the tree have better sensorial 
quality than fruits harvested from the tree and 
left to ripen in storage. Moreover, papaya 
that remained attached to the tree showed 
postponed ripening parameters compared 
with papaya in storage (Fuggate et al., 2010; 
Schweiggert et al., 2011).
At the beginning of ripening, total 
amounts of sugars of 80.86 g kg-1 fresh weight 
(FW) and 72.42 g kg-1 FW were recorded in 
cultivars ‘Sel-42’ and ‘Tainung’, respectively, 
with glucose as the major sugar (Kelebek 
et al., 2015). Gomez et al. (2002) stated that 
‘Solo’ papaya does not accumulate starch

during its growth, with approximately 0.13% 
in green fruit and 0.06% in ripe fruit. It is 
assumed that galactose is used to synthesize 
sucrose because its levels decrease in the cell 
wall during ripening. The major soluble sugars 
in ripe fruits are glucose, fructose and su￾crose, with sucrose being the predominant 
sugar. During fruit ripening, the sucrose 
content increases from 13.9 mg g-1 FW in 
green fruit to 29.8 mg g-1 FW in ripe fruits.
The reducing sugars in ‘Golden’ papaya 
decreased from 10.8 g 100 g-1 FW to 8.3 g 
100 g-1 FW after 30 days storage at 13°C, and 
increased to 9.9 g 100 g-1 FW after an add￾itional 7 days of storage (Martins and Res￾ende, 2013). The total soluble sugars in 
‘Golden’ papaya increased 2.5-fold during 
ripening, coinciding with the respiration peak 
on the fourth day of storage. The sucrose 
level is higher in the early stages, but it de￾creases with the ripening process, enhan￾cing the glucose and fructose levels (Fabi 
et al., 2007). The reducing sugars (glucose and 
fructose) in ‘Solo’ papaya changed from 6.9 
g 100 g-1 FW to 8.9 g 100 g-1 FW during ripen￾ing, then decreased later after a storage period 
(Azen et al., 2014).
Changes in acidity
Non-volatile organic acids formed the major 
portion (about 80–90%) of total acidity in 
fruits. The concentration of total and non￾volatile acids decreased during fruit devel￾opment, reaching a minimum at the ripe stage 
(Selvaraj et al., 1982; Ghanta et al., 1994). 
Citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, oxalic 
acid, tartaric acid and fumaric acids are 
quantified in papaya cultivars ‘Sel-42’ and 
‘Tainung’, but the total organic acid content 
in ‘Sel-42’ (0.115%) is clearly greater than 
‘Tainung’ (0.086%). The major organic acids 
found in ripe papaya cultivar ‘Sel-42’ and 
cultivar ‘Tainung’ are, respectively, citric 
acid (379.5 and 349.3 mg 100 g-1 FW), L-malic 
acid (292.5 and 306.7 mg 100 g-1 FW) and 
ascorbic acid (71.7 and 67.3 mg 100 g-1 FW) 
(Kelebek et al., 2015). In ripe papaya fruit of 
cultivar ‘Baixinho de Santa Amalia’, Her￾nandez et al. (2009) found mainly the citric 
acid (335 mg 100 g-1 FW) and L-malic acid 
(209 mg 100 g-1 FW).
The titratable acidity of attached and 
detached ‘Pluk Mai Lie’ papaya ranges from 
0.11% to 0.13%, but it does not differ sig￾nificantly throughout the ripening process 
(Fuggate et al., 2010). Acidity of ‘Pococí’ pa￾paya drops from 1.6 g kg-1 (preharvest stage) 
to 1.1 g kg-1 FW (FR, full ripe stage), but change 
in pH was insignificant (Schweiggert et al., 
2011). In ‘Golden’ papaya stored at 23°C, 
the acidity increases from approximately 
0.045% at the CB stage to 0.062% in the ripe 
stage, which subsequently decreases due 
to metabolic consumption (Bron and Jacomi￾no, 2009). The changes in pH were provided 
by hydrogen ions from organic acids that re￾duce during the ripening process, mainly in 
‘Golden’ papaya harvested at the CB stage 
(Bron and Jacomino, 2006). In ‘Maradol’ pa￾paya (CB stage) stored at 25°C, the pH in￾creases from 5.38 to 5.55, while total acidity 
decreases from 0.24% to 0.09% after 9 days 
of storage (Chávez-Sánchez et al., 2013).
The pH value of ‘Solo’ papaya changes 
from 5.0 to 5.67 and acidity ranges from 
0.36% to 0.54%, when stored under ambient 
conditions. The early decrease in pH was 
associated with the production of acids from 
catabolism of sugar, but at the end of storage, 
the depletion of acidity is due to its use as 
respiratory substrates (Azene et al., 2014).
Ascorbic acid
The ascorbic acid content varies among 
Thailand genotypes, ranging from 569.9 mg 
kg-1 FW to 838.1 mg kg-1 FW, which are rela￾tively high compared to Costa Rican papaya 
genotypes, ranging from 249 mg kg-1 FW to 
696 mg kg-1 FW (Srimat et al., 2017). The 
papaya cultivar ‘Sel-42’ has 71.70 mg 100 g-1
FW whereas the cultivar ‘Tainung’ has 
67.30 mg 100 g-1 FW. The ascorbic acid con￾tent is affected by the type of soil where the 
plants are grown, the climate, cultivation 
practices and level of fruit ripeness (Kele￾bek et al., 2015). In the green stage, the as￾corbic acid content of Hawaii papaya (0.15 mg 
g-1 dry weight (DW)) was found to be lower 
than in Holland papaya (0.34 mg g-1 DW) 
but reaching 0.13 mg g-1 DW and 0.14 mg g-1
DW at the ripe stage, respectively, which was, 
however, considered a small amount of

vitamin C content in the fruit pulp (Siria￾mornpun and Kaewseejan, 2017).
The ascorbic acid increases by 20–30% 
during the ripening of ‘Golden’ papaya, 
independent of the maturity stage at har￾vest, reaching ≈1.0 g kg-1 FW at the ripe stage. 
Cell wall degradation that produces mannose 
and L-galactose during ripening may pro￾vide substrates for ascorbic acid synthesis 
(Bron and Jacomino, 2006).
The ascorbic acid content of ‘Solo’ pa￾paya varies from 39.7 mg 100 g-1 FW to 50.0 
mg 100 g-1 FW. As a general trend, the ascor￾bic acid content of papaya increases with 
ripening and it declines in the later ripe 
stage (Bron and Jacomino, 2006; Azene et al., 
2014). Martins and Resende (2013) found 
73.9 mg 100 g-1 FW in ‘Golden’ papaya (30% 
yellowish peel), increasing to 104.3 mg 100 g-1
FW after 30 days of storage at 13°C, with a 
sharp drop thereafter due to over-ripeness 
of the fruit.
Changes in pigments
The total carotenoid content in the pulp 
of red-pulped papaya cultivar ‘Pococí’ in￾creases almost 28-fold from 130 μg 100 g-1 FW 
to 3606 μg 100 g-1 FW during the preharvest 
stages. Carotenoid accumulation progresses 
during ripening to reach 5414 μg 100 g-1 FW 
at the ripe stage (under storage) or 5492 μg 
100 g-1 (ripe fruit on tree), respectively. Total 
lycopene and β-cryptoxanthin laurate show 
the most significant increase, reaching 
2685–3168 μg 100 g-1 FW and 640–775 μg 
100 g-1 FW at the ripe stage, under storage or 
on-tree ripening, respectively. Lycopene is 
an important intermediate in the biosyn￾thesis of vitamin A precursor carotenoids like 
β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin (Schweiggert 
et al., 2011).
The lycopene content in detached ‘Marad￾ol’ papaya increases from 1.5 mg kg-1 FW (CB 
stage) to 12 mg kg-1 FW after ripening, whereas 
β-cryptoxanthin changes from 3.1 mg kg-1 FW 
to 8.0 mg kg-1 FW, corresponding to the orange￾red flesh colour. β-Carotene levels remained 
in a range of 2.3–3.1 mg kg-1 FW (Rivera-Pastrana 
et al., 2010). The three main carotenoids, 
all-trans-lycopene, all-trans-β-cryptoxanthin 
and all-trans-β-carotene, contribute to the 
colour of ‘Golden’ papaya pulp and all of 
them increase during ripening; all-trans￾lycopene being the most abundant one with 
an increment of 2.5-fold, reaching 1200 μg 
mg-1 FW on the fifth day of storage at 25°C 
(Fabi et al., 2007).
Twenty-one carotenoids were identified 
in ‘Golden’ papaya. Lycopene is the major 
carotenoid, followed by β-cryptoxanthin. 
Total carotenoids increase from 709.4 μg 
100 g-1 (at the early stage) to 2194.4 μg 100 
g-1 at the full-ripe stage, with lycopene ran￾ging from 461.5 μg 100 g-1 FW to 1321.6 μg 
100 g-1 FW. Lycopene biosynthesis is a cli￾macteric-related step non-dependent of 
ethylene (Barreto et al., 2011).
Volatile compounds
Among the volatile components typically pre￾sent in papaya cultivar ‘MaradolRoja’, alco￾hols (e.g. butanol, 3-methylbutanol, benzyl 
alcohol and α-terpineol) increase from the 
green stage to the totally ripe stage and di￾minish thereafter (over-ripe). Esters (e.g. 
methyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl 
dodecanoate) also increase during ripening 
(Almora et al., 2004). The presence of esters 
was found to be negligible at the CB stage of 
‘Pluk Mai Lie’ papaya, but dramatically in￾creased at the late ripening stages, following 
ethylene production. The esters produced in 
detached fruit were about tenfold higher than 
those in on-tree fruit. Alcohols, one of the 
critical substrates for ester production, in￾creased steadily throughout the ripening 
process (Fuggate et al., 2010).
A total of 46 and 42 aroma compounds 
have been identified in ‘Sel-42’ and ‘Tainung’ 
varieties, respectively. The total concentra￾tion of aroma compounds in ‘Tainung’ 
(4687.0 μg kg-1) was higher than in ‘Sel-42’ 
(4099.7 μg kg-1). Acids were present in the 
highest levels, followed by esters, but acids 
are not considered to be important contribu￾tors to the overall flavour of papayas. Tetra￾decanoic acid (1627 μg kg-1) was found as 
the most abundant acid in cultivar ‘Tainung’, 
whereas hexadecanoic acid was most abundant 
in cultivar ‘Sel-42’ (803 μg kg-1). Esters contrib￾ute to the strong fruity and floral odour. Nine 
esters were identified in ‘Tainung’ (total content

970.3 μg kg-1), and eight in ‘Sel-42’ (994.1 μg 
kg-1) (Kelebek et al., 2015). Thirty-six aroma 
compounds were identified in mountain 
papaya fruit. The main compounds produced 
are esters and alcohols. The major compounds 
identified in ripe fruit are ethyl acetate, ethyl 
butanoate, methyl butanoate and butyl acetate, 
comprising 88% of the volatiles. There was a 
7.1-fold increase after 11 days storage, reaching 
91.2 μg kg-1 of total esters and 5.48 μg kg-1 of 
total alcohols (Balbontín et al., 2007).
Phenolic compounds
The content and composition of phenolic 
acids changes with types, cultivars and 
maturity of the fruit and decreases with the 
ripening stage. In papaya there are five hy￾droxybenzoic acids (gallic, protocatechuic, 
p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and syringic) 
and five hydroxycinnamic acids (chorogen￾ic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic). 
Gallic acid and protocatechuic acid were 
found to be dominant in Hawaii and Holland 
papayas, with levels of gallic acid being 
0.1–0.7 mg g-1 DW and 0.2–0.5 mg g-1 DW, 
respectively. The total flavonoids in green 
Hawaii papaya (92.7 mg g-1 DW) were higher 
than in ripe fruit (52.3 mg g-1 DW). Myrice￾tin is the main flavonoid in Hawaii papaya, 
with 76.96 mg g-1 DW in green fruit and 17.10 
mg g-1 DW at the ripe stage (Siriamornpun 
and Kaewseejan, 2017).
A total of 12 phenolic compounds were 
quantified in papaya cultivars ‘Sel-42’ and 
‘Tainung’. The total phenolic compounds were 
higher in ‘Sel-42’ (171.68 mg 100 g-1 FW) than 
in ‘Tainung’ (119.79 mg 100 g-1 FW). Protocat￾echuic acid-hexoside, gallic acid-deoxyhex￾oside, ferulic acid and chlorogenic acids were 
reported as the most abundant phenolics in 
both the cultivars (Kelebek et al., 2015).
The three main phenolics in ‘Maradol’ 
papaya were ferulic acid (1.33 g kg-1 DW), 
caffeic acid (0.46 g kg-1 DW) and rutin (0.10 
g kg-1 DW) (Rivera-Pastrana et al., 2010). 
Total phenolic were higher in the pulp of 
‘Maradol’ papaya at the CB stage (85.8 mg 
gallic acid 100 g-1 FW), decreasing to 72.0 
mg 100 g-1 at day 5, but increasing to 93.5 
mg 100 g-1 FW after 15 days storage at 14°C. 
The total flavonoid content was, however, 
found to be higher in pulp at CB (15.6 mg 
quercetin equivalent (QE) 100 g-1 FW), de￾creasing to 7.7 mg QE 100 g-1 FW at day 5, 
but it increased to 11.5 mg QE 100 g-1 FW after 
15 days storage at 14°C (Rivera-Pastrana et al., 
2014). The total phenolic compounds in 
‘Eksotika’ papaya pulp ranged from 11.20 mg 
gallic acid 100 g-1 FW (before CB, 84 DAA) 
to 60.40 mg gallic acid 100 g-1 FW (CB, 140 
DAA). The total flavonoid compounds also 
increased from 22.53 mg QE 100 g-1 FW (84 
DAA) to 38.12 mg QE 100 g-1 FW (at CB) 
(Addai et al., 2013).
Biochemistry of ripening
Papaya ripening is a physiological phenom￾enon that changes important sensorial qual￾ities, such as pulp and peel colour, texture, 
flavour and aroma (Fabi et al., 2007). As in 
other climacteric fruit, the beginning of the 
ripening process is accompanied by an 
increase in respiration and ethylene pro￾duction. The ethylene production induces 
diverse molecular mechanisms that are 
responsible for increasing gene expression 
of ripening-related genes in papayas (Fabi 
et al., 2012).
One crucial sensorial alteration that hap￾pens during papaya ripening is the peel and 
pulp softening. A lot of research has been done 
in this area, since the ethylene-induced tex￾tural changes during papaya ripening not only 
prepares the fruit to be consumed but also 
influences the postharvest losses (Manrique 
and Lajolo, 2004). The firmness of papaya 
pulp is due to plant cell wall structure and to 
the turgor pressure inside vacuoles that are 
sustained by primary cell wall architecture 
between plant cells and the cellular adhesion 
junction zones (Wang et al., 2018). These 
texture alterations result from complex en￾zymatic machinery that modify the plant 
cell wall architecture through solubilization 
of polysaccharides (mainly pectin) from in￾soluble to water-soluble fractions of papaya 
pulp (Prado et al., 2016).
The papaya pectin is a group of poly￾saccharides with a structural backbone of a 
central chain of α-1,4-D-galacturonic acids 
(GalA) with acetyl and methyl esterifications 
(homogalacturonan). There are also other

minor structures called rhamnogalacturonan 
type I and II and xylogalacturonan (Prado 
et al., 2017, 2019). The higher molecular 
weights (long chains) of the homogalacturo￾nan structures and the egg-box structures 
(where non-methylated portions of pectin are 
bounded to each other by calcium bridges) 
are insoluble in water making the pulp of 
unripe papaya very hard and crispy (Fabi 
et al., 2007; Prado et al., 2016).
One theory that accounts for papaya 
pulp softening during ripening is based on 
the central role of polygalacturonases (PGs) 
in degrading pectin (Fabi et al., 2014). There 
is also a possibility of hemicellulose deg￾radation, since endoxylanases and β-ga￾lactanases genes and proteins are upregulated 
during papaya ripening (Lazan et al., 2004; 
Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2012). PGs are endo￾enzymes that hydrolyse the non-methylated 
GalA from homogalacturonan portions pre￾sented in papaya pectin. During papaya 
ripening, four PG genes are identified as 
being responsible for pectin hydrolysis lead￾ing to cell wall disassembling (Fabi et al., 
2014, Prado et al., 2016), with the PG1 gene 
being the main one responsible for the fast 
pulp softening. This gene was identified as 
being dependent on ethylene since not only 
did exogenous treatment with this plant hor￾mone induce PG1 expression with a con￾comitant pulp softening but also ethylene 
blockage by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) 
precluded PG1 expression with no pulp 
softening (Fabi et al., 2009). In fact, experi￾ments with 1-MCP-treated papayas had al￾ways pinpointed a decreased or abolished 
pulp softening (Fabi et al., 2007, 2009; 
Sañudo-Barajas et al., 2009). However, when 
PG1 was transiently expressed in 1-MCP-treated 
papayas through agroinfiltration, the fruit 
pulp was significantly softened when com￾pared to 1-MCP-treated papayas that were 
agroinfiltrated with an empty vector (Fabi 
et al., 2014).
These alterations in the pulp cell wall 
during papaya ripening are a consequence 
of the PG action and the decrease in the 
molecular weight of those homogalacturonan 
long-chain polysaccharides (Lazan et al., 
1995; Manrique and Lajolo, 2004; Shiga 
et al., 2009; Prado et al., 2017). The PG 
activity leads to a massive mobilization of 
high molecular weight pectin from the less 
soluble fractions to more soluble fractions 
(in water). This event affects mainly the 
pectin that is tightly bound to each other by 
the calcium bridges and also the pectin bound 
to cellulose/hemicellulose (Prado et al., 
2016, 2019).
A remarkable characteristic of papaya 
is that the more soluble pectin (in water) ex￾tracted from ripe fruit is highly methylated 
(Prado et al., 2017, 2019). It is thought that 
the water-soluble fraction is enriched 
with highly methylated and low molecular 
weight pectin that arises from the insoluble 
fraction because of the massive PG activity 
during papaya ripening. Since the expres￾sions of pectinesterase genes are decreased 
during ripening and the PG activity is given 
in the non-methylated ‘hot-zones’ of pectin, 
it is likely that the action of pectinesterases 
is concluded before harvesting (Fabi et al., 
2010, 2012, 2014; Prado et al., 2016). How￾ever, new studies should be undertaken to 
confirm this.
The sweet pulp of ripe papayas is very 
important for its sensorial quality and this 
is a consequence of the massive presence of 
soluble sugars. Sucrose is mainly synthe￾sized during fruit development when the 
fruit is attached to the plant because of the 
action of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) 
and sucrose synthase (SS) (Zhou and Paull, 
2001). Moreover, since the content of starch 
is low in unripe papaya pulp, sucrose is the 
main source of soluble sugars in the post￾harvesting period (Oboh et al., 2015). Dur￾ing postharvest ripening, the acid invertase 
cleaves the sucrose into glucose and fruc￾tose making the pulp sweeter while soften￾ing caused by PG action increases the sweet 
sensation (Gomez et al., 1999, 2002). The 
genes for invertases and for other enzymes 
related to sugar metabolism in papayas (UDP￾galactose transporter 3, sugar transporter 
and β-fructofuranosidase) are upregulated 
during normal ripening and after ethylene 
treatment and downregulated in 1-MCP-treated 
papayas, demonstrating that the soluble sugar 
metabolism is intrinsically related to ethyl￾ene triggering (Fabi et al., 2010; Nogueira 
et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2017).

Another sensorial attribute that is very 
important for the postharvest papaya is the 
characteristic flavour. This is due to ripening￾related production of a complex mixture 
of volatile compounds such as terpenes, 
esters, alcohols and ketones (Jing et al., 
2015; Kelebek et al., 2015). One special ter￾pene compound is noticeably very import￾ant for the ripe papaya flavour, the linalool. 
This compound and its oxidized derivatives 
are found to be the major components of 
flavour in diverse cultivars of ripe papayas, 
followed by esters with a low molecular 
profile, such as methyl and ethyl butanoate 
(Gomes et al., 2016; Lieb et al., 2018). As 
happens with pulp softening and sweetening, 
ethylene has a pivotal role in the synthesis 
of papaya flavour compounds. Ethylene treat￾ment stimulated the synthesis of volatile 
esters derived from fatty acids and amino 
acids metabolism in the same way as it oc￾curs for melons (Li et al., 2016) while 1-MCP 
treatment suppressed their production (Bal￾bontín et al., 2007). Moreover, cold storage 
of papayas decreased the expression of a 
linalool synthase resulting in low levels of 
linalool synthesis, even when papayas were 
left to ripen normally after cold treatment 
(Gomes et al., 2016).
The distinct cultivars of papayas could 
show different sets of pulp colour, ranging 
from yellow to orange-red. The papaya col￾our is due to the presence of carotenoids that 
are synthesized during fruit development 
but with altered quantity during ripening 
(Barreto et al., 2011). Lycopene and β-carotene 
are the main carotenoids in red-pulp and 
yellow-pulp papayas, respectively (Martins 
et al., 2016). In the latter, the lack of lyco￾pene accumulation is due to the conversion 
of phytoene to xanthophylls and β-carotene 
by several enzymes, such as phytoenedesat￾urase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), 
lycopene β-cyclases (LCY-β) and carotene 
hydroxylases (Blas et al., 2010; Shen et al., 
2019). In red-pulp papayas the ethylene 
burst inhibits the conversion of lycopene 
into cyclic carotenoids because of the LCY-β
inhibition, thus accumulating lycopene 
(Barreto et al., 2011; Martins et al., 2016; 
Shen et al., 2019). Moreover, in red-pulp pa￾payas there is a mutation in the LCY-β2 gene 
that leads to a dysfunctional enzyme decreas￾ing the β-carotene synthesis and enhancing 
the lycopene quantity (Shen et al., 2017). As 
1-MCP-treated papayas showed lower levels 
of carotenoids, one could speculate that ethyl￾ene triggering is fundamental to papaya col￾our development. In fact, a transcription factor 
of the NAC (NAM, ATAF1, 2 and CUC2) 
family (CpNAC1), that is upregulated by ethyl￾ene triggering, is responsible for PDS upreg￾ulation in papayas (Fu et al., 2016, 2017).
The ethylene burst in papayas is con￾trolled by the system II autocatalytic mech￾anism as in most climacteric fruit (Liu et al., 
2015). It has been already noticed that the 
increased expression of 1-aminocyclopro￾pane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) and 
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxi￾dase (ACO) in papayas during ripening are 
responsible for the ethylene burst (López￾Gómez and Guzmán, 2010). When ethylene 
is blocked, ACS and ACO gene expression 
is almost abolished (Razali et al., 2013) while 
decreased expression in both sets of genes is 
observed when papayas are stored at low 
temperatures (Zou et al., 2014).
There are several transcription factors 
responsible for ethylene triggering in papaya 
ripening. One set of them is the ethylene re￾sponse factors (ERFs) that are involved in 
diverse physiological events in plants, such 
as growth, defence, responses to the envir￾onment and response to hormones (Xie 
et al., 2016). In papayas, there are some ERF 
genes involved in the ripening process (Li 
et al., 2013). Other types of transcription fac￾tors such as MADS-box, NAC and AP2/ERF 
gene families are also involved not only in 
the control of climacteric fruit ripening (Liu 
et al., 2015) but also in papaya ripening (Fabi 
et al., 2012). More recently, the FruitENCODE 
project pinpointed a key transcription factor 
gene – the same NAC as stated above (CpN￾AC1) – that is responsible for triggering the 
ethylene burst (Lü et al., 2018). Rather than 
a set of MADS transcription factors – more 
often found in the regulation of climacteric 
fruit that underwent recent genome dupli￾cations – the papaya NAC gene regulates 
ACS and ACO expression at the onset of the 
ethylene burst throughout papaya ripening 
(Lü et al., 2018). This regulation is governed

by an autocatalytic positive feedback circuit 
loop, in which the NAC protein binds to the 
promoter regions of several ripening-related 
genes altering their expression and culmin￾ating in changes related to the quality of ripe 
papayas, such as a softened, sweet and colour￾ful pulp (Fabi et al., 2014; Lü et al., 2018).
11.3 Conclusion
Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is trioecius (i.e. 
male, female and hermaphrodite plants 
coexist); hermaphrodite individuals being 
preferred for commercial reasons, although 
they frequently show flower alterations of 
different types leading to the production of 
non-commercial fruits. Flower types are de￾termined at early flower initiation, a period 
between 6 weeks and 10 weeks from anthe￾sis depending on temperature. Given the 
important effect on commercialization and 
profits, tracking back environmental condi￾tions that favour the production of missha￾pen fruits is of the utmost interest.
Female papayas, by contrast, show few 
flower variations and have high potential 
for parthenocarpy. However, although seed￾less, female papaya is less preferred due to 
its rounded shape and large ovarian cavity. 
Hermaphrodite flowers are autogamous. 
Flower size and seed number determine to 
some extent fruit size at harvest. Papaya fruit 
grows following a single sigmoid model and 
takes between 100 days and 300 days to ripen 
from blooming, depending on the cultivar, 
the location and the season. The precise de￾termination of heat requirements of the dif￾ferent cultivars may allow farmers to pro￾gramme sowing dates and select adequate 
plantation sites for harvesting at more prof￾itable dates, especially if environmental 
conditions can be controlled as in green￾houses with climate control equipment.
The monopodial growth habit of pa￾paya makes greenhouse cultivation of vigor￾ous cultivars complicated as the plant sets 
its first fruits 1 m above the ground. Breed￾ing papaya to obtain varieties that reach the 
adult phase at a lower trunk height is highly 
desirable, as is affordable vegetative propa￾gation of elite genotypes.
Early leaf removal, which is often per￾formed in papaya as the plant grows, is dis￾couraged due to the negative effects on growth, 
flowering, setting and fruit quality. The 
removal of fruit (i.e. thinning) has moderate 
effects on the fruit quality of the remaining 
fruits, highlighting the high set potential of 
papaya plants.
Papaya ripening is a physiological 
phenomenon that changes fruit texture, col￾our, flavour and aroma, thus increasing the 
attraction of seed-dispersing organisms. 
These alterations are triggered by the auto￾catalytic biosynthesis of ethylene during 
climacteric ripening. PGs are the main eth￾ylene-dependent enzymes responsible for 
fruit softening, giving the ripe fruit the ideal 
texture to be consumed, but increasing the 
postharvest susceptibility to biotic and abiotic 
injuries. Sucrose, carotenoid and linalool 
metabolisms are also important to reach the 
characteristic sweetness, redness/yellowness 
and aroma of papayas. This is all controlled 
by the coordinated expression of light- and 
time-dependent transcription factors that 
lead to the expression of sensorial-changing 
enzymes. It is very difficult to biochem￾ically manipulate this set of transcription 
factors. However, understanding the gene 
expression that controls the final chain of 
events involved in papaya ripening could 
be beneficial as by decreasing ethylene pro￾duction and its perception through use of 
chemicals, temperature and modifying the 
atmosphere it may be possible to decrease 
postharvest losses.

12.1 Introduction
Physiological disorders of papaya can be 
recognized as abnormal growth conditions, 
either outside or inside the fruits, thus affect￾ing the appearance and flavour qualities of the 
fruits and eventually their marketability. The 
disorders are not caused by pathogens or mech￾anical damage. They develop in response to the 
plant’s genetic characteristics, environmental 
stresses including adverse temperature, light 
and moisture content during preharvest and/or 
postharvest, or to the soil’s unfavourable con￾ditions and nutritional deficiencies during 
growth and development. Exposure to envir￾onmental stresses lead to disturbances of physio￾logical processes in the fruit tissues, exhibiting 
symptoms of rot, bumpiness, carpellody, 
chilling and heat injury, deformation, discol￾oration, lumpiness, softening, freckles and blem￾ishes, scald, browning and gelling. The disorders 
cause productivity, quality and worldwide eco￾nomic losses to the papaya crop and industry.
12.2 Disorders
12.2.1 Blossom end defect
A non-pathological disorder seen in mar￾keted fruit is blossom end defect (Akamine, 
1966). These defects result from abnormal 
placental growth near the blossom end of the 
fruit (Zee et al., 1989). The disorder can be 
characterized as an opening with a diameter 
of more than 7 mm that extends all the way 
to the seed cavity of the fruit and leaves an 
open channel at the blossom end of the fruit 
seed cavity. This is caused by a developmen￾tal failure of placental growth to close the 
stigma canal during early fruit development 
(Paull et al., 1997) when the carpel at the style 
end of the ovary occasionally fails to fuse 
completely (Zee et al., 1989).
Blossom end defects are classified accord￾ing to the diameter of the opening as: (i) small 
pinhole (hole ~1 mm); (ii) large pinhole 
(hole >1 mm); and (iii) navel (similar to the 
blossom end of a navel orange) (Liquido, 
1990). It was observed that there was no sig￾nificant interaction between fruit infested 
with fruit fly eggs and the size of the open￾ing of the blossom end defect. The defect 
will cause the papaya to be susceptible to 
bacterial diseases in the seed cavity before 
normal harvest, and affected fruit will ripen 
earlier. Oriental fruit fly and melon fly 
normally oviposit in areas outside of the 
blossom end (Liquido, 1990). Percentage in￾festation rates of oriental fruit fly in normal 
fruits and in those with a blossom end defect 
are the same for mature green to colour-break

fruits, but quarter-ripe to fully-ripe fruits 
with blossom end defect have a higher per￾centage infestation rate by oriental fruit fly 
than normal fruits.
Blossom end defect can be severe at certain 
times of the year (Zee et al., 1989). The influ￾ence of climatic factors has suggested a low 
incidence in the field and the defect appears 
seasonally (Zee et al., 1989; Paull et al., 1997). 
Thus, only a few studies have been reported. 
In tomatoes, blossom end rot has been related 
to low calcium and high potassium fertiliza￾tion of tomato plants (Ho et al., 1993).
Hot water treatment has been applied in 
treating this problem. In rare cases, when the 
fruit-fly deposited its eggs in the blossom end 
opening, the eggs would hatch causing the 
larvae to move from the opening to the seed 
cavity and escape the hot water treatment 
(Liquido, 1990). Double-dip hot water immer￾sion involved one-quarter ripe fruit being 
immersed in water at 42°C for 30 min and 
continuing with a second immersion at 49°C 
for 20 min. The fruits were then immediately 
cooled to a temperature less than 30°C with 
ambient water dips or sprays. The one-quarter 
ripe fruit are expected not to contain the 
third instar larvae of fruit flies. Nevertheless, 
the blossom end defects allowed the fruit 
flies to oviposit in the papaya at an earlier 
stage than normal and for larger larvae than 
the first instar to be found deeper in the 
pulp than usual (Zee et al., 1989).
12.2.2 Bumpy fruit
Bumpy fruit was identified as a new physio￾logical disorder of papaya under diverse 
agroclimatic conditions (Saha, 2007; Saran 
et al., 2014). The bumpy fruit condition is first 
noticed as extreme distortion on the mature 
fruit surface. In young fruits, the symptoms 
include milky latex exudation from the fruit 
surface which later turns brown. In older 
fruits, the skin becomes distorted and ex￾hibits a bumpy surface (Fig. 12.1). Different 
nutrient deficiencies such as boron, zinc 
and sulfur, and environmental stresses were 
believed to be the factors causing bumpy 
fruit, which may lead to deformed/discol￾oured seeds.
Deformity first starts in young fruits, 
but symptoms become more severe in fruits 
close to physiological ripening or of older 
age. The bumpiness begins in areas on the 
fruit epidermis and is due to boron defi￾ciency, stopping the fruit growth (Wang and 
Ko, 1975; Chen and Raveendranathan, 1984). 
In addition to this, affected tissue continues 
increasing in size and ends forming a protu￾berance or ‘bump’, similar to a ball. High 
incidence before maturity has also been a 
severe concern in papaya production.
Observations have revealed that the tem￾perature during fruit development and seed 
maturation play an important role in bumpy 
fruit development. Besides temperature, boron 
deficiency is one of the major causes that limits 
yields in papaya as it results in malformed fruits. 
Applications of boron as boric acid in boron￾deficient soil corrected boron deficiency and 
increased petiole boron levels to prevent defi￾ciency symptoms on fruit (Naqvi, 2004). Spray￾ing of 0.1% boric acid at 3-month intervals 
from the sixth month after planting onwards 
corrected the deficiency (Jeyakumar, 2011).
12.2.3 Carpellody

used to describe the fusion of stamens to 
the ovary in hermaphrodite flowers. Fruits

developed from such flowers have unsightly 
longitudinal scars indicating the area of adna￾tion and fusion of the androecium to the ovary. 
Such fruits are generally misshapen, or ‘cat￾faced’ and are generally unmarketable (Chan, 
1984). Carpelloid structures enhance par￾thenocarpic fruit development, while the de￾velopment of carpelloid structures is enhanced 
in the absence of seed set (Vivian-Smith, 2001).
A model was postulated indicating the 
role of fertility, aberrant ovules and carpel￾loid growth in parthenocarpic fruit set and 
development. Carpelloid development posi￾tively reinforces fruit growth, particularly in 
genotypes showing parthenocarpic potential. 
Abnormal ovules may convert into a carpel￾loid structure. However, the growth of car￾pelloid structures only becomes prominent in 
the absence of fertilization, indicating fertil￾ity as an important determinant of their de￾velopment. In agreement with this model, it 
reduced fertility and developed more car￾pelloid structures. Upon fertilization, normal 
seed development occurs, inducing fruit set 
but possibly suppressing carpelloid prolif￾eration. Facultative parthenocarpy is widely 
present in papaya genotypes, and the absence 
of fertilization allows the parthenocarpic 
potential to be expressed, and at the same 
time induces carpelloid proliferation, pos￾sibly following the homeotic transformation 
of abnormal ovules (Vivian-Smith, 2001).
Carpellody is believed to be an abnormality 
of genetic origin and influenced by environ￾mental factors, such as low temperature, ele￾vated moisture and excess nitrogen in the 
soil (Nishijima, 1998; Marin and Gomes, 
2000). Since carpellody is an inherited trait, 
careful seed selection and orchard manage￾ment can reduce its occurrence. The ‘Solo’ cul￾tivar has a lower incidence of carpellody.
12.2.4 Chilling injury
Papaya is a tropical fruit and is very suscep￾tible to chilling injury if fruits are stored 
at 5°C and 10°C for 10 days and 15 days, 
respectively, while fruits stored at 15°C 
showed chilling injury symptoms after 20 
days of storage (Shakila and Anburani, 
2010). The symptoms of chilling injury include 
pitting (Fig. 12.2), failure to ripen, off-flavour 
development and accelerated decay (Kader 
and Yahia, 2011). However, symptoms of 
chilling injury vary among the cultivars 
(Table 12.1). Recommended safe temperat￾ures for the fruit ranged from 10°C to 13°C 
with relative humidity between 90% and 
95% (Paull et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2007). 
However, chilling injury still occurred under 
such conditions due to the duration of ex￾posure to low storage temperature and level 
of fruit maturity (Singh and Sundhakar Rao, 
2011). Papaya fruit stored at temperatures 
below 10°C tends to develop chilling injury 
symptoms within 14 days of storage.
The best practice to control chilling 
injury is by storing the fruit at a suitable 
storage temperature and duration. The opti￾mum storage temperature of papaya fruit is 
greatly affected by fruit maturity (Sivakumar 
and Wall, 2013). Mature green fruit should 
be stored at a temperature above 10°C for 
less than 14 days while fruit at half or quar￾ter ripe should be stored above 7°C for no 
longer than 20 days. Fully ripe papaya can 
be stored between 1°C and 3°C for less than 
a week’s duration (Paull et al., 1999; Chen 
et al., 2007). Application of hot water dips 
and vapour heat treatments can enhance the 
tolerance to chilling injury in papaya fruit. 
Shadmani et al. (2015) showed that papaya 
fruit treated with double-dip hot water 
treatment at 42°C and 49°C for 30 min and

20 min, respectively, can reduce the chill￾ing injury due to an increase in fruit ascor￾bate peroxidase activity, when stored at 6°C 
for 3 weeks. Hasbullah et al. (2008) con￾cluded that vapour heat treatment at 46.5°C 
for 30 min is the best treatment to reduce 
chilling injury and maintain papaya fruit 
quality for 3 weeks. Chilling injury symp￾toms were also alleviated by using modified 
atmosphere packaging (Kader and Yahia, 
2011; Sivakumar and Wall, 2013). ‘Eksotika’ 
papaya wrapped with a thick low-density 
polyethene bag together with ethylene￾absorbent sachets can reduce the incidence 
of chilling injury and extend fruit shelf life 
to 3–4 weeks when the fruits are wrapped in 
bulk (ten fruits per pack) and to 5–6 weeks 
for individually wrapped fruit (Rohani et al., 
1997).
12.2.5 Deformed/discoloured seeds
The physiological quality of seeds, such as 
the irregular and slow germination of pa￾paya seeds, has become an obstacle to farm￾ers. A positive relationship between average 
monthly minimum temperature and per￾centage deformed seeds was observed in 
Hawaii from December to May during the 
years 2008–2013. The increased incidence 
of deformed seeds was observed from Feb￾ruary to May when the monthly tempera￾ture first increased and then decreased 
during the harvesting months. The maximum 
incidence was observed during February 
due to the earlier lower January temperature 
during which the seeds mature in fruits 
to be harvested in February. Thus, the low 
temperatures during the period of seed mat￾uration aggravate the occurrence of deformed 
seeds (Saran et al., 2014).
The high incidence of deformed seeds 
may be due to lower temperature during the 
seed maturation period (January) in the 
autumn-sown crop in Hawaii. The stress as￾sociated with bumpy fruits may aggravate the 
incidence of deformed seeds in ‘Pusa Dwarf’ 
papaya. The natural occurrence of precocious 
germination has been reported in papaya 
(Balakrishnan et al., 1986). These observa￾tions have revealed that the temperature 
during the seed maturation period plays an 
important role. Low and high temperatures 
during the seed maturation period aggravate 
the occurrence of deformed seeds and viv￾iparous seeds, respectively.
12.2.6 Hard lumps in pulp
Hard lumps in papaya pulp have been de￾scribed as the formation of a distinct, marked 
area of the mesocarp tissues which is harder 
when compared with the surrounding areas 
of the pulp. The disorder is only exhibited 
inside the pulp while on the outer surface, 
affected fruit could not be differentiated 
from unaffected fruit. The occurrence of 
this disorder is unpredictable and has been

related to weather conditions, particularly 
high temperatures (Oliveira and Vitória, 
2011). In Brazil, when the summer tempera￾ture is at its highest, hard lumps have been 
reported to affect papaya at ripening stages I 
and II when yellowing was up to 25% of 
surface area. The susceptibility to hard lumps 
increased during the winter months in 
Hawaii and was highly correlated with the 
postharvest hydrothermal treatment per￾formed for fruit-fly larval disinfestation and 
to control diseases (Paull, 1995). The occur￾rence of this disorder is infrequent in other￾wise ripe, non-heated fruit (Magalona, 1964; 
Cavaletto, 1989). The disorder is also asso￾ciated with insect injury, disease or other 
foreign material in the flesh. The hard lump 
that occurs in the pulp around the vascular 
bundles is due to chilling injury symptoms 
when the fruit is stored under 5°C for 14 days 
for mature green fruit and 1°C for 21 days 
for yellow fruit (Arisumi, 1956; El-Tomi et al., 
1974). Chilling injury symptoms include 
skin scald, hard lumps in the pulp around 
the vascular bundles and water soaking of 
flesh (Thompson and Lee, 1971; El-Tomi 
et al., 1974; Chen and Paull, 1986).
High temperature triggers the activation 
of a degradation enzyme in the cell wall 
which inhibits the emission of ethylene and 
alters the colour of papaya skin and pulp 
(Paull, 1995). During fruit formation and 
ripening, natural temperature oscillation 
causes acquisition of thermotolerance but 
very high temperature causes stress to the 
plant which triggers hard lumps in the pulp. 
The stress could be controlled by achieving 
thermotolerance that can be stimulated arti￾ficially (Paull, 1990) or naturally by condi￾tions in the growing environment (Paull, 
1995; Oliveira and Vitória, 2011). Produc￾tion of a heat shock protein plays a crucial 
role in thermotolerance as the heat shock 
protein can prevent the denaturing or aggre￾gation of other proteins induced under ther￾mal stress (Queitsch et al., 2000).
12.2.7 Heat injury
Heat injury occurs as a result of heat treatments 
to control pests and diseases of papaya. The 
most common external symptoms that occur 
are discoloration and darkening of the 
peel and induced senescence. The internal 
symptoms include: (i) failure of the fruit to 
soften fully or softening occurs at a reduced 
rate; (ii) water loss; and (iii) darkening of 
pulp colour (Lurie, 1998; Pimentel et al., 
2007). Heat injury is evidenced by clearly 
marked mesocarp tissues that are firmer 
compared with the neighbouring tissues, 
without any external symptoms that differ￾entiate it from normal fruits (Oliveira and 
Vitória, 2011). The exposure temperature 
and duration, and how quickly the fruit is 
cooled following the heat treatment deter￾mine the extent of heat injury to the papaya 
(Paull, 1995; Lurie, 1998; Pimentel et al., 2007; 
Fan et al., 2011).
At the cellular level, heat injury causes 
disruption of protein synthesis, denaturation 
of protein, alteration of the peel colour, cli￾macteric respiration, ethylene production, 
and loss of membrane integrity (Lurie, 1998; 
Paull and Chen, 2000; Oliveira and Vitória, 
2011). Protein denaturation at lethal temper￾atures is regarded as non-reversible while 
heat injury at lower temperatures may still 
be reversible.
Different postharvest hydrothermal 
treatments reduce pulp firmness and in￾crease the production of metabolic gases in 
ripening ‘Golden’ papaya indicating the 
high sensitivity of papaya pulp to heat 
stress (Corrêa et al., 2012). High preharvest 
orchard temperatures may naturally pro￾mote a tolerance response in fruits that are 
exposed to high postharvest hydrothermal 
treatments, thereby reducing heat injury. 
When the average temperature of the 3 days 
before harvest is between 17°C and 31°C, 
there is a significant increase in the resist￾ance of papaya to damage caused by ex￾posure to temperatures of 49°C (standard 
disinfestation treatment: 48 ± 1°C for 
20  min) (Paull, 1995). However, preharvest 
factors related to plantation management 
(such as calcium availability) may encour￾age the incidence of heat injury in papayas. 
Fruit with high calcium levels in the meso￾carp was found to be more sensitive to 
heat and more susceptible to heat injury 
(Paull, 1995).

Strategies to increase thermotolerance 
of fruit include the use of preconditioning 
procedures, such as exposure to elevated, 
sublethal temperatures which induces 
thermotolerance and protects fruit from a 
second exposure to a normally higher tem￾perature. Papaya fruit softening caused by 
heat treatment is reduced or prevented with 
a pretreatment at 42°C for 1 h, or by varying 
the pretreatment time to 38°C, with both 
treatments followed by a 3 h rest at 22°C 
(Paull and Chen, 1990).
12.2.8 Intra-ovarian ovaries
Intra-ovarian ovaries, formally known as 
‘intra-ovarial’ is a common physiological 
disorder of hermaphrodite fruits in some 
papaya varieties. The disorder cannot be 
determined externally, as it is only visible 
after the papaya fruit is cut open (Bergman, 
1921; Oliveira et al., 2019) (Fig. 12.3). The 
intra-ovarian ovaries in papaya fruit de￾velop near to the basal stem in the fruit cav￾ity, and can contain about four to five mini 
papaya-like fruits or so-called ‘secondary 
fruit’ of various sizes and shape (Zhou et al., 
2014). The tissues of intra-ovarian ovaries 
grow rapidly into thread-like appendages or 
round and elongated structures of various 
sizes that sometimes occupy the entire fruit 
cavity, each having its own cavity filled with 
seeds (Ram, 2005).
The colour of the enclosed secondary 
fruit is slightly paler yellow compared with 
a normal fruit. The cross section of the 
structure of the secondary fruit looks like a 
normal fruit, except there is no wax coating 
and a thinner epidermis (Oliveira et al., 2019). 
Microscopic examination of the cellular 
structure of the epidermis of the secondary 
fruit shows that it comprises cells similar in 
structure, but somewhat larger than epider￾mal cells of normal fruit (Bergman, 1921). 
This disorder does not develop from the 
metamorphosed ovules that occur on the pla￾centa. However, it may be initiated from 
buds that develop unexpectedly in places 
normally occupied by ovules. Internal 
ovaries in several stages of development 
can initiate either from rudimentary pistil￾late structures extending from the central 
axis of the receptacle or from the placenta in 
positions normally occupied by ovules. 
The hypertrophies of intra-ovarian ovaries 
include: (i) rudimentary pistil-like struc￾ture at the base of the fruit cavity; (ii) ex￾cised internal pistils of various shapes and 
sizes in female fruits; (iii) a vestigial pis￾til-like structure from the central axis with a 
pair of distinct ovaries attached to the ter￾minal stigmatic area; (iv) ovule develop￾ment on a structure extending from the cen￾tral axis; (v) well-developed internal ovaries 
that are joined to the free central placenta; 
and (vi) internal ovaries in female fruit that 
are attached either to the base of the primary 
fruit cavity or the placenta (Ram, 2005).
12.2.9 Pulp softening
Pulp softening or ‘early softening disorder’ 
is characterized by a premature loss of firm￾ness of the entire fruit while the skin of the 
fruit remains partially green (25–50% ripe). 
The disorder occurs on ‘Golden’ papaya 
fruit in some seasons as reported by farmers

from the northern state of Espírito Santo, 
Brazil (Jacomino et al., 2010). At the time of 
harvest, fruits with the early softening dis￾order are not distinguishable by skin colour 
and flesh firmness from those without the 
disorder. Skin of fruits with early softening 
disorder turned yellow after about 6 days of 
refrigerated storage while the firmness de￾creased 2 days earlier. The pulp is ready for 
consumption while fruits are still partially 
green resulting in these fruits being discarded 
during the packaging process, causing con￾siderable postharvest losses.
Fruit softening is a complex process that 
involves three sequential steps: (i) loosen￾ing of the cell wall as triggered by expansins 
(proteins that induce cell wall extension); 
(ii) depolymerization of hemicelluloses; and 
finally (iii) polyuronide polymerization by 
polygalacturonase or other hydrolytic en￾zymes (Brummell et al., 1999). The fleshy 
pulp of papaya is comprised mainly of large 
cells with primary cell walls where the cellu￾lose and xyloglucan framework are embed￾ded in a pectin matrix (Carpita and Gibeaut, 
1993). The pectin matrix is a complex domain 
containing both linear and highly branched 
polysaccharides of galactosyluronic acid 
backbones with side chains of galactosyl and 
arabinosyl residues (Brummell and Harp￾ster, 2001).
Factors that affect pulp softening are 
high light intensity, soil humidity and the 
temperature during fruit development (Sams, 
1999). Fruit texture is the result of the water 
content and the composition or integrity of 
the cell wall of the pulp tissue. Environ￾mental factors, crop management (such as 
irrigation and mineral nutrition), and physio￾logical and genetic factors are among the 
major components related to fruit texture 
(Devitt et al., 2006). According to Sams (1999) 
N, P, K and Ca are the elements that are 
related to pulp firmness. A relationship be￾tween the supply of high doses of N and a 
loss of firmness has been documented 
(Campostrini et al., 2008). This is attributed 
to the negative action of excess N on the 
ability of pulp tissue to accumulate Ca (Sau￾re, 2005). Ca maintains consistency of the 
pulp tissue by forming cross-links between 
complex structures of the pectin molecule, 
promoting stability in the primary cell wall 
and middle lamellae.
Pulp softening disorder increases the 
susceptibility of fruits to mechanical damage 
during postharvest handling and manage￾ment. Thus, the required structural integrity 
of the pulp is of prime importance in order 
to withstand compression and mechanical 
impacts. A balanced supply of N and Ca 
nutrients during fruit growth and appropri￾ate packaging of the fruit during postharvest 
handling could reduce the incidence of the 
disorder of pulp softening.
12.2.10 Skin freckles
Skin freckles are superficial dark green 
spots that develop into brown spots on skin 
surfaces of unripe and ripe papaya fruits which 
are exposed to direct sunlight (Fig. 12.4). The 
spots increase in size and coalesce with 
surrounding smaller spots to form larger 
circular areas with corky appearance often 
referred to as skin freckles or frog skin. 
These blemishes develop at the mid-face of 
unripe or ripe fruits at later maturity stages 
but are not seen on the skin of young fruits. 
There seemed to be a minor occurrence of 
the disorder in yellow-skinned papaya

cultivars ‘Frangi’ (‘Eksotika’ group) and 
‘Golden’ (‘Solo’ group). This disorder is non￾pathogenic and does not influence fruit ripen￾ing or fruit flavour.
Possible causes of skin freckles have 
been attributed to the interactions between 
environmental factors and the genetic make￾up of the plant. Green papaya fruits and the tree 
contain laticifer cells in the subepidermal 
layer of the skin. Laticifer cells synthesize 
and accumulate latex that would be secreted 
and coagulates as a defence mechanism 
against harmful pathogens or other attacks. 
However, a sudden increase in internal 
pressure of the laticifer cells could result in 
their rupture, and the coagulated latex forms 
the visible skin freckles. Environmental fac￾tors and the plant’s genetic characteristics 
could increase the internal pressure of the la￾ticifers resulting in increased frequency of 
the physiological disorder. Excessive rain￾fall, high relative humidity in the air, solar 
intensity and water status in soils with dif￾ferent depths of irrigation (Gomes Filho et al., 
2008) have been associated with the in￾creased occurrence of skin freckles. The plant’s 
genetic characteristics, such as the transpir￾ation capacity, stage of fruit development 
(Mishra et al., 2016), high number of latici￾fer cells and amount of latex-soluble solids 
(Eloisa et al., 1994; Kaiser et al., 1996) inter￾act with the environment and contributes 
to the frequency of skin freckles. Wrapping 
young fruits in white paper bags or alumin￾ized polyethylene bags reduced the incidence 
of skin freckles (Eloisa et al., 1994, Oliveira 
et al., 2011) but the practice would not be 
commercially economic.
12.2.11 Soft fruit
Soft fruit disorder, also known as premature 
ripe fruit disorder, is characterized by the 
sporadic occurrence of overripe fruit and 
abnormally soft fruit at the marketplace or 
fruit that ripens very rapidly in the commer￾cial packing sheds (Cappellini et al., 1988). 
This soft fruit disorder leads to disruption 
of marketing causing high losses. The con￾dition is more common following periods of 
heavy rainfall, 2–3 months before harvest, 
at the start of the final phase of fruit growth. 
The disorder has been related to low Ca in 
the fruit mesocarp and the role of Ca in fruit 
ripening. Mesocarp Ca concentration is posi￾tively correlated with firmness of the ripe 
papaya fruit and the rate of softening of 
mesocarp tissues (Qiu et al., 1995). The fruit 
softening rate is slower when the mesocarp 
Ca concentration is above 130 μg g-1 fresh 
weight compared with fruit with a lower Ca 
concentration. Low mesocarp Ca uptake is 
related to preharvest environmental condi￾tions and fertilization. Thus, Ca application 
could be used to control the disorder. How￾ever, initial attempts to increase the Ca con￾centration of the mesocarp by spraying CaCl2
on to papaya fruit during growth and by 
postharvest vacuum infiltration and dipping 
of the cut peduncle into CaCl2
 has been un￾successful (Qiu et al., 1995).
12.2.12 Sun scald
Sun scald is a dark olive-brown discolor￾ation which develops on fruits that are dir￾ectly exposed to the sun. It is categorized as 
a postharvest oxidative stress disorder. It is 
the most common disorder during hot sea￾sons, especially when it is dry, and the sun￾light is continuously strong. Sun scald is 
predominant in a young orchard in which 
the canopy is thin with sparse foliage, thus 
exposing the fruits to direct sun. This dis￾order also occurs on trees that are leaning 
over causing fruit to be directly exposed to 
the sun, and when fruit is left exposed to the 
sun after harvest (Paull et al., 1997). Usually, 
the temperature of fruit exposure is between 
5°C and 10°C higher than the surrounding air 
(Lurie, 2009). As a result, a dark olive-brown 
discoloration develops on the fruit peel 
(Zhou et al., 2014). The discoloration is re￾lated to the browning of cell contents that 
occur in the outer hypodermal region and 
further extends throughout the remaining 
layers of the hypodermis (Bain, 1956). The 
browning discoloration is due to the oxida￾tion of sesquiterpene producing several deg￾radation products (Whitaker and Saftner, 
2000). Most damage caused by sun scald 
could lead to thermal death of epidermal

and subepidermal cells thus resulting in 
necrotic spot (Lurie, 2009). Various factors 
influence the occurrence of scalding. Lower 
sun scalding incidence is correlated with 
higher maturity fruit (Smock, 1961).
Moreover, high temperature and dry 
weather during the last week of the growing 
season predispose susceptible fruit to express 
scalding as compared with a cooler season 
with normal quantities of rainfall and sunshine. 
Poor water retention capacity of the soil and 
exposure of the fruit by heavy pruning will 
lead to severe sun scald. There are a few 
methods used in alleviating sun scald such 
as covering the fruits with paper to avoid 
direct exposure to the sun (Huang, 2016). Sun 
scald can also be reduced by providing shad￾ing using shade nets or shade frames to de￾crease direct sunlight and protect fruit from 
overexposure.
12.2.13 Sunken dry brownish areas
The appearance of sunken dry brownish￾grey areas on the surface of papaya fruit is 
caused by mites (Singh and Sundhakar Rao, 
2011; Zhou et al., 2014). There are about 12 
species of mites from seven genera that af￾fect the papaya (Pantoja et al., 2002). The 
mites usually start feeding on the trunk and 
spread to the leaves and young fruit when 
the population density increases. The mite 
injects toxic saliva into the plant cells be￾fore it ingests the contents of the plant 
(Childers et al., 2003). When these feed￾ing-puncture activities are abundant and 
very close together, it leaves behind a large 
damaged area. Later, the affected area forms 
larger brown patches with a sunken surface 
condition (Childers et al., 2003). Sometimes, 
if the mites inject the latex glands, the fruits 
become covered with white sticky liquid 
that marks the appearance of the papaya 
fruit.
Furthermore, the combined effect of 
mites and fungal infection could lead to the 
development of severe chlorosis on the 
papaya fruit surface (Pantoja et al., 2002). 
The infestation of mites is usually controlled 
using chemical insecticides (Reis et al., 
2005). Effective predators such as Phytosei￾ulus  hawaiiensis, Phytoseiulus macropilis
and Euseius sp. have been used in Hawaii 
and Puerto Rico as a biological control for 
the mites (Pantoja et al., 2002).
12.2.14 Pulp flesh gelling
Pulp flesh gelling, sometimes called either 
pulp jellification or pulp flesh translucency, 
is a physiological disorder not visible from 
the external surface of the papaya fruit (Oli￾veira et al., 2019). A fruit with this disorder 
is denser as compared with a normal fruit 
as it accumulates water in the fruit cavity 
(Oliveira and Vitória, 2011) and tends to 
sink in the tank of washing water during 
postharvest handling. This disorder obtained 
its name from the translucent jelly-like or 
soaked texture of the dark-red pulp tissue 
(Campostrini et al., 2008; Oliveira and Vi￾tória, 2011; Oliveira et al., 2011). The jelling 
begins in the endocarp and spreads to the 
exocarp without any external sign. The skin 
of affected fruit can easily be peeled off 
from the pulp. The fruit starts to show the 
initial symptoms during the colour-break 
stage until the later fruit development stage.
The disorder is due to the uptake of water 
which enters the vacuole and the loss of 
cellular turgor pressure due to the high per￾meability rates and leakiness of the gelled 
tissues. These phenomena lead to the accu￾mulation of water in the apoplast resulting 
in the soaked and translucent tissue appear￾ance of the pulp (Azevedo et al., 2015). The 
disorder is not related to calcium deficiency 
or premature ripening of the fruit. However, 
the development of this disorder could be 
caused by a possible disturbance of hor￾mone levels triggered by low temperature.
12.2.15 Viviparous seed
Viviparous seed is a condition where the 
seeds of papaya germinate inside the fruit 
cavity (Fig. 12.5) while the fruit is still attached 
to the mother plant (Farnsworth, 2000; Singh, 
2013; Saran et al., 2014). Usually, this disorder

is hard to detect by the external appearance 
of the fruit and can only be noticed when the 
fruit is cut longitudinally into two halves. 
The outer surface of viviparous papaya fruit 
is rough compared with the smooth surface 
of a normal fruit and affected fruit has a 
slightly insipid taste (Singh, 2013; Saran 
et al., 2014). Visually, viviparous seeds are 
white, smaller than normal, with rough sur￾faces, tight seed attachment and broken sar￾cotesta that do not need to be removed for 
germination. Such a papaya seed disorder 
indirectly causes high economic losses in 
seed production (Saran et al., 2014), posing 
adverse effects on species diversity and nat￾ural seed bank resources (Hugo Cota-Sánchez, 
2018). The viviparous seed produced a seed￾ling with a colourless radicle, a white hypo￾cotyl and green leaves that were about to 
open (Singh, 2013).
Vivipary is controlled genetically caus￾ing the seed to germinate prematurely while 
still on the parent plant. Exposure of fruits 
to high temperatures during the seed matur￾ation period contributes to the development 
of viviparous seed (Saran et al., 2014). Also, 
unusually high humidity and warm temper￾atures can be favourable conditions for the 
development of viviparous seed (Farnsworth, 
2000). Increased atmospheric humidity dur￾ing the rainy season may play a significant 
role in expressing viviparous seed in pa￾paya fruit in Rajasthan, India (Singh, 2013). 
Low production or lack of sensitivity of the 
fruit to abscisic acid can also lead to the viv￾iparous seed disorder (Farnsworth, 2000; 
Singh, 2013). Viviparous seed formation can 
be controlled by using a chemical or ab￾scisic acid hormone spray (Nonogaki and 
Nonogaki, 2017). However, these methods 
of control are not economical for farmers to 
apply. More research should be conducted 
to solve this disorder.
12.3 Conclusion
Variable atmospheric and/or edaphic fac￾tors such as temperature, humidity and soil 
nutrients are the causal factors of physio￾logical disorders in papaya. Most often, 
conditions causing the disorders are closely 
linked to several of the factors that interact 
throughout the growing season and are dif￾ficult to establish. The manifestation of 
these physiological disorders involves the 
induction phase and development phase of 
fruit production that occur during the pre￾harvest and postharvest periods. The con￾trol of losses caused by physiological dis￾orders in papaya is essential as the fruit 
assists in maintaining human health due to 
its high content of nutrients, minerals, vita￾mins and phytochemicals. Thus, under￾standing the physiological basis and causal 
factors of the disorders would aid in prevent￾ing and controlling losses of papaya fruits. 
Interventions in papaya crop production 
practices, such as developing new varieties 
through breeding programmes and biotech￾nological processes, are steps required to￾wards controlling and improving the impacts 
of the disorders.

13 Insect and Nematode Pests
Matiyar Rahaman Khan* and Amalendu Ghosh
Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) – Indian Agricultural 
Research Institute, New Delhi, India
13.1 Introduction
Several insect pests attack root, foliage, trunk, 
fruits and seeds of papaya. More than 134 arthro￾pods attack papaya worldwide (Pantoja 
et al., 2002). Some of them such as mealybugs, 
oriental red scale and fruit fly are serious 
concerns for papaya growers. Minor pests 
such as thrips, white fly, aphid and mites are 
reported to infest different developmental 
stages of papaya. A dozen insect species are 
known vectors of virus diseases of papaya. Red 
spider mites usually appear as a secondary 
pest of papaya due to indiscriminate use of 
pesticides to control other insect pests.
13.2 Pests
13.2.1 Papaya mealybug
The papaya mealybug, Paracoccus margin￾atus Williams and Granara de Willink (Hemip￾tera: Pseudococcidae), was first reported 
in Mexico during 1955. It is polyphagous in 
nature and attacks several tropical fruits 
and ornamentals. This is considered a key 
pest in papaya, mulberry, citrus and mango. 
This insect species is believed to be native 
to Mexico and/or Central America. 
P. marginatus has been described in Belize, 
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico (Williams 
and Granara de Willink, 1992). It has assumed 
serious pest status in the Caribbean region since 
1994. It has also been reported in Guam, the Re￾public of Palau, India, Indonesia, Thailand 
and several regions of the USA. By being pol￾yphagous in nature, papaya mealybug  has 
been recorded on more than 55 host plants.
Biology and nature of the damage
The biology of P. marginatus is similar to other 
mealybug species. Briefly, adult females 
of P. marginatus lay up to 600 eggs in the 
ovisac over a period of 1–2 weeks. The egg 
incubation period is around 10 days. On 
hatching, the crawlers start dispersing and 
search for a suitable feeding site. The female 
undergoes four instars to become an adult, 
while the male has an additional fifth instar 
to turn into a short-lived winged adult. Adult 
females are wingless and suck plant sap with 
their piercing and sucking type of mouth￾parts. They are active during warm and dry 
weather. Adult females move from plant to 
plant by crawling, sometimes by air current or 
through human interventions. P. marginatus
sucks plant sap from tender plant tissues

such as leaves, buds, fruit and stem. Severe 
feeding results in chlorosis, leaf deformation, 
leaf dropping, plant stunting and fruit drop￾ping. It also secretes honeydew leading to the 
development of sooty mould fungus. Heavy 
infestations in papaya (Fig. 13.1) make the 
fruit unacceptable due to the development 
of thick white wax.
Management
Chemical pesticides are not very effective 
against papaya mealybug due to the thick 
waxy coating over the body. Development of 
insecticide resistance and non-target effects 
on natural enemies also make chemical con￾trol a less desirable option. Cryptolaemus 
montrouzieri, lacewings and hoverflies are 
potential natural enemies against P. margin￾atus. In 1999, the United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the 
USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) 
adopted a classical biological control pro￾gramme for the papaya mealybug. Encyrti￾dae endoparasitoid wasps such as Aceropha￾gus papayae, Anagyrus loecki, Anagyrus 
californicus and Pseudaphycus sp. (USDA 
APHIS, 2000; Meyerdirk and Kauffman, 
2001) and Pseudleptomastix mexicana (Noy￾es and Schauff, 2003) were introduced into 
Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic 
and caused a reduction of over 95% of the 
papaya mealybug population in both coun￾tries.
13.2.2 Striped mealybug
The striped mealybug, Ferrisia virgata (Cock￾erell) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is con￾sidered as a species complex consisting of 
several morphologically similar but genetic￾ally distinct species (Kaydan and Gullan, 
2012). The name arose because of the two 
dark, dorsal stripes running longitudinally 
on its body. Two posterior waxy tails around 
half of the body in length are the character￾istic features of striped mealybug. It has a 
very broad host range and breeds rapidly in 
the tropical climate. Ferrisia is a New World 
genus native to the Americas (Williams and 
Watson, 1988). It was first described in Jamaica 
(Cockerell, 1893) and was later reported in 
India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, West Africa 
and Indonesia. It is widely present in Asia, 
Africa, North America, Central America and 
the Caribbean, South America, Europe and 
Oceania. Transport of infested plant material 
is presumed to have been the main mode of 
spread. F. virgata is one of the most highly 
polyphagous mealybugs. It infests plant spe￾cies belonging to more than 203 genera in 77 
families (García Morales et al., 2016), includ￾ing economically important plants such as 
avocado, banana, betelvine, black pepper, 
cassava, cashew, cauliflower, citrus, cocoa, 
coffee, cotton, custard apple, grapevine, 
guava, papaya, litchi, mango, pineapple and 
tomato. Acalypha is also reported to be a fa￾vourable host plant for F. virgata (Kaydan 
and Gullan, 2012).
Biology and nature of the damage
The female F. virgata has three nymphal 
instars before moulting into a sexually mature 
adult. The male constructs a cocoon during 
the second instar and continues feeding in￾side it (Highland, 1956). The third instar in 
males is a pre-pupal stage after which a pu￾parium is formed. The male reaches sexual 
maturity upon the moult from puparia to the 
winged-adult stage. Reproduction takes place 
sexually and the female mates only once. 
The female does not produce ovisacs but 
lays eggs in groups on pads of cottony wax 
filaments. First instar nymphs hatch within 
a few hours (Awadallah et al., 1979). Adult

males are short lived while the longevity of 
the adult female is around 36–53 days. Striped 
mealybugs congregate around the terminal 
shoots, leaves and fruit. The immature stages 
and adult females suck plant sap resulting 
in yellowing, withering and drying of plants 
and premature shedding of leaves and fruit. 
F. virgata is reported to transmit Cocoa 
swollen shoot virus and Piper yellow mottle 
virus (Thorold, 1975; Bhat et al., 2003; 
Ameyaw et al., 2014).
Management
Chemical pesticides are not very effective 
against striped mealybug due to the waxy 
layer over its body. However, insect growth 
regulators are found to be quite effective 
against the first and second instar nymphs as 
the waxy deposition is lower during these 
stages. Soil application of systemic insecti￾cides is also effective, but repeated spraying 
is often required to manage the overlapping 
generations. Cultural measures like early de￾tection and managing ant activity may help to 
prevent the initial establishment of mealybug. 
Commercially available biocontrol agents such 
as the mealybug destroyer (Cryptolaemus mon￾trouzieri (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)), green 
lacewings and brown lacewings could be em￾ployed to manage mealybug outbreaks. C. mon￾trouzieri and Alloagrapta obliqua (Diptera: 
Syrphidae) effectively controlled F. virgata in 
the Hawaiian Islands (Zimmerman, 1948).
13.2.3 Oriental red scale
The oriental red scale, Aonidiella orientalis
(Newstead) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), is an ar￾moured scale insect infesting a wide variety 
of crop plants. It was first described as 
Aspidiotus orientalis by Newstead and 
re-described as Aspidiotus osbeckiae Green, 
Aspidiotus cocotiphagus Marlatt and as 
Chrysomphalus pedroniformis Cockerell and 
Robinson. The oriental red scale is native to 
Asia and was spread with international 
trade and shipments of plants. It is common 
in tropical and subtropical regions of the 
West Indies, the Middle East, India, East 
Africa and South Africa, southern Asia and 
northern Australia and also survives in green￾houses in cooler regions. The oriental red 
scale is highly polyphagous. It attacks many 
economically important crop plants including 
citrus, papaya, mango, banana, palm, coco￾nut, areca nut and tea.
Biology and nature of the damage
The female oriental red scale attaches to the 
plant surface and forms a waxy scale to lay 
eggs underneath. A viviparous reproduction 
is also common where immatures are laid in￾stead of eggs. The just-hatched larvae are 
known as crawlers. They roam for several 
hours to search for a suitable place to settle 
and start feeding. Females remain immobile 
and undergo two moultings. Males undergo 
additional pre-pupa and pupal moults to be￾come winged adults. Males are short lived 
and do not have mouthparts. There are about 
three to five generations per year, depending 
on conditions. The oriental red scale sucks 
plant sap from tender plant parts. Damage in￾cludes discoloration and deformation of 
leaves, and shedding of flowers and fruits. 
When the insects feed on the fruits, the fruits 
become discoloured and warped, reducing 
their market value. In the case of severe infest￾ation, the result can be plant death.
Management
Chemical pesticides are not a popular op￾tion for management of oriental red scale. 
Mechanical control like removal of infested 
twigs, branches and shoots slows down the 
spread of the scale. Natural enemies such as 
Comperiella lemniscata and Encarsia citri￾na are reported to manage the infestation of 
scale in Queensland’s papaya groves. Pred￾ators like Batrachedra arenosella (Lepidop￾tera: Batrachedridae), Lindorus lophanthae
(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Chilocorus circum￾datus and Chilocorus baileyi are helpful in 
the case of severe infestations of scale insects.
13.2.4 Papaya fruit fly
The papaya fruit fly, Toxotrypana curvi￾cauda Gerstaecker  (Diptera: Tephritidae), 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsInsect and Nematode Pests 197
is considered the main insect pest of papaya 
in tropical and subtropical countries. The 
thorax of the adult is predominantly yel￾low marked with black. The female bears a 
very long and curved ovipositor which ex￾ceeds the length of its body. T. curvicauda
is reported from the Caribbean, Central 
America and South America, the USA and 
Mexico. T. curvicauda is a monophagous 
pest of papaya. The infestation of papaya 
fruit fly is also reported in mango and milk￾weed in Florida, and other plant species 
in Mexico.
Biology and damage
The adult female of T. curvicauda inserts the 
eggs through the papaya fruit peel into the 
central fruit cavity. Females can oviposit 
more than 100 long, slender eggs in groups of 
around ten. Egg incubation time is around 
12 days. After hatching, the maggots start 
feeding on developing seeds and in the inter￾ior parts of the fruit. The mature larvae eat 
their way out of the fruit and drop to the 
ground. Pupation takes place on the soil 
surface. The adult T. curvicauda emerges in 
about 2–6 weeks, depending upon the cli￾matic conditions. The infested fruits may 
show yellow areas and drop prematurely. 
Due to the feeding of larvae and second￾ary fungal infection, the fruits become 
unacceptable.
Management
Mechanical control has been found to be 
very effective against T. curvicauda. Avoid￾ance or elimination of the females and pre￾vention of egg laying are the key approaches 
to controlling papaya fruit fly. It is neces￾sary to kill the adult female before she de￾posits eggs in the fruit. Bagging of fruits is 
suggested when the fruit is small. Maintain￾ing sanitation by destroying the prema￾turely dropped fruits prevent the larvae 
from developing into adults. Pheromone 
traps have been found to be effective to 
monitor the adult population. Doryctobra￾con toxotrypanae is reported as a potential 
parasitoid of T. curvicauda in southern 
Mexico and Costa Rica.
13.2.5 Thrips
Thrips parvispinus (Karny) (Thysanoptera: 
Thripidae) is reported to infest papaya.
T. parvispinus is a polyphagous pest 
that occurs predominately in Asian coun￾tries and has also been reported in Australia 
and Greece. T. parvispinus also infests Cap￾sicum and other vegetable crops. The larvae 
and adults feed on the shoots, young leaves 
and flower buds of papaya resulting in sil￾ver spots and abnormal fruit size.
13.2.6 Papaya whitefly
Silver leaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Genna￾dius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is a polypha￾gous species infesting papaya. Currently, 
B. tabaci is considered as a cryptic species 
complex. Both the nymphs and the adults 
suck the sap from the lower surface of the 
leaves. The direct damage to the plant is 
caused by sucking the sap, which leads to 
yellowing of leaves and later on the leaves 
wither away. They also cause indirect dam￾age by transmitting Papaya leaf curl virus. 
Infected plants show severe leaf curling and 
thickening of veins, stunting, and smaller 
and deformed fruits.
13.2.7 Aphids
Several aphid species are reported to infest 
papaya. Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Aphis gos￾sypii Glover and Aphis craccivora Koch 
(Hemiptera: Aphididae) are predominant. 
The nymphs and adults suck plant sap redu￾cing plant vigour. They can indirectly cause 
serious damage to papaya groves by transmit￾ting Papaya ringspot virus. Infected papaya 
plants show yellowing, distortion and severe 
mosaic symptoms on leaves. Typical ringspot 
symptoms appear on fruits.

greenhouses and sometimes under field 
conditions as well. The immature stages and 
adults suck sap from the leaves and tender 
foliage leading to the formation of white or 
yellow speckles.
13.2.9 Fruitspotting bug
The fruitspotting bug, Amblypelta nitida Stål 
(Hemiptera: Coreidae), is an economically 
damaging insect pest to papaya under tropical 
and subtropical climates. Besides papaya, it 
also infests avocado, banana, macadamia, cus￾tard apple, cashew, cocoa, guava, kiwifruit, 
litchi and persimmon (Danne et al., 2014).
The life cycle of A. nitida comprises an 
egg and five nymphal stages before the devel￾opment of the imago. The eggs are pale green 
in colour, oval shaped with a flattened base, 
rounded ends and a central dorsal ridge. 
Nymphs are pear shaped and green to orange 
in colour with two large black spots on the 
abdomen. The adults are green in colour with 
chestnut-brown coloured hemelytra.
Damage
Adults and nymphs feed on the fruits, shoots 
and/or terminal buds of papaya. Feeding of 
A. nitida leads to premature dropping of 
fruits, stunted growth of the plant, and cos￾metic damage that can reduce fruit quality 
and reduce market value.
Management
Neem has been found to be effective for man￾aging the nymphs of A. nitida. Pheidole 
megacephala F., Oecophylla smaragdina F. 
(Hymenoptera: Formicidae), Pristhesancus 
papuensis Stål (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and 
Ocrisiona spp. (Salticidae) are considered 
to be predators of A. nitida.
13.3 Nematode Pests
By being perennial, papaya is highly vulner￾able to the attack of plant parasitic nematodes 
(PPNs). Several PPNs inhabit the rhizosphere 
of papaya and they mostly parasitize the 
plants as ectoparasites, semi-endoparasites 
and endoparasites. However, the most com￾monly encountered and proven nematode 
pathogens infecting papaya are root knot 
nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and reniform 
nematodes (Rotylenchulus reniformis). The 
pathogenicity of dagger nematode, Xiphinema 
basiri, and citrus nematode, Tylenchulus 
semipenetrans (Kesba et al., 2012), have also 
been proved but their damage potential has 
not yet been realized. The root knot nema￾tode is typically an endoparasite, feeding on 
vascular bundles and transforming the cells it 
feeds on into a giant cell to establish feeding 
sites for nutrition, development and multipli￾cation. By contrast, the reniform nematode is 
a semi-endoparasite, primarily establishing its 
feeding site in the endodermis and pericycle 
region; they also transform the cells into syn￾cytia and other specialized structures such as 
feeding pegs, feeding tubes and feeding bridges, 
as observed in many crops. Heavy infection of 
reniform nematodes often results in damage 
(necrosis) in the epidermal and parenchymal 
tissues (Sivakumar and Seshadri, 1972).
Both root knot nematodes and reniform 
nematodes are polyphagous, infecting a 
large number of crops across the world. The 
root knot nematode is capable of causing 
yield losses between 15% and 20% in Ha￾waii (Koenning et al., 1999) and 20–40% in 
India (Walia and Khan, 2018). More than 32 
nematode species of 20 genera have been re￾ported to be associated with papaya in India 
(Khan and Khan, 1998). Some other nema￾todes like Pratylenchus brachyurus, Praty￾lenchus zeae, Helicotylenchus dihystera, 
Criconemoides sp., Mesocriconema sp. and 
Hemicriconemoides strictathecatus have 
been reported to be associated with papaya 
from other parts of the world. In Nigeria, 
Meloidogyne javanica caused damage to pa￾paya cultivar ‘Homestead’. Other nematodes 
associated with the crop are Pratylenchus spp., 
R. reniformis, Helicotylenchus spp., Tylen￾chulus martini, Scutellonema clatbricauda￾tum and Hoplolaimus pararobustus, although 
some of them considered papaya as a poor 
host (Ogbuji, 1982). In Pakistan, Meloido￾gyne, Pratylenchus, Tylenchorhynchus and 
Helicotylenchus have been reported from 
papaya rhizosphere and root knot nematodes

Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsInsect and Nematode Pests 199
are considered to be economically significant in 
papaya cultivation (Khan et al., 2007). However, 
the pathogenic potential of many phytonem￾atodes has not yet been established. The high 
incidence (200 g-1 of the root) of H. dihystera
in papaya has been recorded in South Africa 
(Willers and Neething, 1994). In Egypt, papaya 
has been considered as a moderately suscep￾tible host to T. semipenetrans and a pathogen￾icity test revealed that papaya could also be 
affected at relatively high inoculum densities 
in soil (Kesba et al., 2012). However, the patho￾genic relation of this species in papaya is not 
known from elsewhere.
In this chapter, the infestation of root 
knot, reniform and dagger nematodes in 
papaya is briefly described.
13.3.1 Root knot nematode
The root knot disease of papaya is primar￾ily caused by infection with Meloidogyne 
incognita and M. javanica and infection by 
these nematodes induces typical root galling 
symptoms in the papaya plant. The nature of 
the gall and size depends on the level of the 
initial nematode population, the host (var￾iety), growing conditions and environmental 
factors. Heavy infections in papaya result in 
severe deformation of the root, which is 
commonly known as root knot/root gall. In 
India, root knot nematode infection in 
papaya has been reported throughout the
country (Walia and Khan, 2018). The nature 
of symptoms is mostly non-specific – stunted
growth, yellowing of leaves (Fig. 13.2), re￾duced size of fruits and yield, and profuse 
root galling (Fig. 13.3). In the nursery, mild 
infection is sometimes visible as swelling in 
the root tips and stunted seedling growth 
with yellowing of leaves. Often root rotting 
due to a Fusarium–Meloidogyne disease com￾plex has been detected. Khan (1991) reported 
a M. incognita–Fusarium solani disease 
complex in papaya from India.

Biology and life cycle
The root knot nematode is a soil-borne, sed￾entary endoparasite. Second-stage juveniles 
infect the roots in nursery seedlings both 
before and after transplanting. The nematode 
develops endoparasitically, feeding on the 
vascular tissues. Adult females are sac-like; 
vermiform males leave the roots and come out 
into the soil. Females lay eggs in masses on the 
root surface in galls, or in advanced stages 
of infection, inside the compound galls. The 
life cycle is completed in 25–30 days during 
the summer months. M. incognita race 1 
completed its life cycle on papaya cultivar 
‘Honey Dew’ during August–September 
when the temperature varies between 28°C 
and 35°C under Indian conditions, while M. 
javanica took 32 days on ‘Pusa Nanha’, 30 
days on ‘Washington’, 26 days on ‘Solo II’ 
and 21 days on ‘Honey Dew’ cultivars. The 
nematode disseminates through infected 
planting material, irrigation water and agri￾cultural implements.
Nematode management
Root knot nematodes could be effectively 
controlled through pre-planting soil fumiga￾tion, selection of a nematode-free site for raising 
nursery seedlings or solarization of soil in a 
polythene bag and selection of a nematode￾tolerant cultivar of papaya. The pre-planting 
application involves disinfection of seedlings 
by hot water treatment at 50°C for 10 min 
(Parvatha Reddy, 2008), summer ploughing, 
organic amendment such as with neem cake 
at 2.5 t ha-1 (Nayak, 1986), farmyard manure 
(FYM) or vermicompost enriched with bio￾control agents and chemical treatments. The 
papaya cultivars ‘CO.2’, ‘CO.3’, ‘Pusa Deli￾cious’, ‘Pusa Dwarf’ and ‘Pusa Giant’ have been 
reported as resistant to M. incognita (Nayak, 
1986; Khan et al., 1992). The application of 
nematicides such as carbofuran, aldicarb, 
phenamiphos and oxamyl effectively con￾trolled nematodes and improved plant growth 
and fruit yields (Gupta and Yadav, 1988; 
Routaray and Das, 1988; Ramakrishan and 
Rajendran, 1999; Parvatha Reddy, 2008). 
However, in the face of the current non￾availability of systemic nematicides, the most 
practical and doable management options 
are: (i) deep ploughing two to three times 
during May–June; (ii) raising nematode-free 
seedlings; (iii) application of 8 kg FYM or 
1 kg neem cake or carbofuran (3G) 3.0 g active 
ingredient (a.i.) per plant; (iv) field applica￾tion of FYM-enriched with Pochonia chla￾mydosporia at 5 kg ha-1; and (v) application 
of carbofuran (3G) at 2 kg a.i. ha-1 prior to 
sowing. The integration of nursery treatment 
with Trichoderma harzianum and Purpureo￾cillium lilacinum at 5–10 g kg-1 soil for rais￾ing healthy seedlings and field application 
of neem cake at 2.5 t ha-1 might be effective 
to reduce nematode infestation in papaya. 
The bacterial biocontrol agent, Pseudo￾monas fluorescens at 4 g per tree along with 
250 g neem cake and carbofuran 3G at 1 g a.i. 
proved to be beneficial for profitable culti￾vation of papaya in Coimbatore, India 
(Soorianathasundaram, 2005).
13.3.2 Reniform nematode
Papaya is a very susceptible host for reniform 
nematodes. Two species of Rotylenchulus
have been reported so far, they are R. reni￾formis and Rotylenchulus parvus. Infestation 
of reniform nematodes in papaya has been 
reported in India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kenya, 
Thailand, Fiji, Brunei, Florida and Puerto 
Rico. In India, R. reniformis is widespread 
(Khan and Khan, 1998) and a high incidence

has been recorded, with population densities up 
to 1025 100 g-1 of soil (Ganguly et al., 1997). It 
causes fruit yield loss to the extent of 28% in 
papaya (Rajendaran and Naganathan, 1981).
Infection by reniform nematode is diffi￾cult to diagnose as the infected plant displays 
non-specific symptoms – stunted growth, pale 
yellow colour and reduced size of leaves. 
In the case of severe infection, plant root 
systems become discoloured with brown 
lesions and finally the entire root system 
decays, primarily due to attack by other 
soil-borne pathogens. Infected roots appear 
dirty with adhered soil particles and closer 
observation confirms the presence of egg 
masses on the root surface. Nematode infec￾tion leads to histopathological changes and 
the infected root tissue at the site of feeding 
exhibits hypertrophy, hyperplasia, thickening 
of cell walls, granular cytoplasm and enlarged 
nuclei and nucleoli (Sivakumar and Seshad￾ri, 1972). Nematode interaction with other 
soil-borne pathogens is also known. In Bru￾nei, papaya plants’ death was observed in 
the presence of Phytopthora nicotianae pv. 
parasitica. Not much information on the 
pathogenicity of R. reniformis on papaya is 
known, however, results from a pot experi￾ment indicated that 620 nematodes 200 ml-1
soil reduced the seedling growth of papaya 
(Karim, 1989). Interaction between two major 
nematode pests (Meloidogyne and Rotylen￾chulus) of papaya reveals that M. incognita
is a more virulent pathogen than R. reni￾formis but combined infection mitigated the 
virulence of M. incognita.
Nematode management
Foliar application of fenamiphos and oxamyl 
prevented nematode damage (Ayala et al., 
1971). Soil application of carbofuran at 2.0 kg 
a.i. ha-1 reduced the nematode population 
and enhanced fruit yield compared with the 
untreated control (Rajendran and Nagana￾than, 1981). Several nematode-tolerant cul￾tivars ‘CO.1’, ‘CO.2’, ‘CO.3’, ‘CO.4’, ‘CO.5’, 
‘Thailand’ and ‘Giant’ were reported (Nayak, 
1986; Parvatha Reddy, 2008). ‘Solo’, ‘Wash￾ington’ and ‘Mammoth’ were also considered 
to be resistant (Patel et al., 1989; Khan and 
Khan, 1998).
13.3.3 Dagger nematode
X. basiri is an ectoparasite of many plants 
(papaya, banana, citrus, guava, fig, litchi, 
mango, plum, okra, castor and rose) and it is 
a proven pathogen of papaya. The presence 
of one nematode g-1 of soil is capable of ini￾tiating disease symptoms in papaya. Dagger 
nematodes feed on the root and induce galling 
and a typical symptom is ‘fish hook’ forma￾tion. The affected root becomes thick and 
stubbed (Parvatha Reddy and Rao, 2003).
13.4 Conclusion
Among the different insect pests infesting 
papaya, papaya mealybugs have become a 
serious threat to papaya cultivation. P. mar￾ginatus  (papaya mealybug) and  F. virgata
(striped mealybug) are well-studied pests, 
however, there are several other mealybug 
species infesting papaya. Further studies on 
the species diversity of mealybugs, their dis￾persal, alternate hosts, natural enemies and 
other ecological conditions affecting the out￾break of insects remain to be worked out. 
The economic significance of the fruitspotting 
bug has been demonstrated in a few papaya￾growing countries, however, the available 
information on its bioecology and manage￾ment options is still scant. Nematodes are 
one of the pests of papaya and although they 
are well studied they still need to be fully 
recognized by the growers. Root knot nema￾todes (Meloidogyne  spp.) and reniform 
nematodes (R. reniformis) are the two most 
economically damaging pests of papaya. 
Infection with root knot nematode is easily 
diagnosed by the presence of knotted roots 
or root galls at the early stage of the crop but 
infection is difficult to detect based on 
above-ground damage symptoms. There is a 
need to test the pathogenic potential of other 
nematodes identified from the rhizosphere

14.1 Introduction
While great advances have been made in 
increasing tropical fruit production world￾wide, production continues to be influenced 
by the incidence and severity of plant diseases. 
Papaya trees are susceptible to a large number 
of diseases caused by fungi and fungal-like 
organisms, bacteria, viruses, phytoplasmas 
and nematodes. The following review of the 
diseases of cultivated papaya is limited to 
the major diseases of the crop.
14.2 Diseases Caused by Fungi 
and Fungal-like Organisms
14.2.1 Phytophthora root, stem 
and fruit rot
Symptoms
Papaya plants of all ages are susceptible to 
Phytophthora root rot but seedlings up to 
2 months old are most susceptible (Ko, 1971). 
Leaves of affected plants turn yellow, wilt 
and eventually drop prematurely. Root rot 
generally originates as minor lesions on 
smaller lateral roots which quickly develop 
into a major rot of the taproot (Fig. 14.1A), 
making trees unstable and prone to damage 
during high winds (Teakle, 1957).
Phytophthora is also known to cause 
stem or trunk rot following severe storms 
and cyclonic events (Hamill, 1987). Brown 
sunken cankers occur on the stem and if wet 
weather favourable for disease development 
prevails, the upper portion of the plant will 
collapse due to the expanding rot.
Immature and mature green fruit infected 
with Phytophthora develop water-soaked 
lesions which can develop into large rotted 
areas covered with off-white mycelium of 
the pathogen (Fig. 14.1B).
Causal organism and disease distribution
Phytophthora palmivora is the most import￾ant causal agent of Phytophthora root, stem 
and fruit rot in papaya (Erwin and Ribeiro, 
1996), although Phytophthora nicotianae has 
also been found associated with these dis￾eases in Australia (Persley and Vawdrey, 
2009), Phytophthora cinnamomi has been 
reported as the cause of root rot in Peru 
(Bazan de Segura, 1951) and Phytophthora 
capsici has been found associated with fruit 
rot in Hawaii (Ko, 1994).
These diseases have been reported in 
American Samoa, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, 
the Canary Islands, Costa Rica, the Dominican

Republic, the Federated States of Micronesia, 
Hawaii, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, 
Mexico, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
the Republic of Palau and Sri Lanka (Liberato 
et al., 2006b).
Control measures
Excessive soil moisture and ambient tem￾peratures of 20–30°C are known to enhance 
disease development (Teakle, 1957; Hunter 
and Buddenhagen, 1969). Duniway (1979) 
concluded that the most important environ￾mental factor influencing Phytophthora root 
rot was the duration of saturation or near 
saturation of soil. Soil conditions such as these 
are known to favour the rapid formation of 
sporangia and infectious zoospores and a 
high level of disease. Similarly, research by 
Deoliveira et al. (2014) and Vawdrey et al. 
(2015) showed that fruit artificially inocu￾lated and kept at a temperature of 25–27°C 
and a fruit wetness period of 72 h developed 
large wet lesions with off-white mycelial 
growth typical of Phytophthora.
Cultural and chemical measures are used 
to manage root rot of papaya. Seedlings should 
be grown in pasteurized or fumigated soil 
and care taken to avoid contamination of 
the potting mix prior to transplanting in the 
field (Persley and Ploetz, 2003). It is also 
recommended that papaya is not grown in 
soil which has previously grown papaya, as 
lengthy rotations with other crops and fal￾lows reduce both inoculum levels and the 
incidence of tree lodging due to root rot 
(Erwin and Ribiero, 1996; Vawdrey, 2001). 
Ko (1971) and Vawdrey and Westerhuis 
(2007) also reported that tolerance of pa￾paya roots to root rot was directly correlated 
with the age of the plant, with more mature 
plants being less susceptible to root rot than 
younger plants. Consequently, it is import￾ant that growers make use of this age-related 
disease tolerance and transplant papaya 
well before the onset of the wet season and 
the high disease pressure associated with 
prolonged wet weather.
Growing papaya on 50–75 cm raised 
single-row mounds to improve soil drainage 
(Vawdrey et al., 2004) and the use of sawdust 
and urea has been shown to significantly 
reduce the incidence of root rot (Vawdrey 
et al., 2002). Research also showed that a single 
application of the fungicide metalaxyl-M 
to the soil in a 40 cm-wide band just prior 
to transplanting and fortnightly foliar 
sprays with the plant defence activator 
potassium phosphonate provided a high level 
of root rot control (Vawdrey and Westerhu￾is, 2007). Rotating papaya with a biofumiga￾tion crop (e.g. BioquireMulch®) also helped

reduce the Phytophthora inoculum in the 
soil and the incidence and severity of root 
rot (Vawdrey et al., 2002). In Hawaii, the 
virgin soil technique involving filling the 
planting hole with soil which had not previ￾ously grown papaya was also shown to be 
effective. This technique allows the plant to 
grow to a size which is generally resistant 
to the pathogen before the roots grow into 
infested soil (Ko, 1987). Practising in-crop 
hygiene (e.g. the removal of Phytophthora￾affected fruit from the field) also helps remove 
important reservoirs for root rot and fruit 
infections (Ko, 1982).
In addition to the cultural and chemical 
control measures already mentioned, pre￾ventive fungicide sprays in the field and the 
use of postharvest fungicides and hot water 
dips have been shown to manage Phytoph￾thora fruit rot (Aragaki et al., 1981; Alvarez 
and Nishijima, 1987; Vawdrey et al., 2015; 
Stice et al., 2016).
No resistant cultivars exist, however, 
Vasconcellea cauliflora and hybrids with 
Carica monoica are believed to have resist￾ance to root rot (Zentmyer and Mitchell, 
1985). Drew et al. (1998) also referred to 
Vasconcellea goudotiana as being a source 
of resistance genes against Phytophthora 
diseases. In a glasshouse evaluation of 62 
breeding lines and cultivars, Vawdrey et al. 
(2005) showed that the papaya genotypes 
‘Subang’, ‘Saipan Red’ and ‘Cross Paris’ culti￾vars were tolerant to root rot. Similarly, 
Dianese et al. (2010) showed that of ten 
genotypes from the ‘Solo’ group and the 
‘Tailândia’ and ‘Cross Paris’ cultivars from 
the ‘Formosa’ group were the least suscep￾tible to root rot in both field and pot studies.
14.2.2 Seedling damping off and root rot
Symptoms
Symptoms of damping off which include 
poor germination due to rotting of the seed 
and basal stem rot and root rot can be a ser￾ious problem in the growing of container￾ized seedlings in the nursery. The above￾ground symptoms of root rot in seedlings 
newly planted to the field are leaf yellowing, 
reduced leaf number and size, and wilting 
(Teakle, 1960).
Causal organism and disease 
distribution
Many different causal organisms are involved 
with these diseases. The most important of 
these include Phytophthora palmivora, 
Pythium aphanidermatum and Rhizoctonia 
solani. Other causal organisms include 
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium
spp., Phytophthora nicotianae, Pythium 
ultimum and other Pythium sp. (Da Costa, 
1944; Trujillo and Hine, 1965; Yamamoto 
and Aragaki, 1982; Nishijima, 1999).
The organisms associated with damping 
off of seedlings of papaya are found worldwide 
and can be problematic in both the nursery 
and the field (Persley and Ploetz, 2003).
Control measures
Damping off typically occurs when seed is 
planted into cold, wet soil and is further en￾hanced by poor soil drainage and repeated 
plantings of papaya on the same ground. 
High humidity levels and planting the seed 
too deeply will also encourage the develop￾ment of the disease. Plant residues of any kind 
can also provide a ready source of inoculum 
from which disease can develop in newly 
transplanted seedlings (Hine et al., 1965).
Cultural control methods such as growing 
seedlings on raised benches in pasteurized 
potting media free of soil and plant material 
and regulating irrigation are recommended. 
The chemicals propamocarb, metalaxyl-M, 
furalaxyl and potassium phosphonate have 
been shown to effectively control Pythi￾um-related damping off in containerized 
papaya seedlings (Male and Vawdrey, 2010). 
Metalaxyl-M is also used as a pre-transplant 
application in the field to control root rot in 
newly transplanted seedlings (Vawdrey and 
Westerhuis, 2007). Research by Campos et al. 
(2009) and Botelho et al. (2014) showed that 
pre-emergent damping off caused by R. 
solani could be reduced by treating seed 
with the chemicals triadimenol, pencycu￾ron, thiabendazole, fludioxonil, captan and 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.

tolylfluanid. However, at post-emergence, 
fungicides alone did not control the disease.
14.2.3 Collar rot
Symptoms
Young affected papaya seedlings in the field 
develop necrotic tissues at the basal stem 
and crown level. As the collar rot develops 
these plants express symptoms of stunting, 
leaf chlorosis and lodging. Orange-to-red 
perithecia are visible at the base of the stem 
(Laemmlen and Aragaki, 1971; Nishijima 
and Aragaki 1973; Male et al., 2012).
Causal organism and disease distribution
The causal agent of collar rot is Calonectria 
ilicicola. Colonies recovered in Australia 
were fast growing on artificial culture media 
with abundant white, floccose, aerial myce￾lia and in reverse the colonies were salmon 
coloured. Orange-to-red perithecia appeared 
after 20 days. Asci were clavate, 90–140 × 
12–20 μm in size and contained eight as￾cospores which were tapered to a long thin 
stalk. Ascospores were hyaline, fusoid, slightly 
curved and 35–50 × 6–8 μm in size. Macro￾conidia were hyaline, cylindrical, one to 
three septate and 45–90 × 4–7 μm in size 
and were borne on branched, non-septate 
conidiophores (Male et al., 2012).
Collar rot has been reported as an occa￾sional important disease on young papaya 
plants grown on poorly drained ground 
replanted to papaya in high rainfall areas in 
Hawaii, Brazil and Australia (Laemmlen 
and Aragaki, 1971; Nishijima and Aragaki, 
1973; Crous, 2002; Male et al., 2012).
Control measures
Some papaya cultivars are reported to have 
resistance to collar rot. With increasing sus￾ceptibility these include ‘Kapoho Solo’, ‘Line 
8’, ‘Waimanalo’ and ‘Sunrise Solo’ (Nishijima 
and Aragaki, 1973). Due to the low disease 
incidence, treatment of the soil with fungi￾cides is generally not practised.
14.2.4 Brown spot
Symptoms
On the adaxial surface of the leaf, the lesions 
appear greyish to whitish in colour, slightly 
sunken, with a fine dark margin and yellow 
halo which can be 4–8 mm wide (Fig. 14.2). 
On the abaxial surface, small, light brown 
water-soaked lesions appear first, followed 
by fully developed lesions which have 
slightly water-soaked brown centres 2 mm 
in diameter. Once the lesions start to develop 
they can reach 10 mm in diameter. Later, as 
the lesions expand they become slightly 
sunken, with brown-reddish margins sur￾rounded by a prominent yellow halo. Lower 
leaves of the plant are particularly suscep￾tible (Peterson et al., 1993).
On petioles, long elliptical lesions (often 
several centimetres in diameter) develop along 
and parallel to the petiole. These lesions have 
well-defined margins and white centres coated 
with dark masses of conidia. As the leaf begins 
to senesce these lesions darken due to the in￾tense fungal sporulation (Peterson et al., 1993).
Under high disease pressure, small dark 
sunken lesions, 0.5–3 cm in diameter will 
develop on fruit. With both green and mature 
ripe fruit, individual sunken lesions can 
occur or these can coalesce and cover large 
areas of the fruit surface. The brown spot 
pathogen is also known to cause postharvest 
fruit rot, entering the fruit via wounds. Seed￾lings infected with brown spot develop se￾vere necrotic lesions on the stem and leaves, 
leaves drop and sometimes the plant dies 
(Conover, 1978; Liberato and Zambolim, 2002).

Causal organism and disease distribution
The fungus Corynespora cassiicola which 
has a broad host range, particularly in the 
tropics, is the cause of brown spot of papaya 
(Ellis and Holliday, 1971). The fungus pro￾duces conidiophores which are mostly hy￾pophyllous, erect, mostly simple, sparingly 
septate, dark brown, up to 600 μm long × 
4–11 μm wide, with successive cylindrical 
proliferations which are variable in length 
(10–100 μm) and lighter in colour towards 
the apex. Conidia are usually solitary, obcla￾vate to cylindrical, straight or often slightly 
curved, tapering towards the apex, pale 
olivaceous brown in colour, smooth, 4–20 
pseudoseptate, 32–220 μm in length and 
8–22 μm wide at the broadest point with a 
hilum that is conspicuous (Wei, 1950).
The disease has a wide geographical 
distribution and has been reported in American 
Samoa, Australia, Barbados, Belize, Brazil, 
Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micro￾nesia, Fiji, Florida, Wallis and Futuna, India, 
Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Malaysia, 
Nigeria, Niue, the Philippines, Papua New 
Guinea, Puerto Rico, Samoa, the Solomon 
Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Florida, Vanuatu, 
Venezuela, the Virgin Islands and Samoa 
(Liberato and McTaggart, 2006).
Control measures
Conidia are dispersed by air, particularly 
during wet, windy weather. Disease devel￾opment is favoured by hot, humid weather 
(Peterson et al., 1993). Fortnightly applications 
of protectant and systemic fungicides are 
necessary to manage this disease (Vawdrey 
et al., 2008). Research by Vivas et al. (2015) 
showed that the genotypes ‘Maradol’, 
‘Americano’ and ‘Tainung’ from the heterotic 
group ‘Formosa’ were the most promising 
genotypes at reducing the severity of many 
of the leaf diseases of papaya.
14.2.5 Black spot
Symptoms
The initial symptoms of black spot are 
small circular water-soaked spots (1–3 mm 
diameter) which develop on both leaf sur￾faces of older leaves and become necrotic 
and brown to black in colour. Black conidial 
masses form on these lesions on the underside 
of leaves (Fig. 14.3). Affected leaves curl, 
become necrotic, brittle and subsequently 
die under severe disease pressure which 
results in extensive defoliation. This loss of 
leaf can lead to fruit blemishes due to sun￾burn. Lesions on fruit begin as small black 
dots that can enlarge to 2–6 mm in diam￾eter. The tissue beneath these lesions re￾mains firm but the value of harvested fruit 
with these symptoms is reduced (Peterson 
et al., 1993).
Causal organism and disease 
distribution
The fungus Asperisporium caricae produces 
sporodochia which are hypophyllous and 
dark brown to black in colour. The stroma are 
well developed and erumpent. Conidiophores 
are closely packed together and cover the 
surface of the stroma; they are usually un￾branched, hyaline to olivaceous brown in 
colour with several prominent conidial scars 
at the apex, up to 45 × 6–9 μm in length. Co￾nidia are solitary, ellipsoidal, pyriform or cla￾vate, one-septate, hyaline to mid-pale brown 
in colour, verrucose, and 14–26 × 7–10 μm 
in size (Ellis and Holliday, 1972).
The disease has been reported in 
Argentina, Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Col￾umbia, Cuba, El Salvador, Florida, India, 
Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, Puerto 
Rico, the Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri 
Lanka, Tanzania, Venezuela and Zimbabwe 
(Liberato et al., 2006a).

Cooler temperatures and intermittent mois￾ture such as dew and rain showers favour 
disease development (Peterson and Grice, 
1994). Applications of protective and systemic 
fungicides at 14–28 day intervals, depending 
on rainfall, have been shown to be effective 
in controlling this disease. The removal of 
severely affected older leaves prior to spray￾ing these fungicides has been shown to greatly 
enhance disease control (Ross and Chay￾Prove, 2000; Vawdrey et al., 2008). In an 
evaluation of papaya genotypes, Vivas et al. 
(2015) found the following genotypes were 
potential sources of resistance genes which 
could be used in a breeding programme: ‘STZ 
23 PL’, ‘Maradol’, ‘Maradol GL’, ‘JS 11’, 
‘Americano’, ‘Caliman SG’, ‘Sekati’, ‘Sekati 
FLM’, ‘Waimanalo’, ‘Caliman AM’, ‘Papaya 
46’, ‘Tailândia’ and ‘SH 12-06’.
14.2.6 Cercospora black spot
Symptoms
Not to be confused with black spot of papaya, 
Cercospora black spot causes leaf spots 
which are irregularly shaped, greyish-white 
lesions 1–5 mm in diameter compared with 
the brown-to-black spots of A. caricae. Dam￾age to trees is usually negligible but under 
heavy disease pressure, leaf yellowing, ne￾crosis and defoliation are known to occur.
Fruit spots start as tiny black dots 
which enlarge to about 3 mm in diameter. 
The spots are superficial, slightly raised and 
can result in corky tissue developing under 
the spot. These spots do not develop into a 
fruit rot. Spots, however, are somewhat ob￾scure on green fruits but become readily vis￾ible when the skin colour turns yellow as 
the fruit ripens. Actual damage to fruits is 
minor except for its impact on appearance 
and marketability (Nishijima, 1994).
Causal organism and disease distribution
The fungus Cercospora papaya produces 
hyaline, multiseptate conidia which are 
20–75 × 3–5 μm in size and are produced on 
brown, multiseptate, unbranched conidio￾phores that are 50–200 × 3–6 μm in size. 
Stromata are usually produced on the upper 
leaf surface (Chupp, 1954). Conidia are the 
primary inoculum source and are dispersed 
by wind from infected papaya leaves in 
nearby orchards.
The disease occurs in most countries 
where papaya is grown and its development 
is favoured by warm, wet weather (Persley 
and Ploetz, 2003).
Control measures
In Hawaii, Cercospora black spot is a prob￾lem when orchards are not sprayed on a 
regular basis or when protective sprays are 
not applied as the first fruit are developing 
(Persley and Ploetz, 2003).
14.2.7 Powdery mildew
Symptoms
Powdery mildew of papaya causes water￾soaked spots covered with white powdery 
fungal mats. These appear initially on the 
underside of leaves, often adjacent to the 
leaf veins, on leaf petioles and at the base of 
flowers. Occasionally, pale green to yellow 
spots arise on the upper side of the leaves 
sometimes covered with white mould. These 
spots may turn necrotic and be surrounded by 
a yellow halo. Infected leaves later wither 
and curl inwards. The fruit may show mats 
of white mould of various sizes. As the fruit 
matures the white mould disappears leaving 
light grey scarred areas on the fruit surface 
and some malformation of the mature fruit 
(Simmonds, 1965; Peterson et al., 1993). 
Powdery mildew infection generally causes 
little damage to older bearing trees, how￾ever, in young plants it can lead to death of 
growing tissues, defoliation, stem and fruit 
lesions and yield loss.
Causal organism and disease distribution
Using morphological and phylogenetic ana￾lyses, five different Erysiphe species have

been identified causing powdery mildew 
on papaya, viz. Erysiphe caricae, Erysiphe 
caricae-papayae sp. nov., Erysiphe diffusa
(= Oidium caricae), Erysiphe fallax sp. nov. 
and Erysiphe necator (Braun et al., 2017).
Powdery mildew of papaya occurs in 
most papaya-producing countries of the world 
(Persley and Ploetz, 2003).
Control measures
Several protectant and systemic fungicides 
provide good control when severe outbreaks 
of this disease occur (Peterson et al., 1993). 
In greenhouse and field studies, Vivas et al. 
(2017) found there were papaya genotypes 
with a level of tolerance to powdery mildew.
14.2.8 Postharvest rots
Postharvest diseases caused by fungi are the 
most important problem during the handling 
and storage of papaya (Singh, 2010). Surface 
rots caused by brown spot (Corynespora 
cassiicola), black spot (Asperisporium 
caricae), Cercospora black spot (Cercospora 
papayae) and Phytophthora fruit rot (P. 
palmivora) are not included in this section 
as fruit affected by these diseases is usually 
culled before packing.
Symptoms
There are many fungi associated with post￾harvest decay of papaya. Anthracnose and stem￾end rot are considered the most common of 
these diseases (Snowdon, 1990; Bautista￾Banos et al., 2013; Vawdrey et al., 2016).
With anthracnose, the first symptoms 
are small, well-defined dried pink spots on 
the surface of ripening fruit which later 
grow to 5 cm in diameter, rounded, sunken 
(3–5 mm deep) and brown to black in col￾our. The lesions can be either water soaked 
or dried and hard. Dark acervuli of the fun￾gus are produced in these lesions often in a 
concentric pattern. Salmon-to-pink gelatin￾ous conidial masses are released from the 
acervuli under favourable climatic conditions. 
Symptoms on immature fruit are uncommon 
(Alvarez and Nishijima, 1987).
Depending on the identity of the causal 
organism, symptoms of stem-end rot can be 
either soft, broad, water-soaked lesions which 
penetrate deep into the flesh of ripening 
fruit, or firm, dry, wrinkled and blackened 
lesions which develop around the stem end. 
Mycelial growth on the surface of these lesions 
tends to be dotted with black fruiting bodies 
of these fungi (Snowdon, 1990; Persley and 
Ploetz, 2003).
Causal organisms and disease distribution
Anthracnose is caused by the fungus Colle￾totrichum gloeosporioides and stem-end rot 
can be caused by a suite of fungi such as 
Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Phomopsis cari￾cae-papayae and Mycosphaerella caricae
(Snowdon, 1990).
Other fungi which are no less important 
include Fusarium spp. (Fusarium fruit rot 
disease), Alternaria solani (Alternaria fruit 
spot), Rhizopus stolonifer (Rhizopus soft 
rot), Penicillium digitatum (Penicillium 
rot) and Guignardia spp. (Guignardia spot) 
(Snowdon, 1990).
Minor postharvest rots are also caused by 
Stemphylium lycopersici (Stemphylium rot), 
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (chocolate 
spot), Mucor spp. and Aspergillus spp. (Chau 
and Alvarez, 1983; Rahman et al., 2008).
These postharvest diseases of papaya 
fruit are reported in most papaya-producing 
countries of the world (Snowdon, 1990).
Control measures
In papaya as in other fruit commodities, the 
removal of dead leaves is known to help re￾duce disease inoculum in close proximity 
to developing fruit (Alvarez and Nishijima, 
1987). Control of papaya rots for the export 
market is dependent on the import-export 
regulations while fruit marketed nationally 
relies on the use of postharvest fungicides. 
However, due to human health and envir￾onmental concerns other control methods 
for fruit in storage have been researched.
Research conducted in a number of coun￾tries that grow papaya has reported positive 
benefits of using postharvest hot water dips 
or sprays for disease control, particularly 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsDiseases 211
for anthracnose and stem-end rots (Martins 
et al., 2010; Diczbalis et al., 2015; Stice et al., 
2016). These studies have shown that the ef￾ficacy of hot water treatments is dependent 
upon an interaction of water temperature 
and exposure time. Research by Diczbalis 
et al. (2015) clearly showed that a hot water 
temperature of between 50°C and 52°C with 
a 5 min exposure time was optimum for ef￾fectively controlling disease without incur￾ring significant heat damage to fruit.
Research evaluating fruit-coating addi￾tives such as ammonium carbonate or so￾dium bicarbonate have shown promising 
results in minimizing disease incidence in 
papaya (Sivakumar et al., 2002; Henriod 
et al., 2016). Ammonium carbonate in a wax 
formulation effectively reduced the incidence 
of anthracnose by 60% compared with un￾treated fruit (90%) following 21 days in cool 
storage and another 2 days under marketing 
conditions (Sivakumar et al., 2002).
14.3 Diseases Caused by Bacteria
14.3.1 Bacterial crown rot, bacterial canker, 
bacterial dieback and bacterial decline
A number of bacterial diseases with similar 
symptoms affect the upper canopy of papaya 
plants. These include bacterial crown rot, 
bacterial canker, bacterial dieback and bac￾terial decline and are considered some of the 
most important diseases affecting papaya. In 
the late 1960s, bacterial decline decimated 
the papaya fields in the West Indies where the 
cultivar ‘Solo’ was grown for its high yields 
and fruit quality (Ollitrault et al., 2007). In 
2003, bacterial dieback was first reported in 
Malaysia by the Jahor State Department of 
Agriculture and by the end of 2006 it had 
spread to five other states on the west coast 
of the Malaysian Peninsula affecting around 
800 ha of papaya (Maktar et al., 2008).
Symptoms
The symptoms of these diseases include 
angular water-soaked lesions on leaves and 
petioles causing leaves at the top of the canopy 
to wilt and die. Firm, water-soaked cankers 
develop on the stem causing the eventual rot 
of the apical shoot (Fig. 14.4). However, the 
advanced stage of bacterial dieback reported 
by Maktar et al. (2008) had no stem canker 
symptom. Small water-soaked lesions also 
develop on green fruit and these can develop 
into firm depressed rots as the fruit matures. 
These rotted areas can penetrate as far as the 
seed cavity.
Causal organism and disease distribution
The pathogen which causes bacterial crown 
rot, Bacillus papaya, was first described by 
von Rant from samples collected in Java in 
1931. Some years later, Magrou (1937) fur￾ther typed the bacterium into the genus Er￾winia sp. Similarly, diseases in the Carib￾bean and Mariana Islands were shown to 
be caused by bacteria in the genus Erwinia
(Trujillo and Schroth, 1982; Webb, 1985) but 
were never identified to the species level. 
In 2004, Gardan et al. described the causal 
organism of papaya bacterial canker in the 
Caribbean region as Erwinia papayae sp. nov.
Similarly in 2008, Maktar et al. described 
E. papayae as causing bacterial dieback in 
Fig. 14.4. Symptoms of bacterial canker of papaya.

Malaysia and Fullerton et al. (2011) also 
reported an E. papayae-like bacterium as 
the cause of bacterial crown rot in the King￾dom of Tonga. However, in 2011, Amin et al. 
reported that Erwinia mallotivora was the 
cause of bacterial dieback disease in Penin￾sular Malaysia and De la Cueva et al. (2017) 
reported the bacterial crown rot pathogen 
in the Philippines as being E. mallotivora.
These bacterial diseases have become 
major constraints to production in many 
papaya-producing countries including 
Anguilla, Antigua, Martinique, Montserrat, 
Barbados, Barbuda, Brazil, Dominica, Fiji, 
Guadeloupe, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, 
the North Mariana Islands, the Philippines, 
Saint Croix, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint 
Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, 
Taiwan, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Vene￾zuela and the Virgin Islands (BICON, 2018).
Control measures
Small water-soaked lesions which develop 
on green fruit later develop into firm de￾pressed lesions which can enter the seed 
cavity. Obrero (1980) reported that the crown 
rot bacterium could be isolated from seed of 
infected papaya fruit and this pathogen was 
found to be viable in seed for at least 30 
days after an extraction and air-drying pro￾cess. These findings and the reported out￾break of the disease at a research facility on 
the isolated Kingdom of Tonga in 2009 
(Fullerton et al., 2011) where imported cul￾tivars were being evaluated for commercial 
release suggests that seed-borne transmission 
is the most likely mechanism of initiating 
an infection. Although seed transmission is 
as yet unproven, countries need to ensure 
that imported seed is certified as being free 
of this disease. Authorities in Australia rec￾ommend that seed be either surface steril￾ized in a solution of 1% available chlorine for 
not less than 10 min or placed in hot water 
at 50°C for not less than 20 min as a means 
of decontaminating seed (BICON, 2018).
Research has also shown that the patho￾gen does not survive well in association 
with papaya roots, is short lived in decaying 
diseased plant material, and does not survive 
longer than 2 weeks in soil (Webb, 1985). 
Experience in the Philippines (C. Sison, 
Cagayan de Oro, 2008, personal communi￾cation) also suggests there is no carry-over 
of the disease in following plantings of pa￾paya. Research conducted by Obrero (1980) 
found there was no evidence of insect or snail 
transmission. However, studies by Trujillo 
and Schroth (1982) showed the giant African 
snail was a vector of the disease. The Erwin￾ia sp. is believed to survive from season to 
season inside the infected vascular bundles 
of diseased plants (Obrero, 1980). Conse￾quently, crop hygiene and the removal of 
infected papaya plants are seen as important 
in the management of this disease.
Numerous research projects and breed￾ing programmes to assess resistance to this 
disease have been conducted in many papaya￾producing countries (Obrero, 1980; Trujillo 
and Schroth, 1982; Webb, 1985; Ollitrault 
et al., 2007). Results from this work suggest 
that tolerant commercial cultivars are available 
and the opportunity exists for the develop￾ment of new disease-resistant commercial 
cultivars derived from ‘wild’ resistant papaya 
species.
14.3.2 Bacterial postharvest rots
Symptoms
Two bacterial diseases, ‘internal yellowing’ 
and ‘purple stain fruit rot’, are also known to 
cause minor postharvest rots. Internal yellow￾ing causes the pulp within red-fleshed fruit to 
develop a yellow soft decay with an offensive 
odour. This rot develops around the seed 
cavity primarily near the fruit calyx and mid￾dle portions of the fruit but is not visible 
externally (Nishijima et al., 1987). Similarly 
purple stain fruit rot does not produce ex￾ternal fruit symptoms but is characterized by 
violet to purple streaks in the vascular tissue 
and laticifers surrounding the seed cavity. 
Affected rotted areas produce an offensive 
odour and taste (Nelson and Alvarez, 1980).
Causal organisms and disease distribution
‘Internal yellowing’ caused by Enterobacter 
cloacae and ‘purple stain fruit rot’ caused

by Erwinia herbicola have been observed in 
Hawaii (Nelson and Alvarez, 1980; Nishijima 
et al., 1987).
Control measures
Research by Nishijima et al. (1987) showed 
that the hot water treatment of fruit (42°C 
for 30 min followed by 49°C for 20 min) was 
effective at controlling these diseases.
14.4 Virus Diseases
14.4.1 Papaya leaf curl disease
Papaya leaf curl disease is an emerging 
economically important virus disease of pa￾paya, and is a production limiting factor for 
areas of papaya production in India (Dubey 
et al., 2015) and China (Wang et al., 2004).
Symptoms
Symptoms include yellowing and curling 
of leaves, vein clearing and thickening of 
leaves. Affected leaves become brittle and 
leathery and severe infections can also 
cause twisted petioles and stunting (Nariani, 
1956; Saxena et al., 1998a). Diseased plants 
produce no fruit, or small distorted fruit that 
drop early. In advanced stages, defoliation 
occurs and growth ceases (Nariani, 1956).
Causal organism and disease distribution
Papaya leaf curl virus was originally described 
as the causal agent (Saxena et al., 1998b) 
though currently 33 different begomoviruses 
have been reported infecting papaya mostly 
causing leaf curl symptoms. Begomoviruses 
are transmitted by the silver-leaf whitefly 
Bemisia tabaci (Hull, 2013).
Papaya leaf curl disease has been reported 
in India (Thomas and Krishnaswami, 1939), 
Pakistan (Nadeem et al., 1997), Nigeria (Taylor, 
2003), Taiwan (Chang et al., 2003) and China 
(Wang et al., 2004).
14.4.2 Papaya ringspot disease
Papaya ringspot is a widespread and destruc￾tive disease in most countries where papaya 
is grown.
Symptoms
Characteristic dark green sunken rings de￾velop on fruit (Fig. 14.5A) of affected plants 
(Jensen, 1949) with plants of all ages sus￾ceptible and symptoms being more severe 
during cooler weather. The rings often

persist as dark orange to brown markings as 
fruit mature. Dark green, water-soaked streaks 
develop on petioles and stems. Mottle and 
mosaic patterns of varying severity develop 
on leaves (Fig. 14.5B) that often have a ruf￾fled appearance with one or more leaf lobes 
becoming severely distorted and reduced in 
size, giving a shoestring appearance. Affected 
plants become stunted and fruit set is mark￾edly reduced or absent and affected fruit have 
poor flavour, a leathery appearance, and are 
predisposed to fungal fruit rots (Cook, 1972; 
Peterson et al., 1993; Gonsalves, 1994).
Causal organism and disease distribution
Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) is a species in 
the genus Potyvirus in the family Potyviri￾dae (Purcifull et al., 1984). Papaya ringspot 
virus-type P (PRSV-P) affects papaya and 
cucurbits and is the causal agent of papaya 
ringspot disease. Papaya ringspot virus-type 
W (PRSV-W) affects cucurbits but not papaya. 
Transmission of PRSV-P is almost entirely 
due to transitory aphid populations as papaya 
is not a preferred host for aphids (Mora￾Aguilera et al., 1992). PRSV is not regarded 
as being seed transmitted in either papaya 
or cucurbits (Purcifull et al., 1984), although 
there is one report from the Philippines of 
seed transmission of PRSV-P in seed of a 
local papaya cultivar (Bayot et al., 1990).
PRSV-P severely limits production in 
many countries of South-east Asia (the Phil￾ippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam), Africa, 
India, Brazil, Venezuela, the Caribbean 
islands, Mexico, the USA and the Pacific is￾lands (Persley and Ploetz, 2003; Davis and 
Ruabete, 2010). The disease has a restricted 
distribution in Queensland, Australia, and 
is not present in the major production area 
(Thomas and Dodman, 1993).
Control measures
Quarantine and roguing can delay the spread 
of the disease but do not usually provide long￾term control (Yeh et al., 1988; Gonsalves, 
1998). Establishing plantations with seedling 
plants free of PRSV is essential, and these should 
be situated as far as possible from affected 
plantations (Gonsalves, 1994). Plantations 
can be surrounded by non-host crops or 
interplanted with other tree crops as aphids 
probe first on non-host species and lose 
their ability to transmit the virus in the pro￾cess. Cross protection using a mild strain of 
PRSV-P to protect against a severe strain has 
worked, but is of limited value in commer￾cial applications (Gonsalves, 1998).
Several tolerant cultivars have been de￾veloped, which generally develop milder leaf 
symptoms and are able to set reasonable quan￾tities of marketable fruit (Escudero et al., 
1994; Gonsalves, 1994). Resistance to PRSV-P 
has been found in relatives of papaya and 
intergeneric hybrids have been created (Drew 
et al., 2005; Siar et al., 2011) with resistance to 
PRSV and backcrossed to produce commer￾cially acceptable fruit (Drew et al., 2006).
Genetically engineered cultivars with 
resistance to PRSV-P have been made (Fitch 
et al., 1992), and following commercial 
success in Hawaii (Ferreira et al., 2002) the 
technique has been duplicated in other parts 
of the world (Yeh et al., 1997; Lines et al., 
2002; Bau et al., 2004; Fermin et al., 2004; 
Tennant et al., 2005).
14.4.3 Papaya leaf distortion mosaic disease
Symptoms
The symptoms can vary according to virus 
strain, cultivar, age of plants and environ￾ment. The crowns of infected plants have a 
rosette appearance with small leaves and 
short petioles. Leaves develop a mosaic 
pattern, yellow mottling and become dis￾torted. The stem diameter is often less than 
half that of healthy plants and dark green or 
water-soaked streaks and spots develop on 
the stem and petioles. Chlorotic spots with 
green centres develop on young fruit and 
often become swollen and surrounded by a 
dark green or brown ring. Symptoms are 
more severe when plants are stressed and 
during cool weather (Kawano and Yonaka, 
1992). The rosettes of leaves and slender peti￾oles on the crowns of infected plants and the 
swellings surrounding the fruit ring spots 
help to distinguish this disease from that 
caused by PRSV-P.

Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditionsDiseases 215
Causal organism and disease distribution
The disease is caused by Papaya leaf distor￾tion mosaic virus (PLDMV) in the family 
Potyviridae. It has both a papaya-specific 
and cucurbit-specific strain similar to PRSV 
(Maoka and Hataya, 2005). It is spread by 
aphids in a non-persistent manner with no 
evidence of seed transmission. PLDMV is the 
most prevalent virus disease of papaya in 
Japan and is also present in Saipan, Taiwan 
and China (Maoka et al., 1995; Bau et al., 2008; 
Tuo et al., 2013).
Control measures
Similar cultural practices as for PRSV will 
reduce the incidence of this disease. A dual 
PRSV and PLDMV transgenic resistant cul￾tivar has been developed (Kung et al., 2009).
14.4.4 Papaya meleira (sticky) disease
Symptoms
The disease is characterized by an exudation 
of watery latex from fruit. The latex is trans￾lucent, much less viscous than it is in non￾diseased fruit and does not coagulate readily. 
Affected fruit become stained as the latex 
oxidizes (Fig. 14.6). Other symptoms which 
may occur include leaf-tip burn in younger 
plants due to latex exudation and small 
light brown necrotic lesions on the leaf tips 
and petioles. Other fruit symptoms include 
malformation, small irregular light green areas 
on the surface of immature fruit, small in￾ternal blotches in the pulp and latex inside 
the fruit cavity (Maciel-Zambolim et al., 2003; 
Perez-Brito et al., 2012; Abreu et al., 2015).
Causal organism and disease distribution
The disease is associated with two viruses, an 
unusual double-stranded RNA virus, Papaya 
meleira virus (PMeV) and a single-stranded 
RNA virus, Papaya meleira virus 2 (PMeV2) 
which has some similarities to the umbravi￾ruses (Antunes et al., 2016), and is required 
for the expression of symptoms. Both viruses 
can be found in high concentrations in 
the laticifers of infected plants. PMeV and 
PMeV2 are seed transmitted (Tapia-Tussell 
et al., 2015) and efficiently mechanically 
transmitted through infected latex (Perez￾Brito et al., 2012). Experimentally, the silver￾leaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci has been shown 
to transmit PMeV under laboratory condi￾tions (Rodrigues et al., 2009). Natural infec￾tion of watermelon fields close to infected 
papaya orchards with PMeV2 has been 
shown (García-Cámara et al., 2017).
Papaya meleira disease is present in 
Brazil, Mexico and Australia. An isolate of 
PMeV2 has been reported from Ecuador, but is 
symptomless (Rodrigues et al., 1989; Perez￾Brito et al., 2012; Quito-Avila et al., 2015).
14.5 Diseases Caused by Phytoplasmas 
and Rickettsias
Phytoplasmas are specialized bacteria that 
are obligate, phloem-limited pathogens. They 
lack a cell wall, are bound by a triple￾layered membrane, and are unable to be 
cultured. They are associated with disease 
in hundreds of plant species (McCoy, 1989). 
The phytoplasmas are spread by phloem￾feeding homopteran insects, mainly leafhop￾pers and planthoppers and less frequently by 
psyllids (Weintraub and Beanland, 2006). 
Rickettsias are Alphaproteobacteria; Gram￾negative bacteria that are known pathogens 
of vertebrates but are mostly symbionts of 
invertebrates.

14.5.1 Papaya dieback disease
Symptoms
Typical symptoms of dieback are a bunched 
appearance and chlorosis of the inner crown 
leaves, with one or more of these leaves shriv￾elling and dying. The growing point bends 
and the larger crown leaves rapidly develop 
chlorosis and then necrosis. The entire crown 
dies within 1–4 weeks and the stem gradually 
dies back from the apex (Simmonds, 1965; 
Glennie and Chapman, 1976). As the disease 
progresses the older leaves yellow but 
remain attached to form a fringe around the 
dead top. Fruit on affected trees become 
flabby, drop off and often develop severe 
fungal spotting. The phloem laticifers die 
and there is a marked reduction in latex 
flow (Simmonds, 1965; Harding and Teakle, 
1988; Siddique et al., 1998).
Causal organism and disease 
distribution
Papaya dieback disease is caused the phyto￾plasma Candidatus Phytoplasma austral￾iense. The phytoplasma associated with 
papaya dieback is a member of the European 
stolbur group (16SrXII-B) within the aster 
yellows cluster (Gibb et al., 1996). It is very 
closely related to phytoplasmas associ￾ated with Australian grapevine yellows 
and Phormium yellow leaf disease in New 
Zealand.
Currently there is no definitively iden￾tified vector(s) to papaya dieback phyto￾plasma, though there is evidence that it is 
transmitted by an insect vector from several 
experiments in central and south Queensland, 
Australia (Elder et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 
2006) where plants protected by netting did 
not develop disease symptoms. Outbreaks 
of dieback in Queensland were usually as￾sociated with dry conditions in late winter 
and early spring that caused surrounding 
vegetation to dry (Elder et al., 2002).
Papaya dieback caused by a subgroup 
16SrXII has been reported from Australia, 
Israel (Nivun Haamir dieback disease) (Franck 
and Bar-Joseph, 1992; Gera et al., 2005), 
Ethiopia (Bekele et al., 2011) as well as 
Taiwan (Bau et al., 2011). A similar disease 
caused by a subgroup 16SrII phytoplasma is 
present in western India (Rao et al., 2011).
Control measures
Plants can be ratooned by cutting them ~75 
cm above ground level upon symptom 
development which results in healthy side 
shoots. These side shoots generally are free 
of detectable phytoplasmas although plants 
are susceptible to further dieback episodes 
(Guthrie et al., 1998). Other measures in￾clude protecting plants with insect netting 
and the application of systemic insecticides 
to protect plants during times of expected 
dieback activity (Franck and Bar-Joseph, 1992; 
Walsh et al., 2006).
14.5.2 Papaya yellow crinkle/mosaic
Symptoms
The first symptom of yellow crinkle disease 
is a pronounced yellowing of leaves about 
halfway up the canopy, giving a yellow ring 
appearance to plants. The chlorosis is ac￾companied by a downward bending of the 
petioles. The crown leaves develop thin, 
translucent areas along the margin and be￾tween the main veins. These areas become 
tattered and chlorotic as growth proceeds, 
giving a ragged appearance to the leaf (Sim￾monds, 1965). The crown leaves eventually 
become claw like in appearance, and the 
older leaves dry and fall, leaving a bare stem 
with a few stunted leaves at the top. Plants 
may remain in this condition for many 
months making no growth and eventually 
dying. Floral parts exhibit phyllody and 
proliferation of axillary leaves, which are 
strap like and thickened.
Plants affected by mosaic develop 
several symptoms, though not all may be 
present at one time. Affected plants develop 
stunted, chlorotic young leaves with trans￾lucent areas around the margins that may 
wither to give a ragged effect. The petioles 
and upper portions of the stem develop 
narrow, water-soaked streaks, and latex flow 
is much reduced or absent. The plants are 
often stunted, producing multiple side shoots 
which often then develop typical mosaic

symptoms. The younger fruit on long-term 
affected plants often show characteristic light 
green areas, sharply delimited from the darker 
green normal areas and extending out from 
the stem end. Latex is absent from the light 
areas but occurs in normal quantities outside 
these areas (Simmonds, 1965).
It often is difficult to differentiate yellow 
crinkle from mosaic disease, but the water￾soaked streaks on the petioles and upper 
portion of the stem and the reduced or absent 
latex flow are characteristics of mosaic. A 
distinguishing feature of yellow crinkle is 
phyllody (Fig. 14.7), which has not been 
observed on plants with mosaic disease 
(Peterson et al., 1993).
Causal organism and disease distribution
A consistent association between phytoplas￾ma and yellow crinkle and mosaic has been 
demonstrated using PCR and phytoplasma￾specific primers (Gibb et al., 1996; Liu et al., 
1996; Guthrie et al., 1998). Based on DNA 
sequence analyses, the yellow crinkle- and 
mosaic-associated phytoplasmas are indis￾tinguishable and have been included in the 
taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma australasia’ 
(16SrII) (White et al., 1998; De la Rue et al., 
1999), which is distinct from ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma australiense’ the agent that is 
associated with dieback disease (White et al., 
1998). In a 3-year study in northern Austra￾lia, Padovan and Gibb (2001) reported that 
five strains of phytoplasma were found in 
plants with yellow crinkle. The most preva￾lent were tomato big bud (TBB) and sweet 
potato little leaf (SPLL).
The TBB phytoplasma has been shown 
to be transmitted by a leafhopper, Orosius 
argentatus (Hill, 1943) and phytoplasma￾positive species of Orosius lotophagorum
and O. argentatus and have been detected in 
leaf crinkle infected papaya blocks (Padovan 
and Gibb, 2001).
Outbreaks of yellow crinkle usually occur 
following hot, dry weather that causes 
vectors to migrate from dry vegetation into 
irrigated papaya plantations (Peterson et al., 
1993; Elder et al., 2002). No consistent pattern 
was observed for mosaic (Elder et al., 2002).
Yellow crinkle and mosaic are present in 
Australia. Reports of similar diseases caused 
by a 16Sr1 phytoplasma has been reported 
in Mexico (Rojas-Martínez et al., 2011).
Control measures
Ratooning diseased plants is of little benefit 
in yellow crinkle and mosaic as the new shoots 
almost always develop disease symptoms. 
Thus, affected plants should be removed from 
plantations (Simmonds, 1965). Various forms 
of netting could be used to protect plants 
from potential vectors (Walsh et al., 2006).
14.5.3 Papaya bunchy top symptom
Papaya bunchy top symptom is one of two 
similar bunch top diseases, the other being 
bunchy top disease (which is described in the 
next section, Section 14.5.4). These bunchy top 
diseases are similar but they differ in their 
symptomology and causal agents.
Symptoms
The typical symptom of bunchy top symp￾tom is the ‘bunching appearance’ of the 
crown leaves. Other symptoms include leaf 
yellowing and crinkling, mosaic and stunting.

and small fruit, with no flowering or fruit 
set in the advanced stages of the disease. In 
young plants, the apical growing point bends, 
and there is chlorosis of the crown leaves, 
followed by necrosis at the base of the leaf 
(Arocha et al., 2003, 2005).
Causal organism and disease distribution
It was reported that a ‘Candidatus Phyto￾plasma aurantifolia’-related strain (16SrII) was 
associated with bunchy top symptom in east￾ern Cuba (Arocha et al., 2005). It was demon￾strated that the leafhopper Empoasca papayae
could transmit the disease (Acosta et al., 2017).
Papaya bunchy top symptom has been 
reported from Cuba (Arocha et al., 2003). 
Similar diseases identified with a 16SrII phy￾toplasma have been reported from India (Ver￾ma et al., 2012) and China (Yang et al., 2016).
14.5.4 Bunchy top disease
Symptoms
The initial symptoms of papaya bunchy top 
disease (PBT) include a faint mottling of the 
upper leaves with a reduction in the growth of 
the leaves and petioles. Small, discrete water￾soaked spots develop on affected stems and 
petioles, later developing into 1–2 mm diam￾eter irregular blotches. The laminae of infected 
leaves are thickened, with marginal and in￾terveinal chlorosis and necrosis. Petioles are 
almost horizontal and rigid and shortened. 
Apical growth stops, giving the plant the 
bunched appearance. Latex flow is reduced, 
and chronically affected plants only have a 
tuft of small leaves at the apex (Cook, 1972).
Causal organism and disease distribution
PBT is caused by a bacteria in the genus Rick￾ettsia (Davis et al., 1998). The bacteria is an 
obligate pathogen that lives in the laticifers 
of the papaya. Transmission of PBT has been 
demonstrated with the leafhopper E. papaya
(Acosta et al., 2017).
Papaya bunchy top is widespread 
throughout the Caribbean (Davis et al., 1996; 
Luis-Pantoja et al., 2015).
Control measures
Some varieties are more tolerant under low 
disease pressure (Davis, 1994). Application 
of persistent insecticides for vector control 
and topping of affected plants to allow de￾velopment of healthy axillary shoots shows 
some merit for control (Cook, 1972).
14.6 Conclusions
Current known fungal diseases of papaya 
have been well studied, and with correct 
fungicide application can be well managed 
in commercial operations. As management 
options for bacterial diseases are limited, 
further work, both in better characterizing 
the causal agents and in screening for resist￾ance, is a priority. As shown for PRSV, trans￾genic resistance can introduce durable 
resistance to viruses, and could be applied 
to other virus species, however, there has 
been limited uptake of this technology. This 
RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach 
does not work well for DNA-based viruses 
such as begomoviruses, so genetic resistance 
has to be sought. The use of high-throughput 
sequencing technologies and alternative 
gene transfer/knockout technologies can be 
used to accelerate the introduction of resist￾ance genes from Vasconcellea species into 
commercially acceptable papaya cultivars 
for viral and phytoplasma resistance. There is 
still a lot that is unknown about the epidemi￾ology of bacterial, viral and especially phy￾toplasma diseases of papaya.

15.1 Introduction
In single-stemmed crops such as the pine￾apple or the banana, in which growth takes 
precedence over flowering and fruiting, the 
natural range of climatic tolerance of the plant 
can be extended to somewhat different, less 
tropical zones without particular risk from 
an agronomic (and economic) viewpoint. 
But in the case of the papaya, after a brief 
juvenile phase, vegetative growth coincides 
with flower development – an inflorescence 
emerges continuously in the axil of each 
leaf, provided climatic and cultural factors 
are adequate. When environmental conditions 
are poor, flowering and fruiting are severely 
affected. Temperatures below 20°C have a 
very negative effect, causing among other 
problems, carpellody (Figs 15.1 and 15.2), 
sex changes in hermaphrodite flowers, 
reduced pollen viability, and low sugar 
content of the fruit. Furthermore, if the tem￾perature falls below 12–14°C for several 
hours, growth and production are severely 
affected, particularly in dioecious cultivars. 
When temperatures exceed 35°C sex rever￾sal phenomena of hermaphrodite flowers 
changing to functional male flowers can 
also occur (Nakasone and Paull, 1998). 
Thus, in theory, the production of papaya to 
be consumed as fresh fruit can only be done 
in the open in a stable tropical climate, and 
even then, cultural practices should be at an 
optimum level to maintain a high constant 
growth rate throughout the entire life of the 
plant in order to achieve maximum yield. 
Modern protected cultivation is the solu￾tion of choice for the mild subtropics, not 
only for maintaining a temperature ad￾equate to ensure an acceptable total soluble 
solid (TSS) content at maturity, but also to 
avoid damage caused by high winds and 
excesive rain like those caused by summer 
typhoons in places like Japan. While an 
average of 11.5% sugar content is the min￾imum requirement for papaya exports from 
Hawaii (Jung Chen et al., 2007), a min￾imum sugar content of 13% is required in 
Japan even for table fruit (H.Y. Yonemoto, 
Kagoshima, Japan, 2018, personal comuni￾cation) and this is only achieved by harvest￾ing fully mature papayas. In order to achieve 
these standards, particularly in winter in 
the subtropics, not only is it important that 
cultivars are chosen carefully and a proper 
greenhouse structure is provided, but also 
it may be necessary to limit exports of 
fresh papayas in those periods in winter 
in which these TSS contents are not 
achieved.

Spain is the main country producing 
papayas under greenhouse conditions, with 
around 300 ha of papaya (100% of comercial 
plantings) grown in 2017 in the Canary 
Islands (Gobierno de Canarias, 2019) and 
around 50 ha in the south-east of mainland 
Spain, mostly in Almería (Hueso et al., 2017a), 
and further plantings are planned for the near 
future. Commercial greenhouse cultivation is 
also done in Japan, with around 28 ha (Yone￾moto, 2011) under plastic or under net. Recently, 
production of papaya shipped as vegetables 
increased in the northern part of Japan, by 
planting seedlings in spring and harvesting 
green immature fruit from summer to autumn 
until the frost comes. Some growers in the 
Canary Islands also market small quantities 
(about 1500–2000 kg week-1) of immature pa￾payas as vegetables which are consumed by 
Asian populations in mainland Spain. A few 
plantings of papayas under greenhouse 
conditions also exist in: (i) Israel, with 10 ha 
on small Moshavim farms of 0.2–0.4 ha, some 
papayas being grown in the open and some 
in greenhouses; (ii) Morocco, with around 
20 ha of papaya cultivated in 2016 (FAO, 
2017), most of them in greenhouses; and (iii) 
Turkey, with only around 5 ha of papayas, 
about half grown in greenhouses (H. Gubbuk, 
Antalya, Turkey, 2018, personal communication).
Studies done in Brazil at the beginning 
of this century corroborate the economic 
interest of cultivating papayas in greenhouses 
even in the tropics to target some specific 
highly priced markets, recommending this as 
a commercial practice (Sabbag et al., 2000), 
although this recommendation has not been 
commercially developed. Also there have 
been some trials to cultivate papayas under 
greenhouse conditions in temperate areas 
such as Colorado (USA), concluding that 
with adequate light, heat and fertilization, 
papayas can indeed be grown in greenhouses 
in that state, but also that the commercial￾ization of papaya as a greenhouse crop is 
unlikely due to the slow rate of maturation 
and high cost of heating in the winter (An￾onymous, undated). Despite these problems 
the interest in consumption of tropical 
fruits in places like the Netherlands is so 
high that they are already considering the 
possibility of producing tropical fruits in 
the country using similar technology to that 
used for vegetables or flower production 
(Bakker, 2018).

15.2 Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Greenhouse Cultivation
The general advantages of greenhouse culti￾vation in the subtropics have been studied in 
depth in the Canary Islands (Galán Saúco, 
2002) and include:
• increase in temperatures during daytime 
hours in winter;
• protection against wind and other un￾favourable weather conditions (sunburn, 
hail, etc.);
• reduction in water consumption, as evapo￾transpiration is reduced by up to 25%;
• increase of light on the leaf surface lead￾ing to higher photosynthetic capacity;
• reducing the time for growth and the 
length of developmental phases; and
• improved production, both in quality 
and in quantity.
Greenhouse papayas grow and fruit bet￾ter than in the open as a consequence of 
exclusion of excessively cold or high tem￾peratures and wind protection, and exclusion 
of Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), provided 
good closing of the structure can be obtained, 
and as long as clean planting materials are 
used and Cucurbitaceae or other host plants 
are not interplanted with the crop (Espino 
de Paz et al., 1995; Rezende and Costa, 1995). 
This last advantage is of particular relevance 
as it is the only viable alternative to using 
genetically modified or transgenic cultivars 
such us ‘UH Rainbow’ or ‘UH SunUp’, com￾mercially cultivated in Hawaii (Nishina 
et al., 1998). These fruits are marketed in 
the continental USA and Canada and, more 
recently, in Japan (Anonymous, 2012), but 
are strongly objected to by other consumers, 
especially in the European Union (EU) (An￾onymous, 2016). Another advantage over 
open-air plantings in the subtropics is the 
prolonged harvest period, which can cover 
the whole year, with good quality fruit com￾manding excellent prices for out-of-season 
produce. Annual yields are also very high, 
with figures of over 100 t ha-1 year-1 obtained 
both in the Canary Islands and in Japan.
Some disadvantages associated with 
the use of greenhouses include the shorten￾ing of the commercial productive life of the 
plants as a consequence of greater internode 
length, which in turn means that plants are 
taller when flowering begins, quickly reach￾ing ceiling height. There is also increased in￾cidence of mites and powdery mildew, and 
little or no natural pollination of female flowers 
(Rodríguez Pastor et al., 1990; Rodríguez Pas￾tor and Galán Saúco, 1995), which can be a 
problem. Under subtropical conditions, how￾ever, with hermaphroditic plants, this last dis￾advantage is not a serious problem and certainly 
not in the Canary Islands, as in enclosed plant￾ings no pollination problems occur (Manica, 
1982; Nakasone and Paull, 1998). However, 
in dioecious plantings (male and female trees) 
parthenocarpic fruits may be produced in the 
absence of pollination under subtropical con￾ditions and hand pollination may be required 
to obtain commercial fruits. Female fruits 
are consumed in local markets, however, the 
commercial interest in Western markets are for 
hermaphrodite fruits coming from gynoico￾andromono cultivars. The cost of the greenhouse, 
the negative visual impact of the structure it￾self, and problems of lack of biodegradability 
of the cover materials are the chief drawbacks 
of greenhouse cultivation of papayas.
15.3 Types of Greenhouses
Many different types of greenhouses are used 
for papaya cultivation in the Canary Islands. 
Many are of the parral type similar to those 
used for bananas, and, as described by Galán 
Saúco (1992) and Galán Saúco et al. (1998) 
consist of a frame of galvanized steel pipe 
(5–10 cm in diameter and 6–7 m in length) 
embedded in concrete bases (Fig. 15.3). In the 
particular case of low-height cultivars, 3–4 m 
high typical vegetable and ornamental green￾houses, with a similar structure to the so-called 
Canary Islands type are also used. The 
greenhouse cover and side walls is either 
200 μm polyethylene film sandwiched be￾tween a double-weave wire network or anti￾insect mesh (usually 6 × 9 mm, 8 × 10 mm 
or 10 × 16 mm) in the warmer areas of the 
islands. While the structure itself can last 
two decades or more, the weak point of a 
greenhouse is the need for cover replacement

due to storm damage or, more importantly, 
ageing. However, the use of more durable new 
netting cover materials than those previously 
used in the Canary Islands, may prolong 
cover replacement for more than 10 years 
(Cabrera Cabrera and Galán Saúco, 2003). In 
general, long-life polyethylenes are prefer￾able to mesh/net covers for papaya, as fruit 
TSS increases with increased heat. Lateral 
ventilation is needed in the summer as tem￾peratures approach 35°C to avoid the tendency 
of hermaphrodite cultivars to develop male, 
non-functional flowers, usually associated 
with high temperatures.
Two types of greenhouses are used in 
Almería (Hueso et al., 2019):
• low technology parral-type greenhouses 
that are 3.5–4 m high with plastic covers 
which are partially removed in summer 
to avoid excessive heating, and natural 
lateral ventilation; and
• multi-span greenhouses that are 7 m high 
and covered with mesh and plastic. They 
have rolling windows with a nebulization 
system and automatic roof and lateral 
ventilation.
The Israelis use 50 mesh net on their 4-m 
high greenhouses and above this mesh have 
a polyethylene plastic cover, while in Japan 
pipe-framed greenhouses of 3–6 m high are 
covered with flexible plastic films made of 
polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene. Plastic 
greenhouses in Japan are heated in winter 
keeping the temperature above 23°C in 
order to avoid damage by frost and low tem￾peratures and to keep the fruit on the tree 
until maturation and maintain good fruit 
quality (Yonemoto, 2011).
15.4 Cultivars
Cultivars planted in the Canary Islands are 
continuously changing and new cultivars 
are being introduced because there is still 
not a cultivar identified with the optimum

conditions of high productivity, plant size, 
fruit weight and with a high TSS content for 
round-the-year production.
The cultivars grown include:
• pure lines of type ‘Solo’: ‘Sunrise’, ‘BH-65’;
• pure lines of type ‘Formosa’: ‘Maradol’, 
‘Mulata’, ‘Red Royal’, ‘Vega’;
• hybrids of type ‘Solo’: ‘Siluet’, ‘Eksotika 
I’; and
• hybrids of type ‘Formosa’: ‘Red Lady’,
‘Tainung 1’, ‘Intenzza’, ‘Sensation’, ‘Poco￾cí’ (also locally named as ‘Sweet Mary’).
Although dwarf cultivars such as ‘BH-65’ 
(Fig. 15.4) or semi-dwarf cultivars are pref￾fered, particularly for low parral-type green￾houses (3–4 m high that were previously 
cultivated with vegetables), ‘Intenzza’, ‘Sweet 
Mary’ (Fig. 15.5), ‘Maradol’ and ‘Mulata’ are the 
cultivars that have been chosen for recent 
plantings. ‘Intenzza’ is also the cultivar most 
planted in Almería followed by ‘BH-65’ (Salinas 
et al., 2017).
‘Sunrise Solo’, ‘Tainung 2’, ‘Tainung 5’ 
and the female dwarf ‘Wonder Bright’ are 
common cultivars grown in Japan, but new 
cultivars bred by the Japan International 
Research Center for Agricultural Sciences 
(JIRCAS) like the dwarf, female partheno￾carpic ‘Ishigaki Sango’ and also ‘Ishigaki 
Wonderus’ (produces large fruit weighing 
1.8 kg) are also planted (Yonemoto, 2011).
Female plants are prevalent in Israel, 
where the local selection ‘Paradise’ from the 
Volcani breeding programme and a patented 
privately selected cultivar named ‘Aurora’ are 
the cultivars planted. Both are vegetatively 
propagated through cuttings and tissue culture.
15.5 Cultivation Techniques
Cultural practices for greenhouse papayas 
do not in general differ much from those 
used for open-air cultivation, where plants

can be grown without protection. Although 
there is no local production of certified 
seeds in the Canary Islands, practically all 
planting materials come from true-to-type 
seeds obtained through self-pollination im￾ported from other countries, with only one 
nursery on the island of Tenerife producing 
grafted plants (Galán Saúco, 2014). Rooted 
cuttings or tissue-culture plants are cur￾rently used in Israel and both seed and tis￾sue-culture plants are planted in Japan. In 
all cases, nursery propagation is done in 
structures isolated from PRSV host plants 
and vectors. Planting density in the Canary 
Islands depends on cultivars, 2222 plants 
ha-1 (3 m × 1.5 m) in the case of dwarf or 
medium-high cultivars and 1667 plants ha-1
(3 m × 2 m) for medium-high hybrid culti￾vars (Galán Saúco, 2014), usually placed in 
a triangular planting for better capture of 
light. Greater planting distances (4 m × 1 m) 
are used in mechanized plantations to allow 
better illumination, facilitate pest control 
and enable harvesting. Traditionally three 
to four plants, spaced 40–50 cm between 
them, are placed at each planting site and 
later thinned at the first flowering, leaving 
one hermaphrodite seedling per hole. If 
there were several hermaphrodite plants 
per site, the most compact and vigorous 
plant having the flowers at the lower height 
is chosen. The rest are eliminated by cutting 
with a knife at soil level. Most new plant￾ations have adopted the recently developed 
technique of early sex determination using 
molecular markers (Salinas et al., 2018) that 
allows direct planting of one hermaphrodite 
plant per planting hole, with the conse￾quent reduction of costs and labour. Also 
this has the additional advantage of avoid￾ing competition for light between plants in 
the same hole, resulting in a more compact 
plant with shorter internodes that can pro￾duce flowers and fruits at a lower height. 
The best time for planting in Canary Island 
greenhouses is in spring, obtaining the 
first fruits 7–9 months after field planting, 
the moment at which the plants have an 
Fig. 15.5. Papaya cultivar ‘Sweet Mary’.

average of 90–100 fruits that are harvested in 
the next 8–10 months. The interval between 
flower anthesis and harvesting varies through￾out the year from 5 to 10 months depending 
on the season, the location, the cultivar and 
the type of greenhouse. The higher contents 
of soluble solids in fruits are obtained in 
August–September, slowing down but still 
at an acceptable level until the end of Feb￾ruary. The fruits from flowers that appear in 
October–November are not harvested until 
May–June and have a lower content of TSS. 
Harvest peak occurs between December and 
April corresponding with the flowers that 
were produced during the previous summer; 
with the lower production of fruits occuring 
in September–October obtained from flowers 
that appeared during winter–spring.
Papayas are very sensitive to chemical 
herbicides and manual elimination of weeds 
is usually done in commercial plantings in 
the Canary Islands. Weed control is also 
achieved by frequent use of mulching using 
vegetable residues or, better, black polythyl￾ene or agrotextile nets that also contribute to 
the increase in soil temperature during the 
winter. An usual labour in the production of 
papayas in the Canary Islands is the removal 
by hand of the undesired shoots that appear 
at the axils of the basal leaves, which if left 
on the plant will grow, flower and produce 
small fruits of no commercial value. This 
practice is not done until the definitive 
hermaphrodite plant has been selected, be￾cause otherwise it can encourage vegetative 
growth of the plant and delay flowering. Plants 
which have been already sexed can be 
planted directly in the field, with between 
eight and ten or even fewer adult leaves. 
Plants can also be supplied by nurseries and 
these plants are bigger in size and may even 
have the first flowers already visible but 
such plants may also require elimination of 
the undesired shoot when it is produced or 
present.
The old basal leaves of the adult plant 
that are usually senescent and dry, or those 
affected by pests or diseases, are also removed. 
Removal of leaves is done by hand, elimin￾ating the leaf lamina and leaving the peduncle 
attached to the plant. The peduncle will drop 
off by itself later. No knifes or secateurs are 
used for the removal of basal shoots or leaves 
to avoid any possibility of the spread of 
pests and diseases.
Crop coefficients used for irrigation of 
papayas in the Canary Islands vary between 
0.5 and 0.6 during the early vegetative phase 
and 0.8 and 1.2 during the rest of the plant’s 
life. Depending on the location, 6000–9000 
m3
 ha-1 are utilized during the first year and 
9000–12,000 m3
 ha-1 for a cycle of 18 
months. Drip irrigation is usually employed 
in Canary Island greenhouses with two drip 
lines per row (Fig. 15.3) and 4 l h-1 emitters 
each spaced 0.4–0.6 m apart with the irriga￾tion frequency varying between one or two 
to seven applications a week, depending on 
the season. Soil and foliar analyses are usu￾ally run to determine fertilizer needs but, in 
its absence, general fertilizer recommenda￾tions for Canary Island papayas in order to 
obtain a yield of 180 t from a density of 
1700 plants ha-1 in an 18-month cycle are: 
400 kg N, 216 kg P2
O5
, 730 kg K2
O and 240 kg 
of CaO per year. The incorporation of 2–5 kg 
of animal manure to the soil before planting 
is also recommended. Where soil analysis 
reveals a high content of nitrogen, as in the 
case of previous cultivation of vegetables on 
the same plots, some growers reduce or sup￾press the incorporation of this element dur￾ing the months prior to the first flowering, to 
avoid excessive vegetative growth that can 
make the plant initiate flowering at a higher 
node than desired. Other elements such as 
Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and B can also be applied by 
foliar sprays. In order to facilitate better 
nutrient absorption, the water should be 
between pH 6.0 and pH 6.5. To avoid salin￾ity damage, it is recommended to keep the 
nutrient solution below 1.6 dSm-1.
Deflowering (Figs 15.6 and 15.7) is also 
practised regularly in greenhouse cultiva￾tion of papaya on the Canary Islands. This is 
a cultural practice of great importance in 
order to obtain production of good quality 
fruits. It consists of the identification and 
removal of sterile flowers and the commonly 
occurring carpelloid and pentandry abnor￾mal flowers within the inflorescences ap￾pearing at the leaf axils, leaving only the 
normal elongata hermaphrodite flowers (Galán 
Saúco et al., 2014). On many occasions the

main central flower is abnormal and should 
be destroyed to allow the development of the 
secondary lateral flowers, when those look 
normal because otherwise these will be in￾hibited by the deformed apical flower. The 
same is done (Fig. 15.6) when the known 
phenomenon of female sterility occurs and 
all the flowers at one particular leaf axil are 
abnormal or carpelloids: they should be re￾moved leaving one or more internodes 
empty. This early elimination of all the flowers 
at the particular leaf axil avoids unneces￾sary depletion of plant reserves.
Fruit thinning leaving one to two fruits 
at each leaf axil, depending on the culti￾var, is also a common cultural practice in 
the Canary Islands. This is done at the 
early stages of fruit development in order 
to avoid compaction of the fruits (Fig. 15.8). 
It leads to fruits of better external appear￾ance and also reduces pest problems be￾cause of improved aeration. Through 
careful thinning it is also possible to regu￾late the size of the fruits facilitating the 
harvesting.
Plantings in Japan, under drip irrigation, 
are spaced at 1.5 m × 1.5 m, while in Israel 
it varies from 1.5 m to 2.0 m between trees 
within rows, with 2.0–3.0 m between rows. 
Planting in spring is recommended in Al￾mería with plant densities similar to those 
in the Canary Islands. Planting in twin lines 
is usually done to make better use of the 
height differences inside the greenhouse 
and to best capture the radiation during 
winter. Water consumption of papaya in 
Almería is about 6000 m3
 ha-1 in the first 
year; double this quantity is required in the 
second year after planting. Water is applied 
at full production in quantities of 2.4 l m-2, 
with a frequency of between two and 14 
irrigations per week (0.7 l m-2 day-1 and 4.8 l 
m-2 day-1, respectively) depending on the 
season. Nutrients consisting of 160–250 kg 
ha-1 of N, 100–120 kg ha-1 of P2
O5
 and 230–
360 kg ha-1 of K2
O are incorporated through 
the drip system throughout the 21–24 
month cycle. It is also recommended that 
prior to planting, organic material is incorp￾orated into the soil in the form of about 5 kg 
ha-1 of animal manure or compost (Hueso 
et al., 2017b).
Using drip irrigation Japanese growers 
apply between 15 l day-1 and 20 l day-1 per

plant, with larger quantities of water and 
fertilizer in summer than in the winter 
(Yonemoto, 2011). Usual dosages in Israel are 
between 40 m3
 ha-1 and 50 m3
 ha-1, irrigating 
once a day in summer and every 2 days in the 
winter, and fertigating with 5-3-8 N-P-K 
(N dosage about 25 ppm). Hand pollination 
is a common practice in Israel, but is not 
necessary in the Canaries where fruit set is 
good all year around. In plastic houses in Japan, 
seedlings are planted at a 45° angle to the 
ground, and grown horizontally by tying the 
stem to maintain a low height of the fruiting 
position in the plastic house as long as pos￾sible. A similar practice was also done before 
in the Canaries, particularly when papaya 
was planted in greenhouses of around 3 m 
height that had previously been cultivated 
with vegetables or flowers. However, now 
either dwarf cultivars or 6-m high greenhouses 
are preferred for new plantings. Hydroponic, 
soilless cultivation of papayas in pots (actu￾ally under patent) have been developed on 
the Ishigaki Island of Japan enabling stable 
production of high-quality fruit for a long 
time under plastic (H. Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture 
University, 2019, personal communication). 
The Israeli growers used to cut back the plants 
when they reached the greenhouse ceiling, 
then they would choose one or two branches 
that would be allowed to grow, where very 
quickly, flowers and fruits would be produced 
again. In this way they could grow the same 
plants for longer, delaying the need for 
replanting.
15.6 Pests and Diseases
Mites and powdery mildew are the most 
relevant pests and diseases of greenhouse￾grown papayas in the Canary Islands but 
others, like the banana moth (Opogona sac￾chari Bojer), scales, nematodes, anthacnose 
and Phytophthora, are also present in papaya 
greenhouses. All can be controlled with 
different products, both conventional and 
organic, with the exception of the banana 
moth, which usually requires the applica￾tion of synthetic insecticides and spraying 
with Bacillus thuringiensis. Mites are also 
common pests in Israel as well as Japan, where 
anthracnose, powdery mildew and nematodes 
are the main pests and diseases (Yonemoto, 
2011). Few pests and diseases have been de￾tected in the south-east of Spain, the most 
common being red mites that are success￾fully controlled by natural enemies released 
in the greenhouse and by climate manage￾ment (Hueso et al., 2017b), making organic 
cultivation a good option for this area. This 
is also an interesting option for the Canary 
Islands.

15.7 Conclusion and Future Prospects
Cultivation of papaya under greenhouse 
conditions is technically feasible as growth, 
flowering and fruits benefit from the climatic 
modifications achievable in a greenhouse. 
Besides improved yields, both in quantity 
and in quality, and reduced water consump￾tion, there may also be additional benefits 
derived from virus exclusion, which, when 
considered altogether, may make greenhouse 
production a profitable system of cultivation 
in several subtropical areas in the world. 
More precisely, greenhouse cultivation, 
provided that the structure can be properly 
closed, can avoid the incidence of PRSV. 
As indicated before, this is only possible 
in open-field cultivation through the use of 
transgenic cultivars, which are prohibited 
or strongly rejected in many markets of the 
world, particularly in the EU. This, together 
with the higher yields of about 120 t ha-1
year-1 obtained in recent years (Galán Saúco, 
2014), explains the rapid growth of greenhouse 
production experienced in the Canary Islands, 
from around 150 ha grown in 2007 (Galán 
Saúco and Rodriguez Pastor, 2007) to the 
300 ha grown today. This is also the case in 
Almería, where the EU has recently approved 
a project named Europapaya (Development 
and improvement of a model for the inten￾sive cultivation of papayas in greenhouses 
in the south east of Spain). This project has 
been financed by the EU Program FEDER￾Interconecta 2016, which has among its ob￾jectives the design of a greenhouse structure 
and climate control specifically for the pro￾duction of papaya, its vegetative propaga￾tion through grafting or tissue culture, and 
the development and application of the 
most appropriate cultural techniques for 
production and postharvest of papaya in 
that geographical region (Hueso et al., 2017a; 
Anonymous, 2017). Taking into account the 
proximity of Spain to the European market, 
the outcome of a project like this may bring an 
important increase of planting in the future.

16.1 Introduction
Papaya is cultivated throughout the tropics 
for its tasty and healthy fruit. Generally, 
it takes about 8–9 months from seed ger￾mination to fruit harvesting. Once this large 
herb begins flowering, the plant has fruit at 
every stage of development and mature fruit 
are harvested at regular, often weekly intervals, 
throughout the year (Paull and Duarte, 2011). 
The fruit are eaten green or ripe, fresh or in 
salads (Sivakumar and Wall, 2013; Chareek￾hot et al., 2014). They are also used for mak￾ing juice, jam, crystallized fruit, canned and 
dried fruit. The mature fruit are also cooked 
before eating. The fruit is also popular with 
dieters since it is low in fat (0.1%), carbohy￾drate (7–13%) and calories (35–59 Kcal/100g) 
(Rohani, 1994). The young leaves and male 
flowers are also consumed and the trunk 
is used to make compost in some producer 
countries. Both the papaya plant and the 
green fruit produce significant amounts of 
latex that is isolated in lactifers. The latex 
contains the protease papain that is used in 
the food industry as a meat tenderizer and to 
clarify beer (Oliveira and Vitoria, 2011), and in 
the pharmaceutical and medical industries. 
The papaya plant and ripe fruit have been 
traditionally used to cure various ailments.
Fruit development from pollination 
to ripeness takes 168–182 days in Hawaii, 
with an extra 2 weeks delay during the cool 
season (Nakasone, 1986). The variation ranges 
from 173 days from fruit set to ripeness when 
grown under 30°C day/20°C night to 282 
days at 24°C day/12°C night (Kuhne and Allan, 
1970; Allan et al., 1987). Papaya fruit are not 
harvested until the skin shows some yellow￾ing (‘colour break’) as an indicator of matur￾ity and the beginning of ripening (Akamine 
and Goo, 1971). Less mature fruit ripen poor￾ly with lower total soluble solids (TSS) and 
should be culled before packing. Ripening 
rate also varies with cultivar (Zhang and Paull, 
1990) with a range of 7–16 days from the 
colour-break (CB) stage (Fig. 16.1). The rate 
of softening differs between cultivars with 
respect to the rate of respiration, ethylene 
production, skin degreening and flesh col￾our development (Zhang and Paull, 1990).
16.2 Harvesting and Handling
Fruit destined for green salads and other dishes 
are harvested when still green and mature, 
while fruit aimed for fresh consumption are 
harvested at or after the CB stage. Harvesting 
is carried out by hand with the harvester

selecting the desired fruit and accumulating 
the fruit in a cloth bag, bin or bucket. Care is 
need as the skin is very susceptible to abra￾sion injury at this stage (Fig. 16.1A). Abrasion 
injury is not very obvious on CB fruit and 
becomes apparent during ripening. As the 
plant grows and the fruit cannot be har￾vested easily from the ground so harvest aids 
(poles, ladders, etc.) are used, the time taken 
to harvest an area almost doubles. If moving 
mechanical platforms are used to harvest 
fruit from tall plants, the time taken to harvest 
an area is about 25% longer than harvesting 
from the ground.

yellowing (Akamine and Goo, 1971; Siva￾kumar and Wall, 2013; Barragán-Iglesias 
et al., 2018) referred to as the CB stage. Fruit of 
the ‘Solo’ group should have started to ripen 
before harvest as indicated by some skin 
yellowing at the base of the fruit to meet the 
11.5% TSS grade requirement (Akamine and 
Goo, 1971). Less mature fruit ripen poorly 
with lower TSS and poor flavour, and there￾fore need to be culled before packing. If fruit 
are harvested after the CB stage, TSS will 
continue to increase with sugars imported 
from subtending leaf photosynthetate, as the 
fruit mesocarp does not contain starch that 
can be converted during ripening to sugars. 
The degree of skin yellowing is thus the main 
criterion used in the field to select fruit for 
harvest with TSS being used in some regions 
to meet a grade requirement after harvest.
Maturity at harvest is limited by fruit 
fly egg lay that occurs in fruit with more 
than 25% skin colour (Seo et al., 1982; Dong 
et al., 2011). In addition, riper fruit are more 
prone to impact and compression bruising 
(Quintana and Paull, 1993; Martins and For￾nazier, 2015) (Fig. 16.1).
Efforts have been made to objectively 
measure fruit maturity with non-destructive, 
physical measures (Reyes et al., 1996; Bar￾ragán-Iglesias et al., 2018). Delayed light emis￾sion intensity (Forbus et al., 1987; Forbus and 
Chan, 1989), body transmission spectroscopy 
at three wavelengths (Birth et al., 1984) and 
reflectance measurement (Hunter ‘b’ value) 
(Couey and Hayes, 1986) have been evalu￾ated. The change of exuding latex colour from 
white to colourless has also been suggested as 
a measure of suitability in harvesting (Traub 
et al., 1935). Large variation in papaya fruit 
acoustic properties (e.g. speed and absorption 
of sound) at the same stage of ripeness pre￾cludes its use for sorting (Hayes and Chingon, 
1982). We are currently evaluating reflected 
infra-red light to non-destructively determine 
fruit TSS with some success.
16.2.2 Grading
The main visual quality characteristics of 
papaya are size, colour, shape, smooth skin, 
gloss and the absence of blemishes. The skin 
colour changes from green to yellow with 
some orange and red depending on the var￾iety, environmental conditions and cultural 
practices (Oliveira and Vitoria, 2011). The 
external skin colour changes start at the blos￾som end often with streaks of yellow up the 
sides of the fruit. Internal flesh colouring 
and softening starts from the endocarp and 
progresses outwards. However, external col￾our changes do not always track the internal 
stage of colour development, with environ￾mental conditions playing a crucial role. In 
Hawaii, the skin of fruit harvested in the cool 
season will be greener than similar fruit har￾vested in the warm season with regard to 
the degree of flesh coloration. In addition, 
‘Maradol’ papaya ripened on the tree has a red￾orange skin but is typically yellow-orange 
when the fruit is harvested green-mature 
and allowed to ripen detached from the tree 
(Fuggate et al., 2010). Difficulties in grading 
accurately by skin colour often leads to 
packed cartons showing a range of skin col￾our (chequerboard pattern) as they ripen.
The sweetness of the pulp is the most 
important sensory quality appreciated by 
consumers besides colour (Sivakumar and 
Wall, 2013). A minimum grade value of 11.5% 
TSS is used in Hawaii (Anon., 1990). The 
11.5% TSS standard is based upon con￾sumer taste panel studies that showed this 
was a break point between a fruit being 
regarded as not sweet and sweet. A further 
increase of 1.5–2% TSS occurs in fruit har￾vested at the CB stage and allowed to ripen 
off the tree (Akamine and Goo, 1971), due 
possibly to solubilization of cell wall com￾ponents (Gómez et al., 2002). Consumers in 
Western countries also tend to prefer fruit 
without the musky sweaty odour often found 
in some South-east Asian cultivars.
Another important sensorial quality in 
papaya fruit is the flesh colour. Immature 
flesh is greenish-white and changes when ripe 
to pale orange-yellow, salmon pink, or red 
depending upon the cultivar. The flesh col￾our is due to accumulation of carotenoids and 
varies with cultivar and growing conditions 
(Wall, 2006). Carotenoids are sought by con￾sumers because of the perceived health 
benefits associated with their antioxidant

capacity (Stahl and Sies, 2003; Mélo et al., 
2006; Wall, 2006; Rao and Rao, 2007).
16.2.3 Packing
The most common package size for ‘Solo’ 
papaya is a 4.5 kg (10 lb) carton, although 
larger, 10 kg (22 lb), cartons are also used. 
Cartons from areas requiring insect disin￾festation are fully sealed to meet regulatory 
requirements, while fruit from other areas 
can be in open-topped cartons. Count size 
ranges from six to 18, depending upon fruit 
and carton size. Fruit are marketed as ‘col￾our break’ and ¼, ½ and ¾ ripe. Fruit is nor￾mally ready to eat when there is 75% or more 
skin colour depending upon variety. Foam 
mesh sleeves, foam padding on the bottom 
of cartons, or paper wrapping prevent abra￾sion injury, which is a major problem in 
fruit still having green areas of skin (Quin￾tana and Paull, 1993; Sivakumar and Wall, 
2013) (Fig. 16.1A).
16.2.4 Water loss, coatings and wraps
Loss of ~8% of initial weight from mature￾green papaya produces fruit with a low gloss 
and a wrinkled appearance with a ‘rubbery’ 
texture (Paull and Chen, 1989) (Fig. 16.1B). 
The rate of weight loss from ripening pa￾paya is about 0.1% initial weight day-1 mbar-1. 
The highest rate of weight loss occurs via 
the stem scar (nearly 3500 mg cm-2 day-1) 
while 4.4 mg cm-2 day-1 is lost through the 
skin. The major mode of weight loss is 
the skin because of its larger surface area. The 
stomata do not appear to function in ripen￾ing fruit. The skin’s resistance to water move￾ment increases at the start of ripening, then 
declines with no apparent change in the 
rate of total water loss. Part of the decline in 
resistance is associated with the disruption 
of the cuticle by exuded latex, especially 
after the 50% ripe stage, leading to a signifi￾cant weight loss late in ripening. The loss of 
water is the major component of weight 
loss. Therefore, maintenance of high relative 
humidity (RH) (>90%) has been reported 
to reduce weight loss (Singh and Rao, 2011).
Fruit coatings (waxes) reduce weight loss 
by 14–40% depending upon the coating 
composition, while plastic shrink wraps 
reduce loss by ~90%. Some coatings and 
plastic wraps can delay ripening by 1–2 days 
at ambient temperatures, after storage for up 
to 2 weeks at 10°C. Occasionally, off-flavours 
do occur in coated and wrapped fruit when 
the fruit cavity CO2
 level exceeded ~7% at 
the full-ripe stage. Plastic film (both shrink 
wraps and coatings) have the advantage in 
limiting weight loss, adding gloss in the case 
of coating and avoiding skin wrinkling (Paull 
and Chen, 1989; Ding and Muhammad, 2013). 
Coatings, when carefully selected, do gener￾ate a modified atmosphere in the fruit and 
give a few days extension to postharvest life. 
Considerable effort is being made to add 
essential oils to these edible coatings to in￾crease postharvest disease control (Ali et al., 
2000; Barrera-Necha, et al., 2008; Guédez 
et al., 2014; Sarkhosh et al., 2018).
Chitosan has been shown to be one of 
the best edible and biologically safe coat￾ings for fruit because of its film-forming 
properties, antimicrobial actions, lack of 
toxicity, biodegradability and biochemical 
properties (Bonilla et al., 2012; Arnon et al., 
2014). A 4–7 days extension in papaya’s 
postharvest life is obtained using 150 kDa 
chitosan solutions on fruit stored at room 
temperature (18–24°C, 60–80% RH). Chi￾tosan coating is effective in reducing weight 
loss, maintaining firmness and delaying 
changes in the peel colour and TSS during 5 
weeks of storage of ‘Eksotika II’ fruit at 8°C 
(Ali et al., 2000). Less success has been re￾ported for vegetable oil, though when mixed 
with carboxymethylcellulose and carra￾geenan, ripening is delayed (Mercado-Ruiz 
et al., 2014; Vyas et al., 2014).
16.2.5 Ethylene sensitivity
Ethylene production rates in ripening fruit 
are low compared with many other fruit and 
range from 6 μl kg-1 h-1 to 10 μl kg-1 h-1 (Paull 
and Chen, 1983; Paull, 1993). Ethylene-treated 
papayas ripen faster and more uniformly 
in terms of skin degreening, softening and 
flesh colour (An and Paull, 1990).

16.3 Storage and Shipping
16.3.1 Storage temperatures
Storage recommendations are made in the 
range from 7°C to 13°C and 90–95% RH. 
Commercially, fruit are most often shipped 
at 7–8°C as long as the storage duration does 
not exceed 21 days (Fig. 16.2), while research 
results using different criteria as to marketable 
life recommend 12–13°C. At 7–10°C, storage 
life is limited by chilling injury (Fig. 16.1C), 
while at 10–13°C the fruit ripens slowly and 
ripeness limits storage life (Chen and Paull, 
1986; Sivakumar and Wall, 2013). At 7°C, 
storage decay also is less than at 12°C or 13°C 
(Arisumi, 1956; El-Tomi et al., 1974). Pa￾paya fruit at the CB stage stored at 7°C for 
14 days ripen normally in 8–12 days when 
transferred to room temperature (Thomp￾son and Lee, 1971; Chen and Paull, 1986; 
Sivakumar and Wall, 2013). Holding the 
fruit in the chilling range (7°C) delays ripen￾ing during shipping and marketing provides 
less opportunity for handling soft ripe fruit. 
Ripe full-coloured fruit can be held for more 
than a week at 1–3°C though the fruit will 
show gloss loss and wrinkling due to water 
loss, and have a greater susceptibility to 
compression and impact injury. Retail dis￾play temperatures should not be less than 
10°C, if not fully ripe.
16.3.2 Ripening temperatures
The optimum temperature for fruit ripening 
is between 22.5°C and 27.5°C, with fruit 
taking 10–18 days to reach full skin yellow￾ing from the CB stage (An and Paull, 1990). 
Severe weight loss and external abnormal￾ities become significant at temperatures 
higher than 27.5°C.
16.3.3 Ethylene, 1-methylcyclopropene 
(1-MCP) and volatiles on fruit ripening
Ethylene-treated papayas ripened faster 
and more uniformly as a cohort in terms of 
skin degreening, softening and flesh colour 
(Akamine, 1977; Nazeeb and Broughton, 
1978; An and Paull, 1990). Since papaya 
ripen from the inside outwards, the effect of 
ethylene treatment is to accelerate the rate 
of ripening of the mesocarp tissue nearer the 
skin that has not started to soften. Ethylene 
does not ripen immature papayas completely 
in terms of skin and flesh colour development. 
The outer portion of the flesh of ethylene￾treated fruit had a faster rate of ripening, as 
indicated by carotenoid development and 
softening rate, while the same area of the flesh 
is still pale white in non-ethylene-treated fruit. 
Ethylene is not recommended commercially 
as the rapid softening severely limits available 
marketing time (An and Paull, 1990).
The addition of ethylene-absorbent 
sachets containing the oxidizer potassium 
permanganate to the packed carton has been 
shown to delay papaya ripening when sealed 
in a plastic bag (Bastos et al., 2014) and can 
reduce the ethylene content by half (Corrêa 
et al., 2005). However, it is unclear whether 
the modified atmosphere created by hold￾ing the fruit in a plastic bag interacted with 
the presence of the ethylene oxidizer. Pho￾todegradation of ethylene in the storage room 
using ultraviolet light may be a more effect￾ive approach (Lourenço et al., 2017).
Fruit treated with various concentrations 
of ethylene receptor inhibitor 1-MCP for 24 h 
are firmer and the time to reach the edible ripe 
stage is longer than the non-treated control 
(Hofman et al., 2001; Ergun and Huber,

Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditions242 P. Muda et al.
2004; Manenoi et al., 2007). Treating fruit 
for 4 h or 24 h with 1-MCP has similar effects 
on all ripening parameters. Careful handling, 
hot water treatment and fungicide treatment 
are required to minimize postharvest disease 
and to determine the effect due to 1-MCP. 
Disease following 1-MCP treatment occurs 
later and has less severity than in the non￾treated control fruit. The onset of ethylene 
production and the rise in the respiration 
rate is delayed and suppressed in 1-MCP￾treated fruit. When ripened at 22°C, 1-MCP￾treated CB fruit is delayed about 7 days in 
softening and skin colour development but 
only has a slight effect on TSS and weight 
loss. However, papaya treated with 1-MCP 
at the CB stage are firmer and show a rub￾bery texture at the ripe stage. Fruit treated 
with 1-MCP when more than 25% of the 
skin is yellow, ripened and softened nor￾mally. Storage of 10% yellow fruit at 10°C 
for 7 days before or after 1-MCP treatment 
has no effect on the 1-MCP softening re￾sponse. 1-MCP treatment before or immedi￾ately after ethephon treatment also shows 
no difference in the softening pattern. Fruit 
treated with 1-MCP in a polyethylene-lined 
cardboard shipping carton have delayed 
ripening; without the liner the response is 
reduced. Modified atmosphere storage after 
1-MCP treatment further extended the delay 
in ripening. The conclusion is that papaya 
fruit treated with 1-MCP when more than 
25% ripe show a delay in softening that 
may have commercial utility. The applica￾tion of 1-MCP is not recommended for fruit 
less than 25% yellow as it often leads to a 
rubbery flesh texture when fully ripe 
(Manenoi et al., 2007; Ahmad et al., 2013).
A nitric oxide (NO) treatment (3 h, 60 
μl l-1, stored at 20°C) effectively suppresses 
ethylene production and respiration, reduces 
weight loss, maintains firmness and delays 
changes in peel colour and soluble solid 
contents of mature green fruit during 20 days 
of storage (Li et al., 2014). The delay in 
ripening following NO treatment is about 
2 days; it is unclear if longer or continuous 
exposure to NO will delay ripening further. 
The delay in ripening is associated with 
regulation of cell-wall-softening enzymes 
and interactions with other plant growth 
regulators (Guo et al., 2014). Methyl jasmo￾nate (MJ) vapours inhibited fungal decay 
and reduced chilling injury development 
and loss of firmness during papaya storage 
at 10°C and 4 days at 20°C (Gonzalez-Aquilar 
et al., 2003). The senior author has found 
that MJ treatment of CB fruit can disrupt 
fruit softening and lead to fruit with a rub￾bery texture when fully ripe similar to early 
treatments with 1-MCP. If MJ is applied when 
the fruit is more than 20% ripe, a delay is 
seen in ripening as reported by Gonzalez￾Aquilar et al. (2003).
16.3.4 Controlled atmosphere (CA) 
and modified atmosphere storage
Shelf-life extension of 1–1.5 days is obtained 
when papaya is stored at 12°C in 1–1.5% O2
for 6 days (Akamine and Goo, 1969). Low O2
(1.0–5%) with or without high CO2
 (2–10%) 
reduces decay (Hatton and Reeder, 1969) 
and delays ripening (Akamine 1959; Chen 
and Paull, 1986). Quite high CO2 (30%) 
adversely affected internal colour, aroma 
and flavour while there is no residual effect 
of 10% CO2
 on decay control, though skin 
degreening is delayed. At 10°C, fruit can be 
stored for 36 days in 8% CO2
 and 3% O2
 and 
still have ~5 days at 25°C for retailing (Cen￾ci et al., 1997). Ethylene removal prior to 
storage has shown variable results (Nazeeb 
and Broughton, 1978). Fruit stored at 10°C, 
98% RH and low pressure of 20 mm Hg, 
ripened more slowly than fruit from normal 
pressure. Low pressure storage appears to 
suppress disease development (Alvarez, 1980; 
Chau and Alvarez, 1983). Off-odours do occur 
when fruit are subject to very low O2
 levels 
of less than 2% or a CO2
 level higher than 
8% (Yahia et al., 1992; Sandhya, 2010). This 
off-odour dissipates when the fruit is returned 
to ambient conditions.
The CA recommendations are in the 
range 2–5% O2
 plus 3–8% CO2
 at 10–13°C 
(Yahia, 1998). Subsequent research has not 
led to changes in these recommendations. 
No large-scale commercial use has so far been 
reported possibly because of the increase in 
costs and the lack of a clear cost–benefit

advantage. Another major issue is that fruit 
are harvested throughout the year and 
though the supply may vary from week to 
week, application of CA during marketing 
with its added cost may not be warranted. 
New CA technologies (Chaix et al., 2014; 
Jochum et al., 2016) that are integrated into 
refrigerated shipping containers will require 
continued re-evaluation of the costs and 
benefits of CA for papaya (Rodrigue and 
Notteboom, 2013).
The optimum CA (O2
:CO2
) gas require￾ment may differ at different stages of ripen￾ing and thus the newer atmosphere control 
systems could meet these different needs 
during shipping as the fruit ripens. The 
O2:CO2
 ratio requirements could adapt to 
the decrease in the coefficient of gas diffu￾sion throughout papaya fruit ripening thus 
avoiding low and high concentrations of O2
and CO2
 (Pereira et al., 2009). The small quan￾tities of papaya moving in international 
trade and year-round availability of papaya 
may not warrant a cost–benefit analysis of 
use of this CA technology.
Extension of storage life to 4 weeks has 
been reported for fruit shipped wrapped in 
low-density polyethylene (0.04 mm) with 
the gas concentration changing in 24 h to 
4–5% CO2
 and 2–3% O2
 at 10–12°C (Rohani 
and Zaipun, 2007). Singh and Rao (2005) re￾ported that a similar modified atmosphere 
treatment at 13°C for 30 days alleviates 
chilling injury symptom development and 
fruit had greater retention of ascorbic acid. 
Simple evaporative cooling coupled with 
fruit being held in plastic bags also extends 
postharvest storage life (Azene et al., 2014).
16.3.5 Postharvest quality losses
The three major causes of postharvest losses 
are: (i) mechanical injury (Fig. 16.1A); (ii) 
poor storage environment (dehydration and 
chilling injury) (Fig. 16.1B, C); and (iii) dis￾ease (Paull et al., 1997; Bautista-Baños 
et al., 2013; Sivakumar and Wall, 2013). CB 
fruit are very susceptible to abrasion dam￾age when still partly green (Fig. 16.1A) that 
leads to greenish sunken areas on ripe fruit 
(Quintana and Paull, 1993; Li and Thomas, 
2014; de Godoy-Beltrame et al., 2015) with 
fruit fly damage being a problem as the fruit 
begins to ripen (Bautista-Baños et al., 2013). 
Abrasion damages the cuticle, increases the 
rate of water loss and provides a site for 
disease development. As the fruit ripen fur￾ther from the CB stage, they become softer 
and more likely to suffer compression or 
impact injury (Quintana and Paull, 1993) 
(Fig. 16.1A).
Preharvest infections often lead to post￾harvest diseases and are associated with 
poor field management practices. The main 
pathological disorders in papaya are an￾thracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides), 
black stem-end rot (Phoma caricae-papayae), 
Phomopsis rot (Phomopsis caricae-papayae), 
Phytophthora stem-end rot (Phytophthora 
nicotianae var. parasitica) and Alternaria rot 
(Alternaria alternata) (Sommer et al., 2011). 
The latent infection, anthracnose, is a major 
cause of postharvest losses. Some diseases 
such as black stem-end rot and Phomopsis 
rot frequently start at the broken peduncle 
and are often associated with organisms 
that are opportunistic saprophytes. Others 
such as Alternaria rot are most frequent 
after storing the fruit at temperatures below 
12°C. Most of the diseases develop rapidly 
when the fruit is more than 25% ripe (Bau￾tista-Baños et al., 2013). Mechanical injury 
and chilling injury can enhance the devel￾opment of postharvest diseases (Somner 
and Mitchell, 1978; Alvarez and Nishijima, 
1987; Nishijima et al., 1990; Bautista-Baños 
et al., 2013; Sivakumar and Wall, 2013).
16.4 Postharvest Handling 
and Storage-related Disorders
Papaya shipments arriving at terminal mar￾kets have a range of disorders associated with 
mechanical injury, over-ripeness and para￾sitic diseases (Cappellini et al., 1988). Other 
disorders seen in market channels are due 
to preharvest factors (Oliveira et al., 2019).

and storage disorders (i.e. chilling injury)

incidence has not been fully determined 
(Somner and Mitchell, 1978; Alvarez and 
Nishijima, 1987; Nishijima et al., 1990; Paull 
et al., 1997).
16.4.1 Mechanical injury
Mechanical injury due to abrasion while the 
fruit skin is green, and impact and compres￾sion injury as the fruit ripens and softens 
are a postharvest problem for papayas sent 
from Hawaii to the US mainland (Paull et al., 
1997; Oliveira and Vitoria 2011).
Ripe papaya fruit in the markets frequently 
show sunken skin areas that fail to degreen. 
These unsightly fruit blemishes are of con￾cern to shippers and are referred to as ‘green 
islands’. This skin injury is associated with 
broken cuticle (Fig. 16.1A), however, its oc￾currence is not aggravated by the presence 
of latex seeping from the wound. Fruit at 
the CB stage (10–15% yellow) when dropped 
on to 200 mesh sandpaper from a height of 
5 cm show skin injury symptoms similar to 
the ‘green islands’ seen at the retail level. 
During handling, this abrasion injury is caused 
by the sides of wooden or plywood bins, 
dirty buckets and harvest bags used during 
harvest and fruit accumulation.
Abrasion and puncture injury are more 
important than impact injury for CB papaya 
fruit (Quintana and Paull, 1993; de Godoy￾Beltrame et al., 2015). Heating fruit at 48°C 
for >6 h or until the fruit core temperature 
reached 47.5°C aggravated the severity of 
this skin abrasion injury. Delays in the ap￾plication of heat treatment after dropping 
did not reduce the severity of skin injury, 
except for fruit heated 24 h after dropping. 
Waxing fruit does alleviate the severity of 
skin injury, whether applied before or after 
the heat treatment, implying a role of water 
loss at the damaged cuticle.
Fruit with 40% or more colour are very 
susceptible to impact and compression in￾jury with the kinetic energy causing meso￾carp cell rupture (flesh translucency) under 
the skin at the point of impact or compres￾sion (Fig. 16.1A). This damage is frequently 
seen in regional markets in Brazil, Mexico, 
South-east Asia and India. During posthar￾vest handling this occurs when fruit are 
held in deep pallet bins, packed cartons are 
crushed on pallets and individual fruit and 
packed cartons are thrown or mishandled. 
Softening makes the handling of fruit after 
the 50% yellow stage difficult as they are very 
prone to compression and impact injury 
(Fig. 16.1A) when handled in bulk bins or 
deep buckets.
16.4.2 Chilling injury
The papaya fruit at the colour-turning stage 
can be stored at temperatures as low as 7°C 
for less than 14 days and it will ripen nor￾mally (Thompson and Lee, 1971; Chen and 
Paull, 1986; Cámara et al., 1993; Proulx et al. 
2005; Rocha et al. 2005; Rivera-Pastrana 
et al., 2010; Sivakumar and Wall, 2013; 
Gomes et al., 2016). Chilling injury symp￾toms include skin scald (Fig. 16.1C), hard 
lumps in the pulp around the vascular bun￾dles, uneven ripening, inferior fruit flavour, 
water soaking of flesh, and increased sus￾ceptibility to postharvest pathogens (Thompson 
and Lee, 1971; El-Tomi et al., 1974; Chen and 
Paull, 1986; Sivakumar and Wall, 2013). 
The severity of symptom development is de￾pendent upon cultivar and duration of ex￾posure to temperatures below 10°C (Fig. 16.2). 
Fruit becomes progressively less susceptible 
to chilling stress as they ripen (Chen and 
Paull, 1986).
Symptoms of chilling injury occur after 
14 days at 5°C for mature green fruit and 
21 days for 60% yellow fruit (Fig. 16.2). The 
decrease in susceptibility has been related 
to the stage of the fruit climacteric (Chan, 
1988). Prior to the appearance of visible chill￾ing injury symptoms, an increase in electro￾lyte leakage and ethylene production occurs 
together with changes in the fruit’s energy 
status (Chan et al., 1985; Pan et al., 2017). 
Increased Alternaria rot is observed in ma￾ture green papayas kept for 4 days at 2°C, 
6 days at 5°C, 10 days at 7.5°C, or 14 days at 
10°C. Storing papaya at low chilling temper￾atures (<10°C) that do not exceed the thresh￾old storage duration for chilling symptom

development is a common practice in ship￾ping papaya over long distances to market 
(Fig. 16.2).
Chilling injury incidence can be allevi￾ated with postharvest hot water treatments. 
The double-dip hot water treatment (first 
immersing fruit in hot water at 42°C for 
30 min followed by immediate immersion 
in hot water at 49°C for 20 min) applied in 
‘Frangi’ papaya fruit before storage at 6°C 
significantly reduced the incidence of chill￾ing injury (Shadmani et al., 2015). Also 
heating fruit to 38°C for 6–24 h before stor￾age at low temperature has also been reported 
to reduce chilling injury (Ali et al., 2000).
16.4.3 Mesocarp softening variation
Mesocarp softening occurs over 6–12 days 
after the harvesting of CB fruit. Internally, 
the fruit mesocarp changes from white￾green to orange-yellow, salmon or reddish, 
depending on the variety and this colour 
change progressively moves from the endo￾carp next to the seed cavity towards the 
skin. During this process the pulp under￾goes significant changes in gene expression 
and cell wall modification that leads to soft￾ening (Paull and Chen, 1983; Wall, 2006; 
Thumdee et al., 2010; Fabi et al., 2014). 
Ripe papaya pulp chiefly consists of paren￾chyma cells, with a large volume of thin cell 
walls that are not highly resistant to com￾pression or physical impact (Oliveira and 
Vitoria, 2011). Varietal difference occurs in 
the temporal pattern of softening (Zhang 
and Paull, 1990) with some varieties show￾ing delayed softening until the fruit are al￾most fully yellow. Some varieties continue 
to soften during ripening and become very 
soft while other varieties soften to a stage 
that is slightly firmer and more easily eaten 
with a spoon.
The provision of excess nitrogen in the 
field can result in an early loss of fruit firm￾ness (Sams, 1999). However, this nitrogen￾induced alteration in texture is due to the 
indirect action of N (in excess) on the meso￾carp tissue’s capacity to accumulate calcium 
(Qiu et al., 1995). During fruit ripening, loss 
of pulp firmness is preceded by calcium 
loss from its binding sites on the cell wall 
structure and middle lamella (Qiu et al., 
1995). Higher mesocarp calcium has been 
shown to lead to greater firmness, reduced 
respiration and ethylene production and a 
slower ripening rate (Madani et al., 2014). 
Potassium is not directly related to papaya 
fruit texture though it does play a signifi￾cant role in the tissue’s turgor potential.
16.4.4 Disease and disinfestation 
heat injury
The export of papaya bound for the Ameri￾can market requires that packers select fruit, 
perform a quarantine treatment, and apply 
wax to fruit, all aimed at controlling fruit fly 
larvae and fungus spores. The quarantine 
treatment consists of either a hot water or 
hot air treatment, or irradiation. The old 
heat treatment was a 20-min immersion in 
water (or vapour heat or hot forced air) at 
48°C ± 1°C (Paull and Chen, 1990, 2000; 
Pimentel et al., 2007), a procedure that fre￾quently caused heat injury (Fig. 16.1D). The 
severity of injury varied with the sensitivity 
of fruit to the thermal treatment during the 
year and preharvest conditions that may 
promote heat injury (Paull, 1995; Paull et al., 
1997; Corrêa et al., 2008).
The extent of heat injury is a function 
of exposure temperature, duration and how 
quickly the fruit is cooled following the 
heat treatment (Paull et al., 1997). The most 
common symptoms of injury include dark￾ening or discoloration of skin, accelerated 
senescence and a failure of the fruit meso￾carp to soften fully or softening at a reduced 
rate, increased water loss, and darkening of 
pulp coloration (Paull and Chen, 1990). A fail￾ure of the mesocarp to fully soften during 
ripening following heat stress is similar to 
the ‘hard lumps’ disorder (Fig. 16.1D) and 
frequently occurs without any external symp￾toms. In ‘Solo’ types and the ‘Golden’ papaya, 
the hard mesocarp flesh is clearly defined 
close to the endocarp and is much firmer 
than in the neighbouring areas (Paull and 
Chen, 1990; Oliveira and Vitoria, 2011). When 
Downloaded from https://cabidigitallibrary.org by Ivanov Ivan, on 11/04/24.
Subject to the CABI Digital Library Terms & Conditions, available at https://cabidigitallibrary.org/terms-and-conditions246 P. Muda et al.
the fruit is fully ripe, this heat-damaged 
mesocarp can be easily separated as an 
‘egg’-shaped hard nodule or as areas of un￾softened mesocarp (Paull and Chen, 2000; 
Oliveira and Vitoria, 2011). It is proposed 
that aspects of the cell wall degradation 
syndrome are not activated and are not re￾versible when the fruit is returned to ambi￾ent temperatures.
The degree of injury from heat stress is 
dependent upon: (i) the level of field￾induced thermotolerance; (ii) the cultivar; 
(iii) fruit size and morphological character￾istics; (iv) physiological state (stage of ripe￾ness); (v) heat transfer rate and energy balance 
(thermal difference, heat capacity and RH); 
(vi) final temperature; and (vii) the duration 
of exposure at different temperatures (Paull 
and Chen, 2000).
Some treatments can increase thermal 
tolerance: for example, preconditioning with 
heat treatment at 35–42°C for 3 h, followed 
by a rest at 22°C for 3 h, before exposure to 
higher temperatures (Paull and Chen, 1990). 
These preconditioning treatments most likely 
allowed heat shock proteins (HSP) and asso￾ciated thermotolerance proteins to be syn￾thesized. Loss of thermotolerance is associated 
with the disappearance of HSP (Lurie, 1998; 
Paull and Chen, 2000; Oliveira and Vitoria, 
2011). This explains the greater sensitivity 
of fruit to heat injury when harvested after a 
period of cool temperatures or in the cool 
season (Paull, 1995). If the average tempera￾ture for the 3 days before harvest was be￾tween 17°C and 31°C, there was a significant 
correlation with an increase in the resistance 
of papaya fruit to damage caused by expos￾ure to temperatures of 49°C. Fruit with high 
mesocarp calcium levels are more sensitive 
to heat injury.
16.5 Insect Disinfestation
Fruit fly infestation becomes a quarantine 
problem in papaya after the fruit has more 
than 25% skin yellowing (Seo et al., 1982; 
Dong et al., 2011) (Fig. 16.1A). However, the 
papaya fruit fly (Toxotrypana curvicauda) 
has a narrow host range and the females 
only oviposited in papaya fruit with a low 
sugar content which were immature, green, 
medium sized and ovoid shaped (Martínez￾Barrera et al., 2015). The damage caused by 
fruit flies to ripening fruit includes small 
surface blemishes, destruction of the edible 
flesh and spoilage from decay (Singh and 
Rao, 2011). Heat treatments and irradiation 
can be used to achieve fruit fly disinfestation 
(Paull, 1990; Armstrong, 1994; Singh and 
Rao, 2011). Papaya can tolerate insecticidal 
atmospheres (0.17–0.35% O2
, balanced with 
N2
) for up to 3 days at 20°C without risk of 
fruit injury, although after 3 days in low O2
and a further 3 days in air, the fruit developed 
off-flavours (Yahia et al., 1989). The disin￾festation potential of using a procedure such 
as this has not been shown.
16.6 Conclusions
Over the last two decades, papaya fruit 
ripening and handling research has taken 
on renewed importance. This importance is 
due to an increased worldwide consumer 
awareness of this fruit and the subsequent 
expansion in production and exports. The 
major research issues are quality retention 
and postharvest storage life that place con￾straints on marketing. Quality problems seen 
in the markets include variable fruit sizes 
and shapes, mechanical injury, blemishes 
(freckles), dehydration, and though not seen, 
taste as determined by sweetness. Another 
frequent problem is postharvest diseases, 
coupled in some cases with chilling injury.
Sugar accumulation by papaya is tied to 
the difficulty that we must harvest papaya 
after ripening as judged by skin colour changes 
referred to as CB. Fruit fly egg lay and sus￾ceptibility to mechanical injury imposes 
upper limits of 25% and 45% skin colour 
on the harvest window, respectively.
Efforts are continuing to modify ripening 
and to thereby extend postharvest life. Vari￾ation already exists among papaya varieties 
in ripening patterns and this offers another 
approach to delaying fruit ripening. The 
ethylene receptor inhibitor (1-MCP) has been 
widely tested and holds some promise, though

there are problems in its use at certain 
stages of papaya ripening.
