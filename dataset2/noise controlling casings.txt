Noise-Controlling 
Casings
Due to technological development, noise and vibration are ubiquitous in the hu￾man environment and belong to the most significant threats to man’s wellbeing. 
Noise-Controlling Casings offers a range of feasible noise-controlling strate￾gies for different kinds of devices generating excessive noise. Depending on the 
required performance and the availability of energy sources, three solution cat￾egories are presented: passive (no external energy is needed, but performance is 
limited), semi-active (little energy is needed, but performance achieves higher 
values) and active (best performance, but an external energy source is needed). 
Two very important benefits of these proposed solutions are global noise reduc￾tion (in an entire enclosure or the surrounding space) and compact technology 
(contrary to other active noise control solutions requiring a large number of sec￾ondary sources and distributed sensors). Many of the solutions presented are 
original approaches by the authors, their own developed concepts and new ele￾ments and designs that have gained recognition in prestigious journals. The book 
provides a theoretical background to the research, looking at system configura￾tions, mathematical modelling, signal processing implementation and numerical 
analysis.
The proposed ideas can be applied to any devices provided they have casings of 
thin walls or they can be enclosed by casings of thin walls. Applications include 
industrial devices, household appliances, vehicle or aircraft cabins and more. 
This book will be of interest to professionals and students in the fields of acous￾tics, vibration, signal processing, control, automotive and aircraft engineering.Taylor & Francis

http://taylorandfrancis.comPreface
Due to technological development, noise and vibration are ubiquitous in the human
environment and belong to the most significant threats to man’s wellbeing. The Eu￾ropean Environment Agency reports alarmingly that noise pollution is a major en￾vironmental health concern in Europe. Some of the most common noise and vi￾bration sources are devices of different kinds, including industrial, household and
automotive. Sound-absorbing materials are commonly applied to reduce excessive
device noise. However, they are generally ineffective for low frequencies and often
are inapplicable due to increase of size and weight of the device and its potential
for overheating. Personal hearing protection is not ergonomic, and it is unacceptable
for regular living. This motivates scientists to look for new ways to reduce noise,
well-fitted to the current challenges and expectations.
The main idea behind the noise-controlling methods proposed by the authors in
this book is to act directly at the source of noise. In particular, the idea is to use the
casing (also referred to as housing or enclosure) of the noise-generating device to
isolate it acoustically from the surrounding environment.
In this book different kinds of casings are considered, starting with casings with
rigid frames (to reduce wall interactions), to casings with double panel walls, to
casings of flexible structures (with all complicated couplings) and, finally, casings
of market-available devices, with sophisticated shapes as well as vibration and noise
patterns.
Mathematical, numerical and experimental models of considered casings are de￾veloped and presented as they are of particular importance for control methods and
for better understanding of existing phenomena, interactions and interpretations of
control results.
The book offers a range of feasible noise-controlling strategies for devices gen￾erating excessive noise. Depending on the required performance and the availability
of energy sources, three solution categories are presented: passive (no external en￾ergy is needed, but performance is limited), semi-active (little energy needed, but
performance achieves higher values) and active (best performance, but an exter￾nal energy source is needed). A very important benefit of the proposed solutions
is global noise reduction (in an entire enclosure or surrounding space) and compact
technology (contrary to other active noise control solutions requiring a large number
of secondary sources and sensors distributed). Many of the solutions presented are
original approaches by the authors, their own developed concepts and new elements
and designs that have gained recognition in prestigious journals.
In order to enable readers to better understand and feel the whole concept of
noise-reducing enclosures, and perhaps to replicate their design or even conduct
experiments themselves, the authors decided to choose a particular form for this
book. It can be regarded as a consistent case study with examples of several casing
types of increasing complexity. Therefore, all the material data, construction details,
algorithm parameters, practical aspects including system configuration, efficient
xixii Preface
signal processing implementation, conditions and method of experiments are given.
The stages of design, construction and testing are intertwined with the theoretical
parts necessary for their execution or better understanding.
The proposed ideas can be applied to any devices provided they have casings of
thin walls or they can be enclosed by casings of thin walls. Applications include
vehicle or aircraft cabins, and more.
This book is the result of many years of research on noise and vibration control
in the Department of Measurements and Control Systems at the Silesian University
of Technology in Gliwice, Poland, where the presented concept of noise-reducing
device casings was created and developed. The presented results are the result of
the project funded by the National Science Centre, Poland, contract number UMO￾2017/25/B/ST7/02236. The editors would like to express their deepest thanks to the

Introduction
1.1 NOISE IN THE MODERN WORLD
Sound accompanies humans in everyday life. First of all, it is used for communi￾cation, but it also informs about dangers and warns. Pleasant sounds, such as birds
singing, water flow or music, make it easier to relax. People are used to living among
sounds. But even in the modern world sounds can also be unpleasant or danger￾ous. However, a dichotomous classification is difficult and requires taking into ac￾count psychoacoustic phenomena and holistic analysis. A sound that in some circum￾stances may be informative and necessary for doing something, in other condition,
for example when one wants to relax, can be disturbing. The degree of annoyance
also depends on the mood we are in, our current condition and many other factors.
Sound that is unpleasant or disturbing under certain conditions is referred to as noise
for the purposes of this study.
Noise is currently one of the most significant hazards to humans in the workplace,
making it difficult to communicate by voice, to hear alarms and warnings, and being
the source of many ailments and diseases, especially hearing diseases. Noise at home
makes it difficult to rest and causes irritation. Long-term exposure to noise at high
sound pressure levels can lead to permanent hearing damage. These issues are the
subject of many studies and are reflected in defined standards.
The most important sources of noise include equipment - both industrial, domes￾tic and transportation. Noise is most often produced by rotating and reciprocating
machinery, as well as by vibration or friction of materials. The source of the noise
determines its character. We distinguish between narrowband noise, including tone
or multi-tone noise, and broadband noise. In many cases, both types of noise oc￾cur together, with varying contribution. Particularly troublesome is impulsive noise
associated with a single or series of acoustic events of short duration, usually less
than 1 s.
1.2 NOISE REDUCTION METHODS
Humans can try to protect themselves against noise in various ways. To some extent,
noise can be reduced by improving the design of the equipment, for example by
better fitting parts, reducing clearances, introducing washers and insulating mats.
Usually these are the cheapest methods, but they are not always effective enough,
and in some types of equipment, such as those involved in material handling, they
are impossible to use. In this case, one can try to isolate the noise source from people
or people from the noise source. In this case, sound insulating or sound absorbing
barriers or screens are used. However, this method in its classical formulation has
a number of limitations, most often associated with decreasing effectiveness for low
frequencies, which are often dominant in machinery and equipment noise and road

noise. Improved effectiveness is achieved by increasing the thickness and density of
barrier materials, which in turn is unacceptable in many cases, because it involves
increased size and weight, and impedes the dissipation of heat from the equipment
insulated in this way. A special case of isolation is personal hearing protection in the
form of earmuffs or earplugs, for example, when other methods are not applicable, or
the user needs to operate processes that generate excessive noise. The above solutions
are passive in nature, where there are not employed any components that require the
use of any energy.
With the development of microelectronics and signal processing techniques in the
last 30 years, active noise reduction methods are gaining popularity. Their hallmark
is the introduction of external energy into the process. There are different physical
justifications associated with different active control methods. The most common
justification is based on the Young’s principle of destructive wave interference – the
superposition of two acoustic waves with the same amplitudes but opposite phases
causes their mutual elimination. Starting from these premises, therefore, it is neces￾sary to generate an additional acoustic wave, which will destructively interfere with
the acoustic wave associated with noise. Such a wave should be generated using an
additional secondary sound source, such as a loudspeaker or other vibrating struc￾ture, based on measurements made in the acoustic field, or by estimating appropriate
quantities using mathematical models. Unfortunately, while the general form of the
method seems to be very simple, its effective application in practice encounters many
limitations. First of all, the acoustic field is complex in nature, and even if one could
ensure that the above amplitude-phase condition could be satisfied at a single point
in space, it is much more difficult to satisfy it over a larger area. In practice, this
can produce so-called local quiet zones, the size of which depends largely on the
frequencies dominating the noise. Enlarging these sizes requires suitably favourable
geometrical conditions or the use of many or very many secondary sound sources.
This involves considerable complexity of the algorithm, of the entire system, includ￾ing the electronics, requiring multi-channel high-speed processing, and thus consid￾erable and usually unacceptable cost. This complexity increases, in the case when
the reduction of the sound pressure level is not the only goal, but it is also necessary
to provide a rapid response to changes in the parameters of the sound field caused,
for example, by non-stationary of noise, changes in the room itself, movement of
users, temperature changes, etc.
Active noise reduction is also explained by the absorption of noise by secondary
sources or by the control of the acoustic impedance of the medium by secondary
sources. The use of such phenomena gave rise to the concept called active structural
acoustic control, in which the vibration of the barrier separating two media is con￾trolled in such a way as to reduce the transmission of sound between them. Many
studies are known in the literature, especially concerning the vibration control of
single or double-panel barriers. If the noise is transmitted mainly through these bar￾riers and not through other paths, this approach allows a global noise reduction in
the entire listening space.Introduction 3
The structural approach can be modified by dispensing with the need to inject
additional energy into the sound field through semi-active controls. In the classical
approach, this involves using a control system to change the parameters of piezoelec￾tric elements bonded to an acoustic barrier in such a way as to alter its vibrational
and sound transmission properties. Additional energy is therefore needed here only
to change these parameters, not to excite vibrations of the structure or to generate
secondary sound. The energy is therefore much less than for active control, and the
complexity of the system is usually significant.
1.3 NOISE-CONTROLLING CASING
A common way to reduce the noise of many types of equipment is to enclose it
in a sound-absorbing casing and thus isolate it from its surroundings. As a result,
many casings are very heavy, thick, and have sound-absorbing materials, but this
consumes a lot of raw materials and also makes heat dissipation difficult. Further￾more, such passive methods are not very effective for low frequencies. Classical
active noise reduction methods, based on the principle of destructive interference of
acoustic waves, require the use of a large number of sound sources and control and
measurement apparatus, and yet allow only local zones of quiet, while beyond them
the sound is reinforced.
The authors propose another, much more effective approach to reducing the noise
of equipment—the control of vibrations of its casing. Thus, it is assumed that the de￾vice is enclosed in a thin-walled casing made of resilient material or the device can
be placed in an additional casing with such properties. The above concept is an ex￾tension of the known method of controlling vibrations of a single wall or a system of
two walls separating adjacent acoustic media—one in which noise is generated from
the other in which noise reduction is desired. Casing vibration control introduces
significant complications resulting from the interactions of the controlled walls and
the multidimensionality of the overall problem. All three approaches described in the
previous section can be applied to the casing control problem and many innovative
solutions can be introduced—passive control, active control, semi-active control, and
combinations thereof. Casing control aims at changes in its response that increase its
acoustic isolation for specific frequency ranges associated with the generated noise.
Properly designed, it can provide global noise reduction outside the casing without
the need for additional and cumbersome secondary sources located in the environ￾ment.
1.4 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE BOOK
The objective of this monograph is to present and convince the scientific commu￾nity as well as practitioners and equipment manufacturers of the concept of effective
global noise reduction of devices by controlling the vibration of their casings. This
goal is to be achieved by combining theory with simulation and laboratory studies.
A detailed presentation of design issues is necessary for this. Therefore, the authors
decided to elaborate the monograph in the form of case studies.4 Noise-Controlling Casings
At the very beginning, in Chapter 2, concrete experimental types of casings are
presented, and thus their geometrical and material parameters are given. For this
reason, concrete modelling and control results are presented, giving the reader the
opportunity for direct reference. The authors also try to generalize the conclusions.
The first type of casing considered is a casing with a rigid structure consisting of
a heavy frame to which walls constructed of one or two panels connected in paral￾lel are attached. This design makes it possible to reduce the number of phenomena
occurring by rigidly fixing the boundary conditions of the walls, thereby eliminating
the influence of the vibrations of each wall on the boundary conditions of adjacent
walls. It also facilitates modification of the space between the panels.
The degree of complication is increased in the second type of casing—a casing
with flexible structure, made of folded and properly jointed walls, without the medi￾ation of an additional frame. Then, under the influence of vibrations forced by noise
or control, the casing undergoes temporary deformations of shape, increasing the
research challenge.
The third type of casing—the casing of a real device—is definitely more chal￾lenging. A top-loading washing machine purchased from a supermarket was used as
an example. Such a casing is characterized by a complex shape, different types of
materials and connections, openings, and a multitude of phenomena occurring and
interacting. Therefore, it requires a more generalized modelling approach and more
compensation in control algorithms.
Each type of control considered in this monograph requires an appropriate ob￾ject model with its associated components. Chapter 3 is devoted to this subject and
shows how to build models of a single wall, single-panel or double-panel one, as
well as an entire casing. In this general case, a number of interacting subsystems
are specified, as control of one panel causes vibrations of the medium between the
panels and thus of the other panel in a two-panel arrangement, of the medium filling
the casing and thus of the incident panels of the other walls, vibrations of a panel in
a flexible casing cause changes in its boundary conditions and thus changes in the
boundary conditions of the adjacent panels. The relationship between vibration and
acoustic emission, the effect of the medium outside the casing on the outer panels,
and the interactions can also be considered.
Various modelling approaches have been used, including a modal approach and
a state-space description. The developed theoretical models have been verified by
simulation using multiphysics packages and experimentally in laboratory tests using
the casing designs described above. Experimental measurements have also been used
to fine tune the parameters of the mathematical models. Principles are given and
properties of observability and controllability of such objects are also analysed.
Chapter 4 deals with passive control. In the traditional view, passive control in￾volves the use of a sound-absorbing material whose parameters are selected accord￾ing to frequency. In general, suitably thick and thus heavy materials are required
for low frequencies. The authors have shown that by attaching appropriately opti￾mized point masses and ribs to the casing walls, it is possible to fully shape the fre￾quency response of the structure and thus provide high isolation for noise dominantIntroduction 5
frequencies. Examples of different quality functions are used to show how different
functionalities can be achieved with this method. A particular benefit of this ap￾proach is that significant sound reduction effects can be achieved at minimal, even
near-zero cost, since the installation of these additional elements can be carried out
at the manufacturing stage of the device casing.
An extension of this concept is the use of composite materials with variable prop￾erties along their cross section, which are known as functionally graded materials.
Such an appropriately designed composite has more favourable sound insulation
properties.
A particular type of passive reduction is the use of shunt circuits that collect en￾ergy from the surface of a vibrating plate, convert it into electrical energy and then
dissipate it. The design of such a circuit is shown in detail.
Chapter 5 presents a semi-active approach to control. In brief, it consists of con￾trolling changes in the parameters of an object, in particular switching, in such a way
that energy is absorbed and dissipated accordingly. Energy is thus only needed to
control these changes and is not introduced into the vibroacoustic system. The con￾cept of shunt circuits was developed by moving it from a passive to a semi-active
level. Shunt circuits known from literature are based on piezoelectric elements glued
to a vibrating plate. The authors have additionally proposed a completely different
approach. One of them, appropriate for two-panel walls, consists in the use of con￾trolled links placed at selected locations between the panels, in such a way that, de￾pending on the frequency ranges dominating the noise, the frequency response of the
wall is altered so as to produce anti-resonant valleys in those ranges, thus increasing
its acoustic isolation. Another approach involves a single-panel wall. It is based on
using a concentrated mass and moving it on a mandrel attached to the panel, thereby
changing the frequency response. Both of the proposed approaches have proven to
be a very effective method of shaping the vibrating response of the structure.
Each time, the entire design process, including the hardware circuit and the algo￾rithm, is given.
Chapter 6 deals with active control—the most complex in terms of hardware and
algorithms, and thus involving the greatest implementation cost, but giving the great￾est flexibility and the possibility of achieving higher levels of sound reduction. In the
case of active control, proper selection of measurement and actuation elements, as
well as their mounting locations, is crucial. Their presence affects the properties of
the object due to the non-zero mass, especially in the case of vibration exciters, but
most importantly the ability to observe and control subsequent modes. Therefore, the
first part of this chapter presents a method of optimizing the placement of measur￾ing and actuating elements based on a formal approach known from control theory.
The method of construction of the electronic system and data processing is also de￾scribed. The control structures—feedforward and feedback—are presented. Atten￾tion is paid to the internal acoustic feedback. The method of control with virtual
microphones is presented, which enables the reduction of estimated sound pressure
based on other measurements. Control algorithms based on Least Mean Squares fam￾ily are discussed. The problems of stability and effective implementation are pointed6 Noise-Controlling Casings
out. Many design guidelines and specific algorithmic solutions for multidimensional
control systems are given.
Chapter 7 provides a summary. It presents the main results and conclusions of
the monograph. It also indicates the applicability of the proposed methods and the
directions of further development of the proposed concept of control of device cas￾ings.
References lists literature related to the topics discussed.

The presented concept of noise-reducing casing is inherently entangled with the vi￾broacoustical system it is based on. Hence, to gradually scale-up the complexity of
the considered structures, both the actual research performed by the authors and in￾troduction to considered types of casings given in this chapter have been divided into
three stages. Each of them is characterized by different features affecting the adopted
noise-controlling solutions.
In the first research stage, the rigid casing was considered, since the employment
a heavy frame limits vibrational couplings between walls, facilitating initial attempts
to develop a mathematical model and to control casing vibrations. Moreover, such
structure can be easily reconfigurable, enabling experiments with different panel ma￾terials, thicknesses, and single- or double-panel walls.
In the second stage, the light-weight casing was used, which in contrast to pre￾viously employed structure, is made without an explicit frame, resulting in greater
vibrational couplings. The casing is made of metal plates bolted directly together,
therefore the structure is not reconfigurable. However, it resembles more real casings
commonly used in the industry.
In the third and final stage, a real device casing was used as the subject of both
modelling and noise control. A common washing machine was utilized as an exam￾ple.
Each of aforementioned casings is described in this chapter, starting with details
of a mechanical structure. Then, selection and arrangement of applied actuators and
sensors are discussed. Finally, vibroacoustical analysis of the structures based on
secondary paths and frequency response functions is presented.
2.2 RIGID CASING
The rigid casing discussed in this section is presented in Fig. 2.1, where dimensions,
cross-sections and the method of mounting of casing walls are visualized. A photo￾graph of the casing is given in Fig. 2.2. The casing has a heavy cubic frame made
of 3 mm thick welded steel profiles. The high rigidity of the frame results in its res￾onance frequencies to be far above frequencies of the noise considered. The bottom
of the casing is vibrationally and acoustically insulated. All walls of the casing are
made of single or double panels. Each panel is attached to the structure by 20 screws
embedded in the frame, and clamped with an additional steel square frame. Fully￾clamped boundary conditions can be then assumed for the panels, achieving satis￾factory modelling accuracy. For double panels the distance between them is 50 mm.

The panel closer to the casing interior is called the incident panel, and the outer panel
is referred to as the radiating panel.
2.2.1 ACTUATORS AND SENSORS
In this stage of research, a loudspeaker placed on the casing floor was used as the
primary noise source. It allowed for creating an environment more suitable for the

research than a real operating device, which has been used in following stages. For
feedforward control system implementations, the reference signal was obtained by
a microphone placed next to the loudspeaker inside the casing enclosure (referred
to further as the reference microphone). In front of each casing wall, a microphone
is placed in the distance of 500 mm (referred to as the error microphone). These
microphones are used mainly for control-related purposes. Additionally, to evaluate
the noise reduction efficiency, multiple microphones were placed at several larger
distances from the casing, corresponding to potential locations of the user (referred
to as the room microphones). The laboratory setup is presented schematically in
Fig. 2.3. Photographs of the rigid casing with mounted sensors and actuators are
given in Fig. 2.4.
To control vibrations of the casing walls, inertial exciters NXT EX-1 were used.
They weight 115 g and they are of small dimensions (70 mm), comparing to the
size of the casing. In the performed control experiments, they are mounted on the
incident plates from the inner side, three actuators per panel. Their placement has
been optimized using a method that maximizes a measure of the controllability of
the system. The impact of the mass of the actuators is included in the optimization
procedure, as it is comparable with the mass of the casing walls and substantially
affects their dynamical behaviour. The method of actuators positioning is described
in details in Subsection 6.2.1.
As sensors for control purposes, microphones (Beyerdynamic MM-1) or ac￾celerometers (Analog Devices ADXL203) were used, depending on the chosen con￾trol configuration. Accelerometers locations were calculated according to the methodConsidered types of casings 11

that maximizes a measure of the observability of the system [167]. The placement of
actuators and sensors was identical for each wall. In contrast to the inertial exciters,
the employed accelerometers are light-weight (5 g) comparing to the mass of the
casing walls, and therefore they have a marginal loading effect and their mass can
be safely neglected in the mathematical modelling. However, if heavier sensors were
used or an application would require a highest modelling accuracy, their mass could
be modelled analogously as in the case of inertial exciters.
An additional type of the sensors used was a laser vibrometer Polytec PDV-100.
As a specialized laboratory equipment, it was not used for active control experiments
as a signal source (it would be infeasible in commercial applications), but for highly
precise non-contact measurement of vibrations in laboratory environment, strictly
for the research purposes (the obtained data have been used mainly to validate the
mathematical modelling accuracy). Utilizing that the measurement does not affect
anyhow the dynamical behaviour of the vibrating panel, all of experimentally mea￾sured mode shapes of casing walls presented are obtained with the laser vibrometer.
2.2.2 SECONDARY PATHS ANALYSIS
To present the vibroacoustical properties of the structure, a set of exemplary ampli￾tude responses of secondary paths obtained for the rigid casing with single panels is
shown in Figs. 2.5(a)–(d). It follows from the analysis that the direct paths between
actuators and accelerometers mounted on the same wall are of similar magnitude in
whole frequency range considered (see Fig. 2.5(a)). In turn, the magnitudes of cross
paths between actuators mounted on one wall and accelerometers mounted on the
other wall are many times weaker, comparing to magnitudes of direct paths within
the same wall (see Fig. 2.5(b)). This is due to the heavy and rigid frame of the cas￾ing, isolating vibrationally individual walls. Hence, the interference with each other
is mainly through the acoustic field. Therefore, since such separation has been no￾ticed, for the mathematical modelling and control purposes, it is justified to consider
each of the walls separately.
Analogous behaviour can be observed for the paths between actuators and outer
microphones, but only for low frequencies up to approximately 250 Hz. Above this
frequency, the cross paths between actuators mounted to one wall and an outer mi￾crophone placed in front of another wall become of similar magnitude, as the direct
paths between actuators and an outer microphone assigned for the same wall (see
Figs. 2.5(c) and (d)).
2.3 LIGHTWEIGHT CASING
2.3.1 ACTUATORS AND SENSORS
The light-weight device casing used in the second stage of research is presented in
Fig. 2.6. In contrast to the rigid casing used in the previous stage, the light-weight
casing was made without an explicit frame. It was made of steel plates (of 1.5 mm
thick) bolted together, forming a closed cuboid of dimensions 500 mm×630 mm×Considered types of casings 13
800 mm. Such structure results in greater vibrational couplings between individual
walls, in addition to couplings through the acoustic field inside and, to a lesser ex￾tends, outside the casing. Moreover, due to the absence of the rigid frame, the walls
were connected directly to each other, what results in boundary conditions which no
longer behave as fully clamped—boundary conditions elastically restrained against
both rotation and translation are more appropriate. Identification of spring constants
representing elastic boundary conditions of light-weight device casing walls are per￾formed using experimental data and a memetic algorithm. The procedure is described
in details in [169].

International Congress on Sound and Vibration, Athens, Greece, 2016.
Figure 2.7 Photographs of the light-weight active casing with mounted sensors and actuators
and a wire holder.14 Noise-Controlling Casings
Similarly as in the previous stage, a loudspeaker placed on the sound-insulating
basis is used as the primary noise source. A reference microphone placed next to
the loudspeaker is used to obtain the reference signal. In front of each casing wall,
a microphone was placed in the distance of 500 mm (also referred to as the error
microphone). The room microphones are placed in similar configuration as in case of
the rigid casing. Photographs of the light-weight active casing with mounted sensors
and actuators are given in Fig. 2.7.
Inertial exciters NXT EX-1 are used to control vibrations of the casing walls. They
are mounted on the walls from the inner side. The number of actuators depends on
the particular wall—four actuators are mounted to front, right, back and left wall, and
five actuators to the top wall. Their placement has been optimized using a method
that maximizes a measure of the controllability of the system. Boundary conditions
elastically restrained against both rotation and translation are used in the mathemat￾ical modelling [169]. As shown in Fig. 2.7, light-weight frames are added to the
laboratory stand to support the actuators cables (inside the casing) and sensors ca￾bles (outside the casing). These frames are made in such a manner that they do not
affect the vibrational or acoustical behaviour of the casing. The accelerometers used
for control purposes (Analog Devices ADXL203) are collocated with the actuators.
2.3.2 FREQUENCY RESPONSE FUNCTIONS
The described light-weight casing is a three-dimensional structure. The couplings
between individual walls, of both vibrational and acoustical nature, are significant.
However, noteworthy is an analysis of spatially averaged (over the area of each wall)
frequency responses of three walls of the casing, presented in Fig. 2.8 (left, front and
top walls; right and back walls are omitted as they are symmetrical to the left and
front walls, respectively). Resonances that originate on one wall, are clearly visible
on the others. However, all of resonances visible as peaks in the given frequency
range can be assigned to one of the walls where they originate. Such assignment of
the eigenmodes is consistent with the mathematical model developed in Chapter 3
and validated for the light-weight casing in Section 3.5.
It leads to a conclusion that observed natural frequencies and mode shapes of the
whole structure are a consequence of superposition of resonances of each wall ex￾cited individually (but as a part of the structure). Therefore, it is justified to analyse
the walls separately for the purpose of optimization of actuators locations, consider￾ing only eigenmodes due to the given wall—if the resonance is appropriately mod￾elled at the wall where it originates, it will be accordingly included in the process of
sensors and actuators arrangement optimization for the whole casing. It means also
that if the given mode is controlled with actuators at the wall where it originates, it
will be reduced for the whole casing.
It is also worth noting that for the control purposes, separate control of each wall
has more strict limitations, than in case of the rigid casing—a multichannel control
system for the whole casing is more appropriate.Considered types of casings 15
2.3.3 SECONDARY PATHS ANALYSIS
It follows from the analysis of secondary paths given in Fig. 2.9 that magnitudes
of cross paths between actuators mounted on one wall and accelerometers mounted
on the other wall are weaker than magnitudes of direct paths within the same wall
only up to frequency of approximately 250 Hz (see Figs. 2.9(a) and (b)). Above this
frequency, magnitudes of cross paths and direct paths are similar. It confirms, as
expected, higher vibrational couplings between individual walls than in case of the
rigid casing (where cross paths are many times weaker than direct paths in whole
frequency range considered).
On the other hand, for the paths between actuators and outer microphones, cross
paths and direct paths represent a similar magnitude in the whole frequency range
Figure 2.8 Spatially averaged frequency responses of casing walls. Two pairs of walls are
symmetrical (left and right, front and back), hence only one of each pair is presented in the
figure. Initial 12 eigenmodes originating at each wall are marked: eigenmodes originating at
left wall are marked with circle, at front wall with diamond, at top wall with square [170].

(in contrast to the case of the rigid casing, where for low frequencies direct paths
dominated over cross paths). Direct paths between actuators no. 0–3 and the outer
microphone assigned to the front wall are shown in Fig. 2.9(c). Cross paths between
actuators no. 0 mounted on different walls and the outer microphone assigned to the
front wall are presented in Fig. 2.9(d). Such strong couplings generally make the
synthesis of active noise control systems more difficult.
2.4 REAL CASING
The third type of the considered casings is a real device casing—ready-made and
mass-produced. As an example, a washing machine has been chosen. The considered
structure is presented in Fig. 2.10. In contrast to the laboratory casings described in
the previous sections, the real device casing is often very irregular and inhomoge￾neous. Each of the walls represent different features, i.e. bendings, embossments,
etc., what makes the task of fitting the mathematical model of each wall significantly
more difficult.
The casing is a three-dimensional structure with strong couplings between walls
(similarly to light-weight casing), however, different character of each wall is clearly
noticeable, along with factual structural separation. Therefore, to simplify the analy￾sis, each wall is considered separately for the purpose of actuators positioning, con￾sidering only eigenmodes due to the given wall (according to the concept that if
the resonance is controlled with actuators at the wall where it originates, it will be
reduced for whole casing).

M. Pawelczyk, and J. Klamka, 13th Conference on Active Noise and Vibration Control Meth￾ods, Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, 2017.18 Noise-Controlling Casings
To control vibrations of the device casing, inertial actuators are selected to be
used. Front, right, left and top wall are considered for the active control. The back
and the bottom of the casing are not controlled due to the fact, that the washing
machine is most often placed at a wall. The impact of the mass of the actuators is
included in the mathematical model of individual casing wall.
For the sake of brevity, the frequency response functions and secondary paths
analysis are omitted for the real casing—they highly resemble ones obtained for the
light-weight casing. The main difference is that parameters required for the mathe￾matical model are more difficult to define. In fact, they constitute an approximation
of the panels dynamical behaviour rather than direct representation of mechanical
properties.
2.5 SUMMARY
The laboratory setups for control experiments consisting of several different casings
have been presented and discussed in this chapter. The discussion includes practical
application-related aspects of the laboratory stand assembly, vibroacoustic analy￾sis of the introduced structures, set of assumptions setting a reference point for the
mathematical models developed in the following chapter, and selection of sensors
and actuators for the control systems.
Initially the rigid casing has been examined. Following conclusions are formu￾lated basing on the analysis of secondary paths:
• the direct paths between actuators and accelerometers mounted on the same
wall significantly dominate the cross paths between actuators mounted on
one wall and accelerometers mounted on the other wall, what confirms high
vibrational isolation between walls;
• for the paths between actuators and outer microphones, direct paths domi￾nate the cross paths only for low frequencies up to approximately 250 Hz
(above this frequency, they become of similar magnitude).
Afterwards, the light-weight casing has been considered. Studying its secondary
paths and frequency response functions, following conclusions are formulated:
• direct vibrational paths dominate the cross paths only up to approximately
250 Hz. (above this frequency, magnitudes of cross paths and direct paths
are similar, what confirms higher vibrational couplings);
• for the paths between actuators and outer microphones, cross paths and
direct paths represent a similar magnitude in the whole frequency range
considered;
• observed natural frequencies and mode shapes of the whole structure are
a consequence of superposition of resonances of each wall excited indi￾vidually (but as a part of the structure)—therefore, it is justified to analyse
the walls separately for the purpose of optimization of actuators locations,
considering only eigenmodes due to the given wall.Considered types of casings 19
Finally, the real device casing has been considered. Analysis of its secondary
paths and frequency response functions leads to the following conclusions:
• in contrast to the previously considered laboratory casings, the real de￾vice casing is very irregular and inhomogeneous, making the mathematical
modelling significantly more difficult;
• the strong couplings between walls, similar to the light-weight casing, re￾quire employment of multichannel control system for the whole casing in
order to be successful, however, for the purpose of optimization of actua￾tors locations it is admissible to analyse the walls separately.Taylor & Francis

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Formulation of a mathematical model of the considered device casings brings a set
of benefits. First, if the model is properly validated, it can be used for simulation and
analysis of the vibrating casing dynamical behaviour what facilitates a better under￾standing of the structure. It can be also used for preliminary evaluations of control
strategies. Moreover, the model can be used for optimization of the structure—to
shape its frequency response to improve its passive properties or to maximize the
susceptibility of the plant to the active or semi-active control. Also, it can be used to
efficiently apply actuators and sensors, so the maximum advantage could be taken of
them. All of the aforementioned benefits constitutes a significant value, what justify
the undertaken effort to formulate the appropriate model.
In general, the difficulty of problems treated in science and engineering typically
originates from the complexity of the systems under consideration. A system is un￾derstood as an object with distinguished input and output signals, whose proper￾ties/behaviour is to be studied. The general strategy used to understand behaviour
of complex systems is to apply appropriate simplified description of the system, i.e.
adequate model. More precisely, a mathematical model may be interpreted as an ab￾stract, simplified, mathematical construct related to a part of reality and created for
a particular purpose [8], e.g. to compute the time-space evolution of a physical sys￾tem, assess how the system performs, make predictions about the system behaviour
and quantify it. Generally, models provide adequate tools to make tractable prob￾lems related to complex systems. That is why, the adequate models place an impor￾tant role in the analysis of complex systems. All mathematical models are composed
of variables and a mathematical representation of the relationships between them.
There are many different types of mathematical models that are used to address dif￾ferent aspects of systems. Mathematical models can be classified in many different
ways depending on model operators, model parameters in relation to time, param￾eters types, parameters dimensionality, modelling goal, type of predicted outcome
and many other aspects/criteria/factors.
In general, mathematical models can be classified into the following categories:
Empirical (input-output models) or physical (process based models)
Model is referred to as a physical, if it is based on a priori information
about system it describes. In other words, physical model is based on math￾ematical description of phenomenon or process that is to be represented by
the model. Physical models usually involve physically interpretable parame￾ters, that is, parameters which represent real properties of the system what is
one of their most important advantages. As an essential prerequisite, physical
DOI: 10.1201/9781003273806-3 2122 Noise-Controlling Casings
models need a priori knowledge of the system, which is its characteristic fea￾ture. If nothing is known about the system, then empirical models have to be
applied. An empirical model relies on observation rather than theory. Empiri￾cal models are focused on describing the data with the specification of very few
assumptions about the data being analysed. In case of an empirical model the
structure of the model is determined by the observed relationships among ex￾perimental data. An important advantage of empirical models is that they can
be used in black box situations and that they typically require much less time
and resources compared to physical models. Empirical models are universally
applicable, easy to set up, but limited in scope. Physical models, in contrast,
allow usually deeper insights into system performance and better predictions,
but they require a priori knowledge about the system and often need more time
and resources to be synthesized.
Pragmatic considerations should decide which type of model is used in
practice.
Deterministic or stochastic
Division between deterministic and stochastic models is based on the type of
the outcome they can predict. Deterministic models ignore random variation,
and so always predict the same outcome from a given starting point. In other
words, in deterministic models, the output of the model is fully determined by
the parameters values and the initial conditions. Consequently, deterministic
models perform the same way for a given set of initial conditions. With a de￾terministic model, the uncertain factors are external to the model. On the other
hand, the model may be statistical in nature and so may predict the distribu￾tion of possible outcomes. Such models are said to be stochastic. The uncertain
factors are built into the stochastic model. Stochastic models possess some in￾herent randomness. Consequently, the same set of parameter values and initial
conditions will lead to an ensemble of different outputs. There are also used
combined models, which are based on a deterministic basis and some uncertain
behaviour is included in a stochastic part.
Discrete or continuous
In a continuous model, events can take place at every point in time. In a discrete
model, events are categorized within time intervals and can take place only at
discrete instants of time. Continuous models involve quantities that change
continuously with time. Discrete models, on the other hand, involve quantities
that change at discrete instants of time only.
In continuous models, the independent variables may assume arbitrary (typi￾cally real) values within some interval. In contrast, in discrete models the in￾dependent variables may assume some discrete values only.Modelling of casings 23
Static or dynamic
A dynamic model accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the sys￾tem, while a static (or steady-state) model describes the system in equilibrium,
and thus is time-invariant.
Unlike dynamic models, static models contain no time-dependent variables. It
means that the static model describes the system in its state at a specific time
instant. A static model is one which contains no internal history of either in￾put values previously applied, values of internal variables, or output values. In
static models relationships between outputs and inputs are typically described
by algebraic equations. In this type of model, each output is dependent on some
function of the inputs. With a static model, the value of output is determined
only by the current value of input/inputs and reacts instantaneously. It is also
possible for the output variables to be dependent on other output variables,
although this results in a model which may not have closed-form solutions.
A dynamic model accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the sys￾tem. With dynamic model it takes some time the output to react to changes on
the inputs. Dynamic models typically are described by difference equations or
differential equations depending on whether they are discrete or continuous in
time, respectively. If we are only interested in the equilibrium states of a dy￾namic system in which a given system may be, then we can restrict ourselves
to a static model for such a dynamic system. In this context, static model can
be considered as a steady-state of a dynamic model.
Stationary or non-stationary (instationary)
In non-stationary models, at least one of its parameters is a function of time
(depends on time). Otherwise, if all model parameters are constant over time
(independent of time) it is referred to as a stationary model. Non-stationary
models are used to describe systems whose characteristics changes signif￾icantly in time. There are more flexible but harder to solve. Models with
switched parameters can also be distinguished in this category.
Linear or non-linear
Mathematical models are usually composed by variables, which are abstrac￾tions of quantities of interest in the described systems, and operators that act
on these variables, which can be algebraic operators, functions, differential op￾erators, etc. If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit linearity, the
resulting mathematical model is referred to as a linear. Otherwise, a model is
considered to be nonlinear. Non-linear models are the models where the oper￾ator uses non-linear dependencies between outputs and inputs. They are more
difficult for analysis and do not have the superposition property when com￾pared to linear models. From the analysis point of view it is important to dis￾tinguish two types of linearities, i.e.: model linear in its inputs and model linear
in its parameters. Nonlinear models are typically more accurate but harder to
solve.24 Noise-Controlling Casings
Lumped (space-independent) or distributed (space-dependent)
A lumped model is one in which the dependent variables that are used to com￾pose the model are a function of time alone. In general, this means that math￾ematical representation of the relationships between variables take the form of
ordinary differential equations. A distributed model is one in which at least
one of dependent variables that are used to compose the model of one or more
spatial variables. This means that mathematical representation of the relation￾ships between variables take the form of partial differential equations. There
exist also so called of spatiotemporal distributed models in which dependent
variables describing model depends on both spatial variables and time.
Macroscopic or Microscopic
Macroscopic models concern with the macroscopic behaviour of the system.
In that case the system is characterized by average properties such as pres￾sure, volume, temperature, etc. Microscopic models consider the individual
behaviour of small constituents of the system at molecular or individual parti￾cle level.
1D, 2D, or 3D models
Depending on their spatial dimensionality, physical systems can be described
using 1, 2 or 3 space variables. The number of space variables used to describe
a physical system is called its dimension (frequently denoted 1D, 2D or 3D).
Direct or inverse
With direct model assuming given inputs and model parameters the output can
be determined. In contrast, if for given inputs and outputs we want to determine
model parameters or assuming given model parameters and outputs we want to
determine the input the inverse model should be used. If we ask for parameter
values, the resulting problem is also called a parameter identification problem.
If we ask for input, the resulting problem is also called a control problem,
since in this case the problem is to control the input in a way that generates
some desired output.
Remark 3.1 (Dichotomy of models categories)
It is important to answer the question about the dichotomy of the presented models
categories. It has to be pointed out that some of the above categorizations of mathe￾matical models overlap. For example, physical models can be lumped or distributed,
stationary or non-stationary, linear or nonlinear and so on. Consequently, presented
categorization is not dichotomic (disjoint).
The process of developing a mathematical model is referred to as mathematical
modelling. In general, in mathematical modelling of vibroacoustic systems under
discussion we follow the philosophy presented by G. Box [21]:Modelling of casings 25
“All models are approximations. Assumptions, whether implied or clearly stated,
are never exactly true. All models are wrong, but some models are useful. So the
question you need to ask is not ”Is the model true?” (it never is) but ”Is the model
good enough for this particular application?”
Consequently, what we expect from developed models is that they can supply
a useful approximation to reality related to the modelled vibroacoustic systems.
Developed models are used to explain vibroacoustic systems they describe, to
study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about their be￾haviour.
Remark 3.2 (The categories of models derived)
In the context of short introduction related to mathematical models presented in this
section models that are synthesized in consecutive subsections of this chapter are
physical, continuous in time and space, distributed in space (space-dependent), dy￾namic, stationary, linear, deterministic, 3D or 2D and macroscopic.
3.2 ANALYTICAL MODELLING OF INDIVIDUAL CASING WALLS
The successful application of the mathematical model depends on its accuracy, as
it should appropriately reflect real behaviour of the plant. On the other hand, to fa￾cilitate practical applicability, the model should not be complicated more than it is
necessary. Therefore, usually the model constitutes a trade-off between accuracy and
complexity. In the presented modelling of the device casing, there are several simpli￾fying assumptions adopted to obtain such balance.
Most importantly, basing on the vibroacoustical analysis given in the previous
chapter, each wall of the casing can be considered separately. It is an intuitive ap￾proach for the rigid casing where the separation of the walls is clearly visible. How￾ever, same approach can also be adopted in case of the light-weight or real casings, as
its frequency response can be decomposed into responses of individual walls. When
modelling each of the walls separately, such model can provide valuable overview
of the behaviour of the casing, however, certain walls interactions are missing. If
the available resources allows for a more advanced model, the casing can be mod￾elled as a whole what is also considered in details in this chapter. Other assumptions
are related to the employed theories of individual vibrating panels—the assumption
of small deflections of the panels, homogeneity of the panel material, etc. They are
described in more details in the following sections.
A plate is a structural element with a small thickness compared to the planar
dimensions. In most cases, the thickness is no greater than one-tenth of the smaller
in-plane dimension [147]. The theory of plates is an approximation of the three￾dimensional elasticity theory to two dimensions, which assumes that a mid-surface
plane can be used to represent deformation of every point of the plate. The aim of
the plate theory is to study the deformation and stresses in plate structures subjected
to loads.
In this section, fundamental issues of two-dimensional mathematical models of
plates are recalled to set a reference for further reading, where the final form of26 Noise-Controlling Casings
a model used for analysis of the casing walls is presented. Detailed derivations of
presented models can be found, e.g. in [156, 147, 145].
3.2.1 KIRCHHOFF-LOVE PLATE THEORY
The Kirchhoff-Love theory is a most elementary mathematical model of plates con￾sidered in this monograph. This theory is an extension of Euler-Bernoulli beam the￾ory and was developed in 1888 by Love using the Kirchhoff hypothesis [94], which
consists of the following assumptions:
• straight lines perpendicular to the mid-surface (i.e. transverse normals) be￾fore deformation remain straight after deformation;
• the transverse normals rotate such that they remain perpendicular to the
mid-surface after deformation;
• the transverse normals do not experience elongation (i.e. the thickness of
the plate does not change during a deformation).
Such assumptions are eligible for thin plates with small deflections, where shear
energy is negligible.
Due to the application of plate models for modelling of casing walls, hereinafter
the plate theories are considered and presented for rectangular plates (as a most
common shape of device casing walls). Hence, all following mathematical models
are given in Cartesian coordinates system. However, presented theories are valid for
plates of any shape and they can be easily expressed in different form, more suitable
for other plate shapes.
Isotropic Kirchhoff plate
For an isotropic and homogeneous plate, which occupies the X−Y plane in the ref￾erence stress-free state, free vibrations are governed by a differential system:

∂w(x, y,t)
∂t




t=t0
= 0 . (3.4)
In Eq. (3.1)–(3.4) the function w(x, y,t) denotes the displacement of the plate from
the reference state to the z-direction at time t > 0 and position (x, y); the lengths ofModelling of casings 27
rectangular plate sides are assumed to be equal to a and b, respectively; D is the
flexural rigidity; E is the Young’s modulus; ν is the Poisson’s ratio; ρp is the mass
density of the plate material; and h is the plate thickness.
The definitions of domains of spatial variables and time given in Eq. (3.2), for the
sake of brevity, are not repeated in following considerations in this section. However,
they are the same for all presented plate models.
Considering only the transverse motion and neglecting the effect of rotary inertia,
the kinetic and strain energies of the plate, Tp and Up, can be written as:

where Sp is the surface of the plate. The definition of the kinetic and strain energies of
the plate is particularly important in this dissertation, as the Rayleigh-Ritz method is
used to find an approximate solution of the differential system (the method is based
on the definition of an energy functional).
Orthotropic Kirchhoff plate
Equation (3.1) can be extended to a case of orthotropic plates, which have material
properties that differ along two orthogonal axes (in contrast to isotropic materials that
have the same properties in every direction). It is an important subset of anisotropic
plates. An example is a sheet metal formed by squeezing thick sections of metal
between heavy rollers. Its properties differ between the direction it was rolled in
and each of the two transverse directions. Sheet metal is commonly used for device
casings, which are of particular interest in this dissertation.
Assuming that the orthotropic plate material have axes of symmetry along x and
y directions, free vibrations of such plate are governed by the equation [145]:

. (3.7)
In (3.6)–(3.7) Dx, Dy and Dxy are orthotropic rigidities of the plate; Ex and Ey are
the Young moduli along the x and y directions, respectively; G is the shear modulus;
νx and νy are the Poisson’s ratios corresponding to x and y direction, respectively.
Four elastic constants Ex, Ey, G, νx are independent (while the isotropic plate model28 Noise-Controlling Casings
needs only two elastic constants to be defined). The coefficient νy can be determined
according to the following relation:
νx
Ex
=
νy
Ey
. (3.8)
It can be easily shown that if Ex = Ey and νx = νy, then Eq. (3.6) simplifies to (3.1).
It is also helpful to express the shear modulus G in terms of Young modulus E and
Poisson’s ratio ν as:
G =
E
2(1+ν)
. (3.9)
The kinetic energy of the orthotropic plate can be calculated according to Eq.

3.2.2 MINDLIN-REISSNER PLATE THEORY
The Mindlin-Reissner theory is an extension of Kirchhoff-Love theory that takes
into account rotary inertia and shear deformations of a plate [123]. It is obtained by
relaxing the Kirchhoff’s normality restriction and allowing for arbitrary but constant
rotation of transverse normals after deformation (it is an analogy of extension of
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to Timoshenko beam theory). The Mindlin-Reissner
theory is especially suitable for thick plates (i.e. with side to thickness ratios of the
order of 20 or less), since Kirchhoff-Love theory tends to underpredict deflections
and overpredict natural frequencies of such plates.
Isotropic Mindlin plate
Assuming that the functions Θx(x, y,t) and Θy(x, y,t) denote the rotations of a trans￾verse normal at position (x, y) in the x and y directions, respectively, free vibrations
the isotropic Mindlin plate are governed by the equations:

Orthotropic Mindlin plate
Assuming that the orthotropic Mindlin plate material has axes of symmetry along
x and y directions (analogously like in case of an orthotropic Kirchhoff plate), free

In Eqs. (3.14a)–(3.15), Gxy, Gxz and Gyz are the shear moduli in X−Y, X−Z and Y−Z
planes, respectively; κx and κy are the shear coefficients in the x and y directions,
respectively. It can be easily shown, similarly as in case of Kirchhoff plate, that if
given elastic constants corresponding to different directions become equal, then Eqs.
(3.14) simplifies to (3.11).

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Type of mounting of the plate edges affects strongly its behaviour (both natural fre￾quencies and mode shapes). Therefore, the boundary conditions should be always
carefully considered and appropriately modelled. In the literature, classical bound￾ary conditions have been thoroughly evaluated—simply-supported, fully-clamped or
free edges (e.g. in [86]). However, the actual boundary conditions of a real systeModelling of casings 31

are mostly not classical, but somewhere in between these conditions. In this disser￾tation, a general formulation of boundary conditions is employed—plate edges are
elastically restrained against both translation and rotation. Such mounting is repre￾sented by translational and rotational springs distributed linearly along plate edges
and defined by spring constants (it corresponds to a majority of practical application
of plates, including casing walls). It can be easily showed that the classical boundary
conditions of the plate can be obtained as limiting cases when the spring constants
approach their natural limits of zero or infinity (it is schematically presented in Table
3.1). Detailed considerations and derivation of elastic boundary conditions can be
found, e.g. in [145].
For the sake of brevity, necessary definitions of the boundary conditions are pre￾sented strictly for the purpose of application of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. In this
method, appropriate admissible functions, which satisfy the geometric boundary con￾ditions have to be chosen. These functions, in fact, determine, which geometry of the
plate is considered, and what boundary conditions are adopted (together with an ap￾propriate energy functional). To obtain the admissible functions, in this dissertation
products of characteristic orthogonal polynomials having the properties of Timo￾shenko beam functions are used (a rectangular plate is considered, hence there are
two beams assumed, corresponding to x and y directions). Therefore, equations rep￾resenting the boundary conditions are presented as for the Timoshenko beam, but in
fact, an edge of the beam represents homogeneous boundary conditions of a corre￾sponding edge of the plate.
To describe in such manner boundary conditions of four plate edges, eight spring
constants needs to be defined, as shown in Fig. 3.1. Translational spring constants
in the x direction at x = 0 and x = a, and in the y direction at y = 0 and y = b are
designated as ktx0, ktx1, kty0 and kty1, respectively. Rotational spring constants for
plate edges given in the same manner as above, are noted as krx0, krx1, kry0 and kry1,
respectively. With such notation, the boundary conditions for elastically restrained
edges are:

The casing walls considered in this dissertation are a subject of both passive and
active control. For this purpose, different kinds of element are bonded to the walls
surface—actuators, sensors, additional masses and ribs (stiffeners). They have strong
impact on the plate dynamical behaviour and have to be included in the mathematical
modelling, so the model remains valid after the elements are attached to the plate
surface.
In this section, mathematical modelling of additional masses and ribs bonded to
plate surface is considered. Presence of sensors and actuators is also modelle34 Noise-Controlling Casings
additional masses. Modelling of ribs includes the Engesser theory associated with
the consideration of torsion [46]. The idea is presented schematically in Fig. 3.2.
For the sake of brevity, mathematical modelling of additional elements is pre￾sented apart from differential system of the vibrating plate, defining only the ki￾netic and potential energy related to the elements (as they are most important for the
Rayleigh-Ritz method used to solve the differential system).
Energy related to additional masses
Elements represented by additional masses in this dissertation (actuators, sensors
and passive masses), can be for simplification (not limiting the analysis) considered
of small size, compared to the dimensions of the plate. Therefore, an influence of
strain caused by these elements bonded to the plate surface is neglected. Moreover,
assuming perfect bonding, the total energy introduced to the system by the additional
masses is considered to be the kinetic energy, expressed in the non-dimensional co￾ordinates (ξ ,η) as:

TOTAL ENERGY FUNCTIONAL
In the previous three sections of this chapter, the mathematical model of the vibrating
plate, elastic boundary conditions and additional elements bonded to the plate surface
is presented. To employ the Rayleigh-Ritz method, the total energy functional has
to be defined. Summarizing, the maximum strain energy of the system, U, can be
expressed as:
U = Up +Ub +Ur
, (3.28)
where Up, Ub and Ur are potential energies corresponding to plate strain, boundary
restrains and ribs, respectively.
The maximum kinetic energy of the system, T, can be defined as:
T = Tp +Tm +Tr
, (3.29)
where Tp, Tm and Tr are kinetic energies of the plate, additional masses and ribs,
respectively.38 Noise-Controlling Casings
THE RAYLEIGH-RITZ METHOD
The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to calculate approximate solution of the presented
differential system, obtaining natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system.
To utilize this method, the total energy of the system needs to be defined (which is
derived in the previous sections) and appropriate admissible functions, which satisfy
the geometric boundary conditions have to be chosen. More detailed information
regarding the Rayleigh-Ritz method is provided in [180].
For free vibration of the plate, the solution of w, Θx and Θy can be expressed in a
required form using a set of appropriate trial functions:
w(ξ ,η,t) =
N
∑
i=1
φi(ξ ,η)qi(t) = φ
Tq, (3.30a)
Θx(ξ ,η,t) =

Θy(ξ ,η,t) =
N
∑
i=1
ψy,i(ξ ,η)py,i(t) = ψ
T
y py
, (3.30c)
where q, px
and py
are a generalized plate displacement vector, generalized plate
rotations vectors in the x and y directions, respectively; φ, ψx
and ψy
are vectors,
which represent a set of time-invariant trial functions—in this dissertation, charac￾teristic orthogonal polynomials having the property of Timoshenko beam functions
are used; the superscript T denotes the transpose. All of mentioned vectors are of
dimension (N ×1). The procedure for forming orthogonal polynomial trial functions
for Mindlin plates is described in details in [70].
Energy definition
Utilizing (3.30), the total potential and kinetic energies defined in (3.28) and (3.29)
can also be written as functions of generalized plate displacement and rotations vec￾tors q, px
, py
, mass matrix M of dimension (3N × 3N) and stiffness matrix K of
dimension (3N ×3N) :

Stiffness matrix
The overall stiffness matrix K is calculated as a sum of stiffness matrices related to
different energy components:
K = Kp +Kb +Kr
, (3.33)
where Kp, Kb and Kr correspond to strain energy of the plate, potential energy stored
in boundary restrains and potential energy related to ribs mounted on the plate sur￾face, respectively.

where 0N,N denotes a zero matrix of dimension (N ×N). Detailed definitions of sub￾matrices used in (3.34) are given in Appendix A for convenience of the reader. They,
in fact, can be obtained for the considered problem based on the literature [90], but
the derivation is nontrivial and combines more components.
Mass matrix
The overall mass matrix M is calculated similarly to the stiffness matrix—as a sum
of matrices related to different energy components:
M = Mp +Mm +Mr
, (3.35)
where Mp, Mm and Mr correspond to kinetic energy of the plate, kinetic energy of
additional masses and kinetic energy related to ribs, respectively.

Detailed definitions of submatrices used in (3.36) are given in Appendix B. Simi￾larly, as in case of Appendix A, they could be obtained using [131], but presented
definitions are given in a convenient form consistent with previous derivations.
Equation of the vibrating structure and a harmonic solution

the second kind, the equation of a vibrating structure can be obtained as:

where Q is the vector of generalized forces of dimension (3N × 1). In this disser￾tation, inertial actuators are considered. Hence, for the purpose of positioning, their
action can be simplified and taken into account as a force acting on a point. There￾fore, the control vector u of dimension (Na ×1) can be defined as:
u = [F1,F2,...,FNa

T

where Fi
is a force generated by a ith actuator. Then, the vector of generalized forces

The harmonic solution to (3.37) gives the eigenvector matrix Φ of dimension

Taking advantage of the orthonormality of eigenvectors in matrix Φ, the modal mass
matrix becomes a unit matrix I(3N) of dimension (3N × 3N) and the corresponding
modal stiffness matrix becomes a diagonal matrix Ω of (3N) eigenvalues ω

Then, by substituting (3.42) and (3.43) to (3.40), it gives:

For a better reference to a real system behaviour this equation is extended to the
following one:

where Ξv˙ is a term introduced to include the damping in the system, and Ξ is a

. (3.46)
In (3.46) the damping ratios, 0 < ξd,i < 1, are calculated with use of the thermoelastic
damping model for elastic plates described in details in [132]. The damping mecha￾nism could be also included at the beginning of the modelling in the form of complex
bending rigidities. However, it would substantially complicate the derivation. Intro￾ducing it at this point preserves the brevity of derivation and leads to equivalent
solution. Such approach was also used in [88].Modelling of casings 41

ACOUSTIC RADIATION
An estimate of the radiated acoustic power corresponding to the i-th vibration mode
of the plate under consideration is derived in this subsection. In the scenario con￾sidered, it is assumed that the plate is placed in an infinite rigid baffle. Adopting an
appropriate Green’s function, derived in [146], the modal sound pressure amplitude
pi(x, y,z) can be calculated as

pi(x, y,z) is the root mean square of pi(x, y,z). In theoreti￾cal analyses the surface Se is often taken to be a surface directly adjacent to the plate.
However, to allow for experimental validation of the model, the surface Se will be
assumed to be a limited plane parallel to the plate and at a distance greater than zero.
This may slightly modify the overall estimate of the modal acoustic power, but this
effect is negligible for the objective of frequency response shaping.
CONTROLLABILITY AND OBSERVABILITY
Controllability and observability similarly as stability are fundamental concepts in
mathematical control theory [7, 71, 72, 75]. These are qualitative properties of dy￾namical control systems and are of particular importance in control theory. System￾atic study of controllability and observability was started at the beginning of sixties
in the last century, when the theory of controllability and observability based mainly
on the description in the form of state space for both time-invariant and time-varying
different types of linear control and nonlinear control systems was worked out.Modelling of casings 43
Roughly speaking, controllability generally means, that it is possible to steer dy￾namical control system from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary final state us￾ing the set of admissible controls. On the other side, observability means, that it is
possible to compute uniquely state of the control system knowing initial control and
output signal in a given period of time.
It should be mentioned, that in the literature there are many different definitions
of controllability and observability, which strongly depend on one hand on a class of
dynamical control systems and on the other hand on the form of admissible controls
(see, e.g. [71, 72, 75, 153] for more details).
Controllability and observability problems for different types of dynamical sys￾tems require the application of numerous mathematical concepts and methods taken
directly from differential geometry, functional analysis, topology, matrix analysis
and theory of ordinary and partial differential equations and theory of difference
equations. Mainly state-space models of dynamical systems are used, which provide
a robust and universal method for studying controllability and observability of var￾ious classes of systems. There are various important relationships between control￾lability, observability, stability and stabilizability of linear both finite-dimensional
and infinite-dimensional control systems. It should be pointed out, that in finite di￾mensional case controllability and observability are also strongly related with the
theory of realization, minimal realization and canonical forms. For linear, finite di￾mensional, time-invariant control systems we have many canonical forms such as
for example Kalman canonical form, Jordan canonical form or Luenberger canon￾ical form. It should be mentioned, that for many mainly linear dynamical systems
there exist a formal duality between the concepts of controllability and observabil￾ity. Moreover, controllability is strongly connected with minimum energy control
problem for many classes of linear finite dimensional, infinite dimensional dynam￾ical systems, and delayed systems both deterministic and stochastic [71, 72, 75].
For controllable dynamical system there exist generally many different admissible
controls, which steer the system from a given initial state to the final desired state
at given final time. Therefore, we may look for the admissible control, which is an
optimal in the sense of the quadratic performance index representing energy of con￾trol. The admissible control, which minimizes the performance index is called the
minimum energy control. For infinite-dimensional dynamical systems we may intro￾duce two general kinds of controllability, i.e. approximate (weak) controllability and
exact (strong) controllability [76, 77]. However, it should be mentioned, that in the
case when the semigroup associated with the dynamical system is compact or the
control operator is compact, then dynamical system is never exactly controllable in
infinite-dimensional state space.
In real control systems admissible controls are always constrained. Therefore, it
is very important to verify constrained controllability of dynamical systems. Con￾strained controllability of linear both continuous-time or discrete-time control sys￾tems was considered in the series of papers [65, 66, 73, 74]. Moreover, constrained
controllability of nonlinear or semilinear both continuous-time or discrete-time con￾trol systems was considered in the papers [73, 74, 152].44 Noise-Controlling Casings
Controllability and observability concepts have many important applications not
only in control theory and systems theory, but also in many engineering areas includ￾ing vibration and acoustic control.
Controllability and observability measures for the plate
Taking advantage of the fact that the model is expressed in the state-space form,
classical methods can be used to describe the controllability and observability of
the system [75]. The method presented in this section represents the energy-based
approach, and it is used later in the optimization process for active control scenarios.
The control energy required to reach the desired state xT1
at time t = T1, assuming
the optimal solution, can be expressed as:
Ec =
Z
T1
0
u
T
(t)u(t)dt = (e
AT1 x0 −xT1
)
TW−1
(T1)(e
AT1 x0 −xT1
), (3.58)
where W(T1) is the controllability Gramian matrix of dimension (6N ×6N). To min￾imize control required energy with respect to the actuators locations, a measure of
the Gramian matrix should be maximized. It has been shown in the literature that
instead of using W(T1), a steady state controllability Gramian matrix, Wc, can be
used for stable systems, when time tends to infinity [6].
Analogously, the output energy received by the sensors, when the system starts in
initial state x0 and is not controlled, can be written as:
Eo =
Z∞
0
y
T
(t)y(t)dt = x

0Wox0, (3.59)
where Wo is the observability Gramian matrix of dimension (6N×6N). To maximize
output energy with respect to the sensors locations, again a measure of the Gramian
matrix should be maximized.
Both controllability and observability Gramian matrices can be calculated by
solving the Lyapunov equations:
AWc +WcA
T +BBT = 0. (3.60a)
A
TWo +WoA+C
TC = 0. (3.60b)
The controllability and observability Gramian matrices are convenient to use, be￾cause if the (2i)th value at the diagonal of the matrix, corresponding to the ith eigen￾mode is small, the eigenmode is difficult to control (it can be regulated only if a large
control energy is available) or is not observable well, respectively. Such information
can be an important criterion in the optimization process of actuators and sensors
placement.
Formally, controllability and observability are dichotomous properties, but ”con￾trollable” and ”observable” does not say how high control effort is needed to reach
the final state and how much energy is received by the sensors.Modelling of casings 45
3.3 ANALYTICAL MODELLING OF THE WHOLE CASING
This section is devoted to the modelling study of the whole active casing. To con￾struct the model of the casing an approach based on the decomposition of the system
under discussion to the simpler subsystems is applied. Following this philosophy
the process of model construction consists in combining the results of performing
consecutive analysis and synthesis steps. The main idea behind first stage of model
synthesis is to perform the analysis which is aimed at singling out such subsystems
in the system under discussion that are simpler to analyse from the synthesis of math￾ematical model perspective. Then, in the next step the synthesis is performed to for￾mulate mathematical models for all singled out in previous step subsystems. Next,
once again the analysis is conducted to identify interactions between the subsystems.
Finally, in the next synthesis step models of identified interactions are formulated.
Modelled interactions describe cross-couplings that occur between the subsystems.
Consequently, incorporating identified interactions, models of the subsystems are
coupled resulting in formulation of a complete model of the whole active casing. In
this context, to synthesize the model of the whole casing the following actions are
performed:
• subsystems of the acoustic fields in appropriate regions of active casing are
singled out and modelled,
• subsystems of vibrating flexible casing walls/panels are singled out and
modelled and then,
• fluid-structure and structure-structure (in case of lightweight casing) inter￾actions between singled out subsystems are identified and modelled.
In the synthesis of mathematical model of the whole casing the philosophy assuming
that modelling aims at simplification, rather than construction of complex models
of complex systems is applied [161]. This can be observed in Section 3.3.1 where
many simplifying assumptions are formulated. In this context the best model is the
simplest one which is still complex enough to help us understand a system and to
solve the problem. Consecutive sections start with the short description of notation
used and simplifying assumptions under which corresponding model is synthesized.
Given assumptions determine the model usability range. What is important and has
to be pointed out, all assumptions applied to derive the models are chosen so as
to relate the model to the realities of the utility. For this reason, the dynamics of
flexible casing walls is described using Kirchhoff–Love plate theory that allows for
sufficient precision of the model and reduction of model complexity compared to
Mindlin-Reissner plate theory. The resulting partial differential equations describ￾ing walls’ panels motion are of fourth order in space variables and second order in
time. The acoustic fields in appropriate regions of active casing are described by the
acoustic wave equations. Consequently, derived models have a structure of a system
of coupled higher order partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs describing the
model are accompanied by appropriate system of boundary conditions that reflects
aspects related with mechanical construction of the casing. The model takes into ac￾count the dynamic behaviour of each casing wall/panel, coupled with the acoustic46 Noise-Controlling Casings
fields in the singled out regions of active casing. In this context, the model derived
incorporates fluid-structure interactions of both vibroacoustic and acoustic-vibration
character.
Taking into account the form of the models derived, active casing is treated as
a sophisticated vibroacoustic system. The model synthesis is based on methods of
continuum mechanics and acoustics, and the theory of partial differential equations.
3.3.1 SINGLE-PANEL RIGID CASING
As described in Section 2.2, the modelling begins with the casing which is assumed
to be of a rectangular parallelepiped shape consisting of single-panel thin flexible
walls mounted to a rigid frame (Fig. 2.1). The walls are assumed to be able to radi￾ate sound when made to vibrate. Inside the casing there is an acoustic field due to
enclosed certain source of noise (e.g. machine, device, another appliance, etc.).
For the purpose of further analysis an orthogonal system of coordinates is intro￾duced with the origin at one of vertices of the casing (Fig. 3.4).
Axes directions are assumed to form a right-handed coordinate system. Lengths of
casing sides are assumed to be equal to lx, ly, lz
, respectively. To make the exposition
of results as clear as possible each casing wall is assigned a unique number. The
wall lying in the Z–Y plane has number “1”, and the parallel wall intersecting the
X-axis at the point x = lx has number “2”. In turn, the wall lying in the X–Z plane has
number “3”, and the parallel wall intersecting Y-axis at the point y = ly has number
“4”. Finally, the wall lying in the X–Y plane has number “5” and the parallel wall
intersecting Z-axis at the point z = lz has number “6” (Fig. 3.4).

The model is synthesized under the following most significant simplifying assump￾tions:
A1. The thickness of the wall (hi (i = 1,2,...,6)) is small compared to its
lateral dimensions, i.e. hi  lx (i = 3,4,5,6), hi  ly (i = 1,2,5,6),
hi  lz (i = 1,2,3,4). In practice the wall is considered to be thin, when
the ratio of its thickness to the smaller lateral dimension is less than 1
20 .
A2. Vibration-induced deformations are only in the direction of the wall normal
vector.
A3. The middle plane of the wall does not undergo an in-plane deformation.
A4. The influence of a transverse shear deformation is neglected.
A5. The transverse normal strain under transverse loading can be neglected.
A6. Size and weight of actuators are negligible compared to wall size and
weight.
A7. Air density and ambient temperature are constant.
A8. Normal displacements of the walls are positive in the direction of axes X,
Y, Z, respectively.
A9. Walls of the casing are fasten in a rigid frame.
A10. Casing walls are assumed to interact with the acoustic field enclosed inside
the casing only. The interactions with acoustic field outside the casing are
neglected since taking into account active casing operation conditions the
level of acoustic pressure inside the casing is much greater then outside.
To derive a model of the casing the vibroacoustic system under discussion is split
into simpler subsystems. Then, mathematical models for all subsystems are formu￾lated. Finally, by incorporating interactions between the subsystems, their models
are interconnected to obtain a complete model of the overall active casing. In the
adopted approach the following most important physical phenomena are taken into
account:
• The acoustic field in the fluid enclosed within the casing due to primary
noise source operation and actuator-forced vibration of casing walls.
• The dynamics of casing walls excited both acoustically by the enclosed
fluid, and mechanically by the actuators.
• Fluid-structure interactions—the interaction between casing walls and fluid
enclosed within the casing.48 Noise-Controlling Casings
• The influence of fluid loading effect on casing walls vibration.
Model synthesis begins with the analysis of casing walls dynamics.
Dynamics of casing walls excited by the enclosed fluid and exciters
In general, the active casing consists of six light-weight single-panel thin flexible
walls that are mounted in a frame which is assumed to be rigid, what justifies ne￾glecting structural interactions between walls. Point-operating exciters are bonded
to all walls, except the wall at the bottom of the casing (numbered as the 5th wall).
Masses of the exciters and their size are neglected, what is justified as they are much
smaller than masses and areas of corresponding walls.
Assuming classical plate theory for thin plates (rotary inertia and shear strain are
then neglected), the equation of transverse motion of thin isotropic walls of active
casing is given by [145]:

Remark 3.3 (The type of boundary conditions for walls)
The edges of the walls are considered to be rigidly supported and elastically re￾strained against rotation. The degree of restraint against rotation on the edges of the
ith wall is determined by the value of the boundary restraint coefficients ξi ∈ h0,∞),
i=1,2,. . . ,6. This kind of boundary conditions corresponds to an imperfect nature
of fastening wall edges to the rigid frame. If ξ i = 0 then assumed boundary condi￾tions coincide with hinged or simply supported edges when the deflection and normal
bending moment resultant on the wall edges are equal to zero. On the other hand, if
ξ i→ ∞, the assumed boundary conditions simplify to fully clamped (fixed or built-in)
edges. In this case the deflection and slope normal to the edges are equal to zero.50 Noise-Controlling Casings
Assuming that the wall edges are perfectly fastened upon the rigid frame of the active
casing the fully clamped boundary conditions are obtained. Considering elastically
restrained against rotation boundary conditions makes it possible to track the be￾haviour of the system in case of both perfect and imperfect fastening of wall edges
by changing the value of boundary restraint coefficients ξ i
, i=1,2,. . . ,6.
Since Eq. (3.65) is of second order with respect to time, two initial conditions are
formulated:

Acoustic field within the fluid enclosed in the casing

where functions p0 (x, y,z) and p1 (x, y,z) are assumed to be given. Function
p0 (x, y,z) describes the initial distribution of acoustic pressure and p1 (x, y,z) rep￾resents the initial distribution of the rate of change of acoustic pressure in the fluid
enclosed within the casing.
Interactions between the casing walls and the fluid enclosed within the
casing
There are many systems of practical interest, in which a structure is in contact with
the fluid contained within a finite volume defined by the structure physical bound￾aries.
It should be emphasized that acoustic field propagating in the fluid contained
within the casing stimulates the vibrations of the casing walls. Any solid structure
exposed to the sound field in a contiguous fluid responds to some degree to the fluc￾tuating pressure acting at the interface between the two media. The fluid pressure
on the surface of casing walls is the agent by which the fluid influences the struc￾tural motion of the casing walls. This phenomenon was incorporated into the model
by adding term p(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) in the right-hand side of Eq. (3.65) describing transverse
motion of casing walls. It is described by the function f (η1i
,η2i
,t) that appears in the
right-hand side of Eq. (3.65) and is given by (3.68). The term p(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) represents a
distributed transverse force per unit area acting on the walls surface and stimulating
walls vibrations due to the acoustic field in the fluid enclosed within the casing while
the terms ui(
◦
,
◦
,t),i = 1,2,...,6 represent the forces generated by point actuators
bonded to wall surface.
On the other hand, casing walls that can be made to vibrate by actuators become
sources of sound, and the sound emitted by each wall contributes to the acoustic
field in the fluid enclosed within the casing. The normal surface accelerations of the
casing walls are the agents by which the casing structure influence the enclosed fluid
field. This phenomenon is incorporated into the model by the boundary conditions
for acoustic wave equation (3.65).
In order to take into account how the casing structure influences the enclosed
fluid field, the acoustic wave equation (3.78) should be solved subject to boundary
conditions imposed by the vibrating surface of casing walls of the following form:

Remark 3.4 (Interactions in the model)
The model proposed, on the one hand, reflects the influence of casing structure on
the enclosed fluid field. There are fluid-structure interactions of vibroacoustic nature
that are modelled by the boundary conditions (3.82) for the acoustic wave equation
(3.78). On the other hand, model derived reflects the influence of the fluid field on the
structural vibrations of the casing structure. There are fluid-structure interactions of
acoustic-vibration character that are modelled by f (η1i
,η2i
,t) given by (3.68).
3.3.2 DOUBLE-PANEL RIGID CASING
A vibroacoustic system considered in this section can be treated as a direct extension
of that analysed in Section 3.3.1. As previously, it is assumed to be a rectangular
parallelepiped casing but now double-panel thin flexible walls mounted to a rigid
frame are considered (Fig. 3.5).
In general, each panel can be made of a different material. Moreover, each cavity
between the walls’ panels can be filled with a different fluid. The panels of the walls
are assumed to be able to radiate sound when forced to vibrate. Inside the casing there
is an acoustic field due to enclosed certain source of noise (e.g. machine, device,
another appliance, etc.).
For the purpose of further analysis an orthogonal system of coordinates is intro￾duced with the origin at one of vertices of the casing (Fig. 3.5). Axes directions are
assumed to form a right-handed coordinate system. Lengths of panels’ sides are as￾sumed to be equal to lx, ly, lz along x, y and z axes, respectively. The distance between
the panels in the ith wall is denoted by di(i = 1,2,...,6) (Fig. 3.6). To make the ex￾position of results as clear as possible each casing wall is assigned a unique number
(Fig. 3.5). The wall lying in the Z–Y plane has number “1” and its panels denoted by
numbers “1” and “2” intersect the X-axis at the points x = 0 and x = d1, respectively.
The parallel wall has number “2” and its panels denoted by numbers “2” and “1” in￾tersect the X-axis at the points x = lx+2a – d2 and x = lx+2a, respectively (Fig. 3.6).
In turn, the wall lying in the X–Z plane has number “3” and its panels denoted by
numbers “1” and “2” intersect the Y-axis at the points y = 0 and y = d3, respectively.
The parallel wall has number “4” and its panels denoted by numbers “2” and “1” in￾tersect the Y-axis at the points y = ly+2a – d4 and y = ly+2a, respectively (Fig. 3.6).
Finally, the wall lying in the X–Y plane has number “5” and its panels denoted by
numbers “1” and “2” intersect the Z-axis at the points z = 0 and z = d5, respectively.
The parallel wall has number “6” and its panels denoted by numbers “2” and “1”
intersect the Y-axis at the points z = lz+2a – d6 and z = lz+2a, respectively (Fig. 3.6).Modelling of casings 53

Two-dimensional domains Ωi j (i = 1,3,5, j = i+1) refer to surfaces of panels in

The small deflection theory of thin plates (classical plate theory) is used to de￾scribe the motion of casing walls panels [86, 156]. The procedure of model synthesis
takes into account following most significant simplifying assumptions:
A1. The thickness of the panel is small compared to its lateral dimen￾sions, i.e. hi j  lx (i = 3,4,5,6), hi j  ly (i = 1,2,5,6), hi j  lz
(i = 1,2,3,4) (j = 1,2). In practice the panel is considered to be thin, when
the ratio of its thickness to the smaller lateral dimension is less than 1
20 .
A2. Vibration-induced deformations are only in the direction of the wall normal
vector.
A3. The middle plane of the wall does not undergo an in-plane deformation.
A4. The influence of a transverse shear deformation is neglected.
A5. The transverse normal strain under transverse loading can be neglected.
A6. Size and weight of actuators and sensors are negligible compared to panels
size and weight.
A7. Air density and ambient temperature are constant.
A8. Normal displacements of the walls panels are positive in the direction of
axes X, Y, Z, respectively.
A9. Walls of the casing are fasten in a rigid frame.
A10. Casing walls panels are assumed to interact with the acoustic field in the
fluid enclosed inside the casing, the acoustic fields in the fluids enclosed in￾side walls cavities and the acoustic field in the fluid surrounding the casing
from the outside.
Remark 3.5 (Assumptions for model synthesis)
As can be seen, the assumptions used to derive the double-panel casing model are
basically similar to those adopted for the single-panel casing, except for the as￾sumption A10. It can be observed that in contrast to Section 3.3.1 where the modelModelling of casings 55

for single-panel casing is derived in the current section the interactions with acous￾tic field in the fluid surrounding the casing from the outside are incorporated into
the model (assumption A10). It complicates the model obviously but gives the op￾portunity to study the effect of sound insulation what is the essential purpose of the
active casing. Additionally, by incorporating this phenomenon the model derived is
expected to be more accurate.
In the adopted construction solution a double-panel casing is assumed. It means
that each casing wall consists of two thin flexible panels: the internal one and the
external one. The internal panel will be referred to as the incident panel (index j=2)
since it accepts the incoming noise from the noise source located in the interior of
the active casing. On the other hand, the external panel will be referred to as the
radiating panel (index j=1) since it radiates the sound to the exterior of the active
casing.56 Noise-Controlling Casings
To derive a model of the casing the vibroacoustic system under discussion is split
into simpler subsystems. Then, mathematical models for all subsystems are formu￾lated. Finally, by incorporating interactions between the subsystems, their models
are interconnected to obtain a complete model of the overall active casing. In the
adopted approach the following most important physical phenomena are taken into
account (Fig. 3.7):
• acoustic field in the fluid enclosed within the casing due to primary noise
source operation and actuator-forced vibration of casing walls panels.
• dynamics of casing double-panel walls excited both acoustically by the en￾closed fluids, and mechanically by the actuators.
• fluid-structure interactions including:
◦ interactions between incident panels and the acoustic field in the fluid
enclosed in the interior of the casing.
◦ interactions between casing walls’ panels and the acoustic field in the
fluids enclosed in the cavities between panels of walls,
◦ interactions between casing radiating panels and the acoustic field in
fluid surrounding the casing from the outside.
• influence of the fluid loading effect on walls’ panels vibration.
• influence of point-operating actuators on walls’ panels vibration.
Model synthesis begins with the analysis of double-panel walls dynamics.
Dynamics of double panel casing walls excited by the acoustic fields and
actuators
In general, the active casing consists of six light-weight thin flexible double-panel
walls that are mounted in a rigid frame, what justifies neglecting structural interac￾tions between walls. Point-operating actuators (exciters) are bonded to all walls’ pan￾els, except panels of the wall at the bottom of the casing (numbered as the 5th wall),
i.e. K5 j = 0 (j = 1,2). Masses of the actuators and sensors as well as their size are
neglected, what is justified as they can be much smaller compared to the masses and
size of corresponding walls panels. If heavier actuators are used, e.g. electrodynamic
ones, it can be necessary to include their mass, what will complicate the model fur￾ther.
Each wall of the active casing is considered as a composite system consisting of
two light-weight thin flexible panels and the cavity between its panels that is filled
with a homogeneous, viscous, isotropic and compressible fluid.
To describe the behaviour of each wall it is necessary to model the motion of
its panels and the acoustic field in the fluid contained within the cavity between its
panels. Moreover, the model has to incorporate the mutual interactions between the
wall components as well as their interactions with acoustic field enclosed within
the interior of the active casing. Therefore, behaviour of ith wall (i = 1,2,...,6), is
described by the following system of three coupled second order with respect to time
partial differential equations:Modelling of casings 57

Assuming classical plate theory for thin plates (rotary inertia and shear strain are
then neglected), Eqs. (3.95) and (3.97) describe the transverse motion of the elastic
thin isotropic panels of ith wall, which:
• for i = 1,3,5 occupy the η1i − η2i plane and the plane that is parallel to
η1i −η2i plane intersecting η3i axis at the point η3i = di
, respectively, in the
reference and stress-free state,

Remark 3.6 (The type of boundary conditions for walls panels)
Once again, the edges of the walls panels are considered to be rigidly supported and
elastically restrained against rotation. The degree of restraint against rotation on
the edges of the jth panel of the ith wall is determined by the value of the boundary
restraint coefficients ξi jh0,∞), i=1,2,. . . ,6, j=1,2. See Remark 3.3 for more com￾ments and details related to the explanation of the choice of the boundary conditions
type. Generally speaking, considering elastically restrained against rotation bound￾ary conditions makes it possible to track the behaviour of the system in case of both
perfect (ξ ij→ ∞, fully clamped boundary conditions) and imperfect (ξ ij—nonzero
finite) fastening of panels edges by changing the value of boundary restraint coeffi￾cients ξi jh0,∞), i=1,2,. . . ,6, j=1,2.
Boundary conditions for Eq. (3.96) so for the acoustic field inside the cavity be￾tween incident and radiating panels of the ith wall describe interactions in system
under discussion and they will be discussed in detail later in the section devoted to
fluid-structure interactions.
Since Eqs. (3.95) and (3.97) are second order with respect to time, two initial
conditions are formulated for each panel:

area. It is assumed that the compressible fluid contained within the active casing
is excited by acoustic waves generated by Ks sources of primary noise of strengths
qk (k = 1,2,...,Ks).
Since Eq. (3.118) is second order with respect to time, two initial conditions are
formulated:

Fluid-structure interactions in the system
It should be emphasized that acoustic fields propagating in the fluids contained
within the walls cavities and casing interior as well as in the fluid in the casing exte￾rior stimulate the vibrations of the casing walls panels. Any solid structure exposed
to the sound field in a continuous fluid responds to some degree to the fluctuating
pressure acting at the interface between the two media. The fluids pressures on the
surface of casing panels are the agents by which the fluids influence the structural
motion of the casing panels. This type of fluid-structure interaction is referred to as
an interaction of acoustic-vibration character. This phenomenon was incorporated
into the model by adding term depending on p(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t), pi(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) (i = 1,2,...,6)
and ps (
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t), in the right-hand side of Eqs. (3.95) and (3.97) describing trans￾verse motion of casing panels. They are described by the functions f1i(η1i
,η2i
,t)
and f2i(η1i
,η2i
,t), given by (3.100) and (3.101) being the stimuli (forcing terms)
for Eqs. (3.95) and (3.97). The terms pi(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) (i = 1,2,...,6) ps (
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) and
p(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) represent a distributed transverse force per unit area acting on the corre￾sponding panels surface and stimulating panels vibrations due to the acoustic fields
in the fluids enclosed within the walls cavities and interior of the active casing as well
as in the fluid in the casing exterior, respectively. The sign of particular component in
the corresponding term depends on direction of the field force that a fluid exerts on
the surface of panels being the result of positive increase in pressure of appropriate
fluid.64 Noise-Controlling Casings
On the other hand, casing walls panels that can be made to vibrate by actuators
become sources of sound, and the sound emitted by each panel contributes to the
acoustic fields in all fluids being in direct contact with active casing, i.e.:
• acoustic field in the fluid enclosed in the interior of the active casing,
• acoustic fields in the fluids enclosed in the interiors of walls cavities of the
active casing,
• acoustic field in the fluid surrounding the active casing from the exterior.
This type of fluid-structure interaction is referred to as an interaction of vibro￾acoustic character. The normal surface accelerations of the casing panels are the
agents by which the casing structure influence the acoustic fields in the fluids be￾ing in contact with the casing structure. The influence of walls panels motion on the
acoustic fields in the fluids enclosed within the walls cavities is incorporated into the
model by the boundary conditions for acoustic wave Eqs. (3.96) (i = 1,2,...,6) that
take the following form:

There are fluid-structure interactions of vibroacoustic character that are modelled by
boundary conditions (3.124), (3.125), (3.127) and (3.128) for acoustic wave equa￾tions (3.96), (3.118) and (3.121), respectively. On the other hand, it reflects the in￾fluence of considered fluids fields on the structural vibration of the casing structure.
There are fluid-structure interactions of acoustic-vibration character that are mod￾elled by functions f1i(η1i
,η2i
,t) and f2i(η1i
,η2i
,t) given by (3.100) and (3.101),
respectively.
Remark 3.8 (Models complexity)
It should be emphasized that although the models of both types of casings are de￾scribed by the partial differential equations of the same type the double-panel casing
model turns out to be much more complicated compared to the single-panel casing66 Noise-Controlling Casings
model. The single-panel casing model is described by the system of 7 coupled par￾tial differential equations of higher orders while the double-panel casing model is
described by the system of 20 coupled partial differential equations of higher orders.
This is the direct consequence of the fact that the number of subsystems that has been
singled out in case of double-panel casing for the purpose of model synthesis is much
greater compared to single-panel casing.
3.3.3 LIGHTWEIGHT CASING
In this section so called lightweight casing is considered (Fig 2.6). As in Section
3.3.1, casing is assumed to be of a rectangular parallelepiped shape consisting of
single-panel thin flexible walls. However, in contrast to single-panel rigid casing it
is assumed that the flexible walls are interconnected directly to each other without
rigid frame forming self-supporting construction (Fig 2.6).
The walls are assumed to be able to radiate sound when made to vibrate. Inside the
casing there is an acoustic field due to enclosed certain source of noise (e.g. machine,
device, another appliance, etc.).
The notation used within this section (system of coordinates, walls notation, as￾sumptions, etc.) is generally the same as in Section 3.3.1 (Fig. 3.4).
To derive a model of the lightweight casing the vibroacoustic system under discus￾sion is split into simpler subsystems. Then, mathematical models for all subsystems
are formulated. Finally, by incorporating interactions between the subsystems, their
models are interconnected to obtain a complete model of the overall active casing.
In the adopted approach the following most important physical phenomena are taken
into account:
• acoustic field in the fluid enclosed within the casing due to primary noise
source operation and actuator-forced vibration of casing walls.
• dynamics of casing single-panel walls excited both acoustically by the en￾closed and surrounding fluids, and mechanically by the actuators.
• fluid-structure interactions including:
◦ interactions between casing walls and the acoustic field in the fluid en￾closed in the interior of the casing.
◦ interactions between casing walls and the acoustic field in fluid sur￾rounding the casing from the outside.
• structure-structure interactions including structural interactions between
directly adjacent walls of the casing.
• influence of the fluid loading effect on walls’ vibration.
• influence of point operating actuators on walls’ vibration.
Model synthesis begins with the analysis of single-panel walls dynamics.
Dynamics of walls excited by the acoustic fields and actuators
In general, the active casing consists of six light-weight thin flexible single-panel
walls that are connected directly to each other forming self-supporting construction.Modelling of casings 67
Therefore, in the system under discussion structural interactions between directly
adjacent walls cannot be neglected. In the case the adjacent walls significantly influ￾ence one another. Point-operating actuators (exciters) are bonded to all walls, except
the wall at the bottom of the casing (numbered as the 5th wall), i.e. K5 = 0. Masses
of the actuators and sensors as well as their size are neglected, what is justified as
they can be much smaller compared to the masses and size of corresponding walls.
If heavier actuators are used, e.g. electrodynamic ones, it can be necessary to include
their mass, what will complicate the model further.
To describe the behaviour of each wall basically it is necessary to model its mo￾tion. Moreover, the model has to incorporate the structural interactions between the
adjacent walls as well as their interactions with acoustic field enclosed within the
interior of the casing and surrounding the casing from the exterior. As it was afore￾mentioned, in contrast to rigid casings considered in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 in case
of lightweight casing adjacent walls significantly influence one another. To incor￾porate this phenomenon into the model, the motions of each casing wall in three
mutually orthogonal directions, i.e., transverse and in-plane longitudinal and shear
motion have to be taken into account. Therefore, the dynamics of each wall has to
be described by the system of three coupled second order with respect to time partial
differential equations.
To make the exposition as concise as possible the description of two selected ad￾jacent walls is presented. Consider two adjacent walls denoted by 2 and 5 (Fig. 3.9).
The dynamics of wall 5 is described by the following system of coupled partial dif￾ferential equations:

Remark 3.9 (Dependence of in-plane motions)
It should be pointed out the that in-plane motions of wall strongly dependent one
another. It means that longitudinal motion depends on shear motion and vice versa.
Actually the solution of Eq. (3.131), w5y (x, y,t), say longitudinal displacement ap￾pears in the right-hand side of Eq. (3.130), so it can be treated as a stimulus for
equation describing shear motion. On the other hand, the solution of Eq. (3.130),
w5x (x, y,t), say shear displacement appears in the right-hand side of Eq. (3.131), so
it can be treated as a stimulus for equation describing longitudinal motion.
Equations (3.129) and (3.132) describe flexural (transverse) vibrations while
Eqs. (3.130), (3.131) and (3.133), (3.134) (longitudinal and shear) in-plane vibra￾tions of abutting walls 5 and 2, respectively. Functions wi
(η1i
,η2i) describe trans￾verse displacements while win (η1i
,η2i) (i = 1,2...,6,n = x, y,z) describe in-plane
(longitudinal and shear) displacements in n-direction of the ith wall from the refer￾ence and stress-free state.

The right-hand side of Eq. (3.140) represents a rate of change of mass flux per unit

is excited by acoustic waves generated by Ks sources of primary noise of strengths

formulated:

Interactions in the system
Taking into account mechanical construction of the lightweight casing two basic type
of interactions can be distinguished in the system:
• fluid-structure interactions that describes how the fluids being in a direct
contact with mechanical structure of the casing interact each other. They
can be divided into:
◦ interactions of vibroacoustic character and,
◦ interactions of acoustic-vibration character.
• structure-structure interactions that describe how abutting walls interact
one another at the wall/wall junction.
Fluid-structure interactions
The fluids pressures on the surface of casing walls are the agents by which the flu￾ids influence the structural motion of the casing walls. This type of fluid-structure
interaction is referred to as an interaction of acoustic-vibration character. This phe￾nomenon was incorporated into the model by adding term depending on p(
◦

and ps (
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t), in the right-hand side of Eqs. (3.129) and (3.132) describing trans￾verse motion of casing walls. They are the stimuli (forcing term) for Eqs. (3.129)
and (3.132). The terms ps (
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) and p(
◦
,
◦
,
◦
,t) represent a distributed transverse72 Noise-Controlling Casings
force per unit area acting on the corresponding walls surface and stimulating walls
vibrations due to the acoustic fields in the fluids enclosed within the interior of the
active casing as well as in the fluid in the casing exterior, respectively. The sign of
particular component in the corresponding term depends on direction of the field
force that a fluid exerts on the surface of walls being the result of positive increase in
pressure of appropriate fluid.
On the other hand, casing walls that can be made to vibrate by actuators become
sources of sound, and the sound emitted by each wall contributes to the acoustic
fields in all fluids being in direct contact with active casing, i.e.:
• acoustic field in the fluid enclosed in the interior of the active casing,
• acoustic field in the fluid surrounding the active casing from the exterior.
This type of fluid-structure interaction is referred to as an interaction of vibro￾acoustic character. The normal surface accelerations of the casing walls are the
agents by which the casing structure influence the acoustic fields in the fluids being
in contact with the casing structure. The influence of walls motion on the acoustic
fields in the fluids enclosed within the interior of the casing and surrounding the cas￾ing from the exterior is incorporated into the model by the boundary conditions for
acoustic wave Eqs. (3.140) and (3.142). The influence of walls motion on the acous￾tic field in the fluid enclosed in the interior of the active casing is incorporated into
the model by the nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the nonhomo￾geneous acoustic wave equation (3.140):

Structure-structure interactions
In contrast to rigid casings, in case of lightweight casing that forms a self-supporting
structure by direct connections between adjacent walls without rigid frame inter￾actions between abutting walls are significant and cannot be neglected. Therefore,
to construct a reliable model in case of this vibroacoustic system interactions be￾tween abutting walls have to be incorporated into the model. Wall-wall interactions
are incorporated into the model by synthesizing appropriate boundary conditions for
partial differential equations describing transverse and in-plane motions of abutting
casing walls.
The boundary conditions for the system under consideration can be formulated
by applying the following conditions:
• continuity of walls displacements at the wall/wall junction,
• continuity of walls slope (rotation) at the wall/wall junction,
• equilibrium of forces at the wall/wall junction,
• equilibrium of moments at the wall/wall junction.
In order to apply above-mentioned conditions to derive boundary conditions the fol￾lowing forces and moments acting in the walls 2 and 5 are identified and described
as follows:

Fig. 3.10 shows all displacements, forces and moments that have to be taken into
account in the formulation of boundary condition at the junction between walls 2
and 5. Taking into account spatial distribution of displacements shown in Fig. 3.10,
it can be easily seen that the requirement of continuity of walls displacements at the
wall/wall junction leads to the following boundary conditions:
w5 (x, y,t) = w2z
(y,z,t), (3.152a)
w5x (x, y,t) = w2
(y,z,t), (3.152b)
w5y (x, y,t) = w2y
(y,z,t), (3.152c)
all for x = lx , z = 0, y ∈ (0,ly ), t > 0.
Taking into account the continuity of plates slope (rotation) at the wall/wall junc￾tion the next boundary condition can be constructed:

for y ∈ (0,ly ), t > 0. (3.153)
Taking into account spatial distribution of forces shown in Fig. 3.10, on the basis of
equilibrium of forces at the wall/wall junction the following boundary conditions are
formulated:
V5y (x, y,t) = N2yy (y,z,t), (3.154a)
N5yy (x, y,t) = −V2y

N5xy (x, y,t) = N2yz (y,z,t), (3.154c)
all for x = lx , z = 0, y ∈ (0,ly ), t > 0.
Finally, taking into account spatial distribution of moments shown in Fig. 3.10, on
the basis of equilibrium of moments at the wall/wall junction the following boundary
condition is formulated:

Eqs. (3.156) determines boundary conditions that relate to one pair of casing walls
2–5.
Remark 3.10 (Model of the whole casing)
Considerations presented take into account only one of twelve pairs of casing walls
(Fig. 3.9). To construct the complete model for the whole lightweight casing the
considerations presented should be repeated with respect to all other pairs of casing
walls (wall/wall junctions).
Remark 3.11 (Model complexity)
The complexity of the model of lightweight single-panel casing is comparable with
the model of double-panel rigid casing. In both cases the dynamics of each flexible
wall of the casing is described by the system of three coupled partial differential
equations. Both models are described by the system of 20 coupled partial differen￾tial equations. In case of rigid double-panel casing PDEs describing each wall are
second order with respect to time and two of them are fourth order with respect to
spatial variables while one is second order. In case of lightweight single-panel cas￾ing all PDEs describing each wall are once again second order with respect to time
and two of them are second order with respect to spatial variables while one fourth
order. So the model of lightweight casing seems to be slightly simpler as far as the
complexity of PDEs describing the model is concerned. However, boundary condi￾tions for the model of lightweight casing are more complicated compared to those
formulated in the model of double-panel rigid casing.
3.4 NUMERICAL MODELLING
Simulation that can be treated as application of the model to the problem follows
modelling. In this context, the act of simulating something first requires that a model
to be developed what is reported in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Models developed in this
sections represent the key characteristics of vibroacoustic systems being analysed.
Simulation, that is the imitation of the operation of a real-world system over time, is
also strongly related to answering the question of deriving of an effective strategy to
solve the equations describing the model. In many cases, general purpose software78 Noise-Controlling Casings
packages (e.g. Matlab, Mathematica, etc.) may be used to implement this strategy in
practice. Beyond this, it may be necessary to write dedicated software in cases where
the mathematical model under consideration involves nonstandard equations.
In case under consideration both strategies are taken into account. The general
purpose software packages are used to solve the task of simulating model of the
whole casing and composite structures. Optimization problems aimed at shaping of
structural and acoustic responses of vibroacoustic systems under discussion (Section
4.2) as well as optimization of actuators and sensors arrangement and optimization
of error microphones (Section 6.2) are solved by original dedicated software imple￾mented by authors for these purposes.
Results reported in Section 4.4.1 related to functionally-graded materials are ob￾tained by simulations performed in ANSYS software package. Details regarding em￾ployed numerical modelling of vibrating plate in ANSYS are given in Section 3.4.1.
For producing trustworthy results showing the operation of the whole active cas￾ing over time a numerical model in COMSOL Multiphysics is built. Section 3.4.2 is
devoted to this.
3.4.1 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF A SINGLE PLATE
Vibrating Panel Modelling
This section uses first order deformation theory and finite element methods to model
a structural casing for vibroacoustic computation. One side of the casing is bounded
by a fully clamped vibrating panel while the other sides are bounded by the casing
walls as illustrated in Fig. 3.11.
Fig. 3.12 represents a vibrating structural panel with thickness h and at a mid￾surface distance z, placed in an acoustic enclosure medium. By applying the first￾order shear deformation theory and taking the vibrating structural panel as a shell
(i.e., the thickness of the vibrating panel is far smaller than its length and width), the
displacement field can be established by the following equations
U (x, y,z,t) = u(x, y,t) +zβx (x, y,t) (3.157)
V (x, y,z,t) = v (x, y,t) +zβy (x, y,t) (3.158)
W (x, y,z,t) = w(x, y,t) (3.159)
Eqs. (3.157)–(3.159) show the displacement functions u, v and w at the mid￾surface along x, y and z directions, respectively. Also, the symbols βx (x, y,t) = −
∂w
∂ x
and βy (x, y,t) = −
∂w
∂ y
denote rotations of the normal in yz and xz planes, respectively
with time (t). By applying the linear small strain-displacement relations along the
middle plane surface, the deformations are defined and expressed as

where the strains εx, εy and γxy are defined as the in-plane meridional, circumferen￾tial and shearing strain components, respectively. The transverse shear terms along
xz and yz plane are γxz and γyz, respectively. Owing to the thin-walled structural
characteristics, it is assumed that the curvature of the shell structure is negligible
such that χx = χy = χxy = 0. Let N be the in-plane force resultant, M the bending
and twisting moment force resultant and R be the transverse shear. Describing the

3.4.2 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF AN ACTIVE CASING
A numerical model built in COMSOL Multiphysics is presented in this section. It
encompasses the following steps in the modelling workflow:
• defining geometry of the system,
• defining material properties,
• defining the physics that describe specific phenomena in the system,
• solving the numerical model.
With the model simulation implemented in the COMSOL Multiphysics software, the
system of the coupled partial differential equations describing the model is solved by
the finite element method.
Model set up in COMSOL Multiphysics
Taking into account the assumptions introduced and the model formulation described
in Section 3.3.2, a numerical model is built in COMSOL Multiphysics and solved
using finite element method. As is illustrated in Fig. 3.7, the whole system includes
twelve flexible thin panels and eight acoustic fields. To build the numerical modelModelling of casings 85
for simulation, first the geometry and material for all these structural and acoustic
fields are defined. Presented simulation assumes a symmetrical cubic casing, i.e. the
twelve thin walls’ panels are totally the same, including material, dimensions and
connections with the rigid frame. The eight acoustic domains use identical material
properties. All the geometry parameters are as follows:
lx = ly = lz = 0.42 m, a = 0.09 m, hi j = 0.001 m, di = 0.05 m
(i = 1,2,...,6, j = 1,2). (3.199)
The material properties of the panels (steel) are given by:
Ei j = 200 GPa, ρi j = 7850 kg/m
3
, νi j = 0.3, Ri j = 0.0001 N·m·s
(i = 1,2,...,6, j = 1,2). (3.200)
The acoustic fields (air, 20, 1 atm) satisfy:
ci = c0 = cs = 343 m/s, ρi = ρ0 = ρs = 1.2 kg/m
3
, µi = µ0 = µs = 2.5×10−10 s
(i = 1,2,...,6).
(3.201)
Fig. 3.13 shows the geometry built in COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the whole
system including all the fields. Figs. 3.13–3.22 were generated by Ms. L. Liu, within
joint research reported in [178]. As is shown, considering the symmetricity of the
casing, the acoustic field in the exterior is modelled using a sphere, whose centre is
located at the geometric centre of the casing.
Appropriate physics is then imposed to the corresponding geometry to match the
model developed in Section 3.3.2. For the acoustic fields, viscous fluid model is used,
and the viscosity parameters are set to match the absorption parameter in Eq. (3.201).
On the exterior boundary of the spherical acoustic field, perfectly matched layers
(PML) [9], which effectively absorbs the wave by imposing a complex-valued coor￾dinate transformation, are used to simulate the non-reflecting boundary conditions.
For the panels, shell model is used. Though COMSOL Multiphysics uses elements
of the Mindlin-Reissner type instead of the implemented Kirchhoff-Love plate the￾ory, the results have little difference since the panel is as thin as 1 mm and 1/420
of the length. The viscous damping coefficient indicated in Eq. (3.200) is imposed
by setting up a frequency dependent structural loss factor. The boundary condi￾tions introduced in Eq. (3.73) are also implemented. The boundary restraint coeffi￾cients are assumed to take the value ξi j = 22.9 (i = 1,2,...,6, j = 1,2). The setting
ξi j = 22.9 corresponds to prescribing the rotational stiffness along the panel edge lki
as D
ξi j
lki
= 103 N·m/m (i = 1,2,...,6, j = 1,2,k = 1,2). The value of boundary re￾straint coefficient has been chosen to analyse the system behaviour in case of imper￾fect fastening of panels’ edges to the rigid frame. For the fluid-structure interactions,
they are assured by specifying the panels as the acoustic-structure boundaries.
Finally, the study and the excitation are determined, and the mesh is built up
according to the frequency range of interest. As shown in Fig. 3.7, the simulation86 Noise-Controlling Casings

studies the response of the system under the excitation of a primary source inside
the casing. In practice, the sound source is modelled by a monopole of the strength
q = 10−3 m3/s, exciting the system in the frequency domain in the range from 30
Hz to 350 Hz. Considering the mesh convergence in high frequencies, the maximum
size of the (quadratic) shell element is set as 0.024 m, i.e. 18 elements per side of
the panel, and the counterpart of the (quadratic) acoustic element is 0.196 m, i.e. 5
elements per wavelength of the acoustic wave at 350 Hz. The convergence at low
frequencies is also checked because of the perfectly matched layers.
Simulation of selected models
In this section, the model of double-panel casing developed in Section 3.3.2 that is
described by the system of the 20 coupled partial differential equations is simulated
in COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation is performed to prove the model correct￾ness, i.e. convergence, appropriate spatial and temporal discretization, and correct
implementation of all physical aspects describing phenomena that are to be explored.
Finally, the results are interpreted in relation to the physical vibroacoustic system that
is described by the developed model in the context of results reasonableness. On the
one hand, results are interpreted in relation to the observed physical reality of the
system under discussion and on the other hand they are used to analyse the system
behaviour and consequently to understand the system behaviour better.Modelling of casings 87
Two independent simulations are carried out depending on the location of the
primary noise source being the source of undesirable noise that is to be attenuated.
The first simulation is performed assuming the monopole noise source is placed at
the casing centre (0.3 m, 0.3 m, 0.3 m) (noise source symmetrical with respect to
casing walls). In case of second simulation the monopole noise source is moved to
the point (0.4 m, 0.4 m, 0.4 m) (noise source asymmetrical with respect to casing
walls). Transverse displacement is studied for all panels and sound pressure level
is investigated for all acoustic fields in the system under discussion in case of both
simulations.
Noise source at the casing centre
Assuming that the sound source is placed at the casing centre (at the point (0.3 m,
0.3 m, 0.3 m)) and that the casing is symmetrical cubic, the response of the system
is also symmetric. It is symmetric about the typical nine symmetry planes of a cube.
In the given coordinate system, the equations of the symmetry planes are given by:
x = 0.3 m, y = 0.3 m, z = 0.3 m (3.202a)
x−y = 0, y−z = 0, x−z = 0 (3.202b)
x+y−0.6 m = 0, y+z−0.6 m = 0,x+z−0.6 m = 0 (3.202c)
Taking into account the symmetry in the response of the casing in the case under
discussion, the responses of the six double-panel walls are identical. Fig. 3.14 shows
transverse displacement of the incident and radiating panels for different exciting
frequencies in the range from 30 Hz to 350 Hz with the step of 1 Hz. Both the am￾plitude at the maximum displacement point and the amplitude at the central point of
each panel are used to draw the graph. Different vibration strengths can be observed
for the incident and radiating panels at most frequencies, however both of them ex￾hibit resonant at 52 Hz, 102 Hz, 162 Hz, 178 Hz and 271 Hz. The vibration patterns
of the panels at these resonant frequencies are shown in Fig. 3.15. To distinguish the
difference between vibration patterns depicted in Figs. 3.15(a) and (b), and the corre￾sponding difference between Figs. 3.15(c) and (d), the cross-section of the wall 5 (on
the bottom) looking from x axis direction is additionally plotted for Figs. 3.15(a)–(d).
In these plots the relative motion between the incident and radiating panels can be
observed that plays a crucial role in the correct interpretation of the results.
Figs. 3.15(a) and (b) indicate two coupling modes that relate to the first in
vacuo mode of a single panel, whose natural frequency is 43.5 Hz (Fig. 3.22). For
Fig. 3.15(a), incident and radiating panels vibrate towards or against the casing cen￾tre together. The acoustic field in the interior of the casing stiffens the panels, and
thus the resonance frequency 52 Hz is higher than the natural frequency of the panel.
Fig. 3.15(b) is different from Fig. 3.15(a) concerning the relationship between rela￾tive motion of the incident and radiating panels. While in Fig. 3.15(a) the two panels
move in the same direction, in Fig. 3.15(b) they do the opposite. At 102 Hz, since
the two panels always vibrate in the opposite direction, the acoustic field in between88 Noise-Controlling Casings
(in the cavity) always resists their vibration due to the change of air volume. Accord￾ingly, this mode has a much higher frequency. To see the difference with respect to
the acoustic field, Fig. 3.16 shows the sound pressure level of all acoustic fields in the
system. At 52 Hz, from the interior to the exterior of the casing, the sound pressure
level is decreasing. The acoustic fields between the incident and radiating panels are
about 5 dB smaller than the interior. In contrast, the sound pressure level in these
narrow cavities is amplified at 102 Hz and even approximately 13 dB higher than
the interior of the casing. At first glance it seems surprising but in the context of the
analysis carried out it is obvious that the result of strong coupling effect that can be
observed in the double-panel walls at 102 Hz. The relative motion between the two
panels strengthens the acoustic field and the air volume inside stiffens the vibration
of the panels.
The difference between Figs. 3.15(c) and (d), that relate to resonant at 162 Hz and
178 Hz, is similar. But this time, the coupling effect is lighter, which benefits from
the mode shape of a single panel. When some part of the panel vibrates forward and
some other part vibrates backward, the panel itself can compensate some air volume
change. As a result, the third and fourth resonances are closer. It can also be expected
that, for higher modes, this effect will be even smaller.
Corresponding to Fig. 3.14, Fig. 3.17 shows the sound pressure level measured
at point (0.3 m, 0.8 m, 0.3 m) and point (0.3 m, 1.1 m, 0.3 m), respectively 0.3 m
and 0.5 m in front of the wall 4. As is expected, the sound pressure level changes in
agreement with the maximum displacement of radiating panel shown in Fig. 3.14.
Apart from the similar curve shapes, the frequencies of the peaks are coincident.
Fig. 3.17 also illustrates that the sound pressure level decreases as the distance from
the casing wall increases.
To have a better insight about each acoustic field, the sound pressure level for dif￾ferent acoustic fields at 52 Hz (corresponding to Fig. 3.16(a)) is separately depicted
in Fig. 3.18. The structure of the active casing encloses 7 cavities. Inside each cav￾ity, the sound field varies a little, within 1 dB, because the frequency is much lower
than the first non-zero eigenfrequency of the corresponding rigid-wall cavity, which
is 343 Hz for the interior of casing and 409 Hz for the interiors of casing walls. In
the interior of the active casing (Fig. 3.18(a)), the maximum sound pressure level is
seen at the centre since the noise source is placed there. For the interiors of the cas￾ing walls (Fig. 3.18(b)), around the centre of the incident panels has the maximum
value. However, the situation will change for different frequencies, depending on the
fluid-structure interactions among the panels and cavities. Considering the exterior
acoustic field ((Fig. 3.18(c)), as the distance from the casing increases, the sound
pressure level decreases in general. The maximum value is shown around the casing
walls. Each wall is like a sound source and their radiated sounds interfere with each
other.
Noise source moved from the centre
When the noise source is moved to point (0.4 m, 0.4 m, 0.4 m), the level of the
symmetricity is decreased comparing to case when it is placed at the casing centre,Modelling of casings 89

although it is still symmetric with respect to the planes of Eq. (3.202b). As a result,
some of the modes that are not symmetric with respect to the other planes can be
excited. With a discussion in this case, the influence of the position of the primary
noise source is present.

and Fig. 3.19 reveals the different responses between these two opposite walls. For
most resonances, the responses on the wall 4 are higher than the wall 3. Particularly,
at 43 Hz, the vibration of wall 3 is suppressed while the vibration of wall 4 is am￾plified. One of the reasons is that the noise source is closer to wall 4. To understand
the situation, knowing the in vacuo modes of the panel would be helpful. The first
15 natural frequencies and mode shapes of a single panel are listed and shown in
Fig. 3.22. The frequency 43 Hz is close to the first natural frequency of the panel.
When the sound field is at this frequency, it cannot provoke the resonances of all
panels, because of the stiffening effect of the cavities (which has been discussed in
detail in case of the first simulation, causing the resonances at 52 Hz and 102 Hz).
However, when the noise source is moved from the casing centre to point (0.4 m, 0.4
m, 0.4 m), the six walls do not need to response alike, resonances of walls 2, 4 and
6 are provoked because they are closer to the sound source. Instead, the vibrations
of other three walls are suppressed. For other frequencies, there are similar interac￾tions among panels, cavities and the noise source. The peaks labelled in Fig. 3.19 (or
Fig. 3.20) can all relate to the in vacuo modes of the panel (Fig. 3.22) except the one
at 347 Hz: 43 Hz, 52 Hz, 102 Hz for the 1st mode; 86 Hz for the 2nd and 3rd modes;
130 Hz for the 4th mode; 162 Hz and 178 Hz for the 6th mode; 202 Hz for the 7th and
8
th modes; 258 Hz for the 9th and 10th modes; 271 Hz for the 11th mode and 300 Hz94 Noise-Controlling Casings
for the 13th modes. It is noticed that there are no corresponding peaks for the 5th and
the 12th modes. The reasons can be found by comparing the natural frequencies and
observing the mode shapes of the panel, as shown in Fig. 3.22. The frequencies of
the 5th and the 12th modes are very close to the 6th and the 13th modes, respectively,
and sound source position is close to the nodal lines of the 5th and the 12th modes of
the panel, so when the excitation frequency is approximate to the natural frequencies
of these modes, the 6th and the 13th modes are excited. Unlike the aforementioned
resonances are structure controlled, the resonance at 347 Hz is cavity controlled.
Fig. 3.21 depicts the sound pressure level outside the casing at two different points
in front of wall 4. The two measuring points are the same as in case of the first
simulation (Fig. 3.17). Figs. 3.21 and 3.17 look alike in the low frequency range that
is smaller than approximately 240 Hz, except some small peaks that are shown in
Fig. 3.21 at 43 Hz, 86 Hz and 202 Hz. These frequencies can also be found at the
peaks of the radiating panel maximum displacement of wall 4, as shown in Fig. 3.19.
However, although the radiating panel has a distinguished increase of the maximum
displacement at 130 Hz, the sound pressure level shown in Fig. 3.21 at this frequency
remains small, just like the behaviour of the radiating panel centre. Then, for the
higher frequencies from 240 Hz to 350 Hz, the sound pressure level in Fig. 3.21 is
much higher than in Fig. 3.17, especially around 258 Hz and 347 Hz. The peaks
at these two frequencies of the sound pressure level are conform with the peaks
of the maximum displacement on the radiating panel, but at 130 Hz and 300 Hz,
the conformity is missing. To sum up, comparing the sound pressure level outside
the casing (Fig. 3.21) and the displacement of the panels (Fig. 3.19), the peaks in
Fig. 3.19 can be classified into three categories:
• The first category includes peaks at 43 Hz, 52 Hz, 102 Hz, 162 Hz, 178 Hz,
258 Hz and 271 Hz and 347 Hz. These peaks shown in Fig. 3.21 are con￾trolled by the maximum displacement of the radiating panel, and the curve
shapes around these peaks are similar to the curve of the radiating panel
maximum in Fig. 3.19. Besides, Fig. 3.19 indicates that the displacement
at the panel centre also reaches peak at these frequencies.
• The second category refers to the peaks at 86 Hz and 202 Hz. They can
be observed in Fig. 3.21, but much smaller than the corresponding peaks
on the radiating panel maximum displacement curve in Fig. 3.19. Mean￾while, the corresponding peaks are not shown in the radiating panel centre
displacement.
• The third category is for the peaks at 130 Hz and 300 Hz. These peaks are
not present in in Fig. 3.21. The discrepancy between the radiating panel
maximum and centre displacements are also observed at these frequencies.
The agreement or disagreement between the panel maximum and the panel centre
actually reflects the vibration pattern of the panel. Therefore, the sound pressure level
outside the double-panel casing is closely related to the maximum displacement of
the radiating panels as well as their vibrating patterns.Modelling of casings 95
3.5 VALIDATION OF SELECTED MODELS
The previously developed model is validated in this section for selected cases. Re￾sults of simulations are compared with laboratory experiments. The model is vali￾dated by means of a comparison of natural frequencies, mode shapes and frequency
response functions.
In experiments performed by the authors, measurements of natural frequencies
and mode shapes are made with a laser vibrometer PDV-100 (measuring the normal
plate velocity in a large number of points). A loudspeaker placed on the bottom
of the casing is used as the noise source exciting the casing walls and making them
vibrate. A random wideband signal is used as the excitation. Due to the close distance
between the walls and the loudspeaker, not all of the eigenmodes in the considered
frequency range are excited equally. Some of the less excited eigenmodes are even
difficult to observe, because of vicinity of more excited ones.
3.5.1 RIGID CASING WALLS
In this subsection, the measurements and simulation results are presented, obtained
for two configurations of rigid casing wall. In all performed experiments, single wall
has been acoustically excited with a random wideband signal. The response of the
plate has been measured in 400 uniformly distributed points (the distance between
adjacent points was equal 20 mm). Remaining walls have been either removed or
passively insulated to minimize the interference at this stage of the research.
3.5.1.1 Unloaded casing wall
First, an unloaded casing wall is evaluated. It is a 1 mm thick brushed aluminium
plate. Due to the manufacturing process, the plate represents orthotropic properties—
it follows from the analysis of initial 11 eigenmodes presented in Fig. 3.23 that de￾spite square shape of the plate, e.g. 2nd and 3rd natural frequencies are not equal.
Depending on the application, the wall could be satisfyingly approximated with an
isotropic plate model. However, to obtain the highest modelling accuracy, the or￾thotropic Mindlin plate model is used. The parameters of the plate used for the pur￾pose of modelling are as follows:
a = 0.420 m, b = 0.420 m, h = 0.001 m,
Ex = 91.2 GPa, Ey = 60.8 GPa, Gxy = 29.2 GPa,
ρp = 2770kg/m3 , νx = 0.3, κx =5/6.
For the rigid casing walls, fully-clamped boundary conditions offer generally sat￾isfactory results. However, in this case, boundary conditions elastically restrained
against rotation are used. The stiffness coefficients of rotational springs have been
assumed close to completely rigid (as it is for fully-clamped boundary conditions),
but a minor softening of the springs offered better fitness to the real measurement
data.96Modelling of casings Noise-Controlling Casings97

S. Wrona.Modelling of casings 97
Assessing the fitness of theoretically calculated natural frequencies and mode
shapes to the real measurements of rigid casing wall (see Fig. 3.23), it can be consid￾ered as entirely sufficient. Therefore, a model evaluated in such way for the unloaded
plate can now be used to investigate behaviour of the plate when the additional ele￾ments are attached to its surface.
3.5.1.2 Casing wall with additional mass
The next case is an evaluation of the casing wall with an additional mass attached.
In this investigation, a mass of mm,1 = 0.080 kg is used. It is rigidly bonded to the
plate surface at location xm,1 = 0.340 m and ym,1 = 0.340 m. Measurements were per￾formed in the same manner as for the unloaded plate. Rotary inertia of the attached
mass is taken into account. Theoretically calculated and experimentally measured
natural frequencies and mode shapes are compared in Fig. 3.24. A high consistency
of both results is obtained.
3.5.2 LIGHTWEIGHT CASING WALLS
In this subsection, the light-weight casing is under consideration. A variant of di￾mensions 500 mm×630 mm×800 mm with 1.5 mm of plate thickness is used. The
casing with accompanying laboratory setup is shown in Fig. 3.25. During the mea￾surements of the natural frequencies and mode shapes, the whole casing was excited
together with a random signal by a loudspeaker placed inside. The response of the
casing was measured in uniformly distributed points with the distance between the
adjacent points equal 20 mm (as in the case of the rigid casing walls). Such dense
grid resulted in many measurement points: 1280 points for the top wall, 1000 points
for the front wall and 800 points for the left wall. Hence, a high accuracy of the mea￾sured mode shapes is obtained. They can be presented for the whole casing together,
as in an example for frequency of 155 Hz given in Fig. 3.26. However, as it was dis￾cussed in previous chapters, the light-weight casing constitutes a three-dimensional
structure with strong couplings, but due to its specific dynamical behaviour, it can
be studied with each of its walls separately. Therefore, due to methodology of the
modelling, theoretical calculations and measurements are further compared for each
wall separately (right and back walls are omitted as they are symmetrical to the left
and front walls, respectively).
The mathematical modelling of the loading of the casing walls with additional
elements is validated in previous subsection. Therefore, to justify the application of
the developed model for the light-weight casing, only results for the unloaded casing
are presented.
3.5.2.1 Unloaded casing walls
Mathematical model parameters used here can be divided into two groups. First
group includes dimensions and material properties of the plates that are known, and9898 Noise-Controlling Casings Noise-controlling casings

in this research they are represented by following values:
h = 0.0015 m,
E = 200 GPa, G = 76.9 GPa,
ρp = 7850kg/m3 , ν = 0.3, κ =5/6.
All of these values are common for all walls of the casing. The width and height of
each plate (denoted by a and b, respectively) are defined by corresponding dimen￾sions of the casing given earlier in the subsection.
The second group consists of parameters, which cannot be measured or calcu￾lated directly. Therefore, for the purpose of fitting the model to the behaviour of real
whole vibrating structure, an optimization algorithm is used to identify them. In this
research, such parameters are spring constants describing boundary conditions of
each wall. Plate edges are assumed to be elastically restrained against both rotation
and translation, hence there are four rotational spring constants krx0, krx1, kry0, kry1,
and four translational spring constants ktx0, ktx1, kty0, kty1, defined as in Section 3.2.2,

3.6 SUMMARY
The mathematical models of the device casing walls have been presented in this
chapter, incorporating different approaches.
First, analytical model of individual casing walls has been developed. The model
includes thin and thick plate theory, elastically restrained boundary conditions, struc￾tural thermoelastic damping model, and additional elements mounted to the casing
surface—masses, ribs, actuators and sensors. These aspects are integrated in a state
space model form, which facilitates further analysis and numerical simulation.
Second, analytical modelling of the whole casing has been presented. A number
of interacting subsystems are specified, including acoustic medium inside cavities
and surrounding the casing. For the light-weight casing, vibrations of a panel cause
changes in the boundary conditions of the adjacent panels, what was also considered.
The developed theoretical models have been verified by simulation using mul￾tiphysics packages and experimentally in laboratory tests. Experimental measure￾ments have also been used to fine tune the parameters of the mathematical models.
The model can be used to predict natural frequencies and mode shapes of a cas￾ing walls or other panels, and hence to optimize the structure parameters. If active
control is concerned, it can be used also to calculate measures of controllability and
observability of the system.4 Passive control
4.1 INTRODUCTION
The first considered group of noise reduction methods are passive solutions, which
are characterized by a complete lack of the need for external energy supply. In gen￾eral, this group includes physical modifications to the noise source itself or barriers
that separate it from the recipient. These modifications often lead to the optimal
shaping of the vibroacoustic properties of the structure (e.g. shifting the natural fre￾quencies or introducing additional damping) based on a previously prepared the￾oretical or numerical model [35, 171, 172]. These modifications can be made by
adding metamaterials [32], mass, a damper, or increasing the stiffness of a selected
structure component in an appropriate manner, provided, e.g. by an optimization al￾gorithm. Modifications of this type may be introduced at the design stage and taken
into account in production, or implemented individually for existing devices. Passive
solutions can also include systems originally based on semi-active or even active so￾lutions, but powered by energy harvesting within the system, which eliminates the
need for external energy supply [105, 80, 37].
4.2 SHAPING OF STRUCTURAL AND ACOUSTIC RESPONSES
Plates exhibit a complicated frequency response, with multiple strong resonances
and antiresonances. The ability to shape the frequency response of the plate as de￾sired would therefore be highly beneficial in noise control applications, allowing to
better fit to given noise spectrum. The passive transmission loss of the plate could
be improved by appropriately shaping the frequency response, moving resonances in
frequency domain away from dominant noise tones [176].
As described in [176], an arrangement of additional masses and ribs attached to
the plate surface can be optimized in order to achieve a desired structural frequency
response. The general rules for the addition of mass or stiffness are well known –
additional masses reduce the natural frequencies of the plate, whereas stiffeners in￾crease them. When these elements are used together at appropriate locations, they
can be used to precisely alter the frequencies of multiple modes. Initially-developed
methods have focused on natural frequencies of structural vibrations and have not
taken into account their acoustic radiation efficiency [171, 172]. This should not be
neglected, as even moderate alterations of the mode shapes can significantly affect
their acoustic radiation power [176]. For example, for a noise barrier, instead of shift￾ing structural resonances out of a frequency range of interest, their acoustic radiation
can be reduced. This phenomenon is important for the applications under considera￾tion, i.e. noise-reducing casings.
The limitations of the proposed method relate mainly to the maximum dimensions
and masses of the added structures, but the values derived from the optimization

process are practical and can be employed for a wide class of applications. In active
noise control applications structural sensors and actuators are modelled as additional
masses. Their arrangement is optimized, together with that of passive masses and
ribs, in order to maximize the controllability and observability of the system [179,
177], together with the frequency response shaping objectives. This requires the use
of multi-objective cost functions. In this paper, accelerometers and inertial actuators
are considered, however, the idea can also be applied to other kinds of transducers,
e.g. piezoelectric patches [1, 49].
4.2.1 OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
This section describes the proposed method for optimizing the arrangement of ad￾ditional elements mounted on a vibrating plate in order to shape its acoustic radi￾ation, and to enhance controllability and observability measures, if necessary. An
optimization problem with appropriate cost functions is defined, and an optimization
algorithm is employed to find an optimal solution [176].
Optimization problem
The variables defined for the optimization problem correspond to the shape and
placement of a predefined number of additional elements mounted on the surface
of a vibrating plate. They are optimized in the sense of minimizing an arbitrarily￾chosen cost function. Four kinds of elements are considered:
• Additional masses
These are passive elements. A number of different items can be employed
in this role, including custom-made weights and neodymium magnets. The
total concentrated mass mm,i and position coordinates (xm,i
, ym,i) are con￾sidered as optimization variables for the ith additional mass.
• Ribs
These are passive elements. It is assumed for practical reasons that one
of their dimensions is much greater than the others, and that their cross￾sections are constant along this direction. Therefore, the length, location
and orientation defined by coordinates (xr0,i
, yr0,i) and (xr1,i
, yr1,i) are con￾sidered as optimization variables for the ith rib. The rib material and cross￾sectional dimensions are assumed here to be predefined, however, they
could also be optimization variables if desired.
• Actuators
In this paper inertial actuators are considered, although other types of actu￾ators, such as PZT patches, PZT stacks or MFC patches, could also be em￾ployed and included in the model. The actuators are used to force vibration
and generate sound with the vibrating plate, or to enhance its passive trans￾mission loss. Their shape and mass are assumed to be predefined, hence
their position coordinates (xa,i
, ya,i) are the only optimization variables for
the ith actuator.Passive control 107
• Sensors
Accelerometers are used in this research as structural sensors to monitor
vibrations or to provide signals for an active control algorithm. Other trans￾ducers, e.g. tensometers, MFC elements or PVDF films could also be con￾sidered and included in the model. Similarly, as in the case of actuators,
only the position coordinates (xs,i
, ys,i) are considered as optimization vari￾ables for the ith sensor.
Furthermore, the variables specified above are subject to various constraints. The
number, weight and dimensions of the elements are limited due to plate shape
and other practical constraints depending on the application. A further constraint
is that the additional elements should not overlap. To summarize the formu￾lated problem, the optimization algorithm is required to find a solution in a
(3Nm +4Nr +2[Na +Ns
])-dimensional space.
Memetic algorithm
The multi-dimensional search space that follows from the described problem is very
complicated, containing numerous local optima. Therefore, an efficient optimization
algorithm should be employed in order to find a solution that satisfies the defined
requirements. A Memetic Algorithm (MA) has been chosen for this task, which is
a hybrid form of a population-based approach coupled with individual learning [130,
128]. MA combines advantages of global search and local refinement procedures,
which enhance convergence to the local optima. The MA has been successfully used
by the authors in previous applications, e.g. in [107, 106].
Fig. 4.1 shows a flowchart of the memetic algorithm used in this work. The al￾gorithm starts with the initialization step, in which a given number of individuals
(potential solutions) is randomly generated to create the initial population (a pool
of possible solutions).b In the evaluation step, the fitness function is calculated for

each individual in the population. This part of the algorithm consumes most of the
computation time, as it requires a complete model recalculation, including both vi￾bration and acoustic radiation parts, for each fitness function evaluation. Hence, par￾allelized computation is advisable. Subsequently, the individuals are sorted based on
their fitness values. The algorithm then checks whether the termination criteria have
been met, i.e. whether a fixed maximum number of generations has been reached
or the optimization has converged. Convergence is defined to have occurred when
a predefined number of recent generations resulted in no improvement in the cost
function. If any of the termination criteria are met, then the optimization process is
finished. Otherwise, the process continues, as shown in Fig. 4.1, and the selection
step is performed, where a subset of the existing population is chosen for repro￾duction depending on their associated fitness values. A fixed number of the fittest
individuals are selected (survive) and the rest are rejected (die out). Then, in the
crossover step, child solutions are generated by applying a crossover operator for
a number of selected pairs of individuals (parents). Individuals with higher fitness
values are more likely to be chosen as parents. Children join the population without
replacing the parents at this stage, although this may happen at a subsequent stage
depending on their fitness, as determined in the evaluation and selection steps. This
process is equivalent to the elitist selection strategy, which allows a limited num￾ber of the best parents to carry over to the next generation, unaltered. To maintain
population diversity, so as to counteract premature convergence and ensure a global
search, the mutation operator is used in the mutation step. This operator is applied
based on a predefined probability. In this implementation, the mutation results in the
creation of an additional individual which joins the population, keeping the original
individual unaltered. Then, a local search operator is employed to improve the indi￾vidual fitness (the local search step). To maintain a balance between the degree of
exploration and individual improvement, only a fraction of the population of individ￾uals undergoes the learning process. The “hill climbing” technique is chosen as the
individual learning strategy [130]. Afterwards, an evaluation is performed, and the
process is repeated until one of the termination criteria is met.
4.2.2 OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS
The cost function for the described problem should quantify the discrepancy between
the desired and actual acoustic radiation of the plate. It can be expressed using the
natural frequencies fi and estimates of modal acoustic power Pi
, where i stands for
the mode number. The overall transmission in a specified frequency band can also
be specified to be either enhanced or attenuated, depending on the role of the plate.
Moreover, if an active control application is considered, measures of controllability
and observability of the system, expressed in the form of diagonal elements of the
controllability and observability Gramian matrices, λc,i and λo,i
, respectively, should
also be introduced into the cost function, making it a multi-objective optimization
problem. Therefore, in a general form, the cost function can be defined as [176]
J = f(fi
,Pi
,λc,i
,λo,i
,Θ), (4.1)Passive control 109
where Θ is a vector representing the optimization variables of the additional ele￾ments, including their shapes and arrangement. Specific definitions of particular cost
functions are presented in Section 4.2.3, where results for different scenarios are
presented and discussed.
In the present research, the numbers of additional elements mounted to the plate
are not a subject of optimization. They are predefined as initialization parameters.
If the results obtained for particular numbers of elements are not satisfactory, the
numbers should be increased. However, simpler configurations are usually more de￾sirable. Therefore, if the goal is achieved, the possibility of reducing the number of
elements should be explored—sometimes a satisfactory result can be obtained with
fewer elements. This means that the final number of elements is a trade-off between
the quality of the obtained result and the complexity of the solution. In the example
cases reported in the following section, the choice of numbers of elements is made
according to the guidelines described above. However, for the sake of brevity, this
process is not discussed in detail for any particular scenario.
4.2.3 RESULTS
In the simulation studies, frequencies up to 400 Hz are considered, and first 12 eigen￾modes of the plate are compared for each scenario. For the unloaded plate, frequency
responses of the plate obtained from the model are shown in Fig. 4.2. The acoustic
and structural vibration responses shown are (i) the mean sound pressure amplitude
obtained by averaging over the measurement grid and (ii) the mean vibration ampli￾tude obtained by averaging over the plate surface, respectively. Natural frequencies
are given in Table 4.1. Additional masses are limited to a maximum value of 0.2 kg.
The ribs are assumed to have a constant cross-section with a square shape, defined
by dimensions:
er,i = hr,i = 0.006 m, (4.2)
where er,i
is the width and hr,i
is the height of the ith stiffener. Such a cross-section
implies that the geometric properties of the stiffeners are given by:
Ar,i = er,i hr,i

where ωsp is a set point frequency, limiting the frequency range of interest (only
resonances with ωi ≤ ωsp are considered in the cost function). The cost function J1
results in the minimization of the acoustic radiation of the most radiating mode. To
evaluate the cost function, the set point frequency was set to ωsp = 300 Hz. Only
passive elements were considered in this case. The numbers of additional masses
and ribs were set to Nm = 2 and Nr = 2, respectively. Results of the optimization
are given in Fig. 4.3 and Table 4.2, where circles and lines represent placements of

The algorithm achieved the solution with a cost function value of J1,opt = 19.4 dB.
As a result of the optimization, the amplitudes of the structural response were only
slightly altered, whereas the acoustic response amplitudes were strongly reduced,
reducing the amplitudes of the highest peaks in the considered frequency range by
more than 7 dB.
It follows from the analysis of these results that the structural vibration resonances
can be moved in the frequency domain with additional masses and ribs, but it is
difficult to reduce their amplitudes. On the other hand, additional masses and ribs
strongly affect the mode shapes, which play a large part in determining the acoustic
radiation. Therefore the results confirm that the acoustic radiation capability of the
plate can be significantly reduced with the use of additional elements, even over
a wide frequency range.
It is noteworthy that, just above the considered frequency range, the tenth mode
has a high estimate of the modal acoustic power. In such cases it may be desirable to
increase the set point frequency ωsp in order to avoid the proximity of such highly￾radiating modes.

Minimization of the acoustic radiation for a narrower frequency bandwidth
The third scenario considers the minimization of the acoustic radiation for a narrower
frequency band. This objective is expressed using the cost function

where df determines the width of the chosen frequency band; and set point frequency
ωsp defines the centre of the band. The cost function J3 results in minimization of the
acoustic radiation of a set of modes, with the highest weighting given to the modes
that are nearest to the set point frequency ωsp. To evaluate the cost function, the
set point frequency was set to ωsp = 175 Hz and parameter df = 2. Only passive
elements were considered. The numbers of additional masses and ribs were again set
to Nm = 2 and Nr = 2, respectively. Results of the optimization are given in Fig. 4.4
and Table 4.3.
The algorithm achieved a solution with a cost function value of J3,opt = 10.2 dB.
The solution found shows that the shaping method acted in two ways. First, the
natural frequencies of the plate were moved as far away from the frequency band
of interest as possible. Second, for those modes that could not be moved far enough,
the estimates of modal acoustic power were greatly reduced. As a result, the acoustic
response of the plate was flattened in the frequency band of interest, increasing its
transmission loss significantly. The optimized solution therefore makes such a plate
suitable for application as a noise barrier for the noise frequencies considered.

Hybrid passive-active acoustic barrier
A hybrid, passive-active acoustic barrier is optimized in this subsection. The objec￾tive in this scenario is expressed using the following cost function
J6 = ∏

Pi
λc,i
· λo,i

, ωi ≤ ωsp . (4.6)
The cost function J6 leads to the simultaneous minimization of both acoustic radia￾tion of modes within the considered frequency range, and the maximization of their
controllability and observability. Structural sensors are introduced in this scenario,
because the active barrier control system needs a feedback signal for its operation.
To evaluate the proposed cost function, the set point frequency was set to ωsp = 300
Hz. Actuators, sensors and ribs were used as admissible additional elements, with
Na = 3, Ns = 3 and Nr = 2, respectively. The results of the optimization are shown in
Fig. 4.5 and Table 4.4.
The algorithm achieves the solution with a cost function value of J6,opt =
−54.0 dB. The solution satisfies all of the stated objectives: (i) the estimates of
modal acoustic power of resonances within the frequency range of interest are pas￾sively reduced (by more than 10 dB for certain frequency bands), while both (ii)
controllability, and (iii) observability are ensured for all of the considered modes.Passive control 115

The development of such hybrid solutions is a novel approach which requires more
investigation. However, given its potential, it is worthy of further research.
It is noteworthy that it is only for the first mode that the acoustic power was not
passively reduced by the optimized solution (see Fig. 4.5). This is due to the fact that
the fundamental mode, by its nature, does not have any nodal lines, which makes it
practically impossible to reduce its acoustic radiation by influencing the mode shape
(virtually no alteration is possible for such a shape). Hence, the acoustic power of
the fundamental mode can only be modified slightly by altering its frequency.
To summarize, the analysis of the results of the optimization algorithm shows
that the structural vibration resonances can be adjusted in the frequency domain with
additional masses and ribs, but that their magnitudes are difficult to influence. How￾ever, the addition of masses and ribs strongly affects the mode shapes, which play
a significant part in determining the acoustic radiation. Therefore, the incorporation
of the acoustic radiation model into the optimization process greatly extends the ca￾pabilities of the shaping approach. The transmission loss of a passive noise barrier
can be enhanced by more than 7 dB in a chosen frequency band and, in the opposite
case, the passive sound transmission of a plate can be enhanced by more than 10 dB.116 Noise-Controlling Casings
Furthermore, the results of this passive optimization approach can be combined
with optimization of the placement of actuators and sensors , resulting in hybrid
passive-active control systems. The optimization process was successfully performed
for both a driven sound source and a hybrid passive-active noise barrier. The passive
transmission loss for the barrier was enhanced by more than 10 dB for certain fre￾quency bands, while both controllability and observability were ensured for all of the
modes considered.
There are few limitations of the method other than those related to the physical
constraints imposed on the structure—limited dimensions, overall weight and se￾lected type of elements. However, as shown by the examples discussed, the structural
parameters of the elements considered are appropriate for the majority of applica￾tions. The proposed method could also be applied for more complex structures, such
as panels of different shapes, and even whole casings of devices, if a model of the vi￾broacoustic system is available. The method allows for enhanced sound radiation or
transmission loss properties of a structure, without affecting its outward appearance.
4.3 PASSIVE SHUNT SYSTEMS
The passive shunt circuits assume no need of external energy to work. It is based
on the piezoelectric elements such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) or Macro Fiber
Composite (MFC) structures. It is capable to transform the mechanical energy of the
vibrating structure into the electrical charge. This energy is stored in internal capaci￾tance of piezoelectric element and should be reused or dissipated. The easiest method
is transform energy into the heat, by including resistor in circuit [55]. With internal
capacitance of piezoelectric element and additional inductor a simple RLC circuit
can be build. Such system is more efficient, however, it should be tuned to the spe￾cific frequency of vibration, i.e. the resistance and inductance values are optimized
for the single mode. It is also sensitive for changes of environmental conditions, such
as temperature, and requires inductance values higher than inductors existing in real￾ity. Hence, a synthetic inductor, based on the operational amplifiers (opamps) is used
[160]. However, it requires an external source of energy to supply opamps, which
place this solution in group of active systems. An alternative approach is switch￾ing circuits, based on the Synchronized Switched Damping (SSD) idea. It assumes
switching between open and short circuits, four times per each vibration cycle, when
the displacement of vibrating structure occurs extremum [69]. A proper time is de￾termined with the use of switching law. One of the most popular methods from SSD
group is SSD on inductor (SSDI), which is RLC shunt circuit with switching [149].
This method can be implemented as passive or semi-active system, dependently on
source of energy used to control the switches.
4.3.1 HARDWARE PLATFORM
The presented research is based on rigid frame casing described previously. Two dif￾ferent panels, i.e. 0.5 mm thick steel (Fig. 4.6(a)) with five MFCs and 1.0 mm thick
aluminium (Fig. 4.6(b)) with nine MFCs were investigated as a front wall. To assure
boundary conditions similar to fully clamped an additional clamping frame was used,Passive control 117

and the panels were mounted using twenty screws. The other—top and side—walls
are made from 3 mm thick aluminium panels to enhance acoustic insulation of the
casing. To assure mechanical coupling between the panel and piezoelectric elements
as much as it is possible, the MFCs were attached to plate’s surface using epoxy glue.
To increase the efficiency of SSDI circuit, the MFC elements are connected in series,
and their placement was determined by mode shapes of the vibrating structure. For
the first experiment a (3,3) mode was investigated (Fig. 4.7(c)), and MFC elements
were attached in places of anti-nodes compatible in phase. For the second experiment
a (1,3) and a (3,1) modes were investigated (Figs. 4.7(a), and (b)). The MFCs were
attached in places of every anti-node. To increase the voltage obtained from piezo￾electric elements, in the places of anti-nodes with opposite phases a polarization of
MFCs was inverted.118 Noise-Controlling Casings
Figure 4.8 Measurement and control system for the first experiment.
The experiments are divided into two stages: with the front wall made of steel
[150], and made of aluminium [104]. On the panel’s surface five and nine MFC el￾ements were attached, respectively. Both the experiments were performed using the
different laboratory setups. In the first configuration (Fig. 4.8) the investigated struc￾ture is excited to vibrate by using an active loudspeaker placed outside the casing. A
tonal signal emitted by the loudspeaker was generated with a DDS signal generator
application implemented on NI myRIO platform, working in the standalone mode,
using LabVIEW FPGA. The vibration of the structure was measured at the cen￾tral point using Polytec PDV-100 Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). The data was
acquired using NI M-series PCI-6289 DAQ card. The measurements were stored,
processed and presented in NI LabVIEW graphical environment.
The laboratory setup for the second experiment was similar (Fig. 4.9), however, with
some modifications.
An active loudspeaker was placed inside the casing. NI myRIO was replaced by
an external DDS signal generator and measurement system was based on the dSpace
platform. Besides the vibrations measurement, the noise emitted outside the casing
was measured using six microphones.
In Table 4.5 (x,y,z) coordinates of LDV and randomly distributed microphones are
presented. The origin of the coordinate system is in the middle of front down edge
of the investigated casing, which was also presented on the illustrative scheme
(Fig. 4.10).
4.3.2 CONTROL STRUCTURE
In the presented research it was assumed that there are no mechanical interactions
between the front and other walls. Modelling of the system including all of the
couplings is much more complicated. The model of the front wall is based on the
Kirchhoff-Love theory for thin plates [108]. Neglecting the damping, the transverse
displacement η can be calculated using following equation:Passive control 119

i=0
fMFC,i(t) are effective external force, and force
generated by all MFCs, respectively. The main parameters of the investigated steel
and aluminium panels, and MFC elements are presented in Table 4.6.
In SSDI the piezoelectric element should generate force with the sign opposite to
the velocity. The force generated by a piezoelectric element is equal to:
fMFC,i(t) = −αiuMFC,i(t), (4.10)
where uMFC,i(t) is the voltage on ith MFC element, and αi
is a coefficient related to
its efficiency.Passive control 121
With zero initial conditions, the force generated by the piezoelectric element is
opposite to the velocity (and displacement). Each MFC generates current equal to:
ii(t) = αi
dx(t)
dt
. (4.11)
This current charges the MFC. When the terminals of the MFC are open and the
internal MFC parallel resistance is discarded, and only internal MFC capacitance
cMFC is taken into account, the voltage on the MFC is equal to:
uMFC,i(t) = 1

For positive initial velocity the displacement is positive and the generated force is
negative. After the first one-fourth cycle the sign of the velocity changes to negative
and the piezoelectric voltage is in its maximum. The displacement is still positive,
and the force is negative. The sign is the same as the sign of the velocity, which is not
desired. So the sign of the force must be changed. Thus, the polarity of the voltage on
the MFC element must be changed. In SSD systems the piezoelectric is discharged
by shorting its terminals, the voltage drops to zero, and then the velocity recharges
the piezoelectric with appropriate polarity. So, in SSD circuits the force generated
by the piezoelectric is always opposite to the velocity and it is proportional to the
displacement measured between the current position and the position in which the
MFC is shorted. With all simplifying assumptions the MFC in SSD circuit acts as
a spring, which is repositioned after each half-cycle so it always generates force that
is opposite to the velocity.
SSDI circuits, instead of zeroing voltage on MFC element, reverse the voltage
polarity using a LC resonant circuit (Fig. 4.11). The MFC element is used as the
capacitor, and an inductor is added to the circuit. By shorting charged capacitor and
inductor, the current starts flowing. When the capacitor is fully discharged all re￾covered energy is stored in the inductor. Then, the inductor acts as a current source
and recharges the capacitor with a reversed polarity, and then unless this process is
stopped, the voltage on capacitor induces the undesired current flow in the opposite
direction. Stopping, when the capacitor is fully charged in opposite polarity, can be
performed by opening the circuit or by allowing the current to flow in one direction
only, which can be implemented by using a diode (Fig. 4.12). Unfortunately, some
energy is lost on the diode. Additionally, some energy is lost on resistive elements
[108].
The SSDI switching law can be written as:
If fMFC(t)
dx(t)
dt > 0 Then

The piezoelectric force and velocity should have opposite polarity, otherwise the122 Noise-Controlling Casings

piezoelectric force polarity must be changed. The piezoelectric force is not mea￾sured, but can be estimated using voltage, from Eq. (4.10). The switching law can be
rewritten as:
If uMFC(t)
dx(t)
dt < 0 Then
Switch Polarity;
This switching law requires measurement of both MFC voltage and velocity. It can
be also rewritten as:
If dx(t)
dt > 0 Then
Set uMFC(t) to Positive;
Else
Set uMFC(t) to Negative;
The “Set uMFC(t) to Negative/Positive” can be implemented in hardware, by using
two diodes and two switches (Fig. 4.13).
If SW1 is short and SW2 is open, then it is guaranteed that the voltage on MFC
is non-positive (assuming ideal diode). If it is negative then the diode D2 is reverse
biased. If the voltage is positive then diode D1 is forward biased, and the polarity
switch occurs. If SW1 is open and SW2 is short, then it is guaranteed that the voltage
on MFC is non-negative. To the switching law it can be rewritten as:
If dx(t)
dt > 0 Then
SW1 ← Open, SW2 ← Short;
Else
SW1 ← Short, SW2 ← Open;Passive control 123

Thus, the switching law can be rewritten as:
If duMFC,i

dt > 0 Then
SW1 ← Open, SW2 ← Short;
Else
SW1 ← Short, SW2 ← Open;
The above switching law effectively detects extreme values of uMFC,i(t). Alterna￾tively, extreme values can be detected using a comparison between current value and
maximum value in the near past. Such switching law can be implemented using a pair
of transistors used as comparators and a pair of capacitors with diodes to detect max￾imum/minimum voltage (Fig. 4.14). It is a modified version of the solution proposed
by Wei et al. [162]. This circuit implements the following pseudocode:
If uMFC,i(t) > UMAX(t)−UBE Then
SW1 ← Open;
Else
SW1 ← Short;
If uMFC,i(t) < UMIN(t) +UBE Then
SW2 ← Open;
Else

The circuit measures voltage on the piezoelectric element and based on the current

change of the sign of the velocity and the circuit should be switched to discharge of
the piezoelectric capacitance.
4.3.3 CONTROL RESULTS
In the first experiment three types of circuits were compared: open (Fig. 4.15(a)),
short (Fig. 4.15(b)), and SSDI (Fig. 4.15(c)). In the second experiment the open case
was not available and was omitted.
In the open circuit the MFC remains stiff and absorbs mechanical energy from the
vibrating structure. In the short circuit the energy is dissipated from internal capac￾itance of the piezoelectric element similarly to discharging of the capacitor, and the
MFC becomes flexible. The SSDI circuit switches between those two states [33].
Thus, with properly selected time of switching, the improvement of the vibration
damping is expected.
Before the experiments the mode shapes and corresponding resonant frequencies of
the steel and aluminium panels were identified. The first of the main experiments wasPassive control 125

focused on the (3,3) mode corresponding to frequency of 155 Hz. However, as the
temperature in laboratory changes, the resonant frequencies also change. Hence, the
excitation signal was emitted as a sequence of single tonal components from 143 to
163 Hz with 0.1 Hz step. In this experiment a (3,3) mode was observed at 160.1 Hz.
The Power Spectral Density (PSD) is presented in Fig. 4.16.
The amplitudes for open and short circuits are similar, however, a frequency dif￾ference is observed. It may result from MFC properties in both states. In the open
state MFC remains stiff, and the resonant frequency increases. In the short state the
MFC is flexible, however, it is still present as an additional mass on the vibrating
panel. For the SSDI a 3.5 dB vibration reduction is observed. In Fig. 4.17 the dis￾placement of the vibrating structure for investigated frequency is presented. It is
observed that the front panel’s displacement for the short circuit is higher than for
the open circuit. However, for the SSDI the displacement is around 18 % lower than
for the open circuit.
Fig. 4.18 shows the measured signal powers from the second experiment. The
shunt system provides up to 4.8 dB (at 162.2 Hz) velocity reduction. Above that
frequency the noise reduction sharply drops to ca. 3.8 dB. For high frequencies the
SSDI system increases vibrations. The SSDI system provides also noise reduction.
Some noise reduction is observed on all microphones close to the casing: up to 2.8 dB
at M1, up to 8.0 dB at M2, up to 3.4 dB at M3, up to 2.8 dB at M4. At distant
microphones some coincidental noise reduction is observed for higher frequencies,
but in the resonant band the peak noise reduction is equal to 0.2 dB at M5 and ab.
1.8 dB at M6.
Fig. 4.19 shows the measured velocity attenuation level for a different excitation
levels at open circuit resonance. For low excitation levels the voltage on MFCs is126 Noise-Controlling Casings

too small for the passive SSDI circuit. The reverse-polarity protection diodes, max￾ima detector and bipolar transistors used as the switch require high-enough voltage
to operate correctly. The voltage drop on those elements causes additional losses
and less energy after switching. At high excitation levels the voltage is high and a
near-constant voltage drop on those element has less effect, and both the switching
efficiency and performance increases. However, for excitation levels above −1 dB
the performance drops. This performance drop is related to spurious switching. C2
and C3 capacitors try to address that problem. The values of C2 and C3 capacitors
were chosen based on SPICE simulations [108]. Higher values could reduce that
problem, but they also increase a capacitive load on the MFC elements and effec￾tively reduce the voltage. Thus, the C2 and C3 are the compromise. Without them,
the performance drops earlier, at levels above −7 dB.
4.4 COMPOSITE STRUCTURES
Apart from the conventional materials such as steel and aluminium typically utilized
for constructing casings as well as their vibrating panels, composite structures have
been found to be very useful materials for noise reduction especially in the high fre￾quency regions (i.e. above 1000 Hz). For this reason, they are very suitable for vibro￾acoustic problems involving passive structural control. Moreover, they have high
internal damping over their conventional metallic counterpart which makes them
attractive in industrial application involving the reduction of vibration due to reso￾nance. Typical amongst these composites are the laminate composites and fibrous
composites. However, investigation showed that they are less effective in transmit￾ting sound losses at low frequencies than their conventional metallic counterpart. The
probable reasons for this limitation could be attributed to the effect of mass law andPassive control 127

also, during vibroacoustic process, the coincident region of composite panel has the
proclivity to excessively extend over higher frequencies.
Composite materials are lightweight and can be used for single-panel, double￾panels, and multi-panels of vibrating structures. Single panels face-sheets are con￾structed by laminates and the face-sheets can be doubled or tripled, where the cores
in between the face-sheets may be sandwiched or architecturally designed. The core
may take the form of air (i.e. equivalent to spring connection), foam (or poroelastic
material) or lattice/truss structures as shown in Fig. 4.20. The lattice structures which
may be architecturally complex can also be made of composites and a very good way
to fabricate this is through additive manufacturing or 3D printing. In Fig. 4.20, the
incident and radiating face-sheets panels are made from composites with different
cavity or core structures. During vibroacoustic analysis, three different sound trans￾mission routes are taken into consideration. The first is the incident region which
gives the incident and reflected sound waves. The second is the core or cavity region,
in which there exist the positive and negative going sound waves being transmitted to
the panels. Finally, in the radiating region, only one transmitted sound wave exists.
Composite double panel walls could have either orthotropic or anisotropic prop￾erties. The governing equation of an orthotropic sandwich panel with isotropic core
have been formulated by Renji and Nair [148] as

structure, the governing equation can be obtained using the Hamilton’s principle as
applied by Li et al. [89]. The Hamilton’s principle is written asPassive control 129

4.4.1 FUNCTIONALLY GRADED MATERIALS
Another special form of composite material is the Functionally Graded Material
(FGM) which has shown great potential for constructing structural panels used for
noise reduction and control.
The FGM are engineering materials which are manufactured in such a way that
their microstructures are patterned or arranged in a graded form. Gradation of the
microstructures can be laterally, axially or longitudinally patterned. The unique ad￾vantage of FGM over other types of composite materials are that they have very
strong bonding coupled, as well as low stress concentration of the material due to
the smooth variation at their interface. Fig. 4.21 compares a typical FGM and their
composite laminate counterpart. The microstructures of the FGM are graded from
a higher concentration to a lesser concentration to give it an improved mechanicalPassive control 131
property. The composite laminates on the other hand, have lower mechanical prop￾erty which is caused by the interactions of the laminates on each interface.

problems (a) FGM showing the microstructure with smooth graded variation and (b) compos￾ite laminates showing variations with sharp interfaces [63]. Reprinted from Applied Sciences,

from MDPI (STM).
Fig. 4.22 shows a typical vibroacoustic problem of a FGM panel. Just like any
other noise vibrating panel, the FGM panel is placed inside a casing with a loud￾speaker producing the sound wave. The incident sound wave passes through the
graded thickness z and radiate sound wave at the radiating surface. In Fig. 4.22, the
constituents of FGM are aluminium (Al) and ceramic alumina (Al2O3). In the con￾struction of FGM panel, it is assumed that each graded part is governed by similar
material properties such as the Poisson ratio, Young’s modulus and density. For this
reason, effective material properties have to be calculated. Eqs. (4.28), (4.29) and
(4.30) gives the effective Young’s modulus, density and Poisson ratio, respectively.
Eef(z) = (Ecr −EAl)Vcr +EAl (4.28)
ρef(z) = (ρcr −ρAl)Vcr +ρAl (4.29)
µef(z) = (µcr − µAl)Vcr + µAl (4.30)
The effective material properties are linear expressions derived using the Voigt’s
rule of mixture. Where the terms Ecr, EAl and Vcr are the Young’s moduli of ceramic,
aluminium and volume fraction of ceramics, respectively. Also, ρcr and ρAl are den￾sities of the ceramic and aluminium, respectively; while µcr and µAl are the Poisson
ratio of ceramic and aluminium, respectively. The subscript symbols, cr and Al, rep￾resent ceramic and aluminium, respectively. The volume fractions of ceramic and
aluminium sum up to unity by applying the rule of mixture given by [64]132 Noise-Controlling Casings
Vcr +VAl = 1 (4.31)
Various ways have been established to obtain the volume fraction of ceramics Vcr
of Eq. (4.31). However, a very convenient way to obtain Vcr along the FGM panel’s
thickness is by applying the simple power law distribution calculated as [157]

can be gotten by evaluating the distance from the mid￾surface of the FGM panel as shown in Fig. 4.22. Moreover, the term i, typifies the
volume fraction index which essentially governs the gradation profile along the thick￾ness of the graded structural panel as illustrated in Fig. 4.23. The value of the fraction
index can vary from zero (0) to infinity (∞). In Fig. 4.23, i varies from 0.2 to 20. The
isotropic and homogeneous characteristics of the FGM is attained when the value of
i is zero or infinity.

its thickness.
4.4.2 HYBRID COMPOSITES
Composite material typically consists of a reinforcement fibre and a matrix resin. The
reinforcement fibre can be obtained naturally or through synthetic process. Hybrid
composites, which include two or more composite materials architecturally joined
together, can be used to form vibroacoustic panels for sound analyses and noise con￾trol. Consider a simple hybrid composites panel having the same matrix as illustrated
in Fig. 4.24. The first composite material contains fibre a, while the second contains
fibre b both having a hybrid property given as
Qh = QaVha +QbVhb (4.33)
Where Qa and Qb are properties of fibre a and fibre b, respectively. As defined in
the previous section, the volume fraction of fibre a, (Vha) and fibre b (Vhb) also sum
up to unity using the rule of mixture given asPassive control 133
Figure 4.23 Plot of Vcr against z
h
for different i values of FGM panel according to Eq. (4.32).
Vha +Vhb = 1 (4.34)
As these volume fractions vary, the longitudinal modulus of the two fibres making
up the hybrid composites also vary. Let Ea and Eb represent the respective longitudi￾nal modulus of the two fibres. By the rule of hybrid mixture, the longitudinal modulus
of the hybrid property can be written as
EL = EaVha +EbVhb +EmV m (4.35)
Where the new term, Em and Vm are the longitudinal modulus and volume fraction
of the matrix, respectively.
Figure 4.24 Schematic representation of a simple hybrid composites structure.134 Noise-Controlling Casings
Using the Halpin-Tsai equation [3], the transverse modulus ET for hybrid com￾posites with respect to their arrangement coefficient κ can be written as

In a similar way, for the hybrid composite, the effective Poisson ratio, density and
Young’s modulus according to the hybrid rule of mixture are respectively given as
µef = µaVa + µbVb + µmV m (4.38)
ρef = ρaVa +ρbVb +ρmV m
(4.39)
Eef = EL +ET (4.40)
Where µa, ρa and µb, ρb are the Poisson ratio, density of fibre a and Poisson ratio,
density of fibre b, respectively. Also, µm and ρm are the Poisson ratio and density of
the matrix resin, respectively. In a similar way of Eq. (4.36), the shear moduli, i.e.
G12, G13 and G23 can be derived using the Halpin-Tsai relation given by

4.5 SUMMARY
Solutions presented in this chapter are characterized by a common feature: they do
not require any external source of energy. In many applications, it is not only attrac￾tive, but strictly required.
The first approach proposed shaping of structural and acoustic responses of noise
barriers in order to enhance their transmission loss. If the spectrum of the noise is
known, the responses of the barrier can be optimized accordingly. The alteration of
responses is achieved by attaching additional passive components: masses or ribs.
The second approach employs shunt circuit better known for semi-active control
systems, but in the proposed architecture the energy needed to switch MFCs proper￾ties is harvested from the vibrations of the barrier. Hence, no external power supply
is needed.
The third solution is based on composite structures, which due to inhomogeneous
structure offer valuable acoustic properties not available for regular materials. Con￾sidered materials include, inter alia, functionally graded materials and composite
materials typically consisting of a reinforcement fibre and a matrix resin.
It is noteworthy that the discussed solutions can be employed together with other
control systems, including both semi-active and active, creating a hybrid system.Taylor & Francis

5.1 INTRODUCTION
People in modern society are often exposed to excessive acoustic noise and, as a
result, a variety of noise reduction methods have been developed [68]. One such ap￾proach is to separate the recipients from the noise source using noise barriers. Com￾monly used passive barriers are generally ineffective for low-frequency noise (see
Chapter 4). They also tend to be thick and heavy and introduce unwanted heat insu￾lation. However, thanks to technological advancement, passive barriers can be com￾plemented with or replaced by actively controlled barriers. They incorporate control
sources that may be either acoustic, such as loudspeakers, or structural, such as vi￾bration actuators. Such systems are most effective in the low-frequency range, where
passive insulation fails. Actively controlled barriers have proven their effectiveness
in a number of publications (see Chapter 6). However, when the availability of high￾performance processors and energy sources is limited, it can be beneficial to adopt
a semi-active solution instead. The semi-active barrier adjusts the characteristics of
the structure itself with a small external energy supply [98]. It can offer considerable
levels of noise reduction in a highly effective and economical manner.
5.2 SWITCHED MECHANICAL LINKS FOR DOUBLE PANELS
Double-panel structures can be used as a base to design semi-active noise barri￾ers [175]. Double-wall structures have been widely used in aircraft fuselages, car
doors and lightweight partition walls in buildings because they offer significantly
higher passive transmission loss compared to equivalent single-wall structures. How￾ever, their acoustic performance deteriorates rapidly at low frequencies due to low
order structural-acoustic resonances. So called mass-air-mass resonance is particu￾larly responsible for the weak passive transmission loss [67, 183]. This is the fre￾quency range where control systems can offer significant enhancement. This topic
has gained a high interest in recent years. Langfeldt et al. considered a broadband
low-frequency sound transmission loss improvement of double walls due to appli￾cation of Helmholtz resonators [83]. De Melo Filho et al. studied dynamic mass
based sound transmission loss prediction of vibroacoustic metamaterial double pan￾els applied to the mass-air-mass resonance [39]. Mao investigated an improvement
on sound transmission loss through a double-plate structure by using electromag￾netic shunt damper [96]. Ma et al. analysed an active control of sound transmission
through orthogonally rib stiffened double-panel structure [95]. In addition, double￾panel structures enable application of a wide variety of control approaches, includ￾ing (i) methods aimed at reduction of panel vibrations to reduce the acoustic radia￾tion, and (ii) methods aimed at reduction of the acoustic response in the gap cavity
to block the sound transmission. The first group consists of, e.g. tunable vibration
DOI: 10.1201/9781003273806-5 137138 Noise-Controlling Casings
absorbers [158] and piezoelectric patches with shunt circuits. Gardonio et al. inves￾tigated a panel with self-tuning shunted piezoelectric patches for broadband flexural
vibration control [51]. Billon et al. studied vibration isolation and damping using
a piezoelectric flextensional suspension with a negative capacitance shunt [10]. Dal
Bo et al. considered a smart panel with sweeping and switching piezoelectric patch
vibration absorbers [36]. On the other hand, the second group includes, e.g. adaptive
Helmholtz resonators [83, 97] and shunted loudspeakers located in the gap cavity
between the panels [91].
The research presented in this section investigates a novel semi-active approach
for double-panel noise barriers (as described in [175]). The proposed solution can
significantly enhance the effective transmission loss, while being significantly lighter
and requiring less space compared to vibration absorbers or Helmholtz resonators
(which can be bulky when tuned for low frequencies). Meanwhile, it is less demand￾ing in terms of system complexity as compared with a fully active approach. The
solution is based on bistable links mounted between the incident and the radiat￾ing panels, which structurally couple (when turned on) or decouple (when turned
off). Such semi-active links only require energy for switching between the states.
They do not force vibration by themselves and hence the solution is semi-active.
The structural couplings that have been introduced significantly alter the natural fre￾quencies and mode shapes of the vibroacoustic system. This enables an adaptation
of frequency-dependent transmission loss to the noise spectrum, which can be easily
monitored, i.e. minimizing the radiation in the targeted frequency bands (especially
in the vicinity of low-order resonances). Such an approach aims at an efficient reduc￾tion of transmission of non-stationary narrow-band noise, which is very common in
real-life.
5.2.1 HARDWARE PLATFORM
This section presents an experimental setup of a double-panel barrier [175]. It eval￾uates both the designed semi-active actuators and the proposed approach to control.
Photographs of the laboratory setup are shown in Fig. 5.1. The enclosure was built as
a heavily reinforced-concrete box, of which the walls can be considered as acousti￾cally rigid. A loudspeaker was placed inside the enclosure as a noise source. For the
purpose of model verification, the loudspeaker was driven to generate band-limited
white noise. Two rectangular steel plates were attached to the front of the enclosure
at a distance of Lg,z = 0.080 m. The concrete walls of the box provided a high noise
attenuation, hence most of the acoustic energy, which was transmitted outside the
box, was transmitted through the panels. The dimensions of each panel area that was
free to vibrate (i.e. the area inside the clamping frame) are 0.420 m × 0.390 m.
A scheme and a photograph of the setup of the semi-active link are shown in
Fig. 5.2. In Fig. 5.2(a), each component described has the name of a panel to which
it is attached denoted in parentheses, when the link is turned off (decoupled). The
masses of ith semi-active link components are mLa,i = 0.043 kg and mLb,i = 0.013 kg.
Both ends of the link are attached to the panels with neodymium magnets. To change
the state of the link, the motor either rotates the brake counter-clockwise to hold theSemi-active control 139
pin inside the main block (coupling panels) or rotates it clockwise to release the pin
and allow it to move freely inside the main block. The motor only requires energy for
a short time in order to switch between states, otherwise the system is self-locking.
Pressure springs under the main block push the brake block down, ensuring that,
when turned on, the brake holds the pin firmly. The pin is covered with a layer of
PTFE to minimize friction when the link is turned off. Most of the components are

made of stainless steel or aluminium, so the permanent magnets used for mounting
the link to panels do not introduce additional forces acting on panels.
5.2.2 CONTROL ALGORITHM
The mass-air-mass resonance, when both panels vibrate out-of-phase with mode
shapes (1,1), is particularly responsible for noise transmission through double-panel
barriers [38, 39, 175]. Hence, the semi-active link was attached to the centres of the
panels to have the highest impact on the mass-air-mass resonance (its mode shape
have the highest displacement of the panels at their centres). The frequency char￾acteristics of the mean vibration velocity of panel b and the mean squared external
acoustic pressure are presented in Fig. 5.3. The adopted dB reference is equal to one,
i.e. the frequency responses present the measured signal magnitude in the logarith￾mic scale without any additional normalization. However, to give a feeling about the
experiments, the Sound Pressure Level of the noise in the room was between 75 dB

a comparison of a double panel with the semi-active link turned off and on. Plots (c) and (d)
show a comparison of a double panel without the link and with the optimally controlled semi￾active link [175]. Reprinted from Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 154:107542,

and 85 dB. Vibration measurements of the panel were taken point-by-point with the
vibrometer over a uniform grid of 22 × 20 points, giving a total of 440 points, spaced
at intervals of 0.02 m, hence covering the whole surface of panel b. After completing
the measurements, the frequency analysis for all points was performed, and the mean
vibration velocity was obtained by averaging all obtained frequency characteristics.
The mean squared external acoustic pressure was calculated analogously by aver￾aging frequency characteristics obtained with the microphones over the rectangular
measurement grid, 1.00 m wide and 0.76 m high, 0.1 m away from the surface of
panel b.
It follows from the analysis of Figs. 5.3(a) and (b) that the activation of the link
strongly alters the frequency response of the barrier. What is most noticeable, is that
the aforementioned mass-air-mass resonance is relocated from 78 Hz to 140 Hz. It
is very beneficial from the point of view of semi-active control. For example, to
minimize the acoustic pressure due to noise transmitted through the barrier, the link
should be turned on for tonal noise frequencies below 90 Hz, and turned off for
frequencies between 90 Hz and 160 Hz (with some exceptions for narrow resonance
peaks at 97 Hz and 100 Hz). Assuming that the noise is mainly tonal, although,

panels are of the same thickness equal to 1 mm [175]. Reprinted from Mechanical Systems
and Signal Processing, 154:107542, S. Wrona, M. Pawelczyk, and L. Cheng, “Semi-active
links in double-panel noise barriers”, Copyright (2022), with permission from Elsevier.142 Noise-Controlling Casings
it can be non-stationary, such action can reduce the mean acoustic pressure due to
transmitted noise by even more than 16 dB. Thus, the objective is to protect the
structure against excitation of the low-order structural-acoustic resonances, not to
truly attenuate them (it would require much more energy). Shifting the resonances
“away from the noise spectrum” in the frequency domain with semi-active elements
is a much more efficient approach, as long as the noise is tonal or narrow-band, thus
there are frequency bands where the resonances can be safely shifted to. Otherwise,
for a broadband noise this approach would generally be not suitable, however, such
cases are out of the scope of the proposed method.
The frequency characteristics for the “optimally controlled link” are presented
in Figs. 5.3(c) and (d). The “optimally controlled link” means that the semi-active
link is turned on or off, depending on which frequency characteristic is better for a
given frequency (the minimum of both “on” and “off” characteristics is taken). The
binary output controlling the link should be generated automatically by a controller.
The controller is responsible to choose the more beneficial frequency response of the
barrier according to a predefined cost function and the continuously monitored noise
spectrum. The presented results assume a scenario where the noise is purely tonal. It
is a simplification and the real noise might be more complex, however, it is assumed
that in the targeted applications a single tone (or a narrow-band noise) is dominating
the noise spectrum, thus the presented behaviour of avoidance of resonances excita￾tion should be achievable in practice.
Obtained “optimal” characteristics are compared with a double-panel barrier
without the link (unloaded panels) for a better evaluation of the provided perfor￾mance. The total mass of the semi-active link is 0.056 kg, while both panels of the
considered barrier weight 2.57 kg. The semi-active link increases the overall mass of
the barrier by only approximately 2%. Hence, the mass of the link has a negligible
impact on the noise reduction and the obtained noise reduction is a results of switch￾ing the link, hence choosing a more beneficial frequency response of the barrier for
particular noise frequency.
It follows from the analysis that for most frequencies a barrier with just one semi￾active link can provide better noise reduction of sound than the unloaded barrier
without the link. Hence, it is worth exploring what performance could be achieved
with other arrangements of panels and links. This concept is undertaken in the nu￾merical simulation studies presented in the following section, basing on the already
derived and validated mathematical model.
5.2.3 CONTROL RESULTS
A semi-active link in the centre of the panels
First, a scenario already analysed experimentally in Subsection 5.2.2 is once again
considered using the simulation environment (as presented in [175]). The frequency
characteristics obtained are presented in Fig. 5.4; the results are presented in an
analogous manner as in Fig. 5.3. Both Figs. 5.3 and 5.4 are very consistent, espe￾cially regarding the main points, once again confirming the model accuracy. First,Semi-active control 143
the simulations presented also show that the semi-active link located in the center of
the panels enables efficient mitigation of the mass-air-mass resonance originally lo￾cated around 90 Hz (the excitation of the mass-air-mass resonance can be completely
avoided due to switching of the semi-active link, what would not be possible with
an addition of only a static mass). However, the fundamental mode (1,1) with panels
vibrating in-phase is difficult to reduce in such a configuration when panels are of
the same thickness. Moreover, the semi-active control enables the reduction of noise
transmission for several other higher resonances. Some bands are slightly enhanced
compared to the unloaded double-panel structure (e.g. around 170 Hz). However, the
bands with successful noise reduction outweighs them.
A semi-active link with panels of different thickness
In this simulation, the thickness of panel a was increased from 1 mm to 2 mm.
The frequency characteristics obtained are presented in Fig. 5.5. The first important

Elsevier.144 Noise-Controlling Casings
conclusion is that for a double-panel barrier with panels of different thicknesses, the
semi-active link is able to change, thus reducing the fundamental frequency, i.e. when
both panels vibrate in-phase with mode shape (1,1). The mass-air-mass resonance is
mitigated in a similar manner to symmetric panel configuration. The noise transmis￾sion in the remaining part of the frequency band being considered remains rather
similar to the symmetric configuration. Thus, it shows that asymmetric configuration
is substantially more beneficial compared to the symmetric one.
A link with additional mass
If a symmetric double-panel barrier configuration has to be employed for any reason,
e.g. the application of a semi-active control system to an already existing structure,
an additional passive mass can be added to one of the panels to alter its natural
frequencies and help mitigate the fundamental frequency with the semi-active link.
The simulation results obtained for symmetric panels with a passive mass of 0.25
kg attached to panel b at its centre are given in Fig. 5.6. Although the asymmetric

panels are of the same thickness equal to 1 mm, but an additional mass of 0.25 kg is attached
to panel b at its centre [175]. Reprinted from Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,

barriers”, Copyright (2022), with permission from Elsevier.Semi-active control 145
configuration, whenever possible, still seems to be a better choice, the addition of
mass to one of the panels definitely helps in reduction of the fundamental mode; for
the case considered, 7 dB more reduction of mean external acoustic pressure can
be obtained compared to the case without the additional mass. An alternative could
be to attach an additional stiffener to panel b as in [171, 176], instead of additional
mass, in order to alter the fundamental mode frequency of one of the panels.
Three semi-active links
Finally, a scenario is considered with three semi-active links introduced into the gap
cavity. The number of three links was arbitrarily chosen in order to explore the option
of increasing the number of semi-active links, while maintaining still a reasonable
number of them for practical applications. In the example presented, their locations
have been arbitrarily chosen, however, a number of arrangements have been simu￾lated to validate the conclusion presented in this subsection. The simulation results
are given in Fig. 5.7. An asymmetric configuration with ha = 2 mm and hb = 1 mm
has been used. The links were located at:

a thickness ha = 2 mm [175]. Reprinted from Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,
154:107542, S. Wrona, M. Pawelczyk, and L. Cheng, “Semi-active links in double-panel noise
barriers”, Copyright (2022), with permission from Elsevier.146 Noise-Controlling Casings
xL,1 = 0.50La,x, yL,1 = 0.50La,y,
xL,2 = 0.83La,x, yL,2 = 0.50La,y,
xL,3 = 0.25La,x, yL,3 = 0.20La,y.
To determine which links are turned on, a vector KL = [KL,1 KL,2 KL,3] can be defined,
assuming that KL,i = 0N/m when the link is turned off, and KL,i = 106 N/m when
the link is turned on.
The analysis of Fig. 5.7 leads to a conclusion that both fundamental and mass-air￾mass resonances are successfully mitigated (as for a single link), but above a certain
frequency (in the example considered, above 200 Hz), a configuration with all links
turned off provides a continuously better performance; turning on any of the links
can only worsen the transmission loss. It is due to a phenomenon that for higher
frequencies the double-panel barrier itself provides good passive transmission loss,
and adding a structural link at any location, although altering frequencies and mode
shapes, enhances the overall energy transmission between the panels and generally
worsens the transmission loss; a structural energy transmission path, in addition to
the acoustic path, is added to the system.
In addition, comparing Figs. 5.5 and 5.7 leads to a conclusion, that the improve￾ment due to an increased number of semi-active links is rather weak. A single link
located at the centre of the panels is effective enough to mitigate low-order reso￾nances (fundamental and mass-air-mass resonances, which are most responsible for
weak transmission loss performance of the double-panel barrier). For higher reso￾nances, the links considered are not useful, hence addition of more links is rather
unjustified.
Summarizing the main conclusions, a single semi-active link located at the centre
of both panels can successfully mitigate low-order resonances reducing the acoustic
radiation of the barrier for narrow-band noise even by 16 dB. The external energy is
only needed to switch states of the link. Moreover, there is clearly an optimal range
of gap cavity depth Lg,z
, when both acoustic and structural energy transmission paths
are comparable, allowing the semi-active links to reach its best performance.
More links and different arrangements seem to be ineffective for improving higher
frequency insulation due to physical phenomena occurring in double-panel struc￾tures. Nevertheless, the proposed semi-active link can be used jointly with other types
of semi-active actuators that do not couple panels structurally, preserving the good
transmission loss for higher frequencies provided by the structure itself. Such alter￾native actuators could semi-actively adapt stiffness or mass distribution of a panel.
The semi-active link would then be responsible for the low-order resonances, while
other semi-active actuators would alter higher resonances. Such combined technique
would further develop the proposed semi-active approach.
5.3 COIL-BASED LINKS FOR DOUBLE PANELS
The coil-based link is a semi-active element, intended for damping of the transverse
vibrations of the surface elements [136]. In line with idea of semi-active methods
it does not require external energy to move the structure in a certain way, and theSemi-active control 147
stability of the system is ensured. It is also possible to apply a switching law similar
to piezoelectric elements. The provided energy is used only to supply the element to
keep its properties—in this case, i.e. stiffness. The element consists of iron casing
with rigidly mounted coil, and ferromagnetic rod moving freely and frictionless in￾side the coil. The coil is rigidly mounted to the vibrating surface (Fig. 5.8(a)) or to
the supporting element, and the ferromagnetic rod is rigidly attached perpendicular
(Fig. 5.8(b)) or parallel to the vibrating surface (Fig. 5.8(c)).
The lack of mechanical friction between the elements allows for a noiseless work.
Moreover, it is possible to mount the element in various configurations, adapted to
the application, including vibrations damping over a large area, dependently on the
length of the ferromagnetic core and the used coil. The simple construction of the
element allows to adjust maximal stroke of the ferromagnetic rod without impacting
the mechanical structure. Such element can change the mode shapes of the vibrating
structure, which influences the effectiveness of the structure’s acoustic emission.

5.3.1 HARDWARE PLATFORM
The idea of the coil-based link was implemented in the double-panel structure (DPS)
constituting the front wall of the rigid device casing. The other casing walls are 3 mm
thick plywood panels with additional bitumen layer to improve vibroacoustical insu￾lation. The investigated element is a modified push-pull solenoid with a coil mounted
on the incident (inner) panel of DPS by means of 3D-printed holder (Fig. 5.9(a)).
The core (Fig. 5.9(b)) was shortened and rigidly connected with the radiating (outer)
panel of DPS. The front wall of the rigid casing consists of 0.5 mm thick incident
and 0.6 mm thick radiating steel panels. The size of each panel is 460 mm×460 mm,148 Noise-Controlling Casings
and the cavity gap between the panels is 50 mm. In this gap, five coil-based links are
mounted: one at the centre of the cavity between the panels, and one in each corner
to change a stiffness of the couplings between the panels.

(c)
Figure 5.9 Single coil mounted on the panel (a), core (b), and five coils mounted on the
panel (c).
The parameters of push-pull solenoid are listed in Table 5.1. The values come
from manufacturer’s documentation. However, after the modifications of the solenoid
the parameters may have changed.
The stiffness of the element is changed by applying the voltage to the coil. Due
to the high current flowing through the coil it was decided to use Pulse-Width Mod￾ulation (PWM) controllers, based on the Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect
Transistors (MOSFETs). Thus, the force generated by the element is indirectly set
by change of the duty cycle of PWM signal. 0% of duty cycle corresponds to OFF
state, when the element is not supplied, and core moves freely inside the coil, andSemi-active control 149

99% of duty cycle corresponds to ON state, when the element has the maximal stiff￾ness and holds the core inside the coil in the same position. 100% of duty cycle was
not used due to the possibility of overheating the coil.
The measurement and control system (Fig. 5.10) consists of previously described
rigid frame casing with DPS. Inside the casing an active loudspeaker was placed to
excite the structure to vibrate, by emitting tonal signals with the frequencies depen￾dant on the type of experiment. The source of the signal was Direct Digital Synthe￾sis (DDS) generator. Measurements of vibrations of the DPS were acquired using
various types of the sensors: Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) structures, vision or in￾frared (IR) cameras, and Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). The data were stored,
processed and presented in NI LabVIEW graphical programming environment ded￾icated to build the measurement and control systems, especially based on the NI
devices. The PWM signal was provided to PWM controllers using NI myRIO auto￾matically (in standalone mode) or manually via the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
on the PC.
To ensure maximal efficiency of the coil-based links it was necessary to inves￾tigate how the mechanical properties of the element and parameters of the PWM
signal influence the generated force. Therefore, the force was measured dependently
on the following factors:
• duty cycle of PWM signal, varying from 0% to 100%,
• displacement between central points of the core and coil: 7 mm and 11 mm,
• frequency of the PWM signal: 500 Hz and 1 kHz,150 Noise-Controlling Casings
Figure 5.10 Scheme of the measurement and control system.
• coil’s voltage, varying from 9 V to 11 V with 1 V step.
The parameters listed above were combined into five different scenarios. Char￾acteristics of generated force obtained during the experiments are presented in
Fig. 5.11. Following colours correspond with specific combinations of parameters:
• dotted—displacement: 11 mm, PWM frequency: 1 kHz, voltage: 9 V,
• dot-dashed—displacement: 7 mm, PWM frequency: 500 Hz, voltage: 9 V,
• dashed—displacement: 7 mm, PWM frequency: 1 kHz, voltage: 9 V,
• solid grey—displacement: 7 mm, PWM frequency: 1 kHz, voltage: 10 V,
• solid black—displacement: 7 mm, PWM frequency: 1 kHz, voltage: 11 V.
The most important observation is that the maximal force, generated by the el￾ement, is three times less than the value declared by the manufacturer (Table 5.1).
On the one hand, as it was stated previously, the maximal voltage supplying the
coil was reduced to 11 V to avoid overheating of the coil. On the other hand, the
core was shortened to fit the element in cavity gap between the panels. The length
of core before modifications was optimal to generate an expected force. Moreover,
the displacement between central points of the core and coil has a crucial impact
on the efficiency of the element. It was observed in comparison of the blue and red
characteristics, where the only difference was the displacement. PWM frequency has
insignificant impact, while the coil’s voltage is important, however, not more than the
displacement.
5.3.2 CONTROL ALGORITHM
As mentioned in Section 5.3.1, the basic version of the system controlling the
solenoids allows to turn on or off the selected solenoids, as well as to modulate aSemi-active control 151
Figure 5.11 Force generated by the element dependently on duty cycle of PWM and selected
parameters.
voltage signal supplying the solenoid’s coils being the components of the coupling
points. To indirectly modify the stiffness of the proposed electromagnetic couplings,
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) method is employed. Signal of a peak-to-peak volt￾age equal to 11 V is modulated by change of duty cycle, which as a percentage
determines how much of each signal’s period the signal is on. PWM voltage sig￾nal’s duty cycle is modified and then the signal as a square wave supplies solenoid
coils. Depending on the duty cycle value, the induced electromagnetic force varies,
and thus the stiffness of double panel coupling changes. This in turn influences vi￾broacoustical properties of the double panel structure, what was observed during the
research experiments.
Another aspect of control in the described system which may be developed and
deployed as an improvement is the possibility to automatically change a number of
activated couplings and duty cycle of PWM signal, based on the research outcome
and experience gained from the previous experiments. Based on the obtained results,
a heuristic lookup table algorithm may be introduced for a control of electromagnetic
couplings to achieve the best results in terms of both noise and vibration reduction.
The optimal setup for specific inputs can be looked up in case of their known values,
which reduces computational burden.
For unknown values of the input features, one has to determine a way to esti￾mate output. One of the solutions is to employ machine learning methods to estimate
the best couplings’ setup based on the dataset consisting from the previous research
results. This can be achieved by means of open-source Python libraries such as scikit￾learn which provide tools to program various algorithms as well as to visualize the
predictions and the decision trees. Such approach depends heavily on a quality of
prepared dataset and on a proper splitting process. Any bias in the input sets may152 Noise-Controlling Casings
result in a poor performance for real-time samples. There exists the risk of under￾fitting or overfitting the model. However, in case of many possible combinations of
number of active couplings and duty cycle value, computational complexity of find￾ing the optimal solution may be unacceptable in the real use cases. Hence, to sim￾plify the problem, different algorithms may be employed to find acceptable output
estimates for the presented problem with good outcome metrics.
For instance, if the best setup of number of activated couplings and duty cycle
value is known for particular frequency and corresponding sound transmission loss
value, then for actual measurements of these two quantities one may predict the
best combination of activated couplings and duty cycle value in real time, taking
into account a delay added to the system due to the use of multi-output regression
algorithm. Such approach can be described in the form of scheme as in Fig. 5.12. This
idea may be extended to a higher number of input features. If the dataset is extended
in the meantime, flag in Fig. 5.12 is set to True and the metrics of the algorithm are
checked to eventually tune it automatically by means of a selected method. Tuning
process can also be done outside the loop.
Fig. 5.13 shows part of the decision tree which outputs number of activated cou￾plings and duty cycle value. They should be set based on the measured sound trans￾mission loss and noise frequency. Such tree may also be based on different kind
of features, such as vibration, as well as temperature and/or other environmental
conditions. Such approach may increase an accuracy of the proposed method with
assumption that all added features are significant.
Another use case of such methods may be a prediction of sound transmission loss,
power spectral density or other indicator of a vibroacoustical performance for a given
sound frequency based on the experimental dataset. Such approach may be helpful
in case of complex laboratory environments, which may be difficult to be modelled
numerically.
Fig. 5.14 presents an example of a simple tree of a decision tree regression al￾gorithm, where sound transmission loss value in dB may be estimated based on an
input frequency of noise. Depending on the depth of the tree, the accuracy of the
output value estimation changes. Such model, if tuned properly to find an optimal
tree depth, may help to predict the behaviour of the laboratory system.
5.3.3 CONTROL RESULTS
The coil-based link can be used to change the mode shapes of vibrating structure. The
experiments were performed for the fifth resonance. Four different scenarios were
assumed: switched off links, single, central link activated, corner links activated, and
five links activated. In Fig. 5.15 each scenario corresponds with each row. The results
are compared with simulations. The Chladni method with image enhancement was
originally adopted for this analysis using authors’ laboratory setup [151].
The first observation is that the mode shape for coil-based links is not symmetri￾cal. It may results from inequality of forces generated by the elements, because it was
not possible to ensure reliable method of the assembly of the element between the
panels, where the high precision is required. Despite such issue, it is observed thatSemi-active control 153
Figure 5.12 Algorithm scheme.
with activation of the single link the central area of the panel is more stiff
(Fig. 5.15(e)), which corresponds to simulations results (Fig. 5.15(d)). However, for
the four (Fig. 5.15(h)) and five (Fig. 5.15(k)) elements’ scenarios the shapes are
significantly deformed. The reason is the rapid temperature increase of the coil (Ta￾ble 5.2), which significantly worsens the link efficiency.
Moreover, such fluctuations of the temperature may cause the thermal expansion
of the steel plate in DPS and, in consequence, the resonance shifting to the lower
part of frequency range. Due to this issue the experiments were repeated using links
made from the solid magnets. It is observed, that asymmetry of the lower part of the
panel (Figs. 5.15(c) and (f)) is similar as for the coil-based links (Figs. 5.15(b) and
(e)). Thus, the main reason of such asymmetry is not inequality in generated forces,
as it was supposed, but the properties of the panel itself. However, the activation of
corner elements (Figs. 5.15(i) and (l)) caused the removal of asymmetry.154 Noise-Controlling Casings

Another approach to research on the double-panel structure with introduced mod￾ifications was focused on the double panel’s vibroacoustics. As the solenoids were
mounted between the panels of the double-panel structure, the goal of the research
experiments described below was to determine an influence of such modification
on vibroacoustics of the double panel [141]. As the sensors of vibration, Macro￾Fiber Composites (MFC) were used [140]. To examine acoustical performance of
the double panel, microphones as the sensors were employed. The results showed
that solenoids have a significant impact on the vibroacoustics of the double panel –
both as the mass loadings and as the active couplings stiffening connection point be￾tween the panels. As part of the research experiments, measurement were acquired
by means of MFC as the sensors. The signals were then processed to obtain Power
Spectral Density curves for each channel in each of the examined setups.
Figs. 5.16–5.20 present the minimal Power Spectral Density curves built from the
curves obtained for all scenarios available for the selected MFC channel. In each
figure, there are three subplots. First subplot presents minimal PSD curve built of the
curves obtained for five scenarios:
• zero activated couplings,
• 1 activated coupling supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to 25%,
• 1 activated coupling supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to 50%,
• 1 activated coupling supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to 75%,
• and 1 activated coupling supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to
99%.Semi-active control 155

• 5 activated couplings supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to 50%,
• 5 activated couplings supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to 75%,
• and 5 activated couplings supplied by PWM signal of duty cycle equal to
99%.

of the double panel. Minimal PSD estimate curve is of similar shape in all three sub￾plots. Higher PSD levels are observed between 60 Hz and 300 Hz. Each curve is built156 Noise-Controlling Casings

of all five scenarios’ curves, but for each subplot the order of the best setups at the
specific frequencies is different. If the setup with 0 activated couplings is considered,
its presence in the subplots is observed around the same frequency bands in most of
the cases, e.g. around 50 Hz, 120 Hz, 230 Hz and 275 Hz. Around these frequencies,
the most beneficial setup regarding vibration reduction around MFC no. 1 is not to
activate any couplings.
Fig. 5.17 presents a comparison of minimal PSD estimates for MFC no. 2 located
in the right upper corner of the double panel. As in Fig. 5.16, all curves are similar to
each other. This means that minimal PSD estimate of similar levels can be achieved
even if only 1 or 4 solenoids are activated. In each of the subplots, setup with duty
cycle set to 99% is the best solution over significantly wide frequency bands, e.g.
265–305 Hz for 1 activated solenoid or 370–405 Hz for 5 activated solenoids. In
Fig. 5.17 the similarities for setup with 0 activated couplings are not observed as in
Fig. 5.16. The order of setups is different although MFC no. 2 is placed symmetri￾cally to MFC no. 1 with respect to the vertical line at the panel’s centre.
Fig. 5.18 presents a comparison of minimal PSD estimates for MFC no. 3 located
at the centre of the double panel. In this case, minimal PSD estimates levels are
in general higher than in Figs. 5.16 and 5.17 at the low frequencies up to 250 Hz,
and around narrow 80 Hz frequency band they increase over −40 dB level. This is
expected as the double panel’s central area vibrates stronger than the areas located
near the corners, as the panels’ edges are fully clamped and in theory do not vibrate.
At the low frequencies, central area of the panel covers with nodes, not anti-nodes,158 Noise-Controlling Casings
Figure 5.16 Minimal PSD estimates built of the selected scenarios for MFC channel no. 1.
for most of the mode shapes. However, the PSD levels do not increase significantly,
which indicates a beneficial influence of the solenoids on vibration reduction. In all
three subplots, a significant decrease of PSD levels is observed at the frequencies
higher than 260 Hz. This is probably caused by the fact that at the higher frequencies
mode shapes of the vibrating panels include high amplitude peaks around central
area of the panels more frequently, and thus MFC no. 3 which is located at the panel’s
centre senses stronger vibration reduction. Most of the best scenarios at the higher
frequencies are the ones with one or more activated couplings.
Fig. 5.19 presents a comparison of minimal PSD estimates for MFC no. 4 located
in the left bottom corner of the double panel. PSD levels at the lower and higher
frequencies (up to and above 260 Hz) are similar to those observed in Figs. 5.16
and 5.17. However, the shapes of PSD minimal estimates slightly differ from those
obtained in cases of MFCs located in the upper corners of the double panel. The
widest frequency bands of one most beneficial setup are observed for duty cycle set
to 99% again.
Fig. 5.20 presents a comparison of minimal PSD estimates for MFC no. 5 located
in the right bottom corner of the double panel. Significant PSD level decrease is
observed over 300 Hz in each of three subplots. At most of the higher frequencies,
PSD level does not exceed −70 dB, which is not observed in Figs. 5.16 and 5.19.
Moreover, shapes of PSD estimates are different than for MFCs located in other cor￾ners of the double panel. Such difference may indicate undesirable panel’s asymme￾try, probably introduced during the manufacturing process. Such minor factors make
the whole laboratory environment more complex and harder to model. However, as
stated in Section 5.3.2, machine learning techniques may be applied so that the sys￾tem behaviour may be accurately predicted based on the large sets of experimental
data.Semi-active control 159

Another approach—to determine acoustical properties of the double panel—may
be to estimate its sound transmission loss based on the signals acquired by the mi￾crophones. Then, STL estimates can be compared for different scenarios. Fig. 5.21
presents three subplots. First subplot shows a difference between STL estimate ob￾tained for a scenario with 1 activated coupling and duty cycle equal to 99%, and a
scenario for zero activated couplings (a reference scenario). Second subplot shows
a difference between STL estimate obtained for a scenario with 4 activated cou￾plings and duty cycle equal to 99%, and a scenario for zero activated couplings.160 Noise-Controlling Casings

Figure 5.20 Minimal PSD estimates built of the selected scenarios for MFC channel no. 5.
Third subplot presents a difference between STL estimate obtained for a scenario
with 5 activated couplings and duty cycle equal to 99%, and a scenario for zero
activated couplings. All graphs are plotted within the same range of the axes. If se￾lected scenario with any activated couplings performs better than the reference one,
the difference—marked as green line—is above zero threshold level. In the opposite
case, the line is marked as red.
Comparison to the reference scenario shows that the number of activated cou￾plings is important if acoustical performance of the double panel is taken into
account. Although all three subplots contain components above and under theSemi-active control 161
threshold, STL improvement is observed within several frequency bands, especially
in the case of 1 activated coupling. In the first subplot, improvement of STL for 1 ac￾tivated coupling may exceed 20 dB. The most beneficial frequency band is 180–215
Hz. In theory, this is where mass-air-mass resonance frequency lies in case of the
presented double-panel structure (c.a. 184 Hz). Hence, in this particular case, STL is
improved around mass-air-mass resonance—which is perceived beneficial in terms
of overall acoustic performance of the double-panel structure.
Common narrow frequency bands where STL is improved by means of solenoids’
activation for all three subplots are i.a. around 70 Hz, 140 Hz, 330 Hz, 370 Hz and
430 Hz. However, there are also frequencies around which STL is worse by even 10
dB, e.g. 170 Hz, 220 Hz and 410 Hz.
Figure 5.21 Differences between STL estimates for the selected scenarios.
Presented control results prove that coil-based links coupling the double-panel
structure may be beneficial in terms of vibroacoustical properties improvement. Vi￾bration may be significantly reduced by setting proper combination of activated cou￾plings and duty cycle value. Acoustic performance of the double panel depends on
the use of solenoids as their activation may lead to STL increase or decrease, de￾pending on the selected setup and considered sound frequency.
As the presented laboratory environment is complex and many factors have to
be taken into account, a machine learning approach can be applied to obtain multi￾output prediction of vibroacoustic indicators, or suggested combination of number
of activated couplings and duty cycle value – depending on the use case.
5.4 MASS MOMENT OF INERTIA ACTUATOR
The effective transmission loss of noise barriers can be increased by altering mode
shapes and tuning resonances, shifting them away from the dominant part of the162 Noise-Controlling Casings
noise spectrum (as presented in [174]). Such adaptation has been performed using
fixed passive elements in Section 4.2. However, it has rarely been approached in a
semi-active manner, which allows a real-time tuning of panel response to the time￾varying requirements. The authors believe that the ability to adapt to changing condi￾tions would significantly enhance performance of the aforementioned noise barriers.
In the literature, related semi-active approaches have been proposed for earthquake
protection in civil structures [30, 29]. A sandwich plate with adjustable core layer
thickness has also been proposed. This method employs a compressible open-cell
foam core between panels and enables a compressible open-cell foam core between
panels and enabling the adjustment of the structure’s vibration behaviour by chang￾ing the core compression using different actuation pressures [44].
The method described in this section fills this gap and introduces a novel semi￾active actuator with a tunable mass moment of inertia, capable of modulating the
response of a panel during its operation [174]. The actuator is based on an additional
mass mounted on a guide (the body of the actuator), which is attached perpendic￾ularly to the surface of the panel. The movable mass can be shifted closer to or
further away from the panel surface, tuning its effective mass moment of inertia.
The proposed semi-active device only requires energy for shifting the movable mass,
otherwise the mass is self-blocked. The actuator can shift the resonant frequencies
and alter the mode shapes of the entire panel. These shapes determine the acoustic
radiation efficiency of particular modes [176].
The proposed actuator enables an adaptation of the frequency-dependent trans￾mission loss of a barrier to the current noise spectrum, e.g. the sound radiation of
the barrier can be minimized in the targeted frequency bands. Such an approach
is intended to the efficient reduction of transmission of non-stationary narrow-band
noise, which is commonly encountered in real-life, both in the case of industrial
devices and household appliances. The proposed solution can greatly enhance the
effective transmission loss of a barrier, while being significantly lighter and requir￾ing less space than vibration absorbers or Helmholtz resonators (which can be bulky
when tuned for low frequencies). Simultaneously, it is less demanding in terms of
system complexity and in energy required compared to a fully active approach.
When employing the proposed actuator, it is important to consider its placement
on the panel surface. Two cost functions are proposed and evaluated for optimization
of the location of the actuators. Depending on the objective of the considered ap￾plication, different placements and configurations of the actuator allow for optimal
performance. For this purpose, the concept of an equally weighted modal response is
introduced into the optimization process in order to provide more general solutions.
5.4.1 HARDWARE PLATFORM
A rectangular steel plate with a prototype of the proposed semi-active actuator was
used as a noise barrier for the method validation [174]. The plate was mounted to
a heavy concrete box and excited with a loudspeaker placed inside the box. The
loudspeaker was driven to generate a broadband, random noise (a band-limited white
noise). The concrete walls of the box provided high noise attenuation, and henceSemi-active control 163

most of the acoustic energy which was transmitted outside the box was transmitted
through the steel plate. The acoustic modes of the cavity inside the box affected to
some extent the acoustic excitation distribution over the panel, however, all of the vi￾bration modes of the panel, theoretically expected in the considered frequency range,
were excited enough to be captured with the laboratory equipment. A photograph of
the laboratory setup is shown in Fig. 5.22(a). The dimensions of the panel area that
was free to vibrate (i.e. the area inside the clamping frame) were 0.420 m × 0.390 m.
The schematic representation of the actuator prototype is presented in
Fig. 5.22(b). The body of the actuator was made from a poly-methyl methacry￾late (PMMA) tube, guiding the well-fitted movable mass inside it. The mass, with
a threaded hole inside, is shifted using a threaded rod, thus adjusting the distance
between the mass and the panel za,1. The threaded rod is rotated through a micro
motor and a belt transmission. The threaded rod is mounted in a ball bearing at the
base of the actuator. The actuator is attached to the panel surface using a neodymium
magnet, also attached to the base of the actuator. The micro motor is equipped with
an encoder allowing a precise determination of the movable mass current position.
Although the mechanical design of this prototype could still be improved, it is a clear
practical realization of the proposed type of semi-active actuator. The distance za,1
should be automatically adjusted by a dedicated controller, calculating the optimal
distance za,1 based on continuously monitored frequency spectrum of the noise [174].
5.4.2 CONTROL ALGORITHM
The proposed actuator can alter natural frequencies and mode shapes of the panel
by adjusting the distance za,1, as described in [174]. The underlying mechanisms164 Noise-Controlling Casings
behind this phenomena are based on increasing the modal mass of the modes with
the increased mass moment of inertia of the actuator. However, in order for the mass
moment of inertia of the actuator to affect the particular mode, the actuator should
“swing” while the mode vibrates. It is determined by the location of the actuator in
relation to the particular mode shape—the rotations of the panel surface are highest
at the nodal lines, while they are absent at the anti-nodes (at the anti-nodes the motion
of the panel surface is solely translational). The increase of the modal mass due to
actuator is local (not uniform), hence apart from shifting the natural frequency of the
mode, the mode shape is also altered in an irregular manner, what also effects the
modal acoustic radiation efficiency.
To evaluate the best possible performance, in the presented research, the best
transmission loss is selected a posteriori among all available za,1 values. In final
application, the optimal distance za,1 should be selected automatically in real-time
based on the noise spectrum and acquired frequency responses of the plate in func￾tion of za,1, however, at this stage it is considered out the scope.
5.4.3 CONTROL RESULTS
Simulations have been performed considering frequencies up to 300 Hz, thus in￾cluding approximately the first ten eigenmodes of the panel. For the unloaded panel,
frequency responses obtained from the model are shown in Fig. 5.23. The acoustic
response shown (denoted hereafter as A(·)) is the mean sound pressure amplitude
obtained by averaging over a uniform measurement grid of 26 × 20 points, giving
a total of 520 points, spaced at intervals of 0.04 m. The measurement grid was
1.00 m wide and 0.76 m high, and 0.1 m from the panel surface. This choice of

measurement grid follows from the experimental setup used for modelling valida￾tion, and is described in more detail in [176]. Such averaging provides a reliable
estimate of the overall acoustic radiation generated by the panel. The structural (vi￾bration) response shown is the mean vibration velocity obtained by averaging over a
measurement grid of 22 × 20 points, giving a total of 440 points, spaced at intervals
of 0.02 m, hence covering the whole surface of panel.
In all presented simulations, the excitation of the panel was obtained by directly
applying an equal excitation to all loaded structural modes, instead of explicitly sim￾ulating a specific acoustic or structural excitation. Thus, the obtained responses have
been named equally weighted modal responses, in order to better distinguish them
from usual system responses. Such approach is motivated by the objective to design
a barrier (or a sound source) dedicated for any kind of excitation (within the assumed
frequency band), which is unknown and theoretically can excite any of the modes.
Therefore, within the process of optimization of actuator’s location, all of the modes
should be well reflected in the simulated scenario in order to ensure that the actu￾ator is able to sufficiently influence each mode of the panel. Moreover, it has been
assessed that it is the best scenario to “prepare” the barrier and evaluate its perfor￾mance for any kind of excitation, providing a more general solution as the result of
the optimization process.
The movable mass is a replaceable component of the actuator and it can be
changed during the preparation phase to achieve a desired mass. In the optimiza￾tion process, the total mass of the semi-active actuator (including the body of the
device) is limited to a maximum value of 0.2 kg (15% of the panel weight, which
is equal to 1.3 kg). The real actuator used in the experimental setup may have some
imperfections compared to simulations, e.g. the total mass may slightly differ, the
distance of the centre of the mass of the actuator from the panel mid-plane za,1 may
differ to some extent, also the mounting may be not perfectly rigid, etc. However, the
achieved consistency between the simulations and experiments is high, hence, the
authors are confident that any potential inaccuracies should be small enough to not
affect the overall performance of the proposed solution. Nevertheless, for the semi￾active control purpose, experimental frequency responses should be used instead of
theoretically predicted ones to take into account any potential inaccuracies.
Having in mind potential practical applications, the control system should employ
as few actuators as possible to achieve the imposed objective. The simpler solution
is often more attractive. Hence, in the simulation studies, optimization is performed
for a single actuator, which proved to be sufficient for the considered objectives.
Nevertheless, more actuators can be considered as well to enhance the performance
further.
The distance za,1 is assumed to be adjustable in a range between 0.01 m and
0.10 m (in practice these limits will depend on the chosen configuration of the ac￾tuator and the setup as a whole). For the purpose of optimization, the continuous
domain of za,1 was discretized with a step size of 0.01 m, thus considering 10 possi￾ble settings of za,1 for the semi-active actuator. The aim of the optimization is to find
the optimal location for the actuator on the panel surface, considering all available166 Noise-Controlling Casings
settings of za,1. It is also assumed for optimization purposes that only a tonal noise
will be attenuated by the barrier, or that only a tonal sound should be emitted by the
panel. Thus, during the cost function evaluation, each frequency in the considered
range is evaluated individually (incremented by steps of 1 Hz and ranging up to 300
Hz) in choosing the most suitable setting of za,1.
A population-based memetic algorithm was used to carry out the optimization.
For each optimization process, the population consisted of 300 individuals (consid￾ered solutions), the maximum number of generations was set to 15, and the prob￾abilities of crossover, mutation and individual learning were 0.20, 0.30 and 0.06,
respectively. For a detailed introduction to memetic algorithms, please refer to [130].
SIMULATION STUDIES
The adopted scenario considers the panel used as a semi-active noise barrier [174],
which when excited should radiate noise to the environment on its other side as
little as possible (considering excitation originating from both air-borne sound and
structural vibrations). To this end, the acoustic radiation of the panel should be min￾imized over a wide frequency range. This objective is encapsulated in the following
cost function

where fmax is a maximum frequency limiting the frequency range of interest; and
A(f,za,1) is the mean sound pressure amplitude as a function of both frequency and
the parameter za,1 (calculated according to the approach presented in Chapter 3).
The cost function J1 takes into account the overall acoustic radiation of the panel. To
evaluate the cost function, the maximum frequency was set to fmax = 300 Hz.
The memetic algorithm achieved a solution with the actuator placed at xa,1 =
0.287 m, ya,1 = 0.098 m, with mass ma,1 = 0.081 kg. The results of this optimiza￾tion are shown in Figs. 5.24 and 5.25. To analyse the obtained configuration, it is
instructive to first consider Fig. 5.24, which presents all ten structural and acoustic
responses obtained for different values of za,1. The fundamental frequency gradually
decreases when za,1 increases. For the following modes it is less clear due to mode
superposition and changes in the order of peaks, however, similar phenomena occur.
In addition to shifting the natural frequencies, changing za,1 can also strongly affect
the amplitude of individual modes in the acoustic response due to the alteration of the
modal acoustic radiation efficiency. The modal acoustic power Pi of first ten eigen￾modes of the panel in relation to the distance za,1 has been compared in Table 5.3.
Also note that a shift in the distance za,1 has a stronger effect on modes, which have
nodal lines of their mode shapes near the actuator (the rotation amplitude of the panel
surface is highest at the nodal lines).
Having all of the acoustic responses stored, an optimal value of za,1 can be deter￾mined for each frequency. The optimal solution (obtained by taking a minimum value
of all responses for each frequency) is presented in Fig. 5.25 with a black solid line.
The individual responses for different za,1 are presented with a light grey colour forSemi-active control 167
reference, while the acoustic response of the unloaded panel (without the semi-active

of the unloaded panel, it can be seen that all of the strongest modes can be mitigated
by more than 10 dB, assuming a single tonal or narrowband excitation at a time. The
acoustic response of the panel can effectively be flattened by modifying the location
of the mass, and only residual peaks are left. In nearly the entire frequency range,

the optimal response of the loaded panel is lower than the response of the unloaded
panel. Thus the conclusion can be drawn that this semi-active control approach is
fully capable of avoiding the excitation of resonant frequencies of the whole panel
by using only a single semi-active actuator.

The cost function J2 results in the minimization of the acoustic radiation of the most
radiating modes. While the cost function J1 seeks for a wider trade-off and may allow
slight increase of the acoustic radiation in one band, in exchange for a bigger reduc￾tion in another band, the cost function J2 always takes into account only the highest
peak in the acoustic response. It leads to as flatten acoustic response as possible. The

been seen in Fig. 5.26 that the response is quite similar to the previous one, although
flattened even more at the expense of slight enhancements of the amplitude at some
specific frequencies. However, these enhancements are practically negligible, hence
the cost function J2 can potentially provide even better solutions depending on the
adopted objective.
It is worth mentioning that during practical operations, the individual responses of
the barrier for different distances za,1 can be stored in a look-up table and, if needed,
periodically experimentally recaptured in order to update the lookup table used for
choosing the optimal configuration of za,1.
REAL CONTROL EXPERIMENT
In this section additional verification experiments were performed for the optimal
configuration followed from cost function J1 (as presented in [174]). The laboratory
setup presented in Section 5.4.1 was used. The cost function J1, as shown in earlier
in this section, resulted in xa,1 = 0.287 m, ya,1 = 0.098 m, and ma,1 = 0.081 kg. Due
to relatively low total mass, the moving mass was comparable with the mass of the
actuator body. Hence, the range of za,1 was limited in practice to a range between
0.03 m and 0.10 m.
First, experimentally measured individual acoustic responses of the panel with
the actuator set for different za,1 are given in Fig. 5.27. The figure corresponds to170 Noise-Controlling Casings

simulation results given in Fig. 5.24. Although there are discrepancies, partially due
to uneven acoustic excitation, the predicted influence of the semi-active actuator ac￾tions is coherent with experimental results. Individual acoustic responses of the panel
without the actuator and with the actuator set for za,1 = 0.05 m are also compared with
theoretical predictions in Fig. 5.28.
It is noteworthy that the impact of changing za,1 decreases for increasing frequen￾cies. It is probably due to imperfect magnetic mounting (not perfectly rigid). A more
rigid design should mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, in the frequency range up to
300 Hz a single semi-active actuator was able to achieve considerable reduction, of￾ten exceeding 10 dB (cf. Fig. 5.29). Results presented in Fig. 5.29 correspond to
simulation results given in Fig. 5.25. The predicted results of the semi-active con￾trol are coherent with the experiments. The authors believe that these results clearly
present the potential of the proposed semi-active control approach.
This study shows that employment of even a single actuator provides substantial
benefits. However, the utilization of multiple actuators would introduce more degrees
of freedom and dimensions into the space of possible configurations of semi-active
actuators, thus further extending the capabilities of the proposed approach. In addi￾tion, the proposed approach can be used to support active noise barriers [107], e.g. to
enhance the controllability of inertial actuators for targeted frequency bands, thus
forming a hybrid active/semi-active control system.Semi-active control 171

5.5 SEMI-ACTIVE SHUNT SYSTEMS
In passive shunt systems it is difficult to achieve the full potential of such systems.
Some power obtained from mechanical circuit must be lost to drive switches and by
the circuit used to implement control algorithm. Complex control algorithms that the￾oretically should perform better in practice may perform worse because more power
is lost in the control circuit. In semi-active systems, the control circuit and switches
are powered from the external power source. In such systems more complex con￾trol algorithms may be used. The performance is additionally increased because the
energy from extracted from piezoelectric element is used only for conversion to me￾chanical energy. Unfortunately, some energy must be lost due to non-ideal elements.
When compared to classical active control systems, in semi-active shunt systems
high-voltage amplifiers are not needed to drive piezoelectric elements. Simple tran￾sistor keys are sufficient.

The laboratory setup is similar to the measurement and control system used in
experiment with passive shunt system. The aluminium panel with nine MFCs was
mounted on rigid frame and was excited to vibrations using active loudspeaker placed
inside the casing. The tonal signal used as an excitation was generated by the ded￾icated circuit, placed on the same PCB as semi-active SSDI implementation. Two￾way communication between the PCB and PC was implemented, thus, it was pos￾sible to control the whole system remotely. The measurement system is based on
the microphones and LDV, placed identically as in experiment with passive system.
The signals were pre-filtered using anti-aliasing filters, and acquired using dSpace
platform.
In the experiment, similarly as for the passive case, three types of circuits were
compared: open, short and SSDI. The MFC elements were connected in series and
the (1,3) and (3,1) modes were investigated.

The SSDI switching law is described in subsection 4.3.2. When the MFC voltage is
measured by the microcontroller the following variant of SSDI can be directly used

An alternative is to use extrema detection like in passive implementation. In a
microcontrolled-based implementation it is easier to solve some issues related non￾ideal operation of the circuit. Fig. 5.33 shows the voltage on the switch (V_SWITCH)
during negative-to-positive voltage transition. A simple maximum detector (or sys￾tem that use duMFC,i

) may detect a false maximum at 16 µs. Additionally, when the
switch is performed too early the voltage may still decrease, but switching voltage
back will introduce significant energy loss. Thus, disabling switching for some time
after each switch is beneficial. When this time is smaller than half-period of the sine
disturbance it will not cause any performance loss. In the semi-active implementation
of SSDI used on the casing this dead-time is equal to 1.5 ms.176 Noise-Controlling Casings

In implementation on the microprocessor it is easier to set an arbitrary threshold
used by the extrema detector. The passive implementation has this threshold equal
to transistor base-emitter voltage, ab. 0.7 V. In the semi-active implementation the
ADC quantum is equal to 89 mV (±110 V measurement range). However, due to
oversampling the effective quantum is equal to 28 mV. The threshold has been set to
316 mV.
5.5.3 CONTROL RESULTS
Figure 5.34 shows comparison of the performance of passive and semi-active SSDI
system for a different excitation frequencies with 0.1 Hz step. For each frequency
the power of all signals was measured for three systems: the system with MFC with
open terminals, the system with MFC with shorted terminals, and the semi-active178 Noise-Controlling Casings
SSDI system. Semi-active SSDI circuit provides vibration reduction up to 5.0 dB
compared to the short circuit (piezoelectric does not generate any force) and up to
4.7 dB compared to the open circuit. The noise reduction at frequencies close to
resonance is observed on all microphones. On some microphones, however, the res￾onance is not visible significantly. But, even for that microphones noise reduction is
visible and the sound power drops to levels lower than observed for frequencies far
from resonance.
Fig. 5.35 shows a comparison of the performance of passive and semi-active SSDI
systems for a different excitation frequencies. The semi-active system achieves bet￾ter vibration reduction and avoids vibration amplification that occurs at higher fre￾quencies for the semi-passive system. The semi-active system uses the same con￾trol law and similar algorithm to detect maximum voltage on MFC. However, the
microprocessor-based maxima detector used in semi-active system is slightly better,
especially more robust on noise and different events that occur after switching. The
microprocessor-based detector waits some time after switching and avoids undesired
switching caused by potential false maximas.
The performance of SSDI systems strongly depends on the excitation level.
Fig. 5.36 shows the measured velocity signal power for a different excitation lev￾els at open circuit resonance.
At lower excitation levels the voltage on piezoelectric element is too low for the
SSDI circuit to work correctly. Both the passive and semi-active systems have some
voltage drops on nonlinear elements on the side connected to MFC, and both use
diodes. The passive system uses the energy from MFC element also to supply the
switch implemented on bipolar transistors. The semi-active system uses external en￾ergy source to drive MOSFET switches and thus provides superior vibration reduc￾tion at lower excitation levels. At high levels the vibration reduction is comparable
because both the systems use the same control law. However, the performance of
semi-active system can be improved by implementing better maxima detection, with
lower delay. The semi-active system has no performance drop at very high excitation
levels.
5.6 SUMMARY
As it was shown in this chapter, there is a wide variety of semi-active control ap￾proaches that can be adopted for noise barriers, including especially noise-reducing
casings.
First, original solutions designed by the authors for double-panel walls are pre￾sented: switched mechanical and coil-based links. Both of them take advantage of
the cavity between panels and attempt to beneficially managing energy transfer be￾tween panels. Hence, the transmission loss of the noise barrier can be enhanced with
a low energy effort.
Second, solutions for individual panels are considered: mass moment of inertia
actuator and semi-active shunt system. They alter properties of the panel, reduc￾ing the noise transmission through it. They offer a considerable improvement, while
maintaining a low energy demand.6 Active control systems
6.1 INTRODUCTION
The third and last category of noise reduction methods considered in this monograph
are active solutions [129, 58, 138, 137]. They have a greater energy demand, but
achieve the highest levels of noise reduction. They most often consist of actuators,
sensors and a controller which, basing on the measurement signals, calculates the
control signals in accordance with the selected algorithm. The actuators and sensors
may be both acoustic (e.g. speakers and microphones) and structural (e.g. electro￾dynamic exciters and accelerometers). These systems introduce additional energy
directly into the system, but they do not have to completely eliminate system vibra￾tion. Often, it is enough to alter the vibration distribution appropriately to enhance
the effective insulation of the acoustic barrier.
6.2 HARDWARE PLATFORM
6.2.1 OPTIMIZATION OF ACTUATORS ARRANGEMENT
Active noise barriers exhibit many advantages over their passive counterparts, but
they have to be carefully implemented in order to operate efficiently and achieve
a high level of performance [135, 124, 50, 82, 173]. One of the critical aspects in
the design of an active barrier is the arrangement of the actuators, such that they are
able to effectively control the vibration of the plate that forms the noise barrier. It
is noteworthy that the optimization of the actuator arrangement is also an important
step in the design of systems where plates are intentionally designed to emit sound
[79].
Different techniques have been proposed over the years to optimize the arrange￾ment of actuators for control applications (as given in [173]). One approach primarily
focuses on selecting a control strategy and defining a performance index, and then si￾multaneously optimizing the locations of the actuators and the controller parameters.
Liu et al. [92] used a genetic algorithm and the spatial H2 norm of the closed-loop
system as the performance index. Arabyan and Chemishkian [25] presented a com￾putational method to design an H∞ controller and the corresponding optimal actuator
locations. Kumar et al. [81] considered the performance of an LQR controller as an
objective. Chhabra et al. [26] used the modified control matrix and the singular value
decomposition approach for optimal placement of piezoelectric actuators. However,
in such approaches, optimality of the obtained solution is dependent on the choice of
the control strategy.
Another approach concentrates on an open-loop system analysis, which is inde￾pendent of the controller choice. The controllability Gramian was used in the opti￾mization criterion by Leleu et al. [87]. Hale and Daraji [56] presented a modified H∞
DOI: 10.1201/9781003273806-6 179180 Noise-Controlling Casings
norm based method for the optimal placement of piezoelectric sensor/actuator pairs
mounted on a cantilever plate. The optimal placement of piezoelectric actuators for
active vibration control of a membrane structure using the controllability Gramian
and the particle swarm optimization algorithm was studied by Liu et al. [93].
The aforementioned studies provide methods for the optimization of actuator
locations mainly for the Active Vibration Control (AVC) of plates. Although the
same actuator configuration can also be used for Active Structural Acoustic Con￾trol (ASAC) as employed in active noise barriers [125, 126, 168, 28, 122], it is not
necessarily the optimum arrangement for this purpose. The optimization of the ac￾tuator arrangement for vibration control entails a search for a solution that generally
reaches a trade-off between controlling numerous modes of vibration. Some of these
structural modes may radiate sound efficiently, whilst others may vibrate consider￾ably without contributing strongly to the noise transmission or radiation; as a result,
these modes do not need to be controlled in the context of a noise barrier. There￾fore, in the context of noise-reducing casings, an acoustic radiation-based approach
to the optimization of the arrangement of actuators is proposed. A model of acous￾tic radiation is introduced into the optimization process and new cost functions are
formulated to focus on modes that are truly relevant to the overarching goal of the
barrier, which is to block the transmission of noise. The main contribution is thus
providing new insight into the optimization process that should be adopted for the
positioning of actuators in active noise barriers.
OPTIMIZATION PROCESS
In this section an optimization process is presented that aims to find the optimal
placement of a number of actuators mounted to a vibrating plate for the purpose of
active control. The objective of the control system is to reduce the noise radiated
from the acoustic enclosure via the Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) ap￾proach [106, 107]. In order to reach this goal, the control system should be able to
control the vibration modes of the plate in the frequency range of interest. The ability
to control the ith mode can be described by an element on the diagonal of the con￾trollability Gramian matrix, λc,i
, as derived in Section 3.2.2. However, some of the
vibrational modes are more important as they more strongly transmit or radiate noise
when excited; while other modes behave in the exactly opposite manner and can be
neglected, since they vibrate without strongly contributing to the radiated acoustic
field [173]. In order to reflect this behaviour, the modal acoustic power correspond￾ing to ith vibration mode of the plate, Pi
, can be used (cf. Section 3.2.2). Taking this
into account, an optimization problem defined by an appropriate cost function will
be presented, which will enable an optimal solution to be found for the arrangement
of the given actuators.
Optimization problem
The optimization variables defined for the considered problem are the coordinates of
a predefined number of actuators, Na. A flat rectangular plate is considered, henceActive control systems 181
two coordinates per ith actuator, xa,i and ya,i
, are sufficient to unambiguously describe
its location. Hence, the optimization algorithm is required to find a solution in an
2Na-dimensional space.
Due to physical dimensions of the actuators, certain constraints have to be defined
in order to maintain the practicability of the solution. Namely, margins from the
plate edges and between the actuators should be maintained, with the assumption
that the actuators can be attached only from one side of the plate. Inertial actuators
are considered in this paper, which are most commonly manufactured with a round
foot print, although the method could be extended to more complex geometries as
required. The first resulting constraint ensures that the actuators are placed within the
boundaries of the plate; the dimensions of the considered rectangular plate are a×b,
hence, the coordinates of ith actuator xa,i ∈ (

is the diameter of the ith actuator. The second constraint ensures
that actuators do not overlap; for i 6= j, the ith and jth actuators should not be closer
than a distance of 1

.
Cost functions
The cost functions for the described problem can be formulated in a number of ways
[173]. In this research, six cost functions will be evaluated and analysed. First, three
cost functions that do not take into account the acoustic radiation, J1–J3, are formu￾lated as follows,
J1 = min
i
λc,i
, (6.1a)
J2 = NJ

∑
i
λc,i
!
, (6.1b)
J3 =
 
∏
i
λc,i
!NJ
−1
, (6.1c)
for i ∈ {1,2,...,NJ}, where NJ is the number of modes considered in the cost func￾tion. The same range of i is also considered for the other cost functions. All three
cost functions J1–J3 focus on maximizing the controllability of the system, however,
they result in a different balance between the NJ controllability measures, λc,i
, corre￾sponding to the NJ considered modes. Cost function J1 represents only the least con￾trollable mode, and thus ensures that there are no uncontrollable resonances within
the frequency range of interest. Cost function J2, which represents the mean con￾trollability of the modes within the frequency range of interest, may increase the
controllability of certain modes, even if this happens at the expense of reducing the
controllability of other modes. Finally, cost function J3 should lead to solutions that
provide a trade-off between J1 and J2, making sure that the smallest of the factors is
maximized, whilst also benefiting to some extent an increase in the controllability of
the other modes in the frequency range of interest.182 Noise-Controlling Casings
Subsequently, three additional cost functions are defined, J4–J6, which are anal￾ogous to the initial three cost functions, but take into account the acoustic radiation.
These cost functions are defined as
J4 = min

J6 =
 
∏

. (6.2c)
In each case, the division of λc,i by Pi forces the optimization algorithm to seek
solutions with better controllability (more energy efficient) for the ith mode, if the ith
mode acoustic radiation measure Pi
is higher. That is, the cost functions are weighted
to focus the effort into the controllability of the strongly radiating structural modes.
Optimization algorithm
The search space that follows from the optimization problem described in the pre￾vious subsections is very complicated and contains numerous local maxima [173].
Therefore, an efficient algorithm must be employed in order to find a solution that
satisfies the defined requirements. A Memetic Algorithm (MA) can be utilized for
such a task, which is a hybrid form of a population-based approach coupled with sep￾arate individual learning [130]. The MA combines advantages of a global search, as
offered by evolutionary algorithms, and local refinement procedures, which enhance
convergence to the local maxima [130, 128]. Due to these complementary proper￾ties, MA are particularly suitable for solving complex multi-parameter optimization
problems, such as the placement of sensors and actuators [165, 172].
ANALYSIS OF OPTIMIZATION RESULTS
In this section, an analysis of the optimization results obtained for the arrangement
of real actuators is presented [173]. Dayton Audio DAEX32EP-4 are considered as
actuators in this paper. They have a circular form factor, with a mass ma,i = 0.115 kg
and a diameter da,i = 0.060 m. The dimensions of the considered plate are a = 0.420
m and b = 0.420 m, hence, based on the constraints defined in Subsection 6.2.1, the
coordinates of the ith actuator are given as xa,i ∈ (0.030,0.390), ya,i ∈ (0.030,0.390)
and (xa,i −xa, j)
2 + (ya,i −ya, j)
2 ≥ (0.060)

for i 6= j.
The configurations for three, six and nine actuators have been optimized using
the six cost functions, J1–J6, defined in the previous section. The objective was to
maximize the controllability of the plate used as an active acoustic barrier. The low
frequency range was considered, hence the first NJ = 12 vibration modes of the plate
were considered in the optimization process. The obtained results are summarized in
Table 6.1.Active control systems 183

It follows from an analysis of the results presented in Table 6.1 that the introduc￾tion of an acoustic radiation estimate into the cost function J1, obtaining J4, enables
an increase in the controllability measure λc,i of more than 5 dB for acoustically￾relevant modes (where Pi ≥ 30 dB; in Table 6.1 they are highlighted with a grey
background). An increase in the controllability measure λc,i means that the ith mode
is more excited with the same control effort (e.g. an increase of λc,i by 5 dB means
that the modal velocity of the ith mode is by 5 dB greater with the same control
effort). The price that is paid for this increase is a smaller controllability for modes
that are less responsible for acoustic radiation or transmission. The minimal con￾trollability measure λc,i for J1 is 50 dB, while for J4 it is 40 dB. However, the least
controllable mode for the solution obtained with J4 has Pi = 19 dB, which means
that its role in acoustic radiation or transmission will be minor compared to the other
modes that have a Pi
that is more than 15 dB higher.
It is also interesting to highlight that modifying cost function J1 to give J4 pro￾vides a similar increase in the controllability of the acoustically-relevant modes to
that achieved by employing additional actuators, as shown by the results presented
in Table 6.2. By optimizing the actuator locations using J4, a similar controllability
can be reached as achieved when the number of actuators are doubled and optimized
using J1. In other words, by using J4 the number of actuators, Na, could be reduced,
e.g. from 6 to 3 per plate, whilst maintaining a similar level of controllability in terms
of the acoustically-relevant modes. In practical noise control applications, this reduc￾tion in the required number of actuators offers a significant reduction in the cost and
control system complexity, which is a considerable advantage.
Referring again to the results presented in Table 6.1, it can be seen that the results
obtained for both J2 and J5 are in general inferior to the results obtained with J1
and J4. The reason for this is that if a sum is employed in the cost function (J2 and
J5), it can be beneficial to maximize only one component of the sum and neglect the
others. In the considered optimization problem, the controllability of the first mode
was maximized, but the remaining modes were neglected and, as a result, these cost
functions do not meet the objective.
It is interesting to note from the results presented in Table 6.1 that both J1 and
J3 result in similar cost function values. The controllability of all considered modes
has been maximized using these cost functions. However, introduction of acoustic
radiation measure into cost function J3, which gives J6, provides unsatisfactory re￾sults. It turns out that it is beneficial for J6 to have a single mode of high acoustic
radiation and lower controllability, while maximizing controllability of the other less
acoustically-relevant modes. This is, therefore, an unacceptable solution for the con￾sidered application.
Acoustic and structural vibration responses of the plate, obtained for the different
optimization indices J1–J6, are presented in Fig. 6.1. These responses are calculated
for the solutions summarized in Table 6.1, hence in all cases the number of actu￾ators Na = 3. Both responses, driven with the primary uniform excitation and by
the optimally arranged actuators, are presented. The responses of the plate due to
primary uniform excitation are obtained by applying an equal excitation to all struc￾tural modes, instead of simulating an external acoustic excitation. These responsesActive control systems 187
correspond to the result of a uniform wide-band external excitation that can be pro￾duced by many types of common noise sources. The responses due to excitation by
the optimally arranged actuators are obtained by simulating actuator action as forces
acting at the optimized actuator locations (xa,i
, ya,i). A wideband signal again was
used as the input to the actuators. The magnitude of the input signals to the actuators
was arbitrarily chosen and was the same in all evaluated cases and for all actuators.
The larger the response due to the actuators (shown by the dashed line) compared
to the response when driven by the primary uniform excitation (shown by the black
line), the easier it will be for the control system to reduce the noise transmission or
radiation in the considered frequency range.
It follows from analysis of Fig. 6.1 that in the case of the structural responses ob￾tained for J1 and J3, the responses due to optimally arranged actuators nearly match
for all considered peaks in the responses due to primary uniform excitation. How￾ever, in the case of the acoustic responses obtained for J1 and J3, the highest peaks
in the responses due to primary uniform excitation are higher than the correspond￾ing responses due to the actuators, while the response due to the optimally arranged
actuators obtained for J4 dominates the highest peaks in the acoustic response of the
plate due to primary uniform excitation. Still, an enhanced performance in acoustic
response obtained for J4 is traded for a weaker structural response for the modes
that are less responsible for acoustic radiation or transmission. These remarks are
consistent with the previous conclusions drawn from the analysis of Table 6.1.
To summarize, introduction of the acoustic radiation measure into the cost func￾tion in the form of J4 offers best performance and enables an increase in the con￾trollability measure of more than 5 dB for acoustically-relevant modes. The increase
in controllability for these modes is comparable to that achieved by employing addi￾tional actuators (at least doubling the number of actuators for the considered system).
From a different point of view, this method could also be used to rearrange the ac￾tuators in order to try to reduce their number, while maintaining the same level of
controllability. Such reduction in practical noise control applications entails a signif￾icant reduction in the cost and the control system complexity.
These advantages are traded for a reduction in the controllability of the modes
that are less responsible for acoustic radiation or transmission. However, such modes
have been shown to have a modal acoustic power that is at least 15 dB lower than
that due to the dominant modes, which means that their contribution to the noise
transmission and radiation is negligible.
6.2.2 OPTIMIZATION OF ERROR MICROPHONES
The goal of the active noise-cancelling casing is to reduce noise emitted to the en￾vironment. In case of feedback systems or adaptive feedforward systems that try to
control noise emission directly, the noise emission must be measured or estimated.
The noise emission can be estimated by measuring acoustic pressure on a sphere
around the casing [119]. In practice the acoustic pressure can be measured only in
a finite number of locations at the same time, and the average noise emission, J(n),188 Noise-Controlling Casings
needs to be approximated by using a numerical quadrature:
J(n) ≈
1
NM
J1(n) =
MM
∑
i=0
aim
2
i
(n), (6.3)
where mi
is the acoustic pressure at ith location, ai
is the weight related to ith loca￾tion, and MM = NM −1 and NM is the number of positions in which acoustic pressure
is measured. Sampling of the sphere introduces a spatial aliasing. The spatial alias￾ing is unavoidable, but generally it can be reduced by increasing number of samples.
The spatial aliasing also depends on locations at which acoustic pressure is sam￾pled. The acoustic pressure can be measured by microphones. Weighting needs to
be introduced for cases with nonuniform microphone arrangement. When all mi￾crophones have the same measurement uncertainty, the uncertainty of the weighted
sum is the lowest when all weights are the same. This can be obtained by using uni￾form microphone arrangement. When uniform microphone arrangement is used, the
approximation can be simplified to:
J(n) ≈
1
NM
J2(n) =
MM
∑
i=0
m
2
i
(n). (6.4)
Uniform microphone arrangement can be obtained if the microphones are po￾sitioned in vertices of Platonic solids. Unfortunately, only 5 Platonic solids exists,
with: 4, 6, 8, 12 and 20 vertices. For other number of microphones only approxima￾tions exists [59]. The placement, however, can be uniform enough to avoid weight￾ing.
The number of needed microphones is related to spatial aliasing. In the simplest
one-dimensional case with two microphones, the unique pressure distribution be￾tween microphones can be obtained only when the distance between microphones is
smaller than a half of the wavelength. In extreme case, for standing wave with the
wavelength equal to distance between microphones, both microphones may measure
the same sinusoidally changing acoustic pressure, but the reported amplitude may be
from zero, if microphones are located in nodes of a standing wave, up to a maximal
amplitude when microphones are located in antinodes of a standing wave. Unfortu￾nately, the acoustic pressure profile can be arbitrary, the Fourier decomposition may
contain any frequencies. However, if we assume that the active noise cancelling cas￾ing is the only sound source, the maximal possible frequency can be estimated. If we
assume that nonlinearities in the casing are not significant, the maximal frequency
generated by the casing is the maximal frequency generated by the primary source.
Additionally, the casing provides passive reduction of high frequencies. The passive
noise reduction of the casing can be included by observing the noise outside of the
casing.
When uniform spacing between microphones on a sphere is used, the average area
per microphone is equal to:
Sm =
4πr
2
NM
, (6.5)Active control systems 189
where r is the radius of a sphere, thus, each microphone approximately covers a disc
with a radius:
rm ≈
r
Sm
π
=
2r
√
NM
. (6.6)
The distance between microphones is approximately equal to 2rm. The distance must
be shorter than a half of a wavelength, so the number of required microphones is
equal to:
NM > 64r
fmax
c
, (6.7)
where fmax is the maximal frequency, and c is the speed of sound. Alternatively, we
can estimate the upper frequency limit for a given number of microphones:
fmax <
1
8
c
r
√
NM. (6.8)
This limit is only a rough approximation. In the simplest case a catastrophic failure,
when all microphones are places in nodes of a standing wave, generated by destruc￾tive interference controlled by active noise control, may occur at 2 fmax. In such case
only a local noise reduction will be achieved, not global.
For non-uniform microphone arrangements the maximal distance between micro￾phones for the same number of microphones must be larger than the distance in uni￾form arrangement. Thus, the upper frequency limit for non-uniform arrangements
is lower than for uniform arrangements. So, uniform arrangement not only avoids
weighting in quadrature, and provides the lowest possible uncertainty of emission,
but also provides the best possible upper frequency range.
The casing is rarely in free space. However, casing placed on a frame lattice,
sometimes found in industry, can be a good approximation of such conditions. In
most cases the casing is placed on a sound reflecting floor. In such case microphones
can be located only on half sphere. The number of microphones required to cover
that space with the same distance between microphones, to cover the same frequency
range, is halved. Placing a casing near walls may reduce the number of needed micro￾phones even further. When the casing is placed near a wall only a quarter of micro￾phones is needed. When the casing is placed in the corner only 1
8
of microphones are
needed. Unfortunately, such locations will provide respectively 3 dB, 6 dB and 9 dB
amplification of low frequencies, due to reduced number of sound propagation direc￾tions [57]. For higher frequencies interference between primary and reflected sound
may provide more complex behaviour, for instance destructive interference. The cor￾ner may also work as corner reflector [23].
Fig. 6.2 shows exemplary comparison of sound pressure level around a washing
machine with active noise/vibration control and two microphone arrangements. The
washing machine was placed on a floor near wall. Remaining four walls were actively
controlled. The results are shown for spinning at 1200 rpm. To verify global noise
reduction the sound pressure level was measured at 17 locations. Two microphone
arrangements were tested, octahedral with 0.9 m radius and dodecahedral with 1 m
radius. In case of dodecahedral arrangement a larger radius was required to provide190 Noise-Controlling Casings

0.7 dB higher than without control. This behaviour is related to no observable re￾duction of 225 Hz to 235 Hz band at monitoring microphones. This frequency band
is, however, reduced at error microphones. Fig. 6.4 shows the average PSD (Power
Spectral Density) of signals from monitoring microphones. So, for that frequency
the active control system does not reduce that band globally, but only shifts sound
emission in a way in which at locations of error microphones noise is reduced. This
is, however, expected, because that arrangement should be acceptable only up to
116 Hz. The problem occurs at ab. 230 Hz, twice the maximal frequency. It actu￾ally occurs at frequency for which the wavelength is equal to the distance between
microphones and such failure was expected.
The dodecahedral arrangement provides better SPL reduction on all monitoring
microphones. The maximal SPL is equal to 58.6 dB, a 6.9 dB improvement com￾pared to system without active control and a 3.9 dB improvement over a system
with octahedral microphone arrangement. The system with dodecahedral arrange￾ment provides average sound pressure reduction for all important frequencies, both
on monitoring microphones (Fig. 6.4) and on error microphones (Figs. 6.5–6.6). In
that case the local noise reduction on error microphones provides global noise reduc￾tion in a whole room.192 Noise-Controlling Casings

6.2.3 CONTROL UNIT
Modern Active Control systems use digital signal processing. Analogue signals from
error sensors are filtered to avoid aliasing, converted to digital signals, processed by
microprocessors or programmable logic systems, and digital controller outputs are
converted to analogue signals, filtered by reconstruction filters, amplified and send
to actuators. Smallest systems may use only one error sensor, one actuator and re￾quire computing power provided by even cheapest microcontrollers. Bigger, mul￾tichannel Active Control systems needed for active noise cancelling casings, may
require tenths of sensors and actuators and very high computing power. The required
computing power scales badly with increasing number of channels, the number of
secondary paths is equal to the number of actuators multiplied by a number of error
signals [118]. The number of control filters is equal to the number of actuators multi-Active control systems 193

plied by the number of reference sensors, and each adaptive control filter, generally,
requires corrections from each error. Additionally increase of sampling frequency
not only requires a higher number of control algorithm iterations per second, but
also the length of FIR (Finite Impulse Filter) filters, commonly used as control fil￾ters and for secondary path modelling, must be increased, by the same factor. The
needed computational power can easily exceed the computational power of a sin￾gle processor. Fortunately, most Active Control algorithms have a small number of
data dependencies and can be executed in parallel on multiple processors, even on
distributed systems. Each node of the system may have a small amount of input
and output channels and all necessary data is exchanged between nodes. An impor￾tant advantage of such systems is scalability, the number of nodes can be chosen
based on the number of channels of Active Control system. However, in such sys￾tem the processing power scales linearly with the number of nodes and channels,
but in many algorithms the computational requirements scale quadratically or even
cubically. For such systems some simplifications of control algorithms, which will
reduce dependence on the number of channels to linear, are valuable. Some of them
will be presented in Section 6.4.4.
Fig. 6.7 shows the control unit used for all experiments in this chapter. The unit
employs 5 dSpace DS1104 R&D boards placed inside a single system, a 19” rack ×
86 server running GNU/Linux. Each DS1104 board has 8 analogue inputs and 8 ana￾logue outputs, the whole control unit provides 40 analogue input and 40 analogue
outputs. Each board has a Motorola MPC8240 PowerPC processor with 32 MiB lo￾cal RAM (Random Access Memory). All boards are connected to the host with a PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus. Each board acts as a bus master on a PCI
bus, when an access to a PCI bus is granted by the arbiter it may initiate bus trans￾actions [139]. The PCI bus provides up to 133 MB/s bandwidth with low latency. In
this setup the guaranteed latency is smaller than 5 µs. This allows for multiple data
transfers between boards in each sampling period.194 Noise-Controlling Casings

The Linux kernel support for DS1104 boards is provided by the ds1104 driver
[101]. The driver provides access to board’s local memory from userspace, provides
an interface needed to execute code on board, and provides 4 MiB shared memory
region located in the System RAM that can be accessed from userspace and from
code running on all DS1104 boards. Higher level support for DS1104 boards is pro￾vided by ds1104-utils [101]. The one of important utilities is the ds1104-boot
program, which loads the program to DS1104 boards. The programs for DS1104
boards are compiled using a GNU toolchain [155]. A newlib [181] is used as a stan￾dard C library. The basic DS1104 hardware support is provided by the ds1104lib
[101] library.
Due to practical constraints on the number of microphones the active noise￾cancelling casings can provide global noise reduction to about 300 Hz. The antialias￾ing and reconstruction filters were designed to provide flat amplitude response up to
400 Hz. To provide wide transition band the sampling frequency was set to 2 kHz.
All ADCs and DACs are synchronized using an external trigger signal.
6.3 CONTROL STRUCTURES
6.3.1 FEEDFORWARD CONTROL
The goal of all considered Active Control systems is to reduce noise outside of the
casing. Without control the noise is equal to z(n) = [z0(n),z1(n),...,zME
(n)]T
(Fig.
6.8), where ME = NE −1 and NE is the number of error signals. This noise is called
the “primary noise”. Active systems try to reduce noise by adding additional sound
component, “secondary noise”, y(n) = [y0(n), y1(n),..., yME
(n)]T
, which interferes
with primary noise, and produces:
e(n) = z(n) +y(n), (6.9)Active control systems 195

where e(n) = [e0(n), e1(n),..., eME

. The resulting sound is treated as the error
signal.
The “secondary noise” is not generated directly at points of interest, but propa￾gates through secondary paths, S:
y(n) = Su(n), (6.10)

where Sc,l are some generic, causal operators related to cth control signal and lth
error signal, and MU = NU − 1 and NU is the number of control signals. Usually,
linear filters are used for modelling secondary paths. In that case secondary paths
operators can be expressed as polynomials of one-step delay operator q (definition:
q f(n) = f(n−1)):

where MS = NS − 1 and NS is the number of coefficients of numerator and AS is
the number of coefficients of denominator. To avoid overparametrization, the first
coefficient of denominator is always equal to 1.
Acoustic secondary paths are usually very complex due to multiple reflections
and for them FIR models (AS = 1):

In classical ANC (Active Noise Control) systems the secondary paths include
acoustic path between secondary sound source and error microphones. This acoustics
path introduces large delays, at least few milliseconds in typical systems (ab. 3 mil￾liseconds per meter). This significantly limits the possible noise reduction bandwidth
of feedback systems. The acoustics path delay is comparable to periods of spectral
components of the noise. For instance, the period of 200 Hz tone is equal to 5 ms
and a 1 m acoustic path delay, 3 ms, is higher than a half period leading to instability
of a simple control loop with proportional controller (if the gain is large enough).
More complex controllers may compensate for this delay. However, it is very diffi￾cult to design a stable system with high gain, needed for high noise reduction, over
a wide frequency range. Additionally, in real systems the response of acoustic path is
more complex due to reflections. This path is also frequently non-stationary because
of changes in acoustic environment: moving objects, temperature changes, etc. Due
to those difficulties Active Noise Control systems frequently use feedforward con￾trol. The acoustic path is also a problem for ANVC (Active Noise/Vibration Control)
systems, but not for AVC (Active Vibration Control) and ASAC (Active Structural
Acoustic Control) systems. However, in AVC and ASAC systems, the secondary path
might be also complex due to multiple resonances of vibrating plates and also non￾stationary, for instance due to plate temperature changes [109].
The feedforward approach assumes that the primary noise at points of interest,
z, is generated by remote location(s), and propagates through primary paths P (Fig.
6.9):

where Wc,l

Because the feedforward system has no feedback, if the all subsystems are stable,
the whole active control system is stable. In practice P, X and S subsystems are
always stable and potential instability is in the control filters W. Because the stability
of control filters does not depend on other subsystems it can be easily verified. In
many applications the a finite impulse response filters, which are inherently stable,
are used as control filters. This makes the whole system unconditionally stable.

where MW = NW − 1 and NW is a number of coefficients. Because each output de￾pends only on filter weights and reference signals, this step can be efficiently im￾plemented on multiple processor systems or even distributed systems. In direct ap￾proach, where all calculations related to cth control signal are performed on a se￾lected node of distributed system, each node needs only a full set of reference signals,
with MW previous samples, and control filter coefficients for channels handled by that
node. The reference signals can be connected separately to each node, or connected
only to one node and then sent digitally to other nodes. In this approach each node
must have a local copy of reference signals regressors array. Alternatively, if data
exchange is possible between nodes, to avoid duplication of reference signals regres￾sor array, this array can be distributed to multiple nodes and each node will generate
partial sums for each control output. Then, those partial sums can be aggregated.198 Noise-Controlling Casings

If
XWS = P, (6.21)
the primary noise is completely eliminated at points of interest. However, to satisfy
this condition the sum of delays in the reference paths, control filters and secondary
paths must be smaller than delays in primary paths.
Because the d(n) signal cannot be measured, and thus, the primary path model P
cannot be identified, sometimes the reference signal is used as the input for “primary
path” (Fig. 6.10). However, in this approach the “primary path” model P
0
can be
noncausal. Because now everything depends on the reference signal x, d(n) and X
can be removed. With this approach the Eq. 6.21 can be rewritten as:
WS = X
−1P = P
0
. (6.22)
Now both secondary path S and new “primary path” P
0 models can be identified. In
practice, due to causality issues, this equation cannot be satisfied and only an ap￾proximate solution can be used.
Wiener filter
For single-channel linear systems the optimal solution can be obtained using
a Wiener filter. The Wiener approach requires that the control filter output is added
to primary noise directly. However, if W = [W1,1] and S = [S1,1] operators commute,
the order of operators can be virtually swapped for control filter optimization (Fig.
6.11). Because such system does not exist in reality, the secondary path S was re￾placed by its model Sˆ. Operators in a form of polynomials of q (or z
−1
), due to
cumulative property of multiplication of polynomials, commute with each other:
A(q)B(q)f(n) = B(q)A(q)f(n).
Now, the optimal control filter weight can be obtained by solving Wiener-Hopf
equations [159]:

If possible, for easier estimation the primary noise source can be turned off in that
phase. The same method for secondary path identification can be used for adaptive
algorithms.

primary noise source and disabled active control. In that case the primary noise z200 Noise-Controlling Casings

can be measured directly using error sensor, due to z(n) = e(n) + S0 = e(n). The
second needed signal is reference signal x. The Wiener solution, however, requires
the reference signal filtered by virtual secondary path: r(n) = Sx(n). The secondary
path model was estimated in the first phase.
6.3.2 ACOUSTIC FEEDBACK
In practice, both primary and secondary source have effect on the reference signal
and an additional “acoustic feedback path” F must be added to the model (Fig. 6.14)

This additional feedback changes the effective control filter, W0 = (1−WF)

and adds a positive feedback loop, which can destabilize the system. The effect of
this feedback loop must be taken into account when designing the control filter or
alternatively, the effect on the feedback path can be removed, by adding additional

Figure 6.15 Feedforward ANC system block diagram with additional acoustic feedback path
and its compensation.202 Noise-Controlling Casings
In case of active noise-cancelling casings with the reference microphone located
in the casing, the acoustic feedback is usually significant and must be eliminated.
Because the acoustic feedback can be easily compensated in later parts of this chapter
it will be assumed that the acoustic feedback does not exist or has been eliminated.
6.3.3 FEEDBACK CONTROL
Due to high delays in secondary paths feedback control in Active Noise Control sys￾tems is more difficult and less popular. However, there are applications for which
the secondary path acoustic delay is small, for instance headphones or earplugs with
active noise control. In case of Active Vibration Control acoustic path does not ex￾ist, the sound propagates through structures, with higher velocity and also in many
applications actuators and sensors are collocated. When actuators and sensors are
collocated the secondary path is simple and it is possible to use very simple feed￾back controllers, even proportional controller. When actuators and sensors are not
collocated the secondary path is more complex and includes some delay.
A feedback control with very large delays in the secondary path is difficult,
but possible. The first commonly known solution is to use Smith predictor [154]
(Fig. 6.16). An explicit delay D is extracted from secondary path S so the secondary
path becomes Sq
D, and then Sˆ − Sˆq
D, where Sˆq
D is the secondary path model, is
added to the error signal and feed back to controller W. It is assumed that the con￾troller will provide necessary negative gain. The regulator sees Sq+Sˆ −Sˆq
D object,
and if the model of the secondary path is perfect the controller sees Sˆ, the secondary
path without delay.
The error is equal to:
e(n) = 1−Sˆ(1−q

With perfect model Sˆ = S, this equation can be simplified to:

Another possibility is to use IMC (Internal Model Control) (Fig. 6.17).

system with acoustic feedback path compensation the reference signal is equal to
x(n) = Xd(n)+Fu(n)−Fuˆ (n). If X = P, F = S and Fˆ = Fˆ both equations are exactly
the same.
The IMC system, when compared to feed-forward control, in case of active cas￾ings usually provides better attenuation for simple, deterministic disturbances, like
tonal noise [114]. The noise reduction results for a washing machine are shown
in Table 6.4. The IMC system provides slightly better noise reduction for a 113
Hz tonal noise, but provides worse results for simulated 1200 rpm spinning noise,
from a loudspeaker inside the washing machine. The spectrum of both signals on all
microphones is shown in Figs. 6.18 and 6.19. The increased noise reduction for tonal
disturbances is related to small nonlinearities that are usually present in the system.
Linear feed-forward systems are not able to cope with harmonic frequencies caused
by them and when the primary tone is significantly reduced, harmonic frequencies
may dominate. Nonlinear feed-forward systems have no such problems [110, 112],
but they have higher computational requirements. In vibroacoustic systems that use
multiple actuators to cover wider frequency range it is possible to combine multiple
channels into one, and use only one nonlinear filter [111].

measured by error microphones or its estimate, must be available for controller. The
most accurate solution is to measure noise emission directly by microphones. How￾ever, such approach requires potentially large number of microphones at specific
locations. In many cases it is not acceptable. Two alternatives exits: do not use er￾ror sensors or use a different type of error sensors, for instance vibration sensors
mounted on the casing [115, 116].
Without error sensors only a limited adaptation can be used. The simplest solu￾tion is to not use adaptation at all. Such solution have two important drawbacks:
the system is not able to adopt to any changes in primary, secondary or reference
paths and the system is not able to adopt to primary disturbance changes. The first
problem could be potentially addressed by some forms of gain scheduling based
on some environmental parameters like temperature, which can significantly change
plate response [109]. The second problem can be addressed by measurement of the
noise spectrum by reference sensor and redesign of a control filter. Such redesign
requires the models of the primary path and secondary paths. The knowledge about
the models can be indirect, for instance the control filter can be chosen from a set of
previously designed filters that are not specific to exact disturbance spectrum, e.g.,
using generalized disturbance [84].
The direct usage of other type of error sensors may not lead to effective emitted
noise reduction. For example, when vibration sensors are used the ANVC system
actually becomes AVC system, which provides good vibration reduction, but does
not result in effective reduction of noise emission [47, 143, 100]. One solution is
to estimate noise emission by using theoretical models. Such leads to ASAC. Pre￾cise modelling of real world setup is, however, difficult and in many cases virtually
impossible. A lot of physical parameters needed for such modelling is usually not
known and require estimation based on real world data. In practice it is simpler to
identify paths from known signals to physical error microphones. After identifica￾tion such microphones can be removed and identified models can be used to provide
noise reduction close to reduction with real microphones. This idea is known as VMC
(Virtual Microphone Control) [134]. There are many possible VMC approaches.
Fig. 6.20 shows the block diagram of a ANC system with two sets of error sensors:
e1(n) and e2(n). To analyse possible adaptation to disturbance changes it is assumed
that d(n) = Dε(n), where ε(n) is an some signal. The operation for deterministic
disturbances can be analysed by assuming: ε(n) = δ(n), where δ(n) is Kronecker
delta. The operation for stochastic disturbances can be analysed by assuming that
ε(n) s a white noise.
It is assumed that both secondary paths share some common path, Sc. In practice
all elements of secondary paths up to walls (e.g. DACs, reconstruction filters, power
amplifiers, actuators, walls of the casing) are shared between those two paths. Addi￾tionally, also primary paths share some common path, Pc, everything from primary
noise source up to walls of the casing. When the active control system works using
e1(n) error sensors it provides some residual error:
e1(n) = (P1Pc +S1ScWX)d(n). (6.34)208 Noise-Controlling Casings

Figure 6.20 ANC system with two sets of error sensors: for real and virtual control.
The signal on the secondary sensors is equal to:
e2(n) = (P2Pc +S2ScWX)d(n). (6.35)
One possibility to create a VMC system is to ensure that the e2(n) signal is the
same as if a system with e1(n) error sensors is running [133]. It can be obtained by
identification of the path, H, from x(n) to e2(n) and using it as the reference model,
Hˆ , for control. The secondary sensors outputs are equal to:
e2(n) = HXd(n). (6.36)
The H can be obtained by solving following equation:
HX = P1Pc +S1ScWX. (6.37)
If the delay in the combined P1Pc is smaller than the delay in X the H is non-causal.
Because a causal model must be used in control system only an approximate model
can be used in that case. Ideally, d(n) should be used directly, but that signal is
unavailable for the control system, and x(n) must be used instead.
The goal of new control system is to minimize e3(n) = e2(n) − Hxˆ , where Hˆ is
an identified model of H path. So, effectively the VMC system minimizes (Fig. 6.21):

Figure 6.21 ANC system with VMC, with appropriate Hˆ reduction of e3(n) error signals
reduces e1(n) error signals.
It can be shown that this VMC system adopts, minimization of e3(n) provides
optimal reduction of e1(n), to any changes of Sc. To simplify equations it is assumed
that the ANC system operates perfectly, e1(n) = 0 and also e3(n) = 0. It requires
ideal model of Hˆ (the H must be causal). In that case equations 6.34 and 6.38 can be
rewritten as:

Figure 6.23 The adaptive filtering problem.
Marcian E. Hoff in 1960 [163], during their research on the steepest descent al￾gorithm in application to the ‘Adaline’ device. Most probably, the algorithm was
named the Least Mean Squares by Koford and Groner in 1966 [78]. It soon gained
recognition and wide areas of applications. Also, different modifications of the LMS
algorithm started to appear in the literature very soon.
LMS Algorithm Essentials
The LMS algorithm belongs to the family of stochastic gradient algorithms: it adjusts
each tap of an adaptive filter in a direction of the gradient of the squared magnitude
of an error with respect to the tap weights. Stochastic gradient algorithms are used to
solve the adaptive filtering problem, which is depicted in Fig. 6.23. In this problem,
a discrete input signal, u(n), is filtered with a discrete time adaptive filter, W(z
−1
). A
resulting output signal, y(n), is then compared with a signal with desired properties,
d(n). The result of this comparison, e(n), is called an error. The problem of the
adaptive filtering is how to adjust the filter weights to minimize a selected measure
of the error.
The problem cannot be tackled without assumptions concerning the signals, the
filter and the optimization criterion. Without further analysis of possible choices, we212 Noise-Controlling Casings
will use the assumptions enumerated below. More on the assumptions can be found
in [17].
1. Both the input signals, u(n) and d(n), are discrete-time, real-valued,
bounded or with bounded distribution.
2. The filter, for a frozen time, is a linear, discrete-time, of the finite impulse
response (FIR) type.
3. The selected measure of the error to be minimized is an expected value of
the mean-squared error signal.
Consider the adaptive filter with N parameters (or taps). Based on assumption 2,
the filter output can be written as:
y(n) =
N−1
∑
k=0
wk(n)uk(n) ∈ R; (6.42)
where wk(n) ∈ R are the filter weights at the discrete time n, uk(n) are the corre￾sponding samples of the input signal. The filter parameters can be organized into a
tap-weight vector:
w(n) = [w0(n), w1(n),..., wN−1(n)]T ∈ R
N
. (6.43)
In the application of the adaptive filtering problem considered in this book, the input
samples come from a tapped-delay line, and can be expressed in a vector form as:
u(n) = [u(n), u(n−1),..., u(n−N +1)]T ∈ R
N
. (6.44)
Therefore, the output of the adaptive filter can be calculated as:
y(n) =
N−1
∑
k=0
wk(n)u(n−k) = u
T
(n)w(n) = w
T
(n)u; (6.45)
and the error can be determined as:
e(n) = d(n)−u
T
(n)w(n). (6.46)
Based on assumption 3, the optimization criterion should be expressed as:
minJ(w) = minE(e
2
(n)). (6.47)
The LMS algorithm, which is the central point of this chapter, is given by:
w(n+1) = w(n) + µ u(n)e(n); (6.48)
where µ is called the step size.
The algorithm thus defined has many advantages: it is simple and easy to imple￾ment, it computes fast and is surprisingly robust (the LMS algorithm robust stability
was proved in 1993 [60]). Unfortunately, it also has some disadvantages, like slow
convergence for some signals and the need of carefully step size selection. Due to
this and other reasons, many modifications of the LMS appeared and still are be￾ing published. However, only a few of them are general enough and gained a wide
recognition—those are discussed below.Active control systems 213
Modifications of the LMS Algorithm
Normalized LMS Algorithm
Due to strong dependence of properties of the LMS algorithm on the step size, the
first well-known modification of the LMS was concerned with the step size. This
modification was invented independently by Nagumo and Noda [127], and Albert
and Gardner [4], and it is nowadays known as the Normalized LMS (NLM) algo￾rithm.
There are two ways to formulate the NLMS algorithm.
• It can be considered as the LMS algorithm with the step size dependent on
the energy of the input signal u(n).
• It may be obtained as a solution of the constrained optimization problem
of the minimization of the Euclidean norm of a change of the filter weight
vector w(n), subject to the constraint w
T
(n+1)u(n) = d(n) [62].
Using either of the attitudes, one obtains an update law of the NLMS algorithm
as:
w(n+1) = w(n) + µ˜
ku(n)k
2
u(n)e(n); (6.49)
where µ˜ is called the normalized step size. The relation between the LMS and the
NLMS step sizes is therefore:
µ(n) = µ˜
ku(n)k
2
; (6.50)
where we have appreciated the fact that the LMS algorithm step size varies by nam￾ing it µ(n).
Leaky LMS Algorithm
The Leaky LMS (LLMS) algorithm was introduced as a response to the observation
that the adaptive filter weights in many applications of the LMS algorithm tended
to diverge, or drift, away from the optimal values in spite of the fact that all signals
remained bounded. It was discovered that this phenomenon is due to insufficient
excitation in the input signal [17]. The authors that published the algorithm first
denoted it as:
w(n+1) = γw(n) + µ u(n)e(n); (6.51)
where γ ∈ (0,1] is the leakage factor.
Later it was discovered that the LLMS algorithm can be obtained as a result of
minimization of the following cost function:
J(n) = e
2
(n) +αkw(n)k
2 = e
2
(n) +α w
T
(n)w(n); (6.52)
where α is a constant. The result of minimization of this cost function with respect
to the filter’s weight vector w(n), is given by:
w(n+1) = (1− µα)w(n) + µ u(n)e(n); (6.53)214 Noise-Controlling Casings
Comparing Eq. (6.51) and Eq. (6.53) results in a conclusion that both of them
describe the same algorithm, with γ = 1− µα.
Other modifications
As mentioned above, there is a plethora of other modifications, especially concerned
with techniques of step size adjustment [19]. Other, well-known modifications in￾clude:
• simplified LMS versions: sign-error, sign-regressor, and sign-sign,
• affine projection LMS,
• transform-domain LMS,
• partial update LMS.
The latter group of algorithms is covered in more details in Section 6.4.3.
6.4.2 STABILITY OF THE LMS-FAMILY ALGORITHMS
There are two best known methods to analyse the stability and convergence of the
LMS algorithm. Both the methods use different sets of assumptions, with the com￾mon denominator in a form of an assumption that the input signals are wide-sense
stationary. This assumption is unrealistic for a wide area of applications of the LMS
algorithm.
The first method is historically older and is referred to as the independence theory.
It assumes the input vectors constitute a sequence of statistically independent, identi￾cally distributed vectors (i.i.d. sequence), and that the input sequence is independent
from the desired response [14, 17]. Unfortunately, this assumption is violated by
each application where the input data comes from a tapped-delay line.
The second method, which is called the small step size theory, was developed
by Butterweck and published in 1995 [22]. In this method, the main assumption is
that the step size is so small that an LMS filter can be treated as a low-pass filter,
with a low cut-off frequency, and that the input vector and the desired response are
related by a linear multiple regression model, or that they are stationary and jointly
Gaussian. These assumptions are unrealistic as well.
For the above reasons, Bismor [14] proposed a different, control-theory based
method of the LMS algorithm stability analysis, which will be shorty outlined here.
Stability Analysis of the LMS Algorithm
The first step to obtain the stability conditions using control theory results is to de￾velop the state-space model of the LMS algorithm. Substituting the error Eq. (6.46)
into the LMS algorithm weight update Eq. (6.48) yields:
w(n+1) = w(n) + µ u(n)

d(n)−u
T
(n)w(n)

. (6.54)
After regrouping the terms, the above equation becomes:
w(n+1) = 
1− µ u(n)u
T
(n)

w(n) + µ u(n)d(n). (6.55)Active control systems 215
Equation (6.55) can be viewed as the state equation of an arbitrary nonstationary
discrete-time system:
x˜(n+1) = A(n)x˜(n) +B(n)u˜(n); (6.56)
with the matrices and vectors:
A(n) = 1− µ u(n)u
T
(n), x˜(n) = w(n) (6.57)
B(n) = µ u(n) u˜(n) = d(n). (6.58)
The Lyapunov stability of the system in Eq. (6.56) depends only on the state
transition matrix A, which is (fortunately) symmetric and (unfortunately) time￾dependent. Based on the control theory it can be proved that the marginal stability
sufficient condition for the system in Eq. 6.55 (with a symmetric state transition ma￾trix) is that all the roots of the characteristic polynomial (or eigenvalues) of the state
transition matrix A have absolute values less than or equal to 1. Bismor proved that
the state transition matrix in Eq. (6.57) has an eigenvalue

with the corresponding eigenvector u(n). The remaining eigenvalues are all 1-s. Con￾sidering the stability condition, it is possible to deduce that the LMS algorithm re￾mains marginally stable if:

provided ku(n)k 6= 0 [14].
The above result is not unexpected as it is consistent with the literature. Observe,
however, that contrary to the other literature conditions, it was achieved using only
a small set of mild assumptions. Particularly, it wasn’t necessary to assume neither
that the step size is small (which is contradictory to fast adaptation, with the step size
close to its maximum), nor that the signals are stationary. It wasn’t even assumed
that the signals u(n) and d(n) are related. Moreover, the above result is simple and
easy to use, even in real-world, online applications.
Stability Analysis of the NLMS Algorithm
By comparing the right-hand side of the Eq. (6.60) with Eq. (6.50) it is possible to
conclude that the NLMS algorithm stability condition is given by:
0 ≤ µ˜ < 2. (6.61)
This also suggest that the simplest way of application of the above stability condition
is by using the normalized version of the LMS algorithm.216 Noise-Controlling Casings
Stability Analysis of the LLMS Algorithm
Even if the stability analysis of the LMS algorithm with leakage is similar to the anal￾ysis of the algorithm without leakage, the results are substantially different. There￾fore, the analysis will be presented below, starting with the state space model of the
LLMS algorithm, which is:
w(n+1) = 
γ1− µ u(n)u
T
(n)

w(n) + µ u(n)d(n). (6.62)
Thus, the state transition matrix, or the LLMS algorithm stability matrix, is equal to:
A(n) = γ1− µ u(n)u
T
(n). (6.63)
It can be proved [20] that this matrix has an eigenvalue:

∑
l=0
u

(n−l) = γ − µ ku(n)k

; (6.64)
with the corresponding eigenvector u(n). The remaining eigenvalues are all equal
to γ, and this makes the greatest difference from the LMS algorithm due to the fact
that 0 < γ ≤ 1 (but for γ = 1 the LLMS turns to be the LMS). Specifically, for the
case of γ < 1, the LLMS can be asymptotically stable, contrary to the LMS, which
can be marginally stable at the most. Based on Eq. (6.64), the asymptotical stability
sufficient condition is:

provided ku(n)k 6= 0.
The most interesting part of the inequality in Eq. (6.66) is the left-hand side nu￾merator, which for γ < 1 is negative. This suggests that the LLMS can be asymptot￾ically stable with a negative step size, i.e. with filter weights correction according to
the gradient of the cost function. This is because of the leakage of the filter weights,
which keeps the filter stable anyway. More details and many simulations supporting
this theoretical result can be found in [20].
6.4.3 FAST IMPLEMENTATIONS
Structural ANC algorithms are very demanding algorithms, when it comes to com￾putational power. Even if modern hardware offers very high clock rates and multiple
cores, the multidimensional nature of structural ANC can use all these resources and
demand more. One of the ways to lower this demand is to use algorithms with partialActive control systems 217
update of coefficient vectors [13]. Such algorithms are well known in signal process￾ing, but their leaky versions, which are necessary to be used in the structural ANC
applications, were rarely reported.
Partial updates (PU), or more precisely: partial parameter updates, is a technique
which updates only a certain subset of all adaptive filter coefficients in each sam￾pling period. Of course, the set of coefficients selected for the update must vary in
time, and the way of selection is the main factor in which particular PU algorithms
differ. There are two main groups of PU algorithms: data-independent algorithms
and data-dependent algorithms [40]. The application of an algorithm belonging to
the first group almost always results in a degradation of the performance. It is a
designers choice how much performance should be sacrificed in order to spare a pro￾cessing power, costs, etc. The application of data-dependent PU algorithms, on the
other hand, may even result in an increase of the performance, compared to the full
parameters update. However, these algorithms do not save as much of a processing
power as the data-independent algorithms do.
Partial updates can be used with any iterative gradient-based algorithm, but in this
section we will concentrate our attention on PU from the LMS family of algorithms.
Moreover, we will introduce and discuss the algorithms with leakage. Therefore, our
focus will be limited to the following algorithms:
• data-independent algorithms:
◦ periodic partial update leaky LMS algorithm (periodic LLMS),
◦ sequential partial update leaky LMS algorithm (sequential LLMS),
◦ stochastic partial update leaky LMS algorithm (stochastic LLMS),
• data-dependent algorithms:
◦ M-max partial update leaky LMS algorithm (M-max LLMS),
◦ M-max partial update leaky normalized LMS algorithm (M-max
LNLMS),
◦ selective partial update leaky (normalized) LMS algorithm (selective
LNLMS),
◦ one tap update leaky LMS algorithm (OTU LLMS).
Periodic LLMS Algorithm
The simplest idea to lower the processing power required for an adaptive algorithm
is to perform the filter weights update only once per several sampling periods. Thus,
the average update cost is lowered by spreading the computations of one update
over a selected number of sampling periods. The application of this idea to the LMS
algorithm may be expressed as:
w(S(n+1)) = γw(Sn) + µ u(Sn)e(Sn);
w(Sn+k) = γw(Sn), for k = 0,1,...,S−1; (6.67)
where S is the period of filter weights update, i.e. the number of sampling periods
used to perform one update. In between one and the next update the coefficients
calculated during the previous update are used to calculate the filter output:
y(n) = w
T
(bn/ScS)u(n); (6.68)
where b·c denotes the floor operation.218 Noise-Controlling Casings
General Notation of Other PU LLMS Algorithms
With an exception of the periodic LMS algorithm, all the other PU LLMS algorithms
discussed here can be expressed by [15, 16]:
w(n+1) = GM(n)w(n) + µ(n) IM(n)u(n)e(n); (6.69)
where GM(n) is the leakage matrix, IM(n) is the coefficient selection matrix, and
where the step size µ(n) = µ for the algorithms without the step-size normalization.
The main difference between the full update LLMS algorithm and the PU LLMS
algorithms lies in the matrix IM(n), which is defined as:
IM(n) =





; (6.70)
where
ik(n) ∈ {0,1},
N−1
∑
k=0
ik(n) = M. (6.71)
Thus, the weight selection matrix is a diagonal matrix, with the elements equal to
0 or 1, and the total number of 1s in the matrix is equal to M. The selection matrix
is also subscripted with the number M, because it is the maximum number of filter
weights that are selected for the update in each sampling period.
In each iteration, the elements on the diagonal of the selection matrix are selected
as equal to 0 or 1, according to the following formula:
ik(n) = (
1 if k ∈ IM(n)
0 otherwise
; (6.72)
where IM(n) denotes a set of the filter weights indexes that define the coefficients to
be updated in the nth iteration; the number of the elements in this set is equal to, or
less than M. Different variants of PU LMS algorithms define this set in a different
way.
The leakage matrix GM(n) is a diagonal matrix as well, and is defined as:
GM(n) =

where
gk(n) ∈ {1, γ}; (6.74)
gk(n) = (

1 otherwise
. (6.75)Active control systems 219
Specifically, the matrix contains elements equal to 1 in the rows corresponding to 0-s
in the IM(n) matrix, and the selected value of leakage γ in the rows corresponding to
1-s in the coefficient selection matrix. In this way, the leaky version of the PU-LMS
algorithm in Eq. (6.69) applies leakage in a particular iteration only to those coeffi￾cients, which are updated in this iteration. Otherwise, the advantage of processing of
only a subset of parameters would be ruined.
Sequential LLMS Algorithm
A basic idea of the Sequential LLMS algorithm is to update a predefined subset of
the filter weights in each iteration [43]. The number of subsets the filter is partitioned
with can be calculated as:
B = dN/Me; (6.76)
where d·e denotes the ceil operation. Only in a special case when N mod M is equal
to 0, the subsets will be of equal lengths, otherwise there will be B−1 subsets with
M coefficients and one subset with N mod B coefficients.
It is a designers choice how to partition the filter coefficients set. For example,
consider a simple case with N = 2M, e.g. the algorithm updates half of the filter
weights in each sampling period. In such case it is possible to update the parameters
with even indexes in one iteration, and the parameters with odd indexes in the next
iteration. The weights selection matrix (6.70) can then be written as:
IM(n) =diag(1,0,1,0,1,0...)
IM(n+1) =diag(0,1,0,1,0,1...). (6.77)
Another possibility is to update the first half of the weights in one iteration, and the
second half in the next iteration:
IM(n) =diag(1,1,1...0,0,0...)
IM(n+1) =diag(0,0,0...1,1,1...). (6.78)
Other choices are also possible.
A property of the Sequential LLMS algorithm is that the subsets created by par￾ticular partitioning of the weights vector and defined by the weights selection matrix
are processed in a sequence. Therefore, after B iterations all the weights are updated.
Stochastic LLMS Algorithm
It may be proved that the Sequential LMS algorithm is permanently unstable (re￾gardless of the step size) for some input signals, e.g. for cyclostationary signals [40].
The same may apply to the Sequential LLMS algorithm (dependent of the leakage
factor). To avoid this unwanted effect, the Stochastic LLMS algorithm can be ap￾plied. This algorithm selects the subsets of the weights to be updated on a random
basis. The random selection should be organized in a way that selects each of the220 Noise-Controlling Casings
subsets with equal probability. Thus, the set of filter weight indexes from Eq. (6.72)
is defined as:
P
￾
M(n) = k

= πk
, k = 1,...B,
B
∑
k=1
πk = 1; (6.79)
where P denotes the probability density function of an independent random process
M(n), and B = dN/Me.
Please note that it is necessary to randomize the subset selection rather than the
decision if to update every individual parameter. This assures that the complexity
reduction is attained during each sampling period. Please note also that the compu￾tational cost of the Stochastic LLMS algorithm is slightly higher than in case of the
Sequential LLMS, as the random selection mechanism requires more time than the
sequential selection. For further details refer to [54].
M-max LLMS Algorithm
Contrary to the previously described PU algorithms, the M-max LLMS algorithm
[42] is a data-dependent algorithm. The idea of the M-max LLMS is based on se￾lecting M those entries of the input vector u(n), that result in the largest magnitude
changes of the filter weights. Therefore, the weights selection matrix (6.70) entries
can be defined as:
ik(n) = (
1 if |u(n−k +1)| ∈ max
1≤l≤N
(|u(n−l +1)|,M)
0 otherwise
; (6.80)
where maxl(ul
,M) denotes a set of M maxima of the elements ul [40]. This algorithm
does not use normalization, therefore the step size is constant: µ(n) = µ.
The M-max LLMS algorithm requires ranking (sorting) of the input vector ele￾ments, based on their absolute value. Therefore, the time savings this algorithm offers
are smaller than in case of the data-independent algorithms. On the other hand, com￾putationally efficient sorting algorithms are now available [40]. Especially in cases
when the input vector is constructed from a tapped-delay line (as in Eq. (6.44)),
where only one sample is exchanged in each sampling period, the shift structure of
the input vector can be exploited to sort very efficiently [144].
M-max LNLMS Algorithm
The idea of M-max partial updates can also be applied to the normalized version of
the LLMS algorithm. In this case the weights selection matrix is defined identically
as in the case of M-max LLMS algorithm (see Eq. 6.80). However, this algorithm
performs the normalization of the step size:
µ(n) = µ˜
u
T (n)u(n)
. (6.81Active control systems 221
Selective LLMS Algorithm
The M-max LNLMS algorithm has a subtle drawback: it uses the power of the whole
input vector to normalize the step size in spite of the fact that only some of its el￾ements are used for the actual weight update. To correct this issue, it is possible to
calculate the normalized step size as:
µ(n) = µ˜
u
T (n)IM(n)u(n)
. (6.82)
This results in the algorithm known as the selective LLMS algorithm [2, 99].
It is also possible to derive the Selective LLMS algorithm as a result of instanta￾neous approximation of the Newton’s method, or as an application of the minimum
disturbance principle [40]. Both the derivations result in the update Eq. (6.69) and
the step-size normalization given by Eq. (6.82).
Although the difference between the Selective LLMS and the M-max LNLMS
algorithms is small, it results in a substantial differences in performance of the algo￾rithms, specifically in the rate of convergence. Examples are given in below.
One Tap Update LLMS Algorithm
Consider a case of the Selective LLMS algorithm with the extreme choice of M = 1,
i.e. the algorithm that updates only one tap during each sampling period. By com￾bining Eqs. (6.82) and (6.69) and using M = 1 we notice that the algorithm is given
by:
w(n+1) = γw(n) + µ˜
u
2
max(n)
I1(n)u(n)e(n), (6.83)
where umax(n) = max|u(n)| denotes the maximum absolute value in the input vector
at a discrete time n. The maximum absolute value umax(n) is assumed to be unique,
and if it is not, a single element corresponding to one of the maximum absolute
values in the input vector is selected for the update at a random basis.
Remembering that wk(n) denotes the k −th filter coefficient, the algorithm may
be expressed as:
wk(n+1) =



γwk(n) + µ˜ e(n)
u(n−k)
, if |u(n−k)| = max|u(n)|
wk(n), otherwise
. (6.84)
Thus, this simple update algorithm developed by Douglas [41], updates only one
coefficient—the coefficient that corresponds to the input sample with the maximum
absolute value. This algorithm will be referred to as the one tap update LLMS (OTU
LLMS) algorithm.
Considering the shift structure of the input vector, the maxline algorithm [144]
can be used for finding its maximum absolute value. The worst case computational
complexity of this algorithm is N +1 comparisons, and only one multiplication, one
division and one addition per iteration. However, it has been shown in [144] that the
average number of comparisons, in case of a random input data with the uniform
distribution, is approximately equal to 3 and does not increase with the filter length.222 Noise-Controlling Casings

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
All the models used in the research described in this chapter were obtained by iden￾tification experiments performed on the laboratory setup consisting of a cubic casing
with rigid corners and 1 mm thick aluminium plates. The casing was positioned in a
laboratory at least 70 cm from the walls; therefore five plates were controlled, while
the bottom was passively isolated. Each plate, 420 × 420 mm, was equipped with
three electrodynamic Monacor EX-1 5 Watt actuators, mounted in carefully selected
positions to improve controllability of the system. An error microphone was posi￾tioned in front of each wall. More details on the setup can be found in [103].
This setup resulted in 75 different secondary paths (15 actuators times 5 error
microphones), which were identified in a form of FIR filters with 256 parameters.
The identification experiments are described in details in [18].Active control systems 223
Figure 6.25 Secondary path transfer functions from the front plate actuators to the front
plate error microphone.
A part of the block diagram of the simulated control system, associated with one
plate (front) and one error signal, is presented in Fig. 6.24. The primary signal, u(n),
is routed through the reference path transfer function, X(z
−1
), to produce the refer￾ence signal, x(n). This reference signal forms the input to the three control filters,
associated with the front plate. Each control filter output signal is then filtered with
five different secondary path transfer functions. Of these transfer functions, only one
for each filter is visible in the figure (i.e. S1,1(z
−1
), S2,1(z
−1
), and S3,1(z
−1
)), while
the remaining four belong to the other error signal paths. In total,, each error signal is
a sum of 16 signals: one primary and 15 secondary, coming from the 15 actuators. All
the 5 error signals are used by each of the adaptation algorithms (denoted as LMS),
as well as the five reference signals (each filtered through a different secondary path
transfer function estimate). Exemplary secondary path transfer functions are illus￾trated in Fig. 6.25. Parameters of the simulated system are summarized in Table 6.6.
The step sizes were experimentally adjusted with a great care to achieve as fast
as possible convergence speed, but to avoid unwanted effects that frequently appear
in ANC systems with too large step sizes [11, 12]. Different leakage factors were
used for different control filters, with values from 0.99999 to 0.99. The procedure
to adjust the leakage factors was also experimental and depended on the observation
of the filter output signals. If a selected output signal was of a high power or of still
increasing values, the leakage factor was lowered until the effect was prevented.
Simulation results
Many simulations were performed, using different primary signals, always resulting
in a stable system, with different levels of attenuation. Below the results of one of
the experiments, using a single frequency (tonal) signal of 112 Hz and a white noise224 Noise-Controlling Casings

of small variance (0.0001), are presented and discussed.
Fig. 6.26 presents the MSE (averaged over 50 runs) for the third error microphone
signal during simulation with the leaky sequential PU-LMS and leaky M-max PU￾LMS algorithms, where the results of the full-update LLMS algorithm are showed
for comparison. The number of parameters updated in each iteration was selected as
16 (out of 128). As can be noticed (and as expected), the full-update LLMS algorithm
is the fastest to converge, the Sequential LLMS is the slowest, and the M-max PU
LLMS is between. This order (LMS fastest, Sequential PU-LMS slowest) was the
same for all error microphones.
Fig. 6.27 presents analogous plots for the algorithms with the normalized step
sizes, and contains the results of the full-update Leaky NLMS algorithm for com￾parison. In this case, the initial speed of convergence is comparable for all the algo￾rithms, but the final attenuation levels differ significantly. Both the NLMS (purple)Active control systems 225

and M-max PU-NLMS (green) algorithms result in around 25 dB of attenuation,
while the Selective PU-LMS reaches more than 40 dB. On the other hand, the One
Tap Update algorithms does not perform impressively and reaches only around 10 dB
of attenuation. Very similar results were obtained for the other error microphones.
The observed behaviour is typical to the PU algorithms, among which the data￾independent algorithms, while offering the best computational power saves, suffer
from decrease of convergence speed, proportional to the number of parameters which
are not updated in each iteration. The data-dependent algorithms, on the other hand,
usually perform comparably with their non-partial versions, but in some cases can
even outperform the full-update algorithms
Figs. 6.28 and 6.29 contain the results for the number of parameters updated in
each iteration equal to 8, for the first error signal. The results are similar except
for the fact that some of the algorithms exhibit a small increase of the MSE after
initial convergence. Ultimately the MSE starts to decrease around the middle of the
experiment. The attenuation levels after 100 s of the simulation is lower than in case
of M = 16.
As expected, the worst results were obtained for M = 4—see Figs. 6.30 and 6.31.
The attenuation levels obtained during the 100 s of the simulation are significantly
worse: only around 20 dB for the Selective PU-NLMS algorithms, and around 10 dB
for the others (except for the full-update algorithms, which are shown for compari￾son). From this fact one can conclude that 4 parameters for update is a number too
small in this complex application.
To conclude, the family of PU-LMS algorithms offers substantial computational
power savings without significant degradation of performance: in fact, the perfor￾mance can even be improved when compared to full update algorithms. PU-LMS
can be used with the leakage and can be applied to a structural ANC system of high226 Noise-Controlling Casings

dimensionality: 5 error sensors, 15 actuators and 75 secondary paths in total. Partial
update LMS algorithms perform well even when only one parameter out of 16 is
selected for update in each iteration.
6.4.4 MULTICHANNEL IMPLEMENTATIONS
Multichannel adaptive filters
Adaptive control algorithms have two significant advantages, when applied to ac￾tive noise-cancelling casings. First, due to delays in practical active noise-cancellingActive control systems 227
Figure 6.30 Simulation results for algorithms without step size normalization, M = 4.
Figure 6.31 Simulation results for algorithms without step size normalization, M = 4.
casings the optimal control filter is non-causal and in practice the filter must predict
future noise. Such prediction may be very successful for deterministic noise signals,
e.g. tonal or multitonal, frequently generated by devices with rotating parts. How￾ever, when the noise is nonstationary, for instance the rotational speed may change
in time, the control filter must be tuned for new noise. Adaptive control does ex￾actly that. Second, the active casing itself is non-stationary. For instance temperature
change might significantly change its frequency response [109].
The basic filter adaptation algorithms usually assume that the output of the filter is
directly added to the error e

(n), without secondary path (Fig. 6.32). Additionally, the228 Noise-Controlling Casings

source of the reference signal is not important, both feedforward and IMC structures
can be used.
As stated in Section 6.2.2 the goal of control system is to reduce noise emission.
Because the noise usually contains random components the expected value of the
noise emission should be minimized:

. (6.85)
In adaptive systems the expected value must be estimated using the currently avail￾able data. When the expected value operator is replaced with the arithmetic mean
based on currently available data, from sample 0 to sample n, the cost function de￾pends on time and becomes:

and this cost function is minimized by the RLS (Recursive Least Squares) algorithm
[61]. The classical RLS algorithm has very high computational complexity and in
active control applications Fast RLS algorithms are usually used [24, 31, 85]. Due to
infinite time window, for which the expected value is calculated, such algorithm is
not suitable for non-stationary systems. Thus, for active control applications usually
RLS with exponential window (WRLS) is used [27]:

This cost function can be minimized using MELMS (Multiple Error Least Mean

slower than for RLS. The basic weight update equation, without secondary path,
for MELMS with leakage is:

The third popular algorithm for active control is the AP (Affine Projection) al￾gorithm. The AP algorithm uses an average of K past samples as an estimator of

The AP algorithm has better convergence rate than LMS (Least Mean Squares), but
worse than RLS. For K = 1 the AP algorithm is equivalent to LMS algorithm. The
basic AP algorithm requires solving system of K linear equations with K variables.
Fast variants provide LMS like computational complexity [52]
Adaptive filters with a secondary path
Fig. 6.33 shows the structure of an adaptive system with a secondary path. In systems
with secondary path the error on output of the adaptive filter, needed for weight
update, is not available. There are two basic structures that neutralize the effect of
secondary path: filtered reference (FX) and filtered error (FE). The FX structure is
suitable for systems for which Wk,c and Sc,l operators commute: Wk,cSc,l = Sc,lWk,c
.
In that case the order of control filter and secondary path can be reversed (Fig. 6.34).

The system with inverted order of operators is not a physical representation of the
system and it can be only be simulated, and in simulation only a model of the sec￾ondary path, Sˆ, can be used. Thus, the Wk,cSc,l
is replaced by Wk,cSˆ

c,lxk(n) cannot be easily expressed as a vector, a matrix
multiplied by a vector of reference signals. Instead, we assume that the product of
this operator, Sˆ0
, is a signal represented with 3-dimensional array R(n), with values
defined as:
rk,c,l(n) = Sˆ
c,lxk(n). (6.92)
The calculation of full R(n) array in each sample can be very expensive, it requires
NXNU NE filtrations, each by filters with MS +AS parameters.

The second solution is to use FE (Filtered Error) structure. To make the secondary
path ‘invisible’ to the adaptation algorithm the error can be filtered by an inverse of
appropriate secondary path:
Sc,lS
−1
c,l = 1. (6.94)
Unfortunately, in practice the inverse of secondary path is non-causal. However, the
effect of secondary path and its ‘inverse’ can be equal to a simple delay:

Variable step-size algorithms
The stability and convergence rate of the LMS algorithm depends on the step size.
The maximal step size depends on the reference signal power. A commonly used
variant of the LMS algorithm that removes this dependence is the NLMS (Normal￾ized Least Mean Squares) algorithm with step-size defined as:
µk,c,l,o(n) = (Pk,c,l(n) +ζ )
−1µn, (6.96)
where µn is the normalized step size, and ζ is an optional small constant added to
avoid division by zero. In classic NLMS ζ = 0, αc,k,o(n) = 1 and for stable operation
without the secondary paths 0 < µn < 2 with optimal value for fastest convergence
µn = 1. The Pk,c,l(n) is equal to:

Switched error LMS
For large systems, the MEFXLMS (Multiple Error Filtered-Reference Least Mean
Squares) algorithm has very high computational requirements. The calculation of
output has O(NXNU NW ) asymptotical computational complexity, but Multichannel
FXLMS (Filtered-Reference Least Mean Squares) has O(NXNU NE(NW +NS)). Ad￾ditionally, the number of operations per coefficient is larger, thus scale proportional￾ity constant factor is larger. In many applications NS, related to filtration of reference
signals by secondary path models, is smaller or comparable to NW , and the addi￾tional dependence on NS is not a problem. However, the dependency on the number
of error signals NE leads to significant increase of computational requirements. Thi232 Noise-Controlling Casings
dependence can be eliminated by using only a constant number of error signals, one
in the simplest case, in each iteration [113]. So, in each iteration only a subset of
errors is active. As long as the step-size is small enough, and the switching is faster
than convergence rate, the switching has virtually no effect on steady-state perfor￾mance. In that case, the adaptation algorithm is not fast enough, to minimize only
currently selected errors. Effectively, the adaptation algorithm acts as low-pass filter
and high-frequency switching is attenuated. The equation of step-size for SEFXLMS
(Switched Error Filtered-Reference Least Mean Squares) becomes:
µk,c,l,o(n) = (Pk,c,l(n) +ζ )
−1
glµn, (6.98)
where gl(n) is equal to 1 if the jth error is active in nth iteration, it is equal to 0 other￾wise. As long as ∑
ME
l
0=0
gl <C, the asymptotical computational complexity is reduced
to: O(NXNU (NW +NENS)). The computational complexity can be further reduced to:
O(NXNU (NW +NS)), if the number the number of filtered reference signals does not
depend on NE, thus not all R(n) signals are calculated in each iteration. The error
is not active, gl = 0, R(n) is not needed in Eq. (6.96), however it is still needed in
classical NLMS normalization. Thus, to effectively use SEFXLMS another variable￾step size algorithm must be used. However, It is possible to approximate NLMS
behaviour without using unneeded for basic adaptation equation data. This can be
done, by using Eq. (6.98), but approximating Pk,c,l(n).
The variable step-size algorithm should not introduce unintentional weighting of
error signals, thus should satisfy the following condition [102]:
∀l1,l2∈{0,1,...,ME }
￾
E

µk,c,l1,o(n)
	
= E

µk,c,l2,o(n)
	. (6.99)
If the switching pattern and the reference signal are independent, this condition can
be satisfied if two following conditions are satisfied:
∀l1,l2∈{0,1,...,ME }
￾


gl1

Eq. (6.100) is satisfied with any correctly selected switching pattern [117]. The inde￾pendence of switching pattern and reference signal can be satisfied by using random
switching. Further details will be presented in Section 6.4.4.
Reference signal power estimation
In many cases noise is stationary or its statistical properties change slowly compared
to the switching period. In that case, it can be assumed that reference signals are
stationary, and the expected value of filtered reference signals does not depend on
time:

The performance of SEFXLMS with NLMS step-size normalization and both ap￾proximations has been tested in simulation on models and noise samples from a real
washing machine [120, 121]. The testing was performed using simulation to provide
exactly the same conditions for all variants. As expected, the performance of both
variants for stationary noise of the washing machine spinning at 1200 rpm is indis￾tinguishable from the performance with full NLMS normalization (Fig. 6.35). The
average step-size is very close to NLMS (Fig. 6.36). Even for non-stationary change
of spinning speed from 1000 rpm to 1200 rpm no significant changes we observed
(Fig. 6.37).

To avoid any bias caused by switching correlated with noise, the switching se￾quence a(n) should be random. However, in practice round-robin switching can be
used:
a(n) = 
n
NB

mod NQ, (6.112)
where NB is the number of samples for which selected set of active errors is enabled.
This is related to filtration of reference signals, by reference paths. When the error is
activated, to be able to perform control filter weight update also NS previous filtered
reference signal samples are needed. So the filtered-reference filtering must be en￾abled earlier, before error signal is activated. Thus, to avoid filtering too many signals
NB should be larger than NS. In that case, filtered reference signals for at most 2NQ
error signals must be calculated. Alternatively, after switching errors for NS adapta￾tion can be disabled. In that case, filtered reference signals for at NQ error signals are
calculated. This variant will be called “slow”.
Different SEFXLMS variants were tested on a models of a lightweight casing
and a washing machine. The lightweight casing uses 21 actuators and 5 error micro￾phones. The washing machine uses 13 actuators and 8 error microphones236 Noise-Controlling Casings
The simplest variant uses only one active error. For lightweight casing the switch￾ing matrix is equal to:

Fig. 6.38 shows the error signal power on all microphones around the lightweight
casing for 150 Hz tone and time needed to obtain 20 dB attenuation for a different
normalized step-size µn. For “slow” variant, NB = 2NS and after active error change
for NS samples adaptation is disabled. For “fast” variant, NB = NS. Fig. 6.39 shows
the difference between both variants.
The “slow” variant is roughly 2 times slower than “fast” variant, due to disabled
adaptation phase. This comes at cost of increased computational load, calculation
of NXNU secondary paths, related to next active error, is needed. Both variants are
slower than MEFXLMS. When, the convergence speed is important the “fast” variant
is recommended.Active control systems 237

The results are presented in Fig. 6.41. A larger number of error microphones allows
for higher step-size and provides faster convergence. However, for small step-sizes,
the differences are small.
Selection of step-size and leak factor
The performance of SEFXLMS system depends on the normalized step-size µn and
the leak factor αk,c,o(n). Higher leaks require higher step-size to achieve the sameActive control systems 241

noise reduction. It is convenient to introduce another coefficient γ and assume:
αk,c,o(n) = 1− µnγ. (6.122)
Fig. 6.42 shows the average SPL at error and monitoring microphones for a wash￾ing machine casing with loudspeaker placed inside drum for a different µn and the
same γ. The SPL is measured 15 minutes after enabling the active control. When
the step-size is too low the system is to slow to achieve full noise reduction after
15 minutes. When the step-size is too high, the noise reduction is degraded.
Fig. 6.43 shows the average SPL at error and monitoring microphones for a differ￾ent γ and the same µn. The degraded performance when the leak is high is expected.
However, the best performance should be achieved without leak, but small leak, im￾proves noise reduction. This might be related with a fact that leak reduces control
signal powers and the system is underdetermined without the leak. The system has
13 actuators and only 4 error signals and there are infinite number of different con￾trol signals that will provide the same noise reduction on error microphones. A small
leak will give preference to the combination with the smallest power.242 Noise-Controlling Casings

6.5 SUMMARY
This chapter was devoted to active control solutions, which add energy to the system
and rely on external energy power supply, but offer best noise reduction performance.
First, the necessary control hardware was described. This includes selection and
position optimization of sensors and actuators. It is a very important step, as the final
performance of the system depends on the controllability and observability mea￾sures of the system. Both actuators and microphones are considered from this point
of view. The employed control unit and related solutions are also appropriately pre￾sented.
Second, different control structures are discussed and compared. Practical so￾lutions including feedback cancellation and virtual microphone control are also
presented in details. Finally, the control algorithms themselves are discussed. The
FxLMS algorithm is considered as a basis, providing essentials and stability anal￾ysis. Then, appropriate modification are considered, including fast implementations
and multichannel architecture.Active control systems 243
It follows from the experiments performed on the active casings that active control
is am effective approach for noise reduction. It can respond to time-varying operat￾ing conditions. The complexity and cost of implementation can be high. However,
the active casing approach is much cheaper than classical active control, and noise
reduction can be obtained globally.Taylor & Francis

Summary
In this book a consistent approach to global reduction of noise generated by dif￾ferent kinds of devices has been proposed. The idea is to control vibration of the
device casing in order to reduce its noise radiation. The main benefit of that is the
autonomous character of the solution, what means that neither measurement com￾ponents, nor loudspeakers, nor any additional apparatus mounted outside the casing
is required. Three different types of casings, with different complexities of the phe￾nomena taking place, were considered, proposing solutions with varying degrees of
complexity, while providing the opportunity to tailor them to the specific problem or
noise-generating device.
A range of specific control strategies for noise-controlling casings are proposed in
this book, which can be divided into three categories followed from their complexity
and energy demand: passive, semi-active and active methods.
Passive solutions are characterized by a complete lack of the need for external
energy supply. One approach proposed by the authors is to optimally shape the vi￾broacoustic properties of the controlled structure (by shifting the natural frequencies)
basing on a previously prepared theoretical or numerical model. These modifications
can be made by adding mass, a damper, or increasing the stiffness of a selected
structure component in an appropriate manner, provided, e.g. by an optimization al￾gorithm. Functionally graded materials can be applied for the casing walls to increase
their acoustic isolation. Passive solutions can also include systems originally based
on semi-active or even active solutions, but powered by energy harvesting within
the system, which eliminates the need for external energy supply. Even 8 dB noise
reduction was achievable with the passive solutions for a real-world noise. This is
possible with a very low or even marginal cost of implementation, because many of
these solutions can be applied during manufacturing process of the casing.
The second category are semi-active solutions that require little power, but exter￾nal energy is only used to favourably change the properties of the system, therefore
it is not directly transferred into the system. Examples of such solutions are switched
shunt circuits connected to piezoelectric or electro-dynamic actuators. In such sys￾tems, the mechanical energy of vibrations is converted to electrical energy and then
dissipated or used to resist the vibrations. As a result, additional damping is intro￾duced in a selected frequency band or bands, however, systems of this type do not
induce themselves additional vibrations of the structure or in the acoustic medium.
Authors’ concepts are elements that favourably change the properties of the structure,
such as switchable link (coupling or decoupling selected components) or adjustable
additional masses. They operate like the previously described passive modifications,
but in the semi-active variant they can be adapted in real time to the requirements,
e.g. to the current noise spectrum. The energy is then used to switch or maintain a
given state of the semi-active actuator. Semi-active solutions resulted even in 12 dB
noise reduction. The cost of implementation and operation is really small because of
DOI: 10.1201/9781003273806-7 245246 Noise-Controlling Casings
low complexity of the electronic circuit, and using energy for the process of chang￾ing parameters of the system and response of the structure instead of compensating
for the noise itself.
The third category are active solutions. They have a greater energy demand but
achieve the highest levels of noise reduction exceeding 20 dB. They consist of ac￾tuators, sensors and a controller which, basing on the measurement signals, calcu￾lates the control signals in accordance with the selected algorithm. The actuators and
sensors may be both acoustic (e.g. speakers and microphones) and structural (e.g.
electro-dynamic exciters and accelerometers). These systems introduce additional
energy directly into the system, but they do not have to completely eliminate sys￾tem vibration. Often, it is enough to alter the vibration distribution appropriately to
enhance the effective insulation of the casing. Virtual sensing can be used to con￾trol acoustic pressures estimated using other measurements. The proposed solutions,
contrary to classical approach to noise reduction are generally much less compli￾cated, require less energy and do not interfere with arrangement of the space where
the device is located, providing global noise reduction at the same time.
The range of proposed innovative noise-reducing solutions offer a feasible al￾ternative to classical approaches, covering a wide range of potential applications,
even including cabins of vehicles and aircrafts. The authors believe that proposed
noise-controlling casings have potential to be widespread and hence contribute to
the struggle against excessive noise.
The presented idea can be further developed and improved by applying new
achievements in measurement and actuation technology, signal processing, control,
and new materials development.A Stiffness matrix elements
