Foreword
Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are renowned for being the 
backbone of the economy, and for good reason. In addition to contributing 
significantly to national gross domestic product (GDP) and employment, 
they provide local communities with vital goods and services.
It is also through the day-to-day encounters with these SMEs, whether that’s 
online or in our local neighbourhoods, cities and suburbs, that we enjoy the 
personable experience and entrepreneurial spirit that draws a special kind of 
support from their customers — particularly during tough times.
It goes without saying that starting a business is a huge achievement — but it’s 
only the first step. For many, the bigger challenge is growing and scaling, or 
operating confidently through difficult times. We need only look at the COVID-19 
pandemic and the economic fallout to see how quickly the environment can 
change and how key adaptability and resilience are to running a successful 
business.
As well as saving time and money, managing workflows and having real-time 
visibility over the entire operation, all from one place, arms business owners with 
a depth of information and the confidence they need to make the big calls and pull 
the right levers in the face of new challenges.
As one of the original tech start-ups, we have been a trusted provider of business 
management solutions to SMEs in Australia and New Zealand for more than 
30 years, but we’re not the same MYOB we used to be.
Since the last edition of MYOB For Dummies was published, we’ve invested in 
delivering a single Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that meets the changing 
needs of local businesses — from start-ups to established enterprises. In a world 
that is constantly evolving, we’re committed to ensuring our solutions continue to 
help businesses like yours start, survive and succeed.xvi MYOB For Dummies
This guide provides easy-to-follow, simple and helpful steps so you can not only 
learn the ropes but leverage your MYOB solutions to unleash your business 
potential.
As one platform for all your business management needs, we look forward to 
being by your side for each step of your exciting business journey.

Introduction
These days, all businesses rely on technology to help them operate on a daily 
basis — and the reality is, making the most of what modern technology has 
to offer can truly transform the performance of a business.
A central part of the success of any business hinges on having a great financial 
setup, which is where MYOB can have a huge impact. As a business management 
platform, MYOB is the perfect companion for helping you manage your custom￾ers, supply chain, employees and reporting, as well as the nitty-gritty of your 
finances, accounting and tax workflows.
MYOB has so many useful features that it’s common to feel overwhelmed when 
you first get started; fortunately, as with all new technologies, you soon find your 
way with practice. I’ve worked with many business owners who felt hesitant when 
starting their MYOB journey, and yet today they’re often showing me a thing or 
two about how to harness the power of MYOB!
I have brought together all my experiences with MYOB to share with you in this 
book and help you maximise the success of your business, from my own journey 
running a small business through to bookkeeping for many clients of different 
sizes and industries, as well as my time training accountants and bookkeepers to 
use MYOB effectively so they too can share their knowledge with their clients. 
With this in mind, cast your cares to the wind; be brave, be confident and read on.
About This Book
This book is a bit different from other books about MYOB, not least because this 
book is part of the For Dummies series. Dummies books aren’t about thinking that 
you’re a ‘dummy’ — far from it. What the For Dummies series is all about is shar￾ing a ‘can-do’ attitude and a fresh approach. I talk less about old-school ways of 
doing simple tasks, and more about how to get stuff done quickly, easily and 
accurately. Similarly, I tend to steer clear of pedantic explanations and instead 
suggest that you adapt MYOB to work the way you do, depending on the kind of 
business you have.2 MYOB For Dummies
I’ve written this book with both MYOB Business and MYOB AccountRight in mind. 
MYOB Business is the latest iteration of MYOB on the market and it delivers cloud￾based software that you can access straight from your browser — no installation 
required. Your business might be able to get all the functionality you need with 
one of the MYOB Business subscriptions available, but if you need a little more 
accounting oomph you may want to scale up towards an AccountRight subscrip￾tion. If you do opt for an AccountRight subscription, you can still use the amazing 
online features of MYOB Business direct from your browser, as well as access your 
file via the AccountRight desktop app. Chapter 1 talks all about your subscription 
options so you can start your MYOB journey on the right foot.
One more thing. Throughout this book you’ll see sidebars — text that sits in a 
separate box with grey shading. Think of sidebars as the chocolate topping on 
your ice-cream: A sprinkle of extra little bits that’s nice to have, but not essential.
Foolish Assumptions
Over the years, I’ve learned to assume as little as possible (especially true for 
accounting and bookkeeping!). However, to write this book, I did have to make 
two small assumptions about you, the reader:
» Your knowledge of computers and how they work is a little more advanced 
than knowing where to find the on/off switch.
» You either plan to purchase an MYOB Business or MYOB AccountRight 
subscription in the near future, or you already use MYOB and you’re looking 
to find out more about how to best use MYOB Business’s functionality to help 
streamline your business accounting.
Icons Used in This Book
What use is a For Dummies book without the little icons pointing you in the right 
direction? Here’s a brief description of the icons used in this book:
Don’t forget these little pearls of wisdom. Remember, remember, remember!Introduction 3

Every time you see a Warning icon, you can be sure I’m sharing a hard-earned 
lesson from personal experience!
Where to Go From Here
MYOB For Dummies is no great work of fiction (something that would be a tad 
tricky given the subject matter) and so doesn’t require you to start at the begin￾ning and follow through to the end. Instead, feel free to jump in and start reading 
from whatever section is most relevant to you:
» New to MYOB and trying to get a company file set up from scratch? I 
suggest you read Chapters 1, 2 and 3 to get your company file started. A clean 
start takes a bit of planning and, hopefully, these early chapters help you do 
just that.
» New to MYOB but the company file is already up and running? Maybe 
you’re starting a new job and, although the business has been using MYOB for 
a while, you’re new to the whole deal. In this situation, I suggest you start by 
reading the last half of Chapter 1 and all of Chapter 2 to familiarise yourself 
with the basics. Then browse through chapters 4 to 8 to discover how to do 
everyday tasks.
» New to MYOB Business but experienced with MYOB AccountRight?
You may be amazed at how MYOB Business’s functionality improves your 
experience of working with AccountRight. Chapter 1 clarifies how all the MYOB 
Business features described in this book can be accessed via AccountRight in 
a browser.4 MYOB For Dummies
» Familiar with MYOB but keen to advance your knowledge and expertise?
MYOB Business’s additional features may be transformative. Find out about 
advances in payroll functionality in chapters 11 and 12, and how you can use 
MYOB to lodge your Business Activity Statement in chapters 16 and 20 — and 
I highly recommend you explore how you can master reporting in Chapter 15.
» Want to know that your accounts are as clean as a whistle and your 
figures make sense? Excellent — what a great way to operate! Head to 
Chapter 9 to discover how to reconcile your bank account, Chapter 16 to 
check your GST codings and calculations, Chapter 17 to review your financial 
statements and Chapter 18 to put your company file through the health check 
from hell.1

Chapter 1
Introducing MYOB 
Business
MYOB Business is the new offering on the market that just radiates pink, 
purple and plenty of SaaS.  No, not sass  — SaaS! Software as a Service
(SaaS) is a software delivery model that MYOB uses to develop and main￾tain cloud software (in other words, the MYOB product known as MYOB Business) 
that always has the latest updates available to its customers on a pay-as-you-go 
basis.
It’s the way the world rolls these days — your Netflix, Spotify and Google accounts 
are all forms of SaaS, and as the customer you get lots of great benefits from sub￾scribing in this way. You no longer buy software as it soon becomes outdated, so 
MYOB Business is a month-by-month subscription model that gives you access to 
the latest and greatest features in a secure digital environment.
Being fully online brings many new, surprising and game-changing features to 
your MYOB subscription. Helped by the information in this book, I hope that you 
experience the benefits of this transformation, where MYOB is much more than 
accounting software, and instead is a business management platform that helps 
manage and grow your business by bringing everything you need to run a busi￾ness into one place.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Setting up for success
» Navigating through the setup guides
» Finding your way around — picking 
up the local lingo
» Accessing your file from anywhere
» Inviting important others to 
collaborate8 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
MYOB Business keeps essential business workflows at your fingertips  — from 
managing your customers and finances to onboarding employees electronically, 
all from within your file. New functions and workflows are added continuously, 
ensuring the financial health of your business is at the centre of everything you do.
For those using MYOB AccountRight, the ability to work fully online is a real 
bonus. You now have two platforms from which to access your file: Firstly, through 
the familiar MYOB AccountRight desktop app, and secondly by accessing your file 
directly from any internet browser. While not all features of AccountRight are 
available when you work in a browser, you do get many of the neat features of 
MYOB Business that aren’t available from the desktop app. This book explains all 
these features, plus more.
Throughout the book, I will often refer to how ‘AccountRight in a browser’ 
features can be of benefit to ensure all MYOB users find this book as helpful as 
possible. (The sidebar ‘I use AccountRight, what about me?’ provides more 
information on how you can use MYOB Business features with your AccountRight 
subscription.)
In this chapter, I share my ideas about getting you started with MYOB Business, 
highlighting what’s important (and ignoring what’s not) so you can get set up 
without any drama.
If you’ve recently subscribed to a new MYOB Business plan, the best place to start 
is the beginning of this chapter, which explains what information to have at the 
ready, the best time to start from an accounting perspective (if timing is a factor), 
and the basics of setting up customers, suppliers and accounts.
If you’re new to MYOB but a file is already up and running — maybe you’re start￾ing a new job as a bookkeeper — I suggest you skip straight to the second half of 
this chapter. Start reading from the section ‘Getting into the Groove’, which 
explains how to find your way around MYOB Business.
Planning to Get Started
The awesome thing about using MYOB Business is how quickly you can set up your 
file and get down to using it. Of course, this work will require a cup of tea and 
maybe even a biscuit or two, especially if you have many customers and suppliers 
to set up — which hopefully means business is good!CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 9
Choosing the right plan
Making a good choice now will save you time and moola in the long run. MYOB 
offers four different plan levels suitable for different types of businesses:
» MYOB Business Lite: The perfect plan for sole traders and those just getting 
started in business, MYOB Business Lite is great if you only require the basics 
of invoicing, bank feeds, payroll and reporting.
This plan has a limit of two bank feeds and two employees, so consider 
whether this is sufficient for your business.
As your business grows, you can easily move on to the Pro plan.
» MYOB Business Pro: Pro is the most popular plan for businesses looking to 
grow their business, such as those with more employees (requiring more 
involved payroll), as well as those wanting to automate timesheets or use 
sales orders. You can access more insightful reporting (including budgets), 
and you have no limits on the number of bank feeds you can connect or 
employees you can hire.
Note: Inventory can be added to both Lite and Pro plans. Chapter 10 covers 
the inventory features available in MYOB Business.
» MYOB AccountRight Plus: Moving to AccountRight, the Plus plan is a 
high-powered solution for bigger businesses with more complex needs 
(such as job costings, fully customisable form layouts, time billing invoicing 
or premium inventory functionality, which allows you to build items and use 
different pricing tiers when selling).
» MYOB AccountRight Premier: Top of the wozza, the AccountRight Premier 
plan is a must for any business working in multiple currencies and needing 
inventory locations (all other features are as per AccountRight Plus). However, 
another good reason to opt for Premier over Plus is that fees for additional 
files are heavily discounted (which is helpful if you operate multiple busi￾nesses, or run a company and a trust across two different ABNs).
With AccountRight Plus and Premier subscriptions, you can access your file 
via the AccountRight in a browser option (as well as via your AccountRight 
desktop icon), which gives you access to the many MYOB Business features and 
functions covered in this book. Skip to the nearby sidebar ‘I use AccountRight, 
what about me?’ to discover how to make the most of your AccountRight file by 
accessing it via a browser.10 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
If you’re still unsure which plan to choose, or you’re looking for a detailed com￾parison chart of all the features available across the four plans, I suggest you head 
to the MYOB website (myob.com). Alternatively, find a great accountant and/or 
bookkeeper to advise you based on your business needs (and who knows, you may 
continue your collaboration from here and throughout your business journey — a 
good accountant or bookkeeper is a business essential!).
Choose your plan carefully as moving up and down the plan levels has some 
limitations — for example, the move from MYOB Business Lite to MYOB Business 
Pro is easy, but moving from MYOB Business to MYOB AccountRight can be a long, 
manual task because you need to re-enter balances. However, you can migrate 
from an AccountRight plan to an MYOB Business plan and take your historical 
data with you (a process that MYOB will handle for you).
Starting your new MYOB file
With MYOB Business, you can choose to work anywhere, anytime, on any device — 
be it at the beach, on your phone, in front of the TV or in your home office. People 
can work more flexibly these days, so starting your MYOB file doesn’t need to be 
an office-bound exercise — you can get started whenever and wherever you may 
be if you have a suitable device in front of you.
Here are the first couple of steps to get you started:
1. Access MYOB Business at app.myob.com.
When you purchase your MYOB subscription, you will be asked for your email 
and then prompted to set up a password for accessing your file.
2. Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a secure sign-in process that combines 
something you know (like your password) with something you have (your 
phone or email). MYOB Business requires you to set up 2FA as part of your 
setup process to keep your data safe and secure. You can either choose to 
receive your 2FA code by email, or you can receive your code on your mobile 
device via an authenticator app; generally, your mobile device is more secure 
as you’ll almost always have it with you.
Of course, it goes without saying — don’t share your password with anyone. 
Each user should have a unique login linked to their email, enabling a clear 
audit history to be attached to each user.
MYOB is rolling out a third 2FA option (sending a code by text message to your 
smartphone), which may be accessible by the time you read this book — 
I know this would be my first choice for securely receiving a 2FA code.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 11
I USE ACCOUNTRIGHT, WHAT ABOUT ME?
If you have an AccountRight subscription, everything that I cover in this book can also 
be applied to AccountRight when you access your online file via a web browser. MYOB 
Business and ‘AccountRight in a browser’ are effectively the same product. This 
‘browser’ option isn’t intended to replace your current AccountRight subscription (and it 
won’t, as AccountRight has many features that aren’t available in MYOB Business yet); 
rather, the browser option has the advantage that you can work from any device, and 
provides access to some great features currently only available in MYOB Business, such 
as report customisation and report packs.
Trust me: Jump into your AccountRight file now and at the very top right you will see the 
Open in Web Browser option. Click through to explore this different way to use 
AccountRight.
When you first start experimenting with AccountRight in a browser, you’re likely to have 
the AccountRight software and the browser option open (and yes, you can work across 
both options simultaneously, as the data syncs as soon as you save). You may favour 
doing certain tasks in AccountRight and others via a browser (for example, allocating 
and searching bank transactions works well in a browser because of the additional bank 
feed features in MYOB Business, such as being able to edit bank transaction descrip￾tions while keeping the original description visible, as well as the option to use allocation 
templates and add adjustments to transactions). It may take time to find your groove, 
but you’ll soon discover which functions you prefer to access using your AccountRight 
software, and which functions you prefer to access from a browser.
Note: You don’t need to download the AccountRight software to access your data via a 
browser. Simply open a web page and login at app.myob.com to access your 
AccountRight file from any device.
The only trick is to ensure that your company file is using the latest version of 
AccountRight. If it’s not, MYOB will prompt you to upgrade your file the first time you 
access your file via a browser. All AccountRight software can be downloaded and 
updated at myob.com (go to the Support tab, then Software Downloads). Using the 
latest version also ensures your file always has the latest compliance updates from the 
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and fixes any bugs in the software to help your product 
work the best it can.
Using AccountRight in a browser might change the way you work for the better, so give 
it a go!12 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Setting up to be a winner
As with most things in life, success with SaaS is all about getting the setup right. 
While everything in your file (well, almost everything — just not your start date) 
can be fixed should you slightly biff some information in your setup, doing it right 
in the first instance will save you time in the long run.
Here’s a quick summary of the processes involved in getting set up with MYOB 
Business, so you know what to expect as you work through this book:
1. Get your business details ready.
Be sure you have the correct business ABN of the business (critical if you will 
be doing invoicing and payroll), the entity name, trading name, address, phone 
and email details at hand before you start setting up your file.
2. Decide on a start date (the opening balance date).
If you’re not sure what your start date should be, skip to the nearby sidebar 
‘When is the best time to start?’ to help you decide on your opening balance date.
It is also important to know your start year, not just the date. While it may 
seem obvious (it’s this year, surely?), it is worth knowing that you can go back 
and enter data for prior years if you need to. (Maybe you’ve been travelling in 
the Bahamas and not yet done last year’s returns and have lots to catch up 
on; if so, lucky you!)
You may wish to discuss this opening balance date with your accountant or 
bookkeeper because after you begin to enter transactions, this date becomes 
locked and you can’t change it (unless you delete all data entered to date, but 
really who wants to waste time like that). So, be sure of this date!
3. Follow the guides on your Dashboard for getting started.
The first time you log in, these guides pop up at the top of your Dashboard 
based on the features available in your subscription. These guides step you 
through a quick setup for each feature. I highly recommend using these guides 
to set up MYOB — after all, a little help along the way is always a bonus! (I cover 
some of the key guides in the upcoming section ‘Using MYOB’s Getting Started 
Guides to Set Up Your File’.)
4. If you’re new to MYOB, take the time to have a good old stickybeak.
In the thick of this chapter, in the section ‘Getting into the Groove’, I take you on 
a grand tour.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 13
5. Go to the Accounting menu and click Chart of Accounts. Customise this 
list to fit your business.
I always recommend tweaking your Chart of Accounts to fit your business, 
adding accounts, changing account names or deleting accounts that you don’t 
need. I explain how to add and edit accounts in Chapter 2, and how to record 
opening balances in Chapter 3.
6. Connect your bank feeds.
I talk lots more about bank feeds in Chapter 5 (and I mean lots more, because 
I just love them!), where I explain how they work with MYOB and how to connect 
your bank feeds. I also show you how they may be the number one MYOB 
feature for reducing your data entry time, which helps you be more accurate and 
reconcile with ease. I suggest you connect your bank feeds as soon as possible.
7. Invite others to work with you.
If you have employees who are going to work in MYOB, you need to set them 
up with their own user access. Also share the love with your bookkeeper 
and accountant so they too can access your company file from anywhere, 
anytime. (I talk more about user roles later in this chapter in ‘Inviting Others 
to Access MYOB’.)
8. Enter some sales transactions.
If you create invoices to send to customers, recording sales is a great way to 
get started with getting to know MYOB. (I explain how to add customers in 
Chapter 2, how to enter opening balances in Chapter 3, and how to record 
sales in Chapter 4 — what a ride!)
9. Start creating your invoice templates.
The later section ‘Preparing for sales’ covers invoicing in more detail.
10. Record a few bills and expenses.
From the moment you start recording bills and expenses, you can start looking 
at your profit and how the business is tracking. For more about recording bills 
and expenses, see chapters 6 and 8.
11. If you buy, sell and track items (rather than services), set up your 
inventory.
If tracking stock is something your business needs, then head on to Chapter 10, 
read it faithfully, and set up your inventory before going any further.
12. If you have employees, have all their details ready for setting up payroll.
If you’re going to use payroll, you should do so from the very beginning of the 
payroll year (July). When you’ve completed the rest of your setup, hop to 
chapters 11 and 12, which cover payroll in depth.14 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
You never need to back up your data — MYOB Business will take care of your data 
for you. While the sound of this may scare some of you, in particular if you are an 
AccountRight user, be reassured that your data is being backed up automatically 
for you. The only kind of personal backup option you have in MYOB Business is 
exporting reports to Excel, and who has time for that?
If you feel anxious about having some kind of tangible backup, you can ease your 
mind by creating a report pack (see Chapter 15) that includes all your financial 
reports and which you can export monthly. Save this monthly report pack in a 
secure place so you can access the data should you ever need to — or purely for 
reassurance purposes.
Gathering your wits about you
You wouldn’t set off across the Nullarbor Plain without water or fuel, would you? 
Nor should you attempt to set up MYOB without a couple of essentials close to 
hand to make your setup easier. Here’s what you need at the ready:
» If you’re setting up MYOB for an established business, the most recent 
set of tax returns or final accounts you have available: Previous Profit & 
Loss reports and even tax returns come in handy, helping you to work out 
what accounts to include in your Chart of Accounts and opening balances.
WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO START?
The very best time of year to start recording your accounts is the start of the financial 
year (that’s 1 July for 99 per cent of Australian businesses). Even if July is long gone by 
the time you’re ready to get started, it’s still probably best to start by entering accounts 
from the beginning of that financial year.
Why? If you start on the first day of a new financial year, the transition from your old 
accounting system to your new one is a cinch. That’s because accounts are always 
finalised at the end of each financial year. These final accounts provide the opening 
balances for the following year and save you paying your accountant to draw up interim 
accounts.
In your MYOB Business file, you simply need to select an opening balance date 
(remember, once you start to enter transactions, this date becomes locked and can’t 
be changed). Your accountant and bookkeeper can guide you here if you’re unsure of 
the correct date to enter, especially if you’re not up to date with all your tax liabilities. 
The later section ‘Getting your settings right to save you time’ explains how you can 
change your opening balance date from the default date in MYOB.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 15
» Bank statements and credit card statements: You need bank statements 
so that you can enter the opening balance of your bank account for the date 
that you start using MYOB. Depending on whether or not you already have 
bank feeds activated, you may also need bank statements as a reference for 
recording transactions.
» A list of who owes you money: It’s always cheering when you realise that if 
everyone coughed up tomorrow, you’d actually be quite rich.
» A list of everyone you owe money to: If you intend to record supplier bills (I 
talk lots more about this decision in Chapter 8), make a list of everyone you 
owe money to at the time of starting your MYOB file. (Supplier statements are 
helpful when collating this information.)
Using MYOB’s Getting Started Guides 
to Set Up Your File
When you first log in to your MYOB file, your Dashboard is the first page that will 
display. Think of it like your home page. (I particularly like the positive affirma￾tions MYOB shares with you every day here, such as ‘Attitude is everything’, 
‘Make today count’ and ‘When you feel like quitting, remember why you started’!)
After the welcoming affirmation, you will see various ‘getting started’ guides 
listed (the suggested guides may vary depending on your role in the business, 
along with your industry and subscription features). These guides demonstrate 
MYOB’s features and help you customise and set up your file (see Figure 1-1).
FIGURE 1-1:
When you first 
log in, MYOB 
provides a range 
of ‘getting started’ 
guides on your 
Dashboard to 
help you set up 
your file.16 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Simply click into the guide for each area of your setup (such as Connect to Your 
Bank or Upload Your Bills and Receipts, as shown in Figure 1-1), depending on 
what requires attention.
Once you click on a guide and then return to your Dashboard (even if you haven’t 
run through the whole guide), that guide will no longer appear — so ensure you 
complete the guide before you navigate elsewhere. If you are confident you know 
what to do to set up your file, you can also click the ‘x’ in the top-right corner of 
the guide to remove it from your Dashboard rather than running through the 
stages of the guide. (Likewise, if one of the guides isn’t relevant to your business, 
such as Set Up Your Payroll — maybe you don’t yet have employees — you can 
simply remove it from your Dashboard by clicking the ‘x’.) And if you lose sight of 
one of the guides — maybe MYOB thinks you’ve already completed it fully because 
you opened it that one time — then hopefully you can find the information you 
need in this book!
No time to look at the guides now? Don’t stress — these tasks will remain on your 
Dashboard until you complete them, so you can come back later (as long as you 
haven’t opened the guide yet).
With software changing so often, it can be hard to keep up with all the new fea￾tures and the way they work. To help with this, on the menu bar there is a ques￾tion mark symbol that opens an in-product MYOB Help window for the page 
you’re on. The format is always the same, no matter what page you’re on — it 
gives you an overview of the current page (for example, the Dashboard), some 
useful FAQs and links to all the relevant Help information relating to the current 
page.
The following sections introduce how to make your MYOB Business file work for 
your business.
Getting your settings right to save you time
Before you get too deep into completing your setup, your first stop on your Dash￾board should be to review your Business Settings. Your Business Settings need 
your attention early as many other setup steps will pull information from here 
into other areas of MYOB Business.
A note here on finding your Settings: At the time of writing, you can find your 
Settings by clicking your business’s name in the top-right corner of your screen 
and then selecting from the drop-down list of Settings options that appear (for 
example, Business Settings, Sales Settings, Purchases Settings  .  .  . you get the 
idea!). However, a future menu layout may see the Settings being promoted to the 
Dashboard, where the Settings menu will be visible from all pages. Wherever your CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 17
Settings are found when you come to use this book, I’m sure you will find that 
your Settings options are much the same. I discuss all your Settings in this and the 
following sections.
On the Business Settings page, be sure your business and trading names are cor￾rect, along with your ABN and contact details. Your industry details are optional, 
but I recommend choosing a specific industry code as this may help with the setup 
of your file in particular areas, such as the Chart of Accounts. As recommended in 
the sidebar ‘When is the best time to start?’, have a chat with your accountant or 
bookkeeper about what your opening balance date should be (you need to get this 
right before you start to enter transactions).
You should also chat to your accountant or bookkeeper before choosing the Start 
New Financial Year option (under the current financial year date) as this should 
usually be left to the professionals. Why? Because it can impact your reporting if 
you start a new financial year at the wrong time, and this change cannot be 
reversed once you start to enter data.
At this point you can continue to review the other settings options available, or go 
back to the Dashboard and complete the guides first. Here’s a rundown of the 
other settings and functions you can adjust so that MYOB works the way you need:
» Income Allocation: This setting can be used to set up how income is allo￾cated to stakeholders in a company, partnership or unit trust.
Specific Chart of Accounts items need to be set up for these stakeholders, so 
good accounting knowledge is required here, as is a clear understanding of 
your business structure. Your accountant or bookkeeper may be the best 
person to set this up for you when needed.
» Sales Settings, Payroll Settings and Purchases Settings: These key settings 
are covered in depth in their respective chapters: Chapter 4 for sales, chapters 11 
and 12 for payroll, and Chapter 8 for purchases.
» Report Settings: This is where you set your reporting methods for accounting 
and GST (either Accruals or Cash) and how you want figures to be displayed in 
your reports. If you’re unsure, your accountant can offer some guidance. I 
cover reporting in detail in Chapter 15.
» Users: Turn to the later section ‘Inviting Others to Access MYOB’ for more on 
user access.
» Import and Export Data: Here, you can import charts, contacts, employees, 
items and timesheets if you have this information in another application and you 
want to get this data into your MYOB file quickly (saving data entry time). The 
export side tends to be used by your accountant when they need to get your 
data out and into their tax software to prepare your financials at the end of year.18 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Importing data into MYOB does take some skill to get the template set up 
correctly. If you click on the Help question mark while on this page, MYOB 
offers some tips to help you get started, as well as some templates you can 
use to get the formatting right when you import data.
Three other areas also appear when you click your business’s name:
» My Account: Manage your MYOB subscription here, including upgrading your 
subscription, updating your credit card details or viewing your bills.
» Contact Support: Unless your support needs are urgent and merit a phone 
call to MYOB, you can use this section to send a message directly to MYOB. A 
support agent will email you to resolve your issue or collect more information 
if needed.
» App Marketplace: MYOB has a whole ecosystem in place to look after other 
aspects your business may need, specific to your industry or business size 
perhaps. As your business grows, adding apps may help bring new workflows, 
efficiencies and scalability to your business and expand the impact of your 
MYOB Business platform.
The apps here are provided by third parties and integrate with your MYOB 
software, and there are hundreds to explore. The App Marketplace has a 
search feature you can use to peruse the available apps and work out what 
your business may need. Note: Some apps only integrate with AccountRight 
or MYOB Business, while others integrate with both, so be sure to check out 
the compatibility of each app.
Setting up your Chart of Accounts
After you have reviewed all your settings, I recommend you review your Chart of 
Accounts (which you can find by heading to the Accounting menu and selecting 
Chart of Accounts from the drop-down list). The default Chart of Accounts that 
appears for you is based on the industry you select when you first create your 
company file and/or the specific industry code you select in the Business Settings 
(refer to the preceding section). The tax codes shown will also reflect whether you 
select GST Registered or not when you create your file.
If you’re in a hurry, you don’t have to make any changes to your Chart of Accounts 
right now — you can always come back. However, if you have the time, you’re best 
to start by customising your Chart of Accounts before you go on so that it has all 
the accounts you need for your business. Go to Chapter 2 to find out how to cus￾tomise your chart so it’s fit for your business purposes, and head to Chapter 3 to 
find out how to add account opening balances to get you off to a good start.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 19
You don’t need to scroll down for miles to look through your accounts. Use the 
tabs across the top of the page to take you direct to the different account types, 
such as Income or Expenses accounts.
Connecting bank feeds
Bank feeds replace the need for you to enter transactions manually, freeing up 
time for you to do other things you enjoy more in your business.
Rest assured, adding bank feeds doesn’t give anyone at MYOB permission to 
access your bank! The best way to think of bank feeds is as an electronic copy of 
your bank transactions that your bank is simply passing to MYOB on your behalf.
The getting started guide ‘Connect to Your Bank’ is a great place to find out how 
to connect your bank feeds, but if you find you need a little more help then 
Chapter 5 takes you through all things relating to bank feeds.
Preparing for sales
If you plan to use MYOB to create invoices for your customers, customising your 
Sales Settings is a wise move.
I don’t need to bore you by explaining every little itsy bit (these explanations are 
reserved for Chapter 4); instead, I clarify here the stuff most likely to cause you 
strife:
» Layout. If you’re not sure what layout to select, I suggest you click the Services 
and Items layout as the default. This layout works well not just for items, but 
for services too. To help you decide on the best layout for your business, see 
Chapter 4.
» Templates. Create an invoice template to suit your business by clicking the 
Create Template button. Name this template (so that if you create other 
invoice templates, they are identifiable by name) and mark if you want this to 
be your default template. You can add a logo and coloured lines, and select 
the business details you want to show on your invoice (including where they 
appear).
You can also select at the top right if you want this same template to be used 
on your Quotes and Statements. When you’re done, hit the Save button.
» Payments. Select the payment terms you are offering to your customers, and 
add your bank account details so that customers can pay by direct deposit.20 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
You can also set up Online Invoice Payments (OIP) here so customers can pay 
by Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Apple Pay and Google Pay. I cover OIP and how it 
may help improve the cashflow of a business and help you get paid faster in 
Chapter 7.
» Notes to Customer. Customise the message at the bottom of your invoice 
by clicking Create Note (give the Note a name and add the text you want). 
Chapter 4 covers more about Notes and how to create great invoices.
» Email Defaults. As your invoices are generally sent via email directly from 
your file, you need to set the Reply-to Email Address for any replies from the 
customers receiving your invoices. You can also set a default email subject 
and generic email message, helping customers to recognise who the email is 
from and what it contains.
» Reminders. This is a definite game-changer. If you are on top of allocating 
deposits as soon as they hit your bank, you will want to turn this feature on. 
Without even logging into your file, MYOB will send clients invoice copies as a 
reminder when they are overdue. Yes, you heard that right. MYOB will do all 
the hard work for you — after all it is the squeaky wheel that gets the oil! 
Chapter 7 talks more about this feature.
» eInvoicing. This is the new kid on the block and still a pretty novel concept. 
eInvoicing sends and receives electronic invoices (eInvoices) via a secure 
gateway (rather than by email) directly between different accounting services; 
for example, if a customer uses Xero, MYOB can send your invoice straight 
into your customer’s Xero account and vice-versa. Setting this up takes a few 
minutes and offers fast and accurate data entry and a higher level of security 
to protect you from email fraud. The ATO is starting to gear up the push 
towards using eInvoicing, so it’s something to consider in the not-too-distant 
future. Chapter 4 has all you need to know on eInvoicing.
Talking about suppliers
You only need to complete this section if you plan to use MYOB to create purchase 
orders or record supplier bills (see Chapter 8 for my words of wisdom regarding 
this decision). Reviewing your Purchases Settings is quick and easy once you have 
sorted out your Sales Settings (refer to the preceding section).
I expand on setting up your supplier contacts in chapters 6 and 8, where I also 
explain a few cool features available to help you improve workflows. Chapter 3 
covers entering historical purchases, in case you also need to do this.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 21
Bracing for payroll
If you have employees to pay, then your Payroll Settings should be next on your 
list to review in the Business Settings.
Payroll is the most complex part of any accounting software setup, especially if 
you have several employees with different rates of pay and a complex industrial 
award to boot. For more on payroll, make your way over to Chapter 11 (where I 
cover setting up payroll in detail) and Chapter 12 (where I explain the day-to-day 
workings of payroll, including processing pays and understanding Single Touch 
Payroll).
Getting into the Groove
Before leaping into the deep end and entering transactions, it helps to know where 
MYOB hides things so you can get a good feeling for what sits where on the 
platform.
Understanding what goes where
MYOB stores key information and data relevant to your business in the different 
menus on your Dashboard. Based on your MYOB subscription level, you only see 
the menu items you have access to, as shown in Figure 1-2.
You can access these essential areas of your business from the different menus as 
follows:
» Contacts (either under the Contacts menu, or under the ‘More’ menu, 
depending on your device): Stores information about customers and 
suppliers. You can set up a new contact before you record transactions, or 
you can create a contact on the go within a transaction (simply click + Create 
from the Contact drop-down list). Chapter 2 explains how to add, edit and 
delete contacts.
» Employees (either under the Payroll menu, or under the ‘More’ menu, 
depending on your device): Here, you can find all your employees’ details — 
even for those who no longer work with you. Chapter 11 explains how to set 
up employees correctly.
» Chart of Accounts (Accounting menu): You will find your Chart of Accounts 
here: a list of asset, liability, equity, income and expense accounts relevant to 
your business. Chapter 2 explains how to add, edit and delete accounts.22 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
» Items (accessed via the Sales, Purchases and Inventory menus): You can 
find items in all three of these menus. Items shows a list of items that you buy 
or sell, and that you can track with MYOB’s inventory functionality. You can 
use the Items list to store details for services that you sell, not just physical 
items. Chapter 10 explores your items and inventory in detail.
Your transactions are stored within the relevant menus as follows:
» Find Quotes, Sales Orders and Invoices by clicking the Sales menu (Chapter 4).
» Find Purchase Orders and Bills by clicking the Purchases menu (Chapter 8).
» Find bank feed transactions by clicking the Banking menu and going to Bank 
Transactions (Chapter 5).
» Search your transactions by clicking the Banking menu and going to Find 
Transactions. Find Transactions is the Holy Grail for finding all transactions 
entered into your MYOB file, including journals, cash transactions and payroll 
transactions. Turn to Chapter 6 to find out more. (Note: For AccountRight 
users, Find Transactions is similar to the Transaction Journal function.)
» Find pay run transactions by clicking the Payroll menu and going to Pay Runs 
(see chapters 11 and 12 for more).
» Find all your business reports by clicking the Reporting menu, selecting 
Reports and starting to explore the available Business reports (Chapter 15).
FIGURE 1-2:
Viewing the 
MYOB Business 
Dashboard.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 23
Working out your Dashboard
Your Dashboard provides a snapshot of how your business is doing. You can 
quickly see how many transactions remain unallocated, the number of documents 
you have sitting in the In Tray, and how many overdue invoices and bills you have. 
Click on any of these boxes to drill down for more information.
The real insights are evident in the widgets based on the current data entered into 
your file. You get a nice tidy graph showing Income for the last three or six months, 
compared with the same time last year so you can track if sales are improving (the 
same goes with the Expenses widget). You also glance at your GST liability amount 
for the current reporting period and check that your pay runs are up to date. The 
one that most of my clients really like and talk about often is the Financial Posi￾tion widget (graph of the profit and loss), which provides a helpful way for you to 
keep an eye on your business.
At the time of writing, these widgets are static; however, hopefully in the not￾too-distant future you will be able to customise your Dashboard by choosing the 
widgets that are most useful to you.
Setting priorities
Earlier in this chapter, in the section ‘Setting up to be a winner’, I provide a sum￾mary of the steps you need to take when getting started. This summary provides 
a good overview of all the steps that are involved but, in real life, time pressures 
may mean that you can’t work through everything step by step.
If I’m setting up MYOB for a client and time is of the essence, I tend to prioritise 
certain activities over others. To help you do the same when time is tight, priori￾tise the following:
1. First, always check the Business Settings are correct as errors here have 
a flow-on effect.
2. Set up customers, make sure your invoice template is set up to include 
payment details and start to record customer sales (see chapters 2
and 4).
You can also start recording customer payments at this time, so you know who 
truly owes you money (see Chapter 7).
3. Connect your bank feeds as soon as possible to free up your time and 
allow you to start recording all transactions going in and out of your 
business bank accounts (see chapters 5, 6 and 7).24 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
4. If your business has employees, set up payroll, start recording employee 
pays and connect to Single Touch Payroll (STP) for ATO reporting so you
are complying with your payroll obligations (see chapters 11 and 12).
5. After two or three weeks have passed, do your first bank reconciliations
and check everything has been recorded correctly (see Chapter 9).
6. As time allows, review and customise your Chart of Accounts to make
reporting more helpful for your business.
If you come into a business as a new bookkeeper and MYOB is already up and run￾ning, your priorities are going to be slightly different. In this situation, I suggest 
that you focus on ensuring day-to-day transactions are up to date, that bank 
reconciliations are complete and accurate (see Chapter 9), and that payroll has 
been set up correctly and STP reporting is accepted by the ATO (see chapters 11 
and 12). Reviewing the General Ledger report gives a good insight into the lay of 
the land and what may need your immediate attention.
Once you’re sure the basics are in place, you can also check that GST reports are 
working properly (see Chapter  16) and that the financial reports make sense 
(Chapter 17). You can then give the company file a thorough health check from 
head to toe (Chapter 18).
Finding Your File Online
The most straightforward activities sometimes seem confusing when everything 
is new. Read on to find out how to log out of your company file when you’ve had 
enough, and to log back in again when you’re ready for more.
Logging back in
A new day has dawned and you want to jump back into your MYOB Business file. 
Where to begin? It’s super simple:
1. Open a web page and search app.myob.com.
You should find the MYOB login page pops up, waiting for your email and 
password. I recommend saving this page as a favourite (if you’re using Edge as
your browser) or bookmarking it (if you’re using Chrome or Firefox). Next time, 
you can simply click on this link.
MYOB recommends using Chrome, Edge or Firefox browsers for the best
usability as they are up to date with the latest tech and security features.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 25
2. Enter your email and password.
The first time you set up your file you would have created a password, 
so hopefully you can remember it!
If it is your third attempt with no luck, be sure to click ‘show’ to make sure you 
aren’t stuck on caps lock — an easy trap to fall into. Check out the later sidebar 
‘What to do if you forget your password’ if you get truly stuck.
Try and make your password as strong as you can — this file contains your 
confidential business information, so keep it as secure as possible. Don’t share 
your password with anyone — if they need legit access, add them as a 
separate user (see the later section ‘Adding new users and assigning roles’).
3. Enter your 2FA or SMS code.
Once you have entered your password, MYOB will ask for your authentication 
code — refer to the earlier section, ‘Starting your new MYOB file’. This code will 
either be sent to your email or the authenticator app on your phone (the 
pop-up window will tell you which; see Figure 1-3).
You have the option to tick Trust This Device for 30 Days, but only do this if you 
are the only one who uses this device. If you share this device with others, don’t 
select this option or allow others to log in using your credentials, because if any￾thing goes wrong while they are using your login, the Journal Security Audit 
Report will point the finger at you! Chapter 18 covers the magic of this report.
FIGURE 1-3:
Enter your 
two-factor 
authentication 
code from your 
email or using the 
authentication 
app, as 
requested.26 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Packing up and going home
You’re tired and want to go home — it’s time to quit for the day. To close MYOB, 
simply head for your business name, click into the drop-down menu and select 
Log Out.
Depending on your security settings, if you just close the browser window and 
then log back in on another tab or window, you may find you can just log straight 
back in with no additional authentication. This is fine if you’re a risk-taker — but 
not recommended! Selecting Log Out adds that extra layer of security, which I am 
WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN’T ACCESS 
TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)
If you were at a rave on Saturday night and you lost your phone, how would you log in 
to MYOB on Monday morning? Resetting your password is easy; the same can’t be 
said of losing access to your 2FA if you damage, lose or replace your phone. This is to be 
expected — after all, the whole idea of 2FA is to provide a second layer of protection that’s 
difficult to work around, and therefore effective at keeping unauthorised people out.
You need to begin by logging in at my.account.myob.com. If you still have access to 
your old phone, you can use the 2FA code from there to set up a new device.
If you are now device-free and unable to use 2FA to access your account, you have three 
options available:
• Depending on when you first signed up for 2FA, you may still have the 2FA backup 
codes you received when you set up 2FA. These codes are no longer offered, but if 
you do have them you can visit my.account.myob.com, select ‘Don’t have your 
code? Try another way’ (in very small writing just under the code box) to open the 
backup code option, use one of these backup codes (one-time use) to get through 
the security to change to your new device.
• Click Email Me a Recovery Code and MYOB will send you an email to get you 
through the login process.
• Failing these two options, you may need to call MYOB Support (on 1300 555 123), 
verify who you are and they will then email you the recovery code so you can get 
your new device set up.
Though it can be frustrating to go through this process, just remember this layer of 
security is designed to keep your data protected. To minimise future drama, remember 
to keep your emails and phone as secure as possible.CHAPTER 1 Introducing MYOB Business 27
all for when it comes to protecting financial data. I like to think of it as an insur￾ance policy for your MYOB file.
Inviting Others to Access MYOB
The brilliance of using MYOB online is the true collaboration that can happen in 
your file. You can be working on invoicing while your bookkeeper is allocating 
bank feeds and your accountant is preparing monthly financials. Gone are the 
days where you sent a backup file to your accountant for review so they could 
lodge your Business Activity Statements months down the track — now they can 
jump into your file any time and pick up the info they need.
To add users or advisors, you need to be either the Owner of the business or 
assigned an Administrator role.
All users and advisors can access your file at the same time and there’s no limit to 
how many people you can add. The important thing is that you set up appropriate 
roles and permissions for each person.
If you’re adding users or advisors who haven’t used cloud software before, let 
them know how you expect them to keep your data secure:
» Request that they don’t share their password.
» Ask that they don’t log into your company file using an unsecured Wi-Fi 
connection.
» Ask that they log out of your file if leaving their device for an extended period.
» If possible, encourage them to use the authenticator app rather than email.
Adding new users and assigning roles
As part of adding new users, you need to assign roles and user types to each user.
Here’s what to do:
1. Select Users from your Settings menu (for more on Settings, refer to the 
earlier section ‘Getting your settings right to save you time’).
A list showing all users in the file is displayed.28 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
2. Click the Create User button.
Enter the user’s name and email. (If you are creating an advisor, such as an 
accountant or bookkeeper, follow the steps in the next section, ‘Inviting your 
advisors’.)
3. Decide on the Access level for this user by selecting the relevant role 
from the options shown in Table 1-1.
A role specifies what things this person is allowed to do. For example, if you 
assign the Sales role to a new user, this person will only be able to access the 
features in the Sales menu, Contacts and the reports under the Sales tab. They 
won’t be able to access other functions, such as financial reports or payroll. In 
contrast, the Administrator role provides this person with access to all features 
and functions, including the ability to add other users.
You can select a combination if needed of the last five roles in Table 1-1. If you 
select Administrator or Accountant/Bookkeeper as the role, you don’t need to 
select any others, as these two roles automatically have access to everything.
4. Select the User Type.
The user type determines which files this person can access. For example, if you 
have more than one company file under a single serial number (as is the case 
for AccountRight Premier subscriptions), the Owner and Online Admin user 
TABLE 1-1	 User Roles and What They Mean
Role What This Role Can Access

Purchases All features in the Purchases menu

types provide access to all these company files (so bookkeepers and accoun￾tants need to be mindful of this when sharing access), whereas the File User 
type provides access to a single company file only. Online Admin user types 
can also apply for bank feeds.
5. Click the Save and Send Invitation button.
Yay — you’re all done! The user will receive an invitation to access your MYOB 
Business file, and once they’ve accepted this invitation, they’ll be prompted to 
set up a password and two-factor authentication (2FA).
If the invitation is lost or not yet accepted, you can resend or cancel invitations 
as needed. Invitations do not expire, but sometimes it may be simpler to just 
resend them, rather than asking the person you’ve invited to search through 
thousands of emails.
If you need to change the business owner or add another (yes, you can have 
more than one owner in the file), you can only action this via MYOB support.
The link that says Manage User Access Via my.MYOB is helpful for accountants 
and bookkeepers to manage access to files for their staff without having to 
send invitations.
Inviting your advisors
Advisors are special kinds of users who can access all areas of your file. In almost 
all situations, you’re best to set up your accountant and bookkeeper as advisors, 
rather than as regular users.
Once you’ve logged on using this role, here’s how to grant access to your advisors:
1. Select Users from your Settings menu (for more on Settings, refer to the 
earlier section ‘Getting your settings right to save you time’).
A list showing all users in the file is displayed.
2. Click the Create Advisor button.
All the options are already pre-selected for you — they will be set to the 
Administrator role (providing access to all functions) and set up as an Advisor 
user type (allowing them to centrally control access for their staff to files as 
required).
Ask your advisor what the best email is for them — sometimes they use a generic 
email, so the invite may be linked to their practice rather than to them personally.
3. Save and send the invitation.
Now you’re all set for some great collaborations!30 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
WHAT TO DO IF YOU FORGET 
YOUR PASSWORD
In the same way as the sun will rise in the morning and set in the evening, sooner or 
later you — or someone else — will forget a password.
Resetting a password is generally easy, thankfully. At the bottom of the login page, look 
for the ‘Forgotten your password?’ option. If you click this, you will be asked for the email 
you use to log in with, and then an email will be sent to your inbox with a password 
reset code. Simply enter the code when prompted and you will be given the opportunity 
to enter a new password. Then you will be ready to log in as usual.
If you enter an incorrect password too many times, your account may become locked. 
In this instance, MYOB will send you an email notification to clarify how you go about 
unlocking your account.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 31
Chapter 2
Accounts, Customers 
and Suppliers
Getting to know your Chart of Accounts is half the battle in getting a good 
set of accounts for your business activity statement (BAS) reporting and 
end-of-year tax work — after all, isn’t the goal of buying this book to help 
you do a damn good job on your accounts?
This chapter is all about the lists in your file. First, I talk about your Chart of 
Accounts — the list of assets, liabilities, income and expense accounts that reflects 
the inner workings of your business, allowing you to produce insightful reports 
when you need them. Then I talk about your customer and supplier lists, explain￾ing how to set up new customer and supplier contacts for the best results.
Creating your Chart of Accounts
A Chart of Accounts is a list of all the financial accounts within the general ledger of 
a business that you allocate all your business transactions against. When you first 
sign up to MYOB, you’re provided with a default Chart of Accounts that matches 
your industry type. However, these default accounts can always do with a little 
more customising to get them just right.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Understanding your MYOB accounts
» Keeping your Chart of Accounts trim, 
taut and terrific
» Adding your customers — yay!
» Setting up suppliers
» Managing your contacts32 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
The first thing I do when setting up MYOB for a new client is chat to them about 
their business and how/what they trade. This helps identify if there are more or 
different types of accounts they need in their Chart of Accounts. This is important 
because your accounts affect everything else that happens in MYOB, including 
how you record income and expenses, and the format of your reports (such as the 
Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet). Don’t panic — I cover all these reports in 
Chapter 15.
Less is more, so don’t create accounts for the sake of it — just think of the purpose 
of each account for your business. For example, if you manage a coffee shop, you 
may need a car to go shopping for the business, but the car is not a main focus or 
expense for the business — so creating just one account code for Motor Vehicle 
(MV) Expenses would be fine. However, if you are a courier, the expenses on your 
vehicle are central to your business so you may want to track them via separate 
account codes, such as MV Fuel, MV Rego and Insurance, and MV Repairs and 
Maintenance.
Create your chart with reporting and decision-making in mind. For example, you 
may want to track if you’re spending a lot more money than usual on expenses 
such as fuel, power bills or wages from one month to the next. By utilising MYOB’s 
reporting, you can compare any single expense for the current month to the pre￾vious month, or the current year to the previous year, and even benchmark your 
business against others in similar industries.
To see this for yourself, go to your Accounting menu on the Dashboard and select 
Chart of Accounts. Unless you or your accountant have added extra accounts, a 
default list of accounts appears, which looks like the one shown in Figure 2-1. 
Although you may be able to make do with this list just as it is, I recommend you 
take the time to tailor the Chart of Accounts so you can achieve more meaningful 
reporting for your business. You can always come back and add, edit or delete 
accounts as your business grows and changes. (I explain how to do all these things 
in this chapter.)
With MYOB Business, you can change your account numbering to whatever sys￾tem you like, which can be very handy. The main reason to do this is if your 
accountant wants your chart to align with the one they use for tax purposes (which 
will help them work with your accounts). If you’ve been in business for more than 
a year or so, dig out the most recent reports from your last tax year and compare 
your accountant’s list of accounts with those in MYOB. If you need to add more 
accounts in MYOB to make the two match, do so. If you’re unsure, ask your 
accountant to import their chart into your MYOB file, as many accountants do this 
as part of onboarding their clients to MYOB.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 33
Looking at account classifications
Whenever you do anything to your Chart of Accounts — be it adding, deleting or 
changing an account — you have to decide which kind of account you’re dealing 
with. I explain each account classification in Table 2-1.
Asset, liability and equity accounts appear on your Balance Sheet report; income, 
cost of sales and expense accounts show up on your Profit and Loss report.
FIGURE 2-1:
A sample Chart of 
Accounts, which 
describes every 
asset, liability, 
income and 
expense in your 
business.
TABLE 2-1	 Account Classifications Used in the Chart of Accounts
Account 
Classification When to Use It
Assets Assets are the good stuff — anything you own, such as money in bank accounts, com￾puters, office equipment, motor vehicles and cash. Asset account numbers start with 
1 in the default chart.
Liabilities Liabilities are what keep you awake at night — that’s everything you owe to other peo￾ple. Liabilities include credit card debts, loans, GST, superannuation payable, other taxes 
owing and outstanding supplier accounts. Liability account numbers start with 2 in 
the default chart.
Equity Equity is a fancy term for the owner’s stake in the business, made up of money invested 
initially, and accumulated profit/loss built up over time. Equity accounts include owner 
drawings, capital contributions, retained earnings and share capital. Equity account 
numbers start with 3 in the default chart.
(continued)34 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Other terms sometimes used to describe Cost of Sales accounts include variable 
expenses, direct costs or cost of goods sold; other terms for Expense accounts include 
fixed expenses, indirect costs or overheads. Different words, same concepts.
Understanding account types
If you create a new account that’s either an asset or a liability, you’re prompted to 
select an Account Type. For those anxious to get everything picture perfect, read 
on to find out what type to choose.
When creating an asset account:
» Choose Bank as the Account Type if you’re creating a new bank account (such 
as a transaction account, savings account or term deposit).
» Choose Accounts Receivable as the Account Type if you plan to use this 
account for tracking how much money customers owe you.
» Choose Other Current Asset as the Account Type for anything that isn’t a bank 
account, but is a short-term asset. Examples include Prepaid Insurance, 
Employee Advances or Inventory.
Account 
Classification When to Use It
Income Income is all the money you earn and includes everything you invoice or sell to your cus￾tomers. Income account numbers start with 4 in the default chart.
Cost of Sales Cost of Sales is the direct cost of selling goods or providing your service. This account 
classification includes purchases, raw materials, freight, commissions, production labour 
and subcontract labour. Cost of Sales account numbers start with 5 in the default 
chart.
Expenses Expenses are the day-to-day running costs of your business and include advertising, 
bank charges, rent, telecommunications and wages. Expense account numbers start 
with 6 in the default chart.
Other Income Other Income is probably better described as non-trading income. It includes income 
that’s not really part of your everyday business, such as interest income, one-off capital 
gains or gifts from mysterious benefactors (if only). Other Income account numbers 
start with 8 in the default chart.
Other Expenses Again, think of Other Expenses as abnormal expenses that aren’t part of your everyday 
business, such as lawsuit expenses, capital losses or entertaining aliens from outer 
space. Other Expense account numbers start with 9 in the default chart.
TABLE 2-1 (continued)CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 35
» Choose Fixed Asset as the Account Type for anything expensive and material 
that you can touch, feel and see. Sounds kind of sensual but I’m talking about 
relatively mundane things such as Plant & Equipment, Land & Buildings and 
Fixtures & Fittings.
» Choose Other Asset as the Account Type for those odd things that accoun￾tants like to describe as ‘intangibles’. Examples include Goodwill and 
Formation Expenses.
COST OF SALES OR AN EXPENSE?
This is a very common question when starting a new Chart of Accounts. Cost of Sales 
and Expense accounts are both account types within your Chart of Accounts and both 
represent money going out of the business, which is why many people get them mixed 
up — but they have different roles to play within your Profit and Loss reporting. Your 
Cost of Sales accounts represent the direct costs related to producing the goods or ser￾vices that you sell to your customers. Think of it as any costs that you need to outlay to 
earn your income.
The main reason you want to get this allocation right is that it helps you work out your 
true gross profit on your Profit and Loss report. The idea is that when sales go up, the 
cost of those sales goes up, and when sales go down, the cost of those sales should go 
down. Your gross profit helps you work out if you’re pricing your goods or services at 
the right price to make a good profit.
Think about your business and figure out which expenses are truly Cost of Sales 
accounts. For example, if you’re a manufacturer, your Cost of Sales accounts probably 
include things like raw materials, production labour and freight. If you’re a tradesper￾son, your Cost of Sales accounts will include materials and subcontract labour. If you’re 
a retailer, your Cost of Sales accounts are the goods that you buy to sell again, and usu￾ally include stock purchases and freight expense. On the other hand, if you’re a consult￾ant, you probably don’t have any Cost of Sales accounts because you’re not actually 
producing or selling anything except your time.
Expense accounts include things like accounting fees, bank fees, computer gear, depre￾ciation, electricity, interest, motor vehicle expenses, rent, stationery and telephone. 
These business expenses don’t change much from month to month, regardless of 
whether your sales go up or down. Think of them as the expenses you incur to run your 
business.36 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
When creating a liability account:
» Choose Credit Card as the Account Type not only for your credit cards, but 
also for any bank accounts that are always in the red, such as bank overdrafts 
or line of equity accounts.
» Choose Accounts Payable as the Account Type if you plan to use this account 
to track how much money you owe suppliers.
» Choose Other Current Liability as the Account Type for any money you owe 
that’s relatively short term. Examples include Customer Deposits, PAYG 
Payable, GST accounts and Superannuation Payable.
» Choose Long Term Liability as the Account Type for hire purchase accounts, 
bank loan accounts and long-term loans from directors.
» The last Account Type is described as Other Liability. I’m yet to really use 
this as I feel the others cover it all, but I guess it just keeps the assets and 
liabilities even in options! The official position from MYOB is any other 
money you owe . . .
Adding your first new account
So, you’re ready to create a new account? Here’s how:
1. Go to the Accounting menu and click Chart of Accounts.
2. Decide the type of account you’re creating, and then click the appropri￾ate tab.
Here is where you decide whether the account you want to create is an asset 
or a liability account, an income or an expense account, or an equity or a cost 
of sales one! When you’ve made up your mind, click the correct tab.
(Refer to Table 2-1 if you’re not sure.)
3. Decide how to number your new account.
Decide where you’d like this new account to appear in the list you see and pick 
a number so that this account falls in the right spot. MYOB sorts accounts in 
numeric order, but it is a good idea to try and align your list alphabetically as 
well if you can because it makes it much easier to search through your list for a 
particular account name. For example, if your Advertising expense account is 
numbered 6-1000 and your Cleaning expense account is numbered 6-3000, 
and you want to insert a new Bank Fees expense account between these two, 
then choose a number between 6-1000 and 6-3000 — say, 6-2000.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 37
You could use any number between 6-1001 to 6-2999, but give yourself space 
in the numbering so that if you come back later and need to add another 
account between these, it will make it a little easier to keep the names 
alphabetical as your Chart of Accounts grows.
Now, jot down this number on a scrap of paper — you can choose a specific 
number, otherwise MYOB will use the next available number available after 
you select the header type. Note also if your new account needs to sit under a 
header (also called a parent header) account. Header accounts group accounts 
together that are alike so that in your Profit and Loss report you can see a 
subtotal of all the accounts grouped underneath. See ‘Grouping under the 
parent header’ later in this chapter for more details.
4. Click Create Account (the green button to the top right).
5. Choose whether the new account is a Header Account or a Detail 
Account.
If this new account is to be a heading that appears in bold and groups together 
the accounts listed beneath it, select Header Account. If you want to create an 
account that you can add transactions to, select Detail Account.
For more about header and detail accounts, see ‘Grouping under the parent 
header’, later in this chapter.
6. Pick an Account Type.
Select the account type that best suits the account you are creating. In 
particular, make sure you select Bank as the Account Type for transaction, 
savings or investment accounts, and Credit Card as the Account Type for credit 
cards or overdrafts.
Note: If this new account is an asset or liability, you have more options 
available to pick the most appropriate Account Type, such as Bank, Fixed Asset, 
Credit Card or Accounts Payable. If you’re not sure which Account Type to 
select for assets and liabilities, refer to the preceding section.
7. Select a parent header.
Choose the parent header account you want your new account to sit under — 
the one you jotted down in Step 3 now comes in handy. The options presented 
here are those that sit under the Account Type you have just selected.
8. Type in the Account Number and Account Name.
Now you can type in the account number you also decided on at Step 3. Then, 
type in the name of your new account. Your new account should now look 
similar to Figure 2-2. (You can ignore the opening balance here at the moment 
and leave it at $0.00; Chapter 3 talks in more detail about setting your opening 
balances.)38 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
9. Choose a Tax Code for the new account.
Most income and expense accounts should have GST as the Tax Code (unless 
you sell particular GST-free supplies, such as those in the education or medical 
industries), although some expenses, such as bank charges and donations, 
should have FRE as the Tax Code. Asset, liability and equity accounts almost 
always have N-T (not reportable) as the Tax Code, although fixed assets usually 
have GST as the Tax Code. I talk more on GST lingo in Chapter 16.
10. Optional: Add any useful information about the account in the Notes 
section, if you wish (you have a 250-character limit here).
You can add a note here if helpful, such as to clarify what the account is for if 
the Account Name is unclear.
11. Click Save and you’re done.
Fantastic! You just created your first new account.
Thinking about that pot of gold
As part of tidying up your Chart of Accounts, it’s a good idea to tweak your list of 
income accounts. If you have fewer than three income accounts, have a think 
about how you could describe your income in more detail. Each major source of 
income benefits from a separate income account for better reporting purposes.
Maybe you’re a builder who earns money from new houses, as well as renovations 
and extensions. Maybe you earn money from a combination of bookkeeping and con￾sulting. No matter how you earn a crust, try to split your income into different cat￾egories. That way, you can generate regular Profit and Loss reports that reflect how 
your business generates revenue and where your opportunities for growth may be.
FIGURE 2-2:
Creating a new 
account.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 39
Alternatively, maybe your business doesn’t just have different sources of income 
but is actually a couple of businesses bundled under the one ABN — like the news￾agent that doubles as a post office, or a chain of hairdressing salons at several 
different locations. In other words, you not only have different sources of income, 
but you also have specific costs that relate to each of these sources. If so, one 
option would be to create separate expense accounts for each source of income/
expenses, but soon your Chart of Accounts would look rather large. Instead, you 
can consider using a single set of income/expense accounts but also setting up the 
Jobs feature to track your accounts at a deeper level of reporting. For details on 
using Jobs, see Chapter 17.
UNDERSTANDING LINKED ACCOUNTS
Have you heard of Newton’s third law? It says that ‘for every action there is an equal and 
opposite reaction’. Well, many think accounting works in this way too because for every 
debit there must be an equal credit. Luckily, MYOB helps you through this exact notion 
of double-entry accounting and does the hard work for you using linked accounts.
These can be found under the Accounting menu by clicking Manage Linked Accounts. 
You will see four tabs that relate to the core business areas (Accounts & Banking, Sales, 
Purchases and Payroll) where you process your transactions. Jump in your file and take 
a look to try and unravel the concept here, keeping debits and credits in mind.
MYOB selects the defaults that suit most business types, but sometimes you may want 
to direct certain transactions to a different linked account; however, this should be done 
with caution. Such changes requires a very good understanding of how they will impact 
the back end of your transactions — impacts that may not be visible to you. These 
account changes can also affect your reconciliations and reports across the four core 
business areas.
A deeper level of linked accounts can also be found within the Tax Codes and Payroll 
sections. For Tax Codes, head to the Accounting menu and select Tax Codes. As an 
example, click GST in the Tax Code column and the Tax Code details appear, where you 
will see the next layer of linked accounts (here, you see a Linked Account for Tax 
Collected and a Linked Account for Tax Paid that you can edit should you wish (again, 
with caution).
The same goes with Pay Items under the Payroll menu, where you can edit the linked 
expense account for most items. For example, you could link Commissions to an 
account called Commission Expense, separating this from the default Wages & Salaries 
expense account.40 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Speak to your accountant to confirm they’re happy to track your accounts in this 
way via Jobs. Most are, but some have special features in their accounting soft￾ware that track departments differently for financial reporting and so they may 
need your Chart of Accounts to be set up a little differently. Get their advice first 
so you can set your file up right from the start.
Deleting unwanted accounts
If you have accounts in your Chart of Accounts that you know you’ll never use, 
waste no time in getting rid of them — Sayonara!
There are some exceptions (aren’t there always in life?) when it comes to deleting 
particular accounts, and MYOB will tell you if and why an account can’t be 
deleted — for example, if the account is used as a linked account or if you’ve ever 
used the account in a transaction. In these situations, your only option is to mark 
the account as Inactive. The account remains in the file but it has what you 
can think of as a cloak of invisibility over it — so it won’t show up unless you 
want it to.
Treat linked accounts with caution if you’re editing or deleting, as changes you 
make here can impact the way transactions are recorded and cause grief if you get 
it wrong. After you make a change, be sure to check its effect on your reporting. 
Do invest in getting advice here if you’re unsure — linked accounts can be a little 
tricky!
Here’s how to delete an unused account:
1. Go to your Chart of Accounts and click the account name.
2. Click the Delete button at the bottom left of the screen.
Poof! It’s gone.
To bulk delete unused accounts:
1. Go to your Chart of Accounts and locate the accounts you wish to delete.
2. Select the accounts to bulk delete.
Simply tick on the small square to the left of the account number. As soon 
as you tick a few, the option to Delete Accounts appears above the list of 
accounts.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 41
3. Click Delete Accounts.
MYOB will now delete all marked accounts in one go. However, any accounts 
that cannot be deleted will remain, as noted earlier in this section, such as 
linked accounts or accounts that have already been used for a transaction. You 
will need to make these accounts inactive instead.
To make an account inactive:
1. Go to your Chart of Accounts and click the Account Name.
2. Check the Inactive Account box at the bottom of the Account 
Classification section.
3. Click the green Save button.
This account will no longer show on your Chart of Accounts unless you select 
the option to Show Inactive accounts to the right of the Search field. Also, when 
allocating an account code to a transaction, the account will not appear in the 
list for you to select from.
If you ever want to re-activate an account, then check the Show Inactive 
checkbox to the right of the Search field on your Chart of Accounts so that the 
account appears in the list, then select it by clicking the account name and 
simply remove the check from the Inactive Account checkbox. Hurrah — just 
like that, the invisibility cloak is off!
Accounts with audit history cannot be deleted so will instead need to be made 
inactive.
Polishing Your Chart of Accounts
After you’ve done the initial Chart of Accounts clean-up — deleting unwanted 
accounts and creating new ones as you see fit — it’s time to submit your Chart of 
Accounts to a bit of a workout to get it in tiptop shape. Read on to find out more.
Putting things in order
To make it easy as pie to find accounts in your list, I encourage you to make sure 
your income and expense accounts are in alphabetical order (within each sub￾heading, that is), because the format of the Chart of Accounts flows directly 
through to your financial reports.42 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
However, MYOB sorts accounts in numeric order, not alphabetical order. This 
means that if you’re not careful with numbering when you’re creating new 
accounts, your Chart of Accounts can soon get out of alphabetical order. To reor￾ganise your accounts, you may simply need to change some of your account num￾bers to make space.
Now it’s your turn:
1. Go to your Accounting menu, click Chart of Accounts, and then click on 
the account that’s out of order.
2. Edit the account’s number.
3. Click Save.
If you have a few accounts that need changing, you can do it in bulk:
1. Go to your Accounting menu and click on Chart of Accounts.
2. Select Edit Accounts from the buttons near the top of the page.
3. Now all cells in your Chart of Accounts are editable — you just need to 
click in the account number cell you want to change and edit the 
account’s number.
Note: Other cells are also editable from this view, such as Account Name, 
Account Type and Tax Code.
4. Click Save.
Resist the urge to add or edit opening balances here — I talk more about the best 
way to do this in Chapter 3.
Grouping under the parent header
If you have many accounts that belong together, you can further categorise them 
into groups in your Chart of Accounts using header and detail accounts. Common 
examples are where you can create a group for your wage’s accounts, motor vehi￾cle expense accounts or different kinds of marketing expense accounts.
Header accounts (also referred to as parent header accounts when you’re creating 
new accounts in MYOB) are the headings (surprisingly enough) and appear in bold 
in the list. Detail accounts are the accounts that belong under each header. For 
example, if you create a header account and name it Motor Vehicle Expenses, you 
can then add many detail accounts to subcategorise your motor vehicle expenses, 
such as Fuel, Rego, Insurance and Repairs.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 43
When setting up your header accounts, you get the option to tick if you want to 
show the subtotal of all accounts sitting under the header. This can be very useful 
when analysing reports.
You can create groups of accounts within other groups if you’re super-keen and 
this approach is fit for purpose for your business reporting. For example, you 
could create a header account called Payroll Expenses, along with several detail 
accounts, and within this header you could add another header called Wages & 
Salaries, with detail accounts relating to different kinds of wages within that level 
(see Figure 2-3).
Here are some things you can do after you’ve set up header and detail accounts:
» You can choose at any time between displaying a highly detailed report 
(for example, a Profit and Loss report that itemises every expense) and a 
less detailed report that just shows the subtotals of each group. To do this: 
Display your Profit and Loss report and then under the Report Options 
adjust the level filter — 1, 2, 3 or 4. Level 1 shows the least detail; Level 4 
shows the most.
» You can tell when detail accounts belong to header accounts because they’re 
indented and sit in a bunch below the header account. However, sometimes 
things get muddled and detail accounts appear immediately below their 
header account without any indentation. This is easy to fix: In your Chart of 
Accounts, simply click on the Account Name and check that the correct Parent 
Header has been selected in the Account Classification section. It’s like Mum 
and Dad at the top and all the kiddies sitting under them.
If you want to move a bunch of accounts under a new header, you can do this in 
bulk. Locate the accounts you wish to move, then simply tick the square box to the 
left of all the accounts and a Move To . . . box appears at the top left of the page. 
Using the options from the drop-down arrow to the right of the Move To . . . box, 
select the header that you want to move them to — they move all together instead 
of one at a time. Super-handy to use!
FIGURE 2-3:
Creating headers 
to group 
accounts.44 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
When selecting accounts in this way (by ticking the checkboxes on the left), the 
option to Edit Tax Code in bulk also appears, which is a lifesaver should you ever 
go from being unregistered for GST to registered for GST. I talk more about GST in 
Chapter 16.
Merging accounts
Sometimes you may end up with two accounts that are doing the same thing. For 
example, you may have one account called Maintenance and then realise that you 
have another called Repairs & Maintenance. If both accounts have transactions in 
them, you can’t correct the problem by deleting one of the accounts, and unlike in 
AccountRight, you can’t merge accounts in MYOB Business.
The solution here is to use the nifty Find and Replace feature, a topic that’s 
covered in Chapter 6. This way, you can transfer all transactions from one account 
into the account you want to keep, and then make the account that’s empty 
inactive as shown in the earlier section ‘Deleting unwanted accounts’.
Setting Up New Customers
To view your customers, head to the Contacts menu and select All Contacts. (If 
you’re working on a new company file, you may find you arrive at a completely 
blank list.) You can select Customer as the Contact Type to filter your customers 
out from suppliers or personal contacts.
MYOB used to refer to your customer records as cards (it still does in Account￾Right), a rather quaint term harking back to when people used to store 
handwritten records in little cards on their desk. In MYOB Business, Contacts 
makes more sense in today’s technologically advanced world.
Defining credit terms
Before you set up too many new customers, I recommend you first define your 
default credit terms — namely, the payment terms you offer to most of your cus￾tomers. (Don’t worry if some customers have different terms; you can override 
the defaults for individual customers within your invoicing.)
If you are the business owner, you can decide on the terms you wish to extend to 
your customers (Table 2-2 covers the options available). In my experience, the 
newer the business, the shorter the term (you may even request cash on delivery 
just to get cash flowing in); and the more established the business, the longer the 
terms given.CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 45
Here’s how to set up your default credit terms:
1. Head to your Settings and select Sales Settings from the drop-down 
menu.
2. Click on the Payments tab.
This shows you MYOB’s Default Payment Terms at the top of the page.
3. From the Payment Is drop-down box, choose when you want your 
customers to pay, using Table 2-2 as a guide.
Entering contact details
When creating a new customer, the first step is to enter all contact details (you 
know, name, address and so on). Although you can get away with just whacking 
in a name and nothing else, try to add all the contact details in one go where 
practical.
If you’re in a hurry, you can do this on the fly when you’re creating an invoice 
by clicking Create Customer direct from within the invoice’s Customer field. 
Chapter 4 talks more about creating invoices.
TABLE 2-2	 Default Credit Terms
Payment Method Payment Terms
Cash on delivery (COD) Cash, glorious cash. Payment must be made at the time of delivery.
Prepaid All orders should be prepaid in advance (if you can get it, why not?).
Due in a number of days after 
the issue date
The given number of days is the time between the invoice date and the 
payment due date. Enter the number of days in the next field naming 
the Days after the Issue Date.
Due on a date of this month The due date is calculated by combining this day with the month on the 
invoice. A common option here is Last Day, though you can choose any 
date.
Due on a date of next month Payment is due on a set date for the following month after the invoice 
date.
Due in a number of days after 
the end of the month (EOM)
The due date is a certain number of days following the end of the 
month. Use this option if the due date is always the last day of the fol￾lowing month.46 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
To create a contact:
1. Click on the Contacts menu and select Create Contact from the drop￾down menu that appears.
2. Select Customer as the Contact Type.
3. For the Designation, select Company or Individual.
4. Is this contact a business or a person? Enter the individual’s full name or 
the company name.
Note: It is not a legal requirement to include the customer’s ABN so you can 
skip this field if preferred.
5. Enter a Contact ID — if you use codes to identify customers.
Some businesses may choose to standardise their contacts to an abbreviated 
format to use for billing purposes or to easily identify customers. If you don’t 
use customer IDs, leave this field blank.
6. Complete the Billing Address section.
Choose the country first, then as you start to type the address you can choose 
from a suggested prefill match.
7. Add a Contact Person.
This is handy for when you may need to speak with the customer, so you can 
ask for the right person (especially in bigger businesses). Adding a Contact 
Person here also enables you to populate their name in the salutation when 
you’re sending invoices via email.
8. Add in an email address or two in the To Email box.
Here you can add one or more email addresses (some people are so needy 
aren’t they!). Of course, your invoices may need to go to multiple people. Type 
the first email and press Enter, and then you can type in the next, and so on.
You also have the option to add a CC email in the same way.
9. Now enter the Fax, Phone and Website information for your customer 
(all optional).
Thinking about it, when was the last time anyone sent a fax?! Do they still exist?
10. For the Shipping Address, check the Same as Billing Address box or go 
ahead and enter a different shipping address if needed.
If you select Same as Billing Address, when you generate invoices the Ship To 
box will not appear, which is tidier. If you do fill in the shipping address with 
the same one as the billing address, it will add a Ship To box to your invoice, 
which can look a little odd if they are both showing the same address. CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 47
However, if your customer wants to use a different Shipping Address to their 
Billing Address, then by all means go ahead and add the two different 
addresses as required.
11. If required, you can add Notes in the More Information area.
MYOB has kindly added a space where you can freely add further information 
about your customer, such as spend limits, credit referees or different 
contacts within the company. Don’t let the size of the box fool you — it 
expands the more you add in, which is very nifty indeed (though note 
there’s a 250-character limit).
12. Click Save.
Well done! Now, on to the next one.
If you make a mistake when you create a new customer, or if someone’s details 
change, it’s easy enough to fix. Click on the Contacts menu and select All Contacts, 
locate the contact you want to update in your Contacts list, click into that contact 
and make the changes you require, then simply click Save.
You can also make contacts inactive if they’re no longer a customer — simply tick 
the Inactive Contact box in the Details section.
If you have a contact that is both a customer and a supplier, you need to set up two 
separate contact records for them.
CAN MYOB BE YOUR CUSTOMER 
DATABASE?
Generally yes, if you just want to keep contact details. While the Notes section is great 
for added information, the 250-character limit here may not be enough at times. 
Sometimes a business may need to maintain loads of very specific information about 
its customers. The business may be a club that wants to keep a record of golf scores 
for each member, a vet who wants to record every animal’s vaccination history or a 
cosmetologist who wants to update a client’s treatment records. In these situations, 
you’re definitely best to maintain an independent Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM) system in addition to your contacts in MYOB.
When choosing a CRM system, take note of whether it integrates with MYOB Business, 
as this could save you double-entering data.48 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Importing contacts from other software
You may already have a customer or supplier listing set up on your computer 
before you start using MYOB; if so, you probably don’t want to be entering all 
these details manually into MYOB. In this instance, look into importing your con￾tacts into your MYOB file.
This chapter doesn’t have enough space to cover importing contacts in detail, but 
if you go to the Help section when you are on the Import and Export Data page 
(which you can find under your Settings by clicking the question mark), it offers 
you a link to support on importing your contacts (click Importing Contacts and 
you’ll find a handy article that explains just what to do, including a sample 
template).
One word of warning, however. If you make a mistake mapping your data, some￾thing that might take only five minutes to import can take many hours to fix. For 
this reason, start by importing data for only a dozen or so contacts. Once you’ve 
done the import and checked these contacts are correct, you can proceed to 
importing the rest.
Adding New Suppliers
Before starting on your supplier contacts, jump to your Purchases Settings (under 
the Settings menu) — you can set all your supplier preferences here (I introduce 
these briefly in Chapter  1). Go through the three tabs (Layout, Templates and 
Email Defaults) and be sure to add your email under the Email Default tab — that 
way, if a supplier does reply to an email, it goes straight to where it needs to go.
To add a new supplier, you follow pretty much the same process as adding a cus￾tomer (refer to the earlier section ‘Entering contact details’). Click on the Contacts 
menu, select All Contacts from the drop-down menu that appears, and then click 
on Create Contact in the top-right corner. Choose Supplier as the Contact Type 
this time. If you’re in a hurry, you can get away with just adding the supplier’s 
name and nothing more; however, at some point you must come back and enter 
their ABN as a minimum.
While the Create Contact process is much the same for a supplier as a customer, 
you do need to keep a couple of extras points in mind as you go Here’s are the 
extra areas to note when adding a supplier:CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 49
» Report Payments to ATO via TPAR (Taxable Payments Annual Reporting).
If you tick this on all payments allocated to the supplier, payments will be 
pushed through to TPAR reporting for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), 
due every August. These payments need to be reported for subcontractors 
that offer a service within a reportable industry such as building and construc￾tion, cleaning, courier services and some IT services. The ATO is your best 
reference point to know if your business should be reporting TPAR.
» Add in the supplier ABN. Here, you find the genius of MYOB. As soon as you 
enter the ABN, you will see a cross-check in place — a green tick will appear if 
the ABN is valid, a red will appear if it’s not, and a yellow tick will appear if the 
ABN has been cancelled.
Now while this in itself is awesome, after you’ve entered the ABN, the real 
magic comes if you click on the ABN’s status — it actually brings up a sum￾mary from the ABN lookup site and confirms the name associated with this 
ABN and its GST registration as well. This means you can also be sure if a 
supplier’s tax invoice is showing the correct GST details or not and if it is the 
true ABN of the supplier. I can’t tell you how many tradie clients I have had 
that have realised many of their contractors suspiciously had the same ABN 
as Bunnings! This magic button caught them all.
» Open ABN lookup website. This is an extension of the preceding point but it 
takes you to the actual ABN lookup site, with the ABN prefilled for further 
information should you need it.
» Expense account. You can add in an account code if purchases from this 
supplier will always fall in the same expense category. For example, if 
Officeworks is one of your suppliers, you can add the code for Printing & 
Stationery here (which should begin with a 6). Sure, sometimes you might buy 
office furniture rather than stationery, but in that instance within the transac￾tion you can easily change the coding to a capital expense code if needed. 
Usually, it’s a great way to save time if you can pre-empt where a supplier will 
sit in your records.
» Bank details. If you want to pay your suppliers by uploading batch payments 
to your internet banking, you need to add your supplier’s bank details in the 
More Information section. I chat more about electronic payments in 
Chapter 14.
It is imperative you double-check and triple-check the bank details you enter 
here. Banks can’t recoup money that may have been paid to an incorrect 
account, so you could risk losing your hard-earned money — so check, check, 
check! I say this from personal experience, happily it was only $300 I lost but it 
was a lesson very well learned when I first started out as a bookkeeper. I had 50 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
the details correct but I’d checked an old invoice against it and the business 
had been sold in the meantime, so I ended up paying the old owner (who was 
not legally obliged to give it back, and the bank could do nothing about it). You 
must take care with electronic payments.
Looking After Your Contacts
Hands up — who loves housekeeping? Said no-one ever. But how good does it feel 
when you sit and look around at a job well done? Your MYOB company file is no 
different. After a few months pass, you’ll find that a bit of housekeeping is already 
required to keep your lists in tip-top condition.
Here I explain how to locate customer or supplier details and how to delete 
unwanted contacts.
Managing contact details
After you add a few customers and suppliers, go to your All Contacts view (under 
the Contacts menu) and check out your work. Make life easier by trying out the 
following tips:
» Alter your view settings. For example, you can sort each column simply by 
clicking the column label at the top. So, if you click the Name column, contacts 
are sorted alphabetically. Click the Name label a second time to view the list 
alphabetically in reverse — Z-A. Or you can click the Balance Due column so 
that customers who owe you the most appear at the top of your list.
» Look to see if key data is missing. Immediately you can see if you are 
missing any customer or supplier basic details as they’re left blank — this way 
you can be sure to go back and complete them, especially for suppliers if 
you’re reporting TPAR.
» Power to search. Can you see the Search field near the top-left? This is very 
handy as your contacts list grows in number so you can find exactly what you 
need.
Deleting customers or suppliers
Having customers or suppliers in your list that you don’t use is like littering your 
lounge room with old socks. Time to get rid of the mess:CHAPTER 2 Accounts, Customers and Suppliers 51
1. Go to the All Contacts view (under the Contacts menu) and click on the 
unwanted customer or supplier name.
2. Scroll all the way to the very bottom and click Delete on the bottom left.
Done. Alternatively, if you get a message saying that the contact can’t be 
deleted because a job history or journal entries are attached, then your only 
option is to tick Inactive Contact under the details section. Out comes that 
invisibility cloak to hide this away until you need it to come back (if ever).
Finding transactions using accounts, 
customers or suppliers
Want to find transactions for an account, customer or supplier? I talk about find￾ing transactions in lots of spots throughout this book:
» Chapter 4 provides details about locating customer invoices.
» Chapter 5 explains how to look up bank account transactions.
» Chapter 6 explores a cool new way to find and replace information in 
transactions.
» Chapter 7 talks about locating customer payments.
» Chapter 8 explores how to find supplier bills or payments.
» Chapter 10 explains how to look up transactions relating to specific items of 
inventory.
Don’t get muddled between looking up transactions for a particular customer or 
supplier and looking up contact details. To view contact details — maybe to look up 
a phone number or check a contact name — go to your Contacts menu, select All 
Contacts from the drop-down menu and search for who you want, then simply 
click in to get the details you need.CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 53
Chapter 3
Setting Up Opening 
Balances
I
n this chapter, I explain how to record opening balances for customers, suppli￾ers and inventory, as well as how to set up opening balances for all asset, liabil￾ity and equity accounts. Although some of these activities can be a little daunting 
if you don’t have bookkeeping experience, this chapter walks you through each 
stage, step by step.
You only need to read this chapter if your business was already up and running 
before you started using MYOB. If your accountant has completed your prior year 
tax return and generated a Balance Sheet as part of doing your accounts, it will be 
a good idea to have this Balance Sheet at hand to refer to as you progress through 
this chapter. If your business is new and you’re using MYOB right from the word 
‘go’, you don’t have any opening balances to carry forward. You can happily ignore 
this entire chapter.
IN THIS CHAPTER

customers
» Doing the same thing for your 
suppliers
» Sorting out other account opening 
balances
» Making sure inventory opening 
balances are on track54 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
Customer Opening Balances and 
Historical Invoices (Sales)
In the first part of this chapter, the aim of the game is to tell MYOB about all the 
customers who owed you money at the point you started using MYOB, which for 
most businesses, will be the first day of the current financial year. By entering 
these transactions (which MYOB refers to as historical invoices), you stay on top of 
who owes you money, and just how much, right from the start.
Recording how much customers owe you
Start by making a list of all customers who owed you money as at your opening 
balance date (the date from which you’re recording transactions in MYOB). Make 
sure this list includes invoice numbers, invoice dates, total amounts and total GST 
for each invoice. I find that a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Excel works 
well for this task, and I always add a row at the bottom to calculate the total 
amount of all invoices owing. This total is handy for cross-checking your work 
once you’ve finished entering each of these invoices into MYOB.
You can check your opening balance date by going to your Settings menu, select￾ing Business Settings, and scrolling to the bottom. For example, if the opening 
balance date shows as July 2024, then you want to make a list of all invoices that 
were still owing to you on 01/07/24 that have a date of 30/06/24 or earlier.
To add historical invoices (sales) to MYOB:
1. Go to Sales → Create Invoice and select the name of the customer from 
the Customer drop-down menu at the top left.
If this customer doesn’t already exist in your Contacts, click Create Customer to 
add them now.
2. Enter the original Invoice Number in the Invoice Number field.
Override whatever invoice number MYOB offers and manually adjust this 
invoice number to be the number you used when you originally billed this 
customer.
3. Adjust the Issue Date.
The Issue Date of the invoice should be the date of the original invoice. So if the 
invoice was dated 28/10/2023, then enter this as the date.
Assuming the date you enter is prior to your opening balance date, the Convert 
to Historical Invoice pop-up box appears (see Figure 3-1).CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 55
4. Click the green Convert button.
MYOB takes you back to your invoice. The Description is prefilled with the 
words ‘Historical Sale’ and the invoice is allocated to your Accounts Receivable.
By entering historical sales in this way, you don’t make the mistake of record￾ing last year’s sales as income in the current financial year.
5. Enter the total invoice amount in the Amount column, including GST.
If you charged GST on this invoice, make sure the total includes GST.
6. If your invoice total includes GST, change the Tax Code to GST.
Selecting the correct tax code is vital if you report GST on a cash basis, as this 
GST will be reported on your Business Activity Statement (BAS) once the 
customer pays.
Figure 3-2 shows what a historical invoice looks like when it’s ready to record.
7. Double-check the tax amount.
MYOB Business has a weakness in that you can only enter historical invoices as 
either 10 per cent GST, or no GST at all. This doesn’t work if you sell a mix of 
non-taxable and taxable goods. In this scenario, you need to enter two 
invoices, each with the same invoice number. The first invoice is for the taxable 
amount; the second invoice is for the non-taxable amount.
8. Check the invoice Total on the bottom right is correct and click the Save 
button.
If you have a customer who owes you for several separate invoices, you may 
think it would be easier to add one invoice for the whole amount. Agreed, as it 
takes longer to enter this information sale by sale than just entering one lump 
sum. However, this extra detail is super helpful later when you need to match 
FIGURE 3-1:
The Convert to 
Historical Invoice 
pop-up box.56 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
customer payments against specific invoices. Also, if you are still chasing the 
money, the invoices will be itemised on this customer’s statement, aligning 
with their systems and avoiding confusion.
9. Repeat this process for every outstanding invoice.
If by chance you also have historical sales that are credit notes, you can also enter 
these credits following these same steps. The only difference is that in Step 5 you 
will need to enter your total amount as a negative number. When you click Save, a 
pop-up will appear to note that you’re creating a Customer Credit — click Save 
again at this point to complete the process. The credit can then be found by going 
to Sales → Customer Returns. When you are ready to apply this credit, turn to 
Chapter 7 to understand the process of applying these overpayments to a cus￾tomer’s account.
After you’ve recorded every invoice, you’re ready to check that everything bal￾ances. Read on to find out more . . .
Checking your totals
The next step is to check you got your work right:
1. Go to your Sales menu, select Invoices from the drop-down menu, then 
filter the Customers drop-down menu by All Customers.
FIGURE 3-2:
Recording a 
historical invoice 
for a customer 
who owed you 
money prior to 
using MYOB.CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 57
2. Select All for the Status filter and adjust the date range (Date From/Date 
To) to the date range you entered for your historical invoices.
3. Check that the Total Amount owing shown in the top right equals the 
total of money owed to you in the list you made earlier.
Use the list you made of all the invoices you were owed at your opening 
balance date, referred to at the start of the preceding section.
If the two don’t balance, go through each line one by one until you find the 
difference.
4. In an ideal world, check that the Total Amount owing shown in the top 
right equals the total amount of money in your previous year’s accounts.
If you’ve completed last year’s tax return and if your accountant included a 
Balance Sheet as part of your end-of-year accounts, you can check the amount 
on the list you made equals the balance shown against Trade Debtors 
(sometimes called Accounts Receivable) on the Balance Sheet.
If the two don’t balance, make a note to ask your accountant about the 
discrepancy.
Entering your Accounts Receivable total
If you’re confident you have entered your historical invoices correctly, you have 
one last thing to do (and then yes, you can breathe a big sigh of relief and reward 
yourself with a nice box of chocolates for a job well done). You need to enter this 
Total Amount owed to you by customers into the Accounts Receivable (that is, the 
Trade Debtors) opening balance.
To do this:
1. Go to Accounting → Chart of Accounts.
2. Find your Accounts Receivable account (you can find this under your 
Asset accounts) in the Account Name column. Click the account name.
The Edit Account page appears.
3. Enter the total amount that customers owe you in the Opening Balance 
($) field.
This is the total that you cross-checked between the historical invoices in MYOB 
and your list of outstanding invoices (refer to the preceding section for more 
details).
4. Click Save.58 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
The total of historical invoices, inclusive of GST, must match the total you enter 
as your Accounts Receivable (Trade Debtors) opening balance. If you’re happy this 
matches up, then you’re done here. Enjoy the well-earned choccies — my weak￾ness is hazelnut!
Supplier Opening Balances 
and Historical Purchases
Much like historical sales, the idea of entering historical purchases for suppliers is 
that you tell MYOB about all the suppliers to whom you owed money (known as 
Accounts Payable) at the point you started using MYOB. However, before worrying 
about this step, ask yourself whether you need to do anything at all:
» If you always pay suppliers by cash, EFTPOS or credit card, and you don’t buy 
any goods on credit, you don’t need to worry about entering historical 
purchases.
» If you don’t purchase much from suppliers on credit, and you don’t want to 
use MYOB to track how much you owe, you don’t need to worry about 
recording historical purchases here either. Instead, you can simply record bills 
at the point of payment, either by working directly from bank feeds or by 
recording transactions in Spend Money (Chapter 6 can guide you here).
You may need to enter the Accounts Payable (Trade Creditors) opening balance 
if your accountant’s Balance Sheet shows an amount you owe. This is so that when 
you enter the rest of your opening balances, you have no out-of-balance amount 
that pushes through to historical balancing (which I elaborate on in the later sec￾tion ‘Balancing the whole kit and caboodle’).
If you’re not sure whether you want to record supplier bills in MYOB or not, make 
your way to Chapter 8, where I talk about this decision in more detail. It’s great to 
have options here — why do the extra work if you don’t have to?
If you decide that you definitely do want to record historical purchases, return to 
the beginning of this chapter and follow the instructions under the heading ‘Cus￾tomer Opening Balances and Historical Invoices’ except adapt these instructions 
for suppliers. The principles are exactly the same, but bear the following in mind:
» Where I say ‘Customer’, simply substitute the word ‘Supplier’.
» Where I say ‘Sale’, substitute the word ‘Purchase’.CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 59
» Where I refer to ‘Receivables’, look for ‘Payables’.
» Where I refer to ‘Trade Debtors’, look for ‘Trade Creditors’.
Once complete, don’t forget to ensure your historical purchases are correct. Look 
under the Purchases menu and select Bills from the drop-down menu, filtering 
the dates to match the historical purchases you just recorded. View the Total 
Amount towards the top right. Reminder — this total needs to marry up to the 
amount of the Accounts Payable (Trade Creditors) in your Balance Sheet report as 
at 30 June of the prior year from your accountant, assuming this information is 
available.
When you’re satisfied that everything is aligned, jump into your Chart of Accounts 
(under Accounting) to enter the Accounts Payable (Trade Creditors) total into the 
Opening Balance amount, just as you did for Accounts Receivable (Trade Debtors). 
Follow the steps in the earlier ‘Entering your Accounts Receivable total’ section.
Account Opening Balances
If your accountant has already finalised last year’s accounts, you can record 
account opening balances by referring to your Balance Sheet report as at 30 June 
of that year. This report is the perfect reference for entering opening balances and 
means you can skip straight to the section ‘Balancing the whole kit and caboodle’. 
However, if you don’t yet have a complete Balance Sheet report for the previous 
financial year, read on.
Entering all opening account balances is a pretty technical process, and you need 
a really good knowledge of debits and credits and the Assets = Liabilities + Equity 
equation (perhaps I’ve lost you already!). If you’re at all unsure about what to do, 
you’re probably best to ask for assistance from your accountant or bookkeeper. 
This is definitely one of those times to go straight to the professionals because 
getting these initial set-up balances wrong may cause issues a year down the 
track.
Entering a few balances to get started
You don’t need to record all opening balances in order to get going with 
MYOB. Indeed, you can get away with simply entering the bare essentials. To enter 
these figures, click on the Accounting menu, select Chart of Accounts, and click on 
Edit Accounts at the top towards the right. This opens the opening balances col￾umn for all account codes. You can see in Figure 3-3 what this page looks like.60 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
The most important opening balances to enter are as follows:
» Your opening bank account balance: Simply look at the opening balance on 
your bank statement for the day you started using MYOB. (If you’re in any 
doubt about what figure to enter, I talk a little more about opening bank 
balances in Chapter 9.) Enter this amount against the Business Bank Account 
balance at the top of your Opening Balance column. You need this figure to 
reconcile your bank account.
» Any other bank account balances: Ideally, enter the opening balances for all 
other business accounts, such as online savings accounts and credit cards.
» Opening balance of Accounts Receivable (Trade Debtors): Did you have 
any customers who owed you money at the point you started using MYOB? If 
so, enter the total amount owed to you by these customers as historical sales. 
Refer to ‘Recording how much customers owe you’ earlier in this chapter for 
more detail.
» Opening balance of Accounts Payable (Trade Creditors): Whether or not 
you want to enter a balance for Accounts Payable depends on a few factors. 
Refer to ‘Supplier Opening Balances and Historical Purchases’, earlier in this 
chapter, for more detail.
FIGURE 3-3:
Recording 
account opening 
balances.CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 61
You’ll notice that when you only enter a few balances, MYOB shows a Remaining 
Balance in the top-right corner in red (to help it stand out). Don’t worry about this 
amount for now — once you have entered the full Balance Sheet, it should go back 
to zero. It’s a useful extra check to see if everything is allocated and balanced (see 
the next section for more on this).
Balancing the whole kit and caboodle
If you want to have a stab at entering all the opening balances, feel free. In order 
to do so, ask your accountant for a copy of your Balance Sheet for the date from 
which you started using MYOB. Then, with this document in hand, you’re ready 
to begin.
1. Return to your Chart of Accounts (from the Accounting menu) and select 
Edit Accounts.
Your opening balances appear.
2. Working from your Balance Sheet report, enter your opening balances 
one by one (if you have already entered some of these, you don’t need to 
enter them again).
Be careful not to re-enter balances that you have already entered at some time 
in the past or you will find it difficult to achieve a zero balance.
For those of you that don’t miss a trick, you may note that a Balance Sheet only 
lists asset, liability and equity accounts, but the Opening Balances column has 
editable opening balance boxes for income and expense accounts too. Don’t 
worry. You can safely ignore opening balances for income and expense 
accounts.
Enter all your opening balances as positive numbers rather than using negative 
numbers for liability accounts. Only enter negative amounts if the account has 
true negative balance. Generally, this only happens for asset accounts that 
record accumulated depreciation or some GST liability accounts, so keep an 
eye out for those exceptions.
3. When you’ve entered all the amounts from your Balance Sheet, check 
that the Remaining Balance is back to zero.
If the remaining balance is not $0.00, go back and check your balances 
once more.
One of the satisfying things about accounting work is that everything should 
balance. However, if you have no luck on this front, read on.62 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
If the Remaining Balance doesn’t return to zero (trust me, you are not alone), here 
are some ideas to fix the problem:
» Have you entered all minus figures correctly? Anything appearing in 
brackets on your Balance Sheet, such as accumulated depreciation accounts, 
should be entered as minus amounts in your opening balances — but these 
are the only minus figures you should see.
» Have you entered an incorrect amount somewhere? Spot this at a glance 
by going to the Reporting menu, selecting Reports from the drop-down menu, 
clicking into the Balance Sheet report and selecting your start date as the 
Date. Compare this report with your accountant’s Balance Sheet and then try 
to spot the difference.
» Is your Amount Left to be Allocated a multiple of nine? If so, you have 
probably reversed a couple of figures — for example, typing $63 instead of 
$36. This is a brilliant trick to have up your sleeve, and it works a treat! It’s 
good to remember for reconciling as well.
If you can’t get your opening balances to balance, don’t worry. Make yourself a 
cuppa and come back for one more look a little later with fresh eyes. If you’re still 
having no luck, get someone to call out the numbers while you check or lastly, get 
your accountant to have a look at your company file and spot what has gone 
awry — after all, they know debits and credits like the back of their hand.
THE MYSTERY OF HISTORICAL BALANCING
Whenever you create a new company file, MYOB automatically creates an equity 
account called Historical Balancing. This account acts like a holding account for setting 
up new balances or storing out-of-balance amounts.
When you enter just a few opening balances to get started, MYOB dumps the out-of￾balance total of these entries into your Historical Balancing account.
If you have an amount in this account, this indicates that your opening balances are 
incomplete, or that you’ve made a mistake when recording your opening balances. 
Don’t worry too much for now — your accountant can easily fix this problem by 
checking the opening balances you’ve entered and repairing the issue.
However, if you’ve been running MYOB for more than a year and you still have an 
amount in your Historical Balancing account, I suggest you provide a gentle reminder 
to your accountant that this needs some attention.CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 63
The good news is you can continue using MYOB while you’re figuring this out as 
the difference will be allocated to a special equity account called Historical Bal￾ancing, which puts it in safekeeping until you solve the puzzle (see the nearby 
sidebar ‘The mystery of Historical Balancing’).
As your account opening balances are directly related to the opening balance date 
specified in your Business Settings, don’t change your opening balances without 
discussing the possible implications with your accountant first. This can get 
messy to track back so tread carefully here.
Opening Inventory Balances
You only need to worry about adding opening inventory quantities and costs if you 
plan to use the inventory features in MYOB Business. Chapter 10 talks all about 
this decision. Chapter 10 also explains how to set up numbers and descriptions for 
inventory items, and you’ll need to have this information in place before you can 
record your opening inventory.
Entering the opening balances of your stock helps start you off right by having the 
value and quantities of these items within your MYOB file so your future balances 
are correct when you start to buy and sell.
MYOB Business allows you to create as many items to buy and sell as you want, 
but unless you subscribe to pay an additional monthly fee for unlimited inventory 
(also referred to as Premium inventory) the number of items that you can inven￾tory is limited to ten. If you go over the ten items, you will receive a pop-up asking 
if you would like to upgrade (you must be the subscription holder to upgrade 
Inventory). Alternatively, you can head to your business name, select My Account 
from the drop-down menu and click on Manage My Product in the Products sec￾tion to upgrade from there.
In order to enter your opening inventory balances, you need to know the opening 
counts and costs for each item. You will also need to create an asset account 
in your Chart of Accounts called Inventory (with the Account Type of Other 
Current Asset) to allocate these balances to. With this information in hand, get 
ready . . . get set . . .
1. Go! Head for the Inventory menu and click Create Inventory Adjustment.
The Adjust Inventory page appears. The Inventory Journal number simply 
defaults to the next number (and starts at IJ000001).64 PART 1 Getting Started with MYOB
2. Set the opening balance date to 30 June of the prior year (the date prior 
to your opening balance date).
3. As the Transaction Description, type ‘Inventory Opening Balances’.
4. On the first line, select the first item for which you want to adjust 
quantities in the Item ID column.
If you haven’t set up any items yet, click Create Item to add this item now. 
Chapter 10 explains more about this process.
If you’ve already set up an item but it doesn’t appear in the drop-down list, 
it may be that your settings are incorrect. Go to the Inventory menu, select 
Items, and ensure you clicked the option ‘I Track Stock for This Item’ for 
this item.
5. In the Adjustment column, enter the Quantity Held.
As soon as you enter a number in the Adjustment column, this updates the 
Amount column.
6. Enter the Unit Cost, excluding GST.
You may choose to enter the average cost as the Unit Cost, or, if your accoun￾tant recommends you to do so, the last price paid may also be used here. You 
may need to refer to your previous accounting system or to recent supplier 
bills to retrieve this information.
The Amount field now displays the total value of your stock of this inventory 
item (that is, quantity on hand × unit cost).
Remember that you’re entering costs, not selling prices, and that these cost 
prices should be tax-exclusive (excluding GST).
7. Select Inventory in the Account column.
Your account allocation should go to the Inventory asset account you created 
earlier in this section.
Enter your Inventory Opening Balances in short batches rather than all at 
once, because if you accidentally press the wrong key, you won’t lose all your 
hard work.
After you’ve entered the first few items, your list may look similar to the one 
shown in Figure 3-4.
8. Optional: Enter the purpose of the adjustment in the Memo column.
Here, you can explain the purpose of this adjustment or add further 
information as required.CHAPTER 3 Setting Up Opening Balances 65
9. Click the Save button.
For one final check, consider jumping back into the Items list under the 
Inventory menu, where you’ll see a nice summary of the Inventory Opening 
Balances you’ve entered, which you can double-check before moving on.

Making Sales
F
inding your way through your first invoice in MYOB will give you quite a 
sense of achievement — you’ll get your first sale, understand the process of 
creating and sending invoices, and realise that MYOB provides an easy work￾flow for you to follow.
Throughout this chapter you will often need to go and edit your Sales Settings. For 
a reminder of where your settings live, turn to Chapter 1.
Recording Your First Sale (Yippee!)
Creating your very first sale in MYOB can be a pretty cool experience. Type in your 
customer’s details, describe what you’re selling and click Send to email this 
invoice to your customer. Simple, right?

The process is pretty intuitive; in fact, you could give it a try on your own and you 
would likely do a reasonable job. However, it takes a bit of practice to make sure 
you don’t miss any tricks.
Before you get started with entering invoices, here are a few things to keep in 
mind about invoicing:
» Customers: If you haven’t set up your customer in the Contacts section of 
MYOB yet, no probs — you can create one on the fly. I explain how to do this 
in the later section ‘Using the Services and Items layout’.
» Customer PO numbers: Ask your customer if they have a PO (purchase order) 
number they would like to use. This may help you get paid faster as the 
customer will already have given permission for the spend on their side by 
setting up a PO, so you reduce the likelihood of delayed payments.
» Invoice layout options: You can specify an invoice layout preference in your 
Sales Settings, under the Layout tab. You have two layout options:
• Services and Items: This is the best layout for most things. You can 
use the Services and Items layout for selling both goods (items) and 
services. For more details, see the next section, ‘Setting up services in 
your Items List’.
• Services: The Services layout is best if you want to include lots of descrip￾tive information about the services you provide. It’s also easier to use as 
you only need to enter one total amount rather than a unit price per 
quantity (as with the Services and Items layout).
» Notes to customers: The Notes field is a helpful place to add messages to 
your invoices, such as ‘Thanks for your business’ or more details about your 
payment terms. For more details about adding notes to your customers, see 
the section ‘Using the Services and Items layout’.
I cover each of these areas and more in the following sections, as well as how to 
create your very first invoice.
Setting up services in your Items List
I’m going to leap straight into the thick of things and ask you to think of a service 
you provide to customers, such as a service fee, an hourly fee, a consulting charge, 
delivery fee or callout fee. With this in mind, I suggest you jump in and create this 
service as your first item:CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 71
1. Go up to your Sales menu and select Items.
Your Items List appears.
2. Click Create Item, at the top right of the screen.
The Create Item page appears.
3. Enter the item’s Name and Description in the Details section.
Make the Name meaningful — after all, this is what customers are going to see 
on their invoices. For example, if you’re setting up an item to bill for your 
labour, the item’s Name could be something simple like ‘Service Fee’, and the 
Description could be more detailed, such as ‘Hourly Onsite Service Fee’ (be as 
descriptive as you need to be if it isn’t obvious).
If you tick the Use Item Description on Sales and Purchases checkbox, MYOB 
will display the Description field rather than the Name field. It depends on your 
business which option works best for you. (There’s no option to display both.)
4. Enter the Item ID — this is a mandatory field.
Your Item ID is usually an abbreviated version of the item’s Name — so in the 
example in Step 3, your Item ID may be ‘ServFee’. It can be a combination of 
numbers, letters and symbols. However you name your Item IDs, keep your 
approach logical and consistent. Chapter 10 guides you through the nitty-gritty 
of creating items.
5. Tick the I Sell This Item checkbox in the Selling section of the page.
Don’t tick I Buy This Item or I Track Stock for This Item because at this point 
your focus is on setting up a service (and you don’t need to buy or track stock 
for units of time).
6. Add your Selling Price and select whether it is Tax Inclusive or Tax 
Exclusive.
The Selling Price is your hourly rate for this service. Ask yourself: Is this rate 
inclusive or exclusive of GST? In other words, have you already added GST to 
this selling price (tax inclusive), or will you add GST later when you create your 
invoice (tax exclusive)? If you’re not registered for GST, you can select either 
option, as it won’t make a difference.
7. Add your Unit of Measure.
For services, this is usually Hour (Hr) for hourly fees, but it could also be Each 
for callout fees or standard charges.72 PART 2 Everyday Activities
8. Select the Income Account for Tracking Sales.
Note: In Chapter 2, I talk about designing your Chart of Accounts so that your 
income accounts reflect the different kinds of revenue your business gener￾ates. Now that you’re setting up items for the purpose of billing customers, link 
each item to the most relevant income account.
In Figure 4-1, notice how I link the ‘ServFee’ item to an income account called 
Service Income.
FIGURE 4-1:
Creating items for 
each service you 
provide (or each 
item you sell).CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 73
9. Select the Tax Code.
The tax code here should be the same code as the tax code that’s linked to the 
Income account selected, as the two are related. Generally, if you’re registered 
for GST and the services you provide aren’t GST exempt, then the tax code is 
simply GST.
Want to check your GST registration status? Visit the ABN Lookup page on the 
Australian Business Register website for more details (abr.business.gov.au).
10. Click Save at the bottom right of the page.
Well done, you’ve created your first service item. Now you’re ready to send 
someone an invoice!
Using the Services and Items layout
Ready to create your first invoice? Here you go:
1. From the Sales menu, select Create Invoice.
2. Type the customer’s name and click on their name when it appears.
If the customer already exists in your Contacts, details about the customer 
appear for you to select.
If you haven’t set up this customer yet, you can create a new customer on the 
fly here. When you click the drop-down arrow next to the Customer field, the 
option to Create Customer appears next to a plus symbol. You can add the 
bare minimum of information (such as the customer’s name) and go back later 
to populate the rest of their details, or you can add all their details now.
Refer to Chapter 2 for lots more info on adding customers.
TAKE THE SHORT ROAD HOME
Why go on the back roads when you can take the expressway? You can create an 
invoice directly using the ‘quick add’ button (a plus symbol), which is called Create New. 
You can add many things quickly here, such as a new Quote, Invoice, Bill, Pay Run, 
Employee, Contact and more, without having to navigate the relevant menu first. It’s like 
using the new McDonald’s self-ordering kiosks — the favourite meals appear with one 
click from the home screen for you to choose from, but if you want to swap out the 
mayo for Big Mac secret sauce then you need to jump into the menu to discover all the 
options.74 PART 2 Everyday Activities
3. Check your invoice layout is set as the Services and Items layout.
To check your invoice layout, click the purple cog wheel on the far right of the 
page and ensure Services and Items is selected. This layout isn’t only for selling 
items; you can also sell units of time, service fees, membership fees and so on 
(refer to the preceding section for how to set up services as items).
After you decide which layout works best for your business, you can make this 
your default layout via the Sales Settings.
4. Accept the invoice number.
Most of the time, you’re fine to accept whatever invoice number MYOB 
suggests, but if it’s your first invoice, I recommend you pick a number over 
1,000 (this suggests you’ve been in business for a while, which may build 
confidence in your customers more than starting with invoice number ‘1’). 
Note: The invoice number automatically goes up by one with every new 
invoice.
5. If you have a customer purchase order (PO) number, type the number in 
the Customer PO Number field.
No PO number? You can leave this field blank, or you can simply ask for the 
name of the person buying the goods or services and enter their name as the 
PO number here. Having a reference is handy, especially when dealing with 
bigger businesses, so you have someone you can go back to if needed.
6. Enter the Issue Date and check your Due Date is correct, based on your 
terms.
Hopefully, you’ve already set up your payment terms as a default via the Sales 
Settings page (refer to Chapter 2 for more on this). Due dates are set system￾wide, so if a particular customer needs to be on different terms, you can adjust 
the due date on the invoice when you create it — click the Due Date field and 
other payment options appear, which you can edit as required.
7. If you have online payments enabled, select whether you want to offer 
this payment option on the invoice.
You can offer your customers alternative ways to pay you, such as using Visa, 
Amex and Mastercard. To enable online payments, click Start Getting Paid 
Online and follow the prompts to apply for this payment option (for more 
details about this feature, skip to Chapter 7).
If you’ve already enabled online payments, click Allow Online Payments if 
you’re happy to offer these payment options to this customer.
Sometimes it makes sense not to click this option for high-value invoices, as it 
can save significantly on merchant fees. However, note that you have the 
option to click Apply Surcharge if you want to pass these fees onto the 
customer.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 75
8. Select whether your invoice amounts are Tax Inclusive or Tax Exclusive.
Choose how you want your invoice totals to display — either including or 
excluding GST amounts. In general, if you sell a mix of taxable and non-taxable 
goods, you’re best to display amounts excluding GST.
If you’re still not sure, experiment with creating a couple of invoices, one with 
GST included and one without, and view these invoices as a PDF (the later 
section ‘Previewing your first invoice’ explains how to do this) to see what you 
prefer.
After you select your preference for your first invoice, MYOB will remember 
this for future invoices.
9. Add the Item ID to the first column.
Click the first row under Item ID and type the Item ID. If you want to see a list of 
all your items, click the drop-down arrow to the right side of the Item ID field 
and all items will appear in a list. From here, you can select the item required.
For more on setting up items that you buy and sell, go on a spin to Chapter 10. 
For more on setting up your services as items, refer to the preceding section.
If you can’t see a column with the heading Item ID, you may be using the wrong 
invoice layout — go back to Step 3 to get back on track.
10. Review the Description, Account, Unit and Unit Price information.
These fields prefill based on the data you entered when you created the item. 
However, you can override the standard description or the price if you need to.
11. Enter the quantity of the item you’re selling in the No of Units field.
The default quantity is one unit, but you can edit the quantity for both services 
and items. For example, if you’re billing a customer for two hours at $80 per 
hour and your Unit measure is set as hours for this item, enter 2 in this 
column.
Mates’ rates? Just add the percentage discount you want to pass on in the 
Discount (%) field (depending on how good a mate they are!) and MYOB does 
the hard work for you. Be sure to check the total amount is correct after 
applying the discount, at least on your first few invoices, to be sure your setup 
is shipshape.
12. Check the Amount ($) is correct.
Run a quick calculation of the number of units multiplied by the unit price to 
check this matches the amount shown on your invoice.76 PART 2 Everyday Activities
13. If you’re using jobs, enter the Job number.
If you want to track job income and expenses, enter the job number now. (For 
more about jobs, and to discover how to track the profit from any job, project, 
venture or cost centre, see Chapter 17.)
14. Check the Tax Code.
Skip ahead to ‘Tax doesn’t have to be taxing’ later in this chapter for more info 
on selecting tax codes. Note: The tax code will be prefilled as per your item 
setup; however, you can edit the code here if you need to within this invoice.
Great work, you have now added your first item to your invoice!
15. If you want to add more items to your invoice, move to the second line 
and repeat steps 9 to 14 until you’re done.
If you add an item and then realise you’ve got it wrong, click the three horizon￾tal dots to the right of the line and select Remove. If you want to insert a line 
between two items, click the three horizontal dots and select Insert Line Item.
16. Optional: Add a note in the Notes to Customer section.
To add a one-off note, type in the empty field below the Notes field. To add a 
note you can use again and again — perhaps a pick-up address or more details 
on payment terms — click the drop-down arrow in the Notes field and click 
Create Note. Add a Note Name and Note Text, and click Save. When you return 
to the invoice, click Save as Default if you want this note to appear on every 
invoice.
By this time, your invoice probably looks pretty similar to Figure 4-2 (assuming 
you’re in the business of providing catering services).
17. Check the Subtotal, Tax and Total values are correct.
It can’t hurt to double-check, and it saves bigger issues in the long run. The GST 
is the most likely figure to be wrong, and if so, this almost certainly means 
you’ve selected the wrong tax code.
18. Click View PDF to preview your invoice or click Email Invoice to — you’ll 
never guess — email your invoice.
If this is your first invoice, click View PDF and then Export to preview your 
invoice before you send it to your customer. Alternatively, select Email Invoice 
and enter your own email address in the To field so you can check how the 
invoice and email notification will appear to your customers.
If you find your invoice template needs a little tweaking to get it just right, head 
to your Sales Settings and make adjustments as needed.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 77
When you are happy with how your invoices look, including how they will 
appear in your customers’ inboxes, you are ready to send your invoice! Turn to 
the later section ‘Sending Customer Invoices’ to find out all your options for 
sending invoices using MYOB.
19. Select your preferred save option to save your invoice.
You have three save options here, depending on what you want to do next: 
Save and Create New, Save and Duplicate, or simply Save.
Congratulations, your first invoice is good to go! Happy dance all round.
Providing a service: Invoicing 
with the Services layout
Service invoices give you plenty of room to include a detailed description in the 
body of the invoice about the services you have just provided for your customer.
To select Services as your layout, simply enter the customer’s name and then, 
before you record any other information, click the purple cog wheel on the right 
and select Services as your layout type.
FIGURE 4-2:
A typical invoice 
with an Item 
layout.78 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Services invoices are very similar to Services and Items invoices (to skim through 
the instructions for creating a Services and Items invoice, refer to the preceding 
section), but with three easy-to-spot differences:
» You enter a Description rather than selecting an Item Code. Let your 
creativity run wild. Don’t just type ‘Service of washing machine’ — tell the 
customer what you really did, down to every drop of sweat, drip of oil or 
minuscule part used, so the customer feels they’re getting what they pay for.
» You need to choose the income account every time you record a sale.
Next to the Description column is a column headed Account. Browse through 
your income accounts from the drop-down arrow and take your pick of the 
one that fits best.
If you know the name of the account you want to use, you can start to type 
the name and options will appear based on your Chart of Accounts.
» You only need to enter one value in the Amount ($) field, instead of the 
number of units and the unit price. Enter the total value for the service or 
goods provided.
Invoicing on the Go
If you or any of your employees work away from the office, you may want to raise 
invoices while you’re on the move, when you’re right there with the customer or 
as soon as you finish the job. Depending on your personal preferences, you can 
choose to create an invoice directly from your smartphone, laptop or tablet.
Using the MYOB Invoice app
To bill a customer direct from your smart device, you need to complete the 
following:
» Download the free MYOB Invoice app from the app store for your device 
(available on both IOS and Android). Just search MYOB and it will pop up (at 
the same time, you can download the MYOB Capture app to assist with your 
expenses — I talk more about that magic trick in Chapter 8).
» Log in to the app with your MYOB email and password.
» If you want to invoice a customer for items, ensure these items have 
already been set up in your company file. I talk about setting up items in 
Chapter 10 and the earlier section ‘Setting up services in your Items List’.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 79
With these three requirements complete, you can fire up the MYOB Invoice app on 
your device and follow the prompts to create an invoice. You can see what the 
invoice on the app looks like in Figure 4-3.
You’ll find that the functionality of MYOB Invoice is simple yet it provides all the 
essentials for creating invoices when you’re out and about. Not only can you add 
new invoices and email these invoices to customers, but you can also add new 
customers and review outstanding customer balances — which is great for chas￾ing up customers at the pub on a Friday afternoon! (One of my customers swears 
by this method — he says most people are happy on a Friday afternoon so getting 
money out of them is easier!)
The MYOB Invoice app also allows you to add customers, change invoice layouts 
and generate quotes, as well as email invoices. One of the only things you can’t do 
is delete invoices through the app.
FIGURE 4-3:
MYOB Invoice 
enables you to 
create and send 
invoices directly 
from your 
smartphone.80 PART 2 Everyday Activities
MYOB Invoice syncs automatically to your file, so if you have an admin person 
back at the office they will be able to see your added invoices as soon as you save 
them.
The benefit of the app is heightened if used in tandem with Online Invoice Pay￾ments (OIP) because you can also receive payments while you’re with customers. 
If you’re onsite and you send a customer an invoice, they can open the email and 
click Pay Now to pay via credit card, Apple Pay or Google Pay right there and then, 
which saves you carrying a separate payment device. Chapter 7 covers the setup 
and benefits of using OIP.
Logging into MYOB when 
you’re out and about
Although the MYOB Invoice app is pretty nifty, typing on a small-screened device 
such as a smartphone can be a bit fiddly (and you may need to get your glasses 
on!). You may find that if you have more than one or two invoices to create, you 
prefer to work with a bigger view of MYOB, such as on an iPad or tablet.
On these devices, log in as you would on your computer at app.myob.com and you 
are all set to go. (By the way, ‘out and about’ can also mean away from your desk 
and on the couch with your iPad on a Monday night, applying payments to invoices 
so you can keep up to date on your reminders. You’re no longer stuck as if by a ball 
and chain to a desk! In summer by the pool is a particular favourite of mine . . .)
If you’re an AccountRight user, you have access to the same features and func￾tions by simply accessing your file via app.myob.com on the browser of any device 
(you don’t need to download the AccountRight software if you’re accessing your 
file via the browser). From this view you can invoice directly from your file and 
carry on business as usual. AccountRight users can also download the MYOB 
Invoice app to access invoicing on the go via a smartphone. If you want to create 
invoices via AccountRight in the browser, simply follow the steps in the earlier 
section ‘Using the Services and Items layout’.
Meeting GST Requirements
Although MYOB handles GST perfectly well, it can’t guarantee that you will pro￾duce legit tax invoices every time. It relies on you to complete your part of the deal 
as well, so you can be sure certain fields are entered and captured as required.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 81
Ensuring your invoice is up to scratch
To ensure your tax invoice meets Australian Taxation Office (ATO) requirements, 
you need to be sure the following appears on your invoices:
» Your business name and Australian Business Number (ABN). This is the 
business name you have registered and the ABN you have received for 
your business. If these details don’t display correctly, review and change in 
your Business Settings (under the Settings menu). Here, you have the option 
to add both your Business Name and your Trading Name (you can choose 
which to display on your invoices in the invoice templates). If you’re unsure 
what name to use when, your accountant can help provide clarity for you.
» If you’re registered for GST, the words ‘Tax Invoice’. These words appear 
automatically in the standard MYOB templates. If you’re not registered for 
GST (and have marked ‘No’ to the question ‘Is this business registered for 
GST?’ on the GST Settings tab in your Business Settings), then the standard 
MYOB template will just say ‘Invoice’ at the top rather than ‘Tax Invoice’.
» If you charge GST, either the total amount of GST payable or a comment 
saying that the total price includes GST. If the invoice is for a mix of taxable 
and non-taxable goods, you need to clearly identify each line item that’s 
taxable and show exactly how much GST you’re charging on each item.
» The date the invoice was issued and a brief description of the goods or 
services sold. The date is pre-populated with the current date, but you will 
need to select the items you’re selling or add a description of what you are 
selling as a minimum by the ATO (the invoice should not be left blank with just 
a price).
» With invoices for more than $1,000 (including GST), either the customer’s 
name and address or the customer’s name and ABN. For these high-value 
customers, be sure to include all the details in this list (brief description, date, 
your ABN, and so on), as well as either the customer’s name or their ABN.
Tax doesn’t have to be taxing
For every line on every invoice, you must enter a code in the Tax column. Short of 
closing your eyes, clicking your mouse at random and accepting whatever tax code 
first appears, you’re going to have to get a grip on which code to pick when.
Here are some pointers:
» If you’re registered for GST, and charge GST on your sales, select GST as 
your tax code.82 PART 2 Everyday Activities
» If your business sells GST-free goods such as childcare, medical services or 
exports, choose FRE as your tax code.
» If your business sells a mixture of goods, some attracting GST and some 
GST-free, choose the appropriate code (either GST or FRE) as your tax code.
» If your turnover is less than $75,000 annually, and you have chosen not to 
register for GST, select N-T (for Not Reportable) as your code.
Want the tax code to come up correctly every time? No worries:
» For sales of services, make sure that every income account in your Chart of 
Accounts has the correct tax code associated with that account. Refer to 
Chapter 2 to find out more.
» For sales of items, make sure every item has the correct tax code in the Selling 
section of the Item (which is under the I Sell This Item checkbox).
These tax codes assume you’re using the Simpler BAS (Business Activity State￾ment) reporting method, which is for businesses with a GST turnover of less than 
$10 million. If your turnover is over $10 million, see Chapter 16 for more detail 
about tax codes.
Toggling how you view prices
The introduction of GST has heralded a new era in bookkeeping since its introduc￾tion in 2000. Forget multiplying by two, dividing by five or understanding frac￾tions. Cast algebra to the wind and know that to get by in the world of GST, you 
just need to be a wizard at multiplying by ten and dividing by eleven.
Fortunately, MYOB can divide by eleven sooner than you can say ‘tax’. Whenever 
you record a new sale, you can choose to display prices including or excluding GST 
by clicking the Tax Inclusive or Tax Exclusive option. MYOB retains your prefer￾ence for subsequent invoices.
To the bottom right of the invoice, where you see your totals, be sure to 
double-check the actual Subtotal, Tax and Total amounts on your invoice are cor￾rect, and that your Tax Inclusive or Tax Exclusive selection makes sense. You 
know the correct amount you want to invoice your customer, so you can check 
these totals match what you expect to see.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 83
Digging Yourself Out of a Hole
Admit it! You rarely spend a day at work when something doesn’t go amiss. It 
happens to everyone. So, in the next couple of pages, I explain how to change and 
delete invoices cleanly if the need arises.
I also rave on about one of accounting’s other little mysteries: Credit notes.
Looking things up
The best place to view all your invoices at once is via Sales → Invoices. This dis￾plays a list of all your invoices (which you can filter by Customer, Status and dif￾ferent periods or dates). Assuming you know the invoice number, customer name, 
PO number or even the amount, the quickest and easiest way to find an invoice is 
to enter one of these details into the Search field and the invoice details appear in 
a flash.
Of course, your searches may be limited by the filters you use, so if nothing dis￾plays you may need to widen your search — in particular, widen the date range as 
this is the most common culprit, and then try again. After you find the invoice 
you’re looking for, you can click the invoice number to view the invoice details.
Here are a few more tips for finding stuff quickly and easily:
» Search for all invoices belonging to a particular customer. Can’t recall the 
specific invoice number? Select your customer under the Customer drop￾down at the top left to help.
» Select the Status of your invoice. Filter by All, Open, Closed or Credit. Open 
means unpaid and Closed is paid; these are legacy terms from when MYOB 
first began, and it looks like they’ve stuck. If you’re not sure, leave the filter on 
All to search through everything. Credit shows where you have issued a credit 
invoice (for example, a customer return).
» Don’t forget to change the dates. MYOB always defaults to displaying the 
last three months when opening your file, so if you need to widen your 
search, adjust the time frame in the Date From and Date To fields. 
Alternatively, you can use the common pre-set date range options under the 
Period filter, which may be even easier.
» Try sorting the columns in different ways. Did you know that you can sort 
any of the columns simply by clicking the column’s heading? For example, 
if you want to sort by invoice number, simply click the heading Invoice 
No and you can sort the numbers from smallest to largest or largest to 84 PART 2 Everyday Activities
smallest — click the heading to switch between the two. If you want to sort by 
the amount owed, click the Amount ($) heading.
» Review the Status column: The Status column shows invoices as Open, Paid, 
Overdue or Credit. The Overdue status in particular is helpful, highlighting 
invoices that have moved past the payment terms set on your invoice. A 
Credit status reminds you that you are yet to apply this credit or refund the 
customer (when you do, the Status changes to Paid).
The last column shows the invoice Activity and tracks the different possible stages 
of your invoice, showing if your invoice has been emailed, downloaded or viewed 
by the customer. This column is most useful for alerting you if there’s an issue 
with the delivery of your invoice (for example, if the email address is wrong and 
MYOB hasn’t been able to send your invoice). Keeping an eye on this column 
means you can fix such errors and resend your invoices when needed.
Changing or deleting invoices
So, you’ve just recorded a customer invoice when you realise that you’ve messed 
up. Your first step towards rectifying the situation depends on whether you’ve 
sent the invoice or not . . . before you panic, breathe in for five and out for five!
If you haven’t sent the invoice yet, then take a big sigh of relief. All you have to do 
is find the invoice (go to Sales → Invoices and refer to the preceding section for 
extra tips on finding invoices), click on the Invoice Number to open the invoice, 
then fix your mistake. Click Save when you’re done and send as needed.
Alternatively, if you completely blew it with this invoice, you can always choose to 
delete it. To do this, first find the invoice (go to Sales → Invoices) and click the 
Invoice Number to open the invoice. At the bottom left is a Delete button. Close 
your eyes and . . . whoosh, the invoice is gone forever.
Of course, if you’ve already sent the botched invoice to your customer, you should￾n’t make any changes at all, no matter how bad your mistakes. Instead, remem￾bering that communication with your customer is key, try the following:
» If you overcharged the customer, create a credit note for the difference (see 
the next section, ‘Raising credit notes’).
» If you undercharged the customer, create an additional invoice for the 
difference.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 85
» If you stuffed things up completely, get in touch with the customer. 
Depending on their systems, they may be able to disregard the incorrect 
invoice (at which time you can simply make your changes and resend it). If, 
however, they have already entered it into their system, they may require a 
full credit for the invoice and a new invoice to replace it.
STICKY FINGERS, STICKY SITUATIONS
Unlike some accounting software, deleting invoices is the only way to go in MYOB 
Business if you want to have the flexibility to fix mistakes easily. On the other hand, you 
probably don’t want employees to be able to delete customer invoices after they’ve sent 
them or to delete transactions without thinking about the impact on your bank 
reconciliations.
On the whole, the Delete function is useful as people inevitably do make mistakes, and 
if you can’t delete things, you truly can create a mountain out of a molehill. You may 
need to provide guidance to employees and policies around deleting invoices if you 
have many users in your file. Perhaps adding a few layers of protection, such as needing 
approval from a senior user before you delete a transaction, as well as putting a few 
fraud prevention strategies in place, can also help keep people accountable.
I could write a whole chapter on fraud prevention, but I can quickly summarise some 
useful strategies as follows:
• If possible, don’t allow the bookkeeper to handle cash, do the banking on their own 
or authorise electronic payments. Have an approval system in place so you as the 
business owner are involved in any functions that relate to money.
• Review transaction changes by running the Journal Security Audit report (Reporting 
→ Reports → Business) on a regular basis. This report is very powerful and can be 
filtered to show not only edits or changes, but deletions also. You can also filter this 
report by Users — ideal if you’re worried that a particular employee may not be 
doing the right thing. Look at the filters available by clicking the Report Options but￾ton and selecting the appropriate filter. Tell your employees that you have access to 
such a report — prevention is better than cure.
• All employees should have their own login and not share logins.
• Define user roles carefully so that employees doing general work in MYOB, such as 
entering sales, don’t have access to other parts of the software.
I talk more about password restrictions and security in Chapter 1.86 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you have employees who are responsible for invoicing, and you have some cus￾tomers who pay by cash, then consider setting internal controls so that the person 
receiving cash doesn’t have the authority to access sales functions in MYOB. That 
way, nobody can be tempted to pocket the cash payment and then hop into your 
MYOB company file and simply delete the sale as if it had never existed . . . as they 
say, out of sight, out of mind.
Raising credit notes
In principle, creating a credit note is just the same as creating an invoice; the only 
difference is you simply use negative quantities in the No of Units column (if you’re 
using a Services and Items layout) or negative amounts in the Amount ($) column 
(if you’re using a Services layout).
Here’s how to raise a credit note:
1. Head to the Sales menu, and select Create Invoice from the drop-down 
menu.
Don’t forget your quick add function — to create an invoice at any time, simply 
click the plus symbol towards the top right of the screen and select Invoice 
from the options provided.
2. Enter the customer’s name, and the corresponding Invoice Number.
For good recordkeeping, use the same invoice number but add CR (for credit) 
at the front of the number (so if your original invoice number was 1895, it 
becomes CR1895). This helps later when you’re applying the credit, so you can 
identify exactly which invoice you need to apply the credit against.
If the original invoice also had a PO number, add it here so the customer is 
aware of this link (which may help them with their own record-keeping).
3. Enter the date of this credit in the Issue Date field.
The Issue Date should not be older than the original invoice date and is usually 
the date you create the credit.
4. Add the details of this credit.
If you’re using a Services and Items layout, choose the same Item ID as the 
original invoice and then enter negative figures in the No of Units column. For 
example, if you’re issuing a refund for two units of something, enter –2 as the 
quantity. Double-check the Unit Price and Amount ($) columns, which should 
both display as negative amounts.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 87
If you’re creating a full credit, then the final invoice total and tax totals should 
be identical to the original invoice.
If you’re using a Services layout, simply add negative figures in the Amount ($) 
column, again checking that the Total matches the original invoice if you’re 
issuing a full credit (or that the amount is correct for the portion you’re 
crediting).
For the credit note’s tax code, use the same tax code you used on the original 
invoice.
5. Enter a brief explanation for this credit.
Enter the reason for the credit in either the Description field (if using a Services 
layout) or in the Notes to Customer field (if using a Services and Items layout).
You may find it easier to add the credit details in the Notes to Customer field 
on every occasion, regardless of invoice layout, so you can always find credit 
details in the same place.
Your credit note should look something like the one shown in Figure 4-4.
6. Click Email Invoice or Save, and then click Save again.
Because the total is a negative amount, MYOB alerts you that you’re creating a 
customer credit. Click Save to continue. If you preview this invoice, you’ll see 
that MYOB knows to put the words Adjustment Note at the top, rather than 
Tax Invoice.
FIGURE 4-4:
Creating a 
credit note.88 PART 2 Everyday Activities
7. Apply the credit to the original invoice.
Go back to your Sales menu and select Customer Returns from the drop-down 
menu. Find your credit in the list, highlight it and click Apply to Sale. Apply the 
negative balance of this credit note against the original invoice. (This is where 
the same invoice number comes in handy if you have a big list of invoices.)
Alternatively, to issue a refund for this credit, skip to Chapter 7.
Working with Quotes and Sales Orders
The good news is, if you know how to create a sale, you already know how to cre￾ate a quote or a sales order for your products or services. Sales orders are a little 
different to quotes — they’re a promise to customers that you will supply items at 
some point in the near future (perhaps you can’t supply those items immediately 
because they’re out of stock, or perhaps you need to make those items first). 
A sales order is a supply commitment from the seller and a buy commitment from 
the buyer that helps alleviate the potential loss of a sale if you don’t have the stock 
on hand.
Sales orders are only available with MYOB Business Pro and all AccountRight 
plans.
To view your quotes, go to Sales → Quotes (if you have already created a few) or go 
to Sales → Create Quote to create your first one.
Straight up, you should notice that quotes look and feel exactly like invoices; how￾ever, here are a few things to be aware of so you can use quotes more effectively:
» Be sure to add an Expiry Date to each quote — this is key if you’ve given your 
customer a time-limited special deal.
» Once you have sent the quote and your customer comes back to you, change 
the status of the quote from Open to Accepted or from Open to Declined. 
From your Quotes list, click the Quote Number; on the Quote page that 
appears, adjust the Status drop-down to the right to update to Accepted or 
Declined.
Keeping the status of quotes updated helps if you’re chasing work and want 
to know which customers haven’t come back to you yet. If you have lots of 
quotes outstanding, you can sort the quotes in your Quotes list by filtering the 
Status (at the far right of the page) to get an overview of your Open quotes.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 89
» If a customer accepts your quote and you want to convert this quote into an 
invoice, go to your Quotes list and use the Search field to search for the Quote 
Number. Click the Quote Number and then at the bottom click the Convert to 
Invoice button. Then, hocus pocus, you will see it change into an invoice like a 
pumpkin to a carriage.
Note: When a quote changes to an invoice, it doesn’t keep the same quote 
number; instead, MYOB automatically applies the next invoice number 
available. So when this happens, know it’s the system and not a mistake at 
your end.
» Use the quick Create New function (the plus symbol at the top right of the 
page) to add a Quote quickly and easily.
» Create quotes on the go through the MYOB Invoices app (refer to the earlier 
section ‘Invoicing on the Go’).
To view your sales orders, go to Sales → Sales Orders. To create a sales order, go 
to Sales → Create Sales Order.
Like quotes, sales orders look and feel exactly like invoices. To make the best use 
of sales orders:
» Be sure to add a Promised Date — this helps set your customer’s expectation 
so they know when the item will be available and they can track its progress.
» If you want to convert a sales order to an invoice, display the sales order and 
click Convert to Invoice.
» Use your Reorder Stock report to keep track of what customers have ordered 
and how much stock you require. To use this report, simply record sales 
orders for any items that customers order for which you’re out of stock. Once 
you record a sales order for an item, the quantity on order displays in the 
Committed to Customer column on your Reorder Stock report. Chapter 10 
has all the details on this process.
At the time of writing, sales order features are relatively limited in MYOB Business 
(you can’t apply a payment against a sales order, convert a quote to a sales order 
or email a sales order). These improvements are in the pipeline and may be avail￾able by the time you read this chapter.90 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Setting Up Repeating Sales
Do you send some customers the same invoice month after month or year after 
year? Maybe you’re a maths tutor and you send out tuition fees every term, or a 
personal trainer with a set monthly fee.
The good news is you can set things up so that you don’t have to wear out your 
fingers typing the same invoice every month — you can create the invoices auto￾matically. Yay, more free time!
Creating recurring invoices
The first step is to create a recurring invoice, just like a template that you use to 
produce identical invoices again and again. Here’s how:
1. Create your customer’s invoice, but instead of clicking Save, click Save as 
Recurring.
Go to the Sales menu, click Create Invoice and create your customer’s invoice 
(refer to the earlier section ‘Recording Your First Sale (Yippee!)’ for how to 
create an invoice). Then, instead of clicking Save, instead click the Save as 
Recurring button to the bottom left.
A window pops up (see Figure 4-5 for a preview of what you’re in for).
2. Give your recurring schedule a name.
When prompted, type a name for your recurring sale in the Schedule Name 
field. Call this sale whatever you like, as long as it’s something you can recog￾nise (the customer’s name and frequency usually works pretty well).
3. Select how often the sale happens and a start date.
Indicate whether you make this sale every week, every month, every quarter, 
or whenever. Specify when you next want this sale to occur (this date has to be 
at some point in the future; you can’t travel back in time). Then, choose how 
many times you want this sale to be recorded (you have three options: 
Continuing Indefinitely, Continuing Until This Date, and Perform This Number 
of Times).
Hurrah! MYOB will do all the work for you and automatically create this invoice 
when it is next due, without you doing a thing. It will sit in your Invoices list 
ready for you to review and email.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 91
4. Click Save.
When you click Save, you’re flicked back to your original invoice. Don’t get 
confused and think that nothing has happened. It has. All you have to do now 
is click Save one last time to record the current sale and save this template for 
the next time you want to invoice this customer.
If the frequency of the transaction will vary and you don’t want the invoice to 
be created automatically, be sure to select the Frequency as Never. This way 
you have control and can create the recurring invoice whenever you wish. This 
may be helpful if you have customers on a trial period who have not yet 
committed to long-term use of your services or goods. All other frequency 
options will automate the invoice creation for you, which works well for sales 
that proceed like clockwork, such as monthly subscriptions.
Recording sales automatically
So you’ve created an invoice, saved it as a recurring template so that you can use 
it again, and you’ve recorded the invoice itself. Now, close your eyes and imagine 
time ticking by. Tick, tick, tick . . . Aha! You’ve arrived at the future, and now 
you’re ready to bill your customer again.
What you need to do next depends on what Frequency you selected when setting 
up the template.
FIGURE 4-5:
Setting up a 
recurring invoice.92 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you selected a specific frequency in the recurring invoice schedule (for example, 
scheduling an invoice to generate monthly or quarterly), you need to monitor the 
Activity column in your Invoices list very carefully. Unfortunately, although MYOB 
will generate customer invoices according to the schedule you’ve set up, these 
invoices won’t actually be emailed to customers, and you won’t receive any noti￾fications from MYOB that these invoices have been created. You need to monitor 
your Invoices list carefully so that when MYOB creates these invoices, you can 
review and email them.
In order to spot these unsent invoices, select Invoices from the Sales menu. From 
here, scroll across to the Activity column. Auto-generated invoices will stand out, 
as they’ll have a blank activity column indicating that they haven’t been emailed 
or printed yet. You can then click the Invoice No field to review and email the 
invoice.
Alternatively, if you selected Never as the frequency, then you don’t need to worry 
about monitoring statuses in your Invoices list. Instead, when you’re ready to use 
this template, simply select Create Invoice from the Sales menu, click Prefill from 
Recurring, and select the template you want. Then you don’t have to do much at 
all, except review, email and save.
Recurring transactions tend to be created by MYOB between 7am and 9am on the 
day the recurring transaction is due. If a whole heap of recurring invoices are cre￾ated for you, you can bulk email these rather than opening and emailing them one 
by one. Simply go to Sales → Invoices, click the square checkbox to the left of each 
autogenerated invoice and click the Email button that appears above your list of 
invoices. Complete the email Subject and Message, and click Send Invoices. This 
bulk send option is a handy time-saver if you have lots of recurring invoices.
Copying and changing recurring invoices
From time to time, you’ll want to edit your sales recurring template, maybe fixing 
up schedules, changing billing amounts or deleting old templates. To do any of 
these things, make your way to the Sales menu and down to Recurring Transac￾tions, and take the required action:
» To change the name, frequency or dates of a recurring transaction, click the 
purple Schedule Name, make the changes required, then click Record.
You can also create new recurring transactions from here too — select Create 
Recurring Transaction from the top right.
» To delete a template, go to your Recurring Transactions list, click the Schedule 
Name, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the Delete button.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 93
Deleting a recurring transaction template only deletes the template and 
doesn’t delete any transactions you recorded in the past using that template.
By the way, you don’t need to go through the hullabaloo of setting up recurring 
templates if you just want to create an invoice that’s similar or the same to one 
that you’ve created already. To copy an invoice, open an invoice that’s similar and 
click Save and Duplicate at the bottom right. You can then make any changes you 
require.
Sending Customer Invoices
Yay, you’re ready to send a customer your first invoice. Read on to find out how to 
print and email invoices, as well as how you can use eInvoicing in MYOB.
Previewing your first invoice
Before you send your first invoice, you’ll want to preview what it looks like to 
ensure it’s neat as a pin and has all the info that you want.
To preview an invoice, simply click the View PDF button towards the bottom left 
of your invoice. Click Export to view the PDF. (Note that depending on your Report 
Settings MYOB will either just open the PDF in a new tab or will download the PDF 
to view in the browser.)
If you want to tweak the format of your invoice, you can do so in your Sales Set￾tings menu. Chapter 1 talks more about customising invoice templates.
Emailing invoices
Here, I assume you have set up your customer contact details as suggested in 
Chapter 2 and have added the correct email addresses. Note: An email address can 
be added or removed within the following steps, but it’s good practice (and saves 
time in the long run) to add email addresses to your contacts for ease.
To email a customer their invoice, follow these steps:
1. Create an invoice as normal then click the Email Invoice button towards 
the bottom left (next to the View PDF button).
Your invoice will be saved before the email sends. A pop-up window opens for 
you to review the email information that will be sent. Figure 4-6 shows the 
email window and its options.94 PART 2 Everyday Activities
2. Check the customer’s email address is correct (as well as any extra emails 
you added through the contact).
You can add other email addresses on the fly here if needed, including a CC 
email. Note: Adding emails in this window does not update the Contact.
3. Review the subject and message.
The subject and message are pulled in from your email defaults in the Sales 
Settings. The Subject and Message can also be edited in the Email Invoice 
screen if you need to make any one-off adjustments.
To change your email defaults and make them a little more personalised, head 
to the Sales Settings and go to the Email Defaults tab, where you can edit and 
set the subject and message defaults for an invoice, quote or statement. Don’t 
forget to update your reply email address here too, so if the customer hits 
reply to email with a query, it comes straight back to you.
FIGURE 4-6:
Emailing an 
invoice.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 95
4. Add any further PDF documents.
You can also add other PDF documents to go out with the invoice; for example, 
if you’re a plumber and you want to invoice a client for materials at cost, you 
can add the receipt for these to your invoice. You can either drag a PDF copy 
into the attachment box or click Browse for Files to add a PDF document from 
your computer. The email will send with these attachments. Note: You can only 
add PDF-format documents here.
5. Check you are happy with the default Invoice Template.
The invoice template showing here is the one you have set as the default 
within your Sales Settings. If you need to change the default template as a 
one-off, simply click the drop-down arrow to the right of the template and 
adjust as required.
If you want to make a permanent change to your default template, go to your 
Sales Settings and under the Templates tab select the Template you want to 
set as your default. The Edit Template page appears, and you can tick the Set 
as Default Template checkbox in the Template Options panel, followed by Save 
over to the top right of the page. When you are emailing future invoices to your 
customers, this invoice template will become the default layout for invoices.
6. If you wish, tick Email Me a Copy.
MYOB will send a copy of the invoice to your email as well as to the customer.
If you have signed up to use OIP, you can also select Send SMS here — this 
way, your customer will also receive a link to their invoice via SMS direct to 
their phone, which will hopefully encourage them to pay immediately (via OIP). 
Chapter 7 talks more about using OIP.
7. Click the green Send Invoice button.
Move over, here comes eInvoicing
Electronic Invoicing or eInvoicing is a secure gateway that enables businesses to 
exchange invoices directly between different accounting software. The number 
one benefit (and why the government is encouraging its use) is the security of the 
transmission, which helps reduce invoice fraud.
Your MYOB file has the inbuilt capability to send and receive eInvoicing with any 
other business that is also using eInvoicing. The number of users in this network 
is growing steadily, and big businesses are leading the charge, as well as govern￾ment agencies, as they see the huge benefits of transmitting invoices in this way.96 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you want to explore this option and the benefits to your business, jump into 
your Sales Settings and go to the eInvoicing tab. Here, you can find out more by 
watching the short video, and you can register in just a few minutes if you decide 
to proceed. The only other change you need to make in your MYOB file is to ensure 
the ABN of all your customers has been added to their Contact card (eInvoices go 
straight to the recipient via their ABN directory and not their email address).
It may seem like early days for eInvoicing, but more and more businesses are 
starting to adopt this technology. Aside from improved security, other benefits 
include reduced admin costs, reduced human error and getting paid faster. For 
example, the federal government is committing to paying your invoice within five 
business days if you send it via eInvoicing. The ATO has many useful resources 
you can check out on eInvoicing, and in the not-too-distant future it may become 
the most common way to send invoices to your customers.
Creating and sending an eInvoice follows much the same process as emailing an 
invoice (refer to the preceding section). After you’ve registered for eInvoicing, the 
key difference is you will have an added button at the bottom of your invoice that 
says ‘Send eInvoice’, and the window that appears when you click this looks 
slightly different (see Figure  4-7), with no email address section, just the 
customer’s ABN — though you still have the attachment box and template options.
FIGURE 4-7:
Emailing an 
eInvoice.CHAPTER 4 Making Sales 97
SEE WHO’S LOOKING
You may have noticed that at the very bottom of your invoice page is a section called 
Activity History (see figure). Think of it as a roadmap of how your invoice has travelled. It 
starts with Created and the creation date. Then the entry Sending appears after you’ve 
emailed the invoice to your customer (which then changes to Emailed), along with the 
email address you sent the invoice to and the date and time you sent the invoice. If you 
have the wrong email address, the invoice’s activity will be stuck on Sending for a while, 
after which it eventually updates to Delivery Failed (this status also appears on the 
Activity column of your invoices list under the Sales menu).
The real magic is what follows — your Activity History shows you when your customer 
views the invoice, including the time as well as the date. It shows you every time your cli￾ent looks at the invoice and if/when they download it. Neat, huh?
The Activity History is super useful when you’re chasing unpaid invoices. You’ve no 
doubt heard the excuse, ‘I don’t seem to have received that invoice, can you resend it 
please?’ (I know how tempting it is to myself!) Well, now you have the perfect comeback: 
‘Oh really? I can see on my system you have viewed it 12 times and downloaded it, so is 
there a problem?’ Honestly, it’s like having a crystal ball!
Chapter 7 talks more about chasing unpaid invoices and getting your hard-earned cash 
in the bank.98 PART 2 Everyday Activities
The eInvoicing process has two other notable differences:
» Activity: The invoice Activity column on your invoices list will show as eInvoice 
Sent (instead of Emailed). When a customer receives your eInvoice and 
creates a bill on their side, the Activity changes to Accepted (meaning the 
customer has accepted your invoice, so all is well).
If a customer identifies an issue with a received invoice they can choose to 
reject it and send you a note explaining the issue — instantly, your Activity will 
change to Rejected. If you click into the invoice, the reason will have been 
added to the Activity History box at the bottom of the invoice for you to action 
so you can resend your invoice — very efficient.
» In Tray: If you are on the receiving end of an eInvoice, it appears automati￾cally in your In Tray for you, reducing admin time and keeping your data extra 
secure. You can then quickly create the prefilled bill from your In Tray. 
Chapter 8 takes you through all the ins and outs of using the In Tray.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 99
Chapter 5
Changing the Game with 
Bank Feeds and Rules
Put simply, a bank feed is where your bank obligingly ‘feeds’ your MYOB file 
with a list of transaction details from your bank account. Think of it as an 
electronic copy of your bank transactions that comes directly into your 
MYOB file. You have minimal data entry to wrestle with — your job is to allocate 
these transactions to specific account codes, or match these transactions against 
entries already recorded in your file.
Bank rules provide bank feeds with the perfect dancing partner. The idea is that 
you set up rules so that MYOB automatically codes transactions to the correct 
accounts. So, for example, you can set up a rule so that any time the word ‘Telstra’ 
appears in your bank transactions, MYOB allocates this withdrawal to Telephone 
Expense automatically for you.
IN THIS CHAPTER

The whole process works a treat, and the combination of bank feeds and bank 
rules can cut data entry time by many hours, gaining efficiencies for you when it 
comes to accuracy and reconciling.
No other feature in MYOB is as game-changing as bank feeds — the impact they 
have on data processing is huge! Signing up for bank feeds is the number one 
thing you should do in MYOB. It may take a little getting used to but when you’re 
off and running, you won’t look back.
Unlocking the Mystery of How 
Bank Feeds and Rules Work
An example may be the best way to explain how bank feeds work. With this in 
mind, Figure  5-1 shares a typical bank feed with a few weeks’ worth of bank 
transactions (which you can find by going to Banking → Bank Transactions).
FIGURE 5-1:
A typical bank 
feed for a bank 
account.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 101
Can you see how the bank transactions are listed on the left and then, on the right, 
MYOB shows how some of these transactions have already been matched or 
allocated automatically? Here’s what some of the options mean:
» The automatically allocated transactions have a little wand next to them, 
which appears when MYOB has automatically allocated a transaction based 
on a rule.
» The payment to Merc Electricity and Gas has been matched to an existing 
supplier payment (which was entered as a bill).
» The transactions with Allocate Me appearing on the right side have yet 
to be allocated to an account code or matched against an outstanding 
invoice or bill.
Different businesses tend to use bank feeds in slightly different ways, depending 
on the size of the business and how they use MYOB in relation to bills and invoices. 
I talk about these different ways of working later in this chapter, under the head￾ing ‘Using Bank Feeds to Allocate and Match Transactions’.
Getting Hooked Up
Given that bank feeds are almost certainly going to save you a whole heap of time, 
I suggest you apply for this service as quickly as possible. MYOB is proud of having 
what it calls ‘the best bank feeds in the market’ and it’s a fair claim — they are 
very accurate and timely, so you know you can rely on them. Read on to find out 
how to sign up to these miracle-working time-savers.
Connecting your bank feed
Signing up for a bank feed is easy-peasy. The only requirement is that you need to 
be the Owner of the file to do so (or to have Administrator as your user role and 
Online Admin as your user type — Chapter 1 covers user types in more detail if you 
need a reminder).
Here’s how to get signed up:
1. Go to the Banking menu and select Manage Bank Feeds from the drop￾down menu.
2. Click Create Bank Feed.
The Connect Your Bank or Credit Card page appears.102 PART 2 Everyday Activities
3. Choose your Account Type.
Are you setting up a normal bank account or a credit card? Select the correct 
option for your account.
If you are adding a loan account bank feed, select Bank Account.
4. Start typing the name of your bank in the Bank field to find and select 
your bank.
MYOB narrows down the list as you type. If you can’t find your bank, be 
mindful of the abbreviations used by many financial institutions. If you get 
stuck, start with the first letter of your bank’s name and scroll through the list 
provided until you find it.
If your bank doesn’t offer bank feeds (check MYOB Help for a list of all available 
financial institutions to be sure), click My Bank Isn’t Listed to access the option 
to import your bank feed manually. The later section ‘Importing bank transac￾tions into MYOB’ explains how to import your bank feed manually (which may 
be something you need to do on a recurring basis until, hopefully, your bank 
offers the facility).
After you select your bank, the Application Method options appear.
5. Select your Application Method.
The two possible options are either online via internet banking, or by email/
upload/post via an application form. Most banks now only offer online as an 
option, although some banks only accept a form (and some, if you’re lucky, 
may provide a choice).
6. If you choose (or are required) to apply Online Via Bank/Internet Banking, 
you simply need to select this option, check the I Confirm That checkbox 
(checking that you are happy with what you are confirming), and click 
Next.
An eight-digit code is generated for you to link your bank feed through to 
MYOB in your internet banking. Click Copy to copy your code for later use and 
then click the green Go to Online Banking button, which takes you directly to 
your bank’s internet banking login page.
Different banks have bank feeds living in different places, so you may want to 
Google your bank’s name and ‘bank feeds’ to find the relevant instructions 
from here. Alternatively, MYOB provides guides for many different banks, 
which you can access by going to Banking → Manage Bank Feeds and then 
clicking Get Help on the bottom left, which takes you to the relevant help for 
the page you’re on. Here, you can find direct links to these bank guides in the 
help section Setting Up Bank Feeds.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 103
Connecting through internet banking has a much quicker turnaround time 
compared to filling in an application form, and your bank feeds usually start 
within two or three days.
7. If you choose (or are required) to apply using an application form, enter 
your bank details as requested. Click the ‘I Confirm That’ checkbox 
(checking that you’re happy with what you’re confirming) and click Next.
The Finish Your Set-up window appears, where you can download an authority 
form, ready for you to check the prefilled data and sign (this needs to be signed 
by the bank account signatory). You can then either click Upload Authority 
Form to upload the signed form, or visit apply.bankfeeds.myob.com to 
upload your signed form.
On average, this process can take up to ten business days.
8. Repeat to connect other bank or credit card accounts.
Have more than one bank account or credit card? No worries, just follow the 
preceding steps for each one. To create additional bank accounts in your Chart 
of Accounts, see ‘Adding new bank accounts’ later in this chapter.
9. Check the status of your bank feeds.
If you’re feeling impatient, you can check the progress of your applications. 
Jump back to Banking and Manage Bank Feeds, and you can view the status — 
for example, Awaiting Bank, Awaiting Application Form or Bank Feed Ready.
ARE YOU SIGNING AWAY YOUR LIFE?
I sometimes get asked about how safe the whole bank feeds shenanigans are. Is it okay 
that MYOB can ‘see’ your banking transactions? Can MYOB access your bank account? Is 
your private information secure?
MYOB has a secure relationship with hundreds of banks, and it is the banks that are 
passing the transaction data in read-only format to MYOB — after you have given your 
permission, of course.
In other words, MYOB can’t do anything to manipulate your bank transaction data and, 
unlike some other accounting software, you never have to provide your banking logins 
and passwords in order to activate bank feeds. (And if you do get an email that looks 
like it’s from MYOB asking for this information, it’s a scam.)
So sleep easy. Signing up for bank feeds doesn’t mean you’re exposing yourself to 
unnecessary risk.104 PART 2 Everyday Activities
I do understand the concerns some people have around bank feed security, espe￾cially when online security is such a hot-button issue in this digital age. Read the 
nearby sidebar ‘Are you signing away your life?’ to put your mind at ease.
Activating your bank feeds
Once you receive an email notifying you that your bank feed is ready (or your 
status is saying Bank Feed Ready), you can activate your bank feed. Here’s how:
1. Go to Banking → Manage Bank Feeds.
The Manage Bank Feeds page appears.
2. In the Linked Account column for the bank feed, choose the matching 
bank account from your Chart of Accounts.
If you can’t see your bank account in this list, this could be for one of two 
reasons. First, the bank account may be set up incorrectly. Head to your Chart 
of Accounts, find the bank account and check that the Account Type is either 
Bank (for regular bank accounts) or Credit Card (for credit cards). The second 
reason could be that you haven’t created this account in MYOB yet. If that’s the 
case, skip ahead to ‘Adding new bank accounts’ later in this chapter.
Be sure to link your bank feed to the correct account. If you accidentally pick 
the wrong account, all transactions up until this point will be pushed to this 
account, which can be very messy to fix.
3. Click Save to finish.
Yay, you are now ready to go and view your bank transactions!
Importing bank transactions into MYOB
If you’re new to MYOB, you may well find that you have lots of transactions 
appearing on your bank statement for the days, weeks or months before your 
bank feed went live. For example, maybe you opened your business in March, 
but applied for your bank feed in late April. Your bank feed will only include 
transaction details from May onwards, leaving you with several weeks’ worth of 
transactions to record.
Don’t worry. You can easily import your transaction history with just a few clicks.
Wait until your bank feeds start to come through to your file so you can see the 
exact date they start. You want to be mindful not to double up on any transactions 
when you import your transaction history.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 105
Here’s how to import the missing transactions:
1. Login to your internet banking and download your missing transactions 
as a .QIF or .OFX file.
Google may be your friend here, as each bank has its own way of accessing 
transactions and exporting them in different file formats (for example, for an 
ANZ account you might Google ‘ANZ export QIF’). I haven’t come across a bank 
yet that doesn’t do this file type export but if .QIF doesn’t work then try .OFX.
When you’re selecting the date range to download, be very specific about the 
start date (usually the date you started your business, or started using MYOB), 
and your end date (usually the date prior to your bank feeds starting).
When you’ve established how to download the transactions, save the down￾loaded file to your desktop for easy access.
2. Go to the Banking menu, select Bank Transactions from the drop-down 
menu and click Import Statement in the top-right corner of the screen.
The Bank Statement Import History page appears.
3. Click Import Statement File.
The Import Statement File window appears.
4. Choose the correct Bank Account (from your Chart of Accounts) that you 
want to import your transactions into.
Ensure this bank account is the same account that you have linked your bank 
feed to so the imported transactions complete the account’s history.
5. Click the Browse button and search for the missing transactions file you 
just downloaded and saved, then click the green Import button.
Abracadabra! Your transactions import to MYOB and look and feel exactly like 
a bank feed. Hopefully, if you selected your date range correctly, you should 
see no double-ups or missing transactions. You are now ready to start creating 
some rules and allocations.
Transactions won’t be imported if they’re dated before the Opening Balance Date 
or before a Lock Date in your file. You can view these dates in your Business Set￾tings (under the Settings drop-down menu).
There should be no reason why you would want to import transactions from before 
your Opening Balance Date. However, if you’re adamant that this is the case, it 
may be your Opening Balance Date is incorrect. Speak with your accountant or 
bookkeeper for guidance on your next best steps.106 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If there is a Lock Date in place, consider why this Lock Date is in place, and the 
impact this date may have on reporting if you import prior period transactions. If 
you’re sure you need to import transactions prior to this Lock Date, go to your 
Business Settings, untick the Lock Date checkbox and press Save. Once you have 
imported the transactions you need, you can go back to your Business Settings and 
reset the Lock Date if required.
If you only need to import a few transactions for the missing period (maybe less 
than ten) and going to the trouble of importing these transactions doesn’t feel 
worth it, you can still catch up manually:
» For all withdrawals other than employee pays, go to Spend Money in the 
Banking menu. Chapter 6 explains more about the Spend Money feature.
» For all supplier payments, assuming you’ve recorded opening balances for the 
amounts you owe to your suppliers as well as all recent supplier bills, go to 
Create Supplier Payment under your Purchases menu. Chapter 8 explains 
more about making payments.
» For all employee pays, go to Create Pay Run in the Payroll menu. Chapter 11 
explains more about this process.
» For all customer payments, assuming you’ve recorded opening balances for 
the amounts customers owe you as well as all recent customer invoices, go to 
Create Invoice Payment under your Sales menu. Chapter 7 explains more 
about receiving payments.
» For all deposits that aren’t related to customer payments, go to Receive 
Money under the Banking menu (Chapter 7 explains more on this).
After you catch up to the date where your bank feeds went live, you can change the 
way you record transactions, taking advantage of bank feeds rather than record￾ing transactions manually.
Using Bank Feeds to Allocate 
and Match Transactions
In this section, I assume you’ve already activated your bank feeds (if not, refer to 
the earlier section ‘Getting Hooked Up’). Your bank feeds are typically delivered 
into your MYOB file every day with transactions from the day before.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 107
A handful of banks only provide bank feeds monthly rather than daily, so don’t 
panic straight away if you think your bank feeds aren’t working. MYOB has a Bank 
Feeds page (myob.com/au/accounting-software/bankfeeds/feeds) that con￾firms the feed frequency for all Australian banks so you can check the frequency 
and (hopefully!) relieve your concerns.
Allocating transactions directly from a bank feed takes care of nearly all the data 
entry involved with a transaction. If you enter a transaction manually (perhaps via 
Spend Money) you need to key all the data in, such as the date, amount and any 
relevant notes — which not only costs you time but also increases the likelihood 
of errors. With bank feeds, the only data entry error you may make is choosing the 
incorrect account code  — and you can minimise this risk by using automated 
transaction rules (for more on bank rules, turn to the later section ‘Learning the 
Rules of the Game’).
You also reap the benefits from using bank feeds when you come to reconcile your 
accounts as the dates and amounts arrive directly from your bank, which elimi￾nates the risk of you accidentally typing incorrect information. The efficiency and 
accuracy that comes with bank feeds is very much worth investing your time to 
understand them fully.
In the following sections, I explore how to allocate and match bank feed 
transactions.
Understanding the aim of the game
In the same way as the aim of Gin Rummy involves getting rid of all your cards, 
the aim when working in MYOB is to get rid of all unallocated transactions being 
delivered into MYOB from your bank feeds. At the point when you go to your Bank 
Transactions page and have no unallocated transactions appear, you’re winning!
Time to get to know your Bank Transactions screen (Banking → Bank Transac￾tions) and look at some of the filters you can use to make working with bank feeds 
easy as pie (see Figure 5-2):
» Bank Account: You can select All for all bank accounts, or filter by individual 
account bank feeds using the drop-down menu. If you have more than one 
bank account, the best way to begin is to select one bank account at a time 
until you’ve reviewed all transactions for each one. However, the All option is 
great when you’re double-checking your work or generating reports, as it’s the 
quickest way to check you have no unallocated transactions.108 PART 2 Everyday Activities
» Status: You can filter by All Transactions, Allocated or Unallocated. When you 
first start using bank feeds, choosing All may work best as it should feel 
familiar and show an exact copy of your bank statement, so you can work 
through the transactions one at a time — creating rules, allocating accounts or 
matching transactions. After you get a little more comfortable, you can set the 
Status to display Unallocated transactions — these are the transactions that 
require your attention, and you’ll have fewer transactions to scroll through.
When you filter to select Unallocated transactions, the transactions you code 
will remain on screen until you refresh the page or move to another menu 
and come back.
» Period and Date From/Date To: Either choose a pre-set time period from the 
Period drop-down menu (common accounting periods) or, if you’re just 
getting started, widen the date range (using the Date From and Date To fields) 
to select all transactions from your Opening Balance Date until the present 
day. When you’re all caught up and have got the hang of using bank feeds, 
selecting the Period of Last 3 Months is a good option here. If you’re working 
on your BAS then you may like to choose the BAS period to focus on until all 
your transactions have been allocated.
MYOB will remember the last date range you entered until you change it. So, if 
you enter today’s date to work through some up-to-date transactions, when 
you come back tomorrow you’ll need to change the date again to see the 
latest transactions — which can soon become frustrating. If you’re working in 
your file most days and you don’t want to keep messing with the dates, set 
your Date To as 1 July 2099, far off in the future, so that new transactions 
appear every day, without any hassles.
FIGURE 5-2:
The Bank 
Transactions 
page.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 109
» Search: You can look for anything in the Search field that appears on the Bank 
Transactions page (apart from a date), be it a description, amount or allocated 
account. You know the scenario, ‘I think the customer paid me twice as I 
already allocated that payment’? To check you’re right and solve the issue, 
simply search for the amount. So long as the Status and Date settings are 
correct, you’ll have your answer quick smart if you see two identical transac￾tions but with different dates.
Allocating new transactions
Now, it’s time for the fun to begin. You have your bank feeds rolling in, so where 
to start?
In a nutshell, your business has both income and expense transactions, and your 
job is to allocate each of these transaction types to the different account codes in 
your Chart of Accounts. This gives your business reporting meaning and purpose. 
Some allocations are clear as day (such as Telstra expenses going to Telephone 
and Officeworks going to Stationery), while others may be ambiguous (for exam￾ple, should your monthly payment to MYOB go to Accounting Fees, Subscriptions 
or even Software Expense?).
To overcome this ambiguity, chat to your bookkeeper or accountant about the type 
of business expenses you can claim for your industry and business. For example, 
if you work from home, do you know how much electricity you can claim — and if 
you want to claim for petrol, do you need to keep a logbook? Sure, you can just go 
allocate what you think ’til the cows come home, but if you’re not careful your 
accountant may re-allocate your accounts to tidy things up at tax time, leaving 
you with an unexpected GST bill if you’ve overclaimed during the year. Always 
ensure you understand your business expenses before you get click-happy with 
your allocations!
Allocating an account to a transaction is simple to do. You can either allocate 
transactions to a single account or allocate transactions to more than one account.
To allocate a transaction to a single account:
1. From the Bank Transactions page, in the Match or Allocate column, click 
Allocate Me.
2. Start typing the name of the account you think it should go to (if you 
know it).
For example, for Telstra, start typing Tele . . . and the relevant Telephone 
account from your Chart of Accounts should pop up.110 PART 2 Everyday Activities
3. Click to select the required account and you’re done.
If you’re unsure what account to select, click the drop-down arrow to the right 
side of the Allocate Me field you are working in and scroll through the list of 
accounts to find the best fit.
If the account you need is not currently part of your Chart of Accounts, you can 
create a new account on the go here. When you click the drop-down arrow on 
the Allocate Me field, at the very top you will see Create Account. Click this and 
a new Create Account window opens. Turn to Chapter 2 for more on creating 
new accounts.
To allocate a transaction to more than one account:
1. Click the drop-down arrow to the right side of the transaction to expand 
the allocation.
The transaction expands and you are taken to the Allocate tab.
2. Create separate line transactions to allocate the overall transaction.
For example, Figure 5-3 shows a Coles receipt where some items are for staff 
amenities and others relate to cleaning. You can add as many lines here as you 
like to allocate the transaction, as well as add item descriptions, and you can 
separate items that attract GST from ones that don’t. For example, in Figure 5-3 
the milk purchase has the Tax Code FRE.
3. Click the green Save button to save your allocated transaction.
After you’ve saved, the Bank Transaction page shows the transaction is Split 
Across Accounts in the Match or Allocate column.
FIGURE 5-3:
A familiar 
allocation 
breakdown.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 111
Uploading receipts or invoices
Whenever you record an expense, or match a payment to a bill, you have the 
opportunity to upload a source document (such as the original bill or receipt) to 
the bank feed transaction.
MAKING BANK TRANSACTION 
DESCRIPTIONS FIT FOR PURPOSE
Sometimes, when allocating transactions or reviewing a client’s file at the end of the 
financial year, I find the transaction descriptions leave me clueless as to what the trans￾actions relate to. (If I had a dollar for every time I’ve asked a client about a payment and 
received a mystified reply in return, I’d be sipping mojitos by the pool on some exotic 
island by now!)
To make everyone’s life easier (including your own), give internet banking transactions 
the time and respect they deserve by adding meaningful information in the message or 
description field. Add the name of who you are paying as a minimum, plus the invoice 
number if you can (each bank is different as to how much space you have to record 
descriptions).
It may also help to describe your transactions from the perspective of making your bank 
rules work effectively, such as using the word ‘wages’ when paying employees, along 
with their names. Then, you don’t have to create lots of rules for each different 
employee, but just one using the key word ‘wages’.
If you forget to add an adequate description when processing an internet banking 
transaction, you can still edit descriptions when the transaction comes through on your 
bank feed. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions, hover over the end of the current text 
in the Bank Statement Description column and you will see a little purple pen icon 
appear. Click this pen to edit the description.
When you’ve finished editing the description, the text turns purple, which lets other 
people in your organisation know the entry has been edited (nowhere to hide here!). 
You can still remind yourself of what the original entry said by hovering over the purple 
text — the original text appears.
My favourite thing about this feature is that you can make the transaction more mean￾ingful for you, your bookkeeper and your accountant — plus, the added narration pulls 
through to your reporting! You can also leave notes for others working in the file with 
you to maximise your collaboration and save you all time.112 PART 2 Everyday Activities
To do this, first expand the transaction by clicking the drop-down arrow on the 
far right. Next, click Link From In Tray to attach the relevant documents. If you 
have already saved documents on your computer, you can upload via the Attach 
Files option.
For more about the In Tray feature, skip ahead to Chapter 8.
Matching versus allocating transactions
Sometimes you need to match transactions, rather than allocate them. Often, 
MYOB will alert you to match a transaction by displaying the words Possible Match 
Found if it finds an invoice or bill for the exact same amount, as shown in 
Figure 5-4.
You may end up matching (versus allocating) transactions in six different 
scenarios:
» Customer payments need to be matched against customer invoices. See 
Chapter 7 for details.
Be super careful to match any customer payments, rather than allocating 
payments to an income account. (If you did allocate a customer payment to 
an income account, rather than matching it against an invoice, the invoice 
would still show as outstanding, and you would end up double-counting both 
income and GST.)
» Alternatively, if you record customer payments on the spot as they’re received 
(maybe you need to issue receipts), you’ll match the customer payment in 
your bank feed against the customer payment you already recorded from the 
Sales menu. Again, see Chapter 7.
» Assuming you complete pay runs using MYOB and your linked account is set 
to the bank account (rather than a clearing account), then employee pays 
need to be matched against the pay runs you recorded using the Payroll 
menu. Chapters 11 and 12 talk about employee pays.
» Supplier payments need to be matched against supplier bills. See Chapter 8 
for details.
Be super careful to match any supplier payments, rather than allocating 
payments to an expense account.
» If you pay suppliers electronically and you use MYOB to create a payment file 
that you import into your internet banking (see Chapter 14 for details), this 
batch payment needs to be matched against the payment you already 
recorded.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 113
» If you are transferring funds from one bank account to another, you will need 
to either match the payment or record this as a bank transfer. See 
‘Transferring money from one account to another’ for details.
Managing Your Bank Accounts
One of the secrets of good bookkeeping is to keep track of every single business 
bank account. In other words, don’t just record transactions for your main busi￾ness account, but do so for business-related savings accounts, credit card 
accounts, PayPal accounts, loans and so on.
In the next couple of pages, I explain how to set up multiple bank accounts in 
MYOB, and how to record the transfer of funds from one account to another.
Adding new bank accounts
Here’s how to add additional bank accounts to MYOB:
1. Go to Accounting → Chart of Accounts.
Your Chart of Accounts appears.
2. If a bank account is missing, work out a suitable number for this account 
and click Create Account.
If you’re creating a new bank account at this point, ask yourself where you 
want the account to appear in the list. Think of a suitable number that fits well 
alongside the others.
FIGURE 5-4:
MYOB often 
displays an alert 
to match, rather 
than allocate, 
transactions.114 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you’re going to use this bank account more than any other, give it the lowest 
number possible. That way, this account appears highest in your Chart of 
Accounts (the first bank account listed also becomes the default account that 
appears in your transactions).
3. Choose the Account Type and Parent Header (this determines where the 
account will sit in your chart).
This bit is important so listen up. For regular bank accounts, select Bank as the 
Account Type, and select Bank Accounts as the Parent Header. (If you can’t see a 
Parent Header with this name, you may wish to create one, so that you can group 
your bank accounts together — refer to Chapter 2 for more info.) For credit cards 
or loan accounts, simply select Credit Card as the Account Type. (It may seem 
weird selecting Credit Card as the Account Type for loan accounts, but it’s the 
only setting that works if you want to later link this loan account to a bank feed.)
4. Enter the Account Number, Account Name and select N-T as the tax code.
Enter the Account Number, press the Tab key with determination, and then 
type the Account Name — for example, ‘Westpac Savings Account 1234’.
It’s good practice to add the last four digits of the bank account number to the 
account name so you can easily identify the account at a glance.
5. Click the Save button.
6. If this new bank account is going to be your main trading account, review 
your linked bank account settings.
To do this, go to the Accounting menu, select Manage Linked Accounts, click 
each of the four Linked Accounts tabs and make the changes as required.
7. If you’ve already set up bank feeds with your bank, activate these now.
Refer to ‘Activating your bank feeds’ earlier in this chapter.
MAKING ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS
Most newcomers to MYOB start out by making payments as they normally would — by 
cash, internet transfer or credit card — and then recording these payments in MYOB 
afterwards, either manually or by adding transactions direct from bank feeds. This 
method works fine, but as your business grows and you find you process lots of 
supplier or employee payments, I recommend you use MYOB as your starting point 
instead. Begin by recording the payment in your company file first, then create an 
ABA (Australian Banking Association) file to upload the payment data to your internet 
banking for quick and easy multiple payments.
Chapter 14 talks much more about recording electronic payments in this way.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 115
Transferring money from 
one account to another
If a transaction on your bank feed represents a transfer between two of your bank 
accounts (for example, you transferred money from your Savings Account to your 
Visa Card), MYOB will usually identify the matching transfer automatically. All 
you have to do is match the two halves of the transfer together (the withdrawal 
transaction from one account and the deposit transaction in another).
If you use bank feeds, it’s super important to use the Transfer feature in MYOB, as 
explained below. If instead you allocate the Savings Account withdrawal directly 
to your credit card, and then allocate the credit card payment to your Savings 
Account, you’ll end up with duplicate transactions on both sides.
So here’s what to do:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions, and select one of the two bank 
accounts from which the transfer occurred.
One tip is to always start by recording transactions from the bank account 
‘highest up’ in your Chart of Accounts, and then move to accounts below this. 
That way you can be confident when you arrive at an account that’s lower 
down on your list, such as a credit card, that any transfers should already have 
been recorded.
2. Click the drop-down arrow to the far right of the transfer transaction.
The transaction detail appears.
3. Click the Transfer Money tab.
In the perfect world, MYOB automatically matches this transfer to the corre￾sponding transaction. For example, if you’re recording a withdrawal from your 
Cheque Account into your Savings Account, this withdrawal will be matched 
against the deposit that should already be sitting in your Savings account.
4. Select the matching transfer shown, as per Figure 5-5.
If you have many possible transfers to choose between, take care to find the 
correct match.
If no transaction is found, see ‘Transferring funds when there’s no match’ later 
in this chapter for troubleshooting tips.
5. Click Save.
All done! Both transactions are now allocated — if you refresh the page, you 
can see transfer has been applied to both transactions.116 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Transferring funds when there’s no match
What happens if you go to record a Transfer Money transaction but there’s no 
match? Here are four reasons why this might happen, along with what to do in 
each scenario:
» If you’re transferring funds to a personal bank account: Assuming this 
bank account isn’t set up in MYOB (and there’s no good reason why it should 
be), then you simply allocate this transfer to your Personal Drawings or 
Director’s Loan account.
» If you’re transferring funds to a bank account that doesn’t have a bank 
feed set up: Go to the Transfer Money tab, click Create a Transfer Money link, 
and record the transfer manually to the required bank account. (And once 
you’ve done this, do set up bank feeds to the renegade bank account!)
» If you wrongly allocated another transfer, thereby hiding the transac￾tion you need to match: In this scenario, return and check the transactions 
for that day in the other bank account, and if necessary, unmatch the 
offending transaction and start again.
» If bank feeds haven’t yet come through for the other bank account: Simply 
wait a day or so until the bank feeds for the other account come through.
If you’re not using bank feeds, a good method is to create a new account in your 
Chart of Accounts called Transfers Clearing Account (create this account as an 
Asset account with Bank as the account type). Manually enter each of the bank 
statement transfers (via Spend Money or Receive Money), allocating these trans￾actions to this new account. Hopefully this account will come to a $0.00 balance 
by the end of each quarter (though do check this balance regularly). By following 
this approach, you also avoid double-entry of transactions in your bank 
reconciliation.

Dealing with Tricky Situations
I know when I first started using MYOB I was fortunate to have had Veechi Curtis’s 
earlier editions of MYOB For Dummies to hand, and as I started to put my learnings 
to work I would always refer back to the book when I was stuck, in trouble or had 
messed something up.
With this (and all readers who’ve hit a wall and got stuck) in mind, it’s time to 
share all the things that can go wrong with adding and matching transactions, 
along with practical solutions for what to do next.
Transactions that don’t match 
when they should
What happens if you’re allocating bank transactions from your bank feed, and you 
know there should be a match for a particular transaction, but you can’t find 
where this match has gone?
Here are some common problems, along with suggested solutions:
» You receive lots of EFTPOS payments from customers each day and yet 
the bank feed only shows a daily total as just one deposit. Under the 
Match Transaction tab, be sure to select All Transactions under the Show 
BALANCING YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS
A big part of ‘Bookkeeping 101’ is reconciling your bank accounts so you ensure nothing 
has been missed. A common misconception is that if you have bank feeds you don’t 
need to reconcile, but this just isn’t true. Sure, if you have bank feeds your account is 
pretty much ready to reconcile, but you should still check your bank account balance 
against your actual bank statement balance.
You can do this either by clicking Reconcile from the Bank Transactions screen (Banking 
→ Bank Transactions) or by going to Banking →Reconcile Accounts.
Once you allocate, match or transfer a transaction from the bank feed, this transaction 
is automatically ticked off when you go to reconcile the account. If you used to reconcile 
bank accounts ‘the old way’ in earlier versions of MYOB software, you’ll find that mark￾ing off transactions in this way makes the reconciliation process much quicker and sim￾pler. For more about reconciling bank accounts, make your way to Chapter 9.118 PART 2 Everyday Activities
filter. All your customer invoices will be listed, and you can then tick the 
checkbox to the left for all the corresponding customers that the one deposit 
matches to. See Chapter 7 for more details.
» Your customer has underpaid/overpaid, or you have overpaid or 
underpaid your supplier. See Chapter 7 for more about processing cus￾tomer payments, and Chapter 8 for more about managing supplier payments.
» You use several credit cards associated with a single primary credit card 
account but only the secondary account appears on the bank feed.
Cancel the bank feed and re-apply, this time ensuring you use the primary 
credit card number on the application. (Bank feeds can only be associated 
with a single credit card account.)
» You use online banking to pay several different suppliers at once and 
these payments appear on your bank feed as a single withdrawal. The 
solution is to use Prepare Electronic Payments to group payments together. 
Chapter 14 explains how to work in this way.
» You have unmatched payroll transactions. One of the tricks to matching 
payroll transactions from bank feeds is setting up your linked accounts 
correctly so payroll transactions come out of a Payroll Clearing account. 
Skip ahead to Chapter 11 for more on this topic.
EACH TO THEIR OWN
I guess it’s part of human nature to believe that the way you choose to do things is the 
best way. However, with MYOB, there is no ‘best way’ to work.
For example, one client who just opened a new café lives from day to day in a whirl of 
activity. Suppliers get paid on a rather ad hoc basis using internet banking, and she 
never has to enter bills into MYOB as she pays them as they come in. Bank feeds have 
transformed the way she does her books. With the exception of payroll, she uses bank 
feeds as the starting point to add all business transactions and has configured rules so 
that most transactions are added automatically.
On the other hand, another client with a medium-sized manufacturing business creates 
invoices for customers and most suppliers are paid on 30-day accounts. He relies on the 
receivables and payables reports to manage cashflow, and to plan and budget as his 
business grows. He needs to use his MYOB in a more rigorous manner, with purchase 
orders, supplier bills, electronic payments, payroll and so on. This client uses bank feeds 
primarily to confirm and match amounts for transactions that have already been 
recorded way earlier than payment is actually received or paid.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 119
Deleting or changing bank 
feed transactions
Unfortunately, if a transaction has come through on a bank feed, MYOB won’t let 
you delete it. Mostly, I believe this is a good thing because as a bookkeeper, I rely 
on the integrity of bank feeds and trust them 99 per cent of the time. However, on 
several occasions I’ve legitimately needed to get rid of a bank feed transaction: 
Maybe I’ve imported a bank statement incorrectly, or maybe I’ve discovered that 
the bank has an error in its feed.
What do you do when you really do need to get rid of a transaction line? Here are 
some tricks of the trade:
» If you’ve imported bank transactions and got the dates wrong, resulting 
in one or two duplicate transactions: The trick here is simply to allocate the 
duplicate transactions to the same bank account the bank feed is coming 
from. This way, when you reconcile the account, the debits and credit offset 
each other so you see a nil overall effect. Quick, easy and works a treat!
» If you’ve imported bank transactions and got the dates wrong, resulting 
in heaps of duplicate transactions: If you have lots of duplicate transac￾tions, you can delete the whole imported statement. From the Bank 
Transactions window, click Import Statement, scroll down to find the state￾ment you imported, and click the x to delete it. Do be careful, however, as this 
will delete every single transaction imported on this statement, including any 
transactions that you’ve already allocated.
When you’ve deleted the imported statement, you can start again by import￾ing the new bank transactions — with the correct dates this time.
» If the bank has imported a duplicate transaction on a bank feed: First, 
reconcile this bank account so you’re absolutely sure there was an error in the 
bank feed, as such errors in bank feeds are rare (see Chapter 9 for more on 
reconciliations). After reconciling, if you’re still sure you want to get rid of a 
transaction, simply allocate this transaction to the same bank account as the 
bank feed is coming from. The debit and credit will cancel each other out, and 
the transaction will be hidden from sight once both transactions are 
reconciled.
Note: If you’re using AccountRight, you can get around the above issues by hiding 
transactions. Simply right-click the offending transaction and select Hide Trans￾action. Just like magic, it disappears from view. (At the time of writing, the ability 
to hide transactions is only available to AccountRight users, and not to MYOB 
Business users.)120 PART 2 Everyday Activities
When it comes to changing bank feed transactions, you will find that once a bank 
feed transaction has been allocated, you can edit both the date and amount from 
the Find Transactions page (currently there is no warning you are changing a 
bank feed transaction). However, if you do either or both of these things, MYOB 
will a) return the original transaction to the Bank Transactions page, b) create a 
duplicate transaction with the new date or amount details and c) will unreconcile 
the transaction (if it had been reconciled, that is). The duplication of the transac￾tion in particular can create enormous confusion, and so is best avoided.
Learning the Rules of the Game
As I explain at the beginning of this chapter, the idea of creating rules is to get 
MYOB to allocate transactions automatically based on the description (and/or the 
amount) that appears in the bank feed.
When you are on the Bank Transactions page (Banking → Bank Transactions), 
you’ll see that you can create different types of rules when you expand a transac￾tion. Use a Bill Rule for payments to suppliers where you’ve already recorded a bill 
in MYOB; use a Spend Money Rule for all other supplier payments as well as direct 
debits, bank fees or credit card expenses; use an Invoice Rule for payments from 
THE RAPID DECLINE OF CHEQUES
Do you still occasionally write cheques to suppliers? If so, remember that you don’t need 
to wait for the supplier to present the cheque in order for you to record the payment. 
Instead, you can record the cheque either using Spend Money (under Banking) or 
Create Supplier Payment (under Purchases), depending on whether you’ve recorded the 
supplier purchase in MYOB or not. Later, when the cheque appears in your bank feed, 
you can match it to the transaction you’ve already created.
I recommend you record cheques as soon as you post them to suppliers. This way, the 
balance of your bank account in MYOB more accurately reflects the funds you have 
available, and your Profit and Loss report stays up to date.
Having said all this, if you are still writing cheques, I recommend you consider shifting 
entirely to electronic payments. Not only are cheques time-consuming and expensive 
for you, but these days they are also usually an irritation for the person who receives 
them.
Fun fact, over the last ten years, cheque use in Australia has dropped by 83 per cent — 
no surprise there!CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 121
customers where you’ve already recorded an invoice in MYOB; and use a Receive 
Money Rule for bank interest, or deposits that aren’t related to customer 
payments.
Creating the perfect rules
To add a new rule based on your bank transaction information, here’s what to do:
1. Go to Banking → Bank transactions, and click the drop-down arrow to the 
right of any transaction to expand it.
At the bottom right of this expanded transaction (regardless of the tab you are 
on), click Create Rule.
The Create Bank Feed Rule window appears (Figure 5-6).
FIGURE 5-6:
Creating a new 
transaction rule 
seems easy, but 
take care with the 
detail.122 PART 2 Everyday Activities
2. Choose your Transaction Type (Spend Money, for this example).
For withdrawals, you need to choose between Spend Money Transaction or 
Bill. For deposits, choose between Receive Money Transaction or Invoice.
3. Give the rule a name that’s short and sweet.
MYOB defaults to using the whole description that was on the bank feed as 
the Rule Name. However, you want something that is easy to identify when 
you have a list of 50 rules and you need to edit a particular one. So, pick a 
name that means something to you.
4. Choose your Rule Type.
The Rule Type defaults to Automated Rule, which is what you need in almost all 
situations. The other option is Allocation Template, which I cover in the later 
section ‘Creating allocation templates’.
5. Choose whether to apply to All Accounts or one account only.
Unless you have a good reason not to, set rules so they run on all accounts. 
(Otherwise, you have to create a different set of rules for each bank account, 
which is unnecessarily painful.)
A possible exception could be if your business has multiple locations or cost 
centres with corresponding bank accounts for each one. If you’re reporting on 
each cost centre separately, then different rules would make sense.
6. Choose between Description or Amount as your rule condition.
Almost every time you will use Description for your rule conditions.
7. Specify what word(s) or phrase is going to trigger this rule.
I suggest you pick one unique word and delete the rest of the description 
(again, MYOB defaults to the whole description from the bank feed). For 
example, if your bank description says ‘Officeworks 0621 Subiaco’, streamline 
the rule so it is triggered simply by the word ‘Officeworks’.
If one word won’t be enough to make it unique then add a second word. For 
example, if you get fuel at Coles Express, Coles by itself won’t really work as 
you may also get milk and coffee at Coles. By adding ‘Express’ you can easily 
allocate your fuel spend to your motor vehicle fuel account. (Incidentally, the 
text isn’t case-sensitive so ‘coles’ would also work.)
8. Optional: Click OR to add any other words that this rule might apply to.
Make use of the OR function when you have many key words that can be 
allocated to the same account. For example, if you make regular donations 
to the Red Cross, you could set up a rule called Red Cross that codes these 
transactions automatically to Donations. Alternatively however, you could set 
up a rule that’s simply called Donations, and which is triggered by the words CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 123
‘Red Cross’ or ‘World Vision’ or ‘Oxfam’, and so on. Simply type each word next 
to the OR field to add multiple conditions.
Grouping transactions under broad rules in this way makes your rules list 
more manageable, and is useful for recording fuel purchases, stationery 
purchases, staff amenities or any other expense where the supplier 
name varies.
Figure 5-7 shows how helpful the OR feature can be, using the example of fuel 
purchases (Shell OR Ampol OR Caltex).
9. Optional: If you need to, make the rule conditions more specific by 
clicking Add Condition.
For example, perhaps you have one rule that allocates transactions to 
Telephone Expense if the word ‘Telstra’ is in the Description, but you have a 
FIGURE 5-7:
Creating a new 
transaction rule 
using the OR 
feature.124 PART 2 Everyday Activities
second rule that has an added condition that says to allocate the transaction to 
‘Internet Expense’ if the word Bigpond also exists.
Using rules and conditions takes a bit of getting used to, but they may prove 
invaluable if you have similar transactions and you find your rules aren’t quite 
working every time — maybe you simply need to add a condition.
10. Optional: Select a Contact or add a further description.
Selecting a Contact enables you to flag this contact for TPAR reporting. If this 
doesn’t apply to you, you can skip this field.
I discuss TPAR in Chapter 8.
Adding a further transaction description here can also help if you don’t feel 
the rule name or condition is self-explanatory. This description can be pulled 
through to your general ledger reporting if you customise your reports to 
include this detail. For more on customised reporting, turn to Chapter 14.
11. Select the allocation account or accounts by percentage or amount, as 
well as the Tax Code.
Most of the time, 100 per cent of the value of a transaction will go to a single 
account. However, you do have the option here to split by either a percentage 
or dollar amount. For example, if you’re creating a rule for Telstra, chances are 
you’ll select Telephone Expense as the account here. However, you may wish 
to split the transaction rule across multiple accounts by allocating a home 
office telephone bill to 80 per cent business, and 20 per cent personal.
Figure 5-8 also shows an 80/20 percentage split with regard to fuel use.
By getting these allocation details correct by using rules, you reduce the risk 
of overclaiming GST. Your accountant can guide you here if you need to split 
allocations for bills such as motor vehicle expenses and telecommunications.
12. Click Save.
Yay, you’ve done it! The next step is to see whether you can create rules for 
customer or supplier payments. Read on, dear friend . . .
Looking at rules for invoices or bills
You may wonder whether it’s worth creating rules for customer and supplier pay￾ments. Such rules only save a little bit of time because even when MYOB offers a 
possible match, you still need to allocate each transaction to the correct invoice or 
bill. However, customer and supplier payment rules help by filtering the match 
list so only the correct customer or supplier displays, making data entry just a tad 
quicker.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 125
Anyway, here’s how to create Bill or Invoice rules for customer or supplier 
payments:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions, find the payment transaction you 
want to create a rule for and click the drop-down arrow to the right of 
the transaction.
2. Click Create Rule at the bottom right.
3. Under the Transaction Type, choose Invoice or Bill.
If you clicked a deposit from the Bank Transactions menu, then Invoice 
appears as an option; if you clicked a withdrawal, then Bill appears. This is the 
key difference; the rest of the process is pretty much identical, for both Invoice 
and Bill transactions.
FIGURE 5-8:
Create a bank 
rule with a split 
allocation by 
percentage split.126 PART 2 Everyday Activities
4. Give the rule a name.
The supplier or customer name is usually enough here.
5. Choose whether to apply to All Accounts or one account only.
Select All Accounts unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.
6. Specify what word(s) or phrase is going to trigger this rule into action.
With customers, your choice of words very much depends on what that 
customer chooses to include as the text on their payment. If the customer’s 
name appears on the description, this is usually ideal, as is an account number. 
Avoid invoice numbers because these change with every payment.
With suppliers, you control what appears on your bank statement. For this 
reason, be consistent about what text you enter when making online pay￾ments to suppliers.
7. Select the Customer or Supplier name.
Either start typing the name and select from the options provided, or click the 
drop-down arrow to see a list you can select from.
8. Click the green Save button.
You arrive back at your Bank Transactions page.
With this rule in place, MYOB now replaces Allocate Me with Possible Match 
Found to alert you that a match may be available. All that is left for you to do is 
to click Possible Match Found and match the transaction.
Creating rules like a genius
Here are some tips for creating a reliable set of rules that will have everyone sing￾ing your praises:
» Sometimes, you can create a single rule that captures many different suppli￾ers. For example, Figure 5-7 shows how you can create a single rule for all the 
different places where you might buy fuel (refer to the earlier section ‘Creating 
the perfect rules’ to see how the OR function works). A great time-saver, and if 
you start getting fuel from another place in a few months, then you simply go 
to Banking → Bank rules and edit this rule by adding the new name.
Be careful when creating a rule for a company that uses a common term as 
part of its name. For example, if you add BP as the description condition when 
creating a bank rule for fuel purchases, MYOB will pick up every transaction 
that has the word BPAY as part of its description. (That was a lesson quickly 
learnt when one of my clients ended up with $16,000 coded to fuel expenses!) CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 127
One way to avoid this problem may be to use the Add Condition feature when 
creating rules (refer to the earlier section ‘Creating the perfect rules’ to see 
how the Add Condition feature works).
» Go through your list of rules periodically and review how you’ve set your 
conditions. If you can see two rules that have the same conditions, either 
delete one of the rules or vary one of the conditions.
» Be vigilant when it comes to spaces. For example, if you inadvertently enter a 
space after a name in the Description field, MYOB will consider this space to 
be a character in this situation and this becomes part of the rule.
You can take advantage of the space character to create an effective rule for 
using BP to buy your fuel — simply add a space after BP so that it doesn’t 
match to the word BPAY!
» You know if a rule is working because a wand appears at the front of the 
account allocation (refer to Figure 5-1). So, next time you’re thinking ‘Mmm, 
I’m sure I created a rule for that,’ but you can’t see a wand next to the 
transaction, chances are you did create a rule but the conditions aren’t hitting 
the mark. If you realise the rule isn’t working when it should be, don’t create a 
new one — go and edit the one you’ve already created and make it work for 
you (for how to edit rules, go to the later section ‘Editing and deleting rules’).
» Watch your spelling. (Need I say more?)
Changing transactions when rules apply
What happens if MYOB automatically applies a rule to a transaction but you know 
the allocation is not quite correct? For example, maybe you’ve spent $50 at the pet￾rol station and you can see MYOB has applied a rule to allocate this transaction to 
Motor Vehicle Expense. However, you are privy to the secret knowledge that actu￾ally you only spent $40 on petrol. The remaining $10 was devoured in chocolate.
The fix here is pretty simple if you know how. Even with the rule applied that 
sends the $50 to Motor Vehicle Expense, you can make changes. Go to your Bank 
Transactions page (under the Banking menu), find the transaction line that you 
need to correct and click the drop-down arrow to the right to expand the transac￾tion. Check you are on the Allocate tab (MYOB should take you here automatically), 
then simply change the amount entered for the fuel to $40 and then enter another 
line, selecting your Drawings or Loan account, and add the balance of the transac￾tion (in this case, $10). When all looks good, click Save. Problem solved!
You haven’t broken the original rule — it is still in play. You have only changed 
the relevant transaction.128 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Keeping Rules Nice and Schmick
If spring cleaning and endless trips to Bunnings aren’t your bag, then perhaps it’s 
best to apply any spring-cleaning enthusiasm to your list of rules. Go to the Bank￾ing menu and down to Bank Rules and review every rule. This section explains 
just how.
Editing and deleting rules
Keep an eye out for duplicate or conflicting rules, especially those that conflict in 
the way they treat transactions. For example, imagine you have a lease with ABC 
Leasing for your car and a lease with ABC Copiers for your photocopier and you 
create one rule that allocates any transaction with ‘ABC’ in the description to 
Photocopy Lease Expense, and another rule that allocates any transaction with 
‘Leasing’ in the description to ‘Motor Vehicle Lease Expense’. In this situation, 
MYOB won’t know which rule to select when it sees the words ‘ABC Copiers’ or 
‘ABC Leasing’ on your statement.
To review or change rules, go to Bank Rules under the Banking menu, click the 
Rule Name you want to edit, make your changes and click Save. To check your 
edits work, go into your Bank Transactions list (under the Banking menu) and 
refresh the page to see the wand appear next to the relevant transaction(s).
To delete a rule, click the Rule Name and at the very bottom select Delete.
Fixing things when you get a rule wrong
While bank rules can be a little bit of magic, they can also be a total pain if you get 
the rule wrong  — because, unless you’re super sharp-eyed, the mistake gets 
repeated again and again.
Imagine that somebody else — not you, of course! — has created a rule saying 
that any transaction with ‘Telstra’ as part of the description should be allocated to 
Advertising Expense. If you were using AccountRight, this would give you the big￾gest migraine as getting this fixed would require you to go back and individually 
change each transaction.
Fortunately, you can bulk edit transactions with the Find and Replace feature in 
MYOB Business. For more about this, skip ahead to Chapter 6.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 129
Incidentally, you can usually prevent mistakes in bank rules perpetuating them￾selves by double-checking how rules are applied. When in the Bank Transactions 
screen, always review any transactions that have a wand icon in the Match or 
Allocate column, and double-check that MYOB has selected the correct account 
(the wand icon means that MYOB has used a rule to allocate this transaction).
Creating allocation templates
Sometimes, you may come across transactions that vary in their description or 
amount and which can’t be allocated using a bank rule, but which you want to 
allocate similarly each time.
A great example of such a transaction would be a payment for your Business 
Activity Statement. Typically, although the amounts vary with each payment, the 
accounts that you split this transaction across are the same each time. In this 
situation, allocation templates work a treat.
Another example of when allocation templates are really handy is for coding 
payments where expenses have already been deducted from the amount that you 
receive. For example, I have a client who has five rental properties under the same 
entity. In the past I would have created recurring transactions for the monthly 
rental statement from the agent. As each transaction would be split into multiple 
line items, it would take ages to make sure I had the correct account code for all 
the different rental properties for both the income and expenses. Some were 
commercial and some were residential properties, so this added another layer of 
difficulty. By implementing allocation templates, I was able to save around three 
hours per quarter.
Here’s how to set up an allocation template, using a process that is very similar to 
creating a rule:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions, find the payment transaction you 
want to set up an allocation template for and click the drop-down arrow 
to the right of the transaction to expand the transaction.
2. Click Create Rule towards the bottom right.
3. Select Receive Money or Spend Money as the transaction type.
Your options will depend on whether you selected a deposit or withdrawal 
transaction.
Note: Allocation templates created on the deposit side (Receive Money) 
can only be used for deposits and the same goes for withdrawal allocation 
templates, unlike a rule which can be applied to all transactions as long as 
the condition fits.130 PART 2 Everyday Activities
4. Make the Rule Name meaningful (this will be the template name).
5. Change the Rule Type to Allocation Template.
As soon as you change to this Rule Type, your rule conditions disappear.
6. Optional: Add a Contact and further description to the transaction.
Refer back to the section ‘Creating the perfect rules’ to see the benefit of 
adding these elements for reporting purposes.
7. Create the Allocation Template in the Allocate By section.
Add in all the line items that you normally associate with this type of transac￾tion. Unless you know the specific percentage or amount breakdown (which 
you usually won’t with allocation templates, as otherwise you’d be using the 
simpler option of bank rules), just leave the first line at 100 per cent and all 
others at 0 per cent. This way, you just need to edit the amounts when using 
the template.
For example, with the templates I created for rental property income, the 
income account is set at 100 per cent and then all the other possible expenses 
show as 0 per cent underneath. Figure 5-9 shows how this template works.
8. Set your Job and Tax Codes as needed.
If you use Jobs, add these here (for more on Jobs, refer to Chapter 17), and if 
the Tax Codes need to vary from the default tax code, change them here too.
9. Click Save.
Applying allocation templates
With your allocation templates now configured (refer to the preceding section for 
details), you’re ready to put these templates into use:
1. When you are working on your bank transactions and you come across a 
transaction for which you’ve already created an Allocation Template, 
click the drop-down arrow to the far right to expand the transaction.
You should naturally land on the Allocate tab.
2. Click the Apply Allocation Template drop-down arrow and select the 
relevant allocation template.
Watch the magic happen as your created template now prefills the lines as per 
your template.CHAPTER 5 Changing the Game with Bank Feeds and Rules 131
3. Edit the amounts or percentages as required.
For example, if I’ve used an allocation template to record my Business Activity 
Statement, I’d edit the amounts to show the correct split of GST paid, PAYG 
paid, and so on. Or, using the example again where I’ve received a net amount 
for rental income, I’d edit the amounts for gross rental income and expenses 
deducted.
Depending on the template, you may not need to enter a value against each 
line. Avoid clutter in your General Ledger reports by deleting the zero value 
transaction lines: simply click the x symbol on the far right of the line (revealed 
if you hover over that space with your mouse). Deleting the line in this way only 
affects this transaction, and doesn’t affect the allocation template itself.

template.

Good data entry makes for good reporting, which in turn makes for good 
business management. Indeed, when recording and allocating expenses — 
which is what this chapter is all about — you could even say that it pays to 
let your inner pedant flourish. Being confident that you have all the little details 
right means you can make informed business decisions. You definitely want to be 
on top of understanding your numbers when you’re running your own business, 
and keeping a firm hand on your expenses is a crucial part of the equation.
In this chapter, I explain how to record day-to-day expenses, including how to 
choose the correct expense account, what tax code to use when, and how to find, 
change or delete transactions. This chapter also deals with the rather irritating 
and fiddly topic of petty cash, one of those things in life that takes up a dispropor￾tionate amount of time given the small amount of money involved.

Recording Expenses
In this chapter, I’m talking about recording expenses using the Bank Transactions 
and Spend Money menus. However, if you’ve already entered a bill in MYOB and 
you want to record the payment for this bill, this chapter isn’t where you need to 
be. Instead, you need to make your way to Chapter 8.
With this proviso out of the way, here’s the three different ways you can record 
expenses:
» Allocating a transaction to an expense account via the Allocate Me 
function on the Bank Transactions page (Banking → Bank Transactions).
Quick and easy, you scroll down your transactions, entering an account 
allocation for each one. See ‘Working from the Bank Transactions page’ 
next in this chapter for more.
» Allocating a transaction via the Bank Transactions page, drilling down to 
this transaction in detail. Again, see ‘Working from the Bank Transactions 
page’ next in this chapter for more.
» Creating a Spend Money transaction from the Banking menu. In times 
gone by, before bank feeds, using the Spend Money feature was the method 
for recording expenses. These days, most people only record transactions 
using Spend Money if there’s been a one-off glitch in the bank feeds coming 
through, they need to enter transactions that aren’t coming in via bank feeds 
(like petty cash) or they want to make an accounting adjustment. See ‘Using 
the Spend Money menu’ for more details.
Working from the Bank Transactions page
In Chapter 5, I explained how the best way to record expenses is to connect bank 
feeds or import transactions from your bank account. Assuming you’re working 
this way, the easiest way of recording a transaction is simply to enter an account 
in the Allocate Me column, as shown in Figure 6-1. You can also edit the Bank 
Statement Description if you need to add more meaningful descriptions.
However, you’ll often want to add more information than simply an allocation 
account, perhaps editing the tax code, adding a contact name or splitting transac￾tions across lines. The following steps explain what you need to do:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions, and select Unallocated as the Status.
You’ll see a list of all transactions that you haven’t recorded yet, but which have 
been pushed through from your bank.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 135
2. Optional: Select the bank account you want to record transactions for.
If you have more than one business bank account, it’s up to you whether you 
code transactions for all bank accounts at once, or work through one bank 
account at a time (it’s usually easiest to do the latter).
3. Click the drop-down arrow on the far right of the transaction line you 
want to allocate.
A detailed transaction window appears, similar to Figure 6-2.
4. Optional: Select a contact from the Contact (Payee) drop-down list.
If this contact doesn’t exist, you’ll have to go to Contacts → Create Contacts to 
add it. Note however that MYOB currently doesn’t have any reports that will 
display all transactions sorted by Contact, so this field is of limited use, and you 
may not wish to spend time entering this information (unless you need it for 
TPAR reporting — see the next step).
5. If this supplier is a contractor, consider when you need to click Report to 
ATO via TPAR.
In this instance, you will have to first populate the Contact field.
Chapter 8 takes you through all you need to know about TPAR.
6. Optional: Add a description in the Description of Transaction field.
Make the description meaningful (if you feel the bank narration is not sufficient) 
as these details will reduce the questioning later down the track by your 
accountant.
FIGURE 6-1:
Allocating 
transactions can 
be as simple as 
entering an 
account in the

column.136 PART 2 Everyday Activities
7. Select the Account.
Start typing the first few letters of the account to see if anything similar pops 
up. If it doesn’t, use the drop-down arrow to the right of the Account field to 
view your Chart of Accounts and then select the relevant account.
If you’re not sure which expense account to pick, see ‘Picking the Right Expense 
Account’, later in this chapter. Or if you’re splitting a transaction across multiple 
expenses, see ‘Splitting an expense across more than one account’.
8. Optional: Enter the Quantity.
You can’t record inventory purchases in this window, so it’s unlikely you’ll ever 
be recording quantities, but if this information is useful, go right ahead. For 
example, quantity information may be useful for claiming fuel tax rebates, 
when you need to report on the quantity of litres purchased. (Note that you 
can customise your General Ledger report to display quantity information, a 
topic covered in more detail in Chapter 15.)
9. Optional: Add a line description.
If you’re splitting a transaction across multiple lines, you can add a description 
to each line itemising what the payment is for.
10. Optional: Enter a Job.
If you track expenses by particular jobs, projects or cost centres, select the 
appropriate job from the drop-down list of jobs to the right of the Job field 
(for more details about jobs, see Chapter 17).
FIGURE 6-2:
Recording 
an expense in 
full detail.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 137
11. Review the Tax Code.
The field will prefill with the tax code assigned to the account as per your Chart 
of Accounts. Not sure what code you need? See ‘Choosing the right tax code’ 
later in this chapter for more details.
12. Optional: Attach a copy of the expense invoice or receipt.
You can add a copy of the supplier’s tax invoice or receipt to the transaction, 
either by dragging the file into the Attachments section or by clicking Browse 
for Files and browsing for the saved file on your computer.
13. Optional: If this is a transaction that occurs regularly, or a supplier who 
you pay often, click Create Rule.
If you have an expense that occurs regularly, you can use bank rules to 
automate as much of the data entry as possible, saving time for you to enjoy a 
Netflix binge. I even have quarterly competitions within my practice to see who 
can get the highest percentage of transactions allocated by rules! I explain how 
to set up bank rules in Chapter 5.
14. Click Save.
Using the Spend Money menu
If you decide to use MYOB without setting up bank feeds or importing transactions 
from your bank  — something I counsel strongly against  — then you can still 
record your expenses. The difference is that you select Spend Money from the 
Banking menu, rather than going to the Bank Transactions page.
Recording expenses using Spend Money is almost the same as recording expenses 
from the Bank Transactions page, but with a couple of little differences:
» Before recording the transaction, select the bank account you used to pay for 
the expense from the Bank Account drop-down list at the top left.
» You’ll have to enter the date. Be sure to enter the date the payment was 
debited from your bank account.
If you use Spend Money to record a transaction that you know is going to happen 
again and again, such as a regular monthly lease payment or rent, you can save 
this transaction so that MYOB records it automatically. To do this, enter your 
transaction as you normally would, but instead of clicking Record, click Save as 
Recurring. You’ll be prompted to create a name for this transaction as well as a 
payment frequency and start date.
Based on the frequency you select, MYOB will create and record this transaction 
automatically. Alternatively, if you don’t want to automate the transaction, you 138 PART 2 Everyday Activities
can select the frequency as Never, and instead select the transaction by going to 
Banking → Recurring Transactions when required.
Splitting an expense across 
more than one account
What happens if you want to allocate an expense to more than one account? If 
you’re working from the Bank Transactions page, click the drop-down arrow at 
the far right of the transaction line to reveal the transaction details. If you’re 
working in Spend Money, simply add another line, splitting the transaction across 
as many lines as required.
Figure 6-3 shows how to split a single payment across more than one account. In 
this example, the home office telephone bill is split between Telephone Expense 
(which you can claim as a tax deduction) and Personal Drawings. Lovely.
You can also attach a copy of the bill to the transaction using the Attachments area 
at the bottom left of the expanded transaction (as shown in Figure 6-3).
If you’re splitting an amount across two accounts and you’ve already entered the 
first line, simply click in the Amount ($) field on the second line and press 
the = key on your keyboard. The remaining allocated amount and percentage 
automatically appear. Magic!
FIGURE 6-3:
Splitting expenses 
across more than 
one account.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 139
Working with credit cards
Recording credit card transactions is the same as recording any other kind of 
transactions. However, here are a couple of comments specific to credit cards:
» Bank feeds really come into their own when recording credit card spending. 
Once you have allocation rules configured, you probably cut the time required 
to enter transactions by about 85 per cent.
» Some banks won’t offer you a bank feed if the credit card is in your personal 
name (this is down to your bank, not MYOB). This lack of bank feeds can be a 
real hassle, and so it may be worth changing your credit card to a business 
account, especially if you have a high volume of transactions.
The other alternative is to import the transactions via .QIF or .OFX file formats 
(which can be cumbersome over a long period as exact dates are required). 
I discuss importing transactions in Chapter 5.
» If you already have an amount outstanding on the credit card when you 
create the account, you can record the balance in the Opening Balance field 
so that your credit card account will reconcile without issue.
» Credit Card accounts are generally set up as a liability, with the Account Type 
being Credit Card.
» If some of the debits on your credit card statement are for personal purchases 
(credit cards often end up with a mix of business and private transactions), 
choose a drawings account or a director’s loan account as the allocation 
account for these purchases.
» A credit card is like any other bank account — you need to reconcile your 
credit card account in the same way as you reconcile your other business 
bank accounts. (Chapter 9 explains more about reconciling bank accounts.)
» To record credit card payments, refer to the section in Chapter 5 regarding 
transferring funds from one account to another.
Picking the Right Expense Account
The real skill of bookkeeping (aside from accuracy) lies in knowing which account 
to select. Although I can’t provide you with hard-and-fast rules about which 
account you should select in every situation, Table 6-1 provides some pointers on 
a few of the transactions that are trickiest to allocate.140 PART 2 Everyday Activities

What should you do if you don’t have enough information to allocate a transaction 
yet? Perhaps you’re still waiting for details from a supplier, or perhaps it’s a debit 
on a credit card that you don’t recognise.
One simple approach is to allocate such transactions to an expense account called 
‘Suspense’. Later, when you receive the bill you’ve been waiting for or solve the 
credit card mystery, you can return to this transaction and re-allocate it.

or Payment Comments Use This Account
Personal spending 
(director or share￾holder of a 
company)
A company director or shareholder can only use 
company funds for personal purposes if they take 
these funds in the form of wages or directors’ 
fees or as a debit against a Directors’ or Share￾holders’ Loan account. Your accountant is your 
best guide as to which method is relevant for 
your business.

Wages If you have lots of employees, you may want to 
consider creating a few wages expense accounts 
for different departments or areas of the busi￾ness so you can see more detail about wages in 
your Profit and Loss reports.
Wages Expense142 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Alternatively, if you’re unsure how to code something, a neat solution is to create 
an expense account in your Chart of Accounts called ‘Queries to Code’. Then, if you 
allocate transactions you’re unsure of to this account, ensuring you add a full 
description to each one, you create a call to action for your accountant or book￾keeper to help you reallocate these transactions. This way you can differentiate 
between ‘Suspense’ account enquiries, where you’re waiting to get more informa￾tion about something, and accounting enquiries, where you’re unsure about where 
to allocate the transaction.
If you’re lodging your own BAS (Business Activity Statement), you first need to 
ensure any transactions sitting in query or suspense accounts have been allocated 
before generating final GST reports.
Understanding GST (You’ll 
Be the Only One)
GST made easy? I may as well be writing out a calculus equation. But I’m not eas￾ily discouraged (besides, I love maths!), so here’s my very easy to swallow  — 
oops, I mean follow — take on which tax code to choose when, and how to calculate 
GST backwards. If you’re after more nitty-gritty GST details, try Chapter 16.
Choosing the right tax code
If you’re registered for GST, every time you record a transaction in MYOB, you 
need to complete the Tax column, as follows:
» If the payment is for goods or services that attract GST, select GST as 
the tax code.
» If the payment is for goods or services that are GST-free (medical supplies, 
GST-free food and so on), select FRE as your tax code.
» If the payment is for goods or services that are for your own private use, 
select N-T as the tax code.
» If the person you’re trading with isn’t registered for GST but has an ABN, select 
FRE as your tax code.
Whenever you pay for something and you want to claim a GST credit, make sure 
you obtain a proper tax invoice, complete with the supplier’s ABN, so you can 
check the validity of the supplier. See Chapter 8 for more on this task.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 143
Getting tax codes right, automatically
When you record expenses, does the tax code always come up as N-T, meaning 
you have to change the tax code every time? If so, you haven’t set up your Chart of 
Accounts correctly (or you chose ‘not registered for GST’ when first setting up 
your MYOB file).
Save yourself time by correcting these default codes. Go to your Chart of Accounts 
under the Accounting menu, select Edit Accounts and edit the Tax Code fields as 
required. Chapter 2 explains how you can do this in bulk quick-smart, too.
If you’re registered for GST, most income and expense accounts require either 
GST or FRE as their code (although there are some exceptions, of course). If you 
need more help figuring out which code to pick, see Chapter  16 or ask your 
accountant.
Recording mixed transactions
Whenever you buy a mix of things that include GST and things that don’t, like 
picking up some items at Coles for staff amenities and there being a mix of GST￾attracting and GST-free items, you’ll find that the GST ends up not being 10 per 
cent of the total but something quite different. What do you do?
The trick is to record your payment but split the transaction over two lines. For 
example, in a hypothetical $17.10 Coles shop, the $4.30 biscuits attract GST but 
the $12.80 on coffee and milk is GST-free, so you record the transaction’s details 
on two lines. On the first line, select Staff Amenities Expense as your allocation 
account, type $4.30 as the amount and select GST as your tax code (you can also 
add an extra description of the biscuits on this line to help your accountant or 
bookkeeper understand the reason for the split). On the next line, select Staff 
Amenities Expense as the allocation account again, but this time type $12.80 
as the amount and select FRE as your tax code. From here, you can check the tax 
amount now matches your receipt. Figure  6-4 shows this split GST allocation 
in MYOB.
This Coles split calculation example is simple; however, if you’re not sure what 
amount is subject to GST, just multiply the GST amount showing on the tax invoice 
by 11 and this gives you the grossed-up total on which to allocate the GST compo￾nent (Chapter 16 helps make sense of why this works!). As an extra check, always 
double-check the total Tax ($) amount matches the tax invoice.144 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Locating and Changing Transactions
So, you’ve recorded heaps of transactions and now you want to be able to view 
your work  — maybe you want to change a transaction, check whether you’ve 
entered something correctly, or even delete a mistake. You can do all these things 
either by going to your Bank Transactions report or using Find Transactions.
Badgering the Bank Transactions report
Go to Reporting → Reports, and under the Banking tab you’ll find the Bank Trans￾actions report. All your bank and credit card accounts will be here for you to peruse 
at your leisure. You can filter by date or click the Accounts button to view just one 
bank account at a time.
To see the full list of all transactions created under a bank account, select Expand 
All to get the details (see Figure 6-5 for an example) showing all deposits and 
withdrawals over the period of time you select listed in date order.
Scroll down until you find the transaction you’re looking for, and then click on the 
purple Reference number to display this transaction. You can then review, edit or 
delete the transaction from here.
FIGURE 6-4:

transaction to 
record the correct 
GST tax amount.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 145
Flipping out with Find Transactions
The Find Transactions menu is the best place to find most transactions easily 
because of its Search field, which the Bank Transactions report lacks. To get to 
this menu, go to Banking → Find Transactions (the Find Transactions option is at 
the bottom of the list that appears).
You have three tabs to choose from depending on what you’re looking for:
» The first tab is Debits and Credits. This shows a detailed view of the transac￾tion, including the associated debits and the credits, with any GST amounts 
separately. Here you have a search field and great filters, including a drop￾down to select different account codes and a filter for searching by Source 
Journal. (A source journal groups your data based on the type of transaction. If 
you’ve used AccountRight before, these source journals are the ideal way to 
find transactions in your file, so they work really well here as filters.)
» The second tab lists Transactions, and again it is super easy to search for an 
amount, description or reference number to help locate your transaction 
(rather than scrolling through an endless list). Knock yourself out putting the 
search function to the test!
» Find and Replace is the last tab, and it is super useful for editing transactions 
in bulk. See ‘Changing lots of transactions in one fell swoop’ later in this 
chapter for more details.
FIGURE 6-5:

Removing transactions
Whether or not you can delete transactions depends on how you recorded them in 
the first place.
If you recorded the transaction manually (for example, using the Spend Money 
menu), then it’s easy to delete the transaction. Simply click into the transaction 
and then click the Delete button. Be careful, however — if you delete a transaction 
that has already been reconciled, you will throw your bank reconciliation out of 
balance. (Unlike MYOB AccountRight, MYOB Business does not give a warning 
that a Spend Money transaction has been reconciled if you delete it.) For this rea￾son, always check whether a transaction has been reconciled before deleting it.
If this transaction was recorded from a bank feed or was imported from a bank 
statement, when you select Delete (in the transaction view), you are deleting the 
recorded transaction and returning it to an Unallocated status in your bank 
transactions — you are not deleting the actual bank feed transaction. Refer to 
Chapter  5, where I talk more about removing transactions from bank feeds or 
from imported bank statements.
Changing transactions
Sometimes you may want to change a transaction rather than delete it. Perhaps 
you allocated an expense to the wrong account, or perhaps you allocated a 
payment to an expense account instead of matching it against a supplier bill. 
Fortunately, fixing mistakes is easy.
Find the offending transaction using Find Transactions (refer to the earlier 
section ‘Flipping out with Find Transactions’). Click on the purple Reference 
number to display the transaction.
If your error was an account allocation, incorrect tax code or missing job code, fix 
your mistake and simply click Save. If your error was that you recorded an expense 
instead of matching a payment against a supplier bill, click the Unmatch button. 
This will return the transaction to a status of Unallocated on the Bank Transac￾tions page and from there, you can record the transaction correctly.
If this transaction was recorded from a bank feed, be careful that you don’t change 
the date or the amount as this will create a duplicate transaction that includes the 
changes you made and push the original transaction’s status back to Unallocated 
in your bank transactions. You may not even be aware another transaction has 
been created (as it does not give you a warning) until you reconcile your bank 
(turn to Chapter 9 for more on reconciling).CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 147
Changing lots of transactions in 
one fell swoop
Sometimes you may need to edit a whole heap of transactions in one go. Maybe 
you’ve made a particular mistake repeatedly over several months, or perhaps you 
created a rule incorrectly that coded numerous transactions to the wrong account. 
In good news, you don’t need to edit each transaction individually. Instead, MYOB 
has a better solution so you can fix the transactions in no time: Find and Replace.
To take advantage of the Find and Replace feature:
1. Go to Banking → Find Transactions.
You have three tabs across the top of the page that appears: Debits and 
Credits; Transactions; and Find and Replace.
2. Go to the Find and Replace tab. Set your filters, choosing a wide enough 
date range to capture all the wrong allocations. Keep the Source Journal 
on All.
3. Select the Account in which the transactions were allocated incorrectly 
from the Account drop-down field.
For example, perhaps you created a rule that coded every payment that had 
‘MYX Accountant’ in the transaction description to Advertising Expense, and 
now you realise these payments should have been coded to Accounting 
Expense. In this situation, you’d select Advertising Expense as the account.
4. If need be, use the Search field to refine the list.
In my example, you could search for ‘MYX’ to display the incorrect transactions.
5. Tick the checkboxes to the left of the Date for each incorrect transaction 
and click Replace.
As soon as you begin to select the incorrect transactions, a Replace button 
appears at the top of the list.
If your list is perfectly filtered and you’re confident there are no correct 
transactions in the filtered list, you can simply tick the checkbox to the left 
of the Date filter to select them all.
A pop-up box appears after you click Replace.
6. Assign the correct account and the correct Tax Code from each drop￾down list and click the green Replace button.
Figure 6-6 shows this correction for my example, where I’m assigning the 
incorrect transactions to Accounting Fees.148 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Give it a few seconds and voila, the transactions are all re-coded just like 
that . . . and the magic keeps happening.
If you use AccountRight, this feature is only available when you access your file 
via the browser.
I know many accountants and bookkeepers that would journal the total from the 
wrong account over to the correct account, but this doesn’t provide the best expe￾rience when you’re reviewing your reports at the end of the year.
With the Find and Replace feature, you can fix mistakes such as these in a matter 
of seconds. You have all the great filters from the first two tabs, plus you can 
search by Account and Tax Code. (It’s hard to imagine working without these 
types of filters — they save so much time, so do make the most of them!)
It’s a Petty Business
You can find as many ways to deal with petty cash as there are ways to make pasta 
sauce. But a few things never change, like the tomatoes — no matter what type of 
business you run:
» Energy drinks, roses for the beautiful girl at the train station and vet bills are 
not legitimate petty cash receipts. Get real.
FIGURE 6-6:
Using Find and 
Replace to

» When someone takes petty cash from the tin and promises to come back with 
a receipt, they probably won’t.
» When someone sticks an IOU in the petty cash tin, it means that they’d love to 
pay you back, but they always seem to forget — and who carries cash these 
days anyway?
» No matter how finicky you are, petty cash will rarely balance as there are too 
many moving parts.
In the next couple of sections, I talk about two ways to deal with petty cash. The 
first method is best for owner-operators paying expenses out of their own pocket. 
The second method is best for businesses that have employees and need a petty 
cash tin. Take a look and see which suits you best.
Although I obligingly explain how to deal with petty cash in this chapter, my pri￾mary recommendation is to avoid paying for any business expenses on your per￾sonal card or using cash. Cash is painful and time-consuming for bookkeepers, 
especially if you contrast working off a bank feed from a credit card against 
recording petty cash receipts.
Stop using your personal card
Always use your business bank account to pay for business expenses. This way, 
the transactions come through via your bank feeds and you won’t miss claiming 
any as a deduction.
Occasionally, however, you may end up paying for an expense using a personal 
debit or credit card, or perhaps even with cash. In this situation, you record such 
expenses using this simple method:
1. Every month or so, go on a mad hunt for receipts for any expenses that 
didn’t come out of your business bank account, but which you paid for 
with cash or using a personal bank account.
If you’re the business owner reading this book, dig through your pockets, tip 
out your wallet or look under the seats of your car. If you’re a bookkeeper, 
hassle your employer or client to find every receipt they can lay their hands on. 
In the industry, such clients are generally called ‘shoe box’ clients as they tend 
to throw all their receipts in a box for safekeeping then hand it over.
2. Clear a patch on your desk and sort the receipts into categories.
One pile for stationery, one pile for computer supplies, one pile for postage 
and so on. (Remember, at this point you only want receipts for business 
expenses paid for by physical cash or paid for out of personal accounts that 150 PART 2 Everyday Activities
aren’t tracked using MYOB; ignore receipts for things paid for by EFTPOS or 
corporate credit cards.)
3. Use a calculator to add up the total value of each pile, and then write 
these totals down on the front of an empty envelope.
You end up with an envelope that reads something like:
• Total stationery receipts = $15.00
• Total postage receipts = $45.00
Of course, if you want to type these entries into a simple spreadsheet, that’s 
fine too.
4. Add up the total value of all these receipts and write this total on the 
front of the envelope.
Alternatively, print your spreadsheet summary and staple this summary to the 
front of the envelope.
5. Stuff the receipts into the envelope and close it up.
6. Go to the Accounting menu and select Create General Journal, and enter 
a journal entry that debits each expense and credits the total as either 
Owner’s Drawings or Owner’s Loan Account.
Figure 6-7 shows a typical general journal. This journal debits three expense 
accounts (Office Supplies, Motor Vehicle Fuel and Postage), and credits the 
Owner’s Drawings account.
It’s usually easiest to enter the date as the last day of that month or quarter 
(it’s okay to group the expenses under this date even if the transactions were 
made on different dates, as long as they fall within the same Business Activity 
Statement period).
Receipts may simply vanish in the glovebox ether, so if you tend to spend a lot of 
business-related money using your personal accounts, it may be a good idea to 
read through your personal bank statements to ensure you don’t miss any other 
business expenses.
Lock it up, tie it down
If a business has employees who sometimes pay for business expenses by cash, 
you need to set up a decent petty cash system. Here’s the whole deal, from start to 
finish:
1. Buy a petty cash box.
It’s time to liberate your cash from the biscuit tin. Buy a real petty cash box 
with a lock and key. I’m serious.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 151
2. Appoint a gatekeeper.
Put someone in charge of petty cash and make sure no-one else knows where 
the key is kept. This includes you. You’re not allowed to raid the petty cash tin 
for Chinese takeaways and meat pies anymore. Those days are gone.
3. Start with a float of between $100 and $200.
Go and withdraw from an ATM a nice round number (say $100) and put this 
amount of cash in the tin. When you record this withdrawal, allocate the full 
amount to an asset account called Petty Cash (there’s usually an account 
already in place by this name).
4. Every time anyone takes money out of the tin, get a receipt.
This is the part that requires a huge leap in psychology. Every time someone 
takes money from petty cash that person has to come back with a receipt. This 
is pretty radical. It works well if the gatekeeper hassles everyone mercilessly: 
No receipt, no cash next time. It also helps if your notes are a little bigger, as 
people need to bring back the change, which is an opportunity to push them to 
bring the receipt too!
5. When petty cash is low, sort out the receipts.
When petty cash funds dwindle, tip all the receipts out and sort them into piles. 
Write a breakdown of the receipts on the back of an envelope (for example, 
$30 postage, $10 cleaning products, $15 chocolate biscuits, and so on), and 
stick the receipts in the envelope. Of course, if you want to list these entries 
using a simple spreadsheet, that’s fine.
FIGURE 6-7:

expenses paid

personal 
accounts or cash.152 PART 2 Everyday Activities
6. Enter the petty cash transactions in Spend Money, splitting these 
transactions across different account codes.
This will be one of the times that you will need to use Spend Money even if you 
have all the bank feeds connected. Select your Petty Cash account as the bank 
account. Then look at the back of your envelope or your spreadsheet for the 
breakdown of receipts (refer to Step 5). Enter each amount, line by line, 
selecting the relevant account code for each different kind of expense. When 
you’re finished, your Spend Money transaction should look similar to the 
transaction shown in Figure 6-8.
7. Make an ATM withdrawal to top up the petty cash close to the original 
value of the float.
With ATMs only giving multiples of $20 and $50, it will be hard to get the float 
back to the exact original amount so just try as close as you can here.
8. Record this withdrawal in your bank feeds to the Petty Cash account.
9. Check that the balance of your Petty Cash account now matches the 
balance of the petty cash tin.
Here, you can simply view the balance of the Petty Cash account and be sure 
that it is the correct balance, but it’s good practice to reconcile your petty cash 
account every time you top up the petty cash tin as that affirms you have 
accounted for everything and it is balanced. I talk more about bank reconcilia￾tions in Chapter 9.
FIGURE 6-8:

cash transaction

running a petty 
cash tin.CHAPTER 6 There Goes Your Cash! 153
GST — when petty cash gets pettier
If petty cash receipts don’t show GST separately, that doesn’t mean they’re GST￾free. A packet of staples for $2.20 includes 20 cents GST. And even if you feel that 
you’ve got better things to do than nit-pick tiny details, you still can’t afford to 
lose these valuable GST credits. Over time, it all adds up.
If petty cash is giving you grief and you’re spending too much time on it, just 
scrap it! Nobody said you had to have a petty cash tin, especially as the world con￾tinues to move towards operating cashless. Instead, save yourself hours of time by 
using a business credit or debit card to manage all day-to-day expenses and 
you’re covered, as if by a nice warm blanket.
PAYING FOR SET-UP EXPENSES 
FROM YOUR OWN POCKET
I often get asked how to record business set-up expenses that owners have paid for 
using their own funds before their businesses got off the ground or the business bank 
account was set up.
If you’re in this camp, talk to your accountant first, because you can’t always claim set￾up expenses as a tax deduction, especially if the money is spent too far in advance of 
the business getting established.
However, if your accountant tells you these expenses are claimable, you can record 
them by going to Create General Journal under the Accounting menu and recording a 
journal that debits the appropriate expense or asset accounts, and credits your Owner’s 
Drawings/Loan account. The petty cash example in Figure 6-7 provides a good example 
of how this journal might look.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 155
Chapter 7
Here Comes the Money
Even though I’ve been running my own business for years, I still feel a little 
ray of sunshine when customers pay me, whatever the fee. You will too, 
especially when you find out how easy it is to receive and record payments in 
your company file.
In this chapter, you discover that there are two ways of recording all the money 
coming into your business. If you’ve created a sales invoice, then it’s an exercise 
of matching money received from the customers against the invoices they’re pay￾ing. The second method is a quick allocation to an income account on the Bank 
Transactions page, where you record odd bits of income, such as bank interest, 
refunds or income from insurance claims.

This chapter also talks about finding out how much you’re owed, sending cus￾tomer statements and how to squeeze money out of the most reluctant of 
customers.
Seeing How Much You’re Owed
Keeping on top of how much you’re owed, and who owes you what, is one of the 
key ingredients to business success. If the money’s not coming in, how are you 
going to pay what you need to grow your business and generate more income?
You have three ways of seeing how much your customers owe you:
» A quick Dashboard overview: Go to the Dashboard and the Up Next area 
shows, among other things, how many overdue invoices you have, with a link 
to the list of invoices you need to chase up so you can action these next. The 
Your Business section of the Dashboard shows the total value of your income 
(for the period of time displayed), plus a chart highlighting how your income 
has been progressing over the past few months compared to last year. This 
nifty chart also separates out your Open Invoices (see Figure 7-1).
The Income chart in this useful section of the Dashboard defaults to show￾ing the last six months of income, but you can adjust the time frame by 
clicking the three dots to the top right of each chart here.
» The Unpaid Invoices report: This report provides a more detailed picture of 
who owes you money and how much. To view this report, go to Reporting →
Reports, head to the Sales tab and choose the Unpaid Invoices report. Click 
Expand All to view individual invoices owing, and click Collapse All to return to 
a single total per customer. This report is useful as it shows the age of each 
debt and how much you’re owed right now (hopefully there aren’t any 
invoices sitting in the 90+ days column!).
» The Receivables Reconciliation with Tax report: To find this report, go to 
Reporting → Reports, then move along to the Sales tab. For the purpose of 
chasing overdue accounts, the information on this report is much the same as 
the Unpaid Invoices report. However, two key features of the Receivables 
Reconciliation with Tax report are that it shows the tax value of your unpaid 
invoices, and it also calculates any discrepancy between the value of your 
open invoices and your receivables balance. These features are beneficial 
when you are reconciling your receivables account to your Balance Sheet at 
the end of each reporting period.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 157
Here are some tips for mining the useful detail from the Unpaid Invoices report 
and the Receivables Reconciliation with Tax report:
» Add handy information, such as customer phone numbers, average days 
to pay or original amount owing: When using the Unpaid Invoices report, 
click Customise and scroll down to the Select Columns to Display field. Click 
the drop-down arrow and you’ll find a whole bunch of additional information 
you can add to this report. (For example, phone numbers are handy when 
chasing overdue accounts, as is the Average Days to Pay field, with the latter 
indicating whether a customer is always a late payer or if this tardiness is a 
rare exception.) Select the columns you need and click Apply to add this 
information to your report; click Save As to store this customisation so you 
can view this info every time.
» Reveal old debtors: If you find that neither report includes amounts customers 
owed before you started using MYOB, it means you haven’t set up your customer 
opening balances yet. For the details on how to get started, turn to Chapter 3.
» Change your ageing method: The Unpaid Invoices report provides two ways 
to organise the ageing columns. Under the Ageing Method, you can choose to 
FIGURE 7-1:
The Dashboard 
provides a quick 
insight into how 
much customers 
owe you.158 PART 2 Everyday Activities
display invoices either by the number of days since the invoice date, or by the 
number of days overdue using invoice terms. Try both these options out and 
see what sits best with you.
If you find that invoices are showing as overdue when they aren’t, or vice 
versa, then your payment terms are probably set up incorrectly. You can 
fix these by going to the Payments tab in your Sales Settings (under the 
Settings menu).
» Look into the past: If you want to see how much customers owed you on a 
particular date that’s already passed (perhaps your accountant wants to see a 
receivables report for a previous month), just enter the date you need using 
the As At date field.
» Keep an eye on your Receivables Reconciliation: If you’re using the 
Receivables Reconciliation with Tax report, you have the added bonus of 
being able to keep an eye on your reconciliation balance as you go, monitor￾ing the Out of Balance Amount to ensure it remains at $0.00. Chapter 18 talks 
you through using this check to keep your file in tiptop shape.
Yippee! A Customer Has Paid Up
In the next few pages, I make a couple of assumptions:
» First, I assume that before you try to record a customer payment, you’ve 
already recorded a corresponding sales invoice. (You know, the whole 
cart-before-the-horse idea. Whoops, I mean horse-before-the-cart idea.) 
If you haven’t recorded any sales invoices yet, you may want to scoot back 
to Chapter 4.
» Second, I assume that you’ve already set up customer opening balances 
(if required), entering historical sales invoices for any amounts that were 
owing when you first set up your company file. If you haven’t set up customer 
opening balances yet, make your way back to Chapter 3.
Matching customer payments 
from bank feeds
In this next section, I explain how to record customer payments using bank feeds. 
However, if you don’t use bank feeds, or you sometimes need to generate receipts 
for customers on the spot, skip ahead to the section ‘Recording customer deposits 
from scratch’.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 159
Here’s how to record customer deposits from a bank feed:
1. Head to Banking → Bank Transactions. Select the bank account into 
which you receive customer deposits from the Bank Account drop-down 
menu to the top left.
2. Choose the date range during which you received the customer deposit 
you wish to record.
3. Find any unallocated customer deposits and click the drop-down arrow 
to the right of the transaction.
4. Head to the Match Transaction tab and filter to find the relevant 
transaction(s).
Use the Show filter to help you find exactly what you need. I always filter to 
Show All Transactions.
5. Select the customer from the Contact drop-down list or simply start to 
type the customer name in the Search field until it appears.
If you’re not sure who the deposit was from, use the invoice number in your 
search instead.
6. Select the relevant invoice or invoices.
Tick the checkbox to the left of all invoices that match to this payment. Your 
customer’s remittance advice may be a helpful reference to be sure you match 
the deposit correctly.
The oldest invoices are at the bottom of the invoices list; if the list is long, 
click the Date column heading to reverse the listing.
7. Check that the Out of Balance amount is $0.00.
If the balance is not $0.00, you may have mismatched something somewhere, 
so review and re-check the selected invoices. If the transaction still doesn’t 
balance, the customer may have overpaid or underpaid. I cover underpay￾ments and overpayments in the later sections ‘Dealing with underpayments’ 
and ‘Sorting out overpayments’.
Figure 7-2 below shows a full match through the Bank Transactions page.
8. Click Save.
Matching transactions like a pro
Getting the matching process correct is important. Errors can cause issues in 
other areas of your file, such as when reconciling, reporting for GST or chasing 
debtors. So, take your time to get this right and understand the workflow and 
match customer payments correctly.160 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Here are a few tips for matching customer deposits:
» If the deposit is from more than one customer (such as a daily EFTPOS 
deposit), you can still allocate multiple payments from a single transaction. 
See ‘Matching a deposit from multiple customers’ later in this chapter for 
more info.
» If it looks like something isn’t matching right and you have a feeling a cus￾tomer may have paid you twice for the same invoice, simply tick on Show 
Closed Invoices to view not just outstanding invoices, but also invoices that 
have already had payments matched against them.
» You have the option to add a Discount ($) amount via the Match Transaction 
tab here. For example, maybe you offered the customer a 5 per cent discount 
if they paid your invoice within seven days (who can refuse a discount!). 
Rather than messing about with the original invoice, simply apply the Discount 
($) amount here as you match the deposit.
» If a customer pays for just one invoice and there is a deposit for this exact 
amount in your Bank Transactions, MYOB suggests a Possible Match Found in 
the Allocate Me tab. Even if this suggestion is accurate, you still need to go 
ahead and match this transaction — MYOB won’t make the match automati￾cally for you.

» If you have bank feeds and you record payments using Create Invoice 
Payment via the Sales menu (perhaps a customer pays on the spot and needs 
an invoice showing the payment they made), then you still need to match this 
transaction. However, instead of matching the deposit to the sales invoice 
(which you can’t do, as the invoice is no longer open), you need to match the 
deposit to the payment you recorded.
Recording customer deposits from scratch
In this section, I explain how to record customer payments if you don’t use bank 
feeds, or if you need to generate receipts for customers on the spot. (If you do use 
THE LEGALITY ON CHASING DEBT
One thing about business that can be guaranteed is that at some point you will have a 
customer that doesn’t want to pay up, no matter how nice you are. Sadly, chasing up 
debt is an unenjoyable task for almost everyone. Often it is a mind game, with plenty of 
psychology behind it as you go far down the path of debt collection. My best piece of 
advice here is ‘prevention is better than cure’. So keep on top of following up invoices as 
soon as they are due and be super nice to all the accounts people you deal with 
because if they like you, they are more likely to pay you (a true fact, that!).
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) have published a guideline 
(Debt Collection Guideline for Collectors and Creditors, available at accc.gov.au/
publications/debt-collection-guideline-for-collectors-creditors) on 
what you can and can’t do when chasing debt. I highly recommend you have a read so 
you know where you stand, especially if you’re new to running a business. The guide￾lines cover how to contact debtors, how often, privacy disclosures around the debt, 
recordkeeping, working out payment arrangements and engaging formally with a debt 
collection agency — in other words, it’s a thrill of a read. (If you’re struggling to get to 
sleep one night, pull this out and I’m sure you’ll have dozed off by a couple of pages in.)
To avoid all this heartache, be on top of your game, consider very carefully who you’ll 
extend credit to and, when starting out, remember that COD (Cash on Delivery) is a very 
common term of payment, especially for one-off jobs. As your business grows, trade 
accounts may become inevitable, at which point you can manage debtors by sending 
out statements, sending invoice reminders and making polite follow-up calls, all of 
which become important workflows in your business. Hopefully, this will be all it takes 
to keep the money rolling in.162 PART 2 Everyday Activities
bank feeds, head back to ‘Matching customer payments from bank feeds’, earlier 
in this chapter.)
To record a customer payment from scratch:
1. Go to the Sales menu and select Create Invoice Payment.
The Record Payment from Customer page appears.
MYOB automatically allocates the next sequential Reference Number begin￾ning with CR (representing credit of payment) in the top-right field. You can 
add edit this reference if required; for example, you may like to indicate the 
payment method here to add more information (such as EFT or Visa) just for 
completeness, depending on how pedantic you are.
2. Enter the customer’s name in the Customer field and select the Date you 
received the payment.
3. Select the Bank Account that the payment was deposited into.
If this payment appears as a separate line on your bank statement (for 
example, a customer deposited funds directly into your bank account), simply 
choose the bank account into which you received the funds. However, if this 
payment is part of a batch of payments from several customers (such as a daily 
EFTPOS deposit), select the Undeposited Funds account.
For more on untangling payments into the Undeposited Funds account, see 
‘Grouping Customer Payments’, later in this chapter.
4. Add a Description — generally, I suggest using the customer’s name.
5. Find which invoice or invoices to allocate this payment to and check the 
checkbox to the left of the invoices that have been paid.
When you select the customer, all open invoices for that customer appear. The 
oldest invoices are at the bottom of the list; if the list is long, click the Date 
column heading to reverse the listing.
If a customer pays all outstanding invoices in one hit (don’t you just love that?), 
you can simply tick the top checkbox next to the Issue Date column heading, 
which applies the payment to all invoices shown, saving you time.
Many customers send remittance advices, enabling you to cross-check that the 
invoices they say they are paying are the same as the invoice you select when 
recording the payment.
If you’re wondering if the customer may have paid you twice for the same 
invoice, click Show Closed Invoices to see all invoices for this customer, 
including those you have previously marked as being paid.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 163
6. Check that the Total Amount Received value matches the value of the 
customer payment.
When you select an invoice, the Amount Received ($) is prefilled with the total 
value of the Balance Due ($). If customers overpay or underpay, you can 
change the value in the Amount Received ($) column. For more on underpay￾ments and overpayments, see the later sections ‘Dealing with underpayments’ 
and ‘Sorting out overpayments’.
7. Click Save.
To see a customer payment complete and ready to record, check out 
Figure 7-3.
Grouping Customer Payments
As the world moves to a more cashless society, you can expect to receive most 
customer deposits by EFTPOS, as direct deposits, or via online payment gateways 
such as PayPal and Stripe. If you receive multiple deposits through one of these 
channels on any one day, these will be deposited into your bank as one lump sum.
Assuming you invoice customers (and that you’re not a retailer simply issuing 
cash register receipts), you need to keep records of your payments to track exactly 
who paid what and when.
FIGURE 7-3:
Recording a 
customer 
payment through 
the Sales menu.164 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you receive payments against customer accounts via EFTPOS, you can track 
your payments by keeping a receipt spike nearby so when a customer pays, you 
can print a receipt copy for yourself and along the top write the invoice number 
that it relates to. Then, when the EFTPOS deposit appears in your bank feed, you 
can look back at these receipts and match the payments correctly.
Online payment gateways work in the same way, making one deposit per day for 
multiple customers, but the payment gateway records who paid you and when via 
their online platform. These platforms all work slightly differently, so you will 
need to investigate the one you’re using and find a way to track deposits that 
works for you.
In the following sections, I cover the two methods available for grouping these 
types of customer deposits. Depending on how your business works, you 
may favour one method over the other — or find that occasionally you need a little 
of both.
Matching a deposit from 
multiple customers
If you’re a retailer and you don’t raise individual invoices to each customer, then 
you don’t need to match daily deposits — this section only applies to deposits that 
you need to match against outstanding customer invoices.
Follow these steps to match a single bank deposit to more than one customer:
1. Locate the deposit arising from multiple customers.
Go to Banking → Bank Transactions and expand this deposit by clicking the 
drop-down arrow to the right of the transaction row.
2. Head to the Match Transaction tab and filter to Show All Transactions. 
Select the first customer from the Contact field.
3. Match all the paid invoices for your first customer.
Use the Contact filter to focus on the first customer, and match the transac￾tions by ticking the checkbox to the left of each relevant transaction.
Check the Subtotal is correct for this customer and if so, move on to the next 
customer; if not, then double-check what you’ve matched so far.
4. Select your second customer and match their paid invoices.
Use the Contact field to select your second customer. When you do so, you will 
see the Subtotal go back to $0.00 and the Out of Balance amount return to the CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 165
full amount (this is okay, because technically you haven’t applied any payments 
to this deposit yet). So go ahead and match up the correct invoices for this 
customer, again checking the Subtotal amount before you move on.
5. Continue until you have matched all customer invoices.
When you complete matching the last customer’s invoices, return the Contact 
filter to show All. You should see that the full balance has been applied and the 
Out of Balance amount is $0.00.
6. Click Save.
Sit back and enjoy a nice coffee and a biscuit having mastered that trickery.
This ability to match multiple customer payments from a single bank feed trans￾action is a feature unique to MYOB Business, and one that doesn’t exist in the 
desktop version of AccountRight. However, if you’re an AccountRight user and 
want to experiment with this feature, you can use AccountRight in the browser.
Using the Undeposited Funds account 
for matching multiple transactions
The idea of an Undeposited Funds account is that you record customer payments 
as individual transactions, depositing every payment into your Undeposited Funds 
account. Once you’ve recorded these payments, you create a bank deposit that 
transfers the total amount out of Undeposited Funds and into your bank account. 
In a perfect world, the balance of your Undeposited Funds account returns to zero, 
and the combined value of the customer payments shows up as a single amount in 
your bank account, ready to match with your bank feed.
I tend to use the Undeposited Funds account for clients who receive lots of cus￾tomer payments every day, and where these payments are combined into only one 
or two bank deposits. (The method I explain in the preceding section, for match￾ing a deposit from multiple customers, works well if you’re only receiving pay￾ments from three or four customers in a single deposit, but is too fiddly for any 
more customers than that.)
Here’s how the whole deal works:
1. Record your first customer payment using the method I describe earlier 
in this chapter, in the section ‘Recording customer payments from 
scratch’, but with the key difference that as your bank account, you 
select Undeposited Funds.
You can see what this payment might look like in Figure 7-4.166 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you don’t have an Undeposited Funds account in your Chart of Accounts, you 
can easily create one — be sure the Account Type is set to Bank and the Tax 
Code is N-T. If you need guidance on setting up accounts, turn to Chapter 2.
2. Repeat this process for each customer payment for that day.
For example, perhaps you received six customer payments via EFTPOS that 
day. Record each payment individually, selecting Undeposited Funds as the 
bank account each time.
3. Go to the Banking menu and select Receive Money.
Now what you’re getting ready to do is to transfer the total amount received 
out of Undeposited Funds.
4. Select which Bank Account you want to transfer the money into.
For example, if your EFTPOS deposits go into your business transaction 
account, select this account.
5. Enter the date of the deposit in the Date field.
Optional: You can also enter a note in the Description field at this point.
6. For the Account in the first column under the Description field, select the 
Undeposited Funds account.
7. Enter the total value of the deposit in the Amount field, leaving the Tax 
Code as N-T.
FIGURE 7-4:
Recording a 
customer invoice 
payment using 
the Undeposited 
Funds account.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 167
So, if you received five EFTPOS payments, each one of which was $200, and the 
total value of the EFTPOS settlement that day was $1,000, then you enter 
$1,000 as the amount. You can skip the Quantity and Description fields.
8. Click Record.
When you click Record, MYOB transfers the total from your Undeposited Funds 
account into your regular bank account. This amount hopefully then correlates 
with the deposit on your bank feed for that day.
9. If you’re using bank feeds, match the deposit transaction to the Receive 
Money transaction.
You need to match the deposit in the bank feed to the Receive Money transac￾tion you’ve created.
Once you get confident working with your Undeposited Funds account, you 
can actually skip steps 3–8 entirely. Instead of recording deposits in Receive 
Money and then matching them against your bank feed, you can simply work 
directly from your bank feed, allocating all customer payments batches to your 
Undeposited Funds account.
10. Check that the balance of your Undeposited Funds account has returned 
to $0.00.
The balance of your Undeposited Funds account should return to $0.00 after 
each deposit. To make sure that this is the case, go to Reconcile Accounts, 
enter Undeposited Funds as the Account, mark off all the withdrawals and 
deposits for that day, and check that the Closing Bank Statement Balance 
is $0.00.
Chapter 9 talks more about reconciling accounts.
Building Your Survival Kit
In today’s world, a survival kit is more about knowing how to deal with the stress 
and anxiety of dealing with the problems that arise. To survive in the harsh world 
of accounting software, you just need to arm yourself to know how to fix up mis￾takes: Your mistakes, your customers’ mistakes, your employees’ mistakes. And 
that’s what the next few pages are all about.
Following the customer payments trail
Some days have passed since you entered a customer payment, and now you want 
to take another look at this transaction. If you put five bookkeepers in a room, 168 PART 2 Everyday Activities
they would all have their own way to get to the pot of gold, so find the pathway 
that speaks best to you:
» Find the payment’s history via the customer: One of the best places to 
start is with the customer. Head to Sales → Invoices, select the customer from 
the Customer drop-down menu, and change the Status to Closed. Find the 
invoice against which you applied the payment, and click the Invoice No to 
display this invoice. Scroll to the bottom, where the Activity History displays 
payments received and payment dates. To view a particular payment, click the 
purple reference number next to Payment Received.
» Search the bank feeds: If you recorded this payment straight from a bank 
feed, jump into your bank transactions (Banking → Bank Transactions) and 
use the Search field to find the payment, using the customer’s name, the 
invoice number or the amount paid. The date filters may help to narrow/
widen your search. When you find the deposit, click the drop-down arrow to 
the far right to see how the payment has been allocated.
» Use Find Transactions: Go to Banking → Find Transactions and select the 
Transactions tab. Filter the Source Journal by selecting Cash Receipts and 
voilà, a list of all customer payments appears (including both invoice pay￾ments and Receive Money transactions). Search by name, invoice number or 
amount, and once found, click the purple reference number to open the 
payment. Couldn’t be easier!
Changing customer payments
To change a customer payment, first find the payment and click the reference 
number to open the payment. (Refer to the preceding section ‘Following the cus￾tomer payments trail’ if you’re not sure how.)
You can change the date and bank account of a customer payment transaction. 
However, if this payment is a bank feed match, such edits put you at risk of acci￾dentally doubling up the transaction. If you change certain fields, MYOB thinks 
you’re creating a different transaction to the bank feed transaction and will record 
the adjusted transaction, pushing the original transaction back to your bank 
transactions to be allocated again. So don’t risk it — delete the payment and cor￾rectly match the payment via the Bank Transactions page.
Deleting customer payments
You may want to delete a customer payment for a few reasons. Maybe you allo￾cated a payment to the wrong customer or entered a payment twice. (MYOB won’t CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 169
let you change the amount or customer name on customer payments; rather, you 
can only delete the payment and start again.)
Although I explain in these steps how to delete a customer payment, my explana￾tions come with a hefty warning. So read on, but do read carefully:
1. Find the customer payment and click the reference number to open the 
payment.
Refer to ‘Following the customer payments trail’ earlier in this chapter if you’re 
not sure how to locate this customer payment.
2. Consider if you have completed your bank reconciliation past the date of 
this payment.
Before you delete any transaction, consider if you have reconciled the bank 
past the date of the payment transaction. For example, if the payment 
transaction I wish to delete is dated 1 June but I have reconciled to 30 June, 
deleting the transaction will impact my reconciliation.
If you have reconciled your bank, just be aware that by deleting the transaction 
you are removing it from the completed bank reconciliation. If you’re using bank 
feeds, you will need to reallocate this payment from the Bank Transactions 
window; if you entered this payment manually, you’ll need to record it again. 
Either way, this payment will appear as unreconciled when you return to your 
bank reconciliation, which will need to be reconciled again as at that same date.
Chapter 9 covers bank reconciliation in case you want to familiarise yourself 
with this process first.
3. Scroll down to the bottom left of the payment and simply hit Delete.
In the blink of an eye, MYOB deletes the payment and closes the payment 
window. The deed is done.
MYOB Business does not have the option to reverse a payment but only to delete a 
payment (in case you are familiar with reversing payments in AccountRight).
Dealing with underpayments
Depending on the circumstances, you have five different methods of recording 
payments when a customer underpays:
» Employ water torture. Forget that Bill of Human Rights — just kidding!
» Raise a credit note and write off the difference. If the underpayment is 
relatively minor and you can’t be bothered chasing up the customer for the 170 PART 2 Everyday Activities
difference, the easy approach is to raise a credit note. For the full chapter and 
verse on credit notes, refer to Chapter 4.
» Leave the underpayment sitting on the customer’s account. If you record 
a customer payment and leave the shortfall as an amount owing on an 
invoice, this amount shows up on the customer’s next statement. Chances are 
that your customer will make up the shortfall next time they pay you.
» Change the invoice. Ahem. This method is a bit rough and ready and not 
what any auditor would recommend. However, if the shortfall is only a few 
cents, you can get away with opening the original invoice and changing the 
amount to balance back to $0.00.
» Use the Add Adjustment feature when matching the payment. This is a 
sneaky way to create a quick adjustment so everything balances (see the later 
section ‘Creating account adjustments on the fly’).
Sorting out overpayments
If a customer overpays by a few cents and you are matching via bank feeds, 
the swiftest solution is to use the Add Adjustment feature (see the later section 
‘Creating account adjustments on the fly’).
However, if a customer overpays by anything more than a few cents, don’t let 
temptation lure you in. There’s no point in grabbing the loot and running to the 
closest casino to find more lady luck. You’ll need to come clean and either (a) 
apply the credit against the customer’s account, or (b) send the customer a refund.
The option you choose here should be the customer’s decision too, so be sure to 
get in touch with them to notify them of the said overpayment and whether they 
prefer option (a) or (b).
Applying overpayments against a 
customer’s account
This method works well if a customer double-pays a specific invoice, or makes a 
payment for more than the total amount they owe you. Here’s how to create a 
credit and apply the overpayment against a customer’s account:
1. Go to record the customer payment in the way you normally would.
This could be by going to the Create Invoice Payment window, or this could be 
by matching a payment from your bank feeds.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 171
2. Decide which invoices to match or apply this payment against.
You can usually look at the remittance advice the customer has sent you in 
order to figure out which invoices the customer thinks they’re paying. If the 
customer hasn’t sent a remittance, you may wish to contact them to confirm 
what invoices they thought they were paying. Once you have matched the 
amount to all the correct invoices, the out of balance amount should display 
the value of the overpayment.
For this example, say the overpayment is $1,000.
3. Decide which invoice you want to apply the overpayment against.
If this is a double-payment, then apply the overpayment to the invoice the 
customer has paid twice. If this is a random overpayment with no rhyme or 
reason, select the most recent matched invoice.
In Figure 7-5, for example, you can see how I’ve added the overpayment 
amount of $1,000 to the last matched invoice amount of $55, meaning that 
I’m applying a payment of $1,055 against this invoice.
The Match Amount ($) field turns blue with an attached i icon indicating an 
information box (towards the left), which advises of the impending credit 
(see Figure 7-5).
FIGURE 7-5:
Applying 
overpayments to 
a customer’s 
account.172 PART 2 Everyday Activities
4. Click Save.
The credit of $1,000 is generated automatically; you can find this credit by 
going to Sales → Customer Returns. It will sit here against the customer’s 
account until you apply it to a future invoice.
If this customer has double-paid a particular invoice but has other invoices 
outstanding, you may prefer to apply this overpayment to those invoices, thus 
saving yourself the complexity of generating and applying credits. While this is 
perhaps the simplest approach, do check with your customer first, as they may 
not be aware of the overpayment, and may prefer for you to allocate this 
differently.
Sending a refund
In the next steps, I assume you’re sending a refund to a customer because they 
have a credit on their account. They may have a credit because they’ve overpaid 
(in which case, record the overpayment in the way I explain in the steps in the 
preceding section), or they may have a credit because you’ve issued them with an 
Adjustment Note, perhaps for returned or damaged goods.
Enough whys and wherefores, here’s what you gotta do:
1. Go to Sales → Customer Returns.
This opens the Sale Returns and Credits page.
2. Find the credit you want to refund and click Refund on the same line.
The Record Customer Credit as Refund page appears (see Figure 7-6 for an 
example).
3. Review the details of this transaction, such as the bank account and date.
Check the bank account selected is correct (this is the account you will be 
deducting the funds from to pay the refund) and also the date you will make 
the refund payment. I often choose to write a short novella in the Description 
field at this point, explaining why I’m issuing this refund.
4. Click Record.
Now all you have to do is actually pay the customer their refund through your 
internet banking.
If you realise you made an error recording the refund, don’t sweat it. Go to Find 
Transactions (in the Banking menu) and search the Cash Payments journal to 
locate the refund credit you’ve applied. You can delete the refund, which will 
push the credit back to the customer returns area for you to re-action.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 173
5. Look out for the withdrawal in the Bank Transactions page to match it.
If you’re using bank feeds, when you see the withdrawal appear in your bank 
transactions, you need to match this amount to the credit transaction that you 
just created.
Matching credits against debits
Have you ended up with credits sitting against a customer’s account? If they have 
invoices outstanding and you want to apply the credit against these invoices, 
here’s what to do:
1. Go to Sales → Customer Returns.
This opens the Sale Returns and Credits page. You should see the credit 
amount you created sitting here, pretty as a picture.
On the far right you have two possible actions — Record Refund or Apply 
to Sale.
2. Click Apply in the Apply to Sale column for the relevant credit.
As you are applying the credit to an invoice, choose Apply rather than Refund.
Once you select Apply, the Apply Customer Credit to Sale page appears, 
prefilled with the customer, the amount and all open invoices listed.
3. Select where you want to apply this credit (generally to the oldest 
invoices first) and hit Record.
FIGURE 7-6:

Creating account adjustments on the fly
If you’re using bank feeds, one nifty way to make adjustments to customer 
accounts is the Add Adjustment feature.
Imagine you’re in the middle of matching a customer payment from a bank feed 
and you find that the customer has overpaid by $0.05, similar to Figure 7-7. MYOB 
won’t let you record this transaction because it doesn’t balance.
To make a quick adjustment without resorting to raising a new customer invoice, 
here’s what to do:
1. Click the Add Adjustment button.
Missing in action? This little button appears just above the Subtotal (on the 
Match Transaction tab).
2. Select the account you want to allocate this amount to.
You’re usually best to simply select the same income account and tax code as 
the original sale.
3. Check the Out of Balance amount is now $0.00.
4. Click Save.
Here are some tips to help you along the way:
» This Add Adjustment feature is good for adjusting small amounts, such as 
when someone short-pays by a few cents, or there’s a minor adjustment to 
the amount charged. For large adjustments, refer to earlier sections in this 
chapter ‘Dealing with underpayments’ and ‘Sorting out overpayments’ instead.
» For underpayments, you’ll need to first type the exact amount of the total 
value of the last matched invoice in the Match Amount field. This will give you 
a negative out of balance amount, which you then adjust by typing a negative 
amount in the Add Adjustment field.
» If you find an entire invoice is missing (perhaps you issued a receipt but didn’t 
raise a sale, or perhaps a customer made a deposit into your account without 
requiring an invoice), you can use Add Adjustment to record this income 
without generating an invoice.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 175
Yee Haa! Someone Else Has 
Given You Money
Sometimes you receive money from sources other than your customers. Perhaps 
you receive a refund from Optus, the bank pays you some interest or the govern￾ment has been generous again with its apprentice rebates. Here’s how to record 
these kinds of transactions.
Recording money that’s 
not from customers
Okay, if you receive money that’s not a customer payment (that is, it’s got nothing 
to do with a sales invoice), you still want it, right?

Non-customer-related deposits come from lots of sources, including bank inter￾est, supplier refunds, insurance payouts, receipts of bank loans or tax refunds.
Enough of the chat, here’s what to do next:
1. From your bank transactions, find the deposit and click into the Allocate 
Me field.
Alternatively, if you’re not using bank feeds or you’re recording cash, go to the 
Banking menu and select Receive Money.
2. Select the relevant Account and Tax Code for the deposit.
For more about choosing accounts, see the next section, ‘Figuring out which 
account to pick’.
If you’re not using bank feeds, you also need to enter the date and the amount 
received at this point.
3. Optional: Fill in the Contact box and add a transaction description.
To add this information (completing the Contact field may be helpful for 
reporting later on), you need to click the drop-down arrow to the right of the 
transaction.
4. Click Save.
Or, if you’re recording a Receive Money transaction, click Record.
Figuring out which account to pick
When recording any kind of incoming payment that doesn’t come from a cus￾tomer, selecting the correct account can be confusing. But, never fear, Table 7-1 
provides a handy reference.
If you still don’t have the foggiest where to allocate a deposit, create a new expense 
account called ‘Queries to Code’, with the Tax code QUE (which I help you create 
in Chapter 16) and use this as your allocation account. Chapter 6 talks more about 
using query accounts.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 177

Sending Customer Statements
The older an account is, the less likely the customer will pay, making overdue 
monies so much harder to recover. So stay on their case and send every customer 
a statement as soon as their account falls due, making sure that before you do so, 
you’ve allocated all income received  — nothing upsets a customer more than 
receiving a statement for an invoice they paid a few weeks ago!
IS ALL INCOME THE SAME?
MYOB has two different kinds of income accounts:
• Regular income accounts that start with the number 4 and report the income you 
generate from conducting your business.
• Other income accounts that start with the number 8, and report all non-sales￾related monies received.
So why does this really matter? Isn’t income just income? Yes and no. The key reason 
why you want to separate business income from other income is so you can generate a 
meaningful Profit and Loss report. In MYOB, all your business income (the accounts 
that start with the number 4) sit at the top of your Profit and Loss report, followed by 
cost of sales accounts (which start with the number 5), followed by a line that calculates 
gross profit.
For many businesses, gross profit is a pivotal number that enables good business 
decisions, indicating the margin on goods or services and whether you’re selling at 
the right price. By excluding non-operating income from this calculation, you avoid 
distorting this figure.
Below gross profit, your Profit and Loss report displays expenses (accounts that start 
with the number 6), followed by your operating profit, or as some like to call it, the 
‘bottom line’. Operating profit is followed by Other Income (accounts that start with the 
number 8) and Other Expenses (which start with the number 9), to arrive at your final 
net profit figure.
In short: For good reporting and better insights, you do need to separate regular 
business trading income from other sources of income.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 179
Letting customers know 
how much they owe
Here’s how to send your customers a statement showing how much they owe:
1. Go to your Sales Settings (under the Settings menu), followed by the 
Email Defaults tab. Check the default Reply-to-Email Address, then scroll 
down to the Default Statement Email section to check the default Subject 
and Message.
Take care to add the correct reply email, as you want to give customers every 
chance to communicate.
The defaults you select here will appear on every statement you send, so 
ensure you’re happy with the wording. You can always change this message 
from time to time, maybe mentioning special offers, holiday closures or 
information about payment terms.
2. Go to the Sales menu and select Customer Statements from the drop￾down menu that appears.
The Customer Statements page appears.
3. Select the Statement Type.
You can choose between Invoice statements and Activity statements. I explain 
the difference between these two types in the next section.
4. Enter either a Statement Date (for Invoice statements) or From and To 
dates (for Activity statements).
If you choose a Statement Date for Invoice statements, you can tick the option 
to Only Include Invoices up to Statement Date. This works well if you’re already 
a few days into the month but you want to generate statements that include 
account activity up to the end of the previous month only.
5. Decide who you want to send a statement to and filter to All Customers 
or select particular customers if you want to send a statement to only 
some of your customers.
I tend to send this love letter to all customers at the end of the month (so no 
one gets jealous) and then mid-month, I send an additional round of state￾ments to any customers whose accounts are significantly overdue. To send to 
All, check the box to the left of the Customer name (the column heading at the 
very top); alternatively, select customer names one at a time as needed.180 PART 2 Everyday Activities
6. Check your statements are looking good.
If this is the first time you’re sending customer statements and you want to 
check what your customers will see when they receive a statement, click the 
Download PDF option, followed by the Print or Preview button. (Chapter 13 
talks more about customising statements, and other forms.)
7. Select your delivery option.
When you select a customer, two buttons appear at the top: Download PDF 
and Email. If you select Email, the email window appears, from where you can 
review your default email message and ensure the correct statement template 
has been selected. If you select Download PDF, you can select your statement 
template and download a PDF file, which you can later attach to an email or 
even print out.
Choosing your statement type
When you generate a customer statement, you can choose between an Activity 
statement and an Invoice statement.
Invoice statements are super straightforward — they simply list all invoices with 
any amounts outstanding. They don’t include any amounts that have already been 
fully paid.
On the other hand, an Activity statement shows all transactions on a customer’s 
account for any specified date range, starting with the opening balance outstand￾ing and then listing every single sale and payment.
I cringe when I receive an Activity statement as it looks so confusing. The only 
time using this statement is beneficial is if there’s a disparity between your 
records and the customers, as this shows them every transaction on the account, 
helping you both to identify problems and arrive at a point you can both agree on.
For a report that includes all customer transactions, including a running balance, 
your best bet is the Customer Transactions report, found under the Sales tab of 
your Reports menu — it works a treat!
Chasing Money
When you’re chasing up who owes you money, you truly see the benefits of 
MYOB’s growth into a business management platform. While accounting software 
helps you create, send and manage invoices, MYOB now builds on all the areas of CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 181
your income workflow and ultimately provides the tools to help improve 
cashflow — which is vital for any business.
Do take a look and try to adopt these game-changing tools in your business. In the 
last few pages in this chapter, I explain how to send invoice reminders and offer 
customers online payment options, all from within MYOB.  Finally, and most 
regrettably, I explain how to write off a bad debt.
Using invoice reminders
Want to get money in your pocket by doing the least amount of work? Then invoice 
reminders are what you’ve been looking for. They provide you with a gentle way 
to nudge your customers for payment of invoices without you even turning on 
your computer.
I used to spend hours each month resending invoices, reminders and statement 
copies to customers in an effort to get them to pay up. These days, all I need to do 
is switch on my invoice reminders, customise my frequency, choose my custom￾ers and let MYOB do its job.
Invoice reminders are quick and easy to set up:
1. Go to your Sales Settings (under the Settings menu).
2. Click on the Reminders tab, then click Reminders Settings.
The Reminders and Unpaid Invoice Summaries window appears.
3. Tick the Send Invoice Reminders checkbox to enable invoice reminders.
4. Choose which customers to remind.
You can remind all your customers or just those that are persistently late 
paying you. If you choose Send to Specific Customers, you need to adjust the 
invoice reminder setting for each Contact, one by one, and MYOB will send 
reminders to these customers.
5. Customise your invoice reminders.
You can set up to five different reminders, each one set up to send at a 
different time and with a different email message. You may choose to get a 
little pushier as time goes on to encourage your customers to pay up.
MYOB offers three suggested invoice reminders but you can add a couple 
more if you wish (simply click Add Reminder).182 PART 2 Everyday Activities
6. Click on the pencil icon to view and/or edit the default email message as 
required and click Save.
7. Close the window and the invoice reminders will take care of themselves.
For invoice reminders to be effective, you need to record customer payments every 
single day. If you don’t match payments daily, sooner or later customers will 
receive reminders for invoices they’ve already paid. Such reminders are likely to 
cause your customers stress and take up your time answering unnecessary queries.
Thank heavens for credit cards
Another strategy to help get money in from customers is to let them pay their bills 
on their credit card. You can set up Online Invoice Payments (OIP) from directly 
within MYOB. OIP is a secure payment service that gives your customers an easier 
and faster way to pay you. They can pay using Visa, Mastercard, Amex, BPAY, 
PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay (with Apple Pay and Google Pay, you get paid 
even faster).
A few facts about OIP:
» OIP is a merchant facility offered by the bank, so you betcha there’s a fee (no 
set-up costs, but a merchant fee of 1.8 per cent of the total invoice and a $0.25 
transaction fee). However, you can choose to pass the merchant fee on to the 
customer if you like.
The fees are pretty competitive but the bonus is you have no initial outlay for 
machines or readers. For me, the best bit is you also don’t have to spend time 
integrating with a different POS (Point Of Sale) system as OIP operates within 
MYOB Business.
You can’t pass on the merchant fee for customers choosing BPAY; however, if 
they pay immediately instead of after 30 days then this fee could be worth 
you paying, especially if you only switch it on as a payment option for your 
usual late payers.
» It takes around ten minutes to apply for OIP. You’ll find there are some checks 
and balances that MYOB and the bank need to do, but once you’re set up, OIP 
is as easy as pie to use.
To apply, you need to have the following to hand:
• Your ABN and business details.
• Proof of your identity, such as a driver’s licence or passport.
• Your bank details — that is, where you want the funds to be deposited.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 183
• Estimates of your total annual sales and a guess at the approximate 
number of OIP transactions per month.
» You can pick which customers you want to offer this payment option to and 
which ones the traditional bank transfer works fine for — you control the 
offering.
To set up OIP, head to your Sales Settings (under the Settings menu) and go to the 
Payments tab. At the bottom in the Online area, click Set Up Online Payments 
Options. This opens an information page with a short video and a link to some 
useful resources.
You can also access this link when you create an invoice — when you go to Sales →
Create Invoice, click Start Getting Paid Online (next to the online payments icons 
icons) to set up OIP.
When you’re ready, click the green Get Set Up button and you will be taken through 
the process of setting up OIP. When you’re finished, you’ll receive an email from 
MYOB letting you know your application has been received.
Once your application is approved, all new invoices you create will show the option 
(under the date block) to Allow Online Payments. Tick this checkbox if you want 
to give this particular customer the option to pay this way. A second checkbox 
(Apply Surcharge) gives you the option to pass on the merchant fee and apply the 
surcharge to the invoice.
Figure 7-8 shows these options and how you can control them.
If a customer pays via OIP, MYOB will automatically match this payment to the 
invoice as paid (meaning it will match the invoice payment to the bank feed and 
clear the payment from the Bank Transactions page) so that it will not be picked 
up through your invoice reminders (if you have them switched on). Invoice 
reminders and OIP work really well together, just like peanut butter and jelly.

.184 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Show no mercy — cut ’em off
If a customer won’t pay, cut ’em off. It’s as simple as that. They are not worth 
your time and energy and may end up costing you money in the long run. Cutting 
them off can mean moving them back to COD (so they need to pay up front before 
they receive your goods or services), or refusing to supply any more goods or 
services until their account is paid in full.
As your business grows, review your Unpaid Invoices or Receivable Reconciliation 
with Tax reports (Reporting → Reports → Sales) every single week to keep a close 
eye on who owes you what and when these amounts are due (refer to the earlier 
section ‘Seeing How Much You’re Owed’ for more on these reports).
Don’t wait until it’s too late and you’re already strapped for cash before you get on 
the phone and ask your customers to cough up. Have a system in place that becomes 
routine to manage your debtors. If your customers know you’re on the case, they’re 
more likely to pay you before others — you always want to be the squeaky wheel 
getting the oil (but in the nicest way, of course).
Know when it’s a dead end
You need to be both a fortune-teller and a pragmatist when chasing money; 
fortune-telling skills help you predict which customers may not pay, and prag￾matism helps you accept the fact that some customers, no matter how hard you 
try, are never going to cough up.
PAYING ONLINE WITH QR CODES
Customers can pay you online — even from a printed invoice. If you have OIP switched 
on and they have lost the email, or if you’ve download the invoice as a PDF before send￾ing it to them, they can still easily pay you via the QR code that is automatically added to 
the bottom of all invoices. Your customer needs to open the camera on their smart￾phone and focus on the QR code, and a pop-up or link will appear that takes them 
directly to your invoice. They then simply click Pay Now and ta-da! All done.
If you don’t have OIP switched on, the QR code still appears just to let customers view 
your invoice online so they can pay via bank transfer. This is great because if the client 
can’t remember if they’ve paid or not, they can scan the QR code and view the invoice 
online to see if it is still outstanding.CHAPTER 7 Here Comes the Money 185
So, in the name of pragmatism, here’s how to write off a bad debt:
1. Go to the Sales menu and click Create Invoice.
2. Enter the customer’s name (who has the bad debt) then enter the 
original invoice number, adding BD (Bad Debt) before the number to 
ensure a link between the original invoice and the resulting bad debt.
3. Optional: If you use the Services and Items layout, change the invoice 
layout to Services by clicking the cog wheel to the far right.
This change makes the bad debt write-off process easier because you only 
need to add one description and enter one total amount.
4. In the Description, write a short story about the bad debt and why you’re 
writing it off (for anyone looking in).
5. As the allocation account, select the Bad Debt Expense account.
If you don’t already have an expense account by this name, create one now. 
Turn to Chapter 2 to remind you how.
6. Enter the amount you’re writing off as a negative figure and make sure 
the amount of GST comes up correctly to match the original invoice.
Check the Invoice Total is the same as the original. If GST was included on the 
original invoice, make sure that GST is on the bad debt invoice also.
7. Click Save.
A Save Invoice? pop-up appears advising that you will be creating a customer 
credit as the invoice is negative, which is what you want, so hit Save again.
Your bad debt invoice should look like the example in Figure 7-9.
8. Go to the Sales menu → Customer Returns.
9. To apply this credit to the original debt and record the bad debt as an 
expense, locate the credit (the invoice number starting with BD) you just 
created and click Apply in the Apply to Sale column.
The Apply Customer Credit to Sale page appears, prefilled with the customer, 
the amount and all open invoices listed.
10. Apply this credit against the outstanding debt in the same way you would 
apply a payment, and then click Record.186 PART 2 Everyday Activities
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT GATEWAYS
As a consumer, you’re sure to have used an alternative payment gateway at some point 
(for example, Afterpay and Square). These are Alternative ways for businesses to get 
paid faster, more easily and more securely. In today’s world, with the move towards 
being cashless (accelerated by COVID), you can expect to see more of these options 
appear.
If your specific business needs are not met by the use of OIP (for example, if you have a 
subscription-based business like a gym), an Alternative payment gateway may help you 
with creating direct debits and collecting fees. Many of these gateways encourage pay￾ments in advance, which is a great way to trade if you can.
If you haven’t encountered these gateways yet, take a look around and do some 
research on the cost, functionality and usability for your business. Your accountant, 
bookkeeper or industry colleagues may also have some recommendations. To find out 
which payment apps integrate with MYOB and may best fit your business, click your 
business name and select App Marketplace.

Chapter 8
Purchases and 
Supplier Payments
Many people new to running a business take a while to realise how impor￾tant their suppliers are. Instead, they focus on building relationships 
with their customers. But the truth of the matter is this — suppliers are 
as important as customers, because without suppliers you wouldn’t have any 
goods to sell.
A supplier needs to know what you want, when you want it and where you want it. 
They need to know when you’ll pay them, and how. And guess what? In this 
chapter, I show you how MYOB helps with all these things, and more.

Deciding Whether You Need to 
Read This Chapter
Before plunging headlong into this chapter, pause for a moment, as this is an area 
many new MYOB users waste their precious time on unnecessarily. Ask yourself, 
do you actually need to record purchase orders or supplier bills? Maybe not. Prob￾ably half of all small businesses using MYOB don’t really need to record purchase 
orders or supplier bills — and they get the same reporting results.
Assuming you don’t require inventory management, recording bills as purchases 
(rather than simply recording them as expenses when you pay for them) is a 
choice. You may find that using purchases is more trouble than it’s worth, partic￾ularly if you don’t buy many goods or services on credit. In this case, you can skip 
this chapter (yee-haw!) and keep things simple by allocating all expenses straight 
to an account from your bank feeds.
On the other hand, you may find that using purchases offers the following 
benefits:
» At the click of a button, you can see exactly how much you owe suppliers at 
any point in time.
» You can see what bills you have to pay when, and plan your cash flow better.
CLAIMING GST ON UNPAID SUPPLIER BILLS
When you first register for GST, you have to choose whether to report for GST on a cash 
or an accruals basis (refer to the ATO to determine which basis is applicable to your 
business). If you choose to report for GST on an accruals basis, you need to account for 
GST on all outstanding supplier bills, not just the ones you’ve already paid.
This means that if you want to produce a report that claims all the GST credits due on 
supplier bills (both the ones you’ve paid and the ones you haven’t yet paid), you need to 
record these as bills in your accounts. To do this, you use the Purchases menu.
Most retailers fall into this category. Because they own shops, almost all their sales are 
cash, but the stock they purchase is almost always on account. (That’s why it’s good for 
them to report on an accruals basis.) To claim all the GST credits as soon as possible, 
they record all supplier bills as Purchases in their accounts.
Clear as mud? For more on this fascinating topic, make your way to Chapter 16.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 189
» When payment is due to suppliers, processing payments can be quick, easy 
and efficient.
» If you report your Business Activity Statement (BAS) on an accruals basis, you 
can claim GST on bills that you’ve received but haven’t paid for yet. For more 
on this, see the nearby sidebar ‘Claiming GST on unpaid supplier bills’.
If you’re not sure whether to enter supplier bills as purchases, you’re probably 
best to start by keeping things simple, allocating transactions directly from your 
bank feeds to start with. Then, once you’re more confident in MYOB, you can 
always return to this chapter and experiment with recording purchases and sup￾plier payments in a more detailed way.
Creating Purchase Orders
Want to know how to create purchase orders to send to suppliers? The next couple 
of pages in this chapter explain just how.
Ordering up big time
Here’s how you create a purchase order:
1. Go to Purchases → Create Purchase Order.
Easy peasy.
2. Fill in the supplier’s name and check the Report to ATO via TPAR check￾box if required.
Start typing the name of your supplier in the Supplier field or click the drop￾down arrow to select from your supplier contacts. If this supplier isn’t in MYOB 
yet, type their name and click Create Supplier. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on 
adding new contacts.)
If you’re unsure whether you need to check the Report to ATO via TPAR 
checkbox, skip ahead to ‘Hitting up the ATO with TPAR’ later in this chapter.
3. Confirm your Shipping Address (where you want the goods to be deliv￾ered) is correct.
MYOB picks up your shipping address from the information in the Contact 
details saved in the Business Settings section (under the Settings menu), but 
you can edit this here if needed.190 PART 2 Everyday Activities
4. Check the Purchase Order Number and the Issue Date.
Unless you have a different kind of numbering system, go with whatever 
Purchase Order Number comes up (the number automatically increases by 
one with every new purchase order).
If you want to look like you’ve been trading for a while, start with a high 
number (such as 1,000) for your first purchase order.
The Supplier Invoice Number field can remain blank for now, and the Issue 
Date is normally just the current date.
5. Select Tax Inclusive or Tax Exclusive.
If you have a price list or a quote from your supplier, follow their lead; gener￾ally, suppliers provide tax-exclusive prices, so align with what they provide.
6. Click the Layout button (the purple cog wheel, just above the Tax Code 
column on the right) and select the appropriate purchase order layout.
Depending on how you trade, a simple Services layout may suffice. If you are 
buying and selling goods in quantities or using the Inventory module to track 
your stock, then you will need to use the Services and Items layout.
7. Enter the details of the items and/or services you are ordering.
If you’re ordering services, enter a Description and the appropriate Account. 
For example, if you’re creating a purchase order for stationery supplies, enter 
‘Stationery Expense’ as the account.
If you’re ordering items, select the first item from the drop-down Item ID list.
Assuming your items are set up correctly, MYOB prefills most of the item line 
details for you. Think carefully about how you set up Item IDs, as it may make 
sense to use your suppliers’ item codes here, rather than your own, so they 
send you the correct items. (I cover setting up items in detail in Chapter 10.)
8. Enter the quantities you require in the No of Units column and check the 
Unit Price for each item.
Hopefully, you’re using a current price list from your supplier, so the prices will 
be correct.
Once you get into the swing of purchase orders, you can finetune the restock￾ing information for your items so that MYOB can not only generate purchase 
orders automatically from your Reorder Report, but can also prefill recom￾mended reorder quantities. Chapter 10 explains more about this feature.
9. Add freight costs in the Freight ($) field if required.
If this is the first time you’ve added freight to a bill or purchase order, a 
hyperlink labelled Set Up Freight Account appears next to the Freight field. 
Click this link, select Freight Expense, and click Save. (If an account called CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 191
‘Freight Expense’ doesn’t exist, head to your Chart of Accounts to create 
this first.)
10. Add any helpful information in the Notes field.
The Notes field is a great place to add any other information you need the 
supplier to know.
11. Click View PDF and then Export to review your purchase order.
MYOB saves a PDF of your purchase order in your Downloads folder.
12. If all looks good to go, click Email Purchase Order to send your purchase 
order to your supplier.
Figure 8-1 shows a complete purchase order. (You may be interested to note 
that at the time of writing, in my example, it is truffle season and demand is 
high as are the prices . . . but what’s wrong with a little indulgence?)
Giving your purchase order a makeover
When you print or email a purchase order, MYOB uses your default invoice tem￾plate to generate the file. As a result, customising the layout of your purchase 
orders is limited to adding a logo and some colour.
FIGURE 8-1:
A typical 
purchase order.192 PART 2 Everyday Activities
If you do want to create a different template for your purchase orders, you can do 
so by creating a new invoice template specifically for purchase orders. Create a 
new template via your Sales Settings (under the Settings menu) and name the 
template Purchase Order, then choose this new Purchase Order template when 
you send your purchase order (see the next section).
Refer to Chapter 1 for more on setting and adjusting your invoice templates.
Sending purchase orders
To send your purchase order to your suppliers:
1. Go to Purchases → Purchase Orders and click on the saved purchase 
order number in the PO Number column.
The purchase order opens.
2. Towards the bottom of the page, click Email Purchase Order.
The Email Purchase Order window opens.
3. Check the supplier’s email address and default message, and change the 
message if required.
If you want to change the default message that appears, simply visit the 
Purchases Settings (under the Settings menu). Click the Email Defaults tab 
and amend the Default Purchase Order Email as required.
4. Attach any other documents if required.
The file size limit is 25MB, which is usually far more than you need.
5. Select your purchase order template.
The default template that appears is the same as your default invoice tem￾plate. If you’re not happy with this format, refer to the preceding section, 
‘Giving your purchase order a makeover’.
6. When you are happy that your purchase order is ready to send, click the 
Send Purchase Order button.
The first time you email a purchase order from MYOB, send a test email to 
yourself first (simply enter your own email address instead of the supplier’s 
address when emailing the test purchase order). Alternatively, click the View 
PDF button (next to the Email Purchase Order button) before you email or 
record the order.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 193
Placing supplier deposits against 
purchase orders
A supplier deposit is a payment in advance for goods and services that you haven’t 
been billed for yet. You record supplier deposits by first entering a purchase order 
in MYOB, and then recording a payment against it.
Before using the supplier deposits feature, you need to set up the option to do so. 
Go to Accounting → Manage Linked Accounts and click the Purchases tab. Tick the 
option I Track Deposits Paid to Suppliers and select the asset account for Supplier 
Deposits from the drop-down menu (if you don’t have one, create a suitable 
account — Chapter 2 can guide you here).
Note that when you apply a supplier deposit payment against a purchase order, 
MYOB treats this a little differently to other supplier payments. Supplier deposits 
are posted to an asset account (generally called Deposits to Suppliers). When you 
later convert the purchase order to a bill, this deposit is then automatically moved 
to your Accounts Payable account and the payment applied to your invoice.
Recording Supplier Bills
In this section, I explain how to record supplier bills for both items and services. 
I also explain how to convert a purchase order to a bill, check supplier ABNs and 
ensure you pick the correct tax codes.
Receiving bills for items
Here, I explain how to record a supplier bill for items (for all other supplier bills, 
see the next section):
1. From the Purchases menu, select Create Bill.
The Create Bill page appears.
2. Enter the Supplier name and check the supplier’s ABN status.
Begin typing the supplier’s name in the field or click the drop-down arrow to 
select the supplier from your supplier list. Once selected, the supplier’s ABN 
status will appear underneath the Supplier field, enabling you to check at a 
glance the status and validity of the supplier’s ABN.
See ‘Checking supplier ABNs’, later in this chapter, for more about ABN 
status checks.194 PART 2 Everyday Activities
3. Check if any open purchase orders exist for this supplier, and if a pur￾chase order already exists for this bill, then select this transaction and 
click Convert.
Just to the right of the supplier’s ABN status, MYOB notifies you if you have any 
open purchase orders for this supplier. (If you don’t have any open purchase 
orders, continue to Step 4.)
To view and convert an existing purchase order to an invoice, simply click Open 
Purchase Orders and a window appears with all the open purchase orders for 
the selected supplier. Select the purchase order you wish to convert and click 
Convert. From here, you can follow the rest of these steps with the advantage 
that most fields will be prefilled based on the data in the converted purchase 
order.
4. Check the Report to ATO via TPAR checkbox if required.
If your industry requires you to report TPAR, tick the option so this bill flows 
through to your TPAR reporting for the end of the year. Turn to the section 
‘Hitting up the ATO with TPAR’ to find out more.
5. Enter the Supplier Invoice Number and check the Issue Date.
Add the invoice number from your supplier’s invoice — you can find this on the 
tax invoice received from your supplier. As the Issue Date, enter the date as 
per your supplier’s invoice (not the date that you’re entering this transaction).
You’ll also see MYOB autogenerates a Bill Number, which you can generally 
just ignore. However, if you’ve created this bill by converting a purchase order, 
you may want to use this field to record the original purchase order number.
6. Enter the correct Due Date as per your supplier terms.
The correct Due Date helps ensure you pay your bills in good time. To change 
the Due Date, click on the date field and use the pop-up that appears to 
adjust the terms.
7. Select if the amounts are Tax Inclusive or Tax Exclusive.
You may need to use different GST options depending on your supplier — 
refer to their tax invoice so you can follow suit rather than doing your own 
calculations.
8. Click the purple cog wheel to ensure the field layout is set to Services 
and Items.
As you become more familiar with this process, you will start to recognise the 
difference between the Services layout and the Services and Items layout.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 195
9. Select your first Item ID and check all the prefilled line fields that 
populate.
If you have converted this bill from a purchase order, the Item IDs and all line 
details will already be complete, so you just need to check these details match 
the invoice and adjust if required.
Chapter 10 covers creating items, if you don’t already have these set up.
10. Add the rest of your items in the Item ID column, row by row, until you 
have entered all the line items from the supplier’s invoice.
All the line item details should prefill.
11. Enter item quantities in the No of Units column and double-check the 
Unit Price.
After you select the Item ID, MYOB populates the quantity with one unit only, 
so you may need to adjust to the correct number of units.
It’s also a good idea to check the prefilled unit price matches the current price 
from your supplier’s invoice, which you can also adjust as needed.
Your bill should now look very similar to Figure 8-2.
MYOB Business doesn’t have backorder features. For example, imagine you 
ordered ten items but only received eight. When converting the purchase 
order to a bill, you would need to edit the quantity to show only eight items 
were received. That’s fine, but MYOB won’t track the outstanding items that 
you’ve not yet received, and this information will be lost from your original 
purchase order. You may want to consider creating a new purchase order for 
the items not yet received, so you can follow this process again once the 
remaining goods are received.
12. Optional: Enter a discount amount (as a percentage) and a Job if 
applicable.
If the supplier offered you a discount, you can add that here. If you are tracking 
job costings using the Job function, go ahead and select the relevant Job from 
your drop-down list (Chapter 17 covers the Job function in more detail).
13. Add a cost for freight if required.
If this is the first time you’ve added freight to a bill, a hyperlink labelled ‘Set up 
freight account’ appears next to the Freight field. Click this link, select Freight 
Expense, and click Save. (If an account called Freight Expense doesn’t exist, 
head to your Chart of Accounts to create this first.)
14. Check the Tax and Total amounts match the supplier’s invoice.196 PART 2 Everyday Activities
15. Click the green Save button.
Great job!
If you have another bill to enter, you can choose Save and Create New from 
the drop-down options on the button to the left of the green Save button to 
speed things up a little.
Recording bills for services
Most businesses receive lots of different kinds of bills, not just bills for items. In 
fact, your business may not buy, sell or track items at all. So, what do you do if you 
get a bill for something like marketing, consultancy fees or cleaning?
The simple answer is you simply change the field layout to Services — here, you 
write a description of what you purchased and do away with adding the amount as 
a price per unit, instead entering one total amount.
These kinds of purchases are super-easy to record, so here I give you a quick run￾down on what’s important:
FIGURE 8-2:
Creating a Bill 
from your 
supplier’s tax 
invoice using the 
Services and 
Items layout.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 197
1. Follow Steps 1 to 7 in the preceding section (‘Receiving bills for items’).
2. Click the purple cog wheel to ensure the field layout is set to Services.
3. Complete the Description field for the first service item.
You can often just leave this field blank, but if you want to add a detailed 
description of the service provided, this is the spot to add it.
If you use the In Tray feature, you will attach the original invoice to the 
transaction, meaning that it’s fine to leave description fields either blank or 
with the bare minimum. Turn to the later section ‘Using the In Tray’ for more 
on this useful tool.
4. Select the account you wish to allocate this expense to.
If there is no suitable account, turn to Chapter 2 for help with creating a new 
account.
If you want a particular expense account to appear every time you record a bill 
from this supplier without you having to search for it, you can add the expense 
account to the supplier’s Contact — simply go to Contacts → All Contacts, find 
the supplier Contact and add the Expense Account in the Details section. (You 
can also add this detail when setting up new supplier contacts.)
5. Enter the total value of this service in the Amount ($) field.
6. Optional: Enter a Job.
Jobs are great if you want to track profit and job costings on work you do 
around particular jobs or projects. Chapter 17 has the lowdown on Jobs.
7. If you want to split this bill across more than one expense, add more 
lines.
If the whole bill belongs to one expense account, you’re usually quickest and 
easiest to just enter this as a single line and a single amount, even if the 
supplier bill itself is very detailed (maybe there’s a list of multiple services, all on 
different dates). You can attach the supplier bill to the transaction in MYOB as 
a reference if needed.
8. Optional: Upload the supplier bill to the transaction.
You’ll find there are two ways of attaching a copy of the original supplier 
invoice to MYOB transactions: The first way is to use the In Tray feature (see 
‘Using the In Tray’ later in this chapter); the second is to simply click the 
Attachments section at the bottom of the bill to upload a PDF.
9. Check the GST and Total amounts are correct and click Save.
By now, your Services bill should look similar to Figure 8-3.198 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Checking supplier ABNs
In theory, whenever you receive a tax invoice, especially if this is the first time 
you’ve dealt with a particular supplier, you should double-check that their ABN is 
valid and connected to that supplier. The ATO puts the onus on the business owner 
to check all supplier ABNs, and if you have an invalid tax invoice because you 
haven’t made these checks, you can’t claim the deduction for tax purposes. For 
any business, checking supplier ABNs is an important part of compliance.
The good news is MYOB checks supplier ABNs every time you add a new 
supplier, and from then on displays the current ABN status whenever you record 
supplier transactions. A green tick confirms the ABN status is in order; an orange 
warning triangle indicates the ABN has been cancelled; a red warning diamond 
indicates the ABN is invalid, or that an ABN has not yet been recorded. Both 
warnings require your attention.
The gold here is you can click on the green, orange or red icons to see more details 
about an entity’s ABN status, GST registration, business name and structure. This 
information is particularly useful when suppliers have different trading names 
and company names.
FIGURE 8-3:
A typical 
services bill.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 199
If a supplier fails to supply you with a valid ABN and their invoice is for more than 
$75, you’re obliged to withhold 48.5 per cent tax from the supplier’s payment and 
report this payment separately on your BAS. Such shenanigans are usually more 
trouble than they’re worth, so it’s easier to deal only with suppliers who have a 
legitimate ABN, or who can supply you with a Statement by a Supplier form.
Calculating GST correctly
Here are some pointers on selecting the correct tax code and calculating GST cor￾rectly for supplier bills:
» Buying goods or services for your own private use. Pick N-T as 
your tax code.
» Changing the way your Amount ($) and Subtotal amounts display to 
account for GST. Sometimes a supplier provides an invoice or receipt that 
displays a tax-inclusive amount. If this happens, all you have to do is select 
the Tax Inclusive box when creating the bill. Then, simply copy and enter the 
tax-inclusive amount in the Amount ($) column and voilà, you should see 
your Subtotal, Tax and Total amounts all calculate correctly.
» Coding transactions when you’re not registered for GST. In this situation, 
you should change the default tax codes in your Chart of Accounts so that 
they all have the N-T tax code.
If you’re not registered for GST, and regardless of whether your suppliers 
charge GST, you must use the tax code N-T for all supplier bills.
Turn to Chapter 2 for guidance on bulk editing tax codes if needed.
» Dealing with rounding problems. Occasionally, MYOB calculates the amount 
of GST on a purchase slightly differently to your supplier and the GST total 
differs by a cent or two. Don’t tear your hair out wondering why this is 
(although I can tell you now that it’s due to the way different software 
packages deal with rounding cents up and down). Instead, be pragmatic and 
ignore the difference. After all, two cents doesn’t mean much in the grand 
scheme of things.
» Getting the correct code to come up automatically. When entering bills 
for services, if you find that the tax code comes up incorrectly each time, 
you need to fix the tax code for this expense in your Chart of Accounts.
» Trading with someone who isn’t registered for GST. Select FRE as the 
tax code.200 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Using the In Tray
MYOB’s In Tray provides the ideal spot to collect digital copies of all your bills, 
receipts and remittance advices, linking each document to the relevant transac￾tion in your company file. Even better, the In Tray uses smart technology to scan 
supplier bills, prefilling most information so that entering bills manually becomes 
a thing of the past.
In the next few sections, I explain how to get supplier bills or receipts into your In 
Tray, and what to do with these documents once they’re there. You may find the 
whole deal a little nerdy, but it won’t take long before you’re hooked.
Getting documents into your In Tray
The easiest way to understand how the In Tray works is to jump in and add a few 
bills and receipts. To do this, simply click the In Tray menu. The In Tray page 
looks a little bare the first time you head there, but makes more sense once you 
start adding documents.
You can add documents to your In Tray using a few different methods, each one of 
which I explain in Table 8-1. Most people end up using a mix of methods, depend￾ing on their business and how they receive bills from suppliers.
TABLE 8-1	 Getting Documents into Your In Tray
The Method What To Do When To Use This Method
Upload files by selecting 
them yourself
Organise the open windows on your computer 
so you can see both the file you want to add as

that you receive by email.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 201
Working through your In Tray
So, now that you’ve got lots of documents in your In Tray, what comes next? In 
Table 8-2, I explain how to work through your In Tray. Note: Often, it makes more 
sense to close the In Tray menu and work from the Bank Transactions menu 
instead, linking documents from the In Tray as you allocate or match each trans￾action. I tend to keep both pages open in my browser for easy linking (to open 
MYOB in a new tab, right-click on a menu item and select Open Link in New Tab).
With two active browser tabs, you can view the In Tray’s list of documents and 
take note of the first document’s dollar amount in the Total Amount ($) column, 
then go to the Bank Transactions page and search for this same dollar amount to 
isolate the matching transaction (assuming the invoice has already been paid and 
has appeared in your bank transactions via your bank feed). If the date and 
description match the document in the In Tray, you can go ahead and link the 
document to the transaction.
Document attachments remain in your MYOB file for as long as you have a valid 
subscription; however, sometimes you may need to keep multiple copies of key 
documents for warranty or other recordkeeping purposes.
The Method What To Do When To Use This Method
Capture documents 
using your smartphone
Install the MYOB Capture app on your smart￾phone. Take a photo of the invoice or receipt, 
crop the photo to remove unwanted back￾grounds and click Send.
You can also use the Add Note feature (on the 
bottom left just before you click Send) to note 
handy details, such as which bank account the 
bill was paid from, or who may need reimburse￾ment. This note will be visible once you create a 
transaction from the document.
Ideal for printed receipts paid 
for by EFTPOS, such as petrol, 
office supplies or incidental 
purchases.
Use automated supplier 
receipts
Link key suppliers such as Bunnings or Office￾works with your MYOB account to receive bills 
with all data prefilled straight into your In Tray. 
Click More Ways to Upload, followed by All Part￾ners and How to Connect to configure this 
feature.
Currently only available from 
a handful of large Australian 
companies, this feature works 
well if you deal with one of 
these companies on a regular 
basis.202 PART 2 Everyday Activities
TABLE 8-2	 Different Methods for Working through Your In Tray
The Method What To Do When To Use This Method
Link to an existing bill Click the three dots to the right of the sup￾plier invoice or receipt and select Link to 
Existing Bill. Scroll through the list, click the 
checkbox to the left of the relevant bill, and 
select Link.
This will attach the document to the transac￾tion in MYOB and remove the document 
from the In Tray.
If you have problems finding the relevant bill, 
try clicking the Amount column to sort by 
amount. Alternatively, if the bill has already 
been paid, click Show Paid Bills and Returns.
Use this method if you have 
already recorded the bill in 
MYOB.
Create a new bill Click the three dots to the right of the sup￾plier invoice or receipt and select Create Bill.
MYOB should prefill most data for you, but 
your job now is to add or edit any missing or 
incorrect information. The main thing to 
know here is that if you click the Close Split 
View option, you’ll be able to edit data or 
change bill layouts. Once you have everything 
spot on, click Save.
If the bill doesn’t prefill as well as you expect, 
skip ahead to the section ‘Persuading your In 
Tray to play nice’.
Go to the start of this chapter 
and read the section ‘Deciding 
Whether You Need to Read This 
Chapter’ for a summary of all 
the reasons you may want to 
enter bills into MYOB.
Create a new Spend 
Money transaction
Click the three dots to the right of the sup￾plier invoice or receipt and select Create 
Spend Money Transaction.
Similar to creating a new bill, MYOB prefills 
most data for you, and your job is to add or 
edit any missing or incorrect information. Do 
pay particular attention that the correct bank 
account is selected, and once this detail and 
all others are correct, click Record.
This method works best for 
petty cash expenses or for bills 
paid from bank accounts that 
aren’t connected via bank feeds.
Attach documents 
directly to bank 
transactions
The idea here is that you access the docu￾ments that are sitting in the In Tray directly 
from the Bank Transactions menu, rather 
than from the In Tray itself. See ‘Linking In 
Tray documents to bank transactions’ next in 
this chapter for more details.
This is the best method for most

This is the best approach if you 
accidentally double-up on add￾ing a document to your In Tray.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 203
Linking In Tray documents to 
bank transactions
As I explain in the previous section, the best way to work with the In Tray is often 
to link documents directly to your bank feed transactions. Here’s how to dance 
this particular polka:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions.
2. Locate the transaction you want to link to a document, and click the 
drop-down arrow to expand the transaction.
The transaction expands to show the transaction details.
3. Click Link from In Tray at the bottom left.
The Link Source Document from In Tray window appears, with a list of all 
documents currently sitting in the In Tray. MYOB will try to find the closest 
match and offer you this document at the top of the list; if this isn’t the one 
you’re looking for, you can use the Search field in the top left, or you can click 
any of the column headings to sort by Invoice No, Issue Date or Amount.
4. Click the radio button to the left of the document that you want and 
click Link.
Figure 8-4 shows a bank transaction with attached document files.
You can attach multiple documents to a transaction; however, you will need to 
do so one at a time. Alternatively, if you realise that the document isn’t in your In 
Tray but is saved somewhere else on your computer, click Cancel and then click 
Attach Files instead (you can attach multiple files at once using Attach Files).
FIGURE 8-4:
Attaching 
documents 
directly to a bank 
transaction.204 PART 2 Everyday Activities
5. Click Save.
This document will now be attached to the bank transaction and removed 
from your In Tray. When viewed from the Bank Transactions menu, a paperclip 
icon will now appear next to the Tax column, indicating that a document has 
been attached.
All the actions covered so far in this section are also available to AccountRight 
users by accessing your file via a browser. You can then link documents directly to 
your bank transactions without having to create Spend Money transactions first, 
and you can link documents to both withdrawal and deposit transactions. To make 
the most of these great features, experiment with using AccountRight in the 
browser when working with your In Tray.
Persuading your In Tray to play nice
Getting your In Tray to run smoothly can take a little bit of effort at first.
Here are some tips that may help you along the way:
» If you make a mistake and attach the wrong file to a transaction, don’t worry. 
Simply edit the transaction and click the ‘x’ to the right of the linked file to 
remove it from the transaction. If this file originated from your In Tray, MYOB 
will pop it back there, ready for you to attach correctly.
» If prefilling isn’t working as well as it should, remember the following:
• If you need to edit the tax amount or total invoice value, click Split 
View first.
• The technology searches not by the supplier name, but rather by the 
ABN. For this reason, the prefill feature works much better if you complete 
the ABN details in the supplier’s contact first.
• If the Tax Code doesn’t prefill correctly, this is because the Tax Code that’s 
linked to the allocation account in your Chart of Accounts doesn’t match 
the Tax Code on your supplier’s invoice.
» If you link a bill from your In Tray to the incorrect transaction in MYOB, simply 
open this transaction and click Unlink.
» The Search field in the In Tray is a marvel — like having all your washing 
sorted into piles so you can find exactly what you’re looking for.
» If you love your tech, you can set up rules in Microsoft Outlook to auto￾forward any emails with the words ‘Invoice’ or ‘Receipt’ in the Subject field 
to your In Tray.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 205
» If you can’t see the option to create or link bills when viewing a document 
from your In Tray, click the Refresh button in your browser.
» The In Tray only reads PDF, JPG, TIFF or PNG files. This can be tricky, especially 
as the default image type on an iPhone is a HEIC file. However, if you have a 
file in a different format, you can usually open it in your default image 
software and click Save As or Export to save as a PDF or JPG file.
Hitting Up the ATO with TPAR
The Taxable Payments Annual Report (TPAR) lodgement is a compliance require￾ment from the ATO if you trade in particular industries, including building and 
construction, cleaners, and couriers to name a few (the ATO has the full listing if 
you want to confirm if this lodgement is applicable to your business). You’re 
required to report the amount you pay to all contractors for supply of services 
(such as labour) each year.
MYOB can help you with this reporting by submitting the relevant information to 
the ATO electronically (the alternative is a paper form that takes forever to fill in, 
no thanks!).
To ensure MYOB reports accurately for TPAR, you must do the following:
» Set up all contractors as suppliers and be sure to include their name, ABN and 
address as a minimum in their contact details.
» Still in the supplier’s contact details, ensure you click the Report Payments to 
ATO Via TPAR checkbox.
» Whenever you pay a contractor, be sure to add them as the contact on the 
Bill, Spend Money entry or Bank Transaction, and be sure to tick the Report to 
ATO Via TPAR checkbox.
Figure 8-5 shows a contractor bill marked for TPAR.
With the supplier set up in this way, reconciling and reporting to the ATO should 
be swift and easy at the end of the year.206 PART 2 Everyday Activities
When the time comes, this is how you go about getting your TPAR report ready:
1. Go to Reporting → Reports.
2. Go to the Business tab and click the Taxable Payments Annual Report 
link to open this report.
3. Select the Financial Year and ensure you have selected All Suppliers.
A summary list of your current suppliers (contractors) is generated, along with 
all payments that have been marked as reportable.
4. Reconcile this report total with the total of relevant cost of sales or 
expense accounts, such as Subcontractor Expense, Cleaning Expense and 
so on.
This reconciliation ensures you haven’t missed marking a payment as report￾able. Smaller businesses may have only one account for Subcontractor 
Expense, but larger businesses may have several accounts to which they 
allocate taxable payments.
Using the General Ledger or Account Transactions report, check the combined 
total of all these accounts matches the total in your TPAR report. You will need 
to select Cash as the Accounting Method (TPAR only accounts for payments 
made, not bills received).
FIGURE 8-5:
A contractor 
bill marked 
as reportable 
for TPAR.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 207
5. When you’re satisfied all is correct and reconciled, return to the Reports 
menu and re-generate the Taxable Payments Annual Report.
6. Click the green Create Taxable Payments File button.
The Create Taxable Payments File window appears.
7. Review, edit and complete all required fields.
8. Click the green Download File button.
The taxable payments file saves to your Downloads folder.
If you can’t find the downloaded file, look out for a pop-up blocker that may be 
preventing you from downloading and enable the download.
9. Lodge the taxable payments file with the ATO.
Lodge the downloaded taxable payments file with the ATO, either via your 
myGov account (if you’re the business owner) or by sending the file to your 
accountant or bookkeeper to lodge on your behalf.
Note: The Taxable Payments Annual Report only shows TPAR for payments you’ve 
made, not bills you’ve received.
Getting Everything Just Right
If you’re at all like me, you sometimes make mistakes — and, hopefully, learn 
from them. The more confident you get, the less frequent these may be — but 
mistakes do happen. Fortunately, you can cover your tracks so that no-one need 
ever know a thing.
If a purchase belongs to a previous period and you’ve already completed your BAS 
for that period, and you report for GST on an accruals basis, don’t delete the pur￾chase or make any changes that affect the amount of GST. Instead, you will need 
to create a credit and apply it with the current date.
Deleting purchases — zap, they’re gone!
You’ve recorded a purchase and now you want to delete it. Doing so is easy:
1. Go to Purchases → Bills.
The Bills page appears.208 PART 2 Everyday Activities
2. Apply filters to search for the bill you want to delete.
All your Bills will be listed based on the filters you set. If you know the supplier, 
filter by Supplier and ensure the date range is wide enough to expose the bill 
you’re looking for. If you know the invoice number, you can enter this in the 
Search field.
For more information on locating purchase orders, skip to ‘Looking up 
purchases and payments’ later in this chapter.
3. Click the Bill Number to go into the Bill.
The Bill window appears.
4. At the bottom left, click Delete.
You get a last chance here to change your mind via a pop-up that appears to 
confirm you want to do this.
5. If you definitely want to delete the bill, click Delete again.
Your purchase has now gone to live in the land of odd socks and ballpoint 
pens, never to be seen again.
Entering credit notes
Entering a credit note is the same as entering a purchase; the only difference is 
you enter the amount as a negative number (if you’re crediting for a service) or a 
negative number of units (if you’re crediting items).
Enter a brief description about why you’re issuing the credit note in the Notes area 
to save you futilely trying to jog your memory months later as to what happened 
and why.
After you’ve created the credit note, you need to match it against the bill that it’s 
crediting. For more details, see the later section ‘Checking and applying supplier 
returns’.
Changing your mind
Sometimes you may want to change a purchase, instead of deleting it. Perhaps you 
want to fix up the quantity or price, or perhaps you selected the wrong tax code. 
Making these changes is easy to do, but remember to consider the date of the bill 
and its implications for your BAS reporting, particularly if this purchase belongs 
to a previous BAS period.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 209
To change a purchase, find the purchase (refer to ‘Looking up purchases and pay￾ments’, later in this chapter), click the Bill Number to display the purchase, make 
any necessary changes and click Save. Easy as!
Facing the Music: How Much Do You Owe?
Checking reports brings back memories of school, waiting anxiously for the postie 
to deliver the end-of-year school report. Now, I get that feeling every month 
when I check to see how much I owe.
MYOB has a couple of useful reports (Reporting → Reports → Purchases) you can 
use to help you keep on top of outstanding supplier accounts (also referred to as 
Accounts Payable or Trade Creditors):
» The Unpaid Bills report: This report gives you a clear picture of all unpaid 
bills. Click Expand All to view individual bills owing, or click Collapse All to 
return to a single total per supplier. Under the Ageing Method menu, you can 
choose to display bills either by the number of days since the supplier invoice 
date, or the number of days the bill is overdue.
» The Payables Reconciliation with Tax report: This report shows what you 
owe suppliers at any particular date you select (which is great for reporting at 
the end of the month or financial year). The Payables Reconciliation also 
displays any discrepancy between the Total Amount Outstanding and the 
value of your Payables Account, something that’s helpful when reconciling 
your payables against your Balance Sheet. (I talk more about this in 
Chapter 18.)
If you receive a statement from a supplier, don’t be misled into blindly paying the 
total on the statement. Take the time instead to compare this statement against 
your Unpaid Bills report and ensure that you and your supplier are in perfect sync.
Recording supplier payments
You can record supplier payments in three different ways. Go with the method 
that best suits your business needs:
» Pay suppliers electronically, via your internet banking or credit card, and 
then, working from your bank feeds, record the payments in your MYOB 
file after the payments appear in your Bank Transactions. This method 
works best if you pay suppliers on an ad hoc basis, perhaps only paying a 210 PART 2 Everyday Activities
couple of suppliers at a time. I explain this method in the next section ‘Using 
bank feeds to match supplier payments’.
» Use MYOB as the starting point for paying your suppliers. With this 
method, you record supplier payments in your file first, and then generate an 
electronic payment file to import into your internet banking. This method 
works best if you pay lots of suppliers in a single payment run at the end of 
each fortnight or month. Chapter 14 explains more about making electronic 
payments using MYOB.
» Record payments manually in MYOB. This method is the one to use if you 
pay suppliers in cash, if you pay suppliers using a bank account that isn’t 
connected to bank feeds, or if you want to email your supplier a remittance 
advice but don’t want to bother with the hassle of batch electronic payments. 
See ‘Applying supplier payments manually’ later in this chapter for more 
details.
Using bank feeds to match 
supplier payments
Using bank feeds to match your supplier payments follows much the same process 
as matching customer deposits to outstanding invoices (which I covered in 
Chapter 7 when talking about recording deposits from a bank feed). When you 
reach the Match Transaction tab, you simply match to bills instead of invoices.
Figure 8-6 shows how the match should appear.
Here are some tips to help when matching supplier payments:
» If the withdrawal on your bank statement represents a batch electronic 
payment to more than one supplier (via an electronic payments file), you 
will need to match it to the batch payment created. Look or search for the 
transaction reference starting with EP (electronic payment) to help filter the 
list and find the match. Chapter 14 talks more about this process.
» If something isn’t matching the way you expected and you think you may 
have paid a supplier twice for the same bill, tick Show Closed Invoices to look 
for this potential existing payment.
» If you need to apply a discount — maybe a supplier offered you a discount for 
early payment, so you paid five per cent less — you can enter a value in the 
Discount ($) column on the Match Transaction tab.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 211
» If you’ve accidentally overpaid or underpaid your bill, you can change the 
value in the Match Amount ($) column on the Match Transaction tab. See 
‘Recording overpayments’ and ‘Recording part-payments or discounts’ 
later in this chapter.
You can save some time when you’re recording supplier payments through your 
bank transactions by creating a Bill rule (choosing Bill for the Transaction Type so 
that the rule identifies any open bills — and therefore possible matches — when 
a particular supplier appears in your bank transactions). Chapter  5 talks you 
through how to create rules.
Applying supplier payments manually
Sometimes it won’t work to record supplier payments direct from a bank feed. 
Perhaps you’re yet to connect your bank feeds, or perhaps you’ve paid a supplier 
using cash or even a personal bank account. Alternatively, perhaps you’re record￾ing a payment that is a little complex, and you want to be able to email your sup￾plier a remittance advice.
FIGURE 8-6:
Matching a 
supplier 
payment 
through 
your bank 
transactions.212 PART 2 Everyday Activities
In these situations, you need to record supplier payments manually:
1. Go to Purchases → Create Supplier Payment.
The Record Payment to Supplier page appears.
Note: The Reference Number is allocated automatically.
2. Enter the supplier’s name in the Supplier field.
3. Select your Bank Account.
Select the corresponding bank account from the drop-down options or, if this 
was a cash payment, select your Cash on Hand account.
4. Add a description to the Description of Transaction field and check 
the Date.
The name of your supplier should be sufficient for the Description of 
Transaction field, and the Date should be the same as the date you 
paid the bill.
5. Optional: Check the Show Closed Bills or Show Purchase Orders check￾boxes to make sure you haven’t got any unresolved history with this 
supplier or potential for over/underpayments.
Selecting these options may tell you more about your transaction history with 
this supplier. You should be able to identify double-ups, overpayments and 
purchase orders not yet converted to bills so you can avoid unnecessary 
payments or catch missed payments.
6. From the list of purchases, select the bills that you want to pay and check 
against the Total Amount Paid.
When you tick the checkboxes to the left of the relevant bills, the Amount Paid 
($) column prefills with the Balance Due ($) value of each bill. Double-check the 
Total Amount Paid ($) amount matches the payment you made.
If you discover that you’ve overpaid or underpaid a supplier, skip to the section 
‘Keeping Things in Tune’ to find out how to process these amounts.
7. Optional: Choose the Send Remittance Advice option.
In the next section, I share all the details around sending a remittance advice.
8. Click Save.
You’ve now recorded the supplier payment, matching this against their 
outstanding bill(s), as shown in Figure 8-7.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 213
Keep your wits about you when paying suppliers. Unfortunately, MYOB doesn’t 
display a warning if you enter a supplier bill twice. Avoiding double payments 
comes down to careful recordkeeping and, where possible, reconciling your 
records against supplier statements.
If you feel like you’ve seen or paid the same amount before, head to Purchases →
Bills and filter the list with a wide date range (so you don’t miss any). Use the 
Search field to find the supplier, the amount or the supplier’s invoice number to 
see if you can identify any duplicates.
Sending remittance advices
If you apply payments manually (see the preceding section for more details), or 
record payments electronically in batches (Chapter 14 explains more) you have the 
option to send detailed remittance advices. A remittance advice informs your sup￾pliers about which bills you’ve paid so that they can mirror the payment on their 
accounts, keeping you both in sync.
FIGURE 8-7:
Applying supplier 
payments 
manually.214 PART 2 Everyday Activities
To send a remittance advice, simply click the checkbox to Send Remittance Advice 
when preparing payments as shown in Figure 8-8, followed by either the radio 
button to Send Now or to Send Later.
If you select Send Now, a pop-up window appears after you click Save that shows 
the details of your remittance advice. Review the email that appears, adding to or 
editing the Subject and Email Message as needed, then click Send Remittance 
Advice.
If you select Send Later, you need to head to Purchases → Remittance Advice when 
you’re ready, where you’ll find all remittance advices you have opted to send later. 
Use the filters to narrow your selection if you only want to send a few at a time, 
and tick next to all the remittance advices you want to send. Click the Email but￾ton, review the email Subject and Message, and click Send Remittance.
You can change the defaults for the Subject and Message fields of your remittance 
advices by going to the Email Defaults tab of your Purchases Settings. Note, how￾ever, that you can’t customise the remittance advice template itself.
To see what your remittance advice looks like, click Download PDF instead of 
Email. If the remittance advice doesn’t look exactly as you want — sometimes the 
message field in MYOB doesn’t provide enough room for detailed information — a 
good workaround is to replace the supplier’s email address with your own. This 
way, you receive the email in your Inbox first. You can then forward this to the 
supplier’s address, editing the email first as required.
Looking up purchases and payments
How do you look up information about suppliers, purchase orders, payments or 
bills? Try these ways:
» Find your Purchase Orders. Go to Purchases → Purchase Orders and select 
All as the Status to view all purchase orders within your chosen date range. 
Click into the PO Number to view more details of a specific purchase order, or 
to convert a purchase order to a bill. You can also edit, delete, view (as a PDF) 
or email the purchase order as required.
» View all supplier bills. Go to Purchases → Bills and select All as the Status to 
view all bills within your chosen date range. You can also filter by Supplier or 
use the Search field if you have the invoice number, supplier or amount to 
hand. Sort by each column by clicking the column heading.
Figure 8-8 shows a typical Bills list sorted by Due Date.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 215
» Display paid bills only, and view payment details. To find paid bills, go to 
Purchases → Bills, select Closed as the Status and use the various filters to 
find the bill you need. Click the Bill Number to display the bill’s details. At the 
bottom of the bill you will find the Activity History, which shows the payment 
record. Click the purple payment number to display the payment details.
» Use Find Transactions. Go to Banking → Find Transactions, and head to the 
Transactions tab. Use the Search field to search for an amount, supplier or 
invoice number. You can also filter transactions by the Source Journal (for 
example, filter to Cash Payments when looking for payments made).
Keeping Things in Tune
Using the Purchases menu is like keeping a car on the road — doing so requires a 
certain amount of maintenance. Odd amounts crop up that you can’t delete, cred￾its appear that won’t go away, or accounts show up as owing when you know 
they’re not. However, if the car still runs it’s easy to be distracted from what really 
needs your attention.
Here’s the practical mechanic’s guide to a six-month service and tune.
Recording overpayments
Don’t feel too bad; everyone accidentally overpays a supplier sooner or later. If you 
have other outstanding bills, you may consider applying the payment to the next 
due bill and letting the supplier know what you’ve done so you’re both aligned. 
However, if you have no other bills owing, here’s how to record the payment so 
FIGURE 8-8:
Get a good 
overview of your 
Bills by filtering 
by the Due Date.216 PART 2 Everyday Activities
you can keep track of how much you’ve overpaid, ready to either claim a refund or 
apply this credit against a future invoice:
1. Follow the steps in either of the earlier sections ‘Using bank feeds to 
match supplier payments’ or ‘Applying supplier payments manually’, 
depending on the way you process your payments.
2. On the final bill you match or select, type the amount you paid, including 
the overpayment, in the Amount Paid ($) column.
For example, if you paid $1,500 when you should have paid $1,455, type 
$1,500 in the Amount Paid ($) column next to this bill (Figure 8-9 shows how 
this will look).
The box changes to blue and gives you an information icon as a warning, to let 
you know that MYOB will create a credit.
3. Click Save.
The credit is automatically created by MYOB and is now sitting in your 
Purchases, under Supplier Returns, ready for you to apply to future bills 
or process a refund.
FIGURE 8-9:
Dealing with 
supplier 
overpayments.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 217
Recording part-payments or discounts
Sometimes, you may have a good reason not to pay a supplier’s bill in full. Maybe 
you’re making a part-payment only at this point, or maybe you’re taking an 
early-payment discount.
To part-pay a bill, go to record the supplier payment in the way you normally 
would (either by matching against a bank feed or recording a supplier payment). 
Enter the amount you want to pay or apply the amount in the Amount Paid ($) 
column. Easy.
To apply a discount against a bill (either via Create Supplier Payment or through a 
match in your bank transactions), type the discounted amount in the Discount 
column. MYOB calculates the discounted balance for you, which should then bal￾ance with the amount you paid.
Fixing up supplier payments
Have you made a mistake with a supplier payment? Although you can change the 
date, description or the reference number of a supplier payment, you can’t change 
the amount or how you’ve allocated the payment. Instead, you may be best to 
delete this payment and then have another stab at getting it right.
To delete a supplier payment, follow my lead:
1. Go to Purchases → Bills.
To delete a payment, you first need to find the bill to which the payment was 
applied. Filter the status to Closed and then search by supplier, invoice number 
or amount to find the bill you need.
2. Click into the Bill Number to display the payment.
3. Scroll down to the bottom to view the Activity History and locate the 
payment.
4. Click into the purple reference number of the payment to display the 
payment transaction.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the payment transaction and select Delete.
If the transaction has been reconciled and you delete the payment, the 
transaction will be pushed back to the bank feed, where you will need to 
match it again correctly and then go back and re-reconcile your bank again 
(for the same date).218 PART 2 Everyday Activities
6. If required, record this payment once more, but correctly this time.
If you originally recorded this supplier payment from your bank feeds page, 
MYOB remembers the original bill(s) it was matched against. To fix this, first 
locate the payment in the bank transactions page, expand the transaction, 
and click Unmatch, which prompts a pop-up to appear to check you want 
to proceed. If you are sure you want to continue, select Unmatch again. 
Then start afresh, matching the supplier payment correctly this time.
Figure 8-10 shows the Unmatch option.
If this supplier payment belongs to an electronic batch payment, deleting it is a 
two-step approach. Before deleting the supplier payment, you first need to locate 
the batch payment and delete the batch. Make your way to Chapter 14 for more 
details about electronic payments.
Checking and applying supplier returns
Sometimes an amount shows up twice for a particular supplier in your Unpaid 
Bills report or your Payables Reconciliation with Tax report — the first time as a 
positive amount, the next time as a minus amount. The total amount due is zero, 
but the report keeps listing both amounts. This usually means you have a credit 
sitting in Supplier Returns.
FIGURE 8-10:
The Unmatch 
option on 
the Bank 
Transactions 
page.CHAPTER 8 Purchases and Supplier Payments 219
To fix this problem, head to Purchases → Supplier Returns. A list of all outstand￾ing Purchase Returns and Debits appears. Identify the offending credit and click 
Apply in the Apply to Purchase column, which opens the outstanding invoices for 
that supplier. Simply allocate the credit to the relevant bill and click Save, taking 
care to enter the current date in the Date field so that this adjustment doesn’t 
affect a prior BAS. Problem fixed.
Getting rid of odd amounts
No matter how meticulous you are, odd amounts inevitably creep into your sup￾plier accounts. Here are a couple of maintenance tricks:
» To create a credit note for a supplier, refer to ‘Entering credit notes’ earlier in 
this chapter.
» If you find you have some old bills with a few cents or dollars out of balance 
that are not appearing on the supplier’s statement (as they have probably 
chosen to write it off on their end already), simply edit the bill amount to be 
the same as the payment amount so that the out of balance returns to $0.00. 
Only use this approach for very small amounts that are considered immaterial 
to the ATO.
» To spring-clean your credits, go to the Supplier Returns page regularly 
(every BAS cycle works as a good reminder) and look at every credit listed. 
Wherever possible, apply these credits to outstanding purchases.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 221
Chapter 9
Reconcile Yourself
You have to reconcile yourself to a lot in this life. When you go for a picnic, 
it always rains. When your computer crashes, it’s the one time you didn’t 
back up. When you drop a piece of toast, it lands butter-side down.
Another fact of life that you have to reconcile yourself to is this: If you’re going to 
use MYOB, you have to reconcile your bank account. The good news is that recon￾ciling accounts is actually quite easy. It could be the maths nerd in me, but I love 
the feeling of satisfaction when everything balances.
In this chapter, I explain how to go about this process. I explain how one of the 
benefits of using bank feeds is that reconciling accounts is about ten times easier 
than if you’re not using feeds — but, regardless, I show you how to reconcile 
either way. I also share some tips and tricks for getting your bank accounts to bal￾ance, no matter how deep you are in the hole or how difficult your situation. 
Finally, I look at generating a reconciliation report.

bank account

situations

balance

What Reconciling is All About
Reconciling a bank account means comparing the balance of your bank account in 
your MYOB company file against the balance for the same date on your actual bank 
statement. For example, if your bank statement or bank balance according to 
internet banking says you have $5,000 in the bank and you double-check that the 
balance of your bank account in MYOB says the same thing, you can say that your 
account is reconciled.
Reconciling bank accounts isn’t an activity for bookkeepers who have nothing 
more exciting in their life to do on a Saturday night. Instead, reconciling accounts 
is often the only way to pick up mistakes, such as a payment entered as $900 
instead of $90, a deposit entered twice, or a missing payment.
Most businesses have lots of bank accounts — from cheque and savings accounts 
to term deposits, credit cards and loans. Although you don’t have to reconcile all 
these accounts, if you don’t your accountant probably will. An easy way to deter￾mine your priorities is to divide your accounts into three categories:
» Accounts you must reconcile: As a bare minimum, always reconcile your 
business bank account. Unless you do this, you can’t rely on any of your 
financial reports.
» Accounts to reconcile when you have time: It’s a good idea to reconcile all 
credit card, savings and PayPal accounts, as well as your business bank 
account.
» Accounts to reconcile if you’re feeling conscientious: Ideally, reconcile all 
your loan accounts as well. Loan accounts can be tricky, because you have to 
split up interest and principal on each loan repayment. (I explain how to do 
this in Chapter 18.)
Getting Ready to Reconcile
The first time you reconcile your bank account is likely to be the hardest. Not only 
do you have to get the opening balance correct, but you may also have to deal with 
a combination of transactions you entered manually (before you got bank feeds 
going), and transactions that have since come through on bank feeds. Although 
this process can seem tricky, don’t worry. In this section, I guide you safely 
through the process.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 223

Before you can begin to reconcile your bank account, you need to record the open￾ing balance. You may already have done this when you set up all your account 
opening balances as described in Chapter 3, but if you haven’t done so or want to 
double-check your work, read on.
Ready to record the opening balance for one of your bank accounts? Here’s my 
neat 1-2-3 approach:
1. Go to Accounting → Chart of Accounts.
2. Click Edit Accounts to expose the Opening Balance ($) column.
The Edit Accounts page appears. Here, you see each account listed by Account 
Type. The Opening Balance ($) column for each account is an editable field.
3. Locate the bank account and add the opening balance in the Opening 
Balance ($) field.
The best source for retrieving the opening balance of your bank account is 
your bank statement or internet bank balance for that day. For example, if 
you’re processing transactions in MYOB from 1 July, go to your internet 
banking and look at your closing bank balance for 30 June.
You can see how my opening balances look in Figure 9-1. The opening balance 
on my business bank account statement was $13,650 in credit, while the 
opening balance on my savings bank account statement was $58,652 in credit.
For more about opening balances for all accounts, refer to Chapter 3.
4. Check that the Account Type is Bank or Credit Card and the Tax 
Code is N-T.
You can also edit the Account Name at this point. I like to add the last four 
digits of the account number to the name (for example NAB Business 
Account 2925) to help me easily identify which account I’m working with.
All done? With opening balances for your bank account entered, you’re ready to 
reconcile your bank account.
Dealing with transactions that 
happened the day before
Imagine that you’re starting to reconcile your bank account from 1 July. You go to 
your internet banking and see that the closing balance of your bank account on 
30 June was $3,000. All good, you think, and you enter this as your bank opening 
balance (as I explain in the previous section).224 PART 2 Everyday Activities
However, when you look closer at your bank statement, you spot a deposit on 
1 July for $4,500. You know this deposit is for payments you received by EFTPOS 
the previous day. Strictly speaking, that $4,500 belongs to income for the previous 
year. What should you do with this transaction, and does it affect your bank open￾ing balance?
In this situation, I suggest you ask your accountant or bookkeeper how best to 
account for this income, as you don’t want to risk double-counting this income 
(and hence paying double tax!). They may suggest you adjust your opening bal￾ance to reflect this income, or they may be content to leave the income in the cur￾rent financial year.
Reconciling Your Bank Account
The method for reconciling your bank account depends on whether you’re using 
bank feeds or not. I explain both methods in the following sections.
Reconciling with bank feeds
I assume here that you’ve already set up your opening balances (if not, return to 
‘Getting Ready to Reconcile’, earlier in this chapter), that you’ve already entered 
a few bank transactions, and that your bank statement is close at hand. Ready to 
reconcile? Here goes:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions.
The Bank Transactions page appears.
FIGURE 9-1:
Entering opening 
bank account 
balances.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 225
2. Select the Bank Account you want to reconcile, your date range, and 
choose Unallocated as the Status.
When I’m first reconciling accounts, I like to work on a week or month at a time. 
For example, I might select 1 July as the Date From and 7 July as the Date To.
3. Work through the transactions, allocating, transferring or matching each 
one as you normally would.
For more about recording transactions direct from a bank feed, refer to 
Chapter 5.
4. If you’re not sure how to allocate a particular transaction, allocate it to 
your ‘Suspense’ or ‘Queries to Code’ account for now.
If a transaction has not been allocated, it won’t appear in your Reconcile 
Accounts window, so allocating this transaction somewhere means you can 
progress to reconciling this bank account. Chapter 6 takes you through how to 
clear these transactions from the Suspense/Queries to Code accounts with the 
help of your accountant or bookkeeper.
5. Continue until you no longer have any unallocated transactions.
In Figure 9-2, no unallocated transactions appear, which is exactly what 
you want.
6. Click Reconcile (next to the Bank Account field).
You can arrive at the Reconcile window by selecting Reconcile Accounts from 
the Banking menu.
FIGURE 9-2:
With no 
unallocated 
transactions 
within the 
required date 
range, you’re 
ready to 
reconcile.226 PART 2 Everyday Activities
7. Enter the Statement Date you want to reconcile to.
Keep things easy and start by reconciling a narrow date range — usually a 
week or so is enough.
If you don’t receive bank statements in the post anymore, I suggest you 
download a PDF of your bank statement and work from this, rather than trying 
to work from a list of transactions on your internet banking.
8. Enter your Closing Bank Statement Balance ($) from your actual bank 
statement.
Be sure to use your actual bank statement balance for this part. Don’t be 
tempted to copy the figure that MYOB displays in the Calculated Closing 
Balance as this defeats the whole purpose of reconciling. Your actual bank 
statement is the source of truth that you need to match to. (Although, if 
everything is balancing, these two figures will actually match!)
9. Check that the Out of Balance amount equals $0.00.
In a perfect world (using bank feeds is as close as your accounts will ever be to 
perfect), your Out of Balance amount should be $0.00, as shown in Figure 9-3. 
If not, skip ahead to ‘Troubleshooting Tricks’, later in this chapter.
10. Click the green Reconcile button.
Big yay! You receive a message at the top saying ‘Success, your account 
reconciles’. It’s a good feeling, isn’t it? If you want to save a copy of your bank 
reconciliation, skip to ‘Keeping Good Records’ later in this chapter.
FIGURE 9-3:
Reconciling your 
bank account is 
easiest if you do 
bite-sized chunks 
at a time.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 227
If everything is spot on, you should have no transactions showing when you 
return to the Reconcile Accounts page, with the only possible exceptions being 
uncleared cheques that suppliers haven’t banked yet. If you do have any other 
transactions showing here, go to ‘Resolving the black hole of unmatched 
transactions’, later in this chapter.
If and when the time comes that you need to reconcile an account with a negative 
balance, be mindful that the Closing Bank Statement Balance field does not like 
you entering a minus sign before you enter the amount. The easiest way around 
this is to type the amount first, then click to the front of this amount and add the 
minus sign.
Reconciling if you’re not using bank feeds
This section explains how to reconcile your bank account manually if you’re not 
using bank feeds. This information may also be relevant if you ended up with a 
few weeks or even months between starting to use MYOB and enabling bank feeds.
I assume here that you’ve already set up your opening balances (if not, return to 
‘Getting Ready to Reconcile’, earlier in this chapter), that you’ve already entered 
a few bank transactions, and that you have your bank statement close at hand. 
Here goes:
1. Go to Banking → Reconcile Accounts.
The Reconcile Accounts page appears.
2. Select the bank account you wish to reconcile from the Account drop￾down field.
Your bank account should be near the top of the list.
3. If it’s the first time you’re reconciling this account, enter your start date 
as the Statement Date to check that the Calculated Closing Balance and 
the Closing Bank Statement Balance match and that the Out of Balance 
amount is $0.00.
Assuming you haven’t yet marked off any transactions, the Calculated Closing 
Balance should equal the opening balance on your bank statement.
No — not the same balance? Return to the section ‘Getting Ready to Reconcile’, 
earlier in this chapter, and make sure you recorded your opening balance 
correctly. Those debits and credits can get confusing. Alternatively, if this bank 
account has already been reconciled in the past, skip ahead to ‘Identifying your 
starting point’ for more tips on starting off at the right point. You will know if 
the bank account has been reconciled in the past as a date will appear after 
Date Last Reconciled, under the Account drop-down field.228 PART 2 Everyday Activities
4. Change the Statement Date to become the date you’re reconciling up to.
Now change the date so that it is the date that your bank statement goes up 
to. In the example shown in Figure 9-3, I’m reconciling my statement up to 
7 July.
If you’re reconciling manually for the gap of time before your bank feeds went 
live, ensure you only reconcile up to the date when your bank feeds began; this 
way, you can check your manually entered data is reconciled correctly first, 
even if your bank statement goes beyond this date.
5. Click off your payments and deposits, one by one.
Work down your bank statement and, one by one, find each transaction line 
and click the checkbox to the left, which will turn the line purple so you can see 
the remaining transactions at a glance. The result should look similar to 
Figure 9-3.
6. If you see any mistakes, fix them up right here and now.
Perhaps you entered a payment as $800 instead of $80, or a deposit as 
$78 instead of $87. To fix a mistake, drop-down arrow to the right of the 
transaction and click the purple Reference number. The transaction will open, 
and you can change any details that you need to and then click Record.
If you have to fix a mistake in this way, MYOB takes you to the Find Transactions 
page rather than back to the Reconcile Accounts page, so you will need to go 
back into Reconcile Accounts from the Banking menu.
Note: Manually entered transactions are easy to change in this way; however, 
MYOB will duplicate the transaction if you change the amount or date of a 
bank feed transaction. Chapter 5 explains more about editing or removing 
bank feed transactions.
If you navigate away from the Reconcile Accounts page, MYOB removes the 
checkmarks next to your selected transactions and you’ll need to start again, 
which can get frustrating. To avoid losing your hard work, click the Save 
Progress button to the top right as you reconcile.
7. After half a page or so, enter the running balance amount from your 
bank statement in the Closing Bank Statement Balance ($) field to check 
you’re staying on track.
When you first work on reconciling, don’t try to do a whole page at a time. 
Instead, work in small, bite-sized chunks of a third or half of a page. When you 
complete a stage, look at the running balance on your bank statement and 
enter this amount in the Closing Bank Statement Balance ($) field in the top 
right. In Figure 9-3, my Closing Bank Statement Balance is $48,197.63.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 229
8. Cross your fingers and check that the Out of Balance amount is $0.00.
If the Out of Balance amount is $0.00 (as in Figure 9-3), do a little dance to 
celebrate. However, if your bank account doesn’t balance, don’t be discour￾aged. Work through these instructions one more time, checking each step as 
you go, and you should be able to find where you went wrong.
Still no luck? Skip ahead to the section ‘When Your Bank Account Just Won’t 
Balance’, later in this chapter.
9. Click Reconcile.
Hooray! You receive a message saying ‘Success, your account reconciles’. If you 
want to save a copy of the completed bank reconciliation, head to the later 
section ‘Keeping Good Records’ for a step-by-step guide.
Troubleshooting Tricks
In this section, I explain how to deal with some of the trickier aspects of bank 
reconciliations, such as figuring out where you (or the previous bookkeeper or 
accountant) left off, entering and finding missing transactions, and fixing up 
mistakes.
Identifying your starting point
Unless you’re working with bank feeds, the first step in reconciling a bank account 
is always to figure out where you finished working the last time.
Go to Reconcile Accounts as normal, select your bank account in the Account field 
and check the Date Last Reconciled just underneath the Account field. Enter this 
same date as the Statement Date, and this should bring you to your starting 
point — where you or the last person working in the file left off. This provides a 
good indication of where you got up to with your last reconciliation.
Now check that the Calculated Closing Balance matches with your bank statement 
for this date. If you have no unreconciled transactions and your Calculated Closing 
Balance is dead on, then yippee! You’ve found the spot you need to start from.
This method also exposes if there are any transactions that you had reconciled 
previously, but for which you since changed the amount or the date accidentally. 
(If you edit the amount or date of a previously reconciled bank feed transaction, 
MYOB unreconciles the original transaction, which returns it to an Unallocated 
status on your Bank Transactions page and also creates a new transaction with 230 PART 2 Everyday Activities
these changed details. This new transaction will appear conspicuously at the top 
of the Reconcile Accounts page next time you go to reconcile.) This approach also 
flags if you have entered any transactions manually in error (they will not have 
the checkmark already ticked in the Reconcile Accounts page, so you will know it 
has arrived here via your bank feed) so you can attend to them before moving on 
to the next reconciliation date.
Note the following:
» I assume here that you’ve reconciled your bank account at least once before. 
If not, go back to the beginning of this chapter and start reading from 
‘Reconciling Your Bank Account’.
» You can avoid losing your ‘reconciling’ place in future by using a highlighter 
pen on your bank statement to mark the spot you got to.
» Don’t get complacent by thinking there’s no need to check the correct starting 
point; checking your starting point is good practice to ensure nothing has 
been left unreconciled from a prior period.
If you find that your Calculated Closing Balance doesn’t match the Closing Bank 
Statement Balance from your prior reconciliation and you have no unreconciled 
transactions, double-check your dates. If the issue persists, skip ahead to the sec￾tion ‘Undoing the previous reconciliation’.
Locating transactions that disappear
You’re absolutely, totally, 100 per cent positive that you recorded a particular 
transaction (perhaps only a few minutes before). Yet when you go to Reconcile 
Accounts, the darned thing won’t show up on the screen. Where’s it gone?
Don your detective hat and try the following:
» Ensure you enter a date in the Statement Date field. Unless you enter a 
date here, you won’t see any transactions at all.
» Change the Statement Date to a date way in the future. Whenever you 
reconcile an account, you only see transactions that have a date on or before 
the Statement Date. By temporarily changing the date to sometime in the 
future (for example, 12 December 2099), you can pick up on transactions that 
you have entered with the wrong date. This happens more often than you 
may think!CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 231
» Check which bank account the transaction went to. Perhaps you acciden￾tally allocated the missing transaction to a different bank account (another 
common error if you’re manually entering transactions via Spend Money or 
Receive Money). Simply flick through the different bank accounts from the 
Reconcile Accounts window, one at a time, and see if this transaction appears.
» Check the transaction hasn’t magically unallocated itself and gone back 
to your bank feed. Only allocated, matched or transferred transactions push 
through to the Reconcile Accounts page, so maybe this transaction is still 
sitting unallocated in your bank transactions (which can happen when you 
change the dates or amounts on your bank feed transactions).
» Try to recall what account you allocated the transaction to. Go to 
Banking → Find Transactions and head to the Transactions tab. Set a wide 
date range and hopefully the transaction will appear. When you find the 
transaction, click into it to display the details so you can fix the error, which 
should mean it appears on the Reconcile Accounts page.
Still no luck? Trust in the reconciliation process and at some point soon (and 
hopefully not in the far-distant future) the transaction should reappear. However, 
to avoid holding yourself up any longer, re-enter the transaction so you can 
reconcile and move on.
Entering missing transactions on the go
If you’re in the middle of reconciling and realise you’ve forgotten to enter a trans￾action, hit Save Progress before you do anything else, just in case. However, you 
don’t need to move away from the Reconcile Accounts page to enter a missing 
transaction. Simply head to the menu bar, right click on the function you need (for 
example, Spend Money) and select ‘Open Link in a New Tab’. A new tab will open 
in your browser where you can go ahead and record your missing entry. When 
you’re finished, return to the Reconcile Accounts tab and refresh the page, and the 
added transaction you’ve just created will appear.
If you’re using bank feeds, you will very rarely, if ever, have a situation where a 
transaction appears on your bank statement but not on your bank feed. (Possible 
exceptions are if your subscription lapses and your bank feeds are interrupted, or 
rare situations where the bank feed itself is wrong.) So, if a transaction appears to 
be missing from the Reconcile Accounts page, go to your Bank Transactions page 
first to double-check that this transaction isn’t showing as unallocated. To be sure 
this transaction is definitely missing from the bank feed, make sure you select All 
Transactions as your Status and widen the date range to a few days either side of 
the transaction. You can also use the Search field to look for the transaction amount.232 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Resolving the black hole of 
unmatched transactions
At the risk of this chapter ending up as a litany of everything that can go wrong, 
I’m now going to focus on the trickier situation of transactions that show up as 
unmarked on your Reconcile Accounts page, but you don’t know why they are 
there or what to do with them.
Table 9-1 explores the different reasons these problems occur. You can see that 
some of the suggested solutions are easier to implement than others, while others 
require some creative (but legit) accounting to solve the problem.
SWEEPING STUFF UNDER THE CARPET
One day, I decided to teach my daughter how to reconcile my business bank account. 
I was in the middle of showing her how the process worked when the phone rang, and 
I had to dash off to see a client. I was gone most of the morning.
When I returned, she was lying happily on that sofa and giggling at TikTok videos. ‘How 
did you go?’ I asked. ‘Fine,’ she answered, ‘I reconciled the last six months of your bank 
statements without a problem; it really doesn’t seem that hard.’ I approached my laptop 
with a sense of trepidation that was soon justified. ‘What’s this entry?’ I asked. ‘And this 
one?’ I highlighted a whole bunch of transactions simply labelled ‘Miscellaneous’, some 
of which were for thousands of dollars.
‘Well,’ she replied, ‘When I couldn’t get the statement to balance, I calculated the differ￾ence, entered a transaction for that amount, marked the statement as reconciled, and 
then kept going. Seemed logical to me.’
I tried to explain to her that inventing transactions to patch up bank reconciliations is 
like leaving a banana in your lunchbox over the holidays in your school bag. The prob￾lem simply festers and gets worse as time passes. After all, the idea of reconciling 
accounts is to find your mistakes and fix ’em up. ‘But who has the time to look that 
closely! Surely, at some point you’ll find the mess, right?’ she asked. ‘You’re not getting 
the point,’ I answered. ‘Never mind,’ she replied, and continued scrolling through more 
TikTok videos.
Reconciling your bank takes patience and care so you can be sure everything is aligned 
and accounted for rather than left for you to uncover later on. A quick fix is never the 
solution.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 233
TABLE 9-1	 Dealing with Unmatched Transactions
Problem Cause of Problem Solution
You recorded a payment 
for an invoice via the 
Sales menu and created 
an invoice payment. 
However, when the 
deposit came through 
the bank feed into your 
bank transactions, you 
allocated it directly to 
the sales account rather 
than finding the pay￾ment match.
If you’re using bank feeds, you should 
only match invoices or bills via the 
Match Transaction function on the 
Bank Transactions page. Allocating 
the transaction directly to the sales 
account causes the transaction to 
appear twice on the Reconcile 
Accounts page (because one transac￾tion has been allocated and another 
has been created as an invoice or bill 
payment).
Note the doubled-up transaction 
amount, go back to your bank transac￾tions page and search for the amount. 
Select the offending transaction (the 
one you allocated directly to an income 
account), and click Unallocate.
Now, record this transaction correctly! 
Click the drop-down arrow to the right 
of the transaction, go to the Match 
Transaction tab and find the payment 
match for this transaction.
You pay superannuation 
through MYOB. When 
processing the transac￾tion, you selected the 
wrong bank account to 
draw the funds from.
With the superannuation payment sit￾ting in one account and the actual 
payment coming out of another, they 
can’t match up to become one.
Allocate the super payment that 
appears on your Bank Transactions 
page to the bank account that you 
wrongly selected for the superannua￾tion payment. This creates an equal 
debit and credit in the wrong account, 
which will cancel each other out when 
you come to reconcile.
A transaction shows 
twice in your bank feed 
but only once on your 
bank statement.
The bank feed itself is wrong. Problems with bank feeds are very rare 
but if this issue occurs again, contact 
MYOB Support. See Chapter 5 for more 
information about removing bank feed 
transactions.
You have a pay run that 
you can’t match because 
you underpaid the 
employee. This is quite 
common!
The net pay run amount and the 
amount paid that shows in your bank 
feed are different.
Match the amount paid to the 
employee to the correct pay run, and 
then when you pay them the balance of 
their pay, match this second amount to 
the same pay run to make the pay run 
balance.
You have a pay run that 
you can’t match because 
you overpaid the 
employee.
The net pay run amount and the 
amount paid that shows in your bank 
feed are different.
If you overpaid the employee by just a 
few dollars, match the payment to the 
correct pay run and then use the Add 
Adjustment feature to allocate the 
value of this small difference to a 
rounding account. If you have overpaid 
by a significant amount, you may need 
to refer to Fair Work for your best next 
step to resolve the overpayment.234 PART 2 Everyday Activities
When Your Bank Account 
Just Won’t Balance
Many times, I have been asked to resolve the puzzle of why bank accounts won’t 
reconcile. For me, it is like a game of Sudoku — you need to start with the num￾bers you have (such as a from a bank statement), and then work through the easy 
plays first.
The longer you leave reconciling, the bigger the problem, so do it at least every 
month (and if you have loads of transactions, consider reconciling every week). It 
is trickier if you manually enter transactions because both the amounts and the 
dates may not match up exactly as per your bank statement. If you’re using bank 
feeds, the solutions tend to present themselves more readily.
In the next few sections, I share some tips and tricks for reconciling success.
Tricks to try before you kick the cat
When your bank account doesn’t balance, stay calm and assess what’s in front 
of you:
» Check you’re starting from the right spot and that your last reconcilia￾tion still balances. I know this seems obvious, like when the computer isn’t 
working and IT asks if you’ve tried turning it off and on again, but this check is 
always your first point of call. If you are reconciling for the first time, enter 
your start date (your opening balance date) and check for a match; if you’ve 
already reconciled at least once, enter the date you last reconciled and again 
check for a match. (Refer to the earlier section ‘Identifying your starting point’ 
to run through this process in detail.)
If you find that your starting balance is wrong, skip ahead to ‘Undoing the 
previous reconciliation’.
» Do the number nine trick. If your Out of Balance amount is a multiple of 
nine, look to see if you put in two numbers back to front — for example, you 
entered 685 instead of 658. (It’s a curious thing, but if you have a number back 
to front and subtract your result from the original number, the difference is 
always exactly divisible by nine.)
If you’re using bank feeds, the amounts are set rather than manually entered 
so this is unlikely to be the answer.
» Look for unallocated transactions. Are there any unallocated transactions 
in your bank transactions? Bank transactions from your bank feeds will only CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 235
push through to the Reconcile Accounts page if you have allocated them, so 
check the date range you’re reconciling from and look for unallocated 
transactions.
» Call on your hidden powers. How much are you out by? Does this amount 
ring a bell?
Tricks to try before you kick the dog
If you’ve tried the suggestions so far with no success, go grab yourself a coffee and 
take a break to get all those numbers out of your head. Then try the following:
» Watch for overdrafts that go into credit. If your bank account is an 
overdraft but you’re actually in credit, you need to enter the Closing Statement 
Balance as a minus amount. (This seems weird, but it’s true.)
» Make sure you’re in the right spot. Did you start off from the right spot in 
your bank statement? It’s easy to accidentally skip a page or part of a page. 
Also, check if you have the right statement year. Don’t laugh — I have seen 
this happen!
» Compare the magic totals. Somewhere on your bank statement you can 
usually find a summary of total debits and total credits. Head to your 
Reporting menu and select Reports, then pull up a Bank Transactions report 
for this bank account with a corresponding date range. Look to the bottom, 
where you see totals for Deposits and Withdrawals. Try comparing these 
totals with your bank statement’s totals to see whether the problem lies with 
deposits or withdrawals (or both!).
» Divide by two. Try dividing your Out of Balance amount by two and look for a 
transaction for this amount. In other words, if your Out of Balance amount is 
$90, look for a transaction equalling $45. This trick helps locate transactions 
that have been entered the wrong way round (a debit instead of a credit, a 
payment instead of a deposit, and so on).
Tricks to try before you kick the computer
You’ve tried all the preceding suggestions and your account reconciliation still 
doesn’t balance. Don’t abandon ship yet, there’s still hope. Here’s my last move, 
which (almost) always works:
1. If you’re using bank feeds, reconcile in smaller chunks (if you’re not using 
bank feeds, move straight to Step 2).236 PART 2 Everyday Activities
Try to reconcile for just one month first; if that reconciles, move on to the 
following month. When you hit an obstacle, try breaking down your reconciling 
to week by week until you isolate the problem. By reconciling in small enough 
chunks, you should then be able to see what the issue is.
Because you’re using bank feeds, all transactions should automatically be 
selected (and therefore highlighted in purple). If a transaction isn’t selected, 
this could well be your culprit.
2. If you’re not using bank feeds, start by checking your opening balance 
was correct, and then mark off transactions in small chunks of a few 
transactions at a time.
See ‘Identifying your starting point’ earlier in this chapter to ensure you’re 
starting off at the right spot. Once you’re sure of this, deselect any transactions 
that are already selected, and then start again, marking off only a few transac￾tions at a time while checking the closing balance of your bank statement 
against the Calculated Closing Balance.
Breaking down the number of transactions into smaller chunks helps you 
isolate the time frame you really need to focus on.
3. Click Reconcile and then Reconcile again. Continue till you’re done.
Once you know you’ve got a few days or a week to reconcile, click Reconcile it 
so that you move those transactions out of the way and off your list. Continue 
in the same way, working down your bank statement a bit at a time, until your 
final balance reconciles. Slow and steady wins the race here.
Undoing the previous reconciliation
One of the stickiest situations is when the Calculated Statement Balance displayed 
in Reconcile Accounts doesn’t match the ending balance on your bank statement 
from the last time you reconciled. (Refer to ‘Identifying your starting point’ ear￾lier in this chapter for more details about this process.)
What this usually means is one of the following three scenarios has occurred:
» You’ve inadvertently edited a transaction that had already been recon￾ciled. For example, you’ve already reconciled up to October but, in a fit of 
creativity, you decided to change a transaction belonging to September that 
had already been reconciled and in doing so, you’ve made your beginning 
balance go out of whack. To identify this transaction and fix the problem, 
change the Statement Date to be the same as your Date Last Reconciled and 
the culprit should appear.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 237
» You’ve deleted a transaction, which has pushed it back to the bank 
transactions page, where it appears as unallocated (so it won’t show up 
on the Reconcile Accounts page). To fix this, simply reallocate the transac￾tion correctly, return to Reconcile Accounts, and mark off this transaction.
» You’ve added an extra transaction manually. This will be easy to spot as it 
will appear on the Reconcile Accounts page as a line with a white background 
(rather than purple). Perhaps you entered a petty cash transaction via Spend 
Money and chose the incorrect bank account in the process? Review why the 
transaction has appeared and where it belongs (maybe it has the wrong date 
or you’ve selected the wrong bank account).
If you use bank feeds and undo a reconciliation, all transactions that were marked 
off in that previous reconciliation will return to the Reconcile Accounts window. 
They will be unchecked this time, however, and you will need to manually tick the 
checkbox next to each transaction again to redo your reconciliation. Before you 
decide to go ahead and undo your reconciliation, maybe run through each possible 
scenario again, just in case you missed something the first time.
If your beginning balance is definitely wrong and just can’t see why, your next 
course of action is to undo the previous reconciliation, as follows:
1. Go to Banking → Reconcile Accounts.
The Reconcile Accounts page appears.
2. Click Undo, which is next to the Date Last Reconciled.
A pop-up window appears to check you definitely want to undo your 
reconciliation.
3. If you are 100 per cent sure, click Yes, Undo Reconciliation (if you change 
your mind, click No, Keep, and breathe a sigh of relief).
Bam, just like that, you’ve undone your last reconciliation.
4. Compare the new Calculated Closing Balance with your bank statement 
as at the Last Reconciled Date.
If the Calculated Closing Balance matches up with your bank statement for that 
date, you’re cooking with gas. All that remains to be done now is to redo your 
bank reconciliations up to the current date.
If the Calculated Statement Balance doesn’t match up with your bank state￾ment for that date, don’t sweat. Before you go back to reconciling, check your 
Balance Sheet balance at that same date. If the Balance Sheet is correct but the 
Reconcile Accounts page still shows an out of balance amount at this date, 
your data file could be in need of repair by MYOB. If this is the case, you need 
to call MYOB Support.238 PART 2 Everyday Activities
5. Repeat the Undo Reconciliation process again and again until your 
beginning balance is correct.
If you have to go back some way to find the problem, you’re creating a lot of 
work for yourself, so this final step is really a last resort.
Keen to avoid the extra work? One final suggestion if the first undo reconcilia￾tion didn’t work is to look through your General Ledger report for the impacted 
bank account and try to find a point in time when everything did balance. From 
here, you can check against your statement to help you identify the issue.
Keeping Good Records
Whenever you reconcile your bank account, you have the option of generating a 
Banking Reconciliation report. Should you or shouldn’t you? Here’s my take on it:
» If you love to work with paper and really need that tactile evidence to hand, 
print a reconciliation report every time you reconcile your bank account (or 
maybe just the last reconciliation of the month). Staple this report to the bank 
statement and file away in a folder.
» If you are happy not to print but feel a point-in-time copy is necessary, 
I suggest you save your bank reconciliation report as a PDF in a folder 
called Bank Reconciliations (using the reconciliation date as a file-naming 
convention).
» If you have no desire to save a Banking Reconciliation report at all, then as 
a minimum create a point-in-time Banking Reconciliation report at 30 June 
(or whatever the last day of your financial year is) for the purpose of good 
recordkeeping for the full financial year.
If you want to generate a copy of the Banking Reconciliation report, here’s how:
1. Go to Reporting → Reports and go to the Banking tab.
2. Click the Banking Reconciliation report.
3. Choose the Bank Statement Date of the report you wish to create (in 
other words, the date you just reconciled to) then filter via the Accounts 
button to select the accounts to include in the report.
You can either include one bank account at a time if you want separate reports 
or select All Accounts to include all bank reconciliations for that date on the 
one report.CHAPTER 9 Reconcile Yourself 239
4. Select Expand All for a detailed report (with all transactions showing) or 
select Collapse All for a summary report (showing only the reconciled 
totals).
5. Click the Export button and choose to either export the report via Excel 
or PDF, then click Export again.
Depending on your Report Settings (which you can adjust under the Settings 
menu), MYOB will either download this report to your Downloads folder or 
open a PDF of the report in a new tab of your browser (from where you can 
either save, download or print the report).3

Managing Items
I call this chapter ‘Managing Items’ as opposed to ‘Managing Inventory’ because 
lots of businesses that use the Items list in MYOB don’t have any inventory at 
all, and instead use the Items list to bill customers for services, listing each 
service as a separate item. On the other hand, many other businesses make full 
use of items in MYOB for managing everything to do with inventory, including 
pricing, stock levels, reporting and much more.
Here, I share the essentials for working with your Items list, including how to 
create new items, price items and generate item reports. I also delve into the 
intricacies of managing inventory, explaining how to do stock counts (pretty 
easy), make inventory adjustments (not so easy) and record opening inventory 
balances (easy enough if you have collected the right data for entry).
So grab a cuppa and put any anxiety to one side. Your persistence and patience, 
combined with my thoughtful guidance, are enough for you to master this topic 
like a pro.

for the job

» Finding, changing and deleting items
» Changing prices and generating 
inventory reports
» Making inventory adjustments
» Completing the perfect stocktake244 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Seeing if the Shoe Fits
When getting started, keep the following points in mind when considering what 
inventory features you need, and whether MYOB Business will fit the bill:
» MYOB Business allows you to create as many items to buy and sell as you 
want, but unless you subscribe to pay an additional monthly fee for unlimited 
inventory (also referred to as Premium inventory) the number of items that 
you can inventory is limited to ten.
You can test the functionality across ten active items before you commit to 
the cost of upgrading your MYOB Business subscription to include unlimited 
inventory.
» MYOB defines the number of items you can inventory as the number of active 
items where you have clicked the option I Track Stock of This Item. You may 
find you have lots of items where you don’t need to click this option, including 
items you buy but don’t sell (such as raw materials) or items that you sell but 
don’t buy (such as hourly rates). You only need to click the option to track 
stock of an item if you need MYOB to keep track of quantities on hand.
» AccountRight Plus and AccountRight Premier offer more extensive inventory 
management. (The inventory features are the same in both AccountRight 
products.) Inventory features in AccountRight that you don’t get in MYOB 
Business include the ability to build items from other items, create bills of 
materials, track quantities in multiple locations, create tiered pricing levels, 
add items to inventory without receiving a supplier bill, manage purchase 
orders, manage backorders, record stocktakes, and generate pricing and item 
transaction reports.
At some point, it’s possible you’ll decide that MYOB Business doesn’t provide 
the depth of inventory management you require and that AccountRight 
is the way to go. Currently, the only way to move from MYOB Business to 
AccountRight is by starting a new plan and entering your opening balances 
from scratch (which may be easier at certain times of the financial year, so 
do consult your accountant or bookkeeper). You can export and import your 
Contacts and Items from one plan to the other to help make the move a little 
easier, but none of your transaction history will come across.
If you think that the superior inventory features of AccountRight may justify 
switching from MYOB Business, do be aware that there are many differences 
between the products other than inventory. AccountRight is significantly more 
expensive than MYOB Business, and its additional features are not available 
from a browser meaning, for example, that you can’t access the software on 
a Mac computer or a tablet.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 245
» If you need even more functionality with your inventory than AccountRight 
can offer, or if you need additional inventory features but you’re reluctant to 
switch to AccountRight, then it may be time to consider an add-on application. 
Many developers have come up with apps that dovetail well with MYOB 
products, such as Tall Emu (an app that MYOB has acquired), Web Ninja and 
Shopify.
To check out available inventory add-ons, head to your business name and 
click App Marketplace. Do remember to select your product name (such as 
MYOB Business) from the left-hand menu to ensure that any apps you 
consider are compatible with the version of MYOB you’re using.
Note: While some inventory features are similar between MYOB Business and 
MYOB AccountRight, specific commands and menus are quite different. This book 
is a guide to using MYOB Business and doesn’t cover the advanced inventory 
features of MYOB AccountRight.
Adding Items to Your Items List
Regardless of what kind of business you’re running, creating a new item in your 
Items list is an easy song to sing.
Creating a new item
So you’re ready to create your first item? Follow my tune:
1. Go to Inventory → Create Item.
If you’re already in the Items list, you can also select Create Item from the top 
right of the page.
The Create Item page appears.
2. Enter a Name for the item.
Decide on a suitable name for the item, such as ‘Long Socks Smiley Design’. 
You’re limited to 30 characters, so be concise.
3. Enter a Description for the item.
You have plenty of space here to add more details about your items. For 
example, a client of mine sells large model airplanes and uses the Description 
field to provide a long description of everything included in the set. This 
description appears on every invoice because he ticked the Use Item 
Description on Sales and Purchases checkbox. Very handy indeed.246 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
If you leave the Description field blank, the item’s Name will also show in the 
Description field.
4. Enter an Item ID.
The Item ID doesn’t have to be a number. In fact, using letters instead of (or as 
well as) numbers often makes more sense. For example, ‘Long Socks Smiley 
Design’ could have LS-Smiley as its ID, or a small black T-shirt could be TS-SmBl. 
Above all, be consistent with your item IDs — follow a pattern from one 
inventory item to the next, so you can build a logical naming system.
5. Tick the I Track Stock for This Item, I Sell This Item and I Buy This Item 
boxes as required for the item.
If you buy this item for resale, and you want to track how many you have in 
stock at any one time, click all three boxes. If you don’t buy this item for resale 
(that is, you only sell it) and you’re not sure which boxes to tick, check out the 
section ‘Specifying whether you buy, sell or track items’, later in this chapter.
6. Select the asset, income and cost of sales accounts for this item, where 
prompted.
When you tick the boxes labelled I Track Stock for This Item, I Sell This Item and 
I Buy This Item, you’re prompted to complete the corresponding asset, income 
and cost of sales accounts, as shown in Figure 10-1. This feature is MYOB’s way 
of saying, ‘You’ve told me that you sell this item, now tell me which Income 
account this sale should go to’ or ‘You’ve told me that you buy this item, so 
what’s the cost of sales account for this purchase?’
For example, in Figure 10-1, I specify that sales of Long Socks Smiley Design 
should go to the Sock Sales account, and that the Cost of Sales should go to 
the Clothing Purchases account. (The cost of sales account you select could 
also be an expense account — I talk more about selecting these accounts in 
the section ‘Telling things where to go’, later in this chapter.)
7. If you sell this item, enter the Selling Price ($) (including whether this 
price is Tax Inclusive or Tax Exclusive), the Unit of Measure, the Items 
Per Selling Unit and the Tax Code.
If the Selling Price includes GST, click Tax Inclusive; if the price does not include 
GST, tick Tax Exclusive.
Enter the Unit of Measure (each, box, kilo or whatever) and, if necessary, edit 
the number of items in each selling unit. For example, if I sell eggs by the 
dozen, my Unit of Measure is ‘carton’ and the number of Items per Selling 
Unit is 12.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 247
8. If you buy items: In the Buying section, enter the Buying Price ($), Unit of 
Measure, Items Per Buying Unit and Tax Code.
If the Buying Price includes GST, click Tax Inclusive; if the price does not include 
GST, tick Tax Exclusive.
Enter the Unit of Measure and the number of items in each buying unit. 
For example, if I buy my Long Socks Smiley Design socks in a box containing 
20 pairs of socks, I enter ‘box’ and ‘20’.
You can also add the Supplier Item ID here, which is the Item ID that your 
supplier uses when you purchase this item from them, and which will appear 
on your purchase orders and bills. Including this detail helps keep you and 
your suppliers on the same page, minimising any misunderstandings regard￾ing which items you’re ordering and paying for.
FIGURE 10-1:
Creating a 
new item.248 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
9. If you track stock for this item, complete the details in the Restocking 
Information section.
Enter the minimum number of units you want to hold in stock so as not to lose 
sales in the Minimum Stock Level field. See ‘Taking things an extra step’ later in 
this chapter for more about stock levels and primary suppliers.
10. Click Save to add your new item to your inventory.
Your new item is now added to your Items list. You can easily edit this item by 
clicking the Item ID from the Items list as required.
You can also create an item on the fly when you’re creating an invoice, purchase 
order or supplier bill, if you haven’t previously set up the required item. As you 
create the invoice, purchase order or supplier bill, click the drop-down arrow in 
the Item ID field and click the purple Create Item link at the top of the list of items. 
Note: You may need to go back later and set up the item’s restocking information 
as that section doesn’t appear when you create an item this way.
If you’re setting up a whole load of new items, and you already have these items 
in a list elsewhere on your computer (maybe in a spreadsheet or document file), 
you’re best to import this list, rather than type it from scratch. To import data, go 
to your Settings and select Import and Export Data (for more on your Settings, 
turn to Chapter 1). For more details about the intricacies of importing data, and to 
download a template that will help you organise your items list into the correct 
format for importing, look for the document in MYOB Help called ‘Importing 
items’. I recommend you also ask an experienced bookkeeper or accountant for 
advice here to avoid potential issues.
Specifying whether you buy, 
sell or track items
Those three little innocent boxes I Track Stock for This Item, I Sell This Item and 
I Buy This Item can cause such confusion. Which boxes you tick depends on the 
kind of business you operate. Here goes . . .
When you buy something, sell it and want to 
know how many you have in stock
If you buy items for resale, whether they’re clothes or medicines, books or socks, 
tick all three boxes: I Track Stock for This Item, I Sell This Item and I Buy 
This Item.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 249
When you just sell something
If you sell things that you don’t buy, the only box you have to tick is I Sell This 
Item (leave the other boxes unticked). ‘Hang on a minute!’ I hear you say. ‘How is 
it possible to sell something you’ve never bought?’
Believe me, it is possible. Here are some examples:
» Lots of my clients sell their time. They create an item called Labour and price it 
with their hourly rate.
» I’ve set up MYOB for heaps of gyms and clubs that charge membership fees. 
They set up annual subscriptions in their Items list, creating different items 
with different prices for each membership type.
» Airbnb, caravan parks and holiday rentals often create items for Nightly Rates, 
Weekend Rates, Linen Hire, Cleaning and so on, which can all be set up as 
items.
By the way, I talk more about setting up items for services at the beginning of 
Chapter 4.
When you buy something but don’t sell it
Sometimes you only want something in your Items list so that you can produce 
purchase orders. Lots of things fall into this category  — for example, office 
stationery, packaging for sending out goods, or miscellaneous manufacturing 
supplies, such as rags, oil or gas. For these types of items, only tick the box I Buy 
This Item.
Telling things where to go
Whenever you create a new item, you must select the corresponding income, cost 
of sales and inventory accounts. Be careful when selecting these accounts though, 
because your choice ultimately affects both your Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet 
reports.
Income accounts
If you tick I Sell This Item when you create a new item, you’re prompted to select 
an Income account. Jump in and select whatever income account best relates to 
this item. If you don’t yet have a suitable account, create it via your Chart of 
Accounts.250 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
For example, a client of mine is a mechanic who specialises in car restorations, so 
his Items list includes lots of different motor vehicle parts for the services the 
business provides. Every item in his Items list links to one of three income 
accounts: Mechanical Service, Parts Income or Restorations Income.
Creating several income accounts in your Chart of Accounts usually works well so 
that you can track your different revenue sources (though don’t get too carried 
away!). By linking items back to these different accounts, you can see at a glance 
in your Profit and Loss report how much revenue each kind of item (or service) 
generates. Chapter  2 covers everything you need to know about creating new 
accounts in your Chart of Accounts.
Cost of sales and expense accounts
If you tick I Buy This Item (but you don’t click I Track Stock for This Item), you 
need to select an expense account for tracking purchases.
For items that you keep in stock, the simplest method is to have a single cost of 
sales account called Cost of Goods Sold. A more complex approach is to create sev￾eral cost of goods sold accounts, with each one corresponding to an equivalent 
income account. (Either method is okay; ask your accountant if you’re not sure.)
For non-inventory items, the account you choose depends on what the item is. For 
example, an item called Stationery probably hooks up to an Expense account like 
Printing and Stationery expenses. An item for purchasing workshop materials for 
my mechanic friend (things like rags, grease wash and kitty litter to soak up the 
oil spills) probably hooks up to a Cost of Sales account, such as Workshop Con￾sumables (as shown in Figure 10-2).
Inventory accounts
If you tick I Track Stock for This Item when you create a new item, you’re prompted 
to select an Inventory account.
If you’re using the Inventory module, you have ten items you can track and try out 
before you need to upgrade your subscription to include unlimited inventory.
Don’t get tied up creating lots of different inventory accounts. You only need one 
inventory account to keep track of the stock you have on hand. Surprisingly 
enough, this account is called Inventory and you find it sitting in the Assets sec￾tion of your Chart of Accounts. The balance of your Inventory account will appear 
in your Balance Sheet.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 251
Entering opening stock counts
After you have set up names, descriptions and selling prices for all your items, 
you’re ready to record how many units you have on hand for each item, as well as 
the cost of each item. (Obviously, you only need to do this for items where you 
want to track the quantity you have on hand.) I explain this process in detail in 
Chapter 3, which covers everything you need to know about opening balances.
Taking things an extra step
In many situations, you’ll find that adding item IDs, descriptions, prices and 
quantities is enough information for most items. However, MYOB does provide 
room for a little more additional information in the Restocking Information sec￾tion, including minimum stock levels per item, primary suppliers and default 
reorder quantities.
If you add minimum stock levels, you can run a regular Reorder Report and auto￾create purchase orders when stock gets low. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Go to your Items list and click the Item ID for an item you want to reorder 
automatically.
2. Scroll down to Restocking Information and enter the Minimum Stock 
Level.
Think about how low you’re prepared to let stock fall before you buy more. For 
example, if you know you always want to keep at least ten units in stock, enter 
10 as the Minimum Stock Level.
FIGURE 10-2:
You can set up 
items for things 
you order 
from suppliers, 
even if you don’t 
resell them.252 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
3. Enter the supplier’s name in the Primary Supplier for Reorders field.
Enter the usual supplier for this item. It doesn’t matter if you occasionally buy 
this item from someone else.
4. Enter the quantity you normally order as the Default Reorder Quantity.
If you normally order 20 of these items at a time, enter 20 as your Default 
Reorder Quantity. This means that when your stock falls below minimum 
levels, you can use the Reorder Report to automatically create a purchase 
order.
5. Repeat this process for every item you want to create automatic 
purchase orders for.
With minimum quantities and primary suppliers set, you’re ready to generate 
your first Reorder Report:
1. Go to your Inventory menu and select Reorder Low Stock Items.
The Reorder Report opens, similar to Figure 10-3, listing every item that you 
have in stock which has fallen below its specified minimum stock level. This 
report also shows, for each of these items, how many units you have on hand, 
how many units you currently have on order, how many units are already 
committed to customers and suggested order quantities.
You can click the Customise button to add or remove columns from this report 
so it meets your specific reporting needs. (Chapter 15 talks about customising 
reports.)
2. Click against each item that you would like to reorder.
Don’t worry — if you have the same Primary Supplier for more than one item, 
MYOB combines these items into a single purchase order.
3. Click Create Purchase Order.
Blink and you’ll miss it. The items you’ve just ordered disappear from the 
report. Look carefully however and at the top of the screen you’ll see a 
message ‘The following purchase orders were successfully created’ with 
a link to the purchase order(s) just created.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 253
4. Click the Purchase Order number to view, check or edit your purchase 
order.
You can also view auto-generated purchase orders by selecting Purchase 
Orders from the Purchases menu. Note that you can easily edit quantities or 
line items in your purchase orders at this point. Chapter 8 covers purchase 
orders in more detail.
Giving Your Items List the Once-Over
Regardless of whether your Items list is short or long, it needs a certain amount 
of tender loving care. In the next few sections, I provide the ultimate set of care 
instructions, explaining not only how to find items, but also how to edit items, 
delete items and view item transactions.
Finding item descriptions and details
To find an item, head to the Items list (go to Inventory → Items) and try these 
tactics:
» Search for a string of text: In the Search field, type any of the letters or 
numbers of the Item ID or the item’s Name. You can even search for a price if 
you know it.
» Filter by item type: From the Item Type menu, refine your search to select 
Items I Sell, Items I Buy or Items I Inventory.
» Sort your Items list in a way that makes sense to you: An alternative 
approach is to click any of the column labels to sort by that category. For 
example, if I click at the top of the Name column (actually clicking the label 
‘Name’ itself), then I can sort by that column.
FIGURE 10-3:
The Reorder 
Report shows 
current stock 
levels, and you 
can reorder easily 
by creating a 
purchase order 
direct from this 
report.254 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
» Create a custom report: If you’re one of those people who prefer printed 
lists (old habits die hard), then go to Reporting → Reports, skip to the 
Inventory tab, and print the handy Item List report (or export the report to 
Excel). You can also customise this report to add or remove columns.
Viewing item transaction details 
with the Items Register report
Occasionally, you may feel that something isn’t adding up right with your stock 
numbers, so you need to see where things may have gone wrong. Perhaps in the 
last stocktake you made an adjustment for 20 packets of Gummy Bears but in fact 
it was 30.
To figure out where you went wrong, go to Reporting → Reports, go to the Inven￾tory tab and click the Items Register report. This report shows transactions relat￾ing to a particular item (including stock counts and adjustments). You can click 
the Items button at the top to filter by a specific item or specific group of items, 
and you can also enter a date range to narrow this report.
Click Expand All and the Items Register report displays every sale, purchase and 
inventory adjustment for selected items, as shown in Figure 10-4 with my Gummy 
Bears. You can then click into the Reference Number on any transaction to view it 
in all its glory.
FIGURE 10-4:
The Items 
Register report 
displays every 
sale, purchase 
and inventory 
transaction.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 255
Changing items
Most item changes are easy as pie. All you have to do is locate the item in your 
Items list, click the Item ID and make your changes.
The only change that sometimes proves difficult is if you want to change the I 
Buy, I Sell or I Track selections. For example, if you have an item that already has 
purchases or sales on file, and you want to unclick I Track Stock for This Item, 
then you’ll get a message saying you can’t.
Don’t feel defeated. If you can’t change an item in the way that you want to, make 
that item inactive by clicking the Inactive Item button, just under the Item 
ID.  Then create an all-singing, all-dancing new item that’s just the way you 
want it.
Deleting items
To delete an item, look for it in your Items list and click it to display the item’s 
details, then down to the bottom left click the Delete button.
No luck? If you already have invoices or purchases for this item in your company 
file, a warning appears stating you can’t delete this item as it has an audit history. 
If this happens to you, your best bet is to make this item inactive (inactive items 
don’t display if you look up items when recording sales or purchases transactions).
If at some point you wish to re-instate the item, simply filter to display inactive 
items within your Items list, click into it and unclick the Inactive checkbox.
Managing Inventory
MYOB manages inventory using the perpetual inventory system approach, which 
means that MYOB updates stock quantities in real time after each sale, purchase 
and inventory adjustment. As a result, your reporting allows you to see the quan￾tity and value of stock on hand at any point in time, which helps you manage your 
stock levels efficiently.
If your business buys and sells items, chances are that managing your inventory 
well is a cornerstone to your business success. In the next few pages, I look at 
pricing your inventory and reporting for stock control. (The nearby sidebar ‘The 
power of average cost value’ elaborates on some of the ways the perpetual inven￾tory system approach can help you make good business decisions regarding 
inventory.)256 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Pricing to sell
Whether it’s a market price, standard price, retail price, wholesale price, discount 
price, list price, fee for a service, flat charge or some other exotic beast, the time 
has come to price your goods.
So, here I explain how to price a single item, as well as how to price a whole lot of 
items at once. Here goes:
» Pricing one item at a time. If you need to change the price of an item, find it 
in your Items list, click the Item ID, change the selling price and click Save. 
(Remember to check whether the item is marked as Tax Inclusive or Tax 
Exclusive. If your item is Tax Inclusive, you must include GST in your sell￾ing price.)
» Pricing lots of items in one hit. If you’ve raised prices across the board for 
lots of items in your inventory, it can take ages to work through them one 
at a time. The quickest way to fix up a whole host of price changes may be to 
export your Items out of your company file as an Excel file (you do this from 
the Import and Export Data menu under your company name). You can then 
open this file in Excel, where you can calculate and enter the new prices.
Don’t change any of the headers when you edit the file in Excel, as the next 
step is to import the spreadsheet back into your file.
In order to import this data into your MYOB company file, you’ll need to use 
the Save As function in Excel to create a tab-delimited text (*.txt) file. The 
Import and Export Data menu can be found under the Settings. I recommend 
you ask your accountant or bookkeeper to assist here as the process can be a 
little tricky.
Reporting to stay on top of stock control
The kinds of reports you’ll need for inventory are going to vary depending on the 
nature of your business. However, start by going to Reporting → Reports, then 
going to the Inventory tab and checking out the following reports:
» Reorder report. A regular review of this report helps you keep an eye on your 
stock levels, giving you a good picture of how many items are on order and 
how many items have been committed to customers. The earlier section 
‘Taking things an extra step’ guides you through reordering stock direct from 
this report.CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 257
» Stock on Hand report. This report gives you a snapshot of your inventory 
quantities, minus units committed to sales plus units on order. I like this 
report as it gives me the total value of the stock I’m holding (which in turn 
helps me decide if I need to reduce prices or hold a sale to shift lingering 
stock). This report also calculates the average cost of each item (turn to the 
nearby sidebar ‘The power of average cost value’ for more on this useful 
metric).
» Item Sales Analysis report. This report analyses the profitability of your sales 
per item according to how much it costs (on average) and how much you sold 
it for (see Figure 10-5). Regularly reviewing this report will reveal which items 
are underperforming and which are your sales stars. Use this report to guide 
your sales and purchasing decisions — you may realise you need to find 
another supplier or increase your sales price for certain items to help increase 
your profit margin.
» Items Register report. Use this report to see all the inventory items you’ve 
used in transactions within a specified date range. With this report, you’ll be 
able to see all the sales, purchases and inventory adjustments that have 
affected the on-hand quantities and current value of your inventoried items. 
View in summary or expand for more detail.

Fixing Things When Stuff Goes Wrong
When lots of people have their fingers in the sales-and-purchases pie of inven￾tory, it’s not surprising that inventory costs or counts sometimes go completely 
out of whack. However, you can make inventory adjustments to fix things up.
THE POWER OF AVERAGE COST VALUE
MYOB tracking inventory using the perpetual inventory system approach, and the value 
of this inventory is tracked using the average cost method, which means that the value of 
your inventory is calculated by averaging the cost to your business for each item you 
hold using the following formula:
Total Item Value/Total Number of Items = Average Cost.
For example, if you buy ten packets of gummy bears for $10.00, the average cost is 
$1.00 per item. However, if you place another order for ten packets of gummy bears the 
next day and they cost you $15.00 (an average cost of $1.50 per item — ouch!) then you 
have 20 packets that cost a total of $25.00, so your average cost overall increases to 
$1.25 per item.
Apart from the purchases, the only other thing that will affect the calculation of average 
cost is inventory adjustments that change the value of how much stock you hold with￾out adjusting the quantity. (For more on this, see ‘Adjusting the cost of an item’ later in 
this chapter.)
When you record a purchase of inventory, this increases the value of your inventory 
asset account. When you create a sales invoice and sell this item, MYOB reduces the 
value of your inventory asset and debits this same value from the linked Cost of Sales 
account.
To see this process in action, look at the changes in your Balance Sheet and Profit and 
Loss reports when you next purchase an item, and then when you next sell an item. 
When you purchase an item, this will show as an increase to your inventory asset in 
your Balance Sheet (and also as an increase to the amount you owe suppliers). When 
you sell an item, the value of your inventory will decrease in your Balance Sheet, and the 
corresponding value will show as an increase in Cost of Sales in your Profit and Loss.
Yes, it is technical, but if you can understand this concept you are halfway to truly mas￾tering your inventory using MYOB — kudos to you!CHAPTER 10 Managing Items 259
When working with any inventory adjustment, never select Inventory as your 
expense account or adjustment account. This throws your reports out of whack; 
even though it feels like the natural place for it to go, don’t do it!
Proceed with caution when adjusting inventory because your changes may impact 
your reporting and could even have tax implications. I recommend you check the 
average cost of items on a monthly or quarterly basis using the Items List report 
(go to the Inventory tab under Reporting → Reports) to ensure all figures are 
correct. Skip ahead to ‘Adjusting the cost of an item’ if you find something has 
gone awry.
Adjusting the quantity of an item
What do you do if you once had three mega lollypops on the shelf, but you know 
an overenthusiastic child dropped them on the floor, smashing them into sugary 
pieces? Or perhaps you can see that you’ve completely sold out of chocolate but￾tons but your Items list says you have five packets left?
Follow these steps to correct your stock quantities:
1. Go to Inventory → Create Inventory Adjustment.
The Adjust Inventory window appears, numbered with the next available 
Inventory Journal Number.
2. Enter the Date of the adjustment and the Transaction Description.
Enter today’s date and describe why you are creating this adjustment.
3. Select your item by typing the Item ID if you know it or find it by clicking 
the drop-down arrow in the Item ID column.
The transaction line prefills with the Current quantity and the Unit Cost ($) 
(that is, the average cost).
4. Enter the adjustment number in the Adjustment column.
Enter the quantity (either a positive number to increase stock or a negative 
number to decrease stock) in the Adjustment column, then ensure the New on 
Hand column’s value matches your true stock quantity (that is, the Current plus 
Adjustment amount).
The Amount ($) column shows the dollar value of the adjustment: Adjustment 
column value × Unit Cost ($) value (see Figure 10-6). This value is useful because 
it shows how much the adjustment has ‘cost’ you (for example, if it is a negative 
adjustment for say spoilage, theft or damage).260 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
5. Select the account you want to allocate the costs to in the Account 
column.
Often, the account will be a Cost of Sales or an Expense account that best fits 
the reason for the adjustment. For example, you can allocate the cost of the 
damaged mega lollypops from earlier to an Expense account called Damaged 
Stock (if you don’t have a suitable account, create one now — refer to 
Chapter 2 if you require further guidance on this).
Click the i (information) near the Item ID and it pops up with added info that 
may be useful to check, such as the quantity of this item currently on order 
(see Figure 10-6).
6. Optional: Add a Job if needed by clicking the drop-down arrow in the Job 
field.
If you are tracking Jobs, you can enter this here as well. Chapter 17 talks more 
about Jobs.
7. Optional: Add text to the Memo field to explain why you are making this 
adjustment.
Adding a Memo (see Figure 10-6 for some examples) is useful so that in 
12 months’ time when you are looking back at your reports, you can recall 
why you adjusted this stock item. (I struggle to remember what I had for dinner 
last night, so forget a month ago — let alone 12 months!) You can also use the 
Memo field to add specifics about the line item.
Although you can fit an essay in the Memo field, only the first seven words or 
so appear on your reports.
FIGURE 10-6:

8. Check that you’re happy with the Adjust Inventory journal and click Save.
Make sure that everything on the screen makes sense to you and looks correct, 
then click Save.
Adjusting the cost of an item
As you work toward mastering inventory, you may make many mistakes along the 
way, especially in the beginning.
There’s no quick explanation for why, one day, you look up the average cost of an 
item and it’s completely bizarre. You know that a box of marshmallows doesn’t 
cost $1,000 and that sherbet lemons cost you more than $0.20, but suddenly your 
Items list says that this is the case. Don’t con yourself into thinking MYOB has 
made a mistake — the cause is always human error, somewhere!
One way to fix unit costs (that is, the average cost) is to go to your Items Register 
report, select the item in question, expand the report to show the detail for this 
item, and double-check the cost price for every purchase you’ve made for that 
item. You can view each purchase by clicking the purple Reference Number for a 
particular item. Hopefully, you’ll then see where the mistake is so you can fix it 
from there.
An alternative approach that’s more practical if you have lots of purchases to look 
through is simply to fix the average cost so that it’s correct moving forward. 
Here’s how:
1. Calculate the difference between what the average cost should be and 
what is displaying in MYOB.
For example, if you know a box of marshmallows costs $40 to buy but the unit 
cost comes up as $50, then the difference per box of marshmallows is $10.
2. Go to Inventory → Items and find the Item in question.
Once you have located the Item, look at how many of the Item you have on 
hand (in stock).
3. Multiply the quantity you have on hand by the difference in unit cost.
For example, if I had 20 boxes of marshmallows in stock, I’d multiply $10 (that’s 
the difference in cost price per unit) by 20 (that’s the number of units I have on 
hand) to arrive at $200.
4. Go to Inventory → Create Inventory Adjustment.262 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
5. Enter the Date of the adjustment and a meaningful Transaction 
Description.
Use the Transaction Description field to describe what you are doing (adjusting 
the inventory value), and use the Memo field to explain why you’re adjusting 
the inventory value. If someone asks you about this adjustment months later, 
you can justify your actions if required (see Figure 10-7 for an example).
6. Select your item by typing the Item ID if you know it, or find it by clicking 
the drop-down arrow in the Item ID column.
The transaction line prefills with the Current quantity and the Unit Cost ($) (that 
is, the average cost).
7. Leave the Adjustment column set to 0, adjust the Unit Cost ($) column to 
0 and enter your total dollar difference in the Amount ($) column.
Figure 10-7 shows how your inventory adjustment should look. The dollar 
difference should be the amount you calculated in Step 3.
8. Select an expense account for this adjustment.
Either select the Cost of Sales account that this item normally goes to, or select 
a Stock Adjustments account, if you have one.
9. Click Save.
Yay, great job! To double-check your efforts (very good practice with inventory 
adjustments), go to Reporting → Reports, move to the Inventory tab and open 
the Item List report. Look for the item you just adjusted and check that the new 
Average Cost is now correct.

Stocktaking for Success
In my student days, whenever there was a stocktake at the warehouse I worked at, 
heaps of people would mysteriously phone in sick that day. I never understood 
why until my third stocktake, when I realised I’d had enough of the endless count￾ing involved. However, since becoming a bookkeeper I’ve developed a whole new 
appreciation for the value of a stocktake.
Prepare yourself (and your staff) for the day by making your way to your Reports 
page (Reporting → Reports), going to the Inventory tab and exporting to Excel one 
of the following reports:
» The Stock on Hand report
» The Items List report
Open the file in Excel and add an additional column for your counted stock on the 
day. Excel is great because you can create an extra column to calculate the required 
adjustment between the Units on Hand according to MYOB and the actual units 
according to your count. (And don’t forget you’ll need plenty of good lollies as 
rewards for your team as the count wears on!)
As you do your stocktake, keep an eye open for any item counts that look odd, or 
where they’re significantly different from what you should have — you can see 
how much you should have by referring to the Units on Hand column.
On the face of it, entering stock counts after you complete the stocktake is pretty 
simple. Head to the Inventory menu and select Create Inventory Adjustment to 
adjust your stock counts to reflect your actual figures (refer to ‘Adjusting the 
quantity of an item’ earlier in this chapter for more details). Don’t forget to ensure 
your date is correct and to add extra detail in the all-important Memo field.
Here are a few tips to make sure things go swimmingly when doing your stocktake:
» Avoid confusion. Before starting your stocktake, make sure you finalise all 
pending sales, and enter supplier bills for all goods that have already been 
received in the warehouse. If possible, avoid recording any sales or receiving 
goods until the stocktake is complete.
» Be clear about what you need to count. Make sure you allow for goods in 
transit, goods on consignment, and goods in delivery vans or in other 
locations.264 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
» Take bite-sized chunks. Only enter counts for say 20 items at a time. It’s 
easier to see what you’re doing this way, and if you (or your computer) do 
something silly, you won’t lose too much work in one hit.
» Think carefully about where you allocate the difference. When prompted 
for a Default Expense Account, allocate the difference to a special Cost of 
Sales account called Stocktake Adjustments.
» Never select Inventory as your Default Expense Account. If you do, you’ll 
cause your inventory control account to go out of balance.
» Get the date right. If you do a stocktake on 30 June, date the journal 30 June. 
(Even if you enter the stock counts a week later, this must be the date — 
otherwise, nothing makes sense in your financial reports.)
» Double-check at the end. When you’re done, generate an Inventory Value 
Reconciliation report for the stocktake date and compare the final counts with 
your stock count sheets. This way you can spot if you’ve made a blunder.
» Make sure your inventory account balances. Skip to Chapter 18 to find 
out how.
» Keep records in a safe place. In the final wash-up, staple your original 
Inventory Count pages and your final Inventory Value Reconciliation report 
together (or scan them to a PDF for your records). Keeping good records is 
best practice should anyone come back with questions about your stock 
levels.
Balancing Your Inventory
In a perfect world, the total cost value of the items in your Items list needs to bal￾ance with the value of your Inventory Asset account in your Balance Sheet. For 
example, if you only had two items in stock — a chocolate fountain that cost $300 
and a water fountain that cost $700 — then not only should the total value of your 
Items Value Reconciliation report be $1,000, but the balance of your Inventory 
Asset account should also be the same ($1,000).
To find out more about making sure your inventory balances — as well as what to 
do if it doesn’t — skip ahead to Chapter 18.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 265
Chapter 11
Setting Up Payroll
Setting up payroll and keeping track of employee pays, entitlements, compli￾ance and reporting is probably the most technical aspect of working with 
MYOB. As well as understanding how to process transactions, you need to 
have some insight into employee awards, pay rates, how superannuation is calcu￾lated, and more.
The secret to meeting your legal obligations as an employer, and paying employ￾ees correctly, is to get the setup spot on. In this chapter, I walk you through get￾ting started one step at a time, from creating employees in MYOB to connecting 
Single Touch Payroll (STP). By the time you’ve worked through this chapter, your 
MYOB file will be ready to process pay runs (which I cover in Chapter 12). Reading 
this chapter may not be the most enthralling way to spend a sunny afternoon, but 
my goal is to minimise your pain and maximise your gain.
The information I share in this chapter (and Chapter  12) is general in nature, 
focusing on how MYOB helps you comply with your payroll obligations. Whatever 
your role, if you’re responsible for processing payroll then the onus is on you to 
understand employees’ awards, Fair Work legislation, superannuation legislation 
and any relevant state-based employee legislation. If you’re at all unsure about 
any of the payroll setup I describe in this chapter, do employ professional advice 
to ensure your payroll obligations are fully met.

Touch Payroll (STP)

Getting the Baseline Right
Before setting up your first employee, the first step is to review your Payroll Set￾tings and linked accounts.
If your payroll setup is already complete (maybe you’re in a new role as a book￾keeper, but MYOB is already up and running), you could skip ahead to ‘Adding a 
New Employee’ a little later in this chapter but ideally, regardless of your starting 
point, I suggest you double-check any Payroll Settings you’ve inherited before you 
begin.
Reviewing your Payroll Settings
To review your Payroll Settings:
1. Go to Settings → Payroll Settings.
The General Payroll Information tab of the Payroll Settings page appears.
2. Enter your Full-Time Employee Weekly Hours.
Look up your award if you’re not sure about how many hours this should be.
(An award is a legal ruling which grants all employees in one industry the same
conditions of employment and wages. For more info about awards, head to
fairwork.gov.au.)
The National Employment Standards (NES; as per Fair Work, the NES are 11
minimum employment entitlements that have to be provided to all employees)
stipulate that 38 hours is the maximum number of hours in a regular week, but
some awards specify fewer hours. If you have multiple awards within your
business, check the award or agreement that relates to the majority of your
employees.
3. Select your Default Superannuation Fund.
If all your employees already have a super fund, you can safely skip this step.
However, in theory, employers are meant to set up a default superannuation
fund for employees who don’t belong to a fund; employers are also meant to
include details of this default fund on the Superannuation Standard Choice
Form provided to employees when they start employment.
4. Optional: Tick the Use Timesheets to Track Employee Hours checkbox.
You only need to tick this option if you intend to use the MYOB Team app or
MYOB’s timesheets for logging employee start and finish times. (If you don’t 
need to record timesheets, or you already have a different system for record￾ing employee timesheets and prefer to stick with that, then it’s fine to skip this 
option.) Chapter 13 talks more about timesheets and MYOB Team.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 267
5. Click Save.
You may notice I haven’t mentioned the Withholder Payer Number field or 
Cents to Round Net Pay field. That’s okay — simply leave these fields blank.
6. Go to the Superannuation Funds tab, which is the next tab on the Payroll 
Settings page.
If you have super fund details at hand for any of your employees, click Create 
Super Fund to add these now. Otherwise, it’s easy to add super fund details 
later, when you add employees. See ‘Entering employee rates and other 
details’ later in this chapter for more about adding super funds.
7. Go to the Employment Classification tab, which is the next tab on the 
Payroll Settings page.
MYOB already has Construction Worker Level classifications by default (for the 
Building and Construction award), which is a tad confusing for everyone not 
working in construction! Feel free to get rid of these by clicking through to each 
one and clicking Delete.
8. Optional: For each award relevant to your business, click Create 
Classification and enter the name of this award.
If you pay any employees under an award, add the names of each award 
applicable. This way, you can ensure the award classification appears on every 
pay slip, which is a legal obligation for all employees paid under an award. 
(If none of your employees are on an award, you can safely skip this step.)
9. Go to the Pay Slip Email Defaults tab.
This is the final tab on the Payroll Settings page.
10. Optional: Set the default Subject and Message in the Pay Slip Email 
Defaults section.
11. Enter the Reply-To Email Address and the corresponding From Name.
Whatever you enter as the email address here will become the email address 
MYOB uses for all emails sent, including for invoices and quotes.
12. Click Save.
Well done! And now, with this step complete, it’s time to check your linked 
payroll accounts. Lead on, Macduff . . .
Checking linked accounts
Linked accounts provide a road map for MYOB Business, ensuring transactions 
end up in the right spot every time.268 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
To check your linked accounts:
1. Go to Accounting → Manage Linked Accounts. Click the Payroll tab.
Your Payroll Linked Accounts appear, similar to Figure 11-1.
2. Review your payroll bank accounts.
The first three accounts relate to how you pay your employees. Usually, you 
select Payroll Clearing as the Bank Account for Cash Payments, your regular 
business account as the Bank Account for Cheque Payments, and Electronic 
Clearing as the Bank Account for Electronic Payments. (‘Completing payment 
details’, later in this chapter, explains more about employee payment settings.)
3. Ensure the Default Employer Expense Account is linked to an expense 
account called Superannuation.
Ensure that this account is an expense account starting with the number 6. You 
don’t want to select Superannuation Payable here (which is a liability account).
4. Ensure the Default Wages Expense Account is linked to an expense 
account called Wages.
This account may also be called Salaries or something similar. The main thing 
is that you choose an expense account here.
5. Check the Default Tax/Deductions Payable Account is linked to a liability 
account called PAYG Withholding Payable.
6. Click Save when you are happy with your linked accounts.
Setting Up Pay Items
Before you can make your first pay run (which I will get to in Chapter 12), you need 
to configure your pay items correctly. In this next section, I explain how to con￾figure pay items for wages, leave and superannuation.
FIGURE 11-1:
Checking your 
Payroll Linked 
Accounts are 
correctly 
configured.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 269
Creating wage pay items
Wage pay items cover everything you pay to your employees — salaries, holiday 
pay, personal leave, allowances, penalty loadings, bonuses and so on. Every type 
of payment you make to an employee links to its own pay item.
Your Pay Items list comes well stocked with lots of categories. These default pay 
items fit the bill for most businesses, but you may want to add a few, especially if 
your employees receive shift loadings, unusual penalty rates or allowances. Here’s 
what to do:
1. Go to Payroll → Pay Items.
This opens the Pay Items page, which shows the default pay items already 
available to you.
2. Click Create Wage Pay Item.
The Create Wage Pay Item page appears.
3. Name the pay item.
You can name the pay item as you see fit, such as Overtime, Leave Loading 
or Tool Allowance. You can also enter a different name that will display on 
employee pay slips for this pay item.
You need to add a different name for family and domestic violence leave 
because as per legislation it must show on pay slips as a regular pay item, 
as confidentiality is particularly important in this instance to protect the staff 
member.
4. Select an ATO Reporting Category from the drop-down field.
Choosing the correct category here is one of the most important things you 
need to get right before connecting STP. See ‘Making sense of ATO reporting 
categories’ later in this chapter for more information.
5. Choose between Salary or Hourly as the Pay Basis.
For a fixed amount salary that employees receive each pay run, pick Salary 
as the Pay Basis. For wages payments based on the number of hours worked 
(in particular, for part-time and casual employees, where pay includes other 
pay items, such as overtime or penalty rates), choose Hourly.
6. If you choose Hourly, select how you want to calculate the Pay Rate.
If you opt for a Fixed Hourly Rate, only enter a rate if this rate will be the same 
for all employees (which isn’t often). If different employees have different pay 
rates, leave this field blank. (You can enter specific rates for each employee 
when you set up standard pays — see ‘Creating standard pay templates’ 
later in this chapter for more details.)270 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
If you opt for Regular Rate Multiplied By, add the multiplier in the second field. 
For example, enter the number 2 in the field for double-time, or enter 0.175 for 
leave loading calculated at 17.5 per cent.
7. Optional: If you want these wages to be reported to a separate account 
code, click Override Employees’ Wage Expense Account and select your 
preferred account.
Selecting this option enables you to report this wage pay item separately on 
your Profit and Loss report. For example, instead of including motor vehicle 
allowances as part of your Wage Expenses account, you can click this override 
account option in the Motor Vehicle Allowance pay item and then link this to an 
expense account called Motor Vehicle Allowance. This allowance will then 
appear as a separate line in your Profit and Loss report.
This function may be useful for separating specific wages categories such as 
allowances on financial reports, but if you wish to separate different employee 
categories on your Profit and Loss reports (for example, separating Management 
Wages from Production Wages), you’re best to do this in the Wages Expense 
account under the Wages & Salaries sub-tab for each employee.
8. Optional: Click Automatically Adjust Base Hourly or Base Salary Details.
This option is useful for pay items such as Annual Leave Pay or Personal Leave 
Pay because it helps to prevent the doubling-up of pay hours. For example, 
imagine your full-time employee weekly hours are set to 38. If an employee is 
off sick one day and you enter 7.6 hours for Personal Leave Pay when process￾ing the pay run, MYOB will adjust the employee’s base hours to 30.4 for that 
week without you having to do anything.
9. Optional: Add Employees to the wage pay item.
I tend not to add employees at this stage as I find it easier to select the correct 
pay items when I get to the stage of reviewing the settings for each employee.
10. Select the relevant categories if this pay item is exempt from any 
deductions or tax.
The most likely exemption is PAYG Withholding. Do check with your accoun￾tant, but wage pay items usually exempt from PAYG include reimbursements 
to employees for out-of-pocket expenses, or motor vehicle allowances paid as 
cents per kilometre reimbursements.
11. Ask yourself whether Superannuation Guarantee is payable on this 
wage item.
You don’t need to pay super on every category of wages but rather, you only 
pay super on what’s called Ordinary Time Earnings. If you think this new wage 
item may not be included in the definition of Ordinary Time Earnings, skip to 
‘Double-checking super pay items’ later in this chapter.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 271
12. Save your fantastic work.
You return to the Pay Items list, where you can check the new pay item 
appears.
Reviewing leave items
If you have any employees who are paid on a full-time or a part-time basis (as 
opposed to being casuals), you need to ensure your leave pay items are set up 
correctly.
Employees paid on an hourly basis
For employees paid on an hourly basis, regardless of whether they are full-time or 
part-time, here’s how to review their leave settings:
1. Go to Payroll → Pay Items and skip to the Leave tab.
You should see several default leave items displayed.
2. Click the Annual Leave Full Time Hourly pay item (for annual leave) or the 
Personal Leave Full Time Hourly pay item (for personal leave).
Or, if you have part-time employees who are paid hourly, click the Annual 
Leave Part Time Hourly or Personal Leave Part Time Hourly pay items.
3. Review the Leave Information settings.
The Calculation Basis should be Equals a Percentage of Wages and be based 
on a Percent of Gross Hours.
For employees who receive four weeks of annual leave and two weeks of 
personal leave per year (or pro-rata for part-time employees), the percentage 
should be 7.6923 per cent for annual leave and 3.84615 for personal leave.
How do these figures arise? A quick calculation is all you need (you know I love 
my maths!). For example, if annual leave is four weeks and each week is 38 
hours, and you are looking for the percentage of wages based on 52 weeks of 
the year:
38 × 4 = 152 hours
152 ÷ (38 × 52) × 100 = 7.6923%
These percentages are the minimum legal requirements in Australia. However, 
some awards go above these minimum entitlements, so do double-check your 
award or agreement first.272 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
4. Under Leave Exemptions, review any wages pay items exempt from 
accruing leave.
Employees don’t accrue leave on miscellaneous payments such as allowances, 
annual leave loading, bonuses, overtime or reimbursements, so take care to 
select these categories as exemptions. However, note that Annual Leave Pay 
and Personal Leave Pay should not be included under leave exemptions.
5. Click Carry Remaining Leave to Next Year and Show Leave Balance on 
Pay Slips.
Fair Work requires that you show annual leave balances on all employee pay 
slips, so don’t unclick this option. However, you may prefer to unclick Show 
Leave Balance on Pay Slips for Personal Leave to avoid reminding employees 
of the amount of personal leave owing on every pay slip.
6. Check the Linked Wage Pay Items are correct.
Annual Leave Accrual should be linked to Annual Leave Pay; Personal Leave 
Accrual should be linked to Personal Leave Pay. If they’re not, change 
them now.
7. Optional: Select any employees who receive this leave.
I prefer not to select employees here, and instead configure all payroll 
categories individually when setting up each employee.
8. Click Save.
By now, your leave item should look similar to Figure 11-2.
Employees paid on a salaried basis
If you have any employees who receive a salary, rather than being paid by the 
hour, the instructions for setting up leave are pretty much the same as in the pre￾ceding section but with two differences:
» Instead of reviewing the Full Time Hourly and Part Time Hourly pay items, you 
need to review the Full Time Salary pay items.
» The Calculation Basis should be Equals Hours Per Pay Period, and for 
employees receiving four weeks annual leave per year who work 38 hours per 
week, the Hours Per Year should be 152. (That’s 4 multiplied by 38, in case 
you’re wondering.) For employees receiving two weeks’ personal leave per 
year who work 38 hours per week, the Hours Per Year should be 76.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 273
Double-checking super pay items
In order to be certain that superannuation calculates and accrues correctly, you 
should double-check the configuration of your Superannuation Guarantee pay 
item. Here’s how:
1. Go to Payroll → Pay Items and click the Superannuation tab.
2. Click the Superannuation Guarantee pay item and check the Linked 
Accounts are correct.
At the time of writing, the Linked Payable Account is set incorrectly to PAYG 
Withholding in new MYOB company files. You will need to rectify this. The 
Linked Expense Account should be Superannuation Expense (and should start 
with the number 6) and the Linked Payable Account should be Superannuation 
Payable (and start with the number 2).
FIGURE 11-2:

exemptions to 
the default 
Annual Leave Full 
Time Hourly 
accrual pay item.274 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
3. Ensure that Print on Pay Slip is clicked.
Fair Work requires that you report superannuation on all employee pay slips.
4. Select Minimum Required Rate as the Calculation Basis.
Don’t worry that you can’t edit this rate: MYOB will automatically update the 
minimum rate each year if required, based on federal legislation.
If your employees receive more than the minimum rate, as negotiated in many 
agreements and some awards, you will need to create an additional Super 
Guarantee pay item. Ask advice from your accountant if this applies.
5. Optional: Set a limit.
For high-earning employees, the ATO specifies a quarterly limit beyond which 
superannuation is not compulsory (in 2023/24 this limit is $62,270 per quarter).
6. Save your precious dollars, and add Exemptions for all wage pay items for 
which you don’t have to pay super.
The trick is this: Superannuation Guarantee is only due on what is termed 
Ordinary Time Earnings (OTE). You can find resources on the ATO’s website 
regarding what is considered OTE, but at the time of writing, you don’t have to 
pay super on the following wage pay items: Allowances, annual leave loading, 
employee advances, some overtime payments, and unused leave.
7. Check your work and click Save.
Figure 11-3 shows the correct set up for your Superannuation Guarantee 
pay item.

Adding a New Employee
In this next section, I explain how to add a new employee into MYOB. This process 
can feel quite daunting the first time around, but in the next few pages of this 
chapter, I explain everything you need to know.
Inviting employees onboard
You have two options in MYOB when it comes to setting up new employees:
» Employee Self-Onboarding: This process provides the ideal way to collect 
employee information in a secure manner. You simply ask MYOB to send 
new employees a link to a ‘self-onboarding form’. The employees click the link 
to complete their contact, tax and superannuation fund details. Once the 
employee submits this information, MYOB creates the employee in your file, 
prefilling all the details supplied by this employee.
I explain how Employee Self-Onboarding works in the next section ‘Taking a 
break from the heavy lifting’.
DEALING WITH OTHER KINDS OF SUPER
Do you deduct super from an employee’s pay under a salary sacrifice arrangement or 
do you pay employer superannuation (that is, super above the minimum rate)? If so, 
you need to ensure that the pay items for Salary Sacrifice and Employer Additional 
Superannuation are configured correctly in MYOB.
Head to Pay Items, click the Superannuation tab, and click the relevant pay item. For 
both Salary Sacrifice and Employer Additional Superannuation, ensure the Linked 
Payable Account is a liability account called Superannuation Payable (and not PAYG 
Withholding, which is frequently set as a default in error).
Next, check that Salary Sacrifice and RESC is selected as the ATO Reporting Category 
(RESC stands for Reportable Employer Superannuation Contributions, in case you’re 
wondering).
For Salary Sacrifice pay items, the best approach is usually to select Per Pay Period in 
the Super Information, but leave the Dollar field blank. You can then specify how much 
of this type of super to deduct in each employee’s standard pay. This elegant solution 
calculates the correct super deduction each week for each employee, avoiding the need 
to set up a separate Salary Sacrifice pay item for each amount.276 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
» Manual setup: With this option, you ask employees to complete a 
Withholding Declaration and Superannuation Standard Choice Form. When 
they return this to you (via a printed, paper form — not via email as due to the 
Privacy Act, sensitive personal information cannot be sent via email), you’ll 
need to enter this information into MYOB.
I explain how to enter this information in the section ‘Adding employee details 
manually’.
Taking a break from the heavy lifting
Employee Self-Onboarding helps you collect employee data quickly and easily, 
with the added benefit that the security of your employees’ personal information 
is protected. Here’s what to do:
1. Go to Payroll → Create Employee.
The Employee Self-Onboarding pop-up window appears.
2. Enter the employee’s first name, surname and email address (you can 
also add a mobile number to send an additional invitation via text 
message).
3. Tick Invite Employee to fill out their own details and then Continue.
The Employees page appears, which shows all your Self-Onboarding Invites, 
including this latest one, along with their Status.
4. The employee will receive an email with the link to a secure online form, 
where they can complete their personal details, emergency contacts, 
bank details and tax details, and add their superannuation fund (or 
select from the funds on offer if they don’t have a fund yet).
Figure 11-4 shows what the employee sees when they open the link to view 
the form.
You may want to advise employees to ensure they have their bank details and 
tax information to hand — MYOB offers no option to save and complete later, 
so they need to complete the form in one sitting.
5. Wait for MYOB to notify you by email that the employee has done 
their stuff.
All done! You’re now ready to complete the setup for this employee. See 
‘Entering employee rates and other details’ and ‘Creating standard pay 
templates’ for what to do next.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 277
If you need to refer to the information supplied by the employee at any point in 
the future (perhaps an employee is querying their tax scale or something similar), 
go to Payroll → Employees and select the employee in question. Click the Contact 
Details tab and at the top click View Employee Details. MYOB will download a PDF 
summary of the information provided by this employee. This summary also satis￾fies the requirement from Fair Work for storing employee records. You can also 
find the employee’s completed Super Choice Form under the Superannuation tab.
Adding employee details manually
If an employee isn’t able (or doesn’t want) to onboard themselves, you can still 
add their details manually. Here’s how:
1. Go to Payroll → Create Employee.
The Employee Self-Onboarding pop-up window appears here.
2. Instead of sending the self-onboarding form, click Skip This, I’ll Add the 
Employee’s Details Myself.
The pop-up window disappears and you arrive at the Contact Details tab on 
the Create Employee page.
3. Complete the Contact Details tab, filling in the name, address, email 
address, phone number and so on.
A full address is important both for your payroll records and for connecting to 
STP. Fair Work also requires you to add an email for sending pay slips, and 
super funds require a phone number if you pay super using MYOB Pay Super.
FIGURE 11-4:
An Employee 
Self-Onboarding 
form, which can 
be accessed 
securely online.278 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
You can add other important information in the Notes field. For example, 
MYOB prefills emergency contact details here when you set up employees 
using employee self-onboarding.
4. Click Save.
You’re now ready to complete the setup for this employee. See ‘Entering 
employee rates and other details’ and ‘Creating standard pay templates’ for 
what to do next.
Entering employee rates and other details
After you have created a new employee and added their contact details (refer to 
the previous section if you haven’t done so yet), you’re ready to configure pay 
rates and other settings. This process can be a little technical first time around, so 
keep hold of your hat:
1. Go to Payroll → Employees and select the employee you want to add 
details for.
You arrive at the Contact Details tab, which by now should have all details 
complete. (If not, refer to the previous section.)
2. Go to the Payroll Details tab and complete the Employment Details 
sub-tab.
The Date of Birth, Start Date, Employment Category and Employment Basis are 
required for STP reporting. If this employee is covered under an award, you 
also should select an Employment Classification.
Don’t use Other (Not Reported) as the Employment Classification for anyone 
other than subcontractors. (I expand on why some subcontractors may be set 
up as employees for super guarantee purposes in Chapter 12.)
3. Go to the Salary and Wages sub-tab and choose the Pay Basis.
Only select the Pay Basis as Salary if you have a true salaried employee, where 
hours of work are not so important.
If you choose Salary as the Pay Basis, enter the salary in the Annual Salary ($) 
field as a gross total for the full year. MYOB automatically calculates the hourly 
rate on this basis, just in case you need to switch to using Hourly Rate at some 
future point.
Choose Hourly if the employee works on a part-time or casual basis, if their 
hours vary from week to week, if the employee receives any kind of loadings, 
penalties or overtime, or if the employee’s award limits the daily hours of work. 
Add the hourly rate in the Hourly Rate ($) field.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 279
4. Select the Pay Cycle for this employee (options range from Weekly to 
Quarterly).
5. Enter the standard Hours in a Pay Cycle for your business (generally, Fair 
Work says this is 38 hours per week but your industry award and agree￾ments may differ).
Note: These are an employee’s standard hours, not the hours they work in a 
given week. The regular hours an employee works can be pre-set in the 
employee’s standard pay.
If you’re using timesheets or MYOB Team, set Hours in a Pay Cycle to 0.00 to 
prevent hours from doubling up.
6. Choose your Wage Expense Account.
The Wage Expense Account prefills based on your Payroll linked accounts 
(refer to the earlier section ‘Checking linked accounts’ for more on this). 
However, you can choose to direct this employee’s gross wages to another 
Chart of Account code. For example, if you employ office staff, factory staff and 
management, you could create different expense accounts for each category 
of staff. This way, you can report on the cost of wages for each department.
7. Allocate all wage pay items for this employee by clicking Add Wage 
Pay Item.
Ask yourself which wage pay items apply to this employee.
For casuals, you only need to select Base Hourly unless they work weekends or 
at different rates, in which case you may need to select additional pay items 
such as Overtime or Shift Loadings. (If you need to add a pay item and you find 
it doesn’t exist, refer to the earlier section ‘Creating wage pay items’.)
For permanent employees, select either Base Hourly or Base Salary, as well as 
Annual Leave Pay and Personal Leave Pay. In some instances, you may need to 
select Overtime, Annual Leave Loading or other relevant allowances. Figure 11-5 
shows how the setup for a permanent employee might look.
When setting up employee payroll, ensure you’re intimately acquainted with 
each employee’s award — or, for non-award employees, that you have their 
employment contract close to hand.
8. Go to the Leave sub-tab and select leave entitlements as required.
Select one Annual Leave and one Personal Leave item for each full-time or 
part-time employee. (Refer to ‘Reviewing leave items’ earlier in this chapter if 
you’re not sure which one to pick.) If this person is employed on a casual basis, 
you don’t need to select anything here.280 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
9. Go to the Deductions sub-tab if you have any Deduction Pay Items to add 
for this employee.
Deductions are generally unique to each employee or award. A common 
deduction is child support, but other deductions may include salary packaging 
or garnishee payments. Refer to the earlier section ‘Creating wage pay items’ if 
you need to create any deductions.
Review the Fair Work website for more on deductions, or liaise with your 
accountant or bookkeeper to find out more about how to handle deductions 
from employees’ wages.
10. Go to the Superannuation sub-tab and check the superannuation 
information for this employee.
If this employee was added using the self-onboarding feature, this information 
will be complete.
If this employee didn’t self-onboard, they must complete a Superannuation 
Standard Choice Form to confirm which superannuation fund they want their 
super payments to go into. Once you receive this info, enter the employee’s 
super fund and employee membership number.
FIGURE 11-5:
Completing the 
Salary and Wages 
tab when creating 
an employee.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 281
11. If the super fund nominated by your employee doesn’t exist in the list, 
select Create Superannuation Fund from the Superannuation Fund 
menu. Select your Fund Type and Fund Name.
Most employees will have Standard as their Fund Type. When you select the 
Fund Name, the SPIN/USI (Superannuation Product Identification Number/
Unique Superannuation Identifier) and Fund ABN fields populate automati￾cally, so be sure to double-check you have the correct SPIN/USI as some funds 
provide many you can choose from. If you can’t see the name of the employ￾ee’s fund in this list, you may need to contact MYOB support.
Don’t be confused by the Employer Membership Number field — this field isn’t 
for the employee’s membership number, but rather is where you record your 
employer membership number if you have one. You’re generally best to leave 
this field blank.
12. Allocate Super Pay Items to the employee by clicking Add 
Superannuation Pay Item and selecting from the drop-down menu.
The Superannuation Guarantee pay item is already here by default. 
Superannuation is payable to almost every type of employee or subcontractor 
but if you’re confident that somebody isn’t eligible for super, you can remove 
the item (the ATO can advise on employee and subcontractor eligibility for the 
super guarantee). Be sure to add any other relevant super items for the 
employee, such as Salary Sacrifice super.
13. Optional: Go to the Expenses sub-tab and add expense pay items.
If you need to track benefits (other than superannuation) that you pay on 
behalf of your employees, set these up as an expense pay item. In practice, few 
businesses use Expense pay items.
14. Review the tax information. If it is incomplete, go to the Taxes sub-tab 
and complete the employee’s tax information.
If this employee didn’t self-onboard, they must complete a Withholding 
Declaration. You can then use this declaration as a reference to record the 
employee’s Tax File Number and select the appropriate Tax Table.
Employees aren’t always sure how these tax tables work, especially with regard 
to tax-free thresholds, so if the employee self-onboarded but this info doesn’t 
look or feel right, give them a call to check.
To help you (or your employee) select the correct tax table, click Fill Out TFN 
Declaration Questions. In the pop-up window that appears, answer the 
questions carefully and MYOB will select the correct tax table for you.
15. Still under the Taxes sub-tab, select the Income Type and add details of 
any withholding variations or tax rebates.
This section may seem scary, but if in doubt, select Salary and Wages as the 
Income Type and leave all the other fields blank (the Income Type field is 282 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
required in order to connect to STP). Only alter the Income Type if advised by 
your accountant to do so, and only select additional tax if an employee 
specifically asks.
16. Go to the Standard Pay sub-tab and complete the employee’s standard 
pay information.
Standard pay templates are awesome once you understand how they work. 
Make your way to the later section, ‘Creating standard pay templates’, to get 
the whole picture.
17. Ignore the Pay History sub-tab.
If you’re in the rare situation that you’re starting MYOB in the middle of a 
payroll year and you need to transfer year-to-date STP balances for existing 
employees, you’re best to ignore the Pay History sub-tab and (a) ask your 
bookkeeper or accountant for help, (b) transfer your data using a BMS ID (a 
topic I discuss in ‘Connecting to the ATO’ later in this chapter) or (c) record a 
single pay run with carried forward totals for each employee.
18. Click Save.
My goodness. At 18 steps long, this might be the longest list in this entire book! 
Well done.
Completing payment details
The last step in setting up an employee is to review their payment details. To do 
this, go to edit the employee (select Employees from the Payroll menu), and then 
head to the Payment Details tab.
You’ll see you have three choices as the Payment Method: Electronic, Cheque or 
Cash. The terminology is hugely confusing here, so read on with care:
» If you pay employees individually using internet banking: Select Cash as 
the Payment Method (sounds wrong, but trust me!).
» If you want to pay employees in a batch by exporting a payment file out 
of MYOB and into your internet banking: Select Electronic as the Payment 
Method. See Chapter 14 for more details.
» If you pay employees using cash or cheque: Select Cash or Cheque as the 
Payment Method.
If an employee uses Employee Self-Onboarding to add their own details, and in 
the process of doing so enters their bank account information, the Payment 
Method defaults to Electronic. If you’re paying this employee individually using 
internet banking, remember to allocate the transaction to your Electronic Clearing CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 283
account, rather than to your Payroll Clearing account, when the payment comes 
through your bank feed.
The payment methods I recommend in this section rely upon your linked accounts 
being configured correctly. Refer to ‘Checking linked accounts’ earlier in this 
chapter if you haven’t already done so.
Creating standard pay templates
The idea behind standard pays is you can set up a default template for each 
employee’s regular pay, specifying how many hours an employee works each pay 
cycle, what allowances they receive and the amounts, whether the employee has 
extra super contributions, and so on. These details then flow through to the Create 
Pay Run page, ready to record each employee’s pay automatically, with hopefully 
minimal intervention from you.
Of course, you can still edit an employee’s pay before you record it (for example, 
to add holiday pay hours), but the default makes a good starting point.
To view or edit an employee’s standard pay, go to Payroll → Employees to find the 
employee, click the Payroll Details tab and head for the Standard Pay sub-tab. 
What you should see is every element of the employee’s pay, with amounts against 
each Pay Item that applies, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Here are some tips about applying standard pays to your employees:
» Missing pay items: If a pay item doesn’t show up in the employee’s standard 
pay, it’s because you haven’t added this pay item to the employee’s record. 
Return to the relevant sub-tabs under the Payroll Details tab for this employee 
(Salary and Wages, Leave, Superannuation, and so on), select the pay item you 
need to add for that employee, and then return to the Standard Pay sub-tab.
» If you intend to use the timesheets feature and MYOB Team, set the 
number of base hours in the standard pay to zero: Otherwise, MYOB will 
add the standard pay hours onto the timesheet hours, potentially doubling 
the hours on an employee’s pay.
Chapter 13 covers MYOB Team in more detail.
» Part-timers: Add the number of regular hours next to the Base Hourly wage 
item so that these hours populate automatically when processing pay runs.
» Casuals: If you employ casuals whose hours vary every week, get wise and 
change the number of hours in the Hours column of their standard pay to 
zero hours. That way you don’t risk accidentally paying a casual for hours that 
they didn’t work.284 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
» Allowances and overtime rates: Rather than setting up a new pay item for 
every different rate or amount (which will soon become messy), create one 
pay item and set the rate or amount as per the employee’s standard pay. For 
example, if you have a Saturday Pay item, where the rate payable to casual 
employees changes depending on the age of the employee, you can have one 
pay item set at a fixed rate of $0.00 but then add the actual rate within the 
standard pay for each employee.
If you’re not sure whether your standard pays are all set up correctly, the proof of 
the pudding is this: If you find yourself making the same change to an employee’s 
pay every pay cycle (for example, changing the amount of an allowance or deduc￾tion), this means that the employee’s standard pay info isn’t set up right and you 
need to fix it.
FIGURE 11-6:

way to ensure

Setting Up Single Touch Payroll
After you have completed your payroll setup, including setting up your employees 
and wage pay items, you need to connect your file to the ATO for Single Touch 
Payroll (STP) reporting. STP is a fairly meaningless phrase, but essentially means 
that a summary of all payments made to employees must be sent via electronic 
form to the ATO on or before the date of payment.
In this section, I explain everything you need to know in order to get STP up and 
running for your business.
Making sense of ATO reporting categories
Before connecting to STP, you need to assign an ATO reporting category to every 
wage, superannuation, deductions or tax pay item that you use on employee pays.
To get started, go to Pay Items from your Payroll menu. Click the first item under 
the Wages and Salary tab that you know will be used on an employee’s pay. Go to 
the ATO Reporting Category and select the category that makes most sense to you. 
Repeat this process for every pay item you use in your payroll (don’t worry about 
selecting reporting categories for obscure items such as CDEP payments or Com￾missions, unless they actually apply to your business).
While I wish I could give you a list of the ATO reporting categories you should use 
in each instance for your pay items, this would be constituted as ‘advice’ and 
without me knowing all the intricacies of your business, I can’t offer such specif￾ics. The choice for many categories is clear, but when it comes to allowances and 
lump sum payments, you may need some more expert advice.
If you are new to payroll and the STP world, I highly recommend you read the STP 
2 employer reporting guidelines on the ATO website.
Checking you’re ready to rock
Before you try connecting to STP, make sure the following is in order:
» Ensure your business settings are complete: Go to your Settings →
Business Settings and ensure your Business Name, ABN, Industry Code and 
Contact Details are complete.286 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
In particular, ensure your ABN is correct. MYOB will check your ABN is valid 
when you connect to STP, but just because an ABN is valid doesn’t mean it’s 
actually the correct ABN for your business. An incorrect ABN can be compli￾cated to fix, so double-check.
» Ensure employee information is complete: I talk more about employee 
information in ‘Adding a New Employee’ earlier in this chapter, but for STP 
purposes, employee essentials include: Full address details (found under the 
Contact Details tab); Start Date, Employment Category and Employment Basis 
(found under the Employment Details sub-tab); Tax File Number, Tax Table 
and Income Type (found under the Taxes sub-tab).
» Complete the ATO reporting categories: For more about ATO reporting 
categories, return to the preceding section.
Connecting to the ATO
To connect to the ATO, follow these steps:
1. Go to Payroll → Single Touch Payroll Reporting.
An STP information page appears.
2. Click the Get Started button, and, if MYOB reports any errors, click View 
Errors.
If you have any errors relating to STP reporting, the Single Touch Payroll Errors 
page displays. Follow the prompts to work through each issue and click 
Refresh once you’re done. (To read more about preparing for this stage, refer 
to the previous section.)
The Overview page appears, which is the first of seven stages (see Figure 11-7).
3. Read the Overview page, then click Get Started again.
4. Choose your role in the business and click Next.
If you, the individual logged into the MYOB file with your email, represent the 
business, select Someone from the Business.
On the other hand, if you’re working on this file in a professional capacity and 
you’re a registered tax or BAS agent, click Tax Agent or BAS Agent, followed by 
your ABN and Registered Agent Number. Click Search to find your Contact 
Details (or add these if they don’t come up). Enter your details carefully here to 
ensure that MYOB assigns you the same Software ID for all your MYOB clients. 
This way, you only need to inform the ATO of one MYOB Software ID.
Figure 11-7 shows this detail.CHAPTER 11 Setting Up Payroll 287
5. Enter the Declaration Information for the individual or agent and 
click Next.
6. If you are an agent, complete the Add Clients step to confirm that you are 
an agent for the business. Add the business to your Agent ATO Portal 
(if you haven’t already), then click Next.
This step only appears if you’re an agent, ensuring you already have this business 
on your ATO Client List (if you don’t, your STP lodgement will be rejected).
7. Notify the ATO of your Software ID, then click I’ve Notified the ATO.
You arrive at a page similar to Figure 11-8. To notify the ATO that MYOB is your 
software provider, you have two options:
• Call the ATO on 1300 85 22 32. Go through the ID check and give them 
your Software ID, telling them you use MYOB for payroll.
• If you have a myGov ID, log in to the ATO Access Manager and add your 
Software ID under the Hosted SBR software service on the left. All the 
instructions are on this screen, so just follow the steps (or take a picture 
with your phone so you can come back later if you wish to check).
8. If you want to use a BMS (Business Management Software) ID to transfer 
your STP data across from another payroll software in the same financial 
year, click Yes on the transfer BMS ID page and enter your previous BMS 
ID when prompted. Click Report Previous BMS ID to continue.
FIGURE 11-7:
The right role 
setup is crucial 
for connecting 
STP reporting 
in MYOB.288 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
You only need to select Yes if you’re migrating payroll data from a different 
payroll software provider in the middle of a payroll year. By transferring your 
BMS ID, the ATO knows to transfer payroll data from your previous system into 
MYOB. This transfer process is seamless and ensures year-to-date payroll data 
will be accurate for every employee.
When you select Yes, another field appears for you to enter your previous 
software BMS ID (you can find this ID on your myGov account linked to the 
ATO). I recommend you ask for guidance from your accountant or bookkeeper 
on using a BMS ID.
If you select Yes and report your previous BMS ID, this information is lodged with 
the ATO as a pay event for STP reporting. You must wait for the status of this pay 
event to change to Accepted (you can view progress by going to Payroll → Single 
Touch Payroll Reporting, and looking at the status on the STP Reports tab) before 
you can process any new payroll transactions.
9. If you do not wish to transfer your BMS ID, select No and click Next.
Look at you go! All done.

Preparing to Pay Super
All businesses must pay super contributions electronically using a clearing house. 
You’re no longer allowed to pay employee super directly into an employee’s super 
fund; instead, you must pay employee super to a registered clearing house, which 
is then responsible for distributing payments to different funds.
In good news, MYOB has its very own clearing house, known as MYOB Pay Super. 
In even better news, you don’t need to pay any fees to use this service, so long as 
you have a current MYOB Business subscription. Access to MYOB Pay Super is built 
into the payroll features, meaning you can record and authorise superannuation 
payments directly from MYOB. This method is both simple and efficient, enabling 
you to make payments in a matter of minutes and simplifying your compliance 
obligations.
Follow these steps to set up MYOB Pay Super:
1. Go to Payroll → Super Payments and click Sign Up to Pay Super.
You need to be the owner of the file to sign up to Pay Super.
2. Enter your business details and address, then click Next.
Enter your bank details and set a monthly or quarterly payment limit. Your 
bank details are required because after you authorise the super payment, 
MYOB will direct debit the funds from your nominated account.
3. Set the User Roles, then click Next.
Not all users need to be assigned a role, just those who will have a part in the 
processing and paying of super. Choose from the Creator (records payments), 
Authoriser (records and authorises payments) or Administrator (can record 
and authorise payments, as well as change super details online). Other users 
will remain on None.
4. Read the declaration that pops up and click on I Confirm (if you do wish 
to confirm, of course), then click Next.
5. Review all the details you’ve entered and click Submit.
6. Verify your bank details to complete the setup.
MYOB will now deposit 1 cent into your nominated bank account to be sure it 
is drawing funds from the correct bank account (this deposit could take a 
couple of days).290 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
7. Once you see the 1 cent deposit in your bank, go to Payroll → Super 
Payments. When prompted, enter the six-digit code that appears on the 
bank statement description line (for the 1 cent deposit transaction) into 
the verification code field and click Submit.
Wait a few moments for the setup to complete. You are now connected to Pay 
Super and ready to make super payments via MYOB.
For more about processing superannuation payments, skip to Chapter 12.
THE SMALL BUSINESS SUPER 
CLEARING HOUSE
If you don’t want to use MYOB’s Pay Super feature, you will need to find another clear￾ing house through which to manage your employee superannuation. A good alternative 
is the ATO’s Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (SBSCH). This government￾run service operates in the same way as any other clearing house (you make a single 
payment to the clearing house, and they manage the individual payments to each fund). 
The service is free, but only available for businesses with 19 employees or fewer.
The key advantage of this government-run service is that as soon as SBSCH receives 
your payment, the funds are deemed to have been received into each employee’s super 
fund. This instant clearing of funds buys a little extra time to pay and, if you’re running 
late, may help you avoid expensive fines. SBSCH also sends you an email notification 
when it receives your payments, so you have proof that you submitted payment by the 
due date.
However, as good as this solution may be, the requirement to manually set up new 
employees as well as rekey data means that SBSCH is nowhere near as efficient as 
using MYOB’s Pay Super.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 291

Paying Your Employees
I
n Chapter 11, I guide you through setting up payroll, including creating employ￾ees, checking pay items and connecting to Single Touch Payroll (STP). In this 
chapter, I take you through the day-to-day payroll tasks, from creating pay 
runs to paying super.
I also talk you through the benefits of checking your data throughout the year so 
that finalising and reporting payroll at the end of the year is as stress-free as 
possible.
Payroll legislation is undeniably tricky, and processing payroll is probably the 
most technical aspect of bookkeeping. As I explain in Chapter 11, if you’re in any 
doubt regarding industry awards or your payroll reporting obligations, then reach 
out to your accountant or bookkeeper for advice.

Processing Your First Pay
If you’ve completed all the setup processes described in Chapter 11, you’re ready 
to record your first pay run. In the first section of this chapter, I explain how to 
create your first pay run, troubleshoot payroll calculations, check STP lodgements 
and last but not least, reverse, delete or adjust pays when errors arise.
Preparing timesheets
In this chapter, I explain how to record pays using the information that you set up 
in the standard pay for each employee (refer to Chapter 11 for more on employee 
setup). However, if you have lots of casuals, the start and finish times for your 
employees vary every week, or employment agreements require you to maintain 
timesheets, then I suggest you not only use standard pays, but also that you use 
the Timesheets feature in MYOB Team (if it is included in your subscription).
You may be wondering why I recommend MYOB Team, when timesheets already 
exist under the Payroll menu. (Head to the Payroll menu and select Timesheets if 
you’re wondering what I’m talking about.) I find entering timesheets under the 
Timesheets menu to be both time-consuming and error-prone. In contrast, the 
MYOB Team app enables employees to create their own timesheets ready for you 
to review. Once these timesheets are approved, the total hours are pushed through 
to populate your pay run for that week, without you having to enter a single start 
or finish time.
I talk more about this app and working with timesheets in Chapter 13.
Creating your first pay run
In this section, I explain how to create a pay run, with the assumption that you’ve 
already added up the total hours the employee is due to be paid. I also assume that 
if you have decided to use timesheets, then this data has already been recorded 
and approved. (Refer to the previous section for more about timesheets.)
Ready to go? Here’s how to record your first pay run:
1. Go to Payroll → Single Touch Payroll Reporting and check that you have 
connected your MYOB file to the ATO.
If you’re connected, then the Single Touch Payroll Reporting page appears, with 
a series of tabs along the top. If you’re not yet connected, you arrive at an STP 
information page with a button saying Get Started. You must connect to the 
ATO before processing your first pay run (refer to Chapter 11 for more about 
how to do this).CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 293
2. Go to Payroll → Create Pay Run.
The Create Pay Run page appears, with Select Pay Period highlighted as the 
first step.
3. Choose a Pay Cycle, select the pay period’s start and finish dates, and 
enter a Date of Payment.
The Pay Cycle refers to the Pay Cycle you chose when adding each employee to 
MYOB (refer to Chapter 11). If you have employees on different cycles, you 
need to process separate pay runs for each one (for example, process a pay 
run for everyone who is paid weekly, and another pay run for everyone who is 
paid monthly).
If you are processing your first pay run, you need to enter Pay Period Start and 
Pay Period Finish dates; after this, dates populate automatically for you. The 
Date of Payment is usually one day after the Pay Period End date.
All reporting to the ATO or to super funds is based on the date you actually pay 
your employee, rather than the dates hours were worked. For example, if a 
pay period goes from 23 June to 30 June but you pay the employee on 1 July, 
the wages, tax and super for this employee will be reported in the financial 
year in which the payment was made.
If you use timesheets, be scrupulous that your Pay Period Start and Pay Period 
Finish dates match exactly with the timesheet start and finish dates. See also 
‘Preparing timesheets’ earlier in this chapter.
4. Click Next.
The Calculate Pays page appears (similar to Figure 12-1), which shows a 
summary of all the employees in this pay run.
5. Make sure all employees you want to pay are on this list and that 
employees who have left or resigned aren’t on this list.
If an employee is missing from this list, it’s probably because you set up the 
employee’s Pay Cycle incorrectly (for example, selecting Monthly instead of 
Weekly). To change this, go to the employee’s details and open the Payroll 
Details tab to adjust their Pay Cycle. On the other hand, if an employee who 
has long since departed shows up in the list, you can fix this error by finding 
the employee’s details and marking them as inactive on the Payroll Details tab. 
(Turn to the later section ‘Biting the Bullet’ for more on removing employees 
from payroll.)
If an employee is casual (like Chris James in Figure 12-1) and didn’t work this 
pay period, remove the tick from against this person’s name to exclude them 
from this pay run.294 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
6. In the Select Employees to Pay area, check the pay details for each 
employee, and edit the pays for any employees whose standard pay is 
different from normal.
Expand payment information by clicking the drop-down arrow to the right of 
each employee.
Figure 12-2 shows an individual employee’s pay in the expanded view:
• The first section (Wages) is where you can change the hours, add overtime 
or add leave. (See ‘Managing Leave Payments’ later in this chapter for more 
about paying leave.) You can also adjust the Amount ($) values as needed.
• The second and third sections show any Deductions, such as Child Support 
or Salary Sacrifice, and Taxes (that is, PAYG Withholding). The tax amount 
calculates based on the tax table you chose for this employee.
• The next section shows Leave Accruals. If this employee is a permanent 
staff member and yet no leave accruals appear here, you may have 
forgotten to enable their leave entitlements (if so, return to the employee’s 
details and fix as needed).
• The final section shows Employer Expenses, which is the Superannuation 
Guarantee (SG) calculation.
If an employee has variations to their standard pay for this pay period (perhaps 
they did some overtime, went on leave or had a sickie), click Add Wage, select 
the pay item (for example, Annual Leave Pay) and edit the Hours or Amount 
column as required. You can also see the hourly rate being used for this 
calculation, helping you to ensure this pay item is calculating correctly.
FIGURE 12-1:
The Calculate 
Pays page.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 295
With the first couple of pay runs, get out your calculator and check the 
calculations on each pay, including superannuation and leave accruals. 
Although it’s okay to manually edit the hours or an amount if you find an 
incorrect calculation, the best practice is to return to the employee’s payroll 
details and fix the issue. (This could mean editing the setup for a pay item, 
adding a pay item to the Standard Pay, or something else altogether.)
7. When you’re happy that all the pays are correct, click Next.
The Record and Report page appears (the third step of creating a pay run).
This page will also display a warning if MYOB identifies data that is not STP 
compliant. If you see a warning, follow the prompts to correct the non￾compliant data.
FIGURE 12-2:
Expand an 
individual 
employee’s pay to 
review the details, 
make any 
adjustments and 
check the 
calculations.296 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
8. Review the pay run.
The Record and Report page shows you the net wages you’re about to pay to 
each employee in the Current Net ($) column and compares this against net 
wages paid in their most recent pay in the Previous Net ($) column. This 
comparison is particularly useful for permanent employees (permanent 
employees usually receive the same net wages from one week to the next, 
so any discrepancy between the two columns often indicates an issue).
As part of STP reporting, the ATO mandates that you should declare and report 
your payroll on the date you entered as the Date of Payment for each pay run. 
If you are processing your pay run late (even by one day), a pop-up message 
will ask how you would like to record this pay run for STP: If you are making 
corrections to a previous pay run, click Report as an Updated Pay Run; 
otherwise, if you’re simply reporting this payment a day or so late, click Report 
as a New Pay Run. (You’re best to always report and declare your payroll on 
the Date of Payment to avoid warnings or penalties from the ATO for late 
lodgement.)
9. Click the Preview Pay Run Activity and/or Preview Pay Details reports for 
one last check.
Select and view the report you prefer (or both) to have a last squiz before 
finalising the pay run. If you identify an error, click Previous and fix the 
problem.
If you intend to pay employees individually by internet banking, do print or 
save a copy of the Pay Run Activity report at this point; this report is an 
essential reference when making these payments.
10. When you’re happy, click Record.
By clicking Record, you agree to process the pay transactions for each selected 
employee. No going back now!
11. Enter payroll information details and click Send to send STP reporting to 
the ATO.
You will need to specify whether you’re an Employer or a Registered Agent, and 
enter your Name.
12. Send pay slips to your employees.
Ensure all employee names are selected and click Email Pay Slips (Fair Work 
requires that employees receive a copy of their pay slips within one working day 
of payday). You will see a pop-up notice when all pay slips have been sent, and 
ticks will appear against each employee’s name in the Pay Slip Emailed column.
If you prefer to print pay slips (or perhaps wish to email a pay slip separately), 
click View PDF from the View Pay Slip column to download the pay slip. You can 
then either print this pay slip or attach it to an email.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 297
If you can’t see an employee listed in the Email or Print areas, it’s probably 
because you set the employee’s pay slip delivery to Already Printed or Sent. 
To change this, go to the employee’s details, open the Payroll Details tab and 
adjust the pay slip delivery to Email.
13. Click Next.
14. If you are going to pay your employees via electronic payments, prepare 
your ABA file by clicking Pay Employees via Electronic Payments.
Chapter 14 gives you all the ins and outs on electronic payments.
If you miss the option to prepare your ABA file, don’t panic — go to Banking →
Prepare Electronic Payments to create the ABA file for your internet bank batch 
payment.
15. If you intend to pay your employees individually, head to your internet 
banking to process these payments.
The Pay Run Activity report you generated in Step 9 is your ideal reference at 
this point. If you forgot to generate this report, the Payroll Activity report (go to 
Reporting → Reports, then skip to the Payroll tab) will do the trick.
16. Click Close.
Simply click Close to complete the pay run. Congratulations, you have pro￾cessed your first pay run.
Keeping everything sweet
If you’re having problems getting an employee’s pay to calculate correctly, try 
these tricks:
» Check the tax. If the tax doesn’t come up right, check the tax table you 
selected for the employee in the Taxes tab of the employee’s details (refer to 
Chapter 11).
» Check the Pay Basis. If the pay is coming up as a ridiculous amount of, say, a 
few cents per week, chances are you’ve entered an hourly rate but then set 
the Pay Basis as Salary in the employee’s details. No matter how radical 
Australia’s industrial relations reform, you won’t get away with paying anyone 
35 cents per week.
» Make sure the standard pay is set up correctly. Regular payments such as 
allowances and deductions should come up automatically — if they don’t, go 
to the employee’s details and change the employee’s standard pay.
» Check super is calculating correctly for under-18-year-olds. If an employee 
is under 18 and works more than 30 hours in any one week, you must pay 298 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
super on their wages for that week. For employees paid on a weekly pay cycle, 
MYOB generally calculates the super correctly, adjusting for whether they’ve 
worked more than 30 hours in that pay cycle, or not. However, for employees 
paid fortnightly, MYOB won’t have enough information to decide whether 
super is payable, and you will need to double-check the super calculations 
manually, adjusting the Super Guarantee amount as required.
» Make sure the working week is the right number of hours. Always make 
sure the total hours come up correctly. You don’t want a 40-hour week to 
show up on each employee’s pay if the standard working week according to 
the employee’s award is actually 38 hours.
Checking all has gone to plan
If you’ve been following the instructions in this chapter so far, what you’ve man￾aged to do is record employee pays and send the pay data to the ATO (refer to 
‘Creating your first pay run’ for more about this). The next step is to check that 
the STP lodgement has gone through.
To do this, select Single Touch Payroll reporting from the Payroll menu. You can 
view every pay run that you’ve sent under the STP Reports tab. If the Status is 
Sending, Sent or Accepted, this means that your lodgement is either still being 
processed, or has been accepted. If the Status is Not Sent, Rejected or Accepted 
with Errors, you will need to follow the prompts to resolve the issue.
If you’re new to MYOB Business, I recommend you check your STP lodgement 
status after every pay cycle, at least for your first few pay runs.
Looking up previous pay runs
Often, an employee will have a query about their pay, or you’ll want to look up the 
details of a previous pay. To view a history of pay runs sorted by date, head to the 
Payroll menu and select Pay Runs. You can filter by date if you’re trying to pin￾point a particular pay run, and then simply click the Date of Payment for any pay 
run to view the full details.
Here are some useful pointers about the Pay Runs page:
» If you can’t see an employee’s name when you click through to a pay run, 
remember that some employees may be hiding under the Print Pay Slips tab 
rather than the default Email Pay Slips tab.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 299
» If you identify an error in a pay run, skip ahead to ‘Reversing and adjusting 
pays’ for what to do.
» If you missed sending an employee their pay slip during a pay run, or perhaps 
an employee didn’t receive their pay slip, you can email them again by going 
to the employee (in the Payroll menu) and under the Pay Slips tab they are all 
here to send as needed. (Remember, it is a Fair Work requirement that you 
provide all employees with a pay slip within one working day of payday, even 
if the employee is on leave.)
» Using the MYOB Team app, an employee can also self-serve their pay slips 
from directly within the app, along with the last three months’ worth of pay 
slips. Chapter 13 talks more about MYOB Team.
Reversing, deleting or adjusting pays
Employee pays differ from most other transactions in MYOB in that after you 
record a pay run transaction, you can’t change anything — the details are locked in.
If you find you’ve made a mistake processing a pay, the easiest solution is to 
incorporate the adjustment into the next pay period. For example, if you under￾paid someone by two hours one week, simply add these two hours onto their pay 
the next week. Remember to make a note of the adjustment in the pay slip mes￾sage so you have a record of why you made the adjustment.
Alternatively, if the adjustment relates to the pay item rather than the pay 
amount — maybe you processed a pay as 38 regular hours, rather than 38 annual 
leave hours — you can record an additional pay for that pay period. For example, 
you would enter 38 hours against Annual Leave Pay item and minus 38 hours 
against the Base Hourly Pay. The final result would be a nil value pay, but your 
leave totals and ATO reporting categories (STP) would now be correct.
However, sometimes processing adjustments in these ways isn’t an option. Per￾haps the adjustment required is significant and the employee is disadvantaged by 
the underpayment, perhaps this was the final pay for an employee, or perhaps the 
error you’ve made has fallen on 30 June and you can’t let the adjustment span 
financial years. In these kinds of situations, the best course of action depends on 
whether you’ve paid the employee yet, how the payment method you chose in 
MYOB, and the STP Status of the pay run.
Table 12-1 provides a summary of what to do if you’ve made an error recording a 
pay and, for whatever reason, you can’t incorporate an adjustment into the next 
pay period.300 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Deleting or reversing pay runs can only be achieved one employee at a time. 
Here’s how:
1. Go to Payroll → Pay Runs.
The Pay Runs page appears.
2. Locate the pay run in which the offending pay belongs. Open the pay run 
by clicking the Date of Payment.
In the unlikely event that the pay run belongs to a prior period that you’ve 
already submitted a BAS for, don’t continue. Instead, I recommend you reach 
out to your bookkeeper or accountant for advice on your next best move.
3. Click the employee’s name to display their pay transaction, and click 
either Reverse or Delete, depending on your options.
When you click the employee’s name, a pop-up window opens showing the 
employee’s pay run details. Refer to Table 12-1 for what you should do next.
Never delete a pay transaction if you’ve already paid an employee and 
supplied a pay slip. This pay slip is a legal record and, even if incorrect, shows 
how you calculated the employee’s pay.
4. If required, recreate the pay run.
If you need to create an extra pay run to correct an error, ensure you maintain 
a good audit history by adding a note in the Pay Slip Message field explaining 
the adjustment and the period the adjustment relates to.

Overpayments to employees require a much longer conversation, so in this 
instance I recommend you reach out to Fair Work to find out the rights of both the 
employer and employee before deducting money from future pay runs.
Managing Leave Payments
I reckon that tracking employee leave is the trickiest part of managing payroll. Not 
only do you need to understand how leave is calculated, but you also need to be 
very familiar with each employee’s award and employment conditions.
In the next couple of pages, I explain three things: First, how to record a pay when 
an employee takes annual or personal leave; second, how to set up opening leave 
balances (if you need to do so); and third, how to make an adjustment if an 
employee’s leave balance is incorrect.
KEEPING THINGS TO YOURSELF
Payroll information is sensitive. There’s no better way to create friction between 
employees than have them compare wages with one another, especially in a family 
business (where the children of the employers so often end up with a sweeter deal). 
However, not only is payroll information sensitive in this way, but some employee infor￾mation is also protected by the Privacy Act. In particular, you’re obliged to keep 
employee tax file numbers (TFNs) secure.
When you add users to your file, restrict access to payroll and be sure each user is log￾ging in with their own email login (and that they’re not sharing their password if they 
have payroll access!). I explain how to set up user roles in Chapter 1. Note: While MYOB 
does provide an Audit History report so you can see which users are doing what in the 
file, payroll information is not tracked in this way, so keep that in mind when granting 
payroll access to users.
Employee Self-Onboarding helps ensure privacy as no TFN tax declarations or other 
personal details are received via email or end up lying around the office, but are instead 
transmitted via a secure gateway between the employee and MYOB.302 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Paying annual leave and personal leave
So, what do you do when an employee takes some annual leave or personal leave? 
Take your time, and follow these instructions:
1. Process a pay run as per normal until you get to the Calculate Pays stage. 
Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the employee to show the 
employee’s pay details.
For more about processing pay runs, refer to the earlier section ‘Creating your 
first pay run’.
2. Check that the employee has accrued enough leave hours.
Hover your mouse over the information icon that sits in the left of the Hours 
column for this leave item (for example, Annual Leave Pay). You’ll see a neat 
summary of how much leave this employee is owed, including the projected 
balance after the current pay is processed. For more details about how this 
balance has been calculated, check out the Leave Balance (Detail) report, found 
under the Payroll tab of your Reporting menu.
If the employee has insufficient leave entitlements for you to make this 
payment, seek further advice.
3. Enter the number of hours leave this employee is taking this pay cycle.
Enter annual leave hours in the Annual Leave Pay field, and personal leave 
hours in the Personal/Carer’s Leave Pay field.
Enter the total number of hours and not the number of days taken. For 
example, if an employee works 38 hours per week and takes two days’ leave, 
enter 15.2 hours.
Check whether the hours entered as leave automatically reduce the number 
of hours of Base Hourly, or reduce the correct dollar amount of Base Salary. 
If not, manually edit the Hours of Base Hourly, or the Amount in Base Salary. 
(You can get leave to adjust automatically in the future by editing Annual Leave 
and Personal Leave pay items, and selecting the option to Automatically Adjust 
Base Hourly or Base Salary Details.)
4. Optional: Record the details of the leave taken in the Pay Slip 
Message field.
Although you can easily retrieve this information from leave reports, you may 
also wish to include leave information on the pay slip message, such as the 
dates that leave was taken, the total number of hours paid and any other notes 
about this leave.
By now, your pay should look something similar to Figure 12-3.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 303
5. If this employee is eligible for leave loading, enter the number of annual 
leave hours taken against Annual Leave Loading.
Leave loading is an additional payment that some employees receive when they 
take annual leave. If you know leave loading is part of your employee’s award 
or agreement, add the hours here.
6. Check the Leave Accrual values.
In the Leave Accrual section of this pay, you can see how many hours of leave 
the employee is accruing for this pay period. These values should be the same 
as for any regular pay for this employee, as all employees continue to accrue 
leave even when taking leave.
7. Complete your pay run in the normal way.
FIGURE 12-3:
Processing a pay 
run that includes 
annual leave.304 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Catching up on what’s already owed
If you had permanent employees before you started using MYOB Business, you 
need to adjust how much annual and personal leave your employees were owed at 
the point you started processing payroll in MYOB.
You have two options here: You can either create a pay run to record leave balances 
or you can edit the Balance Adjustment field in the employee’s Payroll Details. I 
only explain the pay run method in this chapter, as recording opening leave bal￾ances in this way provides a clear record of the amounts entered, and when. (In 
contrast, the Balance Adjustment method shows no audit trail of when or how the 
balance was edited, and can be changed at any time by anyone with access to 
payroll.)
If you prefer to fix up leave balances according to what they are right now, rather 
than what they were when you first started using MYOB, skip ahead to the next 
section. Otherwise, to create a pay run that records opening leave entitlements, do 
the following:
1. Calculate how much leave you owed each employee as at the date you 
started using MYOB.
For example, if you’ve been using MYOB since the beginning of July, calculate 
exactly how much leave was owing as at 30 June of that year.
2. Create a pay run with Unscheduled as the Pay Cycle (for the date, use the 
Pay Period End Date of the first pay cycle where you used MYOB).
Selecting Unscheduled as the Pay Cycle means that all standard pay items will 
be set to $0.00 — perfect!
3. Select the employees you need to enter leave balances for by ticking on 
the far left of the employee name, then click the drop-down arrow for 
each employee to add the leave adjustment details.
Ensure you enter leave balances in hours, not days, owed.
4. Enter the total number of hours’ leave that were owing to each employee 
in the corresponding boxes for each leave type in the Leave Accrual 
section.
All other values in the pay window should be $0.00, except the leave accruals. 
Add a note in the Pay Slip Message at the top, such as ‘Leave Opening Balances 
at 1 July’.
For an example, see Figure 12-4.
5. Repeat Step 4 for all employees, then complete your pay run in the 
normal way.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 305
Adjusting leave balances through a pay run ensures your leave balances also 
appear as a line item in your Payroll Leave Balance (Detail) report, enabling you to 
follow the full audit history.
Fixing up leave when it’s up the spout
So, you know for sure that an employee is owed three weeks’ annual leave, but the 
employee’s pay slip shows a ridiculous number of hours’ entitlements, which has 
no bearing on reality. How do you fix things up?
FIGURE 12-4:
Entering leave 
opening balances 
via a pay run 
ensures a good 
audit history.306 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
The simplest method is to create an unscheduled pay run, as I explain in the pre￾vious section ‘Catching up on what’s already owed’. Follow the instructions for 
this section bearing the following in mind:
» If you need to increase the leave balance, add the total difference in hours as 
a positive number in the Leave Accrual section.
» If you need to decrease the leave balance, add the total difference in hours as 
a negative number to the Leave Accrual section.
The example in Figure 12-5 shows an adjustment to decrease the Annual Leave 
Accrual Hourly field by 20 hours.

Getting Superannuation Payments 
Right Using MYOB
Superannuation is a big deal, not just in terms of how much money is involved but 
also because of the onus on businesses to get super payments right. The superan￾nuation audits I’ve experienced are sombre indeed and the ATO isn’t shy about 
delivering hefty fines for the slightest transgression.
Some of the most important dates in your business calendar should be when your 
Superannuation Guarantee (SG) and other super payments are due. Payments are 
due within 28 days after the end of each quarter (that’s 28 July, 28 October, 28 
January and 28 April). However, I strongly recommend you pay super monthly, as 
it not only helps with cashflow but if something goes wrong and you make a late 
payment, you’re only dealing with one month of late-reported super.
Be careful with regard to the due date. Super payments need to be made to a clear￾ing house, which then disburses payments to individual employee funds. You need 
to be sure that each employee’s fund receives their super payments on or before 
the due date. Check with your own clearing house to be sure, but in my experience, 
clearing houses need at least ten business days to ensure your payment reaches 
the employee’s fund by the due date. Ten business days is also the recommenda￾tion MYOB provides.
If funds aren’t received into the employee’s fund by 30 June, you can’t claim them 
as a tax deduction for that financial year. And, if those super payments don’t reach 
the funds by the quarterly due dates, you may never be able to claim them as a tax 
deduction at all. You will also be fined, and heavily.
To save yourself from making expensive mistakes, keep a firm grip on the latest 
changes to superannuation (refer to the nearby sidebar ‘Keeping super together’ 
for examples of such changes). In the following sections I take you through paying 
super using MYOB and reporting on super to ensure your super payments are 
always in good shape.308 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Reporting on how much super you owe
To see how much super you owe, I recommend a couple of reports, both available 
under the Payroll tab when you to go Reporting → Reports:
» Payroll Activity report: This report shows a payroll summary by employee as 
well as totals for all employees. Note that the Expenses ($) column represents 
the super guarantee amount, while any salary sacrifice super shows in the 
Deductions ($) column.
When reporting payroll on Business and Instalment Activity Statements (BAS/
IAS), the deduction of salary sacrifice must be included in the W1 figure to 
reduce the Salary and Wages total. I talk more about configuring activity 
statement fields in Chapter 16.
» Accrual by Fund report: This report is a detailed superannuation report that 
serves as a useful comparison against the Payroll Activity report. The Accrual 
by Fund report groups employees according to their super fund. When you 
expand each fund, you see a list of all the contributions that make up that 
total per fund (showing each employee’s name, their membership number, 
the amount of super owing individually for each pay run, the type of super 
contribution and the fund total).
KEEPING SUPER TOGETHER
Superannuation compliance is hard to keep up with, from the minimum rate increases 
of 0.5 per cent each year up to 12 per cent in 2025, through to the removal of the $450 
minimum threshold and recently the notion of a stapled super fund. The government 
has also introduced legislation to benchmark super funds via a performance test by the 
industry regulator and for those underperforming, consequences may follow.
A stapled super fund is an existing super account linked, or ‘stapled’ to an individual 
employee, so it follows them as they change jobs. The stapled fund makes a lot of 
sense, helping to reduce the many new super accounts being opened every time an 
employee starts a new job.
The idea of stapled funds is that if the employee doesn’t choose a super fund when they 
start employment, the employer has to check with the ATO to see if the employee has 
an existing super account ‘stapled’ to them in which to pay the employee’s super guar￾antee amounts. A business owner can access this information by logging into the ATO’s 
Online Services for Business or calling the ATO. Agents have access to this employee 
super data via their ATO portal so long as an employment relationship has been estab￾lished for the employer, such as by lodging STP information.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 309
If you use MYOB to pay super, you can also use the Superannuation Payments 
report to track if all your super is paid up and when it was paid. This report is also 
helpful if you need to provide a super contribution statement during an audit.
Making payments using MYOB Pay Super
Assuming you’ve signed up to use MYOB Pay Super as your superannuation clear￾ing house (Chapter 11 talks more about this decision), here’s how to make your 
first super payment:
1. Go to Payroll → Super Payments. Log in to pay super with your normal 
credentials.
The Super Payments page opens. As you start making super payments, they 
will appear here.
2. Click Create Super Payment.
The Create Super Payment page appears (see Figure 12-6).
3. Use the Transactions To and Transactions From dates to specify the date 
range you wish to pay Super for.
For example, if you’re paying super for May, select 1 May to 31 May.
If you can’t see super payments for your employees, check that you’ve selected 
the option Pay using Pay Super for each of your employees’ super funds.
4. In the Account field, select the bank account you nominated when you 
set up Pay Super.
5. Add a Description and Reference Number.
I like to use the same format for both (‘Super mmm yy’ — for example, ‘Super 
Jul 23’, as shown in Figure 12-6), which makes super payments easy to track.
6. Enter the Date of Payment and tick against the super funds you want to 
pay (usually all funds, unless you have a good reason otherwise).
7. Check that the Total Payment matches against the total from your 
Accrual by Fund report for the same period.
This check is an important step as getting funds back when you’ve overpaid 
super is virtually impossible.
You can find the Accrual by Fund report under the Superannuation tab of your 
Reporting menu.
8. Click Record.
The Authorise Super Payment window pops up, asking if you want to autho￾rise now.310 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
9. If your user role is Creator, you can’t go further so select Don’t Authorise 
and then notify someone who can do so. If your role is Authoriser, select 
Authorise.
MYOB sends a six-digit authorisation code to the Authoriser’s mobile via 
SMS. This extra level of security is because MYOB is about to direct debit your 
bank account for the amount you just recorded (MYOB can’t just take money 
out of bank accounts willy-nilly without these kinds of protocols in place).
10. Enter the six-digit code when prompted by MYOB.
At this point, you get an encouraging message saying that MYOB has autho￾rised the payment and it’s being processed.
MYOB takes care of the rest, forwarding your employees’ super contributions 
to their individual funds, along with the necessary details (such as employee 
membership numbers). Now you can enjoy the sunshine and have a snooze.
Payment processing normally takes a couple of days, but you can monitor the 
status of your contributions at any time by going to the Super Payments via the 
Payroll menu. MYOB recommend allowing up to ten business days for your pay￾ment to be processed and reach your employees’ super funds.
Also, if you find you have reversed a pay run at some point, you will see the super 
amount as both a positive and negative value in the Super Payments area. Do not 
select these two amounts as they can put your linked accounts out of balance. 
Ignore these two amounts and over time they will no longer show as you refine 
your dates to relevant periods.
FIGURE 12-6:

super payment in 
MYOB Pay Super.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 311
Withholding PAYG Tax
Managing PAYG Tax (in other words, the tax you deduct from employee pays, 
known as Pay As You Go) involves two things. First, you need to be confident that 
you’re deducting the right amount of tax from each employee. Second, you need 
to report how much tax you deduct each month or each quarter, and make a pay￾ment for this same amount to the ATO.
TAKING CARE OF SUPER FOR SUBBIES
The line is often blurred as to whether subcontractors should be classified as subcontrac￾tors or employees for Super Guarantee purposes. However, if you pay subcontractors 
who are incorporated as sole traders (rather than as partnerships, trusts or companies) 
and your payments to them are primarily for services rather than materials, you may well 
be liable to pay super. If you’re at all unsure whether to pay super on subcontractor pay￾ments, do avoid the risk of heavy penalties by checking carefully with the ATO.
Similar to employees, super for subcontractors is calculated on Ordinary Time earnings 
only, and excludes materials, equipment, overtime and GST. Again, you are best to seek 
guidance from the ATO as to what constitutes Ordinary Time Earnings for each of the 
subcontractors you pay.
In order to get MYOB to record superannuation owing for subcontractors, you first 
need to set each subcontractor up as an employee in payroll (refer to Chapter 11). 
When doing so, ensure you select Other (Not Reported) as the Employment Basis on the 
Employment Details tab. (Selecting Other as the employment basis means that none of 
the subcontractor’s information will be sent to the ATO when you process STP, which is 
correct as subcontractors are not official employees.) You also need to enter, as a mini￾mum, each subcontractor’s date of birth, phone number, address, TFN and super fund 
details.
Once this is set up, process a separate pay run just for your subbies at the end of each 
month, just like you would a normal pay run. Use a spreadsheet or something similar 
to calculate Ordinary Time Earnings for each subcontractor for that month, and the 
amount of superannuation guarantee payable. On the pay run, ensure that all amounts 
are $0.00 except for the Super Guarantee amount at the very bottom of the pay run 
page, which you need to edit to be the amount of super you owe. Once you’ve recorded 
the pay run, refer to the section ‘Making payments using MYOB Pay Super’ to complete 
the super payment process.312 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Checking your tax tables
Tax tables are special formulas for calculating Pay As You Go (PAYG) on employee 
wages. The tax tables within MYOB are updated automatically every year accord￾ing to the latest release by the ATO.
However, you do need to ensure you select the correct tax table for each employee, 
as any errors in this regard could have serious implications at tax time. For exam￾ple, if you employ a new graduate and incorrectly select the tax-free threshold tax 
table instead of including their HELP debt and they then earn $100,000, they could 
be left owing the tax office some $7,000 when they lodge their tax return — and 
how are you going to explain that? So, do be vigilant when selecting tax tables and 
check if any PAYG payments look too big or too small.
Chapter 11 talks more about choosing tax tables.
Paying as you go
Pay as You Go Withholding (PAYGW) is the tax that you deduct from employee pays. 
You then pay this tax to the ATO either as part of your BAS or as part of your 
Instalment Activity Statement (IAS). Monthly IAS reports are due the 21st of the 
following month; quarterly reports are due the 28th of the following quarter. 
Either way, these deadlines come around fast and you need to be ready to make 
your payment.
Here’s what to do to see how much tax you’ll have to report and pay:
1. Go to Reporting → Reports, move to the Payroll tab and open the Payroll 
Activity report.
2. Specify the date range.
For a shining example of what this report looks like, see Figure 12-7. This 
shows a summary view, which is great to get figures for reporting. You can 
Expand All if you wish to see all the details per employee.
3. The amount of PAYGW you need to pay on your next BAS or IAS is shown 
as the Taxes ($) Grand Total.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 313
Recording tax payments
After you’ve paid your BAS or IAS, you need to record your payment or refund. You 
can do this in a few ways:
» If you are recording your IAS, simply allocate the payment directly to your 
PAYG Withholding Payable account (the same liability account as you link to 
your payroll accounts) via your bank transactions.
» If you are recording a full BAS payment breakdown, set up an allocation 
template to split the allocation across the relevant accounts. (Turn to 
Chapter 5 for more on setting up allocation templates and Chapter 16 for the 
common BAS accounts to use in the split allocation.)
» If you don’t use bank feeds, create a recurring Spend Money payment to the 
corresponding accounts. (Chapter 6 explains how to do this.)
Balancing Your Payroll Accounts
In the ideal world, if you deduct amounts from employee pays, such as superan￾nuation, PAYG tax, child support, salary packaging or union fees, it’s a good idea 
to check that the corresponding payroll liability account for these deductions 
remains in balance.
In the next couple of sections, I explain how to check whether your payroll 
accounts balance and how to troubleshoot them if they don’t.
FIGURE 12-7:
The Payroll 
Activity Report 
shows payroll 
information at a 
glance, with the 
amount of 
PAYGW in the 
Taxes ($) column.314 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Checking that your payroll 
accounts balance
Ready to go? Take a look at the following steps:
1. For any payroll liability (tax, super or whatever), generate a report that 
shows how much you have to pay for the month or the quarter.
The Payroll Activity report is normally your best bet, and you can click Expand 
All to view detailed information.
2. Generate a Balance Sheet for the last day of that month or quarter.
For example, if you’re paying payroll liabilities for the month of December, 
generate a Balance Sheet with the date 31 December.
3. Identify the liability account that you want to balance.
If you’re balancing wages tax, look at the balance of PAYG Withholding Tax 
Payable. Or if you’re balancing superannuation, check out the balance of 
Superannuation Payable.
4. Check that the balance of this liability matches against what you’re 
about to pay.
For example, if you calculate that you owe $900 in superannuation for the 
month of December (according to your payroll reports), then you would expect 
the balance of Superannuation Payable in your Balance Sheet as at 31 
December to be $900 as well.
If the two amounts don’t equal one another, keep reading to find out what to 
do next.
Troubleshooting when things don’t balance
In the previous section, I explain how to match up payroll reports against payroll 
accounts so you can be sure you’re paying exactly the right amount. Sounds like a 
plan, but what if the balance in your payroll account makes no sense whatsoever? 
For example, what if your Payroll Activity report shows you owe $900 in superan￾nuation for the month of July, but when you look at the balance of Superannuation 
Payable in your Balance Sheet for the last day of July, the account balance is $2,200?
Here’s a step-by-step troubleshooting guide:
1. Look up the opening balance of the payroll liability account as at the 
beginning of the financial year.
For example, if you’re checking that superannuation balances, look at the 
opening balance of Superannuation Payable as at 1 July.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 315
2. Check what the payment was in the first month of the financial year.
For example, go to Find Transactions and look up the payroll payments made 
during July. Make sure these payments have been allocated to the correct 
payroll liability account (for example, that super payments have been allocated 
to Superannuation Payable, or PAYG tax has been allocated to PAYG 
Withholding Payable).
3. Check that the opening balance matches the amount that was paid.
Does the figure you arrived at in Step 1 match the figure from Step 2? If not, 
you have a problem, and this problem belongs to the previous financial year. 
You’re probably best in this instance to talk to your accountant or bookkeeper.
If Step 1 matches Step 2, then your problem belongs to the current year. Keep 
reading . . .
4. Generate a Payroll Activity report that shows how much was due for 
each payment period throughout the year.
If you pay monthly, generate a report for every month. If you pay quarterly, 
generate a report for every quarter.
5. Look at what you actually paid for each payment period.
Sometimes when I’m doing really serious troubleshooting, I create a simple 
spreadsheet where I show what was due in one column, and what I actually 
paid in another column.
6. Calculate the difference between what you should have paid, and what 
you did pay.
Figure out why you overpaid or underpaid and, if possible, make corrections to 
fix any errors. Any overpayments or underpayments affect the balance of your 
payroll liability account, and the cumulative total of these over- or underpay￾ments should be equal to the amount that you’re out by.
Biting the Bullet
Were they pushed or did they jump?
Recording a termination pay is similar to recording any other kind of pay, except 
that you may have a whole lot more pay items to deal with and potentially some 
different tax implications to work through. I suggest you collect all the informa￾tion you need so you can work the termination pay out on paper first and then, 
when you enter the details in MYOB, you can cross-check as you go.316 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
For example, if you are processing a voluntary cessation of employment and the 
employee worked their notice, you simply need to calculate any unused annual 
leave and pay this out, along with any regular hours worked in that pay cycle.
Some people prefer to process a final pay separately; if you do this, remember that 
annual leave is accrued on all hours worked until the cessation of employment. 
However, employees do not receive the super guarantee for unused leave that you 
pay out.
Payroll becomes complex very quickly when redundancy and terminations start 
coming up. Many variables and circumstances can impact the calculations of these 
final pays — not to mention getting the details correct for your STP reporting. 
Turn to your trusted accountant, bookkeeper or financial advisor for guidance on 
managing different payroll scenarios, or prepare to read lots of documentation 
from the ATO and Fair Work.
When you’ve recorded an employee’s final pay, go to the Payroll Details tab of the 
employee’s record (via Payroll → Employees) and record a Termination Date. This 
sets all the leave accruals to zero and stops this employee from appearing in your 
pay runs.
Although you can’t completely remove an employee from your MYOB file, you can 
hide ex-employees from your Employees list. To do so, go to the employee’s Con￾tact Details tab and click the Inactive Employee checkbox. Making employees 
inactive also prevents their names appearing when you go to process payroll.
When an employee leaves, you must also tell the ATO as soon as you can via 
STP. Go to Payroll → Single Touch Payroll Reporting, then go to the Employee 
Terminations tab. Be sure you’re in the correct payroll year and select Add Termi￾nation. Select the employee’s name, termination date and the termination reason 
from the options in the drop-down menu. To finish, click Notify the ATO.
Take care when choosing the most relevant reason for termination as this selec￾tion could form part of the separation certificate reported through to Services 
Australia, and could potentially affect an employee’s entitlements to government 
support.
Wrapping up the Payroll Year
Once you’ve processed your final pay run for the year, you need to finalise your 
payroll.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 317
PAYG payment summaries are a thing of the past, replaced by a process called STP 
finalisation, where you confirm employee totals for the full payroll year directly 
through MYOB and send them to the ATO.
Checking your payroll data
As you approach the end of the financial year, the key payroll task you need to 
complete is to ensure that at least one pay run sent to the ATO for STP has been 
accepted. This is important as you are telling the ATO you will be lodging your STP 
finalisation.
If you find you have a mix of Rejected and Accepted pay runs, resist the urge to go 
back and resend the rejected pay runs. Resending a rejected pay run may cause 
calculation issues because STP is reported as YTD values only, so sending old data 
could lead to over-reporting of data to the ATO (therefore, just ignore any earlier 
rejected pay runs). You want to ensure that the latest pay run you send has actu￾ally been marked as Accepted.
Once you’ve checked the status of your latest pay run and before you lodge your 
STP finalisation, follow these additional steps to ensure your payroll data is 
accurate:
1. Ensure all pays with a Date of Payment before 30 June have actually been 
paid by 30 June.
To confirm this has happened, check what the balance of your Payroll Clearing 
account was on 30 June (or Electronic Clearing account, if you pay employees 
in an electronic batch). If these clearing accounts have a $0.00 balance, this 
confirms that all the wages you’ve processed in this financial year have been 
paid out of your bank by 30 June.
Any outstanding balances in your Payroll or Electronic Clearing accounts need 
to be investigated. If you have a discrepancy between the Date of Payment in a 
pay run and the date the funds left your bank account (for example, perhaps 
the Date of Payment in MYOB was 30 June but your employees actually 
received this pay on 1 July), you may need to reverse the last pay run of the 
year and reprocess it with the correct Date of Payment.
2. Check your Payroll Activity and your Payroll Register reports match.
The Payroll Activity report information comes from the totals processed via a 
pay run for employees. The Payroll Register report collects its information from 
the pay history within each employee’s payment details. I implore you to check 
these two reports match before you process any pays in the new year.318 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
If the totals don’t agree, the most likely cause is that someone has added 
amounts into the pay history manually. You can only fix this error if you haven’t 
yet processed a pay run in the new financial year as the pay history rolls over 
and disappears with the start of a new payroll year, with no access to prior 
financial year data. So, check this report comparison maybe twice a year to be 
sure no one has been messing with your employees’ pay history. For more 
helpful ways to make payroll adjustments, refer to the earlier section 
‘Reversing, deleting or adjusting pays’.
If you have already processed a pay run for the new financial year, you need to 
call MYOB support in the hope that a solution can be found to repair the file.
3. Check that your Payroll Activity report matches what you have reported 
on your BAS or IAS reports throughout the year.
I suggest you create an Excel sheet to do this. In the first column, list the names 
of each month or quarter of the year; in the second and third columns, list 
Gross Wages and PAYG Tax according to your Payroll Activity report, with the 
net amount in the fourth column; in the fifth and sixth columns, list Gross 
Wages and PAYG Tax according to what you’ve reported in W1 and W2 of your 
BAS or IAS, with the net amount in the seventh column (see Figure 12-8).
Explore any discrepancies (the difference, in the eighth column, between the 
two net amounts) between Gross Wages according to MYOB and Gross Wages 
(W1) according to the ATO, and between the total tax deducted according to 
MYOB and the total tax deducted according to the ATO (W2). You can then 
adjust your June BAS figures ready for lodgement, if required, ensuring that 
your full financial year totals are the same in MYOB as the totals you report to 
the ATO via your BAS/IAS.
FIGURE 12-8:
Reconcile your 
wages in MYOB 
with the figures 
you report to the 
ATO in your 
BAS/IAS.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 319
4. Check that total wages in your Payroll Activity report matches against 
total wages in your Profit and Loss report.
If the two reports don’t match, run the reports month by month until you 
identify the difference. (The most common cause of error is if someone 
allocates an employee’s wage directly to Wages Expense without processing 
the transaction correctly in payroll.)
5. Reconcile all payroll liability accounts.
Refer to ‘Checking that your payroll accounts balance’ earlier in this chapter.
6. Create a report pack to collate all the payroll and STP reports you’ve used 
in these steps to complete the required checks.
Saving a copy of all the payroll and STP reports you used when finalising 
payroll for the year gives you a clear record for audit purposes. For complete￾ness, I suggest you also include the Leave Balance and Superannuation 
Payments reports in this pack. I explain more about report packs in Chapter 15.
Processing your STP finalisation
Now that you know you can trust your payroll data, you are ready to finalise 
your STP.
1. Go to Payroll → Single Touch Payroll Reporting, and click the EOFY 
Finalisation tab.
You’ll see the Payroll Year listed along with Year-to-Date totals for each 
employee.
Don’t panic if the Gross Payments YTD amount showing in the top right doesn’t 
appear to be the same as your Total as this amount is the disaggregation of 
your Gross amounts (categorised as Gross via STP) and it does not include 
Allowances, Lump Sums, Reportable Super and the like. In Step 2, you will 
match your totals.
2. Click View YTD Verification report and compare the totals on this report 
against your Payroll Summary report for the payroll year.
With STP Phase 2 and the increased number of ATO reporting categories, 
ensure (apart from your YTD Gross Payments and PAYG Withholding) that 
every ATO reporting category with an amount against it makes sense and 320 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
matches as you work through the comparison. The Payroll Summary report 
is best used here as it gives a great breakdown view of all these reporting 
categories, making it so much easier to check against your YTD Verification 
report.
3. If the totals don’t match, return to the STP Reports tab and click Send an 
Update Event.
Sending an update syncs your payroll data with the ATO’s data. Nine times out 
of ten, this will fix the issue, and you will find that your YTD Verification report 
now matches against your Payroll Summary report. Fingers crossed!
If you’re still finding a mismatch, go back and use the Payroll Activity report in 
the detailed view (select Expand All). Try to identify the employee and/or pay 
item involved with this difference in amount and when you find the issue, go 
and explore the employee/pay item setup to see if anything is amiss regarding 
the category setup.
Whenever you make a change that might solve the problem, go back to the 
Single Touch Payroll Reporting. Go to the STP Reports tab and click Send an 
Update Event again to push the change through to the ATO. Continue this 
process until the YTD Verification and Payroll Summary reports match 
completely.
4. Once everything matches, return to the EOFY Finalisation tab.
Figure 12-9 shows this near-final stage of the STP finalisation process.
5. If any employees receive fringe benefits, click the Enable RFBA checkbox 
and enter Reportable Fringe Benefit Amounts.
When you click the Enable RFBA checkbox in the top right, this opens an extra 
column alongside each employee’s name where you can report fringe benefits 
amounts. Do ask your accountant if you’re at all unsure about the amounts 
you need to report here.
6. Select all employees, then click Finalise and Notify the ATO.
Ensure you have the correct Payroll Year selected, and check the figures one 
last time. Tick the checkboxes to the left to select all employees, then select 
Finalise and Notify the ATO. Sign the declaration as usual, then look for the tick 
in the Final Indicator column so you know the process is complete.CHAPTER 12 Paying Your Employees 321
7. Save a copy of the YTD Verification report along with each individual 
employee’s summary report (which you can download via the three dots 
to the far right of each employee) and keep these reports in a secure 
location.
MYOB only keeps finalisation information for the current and previous 
financial years so it is vital to keep your own records. For example, if an 
employee comes back to you in a few years’ time with a payroll query, these 
saved reports may be a lifeline. I can’t tell you how many times this has 
happened in my time at MYOB — and for those with no copies, you have 
nothing to check against.
Yay to you! You’ve completed your STP finalisation for the payroll year. All that’s 
left to do now is to inform your employees that their Income Statements are 
available on their myGov accounts — and enjoy the much-deserved coffee 
break!

Working with 
MYOB Team
Managing employees can be one of the most complex jobs for a small busi￾ness, whether you’re waiting on TFN forms, following up on super 
member numbers, getting timesheets in (on time, if at all!) or rostering 
shifts. If you have lots of casual staff, managing employees can present an even 
greater challenge.
MYOB Team is a purpose-built feature that integrates with the payroll function 
in MYOB Business and AccountRight, helping you manage these employee-centred 
tasks. You can use MYOB Team via both the MYOB Team Portal (for management 
use only) or the MYOB Team self-service app (which your employees can use on 
the go).
MYOB Team is included in MYOB Business, although whether you have access 
to all the features depends on your subscription level. MYOB Team can help 
alleviate some of the burden of managing employees, making it super-easy for 
employees to view their shifts online, enter timesheets, apply for leave and view 
their pay slips.
In this chapter, I show you how to make the most of MYOB Team.

Getting Started with MYOB Team
If you’re an employer or you have an Administrator user role, you can access 
MYOB Team by going to the Payroll menu and clicking MYOB Team, which opens 
another browser tab. Here, you will need to select your business’s name; you are 
then taken to the MYOB Team Portal to set up MYOB Team.
The MYOB Team Portal is a central hub for managing all the features and functions 
of MYOB Team, such as setting up employees, preparing rosters, reviewing 
timesheets and approving leave requests. Business owners, managers and payroll 
administrators (or anyone with the Administrator user role) can access the Portal 
by going to Payroll → MYOB Team or by logging into MYOB at team.myob.com.
Employees who have not been granted the Administrator user role cannot access 
the MYOB Team Portal. Employees instead access MYOB Team via the MYOB Team 
app (which they can add to their mobile device). Head to Chapter 1 for more on 
assigning user roles.
Not all features and functions of MYOB Team are available across the board. 
AccountRight and MYOB Business Pro subscriptions give you access to all the 
functionality I cover in this chapter; however, you can’t utilise automated 
employee timesheets and the rostering functions if you’re using MYOB Business 
Lite. If you need either of these key features, upgrade your subscription as required. 
(Chapter 1 talks more about choosing the right subscription for your business.)
Figure 13-1 shows the MYOB Team Portal landing page you see when you first log 
in to MYOB Team. Here, you can see a five-step guide to getting started with 
MYOB Team.
Don’t go rogue; follow these five steps to alleviate issues down the track. 
In Figure 13-1, each item on the Step 1 checklist has been ticked off, meaning 
the Company File Setup is complete — read on to find out how to achieve this 
flying start.
As a general guide when setting up MYOB Team, remember to work along the top 
tabs shown in Figure  13-1 from right to left (starting with Employees, which 
I cover in the upcoming section ‘Adding your employees’). However, before you 
get to your employees, you first need to check your company file setup, which is 
the subject of the next section.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 325
Checking you’re good to go
To ensure a seamless transition when you connect with MYOB Team, you need to 
make a few checks in your file so you can be sure you’re pulling all the correct data 
through to the app (and your MYOB file is receiving the correct data in return). If 
everything is set up as it should be (from your business information through to your 
employees’ details), you can then make the best use of MYOB Team’s functionality.
Run through these checks before you get started (which will enable you to check 
off all the items in the Company File Setup checklist shown in Figure 13-1):
1. Go to your Settings and select Business Settings from the drop-down 
menu to check your business details are complete and correct.
Ensure your address, email and phone number are correct.
2. Next, you need to enable the use of timesheets. Return to your Settings 
and select Payroll Settings from the drop-down menu. Go to the General 
Payroll Information tab and check the Use Timesheets to Track Employee 
Hours checkbox.
3. Select the day of the week that your pay run cycle starts on from the 
drop-down options in the Week Starts On field — for example, Monday.
4. Remaining on the General Payroll Information tab, check that your 
Default Superannuation Fund is correct.
In theory, all employers should have a default superannuation fund set up for 
their business (see Figure 13-2) and offer this as an option to employees who 
start work without a superannuation fund. However, if you don’t have a default 
super fund, and no employees have yet required you to have one, you can skip 
this field for now. (You can’t use the MYOB default fund Spectrum as this is for 
demo purposes only.)
If your default super fund doesn’t appear as an option when you click the 
drop-down arrow next to the Default Superannuation Fund field, you need to 
create the super fund in your MYOB file before you can proceed. Turn to 
Chapter 11 for more on setting up your default super fund.
FIGURE 13-1:

MYOB Team).326 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
5. Click Save.
6. Head to Payroll → Employees.
A list of all active employees appears.
7. Check all employees listed have an email address in the Email column.
Employees will use this email address to log into the MYOB Team app, so 
ensure it is correct before you start sending invites. I usually recommend that 
employees use their personal email address, rather than their work email, as 
this ensures other employees can’t view the private payroll information of their 
colleagues.
8. For each employee who will be using MYOB Team, click the employee’s 
name to drill down into their payroll information.
9. Go to the Payroll Details tab and select the Salary and Wages sub-tab. In 
the Pay Details area, adjust the Pay Basis to Hourly.
10. Go to the Standard Pay sub-tab and ensure the value in the Hours (Hrs) 
field, across from Base Hourly, is set to zero (this field is likely to default 
to another value, but it needs to be zero for the employee’s timesheet 
hours to calculate correctly and not double-up).
Figure 13-3 shows the Standard Pay sub-tab, with the Base Hourly — Hours 
(Hrs) set to zero.
11. Complete steps 8 to 10 for each employee who will be using MYOB Team.

If all has gone to plan, your MYOB Team Portal landing page should show that you 
have completed Step 1 of the five-step guide to getting started with MYOB Team. 
Hurrah!
Adding your employees
Step 2 of the five-step guide to getting started involves adding your employees to 
MYOB Team.
If you have lots of employees, I suggest you start by adding just a few employees 
to MYOB Team at first, adding the rest of your employees when you’re comforta￾ble with how MYOB Team’s functionality supports your business.
Returning to the five-step checklist shown in Figure 13-1, click Step 2 — Add Your 
Employees and the Employees page appears. Click the Add Employees button and 
a list of all your employees appears in a pop-up window (their details will be 
brought in from your MYOB file). Mark the checkbox next to the employees you 
want to add to MYOB Team then click Add Employees.
FIGURE 13-3:

any doubling-up

in employee pays.328 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
As well as adding employees who will be creating timesheets, don’t forget to add 
employees who will be approving timesheets (approving managers, which I talk 
more about in the later section ‘Assigning managers and employees to locations’). 
Note: At this point, you are only adding employees to MYOB Team at your end; 
notifications have not been sent to your employees yet.
If you can’t see the five-step checklist in Figure 13-1, head directly to the Employ￾ees tab, where the Employees page appears.
OPEN TO INTERPRETATION?
While MYOB Team is an excellent time-management tool, it’s not designed to interpret 
your industry’s award (an award is a legal ruling that grants all employees in an industry 
the same minimum conditions of employment and fair wages). All hours entered via the 
MYOB Team app come through as a Base Hourly total; they’re not split between the 
different possible pay items available because MYOB cannot make this interpretation 
for you.
For example, imagine Cindy, a full-time employee, works 10 hours one day, instead of 
her rostered 8 hours, because the boss asked her to stay a little longer. Cindy will add 
10 hours to her timesheet, which her boss will happily approve. However, as MYOB 
Team doesn’t track hours worked against the award for her industry (hospitality, 
in this instance — Cindy works in a café), the 2 hours of overtime are not automatically 
allocated to the Overtime pay item. To calculate the pay run correctly, the payroll team 
at Cindy’s company will need to allocate 8 hours to the Base Hourly pay item and 
2 hours to the appropriate Overtime pay item.
Personally, I don’t mind that MYOB Team records all approved hours against the Base 
Hourly pay item because I can then easily reallocate any incorrectly recorded Base 
Hourly hours to the correct pay item. However, this does place the onus on you rather 
than the employee to accurately record hours worked to the correct pay items, as you 
are the payroll and industry award expert.
These responsibilities are fairly easy to manage if you have a small team with a simple 
industry award, but if you have a large payroll and your award is complex (the building 
and construction award, for example, has some complex allowances!) then you may 
need a helping hand. Fortunately, MYOB Business is designed to be used with helpful 
integrations from other app partners, many of which can be customised to suit your 
business. Search the MYOB App Marketplace for a suitable app that offers an award 
interpretation solution.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 329
Capturing Time and Making 
Sense of Locations
With MYOB Team, you can track hours worked at multiple locations, as well as 
track time for employees on the road. However, locations in MYOB Team are more 
than simply the physical location of the business site; instead, they encompass the 
way a particular number of employees may track their time using timesheets. You 
need to create at least one location to set up MYOB Team.
Don’t let the name fool you. Locations in MYOB Team can be used in two 
different ways:
» To represent the actual location (which can be physical, but may also cover 
different groups of similar employees, such as courier drivers that are 
frequently on the move).
» To represent the best way for employees to capture their time.
Consider these two scenarios to understand how locations in MYOB Team work:
» You have two working locations (for example, two different offices), with 
different addresses for each office, and different managers who approve the 
timesheets for the employees at each office. In this scenario, you would create 
a location for each office based on the office’s address, then add a manager at 
each office and assign employees to each office’s manager (a process I cover 
in the later section ‘Assigning managers and employees to locations’).
» You run a plumbing business, with one employee in the office full-time 
working regular hours (and whose mobile device is within easy reach for 
much of the day). You then have plumbers on the road going to different jobs 
at different times. The plumbers’ start times, lunch breaks and end times 
often vary, and during each working day they may be on the move a lot, and 
jumping from job to job. Accessing their mobile devices at the exact time 
they start their shifts, clock on or off, or take their breaks may also be more 
cumbersome. In this scenario, you would set up two different locations so 
you can offer two different time capture types for your business (rather than 
setting locations based on the physical location), so you can accommodate the 
working patterns of both the office employee (who can simply clock on and 
clock off) and the plumbers on the road (who may find it easier to complete a 
timesheet at the end of the day or week rather than complete a timesheet in 
real time).330 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
In the following sections, I help you make sense of this dual concept by explaining 
how MYOB Team can capture time in different ways to suit your business, then 
showing you how to create locations and assign employees to your locations.
Choosing your time capture type
MYOB Team provides you with three different ways to capture time:
» Clock On, Clock Off Mobile: Link this time capture type to employees who 
can capture their hours worked in real time on their mobile devices. So, if an 
employee arrives at work at 8.00am, they can log into the MYOB Team app, go 
to the Time icon and hit the Start Shift button, which enables MYOB Team to 
record the exact start time. Then, when they go on their break, they can hit 
the Start Break button and then the End Break button to record their break 
time, and when they finish for the day they can hit the End Shift button to stop 
time tracking. This time capture method works well for employees who work 
regular shifts and can easily access their mobile device while they are working.
Clock On, Clock Off Mobile is the only option you can choose if you want to 
enable geolocation (that is, if you want to ensure employees can only clock on 
and clock off within 200 metres of your business or work site’s physical 
location address — this way, you can ensure employees get paid from when 
they arrive at work rather than from when they leave home). Turn to the 
nearby sidebar ‘Where are my workers?’ to discover more about using 
geolocation, as well as the legal obligations involved.
» Clock On, Clock Off — Tablet Kiosk: With this time capture type, all hours 
worked are captured on a centralised device in a similar way to the Clock On, 
Clock Off Mobile option, as employees clock on/off in real time; however, 
employees use a shared tablet rather than a personal mobile device to track 
the hours worked. You can add all your employees to a centralised device that 
has the MYOB Team Kiosk app installed on it, which each employee then uses 
to capture their hours worked by clocking on/off when they start/finish each 
shift. This time capture method works well for cafés, restaurants and retailers 
that may not want employees to have a mobile device on them while they’re 
working.
Clock On, Clock Off — Tablet Kiosk is your only option if you want to enable 
photo capture (which takes an actual photo of each staff member when they 
clock on and off using the MYOB Team Kiosk app). Read the nearby sidebar 
‘Getting a cheeky photo in’ to find out more about using photo capture.
The MYOB Team Kiosk app is currently only available on the iPad via the Apple 
App Store.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 331
» Timesheets: With a timesheet, employees can track their hours worked using 
their own mobile device; however, they don’t need to capture their hours 
worked in real time. Instead, they can complete their timesheet by entering 
the time worked at the end of the day or the end of the week. Timesheets 
work well for employees who may be on the road or working onsite as they 
can complete their timesheets when they’re able to focus. (Timesheets are 
also helpful for employees who may forget to clock in at the correct time!)
If you use AccountRight, you have the option to link employees’ timesheets to 
Time Billing, enabling you to bill your customers for time worked on specific 
projects. Read the sidebar ‘MYOB Team and Time Billing work together’ for 
more info.
MYOB Team uses the word ‘timesheets’ in a few different ways. Timesheets are a 
specific time capture type, but all three forms of logging hours generate a 
timesheet at the end of the week (and this timesheet is later approved by an 
approving manager) — both of the Clock On, Clock Off methods simply generate 
a timesheet in a different way. And then there is the Timesheets tab in MYOB 
Team (shown in Figure  13-1), which is where approving managers view and 
approve all timesheets submitted by employees, ready to push through to the pay 
run in MYOB. Rest assured, as you start to use MYOB Team, the meaning of the 
word ‘timesheets’ should become clear as you get to know the function of each use 
of the word in context!
GETTING A CHEEKY PHOTO IN
If you use the MYOB Team Kiosk app as your time capture method, you have the ability 
to enable photo capture, which records a quick photo of employees when they tap Start 
Shift. This idea originated to help avoid time theft, which may occur if an employee who 
is running late asks another employee to clock on for them.
If you do decide to use this feature, be sure to check you understand the legal 
obligations regarding the capture and storage of employee images. Also, ensure you 
inform your employees that you use this functionality, as many people find photo 
capture to be somewhat intrusive. On a positive note, MYOB makes sure you review 
and understand your legal obligations when you set up this functionality before it allows 
you to continue.332 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Setting up a location
Once you’ve figured out the best time capture type(s) for your business, you’re 
ready to set up your first location.
To set up a location:
1. Log into the MYOB Team Portal (go to Payroll → MYOB Team or log into 
MYOB Team at team.myob.com).
MYOB TEAM AND TIME BILLING 
WORK TOGETHER
AccountRight users can access the Time Billing feature, which enables you to bill custom￾ers for the time employees have spent on a particular job.
To use MYOB Team and Time Billing features in tandem, head first to the Systems tab 
in the AccountRight Preferences menu, and select I Use Timesheets for Payroll and Time 
Billing. Next, in MYOB Team, ensure you use Timesheets as your time capture type 
(rather than either of the Clock On/Clock Off time capture options). Once Time Billing is 
enabled, employees will have two extra fields to complete when they create a timesheet 
using MYOB Team:
• Customer: Employees need to allocate hours worked to a particular customer 
when recording their time.
• Activity: Employees need to select the kind of work completed for the customer 
so that the time is charged at the appropriate rate.
Note: You need to set up the data for these fields in AccountRight before you start using 
MYOB Team for Time Billing as you can’t create new customers or activities within the 
MYOB Team app.
Once Time Billing has been enabled, whenever a timesheet is submitted and approved 
the outcome is twofold: The timesheet hours are sent both to Payroll for processing the 
pay run, and also to Time Billing. When you go to bill customers, your billing hours and 
completed activities are ready for you to add their invoices as required. The time savings 
and efficiencies you can gain from using MYOB Team in this way can be quite significant.
If you do decide to try Time Billing in AccountRight, remember that all employees who 
submit timesheets via MYOB Team will have full visibility over your entire customer 
list (names only; no other details). If that’s not a problem as they already know your 
customers anyway, then I encourage you to give Time Billing a go.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 333
2. Click Step 3 — Set Up a Location in the five-step getting started guide on 
the left of the MYOB Team Portal page, or go direct to the Locations tab 
at the top of the page.
The Locations page appears.
3. Click Create Location.
The Create Location pop-up window appears.
Figure 13-4 shows the Create Location pop-up window, where you can select 
from the three different time capture types.
4. Give your location a name.
I like to include the business’s name, suburb and time capture type in the 
Location Name field so I know at a glance which location and method of time 
capture applies. This comes in handy if you have several different locations and 
you want to add a new employee to one of them, as you can immediately see 
which location to add them to (for example, the Location Name in Figure 13-5 
is ‘Café Perth — Clock on/off’).
5. Select your address by clicking the Address drop-down arrow and finding 
the correct address for your location.
MYOB Team will try and search for the exact address for you using Google 
Maps (this is important if you use geolocation, so MYOB Team can allow an 
employee to clock on/off when they are in range of your location — see the 
nearby sidebar ‘Where are my workers?’ for more on this). You may need to try 
different combinations if the actual address doesn’t appear (for example, if you 
FIGURE 13-4:
The Create 
Location pop-up 
window.334 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
are adding 1/85 Blue St, you may need to try options like Unit 1, 85 Blue St and 
so on until you find the correct address).
If you aren’t using geolocation and therefore don’t require the exact details to 
match Google Maps, you can simply type in the address yourself.
6. Select your Time Capture Type and your Timezone.
The correct timezone is important for the two Clock On, Clock Off time capture 
types because you are recording your employees’ hours worked in real time.
Figure 13-5 shows a completed location setup.
7. Optional: If you select a Clock On, Clock Off time capture type, you can 
Enable Geolocation.
Geolocation has been enabled in the example in Figure 13-5; before you can 
finish creating your geolocation-enabled location, you need to click View My 
Legal Obligations to review these important obligations before you proceed. 
Turn to the nearby sidebar ‘Where are my workers?’ to discover more about 
using geolocation with MYOB Team.
8. Click Save.
Your location is now sitting in your Locations list (which you will find on the 
Locations tab).
FIGURE 13-5:
An example 
location setup, 
with geolocation 
enabled.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 335
Assigning managers and employees 
to locations
You’re nearly all set up, with only two last tasks required (steps 4 and 5 of the 
five-step checklist shown in Figure 13-1). You need to assign an approving man￾ger to each location, then add the employees for each location against the relevant 
approving manager.
Approving managers are responsible for reviewing and approving submitted 
timesheets. If the approving manager has Administrator user rights in the 
MYOB file, they can simply log into the MYOB Team Portal to approve timesheets 
(Chapter 1 talks about assigning user roles and types).
WHERE ARE MY WORKERS?
The geolocation capability in MYOB Team doesn’t track where your employees are at all 
hours of the day, as that would be unethical; rather, it checks where they are when they 
clock on or off. Now, for many different reasons, some employees have been known to 
take advantage of the time they are being paid for when they are on the road, such as 
by entering their start time when they leave home as opposed to being onsite. With 
geolocation enabled in MYOB Team, employees can only clock on and off using the app 
when they are within 200 metres of the Location’s address (which is cleverly calculated 
by Google Maps). This leaves no opportunity for time theft, such as by clocking on at 
home and then taking an hour’s drive to get onsite, with a stop along the way for a 
lunch run.
The concept sounds great but in reality isn’t so practical if your workers are moving 
between many different sites, as you would need to set up a new location in MYOB 
Team for every site and reallocate the employee to the new location, which may take 
a bit of time. Having all these different locations taking up space on your MYOB Team 
Portal isn’t beneficial either and may cause confusion. However, if you have locations 
that employees regularly travel between (such as an office and a factory that are quite 
a distance away from each other), then geolocation may work well for your business 
(in this example, you only need to create two locations, so geolocation helps to ensure 
employees aren’t stopping for a shopping spree when travelling from one location to 
another).
Note: Your employees will need to have their smartphone location services on, and you 
must notify them that you have enabled geolocation to track if they are 200 metres 
from the location before they can clock on/off. Read the legal notice carefully when you 
select the geolocation option for a location and ensure you understand the legal obliga￾tions involved and how they may impact your business — refer to the section ‘Setting 
up a location’ to find out more.336 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
If the approving manager isn’t an employee and doesn’t have Administrator 
access (for example, a contract bookkeeper), then you need to add this person as 
an employee first so they can access MYOB Team. Chapter 11 explains more about 
setting up an employee, but in this instance the employee’s name and email 
address should be sufficient information, though ensure you have their Pay Basis 
set to Hourly and the Hourly rate set to $0.00 because ultimately you’re not pay￾ing them as an employee. Also, be sure to select their Employment Basis as 
Other  — Not Reportable on the Employment Details tab so no details will be 
recorded for Single Touch Payroll.
To assign approving managers and add employees to locations (thus completing 
steps 4 and 5 of your MYOB Team setup):
1. Log into the MYOB Team Portal (go to Payroll → MYOB Team or log into 
MYOB Team at team.myob.com).
2. Click Step 4 — Add Approving Managers to Location in the five-step 
getting started guide on the left of the MYOB Team Portal page, or go 
direct to the Locations tab at the top of the page.
The Locations page appears.
3. Find the Location and click the Location Name you need.
The selected Location’s page appears.
4. Locate and select the approving manager from the drop-down list of 
employees under Select an Approving Manager.
5. Click the Add and Invite button.
The selected employee appears on the Employee list for the location showing 
the Role of Approving Manager has been assigned. The approving manager 
will then receive an email notification advising them to join MYOB Team (see 
Figure 13-6). (Note: The notification is always the same, even if the approving 
manager is already using MYOB Team.)
Now you have added the approving manager, you are ready to add employees to 
the location, under their approving manager.
1. If you are not already on the Location’s page, go to the Locations tab and 
click the Location Name (alternatively, click Step 5 — Add Employees to 
Location in the five-step getting started guide on the left of the MYOB 
Team Portal page).
2. In the Employee list, click the approving manager’s name.
When you click the manager’s name, a pop-up window appears where you can 
select the employees you want to assign to this manager.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 337
3. Click the Select Employee drop-down arrow to locate and select the 
employee, and then click Add.
You can only add one name at a time.
4. Once you have finished adding employees to this approving manager, 
click the Save and Invite button.
The employee(s) will then receive an email notification advising them to join 
MYOB Team.
It makes sense for employees to receive this notification invitation once they 
are assigned to a location because when they log into the MYOB Team app, the 
required time capture type will have already been assigned to them and they 
can get started straight away.
Figure 13-6 shows a sample of the email employees will receive — there’s 
nothing to accept, just some information about MYOB Team and clarification 
on which email to use to log in.
FIGURE 13-6:
An email 
invitation to join 
MYOB Team.338 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
When you have allocated all employees to an approving manager, your Location’s 
page should look similar to Figure 13-7.
The first time an employee logs into MYOB Team, the app prompts them to set up 
a security password. If they’re already using MYOB with the same email, they can 
log in using the same MYOB password. The next time they log into the app, MYOB 
Team offers employees the option to set up a four-digit passcode so they don’t 
need to log in every time they want to use the app.
You can have more than one approving manager in a location (which is helpful if 
an approving manager goes on leave), but an employee can only be assigned to 
one approving manager at a time. Therefore, when one approving manager goes 
on leave, you need to reassign employees to another approving manager for that 
short period of time, then reassign them back to the first approving manager 
when they return from leave. To reassign an employee, tick the square to the left 
of the employee’s name on the Location’s page and a box will appear at the top of 
the list saying Reassign Employee To  .  .  . Click the accompanying drop-down 
arrow and select the alternative approving manager to temporarily reassign an 
alternative approving manager as required.
Using MYOB Team: For Employees
Once you have added locations and assigned employees to approving managers, 
your employees can start using MYOB Team to add their timesheets (using any of 
the three time capture types), clock their hours and apply for leave.
Within your MYOB file, you also have the Timesheets report (which you can find 
by going to Reporting → Reports and heading to the Payroll tab) that captures all 
the timesheets approved in the MYOB Team app for safekeeping.
FIGURE 13-7:
Employees added

under their 
approving 
manager.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 339
Employees using MYOB Team usually find it easy to navigate the MYOB Team app. 
In all the years I have been using it with various clients, I have only had two 
employees get in touch for help — one asking me what their Apple ID was so they 
could download the app, and another who couldn’t get MYOB Team to work. Both 
times, I discovered they were trying to log in with a work email when they had set 
up MYOB Team using a personal email address.
The email notification employees receive (refer to Figure 13-6) provides a good 
overview of how MYOB Team works, as well as a link to the MYOB Team Help page 
should they require further guidance. Figure 13-8 shows the home screen of an 
approving manager on the MYOB Team app (the only difference for employees 
being that they won’t have access to the Approve options).
In the following sections, I take you and your employees through submitting 
timesheets and leave requests, as well as provide some tips on how you and your 
team can get the best out of MYOB Team.
FIGURE 13-8:
The home screen 
of an approving 
manager on the 
MYOB Team app.340 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Using timesheets and submitting 
leave requests
As well as submitting timesheets, employees can use the MYOB Team app to 
request annual and personal leave. This is primarily for the benefit of processing 
payroll, but keeping these records also helps you adhere to the requirements set 
by the Fair Work Commission.
Logging work hours for approval
Here’s how employees can record their working hours using either the Clock On, 
Clock Off Mobile or Clock On, Clock Off — Tablet Kiosk method of time capture:
1. Log into the MYOB Team app.
The MYOB Team app’s home screen appears.
If employees are using the Clock On, Clock Off — Tablet Kiosk method of time 
capture, the business owner must first log into the device where times are 
being recorded (all employees use the same app on the one device).
2. Select Time from the options at the bottom of the screen.
If the employee arrives at the home screen, they can also tap the Capture Your 
Time button.
3. Employees using the MYOB Team Kiosk app via an iPad (the Clock On, 
Clock Off — Tablet Kiosk method of time capture) must select their name 
from the employee list that appears before they can start tracking their 
time. Employees using the Clock On, Clock Off Mobile method of time 
capture can skip straight to Step 4.
4. The employee then records their working day using the Start Shift, Start 
Break, End Break and End Shift buttons.
5. At the end of each day, the employee reviews the summary of their 
timesheet and clicks Submit.
At this point, employees can also add a comment (up to 100 characters) if they 
need to notify the manager of any changes to a regular shift, such as ‘Went 
home early unwell’.
For employees recording their working hours using the Timesheets method of 
time capture, here’s what to do:
1. Log into the MYOB Team app.
The MYOB Team app’s home screen appears.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 341
2. Select Time from the options at the bottom of the screen.
The Timesheets page opens.
3. Tap the + symbol to add a timesheet.
4. Select the date.
5. Record the working day using the Start Shift, Start Break, End Break and 
End Shift buttons.
6. Review the total hours worked to ensure they are correct.
Employees can also add a comment here if required.
7. Select Submit.
Employees will then be returned to the Timesheets page, where they can see a 
summary of all their unapproved timesheets.
Applying for leave
Employees can also apply for annual or personal leave:
1. Log into the MYOB Team app.
The MYOB Team app’s home screen appears.
2. Select Apply for Leave.
The Leave page appears.
The Apply for Leave option only appears if the employee is entitled to annual 
or personal leave (that is, they work full-time or part-time) and Leave Accruals 
have been set up within the employee’s card (Chapter 11 guides you through 
setting up employee leave, while Chapter 12 covers managing and paying 
leave).
3. Tap the + symbol in the top right to add a Leave request.
The Leave Request page opens.
4. The employee is prompted to select their leave reason from the options 
provided (such as Annual Leave or Personal Leave), then select the length 
of leave and the dates and times required.
5. Optional: Employees can add a Note here, if helpful (for example, if they 
go home sick for part of the day).
If this is a workplace with a 38-hour week, one full day of standard leave in 
MYOB Team appears as 7.36, meaning 7 hours and 36 minutes (which, in 
terms of the proportion of hours, is 7.6 hours). Odd as this may look, this is 
correct. If an employee’s leave request is for more hours (say 8 hours) or fewer 342 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
hours (say 6 hours), they are best selecting the ‘Less than one full day’ option 
(I know it doesn’t seem right for employees working longer days!) so that they 
can then apply for a full day of leave and add the exact number of hours 
required.
6. Click Submit.
The leave request is then sent to the approving manager for approval.
An employee can only delete a leave application if it is still pending approval. 
There is no edit option, so if they make a mistake they will need to delete the 
request and redo the application.
Making work life easier with MYOB Team
MYOB Team has a number of features designed to make your employees’ work 
lives easier. Here are just a few of the most helpful functions:
» Employees can view their shifts on the Roster tab. Here, employees view 
their own shifts only. The upcoming section ‘Creating and Viewing Rosters’ 
takes you through how to use rosters.
» Pay slips are available for three months. Employees can also self-serve 
their pay slips, rather than hunting through emails for old pay slips.
» Employees can manage their profile. Tap the More option on the app’s 
home screen to open the Menu page and select Profile. Here, the employee 
can enter or update their personal details, such as their name, phone 
number, address and bank details, as well as their TFN and related tax options 
(such as if they are claiming the tax-free threshold), along with their super 
fund details. Giving employees the ability to make these changes themselves 
is a pretty powerful feature and the changes, once saved, will simultaneously 
be updated within the employee’s card in MYOB.
» Employees can set up a four-digit pin code for the MYOB Team app for 
added security. A pin number also avoids the need to enter an email and 
password each time, which helps to make logging in easier.
Creating and Viewing Rosters
My daughter Jasmine had her first job at a local retail store. The roster was put up 
on the office wall every Monday morning for all to see — well, everyone who was 
there that day, so she had to call in every Monday and ask someone to confirm her CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 343
shifts for the week. As you may imagine, not only were many shifts missed, but 
she would sometimes show up at work to find the roster had changed without 
notice.
Using the MYOB Team Portal, you can create rosters for shifts online so employees 
can view their shifts via the MYOB Team app, which is a much easier solution than 
asking employees to check a chart on the office wall! Rosters are easy to create, 
with the added bonus that once you’ve set up your first roster, you can duplicate 
this to create new rosters as required.
To set up a roster, follow these simple steps:
1. Log into the MYOB Team Portal (go to Payroll → MYOB Team or log into 
MYOB Team at team.myob.com).
2. Click the Roster tab.
The Roster page appears.
Rosters can only be created via the MYOB Team Portal.
3. Click Create Roster.
4. Click Create Roster again if you are creating a new roster, or click 
Duplicate Roster if you want to create a copy of an existing roster.
The Create Roster pop-up window appears.
5. Select your location in the Location field (the location you want to create 
the roster for).
6. Choose the week you are creating the roster for in the Week field.
Rosters are only created one week at a time.
7. Click the Add button.
The roster appears, showing all the employees assigned to the location.
8. Click into the first day of the week for the first employee you are assign￾ing a shift to, and add the shift times as required.
The box will expand to include a Start Time, End Time and Break (Mins). Times 
will display in 24-hour format and the Break (unpaid) should be in minutes (see 
Figure 13-9).
A cool feature is that the roster calculates the total time per employee, per day 
and per week so if you have a wages budget, you can use the totals to help you 
plan your shifts accordingly.344 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
9. Repeat Step 8 for all days and all employees as needed, until you have 
added all the required shifts for the roster.
The Duplicate Roster option can start to seem beneficial at this point if you 
have many employees!
10. Click the Publish Roster button.
Figure 13-9 shows a roster ready to publish. Once published, all employees can 
view only their own shifts via the MYOB Team app.
Managing Approvals Using MYOB Team
As soon as your employees start using MYOB to record timesheets and submit 
leave requests, the onus is on you as the employer to complete the cycle and 
approve the submitted information.
Approving timesheets
Once your employees have submitted their online timesheets, the approving man￾ager needs to approve these timesheets so that the information can be sent 
FIGURE 13-9:
A roster, ready to 
publish so all 
employees can 
see their shifts via 
the MYOB 
Team app.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 345
through to payroll ready for the next pay run. Approving managers can also edit, 
add and delete timesheets.
You can approve timesheets via the MYOB Team Portal. Log into the Portal (go to 
Payroll → MYOB Team on your desktop) and go to the Timesheets tab. Ensure your 
filters are set to show the correct location and dates selected. Check the box to the 
left of an employee and the Approval options will appear, then simply click the 
required option to approve the submitted hours.
If you want to see the details of the timesheet day by day, including start, finish 
and break times, simply click the drop-down arrow to the far right of each 
employee.
Timesheets can also be approved via the MYOB Team app. Log into the MYOB 
Team app and click Approve Timesheets (refer to Figure 13-8). A new tab opens 
that shows your employees’ submitted timesheets. Click into each employee to 
review and approve their timesheets.
I much prefer to approve timesheets using the MYOB Team Portal (via a desktop) 
as I feel the view is much better here, and I can also delete or add timesheets as 
required. However, being able to approve timesheets via the MYOB Team app on 
the go also has its time and place. For example, the ability to approve on the go is 
great for urgent timesheet approvals.
Things to note when reviewing and approving timesheets:
» You can view an employee’s timesheets one week at a time, in summary 
or in detail. On the MYOB Team Portal, the initial view shows a summary 
view, including all employees, locations, time capture types, rostered hours, 
submitted hours and the number of timesheets pending approval. Click the 
drop-down arrow next to an employee’s name to expand the details and see 
the start and end time details for their timesheet, plus any notes the 
employee may have added.
Using the app, you need to scroll through each timesheet one at a time to 
view and approve timesheets, so the approval process takes a little longer.
» You can edit or delete timesheets. You can only edit or delete timesheets if 
the timesheet is still in Pending. In the expanded view, to the far right of the 
timesheet in question, click the ellipsis button (the three dots to the right) and 
choose to edit or delete the timesheet as needed. Clicking Edit opens the 
timesheet, which you can save once fixed.346 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
» You can approve submitted or rostered hours. Rostered hours are prefilled 
hours based on the completed roster from that same week. The rostered 
hours approval overrides the hours the employee enters, but do be alert for 
any significant differences between these hours and the hours the employee 
has recorded. You can only approve one week at a time, even if your pay cycle 
is fortnightly.
To approve submitted or rostered hours on the MYOB Team Portal, simply 
tick the boxes to the left of the date and the Approve options appear above 
the employee’s name. (These approval options are also available when 
approving hours using the MYOB Team app.)
» Once timesheets are approved, all hours worked will be pushed through 
to payroll. The total hours worked for each employee go through to payroll 
as a total under the Base Hourly pay item within the relevant pay run. It is up 
to you to split out these total hours into other relevant pay items (such as 
Overtime) during the payroll process. You can then complete your pay run 
(refer to Chapter 12 for how to complete a pay run).
After you approve a timesheet, the Approval Status on the MYOB Team Portal 
changes to Approved, so you know the timesheet has been pushed through 
to payroll in your file. Figure 13-10 shows the Timesheets page with Approved 
timesheets.
If you have photo capture or geolocation enabled, you can view this data as part of 
your approving process. Simply expand the timesheets via the drop-down 
arrow to the far right, and under the Evidence column that appears, you have the 
opportunity to select View to display the images and evidence related to these 
functions.
FIGURE 13-10:
Timesheets being 
approved via the 
MYOB Team 
Portal.CHAPTER 13 Working with MYOB Team 347
Approving leave
Oh glorious leave, doesn’t everyone love being on holiday from work! You need to 
process and capture all leave applications accurately so you can trust your leave 
balances in MYOB and know that what employees see on their pay slips is in fact 
correct.
Employees can apply for leave via the MYOB Team app if they are entitled to do so 
and if you’ve selected their leave entitlements during employee setup. They sim￾ply need to choose the type of leave and how much time they want to take as leave 
(or may already have taken, if personal leave). Refer to the earlier section ‘Using 
timesheets and submitting leave requests’ for more on how employees can apply 
for leave.
Employees can also add information via the Notes section of their leave applica￾tion, which works well to communicate additional information to payroll so that 
nothing gets missed, such as if they’ve already submitted a timesheet for a full 
day but went home sick for half the day.
You can approve leave via both the MYOB Team Portal and the MYOB Team app. 
The approval process works in much the same way as approving timesheets (refer 
to the preceding section ‘Approving timesheets’) and the results flow directly into 
your payroll, adding the hours approved to the employee’s leave record.
If a leave request has been submitted, employees need to ensure they are not dou￾bling up and adding a timesheet for the same day(s). Once leave has been approved, 
it cannot be deleted and will go through to payroll, where any leave adjustments 
required can be made.
Refer to Chapter 12 for further guidance on processing a pay run.CHAPTER 14 Taking Electronic Payments to the Next Level 349
Chapter 14
Taking Electronic 
Payments to the 
Next Level
I
n this chapter, I explain how to make electronic payments using batch payment 
files generated from MYOB. With this method, you record supplier or employee 
payments in your MYOB file, create a batch payment file, and then open this 
batch file in your internet banking to send multiple payments as a single 
transaction.
This method is quite different from how you’re probably doing things right now. 
If you’re new to using accounting software, I’m guessing you’re still recording 
individual employee pays or supplier payments in MYOB, then switching over to 
your internet banking and entering these payments again, one at a time.
Using MYOB to make electronic payments is a game changer, because once you 
make the switch, you only enter supplier and employee payments once, not twice. 
Furthermore, working in this way reduces the errors that inevitably arise when 
you have to first record payments in MYOB, and then repeat those transactions 
one by one in your internet banking.
In this chapter, I take you through the process of preparing and creating electronic 
payments from MYOB, including how to resolve payment errors when they occur.
IN THIS CHAPTER

payments
» Paying suppliers and employees 
electronically
» Repairing payment errors350 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
Getting Ready for Electronic Payments
Okay, so I’m assuming that you want to use MYOB to streamline your electronic 
payments, first recording payments in MYOB, then preparing an Australian Bank￾ing Association (ABA) electronic payment file that you upload to your internet 
banking so the payments go to your suppliers and employees.
If you make more than a handful of supplier or employee payments a week, you’ll 
find that working in this way makes sense. Using MYOB to generate electronic 
payments is also popular with accountants and bookkeepers who may be process￾ing payroll on behalf of a client (but who don’t want to have access to their client’s 
bank account). By creating an ABA file, accountants and bookkeepers can com￾plete their clients’ end-to-end payroll, then send the client the ABA file so that 
the client can make the payment themselves using their internet banking (know￾ing their accountant or bookkeeper has taken care of the MYOB side of things).
Before jumping all in, check with your bank that you can make payments via an 
ABA file and if you need to enable this for your online banking accounts.
All good so far? Then now’s the time to get started.
Setting up supplier details
In order to pay suppliers, you first need to enter their bank account details in your 
MYOB file, as follows:
1. Go to Contacts → All Contacts.
The Contacts page appears.
2. From the Contact Type field, select Supplier.
3. Using the Search field, locate the supplier. Click the supplier’s name in 
the Name column.
The supplier’s contact page appears.
If you need to create a new supplier, turn to Chapter 2.
4. Scroll down to the supplier’s banking information and enter their bank 
details.
Enter the BSB Number, Bank Account Number and Bank Account Name. 
(The BSB Number is a six-digit code that represents the bank’s name 
and branch.)CHAPTER 14 Taking Electronic Payments to the Next Level 351
5. Complete the Statement Text and Remittance Advice Email address.
As the Statement Text, enter what you want this supplier to see on their bank 
statement when they receive your payment. This could be your business name 
or customer account number.
Add the supplier’s email in the Remittance Advice Email field so that when you 
make a payment, you can easily send a remittance advice at the same time.
Figure 14-1 shows a supplier’s completed banking details.
6. Double-check (even triple-check) the banking details.
I don’t think I can say this enough but check, check and check again when 
recording banking details. Even if you only enter one teeny-weeny figure 
incorrectly, your bank may still happily transfer money to the wrong bank 
account — and trying to get your money back is virtually impossible. Random 
acts of kindness are one thing, but donating funds to complete strangers is 
pretty extreme.
7. Click the green Save button.
Setting up employee details
Setting up employees is not that different to setting up suppliers. Follow this sim￾ilar process to help you put the pieces together:
1. Go to Payroll → Employees.
The Employees page appears.
2. Locate the employee using the Search field. Click the employee’s name in 
the Name column.
The employee’s contact page appears.
FIGURE 14-1:
Entering banking 
details for a 
supplier.352 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
If you need to create a new employee, turn to Chapter 11.
3. Go to the Payment Details tab.
4. Select Electronic as the Payment Method.
If you’ve used MYOB’s Employee Onboarding tool to set up your employees, 
the employee’s payment method may already be set to Electronic.
5. Enter the employee’s banking details.
Enter the BSB Number, Account Number and Account Name.
You can direct your employees’ funds to three different bank accounts at their 
request. You may ask, ‘Why would someone do that?’ — and the answer is they 
may want to divert their wages into different accounts to cover their expenses 
with minimal fuss (so maybe they cover the mortgage from one account, while 
putting some money into savings and then sending the remaining balance to 
their everyday spending account). If your employees are this financially switched 
on, simply change the number in the Split Net Pay Between field and a new 
section will appear so you can enter the other bank account details required.
Figure 14-2 shows an employee’s completed bank account details.
6. Leave the Bank Statement Text blank.
If you leave the Bank Statement Text blank, the default message that employ￾ees will receive on their bank statements is ‘PAY FOR’ followed by the pay 
period (for example PAY FOR 23/4/2024), which is about as clear a message as 
you could wish for.
7. Double-check and triple-check the banking details.
8. Click the green Save button.
FIGURE 14-2:
Entering banking 
details for an 
employee.CHAPTER 14 Taking Electronic Payments to the Next Level 353
Hooking up your bank account
Now your suppliers and employees are set up, you need to enter your bank details. 
Here’s how:
1. Go to Accounting → Chart of Accounts.
2. Click the Account Name of the bank account from which you will be 
making electronic payments.
The Edit Account page appears.
3. If you haven’t already done so, complete your banking details.
Enter your BSB, Bank Account Number and Bank Account Name, as well as 
your Company Trading Name.
4. Tick I Create ABA Bank Files for This Account.
Two additional fields pop up when you tick this checkbox (Bank Code and 
Direct Entry User ID), as well as the Include a Self-Balancing Transaction 
checkbox:
• The Bank Code is a three-letter code that identifies your bank (NAB, CBA, 
WBC and so on).
GUARD YOURSELF AGAINST ONLINE FRAUD
The most common way employees do the dirty is by substituting a supplier’s banking 
details with their own. (Although banks ask for an account name, the only thing the 
bank matches when making a transfer is the account number and branch.)
If you’re a business owner — rather than a bookkeeper — remember that even if you 
authorise all the electronic payments your bookkeeper prepares for you, you certainly 
won’t have time to check the bank account details for every person or company listed 
on every payment. In other words, the account name on a payment may be that of a 
known supplier, but the banking details could have been changed.
To combat this potential vulnerability, I suggest you spot-check account details on a reg￾ular basis (and ever-so-casually let your bookkeeper know you do so). You can also 
restrict access of users to just the particular areas of the file they need rather than giv￾ing access to everything (refer to Chapter 1 for more about passwords and security).
To further protect your funds, whenever you update bank details for suppliers and 
employees, MYOB sends the file owner a security email to alert them of the changes.354 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
• Your Direct Entry User ID is a special code that your bank gives you when 
you register for internet banking. For ANZ, NAB and Westpac, the User ID is 
000000; for the Commonwealth Bank, the User ID is 301500. For any other 
financial institution, you will need to contact them, explain you want to use 
ABA files for paying suppliers or employees, and ask for the Direct Entry 
User ID (or APCA ID).
• You only need to tick Include a Self-Balancing Transaction if your bank 
requires a self-balancing transaction (most banks do) for each electronic 
payment you lodge. Ask your bank (or do a Google search) to see if a 
self-balancing transaction is required.
5. Double-check (and triple-check!) the bank details you’ve entered.
6. Click the green Save button.
To see how the completed bank account details section looks, check out Figure 14-3. 
(Please feel free to credit this account at any time!)
FIGURE 14-3:

Checking your linked accounts
Before you start making electronic payments, you need to make one final check 
before lift-off. The electronic payments you process in MYOB need to sit some￾where until the funds clear from your bank account, ready to be matched — which 
is where your linked accounts come in. (Chapter 2 explains the logic behind linked 
accounts.)
To check your linked accounts, go to Accounting → Manage Linked Accounts. On 
the first tab (Accounts & Banking) you should see that the Bank Account for Elec￾tronic Payments is going to your Electronic Clearing Account.
Here, you are checking the linked account where MYOB parks the electronic pay￾ment transaction for you, ready for you to match it to the payment coming out of 
your bank.
Making Your First Electronic Payment
So, you’re ready to record your first electronic payment using MYOB? The follow￾ing sections explain what happens next.
Creating supplier payments
Making an electronic payments ABA file, ready to send to the bank, is easy. Here’s 
how it’s done:
1. Go to create a supplier payment in the normal way.
Create your supplier payments the same way you normally do through the 
Purchases menu (refer to Chapter 8 for more details).
2. Tick the Electronic Payment checkbox under the Supplier field.
When you tick Electronic Payment, the Bank Account changes to the Electronic 
Clearing Account, which groups this electronic payment into a batch with any 
other electronic payments you make on the same day. Figure 14-4 shows an 
example of a supplier payment via the Electronic Clearing Account.
3. Check the words in the Statement Text field.
I tend to include my business name in the Statement Text field. Alternatively, 
you could add invoice numbers but, seeing as you will likely also send remit￾tance advices, the name should suffice.356 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
The statement text you enter will appear on your supplier’s bank statement, 
helping them to identify where the payment is coming from.
The first few times you process electronic payments for a supplier, you may 
want to double-check the supplier’s bank details are correct. To do this, 
I recommend you open another browser tab with your supplier’s contact 
information so you can check everything matches.
4. Optional: Add any important notes in the Description of Transaction 
field.
If you don’t type anything here, MYOB automatically records the words 
‘Payment’ followed by the supplier name once you save the transaction. 
Note that whatever you record here, this description will appear both on 
the supplier’s remittance advice and also in your transaction reports.
5. Tick the bills you want to pay from the list of purchases for this supplier 
(don’t forget to check the Total Amount Paid at the bottom of the 
Amount Paid ($) column).
When ticked, the amount in the Amount Paid ($) column defaults to apply 
the money owed in full. You can edit this amount if you only want to make 
a part-payment, or you can add a discount if a supplier has offered you one 
(for example, for paying early). Chapter 8 talks more about supplier payments.
6. Choose if you want to send a remittance advice now or later (or never).
Chapter 8 explains everything you need to know about sending remittance 
advices.
7. Save your payment and repeat this process for anyone else you plan to 
pay electronically on the same day.
After you save your first electronic payment, record any other payments that 
you want to make electronically in the exact same way so that you can 
combine all your payments in one batch.
To cross-check your totals when creating supplier payments, print the Unpaid 
Invoices report that you have reconciled all your supplier statements to. As you 
create each payment, check off the total owing with the total amount paid against 
this report. Bookkeeping is all about the checking and the double-checking  — 
especially important when you’re paying out money!
You’re now ready to process all electronic payments together in one batch and 
produce your ABA file to upload and pay via internet banking. To find out what to 
do next, see the upcoming section ‘Preparing your bank file for processing’.CHAPTER 14 Taking Electronic Payments to the Next Level 357
Recording employee payments
Before you attempt to pay employees electronically, first go to each employee’s 
Contact, select Electronic as the Payment Method and complete the employee’s 
banking info. (Refer to the section ‘Setting up employee details’, earlier in this 
chapter, for more details.)
With your setup complete, recording employee payments is easy-peasy. Simply 
record pays in the normal way, as described in Chapter 12, until you come to the 
option to Pay Employees Via Electronic Payments. This takes you to the Prepare 
Electronic Payments window, from where you can create electronic payments. 
Read on to find out more. . .
Preparing your bank file for processing
If you are using the Electronic Payment method to record supplier or employee 
payments, each payment goes into a batch with all other payments that you’ve 
FIGURE 14-4:
Select Electronic 
Payment to 
indicate that you 
intend to pay a 
supplier 
electronically.358 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
marked for electronic processing. When you’re ready to process these payments 
and create the ABA bank file, this is what you do:
1. Go to Banking → Prepare Electronic Payments.
2. Select Pay Bills or Pay Employees from the Payment Type menu.
I recommend you keep payment batches for employee pays and supplier 
payments separate. If you happen to have both wages and supplier payments 
on the same day, filtering your selection using the Payment Type menu 
enables you to separate these payments into two separate batches.
3. Look at what comes up and consider whether it’s reasonable.
If no transactions appear, or you can’t see all the transactions that you know 
should be there, chances are you may have missed ticking the Electronic 
Payment option when processing a payment. To resolve this problem, simply 
find the payment in question (Find Transactions under the Banking menu is 
usually the easiest method) and make sure you’ve checked the Electronic 
Payment checkbox. (The other culprit for no-shows here is if you’ve selected 
the wrong date range at the top of the Prepare Electronic Payments page — 
expanding the date range may help you identify the issue.)
If you find that a whole swag of transactions appear, dating back to the 1980s, 
it’s probably because you’ve been using MYOB for a while and other transac￾tions were allocated to your Electronic Clearing account in the past. For details 
of how to extricate yourself from this particular dilemma, see the nearby 
sidebar ‘When old payments clog up the works’.
4. In the Account field, select which bank account you want to make the 
payment from.
This is usually your business bank account or something similar (refer to 
the earlier section ‘Hooking up your bank account’ for more on this).
5. Review the text in the Description of Transaction field.
Make the text meaningful as it may be useful in your reporting, so find a 
naming convention that makes sense to you and try to stick to it.
6. Check the date in the Date of Payment field.
This is also the date that your bank will process the electronic payment, so 
choose the date that you want these payments to go out of your bank account. 
If you’re creating this file after-hours, choose the next day as your date — 
otherwise, your bank may get nasty and reject the file. You can even choose to 
process payments to be made at a future date — great if you’re going away on 
hols! Check with your bank how far in the future it will allow. (You definitely 
can’t choose a date in the past though!)CHAPTER 14 Taking Electronic Payments to the Next Level 359
7. Select the payments you want to process.
Select all payments you want to process in this batch by clicking in the far-left 
column (next to the Date heading), as shown in Figure 14-5.
8. Click the Download Bank File button.
A pop-up window appears to inform you what will happen next, such as to 
confirm that the transaction will be recorded or alert you to any issues.
9. If you are happy, click the Download Bank File button in the pop-up 
window.
The file will now be sitting in your Downloads folder on your computer.
10. Log in to your internet banking and upload the bank (ABA) file for 
payment.
If you’re unsure about the process at your bank’s end of things, reach out to 
your bank as every bank has a slightly different process.
11. Log in to internet banking to upload and pay.
When you upload the bank (ABA) file, do one final review of the details to 
ensure the totals match to the electronic payment in your MYOB file that you 
generated. Don’t forget to also check the payment date so the bank payment 
and the MYOB payment will match. You can never double-check enough!

Fixing Payments When Something 
Goes Wrong
At some point you are likely to have to deal with fixing an electronic payment. 
Common errors include if you get a bank account number wrong (maybe a sup￾plier has changed its bank details) or you try to process a payment when you don’t 
have enough money in your account (yep, it happens).
Now, depending on what needs changing or fixing, you may need to delve into the 
grouped electronic payment or go to the individual payment within the batch. If 
you’re solving such problems for the first time, before you jump in and start 
changing things, I suggest you map out the steps you need to follow to undo the 
mistake, and then resolve the issue by redoing the payment. By tracking your 
progress, you can tick off the steps as you go.
WHEN A SUPPLIER ONLY ACCEPTS BPAY
You can’t use electronic payments to pay suppliers that only accept BPAY, such as 
Telstra or Origin. For suppliers that only accept BPAY, my preference is to pay them 
directly through my internet banking. Alternatively, some of my clients prefer to set up 
direct debits so that payment is made automatically on the due date. Either way, you 
can create a rule so that when the payment comes through on your bank feed, it’s 
automatically allocated.
WHEN OLD PAYMENTS 
CLOG UP THE WORKS
Sometimes when you first try to prepare electronic payments, you find that a whole 
bunch of transactions appear, dating months or even years back for a variety of rea￾sons. Don’t sweat. While you can’t remove these in bulk, here is a great workaround. 
You can get rid of these old transactions by heading to your Chart of Accounts and 
creating a new Electronic Payments account (make sure you select Bank as the Account 
Type). Then, go to Manage Linked Accounts (found under Accounting) and click the 
Accounts & Banking tab. Select this new account as your Bank Account for Electronic 
Payments and you will never have to see the old transactions appear again.CHAPTER 14 Taking Electronic Payments to the Next Level 361
Here are some common scenarios you may need to resolve, and the solutions:
» You recorded the electronic payment incorrectly. Perhaps you realise you 
don’t have enough funds to pay all the suppliers you wanted today, so you 
decide to recreate the ABA bank file. You need to delete the whole grouped 
electronic payment, pushing the payments back to the Prepare Electronic 
Payments page so you can generate the ABA file again. (Don’t worry — by 
deleting the grouped payment, you’re not removing the individual supplier 
payments.)
You can find the grouped (or batch) payment by going to Banking → Find 
Transactions and locating the Electronic Clearing account via the Account 
filter. Find the grouped payment, click into the payment and click Delete. 
When you’ve undone the incorrect grouped payment, you can go back to 
Prepare Electronic Payments and create the grouped payment you require 
(refer to the earlier section ‘Preparing your bank file for processing’ for the 
steps here).
» You have the wrong bank details saved for a supplier. Assuming you 
haven’t processed the ABA file in your internet banking yet, you have two 
options: 1) Edit the ABA file or 2) delete the supplier payment, update the 
supplier’s bank details and then recreate the ABA file.
Whether you can edit your ABA file (after you’ve uploaded the file) depends on 
whether your bank allows you to do so, but if you feel confident enough to 
make changes at this stage of the process, this solution is by far the quickest 
and easiest way around the problem. (Don’t forget to go back and fix the bank 
details in the supplier contact for next time.)
The second option is to correct the error. First, you need to remove the 
electronic batch file to which this supplier payment belongs, as explained in 
the solution to the first scenario in this list. Then, refer to Chapter 8 to help 
you delete the supplier payment. Finally, update the supplier’s bank details as 
required, and then recreate the supplier payment, the electronic batch to 
which this payment belonged, and the ABA file.
» You can’t find the ABA file. You’ve searched high and low, you’ve got your 
best Sherlock cap on and yet the ABA file you’ve created is nowhere to be 
found. Fortunately, this problem has an easy fix. You can find the grouped (or 
batch) payment by going to Banking → Find Transactions and locating the 
Electronic Clearing account via the Account filter. Find the grouped payment, 
click into the payment, and click Download Bank File to regenerate the ABA 
file, as per Figure 14-6.362 PART 3 Taking the Next Step
FIGURE 14-6:
You can 
re-download an

already recorded.
THE MYSTERIOUS ELECTRONIC 
CLEARING ACCOUNT
Whenever you record an electronic payment, you need to select the Electronic Payment 
option. By working in this way, this payment doesn’t come out of your business bank 
account (in MYOB) but instead comes out of a special electronic clearing account. This 
process allows you to group these individual payments together so everything balances.
When you’re ready to process these payments in MYOB, you go to Prepare Electronic 
Payments. After they’re processed, the combined total comes out of your business bank 
account and goes to offset the electronic clearing account in MYOB. The balance of your 
electronic clearing account (which doesn’t exist in reality and is just a mythical creation) 
should always start with zero and return to zero.
The moral of the story? If you see that the balance of your electronic clearing account 
isn’t zero (assuming you’ve processed all electronic payments at that point), you have a 
problem. You may even have left a lonely payment on the Prepare Electronic Payments 
page (perhaps it had the wrong date so it hasn’t yet been processed). Try to figure out 
when it went out of balance to explore the issue.
One of the easiest ways to troubleshoot clearing accounts is to go to Reconcile Accounts 
(under the Banking menu), select the clearing account in question, and click off all the 
withdrawals and deposits, making sure that the New Statement Balance is $0.00 every 
time you click the Reconcile button. After you match all possible transactions, the trans￾action or transactions that remain should be the ones that are causing the problem.4

Reporting for Business
Beneath its cool, calm exterior, your MYOB file is a seething mass of infor￾mation. With a few clicks, it reveals a squillion business reports, all of which 
can be customised in different ways to suit the needs of your business.
The invaluable information in your reporting is what separates MYOB Business 
from a giant calculator — all the data you enter in your file is ultimately for the 
purpose of Reporting. Apart from the obvious reasons of accounting and record￾keeping, it is to help you make decisions so your business can survive and thrive. 
In a matter of seconds, the level and detail available within MYOB’s reporting can 
confirm or surprise you with all manner of business performance insights.
In this chapter, I explain how to set up your reports, embed reporting into your 
business workflows and create smart, customised report packs that are fit for 
purpose.
Reviewing Your Report Settings
Before leaping straight into creating reports, you can save some time by reviewing 
your default Report Settings (go to Settings → Report Settings).
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Checking your default report settings
» Customising reports to suit your 
business
» Making a splash with logos, colours 
and watermarks
» Packaging reports into neat and tidy 
bundles366 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
If you’re like a bull at a gate and want to jump straight into customising your 
reports, think twice before skipping this short review of your settings. Although 
all these options can be adjusted within each report, you don’t want to risk forget￾ting to change an important setting, such as your accounting or GST reporting 
methods.
You have two Report Settings tabs to consider in your review:
» Business Settings: Here, you can pre-set your accounting and GST reporting 
methods to Cash or Accrual. Note that these settings don’t necessarily need 
to match, and indeed, many businesses choose to generate financial reports 
on an Accrual basis, but report for GST on a Cash basis.
I talk more about GST report settings in Chapter 16, and about business 
report settings in Chapter 17.
The final section of the Business Settings tab allows you to show or hide 
exception alerts in your reports. Exception alerts help you find transactions 
that you may need to check, highlighting problems at the top of your reports. 
Chapter 18 covers exception alerts in more detail.
» User Preferences: This tab allows you to adjust how you want your reports 
to display in six ways:
• Year-end adjustments: Toggle here to include or exclude year-end 
adjustments in your reports (if in doubt, click to include these adjustments, 
or ask your accountant or bookkeeper).
• Display negative amounts: Toggle here to see negative numbers either in 
brackets or with a minus sign (whichever you prefer).
• Other preferences: Get your numbers to display as you want by checking 
or unchecking the options in this section (you can set reports to include or 
exclude accounts with zero balances, account numbers, currency symbols 
and cents).
• PDF styling: Style your reports to suit your business. PDF style templates 
give you the opportunity to add headers, footers, logos and more to all 
your reports. See the later section ‘Adding a Personal Touch to Your 
Reports’ to find out more.
• Report pack template: Select your default report pack template here. 
Turn to the later section ‘Stop the Press! Streamlining with Report Packs’ 
to find out more about creating report pack templates.CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 367
Although I’m suggesting you review your default report settings here, you can 
also change any of these options whenever you generate a report.
Generating Reports
To view the list of standard reports in MYOB, go to Reporting → Reports and 
scroll through the full list of reports available under All, or review in groups using 
the tabs along the top (see Figure 15-1).
Click each report name to see its default format. Most reports default to the 
current month for the date range, although if you change dates once, MYOB tends 
to remember the changes for next time.
The following sections explain how to customise these reports to get the informa￾tion your business needs.
Customising reports
Ready to customise your first report? Grab your dancing partner (that’s MYOB, in 
case you’re wondering) and swing into action.
FIGURE 15-1:
The Reports page.368 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
As an example, I’m going to customise the General Ledger report. The default 
format for this report shows all transactions in your MYOB file, sorted by account, 
along with opening and closing balances. To make this report more helpful, I’m 
going to add some columns and move other columns around.
Follow my instructions to see how this particular polka plays out:
1. Go to Reporting → Reports.
The full list of available reports appears.
2. Select the General Ledger report from the Business tab.
The General Ledger report displays with your pre-set report settings 
(refer to the earlier section ‘Reviewing Your Report Settings’).
3. Select the relevant date range.
4. Choose which accounts you want to display by clicking the Accounts 
button and selecting from the list that appears.
For the purpose of this example, select only the Expenses accounts.
To narrow your search, click the Account No checkbox at the top left to 
deselect all accounts and then use the Search field to find the accounts you 
need (in this case, enter the word ‘expenses’ and then click the checkbox next 
to the header account Expenses to select all your Expenses accounts).
5. Click the green Apply button.
Now your General Ledger report only displays Expenses accounts.
6. Check your Accounting Method and Report Options.
Depending on your business, the choice between Cash or Accrual as your 
Accounting Method may significantly affect the results that display. Chapter 16 
talks more about GST settings.
7. Click the Customise button to adjust your report columns.
The Select and Reorder Columns window appears.
Click the cross to the right of any columns you want to remove. For this 
example, remove the Open ($) and Net Activity ($) columns.
Hover over the six dots to the left of each column if you want to reorder the 
columns — simply drag the columns into the order you require.
8. Click the Select Columns to Display drop-down arrow to add columns to 
your report and then reorder the added columns as required.
For this example, search or scroll for Gross Amount ($) and Tax Code and click 
to add these columns to the end of your columns list.CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 369
You can then drag each column into position (using the six dots to the left of 
the column name). For this example, move the Gross Amount ($) column to 
after the Transaction Description column, move the Tax Amount ($) column to 
after the Gross Amount ($) column, and move the Tax Code column to after 
the Tax Amount ($) column.
9. Click the green Apply button.
10. Click Expand All to view the customised report in all its splendour.
The expanded report appears. You only see the added columns in the 
expanded view; in the default summary view (which you can return to by 
clicking Collapse All), the added columns disappear.
11. Looking good? If your report is not quite right, click Customise again and 
reorder the columns as required.
If you followed my example, your report should look similar to Figure 15-2.
12. Optional: Click the Export button to export the customised report via 
Excel or PDF. Or simply click View and Print (save on the extra click).
Excel can be useful if you want to manipulate your report further by adding 
highlights, notes or calculations.
FIGURE 15-2:
You can 
customise almost 
any report to add, 
remove or 
reorder columns.370 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
When you navigate away from a report and then return to the same report later, 
the layout reverts to its default settings. To avoid this irritating situation and 
find out how to save your report handiwork, see the next section, ‘Saving your 
customisations’.
Saving your customisations
To save you having to reselect all your options every time you want to return to a 
particular report layout, MYOB gives you the ability to save your customisations.
To save a customised report:
1. Customise your report (refer to the preceding ‘Customising reports’ 
section to guide you).
Remember to collapse or expand the report as required.
2. Click the green Save As button at the top right.
The Save Custom Report pop-up window appears.
3. Give your custom report a name, so you can easily find it later.
You can also add a description here if you need more information to help you 
differentiate between similar reports.
4. Decide who can access your report.
Most users will only have two options here: Only I Have Access (that is, 
you — the person saving the report) and All Users Have Access.
5. Optional: Make the report available to other MYOB Business files you 
work in.
If you work with more than one MYOB file, ticking Make Report Available in 
Other Businesses allows you to save this customised report within any other 
MYOB online files that your login email has access to. Before you can say 
Alakazam, when you log in to the other entity the customised report will be 
sitting waiting for you (under your custom reports), with no need for you to 
recreate the report.
6. Click the green Save button.
To view your clever work, head to the Reporting menu and select Custom 
Reports. Click the report name to view the report, or click the Actions column 
to Duplicate, Edit Permissions or Delete the report as required.
Organise all reports you use on a regular basis by clicking the star icon to the far 
right of the report name. The report then appears on the Favourite Reports page 
from your Reporting menu.CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 371
Inserting additional layers of data
At first glance, the reports in MYOB Business may seem few in number, especially 
if you’re an AccountRight user and used to seeing a hundred default reports or 
more. However, one of the really neat things about MYOB Business is the way you 
can insert comparative data or additional columns to create exactly the reports 
you need.
To give you an idea of the flexibility and scope available, here are some possible 
ways to customise key reports:
» Experiment with the GST Report, which you find on the Business tab:
Toggle between Cash and Accrual as the Accounting Method or toggle 
between Expand All and Collapse All to view transaction details. Figure 15-3 
shows a GST Report with Cash as the Accounting Method, and one tax code 
expanded in detail.
FIGURE 15-3:
Similar to 
almost all 
reports, the 
GST Report can 
be customised 
to display 
information 
in many 
different ways.372 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
» Customise your General Ledger report to help with your fuel tax rebate:
If you claim a fuel tax rebate as part of your Business Activity Statement (BAS), 
add the number of litres of fuel as a quantity when processing transactions. 
You can then customise your General Ledger report by adding the Quantity 
column and only selecting the Motor Vehicle Fuel account. Export this 
customised report to Excel to calculate the total rebate due.
» Customise your General Ledger report to check your payroll clearing 
account is at zero: It’s good practice to check that your Payroll Clearing 
account returns to a $0.00 balance at the end of each pay run. I create a 
customised version of my General Ledger report that shows my Payroll 
Clearing account only, and I click Expand All so I can monitor the running 
balance.
» Customise your Profit and Loss report to provide a monthly comparison 
against last year: Track business profitability using a customised Profit and 
Loss report that sets the Breakdown as Monthly and the Compare To section 
as Last Year. You can assess if your business is trading better than the same 
time last year, and monitor these differences by displaying dollar and 
percentage variances.
» Customise your Profit and Loss report to provide a monthly comparison 
to your budget: If you’ve entered a budget into your file (Chapter 17 covers 
creating budgets), you can customise your Profit and Loss to compare actual 
results against budgets. Select the Breakdown as Monthly and this time click 
Budget in the Compare To section. Again, two variance columns appear, which 
you can retain or remove as required. (See Figure 15-4 for an example of this 
customisation with a budget and the variance showing in percentage 
amounts.)
Exporting reports
Depending on which report you’re viewing, you may sometimes feel as if much of 
the page’s real estate is taken up by the report’s filters and options. If so, consider 
exporting your reports to either PDF or Excel. This way you can zoom in or out for 
easy viewing, or change between portrait and landscape view.
An additional advantage of exporting to Excel is you can further manipulate the 
data if you need to. For example, you can add further calculations and sums into 
an Excel spreadsheet, highlight key figures or make notes. (You need to have 
Microsoft Excel 2010 or later installed on your computer for the Excel export 
to work.)CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 373
Adding a Personal Touch to Your Reports
So far in this chapter I’ve focused on how to get exactly the information you want 
on a report by inserting, moving or deleting columns, applying report filters, or 
customising your data in different ways.
The next step allows you to add some glitter and shimmer to your reports to make 
them stand out. Think of this stage as ‘branding’ your reports for your audience 
(which may appeal to your marketing team in particular).
MYOB provides you with several different ways to get creative and add personality 
to your reports, which I cover in the next couple of sections.
Understanding style templates
When you first start generating reports in MYOB, one somewhat confounding 
element is choosing whether to Export to PDF or View and Print. This is very much 
a personal preference, but a win on both sides — the export to PDF gives you the 
option to change your default PDF styling (as you’ll discover) and the View and 
Print is just one click for it to display in PDF. Both display in a new browser tab so 
you can easily print the report from there.
FIGURE 15-4:
A customised 
Profit and Loss 
report for a single 
month comparing 
actual results 
against budgets.374 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
The advantage when you export a report as a PDF, is you can choose a style tem￾plate which controls how the report will display or print, giving you control over 
things such as page orientation, headers, footers, logos and so on. To access these 
features, you first need to create what MYOB calls a PDF style template (a template 
that controls the formatting for any chosen report).
The process for creating and applying PDF style templates is a tad convoluted, but 
worth the effort, so here’s how the concept works:
1. Go to Reporting → PDF Style Templates.
2. Click Create New Style.
MYOB displays a Profit and Loss report on the right and a menu of report 
settings on the left. Don’t worry if the report you want to style isn’t a Profit and 
Loss report — you’ll be able to apply the style you create here to any report.
3. Experiment with the settings until you get this report looking just right.
I explain how these various settings work in the next section.
4. Click Save As in the top right to save this style template.
5. Give the template a name that makes sense to you.
You can also add a description here if you think this will help you identify the 
template later.
6. Decide whether only you will have access to this template, or whether all 
users in your company file will have access.
Usually, it makes sense for all users to have access. Making templates available 
to everyone means that different staff members don’t each create their own 
versions of your business’s branding, but rather use the same approved 
templates.
7. Click Make Template Available to Other Businesses if you want to use 
this template in other company files.
8. Click Apply.
This template now appears in your list of style templates.CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 375
9. Return to your Reporting menu and select a report you use regularly.
10. Click PDF from the Export menu, select the style template you just 
created, and click Export.
Your report appears in all its glory, with the settings from your new style 
template applied. Note: If you choose View and Print it will display with the 
default styling you have set within the Report settings.
Bringing out the artist within
You can style your reports in the following ways:
» Page layout: You can choose whether this report displays as Portrait or 
Landscape, or as Regular or Compact. Alternatively, if you select Auto then 
MYOB decides how best to display the data, which is usually the best option.
» Header: Add a logo to your report and a header to each page (or your first 
page only). The header will display your business name, address and phone 
number.
» Footer: Use the footer to add disclaimers to your reports (or, if you’d rather 
add footer text that isn’t a disclaimer, simply type whatever you’d like to see as 
your footer into the Disclaimer field).
» Watermark: Add a watermark of your choice (for example, Draft or 
Confidential) and adjust the colour, transparency and position of the 
watermark.
» Style options: Brighten up your report with a splash of colour. (If you don’t 
like your choices, click Reset to Default to return to MYOB’s regular palette.)
You can create as many different PDF style templates as you like. For example, if 
you’re the business owner and you regularly report to investors, you can create a 
template for this audience only. Similarly, if you’re an accountant or bookkeeper, 
you can create style templates that you use for all your clients. Figure 15-5 shows 
a PDF style template in action.376 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Stop the Press! Streamlining 
with Report Packs
Are your reports looking as perfect as that first sweet strawberry of the season? If 
so, you’re ready to send these reports into the big, wide world.
Imagine how sweet it would be if you could send just one PDF attachment con￾taining all the different reports you need (as opposed to saving and attaching 
them all separately)? Well, I’m happy to tell you that MYOB has made this idea a 
reality with report packs.
FIGURE 15-5:
A sample PDF 
style template.CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 377
The ability to create report packs has been a real magic wand moment for me 
when it comes to reporting. Report packs have changed how I save, store, share 
and deliver documents not only within my own business, but when working with 
my clients and their accounting advisers.
Creating a report pack template
To begin generating a report pack containing a particular set of reports, you first 
need to create a report pack template that includes these reports. For example, a 
BAS report pack may include all your GST and payroll reports, while a monthly 
management port pack may include your Profit and Loss report, Balance Sheet, 
Unpaid Invoices and Unpaid Bills reports and a Statement of Cashflow report.
To create a report pack template:
1. Go to Reporting → Report Packs.
2. Click the green Create New button and select Template.
The Report Pack Template page opens.
3. Optional: Select a PDF style to apply to this template.
For more about PDF styles, refer to ‘Understanding style templates’ earlier in 
this chapter.
4. In the Pages section, add all the reports you want to include in this report 
pack.
A cover page and a table of contents are already in place to ensure your report 
pack looks professional.
Any reports you’ve already saved as Custom Reports can be found towards the 
bottom of the drop-down list.
5. Optional: Reorder the report pack contents.
If you want to reorder the reports in your report pack, click the six dots to the 
left of the report you want to move and hold as you drag the report into the 
required position.
6. Check your Report Preferences.
These preferences will be set as per your Report Settings preferences but you 
can change them as required here.378 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
7. Optional: Tick the Add a Full Page Disclaimer checkbox and add your 
disclaimer text.
This feature is generally used in more official settings where a disclaimer 
around particulars within your financial reporting may be required. For 
example, you (or your accountant) may like to tick this option if you’re supply￾ing draft financial statements to a potential investor or loan provider.
You can either type the disclaimer text required or upload a pre-prepared 
disclaimer document.
8. Click the green Save As button.
The Save As New Report Pack Template pop-up window appears, where you 
can name your template, add a description and confirm who can access and 
use the template. If you work across multiple MYOB files, you can also make 
this template available for use in your other MYOB files.
Figure 15-6 shows an example of the BAS report template I use.
FIGURE 15-6:
An example of a 
report pack 
template you 
can send with 
your BAS.CHAPTER 15 Reporting for Business 379
Generating a report pack
Gold star to you — your first report pack template is ready to go! Now you’re ready 
to generate your first report pack.
To generate a report pack:
1. Go to Reporting → Report Packs.
2. Click the green Create New button and select Report Pack.
The Create a New Report Pack pop-up window appears.
3. Select the required Period or Date Range, and your report pack template 
from the Select a Report Pack Template drop-down field.
4. Click the green Apply button.
Yay! How good does it look?
5. Optional: Add some extra sparkle to your report pack.
Before you save your report, you can add some finishing touches:
• Template options: If you didn’t select a default PDF style template when 
you set up the report pack template, you can add one now and also adjust 
the page orientation.
• Cover page: Change the Title, Subtitles and the Date Description, and 
insert your logo.
• Table of contents: Remove the cover page here if you prefer and toggle 
between dotted lines or no lines for your page number listing.
• Pages: Want to switch out a report? You can remove and add reports on 
the fly, giving you the flexibility to make one template work for similar 
report packs without creating a report pack template for each one.
• File upload: Need to add an extra document to the pack? You can add any 
PDF document you like into the mix here. For example, you may choose to 
lodge your BAS and then generate a report pack for your records that 
includes a copy of the lodged BAS.
• Comments: You can add comments as endnotes in your report pack (with 
or without highlights). Simply click the area of interest within a report and a 
comment box will pop up for you to add a comment.
After you save your first comment, a Comments (as endnotes) page is 
added at the back of your report pack. As further comments are added to 
the report pack, the comments will become numbered.380 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
If you want to reorder the pages before you save your report pack, click 
the page thumbnail in the page grid to the right and drag the page into 
the required position. A little patience can be helpful here while MYOB 
regenerates the report pack and updates the table of contents for you.
6. Optional: Change the Status to Approved or Published.
When you change the Status of a Report Pack to Published, MYOB saves 
the final PDF as read-only, meaning that you cannot make any further edits. 
I find publishing reports in this way really useful when finalising end-of-year 
reports.
7. Click the print arrow icon to display the report pack in a new browser 
tab or click the download icon to save the report pack as a PDF in your 
Downloads folder.
Missing in action? You’ll find these little icons in the bottom-right corner of 
your report.
8. Select Report Pack from the Save As menu, and add a Name.
You can also add a Description if you like, and choose whether this report pack 
will be viewable for all users or just yourself. Once saved, you can find this set 
of reports under the Report Packs menu.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 381
Chapter 16
The Gist of GST
The good old GST (or Goods and Services Tax): If it moves, tax it. If it makes 
a noise, tax it. If it’s cash, tax it extra, just because. (Unless it’s a life 
essential, of course.)
The confusion that this tax generates is probably one of the main reasons I’m still 
in business. Still, I question the wisdom of such a complex labyrinth of rules that 
require me to consider why coffee beans are GST-free but takeaway coffee is 
taxable, or why medical supplies are GST-free but medical reports aren’t.
But I’m not here to explore the mysteries of GST.  Instead, I’m here to make 
calculating this tax and lodging your Business Activity Statement (BAS) as 
painless as possible.

Understanding Where Everything Fits
Every transaction you record in your MYOB file falls into one of four categories: 
A taxable supply, a GST-free supply, an input-taxed supply or a non-reportable 
transaction.
» Taxable supplies are any goods or services that attract GST. Examples include 
computers, consultancy fees, stationery and freight.
» GST-free supplies are goods or services that are GST-free. Examples include 
fresh food, many medical services and products, many educational courses, 
childcare, exports and a range of religious supplies.
» Input-taxed supplies are supplies that don’t have GST added to the final selling 
price. Examples include bank charges and residential rents. If your business 
sells an input-taxed supply (maybe you’re a landlord of residential property), 
you can’t claim input tax credits for the GST you pay on your supplies.
» Non-reportable transactions don’t attract GST and aren’t reported on your 
BAS. Examples include transfers between bank accounts, loan repayments, 
personal drawings, dividend income and superannuation payments. (For 
more on this tax code, refer to the nearby sidebar ‘Understanding the 
difference between GST-free and Non-Reportable’.)
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN GST-FREE AND NON-REPORTABLE
You’ve probably noticed an extra code you can’t delete or change that sits in your 
Tax Code list. This code is called N-T and stands for Non-Reportable. (Yes, I know that 
logically the code should be called N-R, but it isn’t! Think of it as ‘No Tax’ if that helps.)
The distinction between the FRE tax code and the N-T tax code is that, for some 
businesses, transactions coded FRE are reported on Business Activity Statements, 
whereas transactions coded N-T are not. Use N-T as the tax code for any transactions 
you allocate to an asset, liability or equity account — such as tax payments, loans, 
private drawings or GST accounts.
Also, use N-T as the tax code for all wages and superannuation payments. (Although 
you do report wages on your Business Activity Statement, they appear separately.)CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 383
Reviewing Your Tax Codes
If your business has an annual turnover of less than $10 million, you can use the 
Simpler BAS method when completing your BAS. For the purpose of this chapter, 
unless I specify otherwise, I assume that you’re using this method.
With the Simpler BAS method, most businesses only need to report Total Sales, 
GST on Sales and GST on Purchases, as well as payroll if applicable. A handful of 
industries may also report other figures (car dealers need to report Luxury Car Tax 
collected; winemakers report Wine Equalisation Tax; primary producers and 
manufacturers may claim fuel tax credits).
MYOB provides a default suite of tax codes that accommodate businesses of all 
sizes, including those with turnover of more than $10 million that need to submit 
a full BAS report. To streamline your business and keep your reporting simple and 
error-free, I recommend you give your Tax Codes list a good once-over, checking 
that your tax codes are set up as needed for your business.
CHANGING OF THE GUARD
Within MYOB Business, the traditional GST Collected and GST Paid account codes 
(which are still in use in AccountRight) have been replaced by just the one account: GST 
Balance. This account is the default in new MYOB Business files; however, if you can’t 
get used to the idea of just one GST account, you do have the option to split it back 
out to the two original accounts if you prefer. Should you wish to return to this earlier 
account structure, you will need to create two liability account codes (Chapter 2 takes 
you through setting up your Chart of Accounts), then find the Tax Codes list (under the 
Accounting menu). Click through to this list and select the GST tax code. Here, you 
can change your linked accounts for both Tax Collected and Tax Paid to the two new 
accounts you have created. Repeat this process for any other tax codes where GST is 
charged.
All this being said, I don’t recommend you changing these linked accounts for the sake 
of change. You should only revert to this earlier account structure if you need to main￾tain consistency with other MYOB files that have been set up in the past in this way.384 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Keeping it lean
When you first start your MYOB file, you find that your Tax Codes list comes with 
codes for all types of businesses and includes everything from WET (Wine Equali￾sation Tax) to LCT (Luxury Car Tax). Here’s how to configure the tax codes you 
need, and get rid of the ones you don’t:
1. Go to Accounting → Tax Codes.
The Tax Codes list page appears with a neat overview of linked accounts and 
rates for each code.
2. Click GST in the Tax Code column.
The GST — Goods & Services Tax page appears, showing the tax code details 
for the GST tax code. Review these details and ensure that the Rate (%) for 
GST is set at 10 per cent and that both linked accounts are set to the GST 
Balance liability account (as shown in Figure 16-1).
Check the nearby sidebar ‘Changing of the guard’ if you prefer to use separate 
GST Collected and GST Paid accounts.
3. Click the green Save button.
You are returned to the Tax Codes list.
4. Click FRE in the Tax Code column.
The FRE — GST Free page appears, showing the tax code details for the FRE tax 
code. Again, review these details and ensure that the Rate (%) is set at 0 per 
cent and both linked accounts are set to the GST Balance liability account.
5. Click the green Save button.
Again, you are returned to the Tax Codes list.

code info.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 385
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the N-T tax code (Not-Reportable), ensuring that 
the Rate (%) is also set to 0 per cent.
7. Consider whether your business needs any additional Tax Codes.
After you have checked the setup for these three essential Tax Codes, consider 
whether your business needs any additional codes as per below:
• To create a tax code for monitoring queries, skip to ‘Creating a query code 
when you don’t have a clue’.
• If you report income earned from residential rents on your BAS, skip to 
‘Dealing with input-taxed sales or purchases’.
• If your turnover is more than $10 million, you’ll need the CAP code for 
reporting capital acquisitions. This code should have a rate of 10 per cent 
and be linked to the GST Balance account.
• If your turnover is more than $10 million (so you’re not using Simpler BAS 
reporting) and you’re an exporter, you’ll need the EXP code for reporting 
overseas sales. Skip to ‘Exporting goods to foreign lands’ for more details.
Regardless of your turnover, if you’re a car dealer, you’ll need the LCT tax code; 
if you’re a winemaker, you’ll need the WET code. See MYOB help for more 
about these specific situations.
8. Optional: Delete any Tax Codes you don’t need.
If you find you don’t require some tax codes for your business, such as codes 
for Wine Equalisation Tax (WET), Luxury Car Tax (LCT), GST Non-Registered 
(GNR) or Input Taxed Sales (ITS), simply click the tax code in the Tax Code 
column of the Tax Codes list and click Delete at the bottom left. You can always 
recreate the tax code in future if your business diversifies.
Dealing with input-taxed sales or purchases
Do you report residential rental income on your Business Activity Statement, earn 
income from financial services, or conduct fundraising activities? If so, you may 
like to use special tax codes to report income and expenses related to these activi￾ties. In MYOB, these codes are typically called ITS (Input-Taxed Sale) and INP 
(Input-Taxed Purchase).
You don’t need to use either of these tax codes if your turnover is less than 
$10 million and you use the Simpler BAS Method. However, these codes may be 
helpful to your accountant at tax time: The INP code helps identify any expenses 
related to input-taxed sales, safeguarding against the (easily made) error of 
wrongly claiming GST credits on such expenses.386 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
If you’d like to use these tax codes and they don’t already exist in your Tax Codes 
list, set them up in the same way as the FRE tax code (refer to the preceding sec￾tion for details). The Tax Type should be Goods & Services Tax, the Rate (%) 
should be 0, and both linked accounts should be GST Balance.
Exporting goods to foreign lands
If your turnover is over $10 million and you export goods overseas, you will need 
to use the EXP (GST-Free Exports) tax code for all export sales.
If this code doesn’t already exist in your Tax Codes list, go to Accounting → Tax 
Codes and create a new tax code called EXP. This code is set up exactly the same 
way as your FRE tax code, with a 0 per cent rate. As the Description, enter GST￾Free Exports. Select Goods & Services Tax as the Tax Type and select GST Balance 
for both linked accounts.
Creating a query code when 
you don’t have a clue
Sometimes you may not be sure whether an expense has GST on it or not. Although 
it’s pretty tempting just to pick any old code and ignore the problem, you’re better 
off using a special query tax code called QUE instead.
Using this code means you can still record the transaction and continue working 
on your accounts. Later on, you can generate a report listing all transactions allo￾cated to the QUE code and investigate these transactions further (or ask your 
accountant or bookkeeper for guidance). Over time, your use of the QUE code will 
diminish as you become more familiar with the world of GST in your business.
Here’s how to create this code:
1. Go to Accounting → Tax Codes.
2. Click the Create Tax Code button.
The Create Tax Code page appears.
3. Enter QUE as the tax code and Query to Review in the Description area.
4. Select Goods & Services Tax as the tax type and enter 0 per cent as the 
Rate (%).
I suggest you enter 0 as the Rate, because under-claiming GST is better than 
over-claiming. You can always make an adjustment if this query ends up 
having GST on it rather than paying it back down the track.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 387
5. Select GST Balance as the linked account for Tax Collected and Tax Paid.
6. Click Save.
Getting rid of excess fat
Figure 16-2 shows an example of a lean, clean list of Tax Codes, with the three 
core tax codes required for reporting using the Simpler BAS Method, plus the 
Query Tax Code for the transactions you need to review further (refer to the pre￾ceding section).
Picking the Right Tax Code
The secret to producing an accurate BAS is to get the tax codes right on every 
transaction. Fortunately, this is pretty easy when you know how, as I explain in 
the next few sections.
Guaranteeing perfection, every time
Every account in your Chart of Accounts is linked to a tax code. To see what I 
mean, go to your Chart of Accounts and click the Expenses tab. Can you see how 
each account is linked to a different tax code, similar to Figure 16-3? (If every tax 
code on your Chart of Accounts shows as N-T, this means that nobody has done 
the noble job of updating the tax codes to the correct linked account yet; either 
that, or you’ve selected Not Registered for GST in the initial setup).
Because every account is linked to a tax code, the correct tax code comes up auto￾matically every time you select an account on a transaction. For example, if the 
Tax Code for your Advertising Expense account is GST, every time you allocate a 
transaction to Advertising Expense, GST pops up automatically as the tax code.
The implications for accounting good practice are huge: If you set up the tax code 
for every account in your Chart of Accounts correctly, right from the start, you’re 
almost guaranteed to code all your transactions perfectly, every time.
FIGURE 16-2:
A typical list of 
tax codes for 
reporting BAS 
using the Simpler 
BAS Method.388 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Setting up Tax Codes in your 
Chart of Accounts
As I explain in the preceding section, the secret to coding transactions correctly is 
to set up the linked Tax Codes in your Chart of Accounts correctly.
To change the tax code for an account, go to your Chart of Accounts, click the 
account name and simply change the tax code in the Tax Code field.
You can also edit tax codes in bulk to save time: Go to your Chart of Accounts, 
highlight the accounts where tax codes need changing, and click Edit Tax Code.
Assuming your turnover is under $10 million and you use the Simpler BAS report￾ing method, here’s an indication of which tax codes to use when. (You may wish 
to double-check these settings with your accountant before you begin, or seek 
advice regarding additional tax codes if your turnover exceeds $10 million.)
» Accounts with GST as the tax code: Use GST as the tax code for most 
expense accounts, including things such as advertising, commercial rent, 
electricity, merchant fees, postage, telephone and travel within Australia.
You also use GST as the tax code for all fixed asset accounts, such as furniture 
and fittings, motor vehicles and tools. You may find the default code is CAP for 
these fixed asset accounts; if so, do change the tax code to GST.
FIGURE 16-3:
Every account has 
a corresponding 
tax code listed in 
the Tax Code 
column.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 389
» Accounts with FRE as the Tax code: Use FRE as the tax code for accounts 
relating to bank charges (with the exception of merchant fees), donations, 
government charges, interest expense, international travel, medical supplies, 
rates and Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) fees.
» Accounts with N-T as the Tax code: Use N-T as the tax code for all asset and 
liability accounts (with the exception of fixed asset accounts), private drawings 
accounts, depreciation expense, superannuation and wages.
» Accounts with QUE as the Tax code — the query code: Initially at least, use 
QUE as the tax code for all hire purchase expense accounts and lease 
payments. Then, ensure you double-check the correct GST treatment with 
your accountant or supplier.
Keeping everything squeaky-clean
Can you tell I like things in order, all nice and tidy? I mention earlier in this chap￾ter that the secret to producing accurate BAS reporting is to select the right tax 
codes for all transactions. I’m going to take this a step further now and talk about 
the most common coding mistakes.
And guess what? Because they’re so common, these are the mistakes the ATO will 
be watching out for in any audit:
» Bank fees and merchant fees: Bank fees are almost always GST-free, but 
merchant fees (such as for credit cards and hire of EFTPOS machines) 
attract GST.
» Entertainment: Watch out for expenses relating to drinks or dinners with 
clients, even though the receipts will have GST listed. These types of expenses 
may be non-deductible for income tax purposes (those claims for 1980s-style 
Friday long lunches are long gone), and GST may not be claimable. To avoid 
errors, check entertainment expenses with your accountant using the Query 
to Review (QUE) tax code.
» Government charges: Council rates, filing fees, land tax and parts of licence 
renewals are all GST-free. So don’t be tempted to claim back 10 per cent!
» Insurance: Insurance is tricky because almost every insurance policy has a 
mixture of taxable and GST-free items (for example, stamp duty doesn’t have 
GST on it). Don’t get caught out. Instead, double-check the exact amount of 
GST on your insurance tax invoices.
» Travel: Overseas travel and all expenses while overseas are GST-free. 
However, be careful with online bookings as even if you are booking to travel 
within Australia, you may be booking the trip through a company that is based 390 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
overseas. In such cases, the booking may be GST-free, so check any domestic 
travel tax invoices carefully to ensure they show the GST amount (if 
applicable).
» Personal stuff: You can’t claim the full amount of GST on expenses that are 
partly personal — motor vehicle, telephone and home office expenses are all 
obvious culprits.
» Petty cash: Another trap for the unwary, petty cash is usually a mixed bag. 
Coffee and tea are GST-free; biscuits and cake are not.
» Small suppliers: Watch out for small suppliers who have an ABN but aren’t 
registered for GST. Record these purchases as GST-free.
Table 16-1 also provides a quick reference guide to selecting the right tax code.
Handling transactions when 
GST isn’t 10 per cent
Okay, let me get one thing straight. GST is (at least at the time of writing), and 
always has been, set at 10 per cent. However, sometimes you come across a trans￾action that seems like the GST isn’t 10 per cent. Then, when you look closer, you 
find that the transaction is actually a combination of taxable items (which, of 
course, are 10 per cent) and non-taxable items (which are 0 per cent).
TABLE 16-1	 What Tax Code to Pick When (Simpler BAS Method Only)
Situation Examples Tax Code
Sales where you charge GST Regular sales of most items GST
Sales that are GST-free Sales of childcare, medical supplies or unprocessed 
foods
FRE
Non-reportable transactions Transfers between bank accounts, loan repayments, 
personal drawings, superannuation
N-T
Purchases of GST-free items Purchases of unprocessed foods, bank charges, some 
medical items, or purchases from a supplier who isn’t 
registered for GST
FRE
Purchase of taxable items Most purchases and business expenses GST
Purchases from suppliers who 
have an ABN but are not registered 
for GST
Subcontractors often sit here, with many starting out not 
being registered for GST
FRECHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 391
Here’s a common example. You get an insurance bill for $550 and you enter the 
payment. MYOB calculates the GST to be $50 but when you look at the bill, you 
notice that GST is actually $49.09. That’s because the bill includes $10 stamp duty 
amount and stamp duty is GST-free.
Tempting as it is to assume this small difference is of little consequence, these 
small differences do add up.
The solution to this kind of situation is to create two lines for the transaction: One 
line showing the value of taxable supplies (with GST as the tax code), and the 
second line showing the non-taxable supplies (with FRE as the tax code). With the 
insurance example (assuming you’ve ticked the Tax Inclusive button), that means 
you allocate $540 to Insurance Expense with GST as the tax code, and then 
allocate $10 to Insurance Expense but with FRE as the tax code. Figure 16-4 shows 
how it all works.
If you’re allocating a transaction straight from your bank feeds including both 
taxable and non-taxable supplies, simply click the drop-down arrow to the far 
right of the transaction line and go to the Allocate tab. Add the two line items here 
(with GST as the tax code where GST applies, and FRE as the tax code where GST 
is not applicable).
FIGURE 16-4:
Recording a 
payment when 
GST doesn’t equal 
10 per cent.392 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Sometimes, a tax invoice may not make it clear which amounts attract GST and 
which do not. The easy way to calculate the GST-inclusive total is to simply mul￾tiply the GST amount by 11, which will give you the grossed-up total for your first 
line item. So, going back to Figure 16-4, if all I could see on the invoice was a GST 
amount of $49.09, I would multiply 49.09 by 11 to get a total GST-inclusive 
amount of $540. The balance would be the correct amount for the second line item 
(with the tax code of FRE).
Assessing what’s personal
If your business purchases goods or services that you use partly for private pur￾poses, be careful not to overclaim the GST on the private component. For example, 
if you run your motor vehicle as a business expense but your logbook shows that 
20 per cent of use is actually personal, then you should only claim 80 per cent of 
the GST when you record the transaction.
For example, imagine you have motor vehicle repairs on your new Mercedes sports 
car (lucky you!) that cost $1,000, and your personal use of this vehicle is 
20 per cent. To record this transaction, you allocate $800 to Motor Vehicle 
Maintenance on the first line, with GST as the tax code, and then you allocate the 
balance of $200 to Owner’s Drawings or a Director’s Loan account on the second 
line, with N-T as the tax code (not FRE, as this portion is not business-related). 
Yep, simple as that!
Checking You’re Ready to Do the Deed
Before jumping in head-first and producing your BAS report for the ATO, take a 
few moments to check the figures behind the scenes are as perfect as can be.
Chapter 20 pulls together all the jigsaw pieces of the BAS preparation process dot￾ted throughout this book if you’re looking for a reminder of all the essentials.
Auditing your own accounts
Want to give yourself an audit? Sounds kinda scary, but trawling through your 
own accounts to make some essential double-checks can help you sleep better at 
night.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 393
I highly recommend you check your data using the Exceptions Dashboard (called 
the Company Data Auditor if you’re an AccountRight user) to identify possible 
problems. I devote most of Chapter 18 to using this feature, the last stage of which 
includes an in-depth review of all your tax codings. You can also refer to the 
reports I cover in the upcoming section ‘Reviewing your final reports’.
Checking your opening balances
Unless you’re only just setting up your business, chances are that on the day you 
start entering transactions in MYOB, you already owe some GST to the ATO. For 
example, if you start entering transactions from 1 July, you almost certainly owe 
GST for the month of June, if not April, May and June (depending on whether you 
report monthly or quarterly).
Here’s how to calculate your opening balance for GST:
1. Look up how much GST you collected from customers in the period 
before your conversion date.
You find this figure next to box 1A in your June Business Activity Statement. 
(I assume here that you’re starting to use MYOB from 1 July.)
2. Look up how much GST you paid to suppliers in the previous period.
You find this figure next to box 1B in your June Business Activity Statement.
3. Subtract the amount from Step 2 from the amount in Step 1.
For example, if the amount in 1A was $5,000 and the amount in 1B was $3,500, 
the difference is $1,500.
4. Edit the opening balance of GST Balance so that it matches the amount 
from Step 3.
To edit this opening balance, go to your Chart of Accounts, click Edit Accounts 
and scroll down to the liabilities. Edit the Opening Balance column and 
click Save.
5. If you report for GST on a cash basis and you were owed money from 
customers on your conversion date, add the value of GST on these 
outstanding debts to the opening balance of your GST Balance account.
For example, if you are owed $11,000 from customers and GST makes up 
$1,000 of this amount, add $1,000 to your opening balance for GST Balance.
6. If you owed money to suppliers and you report on a cash basis, subtract 
the value of GST on your outstanding accounts to the opening balance of 
your GST Balance account.394 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
That’s it! If you need help with this process, I suggest you ask your accountant or 
bookkeeper. Alternatively, Chapter  18 provides more detail on reconciling GST 
balances.
Reviewing your final reports
Before generating your GST reports and completing your BAS form ready to send 
to the ATO, remember to reconcile your bank accounts up to the last day of the 
period you’re reporting for (turn to Chapter 9 if you need a reconciling refresher).
With your bank accounts reconciled, here are the reports I suggest you generate 
before completing your BAS, along with why they’re important:
» General Ledger report: I like to customise this report to include both Gross 
and Tax amounts so I can review my account allocations and GST amounts in 
the one report. I provide more details about how to customise this report in 
Chapter 20.
» GST report: If you customise your General Ledger report in the way I suggest, 
you may not need to check this report. However, this report is handy for 
reviewing transaction details behind any tax code total. Ensure the Accounting 
Method is set correctly (Cash or Accrual, depending on your GST reporting 
basis) and click Expand All to view detailed transactions.
» Profit and Loss report: Most business owners have a good sense of what 
their Profit and Loss report should be, and checking this report helps to 
highlight bookkeeping errors. I explain more about how to check your Profit 
and Loss in Chapter 17.
» Balance Sheet report: Your Balance Sheet is the litmus test for determining 
whether your payroll and GST liability accounts reconcile. Chapter 12 has 
more detail about reconciling payroll liability accounts; Chapter 18 explains 
how to reconcile GST.
» Payroll Register report: Use this report to double-check W1 (total wages) and 
W2 (total PAYG tax) on your BAS.
Once you have reviewed all of the reports in the preceding list, you can generate 
the GST Return report, which looks a little more like your BAS form (it includes the 
BAS labels G1, 1A, W1 and so on). You can use the figures in your GST Return report 
to complete your BAS.
You may like to make a report pack containing all of the above reports so that you 
can work through them easily at BAS time. For more on report packs, turn to 
Chapter 15.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 395
Completing Your Business 
Activity Statement
Now you’ve reviewed all your reports (refer to the earlier section ‘Reviewing your 
final reports’), you are ready to complete your BAS. The following sections take 
you through creating and adjusting a BAS report.
CASH OR ACCRUAL — WHAT’S THE 
DIFFERENCE?
When a business registers for GST, it has to choose whether to account for GST on an 
accrual basis or a cash basis. What’s the difference between the two?
• Accrual-basis reporting: Accrual-basis reporting means you report and pay for 
GST in the same period that you invoice customers or receive bills from suppliers, 
regardless of whether any money has exchanged hands. For example, if you invoice 
a customer in March and they don’t pay until July, you have to pay the GST in your 
BAS for March regardless. Similarly, if you receive a bill from a supplier in March but 
don’t pay this bill till much later, you can still claim the GST back in your BAS for 
March.
• Cash-basis reporting: Cash-basis reporting means you don’t need to pay GST on a 
customer invoice until the customer pays you; conversely, you can only claim back 
GST on a supplier bill once the bill has been paid.
Consider the timing of money coming in and out of the business — for example a café, 
where all customers pay upfront but the business buys goods on account. This means 
the business claims the GST back before it pays suppliers for the goods, so accrual-basis 
reporting for GST works best for cashflow in this scenario. Alternatively, if you have both 
customers and suppliers on trading accounts, then cash-basis reporting for GST works 
best as you only pay GST when you have actually received the money or paid it out. 
(Note that cash-basis reporting for GST is only possible for businesses with an annual 
turnover of less than $10 million.)
Regardless of how you choose to report for GST, generating your Profit and Loss and 
other key financial reports using Accrual as the Accounting Method usually makes more 
sense from a business management perspective. (For almost all businesses, it makes 
most sense to see sales reflected in financial reports as soon as they’re made, and to 
see expenses reflected as soon as they are incurred.)396 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Creating your BAS report
Ready to create your first BAS report? Here goes:
1. Go to Reporting → BAS.
The Prior BAS Report page appears, displaying any prior BAS reports you have 
generated, including the Date Finalised for each report. If this is the first time 
you’re creating a BAS report, this page will be blank.
2. Click Create New.
The Step 1 — Setup page appears.
3. Select your BAS period.
If you’re creating your first ever BAS report, I strongly suggest you select the 
first month or quarter of the current financial year as your BAS period.
After you complete your first BAS report, you can’t go back and select an earlier 
period, nor can you delete this report and start again. For example, if you 
select October to December 2024 as the period for your first BAS report, you 
can’t return later and try to generate a report for July to September 2024.
4. Check your Accounting Method (Cash or Accrual) is correct.
Your Accounting Method is pre-set based on your Report Settings (if you want 
to double-check, your Accounting Method can be found on your actual BAS 
form from the ATO).
5. Click Next, and check the GST figures that appear.
The Step 2 — GST Report page appears.
Have a quick skim through these figures and check they make sense. 
(Hopefully, you’ve already reviewed your GST transaction reports as part of 
preparing to lodge your BAS. If not, refer to the earlier section ‘Reviewing your 
final reports’, as well as Chapter 20, for more on preparing to lodge your BAS.)
6. Click Next, and review any GST adjustments.
The Step 3 — Prior Period Adjustments page appears, listing any transactions 
from prior periods that have been added, edited or deleted since you finalised 
the BAS report relating to that period.
If an adjustment relates to a transaction where you’ve edited a tax code — 
perhaps you spotted a mistake and fixed it — then this edit is almost certainly 
okay, and fine to include as an adjustment. However, if the adjustment relates 
to a new transaction that has a date belonging to the prior period, I recom￾mend you take a moment to check this transaction is dated correctly. (If the 
date is correct, that’s fine; if not, identify the transaction, edit the date, and 
then return to the BAS report and generate the report from scratch again.)
Figure 16-5 shows an example of some of the transactions you may see listed.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 397
7. Click Yes to include all adjustments (or No to remove them).
Unfortunately, if you have more than one adjustment, MYOB doesn’t allow you 
to pick and choose which adjustment you include — you either include all 
adjustments, or none. However, don’t stress too much. If you’ve checked that 
the adjustments are legitimate, the right thing to do is to include them in your 
current BAS. (If you like, you can even click Export to send a record of these 
adjustments to Excel, and add notes to the Excel file to explain why the 
changes occurred.)
The only time I suggest you don’t click Yes is for adjustments over $5,000, or for 
adjustments that relate to GST credits from over four years ago. In such 
situations, seek advice from your accountant first.
8. Click Next.
The Step 4 — Finalise page appears.
FIGURE 16-5:
The Prior Period 
Adjustments 
page picks up 
prior period 
adjustments for 
your attention.398 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
The first tab (GST Return Summary) displays the figures you need to include on 
your BAS form for lodgement. These figures are the combination of your 
original GST report from Step 2 with all the adjustments from Step 3 added (as 
a reminder, you can view the information from each of these steps via the GST 
Report and Prior Period Adjustments tabs). If you like, you can click Export to 
save a copy of the information from each of these three tabs for your records.
At the time of writing, if you prepare and lodge your BAS within your MYOB file 
(turn to the later section ‘Lodging Your BAS Direct from MYOB’ for more on 
this), you need to manually adjust the prefilled figures to allow for these 
adjustments before you lodge your BAS. Hopefully MYOB will be updated soon 
so that it makes these adjustments for you when you lodge your BAS (after you 
click Finalise BAS to capture these adjustments).
9. If it all looks good, click Finalise BAS.
By clicking Finalise BAS you are agreeing that these adjustments and your 
current GST reports are true. At the same time, you are stamping the Date 
Finalised in your BAS reporting, and it is from this date that any future changes 
for this period will begin to be tracked.
This is now the ideal time to go and lock your data (under your Business 
Settings) to the last day of the reporting period you have just completed 
(for example, if you have completed your BAS report for the quarter ending 
30 June, the lock date will also be 30 June).
Amending a BAS report
If at any time you navigate away from the process of creating a BAS report, MYOB 
will remember your progress and invite you to click Edit Existing (so you can 
return to the report that you were partway through) or to click Create New (so you 
can start your BAS report from scratch). If, however, you click Cancel through any 
of the steps, you will need to start again.
You can always come back to the BAS page (Reporting → BAS) to view or print the 
detail from any completed BAS reports. Simply click on the period you want to 
review and MYOB will take you to the three summary reports generated in Step 4 
(Finalise) of creating your BAS report.
You can’t amend a BAS report after it has been finalised, so allow plenty of time 
and check your reports extra carefully when preparing your first few reports.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 399
Lodging Your BAS Direct from MYOB
Did you know you can lodge your BAS directly from your MYOB file? I love working 
in this way, because with a few clicks of the mouse, I have not only lodged my BAS, 
but I can also be confident that the figures I’ve lodged with the ATO match those 
in my MYOB file.
Of course, lodging your BAS in this way isn’t compulsory. If you prefer, you can 
still log into the ATO portal or myGov and enter BAS figures manually, or you can 
ask your accountant or bookkeeper to lodge your BAS on your behalf. Your accoun￾tant or bookkeeper can also be of great value to help check your BAS field setup in 
MYOB if you do plan to lodge your BAS yourself using MYOB.
In this next section, I explain how to prepare for electronic lodgement (notifying 
the ATO of your ‘software ID’), how to configure your activity statement fields, 
and how to finally lodge your activity statement.
Notifying the ATO of your software ID
In order to lodge your BAS direct from MYOB, you must first notify the ATO of 
your unique software ID (your software ID is a code that enables the ATO to match 
the data you send from MYOB to your tax account). This can be a bit of a painful 
process, but in good news, you only have to do it once.
Here’s what to do:
1. Go to Business Settings and check your ABN is correct.
Select Business Settings and under the Business Details check your ABN is 
correct.
2. Go to Accounting → Prepare BAS or IAS.
You should see File with MYOB, and Create BAS Report. (If you see the Online 
Activity Statement Dashboard, that means someone has already connected 
your file to the ATO and you can happily skip this section!)
3. Click the Get Started button under File with MYOB.
This opens a new MYOB browser tab.
4. Click Allow Access to allow access to your MYOB Account.
Here, you allow your MYOB file to connect with the MYOB tax gateway to bring 
in all the prefillable data for your BAS directly from the ATO.400 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Allowing your MYOB file to connect to the MYOB tax gateway is a one-time 
event. If you log into many different MYOB files using the same email, allowing 
access in one business file means MYOB will not ask for access again as the 
permission to connect in this way is linked to your email login.
5. Click Get Started again.
A pop-up window appears, asking whether you are lodging your BAS as an 
agent or a business. (Although MYOB offers this option, most agents don’t 
choose to lodge activity statements directly from their clients’ files.)
6. Select that you’re preparing this BAS for your own business and enter 
your name.
7. Click Next.
8. Write down your unique Software ID.
At this point, I suggest you grab an old-fashioned pen and paper and actually 
write the number down!
9. Click Next.
10. If you have a myGov account, follow the instructions that MYOB displays 
onscreen; if you don’t have a myGov account, skip to Step 9.
MYOB displays instructions for navigating the ATO Access Manager portal, 
where you go through a process of ‘notifying the ATO of your hosted service’.
11. If you don’t have a myGov account, call the ATO on the phone number 
MYOB suggests and follow the prompts.
Again, the aim of the game is to notify the ATO of your Software ID so that you 
can lodge activity statements direct from MYOB. The ATO will want to identify 
the caller, so ensure you have your ABN ready and some of your personal 
details (such as your TFN is you are the business owner).
12. Click I’ve Done This after you have notified the ATO.
13. Continue, when prompted, to configure your activity statement.
Guess what? That’s what the next section is all about.
Configuring activity statement fields
In this section, I assume your turnover is less than $10  million and you have 
elected to lodge a Simpler BAS. (If your turnover exceeds $10  million, do seek 
advice from your accountant when configuring these fields, but more than likely 
you are not lodging your own BAS at this level.)CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 401
Once you’ve notified the ATO of your software ID, you’ll arrive at the Online Activ￾ity Statement Dashboard, where you configure key fields in your activity state￾ment so that they populate automatically:
» Add every tax code to G1: Click Add Code to add every single tax code that 
you might use on a sale to the G1 activity statement field. For most busi￾nesses, this will be just GST and FRE; however, if you use other tax codes such 
as ITS or EXP, add these also.
» Add every wages pay item to W1: Click Add Code or Category to add every 
wages pay item that you pay to employees (in other words, this will include all 
the pay items that you use in your payroll). You also want to add in any 
deduction categories (such as Salary Sacrifice and Child Support deductions) 
here so that the correct figure is reported through W1.
» Add all tax items to W2: This is usually just PAYG Withholding.
» Add other amounts withheld to W3: You can probably skip this field, unless 
your accountant informs you otherwise.
» Add the ABN tax code, if you use it, to W4: A rare beastie indeed (if 
applicable), you find the relevant tax code within your GST Report for suppli￾ers not quoting an ABN.
Looking for 1A (GST Collected) and 1B (GST Paid)? These fields are not required as 
MYOB takes care of those for you (the figures are derived from an automatic cal￾culation based on the GST tax code).
Note that you can’t configure every field on a Business Activity Statement to cal￾culate automatically. At the time of writing, fields such as Fringe Benefits Tax 
(FBT), Fuel Tax Credits and PAYG Instalments cannot be linked, and you will need 
to enter the figures manually when you prepare your BAS.
Figure 16-6 shows an example of how the setup may look when using the Simpler 
BAS Method.
Salary sacrifice superannuation amounts (if applicable) in MYOB form part of the 
Total Salary and Wages amount in your payroll reports and the wages pay items 
you add to W1 (but salary sacrifice super amounts are also shown as deductions — 
if you see any deductions, expand the report to confirm the details of the deduc￾tion). Salary sacrifice super amounts should be subtracted and not reported as part 
of section W1 on your BAS form, which is why you should add the deductions to the 
W1 categories (as suggested earlier in this section) so that the deduction amount 
is subtracted from the total reported at W1. If you are lodging BAS through another 
platform (like myGov), you will need to manually account for this deduction (and 
others required) and subtract it from the total when entering the amount at W1.402 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Lodging your BAS at long last
The moment has arrived! You are now super confident your BAS is good to go, so 
you are on the home stretch (good for you!).
If you do want to be extra certain (especially the first time), turn to Chapter 20 for 
a ten-step checklist for preparing your BAS. With final checks complete, here are 
the final steps to lodge your BAS from MYOB:
1. Go to Accounting → Prepare BAS or IAS.
2. Click Get Started under File with MYOB.
3. On the Activity Statement page, click on the Date of the statement you 
want to lodge.
The form appears. (MYOB will have retrieved the required details from the ATO 
to populate the form.)
4. Check the prefilled field values are as you expect, comparing against your 
GST Return and Payroll Activity reports.
If you identify any discrepancies, it may be that your activity statement fields 
have not been configured correctly. (Refer to the preceding section for more 
on configuring these fields.)
FIGURE 16-6:
Configuring 
activity statement 
fields from the 
Online Activity 
Statement 
Dashboard.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 403
If you have prior period adjustments, continue to Step 5; if you don’t have any 
discrepancies, skip to Step 6.
5. Edit any fields that require manual adjustments due to changes made in 
BAS report prior periods.
I talk about this earlier (see ‘Creating your BAS report’) and explain how to 
export a report summarising any required adjustments plus your newly 
adjusted GST return summary, from which to get your new figures from that 
should align with your BAS lodgement here.
6. Review other fields, and enter other figures manually.
Your PAYG Instalment field will be prefilled on your BAS form with figures 
directly from the ATO, so ensure you review this field. You also have the option 
to Vary the PAYG Instalment amount if needed (do check with your accountant 
here before doing so). You may also have to complete other fields, such as 
Fringe Benefits Tax or Fuel Tax Credit info, depending on your BAS 
requirements.
7. Click Validate.
MYOB checks that all mandatory fields have been completed before you lodge 
your BAS.
This validating check does not ensure your figures are correct; instead, 
it ensures that the ATO will accept the form once lodged.
8. Click Prepare to Lodge.
9. Click Lodge, review the declaration and click Lodge again.
A notice from the ATO appears advising you that your form has been lodged. 
You can print this statement for your records and refer back to it later when 
payment is due, as the payment details are also captured here for you.
10. Click Download to save a copy for your records.
I suggest you save a copy of your lodged BAS into a BAS report pack (I explain 
report packs in Chapter 15) so you keep all your BAS information together 
in a tidy bundle that you can always find and access. If you have prior period 
adjustments (from your BAS report), remember to include all related reports in 
your report pack as well to further substantiate your lodgement figures.404 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Recording your Payment or Refund
After you’ve paid your BAS or IAS, you need to record your payment or refund. 
Assuming you use bank feeds, the easiest method is to set up an allocation tem￾plate to auto-split the allocation across the relevant accounts:
1. Go to Banking → Bank Transactions.
2. Locate the BAS payment or refund and click the drop-down arrow to the 
far right to expand the transaction.
For a reminder on how to find transactions, turn to Chapter 6.
3. Click Create Rule.
A Create Rule pop-up window appears.
4. For BAS payments, select Spend Money Transaction; for BAS refunds, 
select Receive Money Transaction.
5. Give the Rule (template) a Rule Name, such as BAS.
6. Change the Rule Type to Allocation Template.
As soon as you change to this Rule Type, your rule conditions disappear.
7. Create the Allocation Template by adding accounts to the Allocate By 
section.
Add the GST Balance account (or GST Collected and GST Paid accounts). If you 
have payroll, also add the PAYG Withholding Payable account. You can also 
add other accounts as required, such as PAYG Instalment Tax or Fuel Tax 
Rebate accounts if these payments form part of your regular BAS.
8. Set your Job and Tax Codes as needed.
You are not likely to need a Job code in this instance, unless you track your BAS 
payments.
9. Click Save.
To use the BAS allocation template to record BAS payments or refunds:
1. When a BAS payment or refund appears in your bank transactions, 
expand the transaction by clicking the drop-down arrow to the far right.
The transaction expands.CHAPTER 16 The Gist of GST 405
2. Select the Allocate tab, if this is not the default tab.
3. Click the Apply Allocation Template drop-down arrow and select the BAS 
template.
The account codes prefill (saving you time finding the correct ones), so you just 
need to enter the correct split amounts to make up the payment.
Figure 16-7 shows an example allocation.
4. Check the figures balance and the Unallocated amount is $0.00, then 
click Save.

Chapter 17
Understanding 
Your Business
Before accounting software gave people the ability to analyse information 
with such ease, many businesses led a precarious existence where optimism 
and intuition played a bigger part than the analysis of facts and figures. To 
some extent this still happens, especially in smaller businesses.
Without information at their fingertips, many businesses operate in the dark. For 
example, a builder knows that only some jobs make money, but they’re not sure 
which ones; a baker suspects that one of the branches is profitable, while the other 
isn’t; and a salon owner wonders whether the expenses from the beauty services 
they provide eat into the profits made through hairdressing.
What if you could switch the light on? If the builder knew for certain which jobs 
brought in the money, they’d probably be more selective with their clients; if the 
baker could see just how much the second shop was losing, they’d likely close it 
down (or try a new location); and if the salon owner could really analyse the beau￾tician figures, they’d make some big changes.
MYOB gives you all these insights at your fingertips, with the ability to cast as 
much light on any situation as you could wish for. MYOB is like a giant report card

(yep, back to my teaching days!) that helps you check if what you think you know 
is in fact real, giving you the information you need to take action.
In this chapter, I explain how you can use MYOB to analyse where you make 
money, and where you don’t.
Generating Financial Statements
I’m always amazed at the number of clients who work on their books for hours 
every week without taking the time to generate financial reports. It’s a bit like 
being a wedding planner but never attending the main event.
In this section, I explain how to generate Profit and Loss reports and Balance 
Sheet reports using MYOB. I don’t have the space in this book to explain how to 
interpret and understand these reports, but if you do want to explore this topic 
in more detail, I suggest you get hold of a copy of Bookkeeping For Dummies, 
3rd Australian Edition, by Veechi Curtis. A conversation with your trusted accoun￾tant or bookkeeper may also be useful.
Before you start running reports, ensure all data entry is up to date for the period 
that you’re reporting for, as you can’t generate meaningful reports if any impor￾tant information is missing. In the ideal world, take the time to reconcile your 
bank accounts as well. (Chapter 9 gets you up to speed with reconciling if you need 
a reminder.)
Exploring your Profit and Loss report
The most essential reference for any business is the Profit and Loss report, a finan￾cial statement that ‘tells the story’ of a business, summarising income, costs and 
expenses for a specified period of time.
A Profit and Loss report is split into five sections:
» Income: At the top of the Profit and Loss report is your income, grouped by 
individual income accounts.
» Cost of sales: Hot on the heels of income is your cost of sales (the direct costs 
related to earning your income, such as the cost of materials). If you run a 
service business, your cost of sales may be zero.
» Gross profit: Gross profit is the difference between your income and the cost 
of sales. This figure can provide valuable insights: For example, do the items CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 409
you sell give you enough margin to make a profit? Are your costs too high or 
are you selling products too cheaply?
» Expenses: These are the overheads (also known as fixed expenses) of running 
your business.
» Net profit: Deduct your expenses from your gross profit to get your net profit
(that is, how much money you’ve made).
In the following sections, I show you how to view and customise your Profit and 
Loss report.
Tracking profitability from your Dashboard
You can quickly view your profitability every day from your Dashboard. In the 
Financial Position section, a simple graphic shows how your profit is tracking as 
the months go by. As shown in Figure 17-1, you can see the following information 
at a glance:
» Total income and expenses, month by month — click the dots to see more 
detailed figures.
» Cumulative income, expenses and profit, as a line graph.
FIGURE 17-1:
An at-a-glance 
view of your 
profitability on 
your Dashboard.410 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
You can click the three dots in the top right of the Financial Position section to 
customise the reporting period (this month, the last three months, this financial 
year or last financial year) or you can click the bar chart icon to view the full detail 
of your Profit and Loss report.
Viewing your Profit and Loss report
While the Dashboard provides a useful snapshot, most people prefer to work with 
a more detailed Profit and Loss report. To view this report, go to Reporting →
Reports and find your Profit and Loss report on the Business tab.
You can customise this report in many different ways. I suggest you display your 
Profit and Loss report for the last few months and then experiment with the 
following:
» Adjust your reporting period: Customise the Date Range, Date From or Date 
To fields to view your Profit and Loss report for any period of time.
» Tinker with your Breakdown periods: Experiment with Breakdown periods 
in your Profit and Loss report to analyse financial results by month, quarter or 
year. For example, if you select the last 18 months as the reporting period, 
and then select Quarterly as the Breakdown, MYOB displays six columns (one 
column for each of the previous six quarters). Or, if you select the last three 
years as the reporting period and Yearly as the Breakdown, MYOB displays 
three columns, one for each year.
» Toggle your Accounting Method: Change the Accounting Method from 
Accrual to Cash to display the income you’ve actually received in your bank 
account (as opposed to invoices you’ve raised), and the expenses you’ve 
actually paid for (as opposed to purchases you’ve entered). Viewing your Profit 
and Loss report on a cash basis can help give insights as to why your cashflow 
situation may be quite different from your actual profitability. (Toggling the 
display of this report doesn’t influence your GST report settings, where the 
choice between Accrual and Cash reporting isn’t something you should 
change from one month to the next.)
» Make a comparison: The Compare To section of your Profit and Loss report 
gives you a few options for comparison, including Year To Date, Last Year, 
% Sale Analysis and Budget. For example, if you select Last Year, you can see 
how the selected date range for the current year compares with the same 
period for the previous year. The report defaults to include both dollar and 
percentage variance columns, but you can click the Report Options button to 
hide this information.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 411
» Display data in a more summarised form: Click the Report Options button 
and select Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 or Level 4 to view your Profit and Loss 
report at different levels of detail. (You may find there isn’t much different 
between Levels 3 and 4 if you don’t use many parent header accounts.)
Figure 17-2 shows a Profit and Loss report with just one customisation scenario. 
The date range is for three months, the Breakdown is monthly, and last year’s 
figures (along with variance analysis) are included as a comparison. The dollar 
variance column has been hidden. This example demonstrates just how versatile 
the Profit and Loss report in MYOB Business is, and how you can almost always 
adapt the format to provide the information you need.
You can also drill down into any figures in purple by clicking through to see more 
detail and to check if something doesn’t seem right.
If you want to generate a particular version of your Profit and Loss report on a 
regular basis, save your options by clicking the Save As button. Chapter 15 talks 
about customising reports in more detail, including making your reports look 
smart and stylish when reporting to management.

Looking at your Balance Sheet
Think of your Profit and Loss as a story of what goes on in your business over any 
period of time, and your Balance Sheet as a photograph. A Balance Sheet is really 
a picture of how much you own and how much you owe at any point in time, and 
the difference between how much you own and how much you owe is your stake 
in the business. The Balance Sheet doesn’t get as much airtime as a Profit and 
Loss report in a lot of business discussions, which may be because many people 
don’t really understand this report fully — but the Balance Sheet is important for 
you to understand the financial health of your business.
Even though most people find Balance Sheets hard to understand, that doesn’t 
mean they’re not really important. A Balance Sheet is the first report I look at 
when checking if my Profit and Loss report is accurate, because this is where mis￾takes are easiest to spot. In other words, if you want to be able to rely on your 
Profit and Loss reports, you have to be certain your Balance Sheet is correct.
Viewing your Balance Sheet
Find the Balance Sheet report by going to Reporting → Reports. The Balance Sheet 
is on the Business tab. As the Balance Date, select the last day of the reporting 
period that you’re reviewing. For example, if you generate a Profit and Loss report 
that runs from 1 January to 31 March, then you want to select 31 March as the 
Balance Date when generating your Balance Sheet report.
Many of the customisation options available to your Profit and Loss report exist in 
your Balance Sheet report also. For example, you can use the Breakdown menu to 
compare account balances for each month, quarter or year of any selected period; 
you can click More Filters to hide or display variance columns; and you can play 
with the Account Levels menu to view this report in varying levels of detail. Be 
brave and experiment with different formats to find the information that works 
best for you.
Similar to a Profit and Loss report, you can also choose either Cash or Accrual as 
the Accounting Method. While selecting Cash as the Accounting Method on a 
Profit and Loss report can sometimes be useful if you’re trying to understand cash 
movements in your business, I suggest you stick with Accrual as the Accounting 
Method for your Balance Sheet. Otherwise, if you select Cash, this report 
can be rather confusing, as important assets and liabilities (such as Accounts 
Receivable — money owed to you; and Accounts Payable — money you owe) won’t 
be displayed.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 413
Checking your Balance Sheet
To check that the figures in your Balance Sheet are accurate, work through the 
following points:
» Ask yourself whether every single line on your Balance Sheet makes sense. 
A simple idea, but it works.
» Check that every bank account shows the right balance. Savings, credit card 
and loan accounts are the most prone to neglect, so check the amount 
showing on the Balance Sheet against the latest bank statements.
» Consider the balances of your fixed assets. Do they make sense? Perhaps 
you have an old bomb that barely scrapes through rego, but Motor Vehicles 
shows up as a $50,000 asset in your Balance Sheet. In this case, something 
has gone astray.
» All accumulated depreciation accounts should be minus figures. If they’re not, 
something is definitely crook.
» All liability accounts should be positive figures. If they’re not, again, something 
is almost certainly wrong. (GST Paid on Purchases is an exception to this rule!)
» Your Historical Balancing account should always be zero. If not, turn to 
Chapter 3 to shed some light on what may be wrong here.
Consolidating Financial Reports
A great feature of MYOB Business’s reporting is the ability to consolidate certain 
reports (you can consolidate your Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss and Cash Move￾ment reports). For example, if you run three different businesses, such as a hair￾dresser, a beauty shop and a nail salon, you can bring the data from all three 
MYOB files into one report in just a few seconds. After you generate the report, you 
can also view the transactions that make up the figures from one of the other files 
without even having that MYOB file open. This offers huge time savings, as in the 
past you would have needed to export the Profit and Loss report from all three 
files to Excel first, and then be a genius at Excel to get it compile the results from 
each business into a single report. Figure 17-3 shows an example of a consolidated 
report.
Despite the ease and convenience of consolidated reporting, creating multiple 
company files may not be the most elegant solution for businesses with several 
cost centres or divisions. Sometimes, the easiest solution is to use Job reporting 
instead  — something I talk about later in this chapter in ‘Seeing Where the 414 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Money’s Made’. Generally, if you have a single ABN for a business, then a single 
company file is the way to go; if you have multiple ABNs, then multiple company 
files are the solution.
To get the most out of your consolidated financial reporting, spend some time 
aligning your Chart of Accounts so that the account numbers and the account 
names are exactly the same in each file that you consolidate. If you have the same 
account number but a different account name, MYOB will create two separate line 
items in your consolidated reporting.
Figure 17-3 shows how consolidated reporting can provide a clear view of how all 
business under the same reporting entity are performing.
Working with Budgets and Cashflows
Part of getting intimate with your financials is deciding what you want the figures 
to be (as opposed to just looking at what they are) and figuring out how you’re 
going to get there. In order to do this, you need to get your hands dirty and draw 
up a few serious budgets — not to mention a cashflow projection to boot.
FIGURE 17-3:
Consolidate your 
other MYOB files 
into one report.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 415
A budget helps you plan, set goals, make decisions and assess how your business 
is tracking. Be clear on your purpose and keep figures achievable to maximise the 
usefulness of this report. Are you aiming to increase revenue to achieve a better 
gross profit margin, or are you struggling with cashflow and need to tighten your 
expenses?
Realistic budgets are a great tool for ensuring financial stability. However, do be 
aware that even if a Profit and Loss budget shows a surplus, this may not translate 
to a positive cash balance. Movements in accounts such as asset purchases, 
accounts receivable, loan repayments or stock held all have a big impact on cash 
that won’t be reflected in a Profit and Loss budget.
In the following sections, I show you how to create a budget and help you monitor 
your cashflow using cashflow reports.
Deciding whether it’s beans for the week
Budgeting helps you build a plan for growing sales, improving profits and manag￾ing costs. Any good business plan always includes a budget to guide you on what 
is realistically achievable, with a little sprinkle of hopes and dreams to encourage 
you to aim high.
Go to Reporting → Reports → Business, where you find the Budget Management 
report. By clicking on this report, you can create a budget in MYOB:
1. Click Create Budget.
This is where you add a name, description and time frame for your budget. 
Make the name reflective of the budget’s purpose, such as ‘Driving Growth in 
Sales 2024’ — get a little creative to motivate yourself!
You can create multiple budgets for different reasons, different lengths of time 
or to cover different areas of your business — you don’t have to include 
everything under one budget.
2. Click Save Changes when you’re happy with your selections.
The newly created budget page appears.
3. Choose the Type of budget as either Profit and Loss or Cash Movement.
The Profit and Loss budget is where most business owners start, enabling you 
to focus on creating budgets for income and expense accounts. This focus is 
sufficient for most businesses.416 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
However, if you have large inventory holdings or you have a highly seasonal 
business, the Cash Movement budget can provide useful insights into possible 
cashflow pinch points. Not only are you budgeting for income and expenses, 
but you plan for the increase or decrease in key accounts such as cash held, 
accounts receivable, inventory on hand or accounts payable. Cash Movement 
budgets are quite technical, and you may need the help of your accounting 
advisor.
4. Optional: If you think that this budget will be close to the actual results 
from the previous year, select Import Last Year’s Actual from the 
drop-down options under the Import button as a starting point.
Looking at the actual results from the previous year is a great reality check 
when creating budgets, although if you import last year’s figures, you do need 
to be careful to review all budget items and consider what is likely to change.
5. Choose your budget breakdown from the Breakdown field — monthly, 
quarterly and so on.
The breakdown you choose can depend on the purpose of the budget. 
Budgets are usually monthly because regular reporting means you can 
respond quickly if budgets fall behind targets.
6. Start entering the figures in each cell for your budget as required.
This is the tricky part of creating a budget. Keep it realistic. You can always 
amend a budget as you develop a greater understanding of what suits your 
business, especially if you are working on your first budget or if a significant 
event impacts your business.
Remember that some expenses are irregular, such as quarterly electricity bills 
or one-off annual payments. Also, keep an eye out for months with five pay 
weeks, rather than four. (Usually, if you pay employees weekly, every third 
month has five pay weeks, not four.)
7. When your budget is complete, click Save at the top right.
If you click into any cell, three symbols appear that enable you to fast-track your 
budgeting:
» Copy Across: Click this symbol to copy a figure across to all rows or columns.
» Average Across: Click this symbol to divide the total by the number of periods 
selected in the Breakdown menu. For example, if you select Monthly as your 
Breakdown, when you click the Average Across symbol, this will divide any 
total you enter in the first column by 12, and enter this amount across all 12 
columns.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 417
» Increase/Decrease: Selecting this symbol allows you to increase or decrease 
by a specified percentage or dollar amount. For example, you can set this to 
budget for a 3 per cent increase in income each month as a goal to drive sales. 
(Be careful to be realistic here, however!)
If you prefer to work in Excel so that you can use formulas to do more complex 
calculations, you can export your budget to Excel and then import it back to MYOB 
when you’ve finished. To do this, create your budget, enter any figures that don’t 
require calculations, and when you’re ready, select CSV from the Export menu. 
Open this CSV file in Excel, make all changes required, return to your budget 
report in MYOB, and click Import to import this CSV file back into your budget.
Generating cashflow reports
Within the Reporting menu, you find two different types of cashflow reports: A 
Statement of Cash Flow report and a Cash Movement report.
Truly understanding these cashflow reports can take some time as there are many 
moving parts. Don’t give up — spend some time exploring these reports to make 
sense of where your numbers are pulling from.
Turn to Chapter  19 if you find yourself in a really tight cashflow spot, which 
expands on different tips to help with cashflow management.
Statement of Cash Flow report
A Statement of Cash Flow report examines the money that has flowed in and out of 
your business during a set time period. This report often goes a long way towards 
explaining the mystery of why a business has a handsome profit but no cash, or 
vice versa. You can find the Statement of Cash Flow report under the Banking tab 
at Reporting → Reports.
This report groups cashflow movements according to the classifications you have 
selected for each asset, liability or equity account in your Chart of Accounts, and 
reports these movements under three headings:
» Cashflow from operating activities: This figure reports on the movement of 
Balance Sheet accounts that relate to everyday trading, such as your business 
bank accounts, receivables, payables and inventory.
» Cashflow from investment activities: This figure reports on movements in 
non-current assets, such as the sale or purchase of property, plant and 
equipment, or loans made to other entities.418 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
» Cashflow from financing activities: This figure reports on movements in 
non-current liabilities, such as the receipt or payment of loans, including loans 
from directors.
You can see an example of how this report works in Figure 17-4.
To get your Statement of Cash Flow report working correctly, you may need to 
review the Classifications in your Chart of Accounts. To do this, head to your Chart 
of Accounts and for each asset, liability or equity account that isn’t a bank account, 
select Operating, Investment or Financing from the Classification for Statement of 
Cash Flows field.
Many people think that a cash-based Profit and Loss report does the same job as 
a Statement of Cash Flow report. Not true. A Statement of Cash Flow includes a lot 
of information that you don’t get on a cash-based Profit and Loss, such as details 
about bank loans, owner’s drawings or new equipment purchases  — in other 
words, all the important Balance Sheet items that can affect your bank balance, 
but don’t display on a Profit and Loss report.
Cash Movement report
Similar to the Statement of Cash Flow report, the Cash Movement report shows the 
movement of all accounts, including bank accounts, in your business over a period 
FIGURE 17-4:
A Statement of 
Cash Flow report.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 419
of time. I find this report helps me monitor how my cash position has changed 
over time.
The format of the Cash Movement report is different to the Statement of Cash 
Flow report, listing income and expense accounts first, then assets and liabilities. 
I like how this format echoes my regular financial statements, although I still pre￾fer the Statement of Cash Flow report if I want the insight of how investment 
activities (as opposed to operating activities) have affected my cashflow.
The Cash Movement report also allows you to manipulate the Breakdown menu to 
view account movements organised by month or by quarter, and to click Consoli￾date to combine Cash Movement reports from multiple company files (the latter is 
only relevant if you have multiple businesses).
Seeing Where the Money’s Made
One of the fascinating facts about small businesses is that so many of them are 
really a collection of businesses bundled under the one name — like the newsa￾gent that doubles as a post office and dry-cleaning agent, or the DIY expert who 
fixes your cupboard doors and also mows the lawn. The secret of success in these 
kinds of businesses is to find out which part of the business is bringing in the 
dough, and how much profit it’s making.
MYOB’s ability to help you find out where your business is making money is one 
of its best-kept secrets. It’s a cinch! You simply use the Jobs list.
Find your Jobs list by going to Accounting → Jobs. The Jobs list comes with a help￾ful Profit and Loss summary as an overview of how your jobs are tracking. You can 
create a new Job from here, as well as edit and delete Jobs.
The Jobs list can be used for lots of different things: Cost centres, profit centres, 
projects, ventures, locations or any other identifiable arm of your business. I dis￾cuss this further in the following sections.
Finding out how jobs work
Every transaction you record includes the following information:
» A contact. The name of the customer, supplier or employee.
» An allocation account. This information is an account number or name in 
your Chart of Accounts and refers to the type of income or type of expense it 420 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
is. For example, a payment for electricity may be allocated to Electricity 
Expense, and a payment for rent may be allocated to Rent Expense.
» A job (optional). Ah, here we are! This is where you can record a Job Number, 
if you like, selecting what part of your business (whether it’s a project, a 
location or an arm of your business) this income or expense belongs to.
» A tax code. The GST code that applies.
You can allocate a Job to any transaction in MYOB Business simply by entering a 
Job Number in the Job field. For example, to allocate a Job when you’re working in 
the Bank Transactions page, click the drop-down arrow to the right of the trans￾action. Go to the Allocate tab (see Figure 17-5), where you will see the four pieces 
of information from the preceding list — the supplier (Billy Fresh F&V) is the 
Contact, the allocation account is Food Purchases (an expense account), the rele￾vant tax code is FRE and the Job Number is WDE (which in this example stands for 
‘White Dinner Event’).
Similarly, Figure 17-6 shows how I enter the same Job Number on a supplier bill. 
In addition, you can see the name of the supplier (the Contact), the allocation 
account and the tax code.
Making the most of job reporting
Make yourself a cuppa, sit back and have a think about how your business could 
use the jobs feature in MYOB. Contemplate the different projects you do and con￾sider whether your business is made up of different enterprises.
In case all this navel gazing doesn’t make sense to you, here are a few of my own 
examples, which show how I’ve set up jobs for different clients:
FIGURE 17-5:
Enter a Job 
Number so you 
can track income 
and expenses for 
projects, cost 
centres or 
locations.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 421
» One client has a café that offers both café dining and event catering. All café 
income and expenses are given the Job Number Café and all catering income 
and expenses are given different Job Numbers depending on the event (so 
they can see if some events are not worth running again, or work out how to 
change an event to make it profitable). This allows my client to produce a 
monthly Profit and Loss for the café business, a Profit and Loss for the 
catering aspect of the business (including all events as well as each event 
listed one by one), and a Profit and Loss for the combination of all parts of 
the business.
» A hairdresser friend has two salons in different suburbs of Perth — one in 
Claremont and one in Applecross. She codes the income and expenses from 
each salon with a different Job Number (C for Claremont and A for Applecross) 
so that she can print a Profit and Loss for each salon separately, as well as a 
Profit and Loss for the two salons combined. With this information, she can 
see which salon is more profitable and where she should perhaps allocate her 
staff for the month ahead.
» My uncle is a builder who builds several houses every year. He creates a new 
Job Number for every house and codes all income and expenses with these 
codes. This allows my uncle to see how much profit (or sometimes how much 
loss) he makes on each house. He can then look deeper into his reporting to 
see if particular suppliers or contractors might be more cost-effective and 
allow him to make greater profit.
FIGURE 17-6:
Job Numbers can 
be used on bills 
and invoices, as 
well as on 
expenses.422 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
You can find several useful Job reports by going to the Jobs tab at Reporting →
Reports. Type ‘Job’ in the Search field to view all reports relating to jobs. The Job 
Profit and Loss is usually your primary reference, although the Job Activity report, 
which groups job-related transactions by account, is also pretty handy.
If you find that you need more reporting power — perhaps you need to create job 
budgets, assign salespeople to jobs, track locations as well as projects or organise 
jobs into groups, then you may need to consider upgrading to AccountRight for 
these added functions. Alternatively, check out the MYOB App Marketplace as 
there are several specialist job-tracking apps that integrate with MYOB Business, 
and which may enable you to get the job reporting you need without having to 
upgrade.
Creating a new job
After you’ve got the idea around the benefits of jobs and how they work, you’re 
now ready to create your first new job. Here’s how:
1. Go to Accounting → Jobs.
The Jobs list page appears.
2. Click the Create Job button.
The Create Job page appears.
3. Enter a Job Number and, if you wish, a Job Name.
If you only have a few jobs, using letters to represent a job is best when setting 
your Job Number — numbers are harder to remember and you’re more likely 
to make a mistake with them. You can also use a combination of letters and 
numbers if you prefer (though remember MYOB sets a 15-character limit here), 
but I generally find the shorter the length of your Job Number, the better (three 
or four letters works for me).
The Job Number is the only mandatory field when you create a Job, so make 
sure the Job Number is recognisable and represents the Job. If you do add a 
Job Name, make it meaningful so you don’t mix it up with other Jobs.
4. Optional: Link a Customer and add a Job Description to the Job.
If a Job relates only to one customer (such as each customer my uncle builds a 
house for), it makes sense to link the customer’s Contact to the Job. Note 
however that with MYOB Business, job expenses linked to customers don’t 
flow through to invoicing in the same way as they do when using other MYOB 
products.
You can also add any extra helpful details into the Description field here.CHAPTER 17 Understanding Your Business 423
5. Click Save.
This adds the job to your Jobs list (see Figure 17-7) — just like that!
The Jobs list also gives you a nice little summary of the Net Profit ($) on your 
Jobs, which is great way to review all your Jobs at a glance to be sure they are 
on track.
Deleting Jobs
If you’ve created a new Job in error and have yet to assign any transactions to that 
Job, you still have time to click into the Job (via Jobs under the Accounting menu) 
and click the Delete button on the bottom left of the Job. However, if you’ve already 
assigned transactions to a Job, MYOB’s audit history protection won’t allow you to 
delete it.
FIGURE 17-7:
A Jobs list.
WHAT’S THAT THINGY?
When you’re working with Jobs, sooner or later you’ll come across expenses that are dif￾ficult to allocate to any one particular Job. Things such as accounting fees, bank charges, 
legal fees, merchant fees and even telephone bills are often hard to pigeonhole. I’ve got 
a neat solution to this dilemma: Create an additional Job called Admin and use this Job 
for all expenses that don’t belong to a particular Job. Then, you can generate a Profit 
and Loss report for each Job, as well as a Profit and Loss report that shows all shared 
overheads. It works a treat!424 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
If you want to delete a job that has transactions allocated to it, you must first 
remove the job from all these transactions. Your Job Transactions (Accrual) report 
is the best reference to identify every transaction. With the job removed, you can 
then proceed to delete the job.
As an easier alternative, you can instead make the job inactive. Simply click the Job 
Number from the Jobs list and select the Inactive Job checkbox.
As your Jobs list grows over time, consider making old jobs inactive so that when 
you’re processing transactions and you want to assign a job, you’re only searching 
through active jobs.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 425
Chapter 18
Keeping Your Accounts 
in Top Shape
Staying healthy is such an effort sometimes: working out at the gym, submit￾ting to the dentist’s chair, keeping tabs on your blood pressure — and so the 
list continues. So much to do, so little time.
You have to go through the same sort of checks with your MYOB file to keep it 
healthy. In this chapter, I explain how to take your MYOB file’s pulse, administer 
first aid where required, and keep both MYOB’s blood pressure, and your own, 
under control.
Reconciling Every Account
Earlier in this book (Chapter 9, to be precise), I devote an entire chapter to the 
exhilarating topic of bank reconciliations. Bank reconciliations form the guts of 
the whole accounting business, because until you’re sure all bank accounts bal￾ance, you can’t rely on a single report.
The most important bank account to reconcile is your main business bank account. 
Reconcile this account at least once a month so that your monthly Profit and Loss 
reports are meaningful.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Balancing accounts, one by one
» Introducing the Exceptions 
Dashboard (oh, what fun)
» Reviewing transactions and hunting 
for gremlins
» Checking GST, the fast way426 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
You also need to reconcile all other bank accounts regularly, such as savings, 
credit card and loan accounts, and you may need to reconcile other accounts such 
as clearing accounts, or your Undeposited Funds account. Whether these accounts 
need reconciling, and how often, depends upon the nature of the account and how 
you structure your business. Read on to find out more.
Credit card accounts
Think of credit card accounts in the same way as any other business transaction 
account and reconcile these accounts whenever you’re preparing to lodge a 
Business Activity Statement (or BAS, which you usually prepare monthly or 
quarterly).
Undeposited funds
Your Undeposited Funds account isn’t a real bank account. Instead, your Unde￾posited Funds account represents all payments received but not yet matched up 
against your bank feeds (I talk more about the Undeposited Funds account in 
Chapter 7).
Although you don’t need to waste precious time reconciling this account, I recom￾mend you take a moment to double-check that the closing balance at the end of 
each month is $0.00.
If the closing balance isn’t $0.00, and the transactions making up this balance are 
more than a few days’ old, then reconciling this account can sometimes help 
identify what’s gone wrong. Go to Reconcile Accounts, select your Undeposited 
Funds account, enter the Closing Bank Statement Balance as $0.00 and mark off 
all cleared transactions, working through a week or so of transactions at a time. 
Total deposits should equal total withdrawals, and the Out of Balance amount 
should be $0.00. Any deposits without matching withdrawals, or vice versa, flag 
the likely problem.
Petty cash
In Chapter  6,  I suggest either using a petty cash tin or recording petty cash 
expenses using general journal entries.
If you use a petty cash tin, I suggest you balance the tin every time you top it up. 
Stay on top of your petty cash reconciliation because receipts disappear fast, as do 
the couple of dollars for the chocolate bar in the staff room that you will put back 
tomorrow but never do.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 427
Clearing accounts
What’s a clearing account, you ask? Clearing accounts include Payroll Clearing, 
Electronic Clearing, Cash Drawer and the like. A clearing account isn’t a real bank 
account; rather, it’s a holding account where you allocate transactions for a wee 
while before you shift them to somewhere else.
You know a clearing account is in good health when its balance shows as zero. If 
the balance doesn’t show as zero at the end of a month, you may have a problem 
that requires investigation.
You reconcile clearing accounts the same way you reconcile any other bank 
account. Simply go to Reconcile Accounts, select the account number and date, 
and mark off all cleared transactions. The Closing Bank Statement Balance should 
be $0.00, total deposits should equal total withdrawals, and the Out of Balance 
amount should be $0.00.
If total deposits don’t equal total withdrawals, start from the beginning, changing 
your Statement Date so that you work your way forwards a week or a month at a 
time, marking off the deposits and withdrawals that cancel each other out, and 
clicking Reconcile to clear these transactions from the Reconcile Accounts win￾dow. With this task complete, only the transactions that don’t cancel each other 
out will remain, indicating the likely culprits for your out-of-balance amount.
Loan accounts
If you choose not to reconcile loan accounts, such as business loans or motor 
vehicle loans, that’s okay. After all, you’ve got to leave something for your accoun￾tant to do. On the other hand, you can save accounting fees and generate more 
accurate Profit and Loss reports if you do the hard yards and reconcile these loans.
If your loan account is set up with bank feeds, you can easily follow the normal 
bank reconciliation steps explained in Chapter 9. (If you need to manually enter 
transactions via Spend Money or Receive Money for your loan account and need a 
refresher, head to chapters 6 and 7.) Once all transactions have been entered, con￾tinue with the normal process of reconciling your loan account (as you would for 
any other bank account).
Ensure that your loan account is set up in your Chart of Accounts with the Account 
Type ‘Credit card’, as shown in Figure 18-1. ‘Credit card’ is the only Account Type 
within your Liabilities accounts from which you can record banking transactions.428 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
FIGURE 18-1:

EMPLOYING A FORENSIC EXPERT
Sometimes, when you’re running a health check on your accounts, you may encounter 
transactions that you don’t remember recording or changing, or you may even worry 
that somebody has been meddling with your records. Here’s when the Journal Security 
Audit report can come to the rescue.
The Journal Security Audit report displays all changes made to transactions for any 
selected date range. This is the only report in MYOB Business that you can filter by ses￾sion date (that is, the date a transaction was entered) as well as by transaction date.
The power of this report lies in the Report Options, where you can filter by transactions 
added, deleted, changed or reversed, as well as by User. For example, if you want to 
view all transactions deleted by a certain person in your office on a specific day, you 
can. (Unfortunately, the one area this report doesn’t track is payroll, so any changes 
made there will not be visible.)
The Journal Security Audit report can be found by going to Reporting → Reports, where 
you’ll find it on the Business tab.
I’ve conducted a few investigations in businesses where a manager suspects that an 
employee is fiddling the books. I’ve used the Journal Security Audit report to assist with 
such investigations, uncovering some unfortunate occurrences, such as receptionists 
deleting invoices and pocketing the proceeds after customers pay in cash. Hopefully this 
will never happen to you, and in the meantime, you’ll have peace of mind from knowing 
this report exists.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 429
Payroll accounts
You don’t have to reconcile payroll liability accounts in the same way as you rec￾oncile bank accounts, but I do recommend you ensure that all payroll liability 
accounts balance at the end of each month or quarter.
For more on how to do this, refer to Chapter 12.
Lining Up for a Health Check
With your account reconciliations complete, you’re now ready to continue the 
review of your business data. To do this, I recommend you make your way to the 
Exceptions Dashboard.
The Exceptions Dashboard is an often overlooked but very nifty little feature that 
helps you keep your accounts shipshape. Similar to what an auditor might do, the 
dashboard identifies any transactions that lie outside the norm, and flags if your 
accounts receivable or accounts payable are out of balance. To view this dash￾board, simply select Exceptions Dashboard from your Reporting menu.
The Exceptions Dashboard isn’t the only place from which you can view transac￾tion exceptions. Within your Report Settings (in your Settings), you can choose to 
show or hide your Exceptions Alerts. When you choose to show these alerts, a 
message pops up at the top of certain reports to alert you whenever there is an 
exception related to your sales, purchase or inventory (which sounds helpful but 
can also be annoying, so see what you prefer).
Figure 18-2 shows the Exceptions Dashboard page. The Transaction Review sec￾tion of this dashboard focuses on receivables, payables, inventory and transaction 
date issues, which I explain next in this chapter (see ‘Running Diagnostics: The 
Transaction Review’); the later Tax Review section focuses on GST-related queries 
(see ‘Dishing Out Medicine: The Tax Review’ later in this chapter).430 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Running Diagnostics: The Transaction 
Review
The Transaction Review section of the Exceptions Dashboard looks behind the 
scenes of your transactions to check that your data entry meets basic accounting 
principles.
To run this review, go to your Exceptions Dashboard overview page and select 
your Date Range (the beginning of the current financial year right up to the cur￾rent date is usually your best bet). Click the Run Review button. You’ll see a col￾umn showing either green ticks (meaning all is sweet) or red numbers (meaning 
it’s time to investigate further), similar to Figure 18-2.
In the next few sections I describe what each error message means and provide 
some hard-core troubleshooting tactics.
Reconciling invoices and bills
The first two reviews in your Transaction Review reconcile invoices with linked 
receivables, and bills with linked payables.
FIGURE 18-2:
The Exceptions 
Dashboard page.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 431
The main culprits that cause receivables or payables not to balance include incor￾rect opening balances (I explain how to set up opening balances in Chapter 3) or 
any transactions allocated directly to your Trade Debtors (Accounts Receivable) 
or Trade Creditors (Accounts Payable) accounts. The other possible culprit is a sale 
or purchase with a payment date that falls before the invoice date.
In this step-by-step guide, I help you diagnose what’s causing the out-of￾balance angst and explain how to administer the cure. To keep things simple, this 
set of instructions explains how to reconcile invoices and receivables. However, if 
you’re troubleshooting payables, you can still follow these instructions, but 
instead substitute the word ‘purchases’ for ‘sales’, the word ‘payables’ for ‘receiv￾ables’, and the words ‘Trade Creditors’ for ‘Trade Debtors’.
To work through the reconciliation, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t already, go to Reporting → Exceptions Dashboard.
The Exceptions Dashboard overview page appears showing all exceptions 
within your file as a red number in a circle. Green ticks are what you want 
to see.
2. Select the Date Range for which you’re checking your data (quarterly is 
ideal, or yearly at a minimum) and click Run Review.
3. Click the first Transaction Review report, the Receivables Reconciliation 
Exceptions.
Note: This report can also be accessed from the Sales tab via Reporting →
Reports.
I’m assuming that a red mark with one or more Exceptions has appeared on 
your Exceptions Dashboard overview page (as in Figure 18-2). If you have a 
green tick, you’re good to go!
4. Assess the Receivables Reconciliation Exceptions report.
This report compares the Total Amount Outstanding from your sales invoices 
against the balance of your Linked Receivables Account, displaying the Out of 
Balance Amount (the difference between the two) that you need to resolve. 
You need this out of balance amount to be $0.00.
5. Look through the Possible Causes of Exceptions list.
If you don’t see any exceptions listed here, don’t panic — it’s a good thing! Skip 
to Step 7.432 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
6. For every exception listed, drill down into the transaction by clicking the 
amount. See if you can identify and fix the problem.
Usually, the exception will reveal a transaction that has been allocated directly 
to your Trade Debtors or Accounts Receivables account (maybe a Spend 
Money transaction, a general journal or a service sale). The solution is to 
change the allocation account, seeking advice if you’re unsure which account to 
choose. Figure 18-3 shows this usual culprit.
7. If your receivables are still out of balance, return to your Exceptions 
Dashboard and see whether you have a red mark next to the Transaction 
Review item Prepaid Transactions.
Prepaid transactions are often the cause of receivables not balancing. Skip to 
‘Looking to the future, burying the past’, later in this chapter, to help you 
understand why.
8. If prepaid transactions don’t seem to be the problem, change your Date 
Range to the prior financial year. Click on the Receivables report again 
and check that the prior year’s Out of Balance Amount is $0.00.
If the Out of Balance Amount isn’t zero then you should talk to your accoun￾tant, as any changes you make to prior year data could impact other areas of 
your file.
FIGURE 18-3:
Allocating 
transactions to 
Trade Debtors or 
Trade Creditors is 
a big no-no.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 433
9. Assuming your Out of Balance Amount was zero at the beginning of the 
financial year, change the date filter again, but this time move the date 
forward just one month (say July). Run the report again to check if the 
Out of Balance Amount remains at $0.00. Repeat this action, moving the 
date forward a month at a time until an Out of Balance Amount appears.
Eyes on the prize? Well done.
10. Try to narrow this Out of Balance Amount to a particular day of the 
month.
Using elimination and your death-defying powers of logic, keep narrowing 
down the date until you identify the exact day when the Out of Balance 
Amount first appeared.
11. Note down the date that this Out of Balance first appeared as well as the 
Out of Balance Amount.
12. Go to Find Transactions (under Banking), select the Find and Replace tab, 
filter for your Trade Debtors/Receivables account and enter the date that 
things went wrong as both the From and the To date.
Usually, the offending transaction is waving a red flag at you right about now.
13. Fix the transaction.
If you’re not sure how to reallocate this transaction, you may be best to talk to 
your accountant.
14. Cross your fingers, return to your Receivables Reconciliation Exceptions 
report and click Run Review again to check that the problem is fixed.
Time to celebrate?
15. Repeat these steps with your Payables Reconciliation Exceptions report, 
ensuring that your Trade Creditors (Accounts Payable) account is in 
balance.
Giving inventory a clean bill of health
The next step in the Transaction Review is the Inventory Value Reconciliation 
(just saying it makes me feel queasy). If you get a red mark here, grab your steth￾oscope and take some emergency action:
1. Go to Reporting → Exceptions Dashboard.
2. Select the Date Range.
This Financial Year to Date is usually a pretty good starting point.434 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
3. Click the Inventory Value Reconciliation report from the Transaction 
Review section.
Note: This report can also be accessed from the Inventory tab via Reporting →
Reports. If you access the report this way, select the current date as your As 
At Date.
I can feel the heart palpitations starting!
4. Assess the Inventory Value Reconciliation report.
If you access this report from the Exceptions Dashboard, you’ll see the Total 
Value of All On-hand Inventory and the value of your Linked Inventory Account, 
and any Out of Balance Amount (the difference between the two) that you 
need to resolve.
If you access this report from your Reporting menu, you’ll see the Account 
Balance, Inventory Value and Out of Balance amount for each inventory 
account. Note that the exceptions appear in a summary view when first 
opened and to see the possible causes of these exceptions, you need to click 
Expand All.
Regardless of which method you use to access this report, you need the Out of 
Balance Amounts to be $0.00.
5. Look through the Possible Causes of Exceptions list.
If you don’t see any exceptions listed here, skip to Step 7.
6. For every exception listed, drill down into the transaction and see if you 
can identify and fix the problem.
Most often, the exception is a transaction that has been allocated directly to 
your Inventory asset account (maybe an adjustment, general journal or a 
service sale). The solution is to change the allocation account, seeking advice if 
you’re unsure which account to choose. If the transaction is an item sale or 
item purchase, double-check the linked account codes for each item listed. 
(Your inventory account should only ever be used as the Asset Account and 
never as the Cost of Sales or Income Account.)
7. After you’ve dealt with every possible cause of exception, redisplay the 
report and check that the Out of Balance Amount is zero.
It is? Then your work is done. If it isn’t, keep reading . . .
Troubleshooting inventory when it’s sick
So, you can’t get a green tick for inventory in the Exceptions Dashboard? Time to 
get out the surgical tools:CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 435
1. Go to Reporting → Reports and select the Inventory tab. Click the 
Inventory Value Reconciliation report.
2. Select the first day of the financial year as the date.
3. If the Out of Balance Amount is zero, breathe a sigh of relief and skip to 
the next step.
If the Out of Balance Amount isn’t zero (at your starting point), the problem 
with your inventory relates to last financial year and you should talk to your 
accountant to rectify this.
4. Move the date forward a month at a time, until an Out of Balance 
Amount crops up on the report.
Aha! You’re now one step further towards solving the mystery.
5. Now try to narrow down the date range, and identify the exact date 
when the Out of Balance Amount first arose.
For example, if inventory balanced on 1 Aug but didn’t on 1 Sept, run the 
reports for say 5 Aug, 10 Aug, 15 Aug and so on. Using a process of elimination, 
identify the date when things went astray.
6. Go to Find Transactions (under Banking), select the Find and Replace tab, 
and filter for your Inventory account. Enter the date that things went 
wrong as both the From and the To date.
7. Scan every transaction in your inventory account for that date and see if 
you can spot the culprit.
Transactions that cause trouble are purchases or general journals that have 
your inventory account as the Allocation Account. Sometimes you need to drill 
down into the item (remember, you can drill down into anything purple in 
MYOB Business) to explore and repair the issue.
8. Reallocate the transaction, correctly this time.
If you’re not sure how to reallocate a transaction, ask your accountant.
9. Regenerate the Inventory Value Reconciliation report. Hopefully all is 
now well!
Of course, if you have more than one problem in your file, you may have to 
continue moving forward, month by month, fixing transactions as you go.
Looking to the future, burying the past
The final reviews in your Transaction Review scan for future-dated and prepaid 
transactions.436 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
Future-dated transactions
This review picks up any transactions with a date later than the End Date you 
enter in the Transaction Review. Given that you’re usually best to select the cur￾rent date as your End Date, any future-dated transactions that do show up are 
almost always mistakes, such as someone dating a transaction 31/12/2034 instead 
of 31/12/2024.
Prepaid transactions
This review identifies any sales or purchases where the payment date falls before 
the invoice date. The easiest solution is to drill down into each transaction and 
change the date of the sale or purchase so that it’s the same as, or falls before, the 
payment date.
What should you do if the customer really did pay before you did the work? In this 
situation, the more correct accounting treatment for this transaction is to record 
a sales order for the customer first, applying the customer’s payment as a deposit. 
Later, when you complete the job, you convert the order to an invoice.
However, at the time of writing, one limitation with MYOB Business is that 
although you can apply payments against purchase orders, you can’t apply pay￾ments against sales orders (though this is likely to be an option in future — watch 
this space!). If you receive lots of payments in advance, you may need to talk to 
your accountant about how best to manage recording these payments and whether 
it’s going to be okay to have payments that pre-date the invoices against which 
they’re matched. In particular, prepaid transactions that span the end of a finan￾cial year can be tricky to deal with.
Dishing Out Medicine: The Tax Review
The last step of the Exceptions Dashboard report is the Tax Review. Contrary to the 
overwhelming dullness implied by the name, this review is actually quite a nifty 
wee beastie, surprisingly efficient at highlighting mistakes and inconsistencies.
Taking exception
The Tax Review identifies any transactions where the tax code for an account dif￾fers from the tax code on the transaction. For example, if you have GST as the tax 
code for Telephone Expense but you record the payment of a telephone bill with 
the FRE code, then this transaction comes up as a tax code exception.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 437
Note: One tax code exception review is for cash transactions (Spend/Receive Money 
and general journals) and the other is for invoice transactions (sales and pur￾chases), so you’ve got everything covered in these two reviews.
Just because something appears as a tax code exception doesn’t mean to say 
you’ve made a mistake. For example, you may have GST as the Tax Code for Staff 
Amenities Expense, which makes sense, because most of these expenses include 
GST. However, every now and then you buy coffee and tea and these beverages, 
defined by the powers-that-be as a necessity, are GST-free. The fact that you 
allocate this purchase to Staff Amenities and code this transaction as GST-free 
doesn’t mean you got it wrong.
I generally check my Tax Code Exception report each month or quarter, when I’m 
getting ready to lodge my Business Activity Statement (BAS). I start by selecting 
the date range for that BAS period, and if I see any exceptions highlighted with a 
red circle, I click through to the report and check each transaction. If I’m confi￾dent the Tax Code is correct then I leave the transaction as is, but if I see that the 
Tax Code is wrong, I simply click the Amount field to drill down to the original 
transaction, from where I can edit the Tax Code.
You may find that the problem is that the default Tax Code for the account itself is 
wrong in your Chart of Accounts. To fix this, go to your Chart of Accounts (under 
the Accounting menu), find the account in question and change the Tax Code.
Making sure the whole deal is spot on
Every time you record a transaction that includes GST, the transaction impacts on 
a special account called GST Balance. Therefore, the balance of this liability 
account represents a running balance of how much GST you owe, or are owed.
The correct technique for ensuring that this account balances depends on whether 
you report for GST on an accruals basis or a cash basis.
If you report for GST on an accruals basis, here’s what to do:
1. Go to Reporting → Reports and generate a Balance Sheet for the last day 
of the reporting period on your most recent BAS.
For example, if your most recent BAS was for the month of June, generate a 
Balance Sheet dated 30 June.
2. On your Balance Sheet, look at the balance of your GST Balance account.438 PART 4 Making MYOB Work for You
3. In your most recent BAS, look up the amounts you declared for GST 
Collected and GST Paid, and calculate the difference between the two.
For example, if GST Collected was $10,000 and GST Paid was $6,000, the 
difference would be $4,000.
Not sure where to look? Check out boxes 1A and 1B on your statement.
4. Compare the figure from Step 2 against the figures from Step 3. Guess 
what? They should match.
If the two figures don’t match and the difference is more than $100 or so, you 
need to take further action. I suggest you go right back to the beginning of the 
financial year and do this health check for each GST period so that you can 
pinpoint where the issue started. If the problem goes further back to before 
the beginning of the financial year, usually the best approach is to talk to your 
accountant.
If you report for GST on a cash basis, things take a much trickier turn because you 
have to allow for the GST that you haven’t paid yet (because you haven’t received 
payments from customers for outstanding invoices or you haven’t paid suppliers 
for outstanding bills). I’m a little hesitant sharing this procedure with you, 
because the whole deal is unashamedly tricky, but if you can master reconciling 
GST on a cash basis, you’re already truly ahead of the pack.
1. Look up the amounts you declared for GST Collected and GST Paid on 
your most recent BAS and calculate the difference between the two.
You’re looking at boxes 1A and 1B on your statement. Write these amounts 
down in a spreadsheet (see Step One of Figure 18-4 for how to do this).
2. Go to Reporting → Reports. From the Sales tab, generate a Receivables 
Reconciliation with Tax report and from the Purchases tab, generate a 
Payables Reconciliation with Tax report, each for the same BAS date. 
Note down the Tax Outstanding on each of these reports.
3. Calculate the difference between Tax Outstanding on Receivables and 
Tax Outstanding on Payables.
For example, if Tax Outstanding on Receivables is $320.10 and Tax 
Outstanding on Payables is $210.20, the difference is $109.90. Step Two of 
Figure 18-4 shows this whole drama in action.
4. Go to Reporting → Reports and generate a Balance Sheet for the same 
period, and look at the balance of your GST Balance account.
For example, if your most recent Business Activity Statement was for the 
month of June, generate a Balance Sheet dated 30 June. Enter this amount on 
your spreadsheet, as shown in Step Three of Figure 18-4.CHAPTER 18 Keeping Your Accounts in Top Shape 439
5. Compare the figure from Step 4 against the figure from Step 3. If the stars 
are in your favour, these figures should match.
If the two figures don’t match and the difference is more than $100 or so, take 
further action. I suggest you go right back to the beginning of the financial year 
and do this health check for each GST period. This way you can hopefully see 
where the problem began. If the issue relates further back to before the 
beginning of the financial year, your best approach is to talk to your 
accountant.

Ten Useful Tools for 
Managing Cashflow
Cashflow is imperative for the survival of a business and should always be 
front and centre for any business owner. Many businesses, particularly 
those that are growing quickly, can be quite profitable and yet still encoun￾ter significant cashflow difficulties.
This chapter shares ten tools for keeping your cashflow under control — after all, 
without working capital in a business, how can you make purchases, pay employ￾ees or settle your debts? By utilising these ten tools, you can use MYOB to bring all 
aspects of running your business together.
If you’re new to owning a business, hire a competent bookkeeper or accountant as 
early as you can as they offer great business advice and help keep your accounts 
up to date. Accurate reporting is essential for monitoring profitability, ensuring 
adequate cashflow, and keeping day-to-day activities on track.

cashflow444 PART 5 The Part of Tens
Offer Online Invoice Payments
Giving your customers the option of paying in many ways encourages faster pay￾ments. By offering Online Invoice Payments (OIP) to your customers, you reduce 
possible barriers to payment as your customers have the option to pay not just by 
direct transfer, but by Visa, Mastercard, Amex, BPAY, Apple Pay, Google Pay and 
PayPal. MYOB suggests you may get paid up to three times faster by offering these 
payment method alternatives. You can now even text message an invoice to cus￾tomers using OIP so they can settle their bill on their phone in seconds via Google 
Pay or Apple Pay.
The convenience of offering OIP to your customers has the downside of an attached 
merchant fee (which you can choose to pass on to your customer), plus a small 
$0.25c transaction fee (that can’t be passed on to customers). If you choose not to 
pass on the merchant fee to customers, this can amount to a significant expense 
for higher-value invoices, so you may wish to be selective about which invoices 
you offer this payment method for.
You can choose whether to make this feature available to all customers or just to 
specific customers, perhaps limiting this offer to those who request it or who are 
always late to pay. Once set up, you can easily toggle the option to Allow Online 
Payments when you’re creating an invoice; you can also click Apply Surcharge on 
individual invoices to select whether you want to pass on the merchant fee to the 
customer or whether the business will carry this expense. The choices are all yours 
here, so consider what works best for your business.
Turn to Chapter 7 for a guide to setting up OIP.
Use eInvoicing to Speed Up 
Invoice Processing
Although relatively new for most Australian businesses, eInvoicing has the poten￾tial to improve your cashflow in two ways:
» If both you and your customer use eInvoicing, your invoices are pushed 
through directly to your customer’s software without you having to email 
them. This way, all invoice details are prefilled at your customer’s end, 
hopefully expediting payment.CHAPTER 19 Ten Useful Tools for Managing Cashflow 445
» With eInvoicing, your customer has the immediate option to reject an invoice 
if something isn’t quite right, and add a note to explain why; for example, if 
they receive 10 packets of Freckles but you invoiced for 12.
The Activity column on your Invoices list (Sales → Invoices) will instantly label 
the invoice as Rejected. If you click the invoice number you’ll be able to see the 
note explaining why it was rejected, and you can then rectify the problem 
quickly and resend the invoice. The whole process takes place within the 
eInvoicing system, so there’ll be no ‘dealing with email’ delays.
While eInvoicing is a very new way of doing business that is not widely used yet, 
it is likely to continue to grow as businesses see the benefits of sending invoices 
electronically in this way. Chapter 4 covers eInvoicing in more detail.
If you do business with any federal government agencies, you’ll want to switch on 
eInvoicing as soon as possible. Under new legislation, federal government bodies 
receiving invoices using this system are obliged to process payments within five 
days wherever possible.
Switch on Invoice Reminders
You always want to encourage your customers to pay on time, and with invoice 
reminders you can do exactly that. The best part is, after you’ve set up invoice 
reminders, MYOB requires no further effort from you and will take care of the rest!
To set up invoice reminders, click on your Settings menu, select Sales Settings and 
go to the Reminders tab. MYOB includes three default email reminders, each one 
worded slightly differently according to how overdue the invoice is. You can edit 
both the timing and wording of these defaults, with the option to have up to five 
different reminders. You can choose to use reminders for all your customers or 
just the ones who are always late — it’s up to you. (Chapter 7 covers setting up 
invoice reminders from start to finish.)
These reminders really do work a treat — sometimes customers just need a gentle 
nudge, especially if they genuinely missed or forgot about your invoice. Remind￾ers encourage customers to pay up and may even be an incentive for some cus￾tomers if they don’t want to receive reminders in the future — that’s definitely 
how I react if I see one!
To use invoice reminders effectively, be sure to match all payments received 
against customer invoices every day so that reminders are only sent for invoices 
that remain genuinely unpaid (Chapter  7 talks about recording customer pay￾ments in more detail).446 PART 5 The Part of Tens
Stay on Top of Who Owes You Money
If you’ve offered your customers every opportunity to pay their invoice by the 
agreed due date in a way that works for them (such as through invoice reminders, 
OIP or eInvoicing), you hopefully don’t have many outstanding invoices that 
require tougher tactics. Sadly, however, a few customers may give your grief, so 
debtor management remains key.
The Unpaid Invoices report (go to Reporting → Reports, where you’ll find it under 
the Sales tab) is a great place to monitor who owes you money, providing a quick 
summary of what you’re owed. You can then click Expand All to see full invoice 
details so you have them to hand when you’re following up with your customers.
This report is only as valuable as the data you put into MYOB.  Be sure you’ve 
matched off all deposits in your bank feeds before you get carried away with chas￾ing overdue payments! Chapter 7 covers allocating your invoice payments cor￾rectly. If things are a little skewed and don’t match up, most of this will come out 
in the wash when you reconcile your bank accounts — Chapter 9 guides you on 
how to fix these kinds of mishaps.
Keep Track of Your Invoicing Activity
The key to cashflow is ensuring that you get paid on time. Happily, MYOB helps 
you do just this with its Invoice Activity feature.
In Figure 19-1, the list of invoices (accessed via Sales → Invoices) includes a col￾umn labelled Activity. As you can see, this column clearly indicates whether you’ve 
emailed the invoice, whether delivery was successful and whether the customer 
has viewed the invoice.
Keep your eyes peeled for any invoices that show nothing in the Activity column, 
as this usually means you’ve forgotten to send the invoice. Also, watch out for a 
Delivery Failed status, which usually indicates you’ve got the wrong email address. 
In both cases, the customer is yet to receive your invoice.
The other time invoice activity information can be useful is when you’re chasing 
overdue invoices. If a customer is slow to pay, click the invoice number and scroll 
to the bottom, where you can see a full Activity History, including time and date 
stamps for when the invoice was created, viewed, printed or downloaded. This 
way, you know if customers are being truthful if they say they haven’t received 
your invoice yet, and you can see at a glance when the invoice was first viewed or 
downloaded.CHAPTER 19 Ten Useful Tools for Managing Cashflow 447
Get Bank Feeds Up and Running
One of the secrets to ensuring good cashflow management is having up-to-date 
financial reports available for your business. And one of the best ways to guaran￾tee your reports are always up to date is to use bank feeds to record and match 
business transactions.
Bank feeds allow you to process transactions quickly and accurately as they enable 
you to automate large portions of what would otherwise be manual data entry.
If you’re a little hesitant about connecting your bank feeds, remember that bank 
feeds don’t mean that you relinquish control to your bank, nor do they entail any 
risk to banking security. You don’t need to enter any banking passwords in MYOB, 
nor can you withdraw funds from your bank account using MYOB. Bank feeds are 
simply an electronic copy of all transactions that are sent from your bank through 
to MYOB.
Chapter 5 steps you through how to connect and use your bank feeds like a pro and 
make full use of all the automations available.
Record Supplier Bills Swiftly Via the In Tray
So far in this chapter, the tools suggested have involved the income side of the 
ledger; however, if you’re monitoring your cashflow, you also need to stay aware 
of how much money you owe.
For example, say you have $50,000 in the bank. You may think ‘Hurrah! I can buy 
a new ‘Mazdarati’!’ However, if you aren’t recording your bills into MYOB in a 
timely manner, how can you know what you have available to spend? After 
FIGURE 19-1:

meeting all your obligations, you may only be able to afford an electric scooter 
rather than a car.
Using MYOB’s In Tray can help you keep track of outstanding bills by automating 
the data entry of supplier invoices as soon as they arrive. Data such as the supplier 
name, date, amount and account code (if you’ve pre-set it in your supplier’s con￾tact card) can all be extracted — and if you’re using eInvoicing, you can even 
extract the description information. Most of the time, all you need to do to enter 
the invoice into MYOB is a quick review before clicking Save.
Chapter 8 shows you all the ways you can get your bills into the In Tray, and how 
to pick the approach that works best for you.
Understand the Difference between 
Profitability and Cashflow
In order to manage your cashflow, it pays to understand why the profit shown in 
the bottom line of your Profit and Loss report can be quite different to the change 
in your bank balance over that same period. Here are a few reasons why:
» You’ve paid tax: If you’re a sole trader or partnership and you’ve paid income 
tax during this period, this tax won’t appear as an expense in your Profit and 
Loss report. However, the payment will impact your bank balance.
» You owe GST: As you approach the end of each BAS reporting period, you 
may end up owing much more in GST collected than you can claim back in 
GST paid. This difference translates to a temporary (and potentially quite 
deceptive) boost to your bank balance.
» You’ve purchased a vehicle or equipment: The purchase of assets doesn’t 
show on your Profit and Loss report but instead affects your Balance Sheet.
» The business has either repaid loans or taken out a new loan: The receipt 
of a new loan doesn’t show as income on your Profit and Loss report, nor do 
loan repayments show up as expenses.
» The amount customers owe you has increased or decreased: If total funds 
owing from customers appear more at the end of the period than at the 
beginning, this drains your bank balance; likewise, if the amount owing has 
decreased, this increases your bank balance. The opposite applies to 
increased or decreased amounts owing to suppliers.
» Your inventory levels have increased or decreased: Any increase in 
inventory levels uses up cash; the opposite applies to any decrease.CHAPTER 19 Ten Useful Tools for Managing Cashflow 449
Please don’t be overwhelmed by this long list — help is at hand! In Chapter 17, I 
explain how to generate a Statement of Cash Flow report. For any selected period, 
this succinct report details how your cashflow has been impacted by different fac￾tors. If you refer to this report regularly and take time to understand the detail, 
you’ll develop valuable insights into how you can improve cashflow management 
in the future.
Don’t be tricked into thinking a cash-based Profit and Loss report does the same 
job as a Statement of Cash Flow report. Not true. A Statement of Cash Flow includes 
a lot of information that you don’t get on a cash-based Profit and Loss report, such 
as details about bank loans, owner’s drawings and new equipment purchases.
Head to the App Marketplace
MYOB’s cashflow reports focus upon the past, not the future. For example, to ana￾lyse all factors affecting your cash balance for the last three months, reports such 
as the Statement of Cash Flow are just the ticket. However, if you want to create 
detailed projections predicting what your cashflow might be in 3, 6 or 12 months’ 
time, then MYOB on its own isn’t much help.
Anticipating cashflow challenges is vital for survival but can be super tricky, espe￾cially if your business is growing quickly.
While many accountants use Excel for cashflow projections, such reports tend to 
get pretty technical for those without a mathematical bent. Fortunately, you can 
now find many apps that integrate with MYOB and help with both cashflow 
reporting and getting paid quickly.
To view these apps, go to your business name and select App Marketplace. Select 
your MYOB version in the left menu, and type ‘cashflow’ in the Search bar to see 
a whole range of apps that can not only help you generate cashflow projections, 
but also can help with credit management and debt collection.
Use Comparative Reporting
Comparing your performance across different time periods helps highlight areas 
of potential growth or decline, and can be key to anticipating your business and 
cashflow cycles.450 PART 5 The Part of Tens
To set up an insightful comparative report that compares your monthly Profit and 
Loss report to the same period in the prior year, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Reporting → Reports. Click the Profit and Loss report on the 
Business tab.
2. Adjust your date range to cover the current financial year.
3. Choose Monthly as your Breakdown.
4. Tick the Compare To Last Year checkbox in the Compare To section.
When you select this option, you will see two extra columns that show 
Variances (the difference between this year and last year) as a dollar or 
percentage amount, giving you an insight into how you’re tracking against last 
year for each month.
If you only want to see the Variance in dollars or as a percentage, you can 
choose to hide either or both of the Variance columns by clicking the Report 
Options button and checking or unchecking the options you want. You can 
tinker with other report display aspects here too so you can customise the 
report to your liking.
After you select your options above and get the report just as you like it, remember 
to click Save As in the top right of the report so that you can revisit this custom￾ised report exactly as it is now. Chapter 15 goes into more detail on saving your 
customised reports for speedy access next time you need them.CHAPTER 20 Ten Essential Tasks When Preparing Your Business Activity Statement 451

Ten Essential Tasks 
When Preparing Your 
Business Activity 
Statement
A big cause of headaches for business owners is lodging Business Activity 
Statements (BAS) by the due date. The best advice I can give here is keep 
up to date with your bookkeeping so when BAS time comes around, you’re 
only dealing with a few stress-free checks and balances before you’re ready to 
lodge your BAS. In addition, don’t hesitate to adopt the automations in MYOB such 
as bank feeds, rules and the In Tray to ensure that your accounts are completed as 
quickly and efficiently as possible.
In this chapter, I share ten useful steps you can follow when it’s time to prepare 
your BAS so that not only is your BAS lodged on time, but you can be confident 
that all the information is correct.

your BAS452 PART 5 The Part of Tens
Check All Bank Transactions 
Have Been Allocated
Only when you’ve allocated your transactions do they move through to the 
general ledger and thus the bank reconciliation. If you’re using bank feeds, go to 
Banking → Bank Transactions and select All bank accounts in the top left. Filter 
the Status to select Unallocated transactions and then choose the applicable date 
range to see if you’ve missed allocating any transactions along the way.
If you don’t allocate every single bank transaction for the required BAS period, 
your accounts will be incomplete, and the information generated for your BAS will 
be wrong.
Extend the date range wider than just the month or quarter you’re focusing on 
when you’re looking for any unallocated transactions. Inadvertently, some trans￾actions may have been fixed or deleted from prior periods and so could get pushed 
back to your bank transactions as unallocated, so checking back further ensures 
you won’t encounter issues when you come to reconcile your accounts.
Clear Your Suspense and Queries 
to Code Accounts
Throughout the year, you may have been unsure where to allocate a particular 
transaction as perhaps it was a little outside the ordinary — for example, maybe 
you purchased Christmas gifts for a few clients and you’re unsure if you can claim 
them as a business expense. When you encounter these transactions, it may be 
helpful to allocate them to your Suspense (or Queries to Code) account until you 
have more information (which you may need from your accountant to help you 
allocate these transactions correctly). In Chapter 6, I explain how to use Suspense 
and Queries to Code accounts; before you lodge your BAS, you also need to make 
sure you clear these accounts so you have no outstanding allocations.
To clear a Suspense or Queries to Code account:
1. Go to Banking → Find Transactions.
2. Go to the Find and Replace tab.
3. Filter the date range as required and select the All option for both the 
Source Journal and Tax Code fields.CHAPTER 20 Ten Essential Tasks When Preparing Your Business Activity Statement 453
4. Select the Account as your Suspense (or Queries to Code) account.
All the transactions that you’ve allocated to this account should now appear as 
a list in date order.
5. Work through the list of transactions to allocate them correctly, using 
the advice from your accountant (you may also prefer to ask your 
accountant to allocate these transactions for you).
If you simply need to reallocate the transaction to the correct account, check 
the box to the left of the transaction and then click the Replace button that 
appears at the top of the list. Select the correct Account and Tax Code for the 
transaction.
If you need to change more details in the transaction, click the purple 
Reference No in the transaction line, which opens the full transaction. Make 
the required changes and click Record when you’re done.
Changing the date or amount on a bank feed transaction may impact your 
bank reconciliation. Turn to Chapter 9 for more on avoiding reconciling errors.
Clear your Suspense and Queries to Code accounts regularly so you can remember 
what the transactions relate to, rather than leaving them for months and having 
a mad panic at the end of the year when you have no idea what the transaction was 
for. A monthly review is ideal, but aim for a minimum of reviewing this account 
every BAS cycle so you can also account for your GST correctly.
Reconcile Your Debtors and Creditors
This reconciliation is covered in depth in Chapter 18, where I explain why you 
should be reviewing your Exceptions Dashboard (found under the Reporting 
menu) to be sure you have a $0.00 out of balance amount. If you find anything 
other than zeroes, you need to rectify the issue; exceptions usually affect GST 
amounts, which in turn may lead to incorrect BAS reporting.
I also recommend checking that you have no outstanding customer or supplier 
credit notes waiting to be applied. (If you report GST on a cash basis, the GST on 
these credits won’t come into your reporting until you have applied the credit; for 
accruals basis reporting, the GST is reported as soon as you enter the credit.) Go 
to Sales → Customer Returns and Purchases → Supplier Returns to check for out￾standing credits.454 PART 5 The Part of Tens
Review Your General Ledger Report
A General Ledger report is a summary of all transactions entered into your MYOB 
file for a specified period of time, grouped by account code. It shows all transac￾tions, including spend money and receive money transactions, supplier bills, cus￾tomer invoices, payroll transactions and general journals. When preparing to 
lodge a BAS, this report allows you to check that all account allocations are correct.
I like to customise this report to help me review not only my account allocations, 
but my tax code allocations also. To view this information in the one report, here’s 
what to do:
1. Go to the Reporting → Reports.
2. Go to the Business tab and click General Ledger.
3. Adjust the Date fields to include this reporting period and the prior 
reporting period.
By reviewing both periods together, you can compare the current transactions 
against the previous period (which you trust is correct) so any errors will stand 
out more clearly.
4. Ensure All accounts are selected.
5. Check the selected Accounting Method matches your GST reporting basis.
For the purposes of checking your BAS, ensure the Accounting Method is set to 
Cash if you report for GST on a cash basis, or Accrual if you report for GST on 
an accrual basis.
6. Click the Customise button. From the Select Columns to Display drop￾down list (at the bottom), add Gross Amount ($) and Tax Code to the 
report and click Apply.
The Tax Amount ($) column is always added as a default.
To reorder the columns, click a column heading you want to move, grab the six 
dots to the left and drag the column into the order you wish it to appear, repeating 
as necessary until your column headings are listed in your desired column order.
Click on the ‘x’ to the right of any columns you wish to remove. (To help the 
report fit on one page and to focus on tax and account allocations, I tend to 
remove the Net Activity ($) and Open ($) columns.)
7. Click Expand All to review all transaction details and see the added columns.
8. Check all your transaction lines to ensure they’re correctly allocated to 
the correct account, that the correct tax code has been applied and that 
the tax amount is also correct (this is where the Gross Amount ($) column 
comes in handy).CHAPTER 20 Ten Essential Tasks When Preparing Your Business Activity Statement 455
9. If something isn’t quite right and you need to make changes, click the 
purple number in the Reference Number column (which will open the 
transaction details in a new browser window), make the required edits 
and click the green Save button.
Don’t change amounts or dates here or you could mess with your bank 
reconciliation (for more on this, refer to Chapter 9). Here, you are focusing on 
checking and adjusting (where necessary) the account allocations, tax codes 
and GST calculations. Note: The changes you make in the new browser window 
only take effect in the General Ledger report when you refresh the report page.
Once your customised report is as pretty as a peach, remember to click the Save As 
button in the top right to save the report so you don’t need to customise it again 
for the next period’s review.

Review Your GST Report
Looking at your GST figures overall (as a total per tax code) is a useful step when 
you’re preparing your BAS, even if you’ve already completed the General Ledger 
report review suggested in the preceding section.
The best report to use here is. . . wait for it. . . the GST report. This report shows 
all transactions (in the time period selected), categorised firstly by income or 
expenses and then based on the tax code for that transaction.
To review your GST figures using the GST report:
1. Go to Reporting → Reports.
2. Go to the Business tab and click GST Report.
3. Select your date range.
Either select from the pre-set Date Range drop-down list or adjust the Date 
From and Date To fields to capture the reporting period you are reviewing.
4. Ensure All Selected is showing for tax codes and All Selected is showing 
for Contacts.
Leave no stone unturned for this initial review!
5. Check the selected Accounting Method is correct.
Although you can change this setting every time you generate a GST report, 
I recommend you set this default via your Report Settings (under the 
Settings menu).
Not sure which method to select? The top-right corner of your Business Activity 
Statement specifies whether your GST Accounting Method is Cash or Accrual.
6. Select Expand All to review all your transaction details and check your 
transactions are sitting with the correct tax code.
You can also click Export to Excel or PDF if you feel a different display will give 
you a better viewing experience. This review process is similar to the review of 
the General Ledger report in the preceding section — think of it as a final check 
from a different perspective.
Refer to Chapter 16 on all things GST to understand how to use the totals in 
this report when you’re lodging your BAS form.CHAPTER 20 Ten Essential Tasks When Preparing Your Business Activity Statement 457
Reconcile Payroll and STP
I know you have been biting at the bit to get to this task because who doesn’t love 
reconciling payroll! When all the numbers align and everything’s matching, isn’t 
there a little part of you that does a happy dance because you nailed it? (No? Maybe 
it’s just me then.)
Payroll can be perplexing, so make your way through chapters 11 and 12 before you 
proceed here so you have a sound understanding of how payroll — and impor￾tantly, Single Touch Payroll (STP) — works.
In this section, I explain the checks and balances you should do as part of your BAS 
preparation. These are the two key areas to focus on when you want to check your 
payroll data is correct and get ready to report on your BAS:
» Is the balance of your payroll (or electronic) clearing account $0.00 as at 
the last day of the BAS reporting period? You can check this account 
balance as part of reviewing your General Ledger report (as discussed in the 
earlier section ‘Review Your General Ledger Report’). Chapter 12 explains how 
to set your employees’ payment method to a payroll (or electronic) clearing 
account and why I recommend you do so.
» Does your Payroll Summary report (which you access via Reporting →
Payroll) match the STP finalisation verification report (which you access 
via Payroll → Single Touch Payroll Reporting → Finalisation)? This check 
(always at YTD) confirms that all payroll data is being reported correctly for 
STP to the ATO.
Chapter 12 talks more about reconciling your Payroll and STP and the 
importance of doing so with each BAS.
» Does your Payroll Activity report match with the totals of W1 and W2 on 
your BAS? In the Summary view, the first column of this report shows the 
Total Salary and wages amount to report in section W1; the Taxes column 
total is the amount to report in section W2.
Chapter 16 talks more about what is reportable at each payroll label for your 
BAS as sometimes your payroll reports may hold particular pay items (such as 
salary sacrifice amounts) that should not be reported at W1 (as one example).
Great — now you have your payroll figures ready to report on your BAS!458 PART 5 The Part of Tens
Reconcile All Your Bank Accounts
Some people may suggest you reconcile your bank accounts as the first step in 
preparing your BAS. However, I feel it is more helpful to reconcile your accounts 
after you have reviewed your transactions. Why? Because once your transactions 
are reconciled, MYOB prevents you from making certain changes to avoid poten￾tial issues with your bank reconciliation. Things can get a little tricky if you need 
to make edits or changes after you have reconciled your bank accounts.
If you need a refresher on the process of reconciling your accounts, head to 
Chapter 9.
Apart from reconciling obvious accounts such as your business bank account, 
make sure you also reconcile your credit card accounts and any loan accounts.
I also suggest you reconcile your clearing accounts, such as any undeposited funds 
and electronic clearing accounts, to be sure they also show a $0.00 balance (this 
does not need to be a hard reconcile of the accounts in the reconcile window; 
instead, it may simply be a balance check of these accounts as something you do 
while reviewing your General Ledger report — refer to the earlier section ‘Review 
Your General Ledger Report’).
Check for Prior Period BAS Adjustments
After you’ve checked all your current BAS period data is spot on, you need to 
ensure that no-one has accidentally made changes to any transactions from prior 
BAS periods (within the financial year) that you’ve already lodged.
Chapter 16 explains in detail how to identify any changes made in your file after 
the date you last lodged your BAS so you can take action as required — either by 
making an adjustment in your next BAS or creating a BAS revision for a prior 
period.
Lock Your Data
When all your data has all been reconciled and checked, it’s time to lock the data 
so no-one can make changes to your brilliant work. To do so, go to your Settings 
and select Business Settings from the drop-down menu. Scroll to the very bottom CHAPTER 20 Ten Essential Tasks When Preparing Your Business Activity Statement 459
of the Business Settings page and you will find your Lock Date. Simply enter the 
last date of your BAS period and tick the Prevent Changes Prior to the Lock Date 
checkbox, and click the green Save button when you’re done.
You may wonder what the purpose of setting a lock date is, especially given that 
anyone with the Administrator User role can remove or change this date. Person￾ally, I find that the lock date warning acts as a helpful reminder that any changes 
I make to prior periods may impact activity statements that I’ve already lodged. 
The warning forces me to think about what impact my changes may have, partic￾ularly at year end.
Lodge Your BAS
When everything is spot on, you’re ready to lodge your BAS — yay! If you are 
lodging it yourself, you can do so easily directly from within your MYOB file, 
where the BAS values will be prefilled for you (go to Accounting → Prepare BAS or 
IAS). Chapter 16 guides you through setting this up in MYOB and mapping your 
tax codes correctly so you can lodge your BAS from directly within your file. 
(Alternatively, you can lodge your BAS through your myGov account if you’re con￾nected to the ATO.)
If your bookkeeper or accountant lodges your BAS on your behalf, let them 
know about the great work you’ve done and that your BAS is now ready for them 
to lodge.
You definitely deserve a nice treat after all this hard work, so make time for you 
and enjoy a walk along the beach, take the dog down the park and listen to some 
great music, spend time with the family, or settle in for a meditation session.
Enjoy the moment! Meditation and mindfulness are the ideal unwind after such 
big efforts. MYOB has partnered with Smiling Mind to develop its Small Business 
Program. Designed to support the mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of 
business owners via the Smiling Mind app, you can access lots of different activi￾ties and find the ones that are most beneficial to you. Go to myob.com/au/comms/

of this great resource to help look after yourself and, in turn, your business!Index 461

Sonya Prosper is a teacher at heart and she is fuelled by her passion for helping 
others reach their potential and realise their dreams. Her career, which began 
with teaching high school kids maths, now sees her helping adults of all ages with 
running small businesses. Her insights as a business owner and bookkeeper over 
the years have shown her how important understanding a business’s financials 
are (assuming they are all correct, of course!) to truly help a business succeed and 
achieve.
This passion is what brought Sonya to MYOB, where she gets to share her knowl￾edge and mastery with accountants and bookkeepers so they can help their hun￾dreds of small business clients leverage the power of MYOB to drive their 
prosperity, efficiency and profit.
Sonya believes in the power of knowledge. She witnesses its impact every day as 
she helps people acquire new skills and understanding in pursuit of their business 
goals. Feel free to send Sonya a message or a question about this book via her 
website at prosperinbusiness.com.au.
