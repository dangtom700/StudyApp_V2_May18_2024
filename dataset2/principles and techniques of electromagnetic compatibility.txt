Principles and Techniques of 
Electromagnetic Compatibility
This book provides a sound grasp of the fundamental concepts, applications, and practice of EMC. 
Developments in recent years have resulted in further increases in electrical component density, 
wider penetration of wireless technologies, and a significant increase in complexity of electrical and 
electronic equipment. New materials, which can be customized to meet EMC needs, have been intro￾duced. Considerable progress has been made in developing numerical tools for complete system EMC 
simulation. EMC is now a central consideration in all industrial sectors. Maintaining the holistic 
approach of the previous edition of Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility, 
the Third Edition updates coverage of EMC to reflect recent important developments.
What is new in the Third Edition?
• A comprehensive treatment of new materials (meta- and nano-) and their impact on EMC
• Numerical modeling of complex systems and complexity reduction methods
• Impact of wireless technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) on EMC
• Testing in reverberation chambers, and in the time domain
• A comprehensive treatment of the scope and development of stochastic models for EMC
• EMC issues encountered in automotive, railway, aerospace, and marine applications
• Impact of EMC and intentional EMI (IEMI) on infrastructure, and risk assessment
In addition to updating material, new references, examples, and appendices were added to offer 
further support to readers interested in exploring further. As in previous editions, the emphasis is 
on building a sound theoretical framework and demonstrating how it can be turned to practical use 
in challenging applications. The expectation is that this approach will serve EMC engineers through 
the inevitable future technological shifts and developments.Electronic Engineering Systems

Preface to the Third Edition
In preparing the Third Edition of this text, I have taken the opportunity to update material and 
develop topics that were only touched upon in the last edition. The same style of presentation, 
routed in fundamentals, is maintained with examples of how theoretical ideas and models may be 
brought to practical use.
I have added material on numerical modeling as it is increasingly central to design for EMC 
(Section 8.7) and the interplay of EMC with safety and risk management (throughout the text and in 
Section 9.4). Novel materials, meta- and nano-, are covered in more detail in Section 10.4. Section 
14.3.4 on reverberation chambers has been added, to reflect the increasing importance of this medium 
for EMC testing. As we attempt to understand and model complete systems, the issue of complex￾ity looms large and approaches to dealing with it are presented in Section 15.3. The penetration of 
wireless communications in all aspects of life, and the introduction of the IoT require a study of their 
impact on EMC (see Sections 16.4–16.7). Uncertainty is inherent in all aspects of life, and its study 
and quantification are crucially important to EMC. I have added Sections 19.4 and 19.5 to cover this 
important topic. Finally, I have added a new Chapter 20, to highlight some of the EMC specifics 
encountered in automotive, railway, aerospace, and marine applications. The text concludes with a 
forward look at EMC in as much as this is possible (Chapter 21).
As before, I express my appreciation to colleagues and fellow researchers worldwide who have con￾tributed to my understanding of EMC. The extensive list of references is a measure of the contributions 
of so many to the advancement of EMC studies.

Preface to the Second Edition
In preparing the second edition of this book I have adhered to the same principles as in the first 
edition, namely, to present the topic of EMC to a wide range of readers and enable as many of them 
as possible to benefit from the experience and the work of others. A practical approach is adopted 
whenever appropriate but mathematical analysis and numerical techniques are also presented in 
connection with the development of EMC predictive tools. I have tried to present the physical basis 
and analytical models of important interactions in EMC and whenever the mathematical framework 
became too complex I have guided the interested reader to relevant references. Readers therefore 
will be able to study the material at a depth appropriate to their skills and interests.
The main thrust of the new edition was to update material, extend the treatment of some topics 
that are not covered adequately in the first edition, introduce new topics that ten years ago had not 
emerged as important in EMC, and add more worked examples. Part V is entirely new and covers 
new and emerging technologies that are having a major impact in EMC theory and practice.
Again, I gratefully acknowledge the support and friendship over the years of professional 
colleagues at Nottingham and elsewhere.

Preface
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) may be approached from two standpoints. In the first 
approach, one is tempted to address the problem in its generality and seek the development of 
general tools to predict performance. The complexity of the problem is such that it is not at present 
possible to make decisive progress along this route and one is left with a collection of mathematical 
treatises of limited immediate applicability. It is also generally the case that a physical grasp of the 
problem cannot be easily attained in this way, since mathematical complexity dominates all.
An alternative approach is to view EMC from the multiplicity of practical problems that confront 
designers on a day-to-day basis. The general appearance of such work is a collection of “EMC reci￾pes and fixes” based on a mixture of theoretical ideas, practical experience, and black magic, which 
no doubt work under certain circumstances. The student of such works is left, however, without a 
clear physical grasp of exactly what is happening or an understanding of the range of validity of the 
formulae he or she is supplied with.
The current text adopts a different viewpoint. Emphasis is placed on understanding the relevant 
electromagnetic interactions in increasingly complex systems. Mathematical tools are introduced as 
and when pursuing the physical picture unaided becomes counterproductive.
Approximations and intuitive ideas are also included, and an effort is made to define the limitations 
of each approach. As the reader becomes aware of the physics of EMC interactions and has some math￾ematical tools at his or her disposal, then the manner in which systems can be engineered to achieve 
EMC is described and illustrated with practical examples. Many readers will find that the confidence 
felt when they become familiar with the physical, mathematical, and engineering aspects of EMC is not 
sufficient to predict the performance of complex systems. In order to handle complexity, numerical tools 
are developed and the basis and capabilities of these tools are presented. It is hoped that the text will 
provide useful source material for a serious study of EMC, including references to more advanced work.
The text aims to be comprehensive, although, in a topic of such a wide coverage as EMC, it is 
difficult to make a selection of material to be included that will appeal to all readers. The text will 
be useful to all those engaged in EMC analysis and design either as advanced undergraduates, 
postgraduates, or EMC engineers in industry. The author is, by training and temperament, inclined 
to take a global view of problems and he hopes that readers will choose to study the entire book at 
a pace that reflects their own background and interests. However, as guidance for those who may 
require a selection of topics for a first reading, the following two schemes are suggested:
i. EMC applications-oriented readers — Chapter 1, Sections 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 4.4; Chapter 5; and all 
material in Parts III and IV.
ii. EMC analysis-oriented readers — All material in Parts I and II and Chapter 13.
Part I contains material underlying all work in electrical and electronic engineering and it is thus 
also relevant to EMC. Readers with a degree in electrical engineering will be familiar with a large 
part of this material. Part II deals with general EMC concepts and techniques and it is thus useful 
to those engaged in predicting the EMC behavior of systems. More practical techniques used to 
control electromagnetic interference and the design of EMC into products are presented in Part III. 
Finally, the main EMC standards and test techniques are described in Part IV.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the help and support I have received over the years from co￾workers at Nottingham University and other higher educational establishments and from those in

Underlying Concepts and Techniques
Any serious study of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requires a reasonable background in 
several areas of electrical engineering. In a topic such as EMC, where the complexity of practical prob￾lems is very considerable, it is not always possible to provide complete and accurate answers based on 
comprehensive quantitative models. In such cases it is imperative that a basic underlying grasp of the 
nature of electrical components, their interactions through electromagnetic fields, and the nature and 
characterization of electrical signals is firmly established. Such a foundation provides the analyst and 
EMC designer with the basic conceptual framework and tools for asking the right questions, for criti￾cally evaluating results and assumptions, and for supporting the intuitive search for solutions based 
on sound scientific understanding. Even those who are not comfortable with mathematical models of 
physical systems and processes will benefit greatly from studying Part I, which is a distillation of the 
techniques most relevant to the study of EMC phenomena. Those already familiar with fields circuits 
and signals may also wish to study Part I, since it presents these topics from an EMC perspective.
The aim of the next four chapters is to provide background material on the nature and impor￾tance of EMC, the concept of electromagnetic fields, the description of real components in terms of 
ideal components, and the relationship between field and network concepts. Finally, the modeling 
and analysis of signals and circuits in the frequency and time domains will be described.

1 Introduction to Electromagnetic 
Compatibility
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the branch of science and engineering concerned with the 
design and operation of equipment in a manner that makes them immune to certain amounts of elec￾tromagnetic interference, while at the same time keeping equipment-generated interference within 
specified limits. The scope of EMC is thus very wide as it encompasses virtually all equipment 
powered by electrical supplies. Practically, all engineering systems incorporate power conditioning 
and information processing units and thus fall within the scope of EMC. The frequency range of 
interest extends from DC to light and in certain parts of this spectrum a strict international regula￾tory framework has been set up to ensure immunity of equipment to electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) and to control emission.
Interest in EMC is not new. Since the early days of radio, designers and listeners alike were 
alerted to noise, interference, and earthing problems. However, the rapid increase in the use of radio 
communications, digital systems, fast processors, and the introduction of new design practices have 
brought EMC to the forefront of advanced design. Three technological trends have provided the 
impetus for these changes. First, modern digital logic and signal processing are based on relatively 
low-threshold voltages (i.e., a few volts) compared to older technologies based on electronic valves 
(several hundred volts). The immunity of modern systems is therefore inherently lower. Second, 
in the process of seeking higher processing speeds, shorter pulse rise-times are used, contributing 
significant amounts of energy at high frequencies, which is capable of propagating by radiative 
mechanisms over long distances. Third, the modern physical design of equipment is based increas￾ingly on the use of plastics in preference to metals. This significantly reduces the electromagnetic 
shielding inherent to an all-metal cabinet. Several other items could be added to this list, such as 
miniaturization and thus the trend for compact designs, which contribute to EMC problems. Close 
attention must thus be paid to EMC at all stages of design if equipment is to function properly and 
meet international EMC regulations.
EMC may be approached from two different directions. First, it may be argued that before any￾thing is designed, a complete EMC study must be performed to predict the electromagnetic signa￾ture of equipment and its capacity to withstand externally generated interference. The difficulties 
in performing such a study are formidable, since many of the necessary predictive analytical and 
numerical tools are not currently available and the environment in which equipment is installed is 
not always fully specified. Second, it may be thought that EMC is essentially a fire-righting opera￾tion and that any problems that may arise in this area are best dealt with on an ad hoc basis. The 
dangers of this approach are obvious, since the complexity of modern designs and the nature of 
EMC preclude easy and inexpensive solutions as an afterthought. A balanced approach to EMC 
is to bring into this area every tool available to the designer. This includes numerical tools, in￾house practical experience, and sound physical grasp of EMC and electromagnetic interactions. No 
single individual will be gifted in all these areas and it is thus important to establish teams with 
the right blend of experience and approach to problem solving to form the focus for EMC design. 
Several years of emphasis in engineering education on digital design have reduced the grasp of 
radio frequency (RF) design issues among graduates to dangerously low levels and it is therefore of 
considerable importance to strengthen awareness of EMC and the grasp of fundamental RF design 
techniques in academia and in industry.
EMC must be regarded as an issue that affects all aspects of design — electrical, electronic, 
and mechanical. It cannot be adequately addressed in isolation. Typically, a complete design may 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-24 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
consist of a number of subsystems that interact with each other through signal and power cables 
and through reactive (capacitive and/or inductive) or radiative mechanisms. The EMC behavior of 
a complete system cannot be easily predicted from the known behavior of subsystems, although the 
purpose of current EMC research is to develop the necessary methodologies and tools to achieve 
this. The difficulties are more pronounced in large extensive systems where a mixture of new and 
old technologies is used in the presence of severe external electromagnetic (EM) threats. Clearly, 
the designer will make every effort to solve EMC problems within a piece of equipment caused by 
interactions between various subsystems. Nevertheless, the majority of EMC problems seem to be 
internally generated. In an integrated system in which a number of different types of equipment, 
often provided by different suppliers, are connected together, EMC problems may develop and they 
can be difficult to tackle if each unit does not meet specified EMC limits and if insufficient thought 
has been given to system-level EM interactions.
A designer who has developed a system that operates successfully as far as internally generated 
electromagnetic interference (EMI) is concerned, has nevertheless to meet, in addition, certain 
EMC limits specified in national and international standards. Compliance with these limits can be 
demonstrated by making a number of measurements under specified conditions. In a typical case, 
these tests will cover emission of EMI from equipment and also the susceptibility or immunity of 
this equipment to externally generated interference. In an emission test the equipment is placed, 
depending on the particular standard, inside a screened room or on an open-field site and measure￾ments are taken of the emitted electromagnetic fields at a specified distance using receivers of speci￾fied bandwidth over a specified frequency range. The type and polarization of antennas used is also 
specified to produce, as far as possible, a repeatable measurement. This type of test is called a radi￾ated emission test, to distinguish it from conducted emission tests where the EMI voltage on con￾ductors is measured. In each case, the measured quantity must be below specified limits. A selection 
of such limits and a more detailed description of test procedures are given in Chapters 13 and 14.
In immunity testing, the equipment is subject to a specified externally generated field or to inter￾ference currents injected on conductors and the requirement is that the equipment remains func￾tional. These tests may cover a wide frequency range (typically at least up to 1GHz) and may also 
involve pulse-like incident electromagnetic signals to check the response of equipment to transients 
and electrostatic discharges. For complex equipment with a large number of operating modes it can 
be difficult to demonstrate immunity.
The designer is obliged to ascertain the nature and significance of EM emissions from different 
parts of the equipment and the effects of externally generated interference on the functional integ￾rity of an entire system. He or she may, as far as possible, seek to minimize interference generation 
at its source; reduce or eliminate coupling paths by proper layout, shielding, filtering, and grounding 
practices; design hardware with an inherent immunity to EMI; and adopt defensive programming 
practices to develop software that has a high level of immunity to EMI. Very few of these options 
are cost free and many may have adverse effects on normal operating characteristics, size, appear￾ance, and weight of equipment. It is not an easy matter to seek optimum solutions to such design 
problems, which depend on so many interdependent parameters. The purpose of research into EMC 
is to develop the methodologies and tools that allow optimum EMC design procedures to be incor￾porated into the design process from the very beginning, so that, even at the conceptual stage of 
a design, EMC issues are taken into account and sensible choices are made with minimum costs.
A glance at the titles of the chapters that follow will convince the reader of the complexity and 
importance of EMC and of its position at the forefront of teaching and research in advanced system 
design techniques.5
2 Electromagnetic Fields
The purpose of this chapter is to restate in broad terms the basic premises of electromagnetic theory, 
and to establish the fundamental concepts and models of electromagnetic phenomena as applied to 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). It is not intended to give a complete coverage of the topic as 
this would occupy most of the book. There are many excellent texts on electromagnetics to which 
the reader may refer.1–4 The topic is also taken up at a level accessible to first-year university students 
in my own Introduction to Applied Electromagnetism (Wiley, 1990).5
No secure understanding of EMC may be attained without at least a physical grasp of what elec￾tromagnetics is. The analytical equipment normally associated with the subject is also necessary, if 
basic understanding is to be followed by the ability to make quantitative predictions of EMC per￾formance. This remains so even when numerical predictive simulation packages are used in EMC 
studies. In the author’s opinion, there is no substitute for a core understanding of electromagnetics. 
It is therefore proper to devote this chapter to this important topic. It is convenient to examine elec￾tromagnetic phenomena under three broadly distinct categories.
First, there are problems where charges are static or they move with constant speed (e.g., direct 
currents). This type of problem is encountered in DC and low-frequency applications, and the fun￾damental properties of the field in this limit are that its two aspects, electric and magnetic, can be 
dealt with separately. Coupling between electric and magnetic field is weak, and it is possible to 
develop simple models to examine each separately.
Second, there are problems where charges accelerate slowly, so that although coupling between 
electric and magnetic fields cannot be ignored, certain simplifying assumptions can be made in 
interpreting what is taking place.
Finally, in cases where charges accelerate rapidly, no approximations can be made and the most 
general field models must be employed to account for the strong coupling between electric and 
magnetic fields.
The first two categories are referred to as the static and quasistatic approximations. The task of 
this chapter is to outline the essential physics applicable in each category, to sketch out the basic 
models used in making quantitative predictions, and, most importantly, to establish the limits of 
applicability of each model. In this process the notation, units, and some useful formulae will be 
given to assist in the more specialized treatment that follows in other chapters.
2.1 STATIC FIELDS
2.1.1 Electric Field
Static electric charges set up an influence around them, which is described as an electric field.
At each point in space, an electric field value is assigned, referred to as the electric field intensity, 
E, measured in volts per meter (V/m). The amplitude of the electric field does not, however, describe 
completely the influence of the electric charges. It is also necessary to assign a direction to the 
field at each point, much like in a weather map where at each point wind speed and direction are 
required. In mathematical jargon, the electric field is a vector quantity E described fully when its 
amplitude and direction are given. The direction of E at each point is that in which a positive electric 
charge placed there would move. The electric field E(r) a distance r away from a point charge q 
placed in vacuum (or approximately air) is given by the formula
E r q
4π 0  r2 ( ) = ε
(2.1)
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-36 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
where if q is in coulombs, r is in meters, and ε0 is a constant. The electric permittivity of free￾space is ε0=8.8542 pF/m and then the electric field is obtained in V/m. By the term “point charge” 
is meant a charge distribution occupying dimensions small compared to r and possessing spheri￾cal symmetry so as to look virtually like a charge concentrated at a point a distance r away from 
the point where the field is observed. The direction of the field is radially outward from a positive 
charge, as shown in Figure 2.1.
If the charge distribution does not meet the above criteria, then Equation 2.1 cannot be used 
directly. Instead the charge is divided into small volume elements dV, each containing a charge ρdV 
where ρ is the charge density. Then, since dV is infinitesimally small, charge ρdV is effectively a 
point charge and Equation 2.1 applies. The field at any point can then be found by superposition, i.e., 
by combining the electric field due to each volume element until all the charges have been accounted 
for. The individual electric field contributions must be combined as vectors to find the total field.
In cases where the surrounding medium is not air but another material, then Equation 2.1 still 
applies but ε0 is replaced by ε, the dielectric permittivity of the material used. Materials are nor￾mally characterized by their relative dielectric permittivity or dielectric constant εr
 where ε=εr ε0. 
In most, but not all, materials, εr
 is constant and independent of the local value of the electric field 
or other parameters such as temperature or humidity. The range of εr
 values is remarkably restricted. 
For most insulating liquids it has a value approximately equal to 3 and in most insulating solids it is 
equal to about 5. Notable exceptions are water (εr ≃ 80) and various titanates (εr ≃ 10,000).
If different materials surround electric charges, the determination of the field is more compli￾cated, as will be explained shortly. It is also customary to use another quantity to offer an alternative 
description of the field. This is a vector quantity known as the electric flux density D measured in 
coulombs per m2 (C/m2
). In most, but not all, materials, D is parallel to E. The relationship between 
the two is
D E = εr 0 ε (2.2)
It is possible to relate, in a compact and elegant way, the electric field (D or E) to its sources (electric 
charges). This relationship is expressed by Gauss’s Law, which states that if, on any closed surface S, 
the product is formed on the surface area of a small patch ds and the component of the flux density 
normal to it Dn, and all the contributions are summed to account for the entire closed surface, then 
the total sum found is equal to the total charge enclosed by S.
In mathematical form this law is expressed as
D ds Q s
n  tot ∫ = (2.3)
where the S in the integral sign indicates integration over the closed surface S, and Qtot is the charge 
enclosed by S. If this charge is distributed in some way (electric charge density ρ) then
FIGURE 2.1 The electric field at a point in the proximity of a spherical charge distribution.EM Fields 7
Q d tot v ∫ v
= ρ (2.4)
where V is the volume enclosed by S.
Term Dn ds may be expressed as a dot product D ds, where ds is a vector of magnitude ds and 
pointing outward of the volume enclosed by S. Hence, Gauss’s Law in its most general form is
 d dv ∫ ∫ s
D s = ρv
(2.5)
Example: Calculate the electric field at a distance r away from a long cylindrical conductor on 
which a charge q coulombs per meter length is distributed uniformly.
Solution: A surface S is chosen, as shown in Figure 2.2, on which to apply Gauss’s Law. The choice 
is arbitrary, but a choice that is in tune with the symmetry of the problem, in this case a cylinder, 
makes the difference between stating the law and obtaining useful results. The symmetry of the 
problem demands a radial electric field, hence along the flat ends of S the field is parallel to the 
surface elements and there is zero contribution to the left-hand side of Equation 2.3 or 2.5.
The curved part of S contributes and thus
2πrlD r( ) = ql
Hence

2πr ( ) =
Accordingly

Gauss’s Law expressed by Equation 2.5 is an example of an integral law. It relates quantities over 
surfaces and volumes of the problem. Although useful in problems with symmetry and uniform 
materials, it becomes cumbersome in other more general configurations. It is then necessary to 
examine the form this law takes when the surface S is reduced until it collapses into a point. If both 
sides of Equation 2.5 are divided by the volume and the volume is allowed to tend to zero, then 
the left- hand side of the equation expresses the electric flux per unit volume and the right-hand 
FIGURE 2.2 Configuration of a coaxial capacitor.8 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
side tends to the charge density. The electric flux per unit volume is a quantity known in math￾ematics as the divergence of the flux density and is designated as div D. Gauss’s Law in point or 
differential form is thus
div D = ρ (2.6)

where Dx, Dy, and Dz are the components of D, and ∂ ∂/ x indicates a derivative with respect 
to x only. The divergence of a vector is thus a scalar quantity fully described by its amplitude. 
A detailed treatment of this type of relationship may be found in Reference 6.
Expressions for the divergence in other coordinate systems may be found in Appendix A. 
Equations 2.5 and 2.6 are equivalent descriptions of the same physical law.
It has been shown how either E or D may be used to describe the electric field. It is sometimes 
easier, from the calculation point of view, to use a quantity that is not a vector. Such a quantity 
is the electric potential. At each point in space a potential value is assigned. This is a scalar 
quantity — there is no direction associated with it. The work done to move a test charge q from 
point a to point b is q[V(b)−V(a)] where V(a) and V(b) are the potential values at points a and b, 
respectively. Potentials are always defined with respect to some reference. The potential at a point 
a distance r away from a point charge q is
V r q

The potential due to a distribution of charge occupying volume V is
V r dv ∫ v 4π  R ( ) ρ

(2.8)
where ρ is the volume charge density, and R is the distance between the volume element and 
the observation point at r. The electric field distribution and the potential difference between two 
points a and b are related by the expression

 indicates the component of the electric field that at each point is parallel (tangent) to a 
small line segment of length dl on a curve joining points a and b.
Equation 2.9 suggests that the potential difference is the same irrespective of which precise 
path is chosen to go from a to b. It also follows that if a closed path is followed, the potential 
difference will be zero. These conclusions are strictly correct for the static field case considered 
here. They have to be revised when quasistatic and general fields are present. The general form 
of Equation 2.9 to include nonstatic fields is considered in Section 2.2. The electric field may be 
obtained if the potential is known. It turns out that

This is known as Poisson’s equation and its solution is given by Equation 2.8. When ρ=0, 
Equation 2.10 is referred to as Laplace’s equation.
At the interface between two different ideal dielectrics, the electric field values on either side 
are interrelated. Application of Gauss’s Law and Equation 2.9 on a closed path gives the following 
expressions:

Simply stated, the component of the electric field tangent to the interface is continuous. Similarly, 
the flux density component normal to the interface is continuous.
If a battery of voltage V is connected across two conductors, an amount of charge q is trans￾ferred from one conductor to the other, thus creating a deficit of electrons in one conductor 
(charge +q) and a surplus in the other conductor (charge −q). The potential difference V, and the 
charge q, are related by the capacitance C between the two conductors
C q ≡ / V (2.12)
Whenever charge separation and potential differences are present in a system of conductors, 
electric fields are also present and some capacitance may be associated with the conductors. The 
procedure for calculating capacitance is straightforward, but it can only be carried out analytically 
in a few simple cases. In general terms, in order to calculate capacitance, the following steps are 
taken:
1. Charges ±q are assumed to be distributed on each conductor forming the two plates of 
the capacitor. Any symmetries are exploited to simplify further calculation.
2. The electric field E between the conductors is obtained using Gauss’s Law or any other 
suitable procedure. The field is only required on points lying on a curve c joining the two 
conductors.
3. The potential difference between the conductors is then obtained from V=∫c Edl, where 
the curve c is chosen with care to simplify the calculation.
4. The capacitance is then C ≡ q/V.
In this procedure, it is implicity assumed that the potential V has the same value irrespective of 
the path c chosen to evaluate it. Otherwise, a different capacitance would be found depending 
on the path chosen. As stated earlier, this assumption is true in static fields. However, in rapidly 
varying fields this cannot be guaranteed, and it is not possible to define a unique value for V 10 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
(indeed voltages are strongly dependent on the path chosen). In such cases there are conceptual 
and practical difficulties in defining and calculating capacitance.
A simple example is given below to illustrate the procedure for calculating capacitance.
Example: Calculate the capacitance between two long coaxial cylinders of inner and outer radii 
r1 and r2, respectively.
Solution: Step (1), a charge q1 is assumed distributed uniformly per meter length of the surface of 
the inner conductor. From charge conservation, the charge per unit length on the outer conduc￾tor is −q1. The assumption of uniform distribution is justified by the cylindrical symmetry of the 
problem.
Step (2), the electric field in the space between the two conductors may be calculated using 
Gauss’s Law, in exactly the same way as for the case shown in Figure 2.2. It follows that
E r q
2π r
 r r r 1 ( ) = 1 2 ε
≤ ≤
Elsewhere, the electric field is zero.
Step (3), the potential difference is calculated by choosing a radial path from the inner to the 
outer conductor. Along this path, E is always tangent to it, and hence

Step (4), the capacitance per unit length is

If the coaxial conductors are of length l then the total capacitance is C=C1 ×l.
Remarks— The formula given above does not take into account the distortion to the field near 
the edge of the conductors. In most cases, such secondary considerations are not significant but 
they may be important in cases, for instance, when r2/1 is large. The capacitance depends on the 
logarithm of the ratio of outer to inner radii. Hence, it is not a very strong function of these dimen￾sions. Equation 2.13 may be used to estimate capacitance even in cases where there is uncertainty 
about exact dimensions or when the conductors are not strictly cylindrical.
Formulae for the capacitance of some common geometries are given in Appendix B.
The separation of electric charges and the associated electric field is a store of energy that may 
be calculated directly from the formula
W q
2C

2 e CV , in Joule

2 = = (2.14)
This energy may be viewed, for illustrative purposes, as a form of potential energy found in 
mechanics. The capacitance is thus a measure of this energy. An alternative way to view this 
energy is to associate it directly with the electric field rather than the charges. It turns out that in a 
part of space where the electric field is E, the energy stored per unit volume is
W 1
2 e  E , in J/m 2 3 = ε (2.15)
If the total energy stored in the field is calculated by applying Equation 2.15 and all contributions 
are summed together to account for the entire volume occupied by the field, it is found that it 
equals that given by Equation 2.14. Thus, these two expressions are equivalent descriptions of the 
same thing. Equation 2.14 represents the circuit and Equation 2.15 the field point of view. Which 
formula is used depends on convenience and the nature of the problem.EM Fields 11
A powerful tool in understanding electric fields and interactions is to draw on paper or on a 
computer screen the appearance of the field around charged conductors. Visualization removes 
from the field some of its abstract nature, and aids human reasoning and problem solving.
An obvious technique would be to draw at each point in space an arrow representing the 
vector of the field E, with a length proportional to the magnitude of the field and the same direc￾tion as E. This approach is adopted by some computer graphics packages, but it is not the best 
one. A very elegant approach is to plot the field and equipotential lines. Field lines are defined 
so that they coincide with the direction in which a positive charge would move if placed in the 
field. They are thus tangent at each point to the direction of the field. They start from positive 
and terminate in negative charges. This brings out a cardinal feature of the electric field, which 
is important in EMC work as it helps to identify coupling paths. Electric field lines are shown 
in Figure 2.3. In such plots a line is shown starting from a conductor for each unit of charge. 
For example, if a conductor has a total charge of 6 μC and it is decided to plot one line per μC, 
then, if the charge is distributed uniformly on the conductor, six lines will be shown leaving the 
conductor from points centered on six equal conductor areas, each containing 1 μC of charge. 
If the charge distribution is not uniform, the same principle applies, but the areas containing 
1 μC of charge are unequal in extent, and thus more lines leave from parts of the conduc￾tor where charge concentration, and hence the electric field, is stronger. More lines crowded 
together indicate a strong field. The field lines always impinge on perfect conductors at right 
angles. In the same diagram, lines of constant potential are drawn (equipotentials). These lines 
are orthogonal to the field lines and are plotted for fixed potential increments. Hence, in areas 
of steep potential change, and hence high electric field, more equipotential lines are plotted, as 
shown schematically in Figure 2.3.
In EMC applications it is common to express electric field values in decibels with respect to 
some reference. As an illustration, an electric field E expressed in dB μV/m is the value found by 
calculating

where E is in units of V/m.
An electric field equal to 10V/m may thus be expressed as 140dB μV/m.

2.1.2 Magnetic Field
Treatment so far has been limited to the effects of stationary electric charges. When electric charges 
are moving with constant velocity to produce an electric current, an additional influence is set up that 
is described as a magnetic field. At each point in space a magnetic field value is assigned, referred to 
as the magnetic flux density B, measured in teslas (T) or, equivalently, in Wb/m2. The magnetic flux 
density is a vector quantity requiring, in a full description, both an amplitude and a direction. Its value 
at a distance r away from a long straight conductor placed in air and carrying current I is
B r I
2πr
0 ( ) = µ (2.16)
where μ0=4π 10−7A/m and is the magnetic permeability of vacuum or approximately air. The direc￾tion of B is perpendicular to the plane formed by the conductor and the observation point and is 
fully determined by the right-hand rule. If the conductor is grasped with the right-hand, with the 
thumb pointing in the direction of the current, then the fingers show the magnetic field direction. 
Another quantity often used to describe the magnetic field is the magnetic field intensity H mea￾sured in A/m. In most, but not all, materials B and H are parallel and are related by the expression
B =µ =µ H H r 0 µ (2.17)
where μr
 is the relative permeability of the medium and is a material constant. Most materials have 
a μr
 of the order of 1 with the exception of ferromagnetic materials, where values approaching a 
few hundred are common. Some materials, such as mumetal, have values of μr
 exceeding several 
thousands. The fundamental expression, known as Ampere’s Law, relating the magnetic field to its 
sources (currents), states that if the component of the magnetic field intensity Ht
 parallel (tangent) at 
a point on a curve c is multiplied by the length of a small element of the curve around this point, and 
if all such contributions are summed together to cover the entire closed curve, then the total sum is 
equal to the current linked with this curve:
H  dl I c
t tot ∫ = (2.18)
The current Itot may best be identified by calculating the current emerging from a surface S bounded 
by the curve c, as shown in Figure 2.4. Equation 2.18 may then be written in a more general form as
 d d ∫ ∫ c s
H l = j s (2.19)
FIGURE 2.4 Configuration used to apply Ampere’s Law.EM Fields 13
This is the well-known Ampere’s Law. It can be used to calculate the field very easily in cases 
where the problem has some symmetry. In static fields, the current linked is that due to conductors 
(conduction current). However, at high frequencies other terms, in addition to conduction currents, 
must be included in the right-hand side (displacement currents). This generalization is discussed 
further on in this chapter (see Equation 2.32). Equation 2.19 is an example of an integral law, as it 
involves a relationship between quantities evaluated over a finite area. It is useful to determine the 
form of Ampere’s Law as the curve c and the associated area S are reduced in size to the extent 
that in the limit, they collapse to a point. Both sides of Equation 2.19 are divided by the surface 
area S and the limit is taken as the area tends to zero. The resulting expression on the left-hand 
side is well known in mathematics and it is called the curl of the vector H or ∇×H. The expression 
on the right-hand side reduces simply to the current density. Ampere’s Law in differential or point 
form is then

In configurations containing different magnetic materials, the magnetic field on either side of an

(Equation 2.11).

In obtaining the first of these two expressions, it was assumed that no current flows at the interface.
Whenever a current I flows in a system of conductors, it establishes a magnetic flux ϕ. These two 
quantities are related by a parameter known as the inductance L of the conductors.
L ≡ φ / I (2.23)
Current flow and an associated field indicate that an inductance may be assigned to the conductors.
The inductance may be calculated by following the procedure outlined below:
1. Current ±I is assumed flowing in the pair of conductors. Any symmetries are identified 
since they simplify subsequent calculations.
2. The flux density B around the conductors is calculated using Ampere’s Law or any other 
appropriate procedure.
3. The flux ϕ linked with the conductors is then calculated from ϕ=∫s Bds where surface S is 
any surface bounded by the conductors.
4. The inductance is then L ≡ ϕ/I.
Difficulties with this procedure arise in practical problems where the current paths (return conductor) 
cannot be easily identified. These problems are dealt with in other chapters.
A simple example will be shown to illustrate the procedure for calculating inductance.14 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Example: Calculate the inductance between two long coaxial cylinders of inner and outer radii r1
and r2, respectively.
Solution: Step (1), a current I on the inner conductor is assumed to flow as shown in Figure 2.5, 
and returns on the outer conductor. Cylindrical symmetry indicates that the current is distributed 
uniformly.
The flux density B(r) in the space between the two conductors may be calculated (step 2) by 
applying Ampere’s Law on a curve of radius r concentric with the axis of the conductors. It fol￾lows that
B r I
2πr ( ) =  r1 2 r r µ ≤ ≤
The field for r>r2 is zero as can be confirmed by applying Equation 2.18 on a curve with radius 
r>r2 (total current linked is zero).
In step (3) the magnetic flux linked with 1m length of the conductors is calculated. This is done 
by finding first the amount of flux dϕ crossing the small strip shown hatched in Figure 2.5. It is 
clear that
d 1 φ =  dr B r( )
Hence the total flux linked is

Remarks — The above calculation does not take into account the distortion of the magnetic 
field near the edges of conductors. These effects may in many cases be neglected.
FIGURE 2.5 Calculation of the inductance of a coaxial line.EM Fields 15
The inductance depends on the logarithm of the ratio of outer and inner radii, and for the 
dimensions found in most practical systems does not vary greatly. Equation 2.24 may thus be used 
to estimate inductance even in cases where the conductors are not strictly cylindrical. Formulae 
for the inductance of some common geometries are given in Appendix B.
Implicit in this example was the assumption that the magnetic flux is entirely confined in the 
space between the two conductors. It is thus assumed that there is no flux inside the conduc￾tors. This is true provided the current is distributed close to the surface of the conductors. At low 
frequencies, this is not the case, as currents tend to flow uniformly over the entire cross section 
of the conductors. The flux density inside a conductor of radius a, carrying a current I uniformly 
distributed, may be found by applying Ampere’s Law on a curve of radius r where r≤a. It is easy 
to show that
B r I
2πa r, where r a 2 ( ) = µ ≤ (2.25)
Hence, in this case, the flux density rises linearly from the center of the conductor (Equation 2.25) 
and then falls in magnitude according to Equation 2.16 outside the conductor, as shown in the 
example.
The extra flux inside the conductor cross section indicates a higher inductance (called in this 
case the “internal inductance”). At high frequencies, the current tends to concentrate on conduc￾tor surfaces, hence the inductance tends to the value calculated in the example. These matters are 
discussed in more detail in future chapters. It is stressed at this stage that the inductance, even of a 
simple conductor, depends on the manner in which current is distributed, which in turn depends, 
among other things, on the frequency.
Current flow (movement of charges) and the associated magnetic field, represent storage of 
energy, which may be calculated directly from the formula
W 1
2 m L I
2 = (2.26)
This energy may be viewed, for illustrative purposes, as a form of kinetic energy found in mechan￾ics. The inductance is thus a measure of this energy. An alternative point of view is to associate 
this energy directly with the magnetic field rather than the current. The energy stored in a part of 
space where the magnetic field intensity is H is

(2.27)
The energy stored calculated from Equation 2.26 (circuit point of view), or from Equation 2.27 
over the entire volume occupied by the field (field point of view), yields the same value. These 
two approaches are thus equivalent and the one best suited to each problem must be chosen in 
each case.
Equation 2.27 for energy storage in a magnetic field may be used to estimate the internal 
inductance of a conductor referred to earlier. Using a thin cylindrical region as the basic element, 
energy stored using the field and circuit points of view is

where Lint is the internal inductance per unit length of the conductor. Substituting H(r) from

It is seen that for a current distributed uniformly over the conductor cross section, the internal 
inductance per unit length is independent of the radius.16 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
A complication often arising in magnetic field systems in the presence of ferromagnetic materi￾als is thatμis not a constant but varies with the local value of the field. A similar remark can be 
made for ε and electric field systems, but the former is a more common problem. In either case, 
difficulties in interpretation and in obtaining solutions are encountered as the resulting equations 
are nonlinear.
It is common to visualize the magnetic field in a manner similar to that used for the electric 
field. This is done by plotting flux lines, as shown in Figure 2.6 for a simple solenoid. Flux lines are 
always closed lines (they start and finish nowhere). Magnetic flux is conserved. Hence, in any vol￾ume, the flux entering and leaving must be the same — or, put another way, the total magnetic flux 
crossing a closed surface is always equal to zero. In a plot such as the one shown in Figure 2.6, 
areas with many flux lines indicate a strong local magnetic field.
This brief treatment of static fields may be summarized further to bring out more clearly the 
connection of these ideas with EMC. A conductor with net electric charge and/or current flow 
sets up influences around it that are understood in terms of electric and magnetic fields. Any other 
conductors, not necessarily physically connected to it, will come under these influences, with the 
result that further charge separation and current flow may result. This constitutes interference and 
its quantification and prevention is the subject of EMC. Such interactions between conductors at 
low frequencies may be studied in terms of capacitance and inductance or, as it will be shown 
in future chapters, by mutual capacitance and inductance to stress more clearly the effect of one 
conductor on another. The same concepts may also be applied with benefit at high frequencies, 
but care is required in understanding when this approach is permissible and how it should be 
applied. These issues are explained further in the remainder of this chapter.
2.2 QUASISTATIC FIELDS
In the previous section electric and magnetic fields were treated as if they are completely indepen￾dent of each other. This is acceptable at low frequencies or low rates of change of field quantities. 
When this assumption becomes invalid, it is found that a changing electric (magnetic) field induces 
a magnetic (electric) field. The ideas and equations presented earlier must therefore be generalized 
to include the coupling between these two manifestations of the electromagnetic field. Treatment in 
this section will not, however, be of the most general kind. The assumption will be made that any 
interactions between different parts of a system or circuit are practically instantaneous (quasistatic 
approximation). If the speed of propagation for electromagnetic disturbances is u (the speed of light 
for propagation in air) and the largest dimension of the system studied is D, then the time it takes for 
different parts of the system to interact electromagnetically with each other is of the order of D/u. 
FIGURE 2.6 Schematic diagram of the magnetic field due to a solenoid.EM Fields 17
If the period T of the electrical disturbance is much larger than the propagation time D/u, then, in 
electrical terms, interaction across the system is instantaneous, and the phenomena observed can be 
classed as quasistatic. Another way of expressing the same thing is to compare the wavelength λ of 
the disturbance with the largest dimension D. If λ≫D, quasistatic conditions apply. Otherwise, the 
phenomena observed belong to the truly high-frequency regime and are described in Section 2.3.
The feature of most importance in the quasistatic regime, where field quantities vary relatively 
slowly, is the coupling between electric and magnetic fields. A magnetic field changing in time 
induces an electric field. In its simplest form, this coupling is observed when a time-varying mag￾netic flux ϕ is coupled with a circuit. It is found then that a voltage is induced on this circuit as 
follows:
V d
dt ind = φ (2.29)
In field terms, the induced voltage is simply ∫C E d1, where c is a curve following the outline of the 
circuit. The magnetic flux linked is ∫S B ds, where the surface S is any surface bounded by the curve 
c. Hence Equation 2.29 may be expressed in a more general form as
t
 d  d ∫ ∫ s c
− ∂
∂ B s = E l (2.30)
Equations 2.29 and 2.30 are alternative forms of Faraday’s Law. The positive reference directions 
for the quantities shown in these equations are chosen as shown in Figure 2.7 to satisfy Lenz’s 
Law, namely, that the induced voltage must drive currents that tend to oppose any change in the 
magnetic flux coupled with the circuit. It is straightforward to determine the form of Equation 2.30 
when the curve c and surface S collapse toward a point. This is done in exactly the same way as for 
Equation 2.19 and gives
t
∇ × =
∂
∂ E B (2.31)
This equation expresses Faraday’s Law in a point or differential form. Hence, Equations 2.29, 2.30, 
and 2.31 all express the physical fact that a changing magnetic field produces an associated electric 
field. Since the magnetic field produced by a part of a circuit extends over a wide area, it follows 
that it may induce electric fields and potential differences in other, remote, circuits. This is termed 
as magnetic or inductive coupling and is a powerful coupling mechanism in EMC problems.
A changing electric field can similarly induce a magnetic field. Since the source of the magnetic 
field is current, the way in which this feature is introduced into the equations describing fields is 
FIGURE 2.7 Positive reference directions for Faraday’s Law in circuit (a) and field (b) problems.18 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
to assign to a changing electric field a fictitious current as the source of the induced magnetic field. 
This current is described as a “displacement current” to distinguish it from normal conduction cur￾rent due to the motion of free electrons in conductors. The displacement current density is ∂D/∂t, 
and must be included in the expression for total current in Ampere’s Law (Equation 2.19).

reduced to a differential or point form to obtain the equivalent of Equation 2.20.

t f (2.33)
These equations are summarized in Table 2.1 both in integral and differential forms, together with 
other useful expressions. The static case may be obtained from the expressions in this table, by 
demanding that the time derivatives are equal to zero.
In summary, in any situation where the magnetic field varies with time, an electric field is induced 
as shown schematically in Figure 2.8b. Similarly, a changing electric field induces a magnetic field 
as shown in Figure 2.8a. The term ε ∂E/∂t is the displacement current. It is of particular importance 
to EMC. We all expect that current flows in a closed “loop.” Part of the loop is through good con￾ductors and the current there is almost entirely a conduction current. If no convenient “loop” can 
be established through good conductors, the current returns as a displacement current and it is this 
part that is usually imperfectly understood by the designer. In a good design the current loops are 
kept as small as possible and identified as such at the design stage. Otherwise, the current finds its 
own path as displacement current with unpredictable impact on emission and coupling. It can be 
shown that the ratio of displacement to conduction current density is proportional to ωε/σ.
1–5 Hence, 
at high frequencies and in good dielectrics the displacement current dominates. In contrast, in good 
conductors conduction current dominates even at high frequencies.

2.2.1  The Relationship Between Circuits and Fields
Sufficient material has been presented about the electromagnetic field up to this point to attempt a 
synthesis of field ideas with the more familiar circuit concepts. This exercise is useful both in order 
to better understand circuits and fields, and also to help with practical calculations.
The basic question to ask is why is it necessary to resort to field concepts instead of reasoning 
throughout using circuit (network) concepts? There are two reasons for this. First, it is not possible 
to calculate parameter values for circuit components, such as inductors and capacitors, without an 
understanding of fields. This may not seem a serious practical problem, as in most cases component 
values are marked on components used for circuit construction. In EMC work, however, it is usu￾ally the components that are not explicitly indicated (normally referred to as “stray” or “parasitic” 
components) that are crucial in understanding the behavior of the circuit. Second, there is a whole 
class of important phenomena that cannot be understood entirely in terms of circuit concepts. High￾frequency applications, wave propagation, and radiating systems require the concept of field for an 
adequate understanding. The very notion of a lumped component representing all the capacitance of 
a system breaks down when the wavelength of the disturbance approaches the physical dimensions 
of the system. However, circuit ideas are a very useful tool in understanding complex interactions, 
as the circuit equations (Kirchhoff’s Laws) are in the form of simple algebraic or ordinary dif￾ferential equations, which are relatively easy to manipulate. In contrast, the EM field laws involve, 
in general, temporal and spatial validations and vector quantities, and result in partial differential 
equations that are relatively difficult to manipulate. It can be shown that circuit laws are a special 
case of EM field laws, in the limit when the wavelength is much larger than the largest physical 
dimension of a system.7 The relationship between fields and circuits is illustrated below.
Let us first find the circuit equivalent of Faraday’s Law (Equation 2.30). A circuit is shown in 
Figure 2.9 with a time-varying magnetic flux ϕi
 linked with it. Subscript i indicates an externally 
produced, incident, flux. This flux will induce a current that in turn will produce its own magnetic 
flux ϕs, the subscript s indicating a scattered flux, i.e., the contribution of the circuit to the total 
FIGURE 2.8 A changing electric field generates a magnetic field (a), and a changing magnetic field generates 
an electric field (b).20 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
flux ϕ=ϕI+ϕs. Applying Faraday’s Laws on a curve c coinciding with the circuit loop gives for the 
right-hand side:

FIGURE 2.9 Circuit used to illustrate Faraday’s Law in circuits and fields.EM Fields 21
This expression is none other than Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) where the total driving term is 
the voltage source plus the magnetic induction term. It is clear from this expression that any distor￾tion to the path or orientation of the circuit will result in a change to the coupled incident flux ϕi
 and 
hence a different current. This is the mechanism operating in many situations of interest to EMC.
Let us now find the circuit equivalent of Ampere’s Law.7 The configuration chosen to demon￾strate this is one of interest to EMC. It consists of a large ground place (i), a hatch (ii), and a gasket 
(iii) as shown in Figure 2.10a. Items (i) and (ii) are perfect conductors, and item (iii) is made out of 
material of electrical conductivity σ, width w, and thickness t. The mean value of the perimeter of 
the hatch is l. It is assumed that an electric field is incident on the hatch and that its value, when the 
hatch and gasket are both replaced by a conducting sheet, is Ei
. This is referred to as the short-circuit 
field to indicate that it is obtained on the assumption of a perfect short across the hatch.
First, let us evaluate the term on the left-hand side of Ampere’s Law (Equation 2.32). This is done 
on a curve C consisting of two parts Ct
 and Cb, running along the top and bottom of the gasket, as 
shown in Figure 2.10b.
Clearly, there is only free current If
 linked with this curve, and it is equal to GV, where V is the 
potential difference between the hatch and the surrounding conducting plate, and G is the electri￾cal conductance across the gasket (≈t σ 1/w). Taking account of positive reference directions gives
 d GV C C t b ∫ = − −
H l
The expression on the right-hand side of Equation 2.32 is evaluated on a surface bounded by c, 
namely St
 and Sb as shown in Figure 2.10b. Clearly, no free current flows through this surface, and 
the only term left to evaluate is ∂/∂t ∫S D ds, where D is the superposition of two parts — the field 
without the hatch shorted out Di
, and the field Ds due to the charges Q induced on the hatch.

The first term on the right represents a displacement current Ii
, which is effectively a source term 
responsible for the induced charges and voltage on the hatch. The second term represents simply the 
rate of change of the induced charge on the hatch ∂Q/∂t. The induced charge is equal in turn to the 
capacitance of the hatch with respect to the surrounding plate, times the induced voltage. Hence, 
equating both sides of Equation 2.32 gives

dt − i = + GV
FIGURE 2.10 Circuit used to illustrate Ampere’s Law in circuits and fields.22 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
This is simply Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) in the circuit representation of the hatch problem, 
which consists of a current source Ii
 (source term) producing a potential difference across the hatch 
and thus displacement and conduction currents.7
We have indicated the relationship between fields and lumped circuits. In EMC work it is impera￾tive to recognize under what circumstances a particular circuit may be treated using lumped com￾ponents (network laws, Kirchoff’s equations, etc.) or field theory (Maxwell’s equations). The general 
rule as already stated depends on the electrical size of the circuit. If the physical dimensions of the 
circuit are much smaller than the shortest wavelength of interest (highest frequency) in all dimen￾sions, then the network paradigm applies (Figure 2.11a). Network topology is paramount and the 
usual network laws apply. If one of the three dimensions is comparable to the wavelength, then 
transmission line theory based on Telegrapher’s equation is a reasonable model on which to study 
system response (Figure 2.11b). If, however, all three dimensions are comparable to the wavelength 
(Figure 2.11c), then the network paradigm is no longer valid and full-field concepts need to be 
introduced based on Maxwell’s equation. Under these circumstances, in addition to topology, the 
exact geometry of the circuit has a profound impact on the response. It goes without saying that a 
full-field solution is difficult and time consuming but it cannot be avoided under the circumstances 
outlined above. Persistence with the network paradigm when it is no longer valid, simply because 
it is simple and easier to handle, inevitably results in a catastrophic loss of accuracy and profound 
conceptual difficulties.
2.2.2 Electromagnetic Potentials
It is very convenient in many problems to define potential functions that may then be used to evalu￾ate E and B. An electrostatic potential has already been defined by Equation 2.7. This potential, 
however, accounts for electrostatic field components only. Electric fields can also be induced by 
changing magnetic fields, as indicated in the last section. There is, therefore, a need to define an 
additional potential function to account for this induced electric field and also the magnetic field. 
It turns out that a scalar potential ϕ and a vector potential A provide complete information about 
all aspects of the EM field. In particular, the electric and magnetic components are obtained from

∂ E A (2.34)
FIGURE 2.11 Schematic showing circuit size relative to the minimum wavelength of interest: (a) conditions

It can be shown that in order to fully define a vector, its divergence and curl must be specified. In 
Equation 2.35, the curl has been chosen; therefore, an additional constraint is required to define 
∇·A. The particular choice of divergence is made for convenience and commonly the Lorentz

The equations given above are wave equations for the potentials. For static or quasistatic fields the 
second term on the left-hand side may be neglected, and Equation 2.39 reduces to Poisson’s equa￾tion as expected. Its solution is given by Equation 2.8. By analogy, the solution of Equation 2.38 for 
A is obtained by substituting j for ρ as shown below:

currents, and R is the distance between point P and point r′ at the center of the volume element dv′
used in the integration. The source terms ρ and j are evaluated at point r′.
A useful application of the vector potential A is in the calculation of inductance, which is defined 
as the flux linked with a circuit loop over the current that produced it. The flux linkage is the integral 
of the flux density over a surface bounded by the circuit loop. In terms of the vector potential, this 
is equal to the surface integral of ∇×A and therefore from Stoke’s Theorem

In many problems there is no a priori knowledge of the source distributions j and ρ, and hence the 
potentials cannot be determined from Equations 2.40 and 2.41 directly. In such cases, Equations 2.38 
and 2.39, subject to the quasistatic approximation (negligible second-time derivatives), must be solved 
subject to the boundary conditions of the particular problem. This is a difficult task. Analytical solu￾tions to some simple problems are available, and these may be used for EMC studies. It is impor￾tant, however, to understand the approximations involved, and usually there are many, before using 
ready-made formulae. For most practical configurations, solutions can only be obtained by numerical 
simulation methods. This topic will be taken up in more detail in Chapters 6 and 7.
2.3 HIGH-FREQUENCY FIELDS
In the last two sections, static and quasistatic fields were examined. In both cases, the essence of 
the approximations made is that whatever changes in charge or current distribution take place, their 
effects on the system studied are practically instantaneous. When this is not the case, different 
classes of phenomena are observed. If the period and wavelength of a disturbance are such as to be 
comparable to the longest propagation time and longest dimension, respectively, of the system stud￾ied, then the problem belongs to the high-frequency regime. Two types of phenomena then dominate 
the response of systems, namely, waves and radiation. These two aspects are examined separately.
2.3.1 Electromagnetic Waves
Wave-like behavior is inherent in systems in which the propagation velocity of disturbances is 
finite. If the propagation velocity is infinite then any disturbance caused by the source would 
FIGURE 2.12 Configuration used to calculate potentials due to charge and current distributions.EM Fields 25
instantaneously spread throughout the system and the entire system would change in unison. This 
would represent an oscillation rather than a wave.
To illustrate how waves come about, a simple case of a wave propagating along the x-direction 
will be considered. The only nonzero electric and magnetic field components are then Ey and Hz.

Similar reasoning with the second term gives a phase velocity equal to −ω/β. Hence, the first term 
represents a wave propagating along the positive x-direction and the second term represents a wave 
propagating along the negative x-direction. Attention is now focused on the first wave term alone, 
as shown below

The first term on the right-hand side indicates wave-like behavior, whereas the second term is typi￾cal of diffusion-like behavior. Which behavior dominates the response of the medium depends on 
the relative magnitudes of μ, ε, and σ and on the frequency. Assuming harmonic excitation, the wave 
term is of the order of μεω2, whereas the diffusion term scales as μσω. Therefore, when ωε≫σ, 
wave behavior predominates (high frequencies, poor conductors). For low frequencies and good 
conductors, diffusion becomes the dominant mechanism.

Since now Z0 is a complex number, the electric and magnetic field components are out of phase by 
an amount dependent on the magnitude of the parameter σ/ωε.
Two limiting cases may be distinguished. First, there is the case of poor conductors σ≪ωε. 
Then, Z / 0  µ ε (since Z0 appears as a multiplier in Equation 2.51), and using the binomial theorem 
γ ≃ 0.5 σ µ ε/ j + ω µε (since γ appears as an exponent). These expressions imply that the wave 
attenuates without a significant phase shift between the electric and magnetic field components.

Approximate values of the skin depth for copper are 2mm at 1kHz and 100μm in the megahertz 
range.
2.3.2  Radiating Systems
It is already established that charge and current distributions on conductors set up around them 
electric and magnetic fields. These fields were calculated under static or quasistatic conditions. 
The problem of determining the electromagnetic field around conductors is now considered for the 
high-frequency case. This means that the physical dimensions considered are comparable to the 
wavelength and that propagation times are significant when compared to the period of variation of 
the signals. The potentials are related to the sources by Equations 2.38 and 2.39, but now the second 
derivatives with respect to time cannot be neglected. The solution to these equations is in the form 
of Equations 2.40 and 2.41 as for the quasistatic case, but now the source charge and current used to 
determine ϕ and A at time t must be those present at time t−R/u, where R is the distance between 
the observation and source points, and u is the velocity of propagation. This simply takes account of EM Fields 29
the fact that the field at the observation point at time t is due to the condition of source charges and 
currents at the earlier time t−R/u.
The potentials thus calculated are referred to as the retarded potentials and are given by the 
following expressions
r,t
dv ∫ v 4π R
[ ] φ( ) = ρ ′
ε
(2.56)
r,t
dv ∫ v 4πR
[ ] ( ) = µ ′ A j (2.57)
The brackets around ρ and j indicate distribution calculated at the retarded time t−R/u. Hence if 
0 ej t ρ = ρ ω , the retarded value is
0 e  e j t x / u 0
j t x [ ] ρ = ρ = ρ ω − ( ) ( ) ω −β
and similarly for [j].
Equations 2.56 and 2.57 may be used to evaluate the potentials and hence the EM field due to 
any specified charge and current distribution. Unfortunately, in many practical situations these dis￾tributions are not precisely known, and complex calculations are then necessary, using numerical 
methods, to obtain solutions to Equations 2.38 and 2.39. However, some simple cases are amenable 
to calculation by analytical techniques based on reasonable approximations for the distribution of 
ρ and j. These are studied below, both because they illustrate the basic properties of the field, and 
also because they can form the first step in understanding the behavior of more complex systems.
Let us now consider a very short piece of wire of length 1 (1<λ/50) where a current I is estab￾lished such that its peak value is constant everywhere on the wire and varies with an angular fre￾quency ω. Charge conservation implies that charges will accumulate at the ends of the wire so that 
I=dQ/dt. This configuration is shown in Figure 2.13. The current distribution just described is an 
acceptable approximation provided that the length l is much smaller than the wavelength λ. This 
structure is then described as a very short (infinitesimal) electric dipole.
The electromagnetic fields surrounding this dipole may be calculated from Equations 2.34 and 
2.35. For a harmonic electric field, the following expression is obtained:
E = −∇φ − ωj  A (2.58)
Potentials φ and A must be first obtained for the distribution of charges and currents shown in 
Figure 2.13. The vector and scalar potentials are related by the Lorentz condition (Equation 2.37):
∇ ⋅ = A −µε ωj φ
Hence, an alternative expression for E is
j 1 = − ( ) j  
µωε
E ∇ ∇ ⋅ − A A ω (2.59)
The electric field may thus be obtained using either of these two expressions (Equations 2.58 and 
2.59). For a harmonic variation Q Q0  ej t = ω , hence from Equation 2.56:

It should also be noted that in the far-field region, the electric and magnetic field components are 
related by the intrinsic impedance of the medium — the wave impedance Z E w = /H is equal to Z0. 
E and H form a transverse EM wave (TEM wave) with respect to the radial propagation direction αˆ ρ.
Let us now return to examine the field for the case when r cannot be regarded as very large, in 
what is described as the near-field region.
In this region the fields are given by the full set of Equations 2.62 and 2.63. The terms decay￾ing as 1/r3 represent electrostatic fields and hence capacitive energy storage. Terms decaying as 
1/r2 represent a quasistatic field due to a current element and associated energy storage around the 
dipole. This contribution is described as an inductive near field. The presence of the Er
 component 
shows that in this region not all energy flow is radially out. The dipole does not yet display its 
far-field radiation properties as regards directivity. Moreover, in the near-field region, the electric 
and magnetic field components are not related simply by the intrinsic impedance of the medium 
(E/H≠Z0). Even if Er
 is neglected, it is found that the wave impedance Zw =Eθ/Hϕ ≠Z0. To illustrate 
this, the Eθ and Hϕ components in Equations 2.62 and 2.63 are expressed in terms of the dimension￾less parameter (βr) to give

It is clear that Zw differs from the intrinsic impedance of the medium Z0 both in magnitude and in 
phase. Since βr r = ω µε = = 2πfr/u 2πr/λ, it follows that when r≫λ (far-field region), 1/(βr) → 0 
and | Zw | → Z0 as expected. Very near to the dipole (r≪λ), the wave impedance is Zw ≃ Z0 λ/2πr 
and hence much larger than Z0. This implies that the electric field component is larger than would be 
expected for a radiation field. At a distance r=λ/2π, the wave impedance has equal real and reactive 
(capacitive) parts. The reactive part is due to the storage of energy in the near field. This is reason￾able since the dipole described operates primarily by separating electric charges and by setting up 
potential differences. Near this electric dipole, the character of the source is reflected in the EM 
wave properties. In the far-field region, however, there is nothing in the field properties to identify 
the character of its source. The wave impedance is important as wave reflection and penetration are 
both determined by impedance differences along the path of propagation.
Antennas are characterized by their directivity or gain and by their effective aperture. These 
quantities are defined below and are evaluated for the case of the short electric dipole just described.
The directive gain D(θ, ϕ) of an antenna is a measure of how the radiated power is distributed 
in different directions, and is defined as the ratio of its power flux [Poynting’s vector P(θ, ϕ)1 over 
the power flux of an isotropic antenna radiating the same total power. For the short electric dipole, 
D(r, θ, ϕ) may be calculated by dividing Equation 2.60 by the flux of an isotropic dipole radiating the 
power given by Equation 2.65 uniformly over an area equal to 4πr2. Hence, for the short electric dipole
D , 1.5 sin2 ( ) θ φ = θ (2.72)
This radiation pattern is shown in Figure 2.14. The directivity of an antenna is equal to the maxi￾mum value of its directive gain. Hence, the directivity of the dipole considered here is equal to 1.5. 
The gain G of an antenna is equal to its directive gain times its radiation efficiency. In most cases, 
radiation efficiency is very high and the gain is approximately equal to the directivity. In many 
applications the gain is expressed in decibels:
G d( ) B 1 = 0 logG
Hence the gain in dB of the short electric dipole is
G d( ) b 1 = = 0log 1.5 1.76 dB ( )
FIGURE 2.14 The directive gain of a short dipole.34 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Another useful parameter is the antenna effective aperture Ae, defined as the ratio of the power 
absorbed by the antenna load to the power density of the incident wave. Assuming that the short 
dipole is polarized in the same direction as the incident electric field and that the antenna load is 
equal to its radiation resistance (maximum power transfer conditions) then

The quantity I0 (πa2
) is called the magnetic moment m of the loop, which in this example is directed 
along the z-axis. Thus, the equations above show the radiated field due to a magnetic dipole. These 
are the dual of those obtained for the electric dipole (Equations 2.62 to 2.64). The magnetic dipole 
equations are obtained from those for the electric dipole by replacing E by −H/ε and H by E/μ.

Thus, Zw differs from Z0 both in magnitude and phase. In the limit as r≫λ it is found that | Zw | →
Z0. In the near field, r≪λ, | Zw | → Z0 2πr/λ. Thus, in the near field the wave impedance is much 
smaller than Z0. This is not surprising, since near the antenna the character of the field reflects the 
manner of its production (i.e., the magnetic field is predominant). In the far region, however, its 
character is independent of the source.

length to exceed Class A limits at 30m. We assume that the frequency is f=1GHz and that the 
length of the wire is λ/30 at this frequency.
A possible practical configuration is of monopole as shown in Figure 2.16a. We exploit the 
formulae already derived for a short dipole with a few adjustments. Electromagnetically a short 
monopole of length ℓ is equivalent to a dipole in free space of length 2ℓ (method of images). 
Hence the total radiated power is obtained from Equation 2.66 by setting the length to 2ℓ and mul￾tiplying by ½ since the monopole radiates only in half space. Equation 2.64 is similarly adjusted 36 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
by changing the length to 2ℓ to obtain the magnitude of the electric field. We have therefore for 
a monopole of length ℓ

The maximum electric field is obtained for an angle of 90 degrees. We have in free space Z0 =377

70.8×10−6V/m. Substituting in Equation 2.79 we have that the required current to obtain this field

Example: Radiation from a half-wavelength dipole.
A useful example is the calculation of the maximum radiated electric field at a frequency such 
that the dipole length is equal to half the wavelength. This case represents an efficient radiator, 
which is used intentionally to construct antennas. From the EMC point of view, however, if a 
particular object meets this criterion, significant (size comparable to half wavelength), strong emis￾sions and hence EMI problems may result. The starting point for making a quantitative assessment 
is the formulae for the far-field radiation from the half-wavelength dipole, which are given below:8

is equivalent to a half-wavelength dipole. Since the monopole radiates only in half space, the total

3 Electrical Circuit Components
In trying to interpret the world as it is, humans endeavor to construct models that in some way 
approximate the behavior of real things. These models are then manipulated by analytical or com￾putational means to predict and interpret the behavior of more complex systems. In electrical work, 
a very powerful set of models used for this purpose consists of what are described as electrical 
circuit components. It goes without saying that any model is inherently an approximation to the 
real thing. A skillful investigator selects the simplest possible model consistent with acceptable 
accuracy for the type of problem under study. The purpose of this chapter is to outline the basic 
models used in electrical circuit work and describe their advantages and limitations. It would 
perhaps have been justifiable to start from general models and reduce to more basic ones. Since, 
however, most readers are more familiar with the basic models, these are chosen to form the start￾ing point of this treatment. Their relationship to more general models will be established gradually 
in subsequent sections.
The basic classification of circuit components is divided into lumped and distributed. These are 
examined in detail in the sections that follow.
3.1 LUMPED CIRCUIT COMPONENTS
Electrical phenomena require for their description models to represent energy dissipation (losses) 
and energy supply and storage. From the discussion in Chapter 2 it is evident that, in general, two 
modes of energy storage are required, namely, storage associated with the electric and magnetic 
fields. In real situations, all energy supply, dissipation, and storage processes are mixed together and 
distributed over finite parts of space. The lumped circuit representation is based on the approxima￾tion that it is acceptable to assign each of these processes to individual components, concentrated 
virtually at a point (lumped) in space. Thus, there is a lumped circuit component with the sole func￾tion of representing energy storage in the electric field and so on. These basic circuit components 
are examined below.
3.1.1  Ideal Lumped Components
Models of complex systems may be constructed using a small number of ideal basic components. 
The term ideal should be understood as meaning that such components cannot actually be con￾structed in practice. They are idealizations of real things.
There is an ideal energy dissipation component known as a resistor. The value of voltage and 
current across a resistor R is given by the following expressions in the time and frequency domains:
() () =
=
V t i t R
V I R
(3.1)
In obtaining Equation 3.1 it was assumed that positive reference current direction is from the higher 
to the lower potential across the component.
There is an ideal energy storage component, to represent storage associated with electric fields, 
described as a capacitor. The voltage and current across a capacitor C, using the same conventions 
as for Equation 3.1, are related as follows:

(3.2)
Since voltage and current are out of phase by π/2, there is no net exchange of energy with this com￾ponent—it simply deals in borrowing energy from and lending energy to the rest of the network.
A similar ideal component exists, described as an inductor, to represent energy storage in the 
magnetic field. The voltage-current relationships across an inductance L are
( ) ( ) =
= ω
V t L di t
dt
V Ij L
(3.3)
The same comments as regards energy exchange apply for inductors as for capacitors. To this list 
a component representing magnetic coupling between circuits may be added (mutual inductance). 
Similarly, voltage and current sources are required to represent energy supply. A voltage source is a 
device that can supply any current, without any change in voltage across its terminals. Clearly, in prac￾tice, this can only be approximately correct over a limited range of currents. Hence, a voltage source is 
an idealization. It may appear that ideal components are of limited use when studying real problems. 
This, however, is not the case. There are many situations in which these idealizations are good enough 
in gaining an adequate understanding of real systems. The art of modeling is not to produce the most 
comprehensive description of a component, but merely to produce one that is good enough for the 
intended application. The simplicity of ideal components makes them a powerful tool in reasoning 
about complex problems. More importantly, they may be combined to approximate to a very high 
degree of accuracy the behavior of real components. This is described in more detail in the next section.
3.1.2  Real Lumped Components
In many cases, the behavior of real components is difficult to evaluate and quantify accurately. 
Thus, emphasis will be placed in this section on identifying the circumstances in which real behav￾ior deviates substantially from the ideal. Trends then will be established and quantitative results 
given whenever possible. Each component is examined separately below.
Resistors — The question posed here is how a resistor deviates from its ideal behavior as a dissi￾pative element. This question may be answered by considering the construction of a resistor. 
Taking a wire-wound resistor with short leads as an example, it is straightforward to identify 
behavior other than that which could be described as dissipation. Since current flows through 
the leads and the dissipative element, it follows that a magnetic field will be established and, 
thus, any equivalent circuit of this component must contain an inductance associated with the 
leads (Llead) and the resistive element (Lelement), as shown in Figure 3.1. Potential differences 
between different points of such a structure are unavoidable, and hence an electric field will 
be established around the component. This in turn implies that a capacitance C must be asso￾ciated with the resistor R as shown in Figure 3.1. All components except R may be regarded 
as stray components. The way that the stray components have been introduced in Figure 3.1 
is somewhat arbitrary. Other configurations are possible that can adequately represent the 
real resistor. At low frequencies, the reactance of the inductive elements is very low; hence, 
since they are placed in series with R, their contribution is negligible. Similarly, the reac￾tance of the capacitor is high and since it appears in parallel with R, its effects are negligible. Electrical Circuit Components 41
Thus, at low frequencies the influence of the stray components is minimal and the component 
behaves, approximately, as an ideal resistor. At high frequencies, however, the reactance of 
the stray components dominates the behavior of the real component. Resonant behavior is 
also possible due to the stray inductance and capacitance. It should also be borne in mind that 
the values of the stray components are in general frequency dependent.
Although an exact calculation of these values is a major task, it should be anticipated that, even for 
a simple piece of wire, capacitances of the order of a picofarad and inductances of the order of a 
few nanohenry per centimeter length of wire can appear as stray components. Thus, for frequencies 
exceeding a few megahertz, simple resistors used in circuit construction start to exhibit behavior 
influenced by stray components. In EMC work, where circuits and components have to meet a 
demanding specification over a wide frequency range, normally exceeding the normal operating 
range, the distribution and magnitude of stray components is of paramount interest. It should also 
be noted that even the value of the resistance R cannot be regarded as constant independent of 
frequency. It was established in Chapter 2 that current and magnetic field distribute nonuniformly 
over the cross section of a conductor. It was found that current concentrates near the surfaces over a 
thickness of a few skin depths δ (Equation 2.53), where
δ = µσ
1
πf
In copper (εr = μr = 1, σ = 5.8 × 107 S/m) the skin depth at several frequencies is shown below.
If the skin depth is much larger than the conductor radius r, then the resistance per unit length is
= σ
R 1
 π r2
If, however, δ << r, then only a small layer near the surface is available for conduction. Hence, 
approximately, the resistance per unit length is
R 1
2π r  = σ δ (3.4)

It follows from this expression that the resistance increases as the square root of the frequency. For 
conductors with a noncircular cross section, the same principles apply and Equation 3.4 may be 
used with suitable modifications. Another factor that affects the distribution of current is the prox￾imity of other conductors or components. Any change to the distribution of current in a conductor 
cross section due to proximity effects will inevitably change the resistance and inductance associ￾ated with the conductor.
Capacitors — Capacitors exhibit nonideal behavior for similar reasons as described above. 
A large value electrolytic capacitor cannot be regarded as being lossless and the capaci￾tor leads contribute their own losses and stray inductance and capacitance, as shown in 
Figure 3.2. This circuit may look unnecessarily complicated, but it brings out the vari￾ous processes that affect the high-frequency behavior of a capacitor. The lead induc￾tance and resistance are not dissimilar to those associated with a resistive component 
of similar physical dimensions. Similarly, the stray capacitance Cs is that associated 
with the electric field established between the capacitor leads. The loss resistance is due 
to dissipative mechanisms inside the dielectric. If low-loss dielectrics are used, Rloss is 
very large and can normally be neglected. Its value is related to the loss tangent of the 
dielectric by the expression
= ω δ
R 1
 Ctan loss (3.5)
The combined effect of all these factors is to change the character of the impedance presented by 
a real capacitor. While at low frequencies the impedance decreases with increasing frequency as 
expected; this situation gradually reverses and, beyond a frequency described as the resonant fre￾quency of the capacitor, the impedance increases with frequency. This indicates inductive rather 
than capacitive behavior. As expected, the value of the resonant frequency depends, among other 
factors, on the length of the leads. Common-type capacitors have resonant frequencies of the order 
of a few megahertz. Lead-through capacitors approach a few tens of megahertz. Typical behavior 
for a range of capacitors is shown in Figure 3.3, showing how the nature of a nominally capacitive 
component alters at modest high frequencies. Surface mount capacitors, with much shorter leads, 
have resonance frequencies that are much higher, but nevertheless the same limitations apply. Some 
manufacturers of capacitors give an equivalent series inductance (ESL) to account partially for the 
complex real capacitor behavior at high frequencies.
It is important to ascertain carefully the high-frequency performance of capacitors used in EMC 
applications.
FIGURE 3.2 Equivalent circuit of a real capacitor.Electrical Circuit Components 43
Inductors — Inductors are perhaps the most difficult component to design. A possible equiv￾alent circuit is shown in Figure 3.4. Resistor R representing losses is usually significant, 
especially for inductors wound on magnetic cores. It represents several processes, i.e., 
ohmic losses in the wire and leads, eddy, and hysteresis losses. The latter normally pre￾dominate. At low frequencies the impedance increases with frequency. However, beyond a 
frequency referred to as the resonant frequency of the inductor, the impedance decreases 
with increasing frequency. This behavior is characteristic of a capacitor rather than an 
inductor. Typical behavior for inductors is depicted in Figure 3.5. For high-value induc￾tances, the resonant frequency can be quite low (less than 1MHz). Inductors of a few 
microhenry in value have resonant frequencies in the 100MHz range. The actual value

2-cm leads; (c) 0.1 μF, feed-through capacitor; (d) 4 μF, bushing capacitor.
FIGURE 3.4 Equivalent circuit of a real inductor.44 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
of the inductance depends on the distribution of current. This can be seen even in the 
simple case of the inductance of a wire. From the discussion leading to the derivation of 
Equation 2.28 for the internal inductance, it can be seen that it was based on the assump￾tion that the current was distributed uniformly on the wire cross section. This is only one 
contribution to the total inductance, but it illustrates the range of factors that influence 
inductance values at different frequencies.
Another factor that cannot normally be ignored in inductance calculations is the influence of nonlin￾ear effects. In cases where wires are wound on magnetic cores, or are in the proximity of magnetic 
materials, nonlinear effects may significantly affect inductance values. This may best be illustrated 
with reference to the simple system shown in Figure 3.6. A wire of N turns is wound on an iron 
former as shown. Actual magnetic cores may be different in shape from that shown. In any case, an 
effective cross section A and magnetic length 1 may be defined, so that the analysis presented here 
is of general value in understanding how the inductance of the coil depends on the parameters of the 
magnetic circuit.
Two fundamental laws may be applied to this circuit to obtain an expression for the coil induc￾tance and a relationship between the applied voltage and the magnetic flux density in the magnetic 
core. Applying Ampere’s Law on a curve coinciding with a mean magnetic line gives:

Assuming that v(t) represents a harmonic voltage of frequency ω and peak value Vpk, the expression 
above implies that
Vpk = ω N    N φ = pk     ω A Bpk (3.8)
From Equation 3.8, it is clear that the peak flux density in the core depends on the peak applied 
voltage and its frequency. Magnetic materials have a B–H characteristic of the shape shown in 
Figure 3.6b. If the flux density exceeds the value Bsat, the magnetic field intensity increases dispro￾portionately. This has two implications. First, it means that a much higher current will be drawn 
by the coil (Equation 3.6) with undesirable effects on the power supply and circuits feeding the 
coil. Second, if Bpk > Bsat the magnetic permeability of the iron will decrease substantially. This is 
clear from Figure 3.6b and the relationship μr μ0 = ΔB/ΔH. In turn, the coil inductance decreases 
substantially. Equation 3.8 offers guidance as to what is likely to happen if the frequency is much 
lower than that originally intended for the coil. Assuming that the peak voltage remains the same, 
the magnetic core will operate at a much higher peak magnetic flux density. If this value exceeds 
Bsat, the coil inductance will be much lower than expected.
It is therefore necessary to examine carefully the interplay of the various factors mentioned 
above when a system is evaluated under conditions (such as frequency, peak voltage, pulse duration) 
that are different to those applicable under normal operating conditions. This is important in many 
EMC assessments.
The development of realistic models for real components is thus a nontrivial task that must 
be approached with care. In most cases, simple equivalents can give acceptable semiquantitative 
results. Further details may be found in References 1, 2, and 3.
3.2 DISTRIBUTED CIRCUIT COMPONENTS
In real physical systems energy storage and dissipation are mixed together and distributed over 
relatively large areas. It is therefore necessary to investigate under what circumstances it is permis￾sible to separate resistive, capacitive, and inductive behavior and model it by lumped components. 
It turns out that in answering this question, the relationship between the physical size of the system 
and the wavelength of the disturbance to be studied is crucial. Let the size of the system be D and 
FIGURE 3.6 A nonlinear inductor (a) and the B-H characteristic of the iron (b).46 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
the wavelength of the disturbance be λ. In cases where disturbances of several wavelengths are 
present, then the shortest wavelength is compared with D. If D << λ, then conditions across the 
network are established practically instantaneously—the propagation time of disturbances is neg￾ligible compared to their period. In such cases, it is a good approximation to lump together various 
components to model circuit behavior in the most acceptable way. If, however, D ≥ λ, propagation 
effects are dominant and a lumped component representation fails to represent accurately a whole 
class of phenomena observed under these circumstances. It is still possible to take small sections of 
the system, of a size that is much smaller than λ, and thus study these subsections using a lumped 
parameter representation. However, when examining the behavior of the entire system, a new way 
of reasoning is necessary to take full account of propagation effects. The purpose of this section is 
to develop an understanding of, and techniques for, the solution of distributed networks, i.e., net￾works for which D ≥ λ.
Let us start first with a few examples to illustrate the circumstances under which a distributed 
model is necessary. A high-voltage power transmission line of length D = 100 km needs to be mod￾eled (Figure 3.7a). A typical model used for this purpose is a π-equivalent as shown in Figure 3.7b. 
The inductance L is equal to the inductance per unit length of the line times the line length. The 
capacitance C is calculated similarly. Under what circumstances is this model an acceptable repre￾sentation of the line? Consider first the study of power signals (50 or 60Hz). The wavelength for a 
50-Hz signal is λ = 3 × 108/50 = 6 × 106m. This is much larger than the length of the line and hence 
the model is quite adequate. Let us now examine whether this model is suitable to study the propa￾gation of lightning-induced transients on this line. These are, typically, unidirectional pulses with a 
rise-time of 1 μsec. Such a pulse contains a rich spectrum of frequencies, but a substantial amount of 
energy will be associated with frequencies of the order of 1/τr
, where τr
 is the rise-time of the pulse. 
For this example, it is reasonable to examine whether the model is adequate for the study of frequen￾cies of the order of 1/τr ≃ 1MHz. The wavelength at this frequency is λ = 3 × 108/106 = 300m. This 
is smaller than the length of the line, hence the model in Figure 3.7b is not suitable for studying the 
propagation of this pulse.
A coaxial cable (Figure 3.8a) 1.5m in length is used for the transmission of a 100-MHz signal. The 
cable length can be represented, at low frequencies, by a circuit of the types shown in Figure 3.7b. 
The wavelength at 100MHz is λ = 2/3 × 3 × 108/108 = 2m where the velocity of propagation in the 
cable was taken to be equal to 2/3 of the speed of light in air. Since the wavelength is comparable to 
the cable length, the model shown in Figure 3.7b is not suitable for studying this problem.
Finally, let us consider two parallel tracks on a printed circuit board (Figure 3.8b) connecting 
electronic equipment placed 30 cm apart. Signals with a rise-time of 5 nsec are transmitted along 
the transmission line formed by these tracks. Treating this problem in the same way as for the 
lightning pulse and the power line, and taking as the propagation velocity 0.6 times the speed of 
light in air gives λ = 90 cm. Hence, this line cannot be represented by a circuit of the type shown 
in Figure 3.7b.
FIGURE 3.7 A wire-above-ground transmission line (a) and its -equivalent (b).Electrical Circuit Components 47
These examples illustrate that each physical system may be modeled in different ways depending 
on the type of problem considered. It is the task of the investigator to select, in each case, the appro￾priate model and to obtain solutions. Models of distributed systems and their solutions are presented 
in subsequent sections. The examples given, and the analyses that follow, refer to transmission 
lines. There are, however, other distributed circuits that cannot be regarded as transmission lines, 
and yet their behavior and analysis are very similar. An example is a transformer coil, which at low 
frequencies may be adequately represented by an inductance or a more complete circuit as shown 
in Figure 3.4. However, when steep- fronted pulses are applied to the coil, it behaves very much 
like a transmission line and may be studied using techniques very similar to those described below.
3.2.1  Time-Domain Analysis of Transmission Lines
Let us consider the parallel-wire transmission line shown schematically in Figure 3.9a. The connec￾tion of a voltage source on this line will result in the separation and movement of charges and thus in 
the establishment of electric and magnetic fields. Energy storage in the field may be represented by 
capacitance and inductance per unit length, Cd and Ld, respectively. These may be calculated if the 
dimensions and the medium surrounding the line are known (Appendix B). The termination of the 
line at the far end is not specified. The following question is posed: Immediately after switch SW is 
FIGURE 3.8 A coaxial line (a) and a line consisting of two parallel tracks above a ground plane (b).
FIGURE 3.9 A parallel-wire transmission line (a), conditions after time Δt (b), voltage and current distribu￾tions after reflection from the load end (c), and the Thevenin equivalent circuit at the load (d).48 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
closed, what current will flow into the line? More specifically, is this current affected immediately 
by the actual line termination?
The answer to these questions can only be given after a systematic examination of conditions 
at the start of the line has been made following the closure of the switch. The source will transfer 
electric charge so that the top wire is left with a surplus of positive charge and the bottom wire with 
a surplus of negative charge. This situation is depicted in Figure 3.9b, where it has been assumed 
that over a time interval Δt this disturbance has progressed into the line a distance Δx. The charge 
induced on each wire is
∆ = Q C( ) d s ∆x V
and hence the current is
I Q = ∆ / t ∆ = C Vd s ( ) ∆ ∆ x/ t C = d s V u (3.9)
where u is the velocity of propagation of the disturbance.
The magnetic flux linked with this portion of the line is
∆φ = ∆ ( ) L   d x I
The voltage Vs must be related to the magnetic flux by Faraday’s Law, hence
Vs d = ∆φ ∆/ t = ∆ L I( ) x/∆ = t Ld I u (3.10)
Combining Equations 3.9 and 3.10 gives
Vs d = L Cd s V u2
or that the velocity of propagation of the disturbance on the line is
u = 1
L Cd d
(3.11)
Similarly, by substituting from Equation 3.11 into Equation 3.10, the current is found to be related 
to the voltage by the expression
I V s s = = / Ld d /C V /s Z (3.12)
where Z is known as the characteristic or surge impedance of the line. Hence, the current flowing 
initially into the line is determined by its characteristic impedance (and source impedance if it is not 
zero). Only after the disturbance has reached the line termination, has been suitably modified, and 
traveled back to the source, will the influence of the termination be felt by the source.
Let us now follow this process for a little longer, assuming that the line length is 1 and that its 
termination is an open circuit. After time τ = 1/u (the transit time of the line) the voltage and cur￾rent on the line will be Vs and Is, respectively. However, this situation cannot persist any longer, 
since the open-circuit termination demands zero current. The only way to meet this constraint is 
to assume that a voltage pulse V′ will be reflected back with an associated current equal to −V′/Z 
so that the total current on the line is forced to zero. This demands that V′ = Vs, i.e., that following Electrical Circuit Components 49
the arrival of pulse Vs at the termination the voltage doubles in magnitude and that this disturbance 
travels toward the source. The current is simultaneously forced to zero, as shown in Figure 3.9c. As 
this disturbance reaches the source, further reflections will take place, and the process will continue 
until damped by losses that inevitably are present in real systems.
It is useful to ascertain exactly what reflections take place when a termination other than an open 
circuit is present. This can be done easily by replacing the line, as seen from its termination, by its 
Thevenin equivalent circuit. It is assumed that a voltage Vi
 is traveling along the line and is incident 
on the termination. In the previous discussion Vi = Vs, but the incident voltage would have a differ￾ent value if the source had a finite impedance, etc. Clearly, the Thevenin equivalent circuit consists 
of a voltage source equal to the open-circuit voltage of the line 2Vi
 as shown earlier, in series with an 
impedance Z equal to the characteristic impedance of the line. This circuit is shown in Figure 3.9d 
connected to the load resistance RL. It is obvious from Figure 3.9d that the load voltage is

As expected, when the load is an open circuit RL → ∞, the reflection coefficient is equal to one. For 
a short circuit (RL = 0), it follows from Equation 3.15 that ΓL = −1. For the special case when RL = Z, 
the reflection coefficient is equal to zero. This means that the entire line charges to voltage Vi
 in 
time τ without further reflections. Under these circumstances, the line is described as matched.
The circuit in Figure 3.9d may be generalized to deal with more general terminations. For 
instance, if the load is a capacitor CL, then RL may be replaced in this circuit by CL and the voltage 
VL determined in the normal way for a capacitor-charging circuit. Clearly, these analyses are valid 
as long as no further pulses arrive from further reflections. These more general situations will be 
dealt with in more detail in Chapter 8.
Several observations relevant to EMC can be made based on this simple model of propagation 
and reflection. A line with an open-circuit termination, as shown in Figure 3.9a, will carry current 
pulses of magnitude Vs/Z and duration related to its transit time and the position on the line where 
the current is measured. For example, the current at the source end will have the waveform shown 
in Figure 3.10a. If losses are neglected then this waveform persists for ever. Otherwise, the current 
FIGURE 3.10 Current variation at the source end (a) and voltage in the middle of the line (b).50 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
eventually decays to zero. A line with a short-circuit termination does not have a zero voltage across 
its entire length. The voltage in the middle of such a line is shown in Figure 3.10b. If losses are 
added to this system, the waveform shown decays in an exponential manner. Both these examples 
indicate the presence of pulses even when the supply is a step voltage. Only in the case of a matched 
line would a train of pulses be avoided. Clearly, this situation has EMC implications. Further details 
regarding the propagation of pulses on transmission lines may be found in References 4 and 5.
3.2.2 Frequency-Domain Analysis of Transmission Lines
In the previous section, the response of a line to a step voltage was examined. Clearly any time￾varying input could have been employed instead and the same principles used to obtain a solution. 
The complexity of such calculations is considerable, however, and they are not normally attempted 
without computational aids, except for the simplest waveforms.
In many applications, however, the response of a line to a harmonic excitation only is required. 
In such cases, it is possible to obtain analytical solutions as shown below.

For a lossless line (Rd = Gd = 0) this expression reduces to that obtained in Equation 3.12.
Two types of term appear in Equation 3.22, namely those varying as e−γx and eγx. The instanta￾neous value of the voltage due to a term of the first type is

 
 − α( ) + β ω ~ Re e e j x j t
or proportional to cos(ωt − βx). This expression represents a wavelike term where a point of constant 
phase is subject to the constraint ωt − βx = const. This implies that ωdt − βdx = 0, and therefore 
that the phase velocity is u = ω/β. Disturbances represented by this term propagate in the forward 
direction. Terms of the type eγx may be similarly studied and it is found that they describe waves 
moving in the backward direction (u = −ω/β). In conclusion, conditions on the line are the result of 
a succession of waves traveling in the forward and backward directions.
In Equation 3.22, VA and VB are constants determined from the source and load conditions of the 
line. Assuming a line terminated as shown in Figure 3.12, VA and VB may be expressed in terms of

The voltage and current at the load end of the line may be obtained by setting x = 1 in Equation 3.24.

Let us study in some detail this expression. It is clear, without much further consideration, that the

the input impedance approach Z1. The quantity (β1) is described as the “electrical length” of the

This shows that a line that is a quarter of a wavelength short (β1 = π/2) appears at its input as a 
short circuit, even though its load end is an open circuit. In fact, a vast range of input impedance 
values is possible depending on the value of (β1). The input impedance of a short-circuit line is 
similarly obtained from Equation 3.28 and is

This expression implies that a short-circuit line one-quarter of a wavelength long appears at its input 
as an open circuit. The presence of losses on the line modifies somewhat these conclusions, but the 
essence remains the same.
From the EMC point of view, it is clear that the line termination alone is a poor guide as to 
the effective impedance seen at the start of a line. A connection that at low frequencies appears 
as a short circuit (DC short) looks very different at high frequencies. The material that has been

presented in this section is not limited to systems specifically designed as transmission lines. 
Most wire connections and components behave like distributed components at sufficiently high 
frequencies, and thus exhibit similar behavior. The importance of these effects may be further illus￾trated by the following example. A line is formed on a substrate so that the velocity of propagation 
is u = 0.6 × 3 × 108m/s. It is required to establish its behavior at a frequency of 300MHz. The wave￾length under these circumstances is λ = 0.6 × 3 × 108/3 × 108 = 60 cm. Hence a section of this line 
one-quarter of a wavelength long (15 cm) will exhibit very strongly the behavior described above 
and due consideration must be given to transmission-line effects. It should be noted that distances 
of the order of tens of centimeters are typical of track lengths in many electronic systems. This topic 
will be examined again in future chapters.
More detailed descriptions of transmission line effects may be found in References 5 and 6.

4 Electrical Signals and Circuits
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the basic techniques used to describe 
signals, their detection by simple circuits, and their manipulation using signal processing 
techniques.
Electrical signals are usually voltages that may, however, represent a wide variety of physical 
processes, e.g., electric field or temperature variations. Similarly, the term “circuits” may be taken 
to mean a physical system which, when excited in a particular way, responds appropriately. Hence 
the material presented in this chapter is of general value in understanding signals of all types.
A signal is described by a mathematical function, in which the variable is normally time. For 
example, a voltage source may be described as v(t) = Vpk cos (ωt). This, however, is not the only kind 
of functional relationship found in EMC work. The function v(t) may take many analytical forms, or 
may be defined by a set of experimental data obtained at different times. It is necessary, therefore, to 
separate the exact functional form of v(t) from the more general properties of the signal, and its fur￾ther processing by hardware (circuits) and software (computer programs) means. This mathematical 
description of signals offers great flexibility to the investigator, as it makes it possible to isolate and 
study specific attributes of the signal and its processing.
Signals may be broadly divided into deterministic and random or stochastic signals. Deterministic 
signals are those for which the instantaneous value can be specified accurately at each instant of 
time. These are signals that are used to transmit information and are therefore of primary interest 
in all applications. There are, however, signals for which even approximate predictions of variation 
with time cannot be made. These are signals that are due to chaotic thermal fluctuations in circuits 
and are described as random or stochastic signals. The term “noise” is also used to express the 
manifestation of these phenomena. A distinction may be drawn between noise, which is generated 
internally by a circuit, and interference, which is coupled to it from external sources. In cases where 
the interfering signal is low level, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between internally and 
externally generated unwanted signals and the term “noise” is used indiscriminately to indicate an 
unwanted signal. Study of the basic properties of random signals is useful in EMC as it determines 
the limits of detectability of signals in noisy environments.
In many cases signals may be measured and specified at any instant. They are then described as 
continuous (or analogue) signals. There are, however, circumstances in which signals are known 
only at specific instants, multiples of a basic sampling time interval Δt. They are then known as 
sampled (or discrete) signals. The magnitude of each sample of a discrete signal may be repre￾sented by a binary number. A common representation is to use 8 bits, and thus a pulse train of 
eight pulses of magnitude 1 or 0 to represent each sample. This signal is then described as a digital 
signal. Whichever signal representation is chosen, certain general principles apply that permit the 
description of any complex signal in terms of simpler signals. Examples of such representations 
are given below.

It may be shifted in time to obtain the function u(t−t0) shown in Figure 4.1b. The signal v(t) shown 
in Figure 4.1c may be represented by a succession of step voltages, as shown in Figure 4.1d.

An alternative approach is to represent the signal in Figure 4.1c as a succession of pulses, as shown 
in Figure 4.1e. In the limit, the basic constituent of this representation is the delta function defined 
by the following properties:

Another way of representing a signal is to express it in terms of a number of basis functions, such 
as sinusoids, in the form

It should be noted that only certain signals are suitable as basis signals in Equation 4.5.
The selection of basis functions ϕi
(t) and the calculation of the coefficients Ci
 will be explained 
shortly. However, it is worth pausing to reflect on the significance of Equations 4.3 to 4.5. In all 
cases, the original signal is described in terms of other simpler signals. If the response of a circuit 
to these simpler signals can be found, and provided that the principle of superposition holds (linear 
circuit), then the response to the original signal is easily obtained by combining the responses to the 
simpler signals. A particularly useful formulation is when harmonic signals are used as the basis 
functions.1,2 A periodic signal v(t) of period T may then be represented in different ways as a collec￾tion of harmonic signals, as shown below.

The harmonic functions are all multiples of the fundamental frequency ω0 = 2π/T and this represen￾tation of the signal is referred to as an expansion into a Fourier series. The three expressions above 
are equivalent and the particular choice is a matter of convenience. The unknown coefficients an, bn,

Any periodic signal of period T may thus be represented by a collection of harmonic signals (infi￾nite in number), which have a frequency an integer multiple of ω0 = 2π/T. This is known as a spec￾tral representation of the signal.
To illustrate the application of these formulae, the square wave signal shown in Figure 4.2a 
will be studied. Its period is T and the signal is supposed to exist forever! A signal that is zero for 58 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility

FIGURE 4.2 A repetitive pulse waveform (a), its amplitude (b), and phase (c) spectra.Electrical Signals and Circuits 59
It contains a DC term, first, third, fifth, and so on, harmonics. It is interesting to speculate how many 
terms are required to describe accurately this signal in terms of its spectral content. Clearly, for 
higher harmonics (n large) the amplitude decreases and hence contributions are small. The reader 
may plot the formula above retaining the first three terms only and compare the result with the 
waveform in Figure 4.2a. It will be seen that a substantial error remains at the transition between low 
and high values. This error persists even when many more terms are included in the Fourier series 
(Gibbs phenomenon).

Coefficients C0, 2|Cn|, and ϕn ≈ of this signal. The first few terms are plotted in Figure 4.2b and 
c. The shape of the envelope of the magnitude spectrum is that of the function sinx/x, which is 
tabulated in Appendix C. Naturally, real square- wave pulses do not have zero rise- and fall￾times as assumed here. The influence of finite rise- and fall-times on the spectra is explained 
in Appendix D. However, it is already possible to gain an insight into the spectral content of 
this signal. Let us assume that the repetition rate is 50 MHz (T = 1/50 1 06 = 20 nsec) and that 
the duty cycle is 50% (τ = 0.5 T = 10 nsec). Then the fundamental frequency is 50 MHz and the 
first zero in the magnitude spectrum is at f = 1/τ = 100 MHz. It can be seen that at the ninth 
harmonic (f = 450 MHz) the amplitude is still in excess of 10% of its value at the fundamental 
frequency. This type of pulse thus contains many frequencies covering the entire range of inter￾est to EMC.
Let us now consider how to deal with signals that are not periodic. In mathematical terms, an 
aperiodic signal may be regarded as a periodic signal with very large period (T → ∞). Hence, the 
last expression in Equation 4.6 can be generalized to give the Fourier transform of a signal v(t).

The essential difference between the spectra of periodic and nonperiodic waveforms is that in the 
former the spectrum consists of contributions at distinct frequencies multiples of the fundamental, 
while in the latter there are contributions at all frequencies, i.e., the spectrum is continuous. As an 
example, the spectrum of the pulse shown in Figure 4.3a is calculated. Using Equation 4.10 and

Let us now examine the spectrum of a very-short-duration impulse, such that the product of its

Thus, the delta impulse has a flat spectrum. Applying a very-short-duration pulse is like injecting 
signals at all frequencies having the same magnitude and phase. The value of this so-called impulse 
excitation is that it contains within it the entire spectrum of signals.
In practical situations, it is difficult to generate pulses of zero rise- and fall-times. It is therefore 
useful to study the spectrum of signals with a smooth transition from zero to the peak voltage value. 
A particularly useful signal of this type is the Gaussian pulse defined as
v t V e0 at2
( ) = − (4.12)
The effective duration of this pulse τd is defined as the time interval in which the pulse exceeds 10% 
of its peak value. It can be shown that τ =d 3/ a . The spectrum of this pulse is found to be
∫ ( ) ω = = ( )

∞ − ω −ω V j V0 e e dt V π / ae at j t 0 / 4a 2 2
(4.13)
Thus, the spectrum is also a smooth function of frequency of the same shape as the pulse.
The pair of transforms described by Equations 4.9 and 4.10 offers two alternatives for the study 
of signals. First, a signal may be described as a function of time or in what is referred to as the 
time domain. If the time variation of the signal is a complicated one, it is normally very diffi￾cult to proceed directly by calculation to find the response of circuits to it. Second, an alternative 
approach may be adopted whereby the spectral content V(jω) of the original signal v(t) is found using 
Equation 4.10. The response of a circuit to v(t) can then be studied by reference to its response to the 
spectral components V(jω). This approach is normally easier to pursue, especially for signals with 
complicated time waveforms. The spectrum V(jω) of the signal contains complete information about 
it and may be regarded as its description in the frequency domain. Conversion between the time 
and frequency domains is achieved by using the direct (Equation 4.10) and inverse (Equation 4.9) 
Fourier transforms. It can be shown that
∫ ∫ ( ) = ω( ) ω −∞

(4.14)
This equation, referred to as Parseval’s Theorem, relates measures of energy associated with signal 
description in the time and frequency domains. A plot of |V(jω)|2 vs. frequency is described as the 
power spectrum of the signal.
Examination of Figure 4.3 shows that a decrease in the duration of a pulse (τ small) results in a 
broad spectrum of frequencies (l/τ increases), i.e., a narrow pulse implies a wide bandwidth and vice 62 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
versa. In broad terms it can be stated that the product of signal duration in the time domain τd and 
of its bandwidth (BW) in the frequency domain is of the order of 1, i.e.,
τd ( ) BW  1 (4.15)
Let us now study the spectrum of a more complex waveform, such as the one shown in Figure 4.4a. 
Clearly, this waveform may be regarded as the product of the two waveforms shown in Figure 4.4b 
and c. The spectrum of the waveform (b) can be obtained easily.

FIGURE 4.4 A sinusoidal signal of finite duration (a) and its derivation from a periodic signal (b) and 
pulse (c). The spectrum of V1 (d) and of v(t) (e).Electrical Signals and Circuits 63
Thus, the amplitude spectrum of V1(t) consists of two contributions of ±ω0 as shown in Figure 4.4d. 
The spectrum of v2(t) has already been obtained (Figure 4.3b).
The question arises whether the spectrum of the waveform shown in Figure 4.4a may be obtained 
from the spectra of v1(t) and v2(t). It turns out that this is the case, but while v = v1(t) v2(t), the 
spectrum V(jω) ≠ V1(jω) V2(jω). Instead the following expression holds:

The integral on the right-hand side of Equation 4.17 is called the convolution of waveforms V1(jω) 
and V2(jω) and it is normally indicated using the notation V1(jω) * V2(jω).

(4.18)
This expression indicates that the spectrum of v(t) consists of the spectrum of the rectangular pulse 
shifted by ±ω0, as shown in Figure 4.4e.
Several conclusions may be drawn from these spectra. If the duration of the cosinusoidal wave is 
long (τd ≫), then its spectrum shown in Figure 4.4e becomes very narrow around ±ω0 and tends to 
that of a waveform of infinitely long duration. If only a few periods of the signal are included (τd ≪), 
then the spectrum contains very substantial contributions at frequencies other than ω0.
4.2 CORRELATION PROPERTIES OF SIGNALS
There are many applications that are critically dependent on evaluating the degree of similarity 
between two signals or, in technical parlance, their correlation. A particular example of this is in 
radar. The correlation properties of signals are described in this section.
4.2.1  General Correlation Properties
The autocorrelation of a signal v(t) is defined as the quantity
∫ ( ) = − ( ) ( ) τ −∞
∞
R π v t v t dt (4.19)
where the signal v(t−τ) has the same functional dependence as signal v(t) but it is shifted in time 
by an amount τ. For the signal shown in Figure 4.5a, the autocorrelation is shown in Figure 4.5b. 
Similarly, the autocorrelation of the signal in (c) is given in (d). It can be shown that the power 
spectrum |V(jω)|2 of a signal and its autocorrelation function are Fourier transform pairs (Wiener–
Khinchine Theorem). From this it follows that the wider the frequency spectrum of a signal is, the 
narrower the width of its autocorrelation function will be and the easier it will be to locate it in time. 
Under some circumstances it may be easier to obtain the power spectrum of a signal by first finding 
its autocorrelation and then its Fourier transform.
A measure of the similarity between two signals is provided by their cross-correlation,
defined as

4.2.2  Random Signals
Random signals and their mathematical description is an extensive subject that cannot be covered 
fully in this text. However, it is necessary to get a basic idea of random signals, which manifest 
themselves as noise in many systems. It may be thought that random signals, by their nature, cannot 
be described in any precise way. Although this is true as far as predicting their precise evolution 
in time is concerned, it does not, however, prevent us from making precise statements about them, 
which are true in a statistical sense.
Let us consider a quantity x varying randomly, with a probability P(x) that this quantity has a 
particular value x. Then the mean or expected value of x, designated as 〈x〉, is
m x x P x dx ∫ = = ( ) −∞
∞
(4.22)
Similarly, the mean square value of x is
x x  P x dx 2 2 ∫ = ( ) −∞
∞
(4.23)
Another quantity of particular interest is the variance of x, σx
2
 defined as
σ =x ( ) x m− = x x − 2 2 2 2 (4.24)
FIGURE 4.5 Autocorrelation of the signals in (a) and in (c), shown in (b) and (d), respectively.Electrical Signals and Circuits 65
The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation σx of the signal x. For most signals 
encountered in engineering applications, the averaging indicated by Equations 4.22, 4.23, and 4.24 
may be replaced by a time-average over a period of time T, which tends to infinity (ergodic signals), i.e.,

A representation of a random signal in the time domain has a corresponding description in the 
frequency domain. It will be assumed here that the statistical characteristics of a random signal 
remain unchanged with respect to time (stationary random signal). The autocorrelation of such a 
signal is defined as
R( ) τ = xtxt ( ) ( ) + τ (4.25)
It will be seen from this expression and from Equation 4.24, that provided the mean value of x(t) is 
zero, then σ =x R 0( ). 2
The autocorrelation of a random signal v(t) and its power spectrum Wv(jω) are a Fourier transform

A particularly useful random signal is “white noise,” defined as a signal with a constant power

4.3 THE RESPONSE OF LINEAR CIRCUITS TO 
DETERMINISTIC AND RANDOM SIGNALS
The response of linear circuits to a variety of inputs can be described in several ways. Two particu￾lar techniques used frequently are to find the circuit’s impulse and frequency response. These two 
cases are examined below.66 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
4.3.1  Impulse Response
The impulse response h(t) of a circuit is the output obtained when the input signal is a delta function. 
In practice, the impulse applied at the input must have a duration much shorter than the shortest time 
constant of the circuit. If the impulse response h(t) is known, then the output to any input signal is 
equal to the convolution of h(t) and the function describing the input signal (Figure 4.6a), i.e.,
∫ ( ) = τ( ) ( ) − τ τ −∞
∞
v t out v h in t d (4.29)
4.3.2 Frequency Response
An alternative approach is to find the frequency response of the circuit H(jω) to harmonic inputs 
covering the entire frequency range of interest. The phasor describing the output signal at a particular 
frequency is given by the expression
Vout () () () j H ω = j V ω ωj in (4.30)
as shown in Figure 4.6b.
To find the response to an arbitrary input, the spectrum of the input signal is first determined using 
Fourier transforms. The output to each frequency component is then obtained from Equation 4.30 
and thus the spectrum of the output signal is found. The output voltage in the time domain can then 
be obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the output spectrum.
The impulse and frequency responses h(t) and H(jω), respectively, are Fourier transform pairs. 
Either of these two functions describes fully the response of the circuit. An alternative method for 
determining the impulse response of a linear system is to exploit the property that the input-output 
cross-correlation is equal to the convolution of the impulse response and the input autocorrela￾tion.3 The input-output cross-correlation is defined as Rin/out = 〈vin(t) vout(t + τ)〉. If the input to the 
system is supplied with white noise [autocorrelation W0δ(τ)] and the input-output cross-correlation 
is measured, then h(t) = Rin-out(t)/W0. This approach has several advantages.3
The following simple example will help to illustrate the techniques described above.
Example 1: Find the frequency and impulse responses of the circuit shown in Figure 4.7 and then 
obtain an expression for the output voltage when the input is a step voltage V0.
Solution: The frequency response is easily obtained:

4.3.3  Detection of Signals in Noise
Strategies have evolved to detect signals that are mixed with noise. The objective is to design circuits 
that are capable of detecting signals in an optimum manner. The theory relevant to this task is known 
as optimum filtering.5 A particular example will be presented here, whereby characteristics of a filter 
are desired that are capable of maximizing the ratio of signal to noise at its output. It is assumed that 
the input signal waveform is known and that the output signal is mixed with white noise.
Let us assume that the input voltage waveform is known, vin(t), and that its frequency spectrum is
() () ω = ω φ ω( ) V1 1 j V j  ej 1 (4.31)
The white noise at the input has a power spectrum W0. Let us also assume that the desired frequency 
response of the filter is
() () ω = ω φ ω( ) H j H j  ej (4.32)
The variance of the noise signal at the output of the filter is then given by Equation 4.33:
∫ σ = ( ) ω ω
W ∞
π 2 H j d 2 0
0
2
(4.33)
Maximizing the ratio of the output signal at a particular time t0 to the square root of the variance of 
the noise at the output requires the following filter frequency response:5
() () ω = ω − ω H j AVi j e * j t0 (4.34)
where A is a constant.
It can also be shown that the impulse response of the filter is h(t) = A V1 (t0 − t), i.e., it is, but for a 
scale factor, a mirror image of the input signal about the t = 0 axis, shifted by an amount of time t0. 
This type of filter is known as a “matched filter” as it is clearly matched to perform optimally for a 
particular input waveform. The output voltage due to v1(t) is given by the inverse Fourier transform 
of v2(jω) = H(jω) V1(jω), hence

The quantity on the right may be recognized from Equation 4.26 as the autocorrelation of the input 
signal, i.e.,
v t 2 v ( ) = − A R t 1 0 ( ) t (4.36)
Taking as an example the input waveform shown in Figure 4.8a, its autocorrelation function is then 
as shown in Figure 4.8b and the output signal as in Figure 4.8c, where it was chosen to maximize 
the ratio of signal to noise at the time the input waveform goes to zero (t0 = τd). Clearly, the output 
waveform for this matched filter is very different to the input waveform. The objective is maximiz￾ing the chances of detecting the signal from the noise and not its faithful reproduction. This situa￾tion typically occurs in radar applications. Using Equations 4.33 and 4.34 the variance of the noise 
at the output is found to be

4.4 THE RESPONSE OF NONLINEAR CIRCUITS
Nonlinear circuits are frequently used in engineering applications. Their main utility is to add to 
input signals other frequency components. Whereas in linear circuits the principle of superposition 
holds, the same cannot be said of nonlinear circuits. Thus, circuit analysis in nonlinear circuits is 
more difficult. A simple example is presented here to illustrate some of the solution principles and 
also introduce a particular circuit used often as a detector.
A circuit configuration used to detect signals is shown in Figure 4.9a. The circuit consists of 
a diode and charging (R − C) and discharging (Rl
−C) circuits. The load resistance is RL and R 
represents the diode forward resistance. The detector circuit may be given different characteristics 
by varying the relative magnitude of charging and discharging time constants. If, for instance, the 
charging time constant τc = RC is much larger than the discharging time constant τd = RLC, then the 
detector output is sensitive to the peak value of the input signal. If, however, this inequality does not 
hold, then the detector does not quite respond to the peak and it is described as a quasipeak detec￾tor. A low-pass filter after the detector produces an output proportional to the average of the signal. 
Similarly, modifications may be introduced to produce the rms value of the input signal.
For illustration purposes the response of the circuit shown in Figure 4.9a to a sinusoidal input 
signal of frequency ω0 and peak amplitude Vpk will be studied. Other cases are presented in detail 
in Reference 6. Let us assume that the DC component of the output current is I0. Then the voltage 
across the diode is VD = Vin−I0RL. Assuming an idealized diode characteristic, then charging cur￾rent flows during the period indicated by the hatched waveform in Figure 4.9b. The DC component 
of the current is related to the DC component of the hatched voltage waveform V′ by the expression 
I0 = V′/R. From Figure 4.9c it is clear that V0 = Vpk cos θ and hence θ = arc cos (V0/Vpk). Using 
Equation 4.7, the DC component V′ is obtained as shown below:

If the circuit parameters are such as to give, say, τD/τc = RL/R = 2400, then θ is very small then tan 
θ may be approximated by the first two terms in its Taylor series expansion
tan / θ θ  + θ 3 3
Substituting the above expression in Equation 4.38 gives
3πR/RL
1/3 θ = ( )
For the case chosen RL/R = 2400, it follows that θ = 0.158rad and therefore V0/Vpk = cos θ = 0.987. 
The DC component of the output voltage is virtually equal to the peak input voltage. The relation￾ship between the two time constants may be varied to give different characteristics to the detector. 
In EMC applications, peak and quasipeak detectors are common. The latter has a relatively short 
discharge time constant to produce a lower output for input pulses occurring infrequently. This is 
aimed at producing a measure of interference that is related to the relative annoyance caused to 
listeners of radio signals that are subject to frequent and infrequent pulses of similar magnitude. 
Descriptions of the different types of detector in use may be found in References 7 and 8.
4.5 CHARACTERIZATION OF NOISE
Noise may be due to many causes both external (e.g., galactic noise) and internal (e.g., Johnson 
noise) to a system. More details of the spectral properties of noise sources are given in Chapter 
5. Irrespective of the origins of noise, it is necessary to establish a set of parameters that allows 
quantitative results in regard to noise to be determined for a variety of networks. A more detailed 
description of noise and its characterization may be found in References 9 to 11. Let us first examine 
the noise that may be expected at the terminals of an antenna.
An antenna placed in an enclosure of temperature T is surrounded by a low-level electromagnetic 
field that is the result of random fluctuations.5 The flux of electromagnetic energy at a given point 
coming from a solid angle of one steradian is given by Planck’s formula and is12
( ) ( ) = − I f 2hf
u e 1
3
2 hf /K TB
(4.39)72 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
I(f) is given in units of Wm−2Hz−1 srad−1, f is the frequency, u the speed of light, and h = 6.626 ·10−34
J/Hz is Planck’s constant. In most practical cases hf≪KBT and therefore ehf/KB
T ≃ 1 + hf/KBT. 
Equation 4.39 thus reduces to
I f( )  2KBT/λ2 (4.40)
where λ is the wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh’s Law. Let the mean square value of the 
electric field strength per hertz be E = + E E + E , 2 x
2 y
2 z
2 where the right-hand side indicates the field 
contributions in each coordinate direction. On average these are expected to be at the same value, 
hence E = 3E . 2 z
2 The power flux associated with the EM field may be found from Poynting’s vector 
and for air is
= E
120π
E
40π .
2 z
2
The power flux per steradian is thus
E /160π . z
2 2
Equating this with the value obtained from Equation 4.40 gives for the z-directed electric field 
component
E 320 = λ π  K T/ z
2 2 B 2
For a short antenna of length l polarized in the z-direction, the induced voltage will be
V = = E  l 320π  K T( ) 1/λ 2 z
2 2 2 B 2
Substituting the radiation resistance for this dipole from Equation 2.68 gives
V = 4K TR ,inV /H 2 B rad 2 z (4.41)
This formula gives the square of the rms voltage per hertz appearing across the antenna terminals 
due to EM field fluctuations. The temperature T in this formula represents the regions of space 
through which EM waves propagate and ranges from a few degrees Kelvin to several thousand 
degrees in the direction of radio galaxies and is referred to as the antenna noise temperature. For an 
antenna with Rrad = 5 Ω, T = 20 K, and system bandwidth 30MHz, the rms noise voltage is 0.4 μV.
It turns out that, irrespective of the physical origin of the resistance, Equation 4.41 applies, where 
the temperature is that at which the particular resistance is kept (Johnson thermal noise). Although 
the rms value of thermal white noise is specified in Equation 4.41 and is V = 4K TR, rms B its instan￾taneous value varies statistically according to a Gaussian probability distribution. The probability 
that the instantaneous voltage lies between V and V + dV is

If a real resistor R is connected to a circuit that presents an input resistance Ri
, then some of the 
noise associated with R will couple to the circuit through Ri
. We may then represent the real resis￾tor R by an ideal noiseless resistor R in series with a noise source as shown in Figure 4.10 where 
we have indicated the RMS value measured over a bandwidth (BW). Maximum power transfer to Electrical Signals and Circuits 73
the load (Ri
 in this case) occurs when the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the source 
impedance. In the present case this corresponds to the condition Ri = R. Thus the maximum avail￾able noise power from the resistor R is

where BW is the bandwidth of the circuit (the noise power spectral density is KBT). If as an example 
we calculate the available noise power over a bandwidth of 1Hz at room temperature (say T = 290 
K) we obtain Pmax = 4×10−21 W. Referring to 1mW and expressing in decibels gives a maximum 
available power of

This is the minimum achievable noise level at room temperature (noise floor). This noise floor can 
only be reduced further by cooling equipment below room temperature. It is also pointed out that 
there are other sources of noise (in addition to thermal noise described above), hence the noise floor 
is likely to be even higher.
Every device or network used for signal processing receives the desired signal plus noise and pro￾duces at its output the modified signal plus noise. At each stage of this process the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) may be defined as
SNR 1 = 0 log
S
N
(4.43)
where S is the power associated with the signal and N is the power associated with noise. Clearly, 
a high signal-to-noise ratio guarantees good signal reception and detection. Which value of SNR is 
acceptable depends to a large extent on the application. For TV reception, values in excess of 40dB 
are required for good picture quality. For voice communication of good quality, values in excess of 
30 dB are required. It is considered just possible to establish communication between experienced 
operators at SNR values of 5 dB.
Every device, such as an amplifier, adds its own noise component to the signal and hence the 
signal-to-noise ratio at its input and output are not the same. A measure of the noise introduced by 
a device is given by its noise factor, defined as follows:

The noise figure of the device is defined as
Noise figure NF = 10 logF, dB (4.46)
A low-noise amplifier has typically a noise figure less than 3dB.
Another way to describe the noise added by a device is to assign to it an “effective noise tempera￾ture” Te. This is defined as the temperature of a fictitious additional source resistance connected at 
the input of the device that gives the same noise power at the output. The device is now assumed to 
be noiseless. Thus, the noise equivalent circuit of a device where the source impedance is Rs is as 
shown in Figure 4.11. From Equation 4.45 it can be seen that the noise factor and the noise tempera￾ture are related by the expression
F = +1 Te 0 /T (4.47)
where T0 is the temperature of the source resistance (usually the ambient temperature).
Example: An antenna has a noise temperature of 25 K and is connected to a receiver of noise 
temperature 30 K. Assuming that the minimum acceptable SNR at the output of the receiver is 
5dB, calculate the minimum acceptable signal power at the input of the receiver. A bandwidth of 
10kHz may be used in the calculation.
Solution: The noise factor of the receiver is
F =+ =+ 1 Te 0 /T 1 30/290 1.1 =
where T0 was taken as the ambient temperature 20°C. Hence,

Therefore, the minimum acceptable input signal power is 1.38×10−17 W.
It remains now to examine more carefully how the bandwidth of a system may be determined, 
specifically for noise calculations. If a wideband noise signal is applied to a frequency-selective 
network such as a filter or tuned amplifier, the spectrum of the noise at the output follows the shape 
of the frequency response of the networks. The question often raised is, what is an appropriate 
bandwidth (BW)n to use in calculating the total noise power at the output? This equivalent-noise 
bandwidth (BW)n is defined as the bandwidth of an idealized network with a rectangular response 
that produces the same noise power at the output as the real network. This is shown in Figure 4.12, 
where the condition mentioned above is met provided the two hatched areas are equal. It follows 
that if the input noise spectral power density is Wn (V2/Hz), then

or that the equivalent noise bandwidth of a network of frequency response H(jω) (peak value

Substituting in Equation 4.47 gives the following expression for the equivalent-noise bandwidth 
of an RC circuit
( ) BW n = l/( ) 4 RC (4.48)
FIGURE 4.12 Equivalent noise bandwidth.76 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
This should be compared with the bandwidth (BW) of this network defined as the point at which 
the frequency response falls to 1/ 2 of its peak value (3-dB point), which is (BW) = 1/2πRC. 
Hence, for this network
(BW) ( = ) π

The relationship between noise and normal bandwidths depends on the exact shape of H(jω). 
Equation 4.49, however, still holds, approximately, for a range of tuned networks with simple 
bell-shaped responses.
Example: Calculate the equivalent noise bandwidth and the noise voltage at the output of a tuned 
amplifier with resonant frequency 1MHz, quality factor Q = 50, and gain at resonance G = 60. 
Assume that white noise is injected at the input with W0 = 10−8V2/Hz and that Equation 4.49 holds 
for this network.
Solution: The bandwidth of the amplifier is

It follows that the rms value of the noise voltage at the output is 1.5V.
Example: Estimate the minimum detectable signal at the output of a system with a noise figure (NF) 
assuming that we need 3dB above noise for secure detection.
Solution: Let us assume thermal noise at the input Ns = KBT and that the system

General EMC Concepts and Techniques
In Part I, the basic techniques necessary for studying EMC were described. These may be applied 
to the study of specific problems that affect the EMC behavior of practical systems. A global view 
of EMC requires a study of the sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the first instance, 
so that general and specific threats may be identified for each application. The presence of EMI 
sources would not be a problem if suitable coupling paths to other circuits were not present. Hence, 
a study of these paths is necessary and it includes topics such as shielding, apertures, propagation 
and crosstalk, and coupling at the system level. Finally, the impact of EMI on devices and systems 
needs to be assessed so that realistic limits and safety margins may be established.
These topics are addressed in Part II using a variety of approaches, including simple intuitive 
models, analytical formulations, and advanced numerical simulation techniques. The material in 
the next five chapters is particularly relevant to the EMC analyst.

5 Sources of Electromagnetic 
Interference
The aim of this chapter is to describe the characteristics of the main sources of EM interference 
(EMI). The reader will be alerted to the great variety of EM threats and will be introduced to the 
basic qualitative and quantitative models describing their origin, magnitude, and spectral content.
5.1 CLASSIFICATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE SOURCES
A large number of sources contribute to the electromagnetic environment. Although in any given 
application normally only a few of these sources are significant, it is instructive to survey the entire 
range so that the reader is alerted to various possibilities and is therefore able to ask the right ques￾tions when an assessment of EM threats is made. It is undoubtedly difficult to be comprehensive in 
identifying sources of interference, as each application has its own special features. An astronomi￾cal measurement and a domestic electrical appliance are subject to similar EM threats but the domi￾nant design and operational factors are in each case very different. A broad classification of sources 
of EM interference is useful, however, as it offers a basis for a systematic study. As is natural, the 
criterion used for classification influences strongly the outcome of this exercise. Sources may be 
classified according to whether they are continuous or transient in nature. Clearly, in certain appli￾cations a transient source of interference may be acceptable, whereas continuous interference would 
be detrimental to the application. Similarly, sources may be intentional or unintentional in nature. 
An example of an intentional source is a broadcast radio transmitter, while the radiated interfer￾ence caused by a computer-to-computer digital signal communication line is clearly unintentional. 
Another possible classification is into broad- and narrow-band interference. A burst or spike-like 
disturbance has a broad frequency spectrum unlike, say, interference caused by a mains signal that 
is at 50 or 60Hz. A source of interference may be internal or external to a system. Interference 
caused by switching operation in a power system is internally generated, but phenomena due to 
lightning are due to sources external to the system. Many other criteria may be used to classify 
sources, but in this book EMI sources are classified into two broad categories, namely, those due to 
natural phenomena and those due to human activity.
5.2 NATURAL ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE SOURCES
Human activity, as we understand it, takes place almost exclusively very near the surface of an 
insignificant planet. It should therefore come as no surprise that this environment is subject to elec￾tromagnetic fields that can originate from great distances. We describe these as natural fields. They 
are grouped in this section under the heading of low-frequency, lightning, and high-frequency fields.
5.2.1  Low-Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields
It may appear at first sight that low-frequency (LF) fields are of no interest to EMC studies. 
Undoubtedly, coupling to these fields is generally weak except for particular types of instrument. 
There are, however, some situations where LF fields may cause significant effects. The geomag￾netic field is known to all and may be regarded as due to a magnetic dipole with one pole near 
Antarctica and the other in North America. Both the position of the poles and the strength of the 
field are subject to variations. A typical average value is H=30A/m. Variations of this field over a 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-782 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
period of hours are described as magnetic storms and they generate an associated electric field. It is 
believed that these storms are related to the sun’s activity. Although these fields are small in engi￾neering terms, they may nevertheless cause undesirable effects in large exposed networks. Varying 
magnetic fields induce potential differences on the earth’s surface (typically 1 to 10 V/km) that can 
drive current through the neutrals of earthed transformers. Currents as high as 100 A have been 
measured. The effect of these currents is to drive power and current transformers into saturation, 
thus causing severe difficulties in the protection arrangements of power systems. Further details, 
and a description of the effects of a particular geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 13, 1989, 
may be found in Reference 1.
At a distance of approximately ten earth radii major distortions to the dipole magnetic field are 
observed (earth’s magnetosphere). These are the result of the interaction between particles traveling 
from the sun (solar wind) and the geomagnetic field.1,2
Under normal fair weather conditions, an electric field of average value of about 100V/m can 
be measured at the earth’s surface. It is pointing downward, indicating a negatively charged earth. 
With increasing height the electric field decreases as air becomes more and more ionized. At a 
height of approximately 50km, the electrical conductivity is so high as to permit us to describe the 
earth’s surface as the inner electrode of a giant spherical capacitor with the highly ionized layer at 
approximately 50km as the outer electrode. The drift of ions between these electrodes contributes 
under fair weather conditions a total current of about 1500 A to the earth’s surface. Clearly, such a 
situation, if continued, would result in a change to the electric charge balance on the earth. Charge 
balance is maintained, however, by an opposite current that flows during electrical storms.3
A small electric field of the order of a few millivolts per kilometer is also observed in the earth’s 
crust (tellurian electric field). Values depend on latitude, time, and soil properties and increase sub￾stantially during magnetic storms.4
5.2.2  Lightning
Lightning is one of the most energetic of all electromagnetic phenomena. During the lightning 
phenomenon, the potential difference between earth and thunderclouds is of the order of 100 MV 
and the charge transfer is of the order of 20C. Hence, energies of the order of 1010J are potentially 
in transit during electrical storms.5 Details of lightning may be found in specialist literature on the 
subject. A simple phenomenological description of lightning is as follows. Through complex pro￾cesses, charge separation takes place in thunderclouds so that an excess of negative charge is estab￾lished near their base. Field enhancement and the resulting ionization result in an ionized channel 
that proceeds in steps (stepped leader) toward the earth as shown schematically in Figure 5.1. As 
the stepped leader approaches the earth, it causes an upward positive streamer. When the two meet, 
a highly conducting ionized channel is formed through which a very high current flows (the return 
stroke). Return stroke currents can be very high. In approximately 10% of all events, the stroke cur￾rent exceeds 40 kA, and in about 1% of all cases, currents in excess of 100 kA are observed. The 
current pulse has a rise-time typically 1 μsec and a decay time of 50 μsec. The number of strokes in 
any locality may be estimated from the following empirical formula

 (5.1)
Hence in the United Kingdom, where typically thunder is heard on about 15 days a year, about two 
strokes per km2 should be expected in this period. Two types of lightning effects may be distin￾guished. First, there are direct effects whereby the attachment of lightning to a structure such as a 
building or aircraft may cause mechanical damage, fires, or explosions. Second, there are indirect 
effects whereby the rapid current variations during lightning induce significant interference signals Sources of EMI 83
on adjacent circuits and structures. It is this latter case that is of most interest to EMC. Of particular 
concern is the lightning threat to airborne systems. Measurements on aircraft indicate field values 
of the order of 600A/m and 50 kV/m and a rate of rise of current of the order of 150 kA/μsec.6
Recent measurements indicate that rise-times as short as a few nanoseconds are not uncommon. 
Measurements of the spectrum of the electrical field normalized to a distance of 1 mile are shown 
in Figure 5.2.7 Further information on the lightning threat may be found in References 8 and 9. 
Comparisons of lightning with other electromagnetic threats [e.g., nuclear electromagnetic pulse 
(NEMP) and electrostatic discharge (ESD)] may be found in References 10 and 11. 
Lightning is a complex and very severe threat, especially for flying systems, with large statistical 
variations, and therefore arrangements for testing were developed over the years for the lightning 
certification of aircraft. These are based on idealized current test waveforms, a classification of 
effects into direct and indirect, and zoning concepts.
The standard test waveform shown in Figure 5.3 consists of four components, A representing 
the initial stroke (peak current 200 kA, action integral 2×106 A2s, rise-time 25 μs, and duration 
500 μs), B representing an intermediate current (average amplitude 2 kA transferring charge of 
10C), C representing a continuing current (amplitude 100s of amperes, charge transfer 200C), and 
D representing a restrike current pulse (current peak 100 kA, action integral 0.25×106 A2s). The 
action integral is defined as ∫ i2 dt and is a measure of the energy dissipated in resistive parts in the 
path of lightning (responsible for direct current effects). In contract, indirect effects (e.g., inductive 
coupling) are dependent on the current and its rate of change. The zoning of aircraft is an attempt 
to identify parts of its structure most likely to be lightning attachment points. Zone 1 refers to parts 
with a high probability of attachment (e.g., wing tips, nose, engine nacelle, etc.). Following initial 
attachment and because of aircraft movement the lightning channel is swept along its surface over 
areas that constitute Zone 2. Finally all other remaining areas are classed as Zone 3. International 
regulations determine which test current waveforms (A, B, etc.) are applicable to each zone.
The increasing use of carbon fiber composites (CFC) in aircraft manufacture because of their 
strength and low weight has nevertheless enhanced the importance of lightning as a source of inter￾ference with aircraft systems (indirect effects) and also direct effects such as rupture of CFC skins, 
etc. In a nonmetal skinned aircraft the lightning current path is difficult to establish as it may be 
significantly affected by local features such as fastenings and other conducting structural members. 
FIGURE 5.1 Schematic of a lightning discharge.84 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Similarly, indirect effects can be more severe as the EM shielding afforded by the CFC is inferior to 
that of aluminum. One can see that significant voltage drops appear across the CFC surface that may 
contribute to common mode voltage on adjacent circuits. Taking the resistivity of CFC as 3500×10−8
Ωm and its thickness as 1mm we obtain its surface resistivity (the ratio of voltage drop per unit length

to current per unit width), ρ/h=335 mΩ/sq. Hence, a 100-kA peak current will induce a voltage drop 
of 3500V/m. The situation will be very different if Al was used (ρ=2.8×10−8 Ωm).
The EM generated by the lightning channel some distance away may be obtained by consider￾ing the channel as an antenna where the current distribution is time and space varying. The current 
need only be known to obtain the vector potential and then the scalar potential is obtained from the 
Lorentz gauge condition (see Section 2.2.2). With the two potentials known, the EM field is obtained 
from Equations 2.34 and 2.35. Details of such calculations may be found in References 12–14.
5.2.3  High-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields
High-frequency fields in the range below about 30MHz are due mainly to terrestrial processes such 
as electrical storms described earlier and are referred to generally as “static” or “sferics.” There are 
wide seasonal and topographical variations. In general, fields are higher during the night and near 
the equator, and decrease with frequency. For frequencies higher than about 30MHz the dominant 
contribution to the field is extraterrestrial (cosmic) in origin. The earth’s magnetosphere, ionosphere, 
and atmosphere form a partial EM shield to fields originating from outside the earth’s environ￾ment. At the earth’s surface only fields that can penetrate these layers are observed. Penetration is 
only possible at optical frequencies (infrared to UV) and at radio frequencies between 10MHz and 
37GHz. The radio frequency passband of interest to EMC is determined by the shielding properties 
of the ionosphere and absorption by water molecules. The sources of cosmic radiation are in the gal￾axies (strongest near the center) and in the sun. It has been estimated that each galaxy emits about 
1035 W in the range 10MHz to 10GHz with a large thermal component, but also particular emis￾sions at specific frequencies (e.g., hydrogen at 1.428GHz). Solar radiation consists of a background 
level (during a quiet sun), on which are superimposed slow variations (period 27 days), which in the 
range 1 to 10GHz may exceed the background value by a factor of three, and radio bursts (flares), 
which can last from a few seconds to hours with intensities higher by a factor of a thousand com￾pared to background levels.
Due to the statistical nature and wide dependence on location, it is difficult to give specific 
values for these fields. Surveys of natural background radio noise usually quote results in terms of 
an equivalent or effective antenna noise factor Fa in decibels. Thus, at 10MHz a typical value for 
atmospheric noise is Fa=40dB, while at 100MHz galactic noise dominates and contributes approxi￾mately 8dB.15 The peak value of the electric field received by a short vertical dipole antenna may be 
found from Fa using the following formula, which is derived in Appendix E.
E( ) dB  Vµ = /m F d a ( ) B 1 + + 0 log( ) BW 20 log f( ) MHz − 95.5 (5.2)
where BW is the bandwidth of the receiver in hertz and f is the frequency in megahertz. Further 
details of the spectral content of natural radio noise are presented in Section 5.4.
5.3 MAN-MADE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE SOURCES
The operation of man-made engineering devices makes an increasingly larger contribution to the 
electromagnetic environment. This may be regarded as a form of pollution and it is expected that 
increasingly closer attention will be paid to reducing and controlling electromagnetic emissions. A 
survey of the main sources of man-made EM emissions is given below.
5.3.1  Radio Transmitters
This is a form of intentional man-made emission. Mobile and fixed transmitters, radar, and com￾puter-to-computer communications are continuously increasing in numbers, power, and geographi￾cal distribution. International regulatory bodies allocate fixed frequency bands for the different types 86 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
of application. An example of allocation in the United Kingdom is shown in Table 5.1.16 Clearly, in 
frequency bands allocated to broadcast transmitters, substantial signal strength may be expected, 
the exact value depending on the power of the transmitter, the distance from the transmitter, and 
the proximity of other bodies (e.g., buildings, transmission lines, etc.). Typical urban environment 
electric field strength due to broadcast transmitters rarely exceeds 200 mV/m. However, near power￾ful transmitters field strengths of several tens of V/m are possible. Estimates obtained from 250-kW 
transmitters at a distance of 100m range from 87V/m at 4MHz to 272V/m at 26MHz.17 Although 
these emissions are narrowband, interference is also observed at harmonics of the carrier frequency, 
at sideband frequencies, and there may also be a broadband noise contribution from the various 
stages inside the transmitter. In a well- designed transmitter, harmonics and noise are well below, 
typically, 70dB, the strength at the fundamental frequency.
5.3.2 Electroheat Applications
A valuable means of heating materials is by using high-frequency signals. In cases where the speci￾men is highly conducting, heating takes place by inducing currents to it (induction heating), whereas 
for materials that are poor conductors heating takes place by generating dielectric losses (dielectric 
heating). Typical frequencies used for induction heating are 1 to 100 KHz, 1MHz, whereas for dielec￾tric heating, operating frequencies are selected from the following list: 13.560MHz, 27.12MHz, 
40.68MHz, 433MHz, 915MHz, 2.45GHz, and 5.8GHz. Power ratings of several kilowatts are typi￾cal. Measurements taken at 30m away from such heaters have shown average electric field values 
typically 100 (dB μV/m)18. Harmonics of the operating frequency of domestic microwave ovens have 
also been investigated as a source of interference at broadcast satellite frequencies (Table 5.1).19
5.3.3  Digital Signal Processing and Transmission
Modern digital signal processing and transmission methods use fast pulses to code information. 
Processing, storage, input, and output take place continuously synchronized to an electronic clock. 
The requirement for higher processing speeds and higher rates of information transfer implies high 
clock rates and therefore shorter transition times (fall- and rise-times). Clock rates of several hun￾dreds of megahertz and transition times of a few nanoseconds are common. The presence of fast 
pulses on printed circuit boards and transfers across communication cables can give rise to radiation 
and coupling (crosstalk) to adjacent circuits. As indicated in Appendix D, a trapezoidal pulse having 
a duration τ and equal rise- and fall-times τr
 has an approximately flat spectrum extending up to a

frequency 1/πτ. Thereafter the spectrum falls by −20 dB/decade up to a frequency 1/πτr
. Beyond 
this frequency, the spectrum falls by −40 dB/decade. It is therefore evident that substantial power is 
associated with harmonics of the fundamental frequency and that the highest significant harmon￾ics are determined by the transition time of the pulse waveform. Fast transition times, although 
desirable from the operation point of view, are undesirable in EMC terms as they make substantial 
contributions to high-order harmonics. Significant amounts of power are found at harmonics that 
may be at frequencies twenty times or higher above the fundamental. Estimates of radiated noise 
for different logic families may be found in Reference 20.
Example: Obtain the envelope of the spectrum for the signal shown in Figure 5.4a and then 
repeat the calculation by changing the transition time to 200 ns. Duty cycle is 50% and f=50 kHz. 
Calculate the interference voltage at 3MHz for the two values of rise-time.
Solution: Following Appendix D, the envelope of the spectrum is as shown in Figure 5.4b. We 
need to calculate the values A1 and A2 and the frequency breakpoints fb1 and fb2. We have

5.3.4  Power Conditioning and Transmission
The power supply network is the source and the victim of electromagnetic interference. Although a 
very high quality of supply is normally maintained, a whole range of signals and disturbances are 
established on extensive and partially exposed power networks. The presence and the quality of this 
network, which by its nature is all pervasive, are of great interest to EMC. A broad legal framework 
exists in most countries, which defines the maximum variation of voltage and frequency (e.g., 240 
V±6%, 50 Hz±1% in the United Kingdom). However, most power utilities maintain a tighter con￾trol of their network and impose additional requirements on the quality of the supply. Increasingly, 
EMC-related regulations impose additional constraints.
A survey of EMC in power systems may be found in Reference 21 and broadly the same clas￾sification is used here.
5.3.4.1 Low-Frequency Conducted Interference
Harmonics — Due to the presence of converter equipment,22 nonlinear devices such as trans￾formers23 and arc furnaces24 in power systems, sinusoidal voltages, and currents are gener￾ated with frequencies that are multiples (harmonics) of the fundamental mains frequency 
(50 or 60Hz). As an example, a converter contributes signals at harmonic frequencies that 
are a multiple n of the mains frequency
n    = ± mp   1
where m = 1, 2, 3, … and p is the converter pulse number p = 6, 12, ….The voltage total 
harmonic distortion is defined as
VTHD 100

(5.3)
Some of the undesirable effects of harmonics are interference with communications, over￾heating, maloperation of instrumentation, control and protection systems,25 and torque pul￾sations in motors. The level of harmonics varies throughout the day. Of particular concern 
is the level of the 5th harmonic where values as high as 6% of the nominal voltage have 
been observed.26Sources of EMI 89
Voltage fluctuations — Small changes in the voltage as the result of connection and discon￾nection of loads are referred to as fluctuations or flicker. The latter term is to indicate the 
effect that these changes have on the luminosity of incandescent lamps. A 27% fluctuation 
is considered acceptable provided it does not occur more than once a minute, whereas a 
fluctuation occurring ten times per minute should not exceed 1.3%.
Voltage dips — Sudden reductions in the supply voltage (more than 10%) followed by recov￾ery within a short time (typically 300 msec) are common in supply networks. Surveys have 
shown that the causes of these dips and occasional interruptions originate in the medium￾and high-voltage networks.27 Most of the dips do not exceed 30%. It is estimated that for a 
consumer in an urban environment, there are about four dips per month that exceed 10% of 
the nominal voltage. Dips are caused by faults, the switching of large loads, and the start￾ing of induction motors. Dips and interruptions cause problems to data processing equip￾ment and may require restarting and proper sequencing of motors and automatic processes.
Unbalance — The presence of large single-phase loads and the unequal loading of each 
phase in a three-phase system may cause an inbalance in amplitude and/or phase. Some 
motors may overheat if supplied by an unbalanced source. In practice, unbalance is kept 
below 2%.
Mains signaling systems — The power network is primarily intended for the transmission of 
power to consumers. It is nevertheless possible to transmit information that is used for con￾trol (public lighting), load management, and tariff fixing. Mains signaling uses relatively 
high frequencies and networks not specifically intended for signal transmission. There 
are, therefore, EMC implications, especially since the use of mains signaling is likely to 
increase in the future. Three types may be distinguished, namely, ripple control systems 
(100Hz to 5 KHz, amplitude 5% of the nominal voltage), power-line carrier systems (up 
to 100 kHz, amplitude 2.5% of the nominal voltage), and home signaling systems used by 
individual consumers. The EMC implications of using the power network for digital signal 
transmission are discussed in Reference 28.
Other lower-frequency effects — Voltages may be induced from adjacent circuits, espe￾cially during transient conditions, DC components may be present if half-wave rectifiers 
are used, and small variations in frequency may be present, normally not exceeding 1 Hz/s.
5.3.4.2 Low-Frequency Radiated Interference
Stray electric and magnetic fields due to power lines and domestic appliances are subject to a vari￾ety of limits in various countries. These are normally set with biological effects in mind. At power 
frequencies electric fields not exceeding 30 kV/m (industrial environment and near power lines) and 
0.3 kV/m near domestic appliances may be expected. Magnetic field values rarely exceed 1 mT in 
industrial environments and 100 μT near domestic appliances and cables.21,29 Much medical appa￾ratus is sensitive to magnetic fields that are a fraction of a microtesla and video display units exhibit 
flicker when the magnetic field is of the order of a few microtesla.
Low-frequency electric fields at harmonics of the power frequency have been studied near 500kV 
transmission lines and are reported in Reference 30. Values ranging from 13 mV/m at 15 kHz to 130 
μV/m at 200kHz have been measured. Global measurements of natural background radio noise at 
power frequencies and contributions made by power lines are reported in References 31 and 32.
5.3.4.3 High-Frequency Conducted Interference
Voltage spikes in LV networks — A variety of faults and switching operations and lightning strikes 
on power networks result in a number of spikes (typically ten per day exceeding 200V) appearing at 
the domestic consumer level. A number of surveys are available aiming to establish statistical data 
for spike amplitude and frequency of occurrence. A thorough discussion appears in Reference 33. 
About 2% of spikes exceed 500V and about one in a thousand exceeds 3000V. The duration of most 
spikes does not exceed a few microseconds, indicating a bandwidth of a few hundred kilohertz. 90 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Less than one in a thousand have a duration exceeding 100 μsec. Direct lightning strokes generate 
overvoltages of the order of 100 kV. These are attenuated as they propagate through the network but 
surges of several kilovolts in magnitude can be expected at domestic consumer level.
Voltage surges in high-voltage (HV) substations — A substation is a harsh electromagnetic envi￾ronment, the most severe problems from the EMC point of view being the operation of disconnect 
switches. With proper control and protection measures, voltage surges do not normally exceed a 
few thousand volts. A survey of the substation EM environment appears in Reference 34. In modern 
gas-insulated substations (GIS) where SF6 is used as the insulating medium, faster switching times 
are obtained with the result that steep-fronted transients with rise-times of the order of 10 to 20 nsec 
and a rate-of-rise as high as 40 MV/μsec are generated.35 These surges, in addition to the insulation 
problems they cause, also have undesirable EMC effects.
5.3.4.4 High-Frequency Radiated Interference
Significant radiated fields are measured near substations during switching operations. Electric fields 
as high as 70 kV/m with frequency components in excess of 200MHz have been observed. In a 
conventional substation the data shown in Table 5.2 are regarded as typical.34,36
Field measurements near a HV DC converter station have been reported in Reference 37. A 
detailed discussion of EMC in power plants and substations may be found in the CIGRE Guide.38
5.3.5  Switching Transients
Many of the particular examples of interference-generating phenomena, outlined in the last two sec￾tions, can be understood by reference to fundamental principles. Many other interference sources, 
which have not been explicitly mentioned here, can be similarly understood. It is therefore impor￾tant to present and illustrate these principles in a manner that allows proper characterization of 
known interference sources and also permits the identification of new ones. This task is tackled in 
this section.
5.3.5.1 Nature and Origin of Transients
Although a lot of interference is due to the operation of circuits in steady state, some of the most 
severe cases of EMI are due to transients that are externally imposed on systems, or those generated 
internally as a result of normal functional requirements, or in response to abnormal conditions (faults). 
In an electrical circuit operating under steady-state conditions, energy is stored in particular compo￾nents such as capacitors and inductors. Any change in circuit conditions, irrespective of its origin or 
purpose, requires a redistribution of this energy. Capacitors store energy associated with electric fields.
A capacitor C with a potential difference V across its plates stores an amount of energy given by

Any redistribution of energy in a circuit, whether described by lumped components or more gener￾ally distributed components, cannot be done instantaneously. This is a fundamental law of physics, 
and it implies that during a period of time, however short, potentially large amounts of energy are 
in transit throughout the circuit. During this period the circuit is described as being under transient 
conditions. It is important to realize that during this time the values of voltage and current in the 
different parts of the circuit bear little direct relationship to their steady-state values prior to or after 
the change. Under these circumstances, overcurrents, over-voltages, and rather fast pulses are not 
uncommon and these influence EMC behavior decisively.
A qualitative grasp of these phenomena may be achieved by recalling that a capacitor is a com￾ponent that resists rapid voltage changes. Any attempt to force a high rate of change of voltage (dv/
dt) results in a very high current. Similarly, an inductor is a component that resists rapid current 
changes. Any attempt to force a high rate of change of current (di/dt) results in a very high voltage. 
Improvements in EMC performance are very often achieved by controlling the rate of change of 
these quantities under all conceivable (normal and abnormal) conditions. Some examples of how 
circuits respond to change are given in the next two subsections.
5.3.5.2 Circuit Behavior during Switching Assuming an Idealized Switch
It is perhaps necessary before proceeding further, to state clearly what is meant by an “idealized 
switch.” Let us assume, to start with, that when the switch is conducting (on) it presents zero imped￾ance, whereas when it is not conducting (off) it presents infinite impedance. It is stressed that this 
behavior is neither available from practical switches, nor, in fact, desirable. This latter point will be 
demonstrated shortly after a few examples have been studied first. Let us examine what happens 
when an inductor is connected to an AC source, as shown in Figure 5.5a (closing transient in an 
inductor). It is assumed that the switch is closed at the instant in time when the source voltage has 
zero value and is rising. Neglecting the influence of losses (R → 0) voltage balance in this circuit 
requires that

where N and ϕ are the number of turns and the magnetic flux associated with the coil. Integrating 
this equation gives

where K is a constant.
Assuming that at t = 0 (the moment the switch closes) there was no remanent magnetic flux linked 
with the coil (ϕ(0) = 0) allows K to be calculated giving92 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
φ( )t 1 = φpk ( ) − ω cos t ( ) (5.10)
where ϕpk=Vpk/(ωN) is the peak steady-state magnetic flux in the coil. This expression is plotted 
in Figure 5.5b and it shows that the maximum excursion of the flux is to 2ϕpk, twice as large as the 
value expected under steady-state conditions. In most cases this flux corresponds to a value deep in 
the saturation region of the material used in the construction of the coil and hence it results in a cur￾rent that is highly distorted and of a very large peak value, as shown schematically in Figure 5.5c. 
The waveform shown in this figure is rich in harmonics and therefore contributes to EMC problems. 
The situation is even worse if it cannot be assumed that the remanent flux is negligible. This calcu￾lation describes the worst case (losses and a different point-on-wave for switch closure result in a 
less severe, damped, transient). However, it is not uncommon for the peak magnetizing current of 
unloaded transformers to exceed, occasionally, twenty times normal values.
A transient of particular interest is that associated with opening an inductive circuit (Figure 5.5a). 
Even for this simple case no progress can be made in obtaining the response of the circuit without 
some explanation of the properties of the switch. Three possible scenarios are shown in Figure 5.6. 
In each case the switch is opened at time t0 but the subsequent circuit behavior is different.
In case (a) the current I0 is brought down to zero instantaneously. Notwithstanding the difficul￾ties of engineering such a switch, it is interesting to speculate what will happen to the energy stored 
in the inductance 1

2
LI 

 

 just prior to time t0. Clearly, it cannot remain there since there can be 
no current through L. This is a classic case where the circuit shown in Figure 5.3a is not, even 
approximately, a reasonable model of the physical system. Neglecting losses again for clarity, the 
model can be improved considerably by adding the “stray” capacitance C shown in Figure 5.7. This 
capacitance could be that associated with the coil, bushing (if the coil is of a substantial high-voltage 
construction), the switch open contacts, connecting wires, etc. Assuming that the voltage across C 
FIGURE 5.5 Closing transient on an inductor (a). Flux (b) and current (c) waveforms.Sources of EMI 93
is small prior to the switch opening, then at t0 the circuit to the right of the switch consists of an 
inductor with energy 1

 and a capacitor that is approximately uncharged. This circuit will 
undergo oscillations with a frequency equal to 1

π LC. The peak value of the voltage Vpk across 
the coil and the capacitor can be estimated easily from energy conservation considerations. If losses 
are neglected, then when the current through the coil is zero, all the energy is stored as electrostatic 
energy, i.e.,

Hence,
V I L
C pk 0 = (5.12)
Two aspects of this calculation warrant attention. First, the frequency of the oscillations in the 
L-C circuit is totally unrelated to normal operational specifications, such as the source frequency 
and, therefore, in principle, a very different oscillation frequency should be expected depending on 
construction methods and layout (value of C). Second, the magnitude of the peak voltage is totally 
unrelated to the source voltage. If the stray capacitance is very small, Vpk can have very large values 
that may cause flash-over across L and/or sparking across the switch contacts. In either case there 
are serious EMC implications.
FIGURE 5.6 Current interruption, abrupt (a), gradual (b), and at the next current zero (c).
FIGURE 5.7 Opening transient in an inductive circuit.94 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Let us now examine case (b) in Figure 5.6 where the current is brought down more gradually 
from value I0 at t0 to zero at t1. A linear variation is shown but in practice an exponential decay is 
normally obtained. Clearly, a switch so designed creates fewer problems for insulation and EMC. 
The rate of current decay is better defined and can be controlled so that any overvoltages can be 
kept within specified limits, i.e., V = L Δi/Δt where Δt = t1−t0. This case is described in more detail 
in the next subsection.
Finally, a switch may be designed so that in spite of contact separation (tripping) at t0, the cur￾rent is not effectively interrupted until time t2 corresponding to the next available natural current 
zero (Figure 5.6c). This is clearly a case where overvoltages are minimized, since no energy is left 
stored in L to cause further oscillations. In practice it is difficult to achieve interruption exactly at 
t2 and effectively the situation is not dissimilar to that shown in Figure 5.4a, but with I0 being very 
small. The current at which the switching arc becomes unstable prior to the current zero is known 
as the chopping current and in a well-designed, highpower switch is equal to a few amperes. As an 
example, the interruption of the HV current in an unloaded 1000 kVA 11/3.3 kV power transformer 
is studied. The value of L is approximately 14H and C (mainly associated with the HV bushing) 
is 5000 pF. The “surge impedance” of this coil is therefore L/C 5  0 k . Ω Assuming a chopping 
current of 1.5 A results in a peak voltage 1.5×50×103=75kV. This is considerably higher than the 
operating voltage of this transformer and illustrates the problem of interrupting inductive circuits. 
When losses are considered and when remanent flux is taken into account the problem appears less 
severe. For example, if only 50% of the coil energy is recoverable (the remainder is associated with 
the remanent flux), then Equation 5.12 is modified to give
Vpk = 0.63 I0   L/C
The switch characteristic shown in Figure 5.6a is not practically achievable, that shown in Figure 5.6b 
is typical of switching at low voltages (e.g., fuses), and the characteristic shown in Figure 5.6c is typical 
of high-power circuit breakers.
Let us now examine the case of the opening transient in a capacitive circuit. A typical circuit is 
shown in Figure 5.8a. It is assumed that the current is cleared at a natural current zero (t0) as shown 
in Figure 5.8b. The source voltage VA is also shown and it is clear that for t>t0 the potential of point 
B remains constant at −Vpk. The potential difference across the switch is therefore Vsw =VA −VB as 
shown in Figure 5.8b. The maximum excursion of Vsw is to 2Vpk, thus causing substantial stress on 
the insulation of the switch. Should the switch fail under these circumstances and reignite, thus 
reestablishing conduction, fast oscillations will occur with any circuit inductance, as was the case 
FIGURE 5.8 Opening transient in a capacitive circuit (a). The voltage across the switch Vsw = VA−VB is 
shown in heavy outline in (b).Sources of EMI 95
for the inductive transient described earlier, but now with the initial energy store provided by the 
capacitor. Again, as before, there are important implications for EMC.
All the transients described above were studied using lumped circuit components. The situation 
is similar in principle, but considerably more complicated, when distributed parameter circuits are 
involved. For example, interrupting the charging current of an unloaded transmission line is similar 
to opening a capacitive circuit but with the added complication of the presence of traveling waves 
and reflections. Further information on transients and parameter values for transient calculations 
may be found in Reference 39.
5.3.5.3 Circuit Behavior during Switching Assuming a Realistic Model of the Switch
Switching elements, whether of the solid-state type or electromechanical, exhibit complex behavior. 
In most cases the user of such components has a limited grasp of their full operational features 
and even the specialist is hindered by the lack of well-documented, easily accessible information 
essential for modeling such components. Switch behavior is crucial in EMC studies. Three domains 
are important in the operation of a switch. First, switch behavior prior to actual current clearance; 
second, behavior around the point when the current is cleared; and third, its behavior after current 
clearance as it fully recovers its dielectric strength.
Let us first examine how current is cleared in a low-voltage circuit. The DC circuit shown in 
Figure 5.9a is studied. It is assumed that initially CB is closed and that steady-state conditions have 
been established. The electromechanical circuit breaker CB is tripped at t = 0 and it is assumed that 
the voltage drop across the arc is equal to VCB and remains constant until the current is brought to 
zero. The time taken to clear this circuit is required together with the voltage VL across the induc￾tor. The circuit may be solved using Laplace transforms with the operational equivalent shown in 
Figure 5.9b. The Laplace transform of the current is found to be

The waveforms for VCB, i, and VL are sketched in Figure 5.9c. Clearly, the arcing voltage must be 
higher than Vd to effect current clearance. If VCB =1.1 Vd then tc ≃ 2.4 (L/R). The magnitude and 
duration of the inductive voltage drop are crucially dependent on the arcing voltage. In practice the 
behavior of the switch during arcing is considerably more complex,40,41 but the simple calculation 
above illustrates the essential features of switching.
Let us now examine in more detail how a practical electromechanical switch may behave follow￾ing current interruption. A typical circuit that illustrates the essential parties to this phenomenon 
is shown in Figure 5.10. Following the parting of the contacts, the current ICB through the switch 
consists of two parts. First, there is component I1, which is due to the power source. In the short 
FIGURE 5.10 Circuit used to study arc reignition (a) and current components at power and high frequencies (b).Sources of EMI 97
time after interruption of interest to this study, the source voltage may be considered to remain 
approximately constant, at its value at the moment of interruption Vs(0). Hence I1 is approximately 
equal to Vs(0)t/(L1+L2). Second, there will be a high- frequency component I2, which is oscillatory 
in nature and is due to the redistribution of energy trapped in the energy storage circuit elements. 
The frequency of this component is very high compared with that of the source. Both components 
are sketched in Figure 5.10b. It is clear that there are moments, such as t3, when the switch current 
Isw is equal to zero. The voltage VCB, which appears across the switch, is similarly affected by high￾frequency voltages. Following contact separation at t0 and current clearance, say, at t1, the circuit 
breaker recovers its dielectric strength relatively rapidly. The breaker recovery voltage shown by a 
broken line in Figure 5.11a illustrates this recovery. Following current interruption at t1 a transient 
voltage appears across the breaker, as shown schematically by curve AB. At time t2, the voltage 
applied to the breaker is about to exceed the level that can be sustained across the contacts. The 
breaker then reignites and conduction is reestablished. The breaker circuit is now made up of com￾ponents I1 and I2 as explained earlier, and goes through zero at time t3 as shown in Figure 5.11b. 
At this point the breaker may be able to clear the current again. The transient voltage difference 
across the breaker will then increase as shown by CD in Figure 5.11a. Another reignition is likely 
at time t4 with a further current clearance at t5. This process may be repeated several times until the 
breaker has recovered sufficiently to sustain the maximum applied transient voltage. More details 
FIGURE 5.11 Breaker recovery and reignition (a) and breaker current (b).98 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
of calculations involving switching phenomena may be found in References 39, 42, and 43. The 
phenomenon just described is referred to in the literature as “showering arc” and it is capable of 
producing EMI in the megahertz range. Further details may be found in References 44, 45, and 46.
Another manifestation of the same phenomenon, but without the involvement of a circuit breaker, 
is the so-called “arcing ground.” This is particularly important in ungrounded systems where a fault 
to ground combines with high-frequency transients involving capacitances to earth to produce a 
series of fault arc extinctions and reignitions.39,47
5.3.6  The Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
Large material bodies are to a high degree electrically neutral. However, charge separation and 
charging can take place when two bodies, of which at least one is insulating, come into contact and 
subsequently separate. This is known as the triboelectric effect and it is one of the oldest known of 
electrical phenomena.48 Some materials have a propensity to acquire electrons on contact, whereas 
others give away electrons easily. The former tend to charge negatively, whereas the latter tend to 
acquire positive charge. Materials may be placed in a triboelectric series according to their tendency 
to charge positively or negatively. An example is shown in Table 5.3.
Charging may also occur by induction whereby a charged body A causes charge separation in a 
neutral body B. Temporary grounding of B causes some of its charge to leak away, thus leaving B 
charged. The typical process involved is the charging of an insulator and the subsequent discharge 
(ESD) through a conductor to another conductor, which may be grounded. The most common prob￾lem is that of the charging of humans brought about by walking on low electrical conductivity materi￾als (carpets). It has been found that the human body can charge to a potential often exceeding 10kV. 
A phenomenological description of ESD in this case is as follows: Due to the triboelectric effect the 
shoes are left with negative charge. By induction, charge separation takes place in the body so that 
the lower extremities are positively charged and the upper body extremities are negatively charged. 
On approaching another body, an intense electric field is established that may result in an ESD. It 
has been found that the discharge has a shorter rise-time for faster approach and for lower voltage.
An approximate equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 5.12a. Component Cb represents the body 
capacitance to ground (typically 150 pF) and Rb the body resistance (typically 1.5 kΩ). Due to 
triboelectric effects Cb may be charged to several kilovolts. When A is brought into contact with a

grounded conducting body, the capacitor discharges, thus causing the flow of current, which results 
in conducted and radiated interference. An improved model is shown in Figure 5.12b where a small 
inductance Lb has been added and branch B–C is a model of the human hand. The discharge current 
has a fast rise-time component (less than 1 nsec) due to branch B–C and a slower component (100 
nsec) due to branch B–G. Peak currents of several tens of amperes are typical. Measurements and 
analytical results of radiated fields due to ESD were reported in Reference 49. An electric field value 
of 75V/m was measured at a distance of 1.5m from a 2-kV ESD. Electrostatic charging problems 
are also observed in airborne systems, e.g., satellites.50
The fast rise-time pulses due to ESD may interfere with clock transitions in digital circuits and 
thus cause upsets and malfunctions.
5.3.7  The Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (NEMP) and
High Power Electromagnetics (HPEM)
A high-power electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) is produced following a nuclear detonation. The basic 
phenomenology is as follows: Following a nuclear detonation a large number of photons (γ-rays) 
are produced and spread through space. These photons interact with the surrounding material to 
produce high-energy electrons (Compton effect). The Compton electrons travel at high speed and 
are thus the source current producing intense electromagnetic fields. These electrons produce fur￾ther, secondary, electrons that increase the conductivity of the surrounding medium. The temporal 
and spatial development of the NEMP are therefore very complex as they involve the interaction of 
high-energy particles with materials. Other effects, such as those due to interaction of neutrons, and 
distortions in charged particle trajectories due to the earth’s magnetic field contribute further to this 
complexity. More details may be found in References 51 and 52. Three types of NEMP may be dis￾tinguished. First, explosions at high altitudes (>100km) described as high-altitude EMP (HEMP); 
second, explosions near the ground; and third, system-generated EMP (SGEMP).
The distinctive feature of HEMP is that it affects a very large geographical area and thus presents 
a simultaneous threat to a large number of systems. Although waveform details are classified, EMP 
studies are done using a standard NATO pulse to describe the electric field of a HEMP. The form 
of this field is
E t 5.25 10 e e 4 4 10 4.76 10 t 6t 8
( ) = ×  −  
 − × − × (5.14)
This pulse has a rise-time of a few nanoseconds and a decay time of less than 1 μs. The peak electric 
field is of the order of 50 kV/m. The energy flux associated with this field is of the order of 1 J/m2
FIGURE 5.12 Simple (a) and more complete (b) equivalent circuit used to study ESD from the human body.100 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
and therefore represents a significant threat. A slower, less severe field lasting for hundreds of sec￾onds follows this sharp pulse (magnetohydrodynamic EMP). Extensive exposed systems, such as 
power transmission networks, are particularly vulnerable to HEMP. Currents may be induced into 
these systems causing effects similar to those due to geomagnetic storms (protection malfunctions, 
transformer saturation, etc.).
Surface EMP refers to explosions near the ground and the associated EM effects have a much more 
limited geographical range than HEMP. Inevitably, studies of surface bursts involve ground effects 
and are almost always near the source (SREMP). Such studies are therefore particularly difficult and 
there are no guidelines regarding standard waveforms suitable for equipment hardening tests.
Finally, SGEMP involves the interaction of incident particles and photons with equipment cas￾ings, etc., thus producing very high fields and damage to electronic components.
The strategic objective of NEMP studies is to harden and thus maintain the integrity of critical 
paths and equipment, so that decision time is increased and enough capability survives a first strike 
to offer a credible deterrent.
Comparisons of the threat to systems posed by NEMP and by lightning (LEMP) may be found 
in References 10 and 11.
There is considerable interest in studying Intentional Electromagnetic Environments (IEME) 
that may result from hostile action or terrorism. A number of experimental systems were developed 
to evaluate impact. Narrow-band systems can deliver hundreds of megawatts of power in the fre￾quency range 1 to 3GHz. Moderate band systems delivering power in the range 100 to 700MHz 
are also available. Broadband systems such as JOLT53 can deliver a 100-ps pulse with a field-range 
product rEpk ≃ 5.3 MV. The bandwidth of this system covers the range 40MHz to 4GHz. A survey 
of specialized HEMP systems may be found in Reference 54.
5.4 SURVEYS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT
Various organizations provide data characterizing the electromagnetic environment in specific 
areas or in general terms. A useful collection of survey results relating to mains transients may be 
found in Reference 33.
Large surveys of radio noise are prepared by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 
Data for external noise levels in the range 0.1Hz to 100GHz are reported in Reference 55. In broad 
terms, the external noise figure in decibels ranges from a value of 260 at 1Hz to a value of 150 
at 1kHz. More details and values at higher frequencies may be found in the report quoted above. 
Important also is a survey by the ITU on man-made radio noise.56 This report gives the mean value 
of noise power in decibels above thermal noise at 288 K, in the form
F = −c dlogf
where f is in megahertz and the coefficients c and d depend on the actual environment. As an example, 
in a residential environment c=72.5 and d=27.7. Further details may be found in the report quoted 
above. Similar information is provided in standards concerned with the establishment of EMC limits.57
In many cases, a systematic electromagnetic survey is necessary to establish the amplitude, fre￾quencies, timing, and spatial details of electromagnetic signals on a particular site. This information 
is used to study the influence of EMI on equipment installed on this site. Recommendations as to 
how such surveys may be conducted can be found in Reference 58.

6 Penetration through 
Shields and Apertures
In Chapter 5, the origin and nature of the sources of electromagnetic threats that contribute to elec￾tromagnetic interference (EMI) were described. EMC performance is dependent upon the presence 
of EMI sources but also on the existence and nature of coupling paths that permit EM energy from 
a source to appear as interference signals on sensitive electronic systems. In this chapter, coupling 
through shields and apertures is studied. It is followed by chapters dealing with propagation, con￾ducting penetrations, and general multipath coupling.
6.1 INTRODUCTION
A shield is a layer of conducting material that partially or completely envelops an electronic circuit. 
It therefore affects the amount of EM radiation from the environment external to the circuit that 
can penetrate inside and, conversely, it influences how much of the EM energy generated by the 
circuit escapes to the external environment. Whether the source of EMI is inside or outside the 
shield, the shielding properties remain the same. A variety of materials are used for shielding with 
a wide range of electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and thickness. Shields invariably 
contain openings (apertures) used for access and cooling and a number of joints and seams through 
which EM radiation can penetrate. Practical equipment also is attached to wires and/or pipes 
used for signaling and services. All these components constitute breaches of the shield integrity 
and play a decisive part in the overall performance of the shield. Shielding is important in EMC 
because, almost alone of all other EMC measures that the designer can adopt, it remains under his 
or her full control. It would be convenient to be able to specify reductions to EM radiation from 
sources, or to keep sources of EMI far away from equipment, or arrange the disposition of equip￾ment in the most favorable manner for EMC. This is rarely possible, however, and the designer is 
left with few options, shielding being one of them, to engineer immunity to EM threats that are 
inadequately defined.
In this chapter, two specific aspects of shielding are considered. First, penetration via diffusion 
through conducting shield walls is examined. Second, the ingress of radiation through apertures 
(holes, windows) on the shield is studied. In both cases, the nature of the environment internal to 
the shield can strongly affect the distribution and spectral content of the field. This can be easily 
understood if it is recognized that the shield forms a cavity that resonates at specific frequencies. 
Such complications are not considered here as they require whole-system modeling and results are 
therefore problem dependent. Details of how such calculations can be done are given in Chapter 8. 
Similarly, practical issues of material selection, effect of seams and gasketing, and actual practical 
performance issues are discussed in Chapter 11.
Before embarking on attempts to quantify shielding effectiveness, it is useful to present a simple 
physical picture of the shielding mechanism. The generic shielding problem is shown in Figure 6.1. A 
wave Ei
 representing EMI is shown in Figure 6.1a incident on a shield of thickness t. The objective is 
to prevent this radiation from penetrating inside the shield, i.e., to minimize Et
. A similar situation is 
depicted in Figure 6.1b but now EMI originates from inside the shield. There are two physical prin￾ciples that can be exploited to design shields. First, it is known that an impressed time-varying field 
induces currents (Faraday’s Law) on adjacent conductors of such magnitude and phase as to oppose 
the incident field (Lentz’s Law). A conducting layer would therefore provide shielding, provided suf￾ficient currents were induced and they were allowed to flow without hindrance. Induction depends on 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-8104 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
the rate of change of the incident field and therefore becomes less effective at low frequencies. The 
effectiveness of such a shield is therefore diminished at low frequencies and this turns out to be a 
serious problem, particularly for magnetic field shielding. Similarly, any seams, joints, and openings 
on the shield disturb the flow of the induced currents and therefore reduce shielding effectiveness.
Second, it is known that electric and magnetic fields tend to concentrate in materials of high 
dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, respectively. This effect may be exploited to 
shield low-frequency magnetic fields by constructing a layer of high μr
.
In practice, both the high electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability contribute to shield￾ing to a greater or lesser extent, but it turns out that at low frequencies magnetic field shielding is 
μr
 dependent, whereas at higher frequencies, high electrical conductivity shields are more effective.
6.2 SHIELDING THEORY
In this section, the penetration of fields via diffusion through a conductor of thickness t is considered. 
In order to obtain simple solutions and therefore enhance the understanding of the physics of the pro￾cess and thus grasp the basic scaling laws and trends, several simplifying assumptions will be made. 
These assumptions, while making quantitative results of less practical use, will nevertheless help the 
designer to identify the correct approach to problems and have a grasp of what is possible under ideal￾ized conditions. Two approximate methods for calculating shielding effectiveness will be presented. 
Each method has its limitations and strengths but they both contribute to understanding shielding, 
which is invaluable in EMC problems. Some analytical solutions will also be referred to as they can 
be used as benchmarks in tests and calculations. The basic numerical simulation methods that can be 
used for shielding studies are also described. The shielding of cables is treated in a separate subsection.
6.2.1 Shielding Effectiveness

 normally represents a plane wave incident on one side of an infinite layer of the shielding mate￾rial of thickness t and Et
 represents the field at some point on the other side. As such, Equation 6.1 
does not account for the actual shape of the shield. Shielding effectiveness may also be defined in 
terms of the magnetic field. It should be pointed out that the two definitions do not always result in 
the same value of shielding effectiveness. An alternative definition of the shielding effectiveness is 
to interpret Ei
 as the field at a point without the shield present and Et
 the field at the same point when 
the shield is present. Under some circumstances, it may also be of interest to calculate the phase 
shift to the field introduced by the shield. Shielding effectiveness of the order of 20 dB is about the 
FIGURE 6.1 Penetration of incident EM pulse (a) to inner space (b).Penetration through Shields and Apertures 105
minimum worthwhile value, with 50 to 60 dB considered to be an average to cope with most prob￾lems. In some cases, such as transmitter equipment, at least 100 dB is desirable. Shielding above 
about 120 dB approaches the state of the art in this area.
6.2.2 Approximate Methods—The Circuit Approach
Before embarking on more detailed investigations, two mathematically simple problems will be 
tackled. The objective is to bring out some of the essential features of shielding and also illustrate 
some of the complexities inherent in this type of calculation. The two examples chosen are for the 
shielding provided by a thin-walled, very long conducting cylinder, subject to externally applied 
longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields.
Let us first start with the configuration shown in Figure 6.2a. It is clear that an impressed external 
field Hi
 along the z-direction will induce currents in the thin cylinder that tend to oppose the pen￾etration of this field. For this to happen an azimuthal current density (K: amperes/meter) must flow 
as shown. The field inside the cylinder is that due to the current density K, i.e., the field inside a long 
solenoid of surface current density K amperes per unit length. It follows, therefore, that inside the 
cylinder Ht
 is uniform. In order to relate Hi
 to Ht
, it is necessary to invoke Faraday’s Law and apply 
it on the curve C shown in Figure 6.2a. Thus,
E ∫ = − Φ  d1 d
c dt (6.2)
where Φ is the flux linked with C, i.e., μ0πa2 Ht
. The electric field in the thin wall is related to the 
current density J by the expression E=J/σ where σ is the electrical conductivity of the cylinder mate￾rial. The current density J in A/m2 is related to the surface current density K in A/m by the expres￾sion J D·1=K· 1 where D is the wall thickness. Hence J=K/D, and substituting this expression and 
the expression for the flux in Equation 6.2 gives

where it has been recognized that K and Ht
 are, in general, time dependent. Similarly, from Ampere’s 
Law applied on path ABCDA, Ht

and rearranging gives1

where τm = μ0 σ a D/2. If the impressed field is a step function Hi
(t)=Hi
, then the solution of 
Equation 6.4 is
( ) = − ( ) − τ H t t i H 1 e t/ m (6.5)
The surface current density is therefore
K t Ht i t H t Hie t/ m () () () = − = − − τ
The quantity τm has the dimensions of time and is the diffusion time constant of the system. It quanti￾fies the ability of this system to exclude the impressed field. Clearly, a short field pulse of duration less 
than τm can be excluded relatively easily by the induced currents and shielding is effective. Conversely, 
a pulse lasting longer than τm will not be adequately attenuated and shielding is less effective. A per￾fect conductor (σ → ∞) would be an ideal shield, since then τm would be infinitely large.
Looking at the structure of Equation 6.4, it is intuitively evident that the penetration of the 
field inside the cylinder may be understood and studied in terms of the circuit analogue shown in 
Figure 6.3. For this circuit, KCL gives

The circuit analogue approach offers another intuitively powerful tool for studying shielding. 
Further details of the circuit approach may be found in References 2 and 3.
The second example deals with the shielding properties of a thin-walled cylinder subject to a 
transverse magnetic field, as shown in Figure 6.2b. The physics of the problem remain the same as 
FIGURE 6.3 Circuit analogue for the penetration of a magnetic field though a cylinder.Penetration through Shields and Apertures 107
for the first example but the mathematics are more complex. Currents will be induced in the cylinder 
running along the z-direction as shown in (b), in a manner that tends to oppose the impressed field. 
The problem is best tackled by recognizing that the magnetic field in the inner and outer regions 
may be obtained as the gradient of a scalar, magnetic potential, i.e.,
H = −∇ψ
The function Ψ is chosen to conform with the symmetry of the problem and the boundary condi￾tions.4,5 Thus, the following choices may be made:

3. Ampere’s Law, i.e., at r=a, H H t i θ θ − = K where K is the induced current per meter length 
along the circumference.
The induced current may be related to the field inside the cylinder by applying Faraday’s Law as for 
the first example. The law is applied on a curve running parallel to the axis at A and at B, as shown 
in Figure 6.2b. The chosen form of the potential Ψt
 in Equation 6.7 implies that the field inside the 
cylinder is constant of value Ht
. The field component Hn normal to the surface bounded by the curve 
C (defined by the broken line AB and having a depth l into the paper) is

Substituting K from Equation 6.8 in the equation above and rearranging gives an expression identi￾cal to that shown in Equation 6.4 where τm =μ0 a D σ/2. Similar conclusions about shielding may be 
drawn as for the first example. If a harmonic field of frequency f is impressed, then the derivative

The quantity in the brackets is α=πf μ0 a D σ, and is a measure of the shielding afforded by the 
cylinder. Shielding is more effective the higher the frequency, radius, thickness, and electrical con￾ductivity of the shield. As an example, for a cylinder made out of aluminum (σ=3.5×107 Ωm−1) of

For f=50 Hz the shielding effectiveness is only just over 3 dB but at 1 kHz it rises to 26 dB. Much 
higher SE is possible at higher frequencies provided the assumptions made in this calculation hold. 
This is rarely the case in practice. In deriving Equation 6.9 it has been assumed that the shield thick￾ness is very small. Thus, no account has been taken of the radial distribution of induced currents 
(significant if D is comparable to the skin depth), or of the magnetic properties of the shield.

where γ=(1 +))/δ is the propagation constant in the conductor (Equation 2.52), δ is the skin depth 
(Equation 2.53), and μr
 is the relative magnetic permeability of the shield material. The result Penetration through Shields and Apertures 109
obtained above makes the quasistatic approximation, i.e., the displacement current is neglected. 
This is acceptable at low frequencies. Clearly, this also means that the wavelength of the incident 
field must be much larger than the cavity dimensions.
Let us now return to the circuit approach to shielding effectiveness. The circuit shown in Figure 
6.3 may be modified to produce a series circuit, as shown in Figure 6.4b where now voltages model 
the incident and transmitted magnetic field strength. From Figure 6.3 or 6.4b, it is evident that low￾frequency fields are not efficiently shielded. At low frequencies, most of the current flows through￾out the low-impedance path (ωL) and hence Ht
 is high. Similarly, in the circuit shown in Figure 
6.4a, there is significant voltage drop along the high-impedance element (ωC-1) and hence the volt￾age across R is low. This implies a low transmitted field Et
. Any modification or imperfection in 
the shield that makes R larger inevitably decreases shielding effectiveness. This, for example, may 
come about by introducing slots or seams that prevent free flow of induced current and thus effec￾tively increase R. This physical picture also suggests practical ways of introducing slits and aper￾tures in such a way that shield integrity is least compromised. It is also evident from these figures 
that DC fields cannot be shielded at all if the thin shield is made of nonmagnetic material. A degree 
of magnetic field shielding may be afforded at DC and very low frequency if the shield is made out 
of relatively thick material of high magnetic permeability (μr >> 1). Hence at low frequencies two 
approaches to magnetic field shielding may be employed:
1. Shielding by inducing eddy currents. This method is effective at low frequencies but not 
at DC or very low frequencies. This is obvious from Figures 6.3 and 6.4b and from basic 
physical principles.
2. Shielding by diverting the magnetic field into a high-permeability material (field ducting). 
This method exploits the fact that the magnetic field prefers to follow a low reluctance path 
and hence is mainly concentrated inside the shield walls. This naturally implies that high 
values of the magnetic field may be established inside the magnetic shield walls and the 
consequent risk of magnetic saturation. If this happens, then μr
 drops to very low values 
and shield performance then resembles that of a nonmagnetic shield, i.e., one based on the 
induced current method (1) described above.
Equation 6.11 may be used for studying the relative contribution of eddy currents and ducting at 
low frequencies. Some results to illustrate these effects are shown in Figure 6.5. Curve (a) shows 
the shielding efficiency for a cylindrical shield subject to a longitudinal magnetic field. The cylinder 
is made of Al and is 0.001 m thick. Curve (b) shows the shielding efficiency of an infinite slab of 
thickness 0.001 m made of Al. It is clear from these two curves that the shape of the shield is critical 
at low frequencies. Further details of magnetic field shielding at DC and low frequencies may be 
found in References 6, 8, and 9.
Let us now turn attention to the shielding of electric fields. A detailed development of the electric 
field circuit model may be found in Reference 3 and, in the quasistatic thin-shield approximation 
examined here, it results in the circuit shown in Figure 6.4a. The incident and transmitted electric 
FIGURE 6.4 Circuit analogues for electric (a) and magnetic (b) field penetration.110 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
field strength is described by the voltages shown, and it is apparent that at low frequencies, includ￾ing DC, the shield is very effective. This situation should be contrasted with the magnetic field case 
where the opposite situation applies. Of more practical importance are the low-frequency shield￾ing properties of a thin-walled spherical conducting shell.3,10 For the case of a nonmagnetic (μr=1) 
shield of radius a and thickness D and at low frequencies λ >> D it turns out that the circuits shown 
in Figure 6.4 hold with C=3 ε0 a/2, L=μ0 a/3 and R=l/σD). The shielding effectiveness to electric 
and magnetic field can then be obtained directly and is

Following the approach described in Reference 11, some general remarks can be made regarding 
shielding. A conducting shield of largest dimension 2a and thickness D is shown schematically in 
Figure 6.6. An incident magnetic field pulse Hi
 of duration t0 is also shown and the effectiveness of 
this shield in general terms is sought. Four characteristic times are important, namely:
1. The duration t0 of the incident pulse
2. The transit time across the entire shield ta~2a/u
3. The wall diffusion time constant td~μ0 σD2
4. The eddy current decay constant tf=L/R~μ0 σDa
FIGURE 6.5 Shielding effectiveness of a cylindrical shield (a) and a slab (b).Penetration through Shields and Apertures 111
Taking a typical shield as an example, made of Al (σ=3.5×107 S), two meters in diameter (a~1 m) 
and a few millimeters thick (D~1 mm) gives the following time constants for the shield:
ta~tens of nanoseconds (transit time)
td~tens of microseconds (wall diffusion time)
tf~tens of milliseconds (eddy current decay time)

of strength

Following the application of this pulse the field diffuses through the wall and reaches its peak value 
inside the shield in a time of the order of td. Since ta≪td, it follows that the externally applied field 
has then passed by and hence at time t>td the field is determined by the decay of eddy currents with 
a time constant tf
 as indicated by the circuit in Figure 6.4b. The transmitted field during this phase 
is determined from the circuit shown in Figure 6.4b and is

For a NEMP pulse with E=50 kV/m and t0=250 nsec, H0=Et0/Z=3.3×10−5 As/m and for an Al 
shield 3 m in radius and 1 mm thick, this expression gives an induced voltage of the order of a 
millivolt.
As far as time-harmonic incident fields are concerned, the important consideration is the mag￾nitude of the skin-depth δ relative to the thickness of the wall D. A wall is regarded as electrically 
thick if δ<D and in such cases reflection and attenuation in the wall contribute substantially to 
shielding. In electrically thin walls δ>D the eddy current distribution and, therefore, the shape of 
the enclosure play a crucial role in shielding. An incident magnetic field with a period T≫tf
 cannot 
be adequately shielded. The only way to improve shielding under these circumstances is to use a 
thick wall of high magnetic permeability.
FIGURE 6.6 Configuration used to study penetration and shielding in general terms.112 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
6.2.3 Approximate Methods—The Wave Approach
An alternative approach to calculating shielding effectiveness is to consider how waves incident on 
the shield wall suffer reflections and decay. A systematic approach may thus be devised that permits 
the calculation of the transmitted field Et
 once the incident field Ei
 is known. A typical configuration 
is shown in Figure 6.7a, where the wall is regarded as an infinite slab of thickness D. This is a typi￾cal assumption in this type of calculation (planar wall approximation). A qualitative description of 
what happens to an incident field Ei
 as it impinges on the wall surface on the left-hand side as shown 
in Figure 6.7b, is as follows.
Upon the pulse Ei
 impinging on the wall, it encounters a discontinuity, some energy is reflected (E1), 
and part of the energy penetrates into the conductor (E2). Reflection at the left-hand side wall bound￾ary represents, therefore, a first contribution to shielding. The pulse proceeds further to reach the wall 
surface on the right-hand side (E3) and in this travel inevitably suffers some attenuation that thus con￾tributes further to shielding. Subsequently, part of the signal is reflected back into the wall (E4) and part 
proceeds further to form the transmitted signal Et
. The ratio Ei
/Et
 cannot, however, be regarded as the 
shielding effectiveness under all circumstances. In general, pulse E4 will be reflected at the left-hand 
side wall boundary, thus causing further reflections inside the wall and making further contributions to 
the total transmitted signals. In a general case, there are therefore three aspects to be considered:
1. Reflection loss
2. Attenuation or absorption loss
3. Multiple reflection loss
An exact solution to the problem may be obtained by defining an incident plane wave in the medium 
to the left of the wall, which is assumed to be air (intrinsic impedance Z0 0 = µ /ε0 phase constant 
β0 0 = ω µ ε/ . 0 It is further assumed that Hi=Ei
/Z0, which implies that the wall is in the far field of the 
source launching the plane wave. Similar conditions are assumed when considering the transmitted 
field in the air to the right of the wall. Inside the conducting wall of the shield a complex propagation 
constant γ and intrinsic impedance Z are assumed. These were obtained in Chapter 2, Equations 2.52 
and 2.54. On the two interfaces between the three different media, boundary conditions are enforced 
for the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields. The ratio of incident to transmitted 
field may then be obtained and is13,14

The first term in this expression represents the reflection losses in crossing the two conductor/air 
boundaries. The second term represents attenuation or absorption loss in the shield wall and the 
third term the multiple reflection loss. The same formulae may be obtained in an approximate man￾ner by assuming that signal E2 in Figure 6.7b may be obtained simply using the formula

Since Z≪Z0, the largest contribution to the reduction of the electric field occurs at the left-hand side 
of the wall. In contrast, the major magnetic field decrease occurs at the right-hand side of the wall 
as it can be directly confirmed by substituting E=H×Z in the above expressions. This situation sug￾gests that the shield thickness D is more important for magnetic field shielding. The attenuation in 
the wall (second term in Equation 6.14) can be calculated directly assuming exponential decay with 
a characteristic length equal to the skin depth. The multiple reflection loss may also be calculated 
by taking into account the successive reflections of pulse E4 in Figure 6.7b between the two faces of 
the shield. Clearly, since the primary contribution to the reflection loss of the magnetic field is at the 
right-hand side of the wall, the largest contribution from multiple reflections will be on the magnetic 
field strength. It is relatively easy to confirm that multiple reflection contributes the third term in 
Equation 6.14. A systematic scheme for obtaining the shielding effectiveness is shown in Figure 6.8. 
The incident signal Ei
 is of unit amplitude as shown. Then the transmitted signal is the sum of the

This formula includes all the contributions from reflections, attenuation, and multiple reflections.
The derivation above was based on the assumption that the source of EM waves is far from the 
shield. This allowed the use of the intrinsic impedance of the medium as the wave impedance. 114 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
As discussed in Chapter 2, the wave impedance in the near field of an antenna differs from Z0. The 
formulae for shielding effectiveness derived previously may still be used provided that the correct 
wave impedance is used. Assuming that a small coil (magnetic source) is placed at a distance z from 
the shield as shown in Figure 6.9, then the wave impedance at any point at the surface of the shield is

This value must then be used for the wave impedance in the medium surrounding the source. It has 
been shown that the shielding effectiveness does not depend on the distance z. A full discussion of 
the difficulties associated with calculations in the near field may be found in References 15 and 16.
It is worth emphasizing that at low frequencies the shape of the shield is critical in calculating 
shielding effectiveness and that the planar wave theory described above does not make allowance 
for effects due to shape. Similarly, there is nothing in the theory presented here to account for fur￾ther reflections that the transmitted signal Et
 will suffer inside the cavity formed by the conducting 
shield. The formulae presented here must therefore be used with caution in practical situations.
6.2.4 Analytical Solutions to Shielding Problems
Very few shield configurations can be studied using analytical techniques. This is true whether a 
solution in the frequency or time domain is contemplated. Certainly no practical shields could be 
studied in this way; the best that can be expected is to obtain solutions for canonical shapes such as 
two infinitely long parallel plates, infinitely long cylinders, or spherical shells. Such solutions are 
very useful, however, in providing an insight into shield behavior and also accurate solutions against 
which approximate or numerical methods can be tested. The pioneering work in this area is due 
to Kaden.17 Subsequently, further work appeared in the English literature on solutions to canonical 
problems of the type described above.
The attenuation of transient fields by an imperfectly conducting spherical shell was reported in 
Reference 18. Results for penetration through a slab, two parallel slabs, infinitely long cylinders, and 
a spherical shell presented in the frequency and time domains may be found in References 10 and 11. 
Results for the penetration of a NEMP through a slab are reported in Reference 19. The general 
functional form of the magnetic field shielding effectiveness of the canonical shapes mentioned 
above is given in Reference 10 and is

where α, β have different values depending on the form and parameters of the shield. Equation 
6.11 is a particular form of Equation 6.20 for the case of a cylindrical shield in an axial field and is 
plotted in Figure 6.5. For comparison, results are shown in the same figure for a slab of the same 
thickness and material properties as the cylinder. It can be seen that at low frequencies the perfor￾mance of the two shields is very different, and hence that shape factors are important and must be 
considered in calculations.
6.2.5 General Remarks Regarding Shielding Effectiveness at Different Frequencies
In Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3, two approaches that may be used in the calculations of shielding effec￾tiveness were presented. Both approaches have limitations and must therefore be used with caution. 
The circuit approach is generally favored at low frequencies, while the wave approach is normally 
used at high frequencies. What is more important, however, is to appreciate the general trends in 
shielding. Generally speaking, for conducting shields of a significant thickness of the order of a 116 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
millimeter or more, shielding effectiveness exceeds 100 dB at frequencies exceeding a few tens of 
kilohertz (see Figure 6.5). In practice such high shielding effectiveness is possible, if at all, with great 
difficulty since apertures, seams, and wire penetrations dominate shielding. If very thin conduct￾ing coatings are used, or if poor conductors are employed as shielding materials (e.g., carbon fiber 
composites), further checks need to be made to ascertain the effectiveness of the shield. However, 
without doubt, penetration through the shield material becomes a problem at low frequencies and 
for the magnetic field in particular. Therefore, meeting magnetic field shielding requirements at low 
frequencies will in most cases also meet all other shielding requirements (subject to limitations due 
to wires and apertures). At very low frequencies and at DC it may be necessary to use high-mag￾netic-permeability materials to achieve a high degree of magnetic field shielding. Materials such as 
mumetal have values of μr
 exceeding 10,000 at low frequencies. However, this value decreases very 
considerably at frequencies above a few kilohertz and hence the material becomes less effective. 
Similarly, high values of magnetic field reduce the effective μr
 due to saturation effects. A detailed 
description of this type of shield may be found in Reference 9. As an illustration, the shielding effec￾tiveness of a spherical shell of inner and outer diameters Di
 and D0, respectively, and with μr≫1, is, 
for static magnetic fields,

For a very thick shield Di
/D0 → 0, the shielding effectiveness tends to a limiting value of μr
/9. Hence, 
if μr=10,000 it follows that shielding effectiveness above 67 dB cannot be attained even with a very 
thick wall. If higher shielding effectiveness is required, a double shield may be used. Formulae 
for calculating static magnetic field shielding effectiveness for double shields may be found in 
Reference 9. Naturally, multiple-layered shields may be used to increase shielding at all frequen￾cies. Formulae for N-layered spherical shields may be found in Reference 10. As an example, the 
shielding effectiveness of a two-layered shield consisting of two shields of shielding effectiveness 
SEl
 and SE2, respectively, is

 and Dl; D2 are the thicknesses of the outer and inner shields.10
It may become possible in the future to use new high-temperature superconductors in the con￾struction of shields.19 The concept of skin depth applies in this case and the field strength at a 
depth z inside the material is E=E0 exp (−z/λ) where E0 is the field strength at the surface and λ is 
the London penetration length approximately constant up to microwave frequencies. For typical 
superconducting materials, λ is of the order of tens of nanometers and thus a very high degree of 
shielding could be achieved with very thin layers of such materials. Practical exploitation of these 
effects is dependent on progress in the development and manufacture of essentially room-tempera￾ture superconductors.
6.2.6 Surface Transfer Impedance and Cable Shields
The previous discussion of shielding was based on the “shielding effectiveness” as the parameter 
used to characterize shields. An alternative measure that can be advantageous under some circum￾stances, and which is used extensively in describing the quality and effectiveness of cable shields, 
is the transfer impedance ZT. Cable shields are important in overall system performance as they are 
of considerable length and run through electromagnetically hostile environments. In this section, 
the concept of transfer impedance will be explained. The important topic of coupling through cable 
shields will be treated in more detail in future sections.Penetration through Shields and Apertures 117
Let us first start by considering a slab of thickness D, as shown in Figure 6.10a. It is assumed 
that the shield carries in total a current Is in A/m (the length measured into the paper). The transfer 
impedance ZT may then be defined as the ratio of the electric field at the inner surface E(0) to the 
total current Is.
Z E T s = ( ) 0 / I (6.23)
Alternatively, ZT may be defined as the ratio of E(0) to H(D), the magnetic field at the outer surface.
The transfer impedance may be calculated approximately (|Z|≪Z0) by obtaining the solution to 
the wave equation (Equation 2.49) inside the slab, i.e.,
= + γ −γ E A e B e x x
The magnetic field is then obtained from Faraday’s Law

At low frequencies, where the thickness D is much smaller than the skin depth δ, Equation 6.24 
simplifies to ZT ≃ 1/σD, which is the DC resistance of the slab. At high frequencies when δ≪D it 
turns out that ZT ≃ 2 Z e−D/δ.

These expression show that as the frequency increases, the electric field and hence the voltage drop E(a)
l along a length l of the shield decreases. This voltage appears in the signal path of the cable and there￾fore constitutes EMI. The transfer impedance calculated above accounts only for diffusion through 
the shield and only applies to solid shields. In many practical situations, notably braided shields, there 
are holes between the partially overlapping strands, incomplete electrical contact between strands, 
and slight differences in the spacing between strands and the shielded conductor.21–23 All these factors 
make varying contributions to shielding effectiveness and may be balanced against each other for 
optimum design.24 The overall result is that an extra term appears in the expression for the transfer 
impedance shown in Equation 6.26 for a solid shield. This expression is modified to account for the 
different DC resistance of the braided shield and an additional term jωM12 is introduced that accounts 
for magnetic field penetration through holes and other similar effects. The addition of this term means 
that the overall transfer impedance does not fall continuously as predicted by Equation 6.26, but after 
a certain frequency (typically~1 MHz for most cables) it starts to increase. Similarly, electric field 
penetration may be accounted for by a transfer admittance YT =jω C12.
24 A circuit model of the coaxial 
line may thus be constructed as shown in Figure 6.11. Terms ZΔx and YΔx represent the normal line 
parameters. The voltage source represents diffusion and inductive coupling

and the current source represents capacitive coupling through the holes to the external circuit where 
YT =−jω C12 and V0 is the potential difference between the inner conductor and shield common path. 
A more detailed discussion of cable shielding is presented in the chapter on propagation. 
6.3 APERTURE THEORY
It has already been mentioned that the overall shielding effectiveness of an enclosure is more often 
than not determined by the presence of holes, slits, and other openings with or without wire penetra￾tions, and that diffusive penetration through the material is, at least for highly conducting shields, 
FIGURE 6.11 Circuit equivalent of a shield taking account of transfer impedance and admittance.120 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
only a serious issue at low frequencies and for magnetic fields. An approximate intuitive calculation 
will suffice to establish the severity of coupling through apertures.12 Let us consider a shield with an 
aperture of area A subject to a powerful external EM pulse. Let the component of the electric field 
normal to the aperture be E and the magnetic field component tangent to the aperture be H. Both 
these fields have been calculated assuming that the aperture has been shorted out by a perfectly con￾ducting sheet. The maximum current that can be induced on an internal conductor may be obtained 
assuming all the electric flux is coupled to the conductor, i.e.,
i ≅ = A ε
dD

 A dE

Assuming a severe EMP threat (E=50 kV/m in 10 nsec) and an aperture of diameter 0.1 m gives a 
current equal to 0.35 A. Similarly, the voltage induced on a conductor loop is
v a dH/dt 2 ≅ µ
where a is the diameter of the aperture. For a magnetic field rising to 133 A/m in 10 nsec this 
formula gives an induced voltage equal to 167. This value is considerably larger compared to that 
obtained for diffusion in Section 6.22, emphasizing the importance of coupling through apertures.
It is therefore of considerable importance to examine the general principles that determine the 
penetration of fields through apertures. The treatment will be limited to electrically small apertures, 
that is, apertures for which the largest linear dimension is much smaller than the wavelength. A rig￾orous examination of practical configurations is very complex and to date few canonical problems 
have been solved analytically. To illustrate the principles of such a calculation and to provide the 
basis for the treatment of more complex problems, the simple case of a very thin, highly conducting 
infinite sheet with a very long narrow slot of width 2a, as shown in Figure 6.12a, will be studied in 
detail. To simplify the problem further, it is assumed that a DC electric field E0, which is uniform 
and points upward far from the slot, is established in the external region (y>0). The problem posed 
is to obtain the electric field that penetrates through this aperture into the internal region (y<0). 
It may come as no surprise to the reader that even this highly idealized simple problem presents 
some considerable difficulty in trying to obtain an analytical solution. The general approach is to 
transform the conductor configuration shown in Figure 6.12a into a simpler one, namely, that shown 
FIGURE 6.12 Penetration of a static electric field through a slot (a), w-plane configuration (b), and schematic 
of the electric field distribution (c); a description of the dual problem of magnetic field penetration (d).Penetration through Shields and Apertures 121
in Figure 6.12b, for which a solution for the potential can be easily found. This is done by using a 
conformal transformation from the z-plane (Figure 6.12a) to the w-plane (Figure 6.12b).17,25 A gen￾eral transform for polygonal shapes from the z- to the w-plane, known as the Schwarz-Christoffel

where A and B are constants to be determined. At z=−a, w must be −a/2, hence −a=−aA+B. 
Similarly, at z=a, w must be equal to a/2, and hence a=aA+B. From these two constraints it follows 
that A=1 and B=0 and therefore the desired transformation is

It is easy to show using this expression that the exterior space is mapped into the region rw >a/2 in

It can be confirmed by calculating Er

This potential is the same as that due to a linear dipole distributed along the slit length, namely,

where p is the dipole moment p=q1 ·h, q1 is the charge and h is the distance between the positive and 
negative dipole charges as shown in Figure 6.12a. All that is needed to establish the equivalence is 
to choose as pe=π ε a2 E0/2. The field penetrating through this slit can thus be obtained from this 
equivalent dipole and is shown schematically in Figure 6.12c.
This derivation suggests a general method for dealing with the penetration of an electric field 
through an aperture. In applying this method the electric field at the position of the aperture is first 
obtained assuming that the aperture is replaced by a perfectly conducting sheet (E0 in this particular 
example). This field is referred to in the literature as the shortcircuit field Esc. Penetration then is 
calculated as if it is due to an equivalent dipole of dipole moment given by
pe e = ε2   α Esc (6.27)
The quantity αe is known as the aperture electric polarizability and has been calculated for a number 
of shapes.26,27 As an example, the polarizability of a narrow slot of length l and width 2a (2a≪1) is 
πl a2/4. Substituting into Equation 6.27 the polarizability per unit length from this formula gives the 
same value of p as calculated for the infinite slot. In practice the calculation of the electric field in 
the internal region is done by replacing the aperture by a perfectly conducting sheet and placing a 
small dipole just inside the shield at the position where the aperture would be. To take account of the 
reinforcing effect of the image dipole, the value of p chosen is then half that calculated in Equation 
6.27. For a circular hole of diameter d the electric polarizability is αe=d3/12. Values for other shapes 
may be found in the literature.
The penetration of a magnetic field may be treated in a similar way and results in an identical for￾mulation, where now the electric dipole is replaced by a magnetic dipole as shown in Figure 6.12d. 
The magnetic dipole moment is now given by
p = π
2 m a H2 0 (6.28)
In general, the equivalent magnetic aperture dipole moment is given by the expression
pm m = −2 H α sc (6.29)
where αm is the aperture magnetic polarizability and Hsc is the short-circuit field, i.e., the magnetic 
field at the position of the aperture when the aperture is replaced by a perfectly conducting sheet. 
The value of αm for a narrow slit (2a≪1) and for a field running at right angles to the narrow side is 
πl a2/4. Substituting the dipole moment per unit length into Equation 6.29 gives the value obtained 
in Equation 6.28. For a circular hole of diameter d, αm =d3/6.

This formula shows that the power that leaks through the aperture scales as the fourth power of fre￾quency and the sixth power of the radius. It is clear, therefore, that large holes have very deleterious 
effects on shielding. It is more advantageous to use instead many smaller holes if that is an option 
permitted in the design. This conclusion is also confirmed by the circuit approach described in the 
last section. Large holes disturb the path of eddy current flow and thus reduce shielding more, com￾pared to a configuration that consists of several but smaller holes.
Another issue that must be addressed regards penetration through apertures in thick walls. In 
the calculations described above, the thickness of the shield walls was neglected. A derivation of 
the equivalent aperture dipole moment where the finite thickness of the screen is taken into account 
may be found in Reference 17. However, as the thickness of the screen becomes considerable, more 
elaborate models for penetration become necessary. A general formulation for this type of problem, 
based on the application of the equivalence principle, may be found in Reference 28. The case of a 
narrow slit in a thick conducting screen is treated in Reference 29. For screen thicknesses equal to 
multiples of the half wavelength, considerable penetration through the slot may occur. Under these 
resonant conditions and for narrow slit widths 2a≪λ it is found that29

where Ptrans is the total power transmitted per unit length of the slit and P is the incident power 
density at the slit. Hence, under these conditions, the effective width of the slit is l/π times the wave￾length, irrespective of the actual value of the slit width 2a. A survey of work in this area and typical 
results may be found in Reference 30.
The depth of the slot may be artificially increased above the thickness of the shield material, as 
shown in Figure 6.13. The structure thus formed resembles a waveguide and thus frequencies well 
below its cut-off frequency suffer additional attenuation. For a circular air-filled waveguide and a 
TEn mode, the cut-off wavelength is 3.41r and hence the cut-off frequency is 8.8×107

6.4 RIGOROUS CALCULATION OF THE SHIELDING EFFECTIVENESS 
(SE) OF A CONDUCTING BOX WITH AN APERTURE
In the previous section, we have dealt with penetration through an aperture using the concepts of 
polarizability and equivalent magnetic/electric dipoles. These are essentially low-frequency tech￾niques and are useful in getting a basic assessment of SE. The general case of high-frequency pene￾tration through an aperture that is backed by a conducting cavity is of the most practical significance 
as it represents realistic engineering configurations (e.g., an equipment cabinet with an opening for 
access, ventilation, etc.).
A typical arrangement is shown in Figure 6.14. The problem may be posed as follows: An exter￾nal EM field, normally a plane wave, is incident on the cabinet wall with the aperture. This wave 
suffers a partial reflection and also partially penetrates through the aperture to establish a field 
inside the cabinet. It is desired to calculate the relative shielding afforded by the cabinet with the 
aperture, i.e., the SE. The difficulty in performing this calculation is that the tangential fields at the 
aperture are not known a priori and the field inside the cabinet exhibits strong resonant behavior. 
FIGURE 6.14 Rectangular cabinet with a rectangular aperture. The observation point is P and the wall 
thickness is t.Penetration through Shields and Apertures 125
It is by no means obvious that the cabinet will provide shielding at all frequencies, although we 
may be tempted to believe that it might do so. Such problems may be treated in several ways using 
analytical techniques, intermediate models, or full-field models as is explained in this and the fol￾lowing sections.
Analytical approaches when they are possible are accurate and can be used to benchmark other 
solution techniques. However, they become intractable when shapes are not canonical. The essence 
of these calculations is described at the end of this section.
Intermediate models are a compromise whereby semi-analytical results are used to establish 
models that, although not rigorous, have known and controllable accuracy. They are most useful in 
rapid conceptual and “what if” studies early at the design stage. They are described in Section 6.5.
Full-field numerical models are rigorous within the limitations of the accuracy of numerical 
methods, but they are computer intensive and require access to sophisticated CAD tools. A brief 
survey of available numerical techniques is presented in Section 6.6.
Ways of speeding up computation of SE problems using full-field numerical models in the case 
of apertures with complex perforations are presented in Section 6.7. These techniques are best 
employed when a basic design has evolved in order to check assumptions and detailed behavior at 
points of interest.
An effective way of dealing with SE calculations using analytical techniques is presented in 
References 32 and 33. The field inside the cavity is expressed as a combination of cavity or wave￾guide modes and outside the cavity by a combination of free-space modes. The transverse magnetic 
field inside the cavity is expressed in terms of the total aperture electric field using the waveguide 
admittance operator. Similarly, the incident and reflected transverse magnetic field outside the cav￾ity is expressed in terms of the incident and reflected electric field at the aperture. Enforcing field 
continuity at the aperture results in an integral equation that can be solved for the aperture fields. 
Once these have been calculated, the field inside the cabinet and reflected from it may be calculated. 
The required admittance operators are obtained from the modes and the integral equation is solved 
using Galerkin’s method. These calculations, although well established and accurate, are computa￾tionally intensive.
6.5 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TOOLS FOR SE CALCULATIONS
As already indicated, rapid calculation of the SE effectiveness early in the design stage is essential 
as it permits a basic conceptual design to evolve where potential interference problems are identi￾fied, optimum placement of sensitive equipment is decided, and the basic sizing is established. It is 
obvious that at this stage only basic details of the design are available and the designer is primarily 
interested in exploring rapidly the design parameter space and thus deciding on the basic configu￾ration. A suitable simulation tool for this type of study is one where large-scale behavior can be 
rapidly established (full details are not yet available!). Full-field numerical models are too slow and 
simulate a level of detail that is not required for this stage in the design. Empirical models, on the 
other hand, are inaccurate when used outside their limited range of applicability and cannot there￾fore be used with confidence for creative design. The type of tool that is best suited to this task is 
what we describe as an “intermediate level tool.” It is a compromise between the rigor of a full-field 
numerical model and the simplicity of an empirical model. Its nature will become clearer as we 
examine in more depth its structure for the problem depicted in Figure 6.14.
Before we start on model development we consider first the worst case of field polarization with 
regard to penetration through the slot in Figure 6.14. To develop the argument we consider condi￾tions with regard to the reflection and penetration of a wave from a conducting wall with a slot as 
shown in Figure 6.15 for an electric field polarized parallel to the long dimension of the slot (a) and 
perpendicular to it (b). Reflection from a conducting wall takes place because currents j are induced 
such that they generate a reflected (scattered) electric field to cancel out the incident field and thus 
satisfy the boundary conditions on the wall (Et=0). We see from Figure 6.15a that the slot does not 126 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
impede the flow of currents in the direction shown and thus the conducting wall is able to generate 
a full reflection without any appreciable field penetration through the slot. Another intuitive way to 
reach the same conclusion is to reason that the electric field component parallel to the long side of 
the slot must be zero in order to satisfy the boundary conditions on the slot long sides. Thus fields 
find it difficult to penetrate. In contrast, for this electric field polarization in Figure 6.15b, currents 
must flow as shown and clearly the presence of the slot has a significant impact. Reflection is sig￾nificantly impeded and therefore the wave penetrates. For this reason we focus on the case depicted 
in Figure 6.15b as it represents the worst case.
Before embarking on building a mathematical model of the configuration in Figure 6.14 for the 
purposes of calculating SE, we first consider the essential component of such a model. First, we 
need a representation of the incident field impinging on the cabinet with the slot. Second, the impact 
of the slot on the field as it negotiates its passage through it must be represented. Third, the way that 
EM energy distributes inside the cabinet must be accounted for (box resonances). We develop a suit￾able model for each of the three components before we finally put them together.34–36
We assume a plane wave incident onto the cabinet and we represent it simply by the Thevenin 
equivalent shown in Figure 6.16a. The voltage source represents the strength of the incident field 
and η0 is the intrinsic impedance of free space (= 377). The exact value of V0 is of no significance 
as the SE is expressed as the ratio of two fields and V0 should cancel out.
The model of the aperture is more difficult to envisage. This part of the configuration is depicted 
in Figure 6.16b and it has the appearance of a co-planar stripline shorted at both ends. This is shown 
more clearly in Figure 6.17 where

(a), and perpendicular to it (b).Penetration through Shields and Apertures 127
where the scaling factor (ℓ/a) accounts for the different length of the slot and the cabinet side. 
The final element of the model is the cabinet, which is excited by the slot fields at its front walls 
and is shorted at the far end as shown in Figure 6.16c. We are therefore inclined to represent the 
cabinet as a rectangular shorted waveguide where propagation is along the z-direction. From stan￾dard waveguide theory38 the cutoff wavelength is λc=2a/n and therefore the waveguide wavelength 
and characteristic impedance are

where, η0=377 Ω, β0=2π/λ. In this reasonable approximation, the cabinet is represented as a shorted 
transmission line with the parameters calculated above. Putting the three models together gives the 
simplified model of the entire configuration as shown in Figure 6.18. Calculation of the electric field 
inside the cabinet at a distance z from the front face with the aperture is equivalent to the calcula￾tion of the voltage V(z) in the transmission line shown in Figure 6.18. This can be done simply by 
reducing this circuit to the configuration shown in Figure 6.19 where Vs, Zs are the components of 
the Thevenin equivalent representing the incident field and slot in Figure 6.18. A further reduction 
to the Thevenin equivalents looking left and right from the position z inside the cabinet gives the 
circuit shown in Figure 6.20 where

In the absence of the cabinet the electric field at the same position is equivalent to the voltage Vnc

for a slot of length ℓ.39 It should be noted that such a simple formula, which does not account in any 
way for the presence of the cabinet, fails naturally to predict the cabinet resonance at around 700 
MHz but also over the entire spectrum of frequencies far removed from the resonance. Another 
FIGURE 6.19 Reduction of the circuit in Figure 6.18.
FIGURE 6.20 Reduction of the circuit in Figure 6.19 to a Thevenin equivalent.130 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
feature worthy of note is that at resonance the SE effectiveness is negative. This implies that at this 
frequency the cabinet is not providing any shielding but on the contrary enhances the field above 
its value at that point when the cabinet is absent. It is therefore necessary to consider a model of 
the entire system before any remotely reliable estimates of SE can be made. Statements commonly 
found in trade journals that a wall material has a particular value of SE offer little guidance for the 
value of SE effectiveness of a finished product made using this material. Figure 6.23 shows further 
results and comparisons with measurements confirming the good performance of this model. It 
is important to realize the limitations of the model presented here. Most notable among them is 
accounting for only one waveguide mode, neglecting the contents (loading) of the cabinet, and 
multiple and off-center apertures. 
The treatment of SE described above is limited by the inclusion of only the first cavity mode. This 
restriction may be removed at the expense of additional model complexity. Oblique incidence and 
FIGURE 6.21 Conditions in the absence of the cabinet.

off-center apertures may be similarly treated. The case of a loaded cabinet (e.g., containing PCBs) 
may be approximately treated in one of two ways. First, the propagation characteristic impedance 
and propagation constant in Equation 6.33 may be made complex to introduce losses through a cor￾rection factor that is of the order of the inverse of the Q-factor of the cabinet

where ζ ≃ Q−1≪1.
In this approach the load is distributed uniformly throughout the cabinet. In the second approach 
loads representing PCBs are located at specific point in the cabinet by introducing shunt imped￾ances at corresponding points along the transmission line representing the cabinet.40,
41 The impact 
of losses is generally to reduce the severity resonances and therefore to partially or totally eliminate 
the negative part of the SE. This may be interpreted as an improvement in SE; however, if the damp￾ing was provided by the PCBs it means that they have absorbed EM energy and hence may suffer 
the consequences of interference. The presence of damping material specifically placed inside the 
cabinet to absorb EM energy (so to speak “sacrificial” material) will naturally reduce the impact of 
the energy distributed inside the cabinet.
The model described above can also be used to account approximately for several slots by simply 
modifying Equation 6.31 to include the number of slots n:

6.6 NUMERICAL SIMULATION METHODS FOR PENETRATION 
THROUGH SHIELDS AND APERTURES
The analytical treatment of electromagnetic penetration in previous sections covered a rather 
limited range of canonical highly simplified geometries. Several approximations and simplifica￾tions were necessary in order to obtain solutions. More complex configurations may be treated 
using analytical or approximate techniques but solution difficulties increase rapidly, thus putting 
an effective limit on what can be done even by the specialists. The engineer interested in EMC is 
concerned, however, with practical systems, which at a first glance exceed in complexity anything 
that at present can be tackled analytically. The ability of the engineer to study trends in EMC 
design and to understand the behavior of systems is considerably enhanced by the development and 
use of numerical computer-based models. These models, while at present are incapable of dealing 
with every conceivable practical system, offer, nevertheless, a significant extension of the range 
of problems that can be tackled. This section is therefore devoted to describing some of the main 
numerical simulation methods and their capabilities in the area of EMC. It is not possible in this 
text to cover in detail the various methods available. However, it is hoped that sufficient detail will 
be presented to help the reader grasp what can or cannot be done with numerical methods, and 
which methods are best suited to a particular problem. It is perhaps worth pointing out at this stage 
that analytical methods and solutions to problems are still important as they provide insight into 
the significance of various parameters and also benchmarks against which numerical methods can 
be checked and evaluated.
6.6.1 Classification of Numerical Methods
Problems in EMC are, in their simplest form, posed in the following manner. An excitation or 
input representing a source of EMI is applied to the system and the response or output from 
the system is required. This is shown schematically in Figure 6.24. Solution of the problem by 
numerical means consists of obtaining a transfer function relating input and output. This func￾tion is not in a closed analytical form. Instead, it may be given as a set of numbers or graphs. If 
the input is a sinusoidal signal, then the transfer function Η(ω) relates to this specific frequency 
and the problem is said to be solved in the frequency domain. If the response to another fre￾quency is required, the simulation must be repeated. In this way, the numerical function Η(ω) 
may be obtained over a wide frequency range. Alternatively, the input may be in the form of an 
impulse, or in practice a pulse of very short duration, in which case the impulse response h(t) 
of the system is obtained. The problem is then said to be solved in the time domain. Naturally, 
other time signals may be applied, but in most cases an impulse response is sought. Numerical 
methods normally fit into one of these two classes. Knowing the frequency response Η(ω) allows 
the calculation of the impulse response h(t) and vice versa, since these two functions form a 
Fourier transform pair, i.e.,

In a problem where the steady-state response at a particular frequency is required, a frequency￾domain method may be advantageous. On the other hand, in transient problems or where the 
response over a wide band of frequencies is required, a time-domain method could be the best 
choice. Nonlinearities such as saturation are normally best dealt with in the time domain.
Another criterion that may be used to classify methods is that of the type of formulation used in 
the description of the system. Let us consider as an example the solution of an electrostatic problem. 
This may be formulated by using either Gauss’s Law in integral form (Equation 2.5) or its equiva￾lent in differential form (Equation 2.6). In a formulation based on the integral form, conditions are 
imposed on surfaces in the system. This requires discretization of these surfaces into a number of 
segments, imposition of the appropriate boundary conditions, and solution of the resulting equa￾tions. In contrast, in a differential formulation the entire volume of the problem must be discretized 
and the relevant laws applied at each point or cell. It should be evident that in an integral formula￾tion, there are fewer points to deal with compared to a differential formulation. However, in the for￾mer case the resulting equations are more difficult to solve. Integral methods deal quite rigorously 
with open boundaries, whereas differential methods require special, approximate, techniques to 
deal with such problems. In homogeneous, nonlinear, problems with complex boundaries and aper￾tures are normally best dealt with by differential methods. Finally, there are methods that are based 
on principles borrowed from optics that are applicable at high frequencies. It should be evident from 
this brief discussion that no method excels in all cases and that, therefore, a mixture of methods or 
a hybrid method may offer the best general solution technique.
In the following two sections, the application of time- and frequency-domain methods to pen￾etration problems will be discussed. Many generic numerical techniques may be applied either in 
the frequency or time domain. However, in most cases one particular formulation is the most com￾mon and efficient and the subsequent discussion is limited to this, the most popular implementation.
6.6.2 The Application of Frequency-Domain Methods
Two methods are well established in this area, namely the finite element (FE) method, and the 
method of moments (MM). Each method is briefly described below.
The finite-element (FE) method43 — This is one of the oldest numerical simulation methods, 
first developed in connection with structural problems. Its use in electromagnetic problems 
is relatively recent. Most of the EM applications are at low frequencies in eddy current 
problems encountered in machine design, but higher-frequency formulations are gradually 
being developed. A simple example from electrostatics will serve to illustrate the method. 
Let us consider a two-dimensional problem where the potential is required. In applying the 
FE method, space is divided into triangular-shaped elements as shown in Figure 6.25. The 
potential at any point inside the element is ϕ(x, y)=A+Bx+Cy where A, B, and C can be 
obtained from the potential at the vertices of the triangle. A solution for the potential at 
the vertices of all triangles in the problem is obtained by demanding that a suitable energy 
functional is minimized. For an electrostatic problem a suitable functional is the stored 
electrostatic energy. Minimization of this energy, together with the boundary conditions, 
yields a sufficient number of equations to determine the potentials at the vertices. However, 
solution of these equations requires matrix inversion and thus the number of elements that 
can be treated is limited to a few thousand. The use of triangles as basic elements gives a 
lot of flexibility in describing complex shapes. The method described is of a differential 134 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
type, thus there are difficulties when dealing with open boundary problems. One approach 
is to specify the potential at the artificial numerical boundaries, but this results in numeri￾cal artifacts in the solution. The improvement of these boundaries is the subject of continu￾ing research. In one development of the method, the wave equation in three dimensions is 
converted into a surface integral equation. These integrals are evaluated on each element 
on the boundary, rather than the whole problem space, thus resulting in what is known as 
the boundary element method (BEM) or boundary integral method (BIM).44 The result￾ing equations are fewer in number but more difficult to handle computationally. A hybrid 
formulation whereby the conventional FE method is used for interior problems and the 
BIM for exterior, open-boundary regions and the two solutions are matched at the common 
boundary is also possible.45 An example of a simulation of penetration through apertures 
using the FE method is reported in Reference 46. 
The method of moments (MM)47 — One of the difficulties when applying the FE method 
is the identification of a suitable energy functional before a minimization procedure may 
begin. An alternative approach, which overcomes this difficulty, is known as the general￾ized Galerkin’s method, or the method of weighted residuals, or the method of moments. 
The basis of the method is best illustrated by a simple example. Let us consider the solution 
of an equation of the type
L{ } Φ = ρ (6.38)
where L is an operator (e.g., ∇2
), Φ is the unknown function (e.g., potential), and ρ is a known term 
(e.g., electric charge density representing a source). The unknown function may be expanded in 
terms of N known basis function Φn so that
Φ = ∑ Φ
=
N
C
n 1
n n (6.39)
This expansion is analogous to the description of an unknown space vector in terms of its projec￾tions to three coordinate directions. In the case of function Φ, the larger N is, the better the accuracy, 
but a larger number of coefficient Cn must then be determined. Naturally, the estimate of Φ repre￾sented by Equation 6.39 when substituted into Equation 6.38 will yield a residual which is
∑ { } Φ − ρ
=
C L
n 1
N
n n
FIGURE 6.25 A basic two-dimensional element used in FE calculations.Penetration through Shields and Apertures 135
The next step in the calculation consists of demanding that this residual is zero. This can best be 
done by projecting the residual into a set of trial functions Xm and demanding that this projec￾tion (inner product of residual and Xm) is zero. This condition yields a set of N equations with N 
unknowns, the set of coefficient Cn, of the form
∑ =
=
K C b
n 1
N
mn  n m (6.40)
Equation 6.40 may then be solved using standard techniques for the coefficient Cn and thus the unknown 
function Φ in Equation 6.39 may be found. This basic scheme may be implemented in a number of 
ways and, depending on the choice of the basis Φn and test Xm functions, is known by different names. 
If the basis and test function are chosen to be the same, then the scheme is known as Galerkin’s 
method. A simple implementation whereby Equation 6.40 is satisfied at discrete points is known as 
the point, matching, or colocation method. In problems found in electromagnetics, Equation 6.38 is 
normally an integral equation. Two formulations are common. The first formulation is expressed in 
terms of the incident magnetic field and results in the magnetic field integral equation (MFIE). An 
alternative formulation based on the incident electric field results in the electric field integral equation 
(EFIE). The former formulation is particularly suited to smooth-closed bodies and large structures, 
whereas the latter is most often used to study thin wires and electrically thin structures. The EFIE may 
also be used to represent surfaces by wire-grid models. Hybrid formulations are also possible to study 
more general problems. Particular care must be taken to avoid artificial coupling between solutions 
for the internal and external regions of a problem. Examples of simulation of EM wave penetration 
through apertures using moment methods may be found in References 30, 46, and 48. A collection of 
papers on the method of moments and its applications may be found in Reference 49.
6.6.3 The Application of Time-Domain Methods
Two methods dominate time-domain simulation, namely the finite- difference time-domain (FD￾TD) method, and the transmission-line modeling (TLM) method. The principles and applications 
of each method are described briefly below.
The finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method50 — The finite- difference method 
is one of the oldest and has been used extensively to solve scalar problems such as those 
found in electrostatics, magnetostatics, fluid flow, etc. A particular implementation, famil￾iar to most readers from electrostatics, is one whereby the potential at a point, part of a 
large grid of points describing the problem, is obtained by averaging the potential of its 
nearest neighbors. This process is repeated several times until the solution converges. A 
large number of problems have been solved in this way. FD-TD is a direct solution of the 
full set of Maxwell’s differential equations in the time-domain. Space is discretized using 
what is known as the Yee-mesh,51 a basic element of which is shown in Figure 6.26. The 
electric and magnetic field components are calculated at different points in the space lattice 
as shown. A large number of such lattice elements are used to fill the problem space and to 
model various features in it. It is clear therefore that FD-TD is a differential method. The 
largest total number of elements that can be dealt with in a single problem depends on the 
computational resources available. For a typical modern workstation, a million elements is 
a useful guideline. In order to get a reasonable modeling accuracy, it is recommended that 
about ten elements per wavelength are used. This means that the largest three-dimensional 
problem that can be tackled without excessive computational demands cannot be larger 
than a few wavelengths. In open-boundary problems, where effectively the boundary is 
free space, an artificial numerical boundary must be introduced into the simulation. The 
boundary conditions appropriate for free-space boundaries are difficult to establish accu￾rately. This is a common problem to all differential methods. However, techniques have 
been developed to deal with such problems and these are continuously improved.136 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Computation proceeds as follows: All derivative terms in Maxwell’s equations are approximated 
using the central-difference scheme, and each field component is calculated at successive time￾steps. The resulting algorithm describes, therefore, a marching-in-time procedure that simulates 
the manner in which an initial electromagnetic disturbance propagates through space and interacts 
with structures until a steady state is reached. Steady state is approached after a number of periods 
of the excitation signal used, the exact number of periods depending on conditions. The maximum 
time-step that can be used is limited by stability considerations. A single computational run in the 
time domain is sufficient to obtain the impulse response. Results in the frequency domain can then 
be obtained at any frequency, within the bandwidth of the mesh, from the Fourier transform of the 
impulse response. The bandwidth of the mesh is conventionally determined by an upper frequency 
limit corresponding to a wavelength equal to ten space discretization lengths.
A large number of problems of some considerable complexity have been studied using the FD-TD 
method. It is particularly suited to studying penetration through slots and apertures in enclosures of 
a general shape. Fairly complicated structures may be described. Of particular interest are thin slits 
of complicated shape. In such cases, it is unreasonable to use a space discretization length that is 
dictated by the finest feature of the slit. Techniques have been developed to deal with this situation 
by defining equivalent ε andμto describe a narrow slit in a problem described by a coarse mesh52
or by a multigrid mesh,53 or, alternatively, by a contour path model based on Faraday’s Law.54 These 
techniques are described as thin-slot formulations. A typical problem of a lapped U-shaped joint 
in a screen 0.3 wavelengths long is shown in Figure 6.27. The path length through the lapped joint 
ABCDEF is chosen to be equal to 0.45, thus giving highly resonant conditions. Results for the field 
along path ABCDEF are presented in References 50 and 54. They show good agreement between 
results obtained using a fine mesh to describe the joint (Δl=0.025λ), and coarse mesh (Δ1=0.09λ) 
coupled with a thin-slot formulation. A number of other similar problems have also been solved 
using FD-TD.55,56
The transmission-line modeling (TLM) method57 — A time-domain differential method 
that has many similarities with the FD-TD method is the transmission-line modeling 
(TLM) method. Many issues concerning problem definition, selection of space discretiza￾tion length, and open- space boundaries, are the same as for the FD-TD method. However, 
the modeling philosophy is different. While the FD-TD scheme is an algorithm for solving 
FIGURE 6.26 Schematic of an element of a three-dimensional Yee-mesh.Penetration through Shields and Apertures 137
the differential equations describing the EM field, TLM approaches the problem differ￾ently by constructing in effect a network of interconnected transmission lines on which 
voltage and current pulses are exact analogues of electric and magnetic fields. It can be 
shown that the resulting transmission-line equations and Maxwell’s equations have the 
same form and thus the network can be used as a model to describe the EM field. A block 
in space of volume (Δ1)3 is represented by twelve transmission-line segments (two per 
coordinate direction) interconnected at a node. The node most commonly used for three￾dimensional problems is the symmetrical condensed node described in Reference 58 and 
shown in Figure 6.28. The space length l, time-step t, and the wave propagation velocity 
u in the modeled medium are related by the expression Δt=Δl/2u). Computation in TLM 
proceeds as follows: at each time-step, voltage pulses Vi
 are incident at each of the twelve 
transmission-line ports. These pulses are scattered at the node according to transmission￾line theory, to produce twelve reflected pulses Vr
 where
V V = [ ] S r i (6.41)
The matrix [S] is known as the scattering matrix and it has a very simple form.58 The initial condi￾tions provide the values of all incident voltage pulses at all the nodes at the start of the simulation. The 
scattered pulses are then obtained by applying Equation 6.41 at all the nodes. The incident voltages 
at the next time-step are obtained easily from the position of each node in the mesh. For example, the 
incident voltage at port 1 of node (x, y, z) at time-step k+1, is equal to the voltage scattered from port 
12 of node (x, y −1, z) at the previous time-step k. This process, which is described as “connection,” 
is repeated for all nodes and ports in the problem. Thus, “scattering” and “connection” follow each 
other for as long as desired. At any time, field components may be obtained from the incident voltage 
pulses. For example, the electric field component in the x-direction at node (x, y, z) and time-step k is

where the incident voltages are obtained from the relevant ports of node (x, y, z) at time-step k. 
Similar expressions apply for the other field components. Losses and different values of ε andμmay 
be incorporated in TLM by introducing stubs.58–60 Irregularly shaped nodes may be modeled effi￾ciently using the hybrid node.61,62 A multigrid formulation has also been developed to model fine 
features in more detail.63 Results of simulations for EM wave penetration through imperfectly 
conducting walls (such as carbon fiber composite panels) may be obtained using a multisection 
transmission-line model of the wall interposed between the symmetrical condensed nodes placed 
at either side of the wall, as described in Reference 64. A narrow slot formulation is also available 
to deal with penetration through apertures.65 Further details on the fundamentals and application of 
this method may be found in Reference 66.
6.7 TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE APERTURES THROUGH 
A DIGITAL FILTER INTERFACE
In the previous section we have seen ways by which SE may be estimated using a range of analytical 
and numerical tools. Broadly speaking, accuracy has to be traded against model complexity. Full￾field models are accurate and permit us to accommodate a range of features in simulations. There 
are, however, computer intensive and thus for many practical configurations their use is not realistic. 
A particular example, which is common in practical situations, is the calculation of SE in a cabinet 
with a large number of apertures, e.g., ventilation holes as shown in Figure 6.29. Neither the cabinet 
nor the apertures need have a canonical shape (e.g., round holes and rectangular cabinet) and the 
cabinet may contain particular features (wires, PCBs, etc.) that we need to model. The intermediate 
modes cannot accommodate such general configurations and the full-field ones become seriously 
FIGURE 6.28 Schematic of a three-dimensional symmetrical condensed node of a TLM mesh.Penetration through Shields and Apertures 139
inefficient. One has to contemplate modeling perhaps one hundred holes in a full-field code where 
the outlines of each have to be mapped on a very fine mesh. This task, apart from leading to an enor￾mous computation, is extremely tedious, time consuming, and prone to errors at the data entry stage. 
It is therefore important to seek ways where such features may be incorporated into full-field codes 
in a more efficient manner. The purpose of this section is to introduce a technique for doing just this.
We illustrate the approach by reference to the TLM full-field modeling technique. In Figure 
6.30 two adjacent TLM nodes (computational cells) are shown. We will treat the case where at the 
interface between the cells we insert a perforated conducting screen as shown in Figure 6.29. But 
first let us look at the case where no screen is present. Then across the interface a simple exchange 
of pulses takes place, i.e.,

These expressions show the incident pulses at the node to the right at the next (k+1) time-step as a func￾tion of the pulse reflected from the node to the left at the previous (k) time-step. Similar expressions 
apply for the pulses incident at the node to the left. This process is extremely simple — a straightforward 
exchange. How would this simple exchange be modified if a conducting screen were introduced? Let 
us first consider the extreme case of a perfectly conducting screen (no perforations) inserted between 
the two nodes. In such a case any pulses reflected from a node encounter the perfect electric conductor 
(PEC) and are returned to the same node with opposite sign. The expressions are therefore modified to

FIGURE 6.29 A conducting cabinet with perforations for cooling.
FIGURE 6.30 Computation across a boundary where a thin perforated panel may be placed.140 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
It is now time to consider the case where the conducting screen is perforated. It is obvious that this 
is an intermediate case between no screen and a perfectly conducting screen — part of the reflected 
signal will pass through as in Equation 6.42 and part will be reflected as in Equation 6.43. It stands 
to reason that the amount of transmission through and reflection from the screen will be dependent 
on the relative size of the wavelength and of the perforations. The exchange of pulses between the 
two nodes is a scattering event that is frequency dependent. The exchange of pulses is described 
through the scattering process in the equation

where R and T are reflection and transmission coefficients through the screen that are frequency 
dependent. The difficulty in incorporating this frequency-dependent procedure into a time-domain 
model can be overcome by adopting formal procedures extensively used in signal processing to 
obtain a digital filter (a procedure in the time domain) that is equivalent to an analogue filter (speci￾fied in the frequency domain). An outline of the steps taken is shown in Figure 6.31.
The first step is to specify the scattering matrix S(ω). This can be done either analytically, from 
measurements, or by numerical simulations on a single cell of a periodic cluster of perforations. In 
this way the frequency- dependent elements Sij(ω) of the scattering matrix may be obtained. It is a 
distinct advantage that this can be done in three different ways as indicated, thus giving a compact 
and flexible specification of the screen properties. Each scattering element may be described by a 
number of poles and zeros and expressed in the form

where NP is the number of poles and s=jω. The extraction of the poles and zeros is done using the 
frequency-domain Prony method.67 The required number of poles NP depends on the complexity of 
the screen response and also on the required accuracy. We will not dwell on this technique as it is

A full definition of these coefficients may be found in Reference 69. Equations 6.52 and 6.53 
describe a procedure in the time-domain that is embodied in the diagram shown in Figure 6.32. 
It effectively replaces Equation 6.42 for the case without a screen and Equation 6.43 for the case 
for a perfectly conducting screen without perforations. It describes the scattering by the screen in 
the time domain and it has the form of an equivalent digital filter. We may describe it as a digital 
filter interface (DFI). Using the DFI, any type of perforations, materials, and composites may be 
represented efficiently without the need to mesh directly the configuration of the screen. This offers 
great economy both in data preparation and during the simulation run. As an illustration, we show 
results for the configuration shown in Figure 6.33. For this type of perforations. analytical results 
for the scattering coefficient in the frequency-domain are available.70 The electric SE is shown in 
Figure 6.34 for two model discretization lengths and is compared to measurements. This simulation

is comparable in efficiency to that without perforations and it therefore represents a major model 
improvement. Further details may be found in References 67 and 71. 
6.8 FURTHER WORK RELEVANT TO SHIELDING
In this chapter, the basic theory relating to diffusive penetration through finite electrical conductiv￾ity screens and through apertures was presented. Emphasis was placed on understanding the basis of 
these calculations and the inherent approximations. The main numerical simulation techniques that 
may be used to study complex practical problems were described in the last sections. The practical 
design of equipment cabinets and screens and the electromagnetic environment inside and around 
such equipment is also dependent on wire penetrations, propagation, and crosstalk between trans￾mission systems, etc. These topics are examined in the next two chapters. More practical aspects 
and design rules for shielding are discussed in Chapter 10.

7 Propagation and Crosstalk
In Chapter 6, the penetration of electromagnetic energy through shields and apertures was stud￾ied. Irrespective of the exact manner of penetration, this energy most often couples into wires 
that are part of transmission lines, such as ribbon cables and printed circuit boards. Energy thus 
propagates, guided by the wires, to spread throughout the system and cause further interference. 
The purpose of this chapter is to address the problem of propagation and coupling to the field and 
between wires.
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Electrical signals may appear on a transmission line due to a variety of influences. One obvious 
possibility is the case where the transmission line shares a common path with another line. In such 
cases current flow on one line will produce an interference signal on the other line, in what is called 
“conducted” interference. This type of interference is relatively easy to identify as it involves a vis￾ible physical connection between the circuits. A different coupling path, which does not involve a 
physical connection between circuits, is the origin of what is described as “radiated” interference. 
This mechanism in turn involves several processes that contribute in a different measure in each 
practical problem. It is useful to divide “radiated” interference into several regimes, namely, capaci￾tive, inductive, and radiated interference. Although a sharp dividing line cannot be drawn between 
these different regimes, each appears dominant under particular circumstances. Each coupling 
regime is described briefly below.
Capacitive coupling is particularly evident when two high-impedance circuits are in close prox￾imity to each other and carry low-frequency signals. A schematic of such a circuit is shown in 
Figure 7.1a. Any potential difference v1 appearing on conductor 1 will cause an interference signal 
to appear on conductor 2 equal to
= +
v
C
C C 2 v 12
12 2
1 (7.1)
If the resistance to ground of conductor 2 is comparable to the capacitive impedance at the signal 
frequency, then it can be added in parallel to C2, thus modifying Equation 7.1 at high frequencies.
Capacitive coupling may be modified by the addition of a shield around conductor 2, as shown in 
Figure 7.1b. If the shield has no DC connection to ground its potential will rise to
= +
V C
C C s V 1s
1s s
1 (7.2)
and since there is no current flow through C2S conductor 2 will rise to the same potential. If, how￾ever, the shield is connected to ground, then vs=0 and so is the induced voltage on conductor 2. The 
situation whereby the shield over conductor 2 is not complete is an intermediate situation between 
the two cases just considered. 
Inductive coupling appears dominant in low-impedance circuits in close proximity to each other 
carrying low-frequency signals. Referring to the circuit shown in Figure 7.1, the voltage induced on 
conductor 2 when a current i1 flows in conductor 1 is
v M 2 1 = 2 1 di /dt (7.3)
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-9148 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
where M12 is the mutual impedance between the two circuits. If a nonmagnetic shield is added to 
conductor 2 as shown in Figure 7.1b, the voltage induced on the shield is
v M di /dt s 1 = s 1 (7.4)
If the shield is floating or connected to earth at one point only, no shield current flows and hence the 
voltage induced in conductor 2 remains unchanged, as given by Equation 7.3. If, however, the shield 
is grounded at both ends then the induced voltage given by Equation 7.4 will drive a shield current is
and an additional voltage will be induced on conductor 2 due to this current. This additional voltage 
is equal to M2S (dis/dt) where M2S is the mutual inductance between the shield and conductor 2. If the 
geometry of the shield and the distribution of current on its circumference is such that no magnetic 
field is established within the shield then all the magnetic flux Φ established by is is also linked with 
conductor 2, hence M2S =Φ/is=Lsis/is=Ls where Ls is the self-inductance of the shield.
The total induced voltage, assuming harmonic variation, is thus

As the frequency increases, and for ω≫Rs/Ls, the induced voltage tends to
V2 1 = M I 2 1R / s s L (high-frequency)
At low frequencies, the induced voltage is unaffected by the shield and tends to
V2 1 = ωj M 2 1I
FIGURE 7.1 Configuration used to study coupling between circuits 1 and 2 (a) and modifications in the 
presence of a shield (b).Propagation and Crosstalk 149
More detailed calculations for a variety of configurations may be found in References 1 and 2.
The methodology used above for capacitive and inductive coupling calculations breaks down as 
the frequency increases and lines become electrically long, i.e., their physical length becomes com￾parable to the wavelength. Coupling between lines separated by larger distances cannot be regarded 
as either capacitive or inductive. Instead, energy from the sources of interference propagates in the 
form of electromagnetic waves that impinge on other lines, thus causing EMI. This mode of cou￾pling is referred to as radiated interference. Depending on the distance between the source and the 
victim of interference, a further subdivision to far-field radiated interference and near-field radiated 
interference can be made. If the victim circuit is sufficiently far from the source of EMI so that 
fields decay with distance as 1/r (typically for distances larger than λ/2π), then far-field conditions 
prevail. Otherwise, coupling takes place under nearfield radiative conditions with a mixture of field 
components decaying as 1/r, 1/r2, and 1/r3. This can be confirmed by studying the structure of the 
field near a dipole given by Equations 2.62 and 2.63.
Coupling under these conditions, and propagation in electrically long lines, is therefore a very 
complex matter and cannot be easily understood by resorting to simple lumped circuit concepts 
alone. The purpose of this chapter is to address these issues and present appropriate tools and meth￾odologies for predicting propagation and field-to-wire coupling.
7.2 BASIC PRINCIPLES
The basic principles of propagation in multiconductor systems are presented in this section. A 
simple two-wire above-ground system is studied in detail in order to establish the main features 
of propagation in multiconductor systems. This treatment is followed by a generalization to more 
complex configurations.
Let us consider the system shown in Figure 7.2 consisting of two wires, each with capacitance C1
to ground, self-inductance Ls, and with mutual capacitance and inductance C2 and M, respectively.

A similar equation may be obtained for the current. Equation 7.10 indicates that voltages v1 and v2
are coupled through the off-diagonal elements b. It is convenient to seek another set of voltages, say 
vm1 and vm2, referred to as modal voltages, which are decoupled. The modal voltages are related to

These equations describe two independent modes of propagation. Mode 1 propagates with a veloc￾ity u 1 1 = + / a b, whereas mode 2 has a velocity u 1 2 = − / a b.
The modal voltages are related to the conductor voltages, through matrix [S], Equation 7.11. The

In physical terms this expression is equivalent to demanding that if voltage v1 and current i1 are estab￾lished on conductor 1, the voltage inductively coupled to 2 is equal to the capacitively coupled voltage. 
Under these circumstances, the two modes propagate at the same velocity. In a lossless system, with 
a uniform dielectric, Equation 7.22 holds. However, losses and/or a nonuniform dielectric, such as the 
presence of insulator sleeves on the wires, make the modal velocities different. A signal induced or 
generated at a point on a line will couple to adjacent lines in amounts determined by the parameters of 
the line. Energy then propagates along the lines toward their load terminations. If the modal velocities 
are the same, the modal signals arrive at the loads simultaneously and combine to produce the total 
signal on each of the lines. If, however, the modal velocities are different, modal components arrive at 
the loads at different times and thus combine to impress total signals at the loads, which are different 
in magnitude and shape from those at the point of origin of the signal. Thus, different modal velocities 
result in dispersion and different severity of crosstalk depending on the line length.
In a multiconductor system with n conductors plus ground, there are, in general, n modes of 
propagation.
The basic model described above for the two-wire plus ground system may be generalized to 
deal with any number of wires. The treatment of the two-wire line above ground presented so far 
is clearly in the time domain. Voltages and currents on the lines are time-dependent functions. The 
general multiconductor equations in the time domain are

where [v] and [i] are column vectors with elements the voltage to ground and the current for each 
conductor. The square matrices [L] and [C] represent inductive and capacitive coupling between 
the lines and are discussed further in Section 7.2. Losses may be included in this formulation in a 
straightforward manner.3Propagation and Crosstalk 153
Equations 7.23 and 7.24 describe propagation and mutual coupling between lines (crosstalk) in 
a multiconductor system. If the lines are subject to an external incident electromagnetic field, addi￾tional source terms must be incorporated into the model. Thus, Equations 7.8 and 7.9, generalized 
to include coupling to the external field, are

The equations given above may be easily expressed in the frequency domain. In this formulation 
v x() () and I x represent the voltage and current phasors of a harmonic signal of frequency ω. Thus, 
the equivalents of Equations 7.25 and 7.26 in the frequency-domain are4,5

The general procedures for solving these equations, either in the time or frequency domains, is to 
decompose into modal components and solve the resulting simpler, uncoupled equations. In a lossless 
line with uniform dielectric, such decomposition is possible in both time and frequency domains. For 
asymmetrical lines with losses there is no unique decomposition matrix valid at all frequencies. In 
such cases, strict modal decomposition is not possible in the time domain. Approximate decomposition 
may then be achieved by obtaining the [S] matrix in the frequency domain at a particular frequency, 
corresponding to the peak of the wave spectrum, and using the real part of these matrices for time￾domain decomposition. This approach normally gives small errors but must be used with caution. 
Further details of the formulation and solution of multiconductor equations are given in Section 7.4.
The previous derivation illustrates the complexity of coupling in interconnect configurations. 
Such a practical configuration is shown in Figure 7.3. The line generating interference (indicated 
by the letter G for generator of interference) is fed at one end by a voltage source in series with a 
resistance (the “near end” — NE) and terminated at the other end by a resistive load (the “far end” 
— FE). The victim line (indicated by the letter R for the receiver of interference) is terminated at 
both ends by resistive loads. This is a classic crosstalk problem whereby signals propagating on line 
G couple through to line R. We are interested on calculating the voltages VNE (near-end coupling) 
and VFE (far-end coupling). The problem can be solved using the principles already outlined subject 
to the appropriate boundary conditions. Further details may be found in the work of Paul.6

We summarize here the main results. The starting point is the [L] and [C] matrices of the con￾figuration that are obtained from the geometrical details and material properties of the lines. This is 
discussed further in Section 7.3 and some formulae are provided in Appendix B.

In these equations k represents the strength of coupling between the lines and the other symbols 
have their usual meaning.
These are exact equations within the limitations of TL theory, i.e., it is assumed that we have 
TEM conditions. Under TEM conditions line parameters can be calculated as shown in the next sec￾tion. TEM conditions means that the electric and magnetic field components are perpendicular to 
each other and transverse to the direction of propagation. Consequences of this are that waves prop￾agate along the axis of the TL; the E and H field are solutions of the two-dimensional electrostatic 
and magnetostatic equations respectively; the line integral of the electric field from one conductor 
to another (the potential difference V) has a unique value and thus a unique value of capacitance 
may be defined (C=Q/V); the line integral of the magnetic field around each conductor has a unique 
value (conductor current I) and thus a unique value of inductance may be defined (L=Φ/I); and the 
velocity of propagation is independent of the cross-sectional dimensions of the line and depends 
only on the properties of the surrounding medium. These conditions hold for many practical con￾figurations but there are cases where TEM conditions do not apply and hence the transmission line 
equations are not strictly accurate. Examples of violations of the TEM conditions are that as the skin 
effect becomes prominent at high frequencies, R increases and L decreases with frequency result￾ing in longitudinal field components. Normally R variations are accounted for and variations in L 
are neglected (the latter violates causality and results in signal precursors). Another violation is due 
to the presence of inhomogeneous materials that results in small longitudinal field components. It 
is naturally implied in the use of these equations that there is no significant radiation loss from the 
lines. Provided TEM holds approximately (quasi-TEM approximation), reasonable estimates can be 
made using the equation with the line parameters calculated as shown in Section 7.4.
We can simplify Equation 7.30 under certain conditions. For electrically short lines (ℓ≪λ) and 
for weak coupling (k≪1), we obtain

These equations are simple enough to make it possible to comment in simple physical terms about 
the nature of coupling. The following observations are relevant:
• The first term on the RHS represents inductive coupling
• The second term represents capacitive coupling
• Coupling is proportional to frequency (faster signal transitions result in more crosstalk)
• Capacitive coupling at the near and far ends is of the same sign
• Inductive coupling is of opposite sign at the near and far ends; in principle, it is therefore 
possible to select terminations to reduce or cancel out coupling at the far end156 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The simplified equations in Equation 7.32 may be represented by the simple coupling circuit shown 
in Figure 7.4 where the impact of the proximity of the generator line is accounted for by the voltage 
and current sources shown.
It is repeated here that the expressions in Equation 7.30 are applicable in the TEM approximation 
and the following expressions are subject to further low-frequency conditions.
Also, as already pointed out in connection with Equation 7.22, propagation takes place at dif￾ferent modes that have a different velocity if Equation 7.22 is not satisfied. It is easy to see that 
this will be the case in lines that are surrounded by inhomogeneous dielectric. In Figure 7.5a two 
conductors are placed inside dielectric ε1, which is then surrounded by dielectric ε2. The equivalent 
circuit is shown in Figure 7.5b. If ε1=ε2, Equation 7.22 is satisfied and propagation proceeds at a 
single velocity (degenerate case). If, however, ε1>ε2, then C2 is larger than for the same dielectric 
case and C1 smaller. Therefore the RHS of Equation 7.22 is larger than before, while the LHS has 
the same value since inductance does not depend on the values of dielectric permittivity. Equation 
7.22 is therefore not satisfied and each mode propagates at different velocity (nondegenerate case). 
This can have significant impact on crosstalk and signal distortion (EMC and Signal Integrity [SI] 
implications). This is demonstrated in Figure 7.6a where the two lines in a three-line configuration 
are shown schematically. At the source end the driven (generator) line has voltage Vs impressed 
on it and the victim (receiver) line has zero volts. The excitation conditions may be decomposed 
into even (common) and odd (differential) mode components using Equation 7.18 as shown sche￾matically. Assuming for illustration that the even mode propagates faster, then the modal conditions 
some distance down the lines will be as shown in Figure 7.6b. Using Equation 7.18 solved for the 
total voltages and using the modal voltage component indicated in the figure gives the total voltages 
on each line shown at the top of the illustration in Figure 7.6b. We observe that the total voltage on 
the driven line is distorted (SI issue) and that due to crosstalk there are very short-duration pulses 
on the victim line (EMC issue). When one considers the large number of interconnects with mixed 
dielectrics in real systems, the potential of these very sharp spikes to generate high-frequency noise 
can be appreciated. 
FIGURE 7.5 Schematic showing two wires inside two dielectrics (a) and the corresponding circuit equiva￾lent (b).
FIGURE 7.4 Schematic of the coupling model at low frequencies.Propagation and Crosstalk 157
At very high frequencies, where the line dimensions become comparable to the wavelength, 
a full-field solution is required based on Maxwell’s equations. Normally, numerical solutions are 
sought to take full account of line behavior.
A particular example, where adjustments must be made to the transmission line equations to 
extend their validity, is in cases where the line has a bend. It is known that a sharp bend on a PCB 
track violates TEM conditions as at the bend point significant radiation takes place. Naturally, 
this phenomenon may be studied fully using full-field numerical solutions of Maxwell’s equations. 
Nevertheless, TL models may still be used to get approximate solutions provided special sections 
are inserted into the model to represent the line near the bend. Traditionally, reactive components 
are inserted to account for the discontinuity caused by the bend. No account can thus be taken of 
radiation from the bend. More sophisticated techniques were developed where these sections (span￾ning a distance of approximately one wavelength around the bend) contain frequency and position￾dependent reactive and dissipative elements accounting for radiation loss and signal distortion near 
the bend. This approach is based on the theoretical framework described in Reference 7.
Details of the development of this scheme and its implementation for EMC and SI applications 
may be found in References 8 and 9.
7.3 LINE PARAMETER CALCULATION
Formulae for calculating the inductance and capacitance of typical conductor configurations are 
given in Appendix B. The complexity of practical multiconductor configurations is such that it is 
not possible to give a comprehensive coverage of this topic. In most cases, analytical solutions are 
not available and the designer has to resort to numerical methods in order to obtain numerical val￾ues. Thus, at first sight, it might seem unnecessary even to attempt to obtain analytical solutions. 
There are, however, two strong reasons to spend some time looking at analytical solutions. First, a 
systematic examination of the problem, which is inherent in the process of obtaining analytical solu￾tions, makes assumptions, simplifications, and major features of the problem explicit and thus helps 
the designer to ask the right questions when confronted with a more intractable problem. Second, 
although analytical solutions are only possible in a few idealized configurations, they may still be 
FIGURE 7.6 Explanation of propagation with even (common) and odd (differential) modes (a) and condi￾tions further down the line (b).158 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
used with minor adaptations as a first approximation to more complex configurations. The basic elec￾trical parameters, inductance and capacitance, are normally logarithmic functions of the geometrical 
dimensions and shape factors, and thus vary slowly with changes in these parameters. In the next two 
subsections, analytical and numerical methods for obtaining line parameters are presented.
7.3.1 Analytical Methods
The background to electromagnetic calculations was described in Chapters 2 and 3. The ideas 
developed there are applied to a few typical configurations shown schematically in Figure 7.7.
The parameters of the parallel conductor line shown in Figure 7.7a may be easily obtained if the 
assumption is made that the charge or current distribution on each conductor is uniform, unaffected 
by the proximity of the other conductor. This is clearly approximately true when d≫r. In such 
cases the electric field at point A a distance x away from one of the conductors carrying a charge q 
coulombs per meter length is

An alternative approach that is often used is to recognize that the velocity of propagation on the line 
shown in Figure 7.7a is
µε = 1 1
LC (7.36)
where C and L are given by Equations 7.29 and 7.31. Thus, the capacitance only need be calculated from 
the conductor configuration and the inductance can then be obtained directly from Equation 7.36.
For the conductor above perfect ground configuration shown in Figure 7.7b, the method of images 
may be employed whereby an equivalent, image conductor is assumed. This results in two parallel 
conductors a distance 2h apart. The capacitance between conductor and earth is then obtained by 
calculating the potential difference V in the equivalent problem between one of the conductors and 
the midplane, and by dividing q by V, i.e.,
C 2π
ln 2h r

= , in F/m ε
 −


(7.37)
A similar approach may be used to calculate inductance. In cases where a perfectly conducting plane 
cannot be assumed, such as when a conductor runs above rocky soil, simple image theory cannot be 
used and a more sophisticated approach is necessary. In a formulation due to Carson,11 the depth dg of 
the image conductor used for calculating inductance is not taken equal to h but is given by the formula 
dg = ρ 660 / f meters, where ρ and f are the ground resistivity and signal frequency, respectively. A 
more complete description of propagation in such a configuration may be found in Referenced 12.
Conductor configurations such as the one shown in Figure 7.7c are easily dealt with by applying 
the method of images. This results in a conductor configuration in free space consisting of the two 
original conductors plus the two images. The charge per unit length q1 and q2 on each conductor and 
the respective voltages v1 and v2 with respect to ground are related by the expressions

D is the distance between one charge and the image of the other charge. Taking the case of d=8r, 
h=3r, which corresponds, approximately, to two tracks above a ground plane on a printed circuit 
board, and substituting in Equation 7.38 gives
c c 11 22 = = 63 pF/mand c12 21 = = c 7.8pF − /m
The capacitance between each conductor and ground is
C C 1 2 ==+= c c 11 12 55pF/m
and the mutual capacitance between the two conductors is
C c 12 12 = − = 7.8pF/m
Configurations where the conductor cross section is not circular may be treated approximately in a 
similar way by using equivalent radii and the geometric mean distance between conductors.
Difficulties sometimes arise when considering the inductance of a wire segment part of a loop. 
An efficient approach is to obtain the loop inductance through the vector potential A
L
d1
I
c
A ∫ = (7.39)
where I is the current in the loop and the integration path c coincides with the loop. Thus, the induc￾tance of a loop segment i may be interpreted as the contribution from the integral in Equation 7.35 
along that segment, and it consists of a self-inductance term Lii (due to magnetic flux produced by 
current in the segment) and mutual-inductance terms Lij due to fluxes produced by current in other 
segments j and linked to i. The total inductance of the segment is the sum of all partial inductances 
Lii and Lij. In geometrical terms, the partial self-inductance Lii may be interpreted as the ratio of the 
magnetic flux produced by Ii
 crossing an area extending between the segment and infinity, over the 
current Ii
. Similarly, Lij is the ratio of the magnetic flux produced by Ij
 crossing an area extending 
from segment i and infinity, over the current Ij
. These ideas are illustrated in Figure 7.8 where we 
have used symbols Lp and Mp for the self and mutual partial inductances of a segment, respectively. 
We illustrate these concepts by examples for a two-wire and three-wire line. Two segments of a 
line are shown in Figure 7.9a where Lp and Mp are self and mutual partial inductances as indicated 
earlier. V1and V2 are the voltage drops along each segment and are given by

We will now consider the inductance presented by this arrangement to common-mode currents, 
i.e., when the three segments are as shown in Figure 7.10b. Here we have I1=I2=I/2 and I3=− I.

The equivalent circuit for this arrangement is shown in Figure 7.10c. We see, therefore, that depend￾ing on the nature of the currents (common or differential form) the inductance presented will be 
different. We give for reference in Figure 7.11 the partial self inductance of a segment and the 
mutual partial inductance of two segments. A more thorough discussion of these matters may be 
found in Reference 13. Formulae for the calculation of inductance may be found in Appendix B and 
in References 14 and 15.
It should be emphasized that inductance and capacitance are quasistatic concepts and that the 
values calculated above apply for quasi-TEM wave propagation. At high frequencies, when the line 
spacing becomes comparable to the wavelength, and a modal field structure is established between 
the lines, complete field solutions must be sought.
Another factor that sometimes must be taken into account is the contribution due to end effects. 
A parallel wire line such as the one shown in Figure 7.7a has a capacitance per unit length ade￾quately described by Equations 7.33 or 7.34 away from its ends. At an open-circuit end there will 
be a fringing electric field that adds extra capacitance Cf
 to the line. This may be added at the open￾circuit termination to describe better the behavior of the line. Alternatively, the fringing capacitance 
may be viewed as increasing the electrical length of the line by an amount Δ1=Cf/C where C is the 
line capacitance per meter length away from the ends. An empirical formula used to quantify these 
effects is given below.16

7.3.2 Numerical Methods
The analytical approach may be used in many practical configurations but, inevitably, there are 
many problems that are not amenable to this type of treatment. Irregularly shaped conductors or 
configurations, such as the one shown in Figure 7.7d, where the two conductors are partially covered 
by plastic insulating material (ribbon cable) must be analyzed using numerical techniques. Rough 
approximations can sometimes be made by assuming that the conductors are immersed in a uniform 
dielectric of an “equivalent” permittivity.
Numerical solutions involve considerable complexity and are often based on the method of 
moments (MM). There are several ways of applying the MM to such problems.17–19 A popular 
approach is to expand the unknown surface charge density in terms of known harmonic bases func￾tions. Thus, for a dielectric-coated conductor i there will be two expansions. First, the surface charge 
density on the conductor (free plus bound charge) at any angular position θi
 is expressed in the form
σ θ i i ( ) = + a a io im ∑ θ cos m() () i i + ∑b s m i in mθ
Coefficients ai
 and bi
 are unknowns to be determined.
Second, the surface-bound charge density at the outer surface of the dielectric coating is 
expressed in a similar way with a different set of unknown coefficients ai.
'
 This process is repeated 
for each conductor in the system. The equations necessary for calculating the unknown coefficients 
are obtained by enforcing the boundary conditions on a number of points sufficient to yield the 
correct number of equations. Solving these equations gives the expansion coefficients and thus all 
charge densities. The capacitance coefficients are then obtained from the matrix equation [q]=[c] 
[V]. The boundary conditions are that the surface of each conductor is an equipotential and that the 
normal component of the electric flux density is continuous across the boundary between two ideal 
dielectrics.
This technique, and its adaptations, can be used in a variety of problems. A PC-based computer 
package for obtaining the matrix parameters of multiconductor lines is described in Reference 20.
It should be noted that once the capacitance coefficients [c] have been obtained, the inductance 
coefficients [L] may be calculated from [co] obtained by replacing the coating by the surrounding 
medium (normally air). Since this change does not affect the magnetic properties, it follows that
[ ] =  [ ]  
 − L 1 / u0 c 2 o

where uo is the propagation velocity in the surrounding medium.
7.4 REPRESENTATION OF EM COUPLING FROM EXTERNAL FIELDS
A fundamental problem in EMC analysis is the determination of the coupling of energy transported 
by an electromagnetic field onto a transmission line. The source of the EM wave may be other adja￾cent circuits. In this section the basic approaches to tackling such problems will be described. These 
allow the determination of the amplitude and spectral content of induced signals for a range of 
electromagnetic threats and thus assist in assessing the susceptibility of equipment to such threats.
It is assumed, for simplicity throughout, that quasi-TEM conditions apply and that the parallel 
wire line carries equal and opposite currents (differential mode). The starting point in establishing 
a coupling model is to express Faraday’s Law on the loop shown by a broken line in Figure 7.12.17,22

the total magnetic field (Hz) and the total component of the electric field perpendicular to the direc￾tion of propagation (Ey). An alternative, equivalent formulation is possible, where the total current

A typical problem is the determination of the signal coupled to a line subject to incident EM 
plane waves. Three configurations are the most common, sidefire, broadside, and endfire as shown 
in Figure 7.14. In this figure the electric field vector and direction of propagation are shown.26

We summarize results here for a number of cases of increasing complexity. We can distinguish 
three cases: lines that are electrically short (low frequency case), lines of medium electrical length, 
and lines that are electrically long.
For the simplest case of electrically short lines we neglect the distributed L, C, lump excitation 
sources together, neglect reradiation from the line, and assuming line terminations of the same 
order as the line characteristic impedance, we obtain for sidefire excitation

It remains to discuss the high-frequency case where radiation losses cannot be neglected. In this 
case a numerical solution is normally the best way to proceed. Further details may be found in 
References 26 and 27.
The case of a wire above ground (e.g., a PCB track above a conducting backplane) can be simi￾larly treated by transforming it into a parallel wire case using the method of images.
An alternative approach is to seek a solution in the time domain. An efficient formulation is to 
use the transmission-line modeling (TLM) method, whereby the line is described by a cascade of 
sections similar to that shown in Figure 7.13a.28 The lossless section may be replaced by a trans￾mission line segment of characteristic impedance Z L = d d / C as shown in Figure 7.13b and for 
symmetry the voltage source term is shared equally either side of the current source term. For 
generality, the characteristic impedance is taken to be different on adjacent sections to represent a 
nonuniform line. The propagation time along each transmission line segment is chosen to be the 
same Δt along the line to simplify computation. The voltage VN at node M a distance x=N·Δx 
along the line can be obtained at any time, multiple of Δt, from the value of the incident voltages

Similar expressions may be derived at the source and load nodes. Computation proceeds as follows:
1. The value of all incident voltages is determined at the start of the calculation from the 
initial conditions
2. Voltages and current at all nodes are obtained from expressions such as Equation 7.63 and 
its equivalent for source and load nodes
3. The voltages reflected from each node are obtained from Equation 7.64 and its equivalent 
for source and load nodes
4. The incident voltages at the next time step n+1 are obtained from the reflected voltages at 
the previous time step n and depend on the topology of the network, i.e.,

The frequency- and time-domain solution techniques may be generalized to deal with multiconduc￾tor multimode problems such as those depicted in Figure 7.7d. A description of the frequency-domain 
method applied to such a problem may be found in Reference 29. The time-domain solution method 
is presented here in some detail because of its applicability to a wide range of EMC problems.
Lossless multiconductor problems where all modes propagate at the same velocity, may be tack￾led by the methods described in Reference 30. The approach adopted may be described by reference 
to a two-conductor system above ground. A schematic of each line showing incident and reflected 
voltages is shown in Figure 7.15, where solid arrows indicate polarity and broken arrows indicate 
direction of propagation. The total voltage on any line segment is the sum of incident and reflected

Scattering of pulses at the start (source end) and the end of the lines (load end) may be similarly 
treated.30 Computation proceeds by following the same five steps as described in connection with 
propagation along a single line. Losses may be introduced by adding suitable resistive elements 
between lossless sections.
The case of multiconductor propagation where modes have different propagation velocities has 
been treated in Reference 31. The first step in the computation is to obtain the modal components 
and the corresponding propagation velocities for each mode. The problem is then separated into 
external coupling regions, mode conversion, and mode propagation regions, as shown in Figure 7.16
for a three-conductor line above ground. At each section Δx, modal voltage and currents are con￾verted to line components and are combined with source terms to account for external coupling 
with an EM field. The resulting line components are converted into modal components, which then 
propagate on the three lines represented by the appropriate modal impedances. Upon traversing a 
distance Δx, the modal components are converted into line components to be combined with the 
external coupling sources. This process is repeated for the total number of sections in the model. 
One complication that arises is due to the different velocity of propagation and hence to the differ￾ent transit time in each section for each of the three modes. To simplify computation a single time 
step is desirable. This is achieved by defining as the time step the transit time of the fastest mode 
and using the same parameters for all three modal lines. Additional capacitance is introduced for 
the slower modes in the form of stubs to obtain the correct propagation velocity.31 The technique 
described applies to any number of conductors as is described fully in the reference given.
It remains to mention briefly the determination of the source terms [Vs] and [Is]. In simple con￾figurations where the incident field is easily defined, the source terms may be obtained analytically Propagation and Crosstalk 173
from the integral expressions in Equations 7.47 and 7.51. Often, however, a numerical technique 
must be employed. This topic is discussed further in Chapter 8. The models presented account fully 
for crosstalk and coupling from an external field.
The techniques described for dealing with multiconductor propagation may be applied to a vari￾ety of configurations such as shielded wires32 and twisted wires.33 In the latter case, because of the 
twist, adjacent segments couple to the external field through a voltage source of opposite polarity, 
thus reducing overall magnetic coupling. In wire bundles where the number of individual wires is 
large, special techniques are necessary to reduce computational complexity. A discussion of such 
problems may be found in Reference 34.
7.5 DETERMINATION OF THE EM FIELD GENERATED BY TRANSMISSION LINES
In the previous sections, techniques for calculating the current flowing on conductors due to cross￾talk and coupling to external fields were described. From the EMC point of view, it is often nec￾essary to calculate the strength of the electromagnetic fields generated by these currents so that 
emissions may be quantified and compared with permitted levels described in EMC standards. 
These emissions are commonly referred to as “radiated.” It is important to emphasize that this term 
is best interpreted as meaning air-borne emissions, their precise character being capacitive/induc￾tive, near or far field, depending on the distance between the observation point and the radiating 
object. Details of the “radiated” fields may be found in Chapter 2. Another aspect of emission from 
transmission lines of all kinds, such as cables and printed circuit boards, is the nature of the cur￾rents flowing on these lines. In the previous sections the possibility of decomposing line currents 
to modal components was described. The simplest case of a two-wire line is shown in Figure 7.17. 
The impedances shown represent schematically the coupling of the line to adjacent objects and are 
normally capacitive in nature. Other influences may also be present that are not shown explicitly 
in Figure 7.17. Line currents IA and IB are not necessarily equal in magnitude and in antiphase. 
However, they can be decomposed as follows:

Component Id=(Ia – IB)/2 is the normal differential current and the only one present if coupling 
to other structures is negligible. It is the current component intended to flow in this circuit to meet

operational requirements. In contrast, component Ic=(Ia+IB)/2 described as the common mode cur￾rent returns through coupling paths and adjacent structures and it is not essential to circuit opera￾tion. More specifically, it does not flow through the load. The situation is in general quite complex, 
especially at high frequencies, but the origin and significance of these currents does not change. It 
is unlikely that the circuit designer would have paid significant attention to common-mode currents 
and these are, therefore, normally unknown. Standard transmission-line analysis, which neglects 
coupling to other structures, accounts only for the differential currents. Only a comprehensive 
model that includes all coupling paths is capable of accurately predicting common mode currents. 
Even in cases where Ic≪Id and therefore impact on normal operation is minimal, the common￾mode current may make a major contribution to emissions.35 The reason for this is that the contribu￾tions to emission due to Id from segments A′A and B′B tend to cancel each other, especially at large 
distances from the line. In contrast, contributions from Ic assist each other.
At the low-frequency limit and in the far field it is possible to obtain approximate formulae for 
the electric field due to two parallel tracks
carrying differential and common mode current at distance d and on the same plane as the tracks 
as shown in Figure 7.18.6
FIGURE 7.17 Configuration used to study differential- and common-mode currents.
FIGURE 7.18 Calculation of the maximum radiated electric field due to DM and CM currents.Propagation and Crosstalk 175
Example: Emission from current loops — In a PCB design the clock frequency is 20 MHz and it 
is estimated that the currents flowing in a loop (area 15 cm2) at the 3rd, 18th, and 37th harmonic 
are 70, 45, and 20 dBpA respectively. The loop is above a ground plane. Make an estimate of the 
maximum field at each frequency and compare with CISPR 22 Class B limits. (These are given in 
Chapter 13.)
Solution: We use the formula for DM emissions in Figure 7.18 and multiply it by 2 since the image 
of the tracks on the ground plane may interfere constructively (worst case). This limit is set at 10 m:

where we have indicated the appropriate limit on the RHS. We see that the electric field exceeds 
the limit value at the 3rd and 18th harmonics and therefore the products fails.
More accurate calculations can be made provided the DM and CM current distribution is 
known along the line.
The generated EM field can then be calculated at any distance from the line using antenna the￾ory. The most common approach is to separate each line segment into small enough sections of 
length l and treat the radiation from each section as that due to a short electric dipole as described 
in Section 2.3.2. This is acceptable provided that l is much smaller than the wavelength. Useful 
formulae for such calculations may be found in Reference 36. Several approximations commonly 
made in such calculations introduce errors that may be unacceptable. For example, describing 
radiation from segment A′A as the superposition of contributions from a number of sections of 
length l leaves uncompensated charges at A′ and A, and thus introduces errors in the electrostatic 
term. These are pronounced at low frequencies and near the line. These errors may be avoided by 
taking account of segments A′ A and AB, but this requires high resolution to account properly for 
phase differences. The so-called near-field equations account for line spacing only in the phase 
term and not in the amplitude. This approximation introduces errors when calculating fields near 
the line. These difficulties and ways to overcome them are discussed more fully in Reference 37.
It is emphasized here that in EMC work identifying the modes of electromagnetic emission 
from circuits needs particular attention and they are not always the most obvious ones. We give 
below some simple examples of the type of work needed to predict emissions and hopefully iden￾tify remedies.38 The basic configuration is shown in Figure 7.19a consisting of an interconnect (two 
parallel tracks) supplied by a source and terminated by a load with two long cable attachments 
connected to the ground trace as shown. These typically could be the braids of coaxial cables 
connected to this circuit. The question asked is “How does this section radiate?” There are three 
possible mechanism and we will examine one at a time.
First, there is an obvious emission mechanism due to the flow of the DM current in the loop 
shown. As this current is the normal current flow responsible for the functionality of the circuit 176 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
it is normally well understood and it is unlikely that the designer will be unaware of its impact. 
If appropriate, the two tracks could be brought closer together to reduce loop area and hence 
reduce emissions. However, there are two other, less obvious ways that this circuit may emit.
The second mechanism involves the sections shown highlighted in Figure 7.19b. During the 
operation of this circuit fast signal transitions generate current with a very high rate of change (di/
dt) and hence along the ground trace a voltage is generated equal to
V = L dI
dt s gnd
DM (7.80)
where Lgnd is the partial inductance of the ground trace. This voltage acts like a source driving 
a dipole antenna with the two arms the two cable attachments. This mode of emission may be 
described as an antenna mode driven by the ground noise source in Equation 7.80. We see, 
therefore, that significant voltages may be generated along the ground trace that drive antenna-like 
structures in the circuit. These unintentional antennas emit in just the same manner as intentional 
antennas. If we wish to reduce these emissions we need to reduce the rate of change of current 
(slower transitions) and/or reduce the ground trace partial inductance. This means wide ground 
tracks widths and preferably a large ground plane.
The third mechanism of emissions has something to do with the symmetry of the circuit. 
The configuration is shown in Figure 7.19c where the source is not feeding the circuit sym￾metrically. Following Reference 39 we may obtain an equivalent to this configuration shown 
in Figure 7.19d. The first set of sources clearly drives an antenna mode (a monopole driven 
by a common-mode current) while the second set drives differential current similar to that 
described by the first mechanism described above. The CM and DM current for this case can 
be obtained from the configurations in Figure 7.19e where Za is the input impedance of a thin 
wire antenna of length ℓ. It can be calculated numerically or in simple cases obtained analyti￾cally from antenna theory.
These examples are meant to illustrate the complexity of the issues involved when EMC is con￾sidered. Normal circuit operation is concerned with the first mechanism only (differential mode 
currents). All the other complications are EMC specific and must be considered as they may be dom￾inant as far as emissions are concerned, especially at very high frequencies and in fast digital circuits.

7.6 NUMERICAL SIMULATION METHODS FOR PROPAGATION STUDIES
The basic electromagnetic interactions present in multiconductor propagation problems, including 
crosstalk and coupling to the environment, were described in the previous sections. It is clear that 
the complexity of such calculations in practical systems is great and, therefore, inevitably, numerical 
simulation packages are used to assist the designer in making EMC assessments. The purpose of 
this section is not to present a comprehensive picture of available commercial packages in this area; 
this task, in a rapidly changing market, would be impossible. Instead, the basic generic methods 
and some examples of packages and capabilities will be presented to familiarize the designer with 
currently available computational tools.
The most common propagation and crosstalk codes are based on a frequency-domain formula￾tion of the transmission line equations. Software based on this technique is described in Reference 
25. For electrically short lines, very simple models may be implemented using T or Π equivalents 
and solved using standard packages such as SPICE.
Time-domain solutions are described in Reference 3. Computation is facilitated if a decomposi￾tion into modes is made. An example of available software based on this technique may be found 
in Reference 40. An alternative formulation based on SPICE is described in Reference 41. Models 
based on the transmission-line modeling (TLM) method are described in References 30, 31, and 
42. An example of the application of the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method to cross￾talk problems is described in Reference 43. Another code, which is widely used for calculating 
transients in power systems, is the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP).44 This program 
may be adapted to study general propagation problems. Time-domain formulations are ideal for 
studying transients and nonlinear circuits but not so flexible in allowing the modeling of frequency￾dependent components. An approach commonly used to overcome this difficulty is to devise a com￾bination of lumped components that has the desired frequency response and to solve the resulting 
network in the time domain.45 Examples of codes suitable for propagation and emission studies are 
described in Reference 46 based on the finite-element method (FE), and in Reference 47 based on 
the method of moments (MM). A literature review of EMC effects in printed circuit boards may be 
found in Reference 48.

8 Simulation of the 
Electromagnetic Coupling 
between Systems
8.1 OVERVIEW
In previous chapters, various aspects of electromagnetic coupling relevant to EMC have been con￾sidered. The physical basis of the interactions involved was outlined and analytical or numerical 
models suitable for describing them were introduced. It is inevitable that in a complex system sev￾eral of these mechanisms are present simultaneously and that many of the configurations of interest 
are rarely subject to simple treatment. In many cases it is not possible to isolate and treat different 
aspects of the problem separately, e.g., penetration and propagation. The resulting complexity can 
only be handled by using sophisticated numerical computer-based techniques. The purpose of this 
chapter is to present an introduction to the main simulation methods and the manner in which they 
can best be employed to solve complex EMC problems. A useful framework for classifying and 
tackling EMC problems is as follows.1,2
External/source region — In susceptibility problems, the source region may be other equip￾ment, radio transmitters, etc. Certain severe forms of EM threat such as EMP and lightning 
may need special characterization, especially if the victim of the interference is very near 
the source. In emission problems, the external environment is not normally specified in 
detail, except in various EMC standards, e.g., emitting equipment in an open site with 
measurements taken a distance of 10m away.
Penetration and coupling — Emphasis was placed in previous chapters on assessing pen￾etration through apertures and non-perfectly conducting walls. In practice all kinds of con￾ducting penetrations from signal leads to water pipes breach the relative isolation between 
regions internal and external to a barrier shield.
Propagation and crosstalk — The penetrating EM radiation couples onto various compo￾nents and networks and propagates to interfere with other systems through crosstalk.
Device susceptibility and emission — In cases of susceptibility, a portion of the coupled 
EM energy becomes incident on individual components or subsystems causing damage or 
malfunction. Conversely, EM emissions from such subsystems may become the source of 
EMI added to the external environment.
In many practical problems it is not easy to identify clearly and treat separately these various aspects 
of EMC. It is helpful, however, to be able to identify important factors and solution methods suitable 
for tackling all these aspects of the problem so that accurate models may be developed and suitable 
numerical simulation methods may be selected.
8.2 SOURCE/EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
In most cases, the external environment for emission studies is either taken to be free space or, 
alternatively, to conform to recommended test environments. Of the latter, the open-site environ￾ment rarely presents problems for simulation. However, emission assessment by simulation inside 
screened rooms presents several difficulties. In unlined screened rooms it is acceptable to assume 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-10182 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
perfectly conducting walls and then construct models that predict the interaction of the device￾under-test (DUT) with the screened room and associated instrumentation. Rooms lined with radia￾tion absorbing material (RAM) may, depending on frequency and the quantity of RAM, be regarded 
as partially or fully anechoic. The latter condition is difficult to achieve, especially at low frequen￾cies. For accurate prediction, sophisticated models of the entire environment, including the RAM, 
are necessary. Examples of such simulations may be found in References 3 to 5.
In susceptibility studies, the greatest difficulty occurs when simulating coupling to systems 
placed in the source region of EMP and lightning. In both cases the assumption of an incident plane 
wave is not valid as the entire interaction takes place under near-field conditions. In addition, severe 
nonlinearities are present. In the source region of EMP, the time-dependent ionization of air and the 
presence of rapidly varying intense fields requires a self-consistent simulation of all aspects of the 
problem. Such simulations have been done but they are important for certain military systems only 
and unlikely to be of interest to ordinary commercial EMC. General guidance as to likely levels of 
the EM threat may be found in Chapter 5.
Lightning affects a large number of systems and it is of particular interest to mobile systems such 
as aircraft and missiles. The presence of a craft in the path of a lightning channel can be studied 
by simulation to predict current levels and resonances. In these studies, the lightning channel may 
be modeled in various degrees of detail. A fully three-dimensional self-consistent solution pres￾ents formidable difficulties. These are caused by the very different physical scales of the problem 
(~ km for the separation of electric charge centers,~m for aircraft, and~mm for the highly ionized 
lightning channel), and the complexity and inadequate understanding of ionization in a lightning 
channel. Numerical models of the channel have been described by several authors.6–8 Studies of 
lightning-aircraft interactions have been reported using a stick model of an aircraft and the method 
of moments (MM),9 the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method,10 and the transmission￾line modeling (TLM) method.11 The last two methods can deal with a variety of situations but at a 
considerable computational effort. A decision to investigate source-region coupling effects in detail 
should not be taken lightly as it invariably involves work at the limits of computational and model￾ing capabilities.
8.3 PENETRATION AND COUPLING
Penetration and coupling through shields and apertures were studied in Chapter 6. Radiated inter￾ference coupling by diffusion through thin walls and directly through electrically small and large 
apertures has been studied in some detail. Simulation packages suitable for diffusion studies are 
normally based on frequency-domain formulations using the finite-element (FE) method. Time￾domain formulations are less popular since, in general, diffusion times are long and excessive com￾puter run times are required. In most practical situations, penetration through apertures dominates. 
The most general simulation codes suitable for any size apertures, modeling simultaneously regions 
internal and external to shields, are based on differential time-domain formulations such as FD-TD 
and TLM.12,13 Alternative formulations based on the MM are possible but must be applied with care 
to avoid solution artifacts due to “numerical” coupling between inner and outer regions.
Conducted interference makes a major contribution to the overall interference budget and has 
hitherto not been considered in detail. The term “conducted interference” refers to EM energy 
guided by conductors such as signal cables and their shields, pipes used to bring various services 
inside enclosures (e.g., water, compressed air), and other structural parts. The easiest penetration 
to deal with is that due to a shielded wire, shown schematically in Figure 8.1a. Coupling from 
an external source onto exposed parts may be represented by an appropriate Thevenin equivalent 
circuit, as shown in Figure 8.1b, or, alternatively, in more complex situations, by a complete field 
coupling model such as that shown in Figure 7.13. Assuming that the wire shield is joined solidly by 
a 360° connection to the barrier shield, separating inner and outer regions results in the equivalent 
circuit shown in Figure 8.1b, which can be used to determine the penetrating signal. Conversely, Simulation of EM Coupling between Systems 183
if emission from the inner region is considered, quantities Va and Za represent the Thevenin equiva￾lent of the radiating parts considered as sections of antennas. These quantities may be obtained 
efficiently from antenna codes based on MM techniques.14,15 An unshielded conducting penetration 
may be brought through the shield via feed-through capacitor, via an electrical filter, or may be 
directly connected to it. Coupling of the conducting penetration with EM fields in the inner and 
outer regions may be represented as in Figures 8.1b and 7.13. Of particular interest is to ascertain the 
modifications to the signal traveling along the conducting penetration as it interacts with the barrier 
shield and any associated filtering components deliberately or unavoidably placed there.
Let us consider first the case of a conductor going through the barrier shield without a DC con￾nection to it. The capacitance Cb between the conductor and the barrier represents either stray 
capacitance or a feed-through capacitor specifically inserted for the purpose. Assuming that an 
assessment of EM penetration needs to be made and that coupling from the external environment 
may be presented as in Figure 8.1b gives the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 8.2, where R is the 
input impedance seen by the conductor in the inner region. In obtaining this circuit, it has been 
implicitly assumed that a simple lumped component representation of the feed-through and the 
inner circuit is possible (low-frequency approximation). The presence of capacitor Cb affords a cer￾tain amount of shielding from the interfering signal Vs as the ratio of the voltage seen across R when 
Cb is absent and when it is present, is equal to

FIGURE 8.2 Circuit used to study the penetration of a conductor through a shield without a DC con￾nection to it.184 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
From this expression it is clear that Cb is effective in introducing some attenuation in high-imped￾ance circuits.
At very high frequencies transmission-line effects begin to dominate the behavior of feed-through 
capacitors. A typical cylindrical arrangement is shown in Figure 8.3.16 The cylindrical feed-through 
capacitor is in fact an open-circuit transmission line of length 1. A useful measure of effectiveness is 
the ratio between the voltage V2 induced at the capacitor end inside the barrier shield, and the noise 
current I1. This ratio can be referred to as the transfer impedance Z . c

where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the coaxial line (cylindrical capacitor) and λ is the wave￾length. At low frequencies (λ >> 1), Equation 8.2 may be simplified by recognizing that sin (2πl/λ) 
≃ 2π1/λ to give This confirms that at the low-frequency limit a lumped representation of the feed￾through capacitor is acceptable. However, as the wavelength becomes comparable to the length of 
the line, the behavior of the feed-through component becomes very complex. As an example, when 
l/λ=0.5, Equation 8.2 gives Zc → ∞.

It may be imagined that a DC connection to the barrier shield will completely prevent interfering cur￾rent from inducing voltages inside the shielded region. Such an arrangement is shown schematically in 
Figure 8.4a and it is suitable for non-signal-carrying conducting penetrations. Assuming that the con￾tact resistance between the barrier shield and the conductor is Rc, the induced voltage is V = IRc. This 
may be further reduced by the double contact arrangement shown in Figure 8.4b. Using the approach 
described in Reference 16, the equivalent circuit for this arrangement may be obtained where L is the 
inductance of the coaxial line (inner and outer radii r1 r2, and length 1) between the double contacts. 
Assuming that ωL >> Rc1, Rc2 gives V I 1 c ~  R   1 2 and V V = + R / c1 1 c ( ) R j 2 c ω ω L R  I 1 c R / 2 j L
FIGURE 8.3 Penetration via a feed-through capacitor.Simulation of EM Coupling between Systems 185
For contact resistances a fraction of a milliohm and L of the order of a nanohenry, the voltage 
V2 becomes, at high frequencies, a small fraction of V1, thus improving shielding. Similar benefits 
are obtained by using a double contact arrangement to effect a temporary joint between two panels, 
as shown in Figure 8.4c. In some cases specially designed filters are installed between the barrier 
shield and the conducting penetration. In these circumstances, a complete analysis can be made, 
taking into account all factors, to determine the amount of interference.
Simple calculations, such as those presented here, can be made to establish the value of each 
component and the severity of penetration. Alternatively, numerical simulation may be used to 
obtain a better measure of each type of penetration. Examples of such calculations for antenna pen￾etrations and the effects of “pigtail” connections may be found in References 17 to 19.
Every attempt is made to characterize penetrations in terms of equivalent circuits and induced 
voltages. These are then used as source terms in propagation studies aiming at establishing the 
spreading of interference away from the point of entry by conduction and radiation. Although 
description of such penetrations as an integral part in a three-dimensional problem is possible, the 
small size and complexity of these features make simulations quite difficult.
A generic case of penetration and coupling is shown in Figure 8.5. This illustrates several of the 
problems arising in the electromagnetic characterization of cabinets and shows intermediate level 
FIGURE 8.4 Various gasketing arrangements (a) and (c) and an equivalent circuit (b).
FIGURE 8.5 Schematic showing the coupling between two wires inside a cabinet.186 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
models (models not based on a full-field description) that may be employed to characterize quanti￾tatively the level of coupling. Let us first begin with a qualitative description of the coupling mecha￾nisms relevant to the configuration shown in Figure 8.5. The cabinet has a wire penetration AGB, 
typically part of a communications or power connection. The segment AG is external to the cabinet 
and therefore subject to interference from external incident fields. Thus the induced current pen￾etrates into the segment GB internal to the cabinet after negotiating the barrier at G. Segment GB acts 
now as an antenna exciting EM fields inside the cabinet, which distribute according to the demands 
of the resonant structure that the cabinet is. Energy is thus coupled to the wire segment C, which 
appears at the receiver as interference. The EMC engineer wishes to establish a quantitative relation￾ship between the incident field and the interference voltage measured at the receiver. This is a typical 
EMC problem and as already indicated requires an understanding of several stages in a complex 
interaction. Naturally, this problem could be tackled by constructing a full- field numerical model of 
the entire configuration to establish the required transfer function between the external field and the 
receiver voltage. This, however, leads to a large computation and we will therefore focus instead on 
constructing an intermediate level model where we simplify interactions as far as possible.20
At the input side we recognize that we have, effectively, two monopole antennas, AG and BG. 
Each may be represented by an equivalent circuit consisting of its self-impedance in series with a 
voltage source. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 8.6a where, since the incident field only 
FIGURE 8.6 Equivalent circuit of two monopoles AG, BG (a); replacing the voltage source in (a) by an 
equivalent current source (b); introducing IdipB to represent the coupling of the cavity fields to GB (c).Simulation of EM Coupling between Systems 187
couples directly to monopole GA, the voltage source in GB is set to zero. The barrier capacitance 
CBNC is also included, representing in the simplest case the connector capacitance (e.g., a BNC type 
connector). In this figure ZA and ZB represent the self-impedance of each monopole and he the effec￾tive length of monopole GA. These are frequency-dependent parameters and may be obtained from 
References 20 and 21. The current flowing in the internal monopole is then

Using the reciprocity circuit theorem, we may short out the voltage source in Figure 8.6a and insert 
a current source in branch ZB and the current flow remain unchanged. This is shown in Figure 8.6b. 
The circuit is further modified in Figure 8.6c where we have introduced an additional current source 
IdipB that represents coupling to the GB due to the cavity fields. Several such current sources may be 
added to account for the modes of the cavity.
We now turn our attention to the output circuit at C. Here the model is far simpler to visualize as 
shown in Figure 8.7 where ZC is the self-impedance of GC and the 50-Ω resistor represents the input 
impedance of the receiver. The current source IdipC represents the coupling of the cavity fields to GC.
We have dealt with the model building for the monopoles GA/GB and GC. The third and final 
element of the complete model is a representation of the coupling of the cavity fields and their cou￾pling with a dipole or monopole antenna. The cavity may in a first approximation be represented 
by a short-circuited transmission line representing a waveguide mode, where at the antenna (wire) 
position z = ‒zC a current source IWG is added to represent the current induced on the line due to the 
antenna voltage. The configuration is shown in Figure 8.8. The coupling from the line to the antenna

Figure 8.9. We need to develop this model for each waveguide mode n. We first consider the middle 
section (between antennas A1 and A2) shown in Figure 8.10a with the appropriate notation for 
mode n. The Norton equivalent circuit for this section is shown in Figure 8.10b where the two cur￾rent sources are given by the expressions

Looking from the source wire toward the left we replace the line by its input impedance, which is 
that of a short-circuited section of length

the line representing mode n is as shown in Figure 8.11. The entire coupling model for the problem 
where we have included two modes is shown in Figure 8.12. Figure 8.12a depicts the source wire

the two waveguide modes included in this computation. The notation is self-explanatory, e.g., IWGB1
is the current due to source wire GB induced on the TL representing mode n=1 (TE10) etc. More 
modes can be included if necessary. Further details of the computation and results may be found in 
Reference 20. 
8.4 PROPAGATION AND CROSSTALK
Simulations of propagation and crosstalk, possibly involving coupling to an incident field, are pos￾sible using frequency- or time-domain techniques. The general approach to solving such problems 
was described in Chapter 7. Difficulties in such studies are associated with the complexity of actual 
circuits, the presence of nonuniformities, fast signals, and generally the number of parameters to 
be described. Progress in this area hinges on seeking to describe increasingly complex systems 
in terms of simpler equivalents, which are then used in simulations. A powerful technique, which 
can be used to describe electrically small radiators, is to devise a system of three electric and 
three magnetic equivalent dipoles (one for each coordinate direction).22 An entire subsystem can 
be described in this way and the simplified description may be used in simulations. A number of 
subsystems characterized in this manner, interconnected by transmission lines and unintentional 
coupling paths, may be used to describe more complex systems.
It should be obvious from this discussion that, in general, source, penetration, and propagation 
are not always easily distinguishable or separately solvable and that in some cases whole-system 
modeling is essential. To solve such complex problems with confidence requires advancements in 
modeling techniques, computational power, and validation against careful experiments, and is an 
ongoing task for research in EMC.
A permanent difficulty in such studies is the extreme complexity of practical systems. It is there￾fore essential that a hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is available to deal at some level 
with practical problems. We sketch below the nature of these models.
Analytical models: These are accurate solutions in closed form for a number of canonical 
problems that possess some degree of symmetry. They are generally too simple as repre￾sentations of practical systems but nevertheless are very useful as benchmark solutions for 
model evaluation and for illustrating trends in design in an easily accessible manner that 
maximizes physical understanding.23–25
Expert systems/rule checkers: These are computer programs that in some way emulate 
human thinking.26 Unlike ordinary programs, which handle a large number of data through 
precisely defined algorithms, expert systems use rules that are based on the “good judge￾ment” of someone who is an expert in the field. They may warn users against bad practices 
and suggest remedies. It must be emphasized that the validity of these tools is limited to a 
relatively narrow design space and that caution must be exercised when using them in new 
or unfamiliar applications.
Lumped circuit models: Insofar as a network can be considered electrically small in all 
directions, standard circuit techniques and solvers such as SPICE may be employed. The 
test of electrical size must be done at the highest frequency of interest (smallest wave￾length) for EMC. Parameters L, C, etc. may be obtained analytically or through numerical 
simulations.
Distributed parameter models: These are appropriate to describe interconnects when the 
TEM approximation holds as explained elsewhere in this book.
Intermediate models: These are a compromise between semi-empirical ideas and full-field 
solutions and borrow, as necessary, concepts from lumped distributed and full-field mod￾els. The basic idea is to reduce model complexity but keep accuracy under control. Such 
models are mentioned throughout this book.192 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Full-field models: These invariably are solutions to Maxwell’s equations and are sophis￾ticated tools requiring years of development. They are accurate within the limitations 
of numerical accuracy. Providing full input data for these models can be a problem and 
they also make heavy use of computational resources. Many practical problems cannot 
be solved using such models because of the huge computational cost. Thus techniques are 
developed to embed more efficient numerical structures in the form of macronodes that 
describe particularly complex or fine features. This speeds up computational accuracy 
significantly. A review of such multiscale models may be found in Reference 27.
Hybrid models: Human ingenuity enables innovative approaches to problem solving. A par￾ticular example is the combination of different models in the same problem to maximize 
model advantages and minimize their disadvantages. Such hybrid models can be very 
powerful but care must be taken to ensure that they remain versatile and easy to use. 
Examples are combinations of techniques such as FDTD and GTD or TLM with Integral 
Equation methods. The development of such tools is for the specialist but users for EMC 
applications should be aware of their existence and also of the prospect of more such tools 
becoming available as they mature beyond the research stage.
8.5 DEVICE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND EMISSION
The complexity and detail found in modern electronic equipment is such that in any attempt to pre￾dict behavior by simulation, boundaries must be set to limit the extent of computation to a manage￾able level. For example, if emissions originating from a clock circuit are considered, the clock chip 
is characterized by a simple Thevenin equivalent circuit and, normally, no account is taken of the 
internal circuit structure. Similarly, in a susceptibility study the clock chip is normally replaced by a 
suitable input impedance. A more detailed description of the chip is possible by using macromodels 
such as those available in SPICE. Progress is being made in interfacing general three-dimensional 
field solvers with lumped circuit models of actual devices in order to give an integrated self-con￾sistent model. The complexity of such calculations should not be underestimated. It should also be 
borne in mind that actual accurate models of devices are not always available and that the variabil￾ity between nominally similar components from the same or different manufacturers can be very 
significant. This topic is addressed in more detail in the next chapter. The presence of interference 
at the input to a device, in the form of fast pulses of magnitude outside the normal range, requires 
detailed knowledge of the input circuit of the device including stray components and nonlinearities. 
Only then can accurate numerical models be constructed. Such information is rarely available in 
sufficient detail in device specifications.
8.6 NUMERICAL SIMULATION METHODS
There are many techniques suitable for solving electromagnetic and circuit problems. It is not the 
purpose of this section to give a comprehensive survey of all available methods. There are tech￾niques that, by exploiting symmetry or some other simplifying feature of the problem, can produce 
accurate solutions very rapidly for specific classes of problems. A survey of numerical methods may 
be found in References 28 and 29. Attention is focused here only on methods that are general and 
versatile enough to provide solutions to the wide range of problems encountered in EMC studies.
A classification of numerical methods and a discussion of their special features may be found in 
Reference 30. Broadly speaking, methods are classified as time or frequency domain, depending on 
the type of formulation employed. Fast transients, nonlinearities, and time-dependent parameters are 
generally best treated in the time domain. However, problems where the steady-state response at a 
few frequencies is desired, or when frequency-dependent components are present, are best dealt with 
in the frequency domain. Whichever domain is adopted, results in the other domain may be found 
by recognizing that the impulse and frequency responses of a system are Fourier transform pairs.Simulation of EM Coupling between Systems 193
An alternative classification scheme is into differential and integral methods. In the former case 
the physical laws are enforced on a number of points occupying the entire volume of the problem 
space, whereas in the latter, enforcement of laws is limited to points on certain surfaces of the 
problem.
Differential methods are better suited to solving inhomogeneous nonlinear problems but suffer 
from difficulties when modeling open-boundary problems. In contrast, integral methods cope well 
with open-boundary problems but they are not ideally suited to solving inhomogeneous problems. 
There are some methods suitable for dealing with very high frequency problems that do not fit 
any of these categories. They are generally referred to as ray methods.31 Ray methods are suitable 
for tackling problems where the wavelength is much smaller than the physical size of the objects 
under consideration. Differential and integral methods require a space discretization that typically 
is smaller than a tenth of a wavelength. As a result, the size of the problem that can be treated with 
modest computational resources cannot exceed a few wavelengths in each coordinate direction.
Before embarking on a brief description of each method, it is worth identifying what the main 
requirements are for simulation codes suitable for EMC studies.
1. Geometrical features — the code should be capable of modeling a variety of objects and 
shapes, including semi-enclosed regions commonly found in EMC problems
2. Material properties — EMC problems are characterized by a wide range of materials and 
the code must be capable of dealing with nonuniform, nonlinear materials
3. Physical scale — it is not unusual in EMC to have a problem that is infinite in extent and 
where fine features (e.g., thin wires or narrow slots) must also be modeled; the code must 
have adequate facilities to deal with fine features and open boundaries
4. Time scale — interest in EMC is over a wide range of time signals or, equivalently, a wide 
range of frequencies; adequate and efficient coverage over a broad band of frequencies is 
an essential requirement from any code used in EMC
The main field solvers suitable for whole-system modeling are based on one or more of the tech￾niques described in the next four subsections.
8.6.1  The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FD-TD) Method
This method is a differential, time-domain method based on a time and space discretization of 
Maxwell’s equations. Derivatives are evaluated using central differences on a spatial grid referred 
to as the Yee-mesh.32 Formulations are available to deal with fine features, thin wires, and with 
open-boundary problems through specially developed radiation-absorbing conditions. The method 
is a powerful and versatile tool and has been used successfully to study a range of problems in EM. 
A more detailed description of the method may be found in References 33 to 35. FD-TD provides 
a complete simulation of the build-up of the EMC field from the start of the excitation to the time 
when steady-state conditions have been reached. Typically, the excitation is a Gaussian pulse. The 
response to any other input may then be obtained by convolution.
8.6.2  The Transmission-Line Modeling (TLM) Method
This is a differential time-domain method similar in many respects to the FD-TD method. The 
main difference is that field solutions are obtained through equivalence to voltages and currents 
flowing in a network of transmission lines, clustered into nodes, occupying the problem space. 
The basic node, which permits the determination of all field components at each point in space, is 
the symmetrical condensed node described in Reference 36. Further details of the method may be 
found in References 37 to 39. The method is implemented in a similar way as the FD-TD method. 
Adaptations to deal with fine features, thin wires, and panels are described in the references given.194 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
8.6.3  The Method of Moments (MM)
The method is normally implemented in the frequency domain and consists of the imposition of 
suitable conditions on the boundary surfaces of the problem. For example, in a scattering problem 
the appropriate condition is that on the surface of a perfect conductor the incident and reflected tan￾gential components of the electric field must sum to zero. This type of formulation is referred to as 
the electric field integral equation (EFIE), and it is suitable for modeling thin wires. An alternative 
formulation based on the magnetic field (MFIE) is more suitable for smooth large bodies. In imple￾menting the method, the unknown function on each surface element is expressed as a combination 
of known basis functions. The unknown coefficients of this expansion are obtained by solving a 
system of equations expressing an optimality criterion (e.g., minimum error). A collection of papers 
describing the method and its applications may be found in Reference 40. Method of moment tech￾niques are particularly suitable for modeling wire structures and open-boundary problems.
8.6.4  The Finite-Element (FE) Method
Normally, the FE method is formulated in the frequency domain. The problem space is divided into 
elements (e.g., triangles in two dimensions) on which the potential is defined as a combination of the 
potentials at the vertices. A suitable functional is found and the unknown potentials at the vertices 
are calculated by minimizing this functional. For example, in an electrostatic problem a suitable 
functional is the electrostatic energy. The difficulties in terminating open-boundary problems accu￾rately introduce spurious components in the response. In a development of the method, known as 
the boundary element method (BEM), the number of unknowns is reduced by restricting the defini￾tion of elements on suitable boundaries in the problem. The resulting equations, although fewer in 
number, are more difficult to solve. Details of the FE method and its applications may be found in 
References 41 and 42. The FE method is very well developed as a tool for predicting eddy current 
distributions at low frequencies. One of its advantages is its flexibility in defining boundaries by 
using differently shaped elements.
The techniques described above are continuously developed to extend their capabilities and min￾imize their disadvantages. For example, time-domain techniques may be reformulated and applied 
in the frequency-domain. The information given above refers to the most common implementation.
No method excels in every conceivable application. It appears inevitable that, in a sophisticated 
design environment, a number of codes should be available to deal with the variety of problems 
likely to be encountered. All codes, however friendly, are based on assumptions and simplifications 
that may be unwarranted in certain applications. It is important that the user is familiar with such 
limitations. The complexity of these codes is a demotivating factor for those who wish to understand 
more deeply the nature and significance of implicit or explicit code limitations. It appears to be 
good advice to suggest that it is better to use a number of simpler tools with which one is familiar, 
rather than a complex tool poorly understood. Using two methods in a single solver to enhance the 
advantages and minimize the disadvantages, i.e., to hybridize two methods, appears attractive and 
such codes are continuously being developed.43 An example of a general code using MM to model 
features smaller than a wavelength, the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) to model structures 
larger than a wavelength and finite-differences for internal (cavity) problems, is known as the gen￾eral EM model for the analysis of complex systems (GEMACS).44
Under practical circumstances, it is difficult to assess all important interactions to the level of 
accuracy and detail implied by these analysis methods. Although increasingly more sophisticated 
and comprehensive simulations are possible, it is nevertheless useful to be able to determine EMC 
compliance without resort to full-scale EM simulation. Such a capability is useful when the com￾plexity of a full-field simulation is prohibitive, or when the system is not yet sufficiently well defined 
to embark on such a calculation. An EMC budget can be established for the entire system by iden￾tifying the main emitters and receptors of EM radiation, and the coupling paths between them. Simulation of EM Coupling between Systems 195
Examples of such paths are antenna to antenna, wire to wire, field or antenna to wire, or enclosure to 
enclosure. The frequency response may then be established for each coupling path individually, and 
eventually the total interference signal may be calculated. Design modifications may then be neces￾sary so that interference levels are brought within desired limits. Such calculations are inevitably 
based on several simplifications and they must not be regarded as very accurate. They are neverthe￾less useful in identifying problem areas and in directing the major effort on these specific problems. 
An example of such system-level EMC code is IEMCAP (Intrasystem EMC Analysis Program).45
Further details on the application of numerical simulation methods to EMC problems may be 
found in References 46 to 48.
8.7 EMC MODELING OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS
We have described a range of numerical methods capable of analyzing systems of interest to EMC, 
and we have pointed out their inherent limitations. They can be applied individually or in combina￾tions to study increasingly more complex systems. However, even with the availability of massive 
computing power practical systems are of such complexity to challenge even the most powerful 
simulation setup. It is essential that we have some capability of addressing complexity prior to 
modeling. To illustrate the problem, we mention the case of an aircraft, which is an electrically 
large object (many wavelengths in size) with wire bundles of great complexity and length, placed at 
various heights off the skin of the aircraft. It is hard to anticipate how any of the numerical meth￾ods we have described so far may be efficiently applied to such a problem. This is an example of 
a multiscale problem and is very challenging to the modeler.27,49 A process of de-featuring, based 
on physical intuition, may be employed to remove from the simulation model features that do not 
substantially influence the response, but such interventions require a deep understanding of the 
problem and are inherently unsafe. The question therefore arises whether a systematic way exists 
to simplify the problem prior to modeling so that our modeling methods may be applied efficiently 
and with accurate results.
There are basically two approaches. First, we can formulate the problem in a mathematical form, 
examine the strength of various couplings, and then remove the weakest coupling mechanisms from 
further computations. These are generally known as model order reduction (MoR)50 and can help 
in some circumstances. A second more practical approach is to characterize in some way complex 
features embedded in a problem using information about their local behavior and interface this 
information to the numerical model of the space surrounding it. Thus, we may introduce special 
cells containing a wire bundle, which interact with the rest of space through the cell boundaries 
— no explicit meshing of the wire bundle is required. Such cells are described as macromodels or 
sub-cells and, as part of a large numerical model, can greatly enhance the efficiency of computation. 
We give some details of this approach to indicate what can be done to enhance EMC modeling of 
complex systems.
We start with the case of a single embedded wire. This is a classic case of a multiscale problem 
whereby in two dimensions (wire cross section) the feature is electrically small and in the third 
dimension (along the wire length) electrically large. Typically, in meshing for a numerical model we 
choose a space discretization length of one-tenth of the shortest wavelength of interest. If we choose 
1GHz as the highest frequency of interest, then in air, the wavelength is 30cm and hence we dis￾cretize space typically on a 3-cm grid. A direct geometrical mapping of features smaller than 3cm 
onto this grid is not possible. In fact, for acceptable accuracy, typically four grid points are required 
for an adequate feature description. The obvious solution is to reduce the discretization length to 
a very small value to accommodate the diameter of the wire (typically mm). However, halving the 
discretization length increases the size of the computation in 3D by a factor of 23 = 8. Attempting 
therefore to refine the grid to accommodate fine features, such as thin wires, would increase the 
size of the computation by many orders of magnitude and, also, elevate problem mapping onto the 
grid into a major pre-processing task. This option is rarely possible in complex practical problems 196 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
irrespective of the numerical method employed. There are many practical EMC problems for which 
their complexity and multiscale nature require creative solutions which go beyond a direct geo￾metrical mapping of features onto the grid. Some of the options are mesh distortion, embedding 
macronodes containing the fine features and modeling method hybridization.
Some specific models employed to deal with fine features are described in other parts of this 
text. We focus in this section on general methodological issues connected with the application of 
numerical methods to EMC modeling.
Mesh distortion is sought so that in parts of space where there are fine features with intricate 
geometrical or material details, we have a larger concentration of grid points and a relatively coarse 
mesh elsewhere. Thus, we may have a multi-grid mesh with fine and coarse cubical cells as shown 
in Figure 8.13a. From the modeling point of view, the challenge is to deal correctly with interface 
conditions between coarse and fine areas and thus minimize the generation of numerical artifacts.
Such a grid is described as structured in that the density of grid points does not vary continu￾ously. A further development of this ideal is the hybrid mesh consisting of cuboid cells shown in 
Figure 8.13b.39 We can also get free from the constraints of the cuboid cell and employ cells that are 
irregular tetrahedra as shown schematically in Figure 8.13c. This is an example of an unstructured 
mesh where the density of grid points can be continuously varied to attain the desired spatial resolu￾tion in every problem locality. The difficulty with type of mesh is that the shape of each cell affects 
mesh quality and under certain circumstances may lead to numerical instabilities — for stability, 
it must be a Delaunay mesh.51 Thus, mesh generation becomes an important issue in unstructured 
meshes as discussed in References 49, 52, and 53.
By far, the most effective approach to the treatment of fine features has been the introduction of 
macromodels or sub-cells. The idea behind this approach is to employ, as far as possible, a uniform 
structured mesh throughout the problem and account for fine features contained inside some of these 
cells (sub-cells) by modifying the way sub-cells interact with their neighboring cells. We illustrate 
this approach with reference to the TLM method. We consider a simple example of a cell containing 
a conducting structure — all neighboring cells represent free space. A time-domain simulation of 
such a structure involves a succession of scattering events as signals emerging from the boundary of 
each cell imping on their neighbors and are scattered depending on the impedance they encounter. 
Clearly, the impedance seen will be different depending on whether the neighboring cell represents 
free space, or a fine conducting object surrounded by free space. We can therefore proceed with 
the scattering and the overall computation without any need to refine the mesh, provided we can 
compute this impedance. This is the principle of all embedding techniques and when successfully 
applied reduces the complexity and size of the computation by many orders of magnitude. A help in

determining this impedance is offered by the fact very near the embedded object and on the cell sur￾face (d<<λ/10), the fields are characteristic of the object and can be calculated analytically or numer￾ically without reference to conditions pertaining elsewhere in the problem. These so-called ‘local 
solutions’ allow us to calculate the input impedance and implement scattering as discussed above. The 
first successful attempt to do this was a sub-cell to describe an embedded this wire.54 In this approach, 
the local solution employed to construct a suitable interface between the wire and the fields is based 
on the quasi-static solution for fields around a wire as discussed extensively in References 55–58. In 
general, around objects such as wires, we have in addition to the quasi-static mode, other modal solu￾tions and an interface can be constructed, in principle, to take account of more than one modal (local) 
solution.59,60 In outline, the modes of a cell containing an object such as a wire are obtained first as a 
pre-processing task. We obtain thus what in mathematics are referred to as the eigenvalues and eigen￾vectors of the sub-cell structure. The set of incoming signals [V] is then transformed into their modal 
components [X] using the transformation matrix [T], which has as its columns the eigenvectors of 
the sub-cell structure. The number of modes that can be included in the computation depends on the 
number of degrees of freedom. As an example, in a cell with six facets and two polarizations per facet 
we have 12 degrees of freedom, and hence, we can account for 12 modes (local solutions). The process 
of scattering from a sub-cell is shown schematically in Figure 8.14.
In TLM parlance, incident voltages [Vi
] are transformed into their modal components [Xi
]. Each 
modal component is then reflected from an impedance determined by the corresponding eigenvalue 
to derive the vector of the reflected modal components [Xr
]. The reflected voltage vector [Vr
] is 
then obtained using the inverse of the transformation matrix. Thus, the influence of the embedded 
structure, e.g., a wire, is accounted for without the need for mesh refinement. Naturally, the difficult 
task is the derivation of the eigensolutions. This task can be completed analytically in some cases 
such as a cylindrical wire, but in more general configurations, this option is not available. In such 
cases, the local solutions may be obtained as a pre-processing task by numerical means. Prior to 
the large-scale computation, a single cell containing the fine object is modeled using a fine mesh. 
A local solution is obtained by injecting one plane wave at a time on each facet and for each of the 
two orthogonal polarizations, thus obtaining 12 local solutions. These are then used as above in the 
larger problem to process the incoming signals and derive the reflected signals as shown schemati￾cally in Figure 8.14.61,62
We now address the issue of hybridization of different numerical methods. As we have indicated at 
the start of Section 8.6, numerical methods have certain generic features that make them particularly 
suitable for a certain class of problems. As an example, differential methods (e.g., FD-TD and TLM) 
are particularly good in handling problems with intricate geometrical and material details. Integral 
equation methods (e.g., MoM) perform well in open-boundary, largely homogeneous problems. No 
numerical method on its own is ideal for every class of problem. This is not to say that modelers can￾not employ methods outside their ideal application area. This is certainly possible, but at some cost 
in complexity, efficiency, and accuracy. The question arises therefore as to whether we can combine, 
in the same problem, models based on different generic numerical modeling methods. An example

FIGURE 8.14 Total voltages [V] transformed into modal components [X] to implement scattering from a 
macro-node.198 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
is shown in Figure 8.15, where we have marked out two regions A and B separated by free space. 
Inside the two regions A and B, we have irregular objects and various inhomogeneities, and there￾fore, a differential equation method is appropriate. In the intervening space, which extends to infinity 
(open-boundary problem), it would be inefficient (but not impossible) to employ a differential equation 
method. However, an integral equation method would be more appropriate. The difficulty comes at 
interfacing the two modeling methods at the boundaries of regions A and B. This kind of hybridization 
is possible and extends the range of problems that can be modeled efficiently in EMC applications.63
We have described the means by which standard numerical modeling methods may be modified 
and supplemented to deal with complexity inherent in EMC problems. In all these cases, we have 
attempted, as far as possible, to implement physics-based models, i.e., to model directly all physical 
interactions. This is certainly the most secure approach, but in practice, it is not always possible. 
The primary sources of EMI in electronic systems are ICs.64,65 A physics-based model of an IC is a 
daunting task. First, there are numerous components and interconnects at the microscale level and 
although topological details are known, the exact geometrical arrangements are not well defined. 
Modeling such an environment would be very challenging. Second, manufacturers of ICs are reluc￾tant, for commercial reasons, to provide details that would be required by the modeler. For both 
these reasons, alternatives are sought that abandon physical modeling for some form of behavioral 
equivalent defined either at IC pins, or at an imaginary plane just above the IC.
At pin level, we may define voltage–current lookup tables, which are made available by the man￾ufacturers and may be used to interface with wire interconnects, which spread and receive interfer￾ence through conducted and radiated mechanisms. A popular commercial standard is IBIS.66 Care 
should be taken in such calculations as EMI couplings are not fully captured in these models, but 
nevertheless, they can offer some guidance. An example of an IBIS model coupled to a full-field 
TLM model is described in Reference 67. The principles of macromodel construction are described 
in References 68 and 69.
We now address the issue of radiation emerging directly from ICs and not conducted through 
pins. As already mentioned, a direct physical modeling of the inners of an IC is unrealistic in 
the context of a large-scale simulation. We attempt therefore to replace the radiation properties of 
the IC by a set of equivalent radiating dipoles placed on a plane just above the surface of the IC. The 
situation is akin to the case of complex circuit which is replaced by its Thevenin equivalent. The set 
of equivalent dipoles replaces the IC, as far as emissions are concerned, in large-scale simulations. 
The procedure for doing this is to scan the tangential fields on a plane above the IC (near-field scan￾ning) and then devise a set of dipoles with the same radiated fields as obtained from the near-field 
scanning of the actual IC. Examples of such calculations may be found in References 70–73.
An extensive survey of numerical modeling techniques as applied to EMC and of the challenges 
faced by modelers may be found in References 74–76.

9 Effects of Electromagnetic 
Interference on Devices 
and Systems
Electromagnetic interference affects systems in various ways. Depending upon the severity of the 
EM threat and the sensitivity of the system, it may lead to an upset or even damage. The behavior of 
a system may be altered by various degrees and still be acceptable to the user. A burst of interfer￾ence may cause a momentary malfunction, with the system returning to normal operation within 
a few milliseconds. However, in safety-critical or in mission-critical systems, such as those found 
in many military or mobile applications, such a momentary malfunction may have catastrophic 
results and cannot be tolerated. Another type of upset is that causing a change in the system (such 
as overwriting parts of a computer memory), which is not immediately detrimental but can cause 
problems in the future if the problem is not detected and rectified. Finally, interference can cause an 
irreversible change to the system, such as semiconductor damage, which renders the system inca￾pable of functioning. The degree of upset and the amount of damage that can be tolerated is system 
dependent and no general advice can be given. However, it is of value to give some guidelines as to 
how devices fail so that the designer has some grasp of the issues involved.
Electromechanical components, such as motors and transformers, normally fail due to break￾down of insulation. This may be due to overvoltages applied suddenly, or more often to incipient 
faults that gradually lead to complete failure. Insulation that is regularly stressed and overheats 
eventually fails from thermal ageing (a ten-degree rise in operating temperature halves the lifetime 
of insulation). However, this type of device has a high level of immunity to overvoltages compared 
to semiconductor devices. Trends in the design of digital systems are toward smaller and faster 
devices. This leads to smaller cross-sectional areas and spacings and hence to higher current densi￾ties (several kA/mm2
) and a risk of voltage breakdown. Semiconductor devices are therefore the 
weak link as far as immunity to interference is concerned and their threshold to failure is of critical 
importance. This is a specialized and complex subject and it is not the intention to offer complete 
coverage in this chapter.1–4 Instead, a brief introduction and references to literature on this subject 
will be given, so that the designer is aware of damage thresholds, their statistical variability, and 
therefore the likely safety margin between the level of interference present at the device pins and 
its damage threshold.
Most semiconductors fail due to overheating in the junction area and interconnections. Local 
melting and resolidification establish a low-impedance path across the junction. Similar thermal 
effects are thought to be responsible whether the junction is pulsed in the forward or reverse direc￾tion.5 However, since the voltage across a forward-biased junction is lower, higher currents are 
necessary to deposit the required amount of energy at the junction. Hence, the threshold in this 
case is higher compared to the reverse-biased case. The maximum power that can be absorbed by 
a reverse-biased device without damage depends critically on the duration of the interfering pulse. 
It is commonly assumed that the relationship between the maximum power P and the duration t is 
of the form
P = K t1 k2 (9.1)
where k1 and k2 are constants.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-11204 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
It has been shown, based on some assumptions, that k2=−0.5,6 and that Equation 9.1 is an ade￾quate model provided the duration t is in the microsecond region. It is important to emphasize the 
statistical nature of Equation 9.1 and its limitations. The constants k1 and k2 are dependent on the 
particular device and the shape of the EMI pulse and vary widely. Studies have shown that even for 
the same device type and number, the variability in maximum power damage threshold can be very 
large, both between devices produced by the same manufacturer or by different manufacturers.7−9
This threshold depends critically on the details of manufacture, which vary considerably even for 
the same device type. The whole statistical variation of this parameter has led some authors to sug￾gest that thresholds should be conservatively determined from the maximum steady-state ratings 
provided by manufacturers (e.g., twice the rated junction voltage).7 Undoubtedly, more needs to be 
known about the failure modes and characteristics of semiconductor components. Additional mate￾rial on this important topic may be found in Reference 10.
The requirements for military systems exposed to intentionally generated EMI and to radiation 
effects require special measures and hardening procedures that are beyond the scope of this book. 
Useful material and references for this type of application may be found in Reference 11.
It is extremely difficult to conduct comprehensive studies of damage due to EMI on complete 
systems such as VLSI chips. The designer is normally content to determine interference signals on 
input pins to complex devices and ascertain on a semi-empirical basis the likelihood of malfunction 
or damage. Studies that involve more detailed models of SSI chips, which are then incorporated 
into general circuit solvers such as SPICE, have been reported. An example of such a study, using a 
macromodel for the popular 741 op-amp, is described in Reference 12.
9.1 IMMUNITY OF ANALOGUE CIRCUITS
There are differences in the way analogue and digital circuits respond to interference. An everyday 
example is the whistles one occasionally hears in analogue radio due to interference. This is not the 
case for digital radio. Similarly, EMI in analogue TV manifests itself by the appearance of “snow” 
on the screen. In digital TV the likely effect is a frozen screen. In analogue circuits noise coupled to 
the circuit propagates throughout modified according to circuit impedances. In contrast, in a digital 
circuit if noise at the input to the gate is rejected (within the noise margin) the output of the gate 
is free from interference. It goes without saying that proper RF design to minimize interference is 
paramount for both analogue and digital circuits. These common rules are summarized below and 
are expanded further in Part 3:
• Understand and control possible stray circuit components that affect current flows
• Understand and control common and differential mode currents and employ balancing and 
isolation as required
• Assess the impact of radiation and crosstalk especially from circuits carrying fast pulses 
or high-frequency currents
• Minimize as far as possible logic transition effects (use the slowest logic possible compat￾ible with operational requirements) and system bandwidth
• Pay particular attention to shielding and grounding so that current return paths are fully 
understood by the designer and are kept as short as possible
• Develop strategies for segregating circuits that are likely to generate interference and cir￾cuits that are sensitive to it
Although transients affect all types of circuit, they are particularly threatening to digital circuits. 
Analogue circuits normally carry low-level signals and thus are particularly prone to RF interfer￾ence. If this interference is in-band (within the normal frequency spectrum of operation), it can 
only be kept out by proper screening of the circuit and connections to it. Excessive levels of in-band 
interference may be controlled by nonlinear devices (e.g., diodes connected as clamps). Out-of-band Effects of EMI on Devices and Systems 205
interference can be similarly dealt with and in addition by filtering. The difficulty with this type of 
interference is that it invariably encounters nonlinear components and thus may be rectified (demod￾ulation) and appear as a DC offset. Typically, the envelope of the high-frequency signal is obtained, 
which may contain lower frequency components that may be in-band signals. The addition of a 
high-frequency (by-pass) capacitor across the input of amplifiers can help minimize demodulation 
products. Another nonlinear effect is the generation of other frequencies that, again, may coincide in 
frequency with operational components. Further details may be found in Reference 13.
Following References 14 and 15 we can illustrate how DC offsets come about in a NMOS source 
follower circuit shown in Figure 9.1a. Its equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9.1b where gm is the 
transistor transconductance and the source vemi represents the interfering voltage. From this circuit 
we obtain,

where the transfer function H obtained from (9.2) is frequency dependent. Naturally, the situation 
becomes more complicated if the interference levels are high when the small signal analysis pre￾sented here is no longer valid. If the interference frequency is lower that the frequency defined by 
RS, CS then during each period the capacitance is discharged fully through the resistance. However, 
if the interference frequency is high, then the R-C time constant is too long to allow for a full dis￾charge and hence we have a buildup of DC shift with inevitable nonlinear effects. Further details 
may be found in References 14–16.
9.2 THE IMMUNITY OF DIGITAL CIRCUITS
We summarize here the operation of logic gates and their associated noise margins.17 The transfer 
function of an ideal gate is shown by the thin line in Figure 9.2a; there is a sharp transition at the 
mid-point between the “low” and “high” logic levels. However, real gates show behavior that var￾ies around the ideal (Figure 9.2b). Output high is not necessarily VCC but may be as low as VOH. 
Similarly, an output low is not necessarily 0V but can be as high as VOL. A gate will recognize as an 
input high a voltage that is as low as VIH and as an input low a voltage that is as high as VIL. These 
different levels are shown in Figure 9.3. It can be seen that if noise were superimposed on the out￾put VOH of the driving gate, this would not affect the input of the driven gate as long as the voltage 
did not fall below VIH. Hence there is a margin of safety equal to VOH −VIH. This is designated as 
the “high noise margin” NMH. Similarly, a “low noise margin” can be defined as NML =VIL −VOL. 
This is essentially a static picture. If we apply a pulse that is above a threshold, the logic will switch 
provided the pulse duration is longer than the response time of the gate. Therefore, a dynamic noise 
margin recognizes that the shorter the pulse the higher its peak can be before it causes an upset.17
Typical static values for two common logic families are given in Table 9.1. 
FIGURE 9.2 Ideal inverter transfer characteristic (a) if the input is smaller than Vcc/2 then the output goes 
high, and typical inverter transfer characteristic (b).Effects of EMI on Devices and Systems 207
Another factor affecting gate performance refers to delays. Figure 9.4 depicts a typical situation 
indicating how the driving gate pulse is related to the driven gate pulse. In synchronously clocked 
circuits it is important to control delays in gates and also interconnects. Gate propagation delays are 
several nanoseconds depending on logic family. Timing depends on the various thresholds, inter￾connect delays, and any additional delays that may be caused by reflections, ringing, etc. Referring 
to the ringing on the output waveform in Figure 9.5, we see that at the points indicated by thick 
arrows the logic state is uncertain, and glitches may occur. In Figure 9.6 a schematic of input and 
output transitions is shown for a hypothetical gate depicting the timing relationships, the gate propa￾gation delay, and area where the signal and logic states are uncertain. Any pulse components due to 
interference that occur during signal transitions may modify timing relationships and logic states to 
the detriment of circuit operation.

FIGURE 9.4 Schematic illustrating gate propagation delay.208 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The same design principles already mentioned in Section 9.1 apply with obvious additional con￾siderations, i.e., the use of logic families with high noise margins and the use of defensive program￾ming to achieve EMC by software design (see Section 12.3.1). High levels of interference likely to 
exceed the noise margins of the device are described as static failures. More modest levels of inter￾ference are not sufficient to breach the noise margin but nevertheless lead to failures through their 
effect on time delays (dynamic failures). Software error correction codes can to some extent address 
some of these issues. Testing digital circuits for immunity is very challenging due to the many 
parameters affecting failure. As an example, an interfering pulse may or may not cause interference 
depending on the instant in time during the cycle that it is applied. Testing at a single frequency 
is not very helpful as nonlinear effects can produce a multitude of other frequency components. 
Digital systems appear to be more susceptible to broadband noise. Current standards and test pro￾cedures are rooted to the traditional need to protect radio systems and hence less suitable for digital 
technology. Some of these issues are aired in References 18 and 19. 
There are international standards for IC radiated and conducted emissions (IEC 61967)1 and for 
susceptibility (IEC 62132).2 A detailed discussion of EMC, Signal and Power Integrity for ICs may 
be found in References 3 and 4.

9.3 EFFECTS OF INTENTIONAL EMI ON INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
Modern societies are increasingly dependent on the efficient and secure functioning of extensive 
national and international infrastructure systems. These include telecommunication, data and power 
transmission, gas and water utilities, transportations systems (road, rail, air, and sea), and health and 
rescue services. These services can be compromised in a variety of ways. Physical damage is the obvi￾ous way, but it is not the only one. As all such systems depend on electronics and data processing, cyber￾attacks and intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) are also credible threats to infrastructure.
Cyberattacks are attempts to damage or steal data, to spread computer viruses, or to deny service. 
IEMI is the deliberate introduction of EM noise or signals into electronic systems for the purpose of 
damaging or disrupting their proper functioning.20,21 Large-scale EM threats may come about from 
exceptional events such as NEMP or HEMP, but more likely by using high-power electromagnetic
(HPEM) sources.22 Current technology allows the construction of compact portable devices capable 
of delivering intense EMI pulses to compromise electronic systems. HPEM sources with a spectrum 
of interference in the range between a few hundred MHz and a few GHz are a severe threat to sys￾tems operating in this range. Their electronic boxes typically resonate in this frequency range, thus 
making coupling most effective.
The task of the operators of infrastructure systems is to identify current and potential threats, the 
manner in which they interact with systems, and means by which such systems may be protected 
(hardening). Examples of work in this area at the European level may be found in References 23–25.
9.4 EMI RISK MANAGEMENT
We have addressed in the previous section the problem of the protection of infrastructure against IEMI 
threats. The complexity of such systems and the range of potential threats is such that full-proof coun￾termeasures, if at all possible, come at a considerable cost. However, providing minimal protection in 
all circumstances, risks encountering catastrophic failures and outages. This situation requires a sys￾tematic risk assessment covering all stages in the lifetime of a system. We have already given examples 
of vulnerable systems, but it must be stressed that this is an expanding list as more “smart devices” are 
introduced and developments such as “the Internet of things” (IoT) are upon us (see Section 16.4).
In addressing such complex situations, a probabilistic approach is necessary to quantify, in statisti￾cal terms, the possibility of the occurrence of a threat, the likelihood of an impact on the system, and 
the level of risk that designers and operators are prepared to take. All these factors are specific to the 
system considered and the environment in which it operates. Work in recent years has focused on 
adapting techniques developed for failure mode analysis in other engineering fields to the IEMI prob￾lem. Based on the work reported in References 26 and 27, we may distinguish a number of steps in this 
process. Risk analysis must establish the scope of the exercise and the level of risk which is acceptable 
in each case. All stakeholders must be aware of the reasons behind the decisions made and the actions 
they need to take. The main task of the EMC specialist is to establish the technical boundaries related 
to credible threats, coupling mechanisms, the probability of upsets, and their perceived criticality. 
Similarly, technical measures must be implemented to reduce risks to acceptable levels. A monitoring 
and review regime must be established and remain active throughout the lifetime of the system.
Further details can be found in the references given. Some examples of building EMI resilience 
into products may be found in Reference 28.

Interference Control Techniques
In Parts I and II the concepts underlying electromagnetic compatibility and the main analytical and 
numerical predictive models were described. The intention has been to provide the reader with a feel 
for the issues relevant to EMC and with the necessary tools to predict the behavior of systems. It was 
repeatedly pointed out that typical systems are complex and that simplifications must be made to reduce 
problems to tractable proportions. This reduction should always be done on the basis of scientific under￾standing and engineering intuition and not simply in order to address the problem by using ready-made 
semi-empirical recipes. Notwithstanding the lofty nature of this statement, it has to be realized that con￾tinuing progress will be required to develop more sophisticated tools before a rigorous, self-consistent 
analysis of all EMC problems is possible using a modest investment in time and facilities.
An engineer confronted with designing a system to meet an EMC specification needs to have 
access to a number of remedies and control techniques that may be used to reduce interference or 
increase immunity. The analyses presented in the first two parts would have defined the electromag￾netic environment and, hopefully, have identified areas or systems that must be specifically addressed 
from the EMC point of view. The aim of the next three chapters is to offer general guidance on practi￾cal measures that may be applied during EMC design, and suggestions as to what constitutes good 
EMC practice. The author is aware of the danger of trying to oversimplify matters so that the advice 
given sounds clear and authoritative. Confidence based on false premises can be counterproductive 
and such an attitude would be counter to the tone of this book. However, every attempt will be made 
to give reference, whenever possible, to more practical texts and publications, so that the reader is 
able to draw selectively on the experience of others who have faced similar problems.
The first design of a system that conforms to good practice can be used for further optimization 
by using an experimental or a simulation approach. A good first design will allow a straightforward 
application of these tools. Any changes that are required at this stage may then be simply imple￾mented without a lengthy and expensive redesign of the entire system.

10 Shielding and Grounding
Shielding is employed to reduce the coupling of undesired fields with equipment. Its proper design to 
meet this objective has to be considered in association with other issues, such as weight, appearance, 
and ease of access. The need for shielding must be examined after all other means for reducing cou￾pling have been investigated. Total shielding is impossible without imposing unacceptable restric￾tions in the design of equipment. At low frequencies unacceptably thick shields may be required 
and the presence of wire penetrations, ventilation slots, and access points will compromise even 
the most carefully designed shield. Hence, as is common in design, a compromise must be sought 
to balance all the relevant technical, economic, and esthetic issues. The theoretical background to 
shielding was examined in Chapter 6. The objective of the sections that follow is to offer a more 
practical view to the technology of shielding and the associated problem of grounding.
10.1 EQUIPMENT SCREENING
The construction of equipment cabinets that afford a certain amount of shielding (or screening) from 
electromagnetic fields is considered in this section. The problem of screening cables is addressed 
in Section 10.2.
10.1.1 Practical Levels of Attenuation
The amount of attenuation required from a shield is strongly dependent on the type of equipment 
under consideration. In some systems, such as aircraft, a certain amount of shielding is afforded by 
the structure of the craft. Shielding in such cases may be in the range of a few tens of decibels. In 
most applications attenuation of about 50 dB is adequate, except in cases of sensitive measurement 
instruments, high-frequency transmitting equipment, and tracking and guidance systems, where 
attenuation in excess of 100 dB may be required. Clearly, the materials and construction practice 
used in each case reflects the type of specification that must be met. A simple wire-mesh made of 
galvanized steel with wire spacing of 10 mm has a shielding effectiveness ranging, approximately, 
from 80 dB at 1 MHz to 20 dB at 1 GHz. More often than not, the overall specification, which 
includes the effects of all other factors, such as cooling slots, small gaps in modular construction 
designs, instrument panels, wire penetrations, connectors, etc., must be considered. Further details 
of theoretical shielding effectiveness of shields made of various materials and thicknesses may be 
found in Reference 1.
10.1.2 Screening Materials
In many applications, equipment screens may be constructed using conducting materials such as 
steel, aluminum, and copper. With proper control of manufacture, in particular of joints between 
panels, a very high degree of shielding may be achieved. For example, an aluminum sheet with a 
thickness of 0.125 mm can offer a screening effectiveness to plane waves exceeding 100 dB at 1 
MHz. There are, however, applications where for esthetic, cost, or weight reasons, fully metallic 
enclosures cannot be used. Widespread use is now being made of various plastics that by themselves 
offer no electromagnetic shielding. An approach to making the plastic partially conducting is to 
use a filler such as carbon fiber. The electrical conductivity of the resulting composite is higher the 
larger the ratio of the filler to the plastic material. In practice, shielding effectiveness of a few tens 
of decibels is possible. An alternative approach is to use a conductive coating on the plastic base 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-13214 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
material. This can be applied by painting, spraying, or any other suitable process. In practice only 
very thin conducting layers can be applied in this way and the low-frequency performance of such 
shields has to be considered carefully by comparing the skin depth for the conducting layer to its 
thickness. Materials used for coating depend on the manufacturer and the coating process and are 
typically nickel, copper, zinc, etc.
In every case, it is of paramount importance to ascertain the electrical effectiveness of joints 
made between different panels of the plastic material and of other attachments to them. This assess￾ment must cover the entire lifetime of the equipment. Manufacturers quote the shielding effective￾ness of a panel but this quantity is not a sure guide to the shielding effectiveness of a cabinet made 
by using such panels. In addition to the problem of joints already referred to, the presence of cavity 
resonances inside the partially conducting cabinet walls has now to be considered. At resonance 
frequencies, the electromagnetic environment inside the cabinet cannot be ascertained from the 
shielding effectiveness of panels alone and a full study along the lines indicated in Chapters 6 and 
8 is necessary.
In certain applications, e.g., displays, there is a requirement for electromagnetic shielding, while 
at the same time visual transmission must not be significantly impaired so that the display remains 
readable. Various techniques are available to achieve this. One option is to enclose a thin wire mesh 
between two layers of plastic or glass. Another option is to deposit a transparent conductive coat￾ing. Whichever technology is used, a partial loss of light transmission (approximately 50%) can be 
expected, with shielding effectiveness at high frequencies claimed to be in excess of 50 dB. Data on 
the attenuation achieved by different materials used in construction may be found in Reference 2.
Some of the more recent material developments are likely to have a major impact on shielding. 
For this reason, a brief introduction to this exciting area is given below.
Developments in nanotechnology are enhancing material choices in EMC for better shielding. It 
is possible to construct metalodielectric multilayered structures that have the same thickness as tradi￾tional thin metal screens but with a much higher transmittance at optical frequencies. These so-called 
“transparent metals” are opaque at microwave frequencies but transparent at optical frequencies. The 
physics behind their optical transmission properties are rooted to photonic bandgap theory.3−5 A more 
detailed coverage of advanced materials is given below and in Sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.2.
Recent developments have led to a systematic study of bandgap structures not simply for photonic 
applications but also at much lower microwave frequencies. These are generally referred to as elec￾tromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures.6 The area most commonly exploited in EMC is the design 
of surfaces that present a high impedance over a band of frequencies. Thus, current flows may be 
controlled on such surfaces selectively at specific frequency bands. Current flow is paramount in 
shielding and coupling and hence the importance of these developments. It is worth clarifying how 
a conducting surface shields against incident fields. For a perfect smooth electrical conductor (PEC) 
the electric field tangential to the surface must be zero; hence, currents are induced that generate 
a reflected electric field that is out of phase (π radians) to the incident field. Thus, in total, the tan￾gential electric field at the surface is zero. The field away from the PEC is the combination of the 
original field and the reflected component, which is phase shifted to meet the boundary conditions 
at the conductor surface. Conditions are analogous to those encountered by a wave on a transmis￾sion line encountering a short-circuit termination. An antenna placed parallel and very near a PEC 
does not radiate well due to the destructive interference between the incident and reflected waves. 
This is the reason why a ground plane is, in general, beneficial in reducing emissions provided it is 
very close to the radiating structure. A finite PEC introduces some complications due to radiation 
from its edges. Let us now examine how a high-impedance surface (HIS) behaves. Conditions are 
analogous to those encountered when a wave traveling on a TL encounters an open circuit — it is 
reflected, but the reflected component is in phase with the incident wave component. Thus, for a 
radiating element near an HIS, incident and reflected components are likely to interfere construc￾tively. This is primarily of interest to antenna designers. We are primarily interested here on the 
suppression of current flows brought about by an HIS and how such a surface may be constructed. Shielding and Grounding 215
Consider the basic element shown in Figure 10.1 consisting of the top plate, bottom plate, and the 
post joining the two plates. All the components are perfectly conducting. To illustrate the principle 
of how an HIS works, imagine that a number of these cells are arranged in one dimension to form 
the structure shown schematically in Figure 10.2a. Compared to a flat smooth metal surface this 
arrangement sustains TM waves propagating at a much lower velocity and also TE modes. An 
equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 10.2b where the L and C account for the electric and magnetic 
field storage (potential differences and current flows in the HIS). Clearly, the parallel LC resonance 
gives a higher impedance at selected frequency. A practical way in which such a scheme can be 
implemented is shown in Figure 10.3.7−10 An HIS is implemented in part (a) of this figure. A chip 
with a via connection is also shown in (b). High-frequency currents flowing through the via gener￾ate radiation that propagates between the two conducting planes. The presence of the HIS will sup￾press to some extent this radiation that otherwise would spread and couple to several other circuits 
through vias, common ground paths, etc. The dimension of the features of the HIS can be varied to 
achieve attenuation over the desired band of frequencies. 
The basic cell in the configuration shown in Figure 10.3 is shown in electrical circuit equivalent 
form in Figure 10.4, where the parameters of the shunt branch may be obtained from the dimen￾sions and material properties. Solution in the frequency domain is straightforward by obtaining the 
ABCD parameters of the basic cell and then the total parameters for a cascade of cells. Details may 
be found in the references already given.
We also mention ongoing general developments on new materials collectively referred to as 
“metamaterials,” the word “meta” deriving from the Greek for “coming after.” Conventional mate￾rials are used as found in nature, and as far as electrical properties are concerned, the available 
FIGURE 10.1 Basic element of a high-impedance surface (HIS).
FIGURE 10.2 Schematic of a one-dimensional HIS (a), and its electrical equivalent (b).216 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
range of ε,μis a limited one. The most obvious limitation is that both are constrained to be posi￾tive. Plotting the available materials on a ε-μ diagram will populate partially only one quadrant (μ, 
ε>0). It is possible by the judicious use of loaded loops and dipoles incorporated into a background 
material to generate artificial media — metamaterials — with a far wider range of parameters 
covering all four quadrants of the ε−μ diagram. Although the beginnings of this work were at opti￾cal frequencies, substantial progress has been made in extending these ideas down to microwave 
frequencies. The implications of these developments for EMC and SI are likely to be substantial 
and new approaches to shielding and controlling coupling are likely to emerge in the years to come. 
The interested reader may consult Section 10.4 in this Chapter and References 11 and 12 for a fuller 
introduction of novel materials, their characterization, modeling, and impact on EMC design.
10.1.3 Conducting Penetrations
It is often necessary to pass conductors through EM screens. These may be used to connect services 
(e.g., gas, water, compressed air), connect to the mains, or exchange signals.
Piping used to bring services can sometimes be electrically decoupled by placing insulating 
inserts on either side of the penetration. Earthed penetrations must be connected to the shield around 
the entire perimeter (360° joint) to minimize coupling between the EM environment external and 
FIGURE 10.3 A parallel plate line with an HIS as reference (a), and with a chip and via added to illustrate 
the propagation of interference (b).
FIGURE 10.4 Electrical equivalent of the basic cell in Figure 10.3.Shielding and Grounding 217
internal to the shield. The electrical conductivity of the shield and the conducting path between 
the point of entry and the earthing connection to the shield must be checked for integrity and, if 
possible, a path through panel joints must be avoided. Mains cables must not penetrate the shield 
without adequate filtering, as explained in Chapter 11. The same attention to earthing must be paid 
as explained earlier. In ascertaining the effectiveness of earthing arrangements, it must be borne in 
mind that it is not only the DC resistance that matters. At high frequencies it is the impedance to 
earth that counts and, unfortunately, the magnitude of this quantity is difficult to establish. Similarly, 
signal cables must pass through the shield without, as far as possible, breaching its integrity. The 
screening of cables is discussed in Section 10.2. Whether filtering is a realistic option depends on 
the particular circumstances, such as the frequency spectrum of the EMI in relation to that of the 
signal. In many situations standard connectors are used to connect cables to equipment. It should be 
emphasized that the connector must be regarded as an important part of the cable shield system and 
must conform to the same EMC specification as other parts of the system.
10.1.4 Slits, Seams, and Gasketing
Any gaps in the shield allow the penetration of fields, as explained in Chapter 6. Accurate calcula￾tion of the shielding effectiveness under these circumstances is not an easy matter and resort must 
be made to numerical techniques as explained in Chapter 8. However, during an initial conceptual 
design of a system, it is necessary to estimate the likely deterioration in shielding due to various 
openings so that likely problem areas are identified and addressed in greater detail. The shielding 
effectiveness in the presence of a small hole of radius r has been estimated in Section 6.3.
SE = λ 20 log / ( ) 2πr , in dB
For holes of other shapes the factor 2πr may be replaced by 2l where l is the largest dimension of 
the hole,13 hence
SE = λ 20 log / ( ) 2l
This formula indicates that a slot with greatest dimension equal to 1/20 of the wavelength has a 
shielding effectiveness of 20 dB. At a frequency of 1 GHz this level of performance implies that 
1=1.5 cm. The smaller the opening (hole, slot, gap, etc.), the better the shielding effectiveness. 
The shielding effectiveness is reduced as the number of openings N is increased and it scales as 
the square root of N. This can be easily confirmed by substituting in the formula for the effective 
aperture in Section 6.3 Ae ≃ N πr2. Long thin apertures can be made less likely to contribute to poor 
shielding by replacing them with several smaller apertures. A rule of thumb often used in designs is 
to keep the largest dimension of all openings smaller than 1/20 of the smallest wavelength of inter￾est. This can be done, depending on the physical requirements, by introducing conducting fingers, 
bolts, metal grills, conducting mesh, etc.
A seam is in many ways similar to a very narrow slot but where imperfect electrical contact 
is being made at various points along its length. Perfect contact can only be ensured by welding 
along the seam, but this is impractical in many cases. Riveting and bolting are reasonable alterna￾tives provided their spacing is smaller than 1/20 of the wavelength. A plain seam exhibits shielding 
behavior that depends on the electrical quality of the contact between the two panels. On contact 
points a resistance is present that depends primarily on the condition of the surfaces. This resistance 
can be very high when the surfaces are painted, corroded, etc. Where there is no contact, a small 
capacitance is present between the panels. Hence, in electrical terms, the seam presents an imped￾ance that is effectively the parallel combination of resistance and capacitance. Shielding properties 
will therefore be frequency dependent. A simple expedient that can reduce penetration due to seams 
is to increase the area of overlap between panels.218 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The same difficulties arise around doors, hatches, and other removable panels, where effectively 
a seam is formed. Improvements can be made by using finger strips made of beryllium copper to 
establish a more reliable electrical connection between panels. Another alternative is to use conduc￾tive gasket material. This can be made out of knitted wire mesh or conducting rubber. This material 
is made in various shapes and is compressed by appropriate means between adjacent panels. Details 
of mounting methods and properties of various gasketing materials may be found in Reference 14.
In all the techniques used to improve the quality of joints and to minimize penetration through 
slots, the guiding principle must be the minimization of any disturbance to the normal flow of 
current in the shield. If normal current flow can be ascertained, the design and placement of slots, 
seams, etc., may be selected to adhere to this principle. It must always be borne in mind that what￾ever design choices are made, these must be appropriate not only during the initial use of the equip￾ment as new, but also throughout its lifetime. This is particularly important for demountable panels, 
doors, etc., where corrosion and normal wear and tear must be taken into account at the design and 
maintenance stage.
10.1.5 Damping of Resonances
It has already been mentioned that equipment cabinets are effectively resonant cavities with, nor￾mally, a low Q-factor. Hence, everything that has been said so far must be modified at specific 
frequencies where the cabinet becomes resonant. Formulae are available to calculate the resonances 
of simple cavities, but for a loaded cavity resort must be made to numerical methods. It is possible 
to seek the damping of resonances by introducing damping material, so that emission is reduced 
at these critical frequencies. Radiation-absorbing material (RAM) is routinely used to damp reso￾nances in screened rooms and newer materials such as ferrite tiles can also be used. It is possible to 
place a small amount of absorbing material in certain positions inside a screened room to achieve 
maximum dampings.15 Similar methods may be used for damping selected resonances in equipment 
cabinets.
10.1.6 Measurement of Screening Effectiveness
Often, especially with coated materials, the “resistance per square” is given by manufacturers. 
However, by far the most useful quantity for EMC studies is the shielding effectiveness (SE). Several 
methods have been developed to test the SE of materials. An example is the ASTM D 4935 test used 
to characterize materials illuminated by a plane wave. It consists of an expanded coaxial line with 
the inner and outer conductors interrupted to insert the test specimen. Other tests have been devel￾oped to test the performance of the specimen to E- and H-fields. These are referred to as near-field 
measurements and are variations of a configuration where the specimen is used to partition the test 
cell into two volumes. A transmitting and receiving antenna are placed at a specified distance on 
either side of the specimen and measurements are taken with and without the specimen to establish 
the SE. Linear dipoles or loops are used depending on whether E- or H-field measurements are 
required. In all these tests care must be taken to check the repeatability of the measurements, espe￾cially for various conducting plastics where the establishment of good electrical contact with the test 
cell is difficult to ensure. Further details maybe found in References 16 and 17.
10.2 CABLE SCREENING
Three aspects of cable screening are considered in this section, namely the transfer impedance, 
connectors, and earthing. These are all important in establishing EMC in a cable system. There are 
cases where cable screening is not required, either because emission is negligible or when the equip￾ment has a high immunity threshold. Twisted pair and ribbon cable are widely used in many appli￾cations without screening. A twisted pair cable is quite effective in minimizing interference at low Shielding and Grounding 219
frequencies and may also be shielded to provide additional isolation. Ribbon cable is used exten￾sively in information technology equipment. Screening may be used, if required, but in most cases 
some effort on improving ground returns is worthwhile. Placing the ribbon cable near a ground 
plane, providing an integral ground plane, or providing several ground returns in the ribbon cable to 
minimize ground loops are all matters to be considered in design.18 In the most demanding applica￾tions, however, fully screened cables are used.
10.2.1 Cable Transfer Impedance
The transfer impedance is a measure of the voltage induced on the inside surface of a shield for a 
current flowing on the outside surface of the shield. For a general situation, a transfer impedance 
and also an admittance were defined in Chapter 6, the former characterizing coupling to currents 
and the latter to voltages. For shields connected to ground by low-impedance paths, or when the 
shield is far from grounded structures and is of good quality (high braid coverage) then the transfer 
admittance is small and coupling to voltages may be neglected. Only in cases where there is a high 
impedance from shield to ground, as in cases of a bad or broken connection, effects due to Yt
 need 
to be considered. In most cases of practical design, attention therefore focuses on reducing the trans￾fer impedance to acceptable values. Screens can be made of solid material, braid, foil, or various 
combinations. A shield made out of solid high-conductivity material offers excellent isolation and 
a transfer impedance that decreases with increasing frequency. Its use, however, is restricted by its 
rigidity, which makes it unsuitable for many applications. A braided shield offers a good alternative.
The proportion of the shield area consisting of conducting material, referred to as the cover￾age, should be high — in excess of 80% for good shielding. Penetration of fields through the small 
holes in the shield and distortion of current paths limit the effectiveness of braided shields and, 
more importantly, cause the transfer impedance to increase with increasing frequency. A single 
braided shield offers a transfer impedance, typically of a few milliohms per meter up to about a few 
megahertz. If a lower transfer impedance is required, two shields may be used offering values in 
the range of 10−4 Ω/m at 10 MHz. Using four braids offers further improvements. Ferromagnetic 
materials may be used as part of a shield to reduce Zt
 at low frequencies. Theoretical results have 
been reported of cables with two mu-metal shields placed between three copper braid shields giving 
values of Zt
 in the 10−6 Ω/m range.19 It should be borne in mind that the exact value of Zt
 depends 
critically on the quality of manufacture and manner of use, and for this reason it is difficult to pre￾dict theoretically the behavior of cables. A number of results for a range of commercially available 
cables together with methods for measuring Zt
 may be found in Reference 20. A schematic of the 
construction of a braided shield is shown in Figure 10.5.

Each bundle is described as a carrier and carriers alternate in top and bottom positions in a com￾plex weave pattern. There are inevitably small gaps in coverage (described as apertures in the fig￾ure). The electric field can penetrate directly through these apertures contributing to YT. Similarly, 
magnetic fields can leak through the apertures and also directly through the weave pattern in a 
process called “porpoising.” All these factors contribute to the transfer impedance as described in 
Section 6.2.6. Analytical models of the transfer impedance are available (e.g. Vance, Kley, and Tiny 
models) and may be studied in specialist publications.21 The transfer impedance of an x-directed 
cable is defined as,
= ∂
∂ Z 1
I
V
x T
where I is the current flowing on the outer surface of the shield and V is the voltage on the inside 
of the shield.
Manufacturing tolerances and the practical use of shielded cables (flexing, bending) imply that 
accurate quantification of the transfer impedance is difficult and that its value may vary along its 
length depending on local conditions. Testing and measurement of the transfer impedance under 
these conditions is difficult and subject to several uncertainties. A discussion of the uncertainties 
inherent in cable transfer impedance may be found in Reference 22.
In electrically long cables (length≥wavelength), resonances along the transmission lines formed 
by successive shields complicate matters and it is then difficult to predict performance without exten￾sive study. Lossy materials (various ferrites) may be used to damp these resonances. In many sys￾tems, a large number of wires with a single ground return wire are placed in close proximity to each 
other inside a shield (e.g., in telephony). In such cases it is difficult to predict performance as it is 
affected by crosstalk and coupling through the shield. The study of the latter case, which is addressed 
in this section, presents many difficulties. A single circuit consisting of a wire-pair inside the shield 
will be subject to common-mode interference (signal induced between the wire-pair and the ground 
return) and differential-mode interference (signal induced between the two wires). Hence, it is neces￾sary to establish, effectively, a transfer impedance both for differential- and common-mode signals. 
Apart from saying that common-mode signals are in general higher than differential-mode signals it 
is difficult to offer any other general advice due to the complexity and variability of practical systems.
Modeling of coaxial cables in realistic configurations is complicated because of the coupling, 
through the transfer impedance, between inner and outer spaces relative to the shield. A typical 
configuration is shown in Figure 10.6a -a coaxial cable above ground. Here, there are effectively 
two transmission lines.
The first consists of the inner conductor and the shield of the coaxial cable, and the second con￾sists of the shield and the reference (ground). The two lines are coupled through the transfer imped￾ance of the cable and hence any source voltage VW applied to the cable will induce an undesirable 
voltage VS. A model of this system is sketched out in Figure 10.7a where we have shown a segment 
of the two lines with their parameters and have introduced two terms M, Rm to indicate the coupling

through the transfer impedance. One of the numerical complications of this type of system is that 
the first line describing the coaxial cable is normally insulated with a solid dielectric while the 
second line (shield to reference) is air insulated. Hence, the velocity of propagation in the two lines 
is different and for the same spatial resolution the time step will not be the same in the two lines. 
This lack of synchronism is problematic in modeling as we have mentioned already in Section 8.7. 
What is normally done to keep the same space and time step throughout the model is to choose a 
common space and time step and model all the inductance the link lines shown in Figure 10.7b. 
Any additional capacitance is then added in the form of open-circuit stub (see Sections 8.6 and 8.7 
for details of modeling methods).
Another case to consider is a coaxial cable immersed in a field and thus coupled to it through its 
transfer impedance. In a full-field model of this problem the coaxial cable is inserted into a compu￾tational cell (e.g. a node in TLM) and consists of a TL representing the cable inner environment and 
another TL representing the cable shield and the boundary (reference) of the cell. This second line 
is coupled to the field as shown in Figure 10.7c. In this problem there are two coupling mechanisms. 
First, the coupling through the transfer impedance represented by the coupling matrices to the left and 
right of the cell, [Yl
] and [Yr
] respectively. Second, we have the coupling of the shield-reference line 
to the field indicated by Ux, Zx for an x-directed cable. The last two quantities refer to the x-directed 
contributions from the electric field e.g. for a TLM model of a cable in free-space Ux is the average of 
the four x-polarized ports and Zx a quarter of the free-space impedance (see inset in Figure 10.7c). The 
model shown in Figure 10.7c depicts one segment where the Thevenin equivalents on the left and right 
are defined by the incident voltage pulses from adjacent segments as used in TLM models.
Another example is of the coupling between two coaxial cables in proximity to each other and 
in the presence of a third reference conductor as in Figure 10.6b. In models, we describe one of the 
cables as the source coax and the other as the victim coax as shown in Figure 10.8. The source and 
load terminations of the source coax are shown and the terminations of the victim coax at its start

and end are ZV0 and ZVL respectively. Voltages VV0 and VVL therefore represent interference caused 
by the transfer impedance induced coupling. The important feature to notice here is the presence of 
a tertiary circuit consisting of the two coaxial cable braids and the reference conductor. Differential 
and common-mode current are circulating in this tertiary circuit.
Further details and examples of cable coupling may be found in References 56 and 57 of 
Chapter 8 and References 23 and 24 of this chapter. 
10.2.2 Earthing of Cable Screens
The grounding or otherwise of cable screens affects significantly the EMC performance of cables. 
As a general rule, cable screens must be earthed at both ends to maximize magnetic field shielding. 
This is particularly true at high frequencies and for electrically long cable where earthing the shield 
at several points is necessary. The so-called “ground loops” are present but at high frequencies these 
are best described as transmission lines presenting a range of impedances depending on frequency 
and cable length. This point is discussed further in the next section. At low frequencies and in cases 
where the shield also serves as signal return, the formation of a ground loop causes interference, 
which appears as noise in the signal path. Various ways are available to reduce this noise by break￾ing the ground loop using, for example, optocouplers or transformers. Better performance may be 
achieved by introducing a second shield separate from the signal return path. Another issue that 
affects these arrangements is whether both sides of a circuit (source and load ends) are connected 
to ground. A discussion of these matters in connection with low-frequency instrumentation circuits 
may be found in Reference 13 (page 89) and in References 25 and 26.
In cables with multiple shields it is common practice to ground both ends of all shields. Studies 
have shown that in this case the induced voltage is proportional to cable length. If the lines formed 
by intermediate shields are matched or left on open circuit, then induced voltages vary as length 
squared and cubed, respectively.18 As stressed before, grounding of shields must be made using a 
360° connection avoiding breaches in conductor continuity. Entry of cables through equipment 
screens requires good connection between the cable and the screen. Attention must be given to the 
mechanical arrangement necessary to establish and maintain a good electrical connection, a suit￾able solution being to clamp the cables between a conducting block and bracket. This ensures that 
good electrical connection is made to the cable screen. The block should be bolted to the equipment 
screen, making sure that a good electrical connection is established. Consideration must also be 
given to the integrity of the entire ground path to avoid interference with and from other circuits.

10.2.3 Cable Connectors
It makes limited sense to select expensive cables with low transfer impedance, if the connectors 
used at the cable ends fail to meet the same high standards. It should be borne in mind that the 
total transfer impedance is the sum of the transfer impedance of the cable plus the two connectors 
at its ends. A standard BNC connector has a Zt
 value of the order of 2 mΩ, whereas for a typical 
cable Zt ≃ 1 mΩ/m. N-type connectors have a value of Zt
 typically less than 1 mΩ up to frequen￾cies of several hundred megahertz. High-performance connectors suitable for high-specification 
environments, such as EMP connectors, have a value of Zt
, less than a tenth of a milliohm. The 
comparison between typical values of Zt
 for cables and connectors becomes more unfavorable at 
high frequencies. The connector can thus be the weak link in the chain and must be selected care￾fully. In selecting good connectors attention must be paid to the manner of connection to the cable 
screen (360°), compatibility of materials to avoid corrosion, and the quality of all other connections. 
Improvisations, such as pigtail connections, must be avoided, since even a short length of wire intro￾duces an inductance of several nanohenry and thus considerably increases Zt
 at high frequencies. 
The temptation to believe that a low DC resistance is a sufficient indication of low Zt
 at all frequen￾cies must be resisted.
Another factor that affects cable design in general is the selection of wires or PCB tracks to carry 
certain signals, i.e., digital, analogue, and power. This choice is sometimes determined by the ease 
of connection to circuit boards and by connector design. EMC considerations must influence these 
decisions at an early stage in the design. Common-sense advice is to keep as far apart as possible 
wire pairs carrying signals likely to cause interference and those connecting high-sensitivity cir￾cuits. It may be convenient and cheap to have one wire as a ground return for several circuits, but 
this approach may result in large loops and hence the risk of interference. These matters must be 
considered, and sufficient connections allowed for coping with the special requirements imposed 
by EMC.
10.3 GROUNDING
Grounding is one of the most complex issues to confront the designer. Part of the difficulty associ￾ated with this topic is that the purpose of grounding is not simply EMC compliance, but it is also 
there to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment. Hence, any change in grounding arrange￾ments to satisfy EMC requirements is always conditional on meeting electrical safety regulations. 
These two aspects of grounding do not sit comfortably together, and care must be taken to meet 
all requirements as far as possible. For the power engineer, grounding is all to do with safety of 
personnel, tripping of protective devices, blowing of fuses, etc. For the electronic engineer, it has 
to do with signal referencing. In most cases, these professionals have little understanding of each 
other’s problems, creating a tension that makes grounding such an emotive issue. The nomenclature 
used reflects the different attitudes and practices, e.g., protective earth, common, reference, chassis, 
etc. To avoid confusion the term grounding is used here to refer to arrangements at the low-voltage 
side of equipment. The primary purpose of these arrangements may be electrical safety (protective 
grounding) or signal reference (reference ground).
Understanding and improving grounding requires knowledge and control of current flow. This 
in turn implies detailed knowledge of the complete current path. Notwithstanding the difficulties 
of identifying this path, it is unfortunately true that in normal design practice no attempt is made 
to specify in detail grounding arrangements. In many drawings the grounding connection is shown 
by an arrow or a chassis symbol without any further explanation of where exactly this connection 
is to be made. Hence, the first step in helping to establish good grounding practices is to ensure that 
ground connections are explicitly shown in every detail in the layout of circuits and equipment. The 
practice of studying circuits using one-line diagrams does not do anything toward better grounding. 
Only the study of the complete path of grounding currents can help identify potential problems and 224 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
point to solutions. The objective must be to ensure that the flow of these currents does not establish 
high-potential differences interfering with the normal operation of circuits (proper layout and small 
impedance of grounding conductors), and that induced fields cause the minimum disturbance in 
adjacent circuits (proper layout, shielding). It follows that keeping current flows as localized as pos￾sible minimizes earth loops and hence coupling, as does proper layout of circuits likely to produce 
or be particularly sensitive to interference. Particular aspects of grounding are examined below for 
different systems.
10.3.1 Grounding in Large-Scale Systems
Grounding in large electrical installations presents many complications. The physical separation 
between various parts of the installation and the variety of tasks that grounding is intended to per￾form present conceptual, practical, and management problems. The general advice is to ground at 
a single point the protective earth connection of the electrical supply to the installation. It is true, 
however, that in some cases more than one supply feed is present, and that, in any case, grounding 
at a single point requires several and long grounding conductors. This is impractical and may also 
be technically unsatisfactory. The following example helps to illustrate the difficulty of grounding 
in a large system.27
In Figure 10.9, a grounding connection is shown schematically. Of interest to the designer is the 
impedance Zin seen across AA′. The grounding conductor AB has a diameter d, length l, and is at 
an average height h above the earth or reference plane CA′. The impedance Zin depends entirely 
on the frequency and the parameters of the arrangement shown in Figure 10.9. At low frequencies 
(e.g., mains power) it may be acceptable to neglect all other contributions except the resistance of 
the conductor R. This may be kept low by choosing a high-conductivity, large-diameter conductor, 
and ensuring that connection at point C is made using appropriate electrodes properly connected to 
the plane. As the frequency increases, it is no longer possible to neglect the inductance L associated 
with this arrangement, since at some stage it becomes the dominant part of the total impedance. A 
low DC resistance does not guarantee a low impedance at high frequencies or for fast current pulses. 
As the frequency increases further, there comes a point when the length l is comparable to the 
wavelength. The impedance seen across AA′ is then obtained from transmission line theory and is
Z j Z tan 2πl/ in = λ 0  ( ) (10.2)
where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line formed by conductor AB and the 
plane CA′. The important feature of this formula is that Zin depends strongly on the ratio l/λ. For 
l/λ=0.25, Zin tends to infinity, suggesting very poor grounding arrangements. Although in various 
practical systems the values of parameters will be different, the main conclusion stands that Zin var￾ies very substantially from DC to frequencies at which the length of the conductor is comparable 
to the wavelength λ. A system in which l~λ is called electrically large and may be found in large 
FIGURE 10.9 Schematic of a connection to ground.Shielding and Grounding 225
installations (large l but low frequency) or in a physically small circuit where the frequency is very 
high or the rise-time of pulses is very short. In such cases it is counterproductive to talk about or 
seek single point earthing. The complexity indicated by Equation 10.2 and other phenomena not 
explicitly mentioned here, such as the conducting properties of the plane CA′, force the designer to a 
different way of thinking. Multiple earthing is then preferable, keeping the length of each conductor 
small, in the region between 1/10 and 1/20 of the wavelength. For large outdoor installations and 
buildings, a ground grid is a useful means of providing a low-impedance path to which grounding 
connections are made.28
A further example, which illustrates the way the potential of a grounded object varies, is shown 
in Figure 10.10a. The structure consists of a steel tower 50 m in height, with a footing resistance 
Re=10 Ω. The latter quantity represents the resistance associated with the connection of the tower 
to earth. The problem considered here is the determination of the potential at points A and B when 
a fast current pulse (e.g., lightning) is injected at point B. The tower may be regarded, approxi￾mately, as a transmission line of characteristic impedance ZT = 130 Ω and propagation velocity 
FIGURE 10.10 Schematic of a lightning strike on a tower (a), equivalent circuit (b), Bewley lattice (c), volt￾age at A (d), and at B (e).226 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
u=240 m/μsec.29 The line is driven at point B by a current source rising to 20 kA in 1 μsec and 
remaining constant thereafter. The electrical analogue of this problem is shown in Figure 10.10b. 
Although the exact value of all parameters used in this model is subject to uncertainties, the calcu￾lation nevertheless illustrates the basic behavior to be expected from such systems. The reflection 
coefficients at the load and source are

respectively, where the source impedance Zs was chosen to be resistive and equal to 1500 Ω. The 
pattern of reflections is shown schematically in Figure 10.10c, by constructing the Bewley lattice 
(for details of this technique see section 15.2). The required voltages VA and VB are then shown in 
Figures 10.10d and e. Clearly, large voltages are induced at points that, on first examination, may be 
expected to be at a very low potential. The magnitude of these voltages is such as to risk a flashover 
to adjacent conductors that are at different potential, thus causing damage and further interference. 
In this example a very simple representation of the connection of the tower to earth was assumed 
(Re=10 Ω). In reality, the buried conductors at the foot of the tower constitute, at high frequencies, 
a transmission line and this introduces further complications to the model shown in Figure 10.10b. 
Connections to earth likely to experience high-frequency or impulsive currents, e.g., EMP installa￾tions, must be designed with these considerations in mind.30,31
It remains to stress that in extensive installations with several users, grounding principles must be 
established and adhered to over the lifetime of the installation and several changes in personnel, and 
that this requires that the grounding philosophy is explicitly stated and explained to all concerned.
10.3.2 Grounding in Self-Contained Equipment
Grounding in self-contained equipment where the only external connection is the mains supply 
presents the minimum number of complications. Protective earthing always adheres to the relevant 
electrical safety codes. Grounding inside the equipment is for referencing purposes and is designed 
to minimize impedance, eliminate as far as possible common grounding current paths between 
different circuits likely to interfere with each other, and to reduce coupling through radiated fields. 
The first requirement dictates that short conductors of adequate cross section are used. Whenever 
possible a ground plane is recommended to provide a low-impedance grounding connection. The 
typical arrangement is for the ground plane to be on the component side with through connec￾tions to signal tracks on the other side. This arrangement provides a well-defined transmission 
line between each track and the ground plane and also offers a certain amount of shielding. It is 
common to construct separate ground plane areas for analogue and digital signals that are joined 
at a point. This arrangement allows the option of adding further connections if it proves neces￾sary, and controls the flow of current in the grounding plane so that the sharing of a common 
path between different circuits with different characteristics is minimized. Careful placement of 
components and circuits minimizes common paths and also the area of ground loops, especially 
for high-frequency or fast pulse circuits. In PCB construction, it is advisable to consider placing 
such circuits close to connectors (if fast communications are necessary) and, if it is not possible to 
provide an extensive ground plane, at least some form of grounding strip should be incorporated 
along a side of the PCB to provide a low-impedance grounding path. It is also customary to provide 
capacitors between supply rails as near as possible to circuits generating fast pulses so that high￾frequency currents circulate in the smallest possible loop. Further advice as to how filtering should 
be used is given in the next chapter.Shielding and Grounding 227
10.3.3 Grounding in an Environment of Interconnected Equipment
This situation is typically encountered in data processing rooms with several physically separate but 
interconnected units. Mains connection is to different wall-mounted sockets, sometimes supplied 
by different power phases, whereas these different units are interconnected via data cables. It is dif￾ficult in this environment to maintain any kind of control of grounding arrangements. It is recom￾mended that ground potential variations between communicating devices should not exceed 0.25 
V.32 It is difficult to ensure this, especially if lightning currents are induced into the facility. The 
general grounding principles already discussed still apply, although changes to the working envi￾ronment are necessary. Ideally, the equivalent of a ground plane should be established to provide a 
low-impedance path for grounding currents. Depending on the nature and extent of the installation, 
this plane could be the floor and or work bench and may involve already existing structural parts 
of the building, e.g., steel reinforcement bars. Equipment cabinets and any conducting penetrations, 
such as pipe work, should be bonded by the shortest possible route to the ground plane. Any external 
connections such as power and data cables should preferably be brought into a single distribution 
location and their respective ground connections bonded to the ground plane. Filtering and nonlin￾ear protective devices may also be connected at this location to suppress external overvoltages and 
equalize ground potential fluctuations on various incoming connections. The objective must be to 
avoid making connections to equipment from outlets of an uncertain ground potential. Although 
difficulties may still arise, it is important that a well-thought-out grounding methodology exists and 
that it is documented and explained to all personnel likely to interfere with these arrangements. 
This applies not only to electrical contractors but also those responsible for other building services.
Further discussion of practical grounding arrangements may be found in the literature.33,34
10.4 NOVEL MATERIALS AND EMC
A brief introduction to novel materials for the general reader was given in Section 10.1.2. It was 
shown that the range of physical material parameters (μ, ε) may be extended by the so-called meta￾materials and also that nanomaterials can bring new possibilities for EMC design. In this section, 
we cover these topics in more depth to address the needs of the specialist readers who need to 
exploit the full spectrum of available options. This is a fast-developing area, and new concepts 
and products are likely to emerge as designers grapple with miniaturization, fast transitions, more 
intense EM coupling, and multiple demands on the frequency spectrum.
Absorption of EM radiation, reflections, and shielding are all of interest to EMC, and therefore, 
we start with a formalized example of how EM energy is reflected, absorbed, and transmitted as 
it propagates through different media. We can get a clear physical insight into this process if we 
consider the example of propagation along a non-uniform transmission line with a discontinuity as 
shown in Figure 10.11.
This arrangement can help visualize the propagation of EM energy from a medium of charac￾teristic impedance Z1 to a medium with characteristic impedance Z2 after it encounters a lumped 
discontinuity of impedance Z. A very common EMC case is when the two media are free space and

Z represents a screen of some sort, e.g., a resistive thin sheet or a perforated screen.35 This is the case 
we examine in more detail below. The reflection and transmission coefficients are,

(10.3)
The value of Z that minimizes both reflection and transmission is Z = Z0/2, and in this case, we 
obtain Γ = − = 0.5, T 0.5. For an incident pulse of 1 V (incident power 12/Z0), the reflected and trans￾mitted powers are, respectively, (−0.5)2/Z0 = 0.25/Z0 and (0.5)2/Z0 = 0.25/Z0. Therefore, the propor￾tion of power absorbed by the lumped discontinuity is,
A 1 = − Γ − T 1 = − 0.25 − = 0,25 0.5
We see that, at best, only half the power is absorbed with this arrangement and that if we want to 
do better we need to pay much more attention to the details of this process and move away from 
a lumped (zero thickness) absorber. Naturally, a thin absorber is highly desirable in EMC applica￾tions. The engineer is called upon to design the thinnest possible absorber which, ideally, does not 
allow for reflections. Some examples of common absorbers are shown schematically in Figure 10.12 
and are discussed in more detail further in this section.
Pyramidal absorbers made of carbon-loaded foam need a height of the order of the wavelength 
to be effective, and this can be expensive and cumbersome in many applications. Ferrite absorbers 
have frequency limitations, but are often used in combination with pyramidal absorbers for opti￾mum performance.
The example shown in Figure 10.11 is not the most typical of EMC applications where most often 
we are interested in avoiding reflections from a conducting wall (perfect electrical conductor, PEC). 
We now consider in more detail the interaction of EM fields with such surfaces. In Figure 10.13a and 
on the left, a positive charge moving with velocity v and its associated current I are shown (actual 
charges) above a PEC boundary.
Their mirrors, according to EM theory, are shown below the PEC. The actual charges above 
the PEC are electromagnetically equivalent to the actual and mirror charges without the PEC. We 
see that actual and mirror currents are in the opposite direction, and therefore, an incident electric 
field on a PEC boundary is reflected with an opposite sign as shown on the right of Figure 10.13a. 
Thus, the incident and reflected electric field tend to cancel each other. If the actual current element 
represents an antenna, which is placed parallel to a conducting body, e.g., aircraft skin (conformal 
antenna), its radiating efficiency may be diminished. A PEC boundary behaves as a short circuit 
in electrical terms. The question often arises whether the reflection from a PEC can be altered 
by adding a suitable layer of material so that the reflection has the same sign and the total field is 
d=λ/4

enhanced. Such a surface is known as a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), and its response to elec￾tric charges, current, and field is as shown in Figure 10.13b. We see that a PMC boundary is a plane 
of symmetry and an open circuit in electrical terms.
The general task of the engineer is to devise a covering for a PEC that consists of a thin substrate 
with a metalized pattern on it, as shown in Figure 10.13c, such that reflections from the PEC can be 
tailored to any desired specification.
In Figure 10.14a, a PEC is shown with a substrate of thickness d.35,36 Its transmission line equiva￾lent is shown in Figure 10.14b and simplified further in c. The input impedance shown is that of a 
short-circuited line of length d and may be obtained from (10.2).
We note that if the thickness is chosen to be a quarter of the wavelength, then the input imped￾ance tends to infinity and thus the PEC boundary at this frequency behaves like an open circuit 
(PMC). In effect, this arrangement acts as an impedance transformer. This is an example of a 
Salisbury absorber shown in Figure 10.12d. A similar design but with several layers to better match 
the PEC boundary to free space is the Jaumann absorber shown in Figure 10.12e. These types of 
absorber were used extensively in the early days of radar. Again, a quarter wavelength thickness 
may be undesirable in certain applications. A way around this is to engineer a metalized pattern 
of impedance ZS as shown in Figures 10.12f and d such that in combination with the substrate 
input impedance gives us the desired total impedance but with d d ′ < . The equivalent circuit of this 
arrangement is shown in Figure 10.14 e and f. For a thickness smaller than the wavelength, we can 
use the small argument expansion for the tangent in (10.2) to obtain Z j IN ωµd, i.e., an inductive 
impedance. If we choose the metalized pattern impedance to be capacitive ZS 1/( ) j Cω , then the 
total terminating impedance is the parallel combination = ωµ
− ω µ
Z || Z j d
1 Cd S IN 2 .
At the resonant frequency ω0 = µ 1 Cd, the impedance tends to infinity; thus, now, at around 
this frequency, the PEC behaves like a PMC.36 Naturally, there are many other options as long as we 
are able to design arbitrary surface impedances.

10.4.1 Metamaterials
We have already presented the basics of the interaction of EM waves with surfaces commonly 
encountered in EMC problems. It was shown that surfaces may be covered with material layers of a 
certain thickness to reduce reflections or more generally to tailor scattering to our particular speci￾fications. For convenience, this should be done using material layers that are as thin as possible and 
in the more general case scattering and absorption may be frequency dependent. As an example, we 
may wish signals at certain specified frequency bands to transmit while at all other frequencies to be 
absorbed. Alternatively, we may wish that absorption should be signal shape and amplitude depen￾dent. All these requirements are dependent on having materials with physical properties, which 
span a wide range of values.
When an EM wave impinges on a material, it initiates a material response, which in the case of 
an electric field causes polarization (relative shift of positive and negative charges in atoms) and for 
magnetic fields a re-alignment of elementary magnetic dipoles. The external manifestation of these 
responses is encapsulated in the properties of the material known as electrical permittivity ε and 
magnetic permeability μ. Nature offers us a limited range of these two important parameters. For 
materials readily found in nature, ε andμcannot both be negative. Moreover, the numerical range 
of permittivity is limited, i.e., εr  …3 5, with few exceptions such as water (ε ≈r 80) and titanates. 
Similarly, relative permeability values in the hundreds may be found in ferromagnetic materials. 
The question arises whether we can manufacture materials that have properties tailor-made to our 
requirements with a wide range of permittivity and permeability values, including negative values. 
If this is the case, we need to know what advantages and further options this offers to the EMC 
designer. We have already touched upon these issues in Section 10.1.2. Here, we offer a more sys￾tematic approach for the interested reader.

Material response to external fields generates internal fields (through electric polarization and 
magnetic alignment), thus establishing a total field inside the material, which is the combination of 
the externally imposed and internally generated fields. This process is captured by the two param￾eters ε and μ. In principle, we can construct a new artificial material where we replace and/or supple￾ment the electric and magnetic dipoles naturally occurring through atomic processes, by a periodic 
structure where each unit cell consists of small capacitors, inductors, and other lumped circuit ele￾ments. As long as each cell is small in physical size (relative to the wavelength), we can view this as 
a homogenous material and we can expect a homogenized response much like from conventional,
naturally occurring, materials. However, now we are not restricted to the homogenized values of ε
andμfound in nature and, therefore, we can engineer any value, including negative and very small 
values. We call these metamaterials, and in contrast to natural materials where permittivity and per￾meability cannot both be negative, we can now have any desired combination, e.g., both negative, or
only one negative. Frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) have been in use for some time in connection 
with radar work, and there are similarities with what we now term metamaterials. Broadly, FSS are 
planar structures where the interest is in reflection and transmission, while metamaterials are more 
likely volumetric homogenized structures where absorption is important. The idea of materials with 
negative parameters was first explored in Reference 37. Several texts are available with substantial 
coverage of FSS and metamaterials.11,12,36,38–40
The norm in nature is for both ε andμto be positive. Plasma (a highly ionized gas) is an example 
where the permittivity is negative and some gyrotropic magnetic materials have negative perme￾ability. Cases where both ε andμare negative are not found in nature, but can be manufactured 
as mentioned above. Such materials are described as double negative, negative refractive index,
left-handed, or backward materials and have some interesting properties. The phase and group 
velocities point in opposite direction, and the waves are refracted in the opposite side to the normal 
compared to conventional materials. This implies that there are new possibilities in guiding waves 
through such materials, hence the interest in metamaterials and EMC.
We illustrate the principles of propagation in a commonly encountered natural material than of a 
fully ionized gas — a plasma. Matter in this state consists of a large number of free electrons exhib￾iting collective behavior described by the so-called plasma frequency fp. The plasma frequency 
depends on the electric charge, electron mass, and the number density of free electrons. The permit￾tivity of such a medium is frequency dependent and is given by,

as this plasma has the magnetic properties of free space. We note that for propagation at frequen￾cies higher than the plasma frequency, the relative permittivity is less than one and the phase 
velocity is higher than the speed of light. At frequencies lower than fp, the permittivity is negative 
and hence the refractive index is imaginary, η = ε j r . To get a picture of EM propagation under 
these conditions, we consider an electric field of the form = ( ) ω − E E e0 j t kx . Since the phase velocity 
is equal to ω/k, combining with Equation 10.5, we obtain the dispersion relation for propagation 
in a plasma,
ω = ω + k c 2 p

We see therefore that for frequencies above the plasma frequency, the phase velocity is higher than 
c, but the group velocity is lower than the speed of light as required. For frequencies lower than the 
plasma frequency, however, we find from the dispersion relation Equation 10.6 that the wave num￾ber is imaginary, k j = − k . Substituting into the expression for the electric field, we find that under 
such conditions, we get a wave amplitude dependence of the form − e k x, therefore an attenuating 
evanescent wave. An EM wave incident into such a medium with f f < p is totally reflected. The same 
situation applies to other media where the negative quantity is permeability instead of permittivity. 
We only have propagating waves if both ε andμare positive, or both are negative.
We now consider a medium consisting of a periodic structure of long z-directed conducting 
wires as shown in Figure 10.15. The wire spacing in both x- and y-directions is “a”, and the wire 
diameter is 2r0. Following Reference 36, we sketch out how the dielectric permittivity of such a 
medium may be obtained. We consider two imaginary planes at z = 0 and z = d perpendicular to z. 
The potential difference between the two planes may be obtained from the electric field Ez and the 
total inductance of the wire cluster.
V = ωIj L dd z = E d
where I is the polarization current (the current due to the response of the medium inclusions) and Ld
is the wire cluster inductance per unit length. From this expression, we obtain,

Here, the “plasma frequency” essentially describes the response of the wire inclusions and it is a 
function of the wire cluster inductance and therefore of the radius and spacing of the wire inclu￾sions. The relative dielectric constant has the same form as in a natural plasma and by suitable 
choice of the wire parameters can be varied to change the cutoff frequency. Further details of the 
calculation of the inductance and of an example of application of this type of screen in an EMC 
problem can be found in References 36 and 41, respectively.
We have seen how the inclusion of conducting structures and the associated capacitive and induc￾tive behavior (energy storage in electric and magnetic fields) can generate a material response to 
EM fields much like that of a natural material, but with engineered properties which extend sub￾stantially the normal responses found in nature. Provided that the size of inclusions is smaller than 
the wavelength, the response is homogenized and can thus be described by an effective permittivity 
and permeability. We can get a further insight into this process by examining the properties of the 
transmission line segment shown in Figure 10.16a. A conventional TL consists of a series induc￾tance per unit length LR and a shunt capacitance CR, the two components shown in bold outline in 
Figure 10.16a. The subscript R indicates components which contribute to right-hand propagation. 
Also, in this figure we have added a series capacitance CL and shunt inductance LL. We will show 
that these two components contribute to left-hand propagation.42–44 Let us assume first that we have 
a TL with the R-labeled components only. Then the propagation constant is,

The situation for conventional propagation is depicted in the ω–β diagram shown in Figure 10.16b.

This is an example of a backward propagating wave (phase and group velocities in the opposite 
direction), and it is depicted in Figure 10.16c.
The ω–β diagram for the case when all four components are present is shown schematically in 
Figure 10.16d. Here, we have a mix of RH and LH behaviors and characteristic frequencies where 
we move from one to the other. These characteristic frequencies may be adjusted by a suitable 
choice of the RL and LH circuit parameters to fit with the desired propagation properties.
We return now to the example of the basic cell of a high-impedance surface mentioned in Section 
10.1.2 and shown in Figure 10.4. The unit cell consists of three cascaded sections. The first and last 
sections are identical, each representing a transmission line of length d/2 and characteristic imped￾ance ZTL. The middle section consists of a shunt admittance Y representing capacitor C1 in series 
with the parallel combination of L1, C2. The ABCD parameters of the first and third sections are,45

For a number of such unit cells in cascade, we can obtain the elements of the overall transmission

At the frequency where the denominator is zero, the line is shorted and, therefore, we have mini￾mum transmission. The width of this stopband depends on dispersion, thus giving a stop gap (elec￾tronic bandgap, EBG).
In addition to the analytical approach outlined above, a numerical solution to the propagation 
problem is also possible based conveniently on the TLM method, which is in line with the transmis￾sion line character of the configuration studied.46 Adding for generality a resistance R in parallel 
with L1, C2, we can model the energy storage elements in the Y-branch by open- and short-circuit 
stubs as shown in Figure 10.17a. The rationale behind this model is that an open-circuit line empha￾sizes voltage and minimizes current flow, thus modeling electric field energy storage (capacitance), 
and minimizes magnetic field energy storage (modeling error inductance). The reverse holds for a 
short-circuit line that models inductance. Details of this type of modeling may be found in Reference

47. In Figure 10.17a, we also show the incident and reflected voltage pulses at each circuit node. The 
labeling used is as follows: right superscript i and r for incident and reflected voltage pulses, right 
subscript for the particular location of the node nΔx, and left subscript for the instant in time kΔt.
In more detail, there are two segments of a link line of characteristic impedance ZTL and the 
stubs representing the inductance and capacitances have characteristic impedances,47

The time step of the computation (single transit time across one cell) is Δt. The round-trip propa￾gation time in the stubs is also Δt so that there is synchronism across all scattering events during 
computation. Reducing the time step reduces modeling errors (parasitic inductance in the case of 
a capacitor model, and parasitic capacitance in case of inductance models47). The model shown in 
Figure 10.17a may be reduced to its Thevenin equivalent shown in b. The Thevenin sources are 
twice the incident voltage as the open-circuit voltage at the end of a TL doubles. We may further 
simplify the network across the three parallel components using the parallel generator theorem to 
obtain the voltage Vp. We thus obtain Figure 10.17c, where

and across capacitor C2 and inductor L1,

The numerical simulation of propagation on such a line proceeds by first constructing a line with a 
cascade of segments such as that shown in Figure 10.17. An appropriate source and termination are 
then applied at the input and output of the line. The initial conditions are then set for all incident 
voltages (usually zero). The time step and associated space step are set so that the length of each 
segment is smaller than the wavelength. The characteristic impedances of the link and sublines are 
then obtained from the physical parameters of the line and the chosen time step (Equation 10.13). Shielding and Grounding 237
At the first time step, k=1, and for all nodes of the line, the total voltage is obtained from Equations 
(10.14) and (10.15), where the incident voltages are obtained from the chosen initial conditions. In 
order for the calculation to advance to the next time step, we need to obtain the scattered (reflected) 
voltages and, from these, the new incident voltages at time step k=2. The reflected voltage into the 
stub representing C1 is equal to the total voltage minus the incident. This pulse travels toward the 
open-circuit termination and returns with the same sign as the new incident voltage at time k+1,

These pulses become incident at k+1 to the link line segment on the right of unit n−1 and to the left 
of unit n+1. The incident pulse at time k+1 at n are simply the reflected pulses at time k from lines 
to the left (n−1) and to the right (n+1) of n. This process of obtaining the new incident pulses from 
previously reflected pulses is called “connection,” and it depends on the topology of the circuit. 
Any number of features may be accommodated along the propagation path, e.g., junctions, non￾uniformities, and other special features (e.g., bypass capacitors), making this numerical technique 
a general tool for studying propagation problems. Once the new incident voltages are obtained, the 
calculation is advanced to the next time step and so on. The computation gives the response as a 
function of time anywhere along the line.
Using the principles outlined above, TLM may be used to study propagation in media containing 
metamaterials in more than one dimension using full-field simulations.46,48,49
In Section 10.1.2, we mentioned metamaterials as a new development, which offers a wider 
scope to design artificial materials with any desired permittivity and permeability, including nega￾tive refractive index materials. Metamaterials are based on units of small periodic implants, which 
exhibit electric and magnetic dipole responses to incident EM fields. As long as the size of each unit 
is small relative to the wavelength of interest, such materials behave as natural materials described 
by effectiveμand ε (homogenized response). This implies that the tailored electric and magnetic 
properties can only be achieved over a specified frequency range. Broadband responses are possible, 
but more difficult to achieve. In Figure 10.18, we show an electric dipole and a magnetic dipole with 
the current flows in response to an incident EM wave.
Since on the metalization of the electric dipole, the total tangential electric field must be zero,
the induced currents must generate an opposing electric field. Similarly, the induced current flow 
in the magnetic dipole must generate a magnetic field opposing the incident field (Lenz’s law). Both 238 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
these responses make it possible to generate arbitrary values of ε and μ, including negative ones. A 
number of different configurations of the unit cell may be found in the literature,50–52 as shown in 
Figure 10.19.
The objective is to achieve resonances at a certain frequency, or a dual frequency response, or a 
broadband response. Other issues are the effectiveness of the response to different wave polariza￾tions and to oblique wave incidence. As the frequency gets higher and the wavelength smaller, the 
unit cell gets smaller and thus intricate structures are more difficult to manufacture. It is possible to 
achieve most aims by a judicious choice of simple cut-wire (CW) structures as shown in the inset at 
the top of Figure 10.20. Here we have a single CW on top of a substrate exhibiting a typical electric 
dipole response as shown by the reflection and transmission coefficients plotted as a function of 
frequency.53
It also possible to get a magnetic dipole response by using a pair of CWs in the front and back 
of the substrate as shown at the bottom of Figure 10.20. That such an arrangement will exhibit both 
electric and magnetic responses can be seen intuitively by recognizing that different currents will be 
induced on the two parallel CWs. We can resolve these two currents into common and differential 
modes much as we do in a transmission line. The common mode drives the electric and the differ￾ential the magnetic responses. In this example, we have an electric resonance (anti-phase reflection 
coefficient, PEC) and a magnetic resonance (in-phase reflection, PMC).
A schematic of the conditions on a pair of CWs at the electric and magnetic resonances is shown 
in Figure 10.21. On the left of the figure, the electric charge distribution, current flow, and electric 
field are shown, and on the right, an equivalent circuit. The capacitors shunting the inductance of 
the wires represent the coupling to adjacent cells.53,54
We can synthesize material responses with very general properties using multiple CWs. Several 
CWs of unequal length may be used to get multiple resonances or a broadband response. Offset 
CWs may be used to calibrate the relative importance of electric and magnetic responses. CWs may 
be added in orthogonal polarizations to accommodate different field polarizations.53,55,56 A sche￾matic of these two types of cell is shown in Figure 10.22.

An example of the use of metamaterials for modifying the radiation pattern of an antenna placed 
near a PEC, turning the PEC effectively into a PMC, is shown in Figure 10.23.53
The metamaterial employed is shown in the inset and is known as a capacitively loaded loop (CLL). 
The results of a simulation are shown in Figure 10.24, where the ratio of the radiated electric field with 
a metamaterial absorber, to the field with a matched boundary (a), and to the field with a PEC bound￾ary (b) is plotted. Three graphs are shown for three different spacings of the antenna from the bound￾ary. The graphs show an enhancement factor of the order of two as a result of the metamaterial layer.

metamaterial (bottom).240 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The difficulty in modeling such configurations is that we have to account for the fine details of 
the CLL material and also the large electrical size of the structure on which such an antenna may 
be mounted, e.g., on an aircraft. As we have indicated in Section 8.7, direct geometrical mapping 
of all physical details onto a numerical mesh will result in an unrealistically large computation. In 
such cases, the most efficient approach is to model the properties of the metamaterial boundary by 
an equivalent digital filter, thus avoiding the need to map directly CLL geometrical details in the 
large-scale computation. The principles of this techniques are outlined in Figure 10.25, where in 
(a) the details of single CLL cell are shown mapped on a fine grid. A single cell is then modeled to

obtain its scattering properties using the appropriate spatial resolution (∆/n). The large-scale model 
uses a coarser resolution (∆) to reduce the size of computation as shown in Figure 10.25b. In the 
example shown, n = 7, but any n can be used to suit the needs of the problem. The hatching in (b) 
indicates that scattering from this surface is a time-dependent procedure (a digital filter processing 
incoming signals) with the same scattering properties as those obtained from the simulation in (a).57
A combination of unit cells such as those shown in Figures 10.22 and 10.25, or many other shapes,
with a mix of dimensions may be used to obtain multi-frequency, multi-polarization responses to 
FIGURE 10.24 Electric field obtained from the digital filtering technique for matched (top) and PEC (bot￾tom) boundaries. Field ratios are shown for different spacings.242 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
suit particular needs. It is also possible to generate waveform-selective responses to discriminate 
among waveforms, which occupy broadly the same frequency spectrum. This involves the pres￾ence of nonlinear components as part of the unit cell as shown schematically in Figure 10.26. In 
this figure, we see that if a continuous wave is applied, the capacitor remains fully charged and the 
wave propagates. If however a short duration pulse is applied, then the capacitor is charged and then 
the energy in the signal dissipates as the capacitor discharges through the resistor before the next 
pulse arrives. Propagation in this case is impeded. We see therefore that there are many options to 
manipulate propagation to meet specific signal processing demands.56,58
Another area where metamaterials are finding application is in manipulating the interaction 
of EM signal as they impinge on particular objects. Of interest is the topic of invisibility, which 
in the optical range of frequencies simply means that we may cover (cloak) an object by a suit￾able material so that it is invisible to the naked eye. In EMC-related applications, normally, the 
objective is to be able to achieve invisibility in the microwave range of frequencies. In engineer￾ing terms, this means that a cloaked object does not reflect signals toward the source or in any 
other direction. This idea is related to stealth technologies where, however, the emphasis is on 
minimizing reflections toward the source of the EM illumination to avoid detection (a stealth 
object may still be detectable if viewed from a direction other than from the source). In contrast,
invisibility requires that there is no scattering in any direction and no absorption. Conditions are 
such as if the object is not present. There are several techniques for achieving cloaking described 
in the literature.59,60 As an example, we mention here the transmission-line technique where the 
object to be cloaked is covered by a network of transmission lines constructed using metamaterial 
technologies as shown schematically in Figure 10.27. For ideal cloaking, we require that if EM 
radiation impinges on port 0, there is no reflection and energy distributes into the other ports, thus 
bypassing the object.

10.4.2 Nanomaterials
A full appreciation of the properties of nanomaterials can only be gained from a quantum mechani￾cal perspective and therefore is beyond the scope of this text. However, it is desirable that a basic 
phenomenological discussion of properties and relevant applications is given, together with refer￾ences for the interested reader. This is an evolving area of interest for EMC, and further develop￾ments are to be expected in the years to come.
Graphene is a 2D structure made of a single atomic layer of graphite. It has a honeycomb appear￾ance of hexagon carbon rings as depicted in Figure 10.28.
Conduction is determined by the structure of electronic states near the Fermi level (highest occu￾pied electronic state at zero temperature).61,62 An one-dimensional structure in a tube form (diameter 
of the order of 1 or 2 nm) may be achieved by rolling 2D sheets, e.g., connecting points A and AA in 
Figure 10.28. It is possible to achieve a range of cylindrical structures and properties from conduct￾ing to semi-conducting. In a classical material, where electrons behave as particles, the electrical 
conductivity is a material constant. However, as the diameter of the wire gets smaller the wavelike 
nature of electrons begins to dominate and then the electrical conductivity becomes dependent of 
the length. Transport properties range from ballistic, diffusive to classical, depending on the rela￾tive size of the electron mean free path and the conductor length. At the nano-level, the electrical 
conductance is quantized. It changes in steps of 12.9 kΩ−1
. We can also identify a kinetic element 
to the inductance (approx. 16 nH/μm), which is orders of magnitudes larger than the magnetic clas￾sical component.63 There is also a capacitance component of quantum nature (approx. 100 aF/μm), 
which is of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic component.63 The equivalent circuit of 
the nanotube transmission line is as shown in Figure 10.29.64 The resistance of nanotubes tends to 
be large, and in many applications, they are used in parallel bundles to construct efficient intercon￾nects. Further details of transport in nanostructures may be found in Reference 65.

A typical interconnect consisting of two nanowires above ground is shown in Figure 10.30a with 
its circuit equivalent for a segment of length Δx shown in b. Normally, the magnetic component of 
the inductance may be neglected. Simulations using this model can be performed in the normal way 
based on transmission line theory.66
In practical applications, nano-interconnects may be formed by a coaxial system of single-walled 
nanotubes. Heterogeneous structures consisting of Cu and graphene may also be employed to over￾come the very high near fields from nano-interconnects.67 Another issue arises from the high con￾tact resistance of nano-interconnects.68 Graphene-based patterns may be added on substrates as 
shown in Figure 10.31 in a Salisbury screen-type absorber.69
Tunable absorbers are also possible by using a biasing voltage source as shown in Figure 10.32. 
Further details of these and other EMC applications of nanomaterials may be found in References

11 Filtering and Nonlinear 
Protective Devices
Proper design for EMC requires that every effort is made to reduce the generation of electromag￾netic interference and to improve immunity by proper layout and shielding techniques. After all 
reasonable efforts have been expended to address these issues, it may still be necessary to take 
specific measures to influence undesired signal flows by incorporating special circuits in selected 
locations. Examples of such circuits are filters, isolators, clamps, etc. In this chapter the nature and 
application of these circuits is described. Filtering is interpreted in its widest sense, namely, as a 
general signal conditioner that is used to modify a particular attribute of a signal. Thus, in addition 
to conventional filters, components such as common-mode chokes, baluns, isolating transformers, 
opto-isolators, etc., will also be considered.
11.1 POWER-LINE FILTERS
Connection of equipment to a power supply is an almost universal feature and it is the source of 
both emission and susceptibility problems. It is therefore a common remedy to incorporate a power￾line filter at the connection point of the power cable to the equipment cabinet. Filter design is well 
established in connection with communication circuits and many techniques exist to help design 
very sophisticated filters.1 However, the design of EMC filters for power-line application presents 
special problems.
First, filters for EMC applications must work over a very wide frequency range extending to 
1GHz and beyond. This implies that all components used in filter design, including the physical lay￾out of the filter and its connection to the equipment, must be fully characterized over the frequency 
range of interest. The so-called stray components associated with real components were discussed 
in Chapter 3 and are crucial in EMC filter design.
Second, filters on power lines may be subject to high-current pulses of considerable severity, 
causing, potentially, saturation of inductors wound on iron cores and deterioration of other compo￾nents subject to high-energy pulses. These factors can cause reduced performance and long-term 
changes in filter behavior.
Third, components added on power-lines for EMC purposes must not interfere adversely with 
normal safety and power circuit protection arrangements.
Finally, the attenuation introduced by a filter depends on source- and load-side terminating 
impedances and in power circuits these two quantities, in contrast to the case for communication 
networks, are not normally known or entirely specified. This can lead to problems in predicting 
performance and specifying filters.
This list of special requirements for power-line filters is not meant to suggest that they are entirely 
different from other filters. It is simply meant to point out the care required in selecting a filter for 
a particular application. A typical filter consists of a combination of high-quality L and C compo￾nents connected in such a manner as to reflect signals in a certain frequency range. The presence of 
an impedance discontinuity is therefore paramount in the functioning of such filters and it dictates 
their topology. For example, if the impedance at the source- and load-side is high, the configuration 
shown in Figure 11.1a must be chosen since it presents the maximum mismatch at high frequen￾cies. In contrast, if the terminating impedances are low, the configuration shown in Figure 11.1b 
is chosen. Since in many cases these impedances are not known, design is a compromise and it is 
possible that the chosen filter may not in practice offer significant improvement. Another aspect of 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-14250 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
filters that must be apparent from this discussion is that interference signals are simply diverted by 
such filters — this energy is not dissipated — and hence care must be taken that this does not cause 
problems elsewhere. A filter design in which lossy components are added can help dissipate some 
of the energy associated with EMI and also provides some attenuation, irrespective of the value of 
the terminating impedance.2
A typical configuration used for filtering power signals is shown in Figure 11.2a. It consists 
of capacitors from line (L) and neutral (N) wires to the grounding (E) capacitor (Cy), capacitor 
Cx between line and neutral, and the common-mode choke. The function of the capacitors is to 
present a low-impedance path for high-frequency currents. Capacitors Cy and Cx are intended for 
common- and differential-mode signals, respectively. Their selection must meet the required EMC 
specification and also safety regulations. Fairly high values for Cx are allowed (typically of the order 
of a microfarad) while Cy must not allow excessive current flow to ground at power frequencies. 
Depending on the type of equipment and safety requirements, total leakage current to ground must 
not exceed a milliampere or less. This requirement limits the value of Cy to a few thousand pico￾farad. High-quality components must be used for Cx and Cy since their failure may allow a follow￾through current at power frequencies, which has implications for personnel and equipment safety. 
Of particular importance is the design of the common-mode choke. This consists of two identical 
coils wound on an iron core. Each coil has a self-inductance L and the mutual inductance between 
them is M. Since the two coils are closely coupled, the value of M is slightly smaller than L and for 
the ideal case of perfect coupling M=L. The purpose of the choke is to present a high impedance 
to common-mode current and a low impedance to differential-mode current. The voltage Vc across 
the top coil when common-mode currents flow, as shown in Figure 11.2b, is
Vc c = ωj L I + ωj M Ic (11.1)
Hence, the impedance to common-mode currents is jω(L+M) (high) and filtering of these currents 
is effectively due to Cy and L+M. Similarly, for differential-mode currents the voltage Vd across the 
top coil shown in Figure 11.2c is
Vd d = ωj L I − ωj M Id (11.2)
Hence, the impedance to differential-mode currents is jω(L – M) (low) and filtering of these cur￾rents is effectively due to 2Cx and L – M. The power frequency currents are mainly differential 
mode and the flux they produce in the iron core is very small, thus minimizing saturation problems. 
This simple analysis neglects factors such as the parasitic capacitance across the choke, which 
are important at high frequencies. A discussion of these effects may be found in Reference 3. The 
design of the iron core is described in Reference 4. The basic configuration shown in Figure 11.2a 
may be modified to implement other filter topologies. As an example, additional capacitors may be 
incorporated on the other side of the choke to establish a filter similar to that shown in Figure 11.1a. 
FIGURE 11.1 Optimum filter topology for (a) high- and (b) low-impedance networks.Filtering and Nonlinear Protective Devices 251
Filters for three- phase power supplies may be designed following the same principles with a com￾mon-mode choke formed by winding the three lines and neutral on a common core. Filters where 
the required attenuation is larger than a few tens of decibels should be constructed inside metal 
enclosures and care must be taken to minimize stray components (short leads, minimization of 
capacitive coupling, individual shielded compartments for filter sections). Grounding connections 
must be checked for continuity and low impedance, especially when ready-made units with painted 
surfaces are installed. In systems with several supplies, such as switched-mode power supplies, 
it is probably best to provide some filtering as closely as possible to the source of interference in 
order to restrict the propagation paths of interfering signals and to allow scope for modular design. 
Ultimately, issues of cost, flexibility, and interchangeability determine the overall filtering strategy 
to be employed.
Example: Common-mode conducted emissions from a single-phase power electronic load are to 
be reduced using a common-mode choke. The Thevenin equivalent of the circuit driving com￾mon-mode currents at frequency f=3MHz consists of a voltage source VCM in series with a stray 
capacitance C (100 pF). The CM voltage is measured across an LISN (section 14.2.5), which 
effectively presents a resistance of 50 Ω between live to ground and neutral to ground. The choke 
parameters are

Solution: We repeat the CM choke circuit in Figure 11.3. At these frequencies the inductors on 
the live and neutral branches appear as in Figure 11.4a with the CM current as shown and the

Hence, the equivalent circuit to CM currents is as shown in Figure 11.4b. The complete circuit 
with the LISN and the driving source included is shown in Figure 11.5a. The required component

11.2 ISOLATION
Isolators are used to prevent, as far as possible, the flow of common-mode currents while the flow of 
differential-mode currents remains unaffected. The common-mode choke described in the previous 
section provides a certain degree of isolation and can be simply used whenever necessary, by wind￾ing signal cables, including coaxial cables, on a magnetic core. Other isolating devices are also used 
FIGURE 11.3 Schematic of a single-phase power line filter.
FIGURE 11.4 Common-mode current flow (a) and electrical equivalent (b).Filtering and Nonlinear Protective Devices 253
extensively in signal conditioning. These are isolating transformers, opto-couplers, and fiber-optic 
links, and these are briefly described below.
An isolating transformer is shown schematically in Figure 11.6a. Typically, the two coils are 
wound on an iron core and the capacitance C shown is the stray capacitance between the coils. 
Any voltage difference between the two grounding points shown will cause EMI to appear across 
the two coils, except if C is zero or the magnetic coupling between the two coils is perfect. These 
conclusions may be confirmed by using an analysis similar to that employed for the common-mode 
choke. Perfect isolation at high frequencies is difficult to achieve. The stray capacitance C may be 
reduced considerably by providing complete individual shields for the two coils and the core.
Opto-isolators are devices used to convert electrical to optical signals, which can then be trans￾mitted without EMI. A typical configuration is shown in Figure 11.6b. It is clear that any stray 
capacitance C between the two circuits of the optical devices may cause the same problems as 
described earlier. Although these capacitances are small, in the fraction of a picofarad range, they 
may nevertheless contribute to loss of isolation.5 Any other incidental wiring placed in the proxim￾ity of the opto-coupler may also contribute to C and thus the layout of the entire circuit must be 
carefully studied. The electrical circuit on both sides of the opto-coupler must also be designed with 
FIGURE 11.5 Complete system comprising of LISN, filter, and common-mode source (a), and subsequent 
circuit reduction (b) and (c).254 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
EMC considerations in mind, as any EMI introduced there may be converted to an optical signal 
and thus transmitted further.
Optical fiber links use an optical signal transmitted through a fiber and in principle are similar 
to opto-couplers, with the important extra feature that optical transmission over longer distances 
is possible. The same electrical considerations as regards EMC design apply, and it should also be 
pointed out that for both types of optical link it is only practical to transmit low-power-level signals.
11.3 BALANCING
A two-conductor circuit is described as balanced if both conductors and all components connected 
to them have the same impedance with respect to ground and all other nearby conductors.3 A bal￾anced circuit tends to provide some immunity to common-mode currents and it is therefore desir￾able. A typical example of an unbalanced circuit is the antenna feed through a coaxial cable shown 
in Figure 11.7a. Although the dipole is perfectly symmetrical, the feed cable is strongly asymmetri￾cal with respect to ground and other objects. Under these circumstances the normal distribution of 
currents in the coaxial cable (current on inner conductor returning along the inside surface of the 
outer conductor) is disturbed and an additional current flows on the outer surface of the outer con￾ductor. The total current on the coaxial cable differs from zero by the current flowing on the outside 
surface (common-mode current). The cable therefore radiates and the two halves of the dipole do not 
carry symmetrical currents. The common-mode signal may be reduced by using techniques similar 
FIGURE 11.6 Isolation provided by a transformer (a) and an opto-isolator (b).
FIGURE 11.7 An unbalanced antenna feed (a) and an improved arrangement using a balun (b).Filtering and Nonlinear Protective Devices 255
to those described in Section 11.1, namely, by winding part of the coaxial cable on a ferrite core, or 
by introducing ferrite clamps along the length of the cable. At high frequencies balancing of circuits 
such as the one shown in Figure 11.7a can be done by a special component known as a “balun” 
(BALanced UNbalanced), intended to connect a balanced system (dipole) to an unbalanced system 
(coaxial cable). An arrangement known as the quarter-wavelength balun is shown in Figure 11.7b. 
The essence of this design is that a sleeve of length λ/4 is added as shown, thus forming a coaxial 
transmission line with the shield of the original coaxial cable. The input impedance to this line, as 
seen across AB, is that corresponding to a line λ/4 long with the far end shorted and it is therefore 
very large (Equation 3.30). Current flow is thus minimized on the outside coaxial line. This balun 
works well at a frequency having a quarter wavelength equal to the sleeve length. A number of other 
balun designs are available with improved characteristics to cope with various situations.6
11.4 SIGNAL-LINE FILTERS
Filtering on signal lines is a well-established technique and may be used to improve EMC when 
the spectrum of the EMI and the intentional signal are sufficiently separated. The design of fil￾ters is usually of the LC type and is well described in standard literature.1 Automated and simpli￾fied design procedures are also available to ease calculations.7 Signal-line filters operate over a 
very wide frequency range and care must be taken to place designs inside conducting enclosures, 
with separate compartments for each section, communicating through barriers by good-quality 
feedthrough capacitors.
In addition to normal EMC requirements, it is necessary to provide additional isolation in cer￾tain communication systems to prevent unauthorized users from picking up signals emitted from 
badly screened and filtered equipment. This requirement is known by the codeword TEMPEST and 
although not strictly an EMC problem it nevertheless has considerable impact on EMC. TEMPEST 
requirements cover a very wide frequency range and thus demand high-quality shields and filtering 
of all power, control, and signal lines to reduce emissions to very low levels. In highsecurity mili￾tary systems, very low electromagnetic emission must be maintained from all circuits and associ￾ated equipment carrying signals prior to encryption.
11.5 NONLINEAR PROTECTIVE DEVICES
Normal filtering arrangements as described in the previous sections cannot cope with severe 
electromagnetic threats, such as large overvoltages in the form of short pulses due to lightning, 
severe faults in power systems, or nuclear-generated EMP. In such cases additional components are 
required, intended to reduce the severity of the disturbance by clipping its amplitude, dissipating 
some of the energy, etc. These devices are invariably nonlinear so that under normal conditions 
signals are not affected. In contrast, to an abnormal pulse, the nonlinear component presents a high 
impedance if connected in series or a low impedance if it is a shunt connection. The simplest such 
component is a crowbar connected in parallel to the component to be protected, with the property 
that for voltages below a certain value V0 the impedance of the crowbar is infinite, whereas when 
V>V0 a current flows through the crowbar and the voltage across it is maintained at a value V0 or 
smaller. In its simplest form, a crowbar may be a pair of sharp-pointed electrodes in close proxim￾ity to each other so that when V>V0 breakdown takes place across the gap between the electrodes 
holding the potential difference to a low value corresponding to the arcing voltage. In practice, other 
components, such as nonlinear resistors, are connected in series to the gap to control the voltage￾current characteristic during arcing. Such devices, especially those installed in power circuits, must 
be capable of self-healing, i.e., of interrupting the flow of power-frequency currents after the elec￾tromagnetic disturbance has ceased. In addition, it must be recognized that a sudden uncontrolled 
collapse of voltage due to the operation of such a device may generate its own interference, which, 
on occasion, may be more severe than that due to the original disturbance.256 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Thus, selection and application of protective devices must be done recognizing the problems 
that they may themselves generate. It is imperative that protective devices such as voltage clamps or 
crowbars are placed as closely as possible to the equipment to be protected. The rationale for this 
advice may be seen by examining the conditions on the system shown in Figure 11.8a. A pulse with 
a rate of rise of voltage equal to (a) travels along a transmission line O A B toward a device at B pro￾tected by a crowbar placed at A, a distance l from B, and set to operate at a voltage V0. The propaga￾tion time from A to B is τ=l/u where u is the propagation velocity along the line. It is assumed for 
simplicity that the impedance of the device is much larger than the characteristic impedance of the 
line, so that pulses incident at B are reflected with the same sign. The total voltage at A is the sum 
of the original incident pulse (dV/dt=a) plus an identical pulse due to the reflection from B arriving 
after time 2τ. The crowbar operates after time 2τ+t from the arrival of the pulse at A, as shown in 
Figure 11.8b, i.e., when
V0 = τ a 2( ) + = at 2a ( ) τ + t (11.3)
The firing of the protective device will be felt at B at time (2τ+t)+τ, when the pulse has been 
applied at B for a time interval (2τ+t)+τ−τ=2τ+t.
Hence the voltage at B across the device will have reached the value VB =2a(2τ+t) before the 
influence of the protective device was felt there. From this formula it is clear that VB depends 
FIGURE 11.8 Circuit with a nonlinear protective device (a) and calculation of the voltage at A (b).Filtering and Nonlinear Protective Devices 257
strongly on l since τ=l/u. If, as an example, a=100 V/nsec, l=0.3m, u=3×108m/s, and V0=250V, 
the time interval t may be calculated from Equation 11.3 and is equal to 0.25 nsec. Hence
V 2 100 2 0.25 450 B = × ( ) + =  V
This calculation shows that much higher voltages will develop across the protected device than 
those suggested by the firing voltage of the protective clamp. In practice there are additional delays 
in the operation of the protective device that have not been accounted for in this simple calculation.
A schematic diagram of an arrangement that can be used in association with the filter of 
Figure 11.2a is shown in Figure 11.9. The general philosophy of this circuit is that series components 
are used to slow down and dissipate some of the energy of fast pulses; nonlinear resistors (varis￾tors) and gas discharge tubes are employed to limit overvoltages; and any remaining pulse energy 
is handled by solid-state devices (diodes), which although fast in operation cannot handle large 
amounts of energy. The remaining undesirable signals may then be dealt with by normal filtering.
A voltage crowbar cannot be used on its own to protect sensitive circuits and it is normally nec￾essary to control the shape and level of the voltage across the protective device after firing. This 
is best done by a combination of components such as the gas discharge tube and nonlinear resistor 
shown in Figure 11.9. This combination is referred to as a voltage clamp in that a more controlled 
operation is achieved. All protective devices have an inherent operational delay and hence opera￾tion is dependent on the rate of rise of the disturbance. The advantage of spark gaps is that they 
can conduct large currents. They are, however, slow in operation. Advanced fast-operating designs 
have been produced that are suitable for EMP protection.8 Solid-state devices such as thyristors may 
also be used as crowbar devices. Varistors (voltage-dependent resistors) of various kinds are avail￾able with fast operation and large current-handling capability and these can be used in isolation or 
in combination with other components for protection. The voltage current characteristic of these 
devices is of the form I=kvα where α is of the order of 30.
Avalanche and zener diodes may be used to clip fast voltage pulses but it must be remembered 
that their current handling capability is limited. A comprehensive treatment of various nonlinear 
devices used for overvoltage protection may be found in Reference 9.
FIGURE 11.9 A voltage-clamping circuit for severe electromagnetic threats.258 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
An issue of great practical significance, and which is difficult to address in a satisfactory way, 
is the survivability and deterioration of protective components in service. All components used to 
ensure EMC may at some stage be damaged but this is particularly relevant to front-line components 
such as the nonlinear protective devices described in this section. The difficulty is that it may not 
always be apparent that a particular component has failed in service and that it may need replace￾ment. It is also the case that the performance characteristics of a particular component may change 
due to aging and/or the passage of several high-energy pulses through it. Although allowance may 
be made for aging and statistical variations, it is difficult to assess changes in characteristics due to 
voltage clamping operations since their frequency of occurrence is unknown. It is well known that 
the repeated passage of high-energy pulses through a varistor modifies its voltage-current charac￾teristic. The general trend is for the voltage across the varistor at a fixed current to increase after 
exposure to large surges. For this reason some authors recommend that, in order to provide a safety 
margin, the value of α used in calculations for highly exposed circuits should be chosen to be equal 
to 4.9 In any case, for a properly specified system some attempt must be made to assess and provide 
for aging and deterioration in component characteristics. The amount of protection necessary for 
each circuit is dependent on perceived risks, importance of maintaining operation, and costs.
The circuit shown in Figure 11.9 is suitable as the front end of a powerline filter. For signal lines 
used in control, instrumentation, and communications, various adaptations of this arrangement are 
used. As an illustration, arrangements suitable for protecting a balanced line and a general-purpose 
communication line are shown in Figure 11.10, a and b, respectively. In Figure 11.10a, the series 
components are typically resistors a few ohm in value and a three-electrode discharge tube is used 
as the front-line device. In Figure 11.10b component LA is typically a spark gap or low-voltage

lightning arrester type to provide the first line of defence in hostile environments. The breakdown 
voltage of the diodes is selected to be above normal signal levels. A wide range of protective devices 
is produced commercially incorporating in a single package several components. Further details 
may be found in various technical publications and manufacturers’ literature.10,11
An interference problem with many similarities to EMC is the electrostatic discharge (ESD). 
Charge transfer takes place during contact and subsequent separation between different objects 
(triboelectricity).3 When a person is charged up to high potential and subsequently comes into con￾tact with a circuit or other object at a different potential, a rapid charge transfer takes place causing 
conducted and radiated interference. The basic feature of ESD is relatively low energy but very short 
rise-time. Normal protective measures for EMC, like shielding and grounding, offer some protec￾tion for the effects of ESD. Difficulties caused by handling circuit inputs by persons who are likely 
to be electrically charged may be overcome by connecting across the input to be protected capaci￾tors, varistors, or avalanche diodes. Naturally, any measure that may be taken to prevent electric 
charging of persons or equipment in the first place (e.g., humidity control of rooms, conductivity 
control of working surfaces, and discharge paths through grounding straps) will help significantly 
to reduce ESD problems.
A schematic diagram of grounding, filtering, and protective arrangements that may be found in 
a typical installation is shown in Figure 11.11.

12 General EMC Design Principles
In previous chapters, concepts underlying EMC and special techniques to characterize and control 
emissions, penetration, and coupling were described. Presentation of this material has inevitably 
resulted in the identification of good practices in EMC design. In this chapter it is not intended to 
repeat this material or to provide the reader with ready-made recipes for EMC design. The sole 
intention is to point designers in the right direction and help them establish a sound first design that 
can then be optimized to meet specific objectives. The opportunity will also be taken to address 
certain issues and techniques that did not fit comfortably with the theme of previous chapters.
Before embarking on more detailed aspects of design it is worth stressing from the very begin￾ning the need to take a global, comprehensive, view of EMC. Design activity must be organized 
based on the understanding that all aspects, including mechanical and physical, have, potentially, 
an impact on EMC. Persons responsible for EMC must have access to and influence on all engi￾neering activities—not simply electrical/ electronic—from a very early stage and throughout the 
design and lifetime of a product. In order to impose some organization on this very broad activ￾ity, material in this chapter is presented under four subheadings dealing in turn with reduction 
of emissions at source, reduction of the number and efficiency of coupling paths, reduction of 
susceptibility, and, therefore, the construction of equipment that is more immune to EMC, and 
finally the management of EMC.
12.1 REDUCTION OF EMISSION AT SOURCE
Whenever possible, it always makes sense to endeavor to reduce the generation of interference at 
source. There are some electromagnetic threats, such as lightning, that are statistical events with a 
severity totally beyond the control of the designer. In contrast, interference generated within a sys￾tem can be affected by design and a compromise can be reached that represents a balance between 
operational and EMC requirements. The task of reducing emissions at source must not be over￾looked, as the majority of EMC problems are system generated and not externally induced. The 
single most important advice to reduce emissions in digital circuits is to limit the frequency and 
rise-time of signals to levels necessary to perform the intended function. The question must be 
asked: is such a high frequency necessary, or does the rise-time of a pulse need to be so short? 
Energy is conducted and radiated more effectively at high frequencies and the shorter the rise-time 
or the higher the repetition frequency, the more energy is present at high frequencies capable of 
causing undesirable interference. A high pulse repetition frequency is desirable in power electronic 
circuits to increase efficiency and reduce the weight of magnetic circuits. Against these benefits, 
the inevitable EMC problems must be weighed that lead to increases in costs and weight if shield￾ing material needs to be provided. Results reported from a DC-to-DC converter design have shown 
interference from harmonics up to 490MHz.1 Results from the design of a pwm AC variable-speed 
motor drive are reported in Reference 2.
In digital clock circuits, emissions in excess of the 100th harmonic are not unknown. It is gener￾ally advisable to use the slowest logic family consistent with meeting operational objectives.
As mentioned before, arcing across electromechanical switches in inductive loads presents a 
rich source of interference and it is always worthwhile to provide some means of suppression. The 
general approach to such problems is to provide a combination of a capacitor and a flywheel diode in 
series with a resistor, connected in such a way as to provide an alternative path for the energy stored 
in the inductance at the instant of switching. Details of suitable designs may be found in specialist 
power electronics texts.3 Other electromechanical components such as rotating machines, especially 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-15262 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
those with commutators and brushes, are likely to generate interference due to arcing at the brushes. 
The severity of interference is dependent on the eccentricity of the commutator and bearings, 
and the pressure on the brushes. Electrostatic discharges may also occur between moving parts 
(e.g., inner/outer cases of ball bearings). Although careful maintenance will minimize such 
problems, it is advisable to consider brushless motors in demanding applications.
12.2 REDUCTION OF COUPLING PATHS
Under this broad heading, problems associated with the choice of operating frequency and pulse 
rise-times, reflection and matching, ground paths, component placement and segregation, and cable 
routing in general will be addressed.
12.1.1  Operating Frequency and Rise-Time
In choosing the operating frequency of circuits, operational requirements are predominant. From 
the EMC point of view, however, the operating frequency and, more generally, the rate of change of 
voltage and current have serious implications for coupling and shielding. Coupling can take place 
through shared conducting paths, capacitive and inductive near-field effects, and radiation.
Even the most carefully designed circuit will have some shared path with some inductance L 
and hence coupling through terms such as L di/dt will cause interference, especially at high rates 
of change of current. Elimination of shared paths and minimization of their inductance is there￾fore increasingly important as di/dt rises. Capacitive and inductive coupling are represented by 
terms of the type C dv/dt and dΦ/dt, respectively. High rates of change make this type of coupling 
more important and call for careful design to minimize such coupling. Radiative coupling becomes 
important when the physical length of connections becomes comparable to the wavelength. An 
estimate of the wavelength of radiation corresponding to a pulse of rise-time τr
 is λ = uTr
 where u is 
the speed of propagation (typically 2/3 or the speed of light for propagation in a PCB). Higher fre￾quencies and rates of rise thus call for more compact designs. Small holes and gaps in shielding also 
become efficient paths for penetration of radiation when their largest physical dimension becomes 
comparable to the wavelength. It should be remembered that in the case of pulse waveforms typi￾cal of electronic power supplies and digital circuits, it is not only the fundamental frequency that 
matters but also its harmonics. In the case of power supplies, harmonics up to several megahertz 
should be expected, whereas for electronic circuits, depending on the clock frequency, harmonics 
into the gigahertz (i.e., 30th harmonic and beyond) range are possible. It must therefore be apparent 
that the designer should choose the lowest possible operating frequency and longest pulse rise time 
consistent with meeting operational requirements. Similarly, the smallest possible change in voltage 
and current during switching reduces coupling effects and must be sought, provided that it does not 
compromise other operational requirements or circuit immunity to externally generated interfer￾ence. The characteristics of some common logic families are listed in Table 12.1 and can be used to 
assess their suitability for different applications.

In systems where several frequencies are employed, it is a good practice to select these frequen￾cies so that their values and those of their harmonics are sufficiently different from each other to 
avoid additive interference effects at certain frequencies. In practice, this implies that across the 
entire frequency range of interest, contributions from individual radiators must not be closer than 
the bandwidth of any likely victim system or test receiver. Particular care must be taken in the 
design of circuits operating with fast clock frequencies. The absence of high frequencies does not, 
however, guarantee EMC. In fact, very-low-frequency magnetic fields are very difficult to shield 
and hence a comprehensive look across the entire frequency spectrum must be taken.
A measure used to alleviate some of the problems caused by fast pulses is the placement of 
bypass or decoupling capacitors. The pulsed nature of the current drawn from power supplies dur￾ing fast logic circuit transitions can cause large inductive voltage drops on supply rails and hence 
shared path interference, and also radiation if these essentially high-frequency currents are allowed 
to flow on substantial track lengths. A capacitor placed between the supply rails, at the nearest pos￾sible location to the component generating fast pulses, provides a reservoir of energy to cope with 
sudden current demands and a low-impedance path to high- frequency currents that do not now 
have to circulate around large areas of the board. It is imperative that the inherent inductance of 
these capacitors is very small and that the inductance of capacitor leads and any other connections 
is small so that the resonance frequency of each component and its connections is above the highest 
frequency in which substantial pulse energy is present. As this frequency may be in the gigahertz 
range, high-frequency capacitors, preferably in a surface-mounted package, connected as closely as 
possible to the component generating fast pulses, should be used. Such decoupling capacitors should 
certainly be placed near fast components and also elsewhere to avoid the spread of high-frequency 
current around the entire circuit.
The required capacitance may be estimated from the expression i = C dv/dt where i is the cur￾rent required during the switching of the gate (typically tens of milliamperes), dt is the duration of 
the transition (typically several nanoseconds), and dv is the change in voltage that can be tolerated 
(typically 100mV). In practice values of capacitance in the range 500 to 3000 pF are used. There 
is no merit in using too large values of a capacitance as it inevitably decreases the resonance fre￾quency of the decoupling arrangement. Whenever possible, simultaneous switching of several gates 
should be avoided since this increases the peak high- frequency current demanded from supplies 
and thus impacts on EMC.
12.2.2  Reflections and Matching
Whenever the rise-time of a pulse τr
 is comparable to the transit time τ between two ends of a 
line, reflections and so-called transmission-line effects should be taken into account during design.4
Depending on the geometry and material properties of the PCB the transit time is typically 2 n sec 
for propagation along a line 30cm long. Transmission line effects are thus important for all logic 
families and especially those like ECL with very fast transitions. Reflections at line terminations 
may cause incorrect switching if they exceed the noise margin and also may cause interference 
through radiation. Reflections may be avoided if the transmission lines are matched, i.e., if they are 
terminated at the load and source ends by their own characteristic impedance. This implies that all 
transmission lines, including those using tracks on a PCB, are constructed in such a way that they 
have a well-defined characteristic impedance that is the same as the input and output impedance 
of circuits connected at their load and source ends, respectively. Microstrip-line-type construction, 
as used in high-frequency applications, should be used in circuit boards containing fast logic. The 
output and input impedance of logic gates vary widely between different families and also during 
transitions, typical values being of the order of tens of ohm and hundreds of ohm, respectively. 
Adding components across the load and in series with the source may adjust these values for better 
matching. The characteristic impedance of lines used in printed circuit boards is in the range 50 
to 100 Ω for ECL and TTL logic gates, respectively. Some assessment of transmission-line effects 264 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
should be made whenever τr
.<10 τ, i.e., for fast logic and/or long transmission lines. It is in general 
a good practice to terminate and if possible match all lines and to connect unused inputs of gates to 
the supply or ground as appropriate.
12.2.3  Ground Paths and Ground Planes
The single most important advice regarding ground paths is to recognize that, just as the details of 
connections at the high-potential part of signal lines are important to the operation of the circuit, so 
is the exact configuration of ground paths crucial to EMC. No discussion of any significance regard￾ing ground effects on EMC can take place if all that the designer has to consider is a circuit draw￾ing showing connections to “ground” in a schematic form. It is the responsibility of the designer to 
identify the complete current loop and thus to identify shared paths between different circuits and 
the scope for radiative coupling. Automatic PCB-routing CAD packages do not normally account 
for such effects. Shared paths between different circuits should be avoided, if possible, by proper 
design and placement. This is particularly important for sensitive circuits susceptible to interference 
and circuits that are known to generate substantial high-frequency currents. If complete elimination 
of shared paths is not possible, then the minimization of the impedance (not only the resistance) of 
these paths should be sought. This inevitably leads to the use of a substantial grounding structure 
in the form of wide strips, wire grids, or a complete ground plane, made out of copper, to form 
the ground connection. Whenever a complete ground plane is not necessary for technical and cost 
reasons and wire tracks are used for grounding, the temptation to economize on pin connections by 
using a single track as ground should be resisted, as it inevitably leads to shared paths and large-area 
ground loops that cause interference to spread and couple to other systems.
The presence of the ground plane makes a significant reduction to emission. This can be sim￾ply understood if a system consisting of a two-wire line above a ground plane is considered. The 
common-mode current Ic flowing in the two conductor line is, approximately, electromagnetically 
equivalent to a current Ic flowing on a single conductor above the ground plane. This system is in 
turn equivalent to the original conductor (current Ic) and its image conductor (current –Ic). Provided 
that the height above the ground plane is small, the emitted field is substantially reduced since the 
two opposing currents tend to cancel each other. A restricted ground plane is also effective in reduc￾ing emissions provided its width is larger than a tenth of the wavelength and the transmission line is 
not too near its edge.5 Ground planes also have a partial shielding effect that contributes to higher 
immunity. As mentioned before, the long-term integrity of ground connections must be ensured by 
design and appropriate maintenance and inspection procedures.
12.2.4  Circuit Segregation and Placement
EMC design involves control of all electronic subcircuits, power supplies, interconnections, electro￾mechanical components, and constructional details of a product. Only a broad EMC overview will 
ensure that the procedures adopted are consistent with the requirements of EMC. Conflicts between 
physical constructional details, which affect mechanical strength, appearance, and cost, and those 
regarding shielding, which affect EMC, should be resolved early on in the design, together with 
basic input/output and grounding arrangements. In regard to the manner of electronic construction, 
modularity is the norm. However, the minimum number of printed circuit boards should be used 
to avoid long connections between different boards. Careful thought must be given to external 
connections to a PCB. These should be the minimum number possible, should transmit the slow￾est signals possible, and pass the minimum amount of current necessary. These general principles 
imply that using the same clock between two boards is undesirable since a very fast signal must not 
be allowed to propagate long distances. Similarly, transmitting a signal between boards to drive a 
large number of gates is undesirable since this normally requires large currents. Some form of buff￾ering can substantially reduce the magnitude of these currents. If there are unavoidable external General EMC Design Principles 265
connections, these should be shielded to reduce interference. The significance of the ground plane 
has already been emphasized.
In designs that contain analogue, digital, and input/output circuits on the same board it is advis￾able to provide separate ground planes so that control of shared paths is easier to exercise. These 
ground planes can be connected together at a location chosen to minimize interference. Grounded 
tracks may also be used between signal tracks to reduce coupling. The actual location of subcircuits 
in a board is a matter of some complexity, as it is affected by the general design philosophy and 
function of the circuit. In a well-partitioned system with identifiable interfaces, it is much easier to 
control interference. Circuits that generate fast signals (e.g., clocks, read/write) must be designed and 
placed in such a way as to minimize the length of connections. If fast signals are passed through 
connectors to other boards it is inevitable that the relevant circuits are placed near the connectors. 
However, it is best if fast signals are kept in the same board, in which case the relevant circuits 
should be placed centrally on the board with increasingly slower circuits constructed around the cen￾ter. It is normally necessary for the designer to determine manually the route of critical circuits and 
grounding, before autorouting CAD packages are allowed to do the rest. Attention must be paid to 
connections adjacent to pins carrying fast signals. Some provision for placing suppressors (ferrites, 
capacitors) to the affected pins should be made at the design stage in case it is found to be necessary 
after testing the entire design. Circuits with different characteristics should be kept separate and the 
temptation to economize by using gates on the same package to service different circuits should be 
resisted. In high-performance boards, surface- mounted components and packages should be used 
to reduce emission and coupling from long wire connections. It should also be borne in mind that 
the EMC performance of nominally equivalent packages from different manufacturers can be quite 
different and therefore the design must have enough margin to cope with expected variability.
Advanced designs use multilayer board technology to increase component density and improve 
EMC performance.6,7 A typical arrangement is to use a sandwich of different layers containing 
circuits-dielectric-voltage, supply plane-dielectric-ground, and plane-dielectric-circuits. In other 
designs a layer containing circuits is placed between dielectric layers and the voltage supply and 
ground planes. This arrangement considerably improves emission and immunity. The solution to be 
adopted depends on operational, EMC, and cost constraints and can only be arrived at after careful 
examination of alternatives.
Some basic PCB design guidelines for a better layout to improve EMC can be found in Reference 8.
12.2.5  Cable Routing
Cable positioning must be specified during design to avoid situations where cables are forced to 
occupy convenient gaps without regard to potential EMC problems. The basic principle of avoiding 
the transmission of fast signals over long distances still applies. Every effort must be made to reduce 
the necessary bandwidth to the lowest possible value. Cables must be classified according to their 
potential for causing or receiving interference signals. They must then be placed sufficiently apart 
from each other (several wire diameters) or in separate trunking to reduce coupling. Filtered and unfil￾tered portions of cables must not be placed close to each other or in the same trunking to avoid direct 
coupling and by-passing of the filters. In general, cables and trunking must be regarded as extensions 
of the equipment and the same principles regarding shielding and grounding must be applied.
12.3 IMPROVEMENTS IN IMMUNITY
A system operates satisfactorily if by careful design the level of interference (interference con￾trol level) is less than the level likely to cause an upset (susceptibility design level) by a safety 
margin as shown in Figure 12.1. Naturally, establishing these levels and an adequate margin is 
a difficult task that can only be accomplished by a combination of experimentation, simulation, 
and design experience.266 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Many of the measures discussed earlier in connection with emission have, on the whole, a ben￾eficial impact on immunity. It does not follow, however, that equipment with low emission is also 
immune to external interference. If, for example, low emission has been achieved by good shielding, 
it may follow that immunity will also be high. If, in contrast, low emission is the result of using 
low threshold logic, this does not necessarily offer any guarantee that immunity will be high. In 
achieving immunity from externally generated transients, proper grounding, filtering and nonlinear 
devices should be used at interfaces. The bandwidth of such circuits should be reduced to the mini￾mum required by adding, if need be, simple R-C filters. The degree of immunity required depends 
on the application. Safety-critical and military systems are designed to a very high standard and are 
hardened to cope with very hostile environments.
A useful parameter in digital design is the “noise immunity” of components. The so-called DC 
noise margin is the difference in voltage between the worst-case output of a device and the input 
voltage required by the driven device to recognize correctly a logic state. For the case of TTL logic, 
the worst-case output is 2.4V (high) and 0.4V (low). Inputs interpret voltages below 0.8V as low 
and above 2V as high. Hence the DC noise margin for this logic family is 0.4V. Data for other 
logic families are shown in Table 12.1. These are conservative limits and short-duration pulses or 
high-frequency signals may require somewhat higher voltages to cause upsets.1 Information on the 
dynamic noise margin of various logic families showing the required duration vs. amplitude may be 
found in manufacturers’ literature.9 Logic families and protective devices must be selected accord￾ing to the requirements of the application and the nature of the EM environment.
The techniques for enhancing immunity described above form the standard response of the 
designer to meeting an EMC specification and producing a well-engineered product. There are, 
however, specialist techniques that can be used, if necessary, to deal with particular problems and 
to enhance immunity even further. Two such methods, immunity by software design and spread 
spectrum, are described below.
12.3.1  Immunity by Software Design
Irrespective of the amount of care taken in the design of equipment, it must be accepted that under 
exceptional circumstances sufficient electromagnetic energy will penetrate to affect equipment 
operation adversely. It is the task of the designer to consider how best to deal with this situation 
in order to reduce malfunctions and damage. In computer-based equipment, the risk of upsetting 
program flow and causing the program to enter into interminable loops must be assessed and ways 
found for normal operation to be reestablished. A way of achieving this is by means of the so-called 
watchdog circuits.10 This method consists of requiring the processor to execute a specific opera￾tion regularly. A dedicated timer seeks the outcome of this operation and if one is not forthcoming 
within a specified time period (normally a fraction of a second), it generates a reset to restart normal 
FIGURE 12.1 Safety margin in EMC design.General EMC Design Principles 267
processor operation. Naturally, not all conceivable difficulties can be handled in this way and addi￾tional procedures must be implemented to trap errors and initiate recovery strategies. Examples of 
simple checks that can be useful in this respect are examining input data from sensors to check that 
they are in the correct range, inquiring about the same set of data several times to avoid acting on 
data corrupted by transient interference, reading and writing data into memory to check that they 
are the same, etc.
The integrity of data transmitted over a communication channel may be established in various 
ways. In slow operations, it is possible to confirm that a message is correctly received by requiring 
that it is echoed back for comparison with that originally dispatched. Systematic procedures are 
also available to check errors in the transmission of digital data over fast communication channels. 
These aim at error detection and, if possible, error correction. A common technique is parity check 
where one bit, the so called parity bit, is attached at the end of a group of bits so that the total num￾ber of those in the message is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). A deviation from the chosen 
parity of the transmission indicates an error and a request for a retransmission of the message is 
initiated. Another version of this scheme is to use a parity bit for a group of characters in what is 
known as a longitudinal redundancy check to distinguish from the previous case, which is referred 
to as a vertical redundancy check. More sophisticated techniques are available, such as the cyclic 
redundancy check (CRC), which offer limited error correction capability.11
Most conventional schemes for dealing with error correction assume random errors (e.g., white 
noise) affecting the system. These are referred to as “random error correcting codes.” However, 
under certain circumstances, which are not uncommon in EMC situations, errors occur in bursts, 
i.e., a sequence of bits is damaged. Special techniques referred to as “burst error correcting codes” 
are available that can detect and correct errors bursts. A particular example is the technique of 
interleaving. Here a sequence of bits is interleaved (mixed up) before transmission, so that a burst 
of EMI affects bits in several words not just a few. With this arrangement errors are few and ran￾domly distributed in each word and hence can be corrected using random error correction codes. 
A deinterleaver then arranges bits in the right sequence after transmission. A detailed treatment of 
this specialist subject may be found in References 12 and 13.
The degree of sophistication incorporated into software to deal with errors reflects the impor￾tance attached to the correct operation of the system under design. However, some form of auto￾matic or manual reset following errors should be incorporated in all but the most basic systems.
Further details of software-related measures to improve EMC may be found in References 14 
and 15. The broad context in which the design of software for safety critical applications takes place 
is described in IEC Standard 61508 Part 2 (Requirements for electrical/electronic/programmable 
electronics safety-related systems).
12.3.2  Spread Spectrum Techniques
Developments in communications have resulted in heavy demands on the use of the frequency 
spectrum with the attendant problems of congestion and interference. In order to make the best use 
of the available spectrum, various common-sense measures are employed. These include using the 
minimum necessary transmitter power and bandwidth, directional antennas at minimum height, 
as high a carrier frequency as possible, and low harmonic emissions. A special transmission tech￾nique that was developed to make even better use of the available spectrum is the spread spectrum 
(SS) technique.16,17 The impact of SS transmission methods is very wide in both military and civil￾ian communications. The essence of the SS technique is described in Figure 12.2. This shows a 
simple direct sequence SS scheme whereby the data is used to amplitude modulate the carrier. The 
resulting signal is then amplitude modulated by a pseudorandom code sequence and the results of 
this process are sent to the transmission channel. At any stage during these processes, noise and 
interference may be added to the transmitted message. In Figure 12.2 only the transmitter is shown. 
At the receiver, the reverse process of demodulation takes place, where it is necessary to have a 268 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
synchronized copy of the pseudorandom code used by the transmitter. In practice all the signals 
referred to are binary sequences having values of ±1. The bit rate of the pseudorandom code is 
chosen to be much higher than the bit rate of the data. The result of this is that the frequency spec￾trum occupied by the message is much higher than that strictly required by the data. This may be 
regarded on first reflection as undesirable, but it must be borne in mind that although the message 
now occupies a very wide spectrum, the transmitted power per hertz is very low, typically below 
the thermal noise level of most receivers, which lack the correct code to reconstitute (despread) and 
recover the original data. Receivers with a correct copy of the code can implement despreading, 
demodulation, and filtering to obtain the transmitted data.
From this brief description of the SS technique, the following advantages are apparent: first, it 
provides a certain immunity from eavesdroppers, as receivers without a copy of the code cannot 
reconstruct the original data. Since the power spectral density is low, most users will not even be 
aware that there is a transmission in progress.
Second, several SS users may use the same frequency band but be addressed selectively using dif￾ferent code sequences. This feature maintains the secrecy of the communication and also increases 
spectrum utilization.
Third, the use of SS techniques increases interference rejection. This is particularly important in 
dealing with attempts to jam military and other communications.
It is outside the scope of this book to offer a comprehensive treatment of SS techniques. The inter￾ested reader may consult the references already cited where further details and other techniques, in 
additional to direct sequence, such as frequency hopping are described. However, it is worth explain￾ing briefly the mechanism of interference rejection in direct- sequence SS systems. Let a desired 
signal of power Ps at a carrier frequency f0 and spread to a bandwidth BWs be transmitted over a 
channel where an interfering signal at fi
 of power Pi
 is superimposed, as shown in Figure 12.3a. 
The bandwidth BWs is approximately equal to twice the clock frequency of the pseudorandom code. 
On reception, the desired signal after despreading appears as shown in Figure 12.3b. Spreading and 
despreading can be most simply done by implementing a modulo-2 addition of the data to the code, 
i.e., spreading = data ⊕ code. The despreading operations consists of another modulo-2 addition 
to the code, i.e., data ⊕ code ⊕ code = data, as can be easily confirmed from the properties of the 
modulo-2 addition. During the despreading operation, the modulo-2 addition of the interference 
signal to the code gives a broad spectrum of bandwidth BWs as shown in Figure 12.3b. The subse￾quent passage of these signals through a bandpass filter of bandwidth BWd, corresponding to the 
bandwidth of the data, results approximately in the following received power:
( )
=
=
Desired data power P
Interference power P /BW BW
s
i s d
Hence, the signal-to-interference ratio is equal to (Ps/Pi
) × (BWs/BWd). The quantity (BWs/BWd) is 
referred to as the process gain and it quantifies the improvement in signal-to-interference ratio as a 
result of the SS technique. As an example, if the interfering signal has a power P and a bandwidth 
FIGURE 12.2 Schematic of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum arrangement.General EMC Design Principles 269
of 10 kHz, the interference power at an SS receiver (BWs = 1MHz) operating at the same carrier 
frequency and with the same signal bandwidth will be P/100. Thus, worthwhile reductions to inter￾ference can be achieved by using SS systems. A more extensive discussion of the impact of SS on 
interference may be found in Reference 18. Issues related to spectrum management in general are 
explored in Reference 19.
Another area where SS have found application is in spread spectrum clock generators (SSCG), 
also known as dithered clock oscillators (DCO). Synchronous digital systems are driven by clocks. 
A perfect clock would have all radiated energy at its fundamental frequency and its harmonics. 
Receivers used for EMC tests have a bandwidth typically of 120 kHz. If all radiated energy were 
at a single frequency and this were within a single receiver BW, then a very large peak would be 
registered and the product would fail. A way around this is to modulate slightly the clock frequency 
around its nominal value and hence spread the radiated energy over a wider range of frequencies 
with the result that the peak values are reduced.10,15 It is important to realize that the total radiated 
energy is not reduced, it is simply spread over a wider frequency range. It is debatable whether this 
strategy is ultimately beneficial. There is evidence that broadband systems may be more susceptible 
to radiation from equipment with dithered clocks. However, SSCG are widely used in many com￾mercial systems. One obvious advantage is that the spreading function can be simply introduced 
without changing anything else in the design of the circuit — an obvious quick fix if EMC problems 
are encountered at a late stage.
The basic technique is locking a phase-locked loop to a crystal oscillator and adding a small 
modulating signal (±0.5%) as shown in Figure 12.4.20 It is possible to provide center-spreading 
(output frequency around the nominal frequency) or down-spreading (output frequency below the 
nominal value). In the former case some clock periods are shorter, which may be a problem in sys￾tems with tight timing margins. In the latter, the average frequency is lower than its nominal value 
with some loss in performance. Normally, clock spreading can be set at different configurations or 
even turned off during the BIOS set-up.
12.4 THE MANAGEMENT OF EMC
Designing for EMC and ensuring compliance throughout the entire production cycle and in the 
field is a complex matter. A start should be made by identifying the technical and legal constraints 
imposed by EMC and by making available to the design team the necessary resources to meet the 
FIGURE 12.3 Spreading (a) and despreading (b) in SS systems.270 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
desired objectives. Unfortunately, EMC is not a clearly identifiable aspect of a product, and in many 
cases spending money and time on EMC at an early stage feels like paying an excessive insurance 
premium. Questions are asked whether such an effort is justified and whether in fact the product 
would not have been acceptable without EMC-related expenses, which normally add little to func￾tionality under normal conditions. It is also difficult to assess with confidence the safety margin 
required to meet EMC regulations comfortably, and to deal with the unexpected. Since EMC con￾siderations can have considerable impact on aspects of design that do not at first sight seem relevant, 
it is essential to establish at the very beginning the ground rules and procedures necessary to ensure 
EMC. Most practitioners agree that a single person with responsibility for EMC should be appointed 
and must have the necessary status to see that the correct EMC procedures are established and 
maintained throughout the design. An important part of the EMC coordinator’s task is to be aware 
of developments in regulatory aspects of EMC and to establish awareness of EMC at all levels of 
the organization.
Issues to consider at an early stage are the general level of EMC expertise within the company 
and the need to seek outside advice, the availability or not of test facilities within the organization 
and the need to use external facilities, and the timetable and procedures leading to compliance 
with EMC standards and regulations. Finally, proper EMC quality controls must be established and 
maintained during an extended production period when several modifications, redesigns, and sourc￾ing of components from different suppliers may be necessary. It must be borne in mind that practi￾cally all aspects of design and manufacture of equipment can have an impact on EMC. Experience 
and problems with EMC must be carefully analyzed and the knowledge gained must be dissemi￾nated widely within the organization to improve future design for EMC.
A systematic approach to the management of EMC can be achieved following the well￾established principles of risk analysis.21 The conventional approach to EMC standards is through 
the publication of individual equipment standards, which must meet emission and susceptibility 
limits. This therefore can be described as a rule-based approach. For every class of equipment, 
there are appropriate standards suitable for the particular working environments. The consequence 
of this is that for the same generic type of equipment, different limits may apply depending on 
whether its intended use is, for example, in a domestic or military environment. It is inevitable that 
military-grade equipment has more demanding specifications and are therefore considerably more 
costly. Many designers of military installations are tempted to use, because of the lower cost, com￾mercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment. The only way this can be done is by using a risk-based 
approach to EMC where the emphasis is on establishing the risks of EMC failure of equipment in 
their actual working environment rather than insisting that each piece of equipment meets some 
strict EMC specifications. Instead of ensuring lower emissions and higher immunity at the level of 
each piece of equipment, we can interrupt and/or attenuate the coupling paths by judicious use of 
features of the actual working environment. In this way, cheaper equipment can be used without 
compromising EMC.22 Following References 21, 22, a scheme for EMC risk management is shown 
schematically in Figure 12.5.
FIGURE 12.4 Schematic diagram of a dithered clock circuit.General EMC Design Principles 271
A systematic approach to risk management is necessary in order to assign some quantitative 
measure to risk and balance it against the appetite and scope for risk in each particular case. In 
Figure 12.5, five steps may be identified. Context means establishing the scope, objective, and meth￾odologies for risk assessment. All stakeholders must be involved and take ownership of the process 
by appropriate consultation and communication protocols. Monitoring and review throughout the 
lifetime of the product or installation is essential to ensure that the risk assessment process is effec￾tive and appropriate. The main EMC technical part is in risk assessment and treatment. The focus is 
the technical assessment of risk. This involves the identification of specific risks, say “i”, the prob￾ability of such a risk materializing “pi
”, and the consequences of such a risk. The total perceived 
risk is then the sum of terms,
= × ∑=
risk pi consequences
i 1
n
Thus, risk is a combination of probability and criticality, and the acceptable level of risk will vary 
depending on the application. Risk treatment involves the standard EMC mitigation techniques, 
which are explored throughout this text. A useful approach to risk assessment is described in 
Reference 22 under the label of TSECA (Threat Scenario, Effects and Criticality Analysis). Some 
examples of measures to achieve EMI resilience are described in Reference 23.

EMC Standards and Testing
Following an understanding of concepts underlying EMC and coverage of the basic interference 
control techniques, it is now necessary to address the subject of EMC standards and the tests used 
to demonstrate compliance. However careful a design has been from the EMC point of view, it is 
always necessary to measure EMC performance against specific standards. The range of standards 
and associated measurements is very wide and no single person can have a complete grasp of every 
detail. However, the basic methodology employed in standards and testing should be familiar to 
all concerned with EMC. Demonstrating compliance with a particular standard involves measur￾ing voltages (for conducted emission) and electric fields (for radiated emission) under formalized 
conditions. These are then compared with specific limits. There is no guarantee that a product 
that meets a standard will not experience interference problems. Hence, although complying with 
a standard is essential, it is no substitute for having a thorough grasp of the EMC design of the 
product. In the following two chapters both standards and testing are described in general terms to 
alert the designer to the difficulties that may be encountered.

13 EMC Standards
In this chapter the international framework relevant to EMC is described. EMC standards and regu￾lations cover in detail many aspects of EMC performance and testing and are continuously evolv￾ing. Neither the complete detail nor the current status of standards can therefore be reflected fully in 
a book. It is the responsibility of the designer to keep up to date with relevant standards in his or her 
field of activity and for the intended market. This can best be done through national standards and 
trade associations. The purpose of this chapter is to present the basic structure of EMC standards as 
it stands at the time of writing.
13.1 THE NEED FOR STANDARDS
Progress in automation and the international nature of trade go hand-in-hand with standardization. 
International and national organizations have been set up with the aim of introducing standards 
affecting virtually all aspects of manufacture and trade. Good standards allow interchangeability 
and compatibility of equipment, relatively free trade, and satisfaction for the customer. In addition 
they should not be a barrier to technological progress. The setting of standards is a complex and 
lengthy process as it cuts across technical, trade, and national prestige issues. There are standards 
set by international organizations, national bodies, trade associations, insurance companies, etc. 
These standards are, in most cases, similar, but there are also many differences in the specific limits 
set by various organizations, the method of measurement and testing, and the route to compliance. 
Describing all standards that have an impact on EMC would require a whole book. The useful life￾time of such a book would be rather short. In addition, such coverage may generate the notion that 
there is nothing fundamental and no commonality among the bewildering variety of standards. For 
both these reasons, no attempt is made here to be comprehensive. Instead only the main standards 
are described, starting with the international framework and continuing with commercial, military, 
and company standards. In each case, typical examples are given to help the reader understand the 
nature of standards and prevalent limits.
It is worth pointing out that complying with an EMC standard is no guarantee that the product 
will not experience upsets due to electromagnetic interference. It is thus important to examine how 
far beyond meeting EMC regulations one has to go to produce a marketable product of high opera￾tional integrity at a reasonable cost.
13.2 THE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK
The benefits of standardization are so significant that efforts at defining and maintaining standards 
are directed by major international bodies. Under the aegis of the United Nations Organization, 
various educational and scientific establishments have been set up, such as the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), and the International Council for Scientific Unions (ICSU). Also, spe￾cialized agencies like the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) operate in areas where 
action at the international level is deemed necessary. Membership of these organizations is open 
to all nations and hence any agreements reached command, in general, widespread acceptance. 
The normal pattern is for such agreements and standards to be adopted by individual nations and 
embodied into national legislation. Hence, although major trading nations have their own standards 
organizations, they tend to reflect closely international practice whenever such practice has been 
established. From the EMC point of view, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-17276 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
which is a division of ISO, and ITU are the most important. The work of the IEC has impact on all 
EMC regulations and forms the model for most of them.1 Within the technical committee structure 
of the IEC, the following three technical committees are the most important for EMC:
CISPR (International Special Committee on Radio Interference)
TC77 (Concerned mainly with EMC in electrical equipment and networks)
TC65 (Concerned mainly with immunity standards)
The output of the CISPR committee is in the form of standards with the designation CISPR10 to 
CISPR23 covering a wide range of EMC-related topics. These are mentioned in more detail when 
civilian standards are considered in the next section.
Technical Committee 77 is responsible for a series of publications with the designation 555 
covering harmonics and flicker, and 1000 covering low-frequency phenomena in power networks. 
Technical Committee 65 has produced a series of standards with the designation 801 covering 
issues related to immunity. These form the background on which detailed immunity standards are 
developed. A discussion of IEC standards on EMC and related topics may be found in Reference 1.
13.3 CIVILIAN EMC STANDARDS
Civilian EMC standards have now been adopted by most countries and in most cases they have the 
force of law. In general, noncompliance with EMC standards can delay or prevent the marketing and 
sale of products and any infringements may lead to prosecution. It is therefore of the utmost impor￾tance to be aware of these standards and meet all detailed requirements for demonstrating compliance.
13.3.1 FCC Standards
Within the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for radio 
communications and interference. No product can be sold in the United States if FCC requirements 
are not met. FCC Rules Part 15 Subpart J (RFI emissions) cover digital equipment and thus affect 
a wide range of products. The regulations concern conducted and radiated interference and refer 
to two classes of equipment. Class A equipment is for use in commercial, industrial, and business 
premises, whereas Class B equipment is intended for residential use. Regulations for class B equip￾ment tend to be more stringent. Any device with timing (clock) pulses in excess of 10kHz is covered 
by FCC regulations. The upper frequency tends to be of the order of ten times the highest clock 
frequency. Hence with clock frequencies now exceeding 1000MHz, EMC regulations will cover 
emissions well into the gigahertz range.
Conducted interference covers frequencies ranging between 450 kHz and 30MHz. Regulations 
aim at controlling interference current in power leads. Since specifications are given in terms of 
voltages measured on such leads, it is necessary to define more closely the impedance across which 
such measurements are made. This is done by interposing a line impedance stabilization network 
(LISN) between the equipment to be tested and the power supply network. This consists of a combi￾nation of capacitors, resistors, and inductors so that for frequencies up to 30MHz the impedance to 
ground is essentially constant and equal to approximately 50 Ω. The conducted interference limits 
for classes A and B according to FCC rules are shown in Figure 13.1.
Radiated interference limits are set on measurements taken using resonant dipoles at a distance 
of 3m for class B and 10m for class A from the equipment under test (EUT). Measurements of the 
electric field (in dBμV/m) are taken in an open-field site with antennas scanned in horizontal and 
vertical polarizations and with the EUT rotated to obtain the maximum emission. The relevant lim￾its are shown in Figure 13.2. It should be emphasized that the two limits shown are set for different 
measurement distances. It can be argued that class B limits are more severe and the limits for class 
A equipment may be referred to the 3-m distance for comparison. This can be done by assuming EMC Standards 277
far-field conditions and adding 20 log (10/3) dBμV/m to the curve in Figure 13.2 for class A. 
This raises this curve by approximately 10 dB. However, it must be stressed that there is no firm 
scientific basis for assuming far-field conditions, especially at low frequencies.
Personal computers and peripherals are certified and may also be tested by the FCC. Other 
equipment is certified by the manufacturer. Separate FCC regulations (Part 18) apply for industrial, 
scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment, which specify operating frequencies and the amount of 
permitted radiation outside the specified frequency bands.
The coordinating organization for standardization in the United States is the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) to which other interested bodies, such as the IEEE EMC Society, 
contribute EMC-related standards.2

13.3.2 European Standards
The European Commission (EC) established, through its directive of May 3, 1989, the require￾ments for electromagnetic compatibility.3 Subsequent amendments allowed for a transitional period, 
with the full force of the directive coming into effect on January 1, 1996. All member countries 
are required to enact legislation to implement the directive. The directive is all embracing, cover￾ing emission and susceptibility for a wide range of equipment and imposes duties on manufac￾turers whether or not appropriate standards exist. The regulations do not apply to equipment for 
export, specific large installations, spare parts, second-hand apparatus, amateur radio and military 
equipment, and those covered by other directives. The European Standards Committee (CEN) is 
responsible through the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standards (CENELEC) for the 
adoption of suitable standards. These are generic standards, covering in broad terms broad classes 
of equipment, i.e., class 1 (residential, commercial, and light industry) and class 2 (heavy indus￾try); basic standards (setting out test procedures); and product standards (covering specific types of 
apparatus, e.g., information technology equipment). A partial list of harmonized standards is given 
in Table 13.1.4,8 As an example, the limits set for conducted interference according to EN55022 
(equivalent to CISPR22) are shown in Figure 13.1 assuming a quasipeak detector. Two classes of 
equipment, A and B, are defined. Class B is equipment that is subject to no restrictions on its use.
Radiated emission limits are set for measurements taken on an open-field site of adequate qual￾ity. The EUT must be rotated and the antenna height varied between 1 and 4m to obtain the

maximum electric field strength. Broadband antennas in vertical and horizontal polarizations are 
used. The distance between the EUT and the measurement antenna is 10m for class B and 30m for 
class A equipment. The adopted limits, assuming a quasipeak detector, are shown in Figure 13.2. 
The attention of the reader is drawn to the fact that the limits shown refer to different measurement dis￾tances and that they may be referred to the same distance assuming far-field conditions (1/r decay). This 
approach, although used extensively, cannot be expected to give accurate results at low frequencies where 
far-field conditions cannot be guaranteed. Compliance with the requirements of the directive can be dem￾onstrated by the manufacturer meeting EC approved standards, by producing a technical construction file 
prepared by a competent body (the only option available when an approved standard does not exist), or by 
meeting special type examinations (for radio transmission equipment only). A comprehensive discussion 
of the EC directive and routes to compliance may be found in References 5 and 6. A description of the 
process of implementation in one of the European countries may be found in Reference 7.
It is stressed again that Table 13.1 is a snapshot of some of the key European standards currently 
available, which are reflected in IEC standards usually with similar numbers (e.g., EN61547 and 
IEC61547). Revisions of standards are continuously produced and new ones are introduced, there￾fore frequent updates of the information in this table are necessary. These can be readily obtained 
from the EU Directorate on Enterprise and Industry8 or from sites of commercial testing organiza￾tions who, in the process of advertising their services, provide regular updates.
In particular application areas, where safety is of paramount importance, special regulations 
apply. A particular example is the automotive area where EMC requirements are particularly severe 
and limits tend to be higher. Equipment used in road vehicles (ESA-electrical/electronic subassem￾blies such as radios, mobile phones) must comply with the Automotive EMC Directive (95/54/EC) 
and (2004/104/ED) (from 1 January 2006). Several test standards are involved in automotive EMC 
including, CISPR 12 and 25 and ISO 11451, 11452, and 7637.
In regard to the main EMC directive in Reference 3 this will be replaced from July 20, 2007, by 
a new directive 2004/108/EC.9
This new directive is aimed at simplifying regulatory procedures, reducing costs, and increasing 
documentation and information for inspection purposes. Manufacturers will be solely responsible 
for establishing the conformity of their products and for the “CE” marking. The simplified confor￾mity procedures are accompanied by stricter requirements for information and documentation, a 
special regime for fixed installations (power plants, telecommunications networks, distribution net￾works), and the principle that strict regulatory harmonization is restricted to essential public interest 
requirements. Further details may be found in Reference 10.
13.3.3  Other EMC Standards
There is a variety of national standards covering EMC. Specific examples are those produced in the 
United Kingdom by the British Standards Institution (BSI) and in Germany by the Verband Deutscher 
Elektrotekniker (VDE). These are being rapidly brought into line with the provisions of the European 
Community EMC directive. Standardization in Japan is described in Reference 11. Canadian stan￾dards set by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) are in general similar to those set by the 
FCC. EMC standards are undergoing a rapid evolution and it is hoped that greater commonality will 
be achieved through mutual recognition agreements between the major standards organizations.12
13.3.4  Sample Calculation for Conducted Emission
We give here a sample calculation of conducted emissions for a power electronic circuit, the type of a 
simple calculation that a designer may have made in an effort to ensure that the product meets CE stan￾dards. Because of the relatively low frequencies involved in CE problems it is far easier to do analytical 
calculations compared to RE problems. A more thorough discussion of conducted emission problems 
in three-phase power electronic drives may be found in References 13, 14, and 15.280 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The generic problem is the single-phase load shown in Figure 13.3. The parameters and basic 
assumptions are listed below:
• MOSFET duty cycle is 40%
• Switching frequency f = 50kHz
• Fall- and rise-times 300 ns
• Cstray = 100 pF (only impedance between power circuit and earth)
• Neglect all impedances in CM path except Cstray
• At HF the DC capacitor is a short
The task is to calculate the CM voltage measured at the LISN at 3MHz. The LISN interposed 
between the power supply on the left and the EUT is shown schematically in Figure 13.4. In this 
figure the CM and DM current paths are shown. Therefore, the current flows in the LISN resistors 
are as shown in Figure 13.5, Hence, the equivalent circuit for CM current has the form shown in 
Figure 13.6. It remains to establish the value of VCM at 3MHz. This we have done in the example 
of Section 5.3.3 and is 111.43 dBμV. At 3MHz 1/(ωCstray) = 1/(2π3 × 106 × 100 × 10−12) = 513 Ω. 
Hence, the voltage across the LISN (parallel combination of the two 50Ω resistors) is

or, in decibels,

If we wish to reduce this level, we may introduce the CM choke, which we considered in the exam￾ple of Section 11.1. We found in that section that the LISN voltage was 61.5 × 10−6 VCM. Hence, the 
CM choke has introduced an attenuation of

13.4 MILITARY STANDARDS
Military systems present special problems to the EMC specialist. Increased use of electronic commu￾nications for integrated command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) between the vari￾ous services (land, air, and sea), the hostile nature of the battle environment, the need for portability 
and secrecy, and the deliberate use of electromagnetic energy for jamming, have created an extremely 
complex EMC system problem. A brief description of the relevant standards used in the United States 
and the United Kingdom is given below. NATO countries tend to follow similar procedures. Further 
details may be found in Reference 16.
13.4.1 Military Standard MIL-STD-461D17
The first successful attempts to establish a tri-service EMC standard in the United States date 
from the mid-1960s. The first documents issued were MIL-STD-461, -462, and -463 covering 
requirements, measurements, and definitions, respectively. These standards went through a pro￾cess of evolution over the years with the intention of improving accuracy and repeatability. A 
feature of military standards is that they specify measurements in screened rooms in order to 
avoid difficulties with ambient electromagnetic noise. Measurements in unlined screened rooms 
are notoriously unrepeatable due to resonances. The introduction of radiation-absorbing mate￾rial (RAM) can improve matters at high frequencies, but at low frequencies difficulties remain. 
Measurements are normally taken by placing the EUT on a conducting bench and using a variety 
of test antennas placed 1m away from the EUT. Both electric and magnetic field measurements, 
the latter at low frequencies only, are taken. Loops antennas for LF magnetic field and dipole 
antennas for LF electric fields (≤ 30MHz) are used. In the range 30 to 300MHz, biconical anten￾nas are generally employed, while between 300MHz and 1 GHz log-periodic antennas are the 
preferred choice. Above this frequency, horn antennas are generally used. The various require￾ments are shown in Table 13.2. It will be seen that the military EMC test requirements are more 
comprehensive than commercial EMC specifications. However, the test set-up used, with the test 
antenna in the near field of the EUT over a wide frequency range, makes direct comparisons 
between military and commercial limits difficult to make with any confidence. The number of 
tests and limits required are extensive and hence details cannot be given here. The reader is 
referred to the document in Reference 17 and also the companion document MTL-STD-461D 
covering the measurement procedures.
13.4.2  Defense Standard DEF-STAN 59–4118
In the late 1970s, a set of standards under the designation 59-41 was published in the United 
Kingdom covering the EMC performance of defense-related equipment. As in the case of similar 
standards in the United States, the great diversity between the needs of the different services has led 
to a complex set of requirements and limits. The main requirements are outlined in Table 13.3 and 
further details may be found in Reference 18. Emphasis is on testing inside screened rooms with a 
conducting bench and antennas placed 1m away from the EUT. The standards are comprehensive in 
the sense that limits on both electric and magnetic field are specified covering a very wide frequency 
range. The difficulties associated with the repeatability of measurements inside an undamped or 
partially damped screened room in the near field of the EUT have led, as in the case of the MIL￾STD, to a reexamination of the test procedures. The thrust of this effort is directed toward introduc￾ing limited amounts of radiation-absorbing material (RAM) and taking account in calibration of all 
instrument and proximity correction factors.
The intention is that measurements taken inside a screened room can be used to predict test 
results on an open-field site within an uncertainty of ±6 dB. The greatest difficulty in this respect is 
in introducing sufficient damping in a screened room at the first one or two resonance frequencies EMC Standards 283

A summary of the work that affects the evolution of this standard can be found in References 
19 to 22. Problems associated with the testing of large items such as aircraft are described in 
Reference 23.
13.5 COMPANY STANDARDS
Civilian standards have the force of law and noncompliance imposes severe limitations on trade and 
also other penalties. Military standards do not, in general, have a legal status and may be waived 
by permission from the relevant authorities. There are in addition a number of internal company 
standards and other specific requirements imposed by various agencies, insurance companies, etc. 
Company standards evolved over the years to fill gaps in national and international standards. They 
still have a role to play in setting limits and defining procedures that ensure that on completion of 
a design, the product will not have major difficulties in meeting international standards. In some 
countries, major utilities such as power supply or telecommunications may have their own standards 
that affect their purchasing. The situation must be ascertained in each case to avoid unexpected 
obstacles in the future. Similarly, major insurance companies and underwriters impose their own 
standards appropriate to their specific requirements.
In each country, national standards organizations and trade associations such as, for example, 
the National Electrical Manufacturers (NEMA) in the United States and the British Electrical and 
Allied Manufacturers’ Association (BEAMA) in the United Kingdom, can advise on the current 
status of standards affecting their market sectors.
13.6 POWER QUALITY, ELECTRICAL DRIVES, AND SMART GRIDS
In the low-frequency range of a few–150kHz, significant interference occurs due to a variety of 
reasons. These are also referred to as power quality issues when they are manifested in power lines. 
In current practice, a significant number of equipment connected to the grid are effectively non￾linear loads due to the ubiquitous presence of switching elements in power electronic drives and 
other devices. The characterization of such non-linear and time-dependent impedances is difficult. 
In this environment, resonances may occur, further complicating prediction and interpretation. In 
Section 13.3.4, a model of conducted emissions in an electrical drive was shown indicating the main 
components instrumental in the level of interference. There are many references addressing issues in 
the modeling of power electronic components which are relevant to this problem.24–26 An additional 
complication are the recent developments in the so-called smart grid technologies. The primary 
feature of smart grids is that they enable a range of generating options and a two-way flow of elec￾trical energy. Typically, a consumer may have a local generating source, e.g., from a photovoltaic 
installation (microgeneration), and thus at times being supplied by the grid and at other times sup￾plying energy to the grid. There is thus more control of energy utilization and the scope to minimize 
losses and reduce costs. It also opens the possibility of more energy storage options, remote meter￾ing, and the detection of grid problems which can be isolated locally without widespread outages. 
These capabilities require distributed sensors and power line communications to configure the grid, 
generators, and consumers in the optimum manner. A consequence of this is that at any time, in a 
dynamically configured network, a multitude of signals — in addition to power-line frequencies — 
are in transit through the grid. This situation if not properly understood and controlled can influence 
power quality, cause difficulties for protection schemes, and generate interference and thus EMC 
and interoperability problems. A survey of some of these issues may be found in Reference 27. As 
regards electrical drives, currently the relevant standard is IEC 61800-3.28 General installation guides 
for large electrical drives are available from manufacturers and installers, e.g., References 29 and 
30. A review of numerical simulation methods in power electronics may be found in Reference 31.
Smart, grid-based issues are an active area in standards’ development, and readers should keep 
in touch with the literature for updates.EMC Standards 285
It is worth pointing out that in electromechanical systems, such as electrical drives, the condition 
of the bearings may also affect EMC characteristics. An equivalent circuit illustrating the issues 
involved is shown in Figure 13.7.32 The figure shows the various capacitances involved in the flow of 
high-frequency currents. There are two bearings at the two ends of the shaft as shown. The voltage 
across the bearings VB may become large enough to initiate an electrical breakdown across the thin 
lubricating layer, thus changing the impedance presented to HF currents in an erratic manner. This 
affects the spectral content and magnitude of the EMI current and also may damage the surface of 
the bearings (pitting), leading to unplanned outages.
In previous sections, we have mentioned filters as a means of preventing the flow of undesirable 
currents. These were invariably passive filters consisting of capacitors and inductors introducing 
discontinuity and absorption for undesirable currents. The disadvantage of these filters is that they 
are bulky and heavy. Therefore, alternatives are sought based on active cancellation principles such 
as those used in audio systems (noise cancellation in headphones). Using such schemes, the volume 
of the filter can be reduced by a substantial amount. The basic configuration is shown in Figure 13.8, 
where the active filter is interposed between the source and victim of EMI.
The EMI signal is sensed, and a cancelling signal is synthetized and then injected to cancel the 
EMI. If the interfering signal is known in advance, this process is straightforward. Otherwise, a 
cancelling signal may have to be synthesized from a large number of sinusoids by adjusting their 
amplitude and phase to reproduce an arbitrary broadband cancelling signal. If the EMI signal is 
quasi-periodic, this process is relatively easy, but for rapidly changing signals and severe transients, 
it is far more challenging. Various possibilities are available. Interference may be sensed at the 
source end (“A” in Figure 13.8), inverted, amplified, and injected at the victim side “B”. This is 
known as the feedforward scheme. Alternatively, we may sense any residual interference at the 
victim end “B”, invert, amplify, and inject at the source end “A”. This is known as the feedback

scheme. Either voltage or current may be sensed and voltage or current injected, thus giving four 
possibilities. The basic idea in each case is to have destructive interference between the noise and 
the injected signal (anti-noise). The achievable suppression is typically up to 50 dB. More details 
may be found in References 33 to 35. This approach may be extended to suppress EMI at multiple 
terminals. A typical configuration is shown in Figure 13.9.
Here, at the center we have a source of EMI and we are interested in suppressing interference 
at the two terminals to victims 1 and 2.36 Simultaneous cancellation is possible using the same 
principles as before, but special care should be taken as the two EMI and cancelling signals may 
interfere with each other.
13.7 EMC AT FREQUENCIES ABOVE 1GHZ
The scope of EMC standards is very wide, extending from DC to 400GHz, intended as it were to 
address a legal problem. But, in practice, most testing is limited to frequencies below 1GHz. In the 
United States, regulations require testing up to ten times the clock frequency and this appears a sen￾sible approach. As, at present, clock frequencies are in the gigahertz range, it is clear that the current 
practice of limiting testing to 1GHz is not a sensible one. Protection of the radio spectrum requires 
that testing to at least 2GHz is done, for example, to deal with mobile services (GSM 1800). There 
is increasing evidence that man-made EM noise is rapidly increasing as indicated in Reference 37.
The difficulties of testing efficiently at frequencies above 1GHz are considerable. Current testing 
practices, which are very time consuming, will become even more so at higher frequencies. It is not 
difficult to see why. As the frequency increases and the dimensions of the EUT become comparable 
to the wavelength, EUT behavior resembles that of an antenna or an array of antennas with highly 
directive radiation patterns, sometimes in the form of very narrow beams. A simple EUT is shown 
in Figure 13.10 to help illustrate the point. It consists of a base unit, a top lid, and a side panel, all

good electrical conductors. The top lid can be offset from the base unit to exaggerate a narrow 
gap due to an ill-fitting top lid. Emissions from this gap are labeled as G1 in the calculations that 
follow. Similarly, an emission mode G2 applies if the side panel does not fit well to the base unit. 
Similarly, the top lid has a slot (S1) as does the Side panel (S2). The overall dimensions of the EUT 
are 48 × 48 × 12cm3. The slots have dimensions 16 × 4 cm2. The EUT was modeled numerically 
using the Nottingham TLM solver, where the gap modes were excited by impressing a voltage 
between the base unit and the lid (or panel) and the slot modes by impressing a voltage across the 
slot in the middle of the widest dimension. Figures 13.11 to 13.14 show results for the G1, G2, S1, 
S2, respectively. In each case only one mode is radiating, the other three having been suppressed. 
In this way it is easier to study how an EUT radiates. The plots show the vertical component of the 
electric field on a vertical plane passing through the EUT center. The outline of the EUT is clearly 
seen. Plots at four frequencies are shown corresponding to EUT internal resonances. It is clear that 
with increasing frequency the G-modes show an increasingly directive pattern with narrow beams. 
This is less pronounced for the S-modes as the size of the slots is small compared to the wavelength 
at these frequencies. Clearly, projecting the results to frequencies above 1GHz one can see that 
practical EUTs become highly directive antennas. Under these circumstances, trying to identify the 
maximum radiated field will be difficult and time consuming. New ways of approaching EMC tests 
may be necessary and not merely an extension of existing ones.
CISPR/A is developing standards for measurement methods above 1GHz (CISPR 16-2-3) and for 
site validation above 1GHz (CISPR 16-1-4). The arrangement is shown in Figure 13.15. The EUT is 
rotated in 15° increments. If the EUT is contained within the antenna beamwidth w then no height 
span is performed, but work is in progress to introduce a height span even for this case. Testing is 
FIGURE 13.11 Electric field profile from gap G1, at four different frequencies.288 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
likely to extend to 18GHz. This is an area in EMC testing that will evolve rapidly in the years to 
come. For a discussion of the issues involved, see References 38 and 39.
13.8 HUMAN EXPOSURE LIMITS TO EM FIELDS
The setting of safe limits for human exposure to EM fields is not strictly an EMC matter. However, a 
brief description of these limits is given here to alert those involved with EMC measurements, espe￾cially susceptibility measurements, to the main issues. There is at present no complete understand￾ing of the mechanisms responsible for the interaction of EM fields with human tissue. Traditionally, 
limits were set by assuming thermal effects and restricting the specific absorption rate (W/kg) in 
the body to a value giving a total amount of power absorbed comparable to the basic metabolic rate 
(~100 W). There is, however, concern that other nonthermal mechanisms are operating and that 
resonances (whole-body or in cavities such as the eye) can cause damage to humans.
The International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee (INIRC) sets limits but in addition each 
country and each organization has its own ideas as to the most appropriate limits. The situation is 
unsatisfactory, as the basic interaction mechanisms at the cell level are not fully understood and 
the epidemiological evidence is confusing. The INIRC sets different occupational exposure limits 
and limits for the general public. For example, it is recommended by the INIRC that the absorption 
rate in the body over a 6-minute period should not exceed 0.4 W/kg for workers or 0.08 W/kg for 
members of the general public, at frequencies above 10MHz. Guidance as to the exposure limits 
recommended in the United Kingdom may be found in Reference 40. Further information regarding 
health effects may be found in Reference 41. At low frequencies (below 100 to 300MHz) separate 
FIGURE 13.12 Electric field profile from gap G2, at four different frequencies.EMC Standards 289
limits for electric and magnetic fields are set, while at high frequencies limits on the power den￾sity are specified. As an example, the IEEE recommends that at frequencies below approximately 
1MHz the electric and magnetic field should not exceed 614V/m and 163A/m, respectively. These 
limits fall as 1/f to reach 27.5V/m at 30MHz and 0.073A/m at 100MHz. Power densities of less 
than 0.2mW/cm2 up to 300MHz are specified, rising with frequency to 10mW/cm2 at 15GHz. Full 
details may be found in Reference 42. The NRPB in the United Kingdom recommends 1mW/cm2
(30 to 400MHz) rising with frequency to 5mW/cm2 at 2GHz.40 There is substantial variability in 
limits set in different countries. As an example, limits for exposure of the general public to power 
frequency (50/60Hz) electric fields range between 1 and 30 kV/m. The interested reader is advised 
to consult national and international authorities and keep in touch with developments.
Detailed guidelines on exposure up to 300GHz are provided by the ICNIRP in Reference 43.
The IEEE in 2005 updated its standard referred to in Reference 41. For a summary of this stan￾dard and comparisons to other available guidelines the reader should consult Reference 44.
Regarding the impact of wireless technologies in this area, there have been numerous studies 
connected with possible adverse health effects due to mobile phones. A wide-ranging study com￾missioned by the U.K. government has looked at all the evidence and produced its recommendations 
contained in the so called “Stewart Report.”45 While no specific problems were identified, the tone 
of the recommendations is to avoid unnecessary exposure, especially for children.
A survey of standards related to mobile phones is presented in Reference 46, where the approach 
adopted in setting the specific absorption rate (SAR) below what is regarded as the threshold for 
FIGURE 13.13 Electric field profile from aperture S1, at four different frequencies.290 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
adverse effects (4 W/kg) is explained. Occupational limits are set ten times lower (0.4 W/kg) and 
general public limits fifty times lower (0.08 W/kg).
Other studies focused on specific wireless technologies are reported in References 47 and 48.
FIGURE 13.14 Electric field profile from aperture S2, at four different frequencies.
FIGURE 13.15 Schematic of the arrangement proposed for EMC tests above 1GHz.EMC Standards 291
Numerous studies of field penetration inside a model of a human head in the presence of a mobile 
phone have been done to help calculate the SAR in different parts. These numerical models can be 
very sophisticated and include the parameters of a great number of different types of tissue. An 
example of such a calculation obtained with the Nottingham TLM solver is shown in Figure 13.16.

Finally, attention is drawn to the EU Physical Agents Directive, which is all encompassing and 
aims at protecting workers against risks arising from physical agents such as electromagnetic fields.49

14 EMC Measurements 
and Testing
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the main experimental techniques used in 
EMC studies. A substantial part of published standards contains detailed experimental procedures 
for EMC testing. It is not possible or advisable to repeat here in detail all the relevant procedures. 
Instead, the basic experimental tools and test environments are described and emphasis is placed on 
pointing out difficulties that may lead to errors and poor repeatability of measurements. The reader 
is advised to consult the relevant standards prior to performing EMC measurements.
14.1 EMC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
Measurements are performed to meet two requirements. First, measurements to ascertain the emis￾sion and susceptibility of equipment are necessary throughout the design phase. The purpose of 
these measurements is mainly diagnostic, in that it helps to identify likely problem areas and tests 
the effectiveness of various remedies. These measurements are under the complete control of the 
designer and test engineer and hence any number of a range of techniques may be used according 
to circumstances. Second, tests on complete equipment are prescribed by standards and these are 
mandatory in most cases. The measurement arrangement and receivers and transducers used are 
normally described in considerable detail. Hence, there are certain aspects of the measurement that 
are fully specified and there is little scope for variation. In many cases, formal tests required by 
certification authorities must be performed by accredited laboratories. If the equipment under test 
(EUT) fails to meet the standard, it is brought back to the design office for modification and it may 
thus undergo further diagnostic and standards testing. The purpose of EMC design is to reduce the 
need for retesting and modification to the bare minimum. Testing involves, depending on the particu￾lar standard, frequencies ranging from a few kilohertz to several gigahertz. Standards specify tests 
for emission and susceptibility both conducted and radiated as described in Chapter 13. It is obvious 
that testing on such a scale involves a grasp of many electromagnetic phenomena and it is subject to 
many uncertainties. It is fair to say that EMC measurements are, in general, less accurate when com￾pared to other high-frequency measurements. The reasons for this are complex, as will be explained 
later. Recognition of this fact does not, however, absolve the experimenter from the responsibility of 
ensuring the lowest possible uncertainty in measurements. The purpose of this chapter is to present 
the main experimental techniques and outline areas where large uncertainties may be introduced. 
Detailed test arrangements and schedules may be found in the published standards.
A fully specified EMC test facility requires a substantial investment in buildings, equipment, 
and personnel and it is not within the reach of medium- to small-sized companies. However, useful 
diagnostic work may be done with modest resources and indeed it is essential that experience of 
measurements is part of the range of skills available to the design engineer. The material that fol￾lows should therefore be of value to all those involved with EMC.
A brief survey of EMC measurements may be found in Reference 1.
14.2 MEASUREMENT TOOLS
Irrespective of the formal standard involved, a number of basic tools are required to do EMC 
measurements. The issues involved in their selection, characterization, and use are briefly 
described below.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-18296 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
14.2.1  Sources
Sources are required for all susceptibility measurements. As is evident from the description of 
the various standards in Chapter 13, there is a lack of detailed commercial product standards for 
susceptibility compared to the corresponding situation for emission. A good start for ascertaining 
requirements is the IEC-801 standard.2 The various parts of this standard are incorporated into 
national and European standards (e.g., BS6667: Part 1, BS EN60801: Part 2, BS6667: Part 3). Part 3 
defines three severity levels over the frequency range 27 to 500MHz, where the test field strength in 
V/m is 1, 3, and 10. No sources are capable of generating such fields directly. The usual configura￾tion is for a low-power source to feed a broadband RF power amplifier capable of delivering a few 
watts of RF power. The selection of the amplifier is based on the required gain, linearity, and the 
practical requirement that it must be capable of feeding mismatched loads. A low-level power source 
covering frequencies at least up to 1GHz is also necessary. It should be capable of feeding the power 
amplifier and it is also useful if a basic signal modulating facility is available.
Special source requirements apply to the testing for electrostatic discharge and fast transients. 
Part 3 of IEC8012 describes a simplified ESD generator consisting of a high-voltage source charg￾ing a 150-pF capacitor via a high resistance (50 to 100MΩ). The capacitor is discharged through a 
330-Ω resistor and the load via a discharge switch. Using this basic arrangement, pulses of a very 
short rise-time (less than 1 nsec) can be produced. Charging voltages ranging from 2 to 8kV and 2 
to 15kV for contact and air discharges, respectively, are specified. Further details of the required 
waveforms are given in the standard. Generators for this type of test are commercially available. 
Many factors, including environmental conditions, affect the rise-time of the injected current, as 
described in References 2 and 3.
IEC801 Part 42 describes tests for fast transients. These involve bursts of fast pulses with a rise￾time typically of 5 nsec and repetition rate of 5kHz. A burst lasts for 15 msec and is repeated every 
300 msec. Severity levels ranging from 0.5 to 4 kV are suggested. Testing involves special genera￾tors capacitively coupled to equipment cables.4
14.2.2  Receivers
In EMC testing, interference is measured using receivers of a specified bandwidth and detector 
function. The most common instruments used for this purpose are measurement receivers and spec￾trum analyzers. Several units may be necessary to cover the entire frequency range and they repre￾sent a significant investment. Measurement receivers have better sensitivity, higher dynamic range, 
and are less susceptible to overloads compared to a basic spectrum analyzer. The latter feature is due 
to the presence of a tuned preselector in the measurement receiver, which limits the total amount of 
power in the input mixer. A preselector and tracking generator may be added to a spectrum analyzer 
to obtain a performance comparable to that of a measurement receiver at a comparable cost. Hence, 
in many ways the two instruments offer similar performance. Two issues determine the configura￾tion of receivers for EMC measurements, namely, the bandwidth and the type of detector.
Clearly, the response of a receiver to a signal will be different depending on whether its band￾width is narrower or wider than the signal bandwidth. For a narrowband signal, such as an analogue 
radio signal, the amount of energy reaching the detector is independent of the receiver bandwidth 
(provided the spectrum of the narrowband signal is narrower than the receiver bandwidth). If this 
last condition is not satisfied, the signal is classed as wideband, and the energy reaching the detec￾tor depends strongly on the receiver bandwidth. Thus, in order to make meaningful comparisons 
between various tests, it is necessary to specify the receiver bandwidth used in the measurements. 
Complications arise depending on the exact nature of the broadband signal being measured.5 If the 
signal is noise-like (uncorrelated), an increase in bandwidth by a factor of 10 results in a tenfold 
increase in the energy reaching the detector, i.e., 10 dB. In contrast, in the case of a pulse with 
a spectrum consisting of a number of spectral lines phase-related to each other, increasing the EMC Measurements and Testing 297
bandwidth by a factor of ten increases the total voltage by the same factor and hence the energy 
reaching the detector by 20 dB. Receiver bandwidths are specified in international and national 
standards. As an example, CISPR Publication 16 specifies a 6-dB bandwidth in kilohertz of 0.2, 9, 
and 120 in the frequency ranges 10 to 150kHz, 0.15 to 30MHz, and 30 to 1000MHz, respectively.6
The nature of the detector function was discussed in Section 4.4, where it was explained that, 
depending on the choice of the charge/discharge components, the detector may respond to the 
peak, average, or any other measure of the signal. There are three basic types of detector function, 
namely, peak, quasipeak, and average. The detailed nature of these detector functions is described 
in References 6 and 7. The various standards specify different limits depending on the detector type. 
The peak detector has a fast response and it is used extensively for diagnostic testing. It is clear that 
the response of each detector type will be different for a pulsed signal with different repetition fre￾quency. Quasipeak and average type detectors require a long settling time (a substantial fraction of a 
second) at each frequency. Hence, when a wide range of frequencies must be covered, measurement 
time is quite long. The sweep rate must be selected so that the dwell time at each frequency is of the 
order of three time constants of the detector.
14.2.3 Field Sensors
In development and diagnostic work, it is often necessary to probe for the electric and magnetic 
field near transmission lines and individual circuit components. Similarly, it is often necessary to 
build up a picture of the field profile by numerous measurements using very small probes. Although 
such measurements are not specified by the various standards, they are nevertheless useful in giv￾ing an insight into the origin and mode of EM emissions. Several equipment manufacturers provide 
“sniffer” probes that are designed to respond to the near field from printed circuit tracks and other 
wiring. These give an indication of relative activity from various parts of a circuit, but cannot and 
should not be used to predict far-field performance. For the test engineer who wishes to develop in￾house probes, the rudiments of design of small field sensors are described below.
Field sensors are small because a detailed mapping of the field may be required and also to avoid 
disturbing the field being measured. A sensor is electrically small if its largest physical dimension is 
much smaller (say 1/20) of the longest wavelength of interest. In its simplest form, an electric field 
sensor is a small piece of wire protruding above a ground plane (small monopole). If this sensor is 
placed in an electric field E, the open-circuit voltage is V = leE where le is the effective length of 
the monopole. Normally, le is approximately equal to half the actual length of the monopole.8 The 
short-circuit current is similarly equal to I = Cle dE/dt, where C is the capacitance of the sensor. 
Thus, whether the sensor responds to electric field or its derivative depends on the impedance of the 
measuring instrument. If the time constant of the antenna capacitance with the measuring instru￾ment input impedance is longer than the field characteristic time, then E is measured. Otherwise, 
the arrangement responds to dE/dt. Various modifications can be made to change the response as 
described in Reference 8, but at the expense of the already very low sensitivity of small sensors.
A small loop is the dual to the electric field sensor and provides a magnetic field sensor. If a loop 
of area A is immersed in a magnetic field H, the open-circuit voltage is V = μ0 A dH/dt and the short 
circuit current is I = μ0 AH/L where L is the inductance of the loop. It is clear, therefore, that either 
the magnetic field or its derivatives are measured depending on circumstances. If the time constant 
of the inductance with the input impedance to the measuring instrument is much larger than the 
characteristic time of the field, then the arrangement measures the magnetic field. Various field sen￾sors have been developed to measure transient fields under hostile conditions and these may also be 
used as general instrumentation. Details may be found in References 8 and 9.
Another measuring arrangement that provides for very low distortion of the measured field by 
the measurement system is one based on a modulated scatterer. A very short piece of wire is used 
to probe the field. Incident fields are scattered by this wire and the scattered signal is received by 
a second antenna placed in the vicinity. This received signal contains complete information about 298 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
the amplitude and phase of the original incident wave. The only difficulty is that the scattered 
signal is very weak in amplitude. In order to increase the chances of detection, a photosensitive 
component is placed at the center of the short probing wire and its impedance is modulated by 
a modulated light signal supplied through a fiber-optic link. In this way the scattered signal is 
also modulated and phase-sensitive detection techniques may be used to increase the chance of 
detection of even very weak signals. The sensitivity of this arrangement is low at low frequencies. 
Details of this technique may be found in Reference 10.
14.2.4  Antennas
Antennas are specified almost exclusively as the primary field measuring transducer in most stan￾dards. Understanding their behavior in actual test environments is thus of paramount importance. 
The basic theoretical background to the characterization of antennas in terms of their gain, effective 
aperture, radiation resistance, etc., was presented in Section 2.3.2. From the practical measurement 
point of view, the single most important parameter of an antenna is its antenna factor,11 defined as
( )
( ) AF = incident electric field E in V/m
voltage measured at the receiver V in V

(14.1)
with the parameters defined shown in Figure 14.1a. Normally, the antenna factor is expressed in 
decibels, i.e.,
AF( ) dB = − E d i L ( ) B   µ V/m V ( ) dB  Vµ (14.2)
Knowledge of the antenna factor and measurement of the receiver voltage permits the calculation 
of the electric field from Equation 14.2. Similar expressions apply for the antenna factor of antennas 
sensitive to the magnetic field.
The antenna factor may be calculated from first principles. It can be shown that for any antenna 
the effective aperture and the gain are related by the expression Ae = Gλ2/(4π). The antenna may be 
replaced by its Thevenin equivalent circuit as shown in Figure 14.1b. The maximum power available 
is that supplied to a conjugate load Z Z L T = * , and is therefore
Pmax T = V /4R 2

Equating the right-hand side terms in Equations 14.3 and 14.4 and substituting for Ae gives

where l G e T = λ R /( ) πZo is described as the effective length of the antenna. In order to calculate

As an example, the AF of a half-wavelength resonant dipole in free space may be obtained from its 
gain and impedance G ≃ 1.64, ZT ≃ 73 Ω.
12 Substituting in the expression for the effective length 
gives le ≃ λ/π. Substituting in Equation 14.6, assuming a receiver input impedance ZL = 50 Ω and 
expressing the frequency f in MHz gives
AF( ) dB 31.78 20 = + logf( ) MHz (14.7)
It should be noted that in this theoretical determination of the antenna factor it has been assumed 
that the antenna is oriented to give maximum response and also that the input impedance to the 
receiver has a specified value. It should be borne in mind that the AF will be different if any of 
these assumptions is invalid. The derivation leading to Equation 14.7 is based on the assumption 
that the resonant half-wavelength dipole is placed in free space and that the current distribution is 
sinusoidal. The latter assumption is good provided that the diameter of the antenna is very small. 
Inevitably, in practical measurements the antenna is not in free space as there is always, in close 
proximity, the ground and other structures. The proximity of the antenna to ground or other anten￾nas modifies its impedance. In the case of two antennas 1 and 2 as shown in Figure 14.2, the voltage 
at the terminals of antenna 1 is
V1 1 = + Z I 1 1 Z I 12 2 (14.8)
FIGURE 14.2 Coupled antennas (a) and their two-port equivalent (b).300 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
where Z11 is the self-impedance of antenna 1 (impedance value under free-space conditions) and Z12
is the mutual impedance between the two antennas. The impedance of antenna 1 is thus

12 (14.9)
Equation 14.9 makes clear that proximity effects must be taken into account in the calculation of Z1.
The antenna factor in Equation 14.6 remains constant only if le and ZT remain constant. Since 
in the case of close proximity between two antennas ZT = Z1, with Z1 given by Equation 14.9, 
it is clear that the antenna factor will vary with the relative position between the two antennas 
and with any other factor affecting the current ratio I / 2 1I particular application of these ideas 
is in the case of an antenna above a ground plane. Two cases may be distinguished of antennas 
polarized in the horizontal and vertical directions. The effect of currents induced in the ground 
plane can be represented by an image antenna placed symmetrically with respect to the ground 
plane. The original antenna and its image form a two- antenna system in free space and can thus 
be described using Equations 14.8 and 14.9. The current in the image antenna is chosen to satisfy 
the boundary conditions at the position of the ground plane and this requires that I / 2 1I 1 = − for 
vertical polarization and I / 2 1I 1 = + for horizontal polarization. It is clear from Equation 14.9 
that Z1 is affected by the height of the antenna above the ground plane and by its polarization. 
It also follows from Equation 14.6 that the antenna factor also depends on these parameters. 
Another matter of practical significance, which affects the antenna factor, is the presence of 
other components, such as cable and/or a balun between the antenna and receiver. A full char￾acterization of these components in terms of their S-parameters is necessary, as described in 
detail in Reference 13.
Antennas supplied by manufacturers are usually provided with a generic calibration, i.e., an 
antenna factor at different frequencies for this type of antenna. The antenna factor of the particular 
antenna supplied may deviate by several decibels from the generic value. For accurate measure￾ments, it is thus necessary to calibrate antennas using either approved test houses or in-house facili￾ties. There are basically three experimental techniques used for antenna calibration. In the standard 
field method a receiving antenna is calibrated against a calibrated transmitting antenna establishing 
a known field at a fixed observation point. Alternatively, an antenna of a known antenna factor may 
be used for calibrating other antennas in the standard antenna method. Finally, in the standard site 
method three uncalibrated antennas may be calibrated by doing three measurements between pairs 
of antennas. The accuracy of this calibration depends on the quality of the site, as discussed in detail 
in Reference 14. An alternative approach to antenna calibration is to use numerical simulation to 
establish the AF of an antenna-to-plane-wave illumination. This approach has been successfully 
applied, using the NEC computer code, to dipole and biconical antennas as described in Reference 
13. It should always be borne in mind that the proximity of antennas to conducting structures and 
their use in screened rooms affects their calibration. A discussion of the scale of these affects may 
be found in References 15 and 16.
A number of different antennas is in use for EMC measurements depending on the frequency 
range. At low frequencies, below 30MHz, it is common to use active antennas to achieve satisfac￾tory matching. For electric field measurements, a monopole antenna known as the 41-in rod antenna 
is in common use. Because of the size and frequency of operation of this antenna it is difficult to 
calibrate. An approach based on the simulation techniques described in Reference 13 has been 
found the most acceptable. For low-frequency magnetic field measurements loop antennas are com￾monly used and are calibrated in standard TEM cells.
At frequencies above 30MHz tunable half-wavelength dipoles may be used. Alternatively, 
broadband antennas may be employed to speed up measurements. In the range 30 to 300MHz the EMC Measurements and Testing 301
biconical antenna is most commonly used. Normally, it has a total length of 1.3m and an integral 
balun. Some designs exhibit a narrow resonance at approximately 278MHz due to internal reso￾nances in the cones. The addition of an extra wire inside each cone can reduce this resonance. For 
frequencies between 300 and 1000MHz a log-periodic antenna may be used. Above frequencies of 
1GHz, broadband horn antennas are employed.
14.2.5  Assorted Instrumentation
A number of other components are necessary for EMC testing. As already mentioned, a line imped￾ance-stabilizing network (LISN) is necessary for conducted interference measurements.6 The pur￾pose of the LISN is twofold: first to prevent HF interference from the mains supply contaminating 
the measurement of the EM noise emanating from the equipment under test; second, to present an 
approximately constant impedance looking toward the mains to noise current emanating from the 
EUT. This impedance is 50 Ω over the range of frequencies 150 kHz to 30MHz. The latter require￾ment is necessary since the impedance of the supply to HF currents varies widely depending on the 
location of the tests, and if this situation were allowed to persist it would result to poor repeatability 
of tests. A typical design of an LISN is shown in Figure 14.3. The resistors RN are 50 Ω and repre￾sent the input impedance of the measuring instrument (spectrum analyzer, receiver). The isolation 
of the measurement set up from EMI originating from the power network is accomplished by com￾ponents C3, L1 and L2, C2. The large inductor L4 isolates at HF the reference of the LISN from the 
supply earth (which is not “clean” at HF). Capacitors C1 are a DC block to protect the measuring 
instrument from overload and L3 discharges these capacitors should the measuring instrument (and 
hence the 50-Ω resistor) be disconnected. With this arrangement the conducted emissions originat￾ing from the EUT are measured across 50 Ω. It is clear that inductors L1 and L2 must be rated to 
carry the full supply load at 50 or 60Hz. This makes for a bulky and expensive design (especially 
for three-phase large loads). For this reason techniques were developed to achieve the same aims as 
the LISN but using a simpler and cheaper probe.17

input impedance (typically 50 Ω) of the measuring instrument.302 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility

current on the reference conductor is 100 dBμA. Calculate the LISN voltage.

Other items, such as ferrite clamps and current probes, can be placed around cables to measure

Measurement of fast pulses requires broad bandwidth oscilloscopes. In Equation 4.15 we have 
seen that the description of a signal in the frequency and time domains results in a relationship 
between duration and bandwidth. In measurements, it is necessary to provide adequate band￾width in order to measure accurately fast rise-time pulses. In traditional analogue instruments, 
where a number of circuit elements are joined together, we obtain a response that is Gaussian in 
nature. Under these circumstances the rise-time and bandwidth of the oscilloscope are related by 
the approximate formula
RT 0.35  / BW

the issues involved is given in Reference 18.
14.3 TEST ENVIRONMENTS
EMC measurements are normally performed in open-area test sites, in screened rooms, or in special 
test cells. Standards specify in some detail the basic requirements for each type of test environment 
and the experimental procedures to be followed. The problems encountered in EMC measurements 
in these different environments are described below.
14.3.1  Open-Area Test Sites
An ideal open-area test site (OATS) consists of a perfectly conducting ground plane of infinite 
extent, free from all obstructions, with very low levels of ambient electromagnetic noise. Actual 
OATS depart in significant ways from this ideal. They are nevertheless used extensively, especially 
for commercial EMC measurements.
In selecting an OATS, a flat ground area is necessary, of sufficient extent to approximate the 
properties of an ideal site (infinite plane). Assuming that a finite flat area is all that can in practice 
be available, it is required that the difference in path length between a ray leaving a transmitter and 
reaching a receiver, after reflections from the center of the flat area and from its edge, should be 
equal to at least half a wavelength. This is the so-called first Fresnel zone. Negligible contributions 
to the received signal are made from reflections outside this zone.19 The lower the frequency and 
the higher the receiver and transmitter are placed above the ground plane, the larger the size of the 
first Fresnel zone will be and hence a large flat area is required. CISPR regulations specify that the 
flat area is at least an ellipse having major and minor axes equal to 2L and 3L, respectively, where 
L is the distance between receiver and transmitter. Typically, this distance is either 3, 10, or 30m. 
FIGURE 14.5 Frequency response of a 1-GHz bandwidth scope with a 4-GHz sampling rate.304 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Ideally, this flat area should also be perfectly conducting. In practice, a somewhat smaller metal￾lized area constructed out of wire-mesh material is used. The mesh must be made out of material 
that does not corrode, of a welded loop construction, with a loop diameter smaller than one tenth of 
the smallest wavelength of interest. The mesh must make good electrical contact with the undersoil 
and surrounding area. The required flatness depends on the frequency of operation and the distance 
between transmitter and receiver and it is typically a few centimeters for test frequencies up to 1GHz.
Understanding measurements in OATS requires a grasp of the fact that the signal at the observation 
point is the combination of signals arriving directly and after reflection from the ground, as shown 
in Figure 14.6a. Calculations are performed by replacing the ground plane by an image antenna, as 
shown in Figures 14.6b and c for vertical and horizontal polarizations, respectively. The direction of 
current flow in the image antenna is dictated by the boundary conditions on the ground plane and 
results in image currents that, in broad terms, strengthen (for vertical polarization) and weaken (for 
horizontal polarization) the original antenna current. The total field at the observation point is that due 
to two antennas at distances r1 and r2 and may be calculated, for short dipoles, using formulae derived 
in Chapter 2. The two contributions differ in amplitude and in phase and it is clear that under particular 
circumstances the two signals may be added constructively or destructively. For a particular observa￾tion point and the same radiator strength, the response at low frequencies is higher for vertical polar￾ization by approximately 10dB. As r1 and r2 become comparable to the wavelength, phase differences 
become important and the total signals for vertical and horizontal polarizations become comparable 
in magnitude. At even higher frequencies a strong interference pattern is observed.
Before any OATS may be used to make EMC measurements, its suitability must be established 
by comparison to an ideal or standard test site. This is done by measuring the site attenuation 
(SA) and the normalized site attenuation (NSA) and comparing with values for an ideal site.20,21
These two quantities are defined by the following expressions

is the minimum value measured as the receiving antenna is scanned over a specified range of 
heights hz (Figure 14.7b), and AFT, AFR are the antenna factors of the transmitting and receiving 
antennas, respectively. Scanning the receiving antenna is necessary in order to take account of 
the interference between direct and reflected waves. The antennas used in these measurements 
are normally resonant dipoles connected to 50-Ω systems. The site is considered acceptable if its 
NSA is within ±4 dB of the theoretical NSA. Details of this measurement and tables of the theo￾retical NSA may be found in Reference 21. A detailed examination of the inaccuracies involved 
in the measurement of site attenuation and methods of improving these measurements may be 
found in Reference 13.
Once an OATS has been found to be acceptable, the test procedure for a radiated emission test 
follows well-defined lines. The EUT is placed on a table 0.8m in height and the measurement 
antenna is placed at a specified distance (3, 10, or 30m) from it. The height of the antenna is varied 
between 1 and 4m (or between 2 and 6m for the 30-m range) and the EUT is rotated until maximum 
emission is observed. The test is repeated for horizontal and vertical polarizations. The tests are 
speeded up considerably if the EUT is placed on a turntable, the antenna is mounted on a mecha￾nized mast, and the entire instrumentation, including the receiver, is under software control. Such 
systems are commercially available, but at a substantial cost.
A comparison of testing requirements to different standards (FCC, ANSI C63.4, EN55022/
CISPR 22) may be found in Table 3 of Reference 22.

14.3.2  Screened Rooms
Open-area test sites have several disadvantages and this has led to a search for alternative EMC test 
environments. Among these disadvantages are the difficulty of ensuring a clean EM environment, 
dependence on the weather, and land costs. In the case of immunity tests, it is also difficult to avoid 
interfering with other users of the EM spectrum. Most military standards, immunity, or general 
diagnostic measurements, are therefore made in screened rooms. A screened room is an all-metal 
structure where all access for personnel, electrical, or mechanical services is designed in such a 
way as to provide a high degree of electromagnetic isolation up to very high frequencies. A well￾designed screened room can be used for emission and immunity measurements without any EM 
interaction with the external environment. Screened rooms may in turn be distinguished as rever￾berating and anechoic types. In the former case all the internal surfaces of the room are unlined and 
highly conducting and the room is thus an electromagnetic cavity. Any EUT or antenna placed in 
this room interacts with the conducting surfaces in a complex manner. An empty rectangular cavity 
exhibits resonances at specific frequencies obtained from the formula given below:
( ) = 


(14.12)
where a, b, and c are the internal room dimensions in meters and m, n, and p are integers with no 
more than one being zero. Typical room dimensions range from a few meters to a few tens of meters. 
The lowest resonant frequency depends on room dimensions and is generally of the order of a few 
tens of megahertz. Small rooms can be used to test small table-top products, whereas large rooms 
are used to test complete vehicles and may be equipped with dynamometers to exercise the vehi￾cles. The electromagnetic field structure at each resonant frequency, obtained from Equation 14.12 
(modes of the cavity), can be determined and depends on the numerical values of the indices m, n, 
and p. Thus, mode TE101 refers to a mode in which the vertical component of the electric field has a 
maximum on a line running from the center of the floor to the center of the ceiling (y-axis). Higher￾order modes exhibit a more complex structure. The presence of resonances with pronounced field 
minima and maxima at particular frequencies make measurements in reverberating rooms difficult 
to interpret. In order to improve matters, the walls and ceiling may be lined with RAM to drastically 
reduce reflections. The resulting anechoic room has properties akin to those of an OATS. Various 
materials can be used as RAM, but some reflections remain, especially at low frequencies. Thus, 
most rooms, especially at low frequencies, can only be described as partially anechoic or highly 
damped. Each room type is described in more detail below.
Reverberating Rooms — A typical test arrangement specified in military standards is 
shown in Figure 14.8. The EUT is placed on a conducting bench, which is bonded to 
the room walls. A conducting extension to the bench may also be fitted to accommo￾date a rod antenna. Depending on the room height, the extension may be offset toward 
the ground to leave adequate clearance for the rod antenna. Biconical and log-periodic 
antennas are generally mounted on a mast. In military standards, a distance of 1m is 
specified between the EUT and the measurement antenna. The presence of the bench, 
extension, EUT, and antenna disturb the resonant pattern inside the room. Small shifts 
from the resonant frequency values obtained from Equation 14.12 are observed and the 
presence of the bench introduces new resonances. At low frequencies, understanding of 
the measurement may be achieved by resorting to lumped-circuit concepts. At frequen￾cies for which the largest room dimension is smaller than λ/10, quasistatic concepts may 
be applied, whereby the coupling between EUT, antenna, and the room is essentially 
capacitive or inductive.5 At higher frequencies and below the first resonant frequency EMC Measurements and Testing 307
of the room, coupling between the EUT and antenna is more complex. Apart from the 
direct coupling (capacitive or inductive) between the two, a further coupling TEM mode 
is established. This propagates on a coaxial line formed by the bench extension (inner 
conductor) and the room side walls (outer conductor). This line is terminated by a short 
circuit (back wall) and an open circuit (end of extension). The EUT couples capacitively 
and/or inductively with the line and the rod antenna forms a capacitive load near the 
open-circuit end. Further details of these models and comparisons with measurements 
may be found in References 23 and 24.
At even higher frequencies, the presence of cavity resonances makes the coupling 
mechanisms difficult to follow in detail and progress can only be made by resorting to 
sophisticated numerical modeling techniques. It is generally anticipated that measurement 
uncertainties in this complex environment can amount to up to ±40dB. As a result there 
is little correlation between the same measurements taken inside different screened rooms 
or in an OATS.
The effect of resonances may be reduced by rotating an electrically large metal blade 
(size ~λ) in an arrangement known as a mode-stirred cavity as described in section 14.3.3.25
Anechoic Rooms — Improvements to the uncertainty of measurements in a reverberating 
chamber can be made by lining the walls and ceiling with absorbing material (RAM). Two 
types of material are used for this purpose, namely, carbon-loaded polyurethane foam in 
the shape of pyramidal cones and ferrite tiles. Several manufacturers provide such materi￾als with low reflectivity, typically in the range −20 to −40 db. For the pyramidal RAM to 
be effective, its thickness must be a substantial fraction of a wavelength. At low frequen￾cies this becomes impractical and uneconomical. In small rooms the reduction in working 
volume is unacceptable and in large rooms costs are excessive. Thus, below approximately 
100MHz, rooms cannot be regarded as anechoic and it must be accepted that a substantial 
amount of reflection will be present. An alternative is to use ferrite tiles, which are particu￾larly effective at low frequencies. In broad terms, conventional RAM is associated with 
FIGURE 14.8 Typical test arrangement inside a screened room.308 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
electric field losses whereas tiles are associated with magnetic field losses. Ferrite tiles 
remain effective from approximately 30 to 1000MHz. In practice, a combination of fer￾rite tiles and pyramidal RAM is the most effective arrangement for a broadband anechoic 
room, but costs are very substantial. Antenna impedance measurements in an OATS and 
an anechoic room show little difference, but significant differences in site attenuation are 
observed at low frequencies where resonances persist in the anechoic room.26 Significantly 
higher transmitter power is required inside an anechoic room compared to a reverberating 
room in order to establish the same electric field for immunity testing.27
The costs associated with a fully anechoic room and the difficulties that still persist at 
low frequencies have provided the impetus for examining other strategies for RAM place￾ment and room damping. In essence, the difficulties are associated with the first one or two 
room resonances, which, depending on room size, occur below about 100MHz. The struc￾ture of the first few modes is a rather simple one and it is possible to identify areas on the 
walls and ceiling where there are field maxima. RAM is then placed where the maxima 
occur, thus introducing substantial damping at low cost.28 Other strategies may also be 
implemented where blocks of RAM are placed in the room away from the walls at the loca￾tion of field maxima for particular modes. In practice it is only possible to damp in this way 
the first one or two resonances. A modest amount of RAM is then placed on the walls and 
ceiling in the normal way to deal with higher-order resonances. This approach has been 
found to be cost effective and offers excellent performance down to very low frequencies. 
Tests done in screened rooms damped in this way and in OATS have given comparable 
results within ±6dB.29
The idea of damping resonances in screened rooms and in equipment cabinets is also 
explored in References 30 and 31. Systematic studies of damping screened rooms using 
numerical models and comparing with measurements were done by the Nottingham group 
and the National Physical Laboratory.32,33 A selection from these results is shown here 
to illustrate the power and accuracy of these models. The studies were done in a room 
of dimensions 4.9×7.1×4.8m3 for a number of different damping materials and antenna 
polarizations. In each case the normalized site attenuation (NSA) was measured or obtained 
from simulations. The results are shown in Figures 14.9 to 14.13. The first two figures show 
results for a fully ferrite tiled room for horizontal and vertical polarizations. Figure 14.11 
shows results when the floor is not lined and the antenna is horizontally polarized. Figure 
14.12 shows a fully lined room up to 1GHz. Figure 14.13 shows results for a fully lined 
room with wood- backed tiles. In all cases we see that the numerical model predicts very 
well the response of the room. Such studies can be used to optimize room performance.

14.3.3  Reverberating Chamber Basics
In the previous section, we described screened rooms and the inevitable resonances that make 
accurate repeatable measurements difficult. By lining the conducting walls fully or partially, the 
room can be made anechoic and thus resemble, to a degree, free space. It may come as a surprise 
that the same resonances that we have previously found problematic can be suitably exploited 
to make a good test environment. The difficulty with resonances is that they introduce strong 
field nonuniformities at particular distinct frequencies and in particular locations in the room. 
Therefore, the location of the EUT and/or test antenna and the test frequency all have a strong 
influence on the quality of the measurement. If we were able to have a situation where there are 
many resonant frequencies close together and if the geometry of the room was varied in time to 
spread the location of field maxima and minima, then no frequencies or locations in the room 
would be particularly favored. This is the idea behind the reverberation chamber: we maximize 
the number of resonances and by a rotating “paddle” we perturb the chamber geometry and thus 
“stir” the resonant modes (mode-stirred chamber).
A schematic configuration of a mode-stirred chamber is shown in Figure 14.14. A shaft with 
a paddle attached to it rotates during the measurement so that the shape of the room changes and

conducting walls should be at least a quarter of a wavelength.EMC Measurements and Testing 311
therefore resonances do not always occur at the same locations. In order for the stirrer to be effec￾tive, the size of the paddle must be considerable relative to the wavelengths of interest. A mode￾stirred chamber cannot work effectively at low frequencies as there are few resonances there for 
effective stirring and mixing. As a rule of thumb, stirring becomes effective at frequencies above 
three times the lowest resonance (f011).
In operation, the paddle rotates continuously, and measurements are taken and averaged at each 
frequency, then measurements are taken at the next frequency, and so on. Alternatively, the stirrer 
is fixed at one position and a swept frequency measurement is taken. Then the stirrer is moved to 
a new position, another swept measurement is taken, and so on. An average of measurements over 
all stirrer positions is then calculated (tuned operation). In a properly designed and operated mode￾stirred chamber the field is, on average, uniform in its working volume. It has equal energy flux 
in all directions and polarizations. Detailed requirements for measurements inside reverberation 
chambers may be found in Reference 34.
One of the earliest publications describing the use of mode-stirred chambers in EMC is Reference 35.
The theoretical treatment of fields inside a cavity is a complex matter as it involves sophisticated 
statistical techniques. The interested reader may consult publications in the literature, including 
References 36–40.
The basic elements of the theory of mode-stirred chambers are as follows. Consider that we 
have a one-dimensional structure of length t representing one of the sides of a conducting chamber. 
Following Reference 39, at a frequency f, the number of half wavelengths that can fit in while satis￾fying the boundary conditions is

where u is the speed of propagation in the medium inside the room (normally air). The number of

The number of modes can be obtained by calculating the volume of a sphere in a coordinate system 
where the three coordinates are the possible values of the integers m, n, p. Only one octant of this 
spherical volume may be included (positive frequencies) and the number should be multiplied by 2 
to account for two possible polarizations. The radius in this space is

We see that the number and density of modes depend on the chamber volume (ℓ3
). As an example 
the number of modes in a 20m3 chamber below 200 and 300MHz is 50 and 167, respectively. At 
300MHz the density of modes is 1.67×10−6 per Hz — there is at least one mode per MHz. This 
sets approximately the lowest usable frequency of this mode- stirred chamber. Larger chambers are 
necessary if a lower frequency of operation is required.
Another useful parameter is the Q-factor of the chamber. Wall losses are the main mechanism of 
lower Q, but the presence of EUT and test equipment also contributes. For a given input power into 
the chamber, the field strength is determined by the Q. Also, the sensitivity of the chamber in detect￾ing emissions is affected by Q. For pulsed measurement, it may be necessary to reduce Q (reduce 
the time constant of the chamber). Accurate calculation of Q is a complex matter.36,37 Assuming

where V and S are the volume and total surface are of the chamber, k is the wavenumber, and δ is 
the skin depth. In general, due to wall imperfections, such formulae predict a much higher Q than 
actually observed. In broad terms, in a small mode-stirred chamber an electric field of several tens 
of V/m can be generated at 1GHz from 1 W input power. In contrast, in an anechoic chamber with 
considerable damping, 10 W would be needed to generate fields of the same order.
14.3.4  Reverberating Chamber Characterization and Modeling
In this subsection, we look in more detail on some of the specific details of reverberation chamber 
design and some of the metrics used in their characterization. A more extensive coverage may be 
found in References 41–43. We also address the numerical modeling of reverberation chambers 
since, potentially, the many changes in chamber geometry during paddle rotation can make numeri￾cal modeling very tedious.
The desired field uniformity in a reverberation chamber is of a different nature to uniformity 
in an anechoic chamber. In the latter case, the field has the same value everywhere at any instant 
in time. In the former case, uniformity is understood in the statistical sense. At a particular instant in 
time, the field is not the same even within the working volume of the chamber. Only an averaging 
of the fields over all paddle (stirrer) positions will give uniformity. Naturally, the test volume where 
statistical uniformity holds is a sub-volume of the chamber as shown in Figure 14.14. Within the test 
volume, the field measured in emission tests, or the exposure of the EUT in immunity tests, is the 
same irrespective of the position of the antenna or the EUT.
Uniformity in reverberation chambers is achieved by exploiting the resonant modes of the chamber. 
The modes are determined by the chamber dimensions and boundary conditions to which the fields 
are subject inside the chamber. A rotating paddle changes the boundaries, thus introducing a plethora 
of boundary conditions during a complete rotation. Therefore, any means by which the boundary 
conditions can be changed can potentially result in an efficient reverberating chamber. The theoreti￾cal concept underlying the mathematical theories demonstrating statistical uniformity is ergodicity. 
The idea of ergodicity derives from statistical mechanics and in layman’s terms means that the states of 
an isolated systems mix well. Over a period of time, all possible states of an isolated system spread over 
the entire space. The term ergodic derives from the Greek words “ergon,” meaning work/energy, and 
“odos,” meaning path. Ergodicity implies that all possible paths (states) of a system are equally possible. EMC Measurements and Testing 313
The consequence of ergodicity is that instead of repeating tests at different locations in the chamber, 
we can do a test at a single location and, over time, the results for both types of test will be the identi￾cal. In statistical mechanics, ergodicity implies that averaging the velocity of a single particle over time 
gives the same result as measuring the velocity of all particles at an instant in time and working out 
the average (microscopic and macroscopic points of view). A more tangible illustration of ergodicity 
may be obtained from an example in Reference 44. Let us consider the question of working out the 
average daily consumption of a consumer. It makes sense to define the system we are working on, to be 
one representing a certain socioeconomic class. Then we have two alternatives: We can follow a single 
consumer over a number of days and work out the average daily consumption, or select a number of 
consumers from the same system (socioeconomic class), follow them for a day, and then then work out 
the average consumption. In the former case, we have a time average, and in the latter, an ensemble 
average. Ergodicity implies that the time and ensemble averages are identical. No a priori proof of 
ergodicity is possible, but the hypothesis holds for most common systems as shown from experience. 
The rotating paddle ensures good mixing of the modes. When the rotation is continuous, we have a 
mode-stirred chamber, and when discontinuous, a mode-tuned chamber. The modes in a chamber 
depend on many factors, such as the material; shape and dimensions of the walls or stirrer; and the 
position, type, and orientation of sources. Any one or more of these factors may be used to mix the 
modes and thus meet the ergodicity requirements. Hence, many types of reverberation chamber may 
be constructed. A fuller description of commonly available types is given below.42
There are essentially two approaches to mode stirring — mechanical and electronic. As already 
indicated, any approach to changing boundary conditions and hence mixing the modes can poten￾tially result in a usable reverberation chamber; hence, human ingenuity has resulted in many different 
designs. A selection of the most common mechanical mode stirring designs is shown in Figure 14.15.
We may use some form of a rotating paddle or distort the chamber walls to modify the boundary 
conditions. The most common design, mentioned in the IEC-61000 standard, is the Z-fold stirrer.45
The objective is always to improve uniformity and maximize working volume. To that end, 
several other designs of stirrers have been developed such as the bent-plate stirrer,46 irregular recon￾figurable stirrer,47 and the carousel stirrer.48
An alternative to the paddle, which does not reduce the working volume, is some form of wall 
distortion.49 A successful design in this category is the vibrating intrinsic reverberation chamber 
(VIRC).50,51 Here, the walls are made of a conducting cloth, which can be easily distorted to modify 
the boundary conditions. One advantage of this design is its relative portability and capacity to 
encompass large EUTs. Another possibility that exploits the properties of non-rectangular, curved 
walls is the so-called stadium chambers.52 Instead of a conducting cloth, a conventional conducting 
wall can be used covered by an oscillating conducting structure (a quasi-wall), thus enhancing the 
working volume of the chamber.42,53

We now address the available options for electronic stirring. It is obvious that mechanical stir￾ring can be inconvenient in that it occupies space inside the chamber and requires time and energy 
to reconfigure the walls and/or paddles. The question arises whether electronic stirring may offer 
a better alternative. There are various schemes for electronic stirring as shown in Figure 14.16.42
A monochromatic signal favors certain modes, and mode mixing must be achieved by other 
means. But a broadband signal (e.g., Gaussian) can excite many modes and thus offer advantages 
especially for immunity testing (frequency stirring).54 We may use a number of antennas, thus 
boosting modes which otherwise would be weakly excited. This is known as multiple antenna stir￾ring (MAS).55 Another approach is to attach randomly on the walls reactively loaded antennas 
which re-radiate with varying phase any incident signal, thus achieving mixing.56 We may also 
locate several sources on the chamber walls, fed through a switching network, to achieve mixing 
through random excitation.57 Finally, we may place conducting plates very near the chamber walls, 
which are connected to the walls through switches which are randomly opened and closed and thus 
modified the boundary conditions in an arrangement known as switch-stirred reverberation cham￾ber (SSRC).58 We see therefore that there are many options for mixing modes either mechanically 
or electronically, resulting in many realizations of reverberation chambers.42,59
We now examine the way the quality of a reverberation chamber may be assessed. There are a num￾ber of different metrics that may be applied to assess various aspects of reverberation chamber per￾formance. The discussion that follows is based on Reference 43, where further details may be found.
It is convenient to group quality metrics under four broad headings.
The central category of metrics refers to measures of field uniformity, meaning isotropy (uniform 
polarization) and homogeneity (uniformity in all space locations within the test volume). We have, 
therefore, uniformity metrics referred to as anisotropy and homogeneity standards.34,52,60
Another class of metrics refers to the statistics of the random variables describing field quantities 
inside the reverberation chamber. The measured probability distribution functions of all such ran￾dom variables must be close to the expected ideal distributions. Such metrics look at the moments 
of the distributions (mean and standard deviation), the actual form of the probability distribution 
functions (PDFs), and various goodness-of-fit measures.61,62
The aim of stirring is that the field distribution at each stirrer position differs substantially from 
the field distribution at the next stirrer position. Various forms of autocorrelation functions provide 
a measure of the field similarity.
63–65 The ratio of the maximum to the mean received power may 
also be used as a suitable metric.66,67
In multipath real environments encountered by modern communication systems, the received 
EM energy has line-of-sight and reflected components (diffuse components). Diffuseness may be 
assessed in the time and frequency domains. In the TD, the power delay profile of a received pulse 
and its moments are a suitable measure to assess the suitability of a chamber for wireless equipment 
testing.68 In the FD, the equivalent measure is the coherence bandwidth. It is expected that different 
frequency signals propagating in a reverberation chamber fade differently. However, frequencies 
close to each other share broadly similar propagation characteristics. The maximum frequency

band over which propagation is broadly similar (amplitude and phase are highly correlated — “flat” 
channel) is called the coherence bandwidth and can be used as a measure to assess the suitability 
of the chamber for channel testing.69,70 The coherence bandwidth is equal to the reciprocal of the 
multipath time spread.
The most suitable metric depends on the specific measurement or application. Reference to spe￾cific requirements will be made where appropriate in Part V of this book.
We now consider the numerical modeling of tests in a reverberation environment. While a direct 
method can be used whereby each stirrer position is modeled, this involves an unrealistically high 
number of numerical tests and is in practice to be avoided. Frequency stirring approaches are also 
possible, which involve a large number of numerical tests and frequency averaging which, however, 
may mask narrow frequency features in the response. A test volume terminated by absorbing bound￾ary conditions may be employed, excited several times with different plane-wave combinations thus 
establishing, on average, a uniform field. All these approaches are time-consuming and computa￾tionally intensive. We are therefore encouraged to seek simpler methods to model the reverberant 
environment. We explore here an approach based on a randomly connected boundary condition.71
The technique is based on the idea that we mix modes by changing the boundary conditions and 
is illustrated in Figure 14.17.
For simplicity, we show a 2D 3×2mesh of computational cells, each cell represented by a TLM 
node. The dotted line represents the outer boundary (chamber wall). Normally, when a pulse hits a 
boundary, it is reflected back into the mesh, but in order to enrich the modal structure, we transfer 
and re-inject this pulse to some other randomly selected parts of the boundary as shown by the 
dashed arrowed lines. This transfer is done without delay, and if we wish to represent a lossless 
boundary, the pulses can only be multiplied by plus or minus one. Values less than one represent 
losses and a finite Q-factor for the cavity. In this way, we may model a reverberant environment at 
a modest computational cost.
14.3.5  Special EMC Test Cells
A design capable of producing a plane EM field is the so-called transverse electromagnetic 
(TEM) or Crawford cell.72 The basic structure is shown in Figure 14.18 and it can be viewed as 
a modified stripline with sidewalls added. The dimensions of the cell and the two tapered sec￾tions are chosen so that a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω is maintained throughout. The cell 
may be used to establish a very uniform field as long as higher modes are not excited (h < λ/2). 
FIGURE 14.17 Schematic of randomly connected boundary conditions to model a reverberating environment.316 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The maximum size of the EUT is limited to h/3. The TEM cell can be used for emission and 
susceptibility tests. In the former case the signal received at a port may be related directly to 
measurements obtained in an OATS, as described in Reference 72. The electric field established 
from a source of voltage V is E = V/h and the power required is (Eh)2/50. These cells are a very 
economical arrangement for immunity testing. TEM cells, which are large enough for whole 
aircraft testing, are described in Reference 73.
Another arrangement used for EMC testing is the gigahertz transverse electromagnetic 
(GTEM) cell, shown schematically in Figure 14.19.74 It consists of a tapered transmission line 
that is terminated by a distributed 50-Ω load and RAM. Careful design ensures the setting up of 
a spherical wave without exciting higher-order modes up to very high frequencies. The maximum 
working size of the EUT is again limited to a third of the septum height. The septum is offset, 
as shown, to increase the working volume. The GTEM cell can be used in a similar way as the 
TEM cell. Both cells are useful for testing small- to medium-sized equipment and for accurate 
calibration of small transducers.
Requirements for field uniformity and for testing are presented in Reference 75.
A thorough discussion of issues related to the use of the GTEM cell for EMC testing is presented 
in References 76 and 77. The GTEM cell can be used for immunity studies by feeding the single 
port without the need for a transmit antenna. Compared to an anechoic room the same field can be 
achieved with less power. Similarly, for emission studies the field is inferred by measurements at 
the port of the cell; no receive antenna is required. For complete characterization of emissions, the 
EUT needs to be rotated around three orthogonal axes. The main field components coupling the 
EUT and the GTEM cell are the vertical electric field and the magnetic field normal to the paper 
(Figure 14.19). However, small cross-polarized field components are also present and in this respect 
the cell is inferior to an anechoic chamber.

EMC in Systems Design
In Parts I to IV, we considered the traditional EMC topics concerned with the design and certification 
of commercial equipment to comply with EMC standards and regulations. Increasingly, EMC has 
to be seen in the context of recent developments in the design of information technology equipment 
and of the widespread use of wireless technologies for voice, data communications, and connectivity 
on the move of all kinds.
The very fast clock rates used routinely in equipment design make it now impossible to regard 
EMC issues as divorced from general signal integrity considerations. The issues of interoperability 
of systems and EMC are closely allied and special attention must be paid to developments in this 
area in connection with new wireless technologies. Traditional low-frequency networks (e.g., the 
telephone and power networks) are used to carry high-frequency signals and consideration must 
be given to the EMC impact of such practices. Many safety-critical controls are increasingly actu￾ated electronically and issues of EMC and safety need to be brought into focus. The complexity of 
modern systems means that we need to consider alternative ways of characterization and modeling 
based on statistical techniques.
In this final Part V of the book, we address all these issues and also point out some of the spe￾cific challenges encountered in different industrial sectors such as automotive, railway, aerospace 
and marine.
We conclude with we brief tentative look into the likely future developments in EMC.

15 EMC and Signal Integrity (SI)
15.1 INTRODUCTION
We have presented in previous chapters the main requirements for ensuring the electromagnetic 
compatibility of equipment and ways that compliance with standards and regulations may be 
achieved. Signal integrity is the discipline concerned with the maintenance of the shape, amplitude, 
and timing of signals as they propagate through complex networks, most notably in multilayer 
printed circuit boards (PCBs) or printed wire boards (PWBs) consisting of interconnects, pas￾sive components, and monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) or, as they are commonly known, chips. 
Integrated circuits convert DC power supplied to them to pulses, and therefore high-frequency sig￾nals, and are the main sources of interference in much electrical and electronic equipment. Boards 
are constructed from several layers of insulation and metalization to carry signals and DC power 
and provide a reference (ground planes). A typical configuration is shown in Figure 15.1.1 Several 
similar stacks may be connected onto the same mother board. Each component in this figure is a 
complex electrical structure, especially the chip and the multichip module (MCM), which consists 
of several chips. It is clear that each component has complex electrical characteristics and it affects 
in a different but significant way the integrity of propagating signals and EMC. A full analysis of 
such a system at high frequencies is a forbidding task. A further insight into the inherent complexity 
of such systems is shown in Figure 15.2. Here, a multilayer PCB is depicted2 consisting of a number 
of pre-impregnated (prepreg) layers (a partly cured mix of resin and glass fiber) and fully cured 
prepreg layers with copper foil attached to form the cores (laminates) carrying signals and provid￾ing power and ground planes. The complete PCB is formed by heating the entire assembly under 
pressure so that the partially cured prepreg flows and bonds to the laminates. Vias are also provided 
to carry signals from one layer to another. Each of these components carries high-frequency signals 
and thus is effectively an unwanted antenna receiving and dispersing EM radiation to its neighbors 
and beyond. The problem is particularly acute with the current and projected clock rates of several 
gigahertz. One of the objectives of good EMC design is the minimization of emission at source, 
hence the design of chips must be subject to the same EMC discipline as any other circuit com￾ponent. The reverse is also true, i.e., the EMC behavior affects signal integrity. A check list of the 
items to watch for in EMC and SI is shown below.3
In EMC one wishes to control:
• Emissions
• Penetration and crosstalk
• Susceptibility
• Cost, size, weight
In SI one wishes to control:
• Signal amplitude, shape, delays, timing
• Crosstalk
• Power dissipation
• Costs, silicon and board area, layout
We see that the two disciplines are related and strongly coupled, hence it is evident that EMC 
and SI have to be addressed in parallel so that efficient and effective designs may be developed. 
Crucial to SI is the issue of timing. This can be explained with the aid of Figure 15.3, which shows 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-20324 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
(a) a driver and a receiver and (b) the associated clock and data pulses. The driver is clocked and 
it takes a short delay Tco for the circuit to respond and the sent data to appear at the start of the 
interconnect. Due to the finite propagation velocity of waves on the interconnect (typically 2/3 of 
the speed of light), it takes the transit (or flight) time Tflight for data to reach the receiver. The flight 
time includes in addition to the actual propagation time any further delays caused by distortions 
to the signal’s edge. The data at the receiver is sampled at the clock edge. For this operation to be 
performed properly the received data must be present and stable for a short time interval before 
this transition (setup time Tsu) and after it (hold time Th). Clearly, in order for the data to be clocked 
FIGURE 15.1 A typical stack of components onto a motherboard.
FIGURE 15.2 A typical arrangement of a multilayer board.EMC and SI 325
properly at the receiver, the clock period Tclk and the other time intervals in Figure 15.3 must sat￾isfy the following inequalities:
+ < −
+ + > +
T T T T
T T T T T
co flight clk su
co flight data clk h
(15.1)
These inequalities can be converted to equalities if we introduce setup and hold margins to obtain

(15.2)
The second expression in (15.2) may be simplified if we assume that Tdata and Tclk are equal, to obtain
Tco + = T T flight h − ( ) hold margin (15.3)
FIGURE 15.3 (a) Typical interconnect and (b) timing of signals at points A, B, C.326 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Equations 15.2 and 15.3 represent a somewhat ideal situation. We must also recognize that there are 
variations in the time of flight and in Tco, that all clock periods are not exactly the same (clock jitter), 
and that not all devices are clocked at exactly the same time (clock skew). Furthermore, the data are 
subject to alterations due to reflections, crosstalk, and coupling from external fields, in what we will 
refer collectively as “coupling” effects. The first expression in Equation 15.2 can thus be put in the 
following form:
Tclk c = + T T o flight + + T s su ( ) etup margin s + + kew jitter + coupling (15.4)
The last three terms on the RHS may be positive or negative. Equation 15.4 shows the timing 
budget for the link shown in Figure 15.3. A reliable link with a low bit error rate (BER) demands 
that the three last terms in Equation 15.4 are well controlled. If we wish to increase the speed of 
the link (lower clock or cycle period Tclk) then every term on the RHS of Equation 15.4 must be 
reduced and controlled throughout the design. Jitter and skew are difficult to calculate and one 
has to rely on statistical estimates. The term described as “coupling” includes a multitude of phe￾nomena that are in the domain of the EMC engineer. We see from this discussion that without an 
adequate EMC design, Equation 15.4 can only hold if we accept generous margins, thus sacrific￾ing communication speed. The unpalatable alternative is to accept occasional malfunctions and 
thus an inferior BER. High-speed systems therefore require a good EMC design to satisfy strict 
timing requirements and a high level of reliability. SI and EMC go together at high data rates!
We have focused here on the timing as it is critical in SI studies. If timing requirements are not 
met, nothing works. Coupling effects also affect the amplitude of signals and if they breach noise 
margins then malfunctions should be expected. We have discussed this topic in Chapter 9. A good 
EMC and SI design maintains noise and timing margins under most conditions. Any breaches 
that sometimes occur may be dealt with by error detection and correction codes as mentioned in 
Section 12.3.1.
EMC problems are caused due to emissions from interconnects carrying sharp-edged sig￾nals. Broadly, we describe these effects as board-level EMC. However, emissions also originate 
directly from ICs (drivers) and these are the subject of chip-level EMC. In the next sections we 
will introduce some of the main ideas and analysis tools used for SI and EMC analysis in this 
environment. More extensive coverage may be found in the references already given and also in 
Reference 4.
15.2 TRANSMISSION LINES AS INTERCONNECTS
The importance of cable attachments to equipment (e.g., for supplying power, signaling, and con￾trol) as a means of EM emission and susceptibility is well known. It will come as no surprise, 
therefore, that interconnects in PCBs contribute significantly to emission and susceptibility prob￾lems, cause reflections and crosstalk, and are therefore responsible for many SI problems. Because 
of the crucial importance of interconnects we give here more details of the behavior of transmis￾sion lines to supplement the material presented already in Sections 3.2 and 7.2, and the example 
in Section 10.3.1.
We present two techniques for studying the pulsed response of lines and thus obtaining infor￾mation on reflections for discontinuities, voltage, and current distributions, etc. The approaches 
described are the Bewley lattice (or bounce diagram) and Bergeron techniques.5,6
A systematic account of the propagation of pulse on a transmission line linking a driver and a 
load can be given using the Bewley lattice, which is constructed as follows. Let us consider the sim￾ple interconnect shown in Figure 15.4 where we have replaced the driver by its Thevenin equivalent 
and the load (or receiver) by its input impedance. In order to keep matters simple, and thus facilitate 
understanding of the basic ideas, we limit for the time being the source and load impedances to be EMC and SI 327
purely resistive RG and RL respectively. The reflection coefficient experienced by pulses incident on 
the source and on the load are

where Z0 is the characteristic or surge impedance of the line. We assume that the source is a unit 
step voltage of amplitude VG and thus the Laplace transform of the source voltage is VG/s where s 
is the Laplace operator. We also select a line that is not matched at either end so that we can best 
observe the reflections. The line is lossless with a characteristic impedance R0 and the source and 
load resistances are 2R0 and R0/3, respectively

All terms in the bounce diagram of Figure 15.4 can now be calculated. The voltage at the termi￾nation is simply obtained by summing up the incident and reflected pulses, taking into account 
the time of their arrival. For example, the first incident and reflected pulse arriving at the load at 
time τ is

where the exponential term accounts for the delay (τ) in the arrival of this pulse. The form of this 
signal in the time domain is simply obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of Equation 
15.10 and since 1/s corresponds to a unit step pulse in the time domain and the exponential term 
represents a delay we see that the first pulse to arrive at the load has the form, u t , 1
6 ( ) − τ i.e., it is a 
step pulse of magnitude 1/6 arriving at the load at time τ. The voltage level at the load will remain 
unchanged until the next set of pulses arrives at time 3τ as shown in Figure 15.4. The new distur￾bance is given by

In the time domain, this represent a step voltage of amplitude −1/36 arriving after time 3τ. This is 
superimposed with the previous pulse of amplitude 1/6 as shown in Figure 15.5a. In this way all 
pulses arriving at the load are accounted for to give the following expression:

This expression is shown in Figure 15.5a for the first three sets of reflections (for clarity we have set 
VG =1 in the graphs). We note that the steady state voltage at the load is

We see that at time equal to 5τ the voltage at the load has reached the value VG (1/6−1/36+1/216)=VG
0.143, which is very close to the value calculated in Equation 15.13. Therefore, at 5τ the voltage at 
the load is very close to steady state. Current pulses are calculated by dividing the forward pulses 
(those traveling from source toward the load) by Z0 and the reflected pulses (those traveling toward 
the source) by −Z0. The current terms are then summed up to obtain the shape of the current in the 
time domain in exactly the same way as for the voltage. The current is shown in Figure 15.5b where 
we have multiplied by Z0 to make plotting easier. 
If we wish to obtain the waveforms for the voltage and current in another location along the line, 
we proceed in a similar way. As an illustration, we show the voltage and current waveforms at x=ℓ/3
in Figure 15.5c and d. We show this calculation for the first few voltage pulses. The first voltage 
pulse arrives at ℓ/3 at time τ/3 and it has amplitude F, i.e., Vg/3. The voltage remains constant until 
the first reflected pulse (FΓL) arrives at this location, which happens at time 2τ−τ/3=5τ/3. This 
pulse is equal to −1/6 and is superimposed on the previous pulse as shown in Figure 15.5c. The next 
time there is a change in voltage is when the first reflected pulse from the source end arrives there, 
which happens at 2τ+τ/3=7τ/3. Its amplitude is −1/18 and it is superimposed on the previous two 
pulses. The process continues until we have approached steady state sufficiently for further pulses 
to be of negligible magnitude.
In practical systems, impedances are not purely resistive and other components need to be taken 
into account. A common example is the case of a capacitive load, say CL. The procedure described 
FIGURE 15.5 Voltage (a) and current multiplied by Z0 (b) at the load for the configuration shown in Figure 
15.4. Voltage (c) and current (d) at x=ℓ/3.330 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
so far remains unchanged with the only proviso that the reflection coefficient at the load is not real 
but complex to account for the frequency dependence of the capacitive impedance:

where T=R0CL. Therefore, in the calculation of the Laplace transform of the signals and their 
inverse we need to take account, in addition to the source, the s-dependence of the load reflection 
coefficient in Equation 15.14. If we assume that the source is a step voltage as before and that the 
load is now a capacitor, the Laplace transform of the first set of pulse at the load is

A similar approach is applied for all the other pulses resulting inevitably in more complexity.
Another example is the junction between two lines with a different characteristic impedance 
as shown schematically in Figure 15.6. This occurs typically in a PCB where a track may change 
width, thus changing its characteristic impedance. We also introduce a lumped component at the 
junction for generality. The bounce diagram is shown in the same figure and the first few reflections 
FIGURE 15.6 Bounce diagram for an interconnect with two segments of different characteristic impedance.EMC and SI 331
are calculated from the first incident waveform F (obtained as before) and the corresponding reflec￾tion coefficients at all the discontinuities. We have assumed for simplicity that the transit time of the 
first line is 2τ and of the second τ. The reflection coefficients are

We see that a very complex pattern of reflections will occur. At t=6τ and at the junction of the two 
lines there are pulses arriving simultaneously from the left and from the right resulting in reflections 
from and transmission through the junctions. If the transit time of the second line is not exactly half 
of the first line, then very short pulses may results at this junction after superposition of the incident 
pulses coming from both sides.
A further example, which illustrates the complexity of propagation in this environment, is shown 
in Figure 15.7a. It illustrates a PCB with a ground plane, a substrate, and a track (characteristic 
FIGURE 15.7 Typical PCB configuration (a) and transmission line equivalent (b).332 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
impedance Z01), which distributes signal VG through a junction to two other lines Z02 and Z03. This 
typically could be a clock pulse train distributed to two drivers. The model of this configuration is 
shown in Figure 15.7b. Naturally, reflections take place at the source and load ends if the lines are 
not matched to their characteristic impedance. In addition, a substantial pattern of reflections takes 
place at the junction of the three lines. As an illustration, the reflection coefficient seen by pulses 
traveling on line one and arriving at this junction is

Similar expressions apply for the other two reflection coefficients shown in Figure 15.7b. A pulse origi￾nating from the source experiences a partial reflection at the junction and a part of it proportional to 
(1+Γ1) penetrates into lines 1 and 2. When these signals reach the respective terminations they suffer 
further reflections to arrive after a delay back at the junction for further reflection and penetration into 
line 1. So does the first pulse, which reflected at the junction back into line 1 and encountered the source. 
Therefore, there are in general three pulses incident at the junction, at different instants in time (depend￾ing on the electrical length of the three line segments) generating a complex pattern of reflections.
From these examples we see that the propagation of fast pulses (where the duration of the pulse 
is comparable or shorter than the line transit time) generates complex patterns due to reflections that 
may alter radically the shape and amplitude of the original pulse train. This clearly has implication 
for SI in terms of timing and logic state recognition. In addition, the generation of so many sharp￾edged signals traveling back and forth on interconnects of a length comparable to the wavelength 
does not bode well for control of emissions. It is inevitable that in this situation interconnects will 
radiate appreciable amounts of EM energy in addition to near-field coupling (crosstalk), addressed 
in Chapter 7 of this book. This creates EMC problems and also additional SI problems due to 
interference with other interconnects that are not part of the original transmission. It is therefore of 
considerable practical advantage to minimize reflections as far as possible by proper matching of 
all line segments carrying fast pulses. This is difficult to achieve in practice due to the nonlinear 
nature of loads (e.g., different high and low impedance) and the broadband nature of the termina￾tion required. Some examples are shown in Figure 15.8. In Figure 15.8a a resistive termination ZR
may be added when the input of the receiver is very high (e.g., capacitive). The disadvantage is that 
it draws DC current and that another component has to be added in an already very crowded board. 
An alternative is shown in Figure 15.8b where the effective terminating impedance is the parallel 
combination of the two resistive loads and the two values can be chosen individually to suit better 
the logic family properties. Finally, the arrangement in Figure 15.8c cuts down the DC current and 
hence power consumption, but it is difficult to implement in practice as it increases the component 
count. The capacitor may be implemented by parallel traces in a multilayer board and the resistor 
by a lower conductivity trace, but routing is difficult and expensive.
In PCB manufacture, several transmission line configurations are used: microstrip, embedded 
microstrip, stripline, etc. A stripline configuration (track between power and ground planes) is shown 
in Figure 15.9a and the electrical configuration in Figure 15.9b.2 We shall examine how the line is 
charged and discharged and this will give us the opportunity to see how the ideas presented above 
can be used in a situation where the line is initially charged. The starting point is the configuration 
shown in Figure 15.9b where the driver is shown schematically with an effective source resistance of 
50 Ω (the square boxes shown but not labeled) irrespective of the position of the switch. The supply 
voltage is Vcc=2.5V. The switch is in the lower position, as shown, for some time so that steady-state 
conditions prevail. Hence, the lower segment of the line is completely discharged while the upper seg￾ment is charged to a voltage V0=Vcc=2.5V. No currents are flowing anywhere in the system. We wish 
to ascertain conditions in the circuit as the driver drives high, i.e., the switch moves from position L EMC and SI 333

to position U. A full and accurate understanding of the redistribution of the field following switching 
needs solution of the full-field equations. However, we can gain a reasonable understanding of the pre￾vailing conditions by making some bold assumptions, namely that the upper and lower segments of the 
stripline behave as two independent transmission lines, each with a characteristic impedance Z0=100 
Ω. Conditions following switching are the result of the superposition of two actions. First is the dis￾charging of the top segment through the 50-Ω resistor (Figure 15.10a) and second is the charging of the 
lower segment through the 50-Ω resistor (Figure 15.10b). We examine each action separately. At the 
start of the upper segment the voltage and current must comply with the boundary condition there, i.e.,
VU U = −I 50 (15.18)

where we have recognized that the line was initially charged to V0 and that the initial value of the 
current was zero. Substituting for V0=2.5V and solving Equation 15.19 for the pulse voltage we 
obtain Vi
=−1.67V. Hence the current is −1.67/100=−16.7mA. This circulating current discharging 
the upper segment is shown schematically by a long-dash line in Figure 15.10a. Between the trace 
and the power plane is a displacement current (through the capacitance). We now turn our attention 
to the charging of the lower segment, which is depicted in Figure 15.10b. Since this line is initially 
uncharged, conditions are straightforward and the forward-propagating current pulse and associ￾ated voltage pulse are

The effective surge impedance is VT/IT ≈50 Ω. We see that the charging of the line is the result of 
current flows from different parts of the circuit and therefore that careful design is required to mini￾mize interference with other components sharing power and ground rails. 
So far we have limited the study to terminations that are linear at each part of the switching 
cycle. Where a pronounced nonlinearity is present an alternative technique is available: the so called 
Bergeron method. It was originally developed to solve problems in hydraulics (the water hammer 
effect) but is readily applicable to EM problems. We know that signals on a line are a combination 
of forward- and backward-traveling waves, i.e., functions of x±ut. We can write therefore

where f1, f2 are arbitrary functions. Adding the two expressions in Equation 15.22 we obtain
V() () x,t Z = = 0 1 I x,t 2f ( ) x u − t (15.23)
Similarly, subtracting we get
V() () x,t Z = = 0 2 I x,t 2f ( ) x u − t (15.24)
The implication of Equation 15.23 is that if x−ut is constant, then the value of the function f1 is 
constant and therefore V+Z0I is constant. The condition that x−ut=const. means that Δx−uΔt=0, 
or that Δx/Δt=u. An observer moving in the forward direction with the velocity of propagation u 
measures voltage and current such that V+Z0I=const. Similarly, an observer moving with veloc￾ity u in the backward direction measures V−Z0I=const. This important observation is the basis 
of the Bergeron method. Let us start with a simple example where we already know how to obtain 
the quantities on a bounce diagram, a line terminated by a resistive linear load as shown in Figure 
15.11a. The Bergeron method is applied using a V-I diagram representing the conditions on the 
line as shown in Figure 15.11b. On the V-I diagram we draw the curves representing the boundary 
conditions (BC) at the source and load ends of the line. At the source end A the voltage is constant 336 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
and equal to V0, the source voltage, as the internal resistance of the source is zero. At the load end 
B the BC is V=IR. The two BCs are shown in Figure 15.11b. The instant at which the source is 
connected to an initially uncharged line is t=0. An observer traveling in the forward direction sees 
V+IZ0=const. (see Equation 15.23), therefore ΔV/ΔI=−Z0. Hence, a forward-traveling observer 
appears on the V-I diagram on lines of slope −Z0. Similarly, a backward-traveling observer appears 
on lines of slope +Z0. The essence of the technique is to start an observer from a point on the line 
where we already know V and I (from the initial conditions), which arrives at the source end at t=0. 
Clearly, if we start a backward-traveling observer from the load end B at t=−τ it will have V=0, 
I=0, hence will start from the origin as shown in Figure 15.11b and trace a straight line of slope 
+Z0. This line intersects the BC at the source end at the point marked as A(0). The coordinates of 
this point are the voltage and current at the start of the line at t=0. The observer now travels in the 
forward direction and thus traces a line of slope −Z0. This line intersects the BC at the load end at a 
point marked as B(τ), its coordinates giving the voltage and current at the load end at time t=τ. Now, 
the observer travels backwards, thus tracing a line of slope +Z0 to intersect the BC at the source end 
at point Α(2τ), giving the conditions at the source end at time 2τ. The process continues as shown in 
the figure until steady state is reached at the intersection of the two BCs.
It is clear from this procedure that as long as we are able to plot the V-I conditions at the source 
and load ends we are can apply this technique. This is particularly useful for nonlinear loads. We 
illustrate this by an example where the configuration in Figure 15.11a is modified by adding a non￾zero internal source resistance RG and making the load resistance nonlinear with a V-I curve as 
shown in Figure 15.12a. In the same diagram we have plotted the BC at the source end of the line 
V=V0−IRG. The calculation proceeds as before by starting a backward-traveling observer at B (the 
origin in the V-I diagram) tracing a line of slope +Z0 until the intersection with the BC at A(0). The 
coordinates of this point give the voltage and current at the source end at t=0. The forward-traveling 
observer and the intersection with the load boundary condition at B(τ) give the conditions at the load 
at time τ. A backward travel and a forward travel identify the intersection B(3τ) with coordinates, 
the voltage, and current at the load at time 3τ. The process continues for as long as required. A 
schematic of the load voltage is shown in Figure 15.12b.
The conclusion from the calculations shown in this section is that propagation of fast pulses in 
PCBs is a complex phenomenon that affects strongly EMC and SI in a manner that strongly couples 
FIGURE 15.11 Example of the application of the Bergeron method (b) for the configuration shown in (a).EMC and SI 337
these two disciplines especially at high frequencies. Other factors, especially losses, skin effect, and 
proximity effects, can also affect propagation especially at very high frequencies.
Extensive literature is available covering transmission line theory, which may be consulted for 
more details.7−10 Numerical techniques were described in Chapter 7.
15.3 BOARD AND CHIP LEVEL EMC
The first systematic account of parasitic effects in PCBs and ICs was given in Reference 11. Since 
the publication of this book, substantial work has been published on a number of issues arising in 
this environment, especially over the last few years as increasingly high-speed systems are incor￾porated in a whole range of products. The purpose of this section is to highlight some of the major 
EMC and SI issues and techniques for tackling them. A full account of this rapidly expanding field 
cannot be given here and the reader should consult specialist texts on this subject.2,4
15.3.1  Simultaneous Switching Noise (SSN)
A typical problem arising in high-density high-speed circuits is shown schematically in Figure 
15.13. This is an example of a single-ended signaling arrangement where the signal fed to the driver 
is Vin−Vref as shown. The difficulty with this arrangement is that Vref is affected strongly by para￾sitic components in the ground track and by fast switching currents. It is clear from this diagram 
that Vref≈L di/dt where L is the inductance associated with the ground track and di/dt is the rate 
of change of the current. This current is due not only to the particular driver but also to all other 
driven lines. Moreover, other drivers that are not driven will experience a shift in their reference 
level. This is described as “ground bounce” and is the source of noise and interference in high￾speed circuits. This situation is familiar to EMC engineers and was described in connection with 
grounding in Section 10.3. Another example is shown in Figure 15.14. A similar effect is observed 
in connection with the supply rails, the so-called “supply bounce.” Since in modern circuits sev￾eral gates switch simultaneously, the current flow and therefore the bounce in shared paths can be 
considerable. A more complex example is shown in Figure 15.15. Here gate 1 drives gate 2 through 
an interconnect. We have marked out the current path when gate 1 makes a high-to-low transition 
and also when it makes a low-to-high transition. We see that the parasitic inductance of the power, 
signal, and ground tracks will generate undesirable voltage drops at one or both of the transitions. 
Remedies to this situation are the reduction to the magnitude of the switched current (smaller di), 
increase in transition time (larger dt), reduction of the parasitic inductances (wider traces or a bet￾ter transmission line configuration), or the addition of decoupling capacitors strategically placed 
FIGURE 15.12 Bergeron diagram (a) and voltage at the load (b) for the configuration in Figure 15.11a where 
we have added a source internal resistance RG and the load termination is now nonlinear.338 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
to supply pulse current locally without the need for the pulse current to come from afar. Two such 
decoupling capacitors are shown in Figure 15.15. The placement of these capacitors must be cho￾sen based on a clear understanding of the required current flows and paths so that pulsed current 
is supplied locally and thus voltage drops along long interconnects are minimized. It should also 
be borne in mind that capacitors are not ideal components and that they include a parasitic induc￾tive component (mostly due to their lead connections). The presence of this inductance negates to 
some extent the beneficial impact of the capacitance in supplying pulse current while maintaining a 
constant voltage. At high frequencies there may also be resonances between these stray inductances 
and capacitances, further complicating the proper design of the circuit. The general rule of thumb 
is to select decoupling capacitors with low inductance value (high resonance frequency), very short 
FIGURE 15.13 Ground bounce due to the voltage drop across L during the simultaneous switching of sev￾eral drivers.
FIGURE 15.14 Current flows through Lground and associated ground bounce.EMC and SI 339
lead connections to pins (preferably of surface mount technology), and typically of value 0.001 μF 
per module. Bulk tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a value ten times larger than the total value of 
decoupling capacitors are also placed around the board to provide an additional reservoir of energy 
for supplying current at a slower rate. 
A more radical alternative is to send the signal in such a way that it provides its own reference. 
This is shown schematically in Figure 15.16a.2 A differential transmitter sends the signal Vp and 
its complement Vn on two lines and therefore the differential receiver senses the voltage Vp−Vn as 
shown in Figure 15.16b. Any interference or common-mode signal couples on both lines in the inter￾connect and thus is canceled at the input to the differential receiver V1−V2. Because noise rejection 
is thus improved, the voltage swing can be dropped to a few hundred millivolts. Very fast transmis￾sion rates may be achieved in the GBits/s region. Several differential signaling standards are avail￾able including RS-422, RS-485, and low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS).12 The disadvantage 
of these schemes is that an additional track is required. 
FIGURE 15.15 The short dashed line shows current flow during the high-to-low transition, and dash-dotted 
line for low-to-high transition. The two capacitors provide decoupling.

15.3.2  Physical Models
Physical models of ICs can be constructed in the normal way using lumped circuit components, 
distributed components, or full-field formulations based on Maxwell’s equation. The challenge in 
doing this is handling the extreme complexity of practical systems. As the frequency increases, 
more sophisticated techniques are required to model particular ICs, their packaging, interconnects, 
and boards. Full rigorous system models and simulations are extremely complex and beyond current 
capabilities. The best approach is to develop a hierarchy of models starting from low frequency up 
to the highest frequencies. In Figure 15.1, the complexity in the assembly of modern integrated cir￾cuits was indicated. In Figure 15.17, two ways of attaching a chip to a package are shown. In Figure 
15.17a, the so-called wire bond is shown, which is easy to route and has good thermal and mechani￾cal properties. Its inductance is variable and difficult to calculate and ranges between 1 and 5 nH. In 
Figure 15.17b, an alternative connection is shown. The chip is mounted upside down (flip chip) with 
the pad at the bottom connected to the package through solder balls. This arrangement has smaller 
inductance (approximately 0.1 nH) and allows a denser interconnect pattern (lower minimum pitch, 
as low as 100μm), but has a poorer thermal behavior. More complex arrangements are in use, such 
as stacking more chips on the same package. Attempting to model this level of detail, in a situation 
with a large number of chips and packages populating a large multilayer board with a multitude 
of interconnects, in order to deal with the full range of EMC and SI issues is a daunting task. We 
give a brief introduction of the methodology appropriate in each case based on an example given in 
Reference 13.
We have seen that keeping the magnitude of the power distribution impedance low is highly 
desirable in minimizing ground and supply bounce and an important factor in keeping interference 
levels low. This is easy to see as the power distribution network in the PCB environment is exten￾sive and all pervading. Figure 15.18 shows a schematic of this impedance versus frequency for a 
large processor. The dotted curve is what one would expect from theoretical considerations. At low 
frequencies, inductance is not important and the dominant component is capacitance; hence, imped￾ance falls with increasing frequency. With rising frequency, there comes a point when inductance 
cannot be neglected and therefore impedance rises with frequency giving the characteristic inverted 
bell-shaped curve. Measurements, however, show a behavior closer to the one depicted by the solid 
curve. Here, we observe clear resonances, and the task of the designer and modeler is to establish 
the upper bounds for |Z| and make sure that it is kept below the design limit. We will sketch out 
how this challenge may be met. There are three frequency regimes where we are able to make a 
different level of approximation. First, to predict behavior at low frequencies (kilohertz range), we 
can neglect inductances and only account for resistances and capacitances associated with bulk and 
decoupling capacitors. Pulses that contribute energy in this part of the spectrum are relatively long 
in duration (100s μs) and therefore propagate over a large part of the physical extent of the circuit. 
Therefore, their parameters are affected by all parts of the circuit, and as a consequence, we must 
model the entire circuit. A schematic of such a model is shown in Figure 15.19. In a realistic problem, 
a very large number of components will result, giving a cumbersome circuit to characterize. Similar 
problems arise as one tries to tackle problems at higher frequencies. In mathematical parlance, the 
FIGURE 15.17 Wire bond (a) and flip-chip (b) configurations.EMC and SI 341
problem possesses a large number of degrees of freedom (the order of the model is very high), mak￾ing the solution computationally very expensive to achieve. However, not all degrees of freedom are 
important in determining system response with an acceptable accuracy. Mathematical techniques 
are available to reduce the order of a model without significant loss in accuracy. The approach is 
known under the collective name of model order reduction (MOR) technique. More details may be 
found in References 14 to 16. 
As we move to higher frequencies in the MHz range, the details of the packaging of the multichip 
module (MCM) and the board must be included. Inductance is important, but effects involving 
delays and time retardation can be neglected. Since pulses contributing to this part of the spectrum 
have a shorter duration (100s ns), conditions at a particular location are only affected by the circuit 
within a radius uτ (where u is the speed of propagation and τ the pulse duration), thus making it 
possible to make some simplification. A typical model is shown in Figure 15.20. The board may be 
modeled by a two-dimensional array of L and C components as shown in Figure 15.21. Each node 
FIGURE 15.18 Power distribution impedance as a function of frequency.
FIGURE 15.19 Low-frequency noise model.342 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
represents a part of space typically (λ/20)×(λ/20), where λ is the wavelength at the highest fre￾quency of interest. Models of decoupling capacitors, pins, and vias may be added to this model. The 
level of accuracy required depends on specific requirements and on frequency. A lumped circuit 
model of a via has the form shown in Figure 15.22a. A full-field model of a via is shown in Figure 
15.23. The figure shows the magnetic field associated with the Gaussian-shaped current pulse as 
it negotiates its way through the via. It shows clearly how the barrel of the via acts like a radiator 
causing emissions that couple to adjacent components. A track with a sharp bend can be modeled by 
a straight transmission line with a lumped capacitor as shown in Figure 15.22b. More sophisticated 
models of bends that include emissions and signal distortion and yet maintain a measure of model 
simplicity are described in Reference 17. 
For higher frequencies in the hundreds of MHz range, details of the chip and package must be 
included with full account of distributed R, L, C, and transmission line effects. Many of these param￾eters require three-dimensional calculations and are difficult to perform. One significant difficulty is 
that the details that may allow a full calculation to be made are not available as this would reveal propri￾etary material with substantial intellectual property loss. A schematic model is shown in Figure 15.24.
A model of the chip at very high frequencies must take account of different modes of propaga￾tion, which depend on the resistivity of the substrate and the importance of the skin effect in propa￾gation. In order to give a taste of the complexity of these calculations, we consider the configuration 
shown in Figure 15.25. This is typical of semiconductor manufacture consisting of a metalized layer 
FIGURE 15.20 Mid-frequency noise model.
FIGURE 15.21 Basic board model consisting of a 2D lumped L-C configuration.EMC and SI 343
acting as ground, a Si substrate, a thin layer of SiO2, and the conducting track of width w. The SiO2
is a good insulator and acts as a passivation layer forming a hermetic seal to protect circuit elements. 
In a realistic situation, several other tracks will be deposited on the same substrate. In considering 
crosstalk between adjacent tracks, it is important to know how fields distribute in the vicinity of 
each track and to what extent they penetrate into the substrate and reach the ground plane. Clearly, 
a closely confined field between the track and the metalized ground layer will be very different as 
FIGURE 15.22 Model of a via (a) and of a bend (b).
FIGURE 15.23 Schematic of pulse propagation through a cascade of vias. Magnetic field associated with a 
pulse prior to reaching the first via (a), going through the first via (b), through the second via (c), and emerging 
after the second via (d).344 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
regards crosstalk compared to a situation where fields spread out and return is partially through the 
Si substrate. This can happen as the electrical conductivity of substrates varies widely depending 
on IC requirements. The problem cannot be solved analytically unless the track width is assumed 
infinite, resulting in a parallel plate waveguide configuration insulated with two layers, one of which 
(Si) has finite electrical conductivity. This calculation may be found in Reference 18. The graph in 
Figure 15.26 is based on this work and shows that, depending on frequency and resistivity, three 
modes of propagation are possible. Naturally, the boundaries between different modes are not clear￾cut, but the basic ideas are valid. We know that the skin depth and the loss tangent are related to 
frequency and resistivity as follows:
π f

1
2πf
δ = ρ
µ
δ =
ρε
(15.25)
When the product of frequency and resistivity are large enough for the loss tangent to be small, 
the silicon substrate behaves as an insulator (dielectric) giving a quasi-TEM mode of propagation. 
When conditions are such that the depth of penetration into silicon is small, the substrate behaves 
as a conductor and effectively as an imperfect ground plane. Finally, for moderate frequencies and 
FIGURE 15.24 High-frequency model.
FIGURE 15.25 Microstrip line on Si-SiO2 system.EMC and SI 345
resistivities, a slow surface wave mode prevails. For the practical case of finite width tracks, numeri￾cal solutions are available, showing field distribution in different regimes.19 
The conclusion is that at high frequencies and in this complex environment, it is very difficult 
to establish and operate numerical models that mimic the physical details of the circuit. Progress 
is being made in enhancing the capabilities of numerical methods so that they can cope with this 
challenge, but there are still formidable tasks ahead. This work is focused on multiscale methods to 
allow efficient treatment of fine features in electrically large structures and sophisticated techniques 
for the treatment of material behavior at high frequencies.20,21
Notwithstanding the complexity of the designs described above and the associated difficulties 
in devising exact physical models, advances in technology make it increasingly difficult to pursue a 
physical modeling approach. We mention here recent trends in three-dimensional (3D) IC designs 
representing a shift to vertical integration.22,23 A typical configuration is shown in Figure 15.27, 
illustrating the presence of a silicon interposer and through-silicon vias (TSVs). In such designs, 
parasitic components are important since, through voltage fluctuations, they affect the efficiency of 
power delivery networks. A full-wave simulation of such configurations is very computer-intensive. 
Testing is also challenging for complex ICs. Further details may be found in References 24–26. 
15.3.3 Behavioral Models — IBIS
The complexity of current and projected systems27 is such that physics-based models of the type 
described in the previous section are difficult to implement for system-level studies and there￾fore simpler models must be sought. Another factor, which pushes in the same direction, is the

unwillingness of vendors of ICs to disclose circuit details that reveal proprietary and commercially 
valuable information. For these reasons, ways are sought to allow a level of predictive capability at 
the system level using simplified models that mimic the behavior of components as seen at the pins 
without any details of the internal structure. They are described as behavioral models and have the 
advantage of efficiency, wide availability, and commercial confidentiality. On the negative side, they 
have a high sensitivity to loads and they account for a limited range of physics. The most common 
behavioral models are available under the label of IBIS (Input/output Buffer Interface Specification) 
and are widely available and accepted.28 In Figure 15.28, a CMOS transistor output stage is shown. 
Block A shows the output transistors, which are modeled in IBIS by DC V–I tables as shown sche￾matically in Figure 15.29 for the pull-up and pull-down cases. Block B in Figure 15.28 shows the 
clamping diodes, which are also represented by V–I curves. The models for the power clamp and 
ground clamp diodes are also shown schematically in Figure 15.29. These diodes clamp signals due 
to line reflections. Finally, block C represents the parasitics of the pad and package. The rise/fall 
data in Figure 15.29 relate to the transition time from one logic state to another. The IBIS models 
do not account for a range of effects that are important contributors to EMC. For example, the 
contribution of the internal activity in a component is not linked to the input/output. A more recent 
development is the ICEM (integrated circuit electromagnetic model),29 models that complement the 
IBIS models to give a more complete picture of EMC behavior. The ICEM introduces active ele￾ments that account for internal activities, while IBIS addresses mainly interface issues. Thus, it is 
proposed that ICEMs account for conducted emissions through supply and input/output lines, and 
FIGURE 15.28 CMOS transistor output stage: output transistors (a), clamping diodes (b) and package model (c).
FIGURE 15.29 Schematic of an IBIS model.EMC and SI 347
direct radiated emissions. An ICEM is shown schematically in Figure 15.30. The package model 
follows the IBIS input/output specification, and the core noise model is shown on the left with an 
equivalent current generator Ib, which is a piecewise linear approximation of the shape of the cur￾rent in the time domain. Typically, this current ranges between 1mA and 1 A with a period between 
500 ps and 50 ns. The substrate resistance is typically a few Ω. The capacitor Ci/o represents the 
decoupling capacitance for the input/output supply. Capacitors Cd and Cb stand for the decoupling 
and block capacitors. The other components shown account for the parasitics of the supply network. 
The necessary parameters for these models are obtained either by simulation or from measurements 
in a variety of experimental test configurations.4,30 
A process of continuous development is in hand to enhance ICEMs so that they can be used for 
accurate EMC characterization of complex systems. The structure of these models is such as to fit 
in automatically with the existing circuit solvers such as SPICE for ease of use by a wide range of 
vendors and developers. A more systematic approach to the development of reduced complexity 
models for general systems is presented in Section 15.3.5.
15.3.4  Near-Field Scans
In the previous section, we have addressed the modeling problems due to the complexity of modern 
systems, by using IBIS-type models.31 Another approach to the same problem is to represent parts 
of the problem space which are extremely complex by an equivalent formulation as far as radiation 
emissions are concerned, and combine these equivalents with full-field models of the rest of the 
problem. The approach is similar to the use of Thevenin equivalents in network theory, which offer 
a simplified representation of a particularly complex network in its impact on the rest of the circuit. 
In the case of circuits, the equivalents are formulated in terms of sources and internal impedances. 
For the purpose of EMC studies, the equivalents are constructed using equivalent dipoles as will be 
explained below.
We start by setting out our objectives. In Figure 15.31 (top left), we show a schematic of a PCB 
which consists of great many ICs and interconnects. The PCB is inserted into a cabinet with an 
aperture (lower middle), which in turn is part of a larger system, e.g., an automobile. A full-field 
physical model of the entire system suitable for EMC emission studies, including full details of the 
PCB, is unrealistically complex. A worthwhile step to decrease modeling complexity is to represent 
the PCB by a radiation equivalent model as shown schematically in Figure 15.31 (top right).
The equivalent PCB incorporates the minimum physical detail of the actual PCB, but with a 
judicious selection of equivalent dipoles displays similar emission characteristics. According to the 
equivalence theorem, the emission properties of part of space are fully represented by the tangential 
FIGURE 15.30 Schematic of an ICEM (representing the core) and IBIS model (representing the input/output 
interface).348 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
field components on a surface enclosing this space.32 The strategy therefore is to measure the tan￾gential field on a surface over the PCB by scanning a field probe and then by mathematical means 
derive a set of dipoles which produce the same radiated field as the PCB. Then, we may insert 
this equivalent construct into the cabinet and use this reduced complexity model for EMC studies. 
Several practical questions arise when designing the experimental capture of the tangential fields 
and the subsequent mathematical processing. Foremost among these is the choice of fields to be 
measured. We need to decide whether the electric, magnetic, or both fields need to be measured. 
In this context, the arrangement shown in Figure 15.32a can be helpful. Here we have a region to 
be characterized, represented by E, ZS, supplying a passive load ZL. The impact on the load is fully 
determined by the voltage V, the current I, or a combination of both, as shown in Figure 15.32b–d, 
respectively. By analogy, in a field situation we have the option of using the electric, magnetic, or 
both fields as is convenient. In the first two cases, the characterized (source) region is replaced in 
models by a perfect electric boundary (short circuit), or a perfect magnetic boundary (open circuit). 
In most cases, the measurement of the magnetic field only is the optimum choice.
The experimental arrangement is shown schematically in Figure 15.33. The scanning plane is 
larger by approximately 50% compared to the PCB surface and is placed at a height h. A magnetic 
probe is positioned under computer control to measure the tangential magnetic field. Phase informa￾tion is recovered using a reference probe as shown. Both signals together with positional informa￾tion are processed by a vector network analyzer.
In this manner, amplitude and phase of the tangential magnetic field are obtained at a distance h 
from the PCB. To increase the sensitivity of the measurement and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, 
distance h should be as small as possible, but we must beware of the possible disturbance by the

probe on the measured field. The spatial sampling should also be considered carefully as it depends 
on both the height and the wavelength.33,34 With measurements of this complexity, many sources of 
error are present, e.g., probe positioning, and should be considered carefully. A wealth of informa￾tion on the details and strategies of near-field scanning may be found in References 35–37.
The basic approach is to choose the number, position, and magnetic moment of the dipoles, 
which reproduce, as far as possible, the measure field on the scanning plane. We may start with 
a regular grid of dipoles, determine their respective parameters through one of the two processes 
described below, and remove dipoles that make negligible contributions and repeat the process to 
a point where a small number of dipoles produce fields within a specified error margin of the mea￾sured field values. The field due to a magnetic moment M may be obtained from equations such as 
(2.74) generalized for arbitrary polarization and position. We thus obtain the field in the form,

Coefficients ξ are obtained from equations such as (2.74), the subscripts referring to the field compo￾nents and the superscripts to the dipole. The magnetic moment amplitude is in effect current times 
area of an infinitesimal loop. In the equations above, M are the unknowns and the right hand of the 
equations the known measured fields.
The first approach to determine the unknown magnetic moments is to recognize that both equa￾tions above are in the standard linear equation form [ ] A x b = , where vector x represents unknown 
and b known quantities. Formally, an inversion wields the unknowns, = [ ]− x b A 1 . However, both 
[A] and b are subject to errors and the inversion of the matrix is not always guaranteed (it may be 
singular). Therefore, care needs to be taken, e.g., using a process known as Tikhonov regularization 
where the least significant noisy contributions are neglected.37,38 The basis of this process is in sin￾gular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix and is explained in more detail in the next section. 
Readers interested in this specialist subject may consult the references already given.
The second approach is based on formulating an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the 
difference between the field predicted by the collection of magnetic dipoles and the measured field. 
This may be done by genetic algorithms (GA) as explained in References 37 and 38.

After the dipole parameters have been determined, we may use the dipoles in combination with 
other basic features of the PCB (ground plane if present, equivalent substrate) as the PCB emission 
equivalent part in more complex modeling environments. Near-field measurements of stochastic 
field are also possible as discussed in Reference 39.
15.3.5  Analytical Approaches to Complexity Reduction
In Section 15.3.2, we have described the physical models of systems, meaning that all topological, 
geometrical, and material system details are captured, and their interactions are described by the 
appropriate equations (e.g., circuital or Maxwell’s equations). The ambition there was that the model 
captures all relevant physics. We may describe such brute force models as “white-box models” in 
that they offer users a full insight into the dynamic processes taking place in the modeled system. We 
have also explained that such models cannot cope with the extreme complexity of real systems, and 
we gave examples in the last two sections of modeling approaches to reduce complexity. These, the 
so-called “black-box models,” only attempt to capture essential behavioral features. Physical insight 
is not possible with black-box models, but on the positive side, we have more efficient and faster 
operating models. Many other terms are used in the literature to describe such models, e.g., reduced 
order models, surrogate models, equivalent models, and macro-models. The task of balancing physi￾cal accuracy and transparency against efficiency and speed of computation is a delicate one. Clearly, 
the essential features of the system must be captured by any black-box model. It goes without saying 
that a model is not the real thing. In a model, we ignore features which we may regard as irrelevant to 
the system response. The question arises as to how we decide what is essential in a real system which 
we must capture by the model. This process of de-featuring is a complex one. Certainly, intuition can 
help, but the complexity of EM interactions is such that even skilled professionals can commit errors. 
We have seen in previous sections examples of this process with IBIS models and the development of 
equivalents from near-field scans. In the current section, we look at more formal, analytical, methods 
to derive models of reduced complexity, which, however, maintain a high level of accuracy. A full 
exposition of these methods requires sophisticated mathematical tools and is beyond the scope of this 
book. A full treatment of techniques of linear algebra may be found in References 40 and 41. Here 
however, we give a short introduction to systematic approaches used to reduced complexity models. 
The ideas and techniques that follow are not specific to IC modeling, but are also applicable to any 
problem where complexity forces us to abandon a full physics-based model.
The basic idea is to approximate the dynamic behavior of systems by lower-complexity models, 
which display broadly equivalent behavior.42,43 The term macro-model signals this property, as the 
Greek term macro signifies large-scale behavior and ignores unimportant fine-scale features. There 
are basically two approaches to macro-modeling.42
We may formulate the differential equations for the system in the normal way and put them in 
state-space form as shown below.
 [ ]

(15.27)
The state vector x is a multidimensional vector containing all the variables that define the dynami￾cal behavior of the system. The rate vector x shows the rate of change of the state variables as a 
result of the dynamic evolution of the system. The output vector y contains the system outputs we 
wish to observe. The input vector u contains whatever inputs are applied to the system. [A]–[D] are 
described as the state, input, output, and direct feedthrough matrices. The first equation combines 
input and dynamics, and the second is the output equation. The task of model order reduction 
(MOR), or dimension reduction, is the reduction in the complexity (size) of these matrices in such 
a way that the predictions of the model are still accurate enough.44 This is shown schematically EMC and SI 351
in Figure 15.34, where the size of each rectangle represents the complexity/size of the respective 
matrix. The reduced model quantities are indicated with the tilde, and the process by which they are 
obtained will be explained at the end of this section.
Alternatively, we may start formulating the problem based on the observation that the transfer 
function H(s) of any physical system may be represented by a combination of poles and zero as 
shown below.
( ) = +∑ − H s H∞
R
s p
n
n n
(15.28)
where s=jω is the complex frequency, and pn and Rn are, respectively, the poles and residues of the 
response. This expansion may be derived analytically or from a fit to experimental data. A state￾space model can then be derived as shown in Equation 15.27. The process of preparing a model to fit 
a physical system requires adherence to a number of conditions.42 These conditions are formulated 
under the label of passivity: The model must be stable and causal (no poles with positive real part); 
the impulse response must be real-valued; and the model must not generate energy.
Thus, we may construct simplified models with varying levels of accuracy as our needs require, 
provided we adhere to the passivity conditions above. An example of such a model is IBIS, but there 
are also other options. A particular example that combines circuit equivalents and black-box models 
is Mpilog.44
We address now the systematic approximation of a matrix A .  [ ] → 
 
 A To simplify matters and 
thus highlight the main ideas, let us consider that matrix [A] allows us to obtain vector x at time k+1 
from knowledge of vector x at time k,
k 1+ x x = [ ] A k (15.29)
The particular features of matrix [A] that determine the evolution of vector x are its eigenvectors ui
and eigenvalues λi defined by the equation below.40,41,45
[ ] A u u i i = λ i (15.30)
The multiplication of a vector by a matrix results, in general, in changes in the direction and mag￾nitude of the vector. For some particular vectors (the eigenvectors of the matrix), the result of mul￾tiplication is that only the magnitude changes. The direction of the vector remains the same. The 
vector stretches or shrinks by an amount equal to the eigenvalue. Taking as an example a sym￾metric 2×2 matrix, we can easily visualize the operation of such a matrix on a vector. The matrix 
has two orthogonal eigenvectors and two real corresponding eigenvalues. Consider x to represent 
vectors with tips on a unit circle. Multiplication by a symmetrical matrix [A] transforms x into a 
set of vectors with tips tracing out an ellipse with two orthogonal principal axes along the direction 
of the eigenvectors u u 1 2 , . The half-length of the two principal axes is λ λ 1 2 , , respectively. If one of 
the eigenvalues is much smaller than the other, λ λ 2 1  , then multiplication results in a very thin

pencil like ellipse, which can be represented accurately enough by a straight line. We may therefore 
reduce the complexity of the problem by one dimension without a significant loss in accuracy. This 
is the basic idea behind complexity reduction. In three dimensions, as a result of multiplication by 
a 3×3 matrix, we get an ellipsoid which, depending on the relative size of the eigenvalues, may be 
reduced to an ellipse or even a straight line. For higher-dimensional matrices, the same idea applies, 
but the geometrical explanation is harder to visualize. It can be shown that a symmetric matrix [A] 
can expanded into a product of three matrices as shown below,
[ ] A U = Λ [] [] [ ] U T (15.31)
where [U] is a matrix with columns the eigenvectors of [A] and [Λ] is a diagonal matrix with elements 
the eigenvalues of [A]. The superscript T stands for transpose. This expansion is known as the spectral 
representation of [A]. It can also be shown that the expansion above can be put in the form below,

 
[ ] = λ + λ + + λ
λ ≥ λ ≥ ≥ λ ≥ ≥ λ

1 2 k n
(15.32)
where nxn are the matrix dimensions and we have ordered terms so that the first corresponds to 
the largest eigenvalue. In approximating the matrix, we may choose to keep only the first k largest 
eigenvalues to obtain,

A 
 = λ111 u u + λ u u + +  λ u u T 222T kkkT (15.33)
For a general non-symmetric rectangular matrix, we may use a similar decomposition known as 
singular value decomposition (SVD). This expansion follows the principles above and is based on 
the fact that if we multiply a matrix by its transpose, we get a symmetric matrix [A]T[A]. The expan￾sion has the form shown below,
[ ] = Σ [ ][ ][ ] ∑σ

(15.34)
where in the approximation we have only kept the k largest terms in the singular expansion. Matrix 
[U] has columns the eigenvectors of [A][A]T, [V] has the eigenvectors of [A]T[A], and [Σ] is a diagonal 
matrix with elements the singular values σi or zeros. The singular values are obtained as shown below.
[ ] A v u i i = σ i (15.35)
A more complete treatment may be found in References 40, 41, and 45. What is described above 
merely sets the picture for the interested readers to read further. These techniques find applications 
in many diverse fields such as image compression and de-noising of data. For examples of applica￾tions in EM modeling problems, References 46–50 may be consulted.

16 EMC and Wireless 
Technologies
Traditionally, EMC has focused on the emission and immunity of commercial equipment primarily 
at frequencies below 1GHz, and, at least in the EU, a lot of regulations were driven by competitive 
issues related to the free movement of goods. The digital revolution has had considerable impact on 
our electromagnetic environment but it has to be admitted that EMC still bears the imprint of its leg￾acy in analogue radio. In recent years, the EM environment has had to accommodate a host of new 
wireless services, both licensed and unlicensed, that compete for the same part of the spectrum. 
EMC as traditionally conceived has therefore to expand to encompass broader issues related to the 
interoperability and coexistence of systems. The illustration in Figure 16.1 will be familiar to many 
readers. It shows a phone (mobile), which may encompass considerable multi-functionality both 
internal (e.g., camera, video, MP3 player) and external (e.g., GPS, Bluetooth). Some of the external 
wireless links are licensed (e.g., GSM) and others are unlicensed and nomadic (e.g., Bluetooth). 
The manner in which these different technologies use the frequency spectrum means that receivers 
and transmitters must be able to work at different frequency bands in an adaptive manner, adjust 
gains and power levels, and do so in as transparent and secure a manner as possible. Several ad hoc 
networks will be using the same part of the frequency spectrum, which are effectively heteroge￾neous.1,2 A multitude of functional standards have been established to cope with this situation, but 
new standards are needed to meet radio regulatory and EMC requirements.3,4
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-21
FIGURE 16.1 Schematic showing a mobile phone (with internal functionality) and external wireless links.356 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Rapid changes are taking place and functional standards are continuously under development 
to make it impossible to give an authoritative picture of the field at this stage. However, the impact 
of these technologies on EMC as currently understood is likely to be major and EMC engineers 
need to become familiar with the structure and future developments in wireless technologies. The 
purpose of this chapter is to sensitize EMC engineers to this challenging topic and thus facilitate 
interaction between professionals working in EMC and communications technologies. A more com￾plete treatment of communications technologies is outside the scope of this book and must be sought 
in specialist texts.5–8
16.1 THE EFFICIENT USE OF THE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM
In the early days of radio, national governments and international bodies would allocate parts of 
the spectrum to different services and users. After a century of this practice and with the current 
explosion of wireless applications more efficient ways must be sought to utilize this asset (the fre￾quency spectrum). Some of the ingenious ways that communications engineers have sought to get 
the maximum out of the available spectrum are described below.
In conventional frequency division multiple access (FDMA), each user is allocated a certain 
amount of bandwidth spaced out as near as possible but with a small “guard band” to avoid inter￾ference between users as shown schematically in Figure 16.2a. This is the logical response to 
accommodating different users, and interference is not a problem provided that users keep within 
their allocated band. However, this is not the most efficient way, since a user has a dedicated 
band that, in most cases, is underused (e.g., during silent parts in a conversation). An alternative 
is to have several users using the same frequency band but allow them transmission and recep￾tion over short regular time intervals. This is shown schematically in Figure 16.2b and is known 
as time division multiple access (TDMA). In this scheme each user receives and transmits only 
part of the time. In practice, this does not represent a noticeable deterioration in the quality of 
service, as with fast digital signal processing techniques employed in modern communications 
the user is unaware of the interrupted nature of communication over the physical medium. Yet 
another way to use the spectrum is to allow users to communicate simultaneously over the same 
frequency band. At first, this may seem paradoxical as the chaotic nature of the aggregate trans￾mitted signal would appear to make communication impossible. However, it should be possible 
to extract the signal we are interested in — after all, at a party there are several simultaneous 
conversations and yet our brain is able to listen to the one we are interested in. The engineering 
approach to this problem is for each transmitter (TX) to code each signal injected into the com￾mon channel and for the intended recipient (RX) of this signal to extract it. One requirement for 
this is that RX knows the code, in which case the transmitted signal can be extracted from the 
aggregate signal by correlating with the code. We have discussed signal correlation in Section 
4.2. The other requirement is that, like doors and keys, each conversation must have a “different” 
code. In engineering parlance this means that the codes used by each user must be “orthogonal.” 
This technique is known as code division multiple access (CDMA) and is shown schematically 
in Figure 16.2c. We have encountered a similar concept (a spreading code) in connection with 
direct sequence spread spectrum techniques where the objective was security and spreading the 
energy in the signal over a wide band of frequencies and thus lowering the spectral density. The 
code operates at a higher rate than the data. Taking the three codes shown in Figure 16.2c as an 
example we see that they are orthogonal

C2 1, 1,  1,  1
C3 1,  1,  1, 1

Hence, as expected, C1×C2=1×1+(−1)×1+1×(−1)+(−1)×(−1)=0. The same result is obtained 
for any pair combination of orthogonal signals. Many users can thus be placed on the same data 
stream provided each is first coded using a set of orthogonal codes as shown in Figure 16.3.
Yet another scheme is to use directive antennas to communicate with several users in the same 
frequency band as shown schematically in Figure 16.2d. This scheme is referred to as space divi￾sion multiple access (SDMA). Cellular systems rely on the fact that each transmitter has a limited 
coverage area beyond which signal levels are too low, so other users can use the same frequency 
without appreciable risk of interference. A typical arrangement is of clusters of seven cells as shown 
in Figure 16.4. The size of a cell can range from 1 (in a city area) to 10 km (in a rural area) depend￾ing on the density of customers. Adjacent cells are allocated different frequencies so that there 
is no risk of interference since, in practice, the geographical boundary of each cell is uncertain. 
FIGURE 16.2 Examples of schemes for multiple access: (a) frequency division multiple access, (b) time 
division multiple access, (c) code division multiple access, and (d) space division multiple access.358 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
In Figure 16.4, the shaded cells can be allocated the same frequency with limited risk of interfer￾ence. Clearly, the way the “handover” takes place as a user moves across the boundary between two 
adjacent cells so that the change is transparent to the user must be done carefully. This can be done 
in several ways. One way (used in GSM) is for the mobile to monitor and report to the network the 
received signal strength from several base stations. The network then decides on the basis of the avail￾able signal strength and the availability of spare channels in other cells when the handover must take 
place and informs the mobile. The mobile in turn then makes the necessary frequency adjustments to 
retune at the new channel. This is a complicated process and shows the degree of complexity involved 
in running a public service mobile network. In a telephone network duplex operation is required, 
FIGURE 16.3 Data from several users are coded individually using orthogonal codes and then used to 
modulate a carrier.
FIGURE 16.4 Schematic of a cellular system. Shaded cells transmit at the same frequency with minimal 
risk of interference.EMC and Wireless Technologies 359
i.e., it should be possible to speak simultaneously in both directions. This is done using either 
frequency division duplex (FDD) (Figure 16.5a) or time division duplex (TDD) (Figure 16.5b). 
The key to efficient and secure communications is diversity and all the approaches described above 
are focused on this aim. 
16.2 EMC, INTEROPERABILITY, AND COEXISTENCE
The data we wish to transmit are employed to modulate a high-frequency carrier that then feeds a 
transmitting antenna, propagates through free space and buildings, and suffers reflections and other 
distortions to arrive together with any other signals or noise to the receiver antenna for demodula￾tion and decoding to recover, hopefully, the original data. The method of modulation clearly has an 
impact on how robust the transmission is and therefore on the quality of service. Modulation is a 
topic covered in many textbooks. We merely give here a couple of examples to show how it affects 
the immunity of the transmission to interference.
We start with the example of a modulation scheme known as binary phase shift keying (BPSK) 
where phase is used to transmit different symbols. Symbols (1 or 0) are transmitted in fixed intervals 
T. This modulation scheme inserts a phase shift 0 or π according to the rule
s t h t A cos  t () () = ω( ) c (16.1)
where A is the amplitude of the symbol and ωc is the angular frequency of the carrier. The func￾tion h(t) is +1 when the symbol is “1” and −1 when the symbol is “0.” This is shown schematically 
in Figure 16.6a for the sequence “1011.” This scheme is best illustrated in terms of the signal 
constellation or phase transition diagram shown in Figure 16.6b. We see from this diagram that 
as long as the phase of the received signal can be recognized then detection is possible. All 
that is needed is to establish whether the signal lies on the right- or left-hand side of the plane. 
The amplitude of the received signal does not convey information. It needs to be large enough 
for detection. The error margin is of the order of the symbol amplitude, thus giving a degree of 
immunity to noise and interference. More sophisticated schemes such as the differential phase 
shift keying (DFSK) are also available.
It is also possible to expand further the idea of phase transitions as a means of transmitting 
more bits per symbol and also provide a degree of noise immunity. An example is the quaternary 
quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). The phase transition diagram for this scheme is shown in 
Figure 16.7. We see that at each of the four states it transmits two bits, the combinations 00, 01, 11, 
FIGURE 16.5 Duplex schemes: (a) FDD, (b) TDD, TX-transmit, RX-receive.360 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
10. We see, however, that the error margin is now smaller. By identifying more phase states we can 
transmit more bits per symbol (e.g., 8PSK), but at the cost of increasingly lower error margin.
More modulation schemes of increasing complexity are available to deal with a variety of situa￾tions. We give below a further example of a scheme to deal with multipath interference. 
Consider the typical transmission situation depicted in Figure 16.8.8 The transmitted signal from 
TX reaches the receiver RX through a number of possible paths. Three such paths are shown in the 
figure, the direct path and two other paths that are the result of reflections from obstructions from 
building and other features in the environment. In practice, many such reflections are present. The 
propagation delay along each path differs since the path length is different. Hence, the received 
signal at RX is the result of the combination of signal getting there through the direct paths and 
signals arriving later through indirect paths. If the delay of the indirect path signals is comparable 
FIGURE 16.6 Principle of BPSK (a) and corresponding phase transition diagram (b).EMC and Wireless Technologies 361
with the symbol time and their strength is significant it is conceivable that the signal at RX will be 
severely distorted. Signals originating from one symbol and suffering a long delay due to reflections 
may arrive at the same time as the next direct path symbol. Depending on the circumstances it may 
not be possible to recognize correctly the second symbol (intersymbol interference). This so-called 
multipath interference becomes a problem when multipath propagation delays become comparable 
with the time allocated to transmit each symbol and is therefore dependent on the symbol rate. 
FIGURE 16.7 Phase transition diagram for the QPSK.
FIGURE 16.8 A typical multipath environment.362 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Taking as an example a relatively slow symbol rate of 0.1 mega symbols per second (Msps) this 
gives a symbol time T=10 μs. With a propagation velocity of 3×108m/s this corresponds to a path 
length of 3 km. Hence, at this slow symbol rate, significant multipath effects will become apparent if 
the coverage area is comparable or exceeds 3 km (e.g., a city area). If a higher symbol rate is desired, 
then the coverage area must be reduced accordingly to avoid multipath interference, e.g., for 1 Msps 
coverage<300m, 10 Msps coverage<30m, and 100 Msps coverage<3m. We see, therefore, that 
high symbol rates impose severe limitations in the area of coverage due to multipath effects.
In order to overcome these limitations, a way forward is to take a fast serial data stream and 
split it into, say, five parallel data streams as shown in Figure 16.9, where each of the parallel data 
streams uses a different frequency channel. The symbol rate at each of the parallel streams is slower 
than the serial symbol rate (in this case 1/5). Hence, the reception of the parallel streams is mul￾tipath interference free over larger distances (five times larger in this example) compared with the 
overall serial symbol rate. The cost we pay, however, is needing more frequency channels (multicar￾rier transmission, five in this case). Referring to Figure 16.2a we see that five channels with their 
corresponding guard bands represent a considerable increase in spectrum use. A special modulation 
technique known as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) may be used to make 
spectrum use more efficient. The k-channel is
S t k k ( ) = sin 2( ) πf t (16.2)
where fk is the center frequency of the k-channel. The separation between adjacent channels Δf is 
chosen to be equal to the symbol rate 1/T. If this is done, then adjacent channels are orthogonal over 
an integration time equal to the symbol time T. This follows from the expression5
T
0
∫ + sin 2( ) πfj j t s ϕ + in( ) 2πf t k k ϕ = dt 0 (16.3)
provided f f n
T j k − = , where n is an integer.
This expression implies that we can send symbols at different frequencies in parallel provided 
these frequencies differ by n/T and still recover each symbol by integrating over a time interval T. 
This is shown schematically in Figure 16.10. In Figure 16.10b the spectrum of two adjacent carrier￾modulated symbols is shown. Since the carrier spacing is equal to 1/T, the two spectra overlap as 
FIGURE 16.9 Splitting a fast serial stream into five parallel slower streams.EMC and Wireless Technologies 363
shown — when one is maximum the other is zero. The implication of this is that we have no need 
of the guard band as shown schematically in Figure 16.11. This should be contrasted with the con￾ventional FDM shown in Figure 16.2a and it confirms the higher spectrum efficiency of the OFDM.
We see that by increasing the diversity of the received signal we are able to use spectrum effi￾ciently and at the same time provide a degree of immunity to noise and multipath effects.
FIGURE 16.10 Spectrum of a single carrier modulated symbol (a), spectrum of two adjacent carrier modu￾lated symbols (b).
FIGURE 16.11 Schematic of power density for four orthogonal channels.364 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Many other schemes are available to modulate and code signals, which the reader may access in 
specialist publications.5–8
Serious problems can be encountered in the coexistence of systems especially in the 2.4GHz 
ISM band where many services are operating. Many of these services are unlicensed, nomadic, and 
operate on different standards. Any attempt to coordinate the use of the spectrum between services 
is made difficult by the fact that communication in real time between users is hampered by the use 
of different communication protocols. We have in effect a number of heterogeneous networks. More 
details of the nature of these networks are given in the next section. Here we simply highlight some 
of the approaches to bring a degree of compatibility between different classes of users. Avoidance of 
interference may be achieved by classic approaches based on the listen-before-talk technique. Here 
a potential user listens to make sure that no other user is using a channel before transmitting. Other 
avoidance techniques are adaptive frequency hopping and dynamic frequency selection (DFS).4
Suppression techniques are various error correction techniques whereby extra bits are added to 
transmissions to allow the receiver to detect errors and correct them as far as possible. Examples 
are the Reed-Solomon code, Hamming code, and convolutional codes.5,6 Direct sequence spreading 
(DS) and frequency hopping (FH) are other approaches to suppressing interference. 
In the case of heterogeneous networks, efforts are being made to establish a common narrow￾band control channel to which all potential users, irrespective of the particular transmission stan￾dards each adheres to, may contribute for coordination purposes. Such a shared broadcast channel 
(SBCH) is described in Reference 9 for the 2.4GHz band.
16.3 SPECIFICATIONS AND ALLIANCES
Several wireless services have been established in recent years to implement a variety of functions 
from mobile telephony6,7 to wire connectivity at home.10 Several standards have been developed to 
regulate these services, together with commercial alliances to develop compatible products. It is 
impossible to give a complete picture of the entire field in a short chapter. However, presenting a 
broad outline to EMC engineers is a worthwhile goal as the impact of these services on the way the 
frequency spectrum is used and protected is likely to increase considerably in the years to come.
The first point to emphasize is the multitude of services using the spectrum; a partial list is 
shown in Figure 16.12. We will endeavor to make sense of the acronyms shown in this figure later 
in this section but it will suffice to point out how crowded the ISM band at 2.45GHz has become. 
Some are highly regulated public mobile services (e.g., GSM), others private mobile networks for 
use by individuals (e.g., walkie-talkie) or the emergency services (e.g., TETRA). Another cate￾gory encompasses ad hoc networks used to interconnect devices at home or at work without wires 
FIGURE 16.12 Some users of the electromagnetic spectrum.EMC and Wireless Technologies 365
(e.g., Bluetooth). Many of these services compete for the use of the spectrum, both with each other 
and with long-established services such as radar (around 5.5GHz) and navigation (GPS, Galileo). 
A further group of services using the spectrum are mobile broadcast (e.g., DVB-H). The exact fre￾quency bands used by each service are set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) 
and depend on geographical location and local regulations. The appropriate national authorities 
should be consulted in each case for up-to-date and reliable information. For EU countries a com￾prehensive list may be found in Reference 11. The figures given here are indicative to help assess the 
range and scope for EMC and interoperability problems.
A convenient classification is in terms of the range of coverage of each technology from WPAN 
(Wireless Personal Area Network), WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), WMAN (Wireless 
Metropolitan Area Network), to WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network). These are depicted in 
Figure 16.13.
WPAN addresses connectivity around personal workspace, e.g., an individual’s laptop com￾puter, mobile phone, etc. Several examples are shown in the figure. Bluetooth12 is a frequency hop￾ping spread spectrum (FHSS) (1600 hops per second) wireless system with data rates typically 3 
Mbits/s operating in the unlicensed 2.4GHz band. It is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard. The 
modulation schemes used are GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying), π/4 DQPSK (Differential 
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), and 8PSK (Phase Shift Keying). Bluetooth uses a time division 
duplex system (TDD), the bandwidth is 1MHz, and there are 79 1-MHz channels. Transmit power 
ranges from 20 dBm (100mW) for class 1, 4 dBm for class 2, to 0 dBm for class 3, the most common 
option. Received signal of typically –70 dBm is required for acceptable bit error rate. The potential 
of coupling of Bluetooth signals into conductive structures is explored in Reference 13.
ZigBee14 is a technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard aimed at monitoring and control 
applications where low cost and long battery life are important. Multiple access is achieved by 
CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance); channel bandwidth is 5MHz and 
frequency ranges, number of channels, and peak data rate are 868MHz (1, 20 kbits/s), 915MHz (10, 
40 kbits/s), and 2.4GHz (16, 250 kbits/s). Modulation at the two lower frequency ranges is BPSK 
(Binary Phase Shift Keying) and at 2.4GHz OQPSK (Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying).
Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a technique whereby rather than using a limited part of the spectrum 
we deliberately use a very wide band but at a low spectral density such that other users see a barely 
perceptible increase of the noise floor. These are schemes based on spread spectrum techniques, 
FIGURE 16.13 A classification of wireless technologies based on the coverage range.366 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
multiband OFDM, or sending very short pulses (pulse UWB radio). The receiver must be able 
to correlate with known spreading codes to recover the original signal. Spreading is typically in 
the range of 3.1 to 10.6GHz and channel bandwidth is 528MHz (for MB-OFDM) and 1.368GHz, 
2.736GHz (for DSSS). The number of channels is 13 and 2, respectively, for the two schemes. 
Typical data rates are 480 Mbits/s, although higher rates are planned. The FCC specifies a power 
density below –41 dBm/MHz. For EU harmonized standards on UWB by the European Conference 
of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) consult Reference 15. A useful refer￾ence on the impact of UWB on other services such as third-generation wireless services, radio 
astronomy, or radar is a consultation document by the UK Office of Communications (OFCOM). 
At issue is what proportion of the interference level is allowed to come from UWB and whether the 
US spectral mask is acceptable. One suggestion is that in-band emission levels are reduced by 6 dB 
(to −47.3 dBm/MHz), another that the out-of-band limits should be set to fall from −41 dBmW at 
3.1GHz to −85 dBm/MHz at 2.1GHz. A discussion of these issues may be found in Reference 16. 
EMC aspects of UWB are further explored in References 17 to 19. Mention should also be made 
of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),20 which is a method of storing and retrieving data. An 
RFID tag may be attached to an object or person for identification purposes. Several standards are 
under development and several frequency ranges are used, the most prevalent being 125 to 134kHz, 
13.56MHz, 868 to 928MHz, and 2.45GHz. Channel bandwidth is typically 250 to 500kHz and 
peak data rate 848 kbits/s. A final example is Near Field Communication (NFC), which achieves 
wireless connectivity between devices in close proximity to each other (a few centimeters). It oper￾ates at 13.56MHz and the data rate is 424 kbits/s.21
WLAN or Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)22 addresses wireless connectivity inside a plant or an office 
complex, an airport, etc., or at home to connect computers. It is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of 
standards. The first to emerge was IEEE 802.11b and operates at 2.4GHz; 802.11g operates at the 
same frequency but is faster. 802.11a operates at 5GHz. An even faster standard is the 802.11n with 
maximum transfer rates of 300 Mbps. Details are given in Table 16.1. In Figure 16.14 a comparison 
of the spectral coverage of WLAN, Bluetooth, and RFID is shown.
WMAN is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard and extends the capabilities of WiFi and links 
up with WWAN applications. It competes with cables for “last mile” broadband access. WiMAX 
(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a forum of vendors of equipment based on

this family of standards.23 The 802.16–2004 covers the frequency range 2 to 66GHz with commonly 
used frequencies in the range 2.45 to 5.825GHz. A more recent standard, 802.16e, has a narrower 
frequency range (2 to 11GHz) and more sophisticated modulation and access techniques based of 
OFDM for greater flexibility and lower power consumption. Bandwidth is in the range 1 to 28MHz 
and peak data rate 134 Mbits/s (for 28MHz BW), but typically 75 Mbits/s, and 15 Mbits/s for the 
802.16e. WiBro is also based on the 802.16e standard and is supported by Korean manufacturers.
The communication effectiveness of different techniques and approaches to decreasing the trans￾mit power of wireless systems are discussed in References 24 and 25.
WWAN cover the major public mobile phone networks and similar services. The first genera￾tion (1G), based on FDMA and relatively low data rates (less than 10 kbits/s), were followed by the 
second generation systems (2G) such as GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), CDMA 
One, and TDMA; 2.5G systems such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service); and 3G systems 
such as CDMA2000 and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). The 3G develop￾ments are managed by a group known as the Third Generation Partnership Program (3GPP), which 
consists of six global partners and has been operating since 1998. UMTS is the development of 
GSM and is also known as 3GSM. The group dealing with the 3G development of CDMA2000 
is known as 3GPP2. EDGE (Enhanced Data Global Evolution or Enhanced Data for GSM) is an 
upgrade of GPRS. GSM and GPRS use as modulation GMSK (Gaussian minimum shift keying) 
while EDGE uses 8PSK. The latter is a higher-order modulation that can accommodate more bits 
per slot and results in a threefold increase in the data rate but at the expense of noise immunity. 
The higher-order modulation scheme is more sensitive to noise, hence the high data rates are only 
attainable under strong signal conditions. Frequency ranges for GSM/GPRS/EDGE are generally 
in the 800 to 900MHz and 1800 to 1900GHz range depending on local radio regulations. Multiple 
access is through TDMA/FDMA, duplex operation is FDD, and the channel bandwidth is 200 kHz. 
The number of channels ranges from 124 for GSM900 to 374 for GSM 1800 with eight users per 
channel. Peak data rates are 14.4 kbits/s (GSM), 53.6 kbits/s (GPRS), and 384 kbits/s (EDGE). 
The 3G technologies are based on wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) and, in the case of UMTS, use a 
bandwidth of 5MHz and CDMA2000 1.25MHz. Typical data rates are 2 Mbits/s for UMTS and 3.1 
Mbits/s for the forward link and to 1.8 Mbits/s for the reverse link of CDMA2000. A good general 
introduction to cellular systems may be found in Reference 7.
FIGURE 16.14 Schematic showing spectral occupancy of UHF RFID (bandwidth 350 kHz, transmitter 
power 4 W), WLAN (bandwidth 20MHz, transmitter power 100mW), and Bluetooth (bandwidth 1MHz,
frequency hopping, transmitter power 100mW).368 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
These are public networks but there are also networks used by organizations such as the police 
and other emergency areas. A particular example developed in Europe is TETRA (Terrestrial 
Trunked Radio System).6 Various bands have been allocated in the range 350 to 1000MHz with the 
range 410 to 430MHz most commonly in use. Modulation is done using π/4 DQPSK (differential 
quadrature phase shift keying) and multiple access by TDMA, Duplex operation is through FDD, 
and the channel bandwidth is 25kHz with four channels per carrier. Data rates are typically 7.2 
kbits/s. Concerns have been expressed about the potential of TETRA to cause interference due to 
the high-transmit power and the low frame rate (18 frames/s).26 Base station power ranges from 40 
W to 0.6 W. The mobile stations have power in four classes: 30, 10, 3, and 1 W.
Other potential users of the spectrum are various broadcast services. An example is DVB-H 
(digital video broadcasting-handheld) based on the ETSI Standard EN 302 304.27 There are three 
frequency ranges: 174 to 230MHz, 470 to 862MHz, and 1452 to 1492MHz. Modulation is QPSK, 
16QAM, and channel bandwidth from 5 to 8MHz. The cell radius ranges from 17 to 67 km.
Finally we mention the major navigation systems, GPS (Global Positioning System) and Galileo.28
The parameters for GPS are frequencies 1575.42MHz, 1227.6MHz, modulation is BPSK, channel 
bandwidth 20.46MHz, 32 satellites (maximum), and data rate 50 bits/s. For Galileo, frequencies 
are 1575.42, 1176.45, 1207.14, and 1278.75MHz, and the modulation is BOC (binary offset carrier).
16.4 INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT) AND EMC
We have already described some of the wireless technologies coming into homes and businesses. Several 
generations of technological innovation such as 4G have resulted in connectivity of cell phones and 
the exchange of data. With the introduction of 5G, connectivity will be extended between all kinds of 
devices, not just cell phones, in static and dynamic environments. The Internet of things (IoT) is a vision 
involving a large number of devices, primarily wirelessly connected, collocated, with a high density of 
users, sharing bandwidth, using new frequencies in dynamic and unpredictable configurations.29 Users 
are physical devices, homes, businesses, sensors, actuators, land, air, and sea transport, which exchange 
data on the move. 5G is the technical enabler for the network as it is anticipated that 80% of Internet traf￾fic will be wireless. This will involve the use of several standards in unlicensed bands such as ISM, e.g., 
for short range (RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) and long range (LoRa, SigFox, Weightless). Examples 
of standards developed under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), suitable for long-range 
systems in licensed and unlicensed bands are LTE-M, EC-GSM, NB0IOT, and 5G.
A number of EMC issues have to be addressed if such a network can fulfill its promise in the 
years to come.29–32
Very high densities of co-located devices are anticipated, i.e., 200,000 devices/km2. This will 
require new ways in which to achieve EMC as the in-band, front-door interference levels will 
increase.33 Co-location distances may have to increase to avoid unacceptably high EMI levels. 
Interference levels will also depend on power levels, duty cycles, etc.
The location of devices will change dynamically in unpredictable, random ways. Existing stan￾dards have been developed with static situations in mind, and it will be a challenge to achieve EMC 
in situations where human factors such as social habits become important. Some insights into sto￾chastic EMC may be found in Chapter 19 of this text.
New, higher (10s GHz), and multiple frequency bands will be used where devices have unclear 
emission and immunity performance. Two frequency bands are anticipated: FM1 (<5GHz) and 
FM2 (>5G Hz). FM2 can be as high as 30GHz outdoors and 90GHz indoors. This should be 
compared to existing EMC standards, which cover frequencies up to 18GHz. The lower frequency 
range is intended for low data rates, and the higher for more challenging applications. There is 
also potential for conflict between EMC and Radio/Telecommunications Standards. In Reference 
31, an example is given where three standards EN 300 328,34 EN 300 489,35 and EN 61000-6-436
are involved in radiated emission tests. To achieve data rates of several gigabits per second, higher 
bandwidths (~GHz) will be employed, well outside established EMC test practice. Large increases 
in the occupation levels of unlicensed frequency bands are to be expected.EMC and Wireless Technologies 369
A wider use of inexpensive, wirelessly operating devices will be incorporated into products 
which may perform safety critical functions, e.g., autonomous vehicles. An example of a potential 
future application, with safety critical implications, is the wireless monitoring of cars with auto￾matic breaking to maintain a shorter safe distance between vehicles by eliminating the uncertainty 
of human reaction time. Testing the functionality of wireless devices is difficult if enough thought 
has not been given as to how the state of the device is to be captured during testing.
We address some EMC testing and characterization issues relevant to wireless systems in the 
next three sections.
16.5 WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER (WPT) AND EMC
Developments in the IoT and many other wireless applications depend crucially on the ability to 
transfer electrical energy wirelessly.37 Broadly, this transfer may be done using near- and/or far￾field coupling. In the former case, we have a reactive coupling and in the latter radiative coupling. 
Reactive coupling normally operates at low frequencies (30 kHz–30MHz), and coupling distances 
are small in the range of a few centimeter for resonant coupling and tens of centimeters in non￾resonant coupling. Far-field coupling operates at frequencies in the 300 MHz–300GHz range and 
maximum distances of hundreds of kilometers depending on power and antenna properties.
A typical high-frequency energy harvesting system is shown in Figure 16.15.38
The transfer efficiency depends on dc-RF efficiency of the transmitter, wireless link efficiency,
and RF-dc efficiency at the receiver stage. Due to the very low energy density levels, careful design 
of every stage is required. Extensive studies are needed to establish EMI levels both for EMC pur￾poses and for assessing the health impact of exposure to EM field.39,40 For applications in medical 
implants, wearable devices, RFIDs, etc., further details may be found in References 37, 41, and 42.
Near-field coupling at low-frequencies is based on the magnetic coupling between two coils in 
close proximity. The basic principle adhered to here is encapsulated by the maximum power transfer 
theorem. The situation is depicted in Figure 16.16, where a source is connected to a load.
The source and load impedances are, respectively,

The technology of achieving optimum power coupling conditions in coil coupling is described in 
several publications, including References 43–45. For vehicle charging, the coupling coils may be 
located on the underside or on the roof of the car as shown schematically in Figure 16.17.
Extensive work has been done in this area due to the need for electrical car development and 
the associated need for charging infrastructure. There are guidelines developed by three major 
industrial groups: the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC),46 the Air Fuel Alliance,47 and the Society 
of Automotive Engineers (SAE).48 EMC world standards applicable in this case are CISPR-14-1, 
CISPR-14-2; EN 55014-1 and EN 55014-2 (EU); and FCC 47 CFR part 15 (the USA). Information 
on limits to human exposure for frequencies up to 100kHz may be found in Reference 49. A useful 
survey of EMC and related issues for vehicle charging may be found in Reference 50.
16.6 CHARACTERIZATION AND TESTING OF WIRELESS SYSTEMS 
PERFORMANCE IN RESONANT ENVIRONMENTS
In previous sections, we have described how wireless systems are designed and the difficulties 
associated with multiple reflections under realistic propagation conditions. In Figure 16.8, several 
paths are shown between transmitter and receiver in an urban environment. Even more complex 
situations may arise in wireless propagation inside a train or airplane, where conditions resemble 
those of propagation in a resonant environment. In such configurations, if we calculate S21 between 
transmitter and receiver as a function of frequency, we observe that starting at low frequencies 
there is very weak coupling between transmitter and receiver. As the frequency increases, coupling 
gets stronger and peaks suddenly appear starting at the first resonance of the cavity. Thereafter, as 
expected, coupling peaks at successive resonances.51 A full understanding of propagation in such 
environments requires special techniques to model propagation under these conditions and also 
suitable test environments to verify performance. We address these two issues in this section.
Several aspects of resonant environments impact propagation. The level of losses in a resonant 
environment is characterized by the Q-factor as discussed in Section 14.3.3. A resonant peak is 
shown schematically in Figure 16.18. Its width Δfm is also indicated in the figure. It is related to the 
Q-factor by the equation below.

We have already discussed the communication problems arising from the delayed arrival of reflected 
signals at the receiver. In multipath environments, we characterize the impact of N delayed arrivals

(16.7)
Numerical models and physical test setups must be capable of emulating different Q-factors (equiv￾alently mean excess delays) and the number of paths (equivalently resonances). Additionally, since 
propagation properties change rapidly with time and space (fading), we must be able to reproduce 
such conditions in models and tests. A distance of 0.3m represents a delay of 1 nsec; hence, under 
dynamic conditions, environmental features can cause rapid fluctuations in phase and hence total 
signal magnitude. It is inevitable that models may have to be run many times to assess the statistical 
properties of typical environments and hence they must be efficient and fast running.
We examine first simulation models, which can be useful for studying wireless propagation in 
multipath environments. We consider as an example the study of propagation in a resonant cavity 
(e.g., train wagon). We may set up a full-field model (see Section 8.6) of the cavity and calculate 
propagation properties. As we are interested in the results under various conditions (e.g., differ￾ent Q-factors) so that we can establish statistical properties, this study must to be repeated many 
times. This is possible, but it is very time-consuming and uses very large computational resources. 
In Chapter 19, more sophisticated approaches in establishing the statistical moments of stochastic 
processes are introduced. However, very useful results may be obtained with modest computational

efforts using models of cavities based on circuit equivalents.51–54 A circuit analogue, which has a 
response similar to a peak in a resonant environment, is a series RLC combination. In Figure 16.19, 
a voltage source is shown feeding a number of RLC series branches connected in parallel. Each 
branch represents a resonance in a cavity with a peak shape as shown in Figure 16.18.
We can regard the voltage V and the current I as the analogues of the TX and RX antenna signals 
in a resonant cavity. For each branch, R, L, and C are chosen to represent the properties of each cav￾ity resonance. For cavities with a canonical shape, these can be obtained analytically.52 Considering 
a blanch k as an example, we can obtain the transfer function H(s) between the voltage applied to 
the branch Vk and the capacitor charge qk (equivalent to the current).

A derivation of these equations is given in Appendix F. From these expressions, we see that all 
equivalent circuit parameters may be obtained from Qk, Δωk, and ωk. These in turn may be obtained 
analytically for canonical environments (e.g., Equation 14.15), physical measurements, of full-field 
models.
The electrical charge in each branch n at time step k is then obtained in the discrete time domain 
by implementing a digital filter routine of the form,
q n,k ( ) = H z( )V k( ) (16.12)

central difference.

An alternative way to perform the calculation in the discrete time domain is to use the TLM trans￾forms described in Appendix G. This approach is based on network theory and gives a clearer grasp 
of modeling errors. Either way, we obtain the output current (RX) as a function of the input voltage 
(TX) for any combination of resonances. The representative circuit in Figure 16.19 is very easy 
to solve and can be implemented rapidly for a large number of resonances, Q-factors, etc. Thus,
through a process of averaging, we obtain statistical information on propagation in complex envi￾ronments. This approach emulates testing in a reverberation chamber, where through mode stirring,
we average responses over a large number of modes.
Modeling approaches have also been developed to test the performance of digital communica￾tion systems to impulsive noise. While the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an adequate measure in 
studying the performance of analogue systems, digital systems require different measures such as 
the bit error rate (BER).56 An example of such a modeling approach may be found in Reference 
57. The simulation chain proceeds in three stages. First, the source of EMI and the coupling paths 
are modeled to establish the level of interference likely to be coupled to the receiving antennae. 
This is done using a 3D, full-field, time-domain tool such as described in Section 8.6. The second 
stage is a signal processing stage aimed at selecting the part of the EMI which coincides with the 
bandwidth of the communication system. This stage typically converts pulses from the 3D simula￾tion into baseband signals and generates two signals in quadrature (90° out of phase) to facilitate 
emulating different modulation schemes, and a burst of pulses to reproduce the repetition rate of 
real EMI sources. The third stage involves a digital system simulation tool, which is now exposed 
to the incoming signal from the second stage, much as white noise is added when testing analogue 
communication systems.
The second topic in this section is the problem of testing wireless systems in a manner which 
represents realistic environments and minimizes the number of individual tests. Propagation in real 
environments is characterized by multiple paths, in addition to the line-of-sight path, with uncor￾related signals due to randomly moving targets, resulting in signal fading. A good candidate for a 
test environment is the reverberation chamber (RV) as it contains propagation characteristics also 
found in real urban or indoor environments. The question that arises is whether we can tune the 
properties of a reverberation chamber to emulate the characteristics of real environments. If we can 
do this, channel propagation testing can be efficiently performed in a RV. In an anechoic cham￾ber, we would need to use many sources to reproduce multipath conditions. There are propagation 
conditions where the dominant signal power is due to the line-of-sight (LoS) signal. Alternatively,
there are situations where there are many roughly equal contributions due to many scattering paths. 374 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
To describe these situations in a more concrete way, we define the Rician factor K as the ratio of the 
direct component (LoS) to the scattered components (non-LoS).58 Factor K varies widely depending 
on propagation conditions. In rural environments, coupling between base station and user equip￾ment is normally LoS. In indoor environment where the LoS path is unobstructed, the K-factor is 
of the order of 10 dB. Inside a very good RV, K is very small of the order of 10–2. Each Cartesian 
component of the received electric field, e.g., Ex, is the sum of direct and scattered components 
Ex=Exd+Exs. The real and imaginary parts of the scattered components are normally distributed,
uncorrelated, and of the same variance σ2. It can be shown that the received electric field follows 
the Rician distribution.

The Rician distribution is typical of situations when there is a dominant beam (e.g., LoS path). 
The case where we have no dominant beam, e.g., many diffuse reflections, corresponds to v=0. 
Under these conditions, the Rician distribution reduces to the Rayleigh distribution shown below.

The shape of this distribution for σ=1 is shown in Figure 16.20 (dots). A good RV approximates a 
Rayleigh distribution. Therefore, in order to be able to test wireless communication systems under a 
range of realistic conditions, we must be able to degrade the performance of the RV to approximate 
any desired K-factor. In a RV of volume V, quality factor Q, antenna directivity D, distance between 
TX and RX antennae r, and operating wavelength λ, the K-factor is,
K 3VD
2 Qr

Changing selected parameters in this formula (e.g., by adding damping material to change cavity Q,
or changing the directivity of antennae) can give any desired K-factor value and thus test communi￾cation links under a range of conditions. More details may be found in References 58–60.
16.7 EMC TESTING IN THE TIME DOMAIN
The conventional approach in EMC testing is to work in the frequency domain. This reflects the 
beginnings of EMI studies where the main concern was to deal with analogue problems, typically 
radio reception. Technological developments have meant that we are now confronted by an environ￾ment where analogue and digital technologies coexist. The question then arises on the suitability of 
frequency-domain testing procedures where digital systems are concerned. We can best illustrate 
the potential difficulties by an example of conducted immunity testing in the 2–150kHz range.61–63
Modern digital systems (e.g., smart meters) may exhibit susceptibility in very narrow bands of 
frequency. The conventional test approach is to inject signals at fixed frequency steps. Assuming 
that the system displays resonances as shown in Figure F1 of Appendix F, it is evident that stepping 
in frequency may miss the peak of the resonance where the system is more susceptible and therefore 
overlook a potential weakness. Naturally, we may choose smaller frequency steps, but this results in 
long testing times. The problem is more acute, the higher the Q of the system is. Let us assume that 
we require that the test frequency to be within 1 dB of the peak as shown in Figure F1b. This means 
that the frequency steps must be smaller than,
0.5095 R
L
f 0.5095 f
Q 2 1
0 ω − ω = ⇒ ∆ = (16.18)
Thus, if we choose the frequency step near this resonance to be 2.3% of the resonant frequency, then 
there will be a test point within 1dB of the peak provided that the Q-factor is lower than 23.62 For 
larger values of Q, there is no certainty that a test frequency will be within 1 dB of the peak and thus 
no certainty that the product will perform in the field as required.
In such cases, tests done in the time domain are a better alternative. Using a damped sinusoid,
we can inject a continuous spectrum of frequencies, thus ensuring that energy will be injected at 
the peak of the resonance where the system is most vulnerable. A damped sinusoid and its Fourier 
transform are shown below and can be used to calculate the applied test levels over a range of 
frequencies.

The magnitude of the current injected at each frequency around the peak at ω0 may be calculated 
from the FT shown above.
We now address the general principles of EMC emission testing in the time domain. The basic 
idea is that instead of measuring emissions at specific frequency steps, we capture emissions in 376 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
the TD and, through Fourier analysis techniques we recover information in the FD. Early work in 
this area is reported in References 64 and 65. TD testing offers distinct advantages in areas such as
testing for impulsive and short-duration emissions. It reduces significantly test times and performs 
simultaneous measurements across a wide bandwidth.66 The basic measurement setup is shown in 
Figure 16.21.67 Signals from a receiving antenna, a LISN, or a current clamp are captured for pro￾cessing in a digital system. A low-pass filter (LPF) is used to band-limit the frequency below half 
the sampling frequency (Nyquist criterion). An analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) then follows,
to quantize signals which are then passed on to a digital signal processor (DSP) unit for Fourier 
analysis, and calculation of the desired amplitude spectra according to EMC standards. An impor￾tant parameter of the TD measurement system is its dynamic range (DR).
The dynamic range is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum signal that can be measured. 
The maximum is normally determined by saturation and is typically the reference supply voltage. The 
minimum is set by noise and uncertainty. In an ADC, the number of bits N puts limits on the dynamic 
range. The least significant bit (LSB) determines the minimum detectable signal, and the maximum is 
therefore 2N–1. Hence,
DR 20 log (2 1)LSB
LSB
6N , dB
N
=  −

 

 ≈ (16.20)
Thus, for a 14-bit ADC, the theoretical value of DR is 84 dB. To fully exploit the number of avail￾able bits, signals have to be scaled/amplified. Whether the signal is weak or strong, the basic idea 
is to scale it up to the reference voltage level; hence, all N bits are available for describing it. One 
approach for doing this is to use a multi-resolution TD measurement system. In this arrangement,
we split, through a power splitter, the incoming signal into three channels.67 The first channel is 
the most sensitive one and is intended for weak signals. The second is appropriate for interme￾diate and the third for strong signals. Diode limiters protect the first two channels from over￾loading. The signal through each channel is processed by dedicated DSPs. More details on the 
sophisticated signal processing required in the design of such systems may be found in Reference 
67. Commercial designs are available covering EMI measurements from DC to 40GHz, with 
a dynamic range of 100 dB and real-time analysis bandwidth of 685MHz, which comply with 
CISPR and military standards.68
16.8 CONCLUSIONS
The rapid evolution of wireless technologies and the introduction of the Internet of things (IoT) 
will have an impact on the way the frequency spectrum is used and EMC is perceived. Many of 
the fundamental concepts of EMC are rooted to analogue radio system protection, and adjust￾ments must be made in the years to come in the way we understand and implement EMC mea￾sures. A trend evident from the description of the ingenious techniques used to code and transmit 
signals is that we can “spread” interference over a wide frequency range so that it becomes less 
noticeable. This, however, is bound to have an impact over the years on the noise floor as new 
technologies are rolled out and the number of users escalates. We need to look ahead and protect 
the radio spectrum from long-term contamination. The role of EMC engineers will be crucial in 
this very worthwhile aim.

17 EMC and Broadband 
Technologies
To meet current needs for fast data transmission such as internet access into homes and businesses, 
new technologies are being developed that use the radio frequencies to achieve high speeds. One 
of the important commercial considerations in providing such services is what infrastructure to 
use and if such infrastructure is not available how best to provide it. Naturally, fiber-optic net￾works can be used with excellent results but they must be built afresh where they do not already 
exist, with consequent substantial costs. However, in the developed world virtually all domestic 
and commercial premises have telephone networks installed and in the less developed world 
substantial infrastructure exists in telephone networks and virtually all homes have a connection 
to the power network. The question therefore arises whether telephone and/or power networks 
could be used to transmit high-speed data. The commercial advantages are substantial since an 
existing widely available infrastructure can be used. In the case of the power network, not only 
is there a connection into every home but also into every room! Hence, high-speed data would 
be accessible from everywhere. The question relevant to EMC is what impact such services may 
have on the radio spectrum.
Two technologies, Digital Subscriber Line telecommunications (xDSL) and Power Line 
Telecommunications (PLT) are candidates for such schemes, the former for transmission over tele￾phone lines and the latter for transmission over the power network. The frequencies proposed for 
such applications cover the low-, medium-, and high-frequency bands that are traditionally used 
for emergency services, AM broadcasting, aeronautical, maritime and military, and by amateurs. 
Typically, protection is offered to broadcast services if they have the minimum field strength shown 
in Table 17.1. The requirement therefore is that if AM services are not to be disturbed, emission 
levels by xDSL/PLT must keep well below the minimum protected margins to provide an accept￾able signal-to-noise ratio. Our interest in this chapter is to sensitize the reader to the issues involved. 
Since no EMC radiation limits are available below 30MHz new standards need to emerge to bal￾ance the conflicting requirements of the radio and xDSL/PLT communities. This is a contentious 
issue but hopefully a widely acceptable solution will emerge in the years to come.
We first discuss the transmission of high-frequency signals over telephone and power networks, 
then we address the peculiarities of xSDL and PLT, and we finish with a presentation of the regula￾tory framework being currently debated.
17.1 TRANSMISSION OF HIGH-FREQUENCY SIGNALS 
OVER TELEPHONE AND POWER NETWORKS
Neither telephone nor power networks were designed to carry high-frequency signals. The con￾sequence of this is that any attempts to transmit fast data streams on such networks will result in 
significant attenuation, encounter significant levels of noise, and cause the emission of radiation. 
Care is therefore required to address all these issues in a satisfactory way before these technolo￾gies are rolled out in the field. There is an insufficient number of studies done to characterize such 
networks at high frequencies. One of the difficulties is that every network is different and even the 
same geographical network changes during the day as consumers (loads) connect and disconnect. 
Any study therefore needs to be statistical in its methodology in order to collect sufficient data 
about network behavior. However, the issues to be addressed are not difficult to discern. Acceptable

high-frequency transmission takes place if everywhere and at all times signals propagate in what 
can be termed as a transmission line, i.e., two good balanced conductors closely spaced without dis￾continuities. Under these conditions signals propagate without modification or appreciable radiation. 
There are no reflections and everywhere and at any time currents in the two conductors are equal and 
opposite. This is depicted schematically in Figure 17.1a. The last condition is profoundly important 
for EMC as it ensures that in the far-field the two elemental currents on any two conductor segments 
generate emitted fields that tend to cancel each other. Only in close proximity to the conductors (at 
distances comparable to the conductor spacing) field cancellation tends to become less effective as 
under such circumstances the conductor spacing has a significant impact on the distance between the 
observation point and each conductor. Balancing means that there are no CM currents. Reflections 
and unbalancing spoil matters as they can generate CM currents and can convert DM to CM currents 
(mode conversion). This is illustrated in Figure 17.1b, which shows a differential feed to a line. We 
assume that the characteristic impedance of Line1-gnd and Line 2-gnd is the same Z0. Upon connec￾tion of the sources, two voltage pulses are injected into the line as shown in Figure 17.1c:
V V / 2, V V / 2 1

The voltage and current positive reference directions are shown by the solid arrows to the left of 
the figure. The broken arrows indicate the direction of the propagation of the disturbance. We will 
neglect for simplicity any coupling between lines 1 and 2 so that we can approximately illustrate the 
principle. We now consider what happens when these pulses encounter the loads. Let us examine 
first the case where the line is balanced:
R R Z 1 2 0 = = (17.2)
Then, since each line is matched, the reflected voltages will be zero:
V V 0 1
r

r = = (17.3)
This is a perfectly balanced line and we see that, throughout, the voltages and currents on the two 
arms of the line are equal and opposite. Let us now look at what happens when we deliberately 
unbalance the line loads:
R 2 = = Z , R Z / 2 1 0 2 0 (17.4)

We see that now not only do we have reflected voltage pulses (a bad situation for EMC), but also the 
two pulses are of the same polarity as are the associated current pulses. The radiated fields therefore 
do not cancel effectively. There are several ways that unbalances can occur in practical situations 
encountered in telephone and power networks. One example from a power network is shown in 
Figure 17.2. Although the main loop (live and neutral) follows good TL practice, the presence of the 
unswitched branch line introduces an unbalance as only the live line is disconnected — the neutral 
remains connected. Hence, in total, live and neutral are not the same relative to their surroundings. 
Typically, in a distribution transformer (the local loop) there may be several hundred consumers 
nominally connected and all kinds of possibilities available for asymmetrical feed conditions.
Of the studies so far, several have been in connection with mains signaling or protection stud￾ies (at high voltage levels) but nevertheless they provide a background to the complexities of such 
networks as high- frequency propagation media.

FIGURE 17.2 Power supply line with a switched branch.384 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
Particular examples of models and simulations for EHV networks are given in References 1 
and 2. An extensive study aimed at mainsborne signaling is reported in Reference 3. Data extend 
to a frequency of 200kHz. The authors found high attenuation, which varies throughout the day 
by as much as 30 dB. At particular frequencies they found that attenuation is 20 or 30dB greater 
than the average. They concluded that a single frequency carrier scheme would be unreliable under 
these conditions and that some form of spread spectrum approach would be preferable. A study of 
network models and performance specifically for high-data-rate transmission (2 to 10 Mbits/s) and 
therefore extending to frequencies of several megahertz is reported in Reference 4. They report an 
average noise power density of 1.6×10−14V2Hz−1 and strong signal attenuation. For an injected level 
of 65 dBmV the signal measured after 300m of cable with a receiver bandwidth of 100kHz was 45 
dBmV at 1MHz and −22 dBmV at 20MHz. The conclusion is that some form of multicarrier tech￾nique would be necessary for reliable transmission.
17.2 EMC AND DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINES
The term xDSL is used to describe a generic class of technologies based on the use of copper wires 
in ordinary telephone connections to transmit internet in addition to the familiar voice telephone 
signals. Transmission thus takes place over unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP). In order to mini￾mize emissions a good cable balance is essential. This means that the impedance of each wire in 
the pair relative to the ground is as far as possible the same. A measure of how well a cable is bal￾anced is its longitudinal conversion loss (LCL). A DM signal is injected into the wire pair and the 
common-mode noise between the pair and the ground is measured. The ratio of the two in decibels 
is the LCL. Better balance means a higher LCL. ADSL stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber 
Line and operates between 25 kHz and 1.1MHz. Bit rates as high as 8 Mbps are possible. Different 
data rates are provided downstream (to the home) and upstream (from the home) since in most cases 
the user does not need to communicate at a high rate with the provider. The downstream frequency 
band is 0.138 to 1.104MHz and the power spectral density is −36.5 dBm/Hz. The upstream equiva￾lent figures are 0.138 to 0.276MHz and −34.5 dBm/Hz. VDSL stands for Very High Bit-rate Digital 
Subscriber Line and promises faster rates of the order of 50 Mbps. Its operation extends to higher 
frequencies, typically 10MHz. A typical configuration is shown in Figure 17.3. Radiated emissions 
from such networks have been the subject of study by several researchers. The greatest emissions 
take place from the drop wires. The main concern is the deterioration of radio services due to the 
cumulative impact of a large number of xDSL users. Key studies are reported in References 5 to 7 
and also in References 8 and 9. Radiation from such systems may propagate in several modes, i.e., 
via a sky wave (reflection from the ionosphere, frequency range 3 to 30MHz), space wave (0.1 to 
30MHz), and the ground wave (0.1 to 3MHz). Significant broadcasting services include digital AM 
radio (Digital Radio Mondiale or DRM), aeronautical radionavigation (nondirectional beacons or 
NDB), air traffic control, etc. In Reference 5 a typical city was taken as an example with an average 
FIGURE 17.3 Configuration used in xDSL systems.EMC and Broadband Technologies 385
fixed telephone line density of 3000/km2, total area 50km2, market penetration of ADSL 10%, and 
cable balance of 30 dB typical of old copper wire installation. On this basis and models developed 
in References 5 to 7, the cumulative electric field was calculated at different distances from the main 
distribution frame of the exchange for a number of frequencies. As an example, at 1km distance and 
at 1MHz (downstream ADSL) a value of 48.9 dBμV/m was obtained. At a distance of 10km this 
drops to 27.6 dBμV/m. If better wiring is used (balance 35 to 45 dB, typical of new copper instal￾lations) then the electric field falls by an amount in decibels equal to the improvement in balance. 
According to ITU-R the minimum sensitivity of an average receiver is 60 dBμV/m based on a SNR 
of 30dB at its input. On this basis, the maximum interfering signal that a receiver can sustain at 
its input is approximately, 30 dBμV/m. The final conclusion is that the cumulative field is such as 
to increase the noise floor up to a distance of 7 km from the city and thus impair analogue recep￾tion of MF broadcasting. In regard to practical remedies, a very high degree (better than 40dB) 
of cable/connector balance and also good shielding of the wiring inside customer premises are 
recommended.
17.3 EMC AND POWER LINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS (PLT)
This system is similar in concept to the xDSL but exploiting a different transmission medium — the 
power network outside and inside the home. The issues and concerns remain the same but more 
accentuated due to the imperfect nature of power networks as high-frequency transmission media. 
While with telephone systems a twisted cable pair is employed, thus affording a certain degree of 
balance, this is far from the case for power networks. The concern is therefore that significant emis￾sions will result leading to an increase in the noise floor and degradation of other services. Another 
concern is that since the power network is by its very nature a noisy environment it may be difficult 
to establish reliable transmission without significant levels of injected HF signal power. A schematic 
configuration is shown in Figure 17.4. Sophisticated coding and modulation techniques can be used 
to deal with the noise and imperfections of the transmission medium.10 Several investigators have 
looked into the emissions from such systems.11−17 The references mentioned earlier in connection 
with xDSL also contain assessments of emission from PLT systems. Field trials performed by the 
British Broadcasting Corporation18 came to the conclusion that there is demonstrable potential for 
PLT to cause interference to indoor reception. It appears therefore that in situations where a tele￾phone network is widely available, there are limited commercial opportunities for PLT with its 
associated technical difficulties; however, this will depend on the final form of the regulatory envi￾ronment, which is at present unclear. This is addressed in the next section. 
FIGURE 17.4 Schematic of a PLT configuration.386 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
17.4 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR EMISSIONS FROM 
xDSL/PLT AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES
The development of international standards is a lengthy business, especially when there are poten￾tial users of the spectrum with conflicting demands. Radio users feel that insufficient consideration 
is given to their requirements and xDSL/PLT vendors feel that spectrum protection is a form of 
trade restriction. A comprehensive discussion with a range of views is reported in Reference 19. The 
point of view of broadcasters and radio amateurs in put forward in References 20 and 22.
In terms of standards there is considerable delay and uncertainty in establishing appropriate limits 
and test procedures. A good survey of the current situation is given in Reference 20 on which Figure 17.5 
is based. For comparison, proposed field values are converted to 1-m distance assuming far-field (1/r) 
conditions (although this is not always justified). Many standards in this area are given in terms of the 
magnetic field and whenever this is the case they are converted to electric field as follows:
H E
377
          20 logE 20 logH 51.5
=
= +
(17.7)
Again, Equation 17.7 is only justified under far-field conditions. In Figure 17.5 we plot the proposed 
electric field limits in dBμV/m versus frequency according to different requirements. The baseline 
should be the minimum protected AM broadcast field, which is set at 40 dBμV/m. The curve labeled 
K.60 originates from ITU-T (the telecommunication sector of ITU). In contrast, the curve labeled 
ITU-R is a recommendation by the radiocommunication sector of the ITU and represents, in their 
view, the level necessary to protect reception everywhere. The difference is striking and typifies 
the inherent difficulties in setting widely acceptable limits. The German NB30 and UK MPT 1570 
recommendations are also shown. A compromise worked out by the BBC and the EBU is also 
shown.23 Another way forward is to provide for a number of notches — frequencies where the PLC 
transmission is 30 dB lower. The issue then is whether these notches are fixed, who selects them 
and how, how many there are, etc.20 A possibility is dynamic notching, which adapts to reception 
conditions. Work that addresses EMC issues and also the co-existence between PLC and VDSL is 
reported in Reference 24.
Interested readers need to follow developments as, hopefully, a consensus emerges that balances 
the needs of all spectrum users.

18 EMC and Safety
EMC standards and the associated design effort aim in the first instance to comply with certain 
requirements that have legal force. It may be assumed that equipment that satisfies EMC regulations 
is “safe.” This would be a bold statement and in many cases it would be untrue. It is quite possible 
to comply with EMC standards and yet find that in practice a product may fail in an unsafe manner 
due to EM disturbances. This should not come as a surprise as EMC standards are not formulated 
with safety in mind. Their background, imposed limits, and way of thinking come from the need 
to protect the radio spectrum and not explicitly to make equipment safe. Although safety is a legal 
requirement, EMC standards do not offer any explicit guidance as to how to proceed. There are also 
a few cases where designers may perceive a conflict between making a product EMC compliant and 
safe. If one looks at safety standards for guidance on EMC matters the situation is similar — there 
is very little coverage on this issue. It therefore appears that there is a divide between the way engi￾neers practice EMC and functional safety. This divide is rooted in the different approach of the two 
communities. Traditionally in EMC, verification is done by testing one or a few samples without 
regard to the design and construction practices employed in producing equipment.1 This process is 
described as “black box testing.” In contrast, the verification process for safety follows a different 
approach. This is based on a hazards and risks assessment. Designs have to follow well established 
design criteria that reflect their intended environment as regards all environmental factors such as 
temperature, humidity, vibration, etc. Reasonably foreseeable faults are introduced to ensure that 
safety is not compromised even under these circumstances. All equipment leaving the factory has 
to undergo some basic safety tests to ensure that safety-related features are in place.
The regulatory framework in this area is based on IEC standard 61508 and Technical Specification 
61000-1-2.2,3 The Institution of Electrical Engineers (now the IET) in London has produced guid￾ance on EMC and Safety that contains much of the background to the issues involved.4 We provide 
here a summary of the difficulties encountered in this area based on References 1 and 4.
EMC tests are done under ideal conditions with equipment prepared, optimized, and checked for 
testing. This is far from real-life situations. An example of this is that in immunity tests EM threats 
are applied one at a time. In practice, however, more than one threat may be applied simultaneously 
(time coincident threats), thus eroding whatever noise margin has been allowed for. This may not be 
a serious problem in terms of radio spectrum protection but may have serious implications in safety￾critical equipment. The environment inside an anechoic chamber or an open-area test site is very 
remote from real-life situations (realistic operating environments). As an example a car encounters 
a dynamic environment, e.g., may be boxed in by trucks and 18-wheelers, thus effectively confined 
in a resonant cavity. These are not rare situations and yet they are not accounted for in EMC stan￾dards. The time-history/frequency spectrum, amplitude, and modulation of threats vary widely. 
Yet standards specify a very limited formalized range of waveforms. In particular, if the modula￾tion frequency of a threat coincides with key equipment operating frequencies, the risk of failure 
increases considerably. While standards cannot specify all conceivable modulation frequencies, 
manufacturers are aware of the particularities of their equipment (e.g., key clock frequencies, trans￾fer rates, etc.) and could and should test that safety-critical functions are not impaired when a threat 
modulation frequency coincides with operational frequencies. Yet such procedures are not specified 
in standards and are left to the discretion of manufacturers. Naturally, responsible manufacturers 
will have developed over the years procedures to deal with such matters, but nevertheless no guid￾ance is offered in standards and there is, in particular, no formalized procedure for dealing with 
retrofits, equipment subsequently installed, etc.

The word “safe” has a different meaning to different people. For engineers it is a relative term 
that can be defined in a statistical sense — there is no absolute safety. Yet the notion of absolute 
safety is very common in the law and the media. Engineers are asked to “make sure that this never 
happens again.” The problem is in the word “never.” EM disturbances follow statistical distributions 
with a mean value and standard deviation. Events two or three standard deviations away from the 
mean are very rare but they do happen. Questions that need answering are formulated as follows: “If 
1% of this type of EM threat exceeds the designed safety limit, would this be acceptable?,” or “How 
much money should be spent to reduce this 1% to say 0.5%?” Naturally, there are no simple answers 
to these questions and our response depends on the severity of the consequences of failure, attitudes 
to risk, and cultural traits. We return to the topic of statistical EMC in Chapter 19.
EMC tests are done on brand-new equipment. However, every-day use of equipment over its 
lifetime means that its EMC performance will change and, more specifically, will deteriorate. The 
reasons are manifold, including aging of protective devices, replacement of some components with 
new parts that have different EMC characteristics, dry joints, general corrosion, ill-fitting panels 
and gaskets, etc. We have discussed the issue of EMC management in Section 12.4. The assessment 
of EMC-associated risks in a statistical sense is discussed in Chapter 19. From the practical point of 
view there is no requirement for lifetime testing. The conclusion to be drawn is that since currently 
only very few representative samples are tested at the time of manufacture, no definite statement 
can be made regarding the condition of most new equipment leaving the factory or of equipment 
after several years of use.
This is a snapshot of the situation regarding EMC and functional safety. Naturally, industries 
where safety is paramount, e.g., aerospace and automotive, are particularly active in addressing 
these issues in a systematic way and further regulatory developments are likely to emerge over the 
years to cover the entire range of industrial activities. Reference 4 should be consulted for more 
details. The final conclusion to be kept in mind is that adherence to current EMC regulations on its 
own is no guarantee of functional safety or adequate protection in product liability litigation.

19 Statistical EMC
19.1 INTRODUCTION
Current emphasis in standards, measurements, and simulations is in characterizing the response 
of systems under fixed, well-defined conditions. In Chapter 4 we have given an introduction to 
the random nature of signals. It should come as no surprise that practical systems also exhibit 
statistical behavior in their parameters and response. No two components are ever the same. 
Transistors of the same type have different parameters depending on the manufacturer, and even 
if the manufacturer is the same there are significant differences if components are coming from 
a different batch. The assembly of equipment cabinets, even of the same type, does not result in 
identical EMC performance as at high frequencies control of electrical performance is not easy. 
Two cars out of the assembly line would not give identical EMC performance. Manufacturers are 
aware of these variations and strive to establish bounds and worst-case scenarios to meet EMC 
requirements. Substantial effort was expended on the design and analysis of deterministic systems, 
systems where all parameters have a fixed known value, and rightly so. If one cannot analyze 
deterministic systems, what chance is there to analyze random systems? However, the endeavor is 
well worth the efforts for several reasons:
• Sources of EMI are statistical in nature. The amplitude, frequency, propagation direction, 
and polarization of an EM threat are not known precisely in advance but vary randomly 
around a mean value. Can we design with the mean value and also the expected spread 
in mind?
• Nominally identical systems as they actually materialize in practice off a production line 
exhibit random variations around a mean value, e.g., the gap between two ill-fitting panels 
is small and its value is a random variable. This can have a profound effect on EMC behav￾ior as it would affect the shielding effectiveness in disproportionate ways. How can we 
account for this while avoiding overdesign as an expedient to mask our poor understanding 
of the issues involved?
• The immunity of components is a statistical phenomenon as already alluded to in Chapter 9. 
Components do not fail at a fixed magnitude of a threat but with a certain probability at 
different levels. Rather than asserting that a certain component never fails (a dubious state￾ment), would it not be better to be able to say that the component at this level of threat has 
a 99% probability of survival?
• Systems are increasingly dominated by complexity. Analysts and designers must be able 
to do their jobs in an environment characterized by extreme complexity where the co￾existence of different subsystems is the order of the day. One example will suffice to illus￾trate the point — the mobile phone. This is no longer a device for audio conversation but 
includes exchange of text, video images, movie and still camera, email, GPS, MP3 player, 
notebook, etc. Increasingly more functionality is introduced, and complexity increases by 
orders of magnitude. Might it not be more sensible to design such systems recognizing 
from the beginning the statistical nature of their parameters and their responses?
• A system tested today is not the same system after 5, 10, or 20years. Meeting an EMC test 
today says something about the quality of engineering that has gone into its design. But what 
does it say about its EMC behavior in ten years’ time? The issues are the aging of various 
components, deterioration in service of contacts, etc. Although it is not difficult to quantify 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003310983-24392 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
these changes for individual components, the interesting question (for which there are no 
answers today) is how all these random changes combine together to affect overall system 
response. What is the sensitivity of the design to certain of its components or features?
• A large system today will suffer several modifications through its lifetime. These can be 
very severe, as for example in the case where electromechanical systems were partially 
replaced by solid-state systems. Here we have two different technologies with very different 
EMC characteristics combined. Without prior knowledge of the response of each technol￾ogy in the statistical sense (i.e., in terms of probability of failure) it is difficult to design 
efficiently. For reasons of cost, legacy systems are increasingly upgraded by introducing 
new technologies that are required to co-exist with older technologies. Design would be 
faster and more efficient if we understood system behavior in the statistical sense. The same 
applies to the increasing use of commercial equipment as components in military systems 
(commercial off-the-shelf equipment or COTS). Here civilian technology with its own EMC 
characteristics is combined with military technology with very different characteristics.
• Although at present, by and large, EMC standards are expressed in deterministic fashion, 
the push to high frequency is likely to require a fundamental re-examination of the basic 
approach and the introduction of statistical measures of failures, an approach that is com￾mon in the safety industry.
• Material properties, component values, and construction details all vary from sample to 
sample. A good predictive model should take account of the “fuzziness” of these param￾eters to represent in a more meaningful way system variability and uncertainty.
This list highlights the impetus for examining more deeply the response of systems not just sim￾ply through deterministic models but through stochastic models. A general discussion on statistics 
and EMC can be found in Reference 1. We give in this chapter a brief introduction into emerging 
techniques.
19.2 THE BASIC STOCHASTIC PROBLEM
A random variable X assumes a value x with a probability fx(x). This so-called probability density 
function (pdf) is in general bell-shaped as shown in Figure 19.1, although other distributions are also 
possible. The random variable X may represent the resistance of a component, the gap of an aper￾ture, etc. Naturally, in an engineering application we are interested in the impact the random nature 
of X has on some other important output parameter, e.g., the current in the case of resistance or the 
shielding effectiveness in the case of aperture size. The output parameter, let us call it Y, is in itself a 
random variable that depends on X. The key engineering question is, given the functional dependence 
of the output Y on the input X and the pdf of X, to find the pdf of Y. All the interesting problems we 
have outlined in the previous section can be formulated in this way. The mapping is shown schemati￾cally in Figure 19.2. It goes without saying that establishing the pdf of an input variable can be 
time-consuming. Even more so, the functional relationship between input and output variables can 
FIGURE 19.1 A general bell-shaped function representing a typical probability density function (pdf).Statistical EMC 393
be very difficult to establish except in simple cases where a straightforward parametric expression 
links the two. However, if we somehow obtain this information, statistical theory offers guidance 
as to how to proceed to find fy(y). We will give a simple example of this further on in this section. It 
must be pointed out that in practical problems we have more than one random input variable. Hence 
the problem is how to work out the pdf of the output quantity when the pdf of several input random 
variables are known. This adds considerable complexity to the task. In regard to the functional 
dependence, this cannot always be in the form of a simple differentiable function — much beloved 
of mathematicians — but more often than not it is the result of a numerical simulation, and it is 
implicit in a collection of data stored in computer memory. The difficulties therefore are formidable, 
but the potential rewards are considerable.
In many situations, the complete information contained in a pdf is not required and instead a few 
of its “moments” will suffice. I mean specifically its mean value X and its variance x.
2 2 σ Other higher 
moments may be desirable for more unusual distributions such as the “skew,” which measures how 
symmetric the distribution is and the “kurtosis,” which relates to how peaky the distribution is.
Consider the situation where we have random variable X (the input) for which we know its pdf 
fx(x), mean value x, and variance. x
2 σ Another quantity Y (the output) is related to X through the 
function g:
Y g = ( ) X (19.1)
Since X is a random variable, so is Y. The theory of functions of a random variable provides the 
following formulae for the pdf, mean, and variance of Y2:

where we have only kept the lowest-order terms in the expansions. If more than one random variable 
affects the output, then similar expressions are available in the literature. Complications arise when 
the variables are not statistically independent. We provide a simple example here of an application 
of Equations 19.1–19.4 to illustrate how these techniques are applied.2
Consider the situation of a resistor with a resistance value in the interval 900 to 1100 Ω, where 
the probability of having any particular value in this interval is the same (uniform distribution).

The resistance is represented by the random variable X in Equation 19.1. This resistor is connected 
to a voltage source of E = 120V. The pdf, mean value, and variance of the current are required.
The current is represented by the random variable Y in Equation 19.1 and clearly the functional

19.3 STATISTICAL APPROACHES TO EMC PROBLEMS
The analytical approach described in the previous section is not the only way to collect statistical 
information about the variability of a system. We outline some of the advantages and disadvantages 
of the available techniques.
It is possible to explore the parameter space by repeated calculations, simulations, or experi￾mental trials. This, however, is very time-consuming and expensive due to the large number of 
parameters (multidimensionality) of systems. A very large number of trials would be necessary, 
which would be prohibitive for any but the simplest systems. The alternative is to judiciously sample 
the parameter space so as to minimize the number of samples or trials and yet extract meaningful 
statistical information. There is a substantial amount of work in the design of experiments so that 
a subset of the complete set of experiments can give good-quality information, but at a fraction of 
the cost.3 There is also work in social and organizational research that may help in some situations.4
Nevertheless, this trial-and-error approach, even with the accelerators mentioned, is very time￾consuming and is not widely used in engineering applications.
A method that has been used extensively for engineering problems is the Monte Carlo method.5,6
In this method, essentially, a probabilistic model of a mathematical problem is set up and the prob￾lem is solved by using a sequence of random numbers. It is not difficult to see how the method works 
for the solution of a simple potential problem. Consider the configuration shown in Figure 19.4. 
FIGURE 19.4 Arrangement to illustrate application of the Monte Carlo method.396 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
The four boundaries of the problem are at potentials V1 to V4, respectively. We wish to calculate 
the potential at point (x, y). We set up a number generator to generate random numbers from zero 
to one. We pick a random number, and if it is less than 0.25, we move right one grid point, if it is 
between 0.25 and 0.5, we move left, if it is between 0.5 and 0.75, we move up, otherwise we move 
down. We do this until we reach a boundary where the potential is known. For random walk A, this 
happened after six throws of the dice and we reached potential V3. Now, we start another random 
walk B, which after five trials gives V2. If we were to stop at this point with only two random walks, 
we would conclude that the potential at (x, y) is (V3+V1)/2. In practice, many random walks must be 
done before an average is worked out that converges to the true value of the potential. An example 
of application of the Monte Carlo method in EMC may be found in Reference 7.
More direct methods, similar in spirit to those described in the previous section, are increasingly 
explored in efforts to address more complex problems.
One way is to introduce a small perturbation to input parameters and then study how this pertur￾bation propagates to the output. As an example, if the dielectric permittivity is the quantity with an 
uncertainty ε = ε + ε, where δ is a small variation, then all the relevant quantities are expanded in 
terms of δ (up to, say, second order). All calculations thereafter operate on the expanded quantities 
to give eventually the expansion coefficient for the required output quantity. The algebra involved 
can be handled using operator overloading available in some programming languages.8
A thorough study of the response of an electrically short two-conductor transmission line to an 
incident random wave is presented in Reference 9. This is done using techniques that are similar to 
those described in Section 19.2.
Further work based on the techniques in Section 19.2 is described in Reference 10. A general 
model in lumped circuit component form with five impedances Zn, which are random variables, is 
solved by the mesh current method to obtain,
I V = [ ] Y (19.13)
where I and V are column vectors for the mesh current and source voltage, respectively. The ele￾ments of the mean current are given by

where [Y] and [Z] are calculated at their mean values. The complexity of these equations is evident, 
and further work is required to develop efficient techniques suitable for the statistical evaluation and 
design of systems.
In the following sections of this chapter, we address in more detail the theoretical basis of sto￾chastic models and how they may be applied to EMC. This is a vast and rapidly developing area 
of work. The aim here is to sensitize readers to the possibilities of using stochastic modeling and 
bridge the gap between mathematical abstraction and the practical needs of EMC engineers.
19.4 THEORETICAL BASIS FOR STOCHASTIC MODELS
The aim of this section is to present an outline of the techniques used for stochastic modeling. 
The classical approach of using Monte Carlo techniques where a model is run for tens of thou￾sands of times, with input parameters spanning the random space, is rarely possible in EMC, 
since each model implementation is complex and time-consuming. The objective therefore is 
either to devise special stochastic models where the randomness is embedded into the model, or 
to use deterministic models for a small number of targeted input values to extract meaningful 
information about the statistics of the response. The first option describes an intrusive technique 
since the deterministic model must be modified to encompass uncertainty. The second option 
describes a non-intrusive model since no deterministic model modification is necessary. The 
deterministic model is applied a few times, and the statistical moments of the response are 
obtained through suitable processing of the responses. This represents a considerable saving 
compared to Monte Carlo implementations, where tens of thousands of trials are needed. Non￾intrusive models are the easiest to apply, and hence, we pay particular attention to their develop￾ment and implementation.
Before getting down to details, a few comments on the nature of uncertainty are appropriate. 
Statisticians identify two types of uncertainty. In cases where the uncertainty is random due to natural 
causes, we talk about aleatory uncertainty (alea, gambling in Latin). This is the type of uncertainty 
that is described by a probability distribution function and cannot be totally eliminated. The main 
parameters and characteristics of the most common, Gaussian (or normal), distribution are given in 
Appendix H. Some variability is inherent in all physical processes, and this is the type of uncertainty 
we will deal with in this section. In practice, it means that we must allow for design margins for the 
inherent variability of parameters. The other type of uncertainty we are confronted with is due to the 
lack of knowledge of how exactly something works. It is described as epistemic uncertainty (επιστήμη, 
Greek for the corpus of systematic and validated knowledge not mere opinion). This implies that per￾haps our model may not be the correct one, but nevertheless may be improved by further study and 
data collection. Further study can reduce epistemic uncertainty. Epistemic risks may be addressed by 
management action through mitigation and contingency planning.
19.4.1  Gaussian Quadrature, Polynomial Chaos Expansion, 
Statistical Collocation, and Unscented Transform
In this subsection, we outline the basic mathematical techniques underlying stochastic modeling. 
We begin by emphasizing that we are primarily interested in the statistics of the response (output) 
when one or more input parameters are random variables. In most cases, knowing the statistical 
moments of the response is enough for design and compliance purposes. More specifically, know￾ing the meanμand variance σ2 of the response will suffice, although higher moments may also be 
needed in some cases. These quantities are in the form of integrals of a function F(x), which is the 
product of the PDF times the random variable (RV) x for the mean, and (x–μx)2 for the variance.2
To clarify the notation in cases of more than one RV, μx stands for the mean value of RV x. An 
example of these formulations is shown by Equations 19.6 and 19.7. The basic mathematical task 398 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
is the evaluation of integrals of the form shown below, over the appropriate interval, when we only 
calculate the integrand at N number of points.
I F x dx a F x a F x a F x

  0 0 1 1 N N ∫ = + ( ) ( ) ( )+ + ( ) (19.18)
Our objective is to keep the number of points N small, so that with our model, we need only evaluate 
the integrand (output) a small number of times. Clearly, in Equation 19.18, we need to select “N” for the 
required accuracy, the coefficients “a”, and the evaluation points “x”. The number of evaluation points 
N depends on the degree of complexity of the function F(x). Once N is chosen, points “x” and coef￾ficients “a” may be derived from semi-empirical considerations or in a more systematic mathematical 
manner. In order to standardize this procedure, it is convenient to change the limits of integration to 
−1…+1. This is done easily by a change of the variable “x” to “r”, through the transformation x=c0+c1r.11
The two constants c0 and c1 are obtained from the actual integral limits so that Equation 19.18 becomes,

 using the minimum 
possible number N of evaluations of the integrand F. The classical mathematical result for this 
problem is due to Gauss, and the approach is known as Gaussian quadrature. According to Gauss, 
the best accuracy with N+1 evaluation points “x” is obtained if these points are the zeros of the

The evaluation points and weights are tabulated for different N. As an example, for N = 2 we have,
With three evaluation points, accuracy is satisfactory for functions up to second degree.
We now consider how these basic mathematical ideas may be extended and adapted for the solu￾tion of stochastic problems where the objective is the calculation of moments of the output function 
(Equations 19.6 and 19.7). The fundamental idea here is the approximation of the output function 
as a sum of known orthogonal polynomials “Φi
” with unknown coefficients. This formulation is 
known as a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). The orthogonality of the polynomials facilitates 
the calculation of the unknown coefficients. The choice of the orthogonal polynomial depends on 
the nature of the stochastic process we are concerned with. For a Gaussian process, the orthogonal 
polynomials are as already mentioned; the Hermite polynomial is “H” and thus the expansion is,

Here, u represents the vector of outputs, and x, t, and ξ are the vectors of inputs, time, and the ran￾dom variable, respectively. The particular point on the random space is represented by ω, the expec￾tation being that we can obtain the moments of the output for a small number of selected ω values. 
The vector of unknown coefficients is represented by ui

the Hermite polynomials are replaced by other orthogonal polynomials Φ so that Equation 19.21 in

H x 0 1 1, H x x, H x 2 x 1 2 () () () = = = −
We see that the more terms we keep in the PCE, the higher-order polynomials we employ and hence 
the better we can approximate complex functions. We now consider how we can solve a stochastic 
problem using PCE as shown in Equation 19.22. Stating this problem more formally, we seek to 
solve a system of differential equations of the form,
,t, ; ,t, f ,t,        { } x u ξω ξω () () ( )( ) x x = ξ( ) ω (19.25)
In this expression,  stands for an operator (e.g., a differential operator), 
u is the unknown response 
(output), and f is the driving function. The rest of the quantities are as defined in connection with 
Equation 19.21. In general, we may have N random variables (dimension of vector 

We see from Equation 19.26 that when we have many RVs and, for accuracy, we choose higher￾degree expansion polynomials, the upper limit in the summation in Equation 19.22, although not 
infinite, can nevertheless be very large, making computation difficult and time-consuming. This is 
known in technical jargon as the “curse of dimensionality” and is addressed in the next subsection. 
Substituting Equation 19.22 into Equation 19.25, we obtain,

These are Q+1 equations which when solved give us the unknown expansion coefficients ui

physical terms, this approach may be understood as minimizing errors by projecting to each expan￾sion polynomial (weighted residual method). Considerable simplification of these equations results 
due to the orthogonality of the expansion polynomials Equation 19.23. Each of the equations is 
deterministic. Nevertheless, they are simultaneous coupled equations and require modifications to 
the deterministic solver (an intrusive stochastic model).

 at a small number of points. No modification 
of the deterministic solver is required; hence, this method is non-intrusive and is known in the litera￾ture as statistical collocation method. In broad terms, in the first approach we demand the weighted 
integral of the residual (error) to be zero, while in the second approach we demand the residual to 
be zero at selected points. The latter approach is simpler to apply in complex problems such as those 
encountered in EMC studies; hence, we focus on non-intrusive methods. A more complete math￾ematical background may be found in the mathematical literature, e.g., References 12 to 16.

We now describe an approach based on statistical collocation known as the unscented transform 
(UT).17–20 We start from Equation (19.1), which shows the output RV Y as a non-linear mapping of 
the input RV X, through a function g. Random variable X is equal to its mean value plus a RV with 
zero mean.

where, for brevity, we have used the polynomial p(.) to indicate the expansion terms. The expected

Y E = + { } g X( ) x E ˆ = + { } g X( ) E p{ } ( ) x g ˆ = + ( ) X P (19.37)
where P is the expected value of the polynomial p(.). Similarly, we can obtain the variance,

The objective of the UT approach is to evaluate the expressions for mean and variance using a

The order of the approximation k depends on the truncation of the polynomial p(.). There are a num￾ber of possible choices for the weights and sigma points, but the simplest choice is the one used for 
Gaussian quadrature integration as mentioned before. For a Gaussian PDF, the weights and sigma 
points for second and fourth order are given in the table below.
Taking as an example a Gaussian PDF and a second-order approximation requires evaluation of 
the output at three points,
X 1.73 −σ +σ X X , X, X 1.73
Thus, through numerical simulations, experimentation, or whatever other means, we obtain the 
output at these three points,
g X( ) − σ 1.73 X X , g( ) X , g X( ) + σ 1.73
Then, estimates of the mean and variance of the output are obtained from the following formulae:

Equations 19.41 offer a powerful means of obtaining the statistics of the output through only 
three evaluations. This is in contrast to Monte Carlo techniques, where a large number of trials

is necessary to obtain equivalent accuracy results. Higher accuracy may be obtained if we use a 
higher, fourth-order, approximation at the expense of a greater number of evaluations. If we require 
higher statistical moments of the output, it may be necessary to use a higher order of approximation. 
Since in practical EMC problems each evaluation of the output requires lengthy and complicated 
simulations or experimental procedures, the approach described above has distinct advantages. 
We will refer to examples of applications to EMC in the sections to follow. Similar expressions may 
be found in the references already given for other PDFs, e.g., a uniform distribution. However, we 
first address the issue of more than one input random variable. As an example, we mention the case 
of calculating the shielding effectiveness of a cabinet with a slot. In this case, we have two RVs: the 
slot length and the slot width. If we select a second-order approximation (three evaluation points 
per RV), then we need in total 32 = 9 evaluations. We present below as an example the weights and 
sigma points for a second-order approximation or two independent RVs, which both have a uniform 
distribution in the range −1…+1.
The numbers in bold are the weights for each term in the expansion. The mean value of the out￾put is the weighted sum of the nine evaluations as shown below.

The variance is similarly obtained as in the second of Equation 19.41 by forming a weighted sum 
of all nine solutions. Approximations of the PDF and of the cross-correlation coefficients can also 
be obtained using UT.19
19.4.2  The Curse of Dimensionality
We have seen in the previous section that the more random variables we have, the larger the number 
of solutions we need to obtain. Although each such solution is a deterministic problem, the number 
required escalates rapidly, making it difficult to perform the required number of simulations or 
experiments. This problem is known as the curse of dimensionality and needs addressing if solu￾tions to practical stochastic problems are to be obtained. As an example of the numbers involved, if 
we seek a fourth-order solution with two random variables, we need 52 = 25 solutions. For second￾order accuracy and three RVs, we need 33 = 27 solutions. The problems we face is to select a smaller 
number of solutions without unduly sacrificing accuracy. This problem in mathematics is referred to 
as sparsification (sparse grids) or dimension reduction. A full treatment is beyond the scope of this 
book. The interested reader may consult References 21–25.

For the case of only one random variable (one dimension), distributed uniformly in the range 
−1 to +1, the sigma points and corresponding weights are shown in Figure 19.5a for second-order 
accuracy (3 points), and in (b) for fourth-order accuracy (5 points).
We now consider the case of two uniformly distributed RVs, RV1 and RV2, and second-order 
approximations for each RV (three points). The grid of points where an evaluation is required is 
shown in Figure 19.6a. In this diagram, the left superscript indicates whether we have RV1 or RV2. 
The number of evaluations is 32 = 9 as shown. For each evaluation point of the two-dimensional 
function, the weight is the product of the two corresponding RV weights as shown in Section 19.4.1.
We illustrate dimension reduction by two examples of a 2D (2 RVs) and 3D (3 RVs) functions. 
The univariate dimension reduction (UDR) is the technique that approximates multi-dimensional 
functions by 1D functions. Consider as an example a 2D function f(X, Y), where X and Y are RVs. 
We expand into a Taylor series around the mean values of the two RVs.

ˆ
f X( ) ,Y = + f X( )( )( ) ,Y f X,Y − f X,Y (19.46)
where we neglected higher-order terms. In evaluating the three functions in Equation 19.46, we use 
the modified grid shown in Figure 19.6b. The argument of the last function on the RHS corresponds 
to the hatched point shown at the center of the grid. The first and second functions are evaluated 
at the three horizontal and three vertical points, respectively. The four points at the corners of the 
grid indicated by hollow circles are not required. Hence, in this approximation, using a sparse grid 
we require five evaluations instead of the nine evaluations required for the full grid. The savings 
in the number of evaluations become more significant the larger the number of RVs. It remains to 
show how the weight factors can be calculated for the reduced number of evaluation points resulting 
from sparsification. For the four solid circle points in Figure 19.6b, the weights are 0.278, as for a 
single RV as shown in Figure 19.5a. To meet the constraints of the first expression in Equation 19.40, 
the weight w0 at the central point is equal to w 1 0 = − 4 0.278 0.112 × = − . A similar scheme based 
on UDR may also be applied when we use fourth-order approximation for the case of two RVs as 
shown in Figure 19.7.
Here, the approximation reduces the number of evaluations from 25 to 9. The benefits of dimen￾sion reduction are greater if we look at the problem of three RVs. A full grid with a second-order 
approximation (three points per RV) requires 33 = 27 evaluations as shown in Figure 19.8 by points 
indicated by small and large circles. Using the same approach as for two RVs, sparsification based 
on UDR reduces the evaluation grid to seven points as indicated by the six filled large circles and 
the central hatched large circle.
We see from the examples of UDR that in this approximation, we totally neglect the off-diagonal 
elements in the full grid. This, in some circumstances, may be an unacceptable approximation. The

It is important to realize that in dimension reduction, there are two approximations: the number 
of points per RV (e.g., three or five points) and the number of off-diagonal elements accounted 
for (UDR or BDR). The seminal paper on sparse grids is due to Smolyak.26 Adaptive expansion 
schemes, which aim at taking account of the impact of each RV, with examples from EMC applica￾tions, are described in References 27 and 28.
19.5 APPLICATIONS OF STOCHASTIC MODELS IN EMC
A brief introduction to the treatment of signals and noise was given in Chapter 4 of this book. 
Inevitably, a full characterization of noise and of the propagation of uncertainties in complex sys￾tems requires a more powerful analytical framework than was presented in Chapter 4. The level 
of mathematics required is at a specialist level and thus cannot be presented here. It is, however, 
important to outline issues and techniques that may be required, so that the EMC engineer is aware 
of what can be achieved in stochastic studies with specialist mathematical support. In this section, 
we first sketch out some of the conceptual adjustments to be made when dealing with stochastic 
signals and establish some of the terminologies used in advanced analysis. We then present some 
applications based on the techniques described in this and in the previous section.
We start by emphasizing the importance of the concept of correlation of signals when dealing 
with noise and uncertainties. Chapter 4 outlines some of the underlying ideas behind random sig￾nals and should be consulted first. Emissions in complex systems are the result of a multitude of 
sources, many of which are uncorrelated. In such circumstances, the idea of signal amplitude when 
we look at propagation of noise and uncertainties is not relevant and instead the autocorrelation of 
signals is a far more useful quantity. Autocorrelation is a measure of the similarity between a signal 
and a delayed copy of it, as shown in Equation 4.19. In digital parlance, we calculate the autocor￾relation of a time series with a lagged version of it over varying time intervals τ. In practice, we 
limit the duration of a signal s(t) over a finite time T and we indicate this time limited signal by ST(t).

The correlation spectrum may also be obtained from the Fourier transform of the signals through 
an ensemble average,
C lim 1
2T ij S S T iT jT* ( ) ω = ( ) ω ω( ) →∞
(19.51)
where * indicates a complex conjugate. Since the autocorrelation spectrum Cii(ω) describes the 
spectral density of the signal si
(t), it is the quantity most often used to describe the propagation of 
noise and uncertainty in stochastic problems. For stochastic signals, the autocorrelation function 
cii(τ) generally tends to zero as τ increases. This means that as the time shift τ increases, there is a 
weaker relationship between instantaneous values of the signal at different times. The correlation 
time τcor is the time interval over which we can predict the evolution of a signal from its previous 
values. Trying to project information about the signal beyond the correlation time is not possible 
as the fragments of the signal a correlation time apart are effectively two independent variables. 
The correlation time is defined as follows:
1
c 0 cor c d ii

0 ( ) ∫ τ = τ( ) τ

(19.52)
Figure 19.10 depicts a typical rate of variation of correlation (solid line) as τ increases. The correla￾tion time is defined so that the area under the solid curve is equal to the hatched area as expressed 
mathematically by (19.52).
An effective bandwidth may also be defined in a similar way as in Figure 19.10. Its product with 
the correlation time is of order one.
∆ωeff c τ ≈ or 1 (19.53)
This implies that the wider the noise bandwidth, the shorter the correlation time and the signal is 
more chaotic. Using the expressions in Section 4.2.2, one can, for stationary signals, obtain the 
variance of a noise voltage, which has a spectrum maximum value Vmax as follows:Statistical EMC 409

where E[.] stands for the expectation value, μi

Cyclostationary signals are commonly encountered in EMC emission studies, and their character￾ization can help in identifying specific areas of emission from PCBs. A treatment of cyclostationar￾ity from an EMC perspective may be found in Reference 29.
An extensive analysis of random signals can be found in specialist texts albeit at an increasingly 
advanced mathematical level.30–33 A useful treatment of noise from an engineering perspective may 
be found in Reference 34.
We now consider some of the general applications of these techniques in EM field propagation 
and in EMC studies.
Early applications of probabilistic techniques to EM problems as an alternative to Monte Carlo￾based approaches are described in Reference 35 in connection with radar cross section (RCS) 
problems. Statistical problems were also analyzed using the FDTD method to deal with a number

geometrical and materials uncertainties.36–38 Another approach for dealing with uncertainties in 
scattering problems is based on a modified multilevel Monte Carlo method.39 More recently, there 
has been extensive work done to develop surrogate models of complex systems encountered in EMC 
studies. The models for dealing with uncertainties described in the previous section are based on 
expansion techniques (e.g., PCE) requiring the calculation of a large number of parameters (para￾metric models). As problem complexity increases, this leads to the curse of dimensionality and we 
have shown ways to address this issue through sparse grids. An alternative are the surrogate (meta-)
models, which are effectively simplified models of models with very few parameters. These are 
characterized as non-parametric models.
They are based on regression techniques whereby we attempt to go from a messy set of data, 
which are hard to interpret, to a simpler, easier-to-manipulate model of the data. The term regres￾sion originates from the expression “regression to the mean,” where successive collection of data 
regresses to the mean value. An example of such a simple model is a linear fit to a set of data using 
least squares. There are, however, more sophisticated approaches to this problem. The situation is 
depicted in Figure 19.11.
The objective is to use the input data and a full computational model to generate a training set, 
which can then be employed to establish, through a process of regression, an alternative simpler 
“surrogate” model, which is far easier to use than the full model and yet provides adequate accuracy.
It is not possible to give a full description of these techniques without delving much deeper into 
the theory of random processes. The underlying idea is a technique known as Bayesian inference. It 
is based on Bayes’ theorem in Equation 19.59, which allows us from some prior knowledge or belief 
to calculate the probability of a related event.
P A | B P B| A P A
P B ( ) ( ) ( )
( ) = (19.59)
In this expression, P(A|B) is the conditional probability that event A occurs, provided that event B 
has already occurred. P(A) is the marginal probability of event A occurring. The meaning of the 
other two quantities in Equation 19.59 is obvious. In this expression, the probabilities represent a 
random number, but we can extend this idea to the so-called model interpretation of Bayes’ theorem 
as shown below.
P | d P d | P
P d ( ) ( ) ( )
( ) Θ = Θ Θ (19.60)
Here, Θ represents the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, mean value and standard deviation, 
which we wish to determine, and d stands for the data we have (the evidence). P(Θ|d) is thus the pos￾terior distribution we wish to determine, based on the prior distribution P(Θ), which represents our

beliefs. P(d|Θ) is the likelihood based on observation data. P(d) is the marginal distribution for the data 
otherwise known as the evidence. Thus, Equation 19.60 represents the process whereby we derive a 
posterior distribution based on our prior beliefs and influenced by the likelihood distribution. Based 
on such ideas, a technique known as Gaussian process regression or Kriging had been used to derive 
surrogate models.40 D. G. Krige, a mining engineer, was the first to derive the most likely distribution 
of gold deposits from a few samples obtained from bore holes. Applications of surrogate models, risk 
analysis, and characterization of extreme events in EMC are discussed in References 41 and 42.
In EMC studies, it is important to be able to establish the susceptibility level of equipment so that 
proper mitigation measures may be implemented. It will come as no surprise that the susceptibility 
level is in itself a random variable. Its distribution may be established using Bayesian inference and 
other approaches such as maximum likelihood inference.43
The use of correlation techniques may also be used for the reduction of complexity in near￾field scans of stochastic EM fields.44,45 In general, stochastic data are difficult to characterize and 
it is normally necessary to exploit statistical techniques to reduce complexity. As already men￾tioned, characterization of multidimensional stochastic signals X

 is based on correlation matrices. 
An approach known as principal component analysis (PCA) may be used to reduce complexity. It is 
based on finding the eigenvectors i

ϕ and corresponding eigenvalues λi
 of the correlation matrix and 
then apply the Karhunen–Loeve transform (KLT) to data X using a matrix [Φ] with columns the 
eigenvectors of the correlation matrix.

= Φ[ ] (19.61)
The KLT transform has interesting properties in that it conserves energy and decorrelates signals, 
and by choosing to retain only components corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, we can cap￾ture most of the signal energy at a substantially reduced level of complexity.46 Applications of these 
ideas to complexity reduction and emission source identification in EMC problems may be found 
in References 47 to 50.
Adaptations of numerical techniques to deal directly with stochastic fields are based on the 
application of Green’s function formulations and are described for the MoM and TLM methods in 
References 51 and 52.
Statistical collocation techniques have been applied extensively in crosstalk, wire, and cable 
coupling problems. In addition to the statistical moments of the response, its probability density 
function may also de estimated. Examples of EMC applications are available in the literature, e.g., 
on crosstalk53 and cable coupling.54–59

20 EMC in Different 
Industrial Sectors
The general principles of EMC design and analysis were described in previous chapters, together 
with techniques that can be used for testing and modeling to confirm compliance with industrial 
and regulatory requirements. There are, however, particular issues and trends that arise in different 
industrial sectors, which we will highlight in the present chapter. The material that follows should 
be read in conjunction with the more general, generic, discussions of EMC, which were presented 
in previous chapters. It is also inevitable that as technology progresses, readers need to keep abreast 
of developments by regularly accessing up-to-date regulatory updates.
20.1 EMC IN AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS
The traditional approach to EMC in connection with automotive applications is to resort to the well￾established EMC compliance standards. An example of this is the UN harmonized technical regula￾tions for wheeled vehicles, where Regulation 10 addresses EMC issues.1 However, this approach on 
its own is not sufficient to pre-empt problems related to EMC and safety in modern vehicles. The 
fundamental reason that a broader approach to EMC-related safety issues is necessary in the years 
to come is the tendency to replace human interventions during driving by electronic inputs based on 
the capture and processing of signals from numerous sensors. In order for such systems to be safe 
and accepted by users, a very high level of safety and reliability must be ensured in the face of all 
conceivable threats. Vehicles must be resilient to electromagnetic threats originating from inside 
or outside vehicles. This requires a holistic approach encompassing traditional EMC methodolo￾gies and risk-based safety principles. The problem is not exclusive to automotive applications, but 
it is particularly stark in the automotive environment where highly dynamic, high-density, multi￾operator situations prevail. It is therefore expected and highly desired that EMC and risk-based 
approaches are brought together to address potential problems.
Resilience refers to the maintenance of dependable systems in the face of continuous change and, 
in the context of automotive applications, the maintenance and resumption of essential functions 
without catastrophic degradation in performance in the presence of threats.2
The level of automation, the reliance on electronic systems for safety-critical functions, and the 
level of complexity in modern automotive software systems connected to the Internet require a risk￾based safety design approach and protection against unauthorized access (cybersecurity).3–6
Traditional EMC standards are naturally applicable, but do not necessarily encompass the com￾plexities and the problems that arise when motive power does not originate from internal combustion 
engines, but from electrical drives through complex powertrains. The difficulties are compounded 
by the high degree of automation (autonomous driving), the degree of network connectivity that this 
requires, and the reduced EM shielding properties of materials used in modern cars in an effort to 
reduce weight. The level of risk is dependent on the likelihood that a particular threat will occur and 
the harm that it may cause.2,3 Exposure likelihood ranges from category E0 (very unlikely) to E4 
(highly probable) and the severity of the consequences from S0 (no injuries) to S3 (life-threatening). 
An additional factor is to what extent any of these threats can be controlled. All these different 
aspects must to be considered throughout vehicle development, using modeling and experimenta￾tion. The important safety parameter is the Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL).
Allied to these requirements for reliable and resilient systems is the need to minimize human 
exposure to low- and high-frequency fields.7,8 The relevant legal framework in various territories is set

by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Telecommunication 
Union (ITU),9 the European Union (EU),10 and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)11 in the USA. 
Specialist texts dedicated to automotive EMC may also be consulted.12,13
Specific issues of EMC design for electronic systems in automotive applications are addressed 
in References 14 and 15. An extensive review of EMC and EM resilience in vehicles may be found 
in Reference 16.
To sensitize readers to the EMC technical issues involved, and the wider context of interoperability, 
we briefly describe the developing technologies of radar sensors rapidly being introduced into vehi￾cles. A typical configuration is shown in Figure 20.1, where front, back, and lane-changing radars are 
shown. In practice, more radar sensors are installed to cover short-, medium-, and long-range sensing. 
In this figure, the antenna pattern is also shown to indicate that the illumination and reflection patterns 
are complicated and the received signals will be a combination of reflections from the main beam and 
also from the sidelobes. A combination of radar sensors is required to implement a range of tasks, e.g., 
collision avoidance and parking. Operating frequencies are in the range 21–26GHz and 76–81GHz. 
These bands are further subdivided to accommodate long- and short-range functions. The most com￾mon choice of radar technology is the frequency-modulated, continuous wave radar (FMCW). The 
choice of continuous wave results in inexpensive straightforward construction, and the modulation 
allows distance as well as velocity of nearby targets to be detected. The Doppler shift in frequency 
from a moving target allows the determination of the target velocity from the following formula,
f 2v
f
c d
t ≈ (20.1)
where v is the relative velocity of the target to the vehicle, fd and ft
 are the Doppler and transmit 
frequencies, and c is the speed of light. The target speed can be determined from the knowledge of 
the vehicle speed relative to a fixed target (egomotion). The distance to the target is determined from 
the delay of the reflected signal. A survey of radar technologies applied in the automotive environ￾ment may be found in Reference 17.
It should be apparent that in on-road applications, several cars, motorcycles, pedestrians, and 
other targets will be simultaneously present, some moving fast, some slowly, and some stationary, 
and the weather conditions will vary. A schematic of a possible scenario is shown in Figure 20.2, 
where an intersection is shown. A front illumination radar will receive a multitude of signals and not 
merely a signal scattered from the main beam. The task is from a fusion of all information received 
from a multitude of sensors, to form a perception of the surrounding environment and make a rapid 
situation assessment, which triggers a reaction ensuring safe driving. This is a complex task and 
requires a combination not just of EMC techniques, but also of advanced concepts in pattern recog￾nition, image processing, and machine learning.
There is an extensive literature on interference cancellation in automotive radar applications 
based on advanced signal processing techniques.18–20 It is also pointed out that the road infrastruc￾ture associated with electric vehicles needs to be considered in the context of EMC and interop￾erability. We have already addressed in this book the issue of wireless power transfer (WPT) in 
Section 16.5. Addressing electric grid-related issues is also essential. Some material relevant to the 
power grid may be found in Reference 21.

20.2 EMC IN RAILWAY APPLICATIONS
EMC considerations in connection with railway systems are subject to the same principles and tech￾niques as other industrial sectors, but there are aspects of railway systems that present special EMC 
challenges. Railways operate in an extensive challenging environment and are one of the longest estab￾lished industrial sectors. Many countries have railway networks first established centuries ago with a 
multitude of legacy protection and signaling systems. In recent decades, new rapid transit systems in 
metropolitan areas have been added, together with high-speed networks in close proximity to legacy 
systems. In many countries, the motive power for traction is primarily provided by diesel–electric units. 
In addition, all electric trains run in parallel tracks or share the same track. The long-held practice of 
train protection relying on visual signals from trackside equipment acted upon by the driver is not pos￾sible as at high speeds. In excess of 300 km/hour, the driver cannot be expected to respond reliably. 
Automatic electronic signaling is therefore necessary to enhance train protection and control at high 
operating speeds, and high density of trains operating in a short stretch of track. Moreover, passengers 
require access to Internet services as part of their journey and operate themselves a range of electronic 
equipment requiring high-speed communications. At the continental scale, international journeys cross￾ing different jurisdictions encounter different signaling systems and/or supply frequencies and voltages. 
This is typical of European railways which are required to operate across several countries seamlessly 
and safely. All these issues raise problems of EMC and interoperability. We will outline in this chapter 
some of these issues and the techniques developed to address them. It is not possible to describe every 
railway system and its particular features, but the examples below will provide sufficient insight to assist 
the reader in asking the right questions and to seek further detailed system-specific information.
We focus on the main AC railway electrification systems. DC electrification systems are some￾what different, drawing current through a third rail located on the ground next to the track. The first 
AC supply configuration is the rail-return system shown in Figure 20.3.
It depicts the current supply to the train through the overhead line, the pantograph, motor-drive 
transformer, wheel brushes, and return through the track. Some return current inevitably flows 
through the soil as shown schematically in Figure 20.3. This configuration has the advantage of sim￾plicity as it only requires a single overhead line, but from the EMC point of view is problematic. The 
issue is that the current loop is very large, leading to the leakage of magnetic fields over a large area 
in the proximity of the railway. This may cause interference problems to residents and businesses 
located close to the railway, and also to trackside signaling and protection equipment. Typically, a 
distance of 15m from the center of the track defines the boundary where most interference problems 
may occur. This configuration may be improved from the EMC point of view if the area of the sup￾ply loop is reduced. There are two alternatives to the rail-return system: the booster transformer and 
FIGURE 20.2 Schematic showing the multitude of reflections in a complex dynamic environment.418 Principles and Techniques of Electromagnetic Compatibility
the autotransformer configurations.22–24 In both cases, the approach is to reduce the size of the cur￾rent loop. If the loop is reduced to two parallel wires in close proximity, carrying equal and opposite 
current, then the magnetic field outside the loop is significantly reduced.
The configuration using a booster transformer is shown schematically in Figure 20.4.
Here, in addition to the overhead line connecting to the pantograph, there is an overhead return 
line. The booster transformer consists of two identical coils, and therefore, this forces the two cur￾rents to be nearly equal. Some current returns through the track and soil, but is much reduced by 
the action of the booster transformer. Thus, the current loop size is effectively reduced. Booster 
transformers are placed every few km. Naturally, this requires another overhead wire, and booster 
transformers introduce a series impedance in the power distribution loop resulting in voltage drops 
and reduced power supply to the train.
The third configuration is the so-called autotransformer connection shown schematically in 
Figure 20.5.
The approach here is to reduce the size of the current loop, while simultaneously avoiding intro￾ducing a series impedance. The auxiliary or auto-feeder line is also placed overhead and carries 
some of the return current to reduce emissions. A schematic of the current flows in this configura￾tion is shown in Figure 20.6. The two autotransformers on either side of the train each have two 
identical magnetically coupled coils. For each autotransformer, the requirement that the ampere 
turns on the two coils must sum to zero ensures that each coil carries equal and opposite currents as 
shown. Assuming that I1=I2=0.25I, then the catenary current is equal to I and the rest of the current 
flows are as indicated in Figure 20.5.
From the EMC perspective, the booster and autotransformer connections are better than the rail￾return. The autotransformer configuration is better than the booster connection as it avoids voltage 
drops and is hence preferred in long-haul, high-speed, and heavy-duty applications. Simulations and

experiments confirming the emission characteristics of the three different configurations may be 
found in Reference 24. On-site testing for EMC in railways is described in Reference 25.
The traditional requirements and concerns of EMC engineers working on the railways are cov￾ered by the series of standards first issued starting in 2006, known as EN 50121/IEC 62263.26
We now consider the EMC and interoperability issues arising from communications-based 
train control systems. Traditional means of train protection and control rely on visual signals and 
exchange of tokens and are not appropriate in the case of high-speed trains and high-density met￾ropolitan train networks. Moreover, train systems must work seamlessly across national boundaries 
to ensure interoperability and fast train connections between major urban areas across national 
borders. Increasingly, traditional schemes are being replaced by communication systems that can

give authority for trains to proceed or initiate braking, with or without driver intervention. There are 
two major communications-based train systems: the communications-based train control (CBTC) 
and the European Train Control System (ETCS).27 The two systems have many similarities and 
overlaps, but also some differences. Broadly speaking, CBTC is used in mass transit systems with 
emphasis on driverless operation, while ETCS is applied mainly in long-haul routes with emphasis 
on interoperability. Both systems are evolving, and the differences mentioned above are increas￾ingly blurred. One way in which control and protection systems differ is whether they enforce a 
fixed- or moving-block operation. In the conventional fixed-block operation, the track is divided into 
sections (typically 1 km long) and only one train is allowed at a time in each section. This is ensured 
through communications between trackside and train-mounted systems. In contrast, in the moving￾block operation, the minimum allowed distance between trains is not fixed, but is determined by 
train speed and other factors. The latter more dynamic approach allows for a higher train density. 
As an example, Levels 1 and 2 in ETCS are based on fixed-block operation and Level 3 on moving￾block operation. Depending on the choice made, a range of levels of automation may be achieved. 
Clearly, strict communication protocols are required to achieve the required levels of safely, auto￾mation, and interoperability. Standards for communications-based train systems are undergoing a 
rapid evolution from slow data rates based on 2G to faster rates based on 4G and beyond. Examples 
are the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM-R), IEEE 802.11, and the Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) systems.28–30
Reliance on communications systems for safety-critical control and protection in a highly 
complex dynamic environment inevitably raises critical questions of the prompt availability of 
communications under all conceivable circumstances. A typical scenario for a communications 
environment is depicted in Figure 20.7.
Here we see a range of environments, from highly resonant areas to open space with multiple 
reflections, through which trains traverse at high speed. The potential for interference, loss of com￾munications, and transmission errors is significant, and therefore, extensive studies are required to 
design and validate communication systems to avoid such problems. The design of these systems is 
based on hybrid numerical modeling techniques as described in Section 8.7.31
Extensive railway systems also require protection from deliberate interference to ensure maxi￾mum security.32
20.3 EMC IN AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS
EMC considerations in aerospace applications broadly follow practices in other industrial sectors, 
but there are some particular challenges which are specific to flight systems. The objective of this 
section is to point out some of the challenges and direct the reader to more specialist published 
material.
In commercial and military aviation, the current trend is the move to More Electric Aircraft 
(MEA), fly-by-wire control technologies, and the use of carbon fiber composites (CFCs) due to their 
superior strength-to-weight ratio. In all these cases, the objective is to reduce weight, effect more 
sophisticated control, and reduce environmental impact. However, from the EMC point of view,

all these developments present further challenges to designers. The general EMC standard appli￾cable to aviation is a series known as DO-160 developed by the Radio Technical Commission for 
Aeronautics (RTCA) and the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE).33
There is a number of specialist texts addressing EMC in the aerospace environment.34–37 Several 
research projects are active focused on MEA, e.g., funded by the European Union, such as the 
CLEANSKY.38 The CLEANSKY project extends over three periods: CLEANSKY 1 (2008–2017), 
CLEANSKY 2 (2014–2024), and Clean Aviation. The elements of EMC are included in all stages 
of the project.
As is to be expected, coupling to cables inside aircraft is a long-standing issue exacerbated 
by the extensive use in construction of CFCs instead of aluminum alloys. Some approaches for 
designing cabling inside aircraft based on modeling techniques may be found in References 39 
and 40. Another factor that needs to be considered is the extensive use by passengers of electronic 
devices during flight. These so-called personal electronic devices (PEDs) may contribute to the 
background EM environment and thus to EMC compliance.41 Shielding effectiveness testing in 
aircraft is addressed in Reference 42. The EM performance of aircraft in the presence of extensive 
areas made of CFCs and under the threat of a lightning strike is a complex matter. CFCs panels are 
constructed from a number of layers and are thus non-uniform and anisotropic as regards current 
flow. There are also metallic parts, rivets, and other components used in construction, and thus 
the distribution of current flowing on the skin of an aircraft, and thus the penetrating EM field are 
difficult to predict. Some insights into current flow under these circumstances, obtained through 
simulations, may be found in Reference 43.
We now address EMC-related issues arising during space flights. Space flights exhibit all the 
safety and EMC-related issues we encounter in conventional aviation, but with the added demands 
brought about by a very hostile environment, very high cost one-off designs, and highly demanding 
scientific missions requiring very low background noise levels. In addition, the difficulty or total 
impossibility of implementing repairs during space flight means that designs must be thoroughly 
tested and validated on the ground prior to the craft encountering the real operational environment. 
This is a highly specialist area, and we can only offer a basic introduction in the present text.
A general introduction and guidance to EMC in space vehicles is available from the European 
Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS)44 and the American Institute for Aeronautics and 
Astronautics (AIAA).45 The additional challenges typical of spacecraft include very low noise 
requirements, sound grounding practices, multipaction, electrostatic charging, and magnetic 
cleanliness.34–37
The very low noise designs are needed as sensor signals in space applications are very low and 
can be easily swamped by interference. A typical situation is depicted in Figure 20.8, where a sensor 
signal can be corrupted by signals induced on the reference conductor.
Although this is a common situation in all designs, the requirements in space applications are 
particularly onerous, demanding very good ground plane designs in circuit boards and similar situ￾ations. Power distribution is achieved through dc-to-dc converters to minimize coupling, and the 
sensor

battery negative is connected to the chassis in most cases. In some instances, such as in Russian 
spacecraft, the power distribution is isolated from the chassis or connected to it through a bleed R–C 
parallel combination. The advantage of this configuration is that it is tolerant against single short￾circuit faults, but on the negative side, it increases common-mode noise.37 The grounding choices 
finally adopted depend on the particularities of each mission.
Multipactor discharges are due to RF breakdown due to the formation of electron avalanches 
under high vacuum conditions. These discharges generate EM noise and may also lead to short 
circuits and even system failure.46
In the space environment, radiation and particles impinge primarily on the surface of spacecraft 
causing electrical charging, high electric fields, and electrostatic discharges, ultimately leading to 
malfunctions and failures. Typical mechanisms for charging are shown in Figure 20.9.47 Equilibrium 
is reached when the total collected and the emitted currents are equal.
A requirement particular to spacecraft is magnetic cleanliness. Most space missions include very 
sensitive magnetometers for measuring very weak interplanetary magnetic fields. The craft may 
contain materials which contribute remanent magnetic field and induced fields as a result of external 
applied fields. The total contribution of all these components must be kept low, typically in the range 
0.1–1 nT.48 Each part of the craft is represented by a number of equivalent magnetic moments. For 
a simple circular electric current I, as shown in Figure 20.10a, the equivalent magnetic moment is,
m = SInˆ (20.2)
where nˆ is the unit vector normal to the loop. For a more general distribution of currents, the equiva￾lent expression (assuming distances are much larger than the distributed current volume) is shown 
below with reference to Figure 20.10b.

The magnetic moments of each contributing component are obtained by a combination of analy￾sis, measurement, and estimates based on previous experience.
It is worth pointing out the inherent complexity of a space mission involving not just the scien￾tific objectives, but also practical considerations associated with the launch platform, rocketry, and 
interactions between them. In any given mission, there may be several standards and practices to be 
adhered to specific to each particular site, e.g., see References 45, 50, and 51.
20.4 EMC IN MARINE APPLICATIONS
In this section, we address some of the peculiarities of the marine environment and how they impact 
on EMC. This is an area where EMC and safety are closely linked and there is a multitude of rules 
and regulations covering similar systems which frequently appear poorly coordinated. Moreover, 
there are variations in rules in different jurisdictions, particular craft, and operational environ￾ments. It is therefore necessary for engineers to be aware of this level of complexity, seek up-to￾date guidance, and adapt designs to particular needs. With this proviso, we give in this section 
some guidance on the regulatory environments. It is necessary to draw a distinction between small 
craft (e.g., yachts), commercial, and naval ships. Key players in setting safety rules (which impact 
on EMC) in the maritime environment are the International Maritime Organization (IMO) — a 
body under the auspices of the United Nations, and the International Association of Classification 
Societies (IACS). Because of the safety-critical nature of maritime traffic, many jurisdictions have 
adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). These bodies and vari￾ous test houses around the world produce guides that may be consulted for up-to-date information 
in particular cases. Indicative examples will be given below.
From the EMC point of view, two areas are particularly important in the maritime environment, 
earthing and the integrity of radio communications.
Regarding the earthing (grounding) arrangements on board ships, the hull and all exposed conduct￾ing parts are the “earth.” Earthing practice in the maritime environment may differ from that on land. 
The different earthing schemes are outlined in IEC 60364-1.52 The nomenclature adopted is based on a 
maximum of three letters indicating the chosen earthing arrangement. The first letter is a T or I, indicat￾ing that the power system is earthed (Terra) or Insulated. The second letter N indicates connection of 
all exposed parts to the power system earthing point (Neutral), or T indicating that all exposed parts are 
directly earthed independently of power system earthing. The third letter S indicates that a separate pro￾tective earth conductor is provided independently of the neutral conductor. Thus, TN-S stands for the 
arrangement shown in Figure 20.11a, which is a common arrangement in land-based systems. Another 
scheme is the TT shown in Figure 20.11b, where exposed conductive parts are independently earthed to 
the power system. Historically, many ships have the isolated IT system shown in Figure 20.11c.

The reason for the IT choice is that in the event of a single fault, continuity of service is main￾tained. Old insulation systems were hygroscopic (absorbed moisture) and thus insulation faults were 
common. In shipping, it is essential to maintain power to avoid collisions and loss of control. Also, 
accidental contact with a live conductor presents greater dangers to personnel. Broadly speaking, 
earthed systems have a higher risk of an arc flash and availability of power on a single fault is not 
possible. They are, however, more friendly and safe for “domestic” tasks on ships. Non-earthed 
systems can operate after a single fault, but less friendly to the “domestic” user. There are many

variations of the schemes shown in Figure 20.11, depending on the age, size, and intended use as 
discussed in References 53 and 54. Protection arrangements such as the residual current device 
(RCD) shown in Figure 20.11a are also introduced, and for simplicity are omitted in the other 
arrangements shown. An analysis of the protection of power systems, and the calculation of fault 
currents, can be found in Reference 55. Even in IT systems, there is a path to earth through stray 
capacitances which permit the flow of current. It is also possible to introduce earthing through a 
defined impedance as discussed in Reference 56. The presence of common-mode filters to reduce 
EMI also contributes to the flow of common-mode currents (also known as zero-sequence currents 
in the power field).54
Maritime traffic uses a multitude of frequencies for a range of functions. Some of these frequen￾cies must be protected from interference for the safety of navigation. Examples are NAVTEX pro￾viding meteorological warnings and forecast information (518kHz international, 490 kHz national), 
VHF radiotelephony (156–165MHz), GPS navigation (around 1575.42MHz), and many others.57
The Radio Equipment Directive establishes a regulatory framework for placing radio equipment on 
the market.58 Typical studies of propagation and interference in the ship environment may be found 
in References 59 and 60.
For small craft used for recreation, there are various regulations depending on the particular 
jurisdiction. Indicative of the nature of the regulations is EU Standard EN 55012.61 Other regula￾tions applying to equipment on ships are FCC Part 80, EN 60092, IEC 60533, and IEEE45.1.62–65
For large commercial ships, the IMO through SOLAS and IACS provides a range of guidance. 
Guidance may also be sought from classification societies and test laboratories specializing in the 
maritime field. As indicative examples, we refer to References 66–70.
Naval ships present particular problems. In addition to the usual EM threats, which we find in 
commercial EMC, we must also take into account the multitude of transmitters on board naval ships 
for communications and radar, resulting in a high risk of co-site interference. Transients in the power 
system, lightning, and intentional EM threats such as HIRF and NEMP complete a challenging EM 
environment. EMC is a factor that contributes significantly to costs, which at any rate are very high 
for naval ships. The prevalent standards for naval ships are military standards.71 These standards 
require very high quality, electromagnetically hardened equipment, which are very expensive to 
produce as production runs are small. For this reason, there is a constant push to use cheaper com￾mercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment. However, these are not compliant with the demands of 
military standards, and hardening them is expensive. Several studies have been done to find ways 
to move away from the conventional EMC compliance approach which is rule-based, where each 
sub-assembly must adhere to strict EMC standards. The alternative is a risk-based approach, where 
the emphasis is on overall performance requirements and not on equipment-level compliance. The 
overarching philosophy of a risk-based approach is to establish a hierarchy of environments (zones), 
where equipment performing allied functions can work together, and any EM disturbances are 
contained within each zone. A layered structure can thus be built up, where engineers can treat 
each zone as a black box as far as EM effects are concerned. This is a form of abstraction reducing 
complexity and allowing more freedom to use COTS within zones. More details of this approach 
may be found in References 72 and 73.

21 EMC Outlook
In this book, we have covered a range of fundamental issues that arise when considering the com￾patibility of devices and systems with each other when sharing the electromagnetic spectrum. The 
topic of EMC has developed into a major consideration in the design, manufacture, and operation of 
virtually all engineering systems. EMC is now a central consideration from the initial conceptual 
design, and throughout the lifetime of a product. It is also a significant cost driver and, as such, has 
received and will continue to receive significant attention.
In addition to cost, there are many other considerations that have contributed to interest in EMC 
in recent years. These have been mentioned throughout this text, but they are highlighted here to 
help us understand future developments.
Miniaturization of sub-assemblies has been proceeding on such a scale that cross-coupling can￾not be avoided, and EMC engineers must seek ways to keep it under control. It is difficult to foresee 
how far this process will go, but it is inevitable that the density of circuits will increase. There will 
be physical limitations in the number of interconnects that can be packed into a small space, and 
the severity of consequent electromagnetic interference problems. Interconnects may also be imple￾mented through wireless channels, but this choice too brings its own interference problems. There is 
already an intensive use of the EM spectrum by a multitude of competing services, and limitations 
to spectrum usage are inevitable. Moving services up to higher frequencies offers more bandwidth, 
but does not make EMC problems any easier to address. In recent years, engineers have sought suc￾cessfully to engineer materials that are not readily available in nature, e.g., with negative refractive 
index. These so-called metamaterials can be tailored to change properties at will, depending on 
frequency, signal magnitude, pulse shape, etc. More extensive use of metamaterials is likely in the 
future as engineers customize material properties to application needs.
The drive for efficiency and reduction in fossil fuels use means that, increasingly, electrical power 
is used to drive all kinds of vehicles. This trend will continue and intensify as carbon zero emis￾sion targets are set. While traditionally power sources were supplying dc or ac currents, efficiency 
targets, multiple voltage supplies, and reduction in weight (fewer transformers) mean that new ways 
are sought to distribute and transform power. Power electronics works by chopping up smooth 
waveforms (dc or ac) to produce pulse trains that can then be recombined to supply any shape and 
magnitude waveform. We thus have, at high power levels, sharp-edged pulses which radiate energy 
at high frequencies which is detrimental to EMC. It is inevitable that in the future testing will be 
increasingly in the time domain. Our environment is now subject to many EM signals, which may 
cause interference problems at some frequencies, but also raise the EM noise floor. Developments 
such as the Internet of Things will accentuate these problems, and consideration must be given in 
the future as to how best protect the EM spectrum for the benefit of all.
We see here that many of the upcoming developments will affect the work of the EMC engineer, 
but are also of interest to others such power, telecommunications, and signal processing engineers. 
Signal security is becoming increasingly important not only as a consequence of potential inter- or 
intra-system interference, but also as a result of malevolent external EM threats. It is already the 
case that EMC engineers must understand, work with, and negotiate with many other practitioners 
who have overlapping and competing interests. This is a trend likely to intensify in the future. A 
result of these overlaps is that we now have a range of overlapping standards and regulations, cover￾ing related areas, making it difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to demonstrate compliance. 
Current rule-based standards have been developed over many years, and a degree of rationalization 
in the future is inevitable.

It is a truism to state that nominally identical engineering systems are exactly the same. There is 
considerable uncertainty in dimensions, material properties, EM threats, etc. These factors must be 
accounted for both in measurements and in simulations. This is a process which is ongoing where 
we view systems not as deterministic, but as stochastic. Introducing the idea of randomness into 
an already complex system further complicated matters both in testing and in simulation. It is not 
simply a matter of repeating tests and simulations for a number of similar systems spanning the 
spread of the uncertain parameters (Monte Carlo approach). More sophisticated sampling methods 
are needed to obtain statistically meaningful outputs from a small number of tests and simulations, 
using selected input parameters.
As the complexity and cost of systems increases, and the need to exploit the economics of scale 
become more pressing, new ways of designing for EMC may be required. An alternative to tradi￾tional rule-based design may be necessary in some applications, where risks are managed within 
specific zones, which are then structured together without requiring the normal full EMC compli￾ance of each sub-assembly. What then matters is that EMI is managed at the interface between 
zones. This may offer more flexibility and keep costs down in complex systems.
An increasing use of numerical simulation is inevitable, as producing designs that are right-first￾time is needed and costs must be controlled. As many engineering functions are safety-critical, 
extensive simulations and testing are imperative.
Looking into the future is not a science, but an art. However, for readers who wish to read more 
on where we are and what is likely to come, References 1–3 may offer some guidance.
The breadth and complexity of EMC applications is such that there is room for everyone. Some 
may choose to work at a very practical level such as testing to fine-tune the EMC behavior of sys￾tems, while others may work at the theoretical level developing analytical and numerical tools for 
the sophisticated simulation of systems. Having a holistic grasp of EMC is a very challenging task. 
But those who attempt it will have a brilliant and satisfying career ahead of them. The modest aim 
of this book is to give an impetus to such a varied and fascinating intellectual journey.

The sinx/x Function
The sinx/x function is used quite often in the calculation of the spectra of pulsed waveforms. 
This function is shown in graphical form up to an argument value of 12 radians in Figure C1.
The amplitude of this function |sinx/x| is also shown in Figure C2. More specifically, the quantity 
20log |sinx/x| is plotted vs. x with x ranging from 0.1 to over 20,000. Consecutive points on the 
x-scale differ by 5%. It is clear from this graph that the maxima are bound asymptotically by a line 
at 0 dB up to x = 1 and by a line with a slope equal to −20dB per decade of x for x > 1.

Spectra of Trapezoidal Waveforms
In practical systems, the pulse rise-time and decay-time is always finite and it is useful, therefore, 
to study the spectral content of a periodic signal consisting of a succession of trapezoidal pulses, as 
shown in Figure D1.
The Fourier series coefficients may be obtained by using Equation 4.7 and are

where n = 1, 2, … and C0 = V0 (τ−τr
)/T. It consists of frequency components multiples of 1/T 
with amplitude determined by |sinx/x| terms. Its envelope may easily be sketched by recogniz￾ing that |sinx/x| tends to one for x small and to 1/|x| for x large, with the breakpoint of the two 
asymptotes at x = 1. The expression in Equation D.2 consists of three terms. The first has magni￾tude 2V0(τ−τr
)/T and remains constant at all frequencies (zero slope). The second term has zero 
magnitude up to a frequency 1/[π(τ−τr
)], corresponding to the argument of sin(.) equal to one and 
then diminishes with a slope equal to −20 dB per decade of frequency. The third term is similar 
but with a breakpoint at 1/(πτr
). These terms are shown in Figure D2. The envelope of all terms 
in Equation D.2 expressed in decibels is the sum of the three contributions just described and is 
shown in heavy outline in Figure D2.
It is clear that at high frequencies the spectrum is particularly sensitive to the pulse rise- and 
fall-times. If the rise-time is long, the spectral content starts to decay rapidly (−40dB per decade 
of frequency) at relatively low frequencies and high-frequency components, which are particularly 
troublesome, become negligible in magnitude.
When the duty cycle is such that τ−τr = T/2, it is dear from Equation D.2 that all even harmon￾ics are zero. However, even a modest deviation from this value of the duty cycle is likely to have 
significant effects on the magnitude of the even harmonics.442 Spectra of Trapezoidal Waveforms

where f is the frequency. Expressing in dBμV/m and f in MHz in Equation E.3 gives:

The bandwidth of the resonance is defined as the spread of frequencies where the current level 
exceeds 0.707 of its peak value as shown in Figure F1b (3 dB point). This means that the reactance 
value at the two frequencies shown in the figure must be positive and equal to R. At the lower fre￾quency, the capacitive term dominates; hence, we have,

Computation of the Discrete Time￾Domain Responses of Lumped Circuits
The responses of lumped circuits may be calculated directly in the discrete time domain using 
various techniques. We present here a method based on TLM transforms, which retains throughout 
the network methodology.1,2 The basic circuit is shown in Figure G1a, which is essentially one branch 
of the cavity resonance circuit equivalent shown in Figure 16.19. After explaining the approach on 
this simple circuit, we will generalize to the more complex case.
Numerical computation based on models of physical systems requires discretization in the space 
and time domains. The former is required since otherwise we will need infinite computer storage, 
and the latter to avoid an infinitely long computation time. In the electrical field, space discretization 
is achieved through lumped circuit components as shown in Figure G1a. Time discretization may be 
achieved by replacing the lumped components by short, one-port transmission line segments (stubs), 
with a round-trip propagation time Δt. In this approach, the circuit quantities at the port are updated 
at time intervals Δt, which is the time step of the time discrete process. This is shown in Figure G1b, 
where L and C have been replaced by transmission line stubs. A short transmission line represents 
both distributed capacitance and inductance. In representing a capacitor in this way, we choose the 
far end of the stub to be open circuit, thus minimizing the current and the impact of inductance. 
In contrast, an inductive stub has its far end a short circuit to minimize voltage and thus the impact 
of capacitance. After the time step Δt is chosen to meet problem requirements, the characteristic 
impedance of the two stubs is calculated as shown below.

Le and Ce are modeling errors and may be reduced by reducing the time step of the computation. At 
the port of each stub, we have incident and reflected voltage pulses. The notation used is shown in 
Figure G1b, where as an example VLI(n, k) stands for voltage (V) incident (I) on port of inductive 
stub (L) at time step k. The index n is used to allow for generalization to many branches as shown in 
Figure 16.19. Solid arrows indicate positive reference direction, and arrows with dashed lines show 
direction of pulse propagation. The next step in the computation is to replace each stub, looking 
into its port, by its Thevenin equivalent. This consists of a voltage source equal to the open-circuit 
voltage and an impedance equal to the characteristic impedance of the stub. Since an incident volt￾age pulse doubles on encountering an open circuit, it follows that the voltage source is in each case 
twice the incident voltage. The complete Thevenin equivalent is shown in Figure G1c. It is now a 
straightforward matter to calculate the current flowing through the circuit at time step k.

This completes the computation at time step k. To proceed to the next time step k+1, we need to 
obtain the new incident voltages VLI(n, k+1) and VCI(n, k+1). This proceeds in two stages. First, 
we calculate the reflected voltage pulse at k,

(G.4)
The negative sign for the inductor represents the fact that an incident voltage pulse on encountering 
a short circuit reflects with the opposite sign. In contrast, for a capacitive stub reflection from an 
open circuit results in a pulse with the same sign. The computation proceeds as follows:
1. From the initial conditions, obtain the incident voltages.
2. Calculate the current at k using Equation G.1 and the total voltages (Equation G.2).
3. Calculate the reflected voltages (Equation G.3).
4. Calculate the new incident voltages at k+1 (Equation G.4).
5. Repeat from Step 2, time step k+1, for as long as required.Discrete Time-Domain Responses of Lumped Circuits 449
In this way, we obtain the time evolution of the current (response) for any desired voltage source (input).
We can also compute the response of the more complex circuit shown in Figure 16.19. We replace 
each branch by a Thevenin equivalent using the same time step throughout. At each time step k and 
for each branch n, we implement the procedure shown above. The total current at time k is

The Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
Most processes in nature exhibit statistical properties in the sense that their various parameters 
do not a have precise value. Instead, there is usually an expected central value, which occurs with the 
highest likelihood, with a spread of values around it which occur less often. We can calculate the 
probability that a random variable has a value in the interval x…x+dx if we know the shape of 
the probability density function (PDF) f(x) associated with this particular random variable. Then, 
this probability is equal to f(x)dx. There are many PDFs describing the large number of random 
processes found in nature. The most common is the normal distribution associated with Gauss. It 
is encountered in so many diverse fields that an understanding of it is useful to every scientist and 
engineer. There are several ways in deriving this PDF. We will briefly illustrate a couple of ways as 
they help in understanding randomness. It is worth reflecting on the designation “normal” for this 
distribution. What is it about this distribution that makes it so common a PDF in random processes?
From our daily experience, we expect that when we are trying to hit a target, say with darts, we 
will not always succeed. Most shots will land near the target, but some will land further away. The 
further away from the target, the less likely that a shot will land there. The chances of landing at 
a location where few throws have landed before also diminish. Let us now generalize and assume 
that most occurrences of a random event cluster around a valueμand that we seek the value of the 
PDF at a value x. Based on the reasoning above, we may expect that the rate of change of the value 
of the PDF is proportional to the distance from the target (x–μ) and the value of the PDF f(x) at x.

where C is another constant to be determined. We can eliminate one of the yet unknown constants 
C and k if we apply the normalization condition. This simply states that the probability of x being 
anywhere between minus and plus infinity must be one; i.e., the area under the PDF curve must be 
equal to one.

It can be confirmed that the expected value of x is μ. It now remains to find out what k represents. 
From Equation H.4, we can see that the peak occurs at x = μ, the first moment of the PDF. As k 
increases, the peak value also increases, but since the area under the curve remains constant at one, 
this means that the spread around the mean value decreases. The spread or width of the curve is 
described by a quantity known as the variance σ2 (second moment of the PDF) or, alternatively, by 
the standard deviation σ. Variance is defined as follows,

Another way to derive the same expression for the PDF of the normal (Gaussian) distribution is to 
visualize the throwing of darts on a two-dimensional board. We make two assumptions: The prob￾ability of a dart landing anywhere on the board depends only on the radial distance from the center 
and not on the polar angle, and the x-coordinate of the landing position tells us nothing about the 
y-coordinate and vice versa (the x- and y-positions are uncorrelated). These two assumptions imply 
that the distribution must be in the form,
F r F x E f x f y 2 2 ( ) = + ( ) = ( ) ( ) (H.7)
where f(x) is the PDF of the x-coordinate. Applying Equation H.7 for y = 0 gives, F(x) = f(0)
f(x) = Cf(x), where C is a constant. We see that function F is a scaled version of f, and therefore 
from Equation H.7, we get,
Cf r f x f y
f x

Intuitively, we can sense that the function we seek is some form of exponential. The function oper￾ates by squaring its argument and then exponentiates.
f x Cexp k x2 2 ( ) = −( ) (H.9)
where k is another constant to be determined. Direct substitution of this functional form into 
Equation H.8 confirms that this is the correct function. Constants C and k are obtained as we have 
shown above.
The normal distribution is shown in Figure H1 for a mean value of five and two values of 
standard deviation equal to one and two. The inflection points of the curve (f′′( ) x = 0) corre￾sponds to x = ±σ.
For the normal distribution, 68% of all events occur within ±σ, 95% between ± σ2 , and 99.7% 
between ± σ3 of the mean value.
The normal distribution is ubiquitous in nature, e.g., the Maxwell distribution of molecular 
velocity in gases. Its importance is further enhanced by the central limit theorem, which states that 
a random variable X, which is the sum of n independent random variables, approaches a normal 
distribution as n increases. This has obvious implications in error analysis of complex processes, 
which are the result of several random errors. Naturally, not all random processes follow a normal 
distribution. Further details may be found in Reference 1.The Normal (Gaussian) Distribution 453
