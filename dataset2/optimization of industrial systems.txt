Speed Control of DC Motor at Variable 
Load Torque Using FLC
Kbrom Lbsu*, Selomone Fantaye and Fisseha Teklay 
Mekell University, Ethiopia
Abstract 
A DC motor is an electro-mechanical device which is used to drive different loads in many applica￾tion areas such as industrial and home appliances. During operation, one of the basic parameters to 
be controlled is the speed of the motor, which is affected by the internal parameter of the motor and 
external load that is connected to it. Separately excited DC motors have been widely used in high 
performance applications and when a motor is desired to operate at constant speed, its speed varies 
due to variation of load torque. The objective of this thesis work is to control the speed of separately 
excited DC motors using a fuzzy logic controller considering different load torques. In order to 
control the speed of the DC motor we used a fuzzy logic controller in a MATLAB environment by 
varying load torque. First, an open loop system was designed and measured the speed, transient, 
and steady state error. Secondly, a PID controller was designed to control the speed of the motor by 
tuning (KP, KI, and KD) gains of the PID controller and measuring the speed, transient, and steady 
state error. On the other hand, a fuzzy logic controller was designed to control the speed of the motor 
by intelligent tuning, taking appropriate expert rules and comparing the result between a PID and 
fuzzy logic controller in the simulation result. 
Finally, a fuzzy logic controller is a better controller than a PID controller by zero overshoot, 
reduction of 28.1% of settling, 27.87% of rise time, and 93.33% of steady state error. In addition to 
this, by solving nonlinear characteristics of the motor, it increases overall performance of the system.
Keywords: DC motor, PID controller, fuzzy controller 
1.1 Introduction
The DC motor is an attractive piece of equipment in many industrial applications requir￾ing variable speed and load characteristics for its ease of controllability. The speed control 
of a DC motor is very crucial in application where precision and protection are of the 
essence. The purpose of a motor speed controller is to take error correcting signals rep￾resenting the required speed and to drive a motor at a fixed speed. DC motors have good 
speed control despondence and are widely used in speed control systems which need 
high control requirements, such as rolling mills, double-hulled tankers, high precision

digital tools, etc. The speed of a DC motor can be varied by controlling the field flux, 
armature resistance, or terminal voltage that is applied to the armature circuit. Separately 
excited DC motors are mainly used as actuators in industrial applications. These motors 
have the advantage of having low friction, small size, high speed, low construction cost, 
and high torque. 
1.2 Background of Thesis Work
DC motors used in many applications, such as still rolling mills, electric trains, electric 
vehicles, electric cranes, and robotic manipulators, require speed controllers to per￾form their tasks. The speed controller of DC motors was first carried out by means of 
voltage control in 1981 by Ward Leonard [2]. DC motors use feedback controllers to 
control the speed, position, or both. Today, the most famous and frequently used type 
of controller in the industry is a PID controller, but PID controllers do not offer satis￾factory results when an adaptive algorithm is required [6]. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is 
one of the most successful applications of fuzzy set theory, introduced by L.A Zadeh in 
1973 and applied (Mamdani 1974) in an attempt to control systems that are structurally 
difficult to model. Since then, FLC has been an extremely active and fruitful research 
area with many industrial applications reported [3]. In the last three decades, FLC has 
evolved as an alternative complementary to the conventional control strategies in var￾ious engineering areas. Fuzzy control theory usually provides non-linear controllers 
that are capable of performing different complex non-linear control actions, even for 
uncertain nonlinear systems.
1.3 Statement of the Problem (Case Study)
Since DC motors have wide applications, the speed can be varied due to different con￾dition. When a motor is desired to operate in a constant speed, its speed may be var￾ied due to different loads; the speed of motor is decreased when the load is increased 
and the speed of the motor is increased when the load is decreased, so consequently the 
motor does not accurately work at the desired time. Machines are easily damaged with￾out implementation of control methodology in the system and the conventional (PI, PD, 
PID) technique is widely used in DC motor speed and position control. It is not suitable 
for high performance cases because of the low robustness of PID controllers. Not only 
that, but the major problems in applying a conventional control system in a speed con￾troller are the effects of nonlinear characteristics of a DC motor, such as saturations and 
fictions, that could degrade the performance of conventional controllers. This thesis work 
proposes a new ability of fuzzy logic control, whose approach offers a simpler, quicker, 
and more reliable solution that has clear advantages over conventional techniques and 
a control system that could give a faster response in order to maintain the speed of the 
DC motor at the desired value with minimum overshoot, minimum steady state error, 
minimum settling time, and fast rising time, all of which are very important and crucial 
in industrial application.Speed Control of DC Motor at Variable Load Torque Using FLC 3
1.4 Research Methods
1.4.1 Fuzzy Logic Controller Theory
The fuzzy logic idea is similar to the human being’s feeling and inference process, 
unlike the classical control strategy as shown in Figure 1.1.
The principal elements of a fuzzy logic controller are:
A. Fuzzification
B. Rule Base and Inference Engine
C. Defuzzification
A. Fuzzification
This process converts the crisp input into the fuzzy linguistic values. Generally, fuzzy logic 
uses linguistic variables instead of any precise or numerical variables. 
B. Rule Base and Inference Engine
A collection of rules is called a rule base. The rules are in an if/then format; formally, the 
“if ” side is called the condition and the “then” side is called the conclusion. 
vFuzzy Inference Model
(A). Mamdani Model: Mamdani-type inference, as defined for the toolbox, 
expects the output membership functions to be fuzzy sets. After the aggre￾gation process, there is a fuzzy set for each output variable that needs 
defuzzification [4].
(B). Segeno Model: The Segeno, or Takagi-Kang, Method of fuzzy inference is 
mostly similar to the Mamdani model, but the difference is Segeno output 
membership functions are either linear or constant and the rule base of the 
Segeno is: If x is A and y is B, then z is F(x, y). This model is mainly used if 
there is no expert knowledge about the system [5].

C. Defuzzification
The reverse of fuzzification is called defuzzification. It is the transformation of a fuzzy quan￾tity into a precise quantity, just like fuzzification is the conversion of a precise quantity to a 
fuzzy quantity. The use of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) produces the required output in a 
linguistic variable (fuzzy number). As per real world requirements, the linguistic variables 
should be transformed to a crisp output. We have been used the center of the area for the 
defuzzification process in this paper [1].
There are five basic defuzzification strategies and they are defined as follows:
1. Centroid of Area (COA): It is one of the most popular techniques used for 
defuzzification, as it is reminiscent of the calculation of expected values of 
probability distributions. It can be defined as follows:

where μA (Z) is the aggregated output MF.
2. Bisector of Area (BOA): 
It satisfies the equation:

( ) Z Z dz A( )dz, zBoA
(1.2)
where α = min {z/z ∈ z} and β = max {z/z ∈ z}, that is the vertical line, and 
z = zBoA partitions the region between z = α, z = β, y = 0, and y = μA into two 
regions with the same area.
3. Mean of Maximum (MOM):
zmom is the average of the maximizing z at which the MF reaches a maximum 
µ*. It can be represented as follows:
∫

(1.3)
where z’ = {z | µA (z) = µ*}.
4. Smallest of Minimum (SOM):
zSOM is the minimum of the maximizing z (in terms of magnitude).
5. Largest of Maximum (LOM):
zLOM is the maximum of the maximizing z (in terms of magnitude).Speed Control of DC Motor at Variable Load Torque Using FLC 5

1.6.1 Simulation of Speed Control of DC Motor using PID Controller
To obtain the optimum gain value for Kp, Ki, and Kd, several gain values have been tested. 
The best combinations of gain value are when the system can run with minimum overshoot, 
minimum steady state error, and minimum steady state time. The overall simulation circuit 
is for a PID controller. By using a PID controller, we have measured the speed, steady state 
error (ess), rise time (tr
), settling time (ts
), and overshoot of the motor at three different 
loads with applied 200 DC voltages. A block diagram of DC motor with PID controller has 
been presented in Figure 1.4.

1.6.4 Simulation of Speed Control using Fuzzy Controller at Different Loads
Figure 1.7 shows the Simulink model of a DC Motor using a fuzzy logic controller by apply￾ing a 200 volt input, the speed of the motor is at no load, and (TL=0) is 1500. When the load 
is increased to 150 Nm, the speed of the motor is constant, rise time increases from 0.0989 to 
0.1242 seconds, and settling time from 0.4 to 0.5 seconds. When the torque load is increases 
to 300 Nm, the speed of the motor is also constant, the speed reaches 1500 rpm, settling time 
increases by 0.1 seconds, rise time increases by 0.21 seconds, and the steady state error is 1.

torque of (TL=300Nm). Beside this the output performance of motor at load torque for differ￾ent controllers has been showcased in Table 1.2. When we compare the speed of the motor, we 
found different speeds with different system performance. Starting with open loop, the speed 
of the motor decrease as the load torque increases, the speed of the motor at no load (TL=0) is 
1509 revolutions per minute (rpm), and as the load torque increases to TL=300 Nm the speed 
of the motor reduces by 75% and the speed decreases from 1509 to 377 rpm. The settling time 
increases by 9.42% from 0.4227 seconds to 0.4667 seconds, but the rise time decreases by 
52.31% from 0.0713 seconds to 0.034 seconds, and the steady state error increases by 99.19% 
(from 9 to 1122.9). When applying a PID controller, the speed of the motor at no load (TL=0 
Nm) is 1515 rpm as the load torque increases to TL=300Nm, the speed of the motor is con￾stant and reaches 1515 rpm, rise time increases by 40.79% from 0.27 seconds to 0.456 seconds, 
the settling time increases by 42.17% from 0.48 seconds to 0.83 seconds, and the steady state 
error is constant (15) as load torque increases. When applying the fuzzy logic controller, the 
speed of the motor at no load (TL=0 Nm) is 1501 rpm and as the load torque increases to 
TL=300 Nm, the speed of the motor reaches 1501 Nm. The rise time increases by 69.93% from 
0.0989 seconds to 0.3289 seconds, the settling time increases by 33.33% (from 0.4 seconds to 
0.6 seconds), and the steady state error becomes constant (i.e., 1) as the load torque becomes 
300 Nm. Finally, to control the speed of DC motor under varying load torques, the fuzzy logic 
controller is a better controller than the PID controller and open loop due to low steady state 
error, low transient error, and fast response.
1.7 Conclusion
The speed of a separately excited DC motor was tested using open loop, a PID controller, 
and a fuzzy logic controller. The speed of the motor for open loop reduces as load torque

increases and also increases the transient error and steady state error. Consequently, the 
performance of the motor is low and the speed of the motor will not continue at the rated 
speed. Using a PID controller, the speed of the motor is better than open loop, but there is 
still some transient error and steady state error and system performance is not satisfactory. 
But, by applying a fuzzy logic controller, the speed of the motor does not decrease as load 
increases and the motor runs at the rated speed with low steady state error, low transient 
error, thus showing higher performance than PID controllers and open loop control sys￾tems. The DC motor model was designed with a fuzzy logic controller to control the speed 
of the motor under the effect of load. In this simulation, the speed of the motor is kept con￾stant and the load torque varies. The proposed system was fruitfully designed and tested. As 
per results of the simulation, it is obvious from the above results that a fuzzy logic controller 
is a very effective and powerful controller. Finally, it is concluded that a fuzzy logic con￾troller is a better controller than a PID controller by zero overshoot, reducing by 28.1% for 
settling, 27.87% for rise time, and 93.33% for steady state error. By solving nonlinear char￾acteristics of the motor, there is an increase in overall performance of the system and we 
achieve the desired value of stable system parameters specified for performance conclude 
that a closed loop is more stable than an open loop system.

Abstract
Food is necessary for the survival of life on earth. Hence, food supply chains (FSC) are making 
gains because of their mandate for survival, as well as changing lifestyles of consumers in this era 
of globalisation. To meet consumer demand and keep in view the perishable nature of food items 
to be consumed, inventory levels in the FSC become a priority, but inventory levels are governed by 
various factors, which makes its prediction uncertain and blurs its effective management. Hence, 
identification of the various factors which govern inventory levels is the need of the hour. Effective 
inventory management leads to customer satisfaction with reduced operation costs and better finan￾cial yielding. This work aims to identify the various factors which govern inventory in the working 
dynamics of the food industry and its associated supply chain. Based on the factors used to explore 
the relationship among the identified factors, a hierarchical relation model is framed in this study. 
To further analyse the model and outrank the factors, by considering the various criteria’s governing 
inventory levels, a hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique involving a combi￾nation of an analytical hierarchical process and TODIM is implemented. The results of this study 
collaborate factors affecting inventory with the real life needs of a food product based industry. The 
presented work will guide managers to look at these factors to make effective inventory management 
exercises more practical in the direction of bettering operation profits.

2.1 Introduction 
Nowadays, supply chain networks are growing and establishing globally, hence, there is 
a widespread flow of a variety of products, services, and information through its various 
operating channels (Chinello et al., 2019). Broad channels of operations of supply chain 
networks have prompted companies to uplift their production processes to meet surged

demand along with product vividness to get global recognition, but at the same it has devel￾oped the need for effective management and coordination to effectively manage the net￾works (Longo, 2011). Food supply chains (FSC) encompass various operations related to 
the delivery of a food item to customers (Sharma et al., 2020). FSCs must involve effective 
operations strategies involving product availability, prompt product delivery, and consis￾tency in product quality because food items are prone to perishability. Perishability refers to 
tendency of slow degradation of the food item because of changes at chemical and biological 
levels which restricts its life. Hence, there is a demand for effective inventory management 
to channelize the demand and supply of product volumes (Mahapatra and Mahanty, 2019).
It is estimated that inventory accounts for 20-60 percent of the company’s total assets 
(Jie & Cong, 2009).The costs associated with inventory hold this cost share as a high con￾tribution in the case of FSC because food items often require a sophisticated environment 
with temperature and humidity control, which further increases the costs related to it (Violi 
et al., 2019). In order to prevent product shortage in the market and related production 
delays, companies often withhold inventory stocks related to raw material and use vari￾ous ingredients in the main process and finished goods (Demeter and Golini, 2014). It is 
estimated that nearly 30 percent of food being produced for consumption gets wasted and 
becomes unfit for consumption because of the lack of inventory management (Porter and 
Reay, 2015) and approximately two-thirds of the food items produced do not flow through 
the channels of the FSC (Grolleaud, 2002).
Food industries and their SCs must curb the wastage of products due to inventory mis￾management, as such inefficiencies cause various social and economic threats in feeding the 
nation. Food industries mark the line of difference from other process industries because the 
raw material they use is procured from primary activities , while food industries deal with 
product perishability, shelf life issues, assurance of product, and process quality because 
their end product is meant for consumption by living beings. Inventory management tactics 
and their governing factors are unique for every industry based on their operational fea￾tures and are defined as key to a company’s success because they are closely associated with 
the financial gains of a firm (Capkun et al., 2009).
Inventory management indicates the effective balancing of product demand in the sup￾ply chain by withholding the minimum stock of inventory levels (Hoppenheit & Günthner, 
2015). This approach involves multiple factors which govern the inventory levels by consid￾ering the product service and trading levels. Hence, there is a need to identify the factors 
which govern the inventory levels within the range of an organisation’s functionality, as 
these factors directly impact the performance of the supply chain and its associated prof￾itability. This work is done with the vision to identify the factors which govern inventory 
levels in the food industry to create performance-oriented FSCs. For pursing this work, 
industries belonging to the region of Ludhiana in the state of Punjab situated in Northern 
India were considered to gather the avenues for the practicality and feasibility of this study.
This work is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the review of research literature 
having relevance to this field. Section 3 highlights the methodology of AHP and TODIM 
and details about the steps involved in this study. Section 4 portrays the results and dis￾cussions associated based on the key findings of this study. Section 5 explains the various 
implications related to this work and associated future avenues to further enrich this 
work.Dynamics of Food Supply Chain Performance System 13
2.2 Literature Review 
Most food products are susceptible to perishability and this unique attribute of food items 
makes a line of distinction between other products’ supply chains (Goyal and Giri, 2001). 
Hence, decisions related to product inventory are taken very seriously to balance product 
availability and the deterioration rate of an item (Shin et al., 2019). Food items cannot be 
stored for longer period durations, as the passage of time causes changes in chemical and 
biological properties, which causes decay, distorts nutrient value, and leads to wastage of 
food items (Tadei et al., 1995). Hence, inventory management becomes very crucial here.
Demeter and Golini (2014) studied assembly industries and based on the survey, by 
using statistical tools, various configurations and drivers which affect the inventory levels 
in the supply chain were identified. Diabat et al. (2019) considered scenarios related to 
perishable inventory by considering product demand as stochastic in nature and devel￾oped a simulation approach based model involving the deterioration rate of a product and 
reviewed its replenishment policy. Liu et al. (2018) analysed the agro-product based supply 
chain involving the perishable nature of products involved on the situation of demand and 
price uncertainty and the perishability of the food item while procuring the inventory by 
developing a dynamic based programming model. Ambekar and Kapoor (2019) considered 
the Indian public food distribution system and analysed various inventory polices by using 
techniques of simulation and genetic algorithm and costs associated with inventory related 
operation were minimised in results to have better performance.
Moser et al. (2017) analysed process industries and identified the various characteristics 
associated with inventory which reduce various costings and capture demand uncertainty 
and pricing fluctuations by using relation regression based equation models to strengthen 
inventory management. Mogale et al., considered the Indian system involving distribution 
of food items and assessed the various costings factors to have effective transportation of 
goods, keeping in view the perishability of food products, demand, and seasonal availabil￾ity by developing a mixed integer based nonlinear program. Maiyar and Thakkar (2017) 
framed a cost reduction model of the shipping of Indian grains considering the flexibil￾ity of transportation modes, i.e., either by road or by rail. Chinello et al. (2020) assessed 
the impact of various inventory drivers on the multi-echelon supply chain of a processing 
industry by developing simulation models.
Onggo et al. (2019) studied agro-product based supply chains by involving the concept 
of volatile demand and considered a single supplier based system to determine the best 
routing and inventory configuration which minimises transportation and holding cost for 
a perishable product chain by using Monte Carlo based simulation in the work. Huang et 
al. (2018) developed a model for a three-levelled FSC which involves product deterioration 
and various disruptions in its production network and developed a mathematical algorithm 
which aids decisions related to product pricing and inventory. 
Mosca et al. (2019) reviewed the various key findings related to various invento￾ry-transportation issues in inventory management. Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) studied 
the various inaccuracies related to inventory and its effect on the performance of a supply 
chain by considering a three tiered supply chain configuration and used a simulation 
technique to evaluate the losses in a supply chain due to inventory issues in a business 
environment. Bottani et al. (2014) considered a two tier FSC configuration in which a 14 Optimization of Industrial Systems
simulation based tool was used to evaluate the various costs related to perishable prod￾uct inventory management policies and its effect on performance indicators like product 
shelf life, throughput time, etc. 
Hence, based upon the above insights of the research literature it is found that many of 
the articles related to inventory in the food supply chain focus on the costs, optimum config￾uration, and route selection and most of them involve simulation based case studies. Still, a 
large count of Indian food industries operate with the traditional approaches and ignore the 
various management aspects associated with it, which affects their performance and gen￾erates a high rate of product wastage and losses in various tiers of its supply chain (Sharma 
et al., 2020). Hence, there is a need for effective inventory management, as food items are 
prone to perishability. For this reason, various factors which govern inventory related issues 
in the working dynamics of food industries and their FSC needs to be accounted for. There 
is a need for models which configure the supply chain tactics along with company goals 
to effectively manage the inventory (Mosca et al., 2019). Furthermore, to involve the spirit 
of practicality and make effective decisions by involving multiple criterias, analysis of the 
factors effecting inventory management needs to be done by multi-criteria decision making 
techniques (MCDM). These techniques answer the issues which indulge the selection of the 
alternatives based upon the enlisted criteria by involving human perception related to the 
decision. 
Hence, this work is dedicated to identifying the various factors which govern effective 
inventory levels in the working dynamics of an Indian food industry. These factors will be 
analysed on the basis of criteria and the same mapping is done by developing a hierarchical 
relational model. This model will be analysed by using the hybrid combination of the AHP￾TODIM MCDM technique. 
Hence, based upon the above objectives, Table 2.1 showcases the identified criterions 
from the research literature, on the basis of which decisions related to inventory levels are 
laid out.
Table 2.2 depicts the various factors (alternatives) which govern the inventory levels in 
the working environment of a food industry and chain dynamics.
Hence, based on the above identified criterions and their associated alternatives (Table 
2.1 and 2.2), for regulating the inventory levels, a hierarchical relation model is sketched 
below in Figure 2.1.
2.3 Methodology 
In order to analyse the model developed in Figure 2.1, a mathematical tool combining the 
AHP technique and TODIM technique is used. These techniques have the potential to 
determine the priorities and outrank them based upon the criterions chosen by involving 
the human perspective. Figure 2.2 below highlights the methodology used in this work.
2.3.1 Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)
Many times, situations persist where a particular problem has a set of criteria that is framed 
and based upon these criteria, alternatives are to be chosen. Saaty (1980) developed a method 
to answer these problems, which is named the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). AHP Dynamics of Food Supply Chain Performance System 15
decomposes the problem to the working levels conformed between the various criteria, 
subcriteria, and alternatives and involves the perception and judgements given by the deci￾sions makers for them (Tyagi et al., 2018). AHP evaluates the weight of the criteria, on the 
basis of ratings provided by experts on a particular scale depicting the pairwise comparison 
among the entities. AHP is tool of high value as it evolves from the experts and evaluates 
a situation based on the decision ratings given by them (both quantitative and qualitative) 
and a sequence of predefined procedures provides multicriteria ranking as a result. For this 
work, the aim of using AHP is to evaluate only the criteria weights, which is to be further

used in evaluations done by the TODIM method. Steps used in the evaluation of weight by 
using AHP are defined below:
Step 1: Development of Pairwise Comparison Matrix of Criteria 
In this step, the ‘h’ criteria and h x h matrix will be constructed, in which pairwise compar￾ison will be done as per the 1-9 Saaty scale (shown in Table 2.3 and Figure 2.3 below). Here, 
based on the scale, an evaluation will be done revealing the relative importance of criteria 
‘c’ over criteria ‘b’, where pcb depicts this value. When, for a particular value of a matrix, a 
becomes equal to b, then a value of 1 will be imparted and pbc = 1/pcb.
If Pab>1, then ‘a’ criteria have more importance than ‘b’ criteria and its increasing value 
depicts increasing importance. Similarly, if Pba<1, then ‘a’ criteria is less important than ‘b’ 
and this is also depicted above in the scale diagram.

Step 4: Consistency Check 
AHP involves a concept of consistency check in which the judgement given by the experts 
for the pairwise comparisons are checked. This is done by evaluating the value of the ‘con￾sistency index (CI)’. If the calculated value of this index is less than 0.1, then the judgement 
claimed for decision making is consistent and reliable results can be expected. It can be 
calculated as shown in Equation 2.3 below.

2.3.2 TODIM Approach
This approach was proposed by Gomes and Lima in 1992 (Adali and Isik, 2016). It is a 
multi-criteria decision making approach, which was developed on the basis of the pros￾pect theory and highlights the idea of iterative operations, which aids the decision making 
in multi-criteria situations (Llamazares, 2018). Generally, TODIM involves evaluations of 
the dominance degrees of every single alternative on the other alternatives and aides their 
ranking (Ramooshjan et al., 2015). 
Step 1: Development of Decision Matrix
Here, for the various alternatives ALa
 (a = 1,2,3……. g) in reference to the criteria’s of eval￾uation, CEc (c = 1,2,3………….h) based upon them a matrix is developed, which outlays 
the performance of selected alternatives in lieu to criteria based on which evaluations are 
to be done.

where pac depicts the performance value of alternative ‘a’ over criteria ‘c’.
Step 2: Normalisation of Decision Matrix
The developed decision matrix in the previous step is normalised by the formula men￾tioned in Equation 2.5 below; this formula is meant for scenarios where the objective is to 
maximise.

where Pac is the normalised value of ‘a’ alternative over criteria ‘c’. 
Step 3: Here, criteria weights are determined and for the evaluated weights, relative weight 
(Wrw) is calculated by using Equation 2.6 below.

where wc represents the criteria weight as calculated by AHP in the previous section and 
wcr depicts the relative weight of reference criteria, which is based on the highest weighted

Step 4: Calculation of Dominance Degree of Alternatives
Here, the dominance degree for alternative ALa over alternative ALj is calculated by the for￾mula shown in Equation 2.7.

where Pac – Pjc > 0 reflects the gains of alternative ALa
 over alternative ALj
. Similarly, Pac –

Step 5: Evaluation of Overall Degree of dominance of Alternative (ήa

Here, for each alternative, based on their dominance values calculated in the previous step, 
an overall value of the dominance is evaluated using equation 2.9.

2.3.3.1 AHP Illustration 
AHP has been used here to calculate the weight of criterion. The steps above in Section 3.1 
in Equations 1 through 3 are practised below consecutively in Tables 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.
The pairwise matrix development procedure, as per Step 1 in Section 3.1, is followed and 
ratings are given by experts as the rating scale mentioned in Table 2.3 and Figure 2.3.22 Optimization of Industrial Systems
For the development of a normalised pairwise matrix, Step 2 and Equation 1.1 are used 
and the figures are mentioned in Table 2.5.
The evaluation of criteria weights in Equation 2.2, as mentioned in Step 3, is utilised and 
the evaluations are shown in Table 2.6.
A consistency check is being carried out as per the details mentioned in Step 4 and 
Equation 2.3.
Consistency check = C.I./ R.I. = 0.0573/3 = 0.063, 
hence, it is less than 0.1, which shows that the. results are consistent enough and can be 
used further.

2.4 Results and Discussions
Based on the calculations done by using the hybrid combination of AHP and TODIM 
techniques, alternatives can be ranked as F2>F1>F5>F6>F4>F3. For the factors governing 
inventory levels in the food industry, the second alternative ‘Product storage (F2)’ scores 
highest, whereas ‘Product lead time (F3)’ scores the least.
For food items, availability of proper storage place is very crucial, as most of the food 
items bear the characteristics of perishability, hence, proper storage space which is able to 
handle flexibilities related to temperature, humidity, better traceability and monitoring, and 
safeguarding from rodent and other biological attacks is required. In India, approximately 
16% of the annual produce of fruits, vegetables, and food grains are wasted because of lack 
of storage spaces (Financial express, 2019). Even in the report by the National Academy 
of Agricultural Sciences, a Government of India funded agency, showed a lack of proper 
storage space was regarded as the biggest cause behind the food loss (NAAS-2019). Hence, 
there is a need for the development of storage spaces to cater to the needs of an increasing 
burden of population along with food demand, which can assure food security and its avail￾ability to all.
‘Information and Communication (I&C) practices adoption (F1)’ is ranked second 
among the factors governing inventory levels with a value of 0.7056. Implementation 
related to I & C makes product flow in FSCs more transparent, enables its monitoring, 
enhances traceability within the operating system, and strengthens the channels connecting 
customers and suppliers, which help industries capture market trends and needs gener￾ously. Development of I & C practices reduces inventory levels as this. system is accessible 
to the real time conditions of operations, even at remote locations, which makes decision 
making and planning related to inventory chores more easy and practical enough to handle 
various uncertainties.
‘Product distribution intervals (F5)’ ranked third among the alternatives with a value 
of 0.6109. The frequency of the shipping of a product showcases that food items having 
low shelf life and high consumption rate in daily life routines need to be shipped at very 
short intervals, hence, inventory associated with it should be maintained accordingly. Same 
side food items, composing of species, processed food items, pulses, grains, etc., have com￾parably longer life and their shipping frequencies and inventory stocks are made as per 
the demand. Many a times seasonal availability of a food item make its distribution time 
interval quite short to cope with the time bound needs, hence inventory related to its raw 
material, semi-finished, and finished goods also gathers pace accordingly. Ignoring the dis￾tribution rate of the products may either cause overflowing inventories or acute product 
shortages and both of these situations risk the working capital.
‘Product demand (F6)’ was ranked fourth and scored a value of 0.5417. Product demand 
governs the rate of product flow in the market and at its backend various associated pro￾cesses are carried out. Demand pattern monitors the level of inventory in the industry, as

for the case of food items, perishability reflects the challenges to large inventory volumes 
if demand fluctuations incur. Hence, mapping of the inventory policies should be done by 
considering the product demand,= to ensure profitability in operations.
‘Product attributes (F4)’ scored a value of 0.3091 and ranked fifth among these factors. 
Product attribute outlays the nature of a product which is part of the supply chain. For 
the FSC food items, which are of both types, perishable and non-perishable, temperature 
humidity sensitive and vice-versa, few are to be used as ingredients, whereas some are con￾sumed as whole, and some products are seasonal, whereas some are available throughout 
the year. These factors withhold the inventory levels and, accordingly, its related decisions 
are made. Inventory levels and policies meant for the non-perishable nature of food prod￾uct cannot be implemented to perishable nature ones, as each food item portrays a unique￾ness in terms of its ingredients, taste, and processing levels. Hence, inventory levels of the 
industry rely on product attributes. 
2.5 Work Implications and Future Avenues
The presented work is presented with the aim to assess and outlay factors which affect the 
inventory process the most. For carrying out this work, various criterions and their associ￾ated alternatives, which govern the inventory levels in the working environment of the food 
industry, were identified from the core of the research literature. Further for the analysis, 
hybrid MCDM techniques comprising of the benefits of AHP and TODIM methodologies 
were utilised and implemented by involving perceptions of industry experts.
This work can enable managers to be more focused on the factors which are actually con￾cerned with inventory levels. Managers can structure their inventory governing policies as 
per the factors identified in this study to exercise better control and minimise the costings 
associated with it. Various government organisations have compliances and close associ￾ates with the industries and can utilise the findings of this study to strengthen the struc￾ture which lags in effective inventory management. Academicians can utilise this study to 
deepen their interests and frame out the various practicalities associated with this study, 
which can be further explored to step up in this direction.
This work can be extended by looking at the more product oriented food supply chains 
and industries, which will help figure out the various key aspects associated with inventory 
management. Further, the concept of soft computing techniques can be collaborated with 
this work to answer the various uncertainties associated with this system and allow better 
handling of the same.

Abstract 
A cold supply chain (CSC) aims to deliver temperature sensitive and perishable products from pro￾duction to the end consumption stage with their natural quality, highest possible speed, and least 
possible waste. Throughout the CSC, a product has to travel a long distance to reach the end con￾sumer. In a CSC, in spite of temperature, several factors involved have to be controlled. Any variation 
from the recommended range of these factors creates risks for the CSC which often leads to high 
product waste, economy loss, and loss of human lives, like in cases of pharmaceutical or vaccine 
CSC. Therefore, in a CSC, it is necessary to identify and analyze these risks and risk contributing 
factors so that the same can be mitigated before they happen. The current paper aimed to identify 
and analyze the risks and risk contributing factors in a CSC and to mitigate the same proposes the 
best possible alternatives with their priority ranks. To achieve the objective of the research, a Delphi 
based AHP – PROMETHEE approach has been used. To carry out the research work in. a well-struc￾tured way, the whole research work is divided into three segments. In the first segment, the Delphi 
technique has been used to identify and analyze the risks and risk contributing factors in a CSC. 
To provide the priority weights for the identified risks and risk contributing factors, in the second 
segment, the AHP method has been used. In the third segment, the PROMETHEE –II approach has 
been used to provide the ranking for the alternatives.

3.1 Introduction and Background
Most of the perishables, such as fresh agricultural produce, seafoods, vaccines and pharma￾ceuticals, are temperature sensitive and require storage and transportation in a temperature 
controlled environment. A slight fluctuation in the recommended sustainable range cre￾ates product waste (Zhu, 2011). A CSC is solely responsible for delivering these perishable 
products from production to end consumer with their natural quality and potency in the

least possible time, aiming to reduce product waste up to the minimum level (Gardas et al., 
2019). Throughout the CSC, a product has to travel a long distance and time to reach the 
end consumer. During this, in spite of the temperature control, many factors (such a social, 
geographical, environmental, and economical, etc.) exist that directly or indirectly influ￾ence the performance of the CSC. These factors create risks for the cold chain (CC) that 
often lead to high product waste, economic and environmental losses, and even the loss 
of human lives such as in case of pharmaceutical and vaccine CSCs. Therefore, it becomes 
necessary to identify these risks and their risk contributing factors influencing CSC perfor￾mance so that these can be mitigated before they happen. A lot of work has been done in 
the field of CSC, but very little narrates the issues and risks of the same with their severity 
weights. From the above motivation, the objective of the presented research work is:
3.1.1 Objective of the Presented Work
• To identify and analyze the most severe risks and their contributing factors. 
and at the same time alternatives to mitigate the same
• To develop a model containing the risks, risk contributing factors, and the 
alternatives
• Provide the priority weights for the risks and risk contributing factors
• Recommend the alternatives with their preference order to mitigate the risks. 
Many researchers (Adekomaya et al., 2016; Hariga et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2014, and Saif 
& Elhedhli, 2016) presented energy consumption and leakage of refrigerants from refrig￾eration units as the key issues which increase the amount of carbon emissions from CSCs 
and create environmental risks for the same, as well as society. Fluctuations in the climatic 
factors, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure, make the working environment for 
CC hostile, contributing to reduced performance and environmental risk. In the current 
scenario of a hostile and competitive environment, it becomes difficult for any industry to 
survive without the cooperation of government and society since society is the key con￾sumer for any industrial product. Therefore, this creates a risk for CSC that forces decision 
makers to reevaluate their plan and strategies so that a sustainable environment can be 
established and the above risks can be mitigated.
The human risk in a CSC becomes a prime focus of any industry, especially a CC indus￾try. The majors factors that contribute to human risk are labour strikes and their unavail￾ability for the industry (Sainathan et al., 2018; Gardas et al., 2018). Warehousing (storage) 
and transportation are the two most significant stages of a CSC and require sharp atten￾tion to the operations involved in these stages. In the storage or warehousing stage of a 
CSC, a little carelessness or lack of attention may create the possibility of packaging failure, 
refrigeration unit failure, and product expiration and product waste that may create a huge 
loss of economy and customer willingness, creating the risk for CSC. The power short falls 
and insufficient cold storage facilities are the next which create a risk in warehousing and 
storage and must be taken into consideration when establishing the plan for performance 
improvement of CSC (Hariga et al., 2017, and Ashok et al., 2017). In the transportation 
stage of a CSC, factors such as failure of transportation facility, refrigeration units, and poor 
conditions of modes of transportation create the risk for the same during this stage. In the 
past few decades, security risk became a major concern of management, especially in CSC Risk Factor Appraisal in CSC Performance System 33
industries (Adekomaya et al., 2016). Sheth et al. (2020) presented that because of the change 
in consumer behaviour of purchasing and eating, a risk of the mismatch in demand and 
supply has been observed by most CC industries.
3.2 Model Development (First Segment)
On the basis of the existing literature review, 25 risks and risk contributing factors have 
been identified. To establish a healthier platform to carry out the research, the Delphi tech￾nique have been performed. For the same, phase-wise discussions and brainstorming ses￾sions with industrial and academic experts have been conducted. As not all the risks have 
the same weightage of severity, out of the 25 identified risks, the seven most critical risks 
and their risk contributing factors have been selected for analysis. These risks are namely: 
environmental risk (R1), socio-political risk (R2), human risk (R3), distribution or delivery 
risk (R4), warehousing or storage risk (R5), security risk (R6), and a risk for a mismatch 
between demand and supply (R7). 
To mitigate these risks, the research work proposes six best possible alternatives with 
their importance ranking. Alternatives are namely: plan for robust risk management strate￾gies (A1), continuous temperature monitoring system (A2), integration of IoT to CC stages 
(A3), adoption of routine maintenance policies (A4), proper training of handling staff (A5), 
and adoption of energy and cost efficient refrigeration units (A6). 
After identifying and selecting the most critical risks and alternatives, AHP-PROMETHEE 
based a hierarchal model had been developed, as shown in Figure 3.1. To achieve the objec￾tive of the presented research work, a Delphi AHP –PROMETHEE approach has been used. 
The Delphi method is used to select the most critical risks as discussed above. To obtain the 
priority weights of the selected risks and risk contributing factors, an AHP approach has 
been used. Finally, to provide the ranking for the proposed alternatives, the PROMETHEE 
method has been performed.

3.3 Research Methodology
The objective of the presented work is to identify and prioritize the most severe risks and risk 
contributing factors, while recommending the best possible alternatives with their ranking 
(order) of preference. To achieve the objective, an in depth study of the previous research 
work related to CSC, research methodology of the various multi-criteria decision making 
(MCDM) techniques, such as AHP, ANP TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, and their strengths and 
weaknesses with their applications and examples have been done. Based on the same, 25 
risks and their contributing factors have been identified. To provide a healthier platform 
for analysis and to select the most severe risks, the Delphi technique has been performed. 
To conduct the Delphi technique, phase wise discussions and brainstorming sessions with 
field and academic experts have been conducted. The experts belong to different industries 
of perishable products and academic experts belong to management and engineering insti￾tutions situated in the Punjab region, India. As a result of that, out of 25 identified risks, 
the 7 most severe risks with their contributing factors and the 6 best possible alternatives 
to mitigate the same are selected for further analysis. After identifying the most severe risk, 
an AHP- PROMETHEE based approach has been used for analysis. An AHP technique has 
been used to find out the severity weights of the selected risks and risk contributing factors. 
After that, the PROMETHEE-II approach has been used to find out the ranking order of 
the proposed alternatives. A brief introduction of the used techniques for analysis of the 
presented work is given in the following section.
3.3.1 Delphi Technique
The Delphi technique is a method to determine the solutions or explore the new concepts 
for a real world problem that meet the future requirement of the society or an individual 
(Skulmoski et al., 2007). It was first proposed by Dalkey and Helmer in the 1950s. Nowadays, 
it is an extensively used and accepted method by researchers and management to reach a 
particular decision for a problem. To conduct the Delphi technique, a group of field or 
academic experts is selected. Thereafter, grouped discussion or brainstorming sessions are 
conducted using a questionnaire or face to face communications. Based on that, the projec￾tions and judgements of the experts are collected and summarized on a result sheet (Joshi 
et al., 2011). To conduct the Delphi technique for the analysis of the presented work, two 
groups of selected experts are structured. The first group comprises of 7 field experts from 
the different CC industries of the Punjab region, India. The second group comprises of 9 
academic experts of refrigeration and the supply chain field from different management 
and engineering institutions situated in Punjab and National capital region, India. Then, 
the problem regarding the severity of the identified risks was discussed separately with both 
of the groups in phone calls and face to face communications. As a result of the same, 7 of 
the most severe risks and their contributing factors and the six best possible alternatives 
have been selected for analysis. 
3.3.2 Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)
AHP is a multi-criteria decision-making tool that is used as a standard tool to find out a 
hierarchy of the preference for a set of attributes or criteria based on their priority weights. Risk Factor Appraisal in CSC Performance System 35
It was first proposed by Thomas Saaty (1980). AHP facilitates the decision makers to make 
decisions about the considered criteria or attributes based on their significance weights 
that are obtained from direct investigation of the organizations, perception, opinions, and 
judgements (Kumar et al., 2020; Tyagi et al., 2014 & Tyagi et al., 2015). To start with the 
AHP, a questionnaire containing the severity rating using Saaty’s 1 to 9 scale (as given in 
Table 3.1) has been structured and dispatched to 60 field experts of different CC industries 
and academic institutions of Punjab, India and 24 responses (response rate 40 percent) 
were received. After receiving the responses, the step by step procedure of the AHP was 
presented as:
The steps involved in the implementation of the AHP technique are 
Step 1: Development of a hierarchal model defining the different criteria and pos￾sible alternatives for the problem
Step 2: Construction of pairwise comparison matrix
To construct the pairwise comparison matrix, first a relative intensity for 
the severity of each risk and their contributing factors are obtained from the 
experts and averaged. An averaged relative severity intensity has been used 
to construct the pairwise comparison matrices for risks and risk contributing 
factors with respect to respective risk.

where
C I. . ( ) max N N/( 1) (3.5)

where A1= pairwise comparison matrix and
A2 = [𝑊1

, …, 𝑊𝑖, 𝑊n ]𝑇. (3.7)
According to Saaty, if the C.R. value for pairwise comparison is less than 0.1, then con￾sistency exists and the weights for pairwise comparison, as obtained from AHP analysis, are 
consistent and can be used for further calculation. 
3.3.3 The PROMETHEE Approach 
PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluation) 
is an MCDM tool that enables decision makers to make decisions regarding the selection 
of a precise or particular from a set of alternatives or actions (Vulevic and Dragovic, 2017). 
The simplicity and robustness in applicability makes it more attractive for the researchers to 
select the best solution from a set of solutions or alternatives. Based on the comparative anal￾ysis, it enables the decision makers to make decisions for which alternative is best and which 
is poorer (Brans and Vincke, 1985). The major downside of the generalized PROMETHEE 
or PROMETHEE – I, as presented by Vulevic and Dragovic (2017), is that it provides the 
partial ranking or order of preference for the set of alternatives. Therefore, to overcome the 
downside of the PROMETHEE – I, in the presented research work PROMETHEE – II has 
been used to find out the ranking of the proposed alternatives. The advantage of using the 
PROMETHEE – II technique is that it provides the complete ranking of the alternatives. 
The steps involved in the implementation of the PROMETHEE – II approach are given in 
the following section:Risk Factor Appraisal in CSC Performance System 37

Step 3: Determination of deviation by pairwise comparison. Deviation between alterna￾tive ‘a’ and ‘b’ can be calculated by using formula 
Dj (a, b) = rj
 (a) - rj (b) (3.11)
Step 4: Calculation of preference index function for each deviation. The preference index 
is obtained by multiplying the highest inclusive weight of the risk factor and deviation by 
pairwise comparison.

3.4 Numerical Illustrations
As discussed above, in the first segment of the research work, based on literature review and 
results obtained from the Delphi technique, the seven most severe risks of the CSC and their 
contributing factors and the six best possible alternatives have been selected for analysis.
3.4.1 (Segment 2): Implementation of AHP Approach
In the second segment, the priority weights of the risk and risk contributing factors have 
been calculated using the AHP approach. For the same, at first, a pairwise comparison 
matrix for the identified risks and risk contributing factors has been constructed and sever￾ity weights are calculated (following Equation 3.1 to Equation 3.3), as given in Tables 3.2 
and 3.3, respectively.
Similarly, the severity weights for other risk contributing factors have also been calcu￾lated. To check the consistency of the data, the consistency checks for each pairwise compar￾ison have been performed and the consistency ratio (C.R.), which shows the mathematical 
check of the test, are calculated (following Equation 3.4 to Equation 3.7). The results of the 
consistency check show that for each pairwise comparison, the C.R. values are less than 0.1, 
which justifies the requirement of the Saaty’s criteria. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
the severity weights calculated from the AHP analysis are consistent and can be considered

3.4.2 (Segment 3): Implementation of PROMETHEE Approach
To obtain the ranking of the proposed alternatives using the PROMETHEE method, 
first, a pairwise comparison matrix between the alternatives relative to the risk factors 
has been constructed. To construct the pairwise comparison matrix, the importance 
rating for the alternative to mitigate of the risks has been obtained. For the same, a 
questionnaire has been structured on a Google Doc on a rating scale of 1 to 9 and 
dispatched to 55 experts out of which 21 responses were received. After obtaining the 
importance rating for the alternatives, a pairwise comparison matrix for the alterna￾tives relative to risk factors has been structured. Thereafter, to remove the heterogene￾ity in the scale of the pairwise caparison matrix, normalization of the same has been 
done (using Equations 3.9 and 3.10). Then, by using Equation 3.11, the deviation by 
pairwise comparison for each alternative has been calculated. In the next step of the 
PROMETHEE approach, the preference index function for each deviation is calcu￾lated and obtained by multiplying the highest inclusive weight of the risk factor and 
deviation by pairwise comparison (using Equation 3.12). The negative values of the 
preference index matrix are put to zero. Thereafter, the global preference index for each 
deviation has been calculated (using Equation 3.13). Then, by using Equations 3.14 and 
3.15, calculations for the positive and negative outranking flow have been performed. 
Tables 3.5 and 3.6 show the pairwise comparison matrix for the alternative relative to 
risk factors and the determination matrix for the positive out ranking flow (F+) and 
negative out ranking flow (F-
), respectively.
Next, the positive out flow (F+) and negative out flow (F-
) are determined and the net 
flow for each alternative is calculated (using Equation 3.16). The net flow is the difference 
between the positive out flow (F+) and negative out flow (F-
). Then, based on the net flow, 
the ranking for each alternative is provided. The alternative having the highest value of 
net flow is given as rank one and considered as the most important for mitigating the 
risks, while the alternative having least value of the same is given as rank six and obtains 
the least priority of preference. The summary for the same is given in Table 3.7.

3.5 Results and Discussion
In a CSC, a product has to travel a long distance in the process of movement from pro￾duction to end consumption state. During this journey or transportation, many factors 
act upon it, such as social, geographical, environmental, political, economic, and natural 
disasters or pandemics (such as COVID-19), which directly or indirectly create risks for 
the performance of CSCs. In many situations, these risks cause huge loss of economy, envi￾ronment, and society and sometimes loss of human lives, such as in case of pharmaceutical 
and vaccine CSCs. Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify these risk and their contrib￾uting factors and take necessary action to mitigate before they happen. The current research 
work is aimed to identify and analyze these risks and their contributing factors, while at the

same time proposing the best possible alternatives to mitigate these risks. To achieve the 
objective, a Delphi based AHP-PROMETHEE-II approach has been used. As a result of the 
Delphi technique, the seven most critical risks and twenty-four risk contributing factors 
and the six best possible alternatives have been identified. The seven most critical risks are 
namely: environmental risk (R1), socio-political risk (R2), human risk (R3), distribution or 
delivery risk (R4), warehousing or storage risk (R5), security risk (R6), and risk in a mis￾match between demand and supply (R7). The alternatives are namely: planning for robust 
risk management strategies (A1), a continuous temperature monitoring system (A2), inte￾gration of the IoT to CC stages (A3), adoption of routine maintenance policies (A4), proper 
training of handling staff (A5), and adoption of energy and cost efficient refrigeration units 
(A6). Then, an AHP – PROMETHEE based hierarchal model containing seven risks and 
their contributing factors and six alternatives has been developed. 
To obtain the severity weight based hierarchy of the identified risks, an AHP method has 
been used. The results show that risks R3 (human risk, Wi = 0.3948) and R5 (warehousing 
or storage risk, Wi = 0.1863) are the two most severe risks and should be given the first and 
second priority of consideration, respectively, when preparing or planning for mitigating 
these risks. Therefore, a management and planning department must focus on the above 
two risks first so that the impacts can be reduced or mitigated before they happen. On the 
other hand, risk R2 (socio-political risk, Wi = 0.0262) forms the least priority of consider￾ation. The severity order of the risks can be summarized as: R3 > R5 > R1 > R4 >R7 > R6 
> R2. Similarly, the severity order of the risk contributing factors have also been calculated 
and are summarized in Table 3.4. To obtain one sight view of the severity weight for differ￾ent risks and risk contributing factors, bar charts have been constructed and are show in 
Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3, respectively.
To obtain the ranking of the proposed alternatives, the PROMETHEE – II approach has 
been used. The ranking from using the PROMETHEE - II approach depends on the net 
flow rate of the alternative. The alternative that gained the highest net flow rate forms the 
first rank, while the alternative with the least net flow rate ranked as least. Table 3.7 shows 
the summary of the alternative ranks as obtained from the PROMETHEE – II approach. 
The results obtained from the PROMETHEE -II method show that alternative A6 (adop￾tion of energy and cost efficient refrigeration units, net flow = 0.2307) and A1 (plan for

rates and are ranked as first and second, respectively. These are the most suitable to mitigate 
the risks, while alternative A4 (adoption of routine maintenance policies) forms the least 
rank since it obtained the least net flow (i.e. - 0.1675) and is least preferred. The other alter￾natives A2, A3, and A5 form ranks 3, 5, and 4, respectively. 
3.6 Managerial Implication and Future Scope
Due to the robustness and applicability of the outcomes, this research work forms a wide 
managerial and industrial application in CSC. This study enables the management and 
decision makers of the CSC to identify the most severe risks before they happen, the occur￾rence of which may cause a huge loss to the economy, environment, and society. On the 
other side, this research work also proposed the six best possible alternatives with their 
preference ranking, the adoption of which enabled the management of a CSC to mitigate 
these risks before their happening. Therefore, the outcomes of the research work enabled 
the decision makers to make decisions so that the risks, which may occur, can be mitigated 
and the performance of a CSC can be improved.
However, the current research work has various significant contributions for the 
improvement of the performance of a CSC and several limitations exist for the same. In 
the data analysis segment, the vagueness and uncertainty of data is often exempted while 
collecting the data. Therefore, in the extension of the current work, interested researchers 
may analyze the same considering the fuzziness of the data. At the same time, other MCDM 
techniques, such as ANP, TOPSIS, DEMATEL, EDAS, and ELECTRE, can also be used in 
the integration of a fuzzy system.

Abstract
India is among the leading countries in producing waste. This waste creates landfills upon dumping 
and is very hazardous to society. A Circular Economy (CE) is the best approach for dealing with this 
waste using the concept of the 3 R’s principle of reducing, reusing, and recycling, which increases 
the overall usage life cycle of the material. Though having many advantages, CE is not yet in routine 
practice by the industries. The current research work aims to find the barriers that hinder the prac￾tices of CE using a critical literature review in context to the rubber industries situated in India. A 
relationship between these barriers has been put forward in this research to find the most critical 
barrier using fuzzy DEMATEL. This research provides a strategy for the industries situated in India 
to enhance effective methodologies to overcome the identified barriers, which are the peculiar find￾ings of this research.
Keywords: Circular Economy (CE), Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM), Barriers,

4.1 Introduction
India is the fastest developing nation globally with a massive population of around 1.38 
billion (Census, 2011). Due to obvious reasons, India’s waste creation is very massive, which 
has generated environmental issues and difficulty to humanity. CE is a breakthrough for 
reducing this growth of waste by which the waste is processed to use in a different cycle. CE 
works on the 3R’s principle, i.e., reduce, remanufacture, and recycle. CE increases the lifes￾pan of materials and products by enabling its usage after its earlier lifecycle either for the 
same purpose or for another purpose. This would help the product be in the market for the 
maximum time, it reduces the virgin material consumption, and reduces the waste created 
by dumping the product after its usage. 
CE practices are still in the beginning stage for an Indian context. The recycling and 
upcycling of material is an urgent need of society. Implementing the same help and actions

governed by CE paradigm not only aids in creating environmental balance, but also assists 
humanity attain a healthier lifestyle. To pursue the same, current research aims to imple￾ment CE practices in the Indian manufacturing industry. During the literature survey, it is 
noticed that the hazards from rubber industries are enormous and they find difficulties in 
implementing CE philosophies. To define a framework for the adoption of CE principles, 
barriers for the adoption of CE practices have been identified in this research, taking the 
context of rubber industries situated in Punjab, India. Barriers are identified by brainstorm￾ing sessions with the experts and with the help of available scholarly literature. Rubber 
industries are specifically preferred as rubber causes much pollution at the end of its lifecy￾cle on either burning or dumping, although if it is reused for the same or another purpose, 
it would be very advantageous for society and the environment. This research identifies 
the eleven most prominent barriers to implementing CE practices and it is aimed to find 
a contextual relation between them and their effecting nature. To find the same, a fuzzy 
DEMATEL approach is applied in this research work to identify the causing or effecting 
nature of barriers. This research has tried to address two fundamental objectives:
• Identification of critical barriers which are hindering CE practices, especially 
in the context of rubber industries
• To obtain a relationship between the barriers interaction and classify the bar￾riers based on their causing and effecting characteristics
4.1.1 Motivation
Rubber is an essential product nowadays and gains its application from a simple balloon to 
a rocket propellent. Except for natural rubber (NR), rubber materials are generally petro￾leum-based (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008). The consumption of natural resources causes 
extreme environmental hazards and subsequently exhausts the natural resource reserve. The 
urgency of rubber recycling and environmentally friendly production is needed because of 
the rise of petroleum prices and greater awareness of the environment, which will further 
help the industries and society for environmental and monetary reasons by recycling scrap 
rubber and rubber recycled materials. Automotive industries solely consume 80% of the 
rubber’s total consumption in the world (Svoboda et al., 2018). Due to this high consump￾tion, this research majorly focuses on the automotive industries. CE processes have the 
capabilities to mitigate these effects by their inherent characteristics. 
4.2 Literature Survey
CE is an urgent need for society, although it is not accepted universally due to many hin￾drances in these implications. Many authors have found the barriers and challenges of CE 
adoption and have contributed to develop methodologies for them to overcome. The cus￾tomer bias towards recycled products (Singh and Giacosa, 2019) is supposed to be a higher 
influencing barrier, as a customer is the key member of the entire supply chain which aids in 
decreasing CE practice demands. Mangla et al. (2018) identified 16 significant barriers for 
adopting the circular supply chain, especially in developing countries, and focusing majorly 
on India. Guldmann and Huulgaard (2020) have provided an overview of the barriers that Exploring Interaction Among Barriers of Circular Supply Chains 47
hinder circular business models’ adoption using a multiple-case study of 12 Danish compa￾nies. Zhang et al. (2019) concentrates research on barriers related to smart waste in China. 
De Jesus and Mendonça (2018) focus on the eco-innovation (EI) alleyway and examine the 
obstacles that create hinderances in CE adoption and targeting to merge innovation and 
transformation towards CE practices for better sustainability. Ranta et al. (2018) and Tura et 
al. (2019) identified and provided a framework of the drivers and barriers to adopting CE.
Adoption is very much dependent on the region or the area for the feasibility of the 
process. The specific region also contributes in creating barriers to its adoption in the form 
of unavailability of work force (Guldmann and Huulgaard, 2020), unskilled work force 
(Kamble et al., 2018), and transportation issues (Ranta et al., 2018). 
Some authors contribute in categorizing the barriers into different classes: Araujo Galvão 
et al., 2018 classify the CE hinderances into seven modules, while Ritzén and Sandström, 
2017 categorize CE barriers in five groups of financial, organizational, operative, attitudinal, 
and technical barriers, and Tura et al., 2019 classifies obstacles to CE into societal, finan￾cial, ecological, political and institutional, supply chain, technical and informational, and 
structural aspects. 
CE practices are crucial in every industrial and manufacturing sector in order to mini￾mize waste growth towards better sustainability. Several authors acknowledged hinderances 
of CE for different industrial sectors including the leather businesses (Moktadir et al., 2018), 
manufacturing sector (Kerdlap et al., 2019), construction and demolition sector (Hart et 
al., 2019; Mahpour, 2018), eco-industrial park organizations (Zeng et al., 2017), electronic 
businesses (Werning and Spinler, 2020), and the plastic sector (Paletta et al., 2019).
The literature review highlights that though having tremendous advantages and the 
urgent need of CE in routine practices, it faces many challenges. During the extant study, 
it is found that researchers are not very focused on rubber studies and research is lacking 
in this field. Moreover, studies with respect to Indian context are also very limited. This 
research emphasizes these identified research gaps and attempts to determine a perfect 
measure for overcoming these hindrances which could help in the transition of rubber 
industries towards CE practices. The practices would support in handling the sustainability 
issues which have shattered humanity. 
This research identified eleven prominent challenges to CE implementation to rubber 
manufacturing industries situated in India which are highlighted below:
Identified Barriers & Challenges to Circular Economy
BR1. Lack of Government Support and Pressure (Guldmann and Huulgaard, 
2020; Luthra et al., 2018; Rosa et al., 2019)
There is a lack in government support in terms of recognition and finan￾cial help to the industries ensuing CE practices, such as tax benefits and 
rewards. In addition to this, government policies to the industries are not 
appealing to move them towards CE practices.
BR2. Lack of Supportive Public Procurement Policies (Kerdlap et al., 2019; Singh 
and Giacosa, 2019)
There is no well-defined procurement process for collecting used products 
or material from the users and, in turn, creating this process by the indus￾try alone is a very problematic task.48 Optimization of Industrial Systems
BR3. More Risk in CBM as Compared to Linear BM (de Jesus and Mendonça, 
2018; Velenturf et al., 2019)
Financial risk, legal risk, and operative risk are less in linear BM than 
CBMs due to additional uncertainty created in the value chain. Along with 
this, assessment and risk management tools are deficient.
BR4. Lack of External Funding Opportunities (Mangla et al., 2018; Nasir et al., 2016)
For the execution of circularity in the product, changes in the organization 
are needed directly in financial terms. Raising funds is a complicated task. 
External funding agencies and government support are missing.
BR5. Challenges of Lower Quality of Recycled/Returned Items (Kumar et al., 
2018; Singh and Giacosa, 2019)
As the product user is different and their style of using the product is dif￾ferent, the user’s returned product would also be different and in different 
conditions. In many cases, this can happen when the returned product is 
not up to standard and cannot be further processed, which can create a 
substantial financial loss to the organization. 
BR6. Low Price of Virgin Material as Compared to Recycled Material (Mahpour, 
2018; Paletta et al., 2019)
In some cases, it is seen that the price and quality of virgin material are 
cheaper compared to its recycled cost. Also, the quality is a reliable and 
consistent supply of the virgin material which hinders the organization to 
move towards CE practices.
BR7. Lack of Leadership Commitment (Preston, 2012; Tyagi et al., 2015b)
Every organization takes considerable time to build a good network and 
policies for their businesses. Taking a new challenge to change/modify the 
processes suddenly is an enormous task to management. In many cases, 
top management is not committed to change due to the risk of financial 
losses and losing valuable customers.
BR8. Unwillingness to Change Product Design (Farooque et al., 2019; Knight 
and Jenkins, 2009)
For enabling circularity of the product, the product’s design must follow 
specific procedures and redesign of old products may be required, which is 
a very tedious task for the organization.
BR9. Lack of Internal Resources (Morseletto, 2020)
For recycling and remanufacturing of products and material, new machin￾ery, fresh skilled employees, and existing employee training are needed and 
for this additional investment is needed, which is not available in all cases.
BR10. Pursuit of Short-Term Profitability Despite Long-Term Sustainability 
(Bocken et al., 2014; Tyagi et al., 2015c)
Organizations are more satisfied with the current ongoing processes and 
the profit they are earning currently and are not very concerned with envi￾ronmental and long-term sustainability. 
BR11. Lack of Market Pressure and Demand (Kirchherr et al., 2018; Singh and 
Giacosa, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019)
The customer is the critical driver for the effectiveness of any process. As 
of now, customer demands are not very clear towards CE. Customers are Exploring Interaction Among Barriers of Circular Supply Chains 49
concerned about the increasing waste in the world but are unaware of how 
they can help reduce this waste. Unawareness of customers is the main 
barrier for the CE, creating a lack of market demand and pressure. 
4.3 Methodology
This research aims to enhance the circularity of rubber products. For that purpose, rubber 
industries are chosen, more specifically, the industries that are dealing in the manufacturing 
of automobile components, such as brake shoes, tires, tubes, brake paddles, and belts, in 
which rubber is used as a base material. Due to the issue of enormous industries working 
in this field all over the country, present research work has been confined to the industries 
situated in the Punjab region, especially in the Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, and Jalandhar 
districts. In general, it is seen that working culture of the industries is very much influenced 
by the region or the country. So, limiting focus on particular region does not affect the 
result generalization for other industries situated in rest of the country. 
Various case studies and interaction with the industries’ officials are carried out for a 
better understanding of the problem. Based on interaction and various research literature, 
eleven of the most prominent barriers are identified. Then, to find the effectiveness and 
importance of these barriers, data was collected and recorded using a questionnaire-based 
survey in linguistic terms from five groups of experts: two group of experts from relevant 
industries, two groups from academia researching on similar areas, and one group of gov￾ernment officials dealing with waste management. Each group contains three to four experts 
related to the relevant area of research work. The data recorded from the responses of the 
expert teams was then analysed through the application of a fuzzy DEMATEL approach. 
The data obtained from the experts’ opinion survey is used directly in the MCDM method 
for the sake of optimization and classifying the identified barriers in cause-and-effect 
groups to deeply identify the influencing nature of barriers. The classification of barriers 
helps in constructing strategical mitigating approaches. 
Fuzzy DEMATEL or f-DEMATEL is an extended version of the DEMATEL method. The 
assimilation of a fuzzy set theory in the method assists in dealing with data uncertainty and 
vagueness and additionally undertakes the improper judgement by experts in the opinion 
survey. The insertion of fuzzy set numbers in the mathematical model helps in developing 
a more robust result as compared to normal integer crisp values.
A step by step solution of the methodology of the MCDM approach is explained below 
(Tyagi et al., 2015a):
Step 1: The responses obtained from the expert teams are recorded and then used to 
develop a linguistic scale direct-relation matrix. A sample of the responses made by one of 
the experts is shown in Table 4.1. The prompting nature of barriers has been enlightened by 
this table: barrier BR1 has no impact on barrier BR5 and BR6, there are shallow influence 
on barriers BR8 and BR10, there is a low influence on barrier BR3 and BR9, strong influence 
over the barriers BR7 and BR11, and very big influence on barrier BR2 and BR4, for example. 
Step 2: Then, the direct-relation matrix of the linguistic scale has been transformed into 
the conforming triangular fuzzy numbers using Table 4.2. Table 4.2 demonstrates the scale 
of the fuzzy linguistic that is used for the conversion of linguistic variables into triangular 
fuzzy numbers. 50 Optimization of Industrial Systems
All the expert teams’ linguistic direct-relation matrix were then converted in a triangular 
fuzzy number direct relation matrix, using Table 4.2, separately. Then, the next step was to 
transform these fuzzy numbers (e, f, g) into crisp numbers, which is done by using Equation 
4.1.
L e = + f g +

Here, L shows the crisp number obtained by De-fuzzifying the fuzzy number. 
A de-fuzzified direction-relation matrix by Expert 1 is portrayed Table 4.3 by using 
Equation 4.1.

4 Very extreme effect (VE) (0.75, 1.0, 1.0)Exploring Interaction Among Barriers of Circular Supply Chains 51
Step 3: The next step is to construct an average direct-relation matrix which is obtained 
by taking the average of the de-fuzzified direct-relation matrix of all expert teams. The 
average direct relation matrix A is constructed by using the relation in Equation 4.2 and is 
shown in Table 4.4.

Here, M represents the respondents and is taken as 5 in the present case.
Step 4: After that, the next task is to homogenize the data for the normalized initial

Step 5: The next task is to construct the total relation matrix, which has been computed 
using the relation mentioned in Equation 4.5 and is displayed in Table 4.6. The original

Here, I represents the identity matrix and U is the total relationship matrix.
Overall, impact relationships among the barriers are governed by a total relation matrix. 
Here, the five topmost values are highlighted to visualize the affecting nature of barriers. 
Step 6: Then, find the sum of the rows (R) and the sum of the columns (S) from the total 
relation matrix, which is calculated using the following relation:
= ∑
  =  × R u j
n ij n 1 1 (4.6)
= ∑
  =  × S u i
n ij n 1 1 (4.7)
The overall impact on barrier j by barrier i is represented by R and on the contrary S 
represents the overall effect of barrier i by barrier j.
Step 7: (R+S) and (R-S) values of the identified barriers are obtained in Table 4.7. Based 
on the values obtained from this table, the barriers are classified in cause-and-effect groups. 
(R+S) values indicate the importance of a barrier, representing its effect power. (R-S) values 
indicate the causal-effect relationship between the barriers. The negative (R-S) value sug￾gests that the barrier falls to the effect group and the positive value suggests that barriers 
falls under the cause group. 
A pictorial representation for the cause and effect nature of barriers is shown in Figure 
4.1, which is obtained from the (R+S) and (R-S) values mentioned in Table 4.7. 
R+S and R-S values of the barriers are pictorially depicted in Figure 4.1. If the barriers 
have a positive R-S value, then it comes under the cause group and negative R-S value comes 
under the effect group. Here, BR3, BR5, BR6, BR8, and BR9 come under the cause group 
and BR1, BR2, BR4, BR7, BR10, and BR11 come under the effect group.

By using the obtained threshold value, the barrier’s interaction matrix is constructed and 
depicted in Table 4.8, which illustrates the interaction between the barriers.
Here, the + sign in BR12
 shows that Barrier BR1 is influenced by BR2 and has higher 
interaction power. 
After that, rating of the barriers occurs according to their interaction power, as depicted 
in Figure 4.2. The rating of the barriers is based on the values obtained from the R+S value. 
The higher is the barrier rating, the greater the interaction power. 
According to Figure 4.2, barrier BR7 has attained the maximum barrier rating among all 
the stated barriers, meaning that it has the maximum interacting power. Barrier BR5 has

attained the least value. The difference between the highest and second-highest barrier is 
only 0.06, which is significantly less, directing close competition between the two. 
4.4 Results and Discussion
Important ratings of all barriers based on R+S values are obtained in Table 4.7 and 
Figure 4.2. The observed rating shows that the barrier has a greater risk in CBM com￾pared to the linear business model (BR3), has a superior importance rating compared to 
all other identified barriers, and is the most hindering towards CE adoption strategies. 
The low price of virgin material compared to recycled material (BR6) has attained the 
lowest importance rating showing that this barrier needs little attention for the success￾ful implementation of CE. The order of importance rating of all the barriers is expressed 
as BR6<BR5<BR10<BR2<BR11<BR1<BR4<BR9<BR8<BR7<BR3. Thus, industries and 
governments should work together to create a risk-free environment for better adoption 
of CE practices.
With the obtained values from R-S, categorization of the barriers into causes and 
effects is carried out. Barriers, namely, having a greater risk in CBM compared to linear 
BM (BR3), challenges of lower quality of returned/recycled items (BR5), the low price of 
virgin material compared to recycled material (BR6), an unwillingness to change product 
design (BR8), and lack of internal resources (BR9) have positive (R - S) values, governing 
that they fall in the cause group. The other barriers, such as lack of government support 
and pressure (BR1), lack of supportive public procurement policies (BR2), lack of exter￾nal funding opportunities (BR4), lack of leadership commitment (BR7), the pursuit of 
short-term profitability instead of long-term sustainability (BR10), and lack of market 
pressure and demands (BR11) have negative (R - S) values, governing that they fall in the 
effect group. The barriers belonging to the cause group influence the effect group barri￾ers. According to Table 4.8, the interaction matrix, barrier BR3 is found to be the most 
influential barrier with the influence on BR1, BR2, BR4, BR5, BR7, BR8, BR9, and BR11, 
although Table 4.6 suggests that BR3 has substantial effects on BR1 (lack of government 
support and pressure) and BR7 (lack of leadership commitment innovation capacity). It 
is evident that by the support of government and leadership commitment, risk factors can 
be minimized.
From Figure 4.1 it is observed that cause group barriers (BR3, BR5, BR6, BR8, and 
BR9) have a superior interaction power degree which governs that they have more impact 
over the barriers falling under the effect category (BR1, BR2, BR4, BR7, BR10, and BR11). 
Furthermore, barriers BR3, BR8, and BR9 are found to be core barriers or influencing 
barriers as they have more eminence and relation. Barriers BR5 and BR6 are found to 
be the driving barriers as they have low eminence and high relation with other barriers. 
Barriers BR2, BR10, and BR11 are independent or autonomous barriers as they have low 
eminence and low relation. Barriers BR1, BR4, and BR7 are impact barriers as they have 
high eminence but low relation, are positively affected by other barriers, and cannot be 
directly improved.
The obtained results from the study help managers develop strategies which can help 
to cut out the barriers step by step. The study has proposed a framework of barriers to the 
managers and policymakers and this can direct them to hit the barrier with the greatest Exploring Interaction Among Barriers of Circular Supply Chains 57
effect first and subsequently the remaining barriers. The barrier of greater risk in CBM, 
as compared to the linear business model (BR3), is the highest priority barrier and for 
removing the same some risk towards new innovation might be taken by the authorities for 
fruitful results. New innovations always come up with some risk and managing the risk is 
of the utmost importance, which is the same for the present case. Lack of leadership com￾mitment (BR7) is obtained as the second most influential barrier in the present framework, 
showing the importance of the role of leadership towards adoption of innovations. Leaders 
and managers could focus on environmental sustainability rather than focusing only on 
profit making strategies. Although implementations of CE strategies would aid them to 
draw more profits as the CE practices not only focus on environmental sustainability, but 
take enterprises’ profit to top priority. In a nutshell, it can be stated that if the top prioritized 
barriers are removed from the enterprises by the managers’ and decision-makers’ efforts, 
then it will be easy to implement CE values to their organizations.
4.5 Conclusion and Future Scope
The reduction of waste generation and improvement in its treatment for reusing is an 
urgent need of society. CE is an essential practice for this need. To meet the research objec￾tive, the eleven most prominent barriers are identified and the fuzzy DEMATEL approach 
is applied for their analysis. Fuzzy DEMATEL is an extension of the DEMATEL approach 
used to decrease or avoid vagueness and increase the judgment’s preciseness. Barriers are 
categorized into cause-and-effect groups using fuzzy DEMATEL. The study concludes that 
the cause group barriers (BR3, BR5, BR6, BR8, and BR9) have a superior degree of interac￾tion and influence over other barriers. Thus, these cannot be overcome directly and need 
more attention. According to the result obtained, there is more risk in CBM compared to 
the linear business model and (BR3) is the most influential barrier, which is related directly 
to the fact that management is not willing to change the product design (BR8) and lack of 
internal resources (BR9). If BR8 and BR9 can be reduced with top management support, 
then risk (BR3) of product failure can be minimized. Barrier BR5 (decreased quality of 
returned product) can be minimized by enhancing the supply chain for returned products 
and improving quality checks.
On the contrary, the effect group barriers (BR1, BR2, BR4, BR7, BR10, and BR11) are 
influenced by the cause group barriers and can be improved. Therefore, for CE prac￾tice adoption, there should be backhand support from the government, management, 
and funding agencies, which can be easily implemented by the government and local 
agencies’ initiatives. In the future, companies following CE as practices would be the 
leaders, so instead of thinking of today’s profit, companies should focus on long term 
profit (BR10). On the concluding trail, waste minimization is of the utmost importance 
in this research and the critical hindrances from this research are the government’s lack 
of pressure, lack of top management support, and scattered customer vision towards 
waste reduction. 
The present research offers an empirical overview of perceived barriers and highlights 
their categorization into categories of causes and effects and interaction degrees. The pres￾ent study’s findings could enable managers to build an effective and reliable CE supply chain 
network by enhancing their overall productivity and eminence.58 Optimization of Industrial Systems
4.6 Limitation of Study and Future Scope
Although this research has a wide application in rubber industries’ products in automobile 
sectors, its scope is limited. In this research, specified rubber industries (automobile-based) 
are chosen so it cannot be generalized for every rubber industry manufacturing rubber 
made products. Respondents were also from a specific area (Punjab), so present research 
could not be generalized for all over the country, as different zones have different limita￾tions and advantages. Secondly, to validate the obtained results of the current research, 
other modified and advanced multi-criteria decision-making tools can be used, such as 
intuitionistic MCDM, grey based MCDM, and Z-number based MCDM. Thirdly, barriers 
related to other manufacturing sectors can be focused, such as plastic and leather manu￾facturing organizations, as the hazards caused by them are massive and a combined model 
could be generated.

Abstract
This investigation was done on 10 healthy subjects which includes both males and females in the age 
set of 20-30 years (mean: 24± 1.944 years). The examination was performed to survey the impact 
of graded HUT and HRT on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The tilt angles 
taken to record the data were 00
, 200
, 400
, 600
, 400
R, 200
R, and 00
R. After that, time domain and 
frequency domain parameters were analysed. On evaluated head-up tilt (00
 to 600
), the mean heart 
rate, LF, and LF/HF showed a growing trend and the mean RR, NN50, pNN50, and HF showed a 
declining trend. On reversal of the tilt (600
 to 00
R), all the parameters showed an inverse trend as 
that of the trend from 00
 to 600
. These trends clearly depict that graded HUT leads to an escalation 
in sympathetic activity but a decrease in parasympathetic activity, which is clearly seen at higher 
tilt angles (200
 to 600
). When the tilt-table was reversed, both the parasympathetic and sympathetic 
activity of ANS came back to regular pre-tilt level. The tilt-table test is basic and non-invasive and 
can be easily utilized clinically for the analysis and affirmation of syncope dysfunction of the ANS.

5.1 Introduction
Lying and standing are considered to be simple, but they implicate a lot of variations in dif￾ferent portions of the body. The Autonomic Nervous System is the most affected by postural 
changes [1]. The changes occurring during HUT correspond with the changes occurring 
while standing. While standing, blood begins to stream towards the lower body parts and 
as a result pooling of the blood occurs in lower organs of the body and low pressure in the 
carotid sinus [2]. A tilt-table test is basic and non-invasive and was described in 1986 as an 
analytical tool to govern the state of the Autonomic Nervous System [3]. A tilt-table test is 
safe and the likelihood of an event of complexities and problems is extremely low [3]. Every 
parameter of SNS and PNS returned to nearly pre-tilt values on graded head-reverse tilt

R [4]. ECG stands for electrocardiograph, electrocardiogram, and electrocar￾diography, where all the three terms have different meanings but are related to the heart. An 
electrocardiograph is equipment which is utilized to define the electrical action of the heart. 
An electrocardiogram is the output result, which is a progression of sinus rhythm, whereas 
electrocardiography is the procedure of generating an electrocardiogram [5]. It is utilized 
to evaluate the electrical function and muscular capacity of the heart. An electrocardiogram 
gives the rate and pattern of heartbeat and, indirectly, it gives information about the blood 
stream to the heart muscle [6]. Heart rate is described as the number of times the heart 
beats in a minute. HRV is referred to as the physiological event of alteration in the. time 
interval between two consecutive heart beats that is calculated in seconds or milliseconds 
[7]. HRV analysis is generally used for evaluating ANS functioning [8]. The main objectives 
of this paper were to evaluate the changes occurring during elevated HUT and HRT on the 
SNS and PNS, which are the two constituents of the ANS, to determine if there is any rela￾tion of the effects occurring in the ANS with different degrees of tilt.
5.2 Materials and Methods
5.2.1 Pre-Requisites
A motorized tilt-table was used for the study. It has 4-foot positioning straps for holding 
the subject in a stable position. The tilt table has a non-slipping mattress and cushioned 
footboard so that the subject may not feel as if he is suspended in air, a handheld safe 
remote control attached to an 8-foot cord, and 4 locking casters. The tilt angles are natu￾ral stimuli which are internally induced into the subject and are controllable. No outside 
stimulus is given to the person. The materials used during the recording of the ECG signal 
are a BIOPAC lead set (SS2LA), disposable vinyl electrodes, BIOPAC software BSL PRO, 
and a data acquisition unit. The computer is turned on and the electrode lead is connected 
into CH1 of the DAQ, then the MP36 DAQ unit. Three electrodes were used per subject. 
The electrode leads are of three colours, which are red, white, and black. The red coloured 
lead signifies positive polarity and was pinched on the electrode applied on the medial 
surface of the left leg just above the ankle bone. The white coloured lead signifies nega￾tive polarity and was pinched on the electrode applied on the right anterior forearm just 
above the wrist. The black coloured lead is for grounding and was pinched on the elec￾trode applied on the medial surface of the right leg just above the ankle bone. The leads 
were properly attached to the electrodes so that the leads were not pulling the electrodes. 
The electrode lead set was pinched on the person’s clothes to relieve tension in the cable. 
The ECG signal is sensitive to errors due to EMG, so the subject was asked to stay still 
during the recording process. EMG corruption and baseline drift should be controlled and 
minimized. Any external interference and errors arising due to motion in the study were 
neglected or eliminated. 
5.2.2 Inclusion-Exclusion Criteria
The subjects selected for the study were healthy engineering students, non-smokers, and 
non-drinkers. Subjects who were taking any medication or suffering from any cardiovascular Power Spectral Density Analysis of HRV 63
disease, diabetes, neurological disorders, or any other kind of illness which could affect the 
ANS functioning were not considered in the current investigation.
5.2.3 Subject Recruitment
The subjects were briefed regarding the procedure of data recording and consent was taken 
from them before starting the procedure. The data recording can be done in the morning, 
during lunch, and in the evening [3]. The recordings are taken between 9:00 AM and 5:00 
PM in an isolated room where all the physical parameters, like pressure and temperature, 
were kept constant. The room temperature during recording sessions was in the range of 
150
 C to 200
 C. The subjects were requested not to eat and drink coffee or tea at least 2 hours 
prior to the recording procedure. The chest strap was secured comfortably in a way that the 
subject could easily breathe.
5.2.4 Signal Recording
ECG data is acquired by utilizing BIOPAC software. It has user-friendly GUI so that we can 
select the required sampling rate (samples/second), channels on which the signals are to be 
recorded, and, later on, save for analysis purposes. The utilized sampling rate in this study 
was 1000 samples/second. The saved data was analysed using Spectral Estimation. The data 
was recorded in the biomedical instrumentation lab at the Department of Instrumentation 
and Control, NITJ. The evaluation was directed on 10 subjects out of which 8 were females 
and 2 were males. The selected subjects were in the age ranging from 20 to 30 years and had 
a mean age of 24± 1.944 years.
5.2.5 Proposed Methodology & Tilt-Table Testing Protocol
The recording procedure began from angle 00
 and went up to 600
 in steps of 200
 in graded 
HUT and in head-reverse tilt the subject was returned back to 00
 from 600
 again in steps of 
200
. The ECG recordings were taken in the following sequence of tilts: 00
, 200
, 400
, 600
, 400
R, 
200
R, 00
R (R depicts reverse position) for 7 minutes per degree tilt. During each angle of 
tilt, only the last 5 minutes data was analysed. Before recording the ECG data, 10 minutes 
of relaxation was provided to the subject in supine state. At 00
 tilt, the electrocardiogram 
was recorded for 7 minutes, then the table was tilted to the angle of 200
 and 5 minutes rest 
was given to the subject. After that, the ECG signal was again recorded at subsequent angles 
for 7 minutes. The recordings were started from 00
 tilt, then recordings were taken at 200
, 
400
, and 600
, then the angle of tilt was reversed to 400
, 200
, and back to 00
. The methodology 
opted for recording an electrocardiogram is shown in Figure 5.1. All ECG recordings were 
done with Lead II. An ECG gives a heart rate from which HRV and several TD and FD 
parameters are calculated and the electrocardiogram is analysed. In this paper, the time￾domain parameters include mean RR, mean HR, NN50, and pNN50, whereas the 
frequency-domain parameters analysed include LF, HF and LF/HF. During the resting 
period, i.e., before starting the procedure, the subject was asked to lie on the tilt-table in 
supine position and was held with positioning straps. Then, electrodes were applied on the 
skin of the subject in Lead II configuration of the ECG. The data was recorded for 7 min￾utes, but the last 5 minutes of data was analysed.64 Optimization of Industrial Systems
5.2.6 Spectral Estimation
Spectral Estimation is utilized to determine the PSD. PSD analysis provides knowledge of 
how power and variance are distributed as a function of frequency. The frequency depicts 
the period of time over which rhythm occurs. It forms the origin for distinguishing and 
tracing the signals of concern in the existence of noise and for extracting information from 
the received data. Fourier Spectrum Analysis is the foundation for almost every spectral-es￾timation equipment including FFT, compressive spectrum analysers, etc. Welch’s Method 
is an approach to spectral density estimation and is described in Figure 5.2. It is used to 
estimate the power of a signal at different frequencies. This method is based on the con￾cept of converting a signal from time to frequency-domain using the periodogram spec￾trum estimates. Welch’s Method diminishes noise in the estimated power-spectra rather 
than the frequency resolution and it is way better than the standard periodogram spectrum

estimating method. Fourier Spectrum Analysis makes assumptions regarding data out￾side the observation interval. These impractical assumptions diminish the quality of the 
evaluations. The analysis was executed in a five minute sliding window with a one-sec￾ond increments. This is the least possible length suggested to completely cover and capture 
spectral cardiac dynamics [16]. The heart beats are produced at 1 Hz, meaning the effective 
and efficient sampling frequency of HRV is 1 Hertz. All the useful content in HRV is con￾tained below 0.5 Hz according to the Nyquist Theorem [15]. The results are estimated using 
Welch’s Periodogram. For the utilization of Welch’s Periodogram, there should be prior 
knowledge of discrete Fourier-transform (DFT), spectral estimation, and basic and mod￾ified periodogram [7]. It is a non-parametric method which consists of the periodogram 
having a benefit of possible execution by means of Fast Fourier Transform. If data-length 
samples are chosen optimally, the periodogram technique based on Welch’s Method is pro￾ficient in providing good resolution. 
Procedure of Applying Welch’s Periodogram
(i) Non-probability sampling, which does not involve random selection, is 
selected to infer the studies.
(ii) The signal is split up into overlapping segments.
(iii) The overlapping segments are then windowed; the individual data sets are 
overlapped in time to reduce loss.
(iv) The Welch Method is a “modified” periodogram due to windowing of the 
data segments.

5.2.7 Time-Domain Parameters
The parameters analysed in TD and their descriptions are as follows:
• Mean RR: Mean of all RRi
• Mean HR: Mean of all heart rates
• NN50: Number of sets of adjacent RR intervals varying by greater than 50 ms 
in all the measurements requiring a 2 minute epochPower Spectral Density Analysis of HRV 67
• pNN50: NN50 sum total divided by total number of entire RR intervals. It 
also requires a 2 minute epoch. It is closely correlated with PNS activity and 
HF power [9].
5.2.8 Frequency-Domain Parameters
The frequency-domain method of HRV analysis takes out FD parameters, like peak fre￾quency and power in band, from the RRi signals. The mathematical transform of HRV data 
is utilized to differ, distinguish, and decipher SNS and PNS activity, as well as the ANS activ￾ity [5]. The HRV signal is then disintegrated into its fundamental frequency constituents 
which are computed in relative powers. The three basic frequency bands are:
• Very Low Frequency (VLF): 0.003-0.04 Hz
• Low Frequency Band (LF): 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, which is called the baroreceptor 
range because it depicts baroreflex activity durng resting states [10]
• High frequency Band (HF): 0.15 to 0.4 Hz, which is called the respiratory band 
as it relates to heart rate variations associated with the respiratory cycle [13]
Parasympathetic activity is signified by HF. The magnitude of HF constituents provided 
an index of vagal activity [13]. LF signifies sympathatic activity. During resting states, LF 
represents baroreflex activity [7]. LF may be produced by both PNS and SNS activity [11, 
12]. The SNS/PNS ratio describes autonomic balance.
Sympatho vagal balance SNS drive PNS drive LF HF (5.5)
The magnitude of LF components provided an index of SNS activity with vagal modu￾lation. LF/HF signifies the sympathovagal tone. The LF/HF ratio was used as a symbol of 
instant sympatho-vagal balance [14]. It is assumed that LF power may be generated by SNS 
and high frequency power may be caused by PNS. A small LF/HF ratio depicts parasympa￾thetic dominance, whereas an elevated LF/HF ratio specifies sympathetic dominance. The 
distribution of low frequency and high frequency power along with their central frequen￾cies may not be specified but may change with variations in the heart’s autonomic modu￾lations. Low frequency and high frequency power components are measured in absolute 
values of power (ms2
), but they can also be measured in normalized units (n.u.) that signify 
each power component’s relative value in fraction to the aggregate power excluding the VLF 
components. The depiction of LF and HF in normalized units emphasizes the balanced and 
controlled responses of the two divisions of ANS [7]. The benefit of n.u. is that normal￾ization has a tendency to lessen the effect on the values of LF and HF components of the 
alterations in total power.
5.3 Results and Discussion
On graded HUT from 00
 to 600
, the TD parameters, like mean RR, NN50, and pNN50, 
showed decrement and there was increment on HRT from 600
 to 00
. As expected, the mean 68 Optimization of Industrial Systems
heart rate incremented with elevated HUT from 00
 to 600
 and it decreased on HRT from 
600
 to 00
. Figures 5.3(a-g) show the results of parameters and tests reflecting SNS and PNS 
activities. The mean estimation of RR intervals showed a decreasing trend with increasing 
angle of tilt and shows an increasing trend for decreasing tilt angle, as shown in Figure 5.3a. 
In the case of heart rate, the mean HR was found to be increasing with a growing angle of 
tilt and was found to be decreasing with falling tilt angle, as shown in Figure 5.3b. In the. 
case of NN50, it showed similar patterns to the of mean RR, as shown in Figure 5.3c. In the 
case of pNN50, it also showed a similar pattern the of mean RR, as shown in Figure 5.3d.

 The mean± SD of every tilt angle has been calculated. It was observed in the mean RR that 
there was less variation from 00
 (802.093±100.644) to 200
 (822.571±106.003) and there was 
huge variation between 200
 (822.571±106.003) and 600
 (677.129±97.612). Similarly, a huge 
difference was observed between 600
 (677.129±97.612) and 200
R (817.861±108.338) and 
less difference between 200
R (817.861±108.338) and 00
R (842.853±115.06). In the case of 
mean HR, there is a small decrement from 00
 (76.217±8.763) to 200
 (74.259±9.616) and the 
values increased from 200
 (74.259±9.616) to 600
 (90.475±11.139) and during HRT, the val￾ues returned to nearly pre-tilt values, i.e., from 600
 (90.475±11.139) to 00
R (72.762±9.696) 
there was a decrement in HR values. The highest HR was found to be at 600
 (90.475±11.139). 
In the case of NN50, a decreasing trend was seen from 00
 (95.8±83.511) to 600
 (40.2±56.199) 
and there was an increasing trend from 600
 (40.2±56.199) to 00
R (83.7±68.331). In pNN50, 
an increasing trend was seen from 00
 (24.464±23.722) to 200
 (25.466±24.409), a decreasing 
trend was observed from 200
 (25.466±24.409) to 600
 (10.068±15.693), and again, after that, 
there was an increasing trend from 600
 (10.068±15.693) to 00
R (24.342±22.839).

In frequency-domain, on a graded HUT from 00
 to 600
, LF (n.u.) and LF/HF showed 
increment and a decreasing pattern was observed from 600
 to 00
R, as represented in 
Figure 5.3e and Figure 5.3g, respectively. It was seen that HF decreased for HUT from 
00
 to 600
 and was found to be increasing for HRT, as displayed in Figure 5.3f. LF depicts 
sympathetic activity. It was detected that LF decreased from 00
 (44.754±19.553) to 200
(40.317±21.677) but increased until 600
 (61.841±22.513) and thereafter decreased until 
00
R (38.005±18.033). LF/HF shows vagal tone. Similar patterns were seen for LF/HF, i.e., it 
decreased from 00
 (0.991±0.586) to 200
 (0.961±0.898) and increased until 600
 (2.852±2.483) 
and thereafter it decreased until 00
R (0.885±0.679). HF shows parasympathetic activity of 
ANS. In case of HF, it was detected that the values increased from 00
 (55.183±19.562) to 200
(59.581±21.633) and then decreased from 200
 (59.581±21.633) until 600
 (38.108±22.502) 
and then an increasing pattern was seen from 600
 (38.108±22.502) to 00
R (61.882±17.988).
5.4 Conclusion
The current investigation demonstrates the consequences of degrees of tilt and the changes 
occurring in the PNS and SNS associated with tilting. Raising the angle of tilt triggers sym￾pathetic activity and may be because of the increasing effect of gravity, which is felt most 
while standing, whereas its influence is least while lying. As tilt angle is enlarged, pooling 
of blood occurs in the bottom regions of the subject’s body, which affects the baroreceptor 
reflex [4]. As the angle of tilt increases, parasympathetic activity decreases. Blood starts 
to flow off the thoracic cavity towards lower body. Some subjects reported as if they were 
standing when tilt table was raised by 600
 during graded HUT. In the existing study, it has 
been seen that parasympathetic activation occurs during HRT, i.e., while returning back to 
00
 from 600
, indicates that the hydraulic gradient reduces, which leads to upward shifting 
of blood, i.e., flow of blood from the lower body to the thoracic cavity. Sympathetic activity 
decreases when angle of tilt reduces and may be because of gravity decrement. A small LF/
HF ratio specifies parasympathetic activity dominance in contrast to an elevated LF/HF 
ratio, which indicates sympathetic activity dominance that is visible from the above rep￾resented trend in Figure 5.3g of the LF/HF ratio. Current findings have depicted that PNS 
and SNS return to normal pre-tilt levels on graded head-reverse tilt. Since the complete 
procedure is non-invasive, it can be utilized for clinical and scientific research purposes.

Abstract
Mathematical modelling for the volatile organic compound (VOC) methane was performed during 
the warm-up period. A 1-dimensional model was developed based on its catalytic oxidation reac￾tion and heat and mass transfer between the catalytic surface and exhaust gas. The energy and mass 
balance equations were derived for the solid-phase and gas-phase forms with a system of partial 
differential equations (PDEs). The PDEs were solved with the Implicit Scheme and numerical com￾putations were carried out with the software Matlab. The variation of solid temperature, gas concen￾tration, and gas temperature with the axial distance of the catalytic converter was analysed using the 
catalyst Pt/δ-Al2
O3
. Also, the effect of changing parameters like surface area, gas temperature, solid 
temperature, cell density, and catalyst loading on methane conversion, were analysed.

6.1 Introduction
Poor air quality because of pollution is a foremost environmental concern that contributes to 
many health-related problems such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and lung can￾cer. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs) are strictly related to air pollution and climate change 
in urban areas [1, 2]. CH4
 is a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) released by vehicles [1]. “CH4
is a significantly m ore potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO2
)” [3, 4]. “Methane is 
accounted for 14% of the world’s GHG emissions and 8.6% of the European Union GHG emis￾sions in 2010” [2]. CH4
 emissions depend upon many factors, such as engine design, fuel type, 
age of the vehicle, and type of emission control system [2, 5, 6]. CH4
 is generally released from 
different sources such as diesel, gasoline, ethanol, methanol, LPG, natural gas-powered vehi￾cles, gas turbines, mining of coal, and the gas and oil sector. So, there is barely any industrial 
process where CH4
 is not released [3, 5]. CH4
, along with other unburned volatile organic com￾pounds (VOCs), is emitted due to incomplete fuel combustion in a vehicle’s engine [2, 5, 7]. 
*Corresponding author: umangbedi@live.com74 Optimization of Industrial Systems
At high temperatures, CH4
 combustion in the gas-phase causes NOx
 formation that is 
released with small quantities of GHSs into the air. Though, if the temperature required 
for the reaction gets lowered due to the presence of a catalyst, then a very small amount 
or almost no NOx
 is released as a pollutant [8]. Hence, the catalytic combustion of VOCs 
shows significant potential to destroy contaminants at lower concentrations, obeying pro￾gressively strict environmental guidelines [5, 8]. The catalytic converters used for the cata￾lytic oxidation of CH4
 offer many advantages such as small pressure drop and large surface 
area for reactions. Noble metal catalysts (Pt and Pd) are the most active and suitable cat￾alysts for such applications [9, 10]. To improve the monolith’s design, modelling is pre￾ferred over experiments because the experimental optimizations are expensive and very 
time-consuming. Numerical simulations also help to lessen the number of tests and inter￾pret the aspects of some parameters that are otherwise neglected [11, 12]. The variations in 
solid temperature, gas temperature, and gas concentration during the warm-up period are 
determined. Also, the effect of change in parameters like surface area, solid temperature, 
gas temperature, cell density, and catalyst loading in the decreasing warm-up period was 
studied.
6.2 Rate Kinetics 
Complete methane oxidation is represented by the following reaction:
CH4
 + 2O2
 → CO2

6.4 Methodology to Solve Dimensionless Equations
The dimensionless equations in Table 6.3 are coupled PDEs which are solved by implicit 
schemes using a finite difference formula, with the help of Matlab [16, 17], using the data 
available in literature in Table 6.4, for axial length, spatial derivatives in the equations are 
replaced with central finite-difference approximations and boundary conditions with back￾ward finite difference approximations. Now a set of ordinary differentials (ODEs) is solved 
by numerical integration by calling ode23tb solver, which is an implementation of the 
TR-BDF2 method [18].
6.5 Result and Discussions 
In Figure 6.1, the concentration of the entering methane gas is taken as 75 ppm [19] at 
655 K. Figure 6.1 shows the comparison of experimental result of methane conversion with 
the modelled results entered in the converter at a temperature of 298K. Hardly any con￾version has been seen below a temperature of 560K for experimental and modelled results. 
Conversion values are 0.50% for experimental and 3.53% for modelled results at a tem￾perature of 560 K. As soon as the catalytic reaction begins, the reaction rate increases by 
the exothermic reaction due to the release of heat. At a temperature of 641K, about 65.00% 
conversion is achieved for experimental results and 66.50% conversion is achieved for mod￾elled results. About 80.00% methane conversion for experimental results and 77.40% VOC 
methane conversion is achieved for modelled results at a temperature of 645K and both 
results are found in the agreement.
Figure 6.2 represents methane gas concentration variations with the axial length for 
dimensionless times. The inlet dimensionless values of methane concentration are taken as 
1.0000. There is no change in the methane concentration up to dimensionless time 40.00 
and at an axial distance of 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80 and 1.00, the values of the dimensionless 
concentrations are 0.9960, 0.9954, 0.9953, 0.9953, and 0.9953, respectively. The values of 
dimensionless concentrations are 0.9953, 0.8019, 0.5799, 0.3442 and 0.1079 for dimension￾less time 40.00, 89.00, 115.00, 145.00, and 201.00 at an axial length of 1.00, respectively. 
When the converter is at a temperature of 298K, there is barely any conversion. As the warm

gas heats the catalyst, the catalytic exothermic reaction starts and the conversion increases 
as the solid temperature rises. Methane concentration further decreases as it moves along 
the converter’s axial distance due to contact with more surface area.
Figure 6.3 shows the variation of gas temperature with the axial distance for dimension￾less times. At a 655K temperature, warm gas enters the catalytic converter. As gas flows 
along the catalytic converter’s axial length, its temperature decreases because of the heat 
transfer to solid catalysts from the exhaust gas through convection. At dimensionless time 
40.00, the values of gas temperatures are 606.05K, 560.40K, 519.10K, 482.59K, and 450.95K 
at axial length 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00, respectively, as seen in Figure 6.3. Due to 
exothermic reactions, more heat is released on the solid catalyst as time increases and heat 
is transferred to the gas, therefore, there is a rise in the temperature of the leaving gas. At 
dimensionless time 201.00, gas temperatures are 652.92K, 649.05K, 643.03K, 635.27K, and 
625.46K, at axial length 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00, respectively.
Figure 6.4 shows the variation of solid temperature with the axial direction for a dimen￾sionless time. Initially, the converter was at 298K; as time increases, the catalyst tempera￾ture rises, firstly because of heat supplied by the hot gas and later on due to the beginning

386.10K, and 368.94K at axial distances 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00, at dimensionless

time progresses, the effect of increasing inlet gas temperature on the methane conversion 
becomes more evident. The concentrations of methane are 0.8800, 0.7851, 0.6750, 0.4610, 
and 0.1036 for the inlet gas temperatures of 655K, 680K, 700K, 730K, and 780K at dimen￾sionless time 77.50, respectively. With the rise in inlet gas temperature, heat is transported 
from the gas through convection due to the higher gas temperatures to the solid surface. 
The conversion of methane takes a short duration as solid surfaces heat faster. 
Figure 6.7 represents the effect of an initial converter temperature of 298K and 313K and 
preheated solids at temperatures of 473K, 573K, and 623K on the conversion of methane gas 
entering at 655K and 75 ppm concentration. The preheated solids show a faster conversion 
of methane compared to the solid catalyst present at the ambient temperature, as shown 
in Figure 6.7. Initially, the exit concentrations of methane are 1.0000 and 1.000 for solid 
ambient temperatures of 298 K and 313 K, and 0.9930, 0.6810, and 0.1682 for preheated 
solid temperatures of 473K, 573K, and 623K at dimensionless time 0.10, respectively. The 
outcomes show that for a preheated solid catalyst above 573K, the catalytic reaction started 
almost instantly as the gas arrived at the catalytic converter. Hence, a prominent effect on 
methane conversion is observed at higher solid temperatures.

, respectively. The methane conversion increases 
with an in crease in the value of the geometric surface area. The reaction is accelerated due to 
the presence of more surface area and, therefore, has a faster conversion rate.
Figure 6.9 shows the methane exit concentration at different values of cell density. The 
concentrations of methane are 0.9109, 0.7491, 0.6111, 0.4267, and 0.2575 for cell density

operational temperature and methane conversion starts. Inlet gas temperatures affect the 
desired conversion. When the incoming gas temperature is raised, methane conversion is 
extremely fast. Also, the catalytic reactions begin much earlier for a preheated converter 
as compared to the catalytic converter at ambient temperatures, which converts methane 
much faster. With time, as catalyst loading reduces, it takes longer to reach the desired 
conversion. Therefore, the higher the value of catalyst loading, the faster the reaction rate 
and the less time required for conversion for a fresh catalyst. An increase in the geometric 
surface area and cell density also displays similar outcomes. As the geometric surface area 
increases, more surface area is offered for catalytic reactions. Hence, quicker conversion 
occurs. Also, the increase in cell density affects the overall conversion.

Flow in a Horizontal T Junction

Abstract
A standpipe, broadly used in the areas of energy management, is used in the form of a T-Junction in 
various gas and oil industries for transmitting certain flows from the source to the user. The geome￾try involves various parameters on which the efficiency of the flow depends. Hence, the appendage 
is both predesigned and retrofitted with maximum possibilities for optimum reliability of the design. 
The following chapter offers a far-reaching evaluation of the arousing elements on segment separa￾tion in branching T-junctions. The study is primarily focused on the inclination of geometry at var￾ious angles for analyzing the mixing state of olive oil and water. The validation is performed for the 
previously published experimental results on simulation software followed by a grid independence 
test. A three-dimensional study is conducted by considering olive oil and water flowing as the fluid 
in the branches at constant pressure. Eventually, parametric analysis is concluded by analyzing the 
effects of altering the various parameters on the efficiency of the affected flow. Results showed that 
with variation in inlet mass flow rate, a significant effect on the mixing region as well as flow in the 
outlet branch for all the inclination angles. Increase in the mass flow rate creates a dominant conse￾quence on the flow pattern as demonstrated by the streamlines. The pressure in the mixing region 
and in the outlet branch is also affected by modification in the mass flow rate. 
Keywords: T-junction, olive oil, water, inclination angle, steam lines, mass flow rate
7.1 Introduction
Transportation and supply of fluid and gases take place with the help of pipeline networks 
irrespective of distances, which includes a T-junction being a substantial part in the pipe￾line system. The dimensions, shape, or size of a T-junction may vary with its purpose. The 
angular dimensions of the branch projection with respect to the main projection may also 
vary [1–4, 6, 10]. This type of piping configuration is mostly used in Petro chemical sectors, 
electronic refrigerating devices, and power plants. A T-junction is majorly used for industrial 
purposes like combining or separating fluid flow. Figure 7.1 depicts various configuration of 
T-junction pipe. Considering certain cases in pipeline systems where there are not specifically

single-phase fluid flows, the mixture tends to divide in unequal proportion in the branched 
pipes. One branch may be rich in gases, whereas the other branch may be rich in fluid [7]. In 
coolant devices, fluids of two different temperatures flow through the pipe: one through the 
main pipe and the other from the branched pipe, leading to thermal stripping mainly at the 
junction of the pipe apart from the other areas of the pipe [9, 10]. Rigorous fusion of water at 
varying temperatures is one of the primary causes for thermal stripping in the junction [11, 
12]. Feedstock industries seldom deploy T-junctions to bifurcate the constituting components 
of the mixture(s) flowing through it. This further results in an unequal division of the com￾ponents amongst the sub projections/arms of the junction taken, thus the positioning of the 
junction is also a crucial concern in the process of bifurcation [6].
7.2 Literature Review
As is known, a lot of studies have been done and continue to be done on multiphase flows, 
i.e., liquid-gas-solid forming a total of seven hundred and twenty combinations. What 
remains under covered is the base which controls most of these theories of multiphase 
flows, i.e., liquid-liquid flow, and much less light has been reflected on this very important 
combination. A continuous flow of streams causes high cycle thermic fluctuations near 
the wall of the pipe. This temperature fluctuation leads to stress fluctuations, ultimately 
leading to thermal fatigue in the pipe, decreasing the functioning of the pipe due to the 
unstopped increase and decrease of the temperature inside the pipe [13]. T-junctions are 
mainly grouped into two types depending on their structure: 
1. Branching T-junction
2. Impacting T-junction.
In branching T-junctions there are two inlets and the fluid flowing through the outlet is a 
mixture of the various kinds of fluids flowing in through the different inlets. The final fluid 
may be a two-phase fluid or different kinds of fluids mixing at different temperatures. In 
impacting T-junctions, there are two outlets and a single inlet where the outlet’s streams are 
perpendicular to the inlet streams, as shown in Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3.

[6] have carried out an experimental procedure intending to study thermal stripping 
at various points in the pipe, where water at 40° takes its course through the main duct 
and water at 20° enters from the branched pipe which is at 45°. Thermal stripping was 
expressed in terms of PSD and St Number using FFT analysis. Various flowrates with a 
variety of branch injection directions were considered. Between the range of temperature 
of 1000-1500 seconds and at the fixed position of x/D=1,4,9 of the pipe, the temperature 
former performances were found to be a quasi-steady-state pattern when the velocity ratio 
was 7.81. The standard deviation of the calculated temperature at x/D=9 was beneath in 
comparison with x/D=1 or x/D=4. It was observed that thermal stress was greater at the 
junction of the pipe. A deviation of 10°C was noticed throughout the pipe. Closer to the 
intersection of the pipe, fluid at different temperatures was found to mix easily. The same 
was observed at the low-velocity ratio. Thermal alterations were observed maximizing at 
the intersection by the author. As we move away from the intersection of the pipe, thermal 
mixing characteristics decrease.

A T-junction piping system has an extensive appeal to the industries as a phase separator, thus 
[5] experimentally tested a slug flow regime with combined diameter ratios (D3/D1, D4/D1) of 
(01,0.52), (01,0.20), (0.67,0.52), (0.67,0.27), and (0.5,0.27) under physical conditions of atmo￾spheric pressure and at room temperature. The superficial gas velocities ranged between 0.388 
and 0.620 m/s and superficial liquid velocities ranged between 0.252 and 0.582 m/s. The exper￾imental setup resulted in an uncoupling efficiency of 93% in stratified wavy flow and 88% for 
slug flow. This experimental setup increases the efficiency by 5-25% for stratified wavy flow and 
20-35% for slug flow. Figure 7.4 depicts several factors impacting performance of T-junction.
[8] has studied the phase separation and different applications of impacting T-junctions 
and constituent separation. The penman stated that gravity affects the phase redistribu￾tion at a large scale. It was found that changing the pipe diameter hardly affects the phase 
redistribution, concluding that phase redistribution is hardly influenced by the diameter 
of the pipe when the superficial velocity is higher. The reason for this is that momentum is 
proportional to the quadratic velocity. For macro T-junctions, the phase separation is not at 
all affected by the diameter of the pipe, but in the case of a micro T-junction, the phase sep￾aration raises with the increment of the diameter of the pipe. The gas slug length is directly 
proportional to the superficial gas velocity. The phase separation of annular flow is more 
uniform than the slug flow. It was also stated in the paper that a uniform flow rate is only 
visible when the two outlets of the T-junction pipe have the same flow rate. It was studied 
that the phase separation is affected by the surface tension. The pressure increases with a 
decrease in phase separation, which leads to lower surface tension and the formation of 
smaller droplets inside the pipe. This formation of the smaller droplets leads to a reduction 
in the phase separation. Apart from the impacting kind of T-junction pipe system, [15] has

shed some light on the same characteristics and effects on the branching kind of T-junction. 
The paper represents experimental progress on the topic of T-junctions and various theoret￾ical models have studied accurately. Five different directions of pipe are stated by the author 
in the paper, which are both inlet and outlet being horizontal (H-H), inlet opening being 
downwards and branch pipe horizontal (D-H), inlet being horizontal and branched pipe 
vertical upwards (H-U), inlet being horizontal and branched pipe vertically downwards 
(H-D), and the inlet being vertically upwards and branched pipe horizontal (U-H). These 
configurations only affect gravity [14]. In a pipe with greater diameter, the direction of the 
branch pipe affects phase distribution more, whereas in the case of micro T-junction pipes, 
the direction factor of the branched pipe is untended because it does not have any impact 
on the phase distribution. When the diameter is taken under concern, it is found that the 
diameter of the macro T-junction has less impact on the phase separation and, on the other 
hand, in micro a T-junction with the increase in the diameter, the fractional mass of liquid 
(FL) reduces [16, 17]. Decreasing the diameter, the ratio separation efficiency increases. 
Increasing the quality of the doublet mass flux, the mass fraction of gas (FG) reduces. The 
mass split ratio is charged by operating the opening of the valve, which indicates that the 
pressure is also affected by it. When the split flow is low stratified or semi-annular in the 
pipe, the author states that the flow of the fluid increases with the rise in viscosity. With the 
increase in surface tension, generation frequency decreases gradually. The paper presented 
by [18] studied several factors affecting the phase separation of two-phase flow at three dif￾ferent circumstances. The experiment was first carried out when there was no metal foam 
in the T-junction pipe. Later, the same experiment was carried out when the metal foam 
was at 10 PPI and 20 PPI. Inlet gas superficial velocity was greater for 20 PPI than 10 PPI. 
It was noticed that when the flow type of the inlet fluid was annular and PPI was 10, the 
fractional mass of liquid (FL) was equal to the fractional mass of gas (FG) [19, 20]. When 
the inlet flow type was slug flow, the fractional mass of gas dominated over FL at every 
operating circumstance. Although inlet liquid superficial velocity has a very low effect on 
the fractional mass of liquid, with the increasing value of the former, the latter decreased 
[21]. In general, it was studied that the increasing PPI decreases the fraction mass of liquid 
in the case of phase separation. The predicted model for the annular flow was found to be 
more accurate than the model approached for slug flow. [23] has developed a spectrum 
method to investigate thermal stripping. Thermal fluctuation and its growth obtained were 
analyzed with the sinusoidal (SIN) method along with CFD load. A formula was proposed 
for the reference frequency, which can be utilized for the prediction of the frequency of dif￾ferent kinds of flows. It was seen that the spectrum method was more accurate than the SIN 
method as the results obtained from the former method were more accurate than the latter 
in the CFD simulations. [25] analyzed the STRUCT model against low Reynolds numbers 
for the DNS data of squared T-junctions. The mean and square root mean of temperature 
and velocity results obtained from the STRUCT model was obtained to be accurate with 
the DNS values. The STRUCT turbulence model describes accuracy like the LES model and 
URANS like computational meshing. 
 [22] investigated thermal properties where the crossflow type is taken inside the 
T-junction pipe where he has compared the software results with results obtained from the 
experimental setup. The author applied a hybrid LES/RANS model based on the VLES con￾cept. Using the elliptic-relaxation based eddy-viscosity model, residual turbulent motion 
was observed. Simulations with a background RANS model were used for comparison by 90 Optimization of Industrial Systems
the author. Thermal properties were studied for a two-dimensional configuration at a low 
Reynolds number and a three-dimensional configuration at a moderate Reynolds number. 
The results for the two-dimensional configuration were found to be very accurate with the 
reference value. It was also found that the VLES model was better in the prediction of 
results than the RANS model. The three-dimensional configuration flow field was predicted 
successfully by the VLES model. The results deviated from the reference result mainly in 
the y-direction.
The T-junction has a very big role in the nuclear reactor plant, rather the most important 
role in a nuclear power plant is the T-junction because it is used in the coolant system of the 
plant. Because of its simplicity in construction and cost-efficiency, it is widely used in every 
nuclear plant all over the world. Despite such an important use of this piping structure, very 
few works are done on this topic. [12] has shed some light on this usage of T-junctions in the 
real world. The author has discussed how heat is removed from an RBMK Reactor. Unique 
features of boiling, graphite moderator, light water, and channel type RBMK reactors are 
presented. A long-term investigation was made by the author on non-regular means of a 
cooling system in an RBMK reactor and four possible ways were concluded:
1. By ventilation of drum separator compartments
2. By direct supply of water to the reactor cavity
3. Heat transfer from fuel channels through CPS cooling circuits
4. De-pressurization of the reactor coolant system and water supply using 
non-regular means
The advantages and disadvantages of the various above stated coolant processes were dis￾cussed in the paper in detail by the author. It has been presented in the paper that the high 
heat capacity of the core due to the large quantity of graphite has an impact on beyond￾design-accidents. RELAP5 code was used to study the thermal-hydraulic characteristics 
using the reactor cooling system. RELAP/SCDAPSIM with “multidimensional heat con￾duction” was used to model heat transfer from the hot fuel channels through the graph￾ite column. CONTAIN code was used for analyzing the DS compartment ventilation. The 
cooldown of the graphite stack using water supply was found unsuitable due to the design of 
the reactor-cavity venting system [26, 28–30]. The results provided in the paper by the author 
were used in the preparation of measures taken by the accident management programmer 
for the RBMK-1500, concluding that the results are also valid for the RBMK-1000 reactor.
7.3 Methodology
In this paper, an analysis of the ramifications due to mixing olive oil and water at varying 
velocities, as well as varying temperatures, is conducted to observe different flow regimes 
and temperature and pressure fluctuations at the outlet [27, 30]. A T-junction is specifically 
taken as it is a very important segment in the industrial field of [1–4, 10, 27].
Also, it is widely used in the transportation of a combination of fluids over long distances. 
It is also majorly used in coolant devices and food industries. Along with all these appli￾cations, T-junctions play a key part in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) as well. The geometry 
taken for experimenting is a magnified view of a pipeline system focusing on T-junctions. Numerical Investigation of Two-Phase Flow in a Horizontal T Junction 91
The desired setup is designed using ANSYS DESIGN MODELLER with a specific dimen￾sion set. The full length of the main pipe is taken as 50mm with an outer bore of 5.8mm 
and an inner bore of 5mm [24]. The length of the branched pipe is considered the same as 
that of the main pipe and the other dimensions also remain intact. The geometry is further 
enhanced by creating a cavity filled solid, which was named as the fluid domain and the 
outer walls were named as the solid domain. Now, these domains are created to serve a spe￾cific purpose, that being to highlight very basic facts like the t junction would be carrying 
fluid material(s) through its inner walls, which is specified using the fluid enclosure and the 
solid enclosure emphasized on the nature of the material the T-junction is made of.

Furthermore, the cross-sectional area of a T-junction exhibiting the entry of Fluid 1 is 
named Inlet 1 and that of Fluid 2 is named as Inlet 2 [4]. Also, the cross-sectional area 
exhibiting the exit of the complete mixture is named as an outlet. All these names are given 
as per the function that each cross-sectional area was serving.
The experiment begins with olive oil and water flowing through Inlet 2 and Inlet 1, respec￾tively, at 20°C [4], with the branched pipe being perpendicular to the main pipe. Simultaneously, 
the results are obtained for this case. Then, water and olive oil are heated to 40°C [4, 11], each 
flowing with a speed of 50m/s. these fluids are again made to flow through the T-junction. 
Table 7.1 depicts branch pipe at 90°, 120°, and 30° with reference to the main pipe.
The experiment then further shifts focus to the angular alignment of a branched pipe 
by 120 degrees and 30 degrees to the main pipe with each variation facing the variations in 
temperature and velocity as done previously. Also, as soon as the geometry is created, mesh￾ing of the same also needs to be done. Meshing is basically creating multiple nodes on the 
geometry with the help of which the results are calculated. The greater the number of nodes, 
the better the results. Therefore, providing a fine meshing to the design in hand is crucial. 
Thus, we use the ICEM CFD Module in ANSYS, which is one of the finest modules for 
meshing. 251,200 nodes were created of hex dominant type and the complete meshing was 92 Optimization of Industrial Systems
made unstructured, which is supported by fluent, on which all the calculations are being 
done. Further analysis of the geometries is done and the boundary conditions are kept the 
same for all the geometries. The velocity of both olive oil and water is at 5m/sec. Water 
flows from Inlet 1 with a mass flow rate of 978555.5 kg/sec and olive oil flows from Inlet 
2 with a mass flow rate of 899054 kg/sec and the mixture flows out from the outlet which 
is a pressure outlet. The results are then calculated at the k-epsilon model with enhanced 
wall functions using coupled scheme and second-order upwind. The parameters are hybrid 
initialized to obtain the results.
7.4 Results and Discussions
This chapter investigates the mixing phenomenon of two-phase flow, i.e., olive oil and water 
flowing in two separate branches, meeting at a T-junction. Effects of inclination and veloc￾ity ratio are analyzed in terms of flow pattern, temperature lines, and pressure fluctuation 
across the domain. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) is used to study characteristics like 
complex properties and integrating properties, respectively. Equations like the continuity 
equation, Navier-Stokes equation, and the Kappa-Epsilon model were used to study the 
turbulent flow.
7.4.1 Validation of Result and Grid Independence Test
Validation is performed for the analysis performed by Athulya A.S, et al. [3] on the same 
domain of a T-junction containing two inlet branches at different inclination angles converg￾ing to form a junction, followed by an outlet branch of the same cross-section as an inlet. The 
problem is validated on ANSYS 15.0 with two cases of flow. The first case includes thee tem￾perature of both olive oil and water kept at 20°C, whereas the second case contains the tem￾perature of both olive oil and water heated to 40°C. Both are made to flow in the T-junction 
with a velocity of 5m/s and 50m/s, respectively. A good concurrence between results is shown 
in Figure 7.5. A grid independence test is conducted for the problem with different patterns 
of grids, as shown in Table 7.2. The case of a T-junction kept at 90° is observed and a plot of

air velocity across the outlet branch is compared with the obtained results. The diameter of 
the circular enclosure has also been fixed and the same surface area was used in validation.
7.4.2 Flow Distribution and Temperature Lines
Flow pattern and temperature distribution are observed for two velocity ratios across the inlet 
pipes. The higher velocity ratio signifies the requirement of high velocity flows. The mixing 
region shows a significant variation in thermal hydraulic behaviour. The greater mass flow rate 
has generated a wider mixing zone signifying more efficient mixing, as shown in Figure 7.11. 
More uniform temperature distribution is observed at a higher mass flow rate. Maximum tem￾perature gradient is noticed in case of a 120° inclination angle of a branched pipe at a velocity of 
50 m/s. Figures 7.6 and 7.10 depicts the temperature lines at outlet pipe at inlet velocity at inlet 
velocity 5 m/s at 30° and 120° inclination of branched pipe, respectively. The red part in Figure 
7.17 shows the variation. Dense mixing of water and olive oil is observed at higher velocities. 
The most even mixing is observed when the angle of the inclined pipe remains at 90°, as shown 
in Figures 7.8 and 7.9. Non-uniform temperature circulation is found in case of 30° inclination, 
as shown in Figure 7.7. Near the T-junction, the maximum temperature gradient occurs and 
starts decrementing along the pipe. The average variations in velocity are also observed. Flow 
lines and plots of average velocity along the length of the outlet pipe are drawn. Figures 7.14-7.16 
depicts the flow lines t outlet pipe at inlet velocity at inlet velocity 5 m/s and 50 m/s at 120° and 
5 m/s at 90° inclination, respectively. Figures 7.18-7.20 depict the same trend in velocity for all 
the inclination angles. Up to a certain limit, fluctuation is decrementing in nature followed by a 
steep rise. At a 120° inclination angle of branched pipe, the oscillations in velocity are observed 
at maximum. The flow is more streamlined in the case of a 30° angle of inclination, as shown 
in Figures 7.12 and 7.13. The peak in velocity is observed at the end location of the outlet pipe 
where the flow gets fully developed.

7.4.3 Effect of Velocity Ratio on Pressure Fluctuation
The average value of pressure fluctuation with axial position of the outlet tube is observed. 
The decreasing trend is noticed for every case, i.e., in Figures 7.21 and 7.22, but the inter￾esting observation made was pressure fluctuation across outlet pipes at inlet velocity 50 m/s 
at a 90° inclination angle of the branched pipe. Figure 7.22 shows the variation in pressure 
along the outlet pipe. Figure 7.23 shows the pressure fluctuation of along the outlet pipe at 
120° inclination angle of branch pipe. The pressure increases along outlet pipe as the flow 
gets fully developed. The influence of mass flow rate can be experienced in fluctuations of 
pressure along the outlet pipe. The maximum pressure drop occurs in at inlet velocity of 
50 m/s at 120° inclination angle of the branched pipe. According to the Bernoulli conse￾quences, the increase in pressure drop causes velocity of the mixture to amplify. This causes 
efficient mixing of the flow. At higher inclination angles, the effect is more profound.

Abstract 
The 1986 AASTHO Guide for the design of pavement structures needs the use of subgrade resilient 
modulus to design a flexible pavement. The term resilient modulus used in subgrade soil characteri￾zation is crucial for flexible pavement design. Resilient response of subgrades can be identified by a 
resilient modulus (Mr) that is in a stress-strain relationship like the modulus of elasticity. Generally, this 
factor is determined using CBR (California Bearing Ratio) tests. This article also discusses the seasonal 
variations of subgrade resilient modulus with moisture fluctuations and freezing and thawing.
Keywords: Flexible pavement, resilient modulus, CBR (california bearing ratio), moisture 
fluctuations, freezing, thawing
8.1 Introduction
The resilient modulus has become a mechanical property that is commonly used for pave￾ment evaluation and layout. As a result, determining the resilient modulus of pavement 
materials is critical for any mechanistically dependent pavement design and analysis 
method [1]. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) used to follow the guide￾lines described in the 1993 American Association of State Highway and Transportation 
Officials (AASHTO) imply for the Construction of Pavement Structures in designing com￾pact and rigid pavements. The effective value of the resilient modulus of the sub-base soil, 
which is a result of seasonal shifts, soil type, moisture content, and testing process, is one of 
the inputs to these procedures [2].
The resilient modulus principle was integrated into the AASHTO guide for Design of 
Pavement Structures (1993), among other modifications, to describe pavement materials, 
including subgrade, applied to moving traffic. The resilient modulus of a subgrade is pri￾marily determined by three variables: (a) loading conditions or stress state, (b) soil form 
and composition, and (c) soil physical properties. Laboratory testing and indirect asso￾ciation with other laboratory and field experiments or back calculation from deflection

measurements may all be used to approximate resilient modulus values. The technique 
for determination entails adding a repetitive deviator stressd
) while maintaining a steady 
cell pressure and calculating resilient axial tension [3–5]. The secant modulus improves 
as the number of load cycles increases, according to repeated load tests. The modulus is 
nearly constant after a number of load cycles and the reaction can be considered elastic. 
This steady value of modulus is defined as a resilient modulus. In recent years, the SHRP 
Protocol P46 (AASHTO T 294-92) and AASHTO 292-91I (1992, 1991) have been widely 
adopted. The first comprehensive resilient modulus prediction model had explanatory 
variables such as deviator tension and a few soil index properties. Drumm et al. (1990) 
developed a regression model for fine-grained soil modulus as a function of deviator stress 
and soil-index properties [6, 7]. However, the independent variables in the two regression 
models (Unconfined Compressive Strength, Plasticity Index, Dry Density, and percent finer 
#200) are likely to be correlated, resulting in possible multi collinearity issues.
Subgrade is an important layer in pavement design and construction since it must pro￾vide a stable foundation for the subsequent top layers. Furthermore, the consistency of 
this layer has a significant impact on pavement design. To prevent pavement damage, sub￾grade materials should be assessed for engineering properties such as strength and stiffness 
(stress-strain relationship under traffic loading) [7]. The dimensioning of a multi-layered 
structure, with layer thicknesses varying based on the subgrade loading capability, is the 
basis for flexible pavement design. The pavement structure’s short-term deformations are 
influenced by the resilient properties of the pavement components. Resilient modulus is 
used to determine the modulus of elasticity at a particular stress condition. As a result, one 
of the main material properties needed for the mechanistic-empirical (M-E) layout/study 
of multilayered flexible pavement systems is resilient modulus of sub grade soil. AASHTO 
suggests use of resilient modulus for pavement design instead of bearing capacity parame￾ters like CBR and SSV [8–10].
The physical state of the soil (i.e., water content and specific weight), stress intensity, 
and soil composition are all components that influence the resilient modulus of subgrade 
soils. The deviator and impounding pressure, soil pattern and form, soil range, densify￾ing process, sample size, and experimental strategy all affect the resilient modulus of soils 
[11]. According to research, the resilient modulus of subgrade soil declines as the moisture 
content or saturation level increases. The resilient modulus of unsaturated cohesive soils 
decreases as moisture content and pore pressure increase. The resilient modulus of the soil 
improves as the dry specific weight of the soil increases [12]. Anyhow, as opposed to the 
influence of water content and pressure amount on resilient modulus, this outcome is less. 
Due to the softening impact, a rise in deviator stress induces reduction in the resilient mod￾ulus of clay soils. Several models for predicting soil resilient modulus depend on physical 
features and pressure patterns of the soil. However, since these models are region-specific, 
they must be verified before they can be used to predict resilient modulus in local soils. 
There have only been a few reports on estimating resilient modulus values in stabilized 
soils [13]. The forecast prototype for resilient modulus in terms of UCS value (qu
) and back 
determined falling weight Deflectometer (FWD) modulus in terms of qu
 have been studied 
by many researchers [14–18].
Mamatha and Dinesh reported in most parts of India, due to disintegration of Deccan 
lava, black cotton soils are established. The black cotton soils are inorganic clays with more 
plasticity, more percentage of clay, less strength, more capacity to reduce in size, and a wide Studies on Design of Flexible Pavement Using Resilient Modulus: A Review 103
range of properties. Because of the high swell shrink behavior induced by moisture vari￾ations, these soils are unsuitable for foundations, subgrades, and other applications [19]. 
Many road surfaces, foundations, and channel gradients constructed on swelling soils have 
collapsed. Black cotton soils are formed over a wide geographic region and replacing them 
locally will be prohibitively expensive. As a result, such soils must be stabilized and resilient 
modulus values must be calculated in order to develop empirical correlations for resilient 
modulus value prediction in pavement design [20].
8.2 Resilient Modulus 
Resilient modulus (Mr
) is the main parameter for the design of flexible pavements. Resilient 
modulus has been used for many years in the design of pavements of the structures. Mainly, 
it is the ratio of applied deviator stress to recoverable or ‘resilient ’strain. It is used to char￾acterize pavement materials under loading conditions that will not show any type of failure 
of the pavement system. This parameter provides a given material an indication of elastic 
response. Actually, it is a key granular material characterization parameter.
8.3 Importance of Subgrade Resilient Modulus
Surface deflection is not disruptive to the pavement in and of itself. Deflection, on the other 
hand, is a sign of a problem. Fatigue cracking and rutting are the two most common forms 
of load-induced asphalt pavement collapse. The tensile strain that occurs in the base of 
the asphalt surface and the stress or strain applied to the top of the subgrade are the two 
primary structural parameters that contribute to failure. The influence of subgrade resil￾ient modulus on asphalt tensile strain and subgrade stress is shown in Figures 8.1 and 8.2. 
Thompson and Elliott created the ILLI-PAVE modeling algorithms, which were used to 
create these plots. When a 9,000-pound wheel load is applied to a traditional flexible pave￾ment with a three inch asphalt surface and a twelve inch aggregate base, these figures reflect 
the structural reaction. For other designs and loads, the results will be identical. Figure 8.1 
shows how the asphalt strain declines as the subgrade’s resilient modulus rises. The fatigue

life (load applications until cracking) of the asphalt’s surfacing is improved as the strain is 
reduced [21, 22]. 
Figure 8.2  illustrates how resilient modulus influences the subgrade stress ratio. The 
stress ratio is calculated by dividing the load-induced deviator stress on the subgrade by the 
soil›s unconfined compressive strength. Elliott and Thompson discovered a strong relation￾ship between subgrade stress and load applications prior to cracking when analyzing the 
efficiency of the AASHO Road Test pavements. As a consequence, the stress ratio was used 
as the design variable to prevent the subgrade from being overstressed. Figure 8.2 indicates 
that as the resilient modulus rises, the stress ratio declines, suggesting that the pavement 
life increases [21].
8.4 Effect On Pavement Design 
Based on the 1986 AASHTO Guidance, Figures 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 depict the influence of 
subgrade resilient modulus. The connection among resilient modulus and design traffic life

given resilient modulus are separated by a base value to measure relative traffic life. The base 
point for this diagram is the ESAL for a resilient modulus of 5 ksi.  For example, a pavement 
designed on a subgrade with a resilient modulus of 10 ksi can handle approximately 5 times 
the traffic that a pavement with a resilient modulus of 5 ksi can. Likewise, if the pavement 
is constructed on a soil with a resilient modulus of 2 ksi, it would be able to handle nearly 
8 times more traffic.
The connection among resilient modulus and design structural number shown in Figure 
8.4 is generated with a structural number of 5.0 and a resilient modulus of 5 ksi as the basis. 
On a subgrade with a resilient modulus of 2 ksi, a structural number of 6.6 will be required 
for the same traffic patterns. The needed structural number would be 4.0 if the resilient 
modulus was 10 ksi. The effects of resilient modulus on pavement volume are depicted in 
Figure 8.3. Figure 8.4’s structural numbers are converted to full-depth asphalt thickness 
equivalents. The conversion was done using 0.44 and 0.30 structural layer coefficients for 
the asphalt  surface and bituminous surface, estimating that the base thickness will be 3 
times the surfacing thickness. For resilient moduli of 2, 5, and 10 ksi, the full depth thick￾ness will vary between 20 to 15 to 12 inches in this case. In realistic terms, Figures 8.4 and 
8.5 show that a 30 % defect in the resilient modulus would result in a gross asphalt thickness 
selection error of 1 to 1.5 inches [21]. 10 Structural Number 8 6 4 2 0

8.5 Seasonal Variations 
Unfortunately, there is no straightforward method for determining a soil’s durable modu￾lus. The subgrade resilient modulus, in fact, is not really a single, fixed value. Rather, over 
the life of the pavement, the resilient modulus varies due to a variety of factors [23, 24]. The 
resilient modulus of a soil is influenced by a number of factors. Moisture content, stress 
levels, and freeze-thaw periods are among them. The effects of stress and moisture content 
on normal cohesive soils are seen in Figure 8.6. The impact of these causes on the seasonal 
variation of the subgrade is of special interest to the pavement engineer. Since roadbeds are 
harder in the spring in most parts of the world than they are at other times of the year, sea￾sonal variation is to be anticipated. The seasonal variation in pavement surface deflections 
illustrates this [21]. Seasonal difference is, however, more prominent in some soils than in 
others. 
8.6 Changes in Water Content Have an Effect on Resilient Modulus
The water content of subgrades has been observed to fluctuate over time after construction. 
In most cases, the subgrade is compressed to a saturation level of 75 to 85 percent initially 
and then the soil absorbs water to increase the saturation level to 90 to 95 percent after a 
period of time. As a consequence, the resilient modulus of in-service subgrade will differ 
remarkably from that of as-compacted subgrade. Some researchers noted that after soaking 
specimens to a high degree of saturation and conducting repeated-loading triaxial exper￾iments on them, the resilient strains of sample compacted on the dried face of maximum 
rose dramatically [25]. The resilient strains of specimens compacted to the finishing condi￾tion were much less than these.
Seed et al. (1962) and Monismith et al. (1967) took an unfamiliar view with the presump￾tion that the specimen compacted wet of maximum since it takes time and effort to prepare

a sample by compaction to allow it to achieve the optimum saturation degree [26, 27].The 
results taken by kneading compaction have the same durable characteristics to static com￾paction. Extrapolating the verdicts to specimens prepared by static compaction, it was clear 
that the sample compacted to 96% relative compaction and the sample that was five times 
the resilient strain of that sample compacted to 100% relative compaction, both of which 
were soaked to same degree of saturation [28]. This specifies the value of maximum density 
in reducing resilient deformation.
8.7 Perspective on Resilient Modulus 
The resilient modulus of a material is an essential and logical material property that must 
be considered during the pavement planning process. The durable modulus, on the other 
hand, does not account for all of the characteristics of a subgrade or granular surface that 
can influence a pavement’s performance.
The AASHO Road Test provides the clearest evidence that other properties are import￾ant. Crushed stone and gravel were used as granular materials. The gravel surface sections 
deflected the least. The gravel was more effective in minimizing deflections inch for inch. 
This means that the gravel had a higher resilient modulus than the sand. Nonetheless, the 
crushed stone sections outperformed the others. “Perhaps the gravel possessed less internal 
resilience than the stone; but it might have been much less resilient (i.e., higher resilient 
modulus),” according to the Road Test study. Similarly, density has only a slight influence 
on a granular material’s resilient modulus [21]. This may lead to the inference that density 
is unimportant. Density, on the other hand, is very important in terms of permanent defor￾mation (strain).
The resilient modulus of a material only represents its recovery or resilient deformation 
behavior. Resilient modulus is critical and relevant when it comes to load-induced stresses, 
strains, and deflections. The resilient modulus, on the other hand, is not a good predic￾tor of rutting potential. The permanent deformation (rutting) action of many materials 
could well be the determining factor in pavement existence. As a result, resilient modulus 
should not be the only property taken into account in the design and selection of materials 
for a flexible pavement; layer coefficients based exclusively on resilient modulus can be 
misleading.
8.8 Conclusion
This chapter shows that resilient modulus is a significant material property in the AASTHO 
design process of flexible pavements. Further, it doesn’t represent all the properties of a 
subgrade or granular layer that can affect the performance of the pavement. It gives the load 
induced stress-strain relationship of the soil. The selected granular materials and assign￾ment of layered system coefficients solely based on resilient modulus can be evasive. Again, 
it is complicated to use single resilient modulus for soils. It is very nebulous to estimate the 
seasonal moisture variations and testing time is very time consuming. However, CBR test 
values are used to predict resilient modulus. 108 Optimization of Industrial Systems

Study on Design of Top Shackle used in Cage 
Suspension Gear in Mines – FEA Approach
Shivam Jaiswal
Department of Design, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India
Abstract 
Shackles are used in coupling devices in different applications such as tractor trollies, oil exploration, 
railways, and mining. They are used to assemble cages/skips with mine cage suspension gear (CSG) 
through links/chains to transport man, material, and machines. This paper presents the design ver￾ification and crack distribution of top shackles at various statically load combinations found during 
quality assessment followed by FEA analysis. This paper also deals with the behavior of von Mises 
(equivalent) stress, von Mises (equivalent) strain, safety factors, and damages (cracks) developed for 
top shackles under static load. This study shows that it satisfies Directorate General of Mines Safety 
(DGMS) norms for the design of top shackles used in cage suspension gear.
Keywords: Cage shackle, cage suspension gear, finite element analysis, crack propagation, 
factor of safety
9.1 Introduction
In mining, safety has been improved continuously over the years. However, still, recent 
industrial accidents and disasters in several opencast as well as underground coal mines 
worldwide have made legislators, mine owners, researchers, and manufacturers revisit the 
inherent dangers in the mining industry and their collective role in making the workplace 
safer for the workers, as well as from the asset viewpoint. Cage Suspension Gear (CSG) 
are used for connection between the cage/skip and winding rope in the mine hoisting sys￾tem to lift, or undercarriage in underground coal mining, safely. It comprises of various 
components, including a rope cappel (friction wedge rope cappel or white metal rope cap￾pel), safety hook, distribution plate, shackles, bridle chains, chase block, and link plates, as 
shown in Figure 9.1 (Cage Suspension Gear for Winding in Mines , 2020). 
For safety activities in mines, it is necessary to maintain a fixed safety factor 10 of CSG 
components. Industries for mining should be under an accepted procedure from their qual￾ity assessment starting from manufacturing until installing the components. Among CSG 
components, the shackle is the most critical component. This study says that more of the

shackles are vulnerable surface or sub-surface flaws and, after inspection, the faulty com￾ponents must be discarded. Figure 9.2 shows a detailed diagram of the critical zones of a 
shackle. There are two zones in the shackle that are considered critical: the upper and bot￾tom parts. The shackle is divided into two portions, shaded and unshaded. The stress con￾centration value depends on the geometry of the shackle and it varies through the geometry. 
Observations say that the stress concentration factor should be more in the shaded zone, 
unlike in the unshaded zone. The cracks can be either longitudinal or transverse.

Table 9.1 shows the permissible limit of cracks, both longitudinal and transverse, for a 
shackle as per different Norms and the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS). These 
circular states mitigate the refusal of a shackle by spreading the limits for the shackles. 
The mining of minerals is a profitable business, which requires heavy machinery and 
technology to make the work easier. Hence, their qualities need to be checked to prevent 
any fatal consequences. Mainly, it deals with two types of component flaws: manufacturing 
defects and service defects. These increase during the service life and fail. Thus, it becomes 
necessary to analyze these components before putting them to work. There are several meth￾ods to analyze components like NDT, Numerical Modelling, and FEA. This study provides 
information regarding identifying and quantifying the surface imperfection and quality 
assessment of internal defects using FEA methods. In this paper, 3-dimensional Computer￾Aided Design modelling and Finite Element Analysis were performed to verify the design 
as per DGMS norms and developed stresses and strains under various static conditions and 
their factor of safety and damages due to overload. This paper says that when three times of 
safe working load, i.e., the proof load is applied to a shackle, it satisfies the DGMS norms, 
i.e., the shackle does not start developing cracks under the specified proof load.
9.2 Research Background
In the last section, the essential aspects of shackles were discussed. In the present section, 
a considerable literature review will be presented. This literature mainly concentrated on 
CSG, shackles, bridle chains, Engineering Failure Analysis, and FEA and are highlighted 
in this section by mentioning various papers. Xiang-dong Chang et al., in the year 2018, 
studied hoist ropes with different wear scars, which were examined for break tensile tests 
to show the failure characteristics. They have used the finite element method to simulate 
the various mechanical properties for the wear out strands subjected to tensile load (Xiang￾dong, et al., 2018). Debashis Ghosh et al., in the year 2015, studied the expected causes of 
in-service failure of the CSG chain used for mining. This paper also evaluated the stress 
generated along the chain periphery and detailed analysis of stress. Finally, it has been seen 
that because of improper welding parameters or procedures, the presence of severe weld￾ing defects caused the failure of the end links of the investigated chain link (Ghosh, Dutta,

Shukla, & Roy, 2015). In this area, there are many things to be examined by researchers and 
shackle analysis in more places is to be done. This paper deals with the top shackle’s study 
used in cage suspension gear to transport man and/or material in mines.
9.3 Research Methods
Materials are used to test for one or more reasons:
1. Numerically examine fundamental mechanical properties such as toughness, 
malleability, and ductility
2. Chemical composition of the materials used in the components 
3. For various applications to determine the comfortability of the materials
4. Design the features and calculation of stress, strain, etc., upon different load 
conditions 
5. For reducing the surface or subsurface and internal flaws in raw materials or 
processed parts
In this study, 3-dimensional Computer Aided Design modelling and Finite Element 
Analysis simulation of the shackle which is used in CSG (CE, 1993) (CD, 2000) is utilized. 
For 3D modelling, CATIA (Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application) 
(SS, 2004) software has been used and for analysis, ANSYS (HJ, 2001) academic finite ele￾ment analysis software is used. 
9.3.1 Designing and Selection of Shackle for Cage Suspension Gear
In the Indian Standard (Part 3) - First Revision (CAGE SUSPENSION GEAR FOR 
WINDING IN MINES - SPECIFICATION, 2017) has been accepted by the Bureau of Indian 
Standards. The document has been finalized by the Mining Techniques and Equipment 
Sectional Committee of the Mechanical Engineering Division Council. This standard was 
first published in 1980. For the execution of this definition, experience has been gained and 
required this revision. Now, 50 KN, 80 KN, 100 KN, and 120 KN capacity shackles can be 
used for 150 KN and 200 KN capacity suspension gear. Therefore, in this revised observa￾tion, shackles are used of a safe working load of 50KN, 80KN, 100KN, and 120 KN, earlier 
used of 10KN, 30KN, and 150 KN load capacity. With the help of a shackle and pin, all 
the components of the cage suspension gear were attached. This shackle and pin cover the 
entire standard required to connect the cage hangers, bridle chains, and equalizing plates.
9.3.1.1 Types of Shackles and Dimensions 
The following types of shackles can be used at different places: 
• Top Shackle: Connects upper safety hook to the distribution plate
• Bottom Shackle: Connects upper ends of bridle chains to lower end of distri￾bution plate
• Cage Shackle: Connects cage hangers to lower ends of bridle chainsStudy on Design of Top Shackle used in CSG in Mines – FEA Approach 115
The diagram and dimensions of the top shackle are given in Figure 9.3 and Table 9.2. 
Similarly, for pin and nut, the diagram and dimensions are given in Figure 9.4 and Table 9.3.
9.3.1.2 Materials 
As per Indian Standard 7587 – Part 1 (Cage Suspension Gear for Winding in Mines , 2020), 
materials for the manufacturing of shackles and pins:
• The steel used for the manufacture of components (e.g., shackle), which is used 
in cage suspension gear, can be produced by acid–base open-hearth process, 
acid-base electric, or acid-converter process. It should not be more than 0.5 
percent of Sulphur and Phosphorus and both should be less than 0.09 percent.
• Components of CSG shall be manufactured from any one of the following 
types of steels:
a) Steel conforming to 20Cl of IS 5517 and
b) Steel conforming to 20Ni2Cr2MO2 of IS 4432, having chemical composi￾tion given in Table 9.4
9.4 Finite Element Analysis
In Finite Element Analysis, steps may vary based on the problems and the method used 
for the solution. In FEM general steps remain the same during analysis. In the solution, the 
first step is that it must consider how to define the problem in detail with available infor￾mation or data. A mathematical model will be developed based on the available data or 
the information given to us and define the geometry of the model, material properties and 
governing equations, boundary, and initial conditions. The general steps for the solution of 
the given problem using FEM are given in Figure 9.5 (Desai, Eldho, & Shah, 2011). For the

9.5 Analysis and Result 
According to DGMS norms (Cage Suspension Gear for Winding in Mines , 2020), the SWL 
of a top shackle is 50KN. In this analysis, a 50KN load is applied to the shackle and then the 
load is gradually increased. A load of 150KN is known as the proof load of a top shackle. 
When the load applied is greater than the proof load, then the shackle starts damaging. For 
this purpose, as per DGMS norms, material properties are applied to the model or CAD file 
in ‘.igs’ format of the top shackle. After inputting all material (physical) properties, meshing 
has been done and boundary conditions applied, then results can be seen. These are the 
steps followed in Ansys R19.1, as shown in Figure 9.10. All the stresses, strains, safety fac￾tors, and damage can be seen in Figures 9.11 through 9.17. The relationship between safety 
factors and time as shown in Figure 9.18.

9.6 Conclusion
This paper dealt with the behavior of von Misses (equivalent) stress, von Misses (equivalent) 
strain, safety factors, and damages (cracks) developed on top shackles under static load. A 
non-destructive evaluation is necessary on top shackles before placing them in service in a 
mine to prevent equipment failure within the prescribed time. This study observed that it 
satisfied DGMS circular conditions for designing top shackles used in cage suspension gear. 
In this study, the author has observed that finally, at a load of 3350KN, the shackle’s safety 
factor reaches less than one, which is acceptable.

Abstract 
The contemporary world is continuously developing carbon-neutral green and clean energy technol￾ogy. Hence, renewable wind power systems are progressively gaining the attention of manhood. To 
harness more wind potential from the offshore sector, the government of India is now focusing its 
attention on the installation of an offshore wind turbine. Offshore wind turbine installation in India 
is in progress. The critical and proper design of offshore wind turbines and wind farms depends on 
the accomplishments of the exterior conditions in which the turbines and affiliate facilities are to 
operate. This study contains an overall review in the offshore wind energy sector comprising of the 
following aspects: modeling and simulation of the offshore wind turbine, dynamic response and 
analysis of deep offshore wind turbines, damping and fragility estimations of wind turbine support 
structures, optimizing the NW offshore wind turbine design, multi-criteria assessment in offshore 
wind structure, reliability analysis of offshore wind turbines, cost assessment, and new methods of 
installing monopole foundations offshore.

10.1 Introduction
The world today is continuously being attracted to a carbon neutral renewable and clean 
energy system. Hence, renewable energy systems are progressively receiving the attention 
of mankind. There are many sources of renewable energy, including wave, tidal, photovol￾taic, wind, off-shore wind, etc. The focus of this study is on off-shore wind energy genera￾tion. The design of an offshore industry-based wind farm is always the key issue to harness 
more wind potential for generating power. The key factors which affect the performance of 
wind turbines are wind, wave, current, and water depth and soil characteristics. There is a 
great potential to harness wind energy under offshore conditions, but the most challenging 
task is to locate a tower in these areas. In addition to onshore tower wind turbines located in 
the ocean, offshore wind turbines have emerged as an efficient source of renewable energy.

In comparison to land based wind turbines, offshore turbines have much more wind veloc￾ity without having noise problems. Thus, offshore turbines have the potential to produce 
more energy in a more efficient manner. Since the investigation of offshore wind turbines 
in Europe began in the early 1980’s, the design of offshore wind turbines is a relatively new 
technology for India. condition near offshore area such as Chennai etc. In Comparison to 
land based wind turbines, there are several factors that need to be investigated when select￾ing a suitable site for the offshore turbine. The following characteristics are:
1. Distance from the offshore site 
2. Nearness to power companies and airport facility
3. Nearness to telecom communication services
4. Wildlife factor
5. Oil pipeline factor under sea 
6. Shipping factor
Besides the load exerted on an offshore turbine’s platform support structure, waves are 
also another important factor to analyze the utility and economic viability of offshore proj￾ects by vessels during construction, operations, and maintenance. Desired wave data are 
the following:
1. Average wave altitude 
2. Highest wave altitude 
3. Maximum observed wave altitude
4. Wave frequency and its spectrum 
5. Correlation between wind speeds and direction
Offshore wind has been the utmost attention of researchers and industries, but it has 
always been a problem for levelized cost of energy. The global wind atlas has been created to 
obtain a wide view of data on the world map, as shown in Figure 10.1. This shows the global 
wind power density all over the world. We can see from the figure that the North Atlantic

has the greatest potential followed by Canada, Russia, South Latin America, South Africa, 
China, and India.
Wind speed in the northern and southern hemispheres have the greatest wind speed at 
100m of height, as shown in Figure 10.2. It can be seen that the Indian coast also has 7 m/s 
to 10 m/s of wind speed, which indicates offshore wind’s potential availability across the 
country.
10.2 Modelling and Simulation
Erin E. Bachynski (2012) simulated the structure response of TLPWTs (Tension Leg 
Platform Wind Turbines) by means of Simo, Aerodyn, and Riflex tools and evaluated the 
platform movements and structural loads on the components of the turbine. They found 
that TLPWTs have been more reliant on fluctuations of stiffness and natural periods. The 
result indicates that the natural period of surge needed to be adequately long (>45s) to 
lessen surge movements, but there is an upper boundary limit (<70s) to see optimized per￾formance in working conditions. Enzo Marino et al. (2011) gave a different mathematical 
model to simulate offshore wind turbines particularly for extreme loadings. The numerical 
result of the solver was shown in two different states. In Table 10.1, U19.5 shows the wind

speed at 19.5 m above the sea level, Tsim is the total time to complete simulation, and xmin
and xmax are the coordinates of lower and upper limits of the domain D(p,t) to initialize 
simulation over the sea.
Shane Colwell (2008) developed and simulated a mathematical model to measure the 
dynamic reactions of the offshore wind turbine configuration by incorporating a Tuned 
Liquid Column Damper (TLCD) to govern the modulations generated inside the assembly. 
It was found that when wind and water wave loadings were applied to the wind energy 
turbine structure, the extreme response of the assembly consequently reduced by 55% and 
also reduced the steel work and expenses on the tower structure. By implementing TLCD, 
fatigue life of the tower was also improved. The wave modulations shown in Figure 10.3 give 
an idea of loading to offshore structures.
Jiankang simulated the foundation model while considering the effect of fatigue load￾ings. The model is simulated by the combination of wind and wave loading and loads are 
determined by BEM and the Morison equation, respectively. The results indicated that:
1. Long term effect of wind and wave loadings are more responsible to fatigue 
up to 20 years of design life
2. The fatigue loads are higher in prevailing direction
3. Sea water increases the effect of shear force on the turbine foundation 
Y.H. Bae developed numerical model software for rotor floater tether fully coupled 
dynamics. They considered the effects of double ordered sum occurrence on the dynamics 
for the mono column TLP with a 5MW turbine below 200m at the water level. They plotted 
the graph of time and spectra of the floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) motions for the 
collinear wind wave condition. 
10.3 Dynamic Response and Dynamic Analysis
S.H. Jeon (2013) carried out dynamic analysis on spar types of offshore floating wind tur￾bines regarding irregular wind speed and waves. They worked on the dynamic stability of 
the structure in terms of three translational (Heave, Surge, and Sway) and three rotational

motions (Yaw, Pitch, and Roll), as shown in Figure 10.4, resulting in the coupling of these 
motions together and providing the stability criteria by the surge and pitching motion. 
Finally, they found that the peak amplitudes in surge and pitch motions generally decrease 
as total length of the cable increases.
Marit I. Kvittem (2012) inspected the dynamic reactions of the single-semi submersible 
wind turbine (SSWT) under various hydrodynamic loading. Finally, the results showed 
that by proper selection of coefficient it is possible to obtain the same response amplitude 
in regular waves for a period about 7s for a period below 7s and diffraction effects pre￾dominate for the heave motions. Puyang Zhang (2011) tested the offshore wind tower of 
78m height with 4.4m base diameter and 2.7m top diameter (steel as a material) at Qidong 
City of Jiangsu Province by installing accelerator measuring instruments, charge amplifiers, 
and data accumulation instruments at five places to measure the dynamic reactions of the 
hydro-tower. Finally, they found the natural frequency of the tower is 0.3-0.4 Hz.
10.4 Damping and Fragility Estimations
R. Shirzadeh (2013) estimated damping with experimental and computational methods 
for a Monopile foundation using OMA (operational model analysis) and considering the 
effects of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and soil loading. They measured in the Belgian 
North Sea and compared the result with the simulation results. The damping value was 
found to be 1.05 % and 1.27 % for the first and first side-to-side modes, respectively. They 
listed the comparison results in Table 10.2 in the following manner 
Puneet Agarwal et al. (2011) inspected the influence of non-linear and linear wave 
models on the efficacy scale at a 5 MW rated offshore wind energy turbine with a depth 
of water 20 m, assuming the monopile structure (6 m dia.). The result indicates that the 
non-linear waves cause the higher loads compared to linear waves experienced by the 
turbine structure.

10.5 Optimizing the New Offshore Wind Turbine Design
B. Genturk and A. Attar (2012) optimized the tower design of lattice wind turbines to save 
the material and material cost applied to wind and earthquake conditions. After applying 
an FEM model and an optimizing algorithm, the following were obtained:
Initial weight of the tower = 111.5 KN
After TS weight of the tower = 86.3 KN
K. Faley (2010) presented a different dynamic model of offshore wind energy turbines 
imposed to ice and tide loading under extreme loading conditions and designed a new 
torque controller to diminish mechanical fatigue by examining the frequency and model 
uncertainty. The tide varied from -5 to +5 m and wind varied from 12 m/s to 17 m/s. Ice 
was considered as thin or thick sheets (<>0.15 m). The nominal torque was found to be 
12733 N-m and a rotor speed of about 1.885 rad/s. G. Betti developed the simplified math￾ematical model for an offshore wind energy turbine with a spar buoy platform using an H00
controlling method. Finally, the model was compared with the reference model. They get 
results as listed in Table 10.3.

10.6 Reliability Studies of Offshore Wind Turbines
Sandeep Bala (2011) discussed the approach to enhance the reliability and maintainability 
of the offshore wind turbine control system. They used ABB’s PCS6000 to discuss com￾ponent level issues. Finally, they concluded that operation and maintenance costs can be 
reduced during the initial stage of design. By proper selection of electrical architectures, the 
failure of the component can be reduced. Halil Karadeniz (2009) gave a RBDO (Reliability 
Based Optimization Approach) for an offshore wind tower implemented on a tripod struc￾ture consisting of tubular members subjected to extreme wind loadings. The results were 
obtained as shown in Table 10.4. 
10.7 Cost Assessment
Bob van der Zwaan (2012) gave an overview of cost reduction technique in the offshore 
energy sector. They took out the effect of cost increase due to increasing the distance 
from the seacoast, as well as increased the water’s depth. Jan Weinzettel (2008) com￾pared the life cycle assessment of a floating wind energy turbine with non-floating wind 
turbine. The result indicates that the environmental impact of electricity production 
does not differ so much in conventional offshore wind plants. Myung Eun Lee (2013) 
assessed a potential offshore wind site at Young Wang 1270
 07’45.30’’ E and 350
27’55.17 
N’’ in Korea and collected wind data by installing an offshore metrological tower called 
HEMOSU-1.
The result indicates: 
1. The yearly average wind velocity for the site is 7.122 m/s at a height of 97.35 m
2. The observed wind power density at 97.35m is 429.20 w/m2
 annually and 
509.97 w/m2
 during winter.

Adesoji Adelaja (2012) developed a method for preliminary offshore wind resource 
assessment conducted in Michigan. The result indicates that the there is more offshore wind 
potential in Michigan, compared to onshore wind potential, 16,560 MW as estimated by the 
NREL. C. Szafron (2009) was given the optimized layout of an offshore wind farm in terms 
of cost function, considering wake effect, turbine spacing, etc. Finally, the result indicates 
that turbine wake effect has a greater influence on wind turbine displacement. The best 
power output layout is not the best fitness function. A. Rashedi et.al (2013) studied LCIA 
(Life Cycle Impact Analysis) of three wind farms consisting of an onshore horizontal, off￾shore horizontal, and another vertical axis. The result indicates that an offshore wind farm 
has a higher impact value compared to onshore and VAWT (onshore) performance is the 
best compared to all wind farms.
10.8 Methods of Installing Monopole Foundations Offshore
The following is an installation sequence of a wind turbine offshore, as shown in below

result shows (Figure 10.6) that an underwater support structure provides a broader climate 
space compared to the prevailing methods for installation which are limited to HS 1.5 m.
Ki-Yong Oh (2012) gave the foundation design of a monopile-like support structure 
near the island of Wi-do in the Yellow Sea, considering the effects of aerodynamic and 
hydrodynamic loadings on the turbine structure and obtained the optimized result of the 
tower as 257 MPa maximum stress at the contact point where the maximum bending 
moment occurs while the ultimate strength of the iron is 400 MPa with a safety factor of 
1.56 or above. Lijuan Dai (2012) investigated the risk assessment of the vessel and offshore 
wind turbine in remote locations where deeper water requires larger service vessels. In 
the numerical simulation analysis, a 230-ton service vessel and an OWT with a monopile 
structure is selected and the results were plotted in terms of critical force and energy. 
E. Lozano-Minguez (2011) gave the multi-criteria decision making method TOPSIS 
(Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution) for the selection of three 
alternative foundation structures (Monopile, Jacket, and Tripod) using a 5MW wind tur￾bine with a 40m water depth below the sea level on the basis of engineering, environ￾mental, and economical attributes. They concluded that the tripod foundation is the best 
option overall. S. Bhattacharya (2013) tested an NREL wind turbine model on monopoles, 
a symmetric tetra-pod, and asymmetric tripod foundations with scaled ratio (1:100,1:150 
and 1:200). The result is summarized as:
(i) Multi-pod foundation consisted of two packed natural time periods 
(ii) The closely packed spectral peaks for multi-pod foundations shifted with 
the interaction of soil.
(iii) The response of a symmetric tetra-pod and an asymmetric tripod were 
completely different 
Amardeep Dhanju et al. (2008) gave the methodology to access offshore wind potential 
in Delaware, United States. The methodology includes a calculation of water sheet area and 
power production, extrapolation of existing wind data to turbine height, along with the 
power output curve based on an hourly basis. The results indicate that Delaware varied by 
17% between the two methods. Revenue computed from the method yielding the smaller 
wind resource was over 2 billion dollars/year.

10.9 Climate Change Influence on Design of Offshore Wind Farm 
in Indian Offshore Wind Energy Sector
R. Deepthi (2010) showed the meteorological variation influences on the estimated design’s 
wind speed corresponding to Indian offshore sites. First, the designed wind speed was used 
to determine through wave rider buoy observations at two different offshore sites in the 
country. After that, forthcoming wind speeds were virtually analyzed at the given locations 
using an input from a global climate model corresponding to the worst scenario. Dr. M.V. 
Ramana Murthy (2013) in their feasibility study on two offshore sites in Gujarat and Tamil￾Nadu performed an offshore wind resource assessment which is shown in below Figure 
10.7. The map shows the wind speed at more than 6 m/s and 8 m/s in Figures 10.7a and 
10.7b, respectively. 
The maps are printed monthly for wind power density (W/m2
). It can be interpreted that 
the months of May, June, July, and August have more wind power potential compared to 
other months. January, February, March, and April have least wind power density as per 
Figure 10.7c, as shown below.

Their study was carried out for 10 years ranging from 18-07-1999 of 17-11-2009 at 10m 
above sea level and magnified to 80m using 5 moored buoys.
10.10 Conclusions
After a complete study of offshore wind energy and related topics, it was found to have 
some advantages over onshore wind energy. In the first view, the homogeneous terrain off￾shore gives a more predictable wind production than onshore sites. The surface roughness 
of onshore sites lags in efficient flow of wind to produce power, where offshore roughness 
gives specific advantages. The wind speed is of the utmost priority where offshore sites have 
unambiguous high wind speed because there is no obstacle in the wind path. Apart from 
this, the wind nature is stable in offshore regions which helps industries for better control 
and monitoring systems. The coastal areas are most economically benefitted with the addi￾tion of clean energy and reduction in transmission losses, which improves India’s promise 
towards climate change. 
India has a 7516 km coastal length along three directions, which indicates the richness 
of offshore potential in the country. India’s renewable government body, the Ministry of 
New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), has one specific wind dedicated institute named the 
National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) in Chennai. The NIWE is also developing many 
offshore projects and offshore wind resource assessment programs across the coastal length 
of India. Many remote sensing and modern techniques are being used to validate tradition￾ally used anemometers and wind vanes to measure the wind data at higher heights. The 
Lidar is placed to the Gujarat offshore region in the Gulf of Khambhat and readings are 
taken for two years. One met mast is also installed in Jafrabad, Gujarat. The off-shore wind 
farm has been commercialized for energy production in more than 28 countries and both 
the developed and the developing world are enjoying its benefits. In order to increase the 
lifetime of an offshore wind turbine, it is required to measure the correct value of the eigen 
frequency and damping values.

Abstract 
Currently, as per the draft issued in May 2020 by the Government of India, Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energy Resources on the issue to generate 1GW power from offshore technology and 
to explore the wind design data for the tower, we investigated the Paradeep site near Odisha and 
collected some wind data for design purposes. In this paper, the main consideration is given to the 
exploration of the tower design criteria at the offshore condition and also seeks the effect of wind 
speeds, wind veer, wind shear, turbulence, tides, ocean currents, lightning, fatigue, etc. on the tow￾ers, which are currently the major issues for the Indian conditions (like Chennai) to measure wind 
data at particular heights. Also, this paper seeks to calculate the design wind data up to 150m height 
which would produce more power output and would fill the gap of electricity in power deficient 
states of India, like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, etc.
Keywords: Offshore wind resource assessment, gust, lightning, offshore design, wind shear, 
wind veer
11.1 Introduction
As per the draft issued by the Government of India, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy 
Resources, in order to harness more wind power from the offshore technology along the 
coastline of Kerala, Goa, and Karnataka, it has been found from the wind data collection 
that there is great wind potential for the coastline of Rameshwaram and Kanyakumari in 
Tamil Nadu and on the Gujrat Coast. They want to incorporate a 1GW capacity wind farm 
each along the coastline of Rameshwaram and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu.
There are many different offshore wind turbine towers varying from coastal area to 
deep water. These towers and support structures can be categorized as (Figure 11.1) land 
based, shallow water, transitional water, and deep water. Land based towers are like onshore 
wind turbine tubular towers and in shallow water, a spur type of tower foundation is used. 
Transitional water depth ranges between 30m to 60m below sea level, where tubular and lat￾tice hybrid towers are used. Deep water depth is more than 60m under sea level and floating 
wind turbines towers are used.

11.2 Literature Review
The design for offshore wind conditions is taken from the offshore wind technology over￾view for Long Island, New York City, in which we have considered the different factors 
related to design parameters [1]. The hydrodynamic loading conditions are considered from 
the document of wind turbine design and implementation of the Worcester Polytechnic 
Institute and IS:875 code to calculate the design wind speed up to 150m height and it can 
be further extended to more than 150m height also [2, 5]. 
Blaise Sheridan et al. (9th January 2012) calculated the offshore wind potential at the U.S. 
Atlantic Coast by wind speed data. The result indicates that Maryland’s feasible offshore 
wind resources have a large potential to harness wind energy using monopile foundations 
in shallow waters. Maryland’s offshore wind resource indicates 70% of electricity produc￾tion capacity of the state’s electricity [2].
Hua Zhang et al. (18th July 2013) compared the results of Weibull distribution and max￾imum entropy distribution of the offshore area related to wind speed. The result indicates 
that the maximum entropy distribution fits accurately in the wind speed distribution with 
the height and mean error from Weibull distribution and maximum entropy distribution 
are 7.48 w/m2
 and 1.71 w/m2
, respectively [3].
Paradeep is situated at a confluence of the Mahanadi River and the Bay of Bengal 
(Reference Wind Turbine for Offshore System Development). J.F.Manwell et al. (18th 
January 2005) reviewed the design conditions of offshore wind turbines in the U.S subjected 
to following aspects: 
1. Design requirements 
2. Offshore data resources 
3. Data estimation and extrapolation techniques 
4. Effects of hurricanes and north-east storms [4, 5]
Jan Weinzettel et al. (20th June 2008) compared the life cycle assessment of floating 
wind turbines with non-floating wind turbines. The result indicates that that environmen￾tal impact of electricity production does not differ so much in conventional offshore wind

plants [6]. Mark J.Kaiser et al. (4th May 2011) highlighted the decommissioning regulations 
for offshore turbines in the outer continental shelf of the United States. They targeted the 
expected workflow and decommissioning stages that arise for offshore wind farms [7]. 
After investigation, wind data is obtained from the site of Paradeep Port, located at (20°15 
55.44 n 86°40 34.62 e) in the Jagatsinghpur District of Odisha, India. Puyang Zhang et al.
(2011) tested an offshore wind tower of 78 m height with a 4.4m base diameter and 2.7m 
top diameter (steel as a material) at Qidong City of Jiangsu Province by installing acceler￾ometers, charge amplifiers, and data acquisition instruments at five places to measure the 
dynamic response of the tower. Finally, they found the natural frequency of the tower is 
0.3-0.4 Hz [8]. S. Colwell et al. gave the parameter related to a 5MW offshore wind turbine 
tower. Ratings considered for the baseline ranged from 5 MW to 20 MW. Shane Colwell 
et al. (2008) gave the TLCD (Tuned Liquid Column Dampers) in offshore wind turbines 
for structure control [9]. Many researchers have been focused on assessing offshore wind 
resources in order to design the tower and foundation as per loading conditions [10-15]. 
Hydrodynamic loadings are applied and study the behavior of different wind turbine sup￾port structures using experimental and simulation modeling [16]. India is also in the race 
for offshore wind energy production because of rich coastal regions [17].
11.3 Offshore Tower Design Condition
There is a great potential to harness wind energy at offshore conditions, but it is the most 
challenging task to locate towers in these areas. Besides the onshore tower wind turbines 
located in the ocean, offshore wind turbines have emerged as an efficient source of renewable 
energy. In comparison to land based wind turbines, offshore turbines have much more wind 
velocity without having noise problems. Thus, offshore turbines have the potential to produce 
more energy in a more efficient manner. Since the investigation of offshore wind turbines in 
Europe began in the early 1980’s, the design of offshore wind turbines is a relatively new tech￾nology for Indian conditions near offshore areas such as Chennai, etc. In comparison to land 
based wind turbines, there are several factors which need to be investigated while selecting a 
suitable site for the offshore turbine. The following characteristics being considered are:
1. Distance from the offshore site
2. Nearness to power companies and airport facility
3. Nearness to telecom communication services
4. Wildlife factor
5. Oil pipeline factor under sea
6. Shipping factor
Besides the load imposed on a turbine’s support structure, waves are also another import￾ant factor (Figure 11.2) to analyze the accessibility of offshore projects by vessels during 
construction and operation. Desired wave data are the following:
1. Average wave height
2. Highest wave height
3. Maximum observed wave height140 Optimization of Industrial Systems
4. Wave frequency and its spectrum
5. Correlation with wind speeds and direction
Paradeep is a place in Odisha state of India. It has a long cost over the area which receives 
wind energy that can be harnessed, as shown in Figure 11.3.
11.4 Methodology
The offshore tower design was based on methods used for land based turbine design and 
included additional loads due to the effects of waves. The portion of the tower that remains 
above the sea level is designed with the same axial and lateral loads as a land-based turbine.

observed at about 4.5 feet that impacts the turbine tower. It also indicates the surface wave

Figure 11.4 Mean wind speed and mean wave height on same time scale.Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy for Site 143
11.6 Results
Each tower is divided into 15 numbers of sections with intervals of 10m at each height, while 
maintaining the basic wind speed constant and the factors are calculated as per the design 
codes. The following, Table 11.1, is prepared. It is observed from the figure that the wind veloc￾ity increases with height as we go above sea level. Different terrains produce different designs 
of wind speed, but Terrain 1 produces maximum design wind speed, causing the extreme 
bending moment at the critical part of the tower, which is the bottom portion of the tower.
Based on above table, graphs (Figure 11.4) are plotted between design wind speed and 
height (m) for all types of 4 terrains (Figures 11.5a-d). 
Due to peak bending, stress occurs on the lowermost part of the tower, hence this section 
of modulus of the tower should be maximized to decrease the bending stress value. Since 
maximum bending stress arises at the outer part of the tower, this causes an effective uti￾lization of material by making the tower hollow. 150m or higher towers produce a risk of 
buckling also. Instead of installing tubular steel at the Paradeep port, a full lattice tower also 
produces the favorable conditions in terms of effective utilization of material. Figure 11.6 
produced the hydrodynamic loading results where the load on the y axis indicates in N and 
the x axis indicates the submerged water level depth in m.

Figure 11.6 Mean wind speed extrapolation over different heights.Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy for Site 145
11.7 Discussion
It is clear from the above, Figure 11.5, that the highest design wind speed was obtained for 
Terrain 1, which would produce extreme bending force at the lowermost part of the tower. 
Figure 11.5b indicates the total hydrodynamic load calculation with respect to submerged 
height below the sea, while assuming the following parameters: 
1. Sea density 1025kg/m3
2. Diameter of the tower 6.2m (constant section), submerged height below the 
sea level is 25m, which follows a parabolic curve 
In this paper, there are some other factors, such as disturbance produced by the sea traffic 
system and air traffic system, that are not considered. Besides Paradeep there are some more 
sites investigated near Kerala and Chennai where a large wind potential exists and research 
is still on to implement wind turbines at these locations to produce more power output by 
increasing the height of a tower subjected to some constraint, like buckling, fatigue, vibra￾tion, seismic, tsunami, thunders, etc., on the tower’s life.
11.8 Conclusion
Ultimately, this paper provides a brief study for an offshore wind energy conversion tech￾nology and system and design criteria which is very instructive for a cooperative proposed 
offshore project at Paradeep, Odisha. Here, many factors are considered for wind turbine 
model selection. In this paper, the main consideration is given to the exploration of the 
tower design criteria at offshore conditions and also seeks the effect of wind speeds, wind 
veer, wind shear, turbulence, tides, ocean currents, lightning, fatigue, etc. on the towers, 
which is currently the major issue for the Indian conditions (like Chennai) to measure 
wind data at particular heights. A systematic assessment is carried out in the offshore site 
of Odisha which results to wind characteristics graphs, such as mean wind speed behavior 
as per height and designed wind speed for all types of terrains over height. This paper gives 
knowledge on wind assessment for tower design, which can be helpful for future prospects.

Optimizing Volume of Helical Compression 
Spring by Genetic Algorithm and 
Comparing with Simulated Annealing
Kishor Kumar and Meenu*
Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, India
Abstract 
Springs are machine elements that deflect when load is applied and return to its original position by 
giving back the energy that is stored during deflection. The controlled deflection of springs is required 
in various machine applications to control the force or torque applied. The springs deflect in proportion 
to the load applied to the spring. These are used to absorb vibration and shock in shock absorbers of 
cars, railways and other machineries. The springs are generally produced in very large numbers, so the 
optimum quantity of material used in manufacturing becomes the most essential parameter to take 
into consideration. Having less weight or volume and maximum energy storage capacity is the prime 
objective in specific engineering applications. Taking the volume of helical compression springs to be 
objective function of a binary genetic algorithm and simulated annealing is applied in order to optimize 
the volume. Volume, as a function, has three variables which are mean diameter of coil, number of 
active turns, and wire diameter of the spring. The axial deflection of one end and shear stress developed 
in the spring are the two non-linear constraints. A comparison between the solutions obtained from a 
binary genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) is done. Different materials are used to 
manufacture the springs according to the application. The most commonly used materials for springs 
are oil tempered wire, music wire, and chrome vanadium steel. It is found that the optimized values 
obtained from GA are 4.61%, 7.69%, and 10.59% less than the optimized values obtained from SA in 
the case of AISI 1065, AISI 1085, and AISI 6150, respectively. 
Keywords: Binary genetic algorithm, helical compression spring, simulated annealing 
12.1 Introduction 
Helical springs are defined as the elastic machine elements, which deflect when a load acts 
along the axis of a spring. This induces torsional shear stress in the spring wire. Helical 
springs are of two types: closely coiled helical springs and open coiled helical springs. 
Closely coiled spring wire is coiled so closely that the plane containing each coil is at 
a right angle to the axis of the helix. Helix angle, in the case of a closely coiled helical 
spring is less than 10° and in an open coiled helical spring, the helix angle is greater than

10°. Springs are used in clocks, toys, and movie cameras to store energy. In suspension 
springs of vehicles, railway buffer springs, and vibration mounts for machinery they are 
used to absorb shock and vibration. Springs are also used to measure force, like in weigh￾ing machines, and to apply forces and control motion in cam and follower. Steel is used for 
making springs.
Springs are very important parts in mechanical systems, so there is a need to design 
springs with intense care. In this chapter, the main motive is to minimize the weight of a 
helical spring in a given range of parameters while satisfying all the constraints. Various 
research has been done in this direction to optimize the weight of a helical spring with dif￾ferent methods of optimization. Dighewar B. Atish et al. [1] used the genetic algorithm to 
optimize helical spring weight and stresses for different materials like stainless steel, music 
wire, and oil tempered wire having the same loading conditions. Quin-man Fan et al. [2] 
studied the multi-objective optimization of a suspension helical spring of automobiles to 
design an optimal structure using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and pareto optimi￾zation theory. 
Quin-man Fan et al. [3] made a multi-optimization study to minimize the total mass of 
the gradient stiffness leaf spring and stresses at the root of main and auxiliary springs by 
using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Savsani et al. [4] performed the optimization of 
the gear train weight with the help of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated 
annealing (SA) methods. Yokota et al. [5] made the study for optimal weight of gears taking 
bending strength and torsional strength as constraints. Tamboli et al. [6] used the particle 
swarm optimization method to reduce the volume of helical gears. Padmanabhan et al.
[7] performed the optimization on spur gear pair design using a genetic algorithm (GA). 
Daoudi et al. [8] carried out the optimization of the weight of spur gears for different mate￾rials by using a MATLAB toolbox. In this paper, genetic algorithms and simulated anneal￾ing are used to optimize the parameters of helical springs.
There are a number of advanced techniques available for optimization. Advanced meth￾ods are relatively new ones in optimization but can solve the complex engineering optimi￾zation problems which the traditional methods cannot solve. These new methods are being 
used very extensively in all engineering optimization problems due to their ability to solve 
the complex problems. These methods include the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, 
particle swarm optimization, gravitational search algorithms, fuzzy logic, neural network 
algorithms, the cuckoo method, water cycle method, etc. These methods can successfully 
be employed to optimization problems having a large number of variables and non-linear 
constraints. 
A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary technique as the solution evolves from generation 
to generation rather than a random search of solutions, so it can be very efficient in finding 
optimal solutions. Simulated annealing is another technique in which hill climbing is per￾formed to reach the global optimal solution from the local optimal solution.
12.2 Design of Springs
A binary genetic algorithm and simulated annealing are used to optimize the volume of 
helical springs for average service applications. The volume of the helical spring is taken 
as the objective function to be minimized and the two main designing constraints are the Optimizing Helical Compression Spring by GA and Comparing with SA 149
shear stress and deflection of the spring. Different types of steel can be used for the man￾ufacturing of springs; some of the most commonly used materials for springs are oil tem￾pered spring steel wire (AISI 1065), music wire (AISI 1085), and chrome-vanadium steel 
(AISI 6150). The optimization is applied on all the three materials. 
The paper presents a study of helical compression springs under some specific condi￾tion where the applied force is up to the value of 3000 N. In designing the helical spring, 
special care is given to the crucial factors which are responsible for the strength of the 
spring. The deflection of springs is restricted because of the space availability and shape 
of the deformation in the application. There has to be some maximum value for the 
deflection which can be considered as permissible so that the deflection remains under 
the elastic limits. Direct shear stresses and the shear stresses developed because of the 
torsional moment, in addition to the curvature effect of spring, play an important role in 
the failure study of springs. These effects are included, to some extent, by taking Wahl’s 
stress factor.
Input properties of spring materials [9] are given below in Table 12.1.
12.2.1 Objective Function 
The objective function can be expressed as a mathematical equation in terms of its variables 
which, upon applying optimization techniques, gives the desired outcome. Volume of the 
helical spring in terms of wire diameter (d), number of active coil turns (Na), and mean coil 
diameter (D) is given by Equation 12.1 [10].

12.2.2 Design Variables 
Design variables are controlling parameters which are optimized in some specific set of 
values to achieve the global optimum of objective function. There are three design variables 
in the objective function of volume and these are wire diameter (d), number of active coil 
turns (Na
), and mean coil diameter (D). The range of values is given in Table 12.2.

12.2.3 Design Constraints 
An objective function is subjected to constraints which need to be satisfied by the design 
variables in order to obtain an optimized value. Shear stress and deflection at one end of the 
spring are two non-linear design constraints that are taken.
12.2.3.1 Shear Stress
When the helical spring is subjected to an axial load (F), it tries to rotate the wire because of 
a twisting moment developed in wire. A torsional stress is developed in the wire and given 
by Equation 12.2 [11].

12.3 Optimization Techniques 
There are various techniques available for optimization which can be applied to problems 
depending upon the type of objective function and constraints. Volume of a helical com￾pression spring is a non-linear function of its variables and subjected to two non-linear 
constraints. There are some population based techniques which are helpful in optimizing 
different types of functions including linear, non-linear, convex, and non-convex. A binary 
genetic algorithm and simulated annealing are two such techniques which are applied to 
the volume function. 
12.3.1 Binary Genetic Algorithm 
A genetic algorithm is one of the widely used evolutionary algorithms for optimization of 
complex problems having non-linear multi-objective functions and a large number of vari￾ables subjected to the non-linear constraints. Genetic algorithms work on the principal of 
Darwin’s theory of evolution, that is survival of fittest. Genetic algorithms search the initial 
population space for optimal solutions through natural selection. Some genetic algorithm 
operators are used in processes like coding, selection, cross over, and mutation. Individual 
points in population are encoded in terms of binary bits. The highest and lowest limit of 
variables is equated with the highest and lowest binary bit strings, respectively. The value 
of variable in between can be calculated by interpolation. The highest and lowest limits are 
termed as upper bound and lower bound, respectively.

There is an initial population search space created at random and then some operations 
are implemented to the initially generated population. Out of these randomly created solu￾tions some solutions are picked through selection operator and further operations are per￾formed on these selected solutions. Cross over operation is implemented on selected solution 
strings. A random mask of binary bits equal to the length of each string is created and then 
each bit is checked. Each bit of mask string is checked right from the beginning. If the mask 
string has a 1, then that corresponding bit for offspring is taken from the first parent string 
and if it has 0, then the bit is taken from the second parent string. The same process is fol￾lowed for creating offspring from all parents. Uniform cross over is shown in Table 12.3.
Table 12.3 Uniform cross over.
Parent 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
Parent 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
Mask 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
Offspring 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
Offspring 2 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1152 Optimization of Industrial Systems
For Offspring 1, Parent 1 and the mask are taken into consideration and for Offspring 2, 
Parent 2 and the mask are taken into consideration.
Cross over probability is the main parameter in cross over which defines how many indi￾vidual strings are going to perform cross over out of the population. A cross over probabil￾ity of 0 means that no individual is involved in cross over, so all the individuals are copied 
exactly for the next generation. A cross over probability of 1 means that all the individuals 
are performing the cross over, so no initial individual is going to the next generation. All 
the individuals in the next generation will be new. Losing original individuals in the next 
generation can be disadvantageous for further convergence of a solution, so it is important 
to retain some of the individuals in the next generation in hope that they will carry some 
good original individuals to the next generation. The group of individuals who are not tak￾ing part in cross over are known as the elite group. Cross over probability of somewhere in 
between 0 to 1 is appropriate. Cross over probability of 0.8 means the 80 percent individuals 
are taking part in cross over and producing the offspring. The other 20 percent of individ￾uals are put into the elite group. 
Mutation is performed on the solution strings after cross over. A mutation chromosome 
is generated and checked bit by bit. If the mutation chromosome has 1 at any place of string, 
then the corresponding bit in the parent individual string is flipped and if a mutation chro￾mosome has 0 at any place, then the corresponding bit in parent remains the same. Table 
12.4 shows flipping. 
Mutation probability is important just like cross over probability. Mutation probability 
defines how much a bit is changed. A mutation probability of 0 percent means that no bit 
is changed in the parent and the same parents are going to the next generation without any 
change. A mutation probability of 1 means that all the bits are changed in the parent, so all 
new and diversified children go to the next generations. Generally, the mutation probability 
can be taken as low as 0.001 to 0.1. A random number is created for the mutation of each 
and every bit. If the created number is less than the mutation probability, the bit is flipped; 
this ,means if it is 0, then it is converted into 1 and vice versa.
Now, the newly generated strings are put into the population. The whole process is 
repeated until optimal criteria are satisfied. In this way, by natural selection a series of evo￾lution happens in the solution strings and the strings approach to the optimal solutions 
required. 
A genetic algorithm involves 6 steps as shown in Figure 12.1:
Step 1: Generate the initial random search space in binary bits
Step 2: Rowlett wheel selection is performed to select the solutions having high 
function values
Step 3: Some solution strings are made as elite strings and will remain same for 
the next generation

Step 4: Uniform cross over is performed on other strings to make solutions better
Step 5: Mutation is done finally to get the solutions which are difficult by cross over
Step 6: If convergence is obtained, then the optimum solution is reached, other￾wise repeat from Step 2
12.3.2 Simulated Annealing 
Simulated annealing is based on the concepts of the annealing process in the manufacturing 
process in which a metal is heated up to a certain temperature and then left to cool down 
very slowly. Initially, the temperature distribution is random in the metal, but as soon as 
the metal cools down, the temperature distribution inside the metal approaches the equi￾librium state. Initially, a random point is generated with setting a temperature parameter 
as high as possible in the annealing process. Then, the hill climbing process is performed.

A nearby point is selected randomly and the values of the fitness function at these values 
are calculated. These fitness values are compared with each other. If the fitness value of a 
new selected point is higher than the fitness value of a current point, then the new point is 
selected as a current point with full probability, but if the fitness value of a newly selected 
point is less than the fitness value at the current point, then the probability of selecting a 
new point as a current point is defined by an exponential function. The exponential func￾tion, in turn, is the function of the difference of fitness values at these points and the tem￾perature parameter. Initially, the value of the temperature parameter is very high so the 
selection probability of a new point as a current point is very high or near to one, but 
as generations go by, the value of temperature parameter decreases and the probability of 
selection of the new point as a current point decreases. In this way, the solution approaches 
the best optimal solution.
SA involves the following steps as shown in Figure 12.2:
Step 1: The algorithm starts with setting the temperature parameter (T) as high 
as possible and generates the current point (C) randomly in a given range of 
variables. The current point includes values of all the variables. The function 
value at a current point is calculated by objective function, which is termed E1.
Step 2: A nearby point N is selected randomly within the given range of vari￾ables. The function value at the new point is calculated and termed as E2.
Step 3: The difference between the function values at the new point and current 
point is calculated by Equation 12.7 and termed as ∆E.
∆E = E2 − E1 (12.7)
Step 4: If the difference (∆E) is positive that means the new point is better than 
the current point, so update the new point (N) as current point (C).
Step 5: If the difference (∆E) is negative that means the new point is not better 
than the current point, so for selecting that point as current point the proba￾bility function has to be determined. The probability is given by Equation 12.8.
P = exp (−∆E/T) (12.8)
Step 6: A random variable (r) is generated between 0 and 1. The probability func￾tion value is compared against random variable r.
Step 7: If the probability function value is greater than the random variable r, 
then the new point (N) is selected as the current point (C), otherwise it is 
neglected. 
Step 8: Once the above loop of the algorithm is completed, the value of the tem￾perature parameter (T) is updated by Equation 12.9.
T = α T (12.9)
Step 9: After decreasing the value of the temperature parameter (T), the loop is 
executed again from Step 2 to Step 8 until the optimal condition is arrived Optimizing Helical Compression Spring by GA and Comparing with SA 155
or stopping criteria are reached. Stopping criteria is when no significant 
improvement in the function value is observed. 
12.4 Discussion of Results
Three materials, AISI 1065, AISI 1085, and AISI 6150, are chosen for the spring in optimization

The numbers of generations are taken as high as 200 so that any significant change in the 
values of design variables over the long range of generation can be detected and a smooth 
curve can be obtained by running the program for a number of times. The program is run 
a number of times to find the optimum solution. The size of population is taken as 100 in 
order to provide a diverse set of solutions so the algorithm finds enough numbers of options 
to explore in the population space. The other GA parameters include a cross over proba￾bility and mutation probability of 0.80 and 0.1, which control and guide the binary strings 
to reach to the optimal value from generation to generation. For simulated annealing, the 
temperature parameter is taken as high as 1000 initially and reduced to the minimum by 
linear coefficient α to reduce the randomness in the selection of new points. The results 
are shown in Table 12.7. Figures 12.3-12.5 show the convergence curve with the number

12.5 Conclusions
It is seen from the convergence curves of volume that the GA converges faster than the SA 
and gives the best optimum solution. The volume optimized by the GA is 4.61%, 7.69%, and 
10.59% less than the SA in the case of AISI 1065, AISI 1085, and AISI 6150, respectively.
From Figure 12.6, it is concluded that Cr-V (AISI 6150) steel requires a minimum vol￾ume of helical compression springs in a given range of variables when compared to the AISI 
1065 and AISI 1085.
This advantage in binary GA can be attributed to the fact that it involves binary digits 
which are easier to operate with and evolve with a great precision to give the best solution.

Abstract 
Numerous attempts in various studies have been performed on the topological optimisation of 
several implant designs. This study emphasizes on the topological optimisation of threaded dental 
implants by means of computer aided design technology with the aid of the Finite Element Method. 
A three-dimensional implant was designed on the leading edge modelling CAD commercial soft￾ware and Autodesk Fusion 360 maintaining the dimensional accuracies. The final design will then 
be applied with suitable constraints and forces along with some suitable regions standing preserved 
and terminated from the optimisation affect. The revolutionary technique of Topological Design 
Optimisation, which benefits in attaining the best possible implant structure, is capable of delivering 
the finest structural support to the implant along with minimal consumption of material. This leads 
to the increased osseointegration of the implant, which assists in better fixture of the implant once 
fitted inside the jaw along with the overall reduction in implant cost and the removal of excess mate￾rial. The final design possesses qualities such as high osseointegration with unsurpassed structure. 
The prime advantage of the new design is that it elevated the area for osseointegration ingrowth by 
offering more space to the overall implant design when contrasted with the other designs.
Keywords: Dental implants, topology optimisation, osseointegration, computer aided design,

13.1 Introduction
Dental implant history dates back to the Egyptian ancient times where it was found that 
stones or seashells were used in place of the missing teeth. Some other examples of ancient 
implants include fabrication of implants from noble metal and being shaped into natural 
roots. The past of dental implants is of many centuries beginning with civilizations as early 
as the past two thousand years in parts of the Mediterranean, Middle Asia, and America. 
According to the archeological findings, back then the missing teeth were swapped with 
shells, gold, bones, and carved stones [1]. 1971 saw the introduction of the Brånemark 
*Corresponding authors: abner.lawrence7@gmail.com, muhammadsahil1997@gmail.com, rahul.me18@nitp.ac.in162 Optimization of Industrial Systems
system of dental implants. Later, it was estimated that every year one million endosseous are 
placed worldwide and 220 implant brands are produced by around 80 manufacturers [2].
The dental implant system includes an implant which has to be integrated surgically 
on either the mandible or the maxilla, along with the abutment which has to mate with 
the implant after it gets integrated into the bone. The aim of dental implants is to replace a 
tooth structure that is partially or completely damaged or diseased, which means restoring 
it aesthetically as well as functionally. The application of dental implants is one of the very 
usual and popular treatments with a high success rate [3]. Some materials used for making 
implants are pure titanium, titanium alloys, ceramics such as Aluminium Oxide and alloys 
of gold and nickel-chrome-vanadium [4]. 
The term ossiointegration was first described by Brånemark as the connection or inter￾face between the bone surface and implant [5]. An implant is said to be osseointegrated 
when it itself experiences no relative motion with the bone which is in direct contact with 
it [6]. Albrektsson et al. also explained that there are 6 parameters that have to be con￾trolled for allowing the right anchorage of bone: (i) the surface condition of the implant, (ii) 
design, (iii) biocompatibility, (iv) surgical technique, (v) host bed’s state, and (vi) loading 
conditions [7].
With osseointegration, the main goal is to achieve long lasting mechanical stability and 
fixation between the bone and the bioactive/textured surface of the implant. The achieve￾ment of a textured surface can be done by using technologies like applying meshes, plasma 
spray coatings, or sintered beans on the surface through sandblasting of the surface. 
Osseointegration also has an advantage that it reduces the risk of stress shielding and subse￾quent bone resorption because mechanical loads are directly transferred to the surrounding 
load [8]. Such technologies were developed against the problems related to cemented total 
joints and to avoid a secondary cement interface between the bone tissue and metal [9].
An endosseous implant is a kind of endosteal embed that is intended to imitate the nat￾ural root of a tooth by utilizing a vertical section of anchor that remains to be worked out 
of the dental implant equipment which is comprised of titanium. However, titanium screws 
are utilized for dental implants due to its biological compatibility and that it intertwines 
well with human bone. A root structure dental implant is set in the locale of missing max￾illary or mandibular teeth after carefully mulling over the foundational and oral strength of 
the patient [10]. 
Biomaterials are materials that work well with living tissues. The chemical properties, 
as well as physical properties, of the materials of the implant are well-informed elements 
that impact the clinical result and the anticipation of implant treatment. These properties 
incorporate the implant’s microstructure and its surface arrangement and attributes, just as 
configuration factors [11]. The objective of biomaterials looks into and continues to create 
implant materials that actuate unsurprising, control-guided, and quick curing of the inter￾facial tissues, both hard and delicate [12].
According to the analysis done by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial 
Doctors, a figure was given which showed that 69% of adults at the age near about 35 to 44 
lost their lasting tooth to gum disease, accident, and failure of a root canal or decaying of a 
tooth. Furthermore, at the age of 74, 26% of people have almost lost their all teeth. In this 
way, the utilization of dental implants reveals the assumption that dental implants in the 
range of 100,000-300,000 are found or implanted each year, which approaches the quan￾tities of the counterfeit knee and hip joints implants that are inserted at regular intervals. Topological Design Optimisation of Dental Implant 163
Research on plans regarding dental implants and materials, as well as procedures have 
stretched out in recent years and are anticipated to reach out later on because the most 
recent development for dental implants in the worldwide market is increasing with the 
increase in the insistence for cosmetic dentistry. 
The most commonly used metal and ceramics are Zirconia and Titanium. We start with 
the metal titanium. Titanium and its alloys as biomaterials have been progressively utilized 
in different devices or structures used in contact with or inside the organic and natural bio￾logical system, as in orthopedics, dental, and cardiovascular applications [13-15].
A technique or method (mathematical) which is used for finding out the optimum mate￾rial with a well-defined design domain, i.e., for a number of boundary conditions (con￾straints and loads), to achieve the system’s maximum performance is denoted as Topology 
Optimisation [16]. The advantage of using this technique is that the design can acquire 
any shape within the design space and can produce a lightweight design by reducing the 
material but having almost same strength as that of the original design and is time saving 
and cost effective. Its primary goal is to keep the structural compliance at a minimum spon￾taneously while satisfying the constraints of volume removal. The key function of lowering 
the structure compliance to minimum equals the strain energy at minimum for the reason 
that strain energy is half of the structure compliance [17, 18]. Another feature is to reduce 
the stress shielding effect, i.e., the region having stress of the least magnitude, and help in 
reducing the material without hampering the implant’s strength.
In this chapter, we will use the Computer Aided Design (CAD) technique to design an 
implant using a CAD software and then will perform the Topology Optimisation method to 
reduce the material of the dental implant, thus keeping its strength almost the same as that 
of the original design by eliminating the stress shielding problem.
13.2 Research Methods
Dental implants are used as an alternative to the natural tooth when there is some infection 
in the gum which is often referred to as peri-implantitis which would eventually lead to 
loss of bone or implant or inflammation. It serves the same objectives as that of the natural 
tooth. An implant is inserted in the cancellous bone which is surrounded by the cortical 
bone which provides support and strength to the implant. During the process of implanta￾tion, the dental implant is not perfectly aligned with respect to the bone, i.e., at the interface 
of the bone and implant, the amalgamation of the dental implant with the bone is average. In 
other words, osseointegration of the bone with the implant is not good, but after 5-6 months 
when the bone grows completely around the implant, then the osseointegration turns out 
to be a very strong one mainly due to the dynamic stresses being generated by chewing at 
a moderate level and bone marrow hyperplasia [19]. The bones are in proper contact with 
the implant and the implant performs its functions just like the natural tooth with high 
veracity. The three-dimensional model of the implant was created on Autodesk Fusion 360. 
Few assumptions had to be made before using it for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in order 
to proceed for Topology Optimisation. The reference model which is used is a commercial 
solid screw implant (cylindrical implant connected with solid abutment acting as one unit) 
and its geometry was adapted from Nobel Biocare®, Branemark, Gothenburg, Sweden. As 
represented in Figure 13.1, the dimensions of the implant include its diameter, which was 164 Optimization of Industrial Systems
4.0mm. The length of the implant was taken to be 13.5mm, inclusive of the abutment. The 
pitch and depth of the threads were taken to be 1.0mm and 0.30mm while the diameter of 
the bottom tip was taken to be 3.4mm for the reason that throughout its length, the implant 
is slightly tapered at an angle of 1.7 degrees. 
Ti-6Al-4V, an alloy of Titanium is used as the material for this implant because of its 
high biocompatibility. It is the most used alloy of titanium due to its exceptional char￾acteristics, enhanced strength, improvised machinability and eminent mechanical prop￾erties. It has additional enhanced characteristics of like elevated strength, outstanding 
resistance to corrosion, and its weight-to-volume ratio is low [20]. Meshing is an essential 
step in designing and simulation analysis. It can be done either before applying bound￾ary conditions or afterwards. Without the model being meshed, no simulation can be 
performed. What meshing really does is that it differentiates the complete model design 
into several smaller sections which, if integrated, forms the original design model. The 
algorithm of the simulation software works on these smaller sections as per the bound￾ary conditions assigned. Every section provides the results of the analysis distinctively 
which is then integrated and the final result is shown collectively. The finer the meshing, 
the more accurate the result. Figure 13.2 represents the meshing of the designed dental 
implant.
During simulation, all the edges of the implant’s thread were constrained in all direc￾tions. In many studies, only the static stresses acting on the implant are considered, but in 
this study dynamic stresses have also been considered which are induced on the implant’s 
body after chewing. Dynamic stresses act in three directions along the 3 axes. As shown in 
Figure 13.3, an axial load of 200N is applied on the face of the implant while forces of 50N 
and 34N are applied in the mesiodistal and lingual directions. The same forces act on the 
bottom face of the implant, as well transfer the force to the cancellous bone. The structure 
consists of 6200 nodes and 3387 elements. 
The properties of Ti-6Al-4V, which is used as the material of the implant, can be shown 
in Table 13.1 and the workflow for the proposed work is represented in Figure 13.4.

13.2.1 Topology Optimisation
The Topology Optimisation analysis was performed in Autodesk Fusion 360 under certain 
boundary conditions already mentioned above. After the analysis, the optimised region was 
achieved, as shown in Figure 13.5a in a green colour. This region depicts that the influence 
of applied boundary conditions is negligible at this area, hence unnecessary material can 
be removed without compromising the strength of the implant. Figures 13.5b and 13.5c 
represent the front and isometric views of the final titanium implant model, post Topology 
Optimisation. The principal formulation described the problem by lowering the compli￾ance energy and, at the same time, a constraint on the structure’s volume is being satisfied.

13.3 Result Discussion
The primary objective of this work was to plan the ideal dental implant considering the 
mechanical reaction at the implant’s respective interfaces. The role of the dental implant 
is to transmit load to the nearby biological tissues. In this manner, the essential utilitar￾ian design objective is to oversee (disseminate and disperse) the loads applied externally

by optimizing the implant-supported prosthesis function. There is an excess of 50 designs 
of the implant body accessible to accomplish the ideal clinical objectives. Then, the engi￾neering solutions are intermingled with the rudimental principles (scientific) linked to the 
parameters of force and geometry. Necrosis can be caused due to compromise in the peri￾osteal blood supply in vivo because of compression, risk of bone loss may be enhanced due 
to high compressive stress, and bone resorption can also be caused due to extensive tensile 
stress [21-23]. In order to avoid high stress concentration in bone, most studies are centered 
around long-term, stable osseointegration of implant restorations [24, 25]. In any case, little 
data is accessible on optimisation (structural design) of dental implants.
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has become an enhancing utilitarian tool for enumerat￾ing the effects of stress on the dental implant and the bone surrounding it. The achievement 
or failure of a dental implant can also be determined by the state in which stress is trans￾ferred to the surrounding bone. Underloading of the bone may result in disuse atrophy and 
subsequent bone loss, whereas overload can result in the implant’s failure due to fatigue 
or bone resorption. Full osseointegration was achieved in most FEA models, as the bone–
implant interface was assumed to be perfect [26]. Utilizing 3D FEA, it is found from the 
stress dissemination at bone-implant interface that cross over mechanical stacking plays a 
more crucial role in the dependability of a dental implant.
The stress form of the bone adjoining the osseointegrated dental prosthesis is 
impacted by various biomechanical boundaries which incorporate geometry of the 
implant’s screw, prosthesis material properties, kind of loading, the nature of the encom￾passing bone, and the state of the interface of the bone implant. The yield strength of 
the titanium implant was higher as compared to the von-Mises (equivalent stress) which 
proved the implant’s stability. From the viewpoint of stability, dental implants displaying 
lower implant stress ought to be chosen. It is seen that both interface stress and strain 
increment with the increment in porosity rate, but in the event of a regular molar tooth, 
the von Mises stress in every case is not exactly the most extreme stress and strain for 
all of the bone condition. The bone stresses prior to implant are meant to be within con￾finements in order to be safeguarded from issues like overloading and bone resorption. 
When implant diameter is larger, the stress and failure rate reduce compared to when 
implant diameter is lesser, which eventually results in comparatively high failure rates 
due to elevated stresses. 
Although a tapered implant is not appropriate for all applications, as the type of implant 
needed to be made is totally patient specific, yet tapered geometry encourages the over￾all stability of the implant due to the compression stresses exerted by the implant on its 
surroundings. The stresses for an optimised implant are evenly distributed on the regular 
geometry and slightly raise at the optimised section. The stresses produced do not have any 
effect on the total implant functionality, lest affecting its osteointegration. The stresses get 
evenly distributed on the surface of the implant, hence the extra surface added in the post 
optimisation process also assists in minimizing the stress effect on the implant surface. 
During the analysis it was found that the area which was least affected by the stress is the 
same section of the implant where metal removing is carried out.
Reduction of material is taken from such a section of the implant which has minimum 
effect on the strength and stiffness of the implant, maintaining the implant’s mechanical 
characteristics. The removed slotted region is designed in a way so that it has the least or 
completely no effect on the uniformity of the implant’s geometry, which included sustaining Topological Design Optimisation of Dental Implant 169
its tapered design. The optimised section, based on two slotted regions, are slotted in such 
a way that the stress distribution along the regions remains constant as can be easily con￾cluded by earlier figures.
13.3.1 Effect of Equivalent Stress (von-Mises)
In order to measure levels of stress and also to evaluate the distribution of stress at the 
interface of the implant and the bone, von Mises or equivalent stress was used as a prime 
indicator. Figure 13.6 represents the equivalent stress (von-Mises) of the implant prior to 
and post Topology Optimisation. In post Stress Analysis of equivalent stress (von-mises) 
of the implant, the results showed a minimum stress of 0.47MPa and maximum stress of 
209.4 MPa. Therefore, the material from the region of minimum stress is removed using 
the Topology Optimisation technique, thus reducing the problem of stress shielding. The 
values for the same stress analysis of the topologically optimised implant depicted a min￾imum stress of 0.08MPa and maximum stress of 226.9MPa. The evaluated maximum 
values were found near the abutment at the surface of the cortical bone, whereas the 
evaluated minimum values were found at the interface of the implant and the cancellous

13.3.2 Effect of Safety Factor
An optimum dental implant design should satisfy factors for a very long life without alter￾ing the structural stability of the implant. This can only be ensured by checking the safety 
factor of the implant. Figure 13.7 represents the safety factor of the implant prior to and 
post topology optimisation. The safety factor of the original structure or implant was 4.2. 
A safety factor above the value of 3 is considered to be a rigid body and would not fail or 
become deformed when post stresses are applied on the body. On the other hand, the safety 
factor of the optimised implant was 3.9. These results depict that the structure is rigid and 
will not deform by the prescribed loads acting on it.

13.3.3 Effect of Strain
The strain distributions were evaluated for the two implants. Figure 13.8 represents the 
safety factor of the implant prior to and post topology optimisation. The magnitudes of 
strain of the original structure or implant were 6.242E-06 (minimum) and 0.0031(max￾imum), while the topologically optimized implant showed a minimum strain of 9.248E￾07 and a maximum strain of 0.0033. The strain distribution for the original implant was 
slightly greater than that of the topologically optimized implant. Table 13.2 represents the 
resultant values of the Finite Element Analysis. 
As a result, the volume of the implant decreased from 114.39 mm3
 to 108.48mm3
 after 
applying the Topology Optimisation technique to the implant. The surface area of the 
implant increased from 170.294 mm2
 to 207.229 mm2
, thus promoting more bone growth 
and increasing the interface of bone and implant without altering the implant’s stability,

leading to better osseointegration. The density was the same for both the structures (0.004 g/
mm3
). The mass for the optimised implant was 0.481g, while the mass for the original 
implant was 0.507g. 
13.4 Conclusion
• A new topologically optimised dental implant was obtained. The new implant 
was almost 5.5% lighter than the original implant and at least 85% of the total 
mass was retained.
• Initially, the structure consisted of 6200 nodes and 3387 elements, but after 
optimisation the new implant consisted of 6689 nodes and 3846 elements. 
• The strength of the new implant was very close to that of the original implant. 
• More surface area with a decrease in volume was achieved. Increase in sur￾face by approximately 21.9% was attained, which facilitates more growth of 
the bone around and through the implant, as well as leading to a rigid struc￾ture and enhancing osseointegration. 
• Thus, a lightweight, cost effective implant was obtained with nearly the same 
strength as that of the original implant.

Abstract 
In current times, numerous studies have been done to explore new renewable alternate fuel which 
can run CI engines without compromising the power outputs. Researchers have established Jatropha 
biodiesel as a potential alternative fuel for the CI engine. Biodiesel can be used in blended forms with 
diesel and delivers comparable performance, combustion characteristics, and reduced emissions to 
that of diesel. In the current study, biodiesel has been produced from Jatropha curcas oil by using a 
heterogeneous catalyst blended with diesel (B30, 30% biodiesel and 70% diesel v/v) to experimen￾tally investigate combustion characteristics of a diesel engine. The response surface methodology 
(RSM) has been implemented to evaluate combustion characteristics with three input variables, 
namely load (0, 6, 12 Kgf), compression ratio (14, 16, and 18), and fuel injection pressure (180, 225, 
and 270 bar). The equations were obtained for combustion pressure by using a quadratic polynomial. 
From the RSM, engine input parameters are found to be optimal at 269.87 bar fuel injection pressure, 
18 compression ratio and 11.97 Kgf load. The optimum value of peak combustion pressure (Pmax) 
has been observed to be 74.78 bar. Optimized and experimental results of the engine response output 
at optimized engine parameters are compared and perceived within an acceptable error range. It has 
been concluded that Jatropha biodiesel (produced from heterogeneous catalyst) blend B30, delivers 
2.36% higher Pmax relative to mineral diesel.

14.1 Introduction
Fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation are the two major challenges faced 
by emerging economies of the globe. Haphazard extraction and magnificent consump￾tion is continuously decreasing underground petroleum resources. Petroleum based fuel

requirement is increasing continuously and emission norms are getting more stringent, 
therefore, it is a need of the hour to explore alternate renewable energy resources which 
can substitute petroleum based fuels in compression ignition (CI) engines. Presently, bio￾diesel is gaining popularity as an alternative to mineral diesel fuel as it is a renewable, 
biodegradable, cleaner fuel which can exhibit similar performance, improved combus￾tion and emission characteristics in CI engines [1]. Non-edible and edible oils are the 
two major source of biodiesel production, but production of biodiesel from edible oils 
will create food chain disruption. Hence, usage of a non-edible source of oil is best suited 
for producing biodiesel. This can be a milestone for economic and rural development 
of a country [2]. In this study, crude oil from Jatropha is used for biodiesel production 
through the transesterification process using a heterogeneous catalyst. Easy phase sepa￾ration and reusability are two major benefits of a heterogeneous catalyst over a homoge￾neous, as it does not produce soap during the transesterification reaction. In the current 
investigation, commercial CaO has been used as a heterogeneous catalyst. Zabeti et al. 
obtained biodiesel yield of 90.5% at a reaction time of 300 min by using a heterogeneous 
catalyst for the transesterification process [3]. Nisar et al.  have used a heterogeneous base 
catalyst for transesterification of Jatropha oil and achieved an optimum yield of 96.1% at 
6 wt% catalyst concentration, a 9:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time of 3h, and 
900  °C reaction temperature [4]. Several studies have been done to access the perfor￾mance, combustion properties, and engine exhaust of biodiesel blends on CI engines and 
they concluded that biodiesel and its blends can be used for running a CI engine without 
compromising power outputs and combustion performance. Furthermore, reduction in 
engine exhaust emissions has also been reported with the use of biodiesel [5]. Sahoo 
et al. [1] has produced biodiesel using Jatropha oil, Karanja, and Polanga through the 
transesterification process and blended with diesel for investigation in a diesel engine 
under varying loading conditions (0, 50 and 100% load). They have specifically studied 
the combustion behavior of engines and computed combustion pressure, ignition delay, 
and heat release rate (HRR). From the combustion study, they have observed that the 
peak pressure for a 100%, 50%, and 20% blend of Jatropha biodiesel was 6, 4.09, and 2 bar 
higher than diesel. Similarly, for a 100%, 50%, and 20% blend of Karanja biodiesel and 
Polanga biodiesel blend, peak pressure was 5.5, 4.6, and 1.7 bar and 6.61, 5.4, and 2.2 bar 
higher than diesel, respectively. Gharehghani et al. [5] have examined the combustion 
and exhaust emission of a single cylinder engine with biodiesel produced from waste fish 
oil under different loading conditions. They have reported higher cylinder pressure than 
diesel. From the emission analysis, reduction in CO (5.2-27%) and HC (11.6-70%) emis￾sions and increase in NOx
 (12.8%) and CO2
 emissions were observed for biodiesel rather 
than diesel. Dhar et al. [6-7] have used the Karanja biodiesel blend to operate transport 
engines. The authors have reported that at higher engine loads, combustion peak pressure 
of biodiesel blends was higher than diesel. Reduction in HC and CO emissions however 
increment in NOx emission observed. In another study of the neem oil biodiesel blend on 
CI engines, it was observed that the B20 blend delivered a higher peak cylinder pressure 
than that of diesel because of shorter ignition delay. Engine exhaust emissions and com￾bustion behavior of a generator engine operated on a 20% blend of neem oil biodiesel 
with diesel were studied by Agarwal et al. [8]. They have reported higher peak pres￾sure for biodiesel blend under different loads. Increase in maximum cylinder pressure 
is mainly due to shorter ignition delay and in rapid burning of fuel. From the emission RSM Approach for Combustion Analysis of CI Engine 175
analysis, it was observed that at higher engine load, CO and HC emissions decreased, 
moreover NOx was increased compared to diesel. Kumar et al. [9] have operated variable 
compression ratio (VCR) engines fueled with Jatropha biodiesel blends under different 
compression ratios (CR). Authors have shown that at 75% engine load and various com￾pression ratios, a biodiesel blend delivers elevated peak cylinder pressure compared to 
mineral diesel. They have also reported that cylinder pressure increases with increase in 
load and CR. Choudhary et al. [10] operated a diesel engine with bioethanol produced 
from a water hyacinth plant and examined the f of biodiesel (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% vol￾ume) blended with diesel were used to operate the engine under various load, CR, and 
fuel injection pressures (FIP). They have reported that at higher load and CR, bioethanol 
blends produce higher combustion pressure than diesel. It was concluded that a diesel 
engine can be run on 25% bioethanol mixed with diesel.
The aim of the present study is to operate a single cylinder VCR diesel engine with min￾eral diesel and Jatropha biodiesel (produced from a heterogeneous catalyst, CaO) blend 
B30 for analysis of combustion performance under varying load, CR, and FIP. Experiments 
conducted as per central composite face centered design (CCFCD) and statistical analysis 
of experimental data has been done by employing RSM. Optimum peak combustion pres￾sure obtained at optimal input engine settings for B30 blend and comparative analysis has 
been done relative to mineral diesel. 
14.2 Materials and Methods
Biodiesel form Jatropha curcas oil (obtained from Jatropha seed) has been produced by 
using a heterogeneous solid catalyst (CaO) for the transesterification process in the pres￾ence of methanol. Transesterification is a well-known process for biodiesel production from 
plant oil in which reduction in viscosity is achieved for suitable use and better performance 
and combustion property in a compression ignition engine. For preparation of test blends 
of biodiesel, commercially available diesel has been used.
14.2.1 Test Fuel Properties 
Experiments have been conducted using blend B30 (30% biodiesel and 70% diesel) and 
diesel (B0) on a VCR diesel engine. Different physiochemical properties of test fuel blends 
have been indicated in Table 14.1. Test results show a lower calorific value for a B30 blend 
than diesel due to the presence of oxygen molecules in chemical structure of biodiesel. 
Higher cetane index of biodiesel improves combustion characteristics and engine effi￾ciency. Biodiesel is a safer fuel to store due to high flash point. Various literatures have been 
reviewed and based on that, pilot experiments using a B30 blend has been done on diesel 
engines. 
14.2.2 Test Bench Description 
A single cylinder, variable compression ratio engine was used for experiments, as depicted 
in Figure 14.1. The test bench was having the arrangement for changing the compression 
ratio by upward or downward movement of the bore head of an engine. Fuel injection 176 Optimization of Industrial Systems
pressure was varied by placing a washer between the spring and plunger of the fuel pump 
that was initially calibrated at BOSCH center. The test bench was equipped with a control 
panel, computer, and a data processing system. Eddy current dynamometer for loading 
and load setting was done manually through the control panel. An exhaust gas analyzer 
and various sensors for performance, combustion, and exhaust emissions measurement 
was also fitted with the test bench. Data of pressures and volumes were stored by software 
for drawing plots of P-V and P-Ѳ diagrams. The software had the facility to store combus￾tion data like peak pressure, ignition duration and ignition delay, and heat release rate for 
further analysis in the data acquisition system. Setup specifications are given in Table 14.2. 
Various data were analyzed using the Labview application, “Enginesoft LV”. Engine running

speed was 1500 rpm during the experiment for the B0 and B30 blend. As per design of 
experiments of RSM, twenty experiments were carried out and the combustion pressure 
data recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was established by recorded data and com￾bustion characteristics have been examined. The three input variables selected for the study 
were load (0, 6, & 12 Kgf), compression ratio (14, 16, & 18), and fuel injection pressure 
(180, 225, & 270 bar).
14.2.3 Response Surface Methodology
Evaluation and optimization of combustion characteristics of a CI engine have been done 
by employing RSM with the use of design expert software. In the present study, the CCFCD 
was used to design the experimental matrix and to fit a quadratic model that involves a 
minimal number of experiments for modelling. The CCFCD consists of 20 experiments, as 
per Equation 14.1, with 2p factorial runs, 2p axial runs, and 6 center point, where p shows 
the number of engine input variables which are shown in Table 14.3.

Performing experiments as per the design matrix, determining the coefficients in a RSM 
model, and prediction of response with an adequacy check of the model are the key steps 
involved in the optimization process. Empirical models were generated to correlate the 
input parameters with output response and are based on the quadratic model for maximiz￾ing the combustion performance as mentioned in Equation 14.2.

14.3 Results and Discussion
14.3.1 ANOVA Model and Analysis
Analysis of variance has been used for model analysis, evaluation, and computation of 
numerical data for p-value and F value. CCFCD suggested a quadratic model to assess the 
effect of specific engine input factors on Pmax, and is given as:
Pmax = 13.1044 − 1.6796xLOAD + 0.4132xCR - 0.2254xFIP 
+ 0.13229xLOADxCR + 0.00241xLOADxFIP + 0.00781xCRxFIP 
+ 0.01924xLOADxLOAD + 0.0857xCRxCR 0.00042xFIPxFIP (14.3)
The ANOVA of output response is shown in Table 14.4. The F-value and p-value indi￾cate whether models are significant. The F-test correlates the mean square of the source 
with the mean square of the residual. When the p-value is observed to be less than 0.05, 
then the parameter can be considered significant. This model is significant with the p-value 
being less than 0.05 and an F-value of 299.32. The observed F-value for the “Lack of Fit” 
test is 3.51, which demonstrates its non-significance. The probability of significant “Lack of 
Fit” is around 9.7%. This high value of F may be attributed to noise. Thus, it is interpreted 
that Load, CR, and FIP play key role in Combustion performance of engine. It meant that 
the model developed could draw a good correlation between input and output. The graph 
in Figure 14.2 displays the experimental values relative to the expected response values. 
The data points are distributed uniformly along the 45-degree axis, which means that the 
model’s predictions are correct. ANOVA model evaluation is given in Table 14.5. A higher 
value of Adj. R2
 (0.993) was calculated, which implies that model is able to explain 99.3% 
of variation in peak combustion pressure. Estimated values of Predicted R2 and Adj R2 are 
0.9754 and 0.993, correspondingly, which are in reasonable agreement with each other. An 
Adequate Precision of 74.885 indicates that the model has adequate signal. Therefore, the 
selected model can be utilized to find out the optimum setting of input variables and output 
response. RSM Approach for Combustion Analysis of CI Engine 179

14.3.2 Effect of Engine Input Parameters on Peak Cylinder Pressure
Effect of input variables on Pmax have been portrayed in Figure 14.3. A contour plot, as 
shown in Figure 14.3a, reflects the aggregated impact of CR and load on Pmax when the hold 
value is FIP at 225 bar. ANOVA results reveal that the F value (1684.89) of factor CR is the 
highest among the three control factors which mean that CR has the highest impact on Pmax 
followed by load and FIP. In the contour plot, blue colour zones display lower values of output 
response, however red colour zones show higher cylinder pressure. A contour graph reveals 
that increasing load and CR implies colour transition from blue to red, which postulates 
output response increasing. As observed, increasing load and CR improves combustion per￾formance due to increased combustion temperature and pressure. An increased equivalence 
ratio and intake density of charge results in an increase in fuel supply inside the combustion 
chamber. The formation of a richer mixture takes place inside of the cylinder that is intended 
to quick burn in the early stage leftover to be burned in later stages of combustion [11]. 
Figure 14.3b shows engine response, i.e., Pmax with load and CR at a constant speed of 1500 
RPM and 225 bar FIP. Increase in Pmax is clearly noticeable in surface plot with increase in 
input parameters. The graph reveals that the observed value of Pmax is 70.14 bar at 12 Kgf 
load and 18 CR when the engine is fueled with a B30 blend at 225 bar FIP. Increase in CR is 
responsible for relatively higher residual gas temperature and combustion cylinder wall tem￾peratures, resulting in higher charge temperature at the time of injection and improved fuel 
air mixing of biodiesel. Variation in output response with load and FIP at 16 CR and 1500 
RPM engine speed has been portrayed by a contour plot as shown in Figure 14.3c. From 
the plot, it is visible that green colour areas are evident at higher load and advanced FIP in 
the experiment range. This implies that higher output response was obtained at increased

load and advanced FIP. The bluish region is dominant at lower values of load and FIP which 
correlates to a lower value of Pmax. Higher FIP ensures better atomization of fuel and finer 
droplets of fuel are formed, which improves combustion phenomenon. Figure 14.3d shows a 
three-dimensional surface plot between Pmax and Load and FIP when the hold value is CR 
at 16. From the plot it can be concluded that higher load and advanced FIP enhances Pmax. 
At 6 Kgf load, 270 bar FIP and 16 CR, achieved a value of Pmax at 60.85 bar, however at 
lower load and FIP, Pmax was obtained at 37.12 bar. At reduced FIP and load, larger droplets 
of fuel are injected and a higher viscosity of biodiesel blend increases ignition delay. Higher 
latent heat of vaporization is more significant at lower loads, which results in inferior fuel air 
mixing and lower cylinder temperature leads to lower peak combustion pressure [6]. Figure. 
14.3e illustrates contour plots for Pmax variation with CR and FIP when load is held at 6 Kgf. 
With the advancement in FIP from left to right, plot colour switches from blue to green and 
eventually slightly reddish close to highest value of FIP in the experiment range. This asserts 
that output response increases with FIP. It also found similar behavior of output response 
with CR. Therefore, it is possible to find higher Pmax near the upper right corner of the 
contour graph. Pmax variation with FIP and CR has been depicted by a three-dimensional 
surface plot as shown in Figure 14.3f. Load is kept steady at 6 Kgf at 1500 RPM engine speed. 
From the plot it can be inferred that higher CR and advanced FIP improves Pmax. At 18 Kgf 
load, 225 bar FIP, and 18 CR, the obtained value of Pmax is 64.7 bar, however at lower load 
and FIP, Pmax was found to be 32.67 bar.
14.4 Optimization 
In numerical optimization, a goal is selected for load and CR and FIP was within range, 
however, the desired goal for Pmax was selected as a maximum. Range of input variables 
were selected as per the design matrix of experiments. An RSM optimizer provides the 
optimum setting of input variables for maximum output when a B30 blend is used as a 
fuel. Figure 14.4 shows the numerical optimization ramp plot for optimum values of input

parameters to deliver maximum peak cylinder pressure. The maximum value of Pmax 
obtained was 74.778 bar when an engine input parameters setting of a test engine were at 
11.97 Kgf load, 18 CR, and 269.87 bar FIP. Figure 14.5a displays contour for Pmax variation 
with input parameters when load, CR, and FIP were at their optimum values. A three￾dimensional surface plot for Pmax at optimum values of input parameters has been pre￾sented in Figure 14.5b.
14.5 Validation 
Validation of the obtained RSM output response with an actual experimental response 
at optimum combination of load, compression ratio, and FIP is a very vital part of RSM 
technique. The experiment was conducted at 11.97 Kgf load, CR of 18, and 269.87 bar for 
biodiesel blend B30 and obtained values have been compared with RSM output response. 
Table 14.6 shows the outcome of the validation experiment. The percentage error for Pmax 
was found to be 1.27%, which is well within the 5% acceptable limit. Furthermore, a com￾parative study has also been done to compare the combustion performance of biodiesel 
blend B30 with baseline mineral diesel. For this purpose, the experiment was performed 
in engines fueled with mineral diesel at the optimum engine input parameter setting, i.e., 
at 11.97 Kgf load, 18 CR, and 269.87 bar. Table 14.7 shows that Jatropha biodiesel blend 
delivers 2.36% higher Pmax.

14.6 Conclusion 
Effects of input parameters such as engine load, compression ratio, and FIP on peak com￾bustion pressure of a single cylinder, VCR diesel engine operated with Jatropha biodiesel 
blend has been assessed in the present work. It is prudent that by advancing the compres￾sion ratio by 2 and increasing FIP by 45 bar, improvement in Pmax is observed as com￾pared to original configuration of the engine. The RSM model proposed the optimum input 
parameters were 18 CR and 269.87 bar FIP at 11.97 Kgf load at a B30 biodiesel blending 
condition. The result shows that at optimum engine setting, the Pmax was achieved to be 
74.78 bar. Validation of RSM response with experimental results was done at optimum 
input parameter settings and found error of 1.27%. Jatropha biodiesel blend B30 demon￾strated the ability to produce 2.36% higher peak combustion pressure than conventional 
diesel. Biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel and it has a higher cetane number which results in 
better combustion performance. Based on all findings, it can be inferred that Jatropha bio￾diesel developed with heterogeneous catalyst can substitute 30% diesel in diesel engines and 
have better combustion characteristics than diesel.

15.1 Introduction
Energy is the prime requirement of any system. It serves as the backbone to the modern 
world economy as well as the domestic sector. Whether simple or complicated, every sys￾tem requires some form of energy input. With increased urbanization, modernization and 
Email: jhaidbhat2013@gmail.com186 Optimization of Industrial Systems
particularly industrialization has led to the tremendous consumption of energy, particu￾larly exhaustible sources of energy. There are mainly two types of energy sources available:
• Nonrenewable sources
• Renewable sources
Non-renewable energy sources, also called conventional energy sources, are exhaustible 
and include coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc. These sources, once used, cannot be reused or 
recycled, making these energy sources vulnerable to extinction. Hence, one cannot use such 
sources limitlessly without giving any due consideration to their availability. Further, it has 
been predicted that these sources may last up to 75-100 years from now, so an alternative 
to such conventional sources of energy must be tracked. One such alternative is renewable 
sources of energy. The renewable energy sources, also known as non-conventional sources, 
are inexhaustible and replenished naturally. These include solar energy, hydroelectricity, 
wind energy, biomass energy, geothermal energy, etc. Around 30 nations have utilized these 
sources of energy to meet 20% of their energy requirements. To meet the growing energy 
demand, high-end research is being carried out to utilize renewable energy sources more 
efficiently and to their fullest. Besides being readily available, these resources are environ￾ment friendly, meaning they are the least hazardous to both living and non-living creation. 
As an example, burning coal produces a lot of environmental and human issues in compar￾ison to hydroelectricity or solar power, which cause the least damage. With all these advan￾tages and benefits, renewable energy sources have turned out to be the centre of research 
attraction in recent times. The energy available due to the presence of the sun in the universe 
corresponds to solar energy. Solar energy accounts for the major share of world energy. 
Approximately 1575-49837 EJ of solar energy are intercepted by earth annually which is far 
greater than the whole world’s annual consumption [559.8EJ]. Solar energy not only serves 
our energy demands but also proves to be very vital from an environmental aspect, as it 
provides less pollutive energy at a lower cost. Further, it keeps a check on fossil fuel prices. 
It forms a promising alternative to the present energy demand and conventional sources 
of energy. The solar energy intercepted on earth is either in the form of diffuse radiations 
or in the form of direct radiations. Diffuse radiations reach the surface of the earth after 
distraction or scattering caused due to the presence of obstacles like dust particles, water 
vapors, and/or air molecules during their travel towards the earth. The direct radiations do 
not suffer from any such phenomenon and are received on the surface of the earth without 
any distraction. Apart from this, about 30% of radiant solar energy is reflected, while the 
rest of the energy is absorbed by clouds, oceans, mountains, plants, etc. The amount of solar 
energy that can be utilized by humans is limited by factors like geography, time, cloud cover, 
and area of land available. The geography of a location decides its position or distance from 
the sun or equator, i.e., the amount of incoming solar radiation. Similarly, the time of year/
day or season also affects the availability of solar energy. Higher cloud cover reduces the 
number of incoming radiations, while the availability of land constitutes the prime factor 
for the collection of solar energy.
One of the major limitations of solar energy is that its availability varies with time, as 
it is available during the day but not at night. Further seasonal and weather conditions 
also affect the utilization of solar energy, giving rise to the concept of energy storage. Solar 
energy is utilized mostly by storing or collecting it in the form of thermal energy, making Thermal Performance Evaluation of Solar Air Heater 187
an efficient storage and collection process of vital importance. Out of the various collecting 
and storage systems available, the Solar Air Heater or Collector is the simplest and is easy 
to use and construct. The various applications where solar energy is used include heating 
of space, water heating, solar power plants, crop drying, furnaces, pumping, cooking, etc.
15.2 Solar Air Heater
A solar air heater is a device to capture and convert solar energy into thermal power by 
an absorbing medium, utilizing it to heat the air. The ambient air is not able to directly 
absorb the sufficient amount of solar energy, so an intermediate technology is required. 
This intermediate technology is a Solar Air Heater. The heated air can be put to multiple 
uses depending upon the utility and its applications may include building ventilation, 
drying crops, seasoning wood, and general heating purposes. Of all available solar tech￾nologies or solar systems, the Solar Air Heater is the most economical and easy. The basic 
principle of a solar air heater includes absorption of solar radiations by the application of 
absorbing medium and absorbing plate and convection of thermal energy to the work￾ing medium [air]. Then, heated or warm air can be put to use according to the utility. 
Generally, two types of solar collectors are used to convert solar energy into thermal 
energy, these include:
• Concentrating collectors
• Flat plate collectors
15.2.1 Air Heating Flat Plate Collector
A traditional air heating collector is simple in a design similar to the liquid flat plate collec￾tor except that air is used as an energy transfer medium instead of liquid, i.e., energy from 
the sun is transferred to the air via an absorber plate. The air heater converts solar energy 
into thermal energy by following simple thermodynamic principles that include absorption 
of solar energy by the absorber plate, then convection of thermal energy from plate to air. 
The solar air heater is the most cost-effective device to hitch solar energy.
A simple solar air heater entails an iron frame, flat absorber plate, glass cover, inlet, and 
air outlet. An absorber plate, usually colored black to absorb more solar radiation, is placed 
in an iron frame covered with insulation on 3 sides while leaving the upper face covered 
with glass without any insulation cover to let it absorb incident solar radiation. The heat 
from the absorber plate is then convicted to the air flowing in the cavity between the plate 
and glass cover where heated air can be utilized according to the need or requirement. This 
forms the basic working of a simple solar air heater.
15.3 Experimentation
The experimental setup consists of a wooden frame of 609mm × 609mm × 25mm dimen￾sions with an absorber plate of 550mm × 550mm × 1mm attached to it as shown in Figure 
15.1 and Figure 15.2. The whole assembly is placed inside an iron frame surrounded by rock 188 Optimization of Industrial Systems
wool insulation on all sides except the top face. The upper face of the absorber plate is cov￾ered with a 6mm glass cover, leaving a 24mm gap between the glass cover and the absorber 
plate. The absorber plate is a 1mm thick aluminium sheet of black colour on the front face. 
An inlet 30mm diameter is provided on the bottom of the set up to let the ambient air or air 
at a lower temperature to enter the solar air heater. Similarly, an outlet of 30mm diameter is 
provided at the right-hand side of the solar air heater near the top end to let the hot air come 
out. To reduce heat loss from the solar air heater, it is well-insulated on all sides with insulating 
material (rock wool) between the wooden block and the outer iron frame except on the top 
side which is left open to let the solar radiation fall on the absorber plate. The wooden block 
or frame used to hold the absorber plate and provide the necessary passage for air to flow was 
selected because of easy availability, cost factor, and insulating property. Further, to reduce the 
leakage of air from the duct, a glass cover was sealed to the frame using glass clay.

Figure 15.2 Absorber plate with type of roughness used.Thermal Performance Evaluation of Solar Air Heater 189
15.4 Instrumentation Used
Various types of instruments were used during work that include an air blower, thermo￾couple, anemometer, digital vernier caliper, data logger, electric socket, and solarimeter.
15.5 Experimental Procedure
All the data collected during the investigations was according to the ASHRAE standards 
of testing solar air heaters. Being an actual solar air heater, data was recorded under a 
natural solar environment, i.e., the sun was used as a source of energy. Investigations were 
carried out in March and April 2019. Before the start of investigations, the set up was kept 
under solar radiation for 6 hours to remove any sort of moisture and to reach a steady 
state. Different parameters recorded during the investigation were:
• Inlet and outlet temperature
• The intensity of solar radiation
• The temperature of the absorber plate
• Flow rate
At the very beginning of the experiment the whole setup was placed outside under a 
clear sky so that sunlight is directly incident on the absorber plate for a maximum time. 
After giving due consideration to the position of the solar air heater, the solar air heater 
was set at 45° to the horizontal. The exact position was latitude N 32° 56' 20, longitude 
74° 57' 17 OR 312 NW. An air blower was connected to the inlet to supply the air at a 
faster rate, while three thermocouples were set at their required positions [inlet, outlet, 
and plate] to measure the temperature. Four absorber plates with four types of roughness 
designs were investigated at 3 different flow rates, each for three days. While the relative 
roughness pitch was kept fixed, the relative roughness was varied uniformly from 4mm 
to 16mm. The readings obtained were utilized to draw some valuable conclusions and 
results based on which efficient solar air heater design was predicted. The type of rough￾ness used was a 4mm aluminium wire bent at an angle of 85.108° into a V-shape with a 
90mm length. The angle of attack was almost 45°, i.e., airflow was directed at an angle of 
45°.
15.6 Results and Discussion
The main aim behind the investigations was to determine the effect of artificial rough￾ness used on the various parameters of solar air heaters and to decide which configura￾tion was most beneficial and feasible to utilize the solar energy the most efficiently. The 
investigations are carried out for 4 absorber plates with different roughness heights. 
Further, each plate has been subjected to three different flow rates, one day for each 
flow rate. The variation of efficiency with time for all plates have been presented in 
Figures 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, and 15.6 respectively.190 Optimization of Industrial Systems

15.6.1 Comparative Study of Efficiency of Each Plate at Different Flow Rates
It is clear from Figure 15.7 that efficiency shows an increase with the increase in flow rate for 
each plate. At LFR, efficiency increases from 10.5 % (Plate 1) up to 33 % (Plate 4).

An increase in efficiency is due to an increase in the roughness height of the plate. 
Now, moving further from LFR to MFR, again efficiency shows a rise from Plate 1 to 
Plate 4, the reason being an increase in both flow rate and roughness height, as both the 
parameters cause turbulence along the surface of the absorber plate. At high flow rates, 
Plate 3 shows the maximum efficiency (51.6%), limiting further increase in roughness 
height, so it is concluded that Plate 3 at HFR with a roughness height of 8mm is the 
most efficient.
15.7 Conclusion and Scope for Future
In the present work, investigations of actual solar air and heaters were carried out using 
artificial roughness of different relative roughness and at different flow rates. The results in 
comparison with smooth absorber plates without any roughness showed a lot of improve￾ment. The average mean temperature at the outlet showed an increase and the efficiency of 
the solar air heater increased without involving any extra cost. The. following conclusions 
are drawn from the investigations carried out:Roughened solar air heaters are more efficient 
than the simple smooth solar air heater. In the present case, mean temperature at the outlet 
increased up to 33°C compared to a simple solar air heater, thereby increasing the heat 
transfer between air and the absorber plate.
➢ An increase in roughness height from 4mm to 16mm resulted in an increase 
in heat transfer, mainly due to turbulence created on the absorber plate.
➢ The gap between the glass cover and the roughness of the absorber plate 
beyond which no visible increase was found in heat transfer was 10mm.Thermal Performance Evaluation of Solar Air Heater 193
➢ Absorber Plate 3 with a roughness height of 8mm at a flow rate 0.05kg/s was 
the most optimal design, which showed an efficiency of about 51.6%, an 
increase of 22% compared to smooth Absorber Plate 1.
➢ Further, keeping in view the pumping cost, i.e., energy required to pump the 
air into the solar air heater, a limit is set beyond which increasing airflow rate 
is not feasible.
➢ A further amount of solar radiation available also affects the performance of 
a solar air heater so the position and location should be decided so that max￾imum solar radiations are incident on the absorber plate.
15.8 Future Scope
➢ Hybrid roughness can be used to achieve better results.
➢ Phase change materials can be used to further brighten the scope of solar air 
heaters on a daily basis.
➢ CFD can be applied to the study of the nature of airflow.

Leaves for Efficient Midrib Separation

Abstract
The midribs present in the leaves of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) are strong structures and 
are used for multiple applications. The tapered leaflets present on either side of the midrib need 
to be separated out for effective performance in different midrib applications like in broom mak￾ing, arts and crafts, and polyester reinforcement. The different physical attributes of coconut leaves, 
like length, width, and diameter of the midribs, influence the performance of various mechanisms 
involved in the midrib separation process and there exists a direct relationship between these attri￾butes and that of the mechanism used for separation. Significant variations exist in the magnitude 
of physical attributes of different varieties of coconut leaves around the world. The development of a 
mechanism for efficient midrib separation demands a standardisation of the various physical attri￾butes of varieties of coconut leaves. Such a standardisation will assist future developments in the field 
of midrib separation mechanisms and will lead towards design simplification.
Keywords: Coconut, coconut leaves, midrib separation, physical attributes 
16.1 Introduction
Cocos nucifera (L.) or coconut palm is also known by the name Kalpa Vriksha (Tree of 
heaven) for the multiple purposes it serves (Nair, 2010). Every part of it is being used for 
some specific purpose, which maintains its dominance in the tropical scene (DebMandal and 
Mandal, 2011). The trunk of a developed tree is used for making houses, the inflorescences or 
unopened spadices are selected to extract a juice which is transformed into jaggery, sugar, vin￾egar, and sweet or fermented toddy and the leaves are interweaved to thatch roofs (Thampan, 
1981). The midribs of the coconut leaves have also been used for a number of purposes. The 
fibre extracted from the outer husk of the nut and its shell and kernel are major sources of 
income from the tree. The coconut palm is a monocot (S Patel, 1938). The palm is without 
branches or vegetative buds on the stem. Of the 15.87 lakh acres under coconut cultivation 
in India, Kerala accounts for nearly 70 per cent of the area, about 14 per cent in Mysore

and the rest in the states of Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, 
Assam, the Andamans, and the Lakshadweep (Horticulture Division, Dept. of Agriculture & 
Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Government of India, 2017).
The coconut palm has a single straight stem, greyish in colour, topped by a head of leaves. 
The first few leaves which appear as entire leaves have their pinnae bonded together, in a grow￾ing coconut seedling. The subsequent ones have a habit of dividing into leaflets after about six 
to eight leaves have been formed. The trunk becomes visible in 3-4 years with a single terminal 
growing point, from where new leaves advance (Niral and Jerard, 2018). On getting older, the 
leaf curves down and gradually it dries up, getting ready for shedding. After the appearance 
of a leaf tip in two and a half to three and a half years, it would have covered an angle of 120° 
to 170° with the stem. This causes the tip of the leaf to point downward towards the ground. 
With an. increase in number of leaves in the tree, the angle covered by each leaf also increases. 
The crown contains 30 to 40 opened leaves in fully-grown trees. The crown generally has 4 
sets of leaves. The first set has 10 to 12 leaves counted from the oldest leaf, from the axils of 
which bunches have already been harvested. 10 to 14 leaves in the second set support the 
fruit bunches in different stages of development. In the axils of 10 to 12 opened leaves of third 
set, spadices are found in different stages of development. The last set comprises of leaves, in 
which the few outermost ones will be in different stages of unfolding and the rest have not yet 
protruded (Menon and Pandalai, 1960).The major applications of coconut leaves include: as a 
roofing material for houses, to wrap rice, for cooking and storage, and in arts and crafts.
A. rachis, popularly known as leaf-stalks and leaflets, are the major parts of the leaf. The 
midrib of a leaflet forms a strong structure. The upper epidermis is highly cuticularized and 
continuous with the sides of leaflets. Two layers of hypoderm are continuous with the upper 
hypoderm of the sides of the leaflet and are found below the epidermis. Two or three layers 
of parenchyma surrounding the ring of fibres then follows. A ring of seven or eight vascular 
bundles are constrained within the fibrous cover. The innermost or basal bundle is the biggest 
among all, with a wide covering of phloem tissue and a visible ‘cap’ of thickened fibres. The 
cells forming the ground tissue are also in a thickened state. In about three months, before the 
emergence of leaves, the stomata are formed and are mostly restricted to the lower portion of 
the leaflets. In each square mm of the leaflets, there are nearly 200 stomata. Before its open￾ing, in the young leaflet, the attachment of each half of the leaflet to the midrib is narrow and 
tapering. A group of fibres strengthens the point of attachment. The fibre bundle at the point 
of attachment of the sides acts as a pivot on which the sides move. The old leaf has motor 
tissue which runs the whole length of the midrib enabling the sides of the leaflet to remain 
in position. Sudden movements are checked by the presence of dense cuticles of the epider￾mal folds (Menon and Pandalai, 1960). The major applications of the midribs include broom 
making and arts and crafts. Recent investigations have shown that polyester reinforced with 
coconut leaf midribs have better flexural and impact strength (Dubey and Agnihotri, 2016).
16.2 Materials and Methods
16.2.1 Sample Specimen 
A sample of four specimens from each variety, totalling 40 specimens belonging to 10 dif￾ferent varieties (6 dwarf, 1 tall, 3 hybrid) are collected from The Central Plantation Crops Indian Coconut Leaves for Efficient Midrib Separation 197
Research Institute (CPCRI), Govt. of India, Kayamkulam and are considered for the study, 
as shown in Figure 16.1.
16.2.2 Determination of Physical Attributes
The design of the midrib separating machine and its components are mainly based on the 
physical attributes of different varieties of coconut leaves such as length, width of the leaves, 
and diameter at different regions of midribs.
16.2.2.1 Length
The length of the leaflets was determined using a measuring tape of least count 1 mm as 
shown in Figure 16.2. The distance between the end points of the leaflet’s midrib is mea￾sured for each of the 40 specimens and recorded.

The width of the leaflet was measured using a digital Vernier Calliper of least count 0.02 
mm as shown in Figure 16.3. The maximum distance from edge of the midrib to the leaf end 
edge to one side is measured for each of the 40 specimens and recorded.
16.2.2.3 Diameter
The diameter of the midrib at different regions was measured using a digital calliper as 
shown in Figure 16.4. Measurements are taken separately for the thicker middle and end 
portions of the midrib for each of the 40 specimens and recorded.
16.3 Results and Discussion

found to be 27.155 mm. It has been found that among the collected specimens, the hybrid 
variety of Chowghat Orange Dwarf X West Coast Tall and the dwarf variety Chowghat 
Green Dwarf (CGD) possessed the maximum and minimum magnitudes of leaf width, 
respectively.
16.3.3 Diameter
The diameters of the specimens belonging to different varieties of coconut palm are mea￾sured and they are recorded in Table 16.1. The average diameter at the thicker region of 
midrib is found to be 2.8335 mm and the average diameter at the middle region is found 
to be 1.7165 mm. It has been found that among the collected specimens, the tall variety 
West Coast Tall (WCT) and the dwarf variety Chowghat Orange Dwarf (COD) possessed 
the maximum and minimum magnitudes of diameter of the thick region of the midrib, 
respectively. When the middle region of the midrib is considered it has been found that 
the hybrid variety of Chowghat Orange Dwarf X West Coast Tall and the dwarf variety 
of Chowghat Green Dwarf (CGD) possessed the maximum and minimum magnitudes of 
diameter, respectively.

16.4 Conclusion
For designing new innovative midrib separating mechanisms, it is important to know 
the various physical attributes of coconut leaves. The study revealed that there was a 
significant difference in lengths, widths, and diameters of different varieties of Indian 
coconut leaves, so establishing a mean value for each of these dimensions enables the 
development of feasible machines for midrib separation. There exists a direct relationship 
between these values of physical attributes and the dimensions of the mechanism used for 
midrib separation. The lengths and widths of the leaves become significant in deciding 
the size of the midrib separating machine. The average value of diameter is significant in 
determining the blade clearance for the midrib separator. These values will be useful for 
future developments in the field of midrib separation mechanisms and for further design 
simplifications.

Abstract 
It is known that intensity of solar radiation on a particular surface varies throughout the day as 
well as in different seasons. Conventional solar thermal systems in India are normally installed for 
a fixed solar angle. Due to their fixed angle structure, these systems are unable to face solar rays at 
the same intensity throughout the day, as well as in different seasons, leading to less energy efficient 
thermal systems. A solar tracking system is a specific mechanism intended to move the solar thermal 
systems/photo voltaic (PV) modules in such a way that they continuously face the sun with the aim 
of maximizing the irradiation received by them. The developed solar tracking system is composed 
of three major components: the rotational mechanism, the solar thermal system/PV module holder, 
and the tracking scale. The two degrees of freedom is achieved due to the formation of a rotational 
axis in horizontal, vertical, or oblique directions. The tracker can also be used for a single degree 
of freedom for obtaining movement in any one of the aforementioned directions. The developed 
tracker is an inexpensive device and can be retrofitted in existing or newly built solar system/PV 
modules to enhance their thermal efficiency.

17.1 Introduction
The world is fast becoming a global village due to ever increasing daily requirements of energy 
by all populations across the world, while the earth in its form cannot change [1]. Therefore, 
to fulfil this demand of energy, humans have consistently relied on non-renewable sources 
of energy (coal, oil, petroleum, wood, etc.) resulting in a huge imbalance in the environment 
resulting in climatic change, increasing global warming, gradual rising in the surface tem￾perature of the earth, melting of Antarctic ice causing sea level to rise, etc. [2]. This scenario 
is a wake-up call to switch to a clean source of energy [3]. In the United Nation Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a draft was proposed to reduce dependency on 
fossils-fuel for energy consumption [4]. It was accepted that renewable energy sources are 
*Corresponding author: surtyatherms@gmail.com206 Optimization of Industrial Systems
the most outstanding alternative and the only solution to the growing challenges of energy 
demand [5]. Renewable energy is included as the 7th sustainable goal with the aim to ensure 
that everyone can access affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by the year 2030 
[6]. Therefore, researchers started exploring and coming up with the idea to harness maxi￾mum renewable sources of energy to a greater extent at a lesser cost [7].
India, one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies, with a population of 1.4 bil￾lion, will be vital for the future of global energy markets. The Government of India has 
made impressive progress in recent years in increasing citizens’ access to electricity. It has 
also successfully implemented a range of energy market reforms and carried out a huge 
amount of renewable electricity deployment, notably in solar energy under the national 
solar mission [8]. The Government of India is promoting solar energy as an alternative 
source of energy which is easily available, cheap, and clean. It will also reduce dependency 
on other forms of non-renewable energy, but still the biggest challenge is to have an efficient 
system to harness a maximum amount of solar energy so that one can utilise more and 
more solar energy effectively and efficiently.
In India, currently, solar thermal systems/PV modules are fixed at an angle as per the 
location’s latitude, but the rest of the developed countries are using an automatic sun track￾ing system with dual axis of freedom to harness maximum solar energy so that the perfor￾mance of solar thermal system/PV module would maximize [9]. A tracking system tracks 
the sun rays and aligns itself in best orientation to absorb maximum solar radiation [10]. 
In addition, sky clearance also has an effect on the received solar radiation. Therefore, it is 
important to know the effects of both factors in order to install the solar thermal system/
PV module for each location [11]. Regardless of the above factors, it is reported that two 
axis automatic tracking systems can produce 30–50% more power than fixed modules [12]. 
It is evident from the literature survey [13-17] that automated tracking systems have more 
advantage over the fixed module. However, an automated sun tracking system is electrically 
operated, which means that it has to rely on some form of energy whether it comes via PV 
module or fossil fuels Therefore, an automated sun tracking system tends to have higher 
installation and maintenance costs as its design is very complex and needs to spend more 
on the electricity bill.
Realizing some of the constraints associated with the existing automated sun tracking 
systems, a manual sun tracking system with two degrees of freedom has been designed 
and fabricated that operates manually and does not require power to operate the tracker. 
A manual sun tracking system tracks the maximum intensity of solar radiation and can be 
stabilized accordingly. Hence, the efficiency of a solar thermal system/PV module can be 
improved by installing a manual tracking system with two degrees of freedom.
17.2 Design Methodology
17.2.1 Overview
A solar tracking system is a device which tracks the sun’s position and aligns itself in best 
orientation to capture maximum solar radiation. To enable this tracking system, we need 
to focus on several important parameters such as solar irradiance, solar azimuthal angle, 
solar elevation angle, declination angle, and Zenith angle to align the solar tracking system Manual Solar Tracking System with Two Degrees of Freedom 207
with the sun’s position. The most important angles in determining the position of the sun 
are altitude (elevation) and the Azimuth angle [18]. Before calculating sun altitude and the 
Azimuthal angle we need to define the declination angle and hour angle. The sun’s position 
at a particular time can be predicted by calculating different angles. 
Declination angle (δ) is the angle made between the plane of the equator and the line joining 
the two centres of the earth and the sun, as shown in the Figure 17.1. It is denoted by δ and is 
independent of time and location. The declination varies between –23.45° ≤ δ ≤ 23.45° and is 
positive during summer and negative during winter. On the same day at a particular area, the 
declination angle is equal everywhere. Change in season causes the change in this angle [18].
The declination angle can be calculated by
» 23.45 sin 360 284 n
365
where n = number of days.
Hour angle (ω)
The hour angle on the earth’s surface is defined as the angle through which the earth would 
turn to bring the meridian of the point directly under the sun. In other words, the hour 
angle is the sun’s angular deviation from south. It is shown in Figure 17.2.
Solar altitude (elevation) angle (α) is the angle between the horizon/horizontal axis and sun 
rays, as shown in Figure 17.3. It varies between 0 9 ° ≤α ≤ °0 .
Zenith angle (φ) is the angle between the zenith and the centre of the sun’s disc.
Azimuthal angle (Z) is the horizontal coordinate defining the Sun’s relative direction 
along the local horizon. It specifies the sun’s position.

Apart from considering the four angles, there are other important considerations before 
the design of the tracking system, i.e., it is necessary to calculate heat flux incident on a 
particular area/total solar radiation (direct + diffuse) falling on that area, extra-terrestrial 
radiation reaching the earth’s atmosphere, and the sky clearance factor. Total terrestrial 
radiation on earth’s surface is denoted by Gsolar [18].

It is evident that tracking of the four angles (declination, hour, elevation, Azimuthal and 
Zenith angle) can track the sun’s true position. Therefore, in a typical fixed angle solar system, 
most of the sun rays get wasted because of variations in different angles of solar irradiance.
17.2.2 Modelling
As the sun moves across the sky during the day, it is advantageous to have the solar tracking 
system to track the location of the sun so that the frame is always perpendicular with the 
position of the sun. A prototype has been modelled in SOLIDWORKSTM before the fabrica￾tion process. The modelled image is shown in Figure 17.4. Dimension of the tracker struc￾ture has been taken as 2860 mm × 2160 mm × 1520 mm. The modelled structure is shown 
for a tracking system with a typical system of a solar thermal system with evacuated tubes.

17.2.3 Simulation 
A simulation has been performed on the modelled prototype to study the stress concentra￾tion on the tracker. The material has been selected as structural steel. The meshed structure 
is shown in Figure 17.5. There are 20336 nodes and 8016 elements. The model has been 
solved for static structure analysis using ANSYS Mechanical APDL. The analysis has been 
done for a loading equal to 400 N. The analysis results showing stress concertation are 
presented in Figure 17.6. It can be seen that a maximum deformation of 0.4 mm has been 
observed under the total deformation category, which can be considered well within the 
safe limit to operate the tracker for a loading of 400 N. It can also be said that proposed 
tracker can be scaled up for a higher load bearing capacity by suitable modification in the 
dimension of the different components. Based on the simulated results, fabrication param￾eters have been finalized.
17.3 Working Prototype
After computational modelling and analysis, a prototype has been fabricated by assem￾bling scrap and cheap material like ball bearing, iron bar, nut-bolt, PVC pipe, wooden 
sheet, iron fixing clip, etc. to show the manual tracking system with two degrees of free￾dom. The two mechanisms are responsible for tracking the path of sun irradiance by 
changing its orientation to capture maximum energy. The developed tracker is shown in 
Figure 17.7.

17.4 Working Principle
A manual sun tracking system has two mechanisms to track the sun’s path and can change 
their orientation to capture maximum energy. The systems are enabled with two motions to 
track the inclination of incident radiation from the sun to absorb the maximum amount of 
solar energy; the system will not only rotate from morning to evening, but also changes its 
angle from horizontal/base plate when the weather changes (i.e., vertical motion from main 
shaft and base plate). A manual sun tracking system tracks the incident sun radiation and 
can be synchronized in best orientation relative to the angle of inclination of the sun. The 
system has two degrees of freedom which is responsible for the movement of the frame and 
is expected to give the desired output by absorbing maximum solar radiation. Following are 
the procedures to obtain two movements:
1. Angular movement of frame about its main shaft axis (lateral movement of 
frame about main shaft)
• The sun moves approximately by 150° in between sunrise and sunset. In 
the proposed model, the frame can be rotated and set as per the actual 
movement of the sun during daytime (movement of the sun takes place 
from daw n to dusk).

45° 50° 55° 65° 75°
Figure 17.10 Vertical movement of frame about main shaft and base plate.Manual Solar Tracking System with Two Degrees of Freedom 213
• The mechanism behind the angular movement of the frame in the system 
is due to its (frame) connection with the bearing which is further rigidly 
fixed with the main shaft.
2. Vertical movement from main shaft and horizontal/base plate
• The frame will move vertically in an upward and downward direction 
with respect to the main shaft and the base of the system. 
• Inclination of frame with the base can be changed according to the sea￾son, i.e., summer to winter as the sun path changes from overhead to 
Azimuthal.
• The connecting rod/variable rod has a threaded body and a steering 
wheel. Hence, when we rotate the steering wheel, the actuator will move a 
distance depending upon the pitch. 
Heat flux falling on the frame has been measured using a solar flux meter. It is evident 
from the data presented in Table 17.2 that when a frame with two degrees of freedom has 
been used there is an increase of 21% on the incident heat flux at noon. The effect of Zenith 
angle variation leads to an increase in incident heat flux.

17.5 Conclusions
A manual sun tracking system has been developed for a 400 N loading condition. The pro￾posed model of manual sun tracking system will assist to improve the performance of solar 
thermal system/PV modules over typical fixed modules because manual sun tracking sys￾tems are able to track the sun’s position and can capture maximum solar radiation by facing 
its frame towards the sun. It will not only reduce the consumption of electricity but also 
reduce dependency on non-renewable sources of energy. The system will work effectively 
on sunny days.

Abstract
The current work is dedicated to critical review on the latest development of various tribological 
wear test rigs built for numerous applications. Tribometers, or devices to measure friction and wear, 
are the basic technology used in most of the tribological investigations. With the aid of the CAD line 
diagram, their working principles and contact mechanisms are explained. The performed experi￾ments correlate process variables and parameters of normal load, wear volume, dissipated energy, 
and slip speed. Experimental creep curves from twin disc measurements are used to extract the 
friction parameters required by the numerical algorithms. The effect of pressure and surface con￾tamination on the coefficient of friction is analyzed. The design and construction of a tribometer are 
discussed, whereupon a dynamic analysis justifies its effectiveness or its applicability for friction and 
wear measurements. To minimize frictional power losses, it is imperative to improve the tribological 
characteristics of the material
Keywords: Tribological wear, friction, contact mechanisms, normal load, slip speed
18.1 Introduction
A tribometer is a device used to calculate characteristic tribological properties of interacting 
bodies like friction, wear, the effect of lubrication, etc. [1, 2]. The mechanical arrangement 
of the tribometer fundamentally involves relative motion between two interacting surfaces 
which are assessed based on the magnitude of frictional force between them. During the 
test, parameters like the speed of sliding and the contact force between the bodies can be 
controlled by the operator and are varied to get suitable results [2].
 The early 1940s was a crucial time in development in the field as many researchers had 
introduced numerous methodologies on abrasive wear. Krushev and Babichev proposed 
a straight proportionality between the properties of the hardness of pure metals to their 
relative abrasive resistance. Afterward, Larsen demonstrated that comparable information 
for steels could be subdivided into two lines of different slants relying upon their Vickers 
*Corresponding author: sumitsinghal1307@gmail.com218 Optimization of Industrial Systems
hardness number. The works of other investigators have refined the relative hardness 
approach even further. For two-body abrasive wear models, a characteristic angle of the 
sharp asperities is responsible for the removal of material. The propensity of hard particles 
to either carve the chip or plough through and uproot surface material plays a major role in 
calculating the dislocation density, crystalline structure, and deformational energy stored 
in the material during abrasion [3].
Tribometer machines seek the application of a motor which is associated with the belt 
drive to rotate the disc. It is, for the most part, respected that various sorts of tribometer 
machines are not similarly appropriate for all applications since experimental results vary 
due to different properties of relative motion [4, 5]. Pin on a disc set up is a typical sort of 
tribological system which has been utilized for calculation of the coefficient of friction and 
wears for different pairs of materials [6, 7]. The ball on the disc is preferable for application 
where high load is required and the ball is pressed against the disc against the normal load 
utilizing the lever mechanism and its application in the field of design of roller bearings [8]. 
The ball-shaped pin has a self-aligning tendency, in contrast to the cylindrical, square, or 
elliptical shape of a pin [9]. The twin-disc arrangement is commonly utilized with inverse 
rotation direction to create a condition similar to the rolling of the wheel on a rail and it is 
generally utilized in this manner [10]. 
The four-ball tester configuration is used to determine the wear rate in the presence of 
the lubricated environment. The test apparatus consists of three balls that are fixed and a 
solid ball squeezed against a rotating ball [11]. A fretting wear tester is used to measure 
fretting fatigue wear which occurs due to low amplitude vibration of mechanical systems. 
Fretting wear includes the combination of both adhesive and abrasive wear [2].
The use of a tribometer has a few points of interest. Automotive industries widely 
used tribometer machines for the examination of rolling sliding friction between the 
various automotive machine elements like clutches, brakes, gears, tires, engine piston￾cylinder arrangement, and so forth and their related mechanical properties. Tribometers 
are used for the identification of correct material for designing various machine ele￾ments. Tribometers utilized for test portrayal of the coefficient of friction and wear 
rate [12] recognizing contact material qualities can be utilized for the configuration 
purposes of different machine components. The majority of failures or overreaching 
disappointment in railway tracks, bearings, and gears can be attributed to rolling con￾tact fatigue, also called pitting. The difference in the distribution of tangential forces in 
stick-slip regions leads to variation in stresses on elastic bodies that ought to be affected 
by the progressions of stick and slip regions. Therefore, various tribometer machines 
are designed according to their contact mechanisms [13] where the size of the contact 
zone wear depth and wear volume of sample material under Hertzian normal variable 
pressure distribution is evaluated [14–16]. In disc on disc and ball on disc tribometer 
machines, due to sliding contact, the creep ratio is also considered. Creep is the time 
and temperature-dependent failure of machine components [16]. The coefficient of 
friction is a function of three fundamental impacting parameters that are normal load, 
slip speed, and temperature due to frictional wear and wear rate depends on the hard￾ness of material, sliding distance, wear velocity, and coefficient of wear [17–19]. There 
are abrasive wear mechanisms due to rolling and sliding contact between two elas￾tic bodies. Abrasive wear is the expulsion of material from the surface due to relative 
movement and impinging between them [20, 21].Critical Review on Tribometers and Their Contact Mechanism 219
As per the above literature overview, different tribometer machines are intended to 
assess friction and wear rate, but a disc on disc tribometer whose axes are perpendicular 
is not available. We can implement it. We use disc on disc tribological systems where one 
disc is fixed and the other is rotated by the belt-driven motor. The normal load is applied 
to the stationary disc. The line contact zone is made among them and its size, coefficient of 
friction, wear rate, and stresses on the surfaces can be determined.
18.2 Types of Wear
Wear is not a phenomenon that is dependent only on one parameter. It has multiple param￾eters, each playing a significant role in the amount of wear, like material and shape of the 
contacting surface, the pressure applied, whether lubrication is involved or not, and the 
sliding velocity. Practically, the observed wear rate is due to the mixture of these types of 
wear mechanisms. Mechanical wear mainly includes deformation in ductile metals and 
fracture in brittle metals. Mechanical wear due to friction may initiate tribochemical and 
thermal wear. Thermal wear includes melting and fractures due to thermal shocks.
18.2.1 Adhesion Wear 
Adhesion wear occurs when surfaces of two bodies in contact tend to form junctions at 
their interface. The adhesion wear occurring between two bodies depends on structural 
properties like crystal structure and orientation, cohesive strength, etc. In correspondence 
to Archard’s wear model, the amount of wear due to adhesion increases with an increase in 
normal applied load and sliding distance. 
18.2.2 Abrasion Wear 
Abrasive wear is one of the most basic types of wear that occurs between interacting bodies. 
It occurs when one of the interacting bodies possesses higher hardness than others, leading 
to the formation of plastic deformations. In the case of tangential movement, the deforma￾tion occurs due to the combined action of micro-cutting and micro-plowing. The amount 
of wear depends on the hardness of softer material and the coefficient of wear friction.
18.2.3 Fatigue Wear 
This type of wear occurs due to continuous cyclic application of stress at nonconforming 
contacts, also known as Hertzian contacts. The motion occurring at contact consists of fluc￾tuating magnitudes of sliding and rolling. Due to this cyclic loading, crack formation and 
propagation takes place and loss of material takes place. The continuous reversal in stress 
fields is attributed as the main cause of this kind of wear.
18.2.4 Chemical Corrosion Wear 
Friction can induce chemical reactions between the surrounding environment and the sur￾faces in contact. This will lead to deposition of reaction material on the surface, which will 220 Optimization of Industrial Systems
subsequently be removed, exposing a new layer of the surface to environmental attack. Due 
to the presence of friction, there will be an increase in temperature which may lead to an 
increase in reaction rate on the surface, as well as increase in the brittleness of the surface.
18.2.5 Fretting Wear 
Fretting is a type of wear that occurs in rolling elements and is caused by minor amplitude 
oscillation between the surfaces in contact. The factors affecting fretting wear characteris￾tics are surface shape, the material of mating parts, slip amplitude, normal load, frequency, 
etc. In the case of disc on disc, the major type of wear involved is abrasive wear. The main 
factors affecting the magnitude of wear in disc on disc systems are load applied on the mov￾ing disc and the speed of rotation of the moving disc.
18.3 Ball-On-Disc Tribometer Contact Mechanism
The spherical ball is being pressed on a rotating disc. The contact area will be circular with 
radius ‘a’ as shown in Figure 18.1. This type of tribometer is used to investigate tribological 
characteristics (friction wear and lubrication) of materials. Thus, ball on disc can be used 
as a model test for mechanical component surfaces that are subject to large differences in 
sliding contact. It provides better for control over-testing.
18.3.1 Partial Slip
Due to axial symmetry of the tangential traction, the stick region might be circular and 
concentric with the contact circle. On the point of sliding, when only the two points in con￾tact at the origin are ‘stuck’, ‘q’ can be split into two parts, q’ and q’’, for stick and slip region. 
That is given by the expressions given below.
18.4 Disc on Disc Tribometer
Disc on disc tribometers consist of two discs in contact having a parallel axis of rotation as 
shown in Figure 18.2. Depending upon the relative velocities of the discs, the type of fric￾tion in the system changes. If the discs have equal velocities, then it is pure rolling and if 
one of the discs is stationary, it is sliding. When the two discs in contact rotate with unequal 
velocities, then both sliding and rolling friction come into play.

18.5 Cylinder on Block Tribometer
When a cylinder is in contact with the flat surface, initially the contact zone is a straight 
line, then it expands gradually and the contact zone becomes a rectangle as shown in Figure 
18.3. The same is true when two cylinders come into contact and their axes are parallel.

18.6 Four Ball Tester
A four ball wear test is used to determine the wear rate in the presence of a lubricated environ￾ment. The test apparatus consists of three balls that are fixed to the pot and are pressed against 
a rotating ball as shown in Figure 18.4. The parameters affecting wear like speed, temperature, 
and load are kept constant while the pot is filled with lubricant. The wear is calculated as the 
measurement of wear scar diameter on the three fixed balls and can be used to calculate the 
total wear volume.
In a four-ball testing machine, the balls are placed in a tetrahedral geometry and it is 
assumed that the wear scars are circular.
18.7 Fretting Testing Machine
Fretting can happen when the vacillating motion of low-amplitude in the direction of tangent 
occurs between two contacting surfaces. This is a basic event in the apparatus that is exposed 
to vibration. Fretting can consolidate a large number of the wear procedure, such as abrasive 
or adhesive wear, where abrasive wear is due to rolling sliding contact between contacting 
abrasive surfaces and adhesive wear due to localized bonding between contacting surfaces 
which leads to material transfer between the contacting surfaces. This is because of the normal 
applied load and surface roughness. The low swaying movement produces fracture, bringing 
about wear flotsam and jetsam. The hardness of wear scrap is much higher than their parent 
metals because friction increases their temperature, which prompts abrasive wear. Fretting 
in erosive surrounding generate wear fleck. The way that there is no microscopic sliding at 
fretting contacts so the fretting wear flotsam and jetsam cannot escape effectively yet is caught 
between the surfaces. This may prompt a reduction in the friction coefficient with passing 
time. Along these lines, the measure of wear due to fretting for certain sliding distance might 
be larger in magnitude than that of grating and adhesive wear. The vacillating sliding can like￾wise cause vibration and, in this way, odds of framing weariness disappointment. This sort of 
failure is known as fretting wear. At the center of the contact zone, normal pressure is high and 
surfaces are relatively in static contact, but at the edges of the contact zone where pressure is 
low and frictional forces are surpassed by the tangential forces, micro-slip takes place.
Figure 18.4 Fourball tester.Critical Review on Tribometers and Their Contact Mechanism 223
18.7.1 Fretting Test
Fretting tests are utilized to decide the impacts of a few fretting variables on the exhibi￾tion of materials. These parameters incorporate contrasting materials, relative displacement 
amplitudes, normal load at the fretting contact, adjusting tangential traction, the size and 
shape of the contact zone, surface parameters, for example finish, and nature. The outcomes 
might be utilized as a guide in choosing material combinations, proper lubricants, and coat￾ings to reduce or wipe out fretting worries in designs.
18.7.2 Fretting Mechanism
Typically, three phases of fretting can be recognized:
1. The primary stage involves metallic contact between two surfaces that hap￾pens on the asperity level (adhesion). This occurs if the defensive oxide 
layer is separated so that exceptionally responsive uncovered materials 
come into contact. The contact happens at barely any destinations, called 
ill tempers.
2. In the second stage, wear wreckage is created and oxidized. It is hard to wear 
debris to get away from the contact since the amplitude of movement is 
restricted and hard protuberances force is against and moving along the solid 
surface, therefore these abrasives enhance wear rates.
3. Finally, fretting fatigue takes place. Because of continued stacking and shear 
stresses, the raised pressure region in fretting happens on the sides of the 
stacked region. In this way, the crack starts at the boundaries of the fretting 
zone and engenders inside.
18.7.3 Fretting Fatigue
In fretting, contact surfaces are worn and, simultaneously, they are influenced by cyclic 
grating pressure. The friction stress reaches maxima on the contact surface and diminishes 
definitely within the material. Consequently, fretting fatigue crack development conduct 
contrasts fundamentally from fatigue crack development behavior in frictionless fatigue. 
In fretting fatigue, the development pace of a crack close to the contact surface reduces sig￾nificantly with expanding crack length. The magnitude of fretting fatigue strength is usually 
half or less of the plain fatigue strength and it won’t become higher regardless of whether 
the elasticity of the material is expanded. 
A material can sustain plain fatigue for a longer duration than fretting fatigue. In fretting 
fatigue, crack initiation is easy because of friction stress due to small stress amplitude which 
is not suitable for plain fatigue failure and causes material failure.
18.7.4 Factors Influencing Fretting 
Fretting resistance is not a characteristic property of a material. Certain factors play a major 
role in deciding the behavior of contact.224 Optimization of Industrial Systems
1. Normal Load: Wear is proportional to the normal load in a linear manner.
2. Number of Cycles: Level of fretting increments with the count of cycles 
3. Temperature: At increased temperatures, the rate of development of the oxide 
layer is higher and the layer plays a defensive role.
4. Relative Humidity: Increase in humidity leads to decreased fretting corrosion
5. Dormancy of Materials: Material’s affinity to react with oxygen has a major 
role in determining the wear due to fretting
18.8 Conclusion
The present review makes an effort to cover the various types of tribometers used in various 
industries. The key motive to use tribometers is to find out the stresses and the amount 
of wear that takes place between two interacting bodies under a controlled environment. 
The paper has presented the description for various types of tribometers like disc on disc 
tribometers (parallel discs and perpendicular discs), pin on disc tribometers, block on disc 
tribometers, ball on disc tribometers, flat elliptical punches, pin on plates, and fretting test 
machines and the factors affecting wear like contact load, temperature, number of cycles, 
sliding velocity, and hardness have been discussed in brief. Also, line diagrams for a ball 
on disc tribometer, both parallel and perpendicular disc on disc tribometers, and pin on 
disc tribometers have been presented to understand the alignment and contact mechanism 
of the tribometers. The phenomenon of stick and slip has been taken into account for the 
calculation of contact mechanisms. Wear equations have been employed to calculate the 
amount of wear that occurs on the apparent area of contact in these tribometers.

Abstract
In this investigation, an optimized nano Fe3
O4
 based ferromagnetic lubricant was created by utilizing 
mechanical and ultrasonic blending. Fe3
O4
 nanoparticles in varying amounts and percentages have 
been dispersed in Karanja base oil containing oleic acid as a surfactant. The wear mark diameter 
received in the four-ball test with the set standard was viewed as the output effect in the experiment. 
Thereafter, the obtained results showed the anti-wear functionality of the enhanced Karanja oil with 
ferromagnetic particles to be used as a lubricant. The stabilities of the lubricant sample were evalu￾ated by calculating the sedimentation rate for a period of four months.

19.1 Introduction
A lubricant is a synthetic substance instigated between moving surfaces to limit rubbing, 
decrease wear, disperse heat, eliminate pollutants, and lift proficiency. The significance 
of using suitable lubes in between the two mating surfaces cannot be totally valued until 
understanding of the ramifications of not using the most suitable oil or perhaps a lube by 
any means are observed. When considering the numerous macroscale applications which 
use lubes, for example internal and external combustion engines, modern gearboxes, vehi￾cle, blowers, water-powered engines, turbines, bearing used in machinery, etc., as well as 
the various nanoscale applications and metal shaping projects, it gets easy to perceive the 
advantages that lubricating oils play in the consistency, viability, and activity of the majority 
of these applications (Jost, H. P, 2009).
Until 1400 B.C, lubricating oils were just the fats delivered from plant or creature-based 
crude materials. The New Oil Commercial Center was made after the first well of oil was 
bored in 1959. From that point of time, oils were created from mineral oils as well as some 
petrochemically altered fake oils bundled during the 1960s to the present bio-based green 
ointments. As of late, bio-based lubes have begun looking for conspicuousness for the 
ecologically kind disposition of theirs and extraordinary tribological characteristics. The

current example of the oil business is that it is growing more bio-based oils because of 
evaluations demonstrating that around 51% of all oils sold overall make the planet dirty 
through spillage, vanishing, and generally misfortunate applications (Reeves CJ, 2012). A 
genuine illustration of pollution through oil is that if the diesel motor particulate outflows, 
around 33% of the motor oil disintegrates, subsequently dirtying the climate. The enormous 
measure of oil misfortune on the planet is the purpose of improving eco-friendly well dis￾posed of lubes. Although the lube area is becoming much more earth-mindful by diminish￾ing the utilization of petrol-based lubes because of issues of saving the planet, exhaustion 
of oil wells, and expansions in oil value day by day, mineral oil continues to be presumably 
the most prominent constituent just as the foundation to all available lubricants (Menezes 
PL, 2013). 
The usage of bio-lubricants is created from plant oils just as creature fat returns to the 
artifact. Specialists have recognized for many years that biolubricants offer good rubbing 
resistance and decrease in wear characteristics. Since the beginning of the 20th century, 
examinations to the ascribes of bio-based oils have gotten impressive interest because of 
the point that 51% of all lubes overall wrap up in the environmentt by means of utilization, 
instability, spill, or perhaps off base removal (Lundgren SM, 2008). Of the lubes entering 
the planet, 95% are created from petrol-based oils and are harming a few organic environ￾ments (Schneider MP, 2006). Unmistakably, inside North America alone, more than a hun￾dred million gallons of poisonous lubricants dribble, spill, and break into the environment 
yearly. With the appearance of petrol-based oils in the mid-1800s, bio-based oils’ utilization 
as lubes began to drop fundamentally. Of late, there has been a resurgence of bio friendly 
lubes due to expanded biological activities to bring down the use of petroleum-based oils 
other than the exhaustion of oil wells and reserves, increments in oil cost, and ascends in 
ointment disposal costs (Goodstein DL, 2004). Many advancements in eco-oil-based lubri￾cants showed that bio-based oils in the examination have more prominent lubricity, lower 
rubbing resistance, higher shear soundness, higher index of viscosity, a more noteworthy 
load conveying limit, and outstanding detergency as well as discrepancy and, subsequently, 
they are uncommon alternatives to petroleum-based oils. Conventional green lubes are 
largely delivered from normally available natural substances whose properties and energy 
vary dependent on organic things, for example supplement availability, temperature, light, 
atmosphere, and water (Duzcukoglu H, Sahin O, 2011). Despite these beneficial qualities, 
presumably, the most significant disadvantages to a ton of bio-based oils are the awful warm 
oxidative stability of theirs, high pour point, and conflicting substance structure which has 
prompted the improvement of synthetically changed counterfeit biolubricants. and the uti￾lization of settling added substances just as ionic liquids (Grushcow J, 2005).
Lots of important technological advances have taken place in the area of Tribology. 
However, the pursuit is not ending and work continues to be created to enhance the sup￾plies’ tribological functionality. Lowering the friction helps in reducing big energy losses, 
while stopping the use outcomes in the improved service life of machines (Mishra and 
Shoeab 2014; Chaturvedi, Vimal, and Singh 2012). Many attempts are created to decrease 
friction and erosion by using standard oils or perhaps adding oil-soluble additives in the 
base oils. Nevertheless, these existing lubricants have come to the maximum boundaries of 
their performance attributes (Weijiu Huang et al. 2002; Li et al. 2000). Thus, the hunt for 
novel and high-performance lubricants has led a lot of researchers to check out the usage of 
nanoparticles (non-magnetic and magnetic) as additives to the present lubricants (Dai et al. Tribological Performance of Ferro-Magnetic Fluid as Lubricant 229
2016; Gulzar et al. 2016). These lubricants are called nano-lubricants and also have gained 
popularity owing to their improved overall performance. There are various parts in nano 
lubricants, including base oil, nanoparticles, and a surfactant (Bakunin et al. 2005). The 
surfactant is actually utilized to develop an interface between the nanoparticles as well as 
base oil. Magnetic nanoparticles are probably the most promising substance compared with 
the different nanoparticles to minimize friction due to their distinctive magnetic qualities. 
This is because of the reality that the flow attributes in the base oils could be modified by 
utilizing an external magnetic field (Wei Huang and Wang 2016). Besides, these particles 
are insoluble in nonpolar base oils. These particles have lower chemical activity along with 
other additives present in the base oil. Due to its nanometric size, it allows them to get into 
the contact location between the frictional surfaces, boosting the lubricity. Stable dispersion 
and the uniform of magnetic nanoparticles inside a base oil constitutes a magnetic lubri￾cant. Inside Tribology, the primary uses of magnetic fluids as lubricants are actually in the 
substance seals, gears, bearings, etc. (Odenbach 2003; Uhlmann et al. 2002). A lot of the 
scientists have focused on learning the consequences of various practice parameters (speed, 
loading elements, blending ratio, etc.) on the tribological attributes (coefficient of friction, 
use scratch region, use rate, as well as wear scratch diameter etc.) of the ferrofluids with the 
help of a four-ball testing machine (Trivedi, Parekh, and Upadhyay 2017). Researchers have 
talked about the performance of Fe3
O4
 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) (synthesized by uti￾lizing a substance co-precipitation method) dispersed to a gear oil that contains alpha olefin 
hydrocarbon. Their results showed that the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear scratch 
diameter (WSD) were decreased by the addition of magnetic nanoparticles when compared 
to the starting oil. Wei Huang et al. examined the tribological behaviour of liquids that 
contain Fe3
O4 nanoparticles in different concentrations with the assistance of an FBT. Their 
results revealed that the WSD was reduced when compared with the carrier oil.
Out of the present literature survey, few scientific studies have been conducted on the 
evaluation of tribological qualities of nano Fe3
O4
 based ferromagnetic lubricants. There is 
additionally a scarcity of work on the domain of synthesis parameters and the nano Fe3
O4
particle in base oil for obtaining the minimum wear mark diameter (WSD) by making use 
of the various methods. In this exploration, Fe3
O4
 nano-particles with fluctuating sums 
were blended in Karanja oil. The ferromagnetic particle based liquid samples were tried via 
a robotized high-temperature four-ball testing machine. Results show that Fe3
O4
 nanoparti￾cles with 0.2 wt percent in base oil display great resistance of wear execution and the friction 
parameter decreases. The steadiness of nano Fe3
O4
 based lubricants was surveyed over a 
time of 196 days by figuring their sedimentation rates.
19.2 Materials and Methods
19.2.1 Materials
Karanja oil was chosen to be the base oil for the ferromagnetic biolubricant. Karanja is 
actually a tree in the pea family, generally obtainable in Asian countries like India, China, 
Japan, etc. It is frequently recognized by the name pongamia and was relocated to the 
group Milletia. Karanja is simply among the trees in nitrogen dealing with producing seeds 
containing 30-40 % oil. It is a tree that grows roughly 15-25 meters with an enormous 230 Optimization of Industrial Systems
canopy that spreads broadly (Rai R et al., 2012). It may be deciduous for short durations. 
The flowers begin to produce in common after three to four years. The oil is produced by 
the cold compaction of Karanja seed. Table 19.1 and Table 19.2 show the acid composition 
of Karanja oil and physical and chemical properties of Karanja oil, respectively. The colour 
of the oil, being yellowish orange, shows remarkable properties like better pour point, high 
viscosity, etc.

Ferromagnetic particles have actually gained much value as a lube additive due to their 
exceptional properties. These nanoparticles, being small in size, enter in the middle of the 
surfaces, scouring one another. For different applications, the shape and size of ferromag￾netic nanoparticles show essential characteristics. Table 19.3 shows the characteristics of 
ferromagnetic nanoparticles given by suppliers, while Table 19.4 shows the composition 
of Fe3
O4
 nanoparticles. Ferromagnetic nanoparticles being spherical shows enormous 
load-bearing capacity on account of metal roller impact. In the current experimentation, 
the outer layer of ferromagnetic particles was coated utilizing oleic acid to forestall the 
agglomeration viably.
19.2.2 Nanofluids Preparation
The biolubricant used in this study was Karanja oil in the pure oil state blended with Fe3
O4
nano-particles. The nano Fe3
O4 particles to be mixed in oil were firstly coated with oleic acid 
so that they do not settle in the base oil and remain suspended and properly dispersed in 
the oil. Fe3
O4
 nanoparticles in varying amounts and percentages have been dispersed in the 
Karanja base oil containing five wt % of oleic acid as surfactant. The range of Fe3
O4
 nanopar￾ticles added were from 0.05 to 0.4% (by weight). All the samples were all around blended 
utilizing a mechanical homogenizer for 30 minutes at 1000 rpm followed by ultra-sonica￾tion for 5 minutes at 1500 watt before each test.
The mixing is driven by the electrically operated unit that rotates in a specific direction, 
allowing the material to rotate in the axial and radial directions, and the materials inside 
the tank also perform circular motions. Therefore, the material can be mixed appropriately 
and mixed with high efficiency. Ultrasonic homogenization uses sonic waves to excite the 
nano-sized particles in a lubricant sample. The machine’s electrical signal gets converted 
into physical vibration to break down the size of nano-sized particles. These disruptions 
helped mix the solutions.

19.2.3 Four-Ball Test
This setup (Figure 19.1) uses four balls (Table 19.5); the three balls made up of stainless steel 
were located in a cup, while fourth ball is connected to a rotating shaft using a chuck and 
a relative high-pressure sliding movement is generated. The lower three balls are held in a 
cup containing the oil to be filled and pressed against the upper ball. The balls were cleaned 
with acetone before being used to avoid possible impurities leading to irregularities in the 
results of experimental tests. Abrasion properties, measured as COF and wear resistance 
for test oils, were evaluated in reference to the load applied normally to the test balls; the 
temperature (75°C) and the duration (60 minutes) were kept constant according to the 
experimental design. The tests were according to standard ASTM-D4172B (Table 19.6). 
The observations were recorded using the installed data acquisition system. After each test, 
the WSD on the three lower balls was measured using an image acquisition system with 
an accuracy of 0.01 mm. Finally, the average wear area was calculated as wear area in three 
identical tests. The balls used were from the AISI 52100, with a diameter of 12.67 mm, grade 
of EB 25, and a hardness of 64.00 to 66.00 (Rockwell C Hardness Test [HRC]). The testing 
balls are composed of C-Cr steel, are. 12.67 mm in diameter and possess a roughness value 
of 0.11 µm. The chemical composition of the ball material is shown in Table 19.5.

Samples of lubricating oil, as listed in Table 19.7, were poured in a small metallic cup 
where three balls are held, clamped by a ring and a locknut. On chuck, the fourth ball is 
then fitted. The desired load value is then entered. The COF is actually estimated by multi￾plication of the hostile friction torque as well as springtime constant:

19.3 Results and Discussion
A lubricant sample of Karanja oil blended with varying concentrations of ferromagnetic 
nanoparticle additives were tested with a four-ball tester. Figure 19.3 shows the wear surface 
of the balls with the use of pure Karanja oil, while Figure 19.4 shows the wear surface of 
the balls with the use of Fe3
O4 NPs in Karanja oil. The images indicate that abrasive wear is 
taking place (Xue W et al., 2015). The diameter of the wear scar is reduced by a significant 
amount compared to the carrier liquid.
The addition of ferromagnetic nanoparticles showed a decreased frictional coefficient 
and wear scars when contrasted with unadulterated Karanja oil. The effect of ferromagnetic 
nanoparticles can be grouped into classes as follows: 
a. Ball-bearing effect of nanoparticles
b. Generation of low shear strength tribofilm, which connotes the positive 
effect of expansion of ferromagnetic nanoparticles into Karanja oil (Huang 
W et al., 2009)
As shown in Figure 19.5, Karanja oil with various percentages of additives are being 
plotted on the X–axis and minimum wear scar diameter on the steel ball is on the Y-axis. 
This shows that Karanja oil with 0.2 wt% Fe3
O4
 has comparatively better wear scar diameter 
than the other samples.

Abstract 
In this paper, a state space method is used to predict the vibrational behavior of a cantilever beam. 
To predict the response, various MATLAB commands such as ‘lsim’ (for time domain response) and 
‘freqresp’ (for frequency domain response) are used. In this work, a state space formulation is used 
to convert the n degree of freedom coupled equations into single degree un-coupled second order 
differential equations. Then, the state space entities are carried out. The main objective of this work is 
to predict the response of the system at different masses by applying unit impulsive load excitations. 
To solve the Eigen value problem in MATLAB, the ‘eig’ command is used. It is observed that the 
state space formulation is very simple and easy to apply for the N-degree of freedom system model. 
Also, it can be concluded that the state space method formulation along with MATLAB commands 
is very effective and quite simple to predict the response of the system either in time domain or in 
frequency domain.
Keywords: Finite element method, state space method, time domain, frequency domain
20.1 Introduction
Beams are the main constituent of most of the structures and are also used in the different 
engineering and architectural applications. Due to excitations, these kinds of structures 
start vibrating with resonance frequencies. Beams are continuous systems and vibrating at 
n-number of natural frequencies. To formulate all problems, a state space method is quite 
easy to simulate by using MATLAB. Raj et al. [1] used the Eigen value approach for the 
calculation of a modal-model of the system. MATLAB and ANSYS numerical simulation 
softwares are used to predict the frequency response functions. Joseph and B.S. [2] did the 
modal analysis of a cantilever beam to predict the natural frequency by using MATLAB 
and ANSYS. Mekalke and Sutar [3] did modal analysis to calculate the natural frequencies

and mode shapes of cantilever beams of different material and geometries. Gupta et al. 
employed the state space method for predicting the modal model of a five degree of spring 
mass vibratory system [4]. Modal analysis and harmonic response analysis of a machine 
component can be done with the use of finite element modelling and simulation [5–9]. 
Also, finite element modelling can be used to determine the mechanical and thermal prop￾erties of a system [10–18]. In this paper, the response of the system is predicted at different 
masses by applying unit impulsive load excitations.
20.2 Formulation of Beam
A beam is considered to have N number of elements and each node has two degrees of 
freedom, i.e., one is transverse displacement and the other is slope. The degree of freedom 
of node i is q2i-1 and q2i for transverse displacement and for slope, respectively. The vector 
is given as:
Q = [q1
, q2
 ........qN]T
Assume an equation for the deflected beam shape:
y c = +1 2 c x + + c x3 c x 2

Equation 20.1 represents the third order polynomial with four unknown coefficients. 
Boundary conditions are given below:

= = dy
dx q a 2 0 t x (20.3)
y q = = 3 at x L (20.4)

. Substituting the values 
of C1

20.4 Results and Discussion
In this study, a cantilever aluminum beam having 5 elements is taken. Each node has 2 
degrees of freedom that are transverse displacement and rotation, so the total degree of 
freedom for the beam will be 12, with the following material properties: the density (ρ) 
of the aluminium beam is 2700 Kg/m3
, the cross-section (b × t) is 0.02 m × 0.005 m, and 
the length (L) of the beam is 0.5 m. The Young’s modulus (E) value of aluminium beam 
is 71 GPa. The Eigen vector derived from the mass and stiffness matrix gives the modal 
displacement of the entire beam element from its mean position with respect to the length 
of the beam element from the support, as shown in Figure 20.2. When the system vibrates 246 Optimization of Industrial Systems
on its own natural frequencies it will show the deformation, as shown in Figure 20.2, for 
several natural frequencies and there will be a corresponding mode shape.
20.4.1 Frequency Response Function Using ‘freqresp’ Command
In this section, the frequency response function (FRF) curve (a point FRF) is plotted by 
using the MATLAB ‘freqresp’ command. The syntax of the command is:
Syntax-[response, outputfreq] = freqresp(fit, inputfreq)
In this study, the unit impulse excitation is applied at element 2 and the accelerometer is 
also located at the same element to predict the frequency response function curve, as shown 
in Figure 20.3.
In the above response curve, the x-coordinate of the peaks represents the fundamental 
frequency. The first five fundamental frequencies of the curve are 16.57, 103.8, 290.8, 570.2, 
and 956.6 hertz, respectively. Also, the frequency response function (FRF) curve (a cross 
FRF) is plotted by using the MATLAB ‘freqresp’ command, as shown in Figure 20.4. Here, 
unit impulse excitation is applied at element 3 and the accelerometer is located at element 2 
to predict the frequency response function curve.
20.4.2 Time Domain Response Using ‘lsim’ Command
In this section, the time domain response of the cantilever beam is carried out by using the 
MATLAB ‘lsim’ command. The syntax of the command is:
syntax- “lsim(sys, u , t)”
In this study the unit impulse excitation is applied at element 2 and the accelerometer 
is also located at the same mass element to predict the time domain response, as shown in 
Figure 20.5. It is observed that the time response is decaying with respect to time.

20.4.3 Predicting Deflection of Cantilever Beam Using MATLAB Software 
and Comparing it with Analytical Solutions
In this section, the same dimension aluminium cantilever beam is considered with two 
numbers of elements, having density (ρ) of the beam as 2700 Kg/m3
, the cross-section 
(b × t) ss 0.02m × 0.005m, and the length (L) of the beam as 0.5m. The Young’s modulus (E) 
value of the aluminium beam is 71 GPa, as shown in Figure 20.6. It is used to predict the 
deflection after applying load at the third node.
Formulation of the beam is completed in Section 2. Using the elemental stiffness matrix 
of Equation 20.16 for element 1 and 2 as elements having the same length as 0.25m:

After solving the above system of equations, nodal displacement and rotation of the ele￾mental node is obtained, as shown in Table 20.1.
To predict the deflection of the cantilever beam, MATLAB code is developed and the 
outcomes are shown in Table 20.2.
As both analytical and simulated results have approximated zero error as perceived from 
Table 20.3, it validates the MATLAB code.
20.5 Conclusions
It is observed that by using command ‘lsim’ (for time domain response) and ‘freqresp’ (for 
frequency domain response) in the state space method it is possible to get the result for 
different mass elements without solving the complex differential equation. It is easy to sim￾ulate and also minimize the time taken by other methods. The state space method solution 
along with MATLAB commands helps the user to identify and predict the behavior of any 
system at any number of masses. By plotting the FRF curves, the prediction of the natural 
frequencies of the system is also an easy task.

Abstract 
Finite element model updating (FEMU) is a technique to improve the analytical finite element (FE) 
model of any structure from its experimental modal test data. The main purpose to apply FEMU on 
structures is to remove the uncertainties present in the finite element model. There can be different 
types of uncertainties present in the FE model of any structure. The uncertainties may be in the 
geometry of the structure, material properties, or boundary conditions. There are two types of finite 
element models. One is a correct model which is generally an experimental model and based on 
actual conditions. Second is the incorrect or analytical FE model which is based on certain assump￾tions and is to be updated to compare with the experimental results. There are a number of meth￾ods by which finite model updating can be done, such as Direct Updating Method (DUM), Inverse 
Eigen-Sensitivity Algorithm (IESM), and updating using uncorrelated modes (MUUM). The main 
aim of this paper is to validate the DUM on a five degree of freedom spring mass system. The system 
represents a cantilever beam. The objective is to remove the errors that are present in the magnitudes 
of a spring’s stiffness. Due to the present errors, there may be differences in modal-model of the five 
degree of freedom system. It is observed that the direct updating method has removed all the dis￾crepancies present in the natural frequencies of the system. 
Keywords: Finite element method, direct updating method, stiffness, natural frequency, 
degree of freedom
21.1 Introduction
Correct dynamic analysis is essential because excessive vibration can result in premature 
failure of any component or structure. To predict the modal-model, such as natural fre￾quencies, mode shapes, and viscous damping ratios of the mechanical systems, dynamic 
*Corresponding author: 158abhisharma@gmail.com254 Optimization of Industrial Systems
analysis on the structures is carried out. An experimental approach or theoretical (ana￾lytical) approach can be used to carry out the dynamic analysis of the structure or any 
machine component. In an analytical approach, FEM is used to build the analytical model 
of the system [1–5]. There are certain errors in finite element (FE) models of the structure 
due to which it becomes very difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of structure accu￾rately. These errors present in FE models may be due to reasons such as error in boundary 
conditions, error in material properties like Young’s modulus, density, Poisson’s ratio, etc., 
and error in the measurement of the structural dimensions. So, to analyze the dynamic 
behavior of any structure with accuracy there is a need to correct or update the FE model of 
the structure and this process of updating the FE model is known as finite element model 
updating (FEMU).
The FEMU technique can be used to formulate the finite element model of any structure 
or component. It can be used in damage identification also. A direct method of FEMU has 
been developed by Baruch and Bar-Itzhak [6]. The authors assumed that the mass matrix 
as correct for the analysis. The author updated the mode shape matrix and the stiffness 
matrix during the analysis. Berman [7] proposed a method by which the mass matrix can 
be updated directly. Symmetry of the updated matrices has been maintained by using a 
constraint. Berman and Nagy [8] proposed a method by which both mass and stiffness 
matrices of the system can be updated in a sequential manner. Modak et al. [9] also studied 
the application of the method proposed by Berman and Nagy. The author used a fixed–
fixed beam and an F-structure for the dynamic analysis. Dhandole and Modak [10] used 
the direct updating method to update the FE model of the vibro-acoustic cavities. Panwar 
et al. [11] reviewed the different types of updating methods which can be used for com￾posite materials. Shiradhonkar and Shrikhande [12] proposed a method based on finite 
element model updating for the detection of damage in composite structures. Rahmani et 
al. [13] proposed a method based on a regularized model updating technique. Mishra and 
Chakraborty [14] used IESM for composite structures. Sehgal and Kumar [15] reviewed 
the various updating techniques for isotopic structural materials. Chipa et al. [16] used 
the direct updating algorithm. It is observed from the literature review that, in most of the 
applications, the inverse eigen sensitivity method was used for updating the FE model of 
any structure or component [17–26]. It is observed that various updating methods, like the 
direct updating method, have not been utilized so much to update the finite element model. 
So, in this chapter, the finite element model updating algorithm is carried out to validate it 
on a five degree of freedom spring mass system.
In this chapter, the direct updating method (DUM) on a five degree of freedom spring￾mass system is applied to remove the uncertainty that is present in the stiffness of springs. 
The process to predict the accurate model of the spring mass system is given below. Firstly, 
the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the spring mass system are predicted by solv￾ing the eigenvalue problem. It is assumed that the error is present in the spring stiffness’s. 
The model with errors is named as an analytical model. Secondly, another model is devel￾oped by taking different values of springs. It is assumed that the spring values are correct 
and the developed model is named as an experimental model. Now, DUM is used to obtain 
the updated model. Again, the eigenvalue problem is solved by using the updated matrices. 
The new updated model is named as an updated analytical model.Finite Element Model Updating of Five Degree of Freedom Spring Mass System 255
In this study, the frequency response function (FRF) is plotted to compare the responses 
and the modal assurance criterion (MAC) is calculated to get the assurance that the exper￾imental and updated analytical mode shapes are closely related to each other. 
21.2 Analytical Study
In this section, the equation of motion of a five degree of freedom spring-mass system is 
derived. Also, the state space method along with the direct updating method is discussed.
21.2.1 Five Degree of Freedom Spring Mass System
In this work, a five degree of freedom spring mass system is taken to validate the technique 
of the direct updating method. Figure 21.1 shows the five degree of freedom spring mass 
system. In this system, there are five masses (M1 to M5) and all are connected with five 
springs. The system is clamped from one side and the other end is free to move in a lon￾gitudinal direction. Here, x1
, x2
, x3
, x4
, and x5
 represent the response of the system when 
impulsive excitation is applied on it. 
To solve the eigenvalue problem, first there is a need to predict the equation of motion. 
The equation of motion for the above five degree of freedom spring mass system, in matrix 
form, can be written as given below:

It can also be written in matrix form:
[M]ẍ + [K]x = [F], (21.2)
where [M] = Global mass matrix, [K] = Global stiffness matrix, and [F] = Global force vector.
In this study, two types of models are considered. The first model is the analytical model, 
which is also assumed as an incorrect model. The second model is the experimental model 
that is assumed as a correct model. This model is also known as an analytical experimental 
model. Table 21.1 represents the values of the spring properties. The value of all the masses 
in the system is M1
=M2
=M3
=M4
=M5
=5 Kg (for both the analytical and experimental model). 
It is seen from the above table that the values of the spring’s stiffness are different. The 
eigenvalue problem is solved for both the models and the objective of this study is to update 
or correct the analytical model from the experimental eigenvectors. 
21.2.2 State Space Model
The state space model is a method by which one can represent dynamics of a higher order 
system as a first order differential equation. This model can be represented by the following 
equations:
ẋ (t) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t) (21.3)
y (t) = C(t)x(t) + D(t)u(t) (21.4)
Here, x(t) represents the state (vector), u(t) is the input or control, y(t) is the output, 
A(t) is the dynamics matrix, B(t) is the input matrix, C(t) is the output, and D(t) is the feed 
through matrix.
21.2.3 Direct Updating Method
There are two approaches which can be used to update the FE model of the system. In the first 
approach, initially the mass matrix is updated and then the stiffness matrix will be updated. 
This method satisfies the orthogonality constraints and is given by the following equation:

In the second approach, the first stiffness matrix is updated and then, by using it, the 
mass matrix is updated:
[K ] = [K ] [K ][ ][K ] ( K )[K ] [ ] [K ] u a a e a 1 e a a 1 e T a [ ] [ ] (21.8)

where [ϕe
] is the experimental mode shape matrix, [λe
] is the experimental eigenvalue of a 
spring mass system (directly taken from eig command) and [I] is the identity matrix. The 
eigenvalue problem of the five degree of freedom spring mass system is solved by deriving 
the equation of motion. It is assumed that the uncertainties are present in the stiffness of 
springs. and named as an incorrect or simulated model. Similarly, the eigenvalue problem 
is solved for the experimental model or correct model. The objective of the direct updating 
method is to update or correct the analytical or simulated model of a five degree of freedom 
spring mass system by using experimental modal-model data. The direct method provides 
the updated global mass and stiffness matrices. These matrices will be used to get the updated 
natural frequencies. Figure 21.2 represents the necessary steps to update the FE model.
21.3 Results and Discussion
In this section, the results obtained from this analytical study are presented and discussed. 
As previously discussed, the value of springs in the analytical study is K1 = K2 = K3 = K4 = 
K5 = 1000 N/m. The value of the springs in the experimental study is K1
 = K2
 = K3
 = K4
 = 
K5
 = 1500 N/m. According to these values, Table 21.2 represents the natural frequencies of 
both the models. It is seen that both the frequencies are not exactly matched with each other. 
There is an error between the natural frequencies. The maximum error is 0.9708 Hz. It is also 
observed that the percentage error is constant at all the frequencies and its value is 18.35%. 258 Optimization of Industrial Systems
Table 21.3 represents the natural frequencies of the updated analytical model and the 
experimental model. It is observed that the direct updated method exactly updated the ana￾lytical model mass and stiffness matrices. Due to the accurate updated mass and the stiffness 
matrices, the eigenvalues of the incorrect model completely match with the experimental or 
accurate model. It is observed that both models have the same natural frequencies due to 
this error or the percentage error between the models is exactly zero.

Figure 21.3 represents an overlay of point frequency response function curves in dB. The 
excitation is applied at node number 1 and the response is also predicted at the same node. 
The graph shows the peak corresponding to their natural frequencies. 
Figure 21.3 represents the graphical representation of the analytical model response, 
experimental model response, and an updated model response. It is seen that there is a dif￾ference between the analytical and experimental frequency response function curve due to 
error in the spring properties. It is observed that the updated frequency response function 
curve exactly overlaps the experimental frequency response function curve after applying 
the direct updating technique on the incorrect or analytical model. So, it is concluded that 
the direct updating technique can be used on simple structures to remove errors.
Figure 21.4 represents an overlay of cross frequency response function curves in dB.

Figure 21.6 represents the graphical representation of modal assurance criterion (MAC). 
Modal assurance criterion represents the value of correlation between the updated analyti￾cal and experimental modes. 
Figure 21.6 compares the updated analytical and experimental modes. The value of 
MAC ranges between 0 and 1. If the value of MAC is near 0, it means that the correlation 
between the updated analytical and experimental mode is poor, but if the MAC value is 
close to 1, then the correlation among the modes is strong. The graph shows that there is a 
strong correlation between the updated analytical and experimental modes. 
21.4 Conclusions
From this analytical study, the following conclusions can be drawn:
• The direct updating method can be used to accurate the analytical model 
from the experimental eigenvalues and mode shape matrix.
• There are mainly three types of errors that may be present in the analytical 
model: error in the geometry of the system, error in the material properties, 
and error in the boundary conditions of the system. In this study, errors in 
spring stiffness are carried out because it is difficult to measure the spring 
stiffness experimentally or theoretically. The error in the mass is not consid￾ered because the mass of the system can be measured.
• It is found that after applying this method, the error among the natural fre￾quencies has been reduced to zero.
• In this study, FRF is plotted to compare the responses and responses in time 
domain have also been plotted. Then, mode shapes also verify the applica￾tion of the direct updating method. The modal assurance criterion (MAC) is 
calculated to get the assurance that the experimental and updated analytical

mode shapes are closely related to each other. It is observed the exact over￾lap between the updated and experimental FRF at resonance as well as at 
anti-resonant frequencies. Also, the MAC between the updated model and 
the experimental model reflects that the mode shapes of both the models are 
equivalent.

Design and Analysis of Two Wheeler 
Suspension Helical Compression Spring

Abstract
A helical spring is utilized in bikes having a place with a medium section in the Indian car show￾case. The point-to-point evaluation of the problem of helical springs used in the suspension system 
of motorcycles is studied in this project. Most of the time, helical compression springs failed due 
to corrosion and improper construction. These issues are understood by using redesigning and 
optimizing suspension springs and applying a thick layer of paint as a glue, a legitimate warmth 
treatment. The stress and deflection can be reduced by using a newer type of alternative material. In 
this work, the spring rate needs to be increased due to the reduced number of active coils turns. The 
static analysis is done by using the finite element method to find out the detailed stress distribution 
of the spring. A trial of the examination was performed to calculate the stiffness of the helical spring. 
Calculated results are compared with software and experimental results.
Keywords: Helical compression spring, corrosion, spring rate, stiffness
22.1 Introduction
A spring is defined as a flexible body whose purpose is to deform when overloaded and to 
improve its original unique shape when the load is expelled (Zhao et al., 2012). The main 
function is to absorb shock and vibration and provide comfort to the driver. The cross-area 
of wire made might be circular, rectangular, or square. Springs are utilized to associate two 
sections by an adaptable joint to apply power or torque on a component or to assimilate 
vitality (Dym, 2009; Dhande, et al., 2020). Force and adaptability are two essential require￾ments of spring design. The classification of the springs is shown in Figure 22.1.
The helical compression spring is made up of a wired wound helix and fundamentally 
planned for compressive or tension loads (Azzam et al., 2019; Jawlekar & Shelare, 2020). 
The cross-area from which the spring is rendered could be circular, roundabout, or rectan￾gle. There are two types of helical springs: helical spring pressure and helical spring strain 
(Pasha, 2012). The external force helps to shorten the spring in the helical spring. External 
forces work together with the spring pivot and cause torsional shear stress problems in the

spring cable (Ebrahimi et al., 2018). It ought to be noted that the coil is under pressure, 
and the wire of the helical spring is not exposed to pressure stresses. Also, the wire is not 
exposed to tensile force if the spring is under strain (Waghmare et al., 2020). The helical 
spring also classifies as a close helical spring and open helical spring (Jain et al., 2017; Mali 
et al., 2015). A helical spring is said to be a closed coil spring if the time helix angle is excep￾tionally less, i.e., less than 10⁰. A helical spring is said to be an open coil spring if the time 
helix angle is exceptionally large, i.e., greater than 100
.
The following are advantages of helical spring (Singh et al., 2017):
 i. They are simple to manufacture
 ii. They are solid
 iii. They have a stable spring rate
 iv. The exhibition can be predicted more precisely
Figure 22.2 shows the typical helical spring with its terminologies.
Previously, Sarkate (2013) described stress relief caused by fatigue and relaxation of the 
spring used in the mechanical procedure of springs and seen as tensile stresses induced 
on the inside loop and compressive stresses generated in the outside coil which decrease 
spring force and life. The stress is eliminated by warm treatment. In the process, the spring 
warms consistently under the material transformation temperature. The fatigue machine 
stops automatically when the spring fails. The fatigue test was directed under steady mean 
stress with variable stress amplitude. Del et al., (2006) describes an investigation of helical 
springs for electric vehicles with a finite element analysis of a helical spring, and utilized 
an electric wheel used for considering different street conditions. The structural reliability 
must be ensured so that static stress examination using finite element analysis of von-mises 
stress and deformation of helical springs with different loads. The outcomes acquired by

3D finite element analysis also highlight poor exactness. Error on shear stresses varies from 
1.5 to 3 percent regarding applied burden, contrast, and an estimation of straightforward 
expository techniques which are found in the book. The appropriation of stress is similar in 
every coil. Researcher Prawoto et al. (2008) has implied failure to investigate helical springs 
for substantial vehicle suspension framework, the compressive loop of a spring breaks at 
the progress situation from bearing loop to a main dynamic loop in service, and nominal 
force is always smaller than the inner loop of the completely dynamic loop. Inspection 
shows that the wear scars were produced on the main dynamic loop. Electron microscopy 
assessment indicated a semi-circular shaped area and seat marks. Phosphate coating and 
paint around the contact were exhausted because of rubbing and resulted in consumption. 
A proposal was made for improving the exhaustion execution of the springs (Waghmare 
et al., 2019). It was unequivocally prescribed to receive a non-shut end configuration to 
maintain a strategic distance from the wear and consumption of spring. Strong oil film, if 
conceivable, could be utilized in shut obstruction of the end loops if necessary. Maher et al., 
(2014) implies design, modelling, and structural analysis of wave springs at the exact level 
that the wire compression spring fit into an assembly. Thus, the wave spring decreases part 
of the burden of raw material expense. A wave spring was involved in an amazing little zone 
for the measure of work it performs. 
22.2 Design of Spring
The particular application number of springs can be designed by changing three parame￾ters, i.e., mean coil diameter, several active turns, and wire diameter (Mathew et al., 2020). 
The parameters were selected by inserting various values of d, D, and N in the following 
equation (Shelare et al., 2020)

The load for various deflections should be calculated concerning the above figuring. 
It is seen that the design of Spring I and Spring II has a greater load-carrying capacity 
than the existing spring. Table 22.3 shows theoretical deflection vs. load for different 
springs.270 Optimization of Industrial Systems
22.2.6 Modelling and Analysis of Spring 
The CAD model for the existing design is shown in Figure 22.3. This model is created using 
modelling software for solid works. The 3D model of the suspension spring is imported in 
ANSYS2020R1 software. The CAD model of the spring is shown in Figure 22.3.
For analyzing the various stresses, ANSYS2020R1 software was utilized. The outcome 
of the spring is obtained on ANSYS2020 to find the maximum deflection for the relating 
theoretical load. The analysis outcomes are as follows.

22.6 Result
Table 22.4 shows the experimental deflection vs. load for different springs. It is seen that the 
design of Spring II has a greater load-carrying capacity than other spring designs.
22.7 Conclusion 
In the present work, a comparative study has been carried out between the theoretical val￾ues and experimental values. It shows that load carrying capacity modified spring increases. 
It can be concluded that weight reduction occurs in modified springs. It is observed that the 
material required for modified springs was also reduced.

Abstract 
Automation is the need for this competitive era to maintain quality and reduce overall processing 
time and cost. In the automobile industry, the time taken for assembling the bolt and washer takes 
comparatively much more time, hence there is an increase in time of overall assembly. The proposed 
research is carried out to minimize the time taken for bolt and washer assembly. To obtain the out￾come, a novel kind of machine was designed and developed. The developed machine was mainly 
comprised of a motor for conveyor, motor for gear, inductive proxy sensor, and Adriano Uno. The 
outcome of the assembly experiment was carried out by putting the bolts on a conveyor belt at a dif￾ferent location. The developed machine was successfully tested for the assembly of bolt and washer 
and the time required for identification and assembly was noted. Identification time was varied from 
0.15 seconds to 0.32 seconds, whereas assembly time varies from 2.8 seconds to 4.9 seconds. The 
average identification time and time taken for assembly were 0.23 and 3.73 seconds, respectively. The 
developed machine was found feasible for its adaptation in the industries where the bolt and washer 
assembling are carried out.

23.1 Introduction
Bolts and washers are utilized for fastening of the parts jointly in many industries (Dravid 
et al., 2014), such as automobiles, aerospace, railways, etc., so the automatic manufactur￾ing machine puts a washer on a bolt which thereby forms a sub-assembly which could be 
utilized for additional manufacturing (Yokoyama et al., 2008). Bolted joints are applied 
to combine plates or parts and can resist a large quantity of torque and pressure without 
damaging the components being tightened (Mezei et al., 2020). This is a development of 
the forces or preload provided at work among a nut-bolt and connected surfaces (Yasui et 
al., 2018; Dhande & Shelare, 2020). A washer is a slim plate with a hole (generally in the 
*Corresponding author: subhashwaghmare1981@gmail.com280 Optimization of Industrial Systems
middle) that is usually used to divide the load of a threaded fastener, the same as a bolt or 
nut (Cernosek, 1990; Jung et al., 2009; McIlroy, & Graham, 2018). Varieties of washers are 
used in bolted joints, with a grip for preventing or retarding the loosening (Michalos et 
al., 2010; Yamazaki, 2017; Shelare et al., 2020). In the present industrial era, automation 
or artificial intelligence is utilized for various control systems for running equipment with 
minimum or low human intervention (Waghmare et al., 2017; Waghmare et al., 2020). A 
few benefits of artificial intelligence include automated machines carrying out jobs that are 
beyond the human capability of weight, size, bearing, and speed and also replacing human 
workers in jobs that engage boring or heavy physical work (Mali et al., 2015; Jawlekar et al., 
2020; Sahu et al., 2020). So, this type of bolt and washer assembly machine is very useful 
in the present artificial intelligence production system, which saves time, money, and is 
economical for the industry (Mathew et al., 2020). In this research work, we adopted the 
specific methodology, i.e., literature survey, conceptual design, design finalization, Arduino 
programming, CAD by NX 8.0, fabrication, testing, and redesign, that finalized machine 
design and fabrication. After the successful development of the model, it was tested for 
assembling the bolt and washer.
23.2 Research Methods
23.2.1 Method of Approach
The design process for this project involved four steps: 
(i) To design an experimental unit that would help with our design process
(ii) To build the experimental unit using materials that we found in the engi￾neering building; the unit was built big enough that it would be an appro￾priate assembly line for the exact dimensions of the experimental unit
(iii) To find out what our problems were, we planned to redesign and make 
modifications that would help fix those issues.
(iv) When building the final product, it was inevitable that we would find small 
problems with our design so we needed to be careful when putting the final 
product together so that we could allow for problems to be fixed (Toppo et 
al., 2021)
The methodology considered to design the project isliterature survey, conceptual design, 
design finalization, Arduino programming, CAD by NX 8.0, fabrication of the machine, 
testing, and redesign (Waghmare et al., 2019).
23.3 Materials and Methods 
The following are the detailed plan and evolution of the automation system of bolt and 
washer assembly.Automated Belt Conveyor System for Bolt and Washer Assembly 281
23.3.1 General Description of a Machine
The bolt and washer assembly machine consisted of a specially designed conveyor belt hav￾ing slots for holding the head of a hexagonal bolt. A vertical dispenser washer unit consists 
of washer stacks placed vertically over the bolt position. Sensors were utilized for correct 
positioning of the washer over the bolts and collecting trays for storing bolt-washer assem￾bly. The primary objective was to insert the washer into the bolt, so we decided on a basic 
setup which consisted of a dispenser washer unit, conveyor belt, sensors, and a collecting 
tray.
23.3.2 Planned Conceptual Design 
The CAD model shown in Figure 23.1a is the first planned conceptual design and consists 
of two different dispensers in CATIA and the final design adds an induction-like mecha￾nism and proxy sensor for bolt and washer assembly.
Conceptual Design 1: The drawbacks of the first planned conceptual design are the 
correct positioning of the bolt on a conveyor, dropping of the washer, and timing belt 
synchronization.
Conceptual Design 2: Then, two different dispensers were added along with the con￾veyor, as shown in Figure 23.1b. We make a dispenser in CATIA so that the bolt is in one 
dispenser and the washer is in the other (Mowade et al., 2019). 
In the secondary concept design the following components are included: i) different 
fixed dispenser, ii) a conveyor, iii) a positioning slot to make the bolt fall in the correct slot, 
iv) sensors. By changing the design, some problems are faced, i.e., cost of the machine is 
increased and compactness of the machine is violated. 
Conceptual Design 3: After literature review in the present design of the machine, we 
made some relevant changes like removing the dispensers, adding an induction-like mech￾anism and proxy sensor, and finalizing the design as shown in Figure 23.1c.

23.3.3.1 Motor for Conveyor
The specification is a 200 rpm, DC geared motor, as shown in Figure 23.2, for robotics 
use and accessibility in standard size nut and threads on the shaft to simply connect and 
an internally threaded shaft to easily attach it to the wheel. It features 200 rpm, 12V, DC 
motors with a. gearbox, 6mm shaft diameter with an internal hole, 125 gram weight, con￾necting torque equalling 1kgcm, torque no-load current at 60 ma (Max), and load current 
at 300 ma(Max). It is a 12V DC high torque and 200 rpm motor used to run a conveyor belt. 
It possesses worm gear to reduce speed.
23.3.3.2 Motor for Gear
DC Motor 1000 RPM and 12 Volt motors are normally a simple DC motor, as shown in 
Figure 23.4. This can be used in all-terrain robots and for different robotic uses. These 
motors have a 3 mm threaded drill hole in the centre of the shaft, thus assembling it simply 
to join it to the wheels or any other mechanical assembly. The speed controller is used to 
control the speed of the motor. Figure 23.2 shows a 12 Volt DC gear motor, whereas Figure 
23.3 shows the details of a 12 volt DC motor.
23.3.3.3 Inductive Proxy Sensor
This sensor has a span of 4mm to be right on the apex of the object, as shown in Figures 23.5 
and 23.6. This can be good or poor depending on the application of the sensor. It is good 
since it is so near it will not pick up objects far away, confusing other metallic objects for the 
ones in front. It is poor because the object has to be right on the sensor.

23.3.4 Design of Conveyor System 
The belt conveyor system design takes into consideration the followings machine elements 
(Lu et al., 2012; Benecke et al., 2020):
(i) Speed and size 
(ii) Type of motor 
(iii) Idler position
(iv) Diameter of pulley 
(v) Belt tension and power
(vi) Loading capacity
(vii) Position and setting of pulley
(viii)Control panel mode
(ix) Intended demand
(x) Drive unit
23.3.4.1 Speed and Size
The design and height of the conveyor belt were determined by the driver and the driven 
pulley diameter. The diameter of the pulley must be built in such a way that it does not 
impose undue tension on the belt. The length of the pulley belt is dependent on both the 
diameter of the pulley and the middle gap between the pulleys.
Belt speed is given by 
V = πd N, (23.1)
where d is roller diameter, V is belt speed, and N is rpm.
Belt capacity is the product of speed and cross-sectional area of the belt.
Normally, it is given by
Belt Capacity = 3.6X A X ρ X V, (23.2)
where ρ is material density (kg/m3
), V is belt speed (m/s), and A is belt sectional area (m2
).
The belt conveyor mass of material Mm (live load) per meter (kg/m) is given as
M = C
3.6XV m , (23.3)
where V is conveyor belt speed (0.5 m/s) and C is the capacity of the conveyor (100Kg/s). 
Mm = 55.6 kg
Roller diameter: The relation between maximum conveyor belt speed, roller diameter, 
and the comparative rotation per minute is given as (Waghmare et al., 2020):286 Optimization of Industrial Systems
π
n = VX X
DX
1000 60 (23.4)
where V is the conveyor belt speed (m/s), n is the number of rotations per minute, and D 
is roller diameter (mm). 
By using the PSG Design Data book, the belt width is 155 mm, the conveyor belt speed 
is 0.5 m/s, and the roller diameter is 50 mm.
The number of rotations per minute is n = 191 rpm from Equation 23.4.
Length of Conveyor Belt
= + π + +
+ L r r D r r
D ( 1 2) 2 ( 1 2)2
(23.5)
where L is length of the belt, r1 and r2 are the diameter of the roller, D is the distance 
between the two centres of the rollers, therefore
L = 1960 mm
Power of Belt and Tension: If the length of the belt is greater than the power needed for 
the conveyor, then the higher the vertical distance of the lift, the higher the power required.
Power PP
 (kW) is provided at the drive pulley drum
P = F XV
1000 p
u (23.6)
where FU is the total tangential force at the circumference of the drive pulley (N), V is con￾veyor belt speed (0.5 m/sec) and the power required for the conveyor to produce lift can 
also be calculated as
P = CXLX 3.75
1000 p (23.7)
where P is the power conveyor (kW), C is the capacity of the conveyor, i.e., 10 kg/s, and L 
is lift (1m)
P
p
 = 37 × 10−3 KW.
Therefore,
Fu
 = 75 NAutomated Belt Conveyor System for Bolt and Washer Assembly 287
Diameter of Pulley: While selecting the pulley, the following parameter takes into con￾sideration the angle of wrap (1800), speed of the belt (0.5m/sec), method of belt strain, ten￾sion (T), width of the belt (150 mm), and type of splice of the conveyor belt. The diameter 
of the pulley is obtained from the standard value from the machine design data book or 
catalogue. If the diameter of the pulley is calculated, then size of the coupling can also be 
found from the catalogue (Hu et al., 2011).
Length of pulley wraps at terminals = 2πD (23.8)
where pulley diameter is 50 mm, length of the pulley wrap is 314 mm, and the drive pulley 
can be lagged to raise friction and better transmission among the belt and pulley.
The effective pull FU (N) is given as

where L is the length of conveyor (1.96 meter) and V is the belt speed (0.5 m/sec), hence

The calculation of Torque (KNm) is as follows
T = XP
PulleyRPM
9.55 (23.12) 
where P is the conveyor power i.e. 0.06 kW, pulley revolutions per minute is 20, and torque 
is T = 28.05 Nm.
Design of Shaft: The design of the shaft consists essentially of the determination of the 
correct diameter of the shaft which ensures sufficient rigidity and strength when the shaft is 
pushed under different operating and loading conditions. Using the different handbooks of 
conveyors, the values of the width of the belt and the diameter of the pulley may be chosen 
according to the height of the shaft diameter (Richards, 2017).
Control Panel: This control panel is used for the purpose of time control and monitor￾ing, e.g., speed control of individual drives, conveyor speed control, belt slip control, load 
balance between two driving drums, and speed differential control between two engines.
23.3.4.2 Design of Gears
The gears are designed according to the conveyor system and dropping speed of the washer 
(Muthukrishnan, 2000).
The following assumptions are made for the design of gears. The first driven gear is 
designed according to automation and then the driver gear is designed according to speed.
It is assumed that: 
(i) Acrylic material is selected for gears to reduce friction 
(ii) Thickness of the gears is considered to be 2 mm, which is equal to the thick￾ness of the washer
(iii) Pressure angle is assumed to be 22O for good strength of the gear 
(iv) Gear ratio is ¼
(v) Number of teeth is 100
Driven Gear: The driven gear is designed using the Siemens NX gear modelling-GC tool￾kit. The laser cutting method is adopted which is available in FAB lab, Nagpur. Figure 23.8 
shows the gear design for driven gears using the Siemens NX gear modelling-GC toolkit.
Step 1: First we select the involute cylindrical gear module

23.4 Result Discussion 
From the result table, it is noted that the bolts are staying at arbitrary positions in the con￾veyor and the washer dropping assembly is arranged on the rod attached to the conveying 
system. The location of the bolts and washer plate are irregularly changed every time prior 
to carrying out the fastener assembly. The assembly of the fastener was taken out 37 times 
and the gathering of bolts and washers was successful 36 times with not yet used failed 
assembly. The assembly was carried out using control panels possessing speed control units 
for motor and proxy sensor regulators, as shown in Figure 23.10.
Once the setting is done, the success rate of assembly is 96%. Figure 23.11 shows the con￾trol panel circuit, Figure 23.12 shows the putting washer in a plate, and Figure 23.13 shows 
the bolt washer assemblies.

Table 23.1 shows the results of the assembly test that were carried out by putting the 
bolts on a conveyor belt at different locations. At most, the successful data from the tests 
are used for computing the assembly timing, even as there is no data gathered throughout 
failures.
Figure 23.14 shows the time recorded for identification and assembly for twenty num￾bers of trials. Smaller variation was noted in average identification time and time taken for 
assembly. Identification time was varied from 0.15 seconds to 0.32 seconds, whereas assem￾bly time varies from 2.8 seconds to 4.9 seconds. Average identification time and time taken 
for assembly were 0.23 and 3.73 seconds, respectively.

23.5 Conclusion
In this study, using the evaluative design values as mentioned above, a conveyor belt system 
for bolt and washer assembly is developed for conveying the bolt. The conveyor belt sys￾tem is planned with a fully automated process, loading, unloading, and motion efficiency. 
This system is also extremely flexible and secure, with small starting, maintenance, and 
operational cost while removing monotonous low distance motion in the manufacturing 
industry.
A present analysis on live assembly was carried out and it was concluded that the live 
process was most suitable. To overcome this problem, a planned study was carried out 
for coming up with a new type of fastener assembly system to gather a variety of bolts 
into the washer and to examine its relevancy in a non-functional industrial environ￾ment. At first, the most satisfactory system hardware and devices needed to carry out 
the fastener assembly were obtained. An experimental protester was also developed to 
make use of the selected hardware and devices containing an Arduino UNO circuit and 
relays.
The second stage of this research work involves the synchronization of bolt conveyor 
and washer dropping mechanisms. During experimentation, it was found that the identi￾fication time was varied from 0.15 seconds to 0.32 seconds, whereas assembly time varies 
from 2.8 seconds to 4.9 seconds. Average identification time and time taken for assembly 
were 0.23 and 3.73 seconds, respectively, by placing bolts at a distance of 40 cm from the 
washer.

Design and Development of Spherical 
Roller Bearings: A Review
Nilay Bhavsar* and Gurmitsingh Bassan
Mechanical Engineering Department, Dharmsinh Desai University, Nadiad, India
Abstract
This paper represents a review of past and current research in the design and development of spher￾ical roller bearings (SRB). The rolling element of the spherical bearing is normally barrel shaped, 
hence these bearings are also called “barrel roller bearings”. The design of rolling element bearings 
has a great impact on the performance, life, and reliability for the specific application of bearings. 
This type of bearing is widely used in mechanical parts in medium speed and heavy load application. 
Review of the literature suggests that a number of studies have been carried out to investigate the life 
of bearings for different loading conditions, optimized design, causes of mechanical failure, various 
geometric parameters, and optimum surface profile of spherical roller bearings. The major objective 
of their research was to decrease the contact stress at the roller raceway interface because these are 
the most heavily stressed areas in the bearing. Hence, the objective of the review article is to summa￾rize previously reported research articles by various researchers.
Keywords: Spherical roller bearing, design, optimization, geometric parameters, fatigue life
24.1 Introduction
A bearing is a machine element that plays a vital role in transferring loads between two 
moving machine parts. The rolling element bearing is a type of bearing in which the main 
load is transferred through elements which are in rolling contact rather than in sliding 
contact. Rolling element bearings are prominent because of their low starting torque and 
kinetic friction. They are widely used for numerous applications like in locomotives, auto￾mobiles, home appliances, industrial machines, electric motors, instruments, agricultural 
industries, textile industries, aerospace, and many more. 
Rolling element bearings consist of four major parts: outer raceway, inner raceway, roll￾ers, and cage. Two raceways are separated by a group of rollers and rollers carry most of the 
load. The shape of the rollers determines what the load can bear by a particular bearing, 
as well as required lubrication. Rolling elements come in different shapes: balls, cylindrical

rollers, needle rollers, tapered rollers, or spherical rollers. The names of bearing types are 
based on the kind of rolling element used. 
The design of rolling element bearings has a great impact on the performance, life, and 
reliability for specific applications of bearings. The fatigue life of bearings mainly depends 
on many factors and variables, such as the size and direction of the loadings, the geometry 
and roughness of the contact surfaces, the kind of material, the operating temperature, 
applied lubricant, lubrication conditions, and rolling speed. However, it is anticipated that 
in the future the operating conditions of bearings will be much more severe and challenging 
for parameters such as high speed revolution, huge load, high temperature, high contact 
pressure, and starved lubrication than at present. Bearings may fail when used under such 
harsh conditions by different modes of bearing damages.
Spherical roller bearings (SRB), also known as self-aligning roller bearings as shown in 
Figure 24.1, are widely used mechanical parts in medium speed and heavy load application. 
The design structure of spherical roller bearings mainly consists of two rows of spherical roll￾ers, a cage, an inner ring with spherical raceways, and an outer ring with spherical raceway. 
The rolling element of the spherical bearing is normally barrel shaped and these bearings are 
also called “barrel roller bearings”. Due to the conformity of the concave surface in the outer 
race and the convex surface in the inner race, a uniform load distribution is attained in the 
bearing. SRBs are also suitable where misalignment is associated with the rotation because at 
low load application the load gets transferred from spherical rollers to the raceway by point 
contact, while at high load application it gets transferred by the modified line contact.
24.2 Literature Review
[1] Brothers and Halling (1965) illustrated the small scale slip process which occurs between 
a rolling element and its track. These slip mechanisms arise due to the applied load and the 
geometric conformity of the system. Such slip causes creep and this creep is presented by 
creep measurement and compared with theoretical prediction. They have used a radioac￾tive tracer technique to obtain wear resulting due to the slip mechanism and correlated

with creep measurements. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that by minimizing the 
slip process, there will be lesser wear and ultimately creep will be zero. Therefore, it shows 
that in order to produce an optimum arrangement, the rolling element must be arranged to 
oppose the effect of transmitted surface traction.
[2] Fysh, Oravec, and Medley (1990) have designed an apparatus to simulate the pre￾mature failure of spherical roller bearings under external heating and water contaminated 
lubricant conditions, which is used to support the drier rolls in paper machines. Spherical 
roller bearings have a shorter life in paper machines since L10 life calculation was assumed 
by recommended lubricant viscosity, but in the present application due to elevated oper￾ating temperature, lubricant viscosity will reduce comparatively. The effects of the reduced 
lubricant viscosity would be a decrease in the elastohydrodynamic film thickness and con￾sequently increased the surface damage. The harshest conditions on any part of the bearing 
surfaces occurred at the outer race along the line of action of the load where the maxi￾mum load on individual contact acted and thus this region was examined in the present 
study. Spherical roller bearing 23024 EASK MB-C3 FAG, with a nominal inner diameter of 
110mm, was chosen for testing.
Bearing was loaded by means of spring, hydraulic jack, and a load cell up to 50 KN, 
heated using a shaft heater and driven at a speed of 1745 rev/min. The role of Lambda of 
film thickness ration (ʎ) was demonstrated clearly for the lubrication of the drier roller in 
a paper machine. They concluded that as ʎ decreases, the amount of surface damage will 
increase. When its value reaches to 0.62 or less, groove formation takes place in the surface 
which soon becomes visible to the naked eye.
[3] Ulf Olofsson (1997) suggested an analytical method and designed an experimental 
setup to determine how the surface profile changed due to wear and affects the fatigue life of 
the bearing. In spherical roller thrust bearing, the rollers will undergo sliding in the contact 
due to the curved contact surface. There are four contact zones in spherical roller thrust 
bearings, such as roller-housing washer contact, roller-shaft washer contact, roller-spherical 
flange contact, and roller-cage contact. Four roller-housing washer contact and roller-shaft 
washer contact were considered for the present study. Spherical roller thrust bearing 29416 
E SKF were chosen for testing and contacts were measured with a stylus instrument before 
and after the test. They have performed a total of ten tests for the variable running time. 
They investigated that the initial wear of the contacting surfaces shows very little positive 
influence on fatigue life for short-term tests, but fatigue life was reduced by about 80% after 
480000 revolutions. They concluded that the fatigue life reduction in spherical thrust roller 
bearing is larger for the roller-shaft washer contact than the roller-housing washer contact.
[4] Zhao (1998) developed a virtual contact loading method to study the multi-body con￾tact development and load distribution within solid and hollow roller bearings. He consid￾ered six factors which influence the load and stress distribution within the bearing, such as 
hollowness of roller, radial clearance, arranged angle between two rollers, rolling location, 
type of loading, and gap between the outer ring and housing. Ratio of bore diameter to the 
outer diameter stated the hollowness. Further, he assumed the following assumptions, such 
as the first roller is located at the symmetric line, radial clearance is zero, the angle between 
two rollers is 19˚, the external load is imposed at the centre of the shaft and there is no gap 
between the outer ring and housing. In the present research work, he studied three different 
hollowness of bearing zero, 60, and 70, respectively. He found that the hollow roller bearing 
has better load distribution than the solid roller bearing and as the hollowness is increased, 300 Optimization of Industrial Systems
the load distribution becomes more plain. Further, the load distribution within the bear￾ing becomes more uniform by decreasing arranged angle between two rollers by means of 
increasing number of rollers in bearing.
[5] Wei, Qin, Balendra, and Jiang (2004) have proposed an advanced form of roller with 
deep end cavity for roller type bearing to reduce the weight of structure and centrifugal 
forces acting on the outer race of the bearing. The major objective of their research was 
to decrease the contact stress at the roller raceway interface because these are the most 
heavily stressed areas in the bearing. In the proposed new design of deep end cavity rollers, 
the roller will deflect more at the two ends as the contact stress increases. Finite Element 
Analysis has been carried out to evaluate the new design concept of rollers and four differ￾ent types of loading conditions were used in simulation. FE analysis demonstrated that the 
roller with deep end cavity performed superior by eliminating sharp edge stresses at the 
apexes of the roller. They have found that the obtained results were quite superior to the 
conventional roller design, but similar to rollers having a logarithmic roller profile. They 
proposed a novel form of roller to overcome the limitation of logarithmic-profile rollers of 
complicated manufacturing procedures. Further, deep end cavity rollers have favourable 
advantages such as material saving, weight reduction, and reduction of the centrifugal force 
acting on the outer race of the bearing. 
[6] Darji and Vakharia (2008) performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to improve the 
overall performance of 2206 solid cylindrical roller bearings by introducing a concept of 
hollow rolling elements. FEA was carried out for hollow rolling element bearings with a 
hollowness percentage ranging from 30% to 80% in the step of 10% to obtain the opti￾mum percentage of hollowness which gives the longest fatigue life of a bearing. Obtained 
results show that the 67% hollowness is the optimum hollowness at which the stiffness 
value is maximum and contact stress is approximately equally distributed in between the 
contact of a roller. There is an increase in load carrying capacity at maximum stiffness value, 
ultimately improving the fatigue life of bearing directly proportional to the load carrying 
capacity of the bearing. 
[7] Jadayil and Jaber (2010) predicted a numerical solution for the optimum hollow￾ness and material of the hollow cylindrical bearing which is used to find a solution for the 
two problems of the cylindrical rollers, i.e., their fatigue life and heavy weight. Since the 
stress distribution within the machine element is a main factor to determine fatigue life, 
accordingly design changes should be made do redistribute the contact stress of the rolling 
element. Finite Element Analysis has been carried out to investigate stress distribution in 
the roller body and the resulting stress distribution using ABAQUS. A researcher built two 
models with different hollowness percentages to investigate the longest fatigue life of cylin￾drical rollers. The first model consists of two cylindrical rollers of the same size and a sec￾ond model consists of two rollers of different sizes which were subjected to normal loading 
as well as tangential loading of 1/3rd the normal load value. Obtained results after the FEA of 
two models stated that up to the optimum percentage of hollowness, the relative fatigue life 
increases as the percentage of hollowness increases. After that, the relative fatigue life starts 
to decrease rapidly. It has been found that many factors should be considered to obtain 
the optimum percentage of hollowness, such as kind of material used, loading value, and 
whether the hollow rollers in contact are of identical size or not. The obtained optimum 
hollowness percentage with the longest fatigue life is around 50% with consideration of all 
these factors for the case of pure rolling contact.Design and Development of Spherical Roller Bearings: A Review 301
[8] Sylvain, Timo, and Bernd (2011) have modelled a multi body system (MBS) software 
to understand the principles of friction phenomena inside spherical roller bearings. They 
used a test rig for measurement of friction torque to validate the data obtained from multi 
body system software. A 22212 spherical bearing is chosen for the test and it has been 
exposed to a radial load up to 20 KN. They found that the MBS software shows accurate 
results at higher loads, but at a small loads, due to the cage’s share in cumulative friction, it 
differs. Therefore, further development needs to be focused on modelling of cage contact 
and friction. Further, models can be used to optimize the roller bearing geometry for fric￾tion torque reduction and to get a better understanding of the interaction between bearing 
cage, lubricant, and load condition. The obtained information can be used to improve the 
efficiency of spherical roller bearings in different operating conditions.
[9] Darji and Vakharia (2011) carried out failure analysis of hollow cylindrical roller 
bearings (HCRB) made from AISI 52100 to investigate the type and mode of failure due 
to wrong selection of hollowness percentage. In the present study, they choose 42% hol￾lowness for analysis, which was not optimized and premature failure has occurred in bear￾ing due to flexure fatigue. They stated that if the percentage of hollowness is less than the 
optimum, one cannot get the maximum advantage of HCRB. Furthermore, to increase the 
fatigue life of hollow element bearing, it is important to develop a hollow element with 
optimum hollowness. 
[10] Ghalamchi, Sopanen, and Mikkola (2013) created a model to investigate bearing 
forces and deflection as a function of contact deformation and bearing geometry param￾eters according to non-linear Hertzian contact theory. FAG 21322-E1-TYPB SRB with 16 
roller elements in each row has been modelled to reveal how some parameters such as dia￾metral clearance, number of rollers, and osculation number influences the ultimate bearing 
performance. The modelling approach accounts for the loaded condition as Spherical Roller 
Bearings experience elliptical contact when loaded and line contact in no-load condition 
are between the inner race, rolling element, and outer race. To verify the new bearing model 
subjected to simple radial load, successive numerical calculation has been performed using 
MATLAB-2011b. They found that roller contact forces are inversely proportional to applied 
radial load. A bearing displacement increases with increasing applied radial load. An oscu￾lation impressively affects the bearing stiffness as force and displacement responses are 
dependent upon bearing clearance and osculation number. Further, load carrying capacity 
of spherical roller bearing increases with its number of rolling elements.
[11] Bassan and Vakharia (2015) performed theoretical and experimental analysis to 
investigate the performance of a 32212 tapered roller bearing with hollow rollers. They 
developed an experimental setup to investigate fatigue life of tapered roller bearings based 
on three major parameters, i.e., frictional torque, vibration, and temperature for different 
speeds and load conditions. To obtain optimum hollowness, they performed theoretical 
as well as FE analysis, which established less than 10% variation and found that 65% is an 
optimum hollowness to get the maximum fatigue life. Further, experimental work has been 
carried out on bearings with 65% hollowness. They conclude that the temperature rise is 
almost uniform for both solid and hollow rollers. Further, contact stress decreases due to 
expanded contact area, which leads to decreases in wear and increasing the fatigue life of 
bearings.
[12] Bassan and Vakharia (2015) performed FE analysis to determine optimum hollow￾ness in a 32212 tapered roller bearing to increase the fatigue life. They proposed that under 302 Optimization of Industrial Systems
the applied load hollow rollers deflect more than a solid roller of the same size. FEA has 
been used to investigate the contact pressure, contact stress, and deformation for equiva￾lent cylindrical roller bearings as an available theoretical method applied to tapered roller 
bearings. The obtained results shows that the total deformation is more in cases of hollow 
rollers as compared to solid rollers. Further, it is noticed that the contact pressure remains 
considerably less in cases of hollow tapered bearings. The proposed FEA states that at 65% 
hollowness of rollers, contact stress is found to be lowest, which gives the maximum fatigue 
life of bearing.
[13] Maruschak, Panin, Zakiev, Poltaranin, and Sotnnikov (2015) analysed the mecha￾nism of deformation and wear of the 22316 spherical roller bearing used in billet-casting 
machines as a link of a mould oscillating mechanism. Analysis has been carried out using a 
multi-level approach, i.e. from the perspective of the mechanics of a deformable rigid body 
at a macro-level, by implementing tribological approaches at meso-level II and using the 
methods of indentation, 3D profilometry, and fractography at meso-level I. They conclude 
that the reason for the generation of dents in bearing raceways is low amplitude high fre￾quency oscillation in the contact zone of rollers in the raceway, as well as the disturbance 
of their lubrication regime. They also developed the process of relief formation under the 
different forces and thermal impacts on the surface of materials. Furthermore, due to shock 
loads and vibration, there is a generation of wear grooves on the surface and they recom￾mended that to reduce the probability of lubrication regime distortion, one can increase the 
damping frequency.
[14] Tiwari and Waghole (2015) proposed a procedure for the optimum design of 
symmetric 22317 SKF Spherical Roller Bearing (SRB) using the Artificial Been Colony 
Algorithm (ABCA), Grid Search Method (GSM), and hybrid method. The maximization of 
dynamic capacity has been chosen as the objective function because the life is directly pro￾portional to the dynamic capacity. They also carried out the sensitive analysis to find out the 
adverse effects on objective function due to the deviation of design variables in manufac￾turing tolerances. Obtained results from sensitive analysis shows the very small amount of 
change in dynamic capacity, thus there will be very small changes in the objective function 
due to manufacturing tolerances. They observed geometrical parameters of bearing such as 
roller diameter, roller length, bearing pitch diameter, number of rollers, and contact angle 
as a design variables. They found that optimum design from the hybrid method gives the 
optimum value out of all three methods. They also observed that the percentage change in 
dynamic capacity is more for bigger bearings than for smaller ones.
[15] Xing, Xu, Liu, Xi, and Wang (2016) have investigated the vibration due to surface 
waviness in double row spherical roller bearings using a non-Hertzian contact model. 
The self-aligning contact angle and the interaction with the external loads were intro￾duced in the model. In order to investigate the feature of waviness under the self-aligning 
operating condition, they assumed that the waviness only exists in SRB’s left row, while 
the right row was manufactured perfectly. They found that there is an influence of wav￾iness on the vibration of the bearing and ultimately it affects the fatigue life of the bear￾ing. Also, the slight increase in radial clearance improves the effect of waviness, but there 
is no influence in the rotation of all the rollers. With the larger waviness amplitude, the 
effect of waviness becomes more clear. Further, they proposed that the effect of waviness 
on vibration can be minimized by increasing the magnitude of the self-aligning contact

model for a spherical roller bearing that includes an inner and outer race surface defect 
and model have been developed to show the behaviour as a function of defect location 
and size. Spherical roller bearing 22216 has been considered for modelling with an ellipti￾cal cross-section defect on the inner and outer raceway. By taking assumption of elliptical 
surface concavity on inner and outer raceways, they found that the roller’s connection with 
rings was not lost immediately when a roller passes over the defect. It means that the roller 
is in contact with surfaces whenever the defect depth is smaller than elastic deformation 
between rollers and raceways. Furthermore, it is possible to classify an SRB defect using the 
introduced model by comparing it with measurement data.
[17] Satone and Gangshettiwar (2017) created a project that dealt with investigation and 
analysis on failure of spherical roller bearing 22322 for casting shakeout required in foundry 
industries to separate solidified casting and sand from the mould box. They found that fail￾ure of bearing was due to cavities created on the bearing raceway within a short period. 
Further investigation was carried out on the failure of spherical bearing, which includes 
visual examination and analytical bearing life calculation. A model of actual shakeout and 
bearings created using Pro-E design software and stresses and deformation produced were 
confirmed by finite element analysis using ANSYS 2011 software. After modifying the exist￾ing setup of casting shakeout, they found that deformation and stresses are less and also 
bearing life is calculated analytically which was ten times more than the existing setup. It 
saves the cost of annual production loss and reduces breakdown time under actual service 
conditions.
[18] Liu and Shao (2018) have studied an analytical dynamic model of a lubricated hol￾low cylindrical roller bearing (HCRB) to analyse the influences of the radial load, the shaft 
speed, and the hollowness percentage of the roller on the bearing vibration. They intro￾duced the analytical method for calculating the contact deformation between the solid 
roller and the bearing races as well as between the hollow roller and bearing races. The 
numerical results were obtained by using a Runge-Kutta method. There is a difference of 
vibration characteristics between the HCRB and solid cylindrical roller bearing (SCRB) 
because the contact stiffness coefficients between the hollow roller and the races is less than 
those between the solid roller and the races. Finding of numerical models conveys that the 
hollowness percentage of the roller has a great influence on the vibration of the roller and 
inner race of the HCRB. Further, the vibration of the HCRB is not only determined by the 
hollowness percentage of the roller, but it is also dependent on the external radial load and 
shaft speed. Therefore, during a design of hollow roller bearings, influences of the shaft 
speed and radial load on the vibration of the bearing component should be considered.
[19] Jat and Tiwari (2020) have considered Multi Objective Optimization for Spherical 
Roller Bearing (SRB) based on fatigue and wear using two objectives (dynamic load rat￾ing (Cd
) and elastohydrodynamic minimum film thickness (hmin)), eight design variables, 
and twenty-two constrains. As the dynamic capacity is directly proportional to the life of 
bearing, they chose maximization of dynamic capacity as one of the objectives. Wear life 
of bearings can be increased by applying proper lubrication. To avoid the metal to metal 
contact between rollers and raceways, proper lubrication should be employed in bearing, 
hence minimizing the friction. Accordingly, the second objective has been taken as an 
increase in the minimum film thickness. 22317 SKF SRB has been configured for the study. 
They adopted NSGA-II as an optimization tool. The obtained result from the optimization 304 Optimization of Industrial Systems
tool states that the optimized life comparison factors vary from 1.5 to 2.85 and specific 
film thickness increases when compared to the existing design configuration of 22317 SKF 
SRB. It was observed that as bearing size increases, the life comparison factor of SRBs also 
increases, which implies better improvement of large bearing due to bearing space.
24.3 Literature Outcome
Review of the literature suggests that a number of studies have been carried out to inves￾tigate the life of bearing for different loading conditions. Researchers also explored a wide 
range of design parameters at a different operating conditions. It was further noted that var￾ious work has been carried out to find the optimized design, causes of mechanical failure, 
various geometry parameters, and optimum surface profile of Spherical Roller Bearings.
Many researchers (Olofsson (1997), Fiedler (2011), Tiwari (2015), Jat (2020)) have car￾ried out their research work to improve the performance of rolling contact bearings using 
various optimization techniques and algorithms. Their study shows that there is a necessity 
for optimization for getting the optimal design of bearings to achieve goals of high perfor￾mance bearings which will have high load capacities, low friction losses, low weight, and 
high resistance to wear. The review suggests that use of optimization techniques and algo￾rithms helps us shorten the time period required to optimize bearing design.
Researchers (Wei (2004), Darji (2008), Wisam (2010), Ghalamchi (2013), Bassan (2011), 
Satone (2017)) published their research articles related to Finite Element Analysis of rolling 
contact bearing to identify the load distribution in bearing, maximum deflection bearing, 
maximum contact stress in bearing, vonmises stress in bearing, and contact stress at the 
roller raceway and to obtain the optimum percentage of hollowness which gives the lon￾gest fatigue life of bearing. Since use of hollow rollers over solid rollers provides significant 
advantages such as reduced vibration, higher operating speed, low weight, lower operating 
temperature, and reduced centrifugal force, contact stress is also reduced considerably by 
using a bearing with hollow rolling elements. 
Brothers (1965), Fysh (1990), Olofsson (1997), Darji (2008), Bassan (2011), Maruschak 
(2015), Xing (2016), and Liu (2018) performed experimental work to investigate the 
behaviour of a rolling contact bearing under different operating conditions, measuring the 
different parameters to identify the failure and mode of failure for rolling contact bearings 
and to investigate the behaviour of hollow rolling elements over a solid roller of the same 
size. Obtained results show that behaviour of the temperature distribution in both hollow 
and solid rolling elements remains uniform and there is no such effect of friction and vibra￾tion in the machine performance due to hollow rollers.
Various researchers have proposed in their research articles that under a large normal 
load, a hollow element with a sufficiently thin wall thickness will deflect considerably more 
than the solid element of the same dimensions. It has been observed that load capacity, as 
well as contact stress, is also reduced appreciably by using a bearing with optimized design 
of the rolling element. Due to modified design of the rolling element, the main advantage 
is that contact stress will be distributed in more area and stress concentration can be mini￾mized. This will lead to an increase in the fatigue life of the bearing.Design and Development of Spherical Roller Bearings: A Review 305
24.4 Conclusion
The design of rolling element bearings has a great impact on the performance, life, 
and reliability for specific application of bearings. The fatigue life of bearings mainly 
depends on many factors and variables, such as the size and direction of the loadings, 
geometry, and roughness of the contact surfaces, the kind of material, the operating 
temperature, applied lubricant, lubrication conditions and rolling speed. However, 
it is anticipated that in the future the operating conditions of bearings will be much 
more severe and challenging for the parameters such as high speed revolution, huge 
load, high temperature, high contact pressure, and starved lubrication than at present. 
Bearing may fail when used under such harsh conditions by different modes of bearing 
damages.
Running condition bearings leads to heat and friction generation which has an adverse 
effect on bearing and automobile systems and leads to problems such as wear, tear, and bad 
fuel economy, which leads to harmful environmental effects. Hence, less heat generation 
is required, which permits higher operating speed without affecting major losses in the 
engine due to heat generation, as well as with high stiffness, it serves the longest fatigue life 
by decreasing contact stress and improving load carrying capacity.

Abstract 
Biomedical engineering solutions to mankind have come with some of the most prompting ideas 
resolving major issues, from which bone healing scaffolds are one of its kind. The outcome of bone 
scaffolds has facilitated engineering as well as medical sciences in uncomplicated tissue healing 
methods of bones and organs. Earlier, many studies were performed on the appropriate designing of 
bone scaffolding, but this study spotlights on the designing methodology and topological optimisa￾tion of the scaffold. This study has been performed on an extracted segment of femur bone, further 
modifying it to a three-dimensional scaffold using computer aided design (CAD) software. Some 
leading edge software, like Materialize Mimics, Autodesk Meshmixer, and Fusion 360, have been 
employed for gaining desired results with optimal accuracy. Topological optimisation of scaffolds 
has led to its increased porosity along with appreciable material prevention. In case of any damage 
in the bone structure, the scaffold shall be placed and fixed to that section and this increased poros￾ity shall be beneficial for providing the environment for cell regeneration which will aid in better 
formation of bone tissue. The scaffold porosity would also provide better fixture and strength to the 
structure after being implanted into the body. The deduction of excess material would reduce the 
overall manufacturing cost of the scaffold elevating its affordability to penurious patients.

25.1 Introduction
The application of engineering branches to either enable tissue growth or to maintain exist￾ing tissue structures is called Tissue Engineering (TE). It is a multidisciplinary discipline 
that is used to make operative three-dimensional (3D) tissue joining cells, scaffolds, and/
or bioactive molecules [1]. The scientific community was introduced to the term Tissue 
Engineering in the year 1993 by Vacanti and Langer. Their definition, which states that the 
sole objective in TE is to develop biological substitutes that restore, improve, or maintain 
*Corresponding authors: abner.lawrence7@gmail.com, muhammadsahil1997@gmail.com308 Optimization of Industrial Systems
the functioning of tissue, is still in practice [2]. Tissue Engineering has seen evolution from 
the field of biomaterials development and discussions which have been made to combine 
biologically active molecules, scaffolds, and cells into working tissues. Some Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved examples of engineered tissue are cartilage and skin. 
However, their current application in humans is limited. From the materials engineering 
perspective, tissues are viewed as cellular composites representing multiphase systems. 
Cellular composites consist of three key structural components: (1) scaffolding architec￾ture, (2) organization of cells into functional units, and (3) the extracellular matrix. 
Organization of tissues in the body generally takes place in the form of three-dimensional 
structures. This architecture is progressively assumed to make a significant contribution to 
developing specific biological functions in tissues and it is thought to provide appropriate 
nutritional conditions and structural organization for cells. Regenerative medicine is a wide 
field that comprises of tissue engineering along with involving the idea of self-curing where 
the body systems are used by the body itself with the help provided by external biological 
material to rebuild organs or recreate cells. “Regenerative medicine” and “tissue engineer￾ing” have become largely interchangeable terms because the field expects to focus on curing 
rather than treating for complex, often chronic diseases. 
Scaffolds are the remarkable part of tissue engineering. However, researchers frequently 
experience an immense variety of decisions when choosing scaffolds for tissue engineer￾ing. Tissue engineering together with regenerative medicine can be operated to make 
scaffolds in the human body. It is an upcoming and trendy field and typically connected 
with conditions including organ disorder. It is utilized to reconstruct organs and return 
their typical capacity [3]. They are commonly made of polymeric biomaterials, thus offer￾ing auxiliary help for cell connection and ensuing tissue improvement. The traditional 
strategy for tissue regeneration and recuperating is the auto unite technique and is fun￾damentally subject to the accessibility of benefactor tissues, combined with other extra 
impacts, such as pain and risks to patients, and they give way to tissue bleakness and 
irresistible diseases [3]. They have been applied and utilized as a supporting structure for 
cell societies and the domination of cell development in cases of disabled tissues or organs. 
During cell regeneration, the scaffold significantly helps in cell regeneration and gradually 
degrades either over the span of the healing procedure or after, and another tissue with 
an ideal shape and properties is formed. This degradability property of the scaffold blocks 
the need to evacuate the material later and, along these lines, eliminates the probability of 
remote materials left in the body [4]. Henceforth, the used scaffold ought to meet specific 
chemical, mechanical, and physical necessities to accomplish cell dissemination and tissue 
arrangements.
Topology optimisation is a comparatively new area of study. Based on the physical 
aspects and performance requirements, it mathematically finds the optimal distribution of 
material of a component. By altering material distributions, new theoretical designs can be 
generated. Topology optimisation provides solutions to the essential engineering problem 
of placing material in a prescribed design domain to attain the best structural performance 
[5]. After the finite element model is completed and model results are made sure of, it can 
be used for optimisation. Topological optimisation’s objective is to find the optimum usage 
of material for a structure in order to maximize the performance. Although some principles 
date back to 1904, since the introduction of computer technology and its maturity in the 
mid-1980’s this field has not seen much improvement [6].Topological Design Optimisation of Tissue Engineering Scaffolds 309
Mechanical devices are not fit for achieving all the capacities related with tissues and can￾not forestall dynamic patient disintegration. Therefore, surgical reconstruction can bring 
about long-haul issues and tissue engineering emerges from the need to give increasingly 
authoritative answers for tissue fixing in facilities and intends to accomplish this objec￾tive by the advancement of trending gadgets that would heal the harmed tissue [7]. The 
important thing these days is the regenerative medicine field which includes several zones 
of innovation, stem cells, tissue engineering, and cloning. Tissue engineering is the finest 
area of regenerative medicine as it follows the standard of cell transplantation and material 
science engineering to improve natural proxies capable of holding on to and rebuilding the 
typical capacity. Tissue engineering methodologies can be bifurcated into two classifica￾tions: acellular scaffolds utilization which relies upon the body’s normal capacity to recover 
for appropriate direction along with a course of new tissue development and the utilization 
of scaffolds seeded with cells. Acellular scaffolds are normally arranged by manufacturing 
counterfeit scaffolds or by expelling cellular parts from tissues through mechanical and 
chemical control to deliver cellular, collagen-rich lattices. These outlines will, in general, 
gradually corrupt on implantation and are, for the most part, supplanted by the extracellu￾lar matrix proteins that are emitted by the in-developing cells. Cells can likewise be utilized 
for treatment by way of infusion, either with bearers such as hydrogels or alone. The TE 
approach is broadly examined for the improvement of 3D in vitro models of sound and 
neurotic organs and tissues. The outcomes condensed right now show that the TE method 
can be well utilized in the advancement of three-dimensional models of numerous organs 
and human tissues, such as the heart, bones, liver, and pancreas. This synthesizing field is 
quickly creating and progressing [8-11].
25.1.1 Properties of Scaffolds
• Biocompatibility: The tissue designed structure or scaffold should likely evoke 
a very negligible immunologic response to forestall it causing an inflamma￾tion that may diminish mending or cause dismissal by the body.
• Biodegradability: The tissue designed structures and scaffolds are not 
expected to be life-long implants. The scaffold should in this way be biode￾gradable in order to permit cells to create their own extracellular matrix. The 
resultant products of this deterioration ought to likewise be non-harmful and 
ready to leave the body without impedance to different organs.
• Manufacturing Technology: All together, for a specific scaffold or tissue 
designed structure to turn out to be clinically and industrially feasible, it 
ought to be practical and cost effective and it ought to be conceivable to 
scale-up from making each in turn in an examination lab for small batch 
production. The advancement of adaptable processes of manufacturing to a 
good manufacturing practice (GMP) standard is fundamentally significant 
in guaranteeing fruitful interpretation of tissue engineering procedures to 
the clinic [12].
• Mechanical Properties: One of the extraordinary difficulties in endeavouring 
to design bone or cartilage is to develop scaffolds with requisite mechanical 
properties. For these tissues, the scaffold implanted into the body must pos￾sess adequate mechanical uprightness to work from the hour of implantation 310 Optimization of Industrial Systems
to the consummation of the remodelling cycle. The achievement of a scaf￾fold can be determined by the harmony between mechanical properties 
and permeable or porous design adequate to permit cell proliferation and 
vascularization.
• Scaffold Architecture: The design of scaffolds utilized for tissue engineering 
is of ultimate significance. Scaffolds ought to have an interconnected pore 
design and enhanced porosity to guarantee cell entrance, cell penetration, 
cell proliferation and satisfactory dispersion of nutrients to cells inside the 
build and to the extra-cell matrix shaped by these cells.
25.1.2 Topology Optimisation of Tissue Engineering Scaffolds
An eminent job is played in scaffold modulus by the scaffold topology and is the prime cog￾nitive factor of gaining porosity. For the scaffold, the traditional methodology to topology 
design and optimisation is repetitious and also the idea of refining the implementation of 
the scaffolds produced later is drawn from the conclusions from the tentative performance 
of previously produced scaffolds [12].
There have been many struggles to define optimised scaffolds and there are numerous 
works which couple the mechanical attributes of the structure and porosity with topological 
information. However, scaffolds are planned to be efficient from the designing phase and, 
from a mechanical perspective, they must also possess high porosity for providing cells a 
regenerative environment [13]. To achieve mechanical strength and porosity simultane￾ously is an essential but complicated task in itself for the application of tissue engineering. 
An enhanced approach is being suggested in this review for achieving scaffolds with a suit￾able topology resulting in the maximization of both mechanical performance and porosity. 
Optimised structure of a bone scaffold possessing high porosity is shown in Figure 25.1, 
which has proved its significance in treating disorders like bone cancer.
Certain works, such as by Rainer et al. [15], use Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and 
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as the foremost essential tools for the design of scaffolds. 
Though, in this particular approach, there may arise a probability of a reduction in the 
number of physical scaffolds which ought to be fabricated and verified to uncover the finest 
topologies.
Figure 25.1 Optimised structure of bone scaffold possessing high porosity [14].Topological Design Optimisation of Tissue Engineering Scaffolds 311
The production and testing via additive manufacturing of the consequential 
3-dimensional models would be straightforward and easy, which will permit suitable and 
satisfactory control over the topology of produced scaffolds. One such device, known as a 
3-Dimensional Bio Plotter, which works on the principle of Fused Deposition Modelling 
(FDM), does this complex task of fabricating scaffolds. In FDM, the material filaments 
are extruded by a nozzle at high temperatures. The extruded strands or filaments are then 
layered over one another. Figure 25.2 depicts an example of a bone scaffold made up of 
Polylactic Acid.
Since the diameter of the strands and the distance between them can be altered using 
computer software, the anticipation of several topologies with varying modulus and poros￾ity is feasible. Scaffolds are essentially designed to degrade (at a particular degradation 
rate) in the body. The bone scaffold must fulfil certain design requirements, such as bio￾compatibility, and must encourage differentiation, migration, and attachment of the sur￾rounding cells and correspondingly, for effortless elimination from the body, the scaffolds 
must decompose into undisruptive constituents.
25.2 Research Methods
Two principal approaches are used to deliver designed tissue. To begin with, the scaffold 
can be utilized as a cell uphold gadget or support device whereupon cells are cultivated in 
vitro; cells are then urged to set down a matrix to deliver the establishments of a tissue for 
transplantation. The subsequent methodology includes utilizing the scaffold as a growth 
factor/drug delivery device. This procedure includes the scaffold being joined with growth 
factors, so upon implantation cells from the body are enlisted to the scaffold site and struc￾ture tissue upon and all through the matrices. These two methodologies are not fundamen￾tally unrelated and can be effectively joined.
The way wherein a cell type and scaffold are consolidated ought to be deliberately 
coordinated for reasons as it has been shown that architecture, constitution, and topol￾ogy of scaffold can collaborate and impact cell conduct. The scaffold’s design appears to 
adjust the reaction of cells and ensuing tissue development, as exhibited by the age of 
mineralization fronts in explicit areas of scaffolds. Nano to microscale topography has 
been shown to influence cell conduct by alteration of arrangements of cytoskeleton. A 
scope of cell types would now be able to be joined with scaffolds to create tissue designed 
structures [17].
Figure 25.2 Bone scaffold made up of polylactic acid [16].312 Optimization of Industrial Systems
25.2.1 Use of PLA in Crafting Bone Scaffolds 
Generally, for the manufacturing of bone scaffolds, a mixture of collagen and hydroxyapatite 
is employed to obtain the finest outcome. Polylactic Acid shall be used for this study. PLA is a 
biodegradable biopolymer that is capable of being used in the human body. For several years, 
degradable materials have been of great attention for being used for medical implants. This 
biodegradable thermoplastic has considerable mechanical strength and remarkable biocom￾patibility. Figure 25.3 represents a schematic diagram for making a PLA scaffold.
The purpose behind employing Polylactic Acid for this purpose is because unlike the most 
thermoplastic polymers which are obtained from the refinement and polymerization of non￾renewable petroleum resources, Polylactic Acid is attained from sources which are renewable 
in nature, such as sugar cane and starch, which makes it non-toxic in nature and best suitable 
for decisive purposes such as bone implants. Polylactic Acid is biodegradable. It also possesses 
traits similar to that of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), or polystyrene (PS). The manu￾facturing equipment that is originally fabricated and operated for petrochemical industry plas￾tics is also very beneficial for production with the support of which relatively economical PLA 
is produced. Table 25.1 depicts the materials used for additive manufacturing of scaffolds.

25.2.3 Scaffold Designing
25.2.3.1 Extraction of Bones from Computed Tomography (CT) Scan
The very first step toward designing a bone scaffold is to get access to a bone scan so that the 
design may contain the specifications possessed by a human bone. In this particular study, 
a femur bone is employed for scaffold designing. The CT scan for femur extraction used 
in this study is of a patient in his mid-30s. As shown in Figure 25.5, a three-dimensional 
CT scan, which was originally in DICOM format, is exported in a medical software named 
Materialize Mimics. Secondly, the portion of the bone to be taken for research is selected 
by applying a mask and threshold on the bone by selecting the ‘CT bone’ option as it will 
highlight (in green colour) only the bone whose CT scan has been taken. The desired part 
is then exported to modelling software in STL format.

Figure 25.5 Extraction of femur from CT scan using materialize mimics.314 Optimization of Industrial Systems
Post extraction of the femur bone from the CT scan and the obtained STL bone file is 
then introduced to the software named Autodesk Meshmixer. This software is commercially 
available and is specifically exercised for carrying out numerous modelling operations on 
the STL file. The scaffold operation cannot be performed on the full length of the bone due 
to its complexity and impracticality. The scaffold is always fabricated for a ‘section’ of the 
bone which would aid in the healing process. Therefore, abstraction of the desired segment 
is basic for scaffold designing as shown in Figure 25.6. For this purpose, a feature termed 
‘plane-cut’ is used in Meshmixer which concisely removed the undesired top and bottom 
section of the bone, deserting the preferred section suitable for scaffold making.
25.2.3.2 Designing of Scaffold from Abstracted Bone Segment 
Designing of the scaffold begins after picking up a bone segment. Further procedure is con￾tinued in Meshmixer. Figure 25.7 displays X-ray vision of the solid bone structure, whose 
height and width dimensions are mentioned as 40 mm and 59.85 mm, respectively. The 
width of bone marrow along the length of femur is 30.33 mm.

Figures 25.8a and b portray the front and top view of the bone segment screening the 
three-dimensional geometry for enhanced perception of the structure. Also, Figure 25.8c 
shows an isometric view of the bone segment prior to the patternization stage, in which 
the final modification for scaffold designing will be performed. Lastly, Figure 25.8d depicts 
X-Ray vision of the bone segment for interior view and the point to be mentioned here is 
that the space between two vertical surfaces seems to be empty in this view but is actually 
not. The entire region is solid from within and hence, it would back the sculpting of scaf￾fold’s lattice structure. At this beginning stage, the design possesses 2011 vertices and 4022 
triangles making it the simplest form possible.
Once the solid bone segment is ready, the next and most crucial step is to transform the 
bone segment into the scaffold. For this purpose, multiple structures can be employed as 
per the design and medical parameters needed. For this study, the lattice structure is exer￾cised because not only does this structure retain preeminent structural support to the bone 
from both extremities, but it also makes the scaffold a perfect fit when implanted into the 
body.
Also, the lattice structure happens to be more porous, which will eventually be bene￾ficial once the scaffold is implanted within the body. The bone marrow throughout the 
length of femur plays a crucial role of sustaining bone marrow for growth and healing 
of bone tissues. It is this cavity of bone from where the cells are transmitted into the 
scaffold voids. Without this operation of bone marrow, the scaffold would not serve 
appropriately. The porosity of the scaffold will allow and provide the regenerative envi￾ronment for the growth of bone tissues, making the healing process more efficient and 
quicker.
Several dimensional parameters have been considered during the design of such complex 
geometry. The tiling mode is kept as a regular grid. The pattern, blue in colour, is shown 
in Figure 25.9 and possesses its own dimensional values, such as Element Dimensions and 
Element Spacing, which turns out to be 1.257 mm and 2.826 mm, respectively, with 1005 
vertices and 2010 triangles on the overall design.
After applying the changes done in the previous step and updating the design, we were 
left with our final scaffold design, as shown in Figure 25.10. Scaffolds are basically obtained 
after elimination of bone sections intersecting with the lattice pattern. As it can be clearly 
seen, the scaffold comprises a lattice structure and enough porosity for offering a regenera￾tive environment to the bone cells. Polylactic Acid (PLA) is a material which has been taken 
into consideration for scaffolds due to its high biocompatibility with the human body and 
ease in fabricating the scaffold via 3D Printing. Table 25.2 depicts the properties of the PLA.

The final design turns out to be more complex than the previous two presented designs. The 
scaffold contains 22417 vertices and 45990 triangles. However, the number of triangles is 
convincingly kept less than 50000, making it reliable for commercial 3D printers to print 
it, as the number of triangles is in proportional with the complexity in manufacturing and 
printing.

25.2.4 Topological Optimisation of Scaffold
The following equations represent the topology optimisation of density-based material fur￾ther subjected to stress constraints. A solution is necessary for such issues and is given in a 
design domain Ω in the form [21]:
min (ρ ∈ S) V = ∫ Ω ρ dΩ (25.1)
s.t. g(x) = |σ|/σlim − 1 ≤ 0, ∀x∈Ωmat, (25.2)
0 < ρmin ≤ ρ(x) ≤ 1 (25.3)
The volume of the structure can be represented by V, which gives the objective func￾tion. ρ(x) is the design variable that is used for representing the design variable in the 
design domain Ω at point x, which can be between ρmin and 1. g(σ) is used for represent￾ing the stress constraint function and |σ(x)| is approximately equal to the stress criteria. 
At last, the stress constraints are only applied in the region of the material:
Ωmat = {x∈Ω} ρ(x) > ρmin (25.4)
On the whole, the design domain is discretised into a non-movable finite element 
mesh for this particular issue and is solved numerically. Apart from this, the effective 
properties of the material are parameterized by the SIMP model in which each element is 
assignment with a density variable and density is scaled with the effective elasticity tensor 
for individual element Ce. C0
 represents the elasticity tensor for a solid material.

25.3 Result Discussion
Topology optimisation has turned out to be a very trending subject in the region of 
optimal design. Many theories and research papers have been distributed by a variety 
of creators in topology optimisation, which demonstrates the development of the sub￾ject. A technique or method (mathematical) which is used for finding out the optimum 
material with a well-defined design domain, i.e., for a number of boundary conditions, 
constraints, and loads, to achieve the system’s maximum performance is denoted as 
Topology Optimisation [22]. The advantage of using this technique is that the design 
can acquire any shape within the design space and can produce a lightweight design by 
reducing the material but having almost same strength as that of the original design. It 
is also time saving and cost effective. Its primary goal is to keep the structural compli￾ance at a minimum spontaneously while satisfying the constraints of volume removal. 
The key function of lowering the structure compliance to a minimum equals the strain 
energy at a minimum for the reason that strain energy is half of the structure’s compli￾ance [23].318 Optimization of Industrial Systems
Topological optimisation as complex geometry similar to scaffolding involves a hand￾ful of considerable changes in the overall design, including elements such as volume and 
mass. For this study, optimisation has been performed on the designed scaffold on a world 
class leading CAD (Computer Aided Design) software, Autodesk Fusion 360. The bound￾ary conditions on the target structure were applied from a femur viewpoint. The load of 
50N magnitude was applied on the top surface, keeping the bottom surface as constraint. 
The software also equips a unique feature of specifying regions which will stand unaffected 
by the optimisation effect, clearly depicted in green colour in Figure 25.11a. The arrange￾ment has been made to uphold the mechanical quality of the scaffold structure. In the post 
optimisation process, the removal of material was observed from the outer regions of the 
scaffold as shown in Figure 25.11b. The region in red colour shows the peak value of the 
load where it is applied.
After the topological optimisation, light-weighted three-dimensional scaffold designs 
are obtained, as depicted in Figure 25.12. The top and bottom regions are least affected by 
the optimisation algorithm because of the reason mentioned previously. The number of 
triangles in this STL file is 49000, which is easily printable. This design possesses compar￾atively more porosity without compromising the structural strength. The new scaffold was 
16.48% lighter and at least 80% of the total mass was retained as compared to the original 
one and the strength was almost the same.

25.4 Conclusion
The following conclusions can be drawn from the described work:
• The extracted segment of the femur bone is effectively modified into bone 
scaffold.
• The scaffold, after topological optimisation, portrays some appreciable quali￾ties such as weight reduction. The new scaffold was 16.48% lighter compared 
to the original one and approximately 80% of the total mass was retained.
• Before topology optimization, the scaffold contained 22417 vertices and 
45990 triangles, but post topology optimization the number of triangles 
increased to 49,000. 
• Unnecessary materials in the scaffold which were least affected by the 
force-constraint couple have been eliminated by the software resulting in 
additional porosity which will not only encourage the cells’ growth, but also 
eventually abridge the fabrication of the prototype.
• The surface area increased post topology optimization in order to facilitate 
more growth of the tissues and cells within the scaffold.
• The strength of the new scaffold was almost the same as that of the original 
one.

of Technology, Jalandhar, India
Abstract 
Today, in automobile industries, cruise control is one of the most serious aspects that is necessary 
in a well-planned controller which can suit the new improvements in innovation. One of the most 
favoured and significant models for control system engineering is the cruise control system (CCS). 
This speed control system proves to be a prominent laboratory prototype of an advanced control 
system. This CCS finds wide usage due to the ease in understanding and coverage of various pre￾dominant ancient and new design approaches. In this paper, the performance of different controllers, 
such as a proportional-integral (PI) controller, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, 
and fuzzy logic controller (FLC), is evaluated at different conditions of road to achieve the desired 
speed of the vehicle. The dynamic model of a vehicle or CCS considers the road grade and friction 
coefficient occurring between road and wheel. Modelling of the controller has been done with the 
help of MATLAB/Simulink software. At last, a comparison analysis of each controller with the dif￾ferent conditions will be done that is dependent on performance characteristics. 
Keywords: CCS, fuzzy logic controller, proportional-integral-derivative controller, 
proportional-integral controller
26.1 Introduction
In numerous nations where there are numerous stretches of long, level, and open express￾ways, most vehicles have a programmed transmission and a legitimate and supported 
alternative is CCS. The CCS offers three significant preferences to keep up the vehicle 
speed, improve mileage, and expand the comfort level of the driver on a significant dis￾tance trip [1]. An advanced CCS framework will keep up a close to steady state speed of 
a vehicle that can help a substantial footed driver from surpassing the legitimate speed 
limits. On long and level stretches of street, a CCS framework will keep up a consistent 
quickening agent pressure that can expand a vehicle’s mileage. Lessons have demonstrated 
that a vehicle may spare from 1.1 to 10.7% in fuel utilization by utilizing CCS [2]. CCS is

utilized for programmed control of vehicle speed. CCS is the model to streamline the part 
of issues which are looked at by the driver and explores exhaustion, surrender, and street 
mishaps, etc. [3, 4]. Basic CCS keeps up the ideal speed or set speed by the driver and 
Adaptive CCS keeps up the speed just as the relative division to the lead vehicle. The rela￾tive partition or separation by and large relies upon the situation of the vehicle, the condi￾tions, and so on. Versatile voyage control, which is commonly known as the self-governing 
control, is the propelled adaptation of the CCS that programs changes in vehicle speed to 
keep up the ideal division from vehicles ahead [5–8]. In versatile CCS, the vehicles unsur￾prisingly affect the traffic qualities, which include wellbeing, proficiency, and limits due to 
more extraordinary conduct contrasted with the driver. Presently, the structure of versatile 
CCSs are, for the most part, chiefly for utilization with homogeneous traffic practices and 
unpredictable CCS limit the driver under congestion conditions, including in thick urban 
traffic areas [9, 10].
The fundamental issue of the speed control framework is how to keep up the speed which 
is given by driver, known as the info signal. The ideal speed can be accomplished by various 
controllers, including PI controllers, PID controllers, fuzzy controllers, ANN controllers, 
state-space controllers, cascade controllers, and feed forward controllers. At the point when 
the demonstrating of the speed control framework is done, we structure the controller, for 
example the PID controller, which can be applied on our model. A solidness examination 
is additionally done which depends on the state-space model for the exchange work in the 
investigation. The investigation for speed control framework is additionally done by utiliz￾ing some advanced controller like a state space controller [11], neural controller [12], or 
canny controller for the speed control framework utilizing fuzzy control [13].
This paper presents the few controllers, for example FLC, PID, and PI controllers, at 
different conditions. At last, a similar appraisal of the effect of every controller in diverse 
circumstances on the framework execution is introduced and discussed.
26.2 Modeling of Cruise Control
The focus point of CCS is controlling the car speed with the goal that the system obeys the 
commands of the driver and keeps up speed at the desired level as shown in Figure 26.1 [14].

The command signal of the driver and the feedback signal which comes from the speed￾ometer prompts the CCS to change the speed of the vehicle by altering the motor choke 
point to increment or reduce the motor drive power. The CCS is really a close loop control 
framework. Here, the criticism is that comprising a speed sensor, commonly known as the 
speedometer, prevents utilizations to quantify the genuine yield signal. The model of vehicle 
on an inclined plane is given in Figure 26.2.
The longitudinal dynamic for the vehicle which is written on the basis of Newton’s force 
balancing equations is

where M dv
dt is the force due to the inertia, ɵ is the road grade, also known as the angle of 
inclination, Fd

friction force, N(Mgcosɵ) is Normal force, Faero is aerodynamic force, M is the mass of the 
car and driver, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and Ca is the aerodynamic coefficient. 
Motor power is produced by consuming the best possible measure of fuel that is infused 
in the vehicle by which a motor will make the vitality for moving the vehicle. The angular 
speed of the motor is straightforwardly relative to the linear speed. The streamlined drag 
power relies upon the speed of vehicle, drag coefficient, air thickness, and front territory 
of the vehicle. The rubbing force or friction force is otherwise called the normal force or 
natural force that is produced because of contact with the wheel and the road.

Here, K, T, α, and R are known as the gain of the system, time constant, time delay, 
and the radius of the wheel, respectively. The transfer function of this system is obtained 
by considering all the initial conditions to be zero. The complete transfer function is 
more complex, which contains the four poles and one zero at the origin, thus the sys￾tem is non-linear. The general parameter values are taken from [15]. Few values must 
be changing because sometimes the block diagram of the system may have different val￾ues providing for the computation. The values are k = 743, T = 1second, τ = 0.2second,

26.3 Controller Design
26.3.1 Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller
The PI controller is broadly utilized in mechanical application due to its straightforward 
structure, simple design, and low cost [16–18]. When the system is highly nonlinear, the PI 
controller is not used [19, 20]. This controller is used to remove the oscillation resulting in 
on-off controllers and the steady state error occurring due to the proportional controller. 
PI controllers are used when (a) noise and disturbance are present in large amounts during 
the operation of the process; (b) the process consists of only one energy storage element, 
such as an inductor or capacitor; or (c) the systems have large delays. The architecture of a

PI controller for a plant is given in Figure 26.3 [17] The autocalibration of a PI controller 
which is based on two frequency measurements is also discussed [21]. In this case the out￾put of the controller is
u (t) = K p * e (t) + KI
 * ∫ e (t) dt (26.10)
26.3.2 Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller
A PID controller is the ordinary control technique utilized in genuine applications [22, 
23]. The essential kinds of PID controllers are the parallel controller, sequential controller, 
and blended controller [24, 25]. The controllers utilized in industries are PID controllers 
or their advance version. The derivative controller is utilized to improve stability of the sys￾tem. Most of the control frameworks on the planet are worked PID controllers. The simple 
architecture of a PID controller for a plant is shown in Figure 26.4 [23]. 95% of industries 
use the PID type controller. In this controller the output is
u (t) = K p * e (t) + KI
 * ∫ e (t ) dt + KD * de(t)/dt (26.11)
where KP
, KI
, and KD are known as proportional, integral, and derivative constants. The 
difference between setpoint and the output is defined as the error e(t) and the controller 
output is u(t). The tuning of PID controllers is done with the Ziegler-Nichols Algorithm 
[26, 27]. The advanced version of this controller also discussed in [28–30].
26.3.3 Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) 
The FLC utilized in CCS framework have two inputs known as the error (e) or rate of 
change of error d(e) and single output. FLC framework comprises of three fundamental 
stages: fuzzification, fuzzy inference framework, and defuzzification [31, 32]. The primary 
stage is used to change the crisp values into fuzzy rules, the second stage processes the 
controller output and the input data are computed in the scope with the help of informa￾tion and rule bases. The defuzzification interface changes the ends reached by the interface 
mechanism into the output of the plant [33]. The simple block diagram of a plant with a 
fuzzy controller is shown in Figure 26.5 [34].
The Gaussian membership function of proposed FLCs for two input and one output are 
shown in Figures 26.6, 26.7, and 26.8, respectively. The basic membership functions are

Gaussian, Triangular, π-Shaped, Trapezoidal, generalized bell, and S-Shaped [35]. Due to 
the smoothness and concise notion, the Gaussian and bell membership functions are the 
more popular methods for fuzzy sets. Both curves have the advantage of being smooth and 
nonzero at all points. 
The modified fuzzy controller is also discussed in [36, 37]. The rule base is given in Table 
26.2. This table contains the seven membership functions for the input as error and the 
derivative of error. Therefore, a total of forty-nine rules was produced with this membership

Table 26.1. The corresponding abbreviations are:
Large Negative (LN) Large Positive (LP)
Medium Negative (MN) Medium Positive (MP)
Small Negative (SN) Small Positive (SP)

The explanation of Table 26.1 is understood as follows:
If the error is Large Positive (LP) and the rate of change of error is Small Positive (SP), 
then the output actuator is Medium Positive (MP).
If the error is Small Positive (SP) and the rate of change of error is Medium Negative 
(MN), then the output actuator is Small Negative (SN).
26.4 Simulation Results
In this work, the models are referred to as a controlled model and an uncontrolled model. 
First, the reaction of an uncontrolled model will be talked about as shown in Figures 26.9-

for zero is given in Figure 26.10. When both the friction and road inclination have been 
considered, then the system also consists of four poles and a zero. The performance of CCS 
with zero compensation is given in Figure 26.11. When the compensation is incorporated 
in the system, then the response changes as shown in Figure 26.12. It has been analysed 
from the above conditions that the response of the system in all of the cases is not providing 
the desired speed so there is a need for a controller to achieve the desired objective.

To get the improved results, we designed PI, PID, and fuzzy logic controllers to be incor￾porated into the system. The response of the system with the controller in all the situations 
or conditions is shown in Figures 26.13, 26.14, and 26.15.
The performance can be obtained at several conditions of friction coefficients and the 
angle of inclination with different controllers but we considered the three conditions relat￾ing with the friction and angle. The first condition is when the angle of inclination and 
friction are not considered in the system, then the performance of the system with the 
controllers is given as in Figure 26.13. The performance of the PI controller provides the 
oscillation and a greater peak value, but the performance of the PID and fuzzy controller 
is better than the Proportional Integral controller. The response of the system without a

controller is also given to provide a better comparison. In the second condition, when only 
the angle of inclination is considered in the system, the response of the plant with different 
controllers is shown in Figure 26.14. This performance of the CCS is shown when the zero 
compensation is incorporated in the system. The fuzzy controller reduced the oscillation as 
compared with the PI and PID controller. The third condition is when both friction and the

angle of inclination are considered in the system, then the response of the plant with dif￾ferent controllers are shown as in Figure 26.15. This performance of the CCS is also shown 
when the zero compensation is incorporated in the system. The PI controller provides large 
oscillation and uncontrolled response, but the PID and fuzzy controller reduced the oscil￾lation and provide a controlled response as shown in Figure 26.15.
We compared our results with [38] [39], which is better in the many situations including 
rise time, maximum peak value, settling time, maximum peak time, steady state value, etc. 
The performance of the controller is evaluated by the values of some performance criteria like 
rise time, maximum peak value, settling time, maximum peak time, steady state value, etc. 
These parameters are very important for analysis of the dynamic behaviours of the system. 
These parameters are compared in Table 26.3. By the analysis of the above table, it is analysed 
that the compensation incorporated in the system must get the desired objective. When both 
friction and angle of inclination are not considered, then the response gives the maximum 
peak. When both friction and angle of inclination are considered, then the response is getting 
the minimum peak. When friction is not considered then the response is getting the mini￾mum rise time and minimum settling time. To achieve the desired speed, the value of friction 
coefficient should be minimum or zero. In the comparison among the PI, PID, and fuzzy 
controller, the fuzzy controller provided more reliable performance in all situations. 
26.5 Conclusion
The mathematical model for CCS considered the friction coefficient and the angle of incli￾nation. It is analysed that zero compensation must be incorporated in the system to get the 
desired objectives. So, zero compensation is incorporated in the system and the purpose of 
PI, PID, and fuzzy controllers is presented in this paper. The controller is intended for CCS.

The comparative performance of the system with the PI, PID, and Fuzzy Controller are dis￾cussed in Table 26.3. The performance of the controller is evaluated by the values of some 
performance criteria like rise time, maximum peak value, settling time, maximum peak 
time, steady state value, etc. The performance of the different controllers have been com￾pared for different values of friction and angle of inclination of the road. Better results and 
good stability were obtained with the help of a fuzzy logic controller. The CCS can improve 
the performance of dynamics of automobiles by reducing the effluences and improving the 
comfort level of the rider.

Abstract 
3D Printing or Digital Fabrication is one of the fastest emerging technologies in the manufacturing 
industry. It is widely being used for the mass customization and fabrication of any type of geomet￾rical design. Out of all 3D Printing techniques available, Fused Deposition Modelling is dominating 
the printing industry with its flexibility in materials for printing. It is widely being used in industries 
like aviation, healthcare, agriculture, and the automotive industry with a versatility in materials from 
thermoplastics to metals. However, the parts fabricated with FDM are still widely being used in 
prototyping, models, etc. and not in actual manufacturing industries for high-end products. This is 
because of the low strength of the parts which are not reliable for end-products. The introduction of 
fiber composites in FDM has solved this problem to a great extent by providing great improvements 
in mechanical properties of the printed products, but the performance of the FDM printed products 
is still low when compared to conventional machining processes. Numerous defects occur during the 
fabrication of these parts leading to undesirable properties. This chapter aims to present the materi￾als compatible with FDM, the various process parameters, and the mechanical properties of the 3D 
printed parts printed via FDM.
Keywords: Fused deposition modelling, 3D printing, polymers, mechanical properties
27.1 Introduction 
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a non-conventional process in which 
3-dimensional objects are fabricated by the addition of one layer after another of the mate￾rial from a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) or 3D model. Successive addition of layers of 
the material to create the final 3D object gives it the name Additive Manufacturing Standard 
(2012). Addition manufacturing or 3D printing is the process in which the successive addi￾tion of material leads to the fabrication of a final part instead of material subtraction, which 
is the case in conventional machining processes. 3D-printing gives physical shape to the 
geometrical representations of 3D models by adding layer after layer of the material to

create the final object (Haq et al., 2020). The term 3D printing is a collective term used for 
various additive manufacturing processes in which the basic principle is the fabrication of a 
3D object with the addition or deposition of the material where the material is then joined 
and solidifies to make the final product. This process is guided by computer control to 
create a 3D object from a CAD model with the help of various software (Cummins, 2010). 
Material is added layer by layer and then joined together. The material is fused, cooled, 
and deposited or solidified to create the 3D geometries without any complexity as in other 
machining methods. 3D printing is also known as digital fabrication or rapid prototyping 
(Baba et al., 2019). Various additive manufacturing techniques have been developed within 
just a span of roughly 25 years with applications in various fields like the automotive and bio 
industries, aerospace, and even in the food industry (Chadha et al., 2019).
The idea of 3D printing dates back to the 1950s. Raymond F. Jones described the idea of 
printing in his story “Tools of the Trade” published in Astounding Science Fiction magazine. 
The concept of 3-dimensional printing was mentioned again in the 1970s, but officially 
Charles W. Hull commercialized the first 3D printing processes in 1980 and submitted the 
first patent for SLA (Stereolithography) in August, 1984 (US Patent No. 4575330, 1984). 
The first object built by him was a 5cm tall cup. He noticed the fabricated sample lasted for 
months. He was the founder of 3D Systems Corporation and released their first 3D printer 
named SLA-1 on a commercial level, which used Stereolithography technique. SLA was the 
first commercial 3D printing technology developed. 
Until the 2000s, these 3D printers were quite expensive and often used for industrial 
purposes only. Around 2005, several initiatives were taken to develop low-cost printers for 
public use. A project named Rep Rap (Replicating Rapid Prototyping, using fluid filament 
fabrication derived by FDM by A. Bowyer was started at the University of Bath to prepare a 
3D printer capable of printing its own parts (Bowyer 2007). MakerBot Industries was estab￾lished in New York in 2006 based on this project and was acquired by Stratasys Inc. in 2013. 
The purpose of this open source initiative was to democratize the additive manufacturing 
from industries to the home manufacturing of 3D printing. Since the expiration of the first 
patents, a numerous increase in patents took place for various improvements, introducing 
new technologies in the field of 3D printing leading to a revolution in the industrial sector 
and innovations in various other sectors. Figure 27.1 shows some parts prepared by 3D 
printing by using the FDM method.
27.2 3D Printing Techniques
27.2.1 Stereolithography or Photo Polymerization
Stereolithography was the first commercialized 3D printing technique in 1986 and still 
widely used in the field of digital fabrication. It works on the principle of photo polymer￾ization. Photo-sensitive resins are used as feed material, then a UV laser assisted by CAD 
software is used to draw the design on the surface of these photosensitive resins. As soon as 
the UV light touches the liquid, the resin solidifies and forms a layer of the desired object. 
The platform lowers a bit and then another layer of the material is added and the pro￾cess continues with layer by layer addition of the photo-chemically solidified material to 
fabricate the final object. The final product is then washed off to remove extra resin and Mechanical Properties for 3D Printing of Polymers through FDM 337
supports are removed manually. This technique is mainly used for fabricating prototype 
models (Melchels et al., 2010). Various materials used are mainly thermosetting polymers 
and resins.
27.2.2 Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)
LOM is the process of using sheets of materials used to fabricate the final product. In this 
process, the adhesive-coated sheets of the material are rolled on the platform and usually a 
computer guided laser is used to cut the sheet in the desired shape. Then, the next layer is 
added and the process goes on to build a block of the final 3D object. These layers are joined 
together with the help of heat and pressure. Materials commonly used in this technique 
are adhesive-coated paper, plastic, and even metal laminates. This process allows coloured 
printing of the parts.
27.2.3 Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 
Selective laser sintering is a technique that uses a powerful laser to sinter the material 
which is in powder form. A high powered computer controlled laser beam is used to fuse 
the grain particles together of the materials to form the mass of the desired shape. The 
powder bed moves a little lower after every cross-sectional scan, a new layer of powder 
particles is added, and the process keeps on repeating in order to fabricate the final prod￾uct. The most common materials used are polymers, thermoplastics elastomers, and pol￾yaryletherketones (PAEK). This technique is mainly used in prototype fabrication (Kruth 
et al., 2005).

(c) surface texturing using FDM, (d) pump impellers.338 Optimization of Industrial Systems
27.2.4 Selective Laser Melting (SLM)
The working mechanism of SLM is similar to SLS. The only difference is the materials used 
in this process, i.e., metal and alloys. The metal grains are distributed on the indexing table, 
a high beam laser is used to melt these metal grains and these grains are fused together to 
give the geometric shape of the desired product, and then the next layer of metal grains is 
added and the process continues to fabricate the final product. The whole procedure is car￾ried out in a controlled and safe environment. The most common materials used are copper, 
stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, Ni based super alloys, etc. This process is mainly used 
to form complex and high strength geometrical parts (Kruth et al., 2005).
27.2.5 Binder Jetting 
In this process, the building material is in powder form and binder material is used as 
an adhesive to join the powder. The binder is in liquid form. The successive layers of the 
objects are printed with build material on the platform and binder liquid is spread with the 
help of an ink-jet print head and binds the material in the 2D desired pattern, one layer 
after another with each layer, and the build platform lowers to create space for next layer to 
be printed. Some post processing of the fabricated parts is required (Gaytan et al., 2015). 
Materials used in this techniques are polymers, ceramics, and even metals. This process 
allows coloured printing of the desired object. 
27.2.6 Directed Energy Deposition (DED)
In DED, the material used is metal granules or wire which are introduced to a strong laser 
beam and as a result the molten metal layer is formed on a substrate layer one after another 
to form the final structure. This method is also used for the coating of the fabricated struc￾tures. This is very precise as it can be directed to deposit the material in fine lines and can be 
used in repair of defected products. Materials used are chromium, phosphate, composites, 
etc. (Palmero & Bollero, 2020).
27.2.7 Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)
Fused deposition modeling is one of the most prominent 3D printing techniques being 
used today. It is one of the most widely used of all other printing processes as depicted 
by Wohler’s Report from Stratasys, Inc. FDM printers held 41.5% of the total 3D printing 
market share, as 15,000 commercial FDM printing machines were sold by the end of 2010 
(Parandoush & Lin, 2017). FDM based 3D printers are becoming more and more common 
in today’s manufacturing technology because they are easy to use and fabricate technology 
and are easily available at affordable prices even as home-based 3D printers. It is based on 
the melt extrusion process and FDM printing targets predominantly on using thermoplas￾tics and composites as processing material (Chapiro, 2016). Its easy availability makes it 
more favourable for many innovators who are working in 3D printing and the cost of FDM 
printers has dropped significantly today from $50,000 to $300.
The basic principle of FDM is based on the material melt extrusion process. The feed 
material in the form of filaments is fed with the help of various stepper motors. This filament Mechanical Properties for 3D Printing of Polymers through FDM 339
is melted with the help of heated liquefier just before entering the nozzle. The nozzle depos￾its the heated material in the desired geometrical shape controlled by pre-programmed 
software. This addition of on layer after another gives the final shape to the 3D object. 
Materials used in FDM are mainly thermoplastics, thermosetting polymers, composites, 
fiber reinforced thermoplastics, and even metals. FDM has gained a lot of attention in var￾ious industries, especially in the field of aviation due to its lightweight production of the 
parts.
The quality of the products or parts printed with FDM depends on printing parameters 
and can be controlled by changing these parameters, for example print orientations, air gap, 
layer thickness, raster width, and raster angle.
27.3 Materials 
3D Printing materials need to be of higher quality in any manufacturing process to meet 
the specifications required to build the quality of products, as these 3D printing techniques 
are capable of fabricating high-end fully functional parts. A wide range of materials are 
being used in various 3D printing techniques at present (Tofail et al., 2018). Some of the 
commonly used materials are discussed below.
1. Polymers
Polymers are one of the most common materials being used in 3D printing, 
mostly in FDM. 3D printing technologies are broadly being used worldwide 
for the fabrication of prototypes and complex functional parts with poly￾mers as fabrication material. FDM covers almost 46% of the total 3D print￾ing industry and this technique uses various thermoplastic filaments and 
fiber reinforced composites. Some of the polymers used are Acrylonitrile 
Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polypropylene (PP), 
or Polyethylene (PE) and recently, the high melting point thermoplastics 
PMMA and PEEK were introduced (Caminero et al., 2018). Most of these 
thermoplastics or thermosetting materials are low cost and can be easily 
acquired.
2. Metals
3D printing with metals is gaining broad attention in many sectors like auto￾mobiles, the medical industry, the manufacturing industry, and aerospace 
because of the high strength physical properties of the fabricated product and 
that these techniques can construct complex geometrical shaped objects as 
is required in aerospace and medical printing (Horst et al., 2018). Common 
metals used are Cobalt-based alloys, Nickel-based alloys, Aluminium alloys, 
Titanium alloys, and Stainless Steel.
3. Ceramics
3D printing technologies have been developed that can print 3D objects 
with ceramics and concrete as feeding material with a reduction in cracks 
and voids in the final product, improving the mechanical properties of the 
products. This can be done with various optimizations in process parame￾ters. Some of the materials used are Alumina, Zirconia, and bioactive glass in 340 Optimization of Industrial Systems
various manufacturing sectors with a wide variety of applications (Owen et 
al., 2018).
4. Smart Materials
Smart materials are materials that can change the shape and size of the object 
in accordance with environmental conditions such as heat and water. These 
materials are mostly classified as 4D printing materials. Some of the materi￾als include shape-memory polymers (Yang et al., 2016) and shape-memory 
alloys (Nickel-Titanium) (Van, 2018).
5. Composites
Composites materials are widely being used in various 3D printing tech￾niques because of their improved and tailorable properties, low weight and 
high-end mechanical properties. Composites and Fiber reinforced polymer 
composites are being adopted by various industries. Some of the commonly 
used composite materials are : Glass fiber reinforced composites, carbon fiber 
reinforced composites, Kevlar fibers, various natural fiber reinforced com￾posites etc. These composites are preferable because they can be designed in 
accordance with the required mechanical and thermal properties with differ￾ent mixtures of the fiber contents. Composites are more preferred materials 
due to their changeable and tailored properties (Hao et al., 2018).
27.4 Studies Related to Behaviour of 3D Printed FDM Parts
A number of studies have been conducted on studying various properties such as flex￾ural strength and tensile strength of the 3D printed parts. The effect of various process 
parameters such as infill density, infill pattern, bed temperature, etc. has been studied. For 
example, Li et al. (2016) conducted an experiment on three specimens of PLA, i.e., 98% 
pure PLA, carbon-fibre reinforced PLA, and modified CFR PLA. The authors reported 
that the modified CFR composites had a higher flexural and tensile strength of 164% and 
13.8%, respectively, than the original CF reinforced specimens. This study shows that the 
surface modification done on interfacial strength of the FRC played a vital role in increas￾ing the tensile and flexural strength of the samples. Both the CF-PLA and modified FRC 
PLA showed extreme loading capacity compared to the normal pure PLA polymer. Further, 
the modified CF samples were noticed to have an almost void-free microstructure which 
results in better wetting and firm interface of the matrix.
Another study was conducted by El Magri et al. (2019) with short CF-reinforced PLA 
composites to investigate the mechanical properties. It was observed here that process 
parameters influence the mechanical properties of the resulted samples. Effects of infill line 
orientation and nozzle temperature on mechanical properties of short CF-reinforced PLA 
composites were mainly investigated. 
 A nozzle temperature of 230° led to maximum tensile properties for both PLA and CF/
PLA composites with an infill orientation combination of combination [0°, 15°,15°] relative 
to the long axis of the test bar yielded the highest tensile properties. It was also observed 
that fast heating and cooling cycles involved in FDM and the heat transport characteristics 
of the polymer play an important role in the characteristics of the crystallinity and mechan￾ical properties of the material.Mechanical Properties for 3D Printing of Polymers through FDM 341
Bettini et al. (2017) also conducted a study with PLA as a matrix polymer and contin￾uous fiber reinforcement aramid fiber material. This study focused mainly on the fabrica￾tion of different types of geometries (square, cylindrical, rib-shaped elements, a T-section 
beam). The results were then compared with pure PLA polymer parts and the PLA-Aramid 
fiber and the reinforced polymer showed remarkable characteristics in terms of mechani￾cal properties. The tensile strength was 6 times more and the tensile modulus was 3 times 
higher in PLA-Aramid composite compared to pure PLA. 
Another work was performed by Heidari-Rarani et al. (2019) on the characterization of 
mechanical properties of continuous CF reinforced PLA composites. The results showed a 
considerable increase in the bending and tensile strength of CCFR-PLA by 108% and 35%, 
respectively. Morphological analysis showed an effective surface preparation of CF with 
PLA. Delamination-induced-matrix cracking and delamination were found to be the most 
dominating defects.
Haq et al. (2017) investigated the mechanical properties and characterization of 
Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Polycaprolactone (PCL) composite material to check their 
suitability as biomaterials. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) was used for the charac￾terization of the PLC/PLA composite. Polycaprolactone was used as the biodegradable 
material in this study. PLA weight percentage was kept between 10% to 50%. FTIR 
analysis showed that an increase in the PLC content led to an increase in morphological 
spectra with decreasing PLA content. Mechanical properties like the impact strength, 
Young’s Modulus, and tensile strength increase with the increment of PCL contents in 
the composite with PCL at 70 wt% and PLA at 30 wt%. Flexural strength also showed 
the highest results with 30 wt% PLA. All these results point out of a strong and flexible 
elastomer.
In a similar work by Li et al. (2018) the mass analysis and mechanical properties of PLA 
and carbon fiber reinforced (CF)/PLA-laminated specimens were investigated. The pur￾pose of the research was to reduce the weight of the CF reinforced samples with the help of 
binding layers as an approach.
Material for the fabrication of the specimens used are Pure PLA thermoplastic and short 
carbon fiber reinforced PLA composite and composite laminated samples with 15 vol% of 
short carbon fiber reinforcement in the composite. A total of 4 types of specimens were 
tested and compared, which include Pure PLA, CF/PLA, and two types of laminated speci￾mens: 2 layer (1 PLA, 1 CF/PLA) and 3 layer ( middle layer CF/PLA). 
It was found that the laminated samples were light in weight with better tensile strength 
and flexural strength than pure PLA, especially 2-layer PLA. Although, the binding layer 
strength of the laminated composites was found to be a little lower than pure PLA. These 
composites can contribute to the aerospace industry to a great extent due to their contribu￾tion to less weight construction.
Lebedev et al. (2018) also investigated the mechanical properties of PLA based compos￾ites fabricated by FDM and made a comparison with pure PLA polymer and samples made 
by conventional methods like hot pressed machining.
Fillers used were pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes, Wood Flour, and metal pow￾ders such as bronze and copper. Filler contents were kept between 0-30% in the PLA matrix. 
PLA/filler composites showed much better results than pure PLA, but the samples prepared 
by the hot pressed process had much higher mechanical properties than FDM fabricated 
parts. The authors attributed the behaviour to void formation, poor adhesion, and that 342 Optimization of Industrial Systems
porosity led to poor mechanical performance of the FDM fabricated parts compared to 
conventional machining.
Another study conducted by Akhoundi et al. (2019) used PLA as matrix thermoplastic 
and continuous glass fiber yarn as reinforcement material. This study mainly focused on 
the maximum amount of fiber content that can be used to improve the mechanical prop￾erties of the printed parts. Also, various raster deposition patterns were analyzed. Various 
parameters (diameter, fiber yarn laying pattern, flow percentage, layer height, and extrusion 
width) of fiber volume were also taken into consideration.
The results showed that a maximum of 50% fiber-volume content can be achieved result￾ing in high tensile yield strength and modulus for PLA-glass fiber yarn reinforced compos￾ites with a rectangular laying pattern, layer heights of 0.22 mm, flow percentage of 0.43, and 
extrusion width of 0.3 mm. 
Wang et al. (2019) conducted a study to produce natural fiber reinforced composites 
using PLA as matrix material and Bamboo Powder (BP) treated with various nanoparticles.
The filaments of BP/PLA were treated with nanoparticles of calcium carbonate (CaCo3), 
cellulose nanofibers (CNF), and micro-crystalline cellulose (MCC) using impregnation 
modification using both one-step and Two-step methods. The tensile strength of the fil￾aments was produced using a one-step method improved remarkably by the addition of 
nanocomposites MCC, CaCO3, and CNF. Although, the elongation at the break of nanopar￾ticle treated BP/PLA was found to be lower than BP/PLA filaments and the nano CaCO3
was found be a little better than the MCC and CNF modifications. These three nanoparti￾cles had different effects on the properties of the resulting composites.
Gavali et al. (2020) conducted a study with PLA as matrix material and chopped carbon 
fibers as reinforcements to investigate the thermomechanical and mechanical properties of 
the resulting composites with different CF percentages (12%, 15%, 20%) in the reinforced 
composite filament for FDM printing compared with pure PLA.
Samples with 15 wt% of CF reinforced composites showed, overall, superior mechanical 
and thermomechanical properties to all other samples. Results showed the enhanced and 
largest mean value of flexural and tensile strength as 22% and 32%, respectively, with the 
addition of 15 wt% of CF reinforcement. With the help of dynamic mechanical analysis 
(DMA), an increase of 18% in a storage modulus and a 30°C glass transition temperature 
was observed in 15 wt% CF. High thermal stability was achieved in samples with 15 wt% 
CFRs, as revealed by TGA testing, as the sample had a higher degradation temperature 
than the other two samples. Although, the hardness value and impact strength were also 
increased by 85% and 53%, respectively, with the addition of 20 wt% CFRs.
Kim et al. (2017) conducted an experimental study on mechanical properties of single 
and dual material samples fabricated using FDM. PLA and ABS were used as filaments 
for that printing of samples. Process parameters like orientation angles, infill density, and 
structural arrangement were also taken into consideration while printing dual material.
ABS and PLA percentages of 20%:80%, 40%:60%, and 50%:50% was used for the fabrica￾tion of the samples. It was observed that PLA based samples printed in X- direction with a 
100% fill rate showed best mechanical properties. However, during the dual printing, unsta￾ble extrusion was noticed which led to poor functional properties. Modification in struc￾tural design was done adding vertical lines and horizontal layers during printing. Results 
showed that structural design during multimaterial printing led to changes in mechanical 
properties and should be taken into consideration while working with multimaterials.Mechanical Properties for 3D Printing of Polymers through FDM 343
Ning et al. (2017) investigated a the outcomes of the process parameters of Fused 
Deposition Modelling (like infill speed, layer thickness, raster angle, nozzle temperature) 
on tensile properties of the Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Plastic Composites or CFRP. It was 
found that all these parameters played a major role in the tensile properties of the poly￾mer composite. Samples with a Raster angle of [0, 90] showed a significantly higher tensile 
strength, yield strength, and Young’s modulus as compared to a raster angle of [-45, 45]. The 
reason indicated by fracture interfaces was the efficient distribution of tensile load by matrix 
material (ABS) to carbon fibers in CFRP composite samples fabricated at a raster angle of 
[0, 90]. Billah et al. (2019) also worked on the thermal analysis of thermoplastic filled with 
chopped short fiber, ABS used as matrix thermoplastic, and chopped short-carbon fiber as 
reinforcement composites. The thermophysical properties of pure ABS and short CFR-ABS 
were investigated. Thermomechanical analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and differen￾tial scanning calorimetry were conducted. It was found in TGA analysis that the introduc￾tion of chopped CF (20 wt%) into ABS matrix led to a decrease in thermal stability of the 
composite because thermal conductivity of CF is superior to ABS, which leads to higher 
thermal gradient within the matrix, making it unstable. The DSC tests showed that addition 
of short CF (20wt%) into the matrix led to a slight decrease in glass transition temperature 
compared to neat ABS. In TMA, ABS/CF showed lower thermal expansion than neat ABS 
polymer but an increased expansion was noticed in ABS/CF after the transition region. 
Hence, ABS/CF composite was found to be less thermally suitable at low temperatures than 
pure ABS.
Prusinowski & Kaczynski (2020) conducted a study on tribological behaviour of continu￾ous fiber reinforced thermoplastic in dry and wet conditions. ABS was used as matrix poly￾mer and continuous carbon fiber as a reinforcement. Asymmetric feeding heads were used 
for the feeding of matrix material to form the CFR-ABS composite material. Tribological 
parameters like pressure and sliding speed were given preference. Tribological tests were 
carried on a pin-disc sliding test system in both air and water. Composite with 9.43% rein￾forcement volume showed better tribological properties. The mass wear intensity of the 
reinforced composite was low in the case of wet friction (in water) compared to dry friction. 
Reduction in the kinematic friction coefficient was also observed in wet environments due 
to the addition of CF in the matrix as water acted as a lubricant reducing the heat generated 
during friction. Fiber reinforced composite showed a 2 times lower friction coefficient and 
10 times less wear intensity in case of wet conditions. Fiber contents played a major role in 
improving the tribological properties of the reinforced composite as the material without 
fiber reinforcement showed a high wear rate regardless of the working environment. In 
another study conducted by Ning et al. (2017), a comparison was done of the two reinforce￾ments introduced in ABS as matrix material, i.e., carbon fibre and graphite-reinforced ABS 
composite fabricated using the FDM method. Porosity and tensile properties were evalu￾ated and compared of the two composites. All other criteria and conditions were set similar 
to the previously discussed study. Both the reinforcements infused in the filament were at 
5wt%. It was found that the porosity of the fabricated samples of graphite induced samples 
was much lower than the carbon fibre ABS composite. Although, carbon fibre reinforced 
composite showed better tensile properties overall than the graphite/ABS sample. Also, the 
raster angle in the case of GR/ABS samples showed no effect.
Another study was conducted by Weng et al. (2016) with nanocomposites of Acrylonitrile 
Butadiene Styrene as matrix polymer and Organic Modified Montmorillonite (OMMT) 344 Optimization of Industrial Systems
nanocomposites. Mechanical and thermal properties were measured of the different sam￾ples created with a varying ratio of OMMT powder (1wt%, 3wt%, 5wt% of ABS pellets). 
DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) was carried out for the storage modulus which 
also showed positive results in ABS and its nanocomposites. Thermal analysis showed that 
there was a negligible change in the volume of the material which led to minimum warping 
and no deformation. TGA and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for thermal analysis 
showed that OMMT acted as a good insulator and increased the thermal stability of the 
matrix material. Glass transition temperature (Tg) also showed better results with a grad￾ual increase of OMMT content in the nanocomposites. 
Dul et al. (2016) used ABS as matrix polymer with graphene nanoplatelets (xGnP). 
Various tests were performed on samples fabricated with various build orientations in 
FDM. Filler content was kept at 4 wt%. Increase in the elastic modulus was noticed with 
the amount of xGnP. Dynamic storage moduli also showed positive results in the fabricated 
samples along three build orientations due to the addition of xGnP in matrix material. Also, 
a better thermal stability was achieved with graphene nanocomposites in the ABS matrix, 
however a decrease in stress and strain was noticed in fabricated parts with the addition of 
xGnP. Increase in graphene content led to a slight reduction in ultimate tensile stress and 
strain in vertical and horizontal fabricated samples and a more severe effect was noticed 
along the perpendicular direction of the samples. This shows the different effects on proper￾ties of the fabricated samples with respect to different build orientations. Creep compliance 
was also reduced significantly with the addition of graphene nanofillers.
Riddick et al. (2016) also studied the effects of build orientations and directions on the 
mechanical properties of fabricated samples of ABS polymer. ±45° horizontally fabricated 
specimen showed the greatest elongation at the break value. It was revealed in fractographic 
analysis that the voids were filled more accurately in side build samples. Vertically fabri￾cated specimens showed lower tensile load bearing capacity than the horizontal and side 
build specimens.
Wang et al. (2016) Conducted a study to minimize void formation between the depo￾sition layers in FDM printed parts by adding thermally expandable microspheres into the 
matrix polymer. The fabrication process was conducted with thermal treatment to counter 
this problem. The aim was to study and show the effects that occurred in tensile and inter￾laminar properties of the matrix material due to the addition of thermally expandable 
microspheres under proper thermal treatment which had a positive impact on mechanical 
properties of the fabricated parts. Experiments showed that an increase in microsphere 
content lead to more and better compressive and tensile strengths. The results were similar 
to (Triantou & Tarantili, 2014) reinforced materials in matrix polymers, as microspheres 
without any expansion led to higher modulus and strength compared to matrix material. 
Khonakdar (2015) showed that adding more than 8 wt% microspheres made the dispersion 
difficult as microspheres expanded agglomerate further. Meanwhile, similar experiments 
were conducted by different researchers with CFR into matrix materials for better mechan￾ical strength and modulus. For example, Gray IV et al. (1998) used thermotropic liquid 
crystalline polymer fibrils with a matrix of polypropylene. Zhong et al. (2001) used short 
glass fiber reinforced ABS and added plasticizer and compatibilizer to improve feedstock 
processibility. Mechanical properties were enhanced in all these studies and these were used 
as backed up data for a current study by the researchers.Mechanical Properties for 3D Printing of Polymers through FDM 345
Milosevic et al. (2017) conducted a study for the characterization of the mechanical 
properties of polypropylene composites reinforced with natural fibers. Filaments were fab￾ricated with different contents of hemp or harakeke as reinforcement material and recycled 
polypropylene as matrix material. Tensile testing was conducted and then a comparison 
was made with plain polypropylene fabricated samples. 
Samples were prepared varying from 10-30 wt% fiber contents along with 2 wt% Maleic 
Anhydride Grafted Polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent (Pickering, Efendy, & Le, 
2016).
When compared with plain polypropylene filament, the filament made from the rein￾forced composites with 30 wt% hemp or harakeke showed a significant increase in the 
Young’s modulus and tensile strength by 143% and 50%, respectively. However, the desired 
similar improvement was not achieved in FDM fabricated samples as in filament. But, in the 
case of harakeke reinforced samples, an increase of 49% in tensile was recorded over plain 
polypropylene for 20 wt% harakeke. Porosity and fiber pullout were observed in FDM fab￾ricated parts, but dimensional stability was noticed in reinforced composite during FDM 
fabrication.
Zhou et al. (2017) conducted a study to investigate the application of Polypropylene 
(PP) and Polycarbonate composite in FDM with and without PE-c-GMA. The material 
used was polypropylene (Pro-fax SR256M) and carbon fibre Lexan 141R. A compari￾son was made of mechanical properties of original PP/PC composite and PP/PC with 
PE-c-GMA and it turns out PP/PC with PE-c-GMA had better generalized mechani￾cal properties. However, samples of the original PP/PC blend showed an improved part 
ductility. Build orientation played an important role in the mechanical properties of the 
fabricated samples. The addition of PE-c-GMA led to better adhesion between PP/PC. 
Process parameters like deposition at different speeds led to changes in mechanical prop￾erties also.
Gnanasekaran et al. (2017) worked on a novel polymer nanocomposite of carbon nano￾tubes (CNT) and graphene-based polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). Electrical conductiv￾ity, printability, and mechanical properties before and after fabrication were investigated 
and compared. The material used was PBT (Polybutylene terephthalate) as a base poly￾mer, graphite (graphene), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The resulting PBT powder 
was coated with conductive fillers for better conductivity in filaments. The graphene based 
specimens were rough and brittle when compared to CNT based composite filaments. This 
was due to the moisture evaporation from graphene content which led to the formation of 
voids on the surface of fabricated samples when processed at high temperatures. LC-STEM 
imaging of the samples of PBT/G showed that graphene platelets smoothly dispersed in the 
matrix material of PBT.
Electrical conductivity analysis showed that at least 0.49 wt.% of CNT (0.31 vol.%) and 
5.2 wt.% (∼ 3.3 vol.%) of graphene is necessary for the fabrication of conductive filaments 
of PBT/G and PBT/CNT. TGA analysis showed that the addition of conductive fillers led 
to better thermal stability and higher degradation temperature. PBT/CNT had higher ther￾mo-oxidative stability than graphene based filaments. Carbon nanotube based composite 
also showed better mechanical properties than the PBT/G. Overall, PBT/CNT showed bet￾ter functional properties in the case of thermal conductivity, mechanical properties, etc. 
than graphene based samples.346 Optimization of Industrial Systems
Liao et al. (2018) conducted work on the various thermal and mechanical properties of 
the composite samples. Polyamide 12 used as matrix material and carbon fiber as reinforce￾ment in samples with different mass fractions of CF/PA 12 filament were fabricated with a 
carbon fiber content of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt%. Carbon fiber with 10wt% led to a significant 
increase in tensile and flexural strength by 102.2% and 251.1%, respectively, without chang￾ing the impact properties. There was a remarkable improvement by 277.8% in thermal 
conductivity of the CF/PA 12 composite samples shown by Laser-flash diffusivity analysis 
along the printing direction. Degradation and crystallization peak temperature were also 
improved with 10 wt% CF. Raster orientation played a major role in all these enhancements.
Hao et al. (2018) also conducted a study with continuous carbon fibers as reinforcement 
in thermosetting composites and characterization of mechanical properties of the printed 
samples. An epoxy resin (E-54(616) was used as a thermosetting matrix and carbon fiber 
bundle (HF10, 3000) was used as a reinforcement material. The honeycomb, grid, nuts, and 
lamina structures were printed through FDM and heat treated for curing.
A three-point bending test and tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical 
properties of the resulting continuous CF-reinforced thermosetting composites. The results 
were ten compared with the short carbon fiber thermosetting composites and continuous 
carbon fiber thermoplastic composites. It was clear from the comparison that the contin￾uous carbon fiber reinforced thermosetting composites showed much better mechanical 
properties, particularly in tensile strength and elastic modulus compared to the other two 
composites. 
Bi et al. (2018) worked on the fabrication of wood flour/thermoplastic polyurethane 
(WF/TPU) composite parts with the help of FDM. Various filaments with varying contents 
(Five different filaments with different contents of WF (10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, 40 wt% 
and 50 wt%)) and different modifiers with TPU/WF composite were made. Mechanical 
properties, chemical structures, and microtopography of the 3D printed products were 
investigated.
The materials used were Elastollan TPU C95A and Wood Flour and the modifiers used 
were EPDM-g-MAH and POE-g-MAH, Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000), Chitosan 
and Diphenylmethyl Propane Diisocyanate (MDI). To explore the effect of different WF 
contents on mechanical properties of composites, these modifiers were then mixed with 
various WF contents. A fixed ratio of WF/TPU with different mixtures of modifiers were 
prepared to study the effects of modifiers.
The results showed that low WF content resulted in low tensile strength. At 40% WF con￾tents, the composite showed maximum tensile strength. TPU/WF composites also showed 
good flexibility. A good fiber/matrix adhesion was obtained up to 40% WF content. In the 
case of modifiers, a 20% content of WF and 5% modifier of TPU was unchanged and the 
EPDM-g-MAH-modified TPU/WF had the highest storage and loss modulus. The elastic￾ity of the resulting composite also increased. The EPDM-g-MAH modifier led to increased 
adhesion interface between the TPU matrix and WF which resulted in high resistance to 
flow. The EPDM-g-MAH-modified composites showed the highest elongation at the break 
with an increase of 100.14% when compared to unmodified TPU/WF composite. The MDI￾modified WF/TPU composites showed an increase of 22.33% tensile strength which was 
the highest of all other modifiers. The flexible WF/TPU composite material developed in 
this study is suitable for various applications in FDM printing. This study shows the scope of 
increasing interfacial adhesion and flexibility of the composites by adding these modifiers.Mechanical Properties for 3D Printing of Polymers through FDM 347
Lin et al. (2019) conducted research to study the tribological properties of pure 
Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) coated with carbon fiber (CF) reinforced PEEK with the help 
of FDM. CFR-PEEK was printed on PEEK backing through FDM and the tribological 
properties of the coating were investigated with and without the nanosilica between the 
friction interfaces.
Distribution of the CF within the PEEK matrix was found to be homogeneous. CF/
PEEK was slid against a steel ring and then nanosilica was introduced between the con￾tact interface to evaluate the effects on the coating. Fiber orientation played a major role 
in the friction and wear properties of the printed coating. The introduction of nanosilica 
led to a reduction in th friction coefficient in both orientations, although in the case of 
90° fiber orientation, nanosilica led to a decrease of a 40% sliding friction coefficient 
due to rolling particles of nanosilica, which was not the case with wear of the CF/PEEK 
composite coating, as no obvious improvement in wear resistance was observed with the 
introduction of nanosilica as the rigid particles of nanosilica led to abrasion of the PEEK 
matrix.
Wang et al. (2020) also worked with Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) reinforced with short 
carbon fiber (CF) and glass fiber (GF). Different fiber contents (5%, 10%, 15%) were used to 
prepare composite filaments through extrusion and characterization was done.
Performance was evaluated of the parts of GF/CF-PEEK composite printed through 
FDM. Crystallinity, morphology, and thermal properties of the prepared filaments were 
measured and mechanical characterization (porosity, surface quality, mechanical proper￾ties, and microstructure) of the printed parts was investigated. The results showed that the 
thermal stability of the GF/CF-PEEK was better than the pure PEEK with an increase in 
fiber weight volume which led to enhanced crystallization, thermal degradation tempera￾ture, and melting point of the reinforced composites. Interfacial bonding of GF/PEEK was 
better compared to CF/PEEK. This resulted in poor molecular chain movement of PEEK 
which led to lower crystallinity and melting fluidity than CF/PEEK. Although flexural 
strength, ductility, tensile strength, and impact strength of both the reinforced composite 
was superior to pure PEEK, only a low fiber content of 5 wt% noticeably improved surface 
quality, mechanical properties, and low porosity of the fabricated samples. The highest 
tensile and flexural properties (19% and 17%, respectively) of GF/PEEK and CF/PEEK 
were obtained at 5 wt% fiber content. Increase in fiber content led to deterioration in 
mechanical properties. More porosity was noticed with increased fiber contents, especially 
in CF/PEEK samples. Fiber orientations aligned with deposition led to improved mechan￾ical properties. 
Ranganathan and Palanivelu (2020) conducted a study on enhancing the tribological 
properties of the reinforced composite material with Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol 
(PETG) as a matrix material reinforced with Carbon Fiber (CFPETG) fabricated with 
FDM with different infill densities (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) under annealed conditions were 
investigated.
The results showed an improvement in coefficient of friction and wear rate in CFPETG 
compared to pure PETG fabricated samples with high infill density percentages. The 
annealed CFPETG with 100% infill density showed the best results in the case of friction 
coefficient and wear resistance. The annealing route and infill density resulted in the best 
bonding between the CF and matrix material, leading to great tribological properties of the 
resulted reinforced composite parts fabricated using FDM.348 Optimization of Industrial Systems

27.5 Conclusions and Future Scope
3D Printing of structures fabricated from composite materials can be a boon to the manu￾facturing industry. The characteristics of composite-reinforced filaments with controllable 
properties tends to be favourable for innovative production and designs. The endless com￾binations of composites and thermoplastic polymers gives us the upper hand in customized 
production of desired products. Research indicates that most of the previous work done 
is with Polylactic Acid (PLA) and ABS. Parameters like raster angle, orientations of the 
fibers, and infill density were found to be the most influential factors when working with 
fiber reinforced composites, as these process parameters played an important role in the 
mechanical properties of the fabricated specimens. It was also found that addition of cer￾tain modifiers can help improve the mechanical properties of the FRCs. Defects like void 
formation, uneven fiber distribution, and poor bonding between matrix material and fiber 
reinforcement were the most common defects.
Further, it came to the fore that quite a good number of studies have been carried out to 
study the behavior of 3D printed parts with the help of FDM and an abundance of data is 
available on commonly used thermoplastic materials like PLA and ABS. However, much 
less work has been conducted pertaining to thermal properties of the 3D printed parts. 
Furthermore, studies pertaining to composites developed through 3D printing have not 
focused enough on the effects of process parameters on the mechanical and thermal prop￾erties of these developed composites.

Abstract 
Glass fiber polymer composites possess a broad spectrum of applications in the spacecraft, automo￾tive, marine, and sports component industries. Due to enhanced features, this material is replacing 
the conventional engineering materials and their alloys. Its machining behavior requires more atten￾tion for proper utilization and makes them cost-effective. Some critical issues, such as fiber pull out, 
matrix debonding, resin pull out, etc., occur due to their anisotropic and abrasive nature. This can 
be overcome by machine performance optimization using hybrid modules. This article describes 
an experimental investigation on machining (Milling) of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) 
doped epoxy/GFRP composites and the effect of process parameters, such as spindle speed (S), feed 
rate (F), depth of cut (D), and MWCNT weight % (R%), on machining performances, such as MRR, 
cutting force (Fc), and Surface roughness (Ra), have been examined. A Taguchi based L9
 orthog￾onal array was employed to execute the machining. A relatively advanced combined approach of 
Data Envelopment Analysis based Ranking (DEAR) and Taguchi was used to tackle critical issues 
of multiple conflicting responses. The optimal condition of the DEAR-Taguchi approach was found 
at S2450F85D0.6R2%. It has been validated through a confirmatory test, which shows satisfactory 
improvement in machining performance. This enhancement is highly required for a cost-effective 
machining environment.

28.1 Introduction
For the last three decades, glass fiber was successfully used in polymer composites. It has 
become an alternative in the polymer manufacturing sector to fulfil the use of multifunc￾tional materials. It consists of high endurance limits, high resistance to corrosion, high 
rigidity density ratio, and low thermal expansion coefficients. A small product, such as a 
golf shaft, bicycle parts, aircraft interior, etc., especially GFRP, was preferred [1, 2]. In the

90s, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced to enrich epoxy composites’ mechanical 
aspects as the best possible fillers [3, 4]. SWCNTs (single wall) and MWCNTs (multi￾walling) depend on the number of tubes. CNTs’ epoxy-based nanopolymer composites 
are useful additives to modify epoxy structures to increase flexural modulus and bending 
strength [5, 6]. The proper utilization of any material is not feasible without understand￾ing its machining and machinability aspects. Primary machining processes such as drill￾ing, milling, turning, etc. are used in the manufacturing system to complete the product 
design. The manufacturing sector is changing rapidly to fulfill customers’ desire in terms 
of durability, lightweight, shiny appearances, and other aesthetic requirements [7, 8]. With 
these conditions, polymers (plastics) play a key role in maintaining the developed com￾ponents’ quality and productivity. In polymer materials, glass fiber reinforced composites 
are widely used in manufacturing sectors due to availability and cost-effectiveness [9], 
but there are some limitations in macro composites like aspect ratio, dispersion of fill￾ers, matrix, reinforcement bonding, etc. Nanocomposites’ developments overcome these 
issues by doping/mixing nanomaterials like CNT (SW/MW) and glass fiber into the epoxy 
matrix [10, 11]. 
28.2 Background and Problem Formulation
MWCNT reinforced epoxy materials possess enhanced mechanical and chemical prop￾erties to manufacture components in aircraft, biomedicine, sensors, optical devices, etc. 
[12-14]. Various eminent scholars explored their work for machining GFRP/CFRP/KFRP 
composites, but very limited information on machining of CNT doped GFRP nanocompos￾ites is available. In this series, Kishore Kumar et al. [15] conducted experimental research 
using CFRP and CNT doping. The epoxy resins were modified by 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 
0.4% of MWCNTs weight percent introduced to study the consequences of CNTs fillers. 
GFRP samples improved by 0.3% MWCNTs have higher tensile strength (242.22 MPa) and 
flexural strength (332.53 MPa) relative to neat GFRPs. The results proved that MWCNTs 
play a major role in improving material properties such as tensile, failure strain and dura￾bility. Dinesh Kumar Rathore et al. [16] investigated elevated glass fiber/epoxy composite 
MWCNT temperature durability. Flexural tests, in room temperature tests, demonstrated 
that the addition of 0.1% MWCNT for yielded maximum strength in all CNT modified 
composite systems (+ 32.8% over GE control) and modulus (+ 11.5% over GE control). 
MWCNT – GE composites have led to an accelerated decline in mechanical efficiency, 
while the temperature compared with GE composites has increased. The viscoelastic 
behavior of all composites over a temperature range has been studied through dynamic 
mechanical and thermal analysis (DMTA). Rahulreddy Chennareddy et al. [17] doped 
the MWCNTs scattered in the epoxy matrix to produce GFRP resistance for UV-positive 
composites was studied. Direct voltage tests of 0.25% wt.% GFRP, 0.5% wt.%, and 1.0% 
wt.% of MWCNTs show good UV-resistance and stability. Microstructural analysis shows 
that MWCNTs is able to prevent UV degradation of the polymer backbone caused by UV 
radiation in the GFRP. Scanning microscopy of the electron (SEM) images revealed that 
MWCNTs can handle UV-radiated microcracking and improve GFRP resistance to UV 
degradation. Mahmoud R. et al. performed [18] a bending test to determine the laminate 
bending strength of plastic reinforced carbon fiber joints. During the test, the specimen Optimization of MachiningCharacteristics of Polymer Nanocomposites 355
received two acoustic emission sensors (AE) to monitor the progress of the fracture. 
Increased bending strength and joint consistency were demonstrated by the laminated 
reinforced joints and some overlapping joints. The maximum increase for the laminated 
joint of 5 layers was 24% and the multichambered joint of 6 layers was 58%. J. Paulo Davim 
et al. (Paulo Davim & Mata, 2007) did experimental work on composite milling and the 
outputs considered were delamination related to the material characteristics and cutting 
parameters that have been conducted. A. I. Azmi et al. [19] examined a milling analysis 
of glass fiber composites using an uncoated carbide method. The experiments were per￾formed to test GFRP machinability in terms of tool wear, service life, machining efficiency, 
and machining powers. The cutting speed was recognized as the primary parameter to 
influence tool life with fiber orientation and feed rate. During the final milling tests, the 
machining force differences were monitored constantly due largely to the rise in tool wear 
and fiber orientation [20-22].
The prior state of the art confirmed that MWCNT doped epoxy and carbon fiber in the 
epoxy matrix possess a wide array of applications due to enhanced mechanical character￾istics. Ample work is available on machining GFRP composites using various cutting tools 
and optimization modules, but the existing data shows that very limited work is offered 
on parametric appraisal and machinability estimation of MWCNT modified glass fiber 
composites. This paper explores the machining behavior and parametric studies during 
milling operation. This work will add value to understanding the effects of varying process 
parameters, namely, spindle speed, feed rate, and wt.% of MWCNT on milling characteris￾tics viz, MRR, surface roughness and cutting force. For optimization, a relatively advanced 
hybridization approach of the DEAR and Taguchi concepts is proposed. Integrated DEAR￾Taguchi converted multiple responses transformed into a single objective function. Then, 
the DEAR-Taguchi hybrid module was utilized to acquire a feasible ranking order over all 
indexes of machining characteristics. The outcomes of the confirmatory test will justify the 
feasibility of the proposed hybrid method. This work can overcome the drawback and lim￾itations of the existing optimization approach.
28.3 Experimentation
28.3.1 Materials and Fabrication Method
During fabrication of MWCNT doped epoxy/GFRP composites, 200 GSM Plain Woven 
Glass Fabrics and Epoxy Resin-520 was used, supplied by M/s. and procured from M/s. 
Nanoscience Technology Company 468, Shihani Road, Nand Gram Meerut Road, 
Ghaziabad 201001, Uttar Pradesh, India. The reinforcement for MWCNT into epoxy com￾posites was varied at three distinct weight percentages (1, 2, 3 wt.%). The experiments were 
done on a vertical CNC (Figure 28.1) milling machine setup (Model No. BMV35 TC20) at 
three discrete levels (Table 28.1) of machine parameters including spindle speed (S), feed 
rate (F), depth of cut (D), and wt. % of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with a 
solid carbide of an 8 mm diameter milling tool. A Taguchi L9 array was used to perform 
the experimentation and corresponding observed data are mentioned in Table 28.2. The 
attached milling dynamometer measured the cutting force and for evaluation of surface 
roughness, a Surtronic S100 surface tester was used.356 Optimization of Industrial Systems

28.4 Parametric Optimization
A Taguchi based DEAR hybrid method was employed to optimize the parameters and 
their effect on responses simultaneously. The present studies aim to maximize MRR 
and minimize surface roughness and cutting force during milling of MWCNT/GFRP 
composites.
28.4.1 Taguchi Approach
A Taguchi based L9
 orthogonal array is a combination of all possible sets for a test. This 
effective technique is used to scrutinize the influence of the machine parameter through 
the minimum experiments’ order. The Taguchi method is used for a statistical scale for the 
single response used for computing the signal to noise ratio (S/N ratio) [23, 24]. In this case, 
the MRR was considered as a maximization function, i.e., the higher the better using the 
expression:

The cutting force (Fc) and surface roughness (Ra) values correspond to the minimization 
function, i.e., Lower the Better (LB) using the expression:

28.4.2 Data Envelopment Analysis Based Ranking (DEAR)
A set of observed responses are recorded into a ratio in this method. To achieve the optimal 
condition of the process parameters, it can be regarded as a multi-response performance 
index (MRPI) value [25]. The following steps are used for Ranking Methodology (DEAR) 
based on the data design analysis:
• Calculate the weights (w) of each response:

28.5 Results and Discussion 
For milling of GFRP Doped MWCNT composites, varying constraints were used and 
observed data was recorded through measuring methods and equipment. The weight of 
each milling characteristic was calculated using the DEAR methodology under different 
process parameter combinations. The consolidated MRPI for all factors at all levels is shown 
in Table 28.1. The experimental work results have been studied to determine the machin￾ing process as a higher material removal rate and minimum surface roughness and cutting 
force. The machining performance has been converted into the S/N ratio to eliminate the 
machining process’s uncorrelated factor (Table 28.3). Then, it normalized the machining 
response’s value into a specified quantity (weightage matrix), as depicted in Table 28.3. 
After calculating the normalized data of each response, the weight assigned for every 
response characteristic was calculated using Equations 28.3-28.5. Weight was assigned to 
each response using Equations 28.6-28.8 with the simple multiplication method. Finally, 
MRPI values were calculated for each process response corresponding to each experiment 
response. The maximum value of MRPI can be regarded as the optimal value of each pro￾cess parameter’s process variables. The higher value of the MRPI, which corresponds to 
input parameters was selected as the optimal machining condition based on the OA setting. Optimization of MachiningCharacteristics of Polymer Nanocomposites 359
Table 28.4 demonstrates (Figure 28.2) that spindle speed (2450 rpm), feed rate (85 mm/
rev), depth of cut (0.6 mm), and wt.% of MWCNT (3%) are noticed as the optimum param￾eters based on the DEAR-Taguchi predicted set. Table 28.4 shows the higher MRPI value 
obtained as 2.732374 and its corresponding rank.
The optimal setting during machining (milling) of MWCNT doped epoxy and glass fiber 
in polymer composites are found as S-2450 rpm, F-85 mm/min, and R-2 % with improve￾ment in milling characteristics, namely MRR, surface roughness, and cutting force found

as -26.6958 to -28.805dB, 9.379079 to 12.05dB, and 12.14136 to16.5dB, respectively. It is 
observed that higher spindle speed reduces the thrust force and reduces the value of thrust 
force corresponding to good surface finishing. The machined component’s surface plays an 
important role when a material is subjected to creep and fatigue loading, close fits, preci￾sion, fastener holes, riveting, and other aesthetic demands of the manufacturing processes 
[26, 27]. The results inferred that an increase in higher spindle speed, in this case, increases 
the temperature between the machining interface, which softens the polymeric material 
of the machining zone, which gives a lower value of thrust force with improved surface 
finishing [28, 29]. 
28.5.1 ANOVA Test
ANOVA for MRPI reveals that feed rate and cutting depth are important factors (p values < 
0.05 at a confidence level of 95%). The values were calculated as a contribution percentage 
based on a cumulative square value number and the depth of cut exerts the highest effect on 
MRPI (54.42 percent), followed by a feed rate (26.14 percent). The significance of ANOVA 
is shown in Table 28.5 closer to the unit value of R2
 (87.33% or 0.8733). The validation has 
been taken, as shown in Figure 28.3, to expect the correctness of the model. This makes it 
easier to understand the predicting model accuracy during trials. The initial validation pro￾cess involves a data subset into a graphical display. The data are direct and there is not much 
deviation, i.e., the test model’s projected result is found as satisfactory [30, 31].
The process parameter’s main effects are depicted in Table 28.6, used to evaluate the 
importance of performance measures of input process variables in every process. The plots 
showed that the depth of cut has the most critical effect on the removal rate and surface 
roughness. The depth of cut has the highest value of 1.6833, which is the highest affecting

parameter, followed by feed rate at 1.4567, which is the physical influence of the process’s 
performance. 
The lowest surface roughness can be achieved with spindle speed and minimum feed 
rate. With the lowest feed rate, the surface roughness gradually decreases along with an 
increase in spindle speed and remains merely unaltered at a spindle speed of 2450 rpm 
[32].
28.5.2 Confirmatory
The optimum combination for parameters is found as S2450F85D0.6R2%. Table 28.7 shows 
the outcomes of the confirmatory test. It can be noted that the DEAR-Taguchi hybrid 
approach considerably enhances the experimental value of surface roughness, cutting 
forces, and MRR. The desired improvement in the milling characteristics shows the appli￾cation potential of the proposed module.
28.6 Conclusion
This article demonstrates the milling investigation of MWCNT/glass fiber modified 
polymer composites using SiC cutting tools. The influence of process parameters on the 
MRR, cutting forces, and surface finish was analyzed using the DEAR and Taguchi theory 
approach. The outcome of this study can be concluded as:
• The DEAR based Taguchi module effectively aggregated the conflicting mill￾ing characteristics into the objective function (MRPI), which is not feasible 
by the traditional Taguchi concept. 
• DEAR is a relatively advanced optimization method in combination with the 
Taguchi concept, which gives an optimal condition of S2450F85D0.6R2%. 
• The ANOVA analysis highlighted that the depth of cut and cutting force pro￾cess parameters were considered for the influential parameter with 54.42% 
and 26.14%, respectively.
• The increase in speed improves the surface roughness values and the weight 
percentage of MWCNT plays a crucial role in obtaining the enhanced milling 
characteristics.

• The outcome of the confirmatory test shows a satisfactory improvement in 
milling characteristics for the desired machining environment. It can be for￾warded to the plastic manufacturer for the control of productivity and quality 
indices.
The integrated approach of DEAR based Taguchi method for machining of composites 
can be used for other multi-criteria case studies. It is a generalized optimization module 
that gives satisfactory outcomes during milling of MWCNT doped GFRP composites. It 
can be adapted for other machining operations such as turning, drilling, etc. Other param￾eters such as different types of tools, material removal mechanisms, tooltip temperature, 
cutting condition, etc. can be explored better in the future to comprehend MWCNT/GFRP 
composites’ machining behavior.

Abstract
Aluminum Metal Matrix composites are being used for a variety of industrial applications. The 
research being carried out to develop the new materials demands extensive experimentation before 
the material is actually subjected to ambient conditions. Thus, the selection of optimum parameters 
is a key for better performance of prepared materials. The use of optimization techniques has paved a 
way for the selection of different parameters while testing these composite materials. In this chapter, 
various studies related to the use of soft computing techniques to evaluate the mechanical and wear 
behavior of aluminum metal matrix composites have been discussed in detail. From the discussed 
studies, it has been observed that the use of computing techniques can result in the prediction of 
optimum conditions by carrying out a limited number of experiments. 
Keywords: Aluminum metal matrix composites, optimization techniques, wear, mechanical properties
29.1 Introduction
The use of Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites has gained much focus owing to its differ￾ent properties and applications (Kerni et al,. 2018; Haq et al., 2020; Ul Haq et al., 2021). A 
lot of research with the use of Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites has been carried out 
(Singh et., 2018) (Haq et al., 2018a) (Haq et al., 2018b). Different reinforcements have also 
been added to these composites in order to get the desired properties or to further enhance 
the existing properties (Slathia et al., 2018). Further, the functional performance of the 
prepared composites is dependent upon different parameters. Thus, it becomes imperative 
to identify the optimum set of parameters that could perform efficiently under the desired 
operating conditions. On the other hand, the preparation of these composites is a tedious 
process. Also, it is not possible to prepare and test each and every combination, particularly 
when there are large numbers of variables involved. Further, the time and cost associated 
with the complete process is also a challenging aspect. Thus, the use of soft computing

techniques has emerged as a promising solution to obtain the optimum parameters for 
composites with better properties. 
29.2 Soft Computing Techniques
Soft computing is a technique where we can find the solutions of complex problems. The 
results of the problem are not specific and are adaptive in nature (Ibrahim, 2016). Basically, 
it contains a set of algorithms and techniques that help in solving the complex problems 
and in getting optimal solutions of the problem. These techniques help in modelling and 
simulation of AMCs and can help in studying their mechanical and wear behavior. Further, 
it helps in predicting this behavior for different sets of combinations. In this chapter, various 
soft computing techniques used to analyze the mechanical and wear behavior of aluminum 
metal matrix composites have been discussed in detail. The studies performed by using 
different reinforcements have been elaborated to find out the optimum process parameters/
testing conditions.

29.3.1 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
An ANN is the most widely used soft computing technique to predict the mechanical and 
tribological properties of AMCs. For employing ANN, we basically need some experimen￾tal data that can help to train our network. In other words, ANN uses this data as a knowl￾edge bank for classifying the data and recognizing the pattern which helps for predicting 
the data. ANN has self-learning capabilities and these capabilities increase and become 
more accurate as more and more data is available that can help in producing and predicting 
better results. ANN consists of three layers: an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. 
Each layer of the ANN has a certain number of neurons and each neuron has an activation 
function which uses the input and certain weight to give the output to the next layer. The 
input layer consist of all the input variables that are being used in the network to produce 
and predict the results. The hidden layer is the intermediate layer between the input and the 
output layer and the number of neurons in the hidden layer depends on the data samples, 
input neurons, and the output neurons. The output layer is the final layer that gives the 
results after performing the calculations at the neurons in this layer. 
Different studies have been carried out using the ANN technique. Natrayan and Kumar 
(2020) used ANN technique to predict the hardness and tensile strength of AA 6061 hybrid 
composite reinforced with Al2
O3
, SiC, and graphite reinforcement in which casting pro￾cess parameters (squeeze pressure, melt temperature, die temperature, and pressure holding 
time) were varied. The results showed that ANN predicted the results with 95% accuracy. 
Nwobi-Okoye and Uzochukwu (2020) used ANN, RSM, and GA to predict mechanical 
properties of AA 6351 aluminum alloy reinforced with egg shell. Three input parameters 
were used for ANN (stirring speed, stirring time, and reinforcement preheat temperature) 
to predict two output responses (hardness and toughness). ANN predicted better results 
than RSM because of better learning accuracy. 
Idrisi and Mourad (2019) studied the wear behavior of the gear of AA 5083/SiC com￾posite reinforced with micro sized particles (5% and 10%) and nano sized particles (1% 
and 2%) using ANN at three different loads and four different experiment times with con￾stant rpm. A maximum of 6.46% error was observed in microsized reinforced composites 
and 7.61% maximum error was observed in nanosized reinforced composites. Alam et al. 
(2019) studied the wear behavior of A356/SiC nanocomposites at four different concentra￾tions, four sliding distances, four sliding speeds, and four different loads by using ANN. 
The predicted wear loss by ANN was compared with the experimental wear loss and a 
maximum of 6.77% error was reported. Daniel et al. (2019) studied the milling parameters 
of AA 5059/SiC/MoS2
 hybrid composite using ANN. Devadiga et al. (2019) used ANN 
to predict density and hardness of AMC fabricated by powder metallurgy in which vary￾ing wt. % of fly ash, carbon nanotubes, sintering time, and ball milling time were used an 
inputs. Nwobi-Okoye et al. (2019) used ANN and ANFIS as multiobjective optimizations 
for A356/cow horn particulate reinforced composites age hardening process parameters. 
Hardness and cost were predicted by ANN with a correlation coefficient value of 0.9926 by 
using temperature, reinforcement %, and time as inputs. The average relative error was less 
in ANN compared to ANFIS. Stalin et al. (2019) used ANN for predicting the wear rate of 370 Optimization of Industrial Systems
AA 6063/Si3N4 composites. A minimum wear rate of 0.000183 mm3
/min was obtained for 
9.892 wt. % reinforcement, 9.837 N load, 2.936 m/s sliding velocity, and 1130.7 mm sliding 
distance by GRA.
Kumar et al. (2018) used the back propagation technique in ANN to predict the wear 
loss of AA 6061/Al2
O3
 composite. The wt. % of reinforcement, load, sliding distance, and 
density were used as input parameters to predict the wear loss. Arif et al. (2018) used ANN 
to study the wear loss of Al-SiC hybrid composite reinforced with ZrO2
. The reinforcement 
wt. %, applied load, and sliding distance were used as input parameters to predict the wear 
loss and the predicted results were compared with the experimental results. It was found 
that sliding distance has a major impact on wear loss. Pramod et al. (2018) also used ANN 
to predict the wear loss of AA 7075/Al2
O3
 composite in which varying wt. % of reinforce￾ment, applied load, sliding distance, and density were used. Bongale et al. (2018) used ANN 
to predict the wear rate of a hybrid composite of aluminum reinforced with nano particles 
of SiC and E-glass fibre. Deviation between ANN predicted results and experimental results 
were between 0.15% to 8.09%.
Stojanovic et al. (2017) predicted the specific wear rate of hybrid A356 aluminum alloy 
with reinforcement of SiC and graphite using ANN. The concentration of graphite rein￾forcement, load, and sliding speed were used as input to predict the specific wear rate. 
The specific wear rate of hybrid composite decreased with increasing wt. % of reinforce￾ment and load. Soundararajan et al. (2017) predicted the mechanical properties of A413/
B4
C reinforced composite by using the back propagation technique in ANN. Kumar et 
al. (2017) also used the back propagation technique of ANN to predict wear loss of AA 
6061/TiO2
 reinforced composite with varying wt. % of reinforcement, load, and sliding 
distance. Babalola et al. (2017) used ANN to predict the yield strength, ultimate tensile 
strength and stress, microhardness, load for maximum extension, electrical resistivity, 
and conductivity of AMC reinforced with SiC. Mahdavi Jafari et al. (2017) used ANN 
to obtain the maximum hardness of AA 6061/MWCNTs nanocomposite. Amount of wt. 
reinforcement, sintering temperature, sintering time, compact pressure, milling time, 
and vial speed were used as input variables and hardness was the output parameter. The 
error obtained between predicted and experimental results was in the acceptable range. 
Kumarasamy et al. (2017) fabricated hybrid AMC using flyashcenosphere and graphite. 
ANN was used to predict the surface roughness of the composite while machining. The 
concentration of graphite, cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut were used as input 
parameters in ANN modeling. 
Saravanan and Senthilkumar (2015) used ANN to predict the wear rate and coefficient 
of friction of AMC reinforced with rice husk ash. The normal load, sliding speed, particle 
size, and wt. % of reinforcement were used as input parameters. ANN predicted the wear 
rate and coefficient of friction values with 95% accuracy. Karabulut (2015) used ANN to 
predict the surface roughness and cutting force of AA 7039/Al2
O3
 composite by using the 
ANN technique. Surface roughness was predicted with 97.75% accuracy and cutting force 
with 93.34% accuracy. Ekka et al. (2015) developed an ANN model to predict the wear rate 
of AA 7075 reinforced with different wt. % of SiC, Al2
O3, and cenosphere at different loads, 
sliding speed, and sliding distance. In another study by Ekka et al. (2015), an ANN and 
regression model were used to study the dry sliding wear behavior of AA 7075 reinforced 
with nano particles of Al2
O3
 and SiC. The study showed that ANN predicted results with 
more efficiency compared to regression models. Radhika et al. (2015) used GA with ANN Soft Computing Techniques and Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites 371
for the optimization of process parameters for minimum wear rate of hybrid aluminum 
composite reinforced with Al2
O3
 and graphite. 
Chandrasekaran and Devarasiddappa (2014) used ANN to predict the surface roughness 
of LM25 aluminum alloy reinforced with SiC using wheel velocity, feed, work piece veloc￾ity, and depth of cut as input parameters. ANN predicted results with 94.20% accuracy. 
Özyürek et al. (2014) studied the wear behavior of A356/SiC composite fabricated by the 
thixomoulding method by using ANN technique. Inputs used for the ANN model were wt. 
% of reinforcement, load, and sliding distance.
For successfully using ANN we need a lot of training sessions and to identify which 
training session gives the best results. Also, the selection of the appropriate training algo￾rithm and number of neurons in the hidden layer affects the results of the ANN. 
29.3.2 Response Surface Methodology (RSM)
RSM is a mathematical technique that helps for designing of the experiments. Basically, RSM 
is an approximation technique that uses the minimum number of experiments for finding 
the correlation between the input and output variables. The input variables are termed as 
factors, while the output variables are termed as responses. Box and Wilson introduced this 
method in 1951 (Srinivasan et al., 2012). Chelladurai and Arthanari (2020) used RSM to 
predict the hardness of LM13 aluminum alloy copper coated reinforced with steel fibers in 
which varying wt. % of reinforcements and varying stirrer speed and pouring temperature 
were used. A Central Composite Design of RSM with three factors and five levels with a 
total of 20 experimental runs was used. The objective function was to maximize the hard￾ness of the composite and a second order polynomial regression equation was developed 
for this purpose. Hardness of the composite was predicted with great accuracy and the error 
was within ± 5%. Srinivasan et al. (2020) studied the wear behavior of hybrid AMC rein￾forced with ZrO2
 and graphite fabricated by squeeze casting at varying values of squeeze 
pressure, molten metal temperature, and die preheating temperature. To study the relation 
of these parameters on the wear behavior in a minimum number of experiments, RSM is 
used. The Central Composite Design of RSM was selected and it generated 27 experimental 
runs for three variables and one response. The predicted values of wear rate by RSM showed 
good relation with the experimental values. 
Mohammed Razzaq et al. (2020) also used an RSM model to predict the wear rate and 
coefficient of friction of AA 6063 reinforced with fly ash at three varying wt. % of reinforce￾ment, three different loads, and three different sliding speeds. Ahmad et al. (2020) used 
RSM to study the effect of different temperatures and holding time on Ultimate tensile 
strength, Elongation-to-failure, and Microhardness of AA 6061 reinforced with 2 wt.  % 
of Al2
O3 reinforcement. The error recorded throughout the analysis was acceptable, as the 
confirmation experiments were within the predicted values. The predicted responses were 
under ± 10% of the experimental values. Nwobi-Okoye and Uzochukwu (2020) used a

reinforced with egg shell. Three variables (stirring speed, stirring time, and reinforcement 
preheat temperature) at three levels for two responses (Hardness and Toughness) with 17 
experimental runs were used to develop regression models.

to predict the wear behavior. A Box-Behnken design of experiments of RSM for three fac￾tors at three levels by conducting 17 experiments has been used. Periyasamy et al. (2019) 
used RSM to study the ultimate tensile strength and microhardness of butt welded AA 
7075-T651 and AA 6061 by varying friction stir welding parameters like tool tilt angle, 
tool offset, and tool pin diameter. A Central Composite Design of RSM with three factors 
and five levels with 20 experimental runs was used to formulate regression models. The 
predicted responses were within ±5% of the experimental values. Gajalakshmi et al. (2019) 
used the central composite design of RSM with gray Relational Analysis to predict the wear, 
coefficient of friction, and frictional force of AA 6026 at varying loads, speeds, and track 
diameters. The predicted results by regression models of RSM have an error in the range of 
3 to 6%. 
Maboud et al. (2018) used RSM to study the effect of different process parameters of 
friction stir processing on mechanical properties of AA 1050. Rotation speed, feed rate, 
number of passes, and tool shape were used as process parameters to predict yield strength, 
ultimate tensile strength, % elongation, and hardness. A Central Composite Design of RSM

load and sliding speed.

cut, and reinforcement % of SiC) at three levels with a total of 16 runs were used for 
developing a regression model. 
RSM gives the ability to the user to choose the number of independent variables and 
helps in attaining the optimum values of each researched variable. RSM has been success￾fully employed for the design of experiments and perform experiments as per this design. 374 Optimization of Industrial Systems
29.3.3 Genetic Algorithm (GA)
GA discovers the best solution from the given problem based on the given conditions. 
Basically, it is a heuristic approach in which the algorithm looks for the optimal solution 
by modifying the population. It starts with generating a random population which has the 
possible solutions and the values of these individuals are selected on the basis of the fitness 
function/value. Then, the selection of the maxima or minima of the objective is decided. 
The selection of the individual is based on whether the given individual is good or bad for 
that particular problem. It works the same as a biological GA by selecting individuals from 
the current population and then making them parents for producing children for the next 
generation. In this way, the next generations moves towards the optimal solution. 
Nwobi-Okoye and Uzochukwu (2020) used ANN and RSM to predict mechanical prop￾erties of AA 6351 aluminum alloy reinforced with egg shell. The objective of using GA was 
to maximize the toughness and minimize the hardness of the composite. Non Dominated 
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which is a multiobjective optimization (MOP), 
was used in this study to obtain better Pareto optimal solutions. Input parameter (stirring 
speed, stirring time, and reinforcement preheat temperature) upper and lower levels were 
used as limits of the NSGA-II algorithm. A population size of 60, crossover of 0.8, and a 
mutation rate of 0.1 were set at a maximum time for iterations at 30 minutes. After 170 
iterations, an algorithm optimized Pareto front was obtained. Butola et al. (2020) fabricated 
an AA 6063 hybrid composite reinforced with waste products such as jute ash, groundnut 
shell, and sugarcane at 3, 6, and 9 wt. %. Testing of surface roughness is done by varying 
machining parameters (speed, feed, depth of cut, and reinforcement %). GA is used for 
optimization of these parameters and gave the optimized results in 102 generations. The 
optimized values of surface roughness for 3, 6, and 9% reinforcement are 0.995, 1.14, and 
1.49 micrometers. 
Sreenivasan et al. (2019) used GA for optimization of parameters of the friction stir 
welding process of AA 7075/SiC composite. A Combined Objective Function was used 
to optimize the parameters (spindle speed, friction pressure, upset pressure, and burn-off 
length) to predict the maximum values of ultimate tensile strength and hardness. A pop￾ulation size of 20, length of 44 chromosome, cross over probability of 0.8, and mutation 
probability of 0.01 were used as GA parameters. The accuracy of GA was validated by a 
correlation between the validated results and optimized results. Nwobi-Okoye et al. (2019) 
optimized the hardness and cost of A356/Cow horn particulate reinforced composite using 
GA with ANN as a fitness function. After 231 iterations, the optimized Pareto front was 
achieved. A maximum value of hardness of 81.04 was obtained at a minimum cost of $2.76 
and a minimum value of hardness of 78.27 was obtained at a minimum cost of $2.16. An 
increase in hardness value after the maximum value will lead to an increase in cost.
Bongale et al. (2018) used GA for optimizing wear rate to yield minimum wear of alu￾minum composite reinforced with nanoparticles of SiC and E-glass fibre. Load, speed, and 
SiC wt. % are used as input chromosomes for GA. An optimized wear rate of 0.3259 × 10–3 
gm/min was obtained at 20.199 N load, 1.03 m/s speed, and 8.997 SiC wt. %. Rajeswari 
and Amirthagadeswaran (2018) fabricated a hybrid composite of AA 7075 reinforced with 
SiC and Al2
O3
 using the stir casting technique. The aim of the work was to optimize sur￾face roughness, maximize material removal rate, minimize cutting force, and minimize tool 
wear. Pareto optimal solutions are used. Arulraj and Palani (2018) used GA for parametric Soft Computing Techniques and Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites 375
optimization to improve the impact strength of a hybrid composite of LM24 alloy rein￾forced with SiC and coconut shell. Reinforcement, pouring temperature, squeeze pressure, 
and mould temperature were used as control parameters to find optimum parameters for 
maximizing average impact strength. A population size of 20, stochastic fitness section, 
0.8 probability of cross-over, and 0.03 probability of mutation were used. The optimized 
value is 4.146 Nm for average impact strength obtained in the 53rd generation. Fountas 
et al. (2018) studied the optimum cutting conditions for turning of AMC reinforced with 
316-L stainless steel flakes. Surface roughness and machining time were optimized using 
the Pareto concept with two prediction models. The aim of the work was to optimize values 
of spindle speed and feed rate to obtain minimum values of surface roughness and machin￾ing time. A population size of 30 for 200 generations with 0.8 probability single point cross 
over and a constraint dependent mutation function was used. 
Mahdavi Jafari et al. (2017) used GA to obtain a maximum hardness for AA 6061/
MWCNTs nanocomposite. GA results predicted 87.5 micro Vickers as the optimum hard￾ness at 284.82 MPa compact pressure, 19.66 h milling time, and 310.5 rpm vial speed at 
0.53 wt. % reinforcement. Sharma et al. (2017) fabricated a hybrid composite of AA 6061 
reinforced with Si3
N4
 and nanoparticles of graphite powder by stir casting technique. Wear 
performance of the hybrid composite was studied by using RSM and GA to optimize the 
wear parameters. A mathematical model of RSM is used for the objective function which is 
utilized for evaluation of chromosomes. A minimum wear rate of 0.827 mg was predicted 
by GA at 12 wt. % of reinforcement, 0.4 m/s sliding speed, 50 N load, and 800 m sliding 
distance.

, AlN, and ZrB2
 in situ composites. An effect of wt. % of composites, temperature, load, 
velocity, and sliding on wear rate was analyzed. The best result for wear rate predicted by 
GA was 0.0016458 mm3
/min at 7.99% composite reinforcement, 293.21 °C, 20.285 N load, 
1.001 m/s velocity, and 216.894 m of sliding distance. 
Radhika et al. (2015) used GA with ANN for optimization of process parameters for 
minimum wear rate of hybrid aluminum composite reinforced with Al2
O3
 and graphite. 
Load, sliding velocity, sliding distance, and Al2
O3 wt. % were used as process parameters. 
The optimized parameters for minimum wear rate were found. Santos et al. (2015) used GA 
multi-objective optimization to find the optimum levels of cutting conditions to minimize 
the cutting force and chip thickness ratio simultaneously while turning AA 1350-O and AA 
7075-T6. Vinoth et al. (2014) used GA in combination with RSM to predict the minimum 
wear rate condition of unreinforced AlSi10Mg alloy and AMC reinforced with SiC. The 
minimum wear rate condition was predicted with 94 % accuracy. 
GA is based on the natural optimization algorithm and looks for the global maxima or 
minima by using the fitness function. GA gives better optimized results compared to the 
traditional optimization techniques. 
29.3.4 Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy logic was first introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in the year 1965 (Zadeh, 1996). It is an 
optimization technique used for the prediction of process parameters of AMCs. Fuzzy logic 
helps us for decision making when we have indeterminate and non-mathematical infor￾mation. Here, the values are interpreted on the basis of some given set of rules and these 376 Optimization of Industrial Systems
rules are applied by using membership function, fuzzy logic operators, and if-then rules. 
The membership function is used to determine the degree of the given inputs to find the 
appropriate fuzzy sets for the input. Fuzzy logic operators help in deciding the multi-cri￾teria decision-making problem by using a set of fuzzy criteria. For formulating the condi￾tional statements of fuzzy logic, we use if-then statements. In general, two types of fuzzy 
logic rules are used: Mamdani type and Sugeno type. Mamdani type is more instinctive and 
easier to understand, as the output of each rule is a fuzzy set in this system. A Sugeno type 
fuzzy system has a more efficient defuzzification process than the Mamdani type as it uses 
the weighted average of the data points. 
Vignesh et al. (2021) fabricated LM25/ZrSiO4 composite by stir casting technique. Fuzzy 
logic and GRA were used for multi-response optimization of cutting force, surface rough￾ness, and tool wear. A Mamdani type fuzzy inference system was used. Grey Relational 
Coefficients (GRC) were generated using a GRA that serves as input to a fuzzy logic con￾troller for generating a Grey fuzzy reasoning grade (GFRG). The highest value of the GFRG 
shows the best characteristics. The optimum conditions were obtained at 200 m/min cut￾ting speed, 0.06 mm/rev feed rate, 0.5 mm depth of cut, and 10% of ZrSiO4. Vukman et al. 
(2020) used fuzzy logic to analyze surface roughness of thin walled AA 7075 alloy in milling 
by varying feed ratio, wall thickness, and machining paths. A Mamdani type fuzzy infer￾ence system was used and for calculation, a MATLAB fuzzy logic tool was used. Surface 
roughness predicted by fuzzy logic showed only 12.3% deviation from experimental results. 
Raju et al. (2019) used fuzzy logic to study the effect of varying load, reinforcement %, 
and sliding distance on wear behavior of AMC reinforced with coconut shell ash. GFRG 
were obtained by using GRC which were obtained by GRA. Devarajaiah and Muthumari 
(2019) used fuzzy logic to predict surface roughness of LM25 reinforced with SiC in an 
end milling operation by varying reinforcement %, spindle speed, feed, and depth of 
cut. Average prediction accuracy was 95.44% when compared with confirmatory results. 
Ambigai and Prabhu (2019) used a fuzzy Sugeno algorithm for optimizing wear rate and 
coefficient of friction of hybrid LM6-Si3
N4
 graphite composite. A fuzzy logic controller 
toolbox of MATLAB was used and an R2
 value of a fuzzy model was 0.9429. Rallabandi and 
Rao (2019) used fuzzy logic with less than 5% error for predicting wear rate and coefficient 
of friction of AMC reinforced with coconut shell ash. The highest GFRG value obtained was 
10 N load, 15% reinforcement, and 2000m sliding distance. 
Ramanan and Shanavas (2017) used a fuzzy technique to optimize machining parameters 
of AA 7075 reinforced with activated charcoal. Material removal rate and surface roughness 
have been optimized. A Mamdani fuzzy system is used here. Prabha and Dhas (2017) used 
fuzzy logic to predict wear characteristics of AA 7075/TiCat varying load, sliding velocity, 
and sliding distance. Crisp numerical values are given as input in the fuzzy logic model. 
Confirmatory tests revealed that error in predicted wear rate by fuzzy logic models was not 
more than 6.5%. Deepandurai and Parameshwaran (2016) used fuzzy logic for optimizing 
friction stir welding parameters by considering multiple responses of friction stir welded 
AA 7075/SiC composite. The highest GFRF was obtained at 1150 rpm tool rotational speed, 
40 mm/min welding speed, 6 kNaxial force, and 20 wt. % of reinforcement and the obtained 
optimal responses are 285.75 MPa ultimate tensile strength and 6.89% elongation.
Krishna et al. (2015) used fuzzy logic for optimizing the influential parameters on 
mechanical properties of AMC. Babu et al. (2015) used fuzzy logic to predict surface rough￾ness while drilling AA 7075/SiC composite in minimum quantity lubrication. Varade et Soft Computing Techniques and Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites 377
al. (2015) used fuzzy logic for finding a combination of sliding velocity, load, and sliding 
distance to obtain minimum wear for three different AMCs. Suresh et al. (2014) used opti￾mization of machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and combined reinforcement 
%) for minimum surface roughness, minimum flank wear, and maximum material removal 
rate by using fuzzy logic for turning of hybrid AMC reinforced with SiC and graphite. 
Fuzzy logic has emerged as a powerful system for the forecasting of AMC process param￾eters as it helps us deal with uncertainty and discrete data. It has been successfully modelled 
for simulating and optimizing the process parameters of AMCs that are complex and diffi￾cult to design by other optimization techniques. 
29.3.5 Particle Swarm Optimization
PSO is inspired from flocking birds and swarm intelligence and is a non-deterministic com￾putational method. This optimization technique was developed in 1995 by Eberhart and 
Kennedy (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995). Deciding the population size and the number of 
iterations for PSO implementation is very necessary. Each element of the population is 
called a particle. In the starting of the PSO, the population is created within the search 
space and each of the particles moves towards the search space for moving towards the best 
position. 
Das et al. (2020) used PSO technique to optimize cutting tool temperature, average 
surface roughness, and tool flank wear during the turning of heat treated AA 7075/SiC 
composite. 500 iterations, 200 population size, and 30 repository size were used in PSO. 
Confirmatory tests revealed errors between experimental and PSO results as 2.12%, 2.76%, 
and 3%. Devarajaiah and Muthumari (2019) used PSO integrated with fuzzy logic for 
obtaining optimum cutting parameters that produce desired surface finish in minimum 
machining time in end milling operations of LM25/SiC composite. Range for speed, feed, 
and depth of cut used in PSO were 2000-4000 rpm, 0.01-0.06 mm/rev, and 0.5-2.5 mm. 
Population size 20 and 20 iterations were used.
Rao et al. (2018) used PSO as an optimization technique to obtain minimum wear loss 
of AA 6061/graphite reinforced composite. Weight loss is the objective function and vari￾ables are reinforcement %, load, sliding velocity, and sliding distance. A population size 
of 50, number of generations at 30, and inertia weight 0.99 were used. A minimum wear 
loss of 0.0117 was observed at 8.9995 % reinforcement, 10.0024 N load, 500.0024 sliding 
distance, and 1.0024 sliding velocity. Lmalghan et al. (2018) used an RSM based PSO tech￾nique to optimize influencing parameters in face milling of AA 6061 on responses like 
cutting force, surface roughness, and power consumption. The deviations between results 
predicted by PSO and experimental are within an acceptable range of ±5%. Prakash et al. 
(2018) used PSO technique for optimization of surface roughness and material removal rate 
in machining of A305/SiC composite by using an MWCNT mixed-EDM process. Shabani 
et al. (2018) used PSO combined with ANFIS to optimize parameters for minimum wear 
loss of A360 reinforced with TiC nanoparticles. 
Malghan et al. (2017) used the PSO technique to optimize milling parameters (spindle 
speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) of AA 6061/SiC composite to obtain desired responses of 
cutting force, surface roughness, and power consumption. Shabani et al. (2015) used inte￾grated ANFIS-PSO technique to predict the performance of AMC reinforced with Al2
O3
with 300 iterations and a population size of 100. Eskandari et al. (2013) used PSO to predict 378 Optimization of Industrial Systems
flow stress of AA 6061 during a tensile test. Shabani and Mazahery (2013) predicted the 
optimum process conditions for fabrication of AMC reinforced with B4
C. PSO gives better 
and faster results compared to the other optimization techniques. PSO can be used with 
other optimization techniques for getting the improved and best results. 
29.3.6 Taguchi Method
The Taguchi Method is the design of experiment technique that helps us to identify the 
minimal number of experiments that needs to be performed for finding and observing 
the tribological and mechanical behavior of the AMCs (Singh et al. 2018). For using the 
Taguchi method, first of all, the number of factors to be considered (called as control fac￾tors) are decided and then the variation of each control factor (called as levels) is decided. 
Creating of the orthogonal array depends on these factors and levels and the experiments 
are then conducted on the basis of these arrays. 
Juliyana and Prakash (2020) used the Taguchi Technique to find the best machining 
parameters in drilling of LM5/ZrO2 composite. Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array was used for 
designing of experiments for minimizing thrust force for input parameters (feed, speed, 
reinforcement %). A Signal-to-Noise ratio is used for process reliability and for variance 
evaluation. For thrust force, a lower-the-better category is used. Sathishand Karthick (2020) 
studied the wear behavior of AA 7050/SiC composite and used the Taguchi Technique to 
design experiments for optimization of the process parameters (sliding velocity, sliding dis￾tance, and reinforcement %). Taguchi’s L9
 orthogonal array and a Signal-to-Noise ratio was 
used.
Agrawal and Tungikar studied the tribological properties of AA 7075/TiC composite. 
Three parameters (load, sliding distance, and reinforcement wt. %) were used for preparing 
the design of experiments by the Taguchi Technique. A Taguchi L16 orthogonal array was 
prepared by MINITAB software and a Signal-to-Noise ratio was used. Prakash et al. (2020) 
used Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array to design experiments for the study of wear parameters 
of LM6 reinforced with fly ash. A Signal-to-Noise ratio and ANOVA were used to investi￾gate the effect of wear parameters on specific wear rate. Natrayanet al. (2020) used a Taguchi 
L16 orthogonal array to identify best parameters for high hardness, ultimate tensile strength, 
and yield strength for AA6061/Al2
O3
/SiC hybrid composite fabricated by squeeze casting 
technique. ANOVA was also for finding the contribution of each parameter (squeeze pres￾sure, pressure holding time, die material, and melt temperature) on the properties.
Rallabandi and Rao (2019) used Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array design for three factors, 
load, % of reinforcement, and sliding distance, for predicting wear rate and coefficient of 
friction of AMC reinforced with coconut shell ash. Murthy et al. (2019) used Taguchi’s 
orthogonal array to reduce the number of experiments to study the effect of process 
parameters on tensile strength in friction stir processing. Venkatesan and Xavior (2019) 
used Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array for evaluating the hardness, tensile strength, and yield 
strength of AA 7050/graphene composite fabricated by stir casting and squeeze casting 
techniques. ANOVA was also used to evaluate the influence level of parameters (graphene 
content, melting temperature, and stirring speed) on mechanical properties. Hanizam et 
al. (2019) used the Taguchi Design of Experiments Method to optimize three variables 
(amount of reinforcement, amount of wettability agent, and mechanical stirring duration) 
and study the hardness and ultimate tensile strength of A356/MWCNT composite. Soft Computing Techniques and Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites 379
Bongale et al. (2018) used the Taguchi Design of Experiments Method to conduct a wear 
test and analyze the combination of optimum parameters for lower wear rate of a hybrid 
composite of aluminum reinforced with nanoparticles of SiC and E-glass fibre. A three 
level and three factor experiment was designed. Taguchi’s L27 design was used. Arulraj and 
Palani (2018) used the Taguchi Method for parametric optimization to improve the impact 
strength of a hybrid composite of LM24 alloy reinforced with SiC and coconut shell. An L9
orthogonal array was used. Impact strength predicted by Taguchi Method was similar to the 
experimental value. Lingamurthy et al. (2018) used Taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array to dimin￾ish the experimental runs required for achieving the best surface finish of AA 7075/Al2
O3
composite by varying reinforcement wt. %, speed, and feed. Venkatesh et al. (2018) used an 
L9 orthogonal array to test the surface roughness for achieving a better quality surface finish 
of AA 7075 reinforced with Al2
O3
 and B4
C. 
Veličković et al. (2017)( used Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array for experimental plan￾ning of an A356/SiC/graphite hybrid composite. The specific wear rate was studied by 
using graphite wt. %, load, and sliding speed as control factors. ANOVA was also used to 
study the impact of every parameter on the result. Kumar et al. (2016) studied the wear 
behavior of AA 2618 alloy reinforced with Si3
N4
, AlN, and ZrB2
 in situ composites. The 
influence of wear parameters on wear behavior was analyzed using the Taguchi method. 
An L25 orthogonal array was used. A minimum value of wear rate 0.000523 mm3
/min was 
observed at 8 wt. % reinforcement, 200°C, 10 N load, 5 m/s velocity, and 2000 m sliding 
distance. 
Babu et al. (2015) used Taguchi L27 experimental design for performing experiments of 
surface roughness while drilling AA 7075/SiC composite in minimum quantity lubrica￾tion. Karabulut (2015) used Taguchi’s L18 orthogonal array and an ANOVA test to perform 
the milling tests for optimizing the surface roughness and cutting force of AA 7039/Al2
O3 
composite. Baskaran et al. (2014) used Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array technique to design 
experiments for studying the effect of varying reinforcement %, load, sliding velocity, and 
sliding distance on the wear rate of AA 7075/TiC composite. Baradeswaran et al. (2013) 
used the Taguchi Technique for Design of Experiments for optimizing the wear parameters 
of AA 7075/Al2
O3 composite. 
The Taguchi method has served as one of the most reliable methods for design of exper￾iments. Using ANOVA along with the Taguchi method helps us to identify the influence of 
each factor on the tribological and mechanical properties. Also, a Signal-to-Noise ratio is 
used for finding the deviation from the target values. This method is highly effective when 
our aim is to identify the influence of each of the parameters on the mechanical and tribo￾logical behavior of AMCs. 
29.3.7 Grey Relational Analysis (GRA)
GRA is a multi-objective optimization technique used when we have multiple inputs with 
discrete and uncertain data. The very first step in GRA is to normalize the values of the 
given data between 0 and 1. The next step is to find the deviation of the given sequence from 
the normalized values. The Grey relation coefficient (GRC) is found using these normalized 
values and a deviation sequence. GRC is then used to find the Grey Relational Grade (GRG) 
which is the weighted average of these GRCs. In the last step, we give ranking to these 
parameters based on the GRG values. 380 Optimization of Industrial Systems
Vignesh et al. (2021) fabricated LM25/ZrSiO4 composite by stir casting technique. GRA 
and fuzzy logic were used for multi-response optimization of cutting force, surface rough￾ness, and tool wear. The experimental data for three responses at varying cutting conditions, 
cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cut, and reinforcement % were normalized between 0 
and 1 in GRA and then Grey relational coefficients (GRC) were generated that were used 
for the fuzzy logic controller. 
Reddy et al. (2020) used GRA to optimize drilling parameters of AA 6063/TiC compos￾ite. Effect of helix angle, spindle speed, and feed rate on surface roughness, cutting force, 
and drilling temperature were studied. GRC were averaged to obtain a Grey relation grade 
(GRG). The optimal values were found for the highest GRG. Prakash et al. (2020) did mul￾tiresponse optimization of drilling parameters of hybrid LM6 reinforced with fly ash and 
B4
C. Asmare et al. (2020) used Taguchi based GRA for optimal process parameters of fric￾tion stir welded AA 6061-T6 alloy. Kumar et al. (2020) used GRA for optimal machining 
parameters of AA 7075/ZrO2
/graphite composite. Effect of spindle speed, feed rate, depth 
of cut, and wt. % of graphite on cutting force, surface roughness, and material removal 
rate were studied. Christy et al. (2020) used Taguchi based GRA for optimizing stir and 
casting process parameters (squeeze pressure, squeeze time, die preheating temperature, 
and stirrer speed). Arunachalam et al. (2020) used Taguchi based GRA combined with an 
Analytical Hierarchy process (AHP) for optimizing the stir-squeeze casting process param￾eters of AMC reinforced with Al2
O3
. Effect of squeeze pressure, squeeze time, temperature, 
and stirrer speed on porosity, hardness, ultimate tensile strength, and ultimate compressive 
strength were studied. 
Raju et al. (2019) used GRA to generate GRC for a fuzzy logic controller to study the 
wear behavior of AMC reinforced with coconut shell ash at varying loads, reinforcement %, 
and sliding distances. Rallabandi and Rao (2019) also used GRA to generate GRC for GFRG 
for predicting wear rate and coefficient of friction of AMC reinforced with coconut shell 
ash. Hariharasakthisudhan et al. (2019) used GRA to study the effect of input parameters 
(Si3
N4
, load ,and sliding speed) on wear rate and coefficient of friction of AA 6061/Al2
O3
/
Si3
N4
 hybrid composite. Stalin et al. (2019) used Taguchi based GRA for optimizing wear 
parameters of AA 6063/Si3
N4 composite. A minimum wear rate of 0.0002 mm3
/min was 
obtained for 10 wt. % reinforcement, 29.43 N load, 3 m/s sliding velocity, and 1500 mm 
sliding distance by GRA. 
Kaushik and Singhal (2018) fabricated AA 6063/SiC composite by a liquid metallurgy 
stir casting process and analyzed the wear properties using a Taguchi based GRA approach. 
Effect of load, sliding distance, and reinforcement wt. % on wear and frictional force is 
analyzed. In another study by Kaushik and Singhal (2018), a Taguchi based GRA approach 
integrated with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for analyzing the wear 
behavior of AA 6063/SiC composite. The effect of load, sliding distance, and wt. % of SiC 
on wear rate and frictional force was analyzed. Prakash et al. (2018) used a Taguchi based 
GRA approach for optimizing the wear parameters of A413/B4
C composite. ANOVA was 
also used to find the contribution of each parameter (sliding speed, sliding distance, load, 
and reinforcement %) on wear behavior.
Ramanan and Shanavas (2017) used GRA and fuzzy logic to improve material removal 
rate and surface roughness of AA 7075 reinforced with activated charcoal. GRA predicted 
that minimum wear in the composite is examined at 20 N load, 7 wt. % SiC, and 1046 m slid￾ing distance. Vedrtnam and Kumar (2017) used a Taguchi based GRA approach for finding Soft Computing Techniques and Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites 381
the optimal combination of parameters (reinforcement %, load, sliding speed, and sliding 
distance) for the minimum wear rate of AMC. Deepandurai and Parameshwaran (2016) 
normalized ultimate tensile strength and % elongation of friction stir welded AA 7075/SiC 
composite by employing characteristics, such as higher the better for tensile strength and 
lower the better for % elongation. Normalized responses are used for GRC. 
Mishra et al. (2015) used a Taguchi based GRA approach for optimizing the process 
parameters during turning of AA 7075/SiC composite in dry conditions and spray cooling 
conditions. Raykar et al. (2015) used GRA for optimization of surface roughness, power 
consumption, material removal rate, and cutting time for high speed turning of AA 7075. 
Kumaran and Uthayakumar (2015) used GRA for identifying optimum cutting parameters 
with minimum surface roughness, power consumption, and maximum material removal 
rate in high speed machining of AA 6351/SiC/B4C composite.
Baskaran et al. (2014) used a Taguchi based GRA approach to study the dry sliding wear 
behavior of AA 7075/TiC annealed composite. ANOVA was also used to identify the signif￾icance of each parameter on wear behavior. Jayaraman (2014) used Taguchi based GRA for 
optimizing the machining parameters in turning of AA 6063 T6 aluminum alloy. GRG was 
used for identifying the optimum level of parameters and ANOVA was used to find the con￾tribution of each parameter. Thirumalai Kumaran et al. (2014) studied the effects of applied 
load, sliding velocity, and reinforcement wt. % on the wear rate and frictional coefficient of 
AA 6351/SiC/B4
C hybrid composite by using a Taguchi based GRA approach. 
GRA helps in mathematical describing and comparison of the various parameters of the 
system. GRA can be combined with other optimization methods for getting better opti￾mized results. GRA gives satisfied results for small data.
29.3.8 Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)
ANFIS is a hybrid system that uses both a neural network and fuzzy logic for finding the 
relation between the input and output parameters. ANFIS has five layers as shown in Figure 
29.3. The first layer helps in getting the crisp numeric values. In second layer each node 
calculates the product of its inputs. In third layer normalization of each node is done. In the 
fourth layer if-then rules are used for calculating the weighted output of each node. In the 
fifth layer every node is fixed and represents a model output. The basic aim of ANFIS is to 
calculate the objective function that can either maximize or minimize the function.
Nwobi-Okoye et al. (2019) used ANN and ANFIS as multiobjective optimization for 
A356/cow horn particulate reinforced composite age hardening process parameters. Cow 
horn reinforcement %, time, and temperature were the inputs for ANFIS and hardness 
values or costs were outputs. A Gaussian function was used as a membership function for 
input variables. Hardness values were better predicted by ANFIS with a correlation coeffi￾cient value of 0.9985 and 0.9926 for ANN. Fine experimental data is required in ANFIS and 
this makes it more expensive for modelling and multi-objective optimization. Seputra and

Soegijono (2019) used ANFIS for optimizing and predicting the tensile strength of AMC 
reinforced with organoclay. In another study by Seputra and Soegijono (2019), ANFIS was 
used to predict the mechanical properties of AMC reinforced with organoclay at different 
wt. %. 
Shabani et al. (2018) used ANFIS combined with PSO to optimize parameters for mini￾mum wear loss of A360 reinforced with TiC nanoparticles. Karim et al. (2018) used ANFIS 
to predict the surface roughness of AMC reinforced with SiC. For input parameters, a 
Gaussian member function with 3 membership functions was used and for output param￾eters, a linear membership function was used. Shamsipour et al. (2016) used ANFIS cou￾pled with PSO to find the optimal combination of input parameters (mold temperature, 
mix time, impeller speed, powder temperature, cast temperature, and average particle size) 
to minimize wear of AMC reinforced with TiC. Shabani et al. (2015) used an integrated 
ANFIS-PSO technique to predict the performance of AMC reinforced with Al2
O3
. ANFIS 
has adapting and rapid learning capabilities and stronger computational power for complex 
problems and helps in extracting of numerical models from the numeric data.
29.4 Conclusions
In this chapter different soft computing techniques used to study the mechanical and wear 
behavior of aluminum metal matrix composites were discussed in detail. Different studies 
performed by various author groups with respect to the use of reinforcements, different 
loading conditions, sliding speed, sliding distance, etc. were articulated. It was observed 
that each and every technique predicted the optimum parameters within the acceptable 
limits, despite the fact that they work on different algorithms. Further, it was also observed 
that some of the techniques such as RSM and the Taguchi method have been widely used 
by researchers. From the different studies carried out in this direction it can be concluded 
that these techniques have helped a lot in predicting the different parameters, thereby min￾imizing the time and cost involved in additional experimentation.

Sustainable Manufacturing Related Aspects 
in Turning: A Study on Tool Wear

Abstract
In the manufacturing sector, metal cutting is the most promising technique to obtain a good sur￾face finish with the desired accuracy in the final work part. Various strategies are currently being 
employed to improve surface finish such as the use of cutting fluids, coated tools, surface texturing 
over the rake face, etc. Amongst the existing methodology, the use of cutting fluid during metal 
machining finds a most promising method to improve surface integrity and reduce the overall cost of 
machining. Recently, researchers are more inclined to study the effect of nanoparticles on machining 
performance with the use of vegetable oil to achieve sustainability in machining. The use of conven￾tional cutting fluids such as petroleum-based cutting fluids poses a serious threat to the health of the 
workers and also affects the ecology of the system. Considerable research is being done to improve 
this situation, such as the use of vegetable oil instead of petroleum-based cutting fluids. In this paper, 
the effect of boric acid powder suspended with RSBO (Refined Soya Bean Oil) and Synthetic HP 
KOOLKUT 40 (HPKK40) as cutting fluids on tool flank wear and the surface finish have been inves￾tigated in the machining of aluminum alloy 7075 T651. The result shows the refined soybean oil 
(RSBO) along with boric acid improves machining performance.
Keywords: Vegetable oil, nanoparticles, synthetic oil, tool wear
30.1 Introduction
Nowadays, metalworking fluids (MWFs) are being extensively used in metal cutting indus￾tries to improve machining performance (Moksin and Vekteris, 2011). There are numerous 
metalworking fluids (MWFs) available in the market such as emulsion, vegetable oil, soluble 
oil, synthetic fluid, etc., and they are being extensively used to improve overall machining 
performance. Mostly metalworking fluids (MWFs) are mineral oil-based liquids employed 
in metal cutting industries to increase efficiency in manufacturing processes by lubricating 
metal working zones. Due to their benefits, the intake of metalworking fluids is growing 
in the metal cutting industry. It is reported that most metal cutting industries consumed a 
tonnage of cutting fluids per year (Bennett, 1983). They cause serious health problems and

environmental challenges over their lifecycle, despite their large use. The use of petroleum￾based cutting fluid poses a serious threat to workers and around 80% of the workers suffer 
skin-related disease (Bennett and Bennett, 1985). Infectious toxins are secreted by bacteria 
and fungi, primarily in water-soluble oil. Various alternate approaches to petroleum-based 
metalworking fluids (MWFs) are currently being explored by scientists and tribologists to 
solve these problems. These alternatives consist of solid lubricants, synthetic lubricants, and 
vegetable-based lubricants. The increasing demand for biodegradable materials has paved the 
way for the use of vegetable-based oils as a substitute for petroleum-based cutting fluids in 
metal machining processes (Gajrani and Sankar, 2017). Lubricants are used in many varied 
ranges. Consequently, their ecological appropriateness has become progressively important. 
As an outcome, research on the use of biodegradable cutting fluid increases, which has led to 
a rising number of environmentally friendly liquids and lubricants in the market. Vegetable￾based lubricants, in particular rapeseed and soya bean oil, are the most promising candidates 
to improve the efficiency of machining. These are conveniently decomposable and cheaper 
relative to other available candidates in the market. Cutting liquids are generally classified into 
three main groups namely cutting oils, water-soluble liquids, and gases. In general, vegetable 
oils are highly potent replacements for petroleum oils since they are environmentally friendly, 
sustainable, less toxic, and easily decomposable. Subsequently, vegetable-based oils are more 
probable applicants for use in manufacturing as lubricants and metalworking fluids (MWFs). 
Numerous studies are reported in the development of advances of new bio-based cutting flu￾ids from many vegetable oils. As for environmental worries and rising rules over pollution, the 
growth in need for renewable and decomposable oils is highly anticipated (Lawal et al., 2012). 
In this work, vegetable-based oil is used along with suspended boric acid to see its effect 
on flank wear and surface finish in the machining of Al7075. Also, the results of REFINED 
SOYABEAN OIL (RSBO) and HP KOOLKUT 40 (HPKK 40) were compared and the opti￾mal one is concluded based on tool wear, surface finish, and operator-friendliness, as well 
as nature friendliness.
30.2 Literature Survey
Alagarsamy et al. (2016) investigated the machining parameters in turning of Aluminum 7075 
by employing optimization techniques such as the Taguchi method and ANOVA to optimize 
the machining parameters. Three machining parameters and their three levels were selected 
to conduct the study. Material removal rate (MRR) and the machining time (Tm) were taken 
into consideration for the study. The author reported that to have a high production rate, the 
optimized cutting parameters found are a cutting speed of 1500 m/min, feed rate of 0.20m/
rev, and depth of cut as 0.8 mm. Mahadi et al. (2017) investigated the effect of boric acid sus￾pended in vegetable oil (palm oil) on the surface finish in the machining of AISI 431 steel. The 
author reported that lubricant type and feed rate are the only factors that have a significant 
impact on surface finish and the use of boric acid outperformed the result. Amini, Saeid, and 
Reza Teimouri (2017) investigated the machining performance of rotary turning assisted by 
longitudinal ultrasonic vibration on surface roughness in machining of AA7075. The study 
revealed that vibration induced during the process significantly reduced surface finish (Ra) 
as well as cutting forces (Fz). Talib et al. (2017) investigated the effect of boron nitride sus￾pended in Jatropha oil on tribological behavior. The results showed the modified Jathropha oil Sustainable Manufacturing Related Aspects in Turning 393
with nanoparticles provided the best physiochemical properties due to the low value of ther￾mal expansion of nanoparticles. Benkai et al. (2017) investigated the performance of various 
nanoparticles like MoS2
, ZrO2
, CNT, PCD, Al2
O3
, and SiO2
 suspended in palm oil, which were 
used as base oils and their respective heat transfer performances were studied. It revealed that 
CNT Nanofluid has the highest heat transfer coefficient (1.3×104W/(m×K)). Overall, it was 
found that CNT has the best heat transfer performance amongst the studied nanoparticles. 
Bakalova et al. (2016) investigated the effect of TiO2
, SiO2
 and Ag nanoparticles on machining 
performance. TiO2
, SiO2
, and Ag nanoparticles were used in the tribological study with silver 
nitrate (AgNO3
) and ascorbic acid (C6
H8
O6
) as a base fluid. The result revealed that the use of 
nanoparticles decreased the average and variance of friction coefficient by 8.9% and 20.4%, 
respectively. Also, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity was studied and was found that it 
reduced bacterial respiratory rate up to 90.4%. Coupland and McClements (1997) compiled 
the various physical properties of Liquid Edible Oils such as thermal conductivity, specific heat, 
viscosity, density, ultrasonic velocity, etc. and the coefficient for a range of food oils and water at 
20°C and a series of empirical equations are suggested to calculate the temperature dependency 
of these parameters. Lawal (2013) discussed the advantages of vegetable oil over commercially 
used cutting fluids. There was a performance enhancement in cutting force reduction, surface
finish of workpiece, tool wear, and heat transfer rate at the cutting zone. Coconut oil and
sunflower oil were used as cutting fluids for the machining of AISI 304 austenitic Stainless
Steel. The thrust force was reduced with the reduction in tool wear.
Rasheed et al. (2016) reviewed recent developments on graphene-based nanofluids and 
nanolubricants. They concluded that graphene can enhance the thermal conductivity, vis￾cosity, electrical conductivity, and tribological properties of grease and base oils. Kumar 
and Chauhan (2015) investigated the surface finish in turning of AL7075 alloy by using 
Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networking (ANN) and using 
graphite as a coolant which resulted in a better surface finish of the material. Sharma et al. 
(2015) investigated the effect of Titanium oxide (TiO2
) nanoparticles in the base fluid under 
minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). It was found that up to 58.1% of tool wear was 
reduced by using MQL and the cutting forces were reduced up to 62.67%. Also, the surface 
finishes improved by 47.8%. H. Xie et al. (2015) used MoS2
 and SiO2
 nanoparticles with 
EOT5# engine oil in different proportions and found that lubrication was increased by a 
considerable amount. The load-carrying capacity of the base lubricant was improved by 
adding these particles and SiO2
 reduced the friction coefficient.
30.3 Experimental Procedure
30.3.1 Material Selection and Machine Specification
Aluminium 7075 has been selected to investigate tool wear and surface finish in the presence of 
vegetable oil and with dry machining under the selected cutting parameters. Aluminum 7075 
finds a wide range of applications in the aerospace, automotive, and aviation industries due to 
its high specific strength, tensile strength, and maximum yield strength. Various studies on 
machining performance is shown in Table 30.1 and Table 30.2 shows the composition of alumi￾num 7075. The experiments were conducted on a Weiler Lathe Machine, Spitzendrehmaschine

30.3.4 Experimental Procedure
The surface roughness of the workpiece was measured at the very first cut in a fresh insert to 
obtain the exact value of Ra. Then, machining was carried out for five minutes and the insert 
was inspected for wear in the VMM MICRO-VU machine as shown in Figure 30.5. After 
the inspection, four more readings were taken at an interval of 5 minutes each. So, a total 
of 25 minutes of machining was carried out for one insert in a single lubricating system.

This procedure was carried out for every new lubricant and the values are compared. Also, 
the new inserts were measured for the dimensions and nose radius. Mist lubrication has 
been provided for various samples prepared.
30.4 Result and Discussion
This procedure was carried out for every new lubricant and the values are compared. Also, the 
new inserts were measured for the dimensions and nose radius. The tool wear is measured in 
the reduction of the nose radius of the insert, as shown in Figure 30.6. The red colored line in 
Figure 30.6 was measured in tool wear measurement. The effective length of the work piece 
which can be machined was 335mm and the feed rate was set on automatic at 0.2 mm/rev. The 
speed was kept constant at 1000 rpm, so the time taken to cut one time fully was measured as:
Table 30.3 shows the tool wear measurement for various samples. The tool wear has been 
measured every 5 min. The tool wear results have been compared in all the cases to infer the 
effect of different lubricating conditions on tool wear. Figure 30.7 shows the comparative 
analysis of tool wear under selected lubricating conditions.

30.5 Conclusion
The best lubricant which was highly user friendly was the emulsions and REFINED 
SOYABEAN OIL (RSBO) oil. Neat synthetic oil has a low smoke point compared to 
REFINED SOYABEAN OIL (RSBO), which heats up fast and produces a lot of smoke which 
irritated the operator. This is due to fatty acid chains in the oil’s structure. The least tool wear 
was shown in REFINED SOYABEAN OIL (RSBO) oils and the Boric Acid powder showed 
a significant decrease in tool wear. So, the best lubricating oil amongst the tested is Refined 
Soyabean Oil + 1% Boric Acid Powder. The best surface finish is obtained in emulsion 
90+10 and 90+10+1%, as shown in Figure 30.8.

Effect of Different Process Parameters and 
Manufacturing Design of Heat Sink: A Review
Anil Kumar Rao* and Shamsul Haq
Department of Mechanical Engineering, Madhyanchal Professional University, Bhopal, India
Abstract
Since the last decade, researchers have mainly focused on developing a heat transfer device which 
has high specific heat transfer. In order to do that, heat sinks were made which have high specific 
heat transfer compared to other heat transfer devices. It is a type of heat exchanger which is used to 
extract heat from electronic devices. Heat sinks are very cost effective, reliable, and very easy to han￾dle. For increasing the heat transfer rate, different shapes and arrangements of extended surface, that 
is fins, were placed on the heat sink. In order to understand the nature of heat transfer through heat 
sinks and to understand the different process parameters, a review of heat sinks is necessary. Here, in 
this work, a complete review of heat sinks is done.
Keywords: Heat sink, review, parameters, heat transfer, design optimization
31.1 Introduction
The functionality of digital devices enhances the amount of heat generation, which influ￾ences performance adversely. Every  electrical and electronic component  in a circuit 
generates some amount of heat as the circuit is accomplished by giving a power source. 
For this reason, heating up of the equipment prospects to early inability and may possibly 
trigger collapse of the whole circuit or system’s efficiency. Therefore, to overcome these 
unfavorable factors, heat sinks need to be presented for cooling intention [1]. The prerequi￾site for removal of high heat flux with small area has engrossed many researchers to focus 
on Micro-Channel Heat Sinks (MCHS) [2]. Currently, the MCHS is used for high heat flux 
applications like electronic cooling because of its lightweight, compactness, and high heat 
transfer rate when compared to other microelectronic cooling systems. A heat sink  is a 
passive heat exchanger that carries the heat produced by an automated or a power-driven 
maneuver to a fluid medium over air or a fluid lubricant, where it is dissipated away from 
the system, permitting instruction of the apparatus hotness at maximum intensities. A heat 
sink is intended to make the best use of the external parts in interaction with the refrig￾erating standard nearby it, such as a different fluid [2, 3]. Thermal epoxy resin or thermal 
*Corresponding author: anil.somit@gmail.com404 Optimization of Industrial Systems
blubber  recovers the heat span presentation by satisfying air breaches amongst the heat 
sink with the heat communicator on the expedient. A heat sink is frequently made out of 
Cu or Al. Metallic copper is utilized since it has numerous needed belongings for thermally 
effective as well as strong heat exchangers [4, 5].
A heat sink exchanges thermal power from a more significantly temperatures device to a 
lower temperature medium, which is mainly fluid. The fluid is often air, however it can cer￾tainly be water, oil, or refrigerant [6]. Whenever the fluid medium is water, the heat sink is 
typically known as a cold plate. In thermodynamics a heat sink is definitely a heat reservoir 
which usually absorbs an irrelevant amount of heat with no considerable change in tem￾perature [7]. Experimental heat sinks for a microelectronic apparatus always have a tem￾perature greater than the atmosphere to allocate heat by one of three modes of heat transfer: 
convection, radiation, or conduction. The power deliveries of microelectronics were not 
cent percent competent, so further heat is fashioned that might be disadvantageous to the 
purpose of the expedient. As further, a heat sink is comprised in the proposal to dissolve 
heat. The rise in heat sink thermal confrontation with reduction in rate of flow would be 
exposed well ahead in such an object. The input fluid temperature transmits sturdily to the 
heat sink’s original temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, 
the inlet air temperature is not the ambient air temperature. The input air temperature of 
the heat descend is consequently greater, which likewise effects a difficult heat sink origin 
temperature.
31.2 Heat Sink Construction
Heat sinks are generally constructed from an alloy of copper or aluminum [9]. The metal 
copper has a quite high thermal conductivity which in turn means the rate of heat transfer 
is likewise very high through copper heat sinks [10]. While lower as opposed to copper, 
thermal conductivity of aluminum is also high and weight is a major concern, but it has 
integrated benefits of lesser expense and lesser density, which makes it valuable for applica￾tions. A Plate Fin Heat Sink removes heat through convection. It utilizes symmetrical fins 
that operate the whole length to improve the surface area among the heat sinks. The huge 
fins generate heat spreading to ensure that more energy can easily be removed with the 
same temperature difference. A cross cut heat sink is a variance of the straight fin heat sink 
wherever a straight fin heat sink is chopped at regular time periods [11, 12]. A straightfor￾ward plate fin heat sink offers seven impartial geometric variables which can be assorted 
in any design: fin width, fin length, fin spacing, fin height, base length, base thickness, and 
width of the base plate [13, 14]. Nonuniform design of heat sink is shown in Figure 31.1.
31.3 Thermal Resistance
Thermal confrontation is explained as an augmentation in heat with energy corresponding 
to conductance, as expressed in components of points Celsius with watt [15]. If the expedi￾ent intemperance in watts is recognized and the entire thermal resistance is intended, the 
rise in temperature of the die above the ambient air could be intended. The awareness of 
thermal confrontation of a semiconductor heat descend is a calculation. It does not yield a Different Process Parameters and Manufacturing Design of Heat Sink 405
description on varying delivery of warmth above a scheme or heat descend [16]. It merely 
facsimiles an arrangement in thermal symmetry which does not take into justification the 
alteration in infections with stint, nor does it reproduce the zig zag of energy and convec￾tion relative to upsurge in temperature. Industrialists arrange characteristic standards of 
thermal confrontation for heat descends and semiconductor procedures, which sanctions 
the choice of commercially industrial heat sinks to be shortened. 
31.4 Materials
The utmost nominal heat sink provisions are aluminum alloys. Aluminium alloy 1050 has the 
greatest heat conduction shown at 228 W/m K, but it is instinctively spineless. Aluminium 
blends 6060 (little stress),  6061,  and  6063  are normally utilized, by heat conduction 
standards of 167 with 202 W/m K. The values depend on the temper of the alloy. Copper has 
exceptional heat descend stuffs in relations to heat conduction, confrontation to corrosion, 
biofouling confrontation, as well as antimicrobial confrontation. Copper consumes two 
times the aluminum thermal conduction with 405 W/m K for pure copper. Its leading clas￾sifications were in business services, thermal plants, solar, marine structures, heating ven￾tilation field, fume water fires, enforced air warming with chilling fields, geothermal fields 
with chilling, and with microelectronic schemes. Copper is thrice as dense as other mate￾rials as well as more affluent than aluminum. Copper heat descends were machined as well 
as shirked. An additional technique of production is to weld the limbs into the bottom of 
heat sink. Aluminium heat descends could be removed, but the copper which shows lower 
ductility cannot be removed.

31.5 Previous Research Work 
Karami et al. (2019) [17] developed a micro pin fin heat sink as shown in Figure 31.2 using 
a baffle untainted water runs over and analyzed it in three dimension using ANSYS Fluent 
in the laminar limit of 52≤Re≤252. At this point, we have altered the baffle’s nature as well 
as extents for inspecting the influence of perplex on the transfer of heat. The outcomes are 
associated through a micro pin fin thermal descend devoid of baffle. The consequences 
display the utilization of baffle in bit limbs in such dimensionless numbers, like Reynolds 
number, which upsurges the rate of heat transfer. Though, by raising the Reynolds number, 
a drop in pressure occurs. A heat sink with 22% overlay and a dual patterned perplex has 
the maximum degree of heat transfer. Yoon et al. (2018) [18] have tested and analysed radi￾ative heat efficiency depending on the position of the partial hot area. Numerical modelling 
simulations for forced convection were used to analyse the heat transfer between the heat 
sink and the surrounding air. The best location of partial heat, which is discussed in terms 
of the impact of the total rate of heat transfer and air velocity, is the ratio of total length of 
the heat sink with a warm thickness section of the heat descend and the heat conduction of 
the heat descend with the breadth carries the bottom part of the descend of heat. Based on 
this analysis, it is suggested that a relation would be developed by experiments to determine 
the best location for the heat. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the heat resistance of heat 
by 30% by finding the best position of the partial heating. Chiu et al. (2017) [19] mathemat￾ically, as well as practically, examined the liquefied refrigerating proficiency of heat sinks 
comprising of micro pin fins. Aluminium models of heat sinks through micro pin fins are 
contrived to discover the stream with thermal enactment. The leading mathematical con￾straints involved the radius of a micro pin fin as well as permeability of fin arrangement. 
The properties of the mathematical constraints with descent in pressure on the heat transfer 
enactment of the heat sinks are considered. Ghani et al. 2017) [20] studied the consumption 
of reflexive systems to boost transfer of heat in microchannel heat sink devices acknowl￾edging accumulative consideration due to intensifying claims for enhanced thermal super￾vision in the present automated projects. Though, various trainings focused on the practice 
of unique nature of submissive systems which emphasizes merely on a single feature of its 
presentation, which has procured greater heat transfer speed through advanced drops in 
pressure and making small drops in pressure at truncated proportions of heat transfer.

Huang et al. (2017) [21] studied that dints to a surface of heat transfer could efficiently 
advance the enactment of heat transfer of a microchannel heat sink with impinging jets. 
A microchannel heat sink with impinging jets by dissimilar dint assemblies, containing 
curved, arched, as well as diverse dints, were linked with a microchannel heat sink by 
impacting the path of stream other than dints by mathematical imitation with the submis￾sion of the turf interaction attitude. Prajapati et al. (2017) [22] studied bubble evolution 
manners with heat transfer features throughout subcooled stream blistering in fragmented 
finned micro networks. Recreations have been achieved for a particular row of fins with 
a microchannel, then anticipated fallouts were associated with investigational analysis. 
Commencement of nucleation, development of fizzes, and its evolution with arrangements 
has been examined for dissimilar standards of functional heat flux. Sudhakar et al. (2016) 
[23] used the three-dimensional temporary pattern of the geometric structure of the sub￾strate of the chip to predict the degree of imbalance in temperature and mass temperature 
which diffuses through the base of heat sink from the heat source to the cooler flank. This 
model incorporates heat, which can absorb from any source, temporarily heating easily by 
many asteroids. The level of the same is mapped as a function of geometry and a boundary 
state. Anbumeenakshi et al. (2016) [24] investigated a series of experiments on the com￾mon effects of nano fluids and uneven heat on the cooling effect of micro channel sinks. 
The microscopic radiation that is considered in this study distributes 30 rectangles with a 
0.727-millimetre diameter. In the experimental experiments, three machines of the same 
size were used. Uneven heat is provided by opening two of three heaters at the same time. 
Jeon et al. (2016) [25] completed numerous studies on heat transfer from natural convec￾tors with radial heat sinks applying a perforated ring. An impression of the number of 
slashes (0-7) and a hole diameter (0-4 mm) with holes length (1.6-7 mm) as a maneuvering 
slope (0-170) on thermal effectiveness are calculated. The results revealed that radial heat 
sinks having a perforated ring undergo the best thermal performance compared with heat 
sinks having unperforated rings. In instances of the thermal confrontation, the outward 
heat descends with condensed bulk by 36% consuming a heightened punched loop and 
revealed 18% downfall with that of other punched loops. Soni et al. (2016) [26] examined 
the changes in the heat transfer in the equilibrium state with variations in heat energy and 
the heat efficiency between the rectangular fashioned limb heat descend as well as pin limb 
heat descend to the upright positioning of the bottom part of the slab. After creating and 
confirming the existing analytical results for continuous fins, a systematic study of the effect 
of the elliptical fin is performed. ANSYS and SOLIDWORKS design software were used to 
create three-dimensional digital models to investigate the different fins’ geometric effects. 
The results showed that the changes in the fins geometry to the vertical oriented base plate 
fins increase the thermal efficiency of the fins and reduce the weight of the fins array, result￾ing in lower production costs. Yadav et al. (2016) [27] observed that in the existing math￾ematical analysis, microchannel heat sinks were presently expected as modern era cooling 
elucidation. Heat transfer enrichment in microchannels utilizing a prolonged area have 
been taking into account. Quadrilateral microchannels with tubular micro members were 
cast-off in existing analysis. Various diverse formations of prolonged area microchannels, 
such as stream finned microchannels, distorted stream finned microchannels, as well as 
comprehensive finned microchannels, were likened by a bare quadrilateral microchannel. It 
has been initiated that as heat transfer enactment of the very first one is improved in greater 
nature than the second one. Yang et al. (2016) [27] analyzed the heat transfer presentations 408 Optimization of Industrial Systems
of the microchannel heat sinks through various dissimilar pin member conformations 
mathematically, as well as practically. Three sided, four sided, five sided, six sided, and ring 
figures are preferred as the cross segments of the pin members. Altogether, microchannel 
heat descends are intended as the similar complete proportions. Pin fins are amazed in the 
equivalent manner. A constant heat instability has been functional at the upper area of the 
microchannel passion descend. Herrmann et al. (2016) [28] studied numerical simulations 
of cooling microchannels through the spiral radial flow of fluid. Aspects like tallness and 
interior approach with liquids are speckled to read the properties. The rotational flow of 
fluid induced the fluid to move over the heat exchanging surface. When the microchannel 
height was reduced, it resulted in the merging of boundary layers and the entrainment effect. 
Chai et al. (2016) [29] considered, mathematically, the transfer of heat in microchannel heat 
descend with equipoise spokes on walls allowing for laminar stream. The changed equipoise 
spokes utilized are quadrilateral, regressive trilateral, advancing trilateral, and semi-circular 
with isosceles three-cornered. It has a lesser rate alteration in the y-direction that produced 
healthier mingling of warm water nearby the fortification and the unsympathetic water in 
the microchannel mid. A heat sink with forwarding triangular, semi-circular, and isosceles 
triangular offset ribs had slightly better heat transfer performance than the heat sink with 
rectangular and backward triangular ribs. Anurag et al. (2016) [30] proposed a new analysis 
of different inlet and outlet flow arrangements. The cross sections taken were rectangular, 
rectangular with semicircle, and divergent-convergent. All of these were microchannels 
made up of copper material. The CFD analysis found that the divergent-convergent had 
better heat transfer than the other two cross-sections. Comparing those two, the rectangu￾lar with semicircle had better heat transfer than a rectangular section.
Lee et al. (2015) [31] improved microchannel heat sinks through segmented slanting mem￾bers utilized to curb the movement in disparity to incessant traditional members as shown in 
Figure 31.3. The revaluation of thermal edge deposit at the important brink of each slanting 
plane because of cracking of unremitting members was addicted to slanting segments with 
the inferior stream because these slanting slashes occasioned in improved transfer of heat 
and an equivalent drop in pressure. Widespread investigational calculations were passed out 
through silicon experiment automobiles through a hydraulic diameter of 200µm, as well as 
300µm, with deionized liquid as elegant liquid. A lesser member field allows advanced exis￾tence of thermal edge deposit expansion as well as subordinate movement group, therefore 
additionally progressing the heat transfer presentation. Amongst all the conformations ver￾ified, arrangement 26°– NP is the supreme operative microchannel heat descend from side 
to side of grouping of trivial hydraulic distance minor slanting angle 26° and small slanting 
member pitch 500µm. Sakanova et al. (2015) [32] achieved a study with the new shape of 
the microchannel. The study dealt with the unique shape of the microchannel by bring￾ing out the wavy type of microchannel with 25µm, 50µm, and 75µm amplitude. The wavy 
structure was supplementarily scrutinized by varying the volume flow rate with three altered 
concentrations of nanofluid. The performance was increased by increasing the amplitude 
and decreasing wavelength which provides low thermal resistance and comparable pressure 
drop. However, the replacement of water fluid with Nanofluid effect is not affected by the 
wavy channels. Duangthongsuk et al. (2015) [33] verified the thermal conductivity, as well 
as stream parameters, of the heat descends for profiles that are spherical with rectangular 
pins (MCFHS with MSFHS) with SiO2 dispersed in DI water having fractional volumes of 
0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% of the sound strength. The description is the impact of needle structure, Different Process Parameters and Manufacturing Design of Heat Sink 409
particle concentration, and flow rate of the heat exchanger and pressure drop across the test 
site. It is assumed that the coefficient of heat emission increases with increasing the concen￾tration of particles and Reynolds numbers. Finally, it would suggest that the use of square 
shaped heat sinks should be avoided when the case comes to the circular shaped structure 
of fins. Raja et al. (2013) [34] scrutinized the heat transfer enhancements in a trapezoidal 
cross-section with laminar flow characteristics. They initially considered various base flu￾ids like water, Ethylene Glycol (EG), oil, and glycerin with nano-sized diamond particles of 
2% substrate materials like copper, aluminum, steel, and titanium. They conducted percent￾age enhancement tests in trapezoidal cross-sections and obtained 98.15% results in thermal 
resistance which were found to be a mixture of glycerin with diamond nanoparticles. Pandey 
et al. (2012) [35] performed an experimental analysis in a corrugated heat exchanger using 
nanofluid as a coolant. The trial unit contained three identical crenelated networks taking 
an angle of 20° by the nanofluid stream in the intermediate conduit with a warm liquid

stream in neighboring conduits. They note that increasing the amount of resin and pellet 
with decreasing neutrophil concentration indicates the quality of heat transfer properties. It 
is known from literature studies that the heat transfer performance of micro-channel radia￾tion is increased by changes in design and cooling equipment. Emekwuru et al. (2012) [36] 
used an experimental implementation of heat sinks containing a microelectronic chilling 
system and the spokes were incompletely burnt. The numerical study shown in this paper 
examines three different heat locations that are applied to the partially heated pool of heat￾ers. The results showed that the thermal resistance of the model with the central heating 
heater was the lowest of the heating models considered to be the majority of the Reynolds 
values studied. In the case of a central heating model, it can be seen that the full length of the 
shaft is used more efficiently in the heat transfer to the cooling air for test conditions. Byrne 
et al. (2012) [37] conducted an experiment varying concentration values to the volume of 
CuO and the second factor was the use of surfactant CTAB as a suspension enhancer. In 
this experiment, the hydrodynamic and thermal performances of seven fluids were deter￾mined. The microchannel heat transfer evaluation showed an increase in the performance of 
pure water to 10% by adding a surfactant and a particular increase of smaller concentration 
values. Even the surfactant also caused smaller improvements of heat transfer. Hung et al. 
(2012) [38] mathematically examined the laminar obligatory convection in a moderately 
permeable conduit by means of changed permeable chunks like four-sided opening expan￾sion, trapezoidal, thin quadrilateral, and chunk with snack circulation. The snack circulation 
had a lowermost drop in pressure, where the utmost of the thermal concert were enhanced. 
It was instituted that the snack, as well as quadrilateral projects, have the finest effectiveness 
of heat transfer with coding enactment. Gong et al. (2010) [39] examined wavy networks as 
an inactive arrangement to recover the heat transfer presentation of laminar liquid streams 
as functional to microchannel heat descends. Constraints in the study of three-dimensional 
laminar liquid current with a transfer of heat features in micro levelled undulating networks 
has been achieved by fluctuating the undulating article generosity as well as wavelengths at 
dissimilar Reynolds numbers amongst 51 and 151. Dualistic changed categories of undulat￾ing networks are measured with thermal enactment for a continuous heat instability of 46 
W/cm2. It has been initiated that undulating sides could be probable entrants for presenta￾tion enhancement in little Reynolds number laminar and present knowledge finished this 
as a suitable rule, as well as collection of the regular through river restrictions other than 
retaining any inessential mingling aids.
Chomdee et al. (2006) [40] examined the improvement of the heat transfer test by the 
Violeta generator for air cooling of the separator array of the electromagnetic rectangle 
modules. The sorter’s wiring is placed in front of the 3 × 5 model with a 20° vacuum. Each 
module has dimensions of 1.8 × 5.4 mm and × 0.6, each generating heat at a 2.5 microwave 
transfer wavelength function for awakening adiabatic heat associated with its associated 
modules and no vortex generator is examined in different values of Reynolds and module 
density. It can be seen that the vortex machine can promote the adiabatic heat transfer odds 
at a great expense, reducing the heat and temperature of the module. Ferrouillat et al. (2006) 
[41] analysed many simulations of roller driven generators and refined networks providing 
reliable quality and quantitative results. This study enhances our knowledge of the cha￾otic flow, heat exchanger, and the combined geometric mixing power of ECHOR. Using 
stable RANS and unsteady patterns with mass-producing imitation, the average outcome 
was obtained. For two vortex generators discussed here, calculations with refined networks Different Process Parameters and Manufacturing Design of Heat Sink 411
provide satisfactory results: the basic physical phenomenon is described and the basic geo￾metric parameters and their effects on the unrest are determined. Prstic et al. (2004) [42] 
introduced the new concept that “thin iron” metal to direct the flow of air directly into the 
medium pass was found to increase the heat energy of the radiation. The advantage of using 
a shield is the passage and reliance on the flow of drainage to penetrate the portion of the 
pathway to the radiation, which provides good heat transfer with decreasing average pres￾sure. The study highlights the remarkable features of the heat transfer concept by providing 
almost thermal resistance to a full configuration and pressure drop in many operational 
conditions close to the wrapping design section.
31.6 Conclusion
Many researchers have optimized the different process parameters of heat sinks. With the 
enhancement of research, specific heat transfer of heat sinks is increasing day by day. With 
a decrease in size of the components, heat generation rate increases, so to counter this high 
specific heat transfer a device is required. A heat sink is the most promising equipment to 
extract heat from electronic devises. With the development of technology, the size of the 
different electronic devices is decreasing day by day. So, with the decrement in size, heat 
generation is the most common problem which people are facing. To counter this problem, 
compact heat sinks with high specific heat transfer are required.

Abstract 
Concrete is undoubtedly the most widely utilized construction substance in the globe and it is used 
in the construction industry due to its high compressive strength. Because of this, nowadays the rate 
at which concrete is being used is much more than it was 50 years ago and it is estimated that the 
present utilization of concrete in the universe is of the order of 33 billion metric tonnes per year. An 
enormous assortment of waste materials are measured feasibly and even more for priceless additives 
for concrete. Some of the materials contain waste rubber tire, waste plastic, waste glass, fly ash, wood 
particles, coconut fibre, and silica fumes. All of these are very hazardous for the environment. Waste 
rubber tire, which is unsafe for all living beings, can be utilized for the construction works and for 
modifying properties of concrete. Hence, in this experimental study, the behavior of crumb rub￾ber on the compressive strength of concrete was analyzed by moderately replacing ,fine aggregates. 
Therefore, mixes are prepared after replacing sand with 1%, 3% and 5%. The cubes are tested after 
a curing period of 7 and 28 days with an M25 grade of concrete and Pozzolana Portland Cement.
Keywords: Concrete, crumb rubber, compressive strength, waste tire, waste material
32.1 Introduction
Concrete is a construction material composed of cement, sand ,and aggregates along with 
water. The work is performed in order to find an application of waste tires in the field of con￾struction giving an alternate method of their disposal and providing a pollution free envi￾ronment on the other hand. It also saves natural resources like fine aggregates. Concrete

materials are used for construction for three fundamental reasons. The first reason is con￾crete possesses excellent resistance to water. The second reason is the ease with which the 
structural elements can be formed by concrete into a variety of shapes and sizes. The third 
reason is that it is usually the cheapest and most readily available material. The discard of 
waste materials is one of the important issues all around the world. The discard of the waste 
of tires is a major concern because this material is not simply biodegradable even after an 
extensive duration of landfill treatment [1, 2].
Presently, handling process and utilization of tires is becoming a very serious and uneco￾nomical issue which is creating a negative effect on the environment [3]. This major prob￾lem requires an immediate solution. It is reported that by the end of 2030, an accumulation 
of 1200 million tires will take place [4-10]. Today, in the civil engineering field, tire waste 
with or without cutting is used for various construction purposes like noise screens, light 
fillers, erections of landfills, bridge support, and insulation [4, 9-11]. In a few countries 
a technique is adopted for decomposition of tires by simply burning them which is also 
precluded by their law and system. Another technique is land filling of tires due to their 
lighter density and poor degradation [12]. In the last few decades many researchers have 
investigated rubberized concrete for its natural properties. From an overall experimental 
study and literature review, it is studied that by adding rubber tires in concrete, compressive 
strength is decreased [12-20] along with the tensile strength and the modulus of elasticity 
[14, 16, 18-24]. Hence, the present study is performed with crumb rubber replacing aggre￾gates of concrete. 
32.2 Materials Used
Cement: Pozzolana Portland Cement is used in this present experimental work. 
It is tested as per IS: 12269-1987.
Fine Aggregates: Local river sand is used as a fine aggregate with particle size 
passed through 2.36 mm sized sieve and retained on 150 microns in this 
work and it is confirmed to zone second IS: 383:1970.
Coarse Aggregates: Coarse aggregates used in this work are crushed stone with 
a mixture of 10 mm and 20 mm sized sieve with the ratio of 3:2 and it is con￾firmed to zone second IS: 383:1970.
Water: Fresh water is used for mixing and curing which is free from impurities.
Waste Tire: Crumb rubber has particles that are ranging from 4.75 mm (sieve 
no.4) to more than 0.075 mm (sieve no.200). In this experimental work, 
crumb rubber particle size lesser than2.36 mm is prepared through mechan￾ical grinding of waste tire.
32.3 Results and Discussions
The present research work has followed the design mix of ratio of 1:1.5:3 with M25 grade 
concrete. The compressive strength of rubberized concrete is tested for 7 as well as 28 days 
of curing with four different ratios partially replaced with fine aggregates which are 0%, 
1%, 3%, and 5% of powdered crumb rubber mixed in the mixture of concrete. In this Crumb Rubber on Concrete by Partial Replacement of Fine Aggregates 417
experimental work, the water cement ratio is taken as 0.5 as a constant value for all the per￾centages of crumb rubber. The physical properties of cement obtained in the present study 
are given as above in Table 32.1.
The slump value as well as compressive strength for the control sample and various sam￾ples having proportions of crumb rubber of 1%, 3%, 5% is evaluated (as shown in Figures 
32.1 and 32.2) and is presented as per the following Tables 32.2 and 32.3 and Figures 32.3 
and 32.4.
The compressive strength of composite concrete made with crumb rubber is decreased 
but not remarkably. The decreasing trend in the compressive strength is attributed due to a 
weak bond between the paste of cement and crumb rubber particles [25]. This problem can 
be addressed by modifying the rubber particle surface [26]. Sodium Hydroxide is one of the 
suitable agents used for the modification of rubber surfaces resulting in an improved inter￾facial transition zone in concrete mix [25]. More intensive research is still required in order 
to use powdered crumb rubber as sand which is a fine aggregate or coarse aggregate in the 
mixture of concrete. The slump value is a significant parameter for measuring the hori￾zontal free flow which is known as the workability of concrete. However, the slump value

decreases with respect to conventional concrete with the introduction of crumb rubber. A 
reduction of 85% of slump has been observed in comparison to conventional concrete with 
concrete containing recycled tires [26, 27]. Higher air entrainment of rubber particles has 
also been observed [28, 29]. It is observed that slump of composite concrete is reduced after 
increasing the percentage of crumb rubber which results in less workability comparative to 
conventional concrete. But still, it can be used for normal concrete work such as construc￾tion work of curves, gardens, embankments, etc.

A similar trend of decreased workability has also been reported [26] in the case of scrap 
rubber waste. The workability depends on characteristics of rubber aggregate. Most of the 
studies have revealed that introduction of rubber aggregates results in decreased workabil￾ity although there are signatures of having no workability loss and moreover few studies 
have revealed the opposite behavior proving that workability is the function of characteris￾tics of rubber aggregates. The use of the crumb rubber to give normal strength to concrete 
is opening a new dimension in the field of concrete and if it is used properly on a large 
scale, then it can revolutionize the complete construction industry by making the cost of 
construction economical and giving way for the disposal of waste tires [30-32]. A detailed 
investigation is still required before introducing rubber waste into concrete [33].

detrimental effect on the slump value because its value still remains at more than 100 mm, 
hence it retains high workability. It has decreased the compressive strength, but such com￾posite concrete can be utilized for construction such as village roads, curbs, pathways, park￾ing, etc.

Time in Fused Deposition Modelling

Abstract
This article presents a method for estimating the build time of a popular additive manufacturing 
(AM) process, fused deposition modelling (FDM). FDM is widely used due to its affordability and 
availability. This extrusion-based AM process uses thermoplastic filament as a raw material to pro￾duce conceptual models as well as complex finished parts. Time estimation is a necessary require￾ment for process planning and a comparison of its productivity with other manufacturing processes 
and proper cost estimation is presented. The time to build a part comprises of the time to build the 
boundaries and the time required to print the inner portion of the part. A deterministic time estima￾tion model based on part geometry and machine parameters is presented. The geometrical parame￾ters comprise the height, surface area, and volume of the part. The machine parameters comprise of 
the nozzle diameter, nozzle velocity and acceleration, and other controllable parameters, including 
layer thickness and infill density. The build time is estimated by considering the kinematics of the 
nozzle. The time to print a part is greatly influenced by the motion of the nozzle, which may not be 
known a priori. Hence, apart from the deterministic time estimation model, a statistical method is 
also employed to consider the variation of the acceleration of the nozzle. For this, a correction factor 
is estimated based on the range of length traversed by the nozzle in a zigzag path. Finally, the lower 
and upper estimates of length and the corresponding time estimates are obtained. To demonstrate 
the efficacy of the proposed methodology, the model is validated with in-house experiments on an 
FDM machine. It was observed from the findings that the proposed methodology provides reason￾ably accurate estimates of build time. For all the tested parts, the error was less than 8%.

33.1 Introduction
Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a popular and economical additive manufacturing 
(AM) process [1]. Like several other AM processes, the steps involved in FDM are the 
creation of the digital model, its conversion to standard tessellation language (STL) for￾mat, transfer of the STL file to the AM machine, fixing the necessary process parameters, 
*Corresponding author: fds80@iitg.ac.in424 Optimization of Industrial Systems
building of the part by layer-by-layer deposition, removal of the part, and post-processing. 
FDM possesses the ability to produce prototypes as well as complex end-usable parts for 
various applications.
This extrusion-based AM technology was first patented in the year 1992 [2]. This technol￾ogy is also referred to as fused filament fabrication. However, the term FDM, a trademark 
name of the company Stratasys, is more widely referred to. FDM uses raw material in the 
form of thermoplastic filament material. The filament is continuously fed from the spool 
to the extruder as shown in Figure 33.1. The filament material is then heated up to 1–2 °C 
higher than the melting temperature. The molten material is extruded through the heated 
nozzle and it gets deposited to the print bed to form a layer of desired thickness. The layer 
thickness is dependent on the nozzle diameter, travelling speed, and material extrusion rate. 
After a layer is formed, the platform is lowered down in the z direction as per the prescribed 
layer thickness. The nozzle moves in the x-y plane and deposits molten material in a layer￾by-layer pattern until the complete part is built. The part is then removed from the bed with 
a scrapper and necessary post-processing operations are performed. For producing parts 
with complex geometrical features, two nozzles are equipped in the machinery. One is for the 
part material and the other nozzle for support material. Some thermoplastic filaments used 
for printing the parts are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), poly￾carbonate (PC), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), and nylon. Amongst 
these, ABS and PLA are the most common [4]. PLA offers better mechanical strength and 
low warping as compared to ABS. However, ABS has better toughness and impact resistance. 
Also, ABS is less prone to jam the nozzle during printing as compared to PLA [5].
In order to compete with other sustainable processes, FDM should be cost-effective. For 
this, an early estimation of the build time is essential. Build time is one of the important ele￾ments for cost estimation and production planning. Several investigations have been carried 
out by the researchers to understand the effect of process parameters on build time and reduce 
it. Alexander et al. [6] carried out one of the earliest studies for estimating the build time 
in FDM. The total build time was estimated by the summation of the production time and 
non-production time. The production time comprised the time required to build layers by 
depositing material. Non-production time comprised of the time involved in the movement of 
the nozzle without depositing material, lowering down of the nozzle in the z direction, cooling 
time, and cleaning of the nozzle. The methodology was implemented to estimate the build time

of an object with three different orientations. It was found that the build time of the object was 
minimum for the orientation having minimum support structures. The time estimated by this 
method underestimates the actual build time as the acceleration and retardation of the nozzle 
were not considered. Han et al. [7] carried out a build time analysis for the FDM process with 
an aim to improve production rate as well as the quality of the parts. The algorithm to estimate 
the build time comprised a procedure to determine the repositioning and cleaning time of the 
nozzle. The authors proposed an adaptive slicing (variable layer thickness) method by dividing 
the part into different zones; each zone was assigned a different layer thickness. Parts having 
simple geometrical features, e.g., a cylinder or a cuboid comprised of only one zone. However, 
the parts having complex geometrical features like sharp curvatures have multiple zones.
Thrimurthulu et al. [8] proposed a methodology to estimate the build time of an FDM 
produced part based on fundamental machine and geometrical parameters. They assumed 
that the deposition of the thermoplastic material is continuous and there is no interruption. 
Also, the study ignored the non-productive time and the effect of orientation of the part 
in the printing process. The build time of the part was obtained as a function of volume of 
the part to be fabricated, cross-sectional area of the nozzle, and extrusion velocity of the 
filament. The time estimated by this method will be different from the actual build time, 
as non-productive time (lowering down of the platform, time between ending and starting 
between two different paths) was not considered. Zhu et al. [9] proposed an analytical model 
to analyse the factors affecting build time in FDM. The build time of the part was estimated 
based on the time to print the layers, time to warm up the print bed, time to turn on the 
heater for extruding the molten material, and the setup time of the machine. To consider 
the effect of nozzle repositioning time and printing delay time, the authors employed a fac￾tor referred to as the intermittent factor. Experiments were conducted for validation of the 
model and to identify the significant factors influencing build time. Statistical analyses were 
also conducted to explore how geometrical parameters influence the build time of small (less 
than 50 cm3
), medium (50–100 cm3
), and large (greater than 100 cm3
) sized parts.
The effect of different orientations (rotation about different axes) as a part of the build 
time was explored by Rathee et al. [10]. They considered building a cylindrical shaped object 
by FDM process. They conducted several experimental runs and used response surface 
methodology, a statistical-based technique, to establish parametric models. It was found 
that layer thickness has the maximum effect on the build time irrespective of any orienta￾tion. Build time was found to be the least for orientations having the minimum z height. 
This may increase the cross-sectional area of a layer, but this also reduces the number of 
layers in the z direction. However, it was observed from the work of Chacon et al. [11] that 
specific to some geometries and process parameters, the orientation having a lesser num￾ber of layers took relatively more time. High printing speed and feed rate may increase the 
deposition rate of the material, but repositioning time of the nozzle takes time due to the 
effect of acceleration and deceleration.
Some researchers have used an artificial neural network (ANN), a popular soft comput￾ing technique, in the build time estimation of AM processes [12,13]. For example, Di Angelo 
and Di Stefano [12] attempted to estimate the build time of several AM processes including 
SLA, SLS, FDM, LOM, and three-dimensional printing (3DP). For this, they considered the 
part’s height and volume, layer thickness, and repositioning movements. Experiments were 
conducted only for FDM and 3DP considering six test cases. The average percentage errors 
for FDM and 3DP were 11.5% and 12%, respectively.426 Optimization of Industrial Systems
In a recent study, Komines et al. [14] presented analytical as well as empirical build 
time estimation models for FDM, which were validated by experiments. In the analytical 
approach, the deposition time was estimated as the time required by the nozzle head to 
move with constant velocity and the acceleration time of the nozzle. On the other hand, in 
the parametric approach, an acceleration coefficient was considered. However, the effect 
of different geometries on acceleration was not mentioned explicitly. The analytical model 
produced relatively more accurate results than the parametric model. As per the authors, 
the build time is highly influenced by the acceleration of the nozzle especially for fabri￾cating complex geometrical parts. However, their method requires a lot of computational 
effort and a priori knowledge of detailed nozzle motion is required.
The present article proposes a simplified yet reasonably accurate analytical model for 
estimating the build time in an FDM process. The model ignores the micro-details of noz￾zle motion and complexities in the features. It takes easy to supply data as inputs and esti￾mates the build-time considering uncertainties. The chapter is organized as follows: Section 
2 presents a deterministic model; Section 3 presents the upgraded model that considers 
uncertainties in the nozzle motion and makes interval estimations; Section 4 validates the 
model with in-house experiments; and Section 5 concludes the chapter.
33.2 A Deterministic Model for Time Estimation
This section describes the methodology to develop a deterministic analytical model for 
the build time estimation. The methodology is developed by considering the building of 
a hollow rectangular prism and then generalizing it for building any part by using certain 
factors. Figure 33.2 depicts the top view of the prism with outer boundary ABCD and inner 
boundary EFGH. It is assumed that the track width of deposition is the same as the nozzle 
diameter. Building of this part is carried out in the following stages:
(i) Building of outer surface bounded by rectangular ABCD: During this 
stage, the nozzle of diameter d traverses the outer periphery and deposits 
the material to make solid layers. If the perimeter of rectangle ABCD is 
po
, the nozzle will cover a distance of (po
−2d) in tracing the outer surface. 
However, usually the thickness of the wall is enhanced by traversing the 
nozzle again. The second time, the nozzle will cover a distance of (po
−4d).
(ii) Building of the inner surface bounded by rectangular EFGH: During this 
stage, the nozzle of diameter d traverses the inner periphery and deposits 
the material to make solid layers. If the perimeter of rectangular EFGH is 
p, the nozzle will cover a distance of (pi
+2d) in tracing the inner surface. 
During the second trace for enhancing the inner wall thickness, the nozzle 
will cover a distance of (pi
+4d).
(iii) Building of the bottom surface: During this stage, the nozzle will scan the 
area between inner and outer walls to make the solid bottom surface. 
(iv) Filling the volume with prescribed infill density: During this stage, the 
nozzle moves in a zigzag path to build a structure with a prescribed infill 
density. Infill density can vary from 0 (no material) to 100% (totally 
solid structure). The lower the infill density, the less time and material Analytical Model for Estimation of Build Time in Fused Deposition Modelling 427
required. Figure 33.3 shows a schematic of a fully solid layer and a par￾tially filled layer. 
(v) Building of the top surface: This stage is similar to stage (iii) and makes a 
solid top surface. 
The motion of a nozzle comprises of acceleration, uniform velocity, and retardation. 
Consider that the maximum velocity of the nozzle is v and uniform acceleration as well as 
retardation is a. Depending on the distance covered by the nozzle, two scenarios of motion 
may occur as shown in Figure 33.4. When the traverse distance is large, the nozzle is able 
to attain the maximum velocity as shown in Figure 33.4(a). OB represents the time period 
in which the nozzle starts from zero velocity and attains the maximum velocity. The nozzle 
travels with constant velocity in time period BC. In time period CD, the nozzle decelerates 
and comes to a rest. The total distance l traversed in the time period OD is given by the area 
under the velocity-time diagram as per Figure 33.4(a):

When the traverse distance is not large, the inequality in Equation 33.3 is not satisfied. The 
nozzle does not attain its maximum velocity as shown in Figure 33.4b. If the distance traversed 
in time period OD is l, the distance traversed in the time period OB will be l/2. During this 
period, the nozzle accelerates and attains some velocity. By laws of kinematics, l/2 is obtained as

Equation 33.8 gives the time when the distance l travelled by the nozzle is not large.
Now time estimation for the aforesaid five stages is as follows:
Stage (i): For building the outer wall of thickness equal to twice the nozzle diameter, the 
distance covered by the nozzle is (2po
−6d). Considering it as a large distance satisfying the 
inequality of Equation 33.3, the time for making one layer in this stage is

where Vnet is the net volume to be filled and I

Vnet = ρ(l

t
) (33.15)
This value of Vnet can be substituted in Equation 33.13 to get a time estimation. However, 
due to zigzag non-uniform motion, the actual time will be more than this ideal estimate. It 
is very tedious to carry out the proper motion analysis, particularly at the planning stage. A 
simplified approach is to assume that the nozzle undergoes a number of cycles by starting 
from rest, reaching the peak velocity, and, after some time, retard to again come to rest. 
Consider that in a cycle, it covers a traverse distance l. In that case, the actual time of tra￾verse can be estimated from Equation 33.2 or Equation 33.8. On the other hand, the ideal 
time to traverse this length is
t = l

Accuracy of estimation is highly dependent on choosing a typical representative value

33.3 Determination of Lower and Upper Limits of Time Estimates 
Accurate estimation of the correction factor (c) in the printing process is a difficult task. 
This factor depends on the average length (l) travelled by the nozzle in a zigzag path. For 
determining a proper range of l, a statistical approach is adopted in this work. The approach 
relies on the random measurements of the length at a few places. The following steps are 
executed:
Step 1: It is decided to take ns
 samples for estimating l. In each sample, nd
 mea￾surements are carried out. 
Step 2: For each sample, the mean length is calculated as

Where the t-value is a statistic of Student’s t-distribution and α is the significance level. 
Considering 95% confidence, the value of α is 0.05. The t-value is obtained from a standard 
statistical table. 
Using this procedure, lower and upper estimates of length are obtained, which helps in 
providing interval estimation of printing time. 
33.4 Validation
The time estimation model is validated by printing various parts in Riwell RL 200A, an 
extrusion-based desktop 3D printer shown in Figure 33.5 [15]. Acrylonitrile butadiene sty￾rene (ABS), a widely used thermoplastic material is used for printing the parts. The machine 
parameters considered in this study are given in Table 33.1.

Figure 33.6 shows five parts printed by FDM. Geometric parameters of the part are 
shown in Table 33.2. Table 33.3 provides the details of time estimation. A representative 
average traverse length was chosen to estimate the correction factor. The maximum error in 
the time estimation is 7.89 % for Part 4. Errors in the time estimation are less than 5% for 
Parts 1, 2, 3, and 5. These results are for deterministic analysis. Further analysis was carried 
out by taking the interval estimate of representative traverse length.

The values of range of length traversed by the nozzle, other necessary variables, and 
the confidence interval are listed in Table 33.4. Next, the lower as well as upper esti￾mates of time corresponding to different values of l are computed based on the method 
described in Section 3. As shown in Table 33.5, the lower, deterministic (most likely) 
and upper (high) limits of a parameter are denoted by l
l
, ml
, and hl
, respectively. It is 
observed that for Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 the actual printing time falls within the 
interval estimate. For the other two parts, i.e., Part 4 and Part 5, the actual time is 
very close to the estimated time interval. Thus, the effectiveness of the methodology is 
demonstrated.
33.5 Conclusion
In this work, a simple method of printing time estimation in the FDM process is devel￾oped. Initially, the deterministic model is developed based on geometrical as well as 
machine parameters. To consider the non-uniform zigzag motion of the nozzle, a sta￾tistical approach is proposed to consider the variation of acceleration. Based on the 
range of length traversed by the nozzle, the model can also provide the lower and upper 
estimates along with the most likely estimate. These three time estimates can be used 
to construct a linear triangular membership function of printing time. The fuzzy time 
estimation can be used to estimate fuzzy cost as was done by Sharma and Dixit [16, 
17] for a selective laser sintering process. Validation for the model proposed in this 
work was carried out by conducting a few in-house experiments. It is observed that the 
proposed model provides a fairly accurate estimate of printing time. Future work will 
be focused to test the model for other complicated parts and also by changing infill 
density.

Thermomechanical Analysis of Pulsed Laser 
Welded Thin Aluminium Alloy Sheets
Tapas Bajpai*, Pankaj Kumar Gupta and Anup Malik
 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India
Abstract
Pulsed laser welding involves several complex phenomenon occurring simultaneously, hence a 
multi-physics simulation study is required to predict thermo-mechanical behaviour of pulsed laser 
weldments. The present study reports on numerical analysis of transient temperature and residual 
stress distribution and in thin aluminium alloy AA5052 weldments during the pulsed laser welding 
process. For determining thermal fields, residual stresses, and deformations, a three-dimensional 
thermal-mechanical finite element (FE) model was proposed. To simulate the welding process, 
the finite element modelling software ANSYSTM was used. Temperature-dependent thermal and 
mechanical properties are employed in the numerical model and effects of latent heat and heat dis￾sipation due to conduction, radiation, and convection were taken into consideration during thermal 
analysis. For simulating the material deposition during the welding process, element death and birth 
technique were adopted.
Keywords: Pulsed laser welding, thermal stresses and distortions, finite element analysis
34.1 Introduction
Aluminium alloys are widely used in manufacturing industries due to their high specific 
modulus of elasticity, excellent corrosion resistance, and high strength to weight ratio. 
Normally, these aluminium alloys (AA) are welded by gas metal arc (GMA) and tungsten 
inert gas (TIG) welding processes. However, with these available traditional welding tech￾niques, it is difficult to obtain good quality thin aluminium alloy weldments due to a wide 
heat affected zone (HAZ) produced during the welding processes. The pulsed laser welding 
process is widely adopted for joining thin sheets as the process offers low heat input, high 
energy density, and smaller HAZ. Hence, thin sheets of AA may be joined by the pulsed 
laser welding (PLW) process (Neradova and Kovacocy, 2010; Rodrigues, 2015). Although 
the process offers fewer thermal distortions, it is difficult to prevent them in thin sheets due 
to relatively less stiffness. The residual stresses and distortions produced in the weldments 
due to mechanical and metallurgical changes not only affects the dimensional accuracy

but also influences the service performance of the final components. Thus, it is import￾ant to analyse residual stresses and distortions produced in thin sheets during pulsed laser 
welding process. Although many investigations have been carried out to determine residual 
stresses and distortions in weldments, there is little literature available on thin sheets with 
clamping restraint conditions. Since the experimental investigations are expensive, authors 
proposed a thermal-structural finite element (FE) model to predict temperature distribu￾tion and distortions in AA5052 during the pulsed laser welding processes. 
With an increase in the popularity of computational welding mechanics, numerical sim￾ulation is a widely used tool to analyse the thermal elastic-plastic behaviour of weldments 
associated with the welding processes. Yuquan et al. (2014) proposed a three-dimensional 
finite element model to study the thermal-structural behaviour of thin Hastelloy C-276 
sheets during the pulsed laser welding process. Convection and radiation effects and the 
effect of fixtures during heating and cooling were accounted in the analysis. Han et al. (2012) 
developed an FE model of pulsed laser welding for zircaloy-4 considering phase transi￾tions and temperature dependent material properties. Further, they numerically analysed 
the effect of pulsed laser parameters on weld pool shape and weld distortions and verified 
it by conducting experiments. Yuquan et al. (2014) aimed to assess the thermo-mechanical 
behaviour of pulsed laser welded thin Hastelloy C-276 sheets using an FE model. The model 
took into account the effect of restraint and temperature dependent material properties. 
Kim et al. (2015) conducted simulation investigations on the pulsed laser welding distor￾tions in a nuclear fuel spacer grid system with 0.5 mm thickness. Bajpei et al. (2016) pro￾posed a 3D FE model to estimate residual stresses and distortions during welding of thin 
aluminium alloy sheets using different heat sink models. For modelling the heat input, the 
Goldak double ellipsoidal heat source model was adopted. Casalino and Mortello (2016) 
applied a 3D FE model to determine welding distortions and residual stresses in fibre laser 
welding of Ti6Al4V. Thermal contact resistance was modelled to improve the accuracy of 
the model. In this study, a thermal-structural finite element model was developed to predict 
temperature distribution and residual stresses during PLW welding processes. The FE sim￾ulation was performed on ANSYSTM Workbench v.15. Effects of temperature dependent 
material properties and latent heat effect were considered during the numerical analysis. 
34.2 Finite Element Modelling
34.2.1 Geometry and Mesh Model
On the basis of symmetry of the geometry about the weld centreline, half of the sheet 
was selected for the FEM modelling. The dimensions of the sheet used in the model were 
200 mm × 150 mm × 3 mm. For capturing high temperature gradients in the weld region 
fine meshing was provided within a distance of 5 mm from the weld centreline and grad￾ually coarse mesh for regions away from the weld region. Figure 34.1 shows a 3D finite 
element mesh model used in analysis. All the thermal and structural measurements were 
performed by using a Temperature Probe and Stress Probe located at a distance away from 
the weld centre line as shown in Figure 34.2. Thermomechanical Analysis of Pulsed Laser Welded Thin AA Sheets 441
34.2.2 Material Properties
Temperature dependent properties of AA5052 as presented in Table 34.1 were used for car￾rying out the simulation (Zhu and Chao, 2002). The tangent modulus was considered to be 
0.5% of the Young’s modulus at the corresponding temperature. The value of Poisson’s ratio 
(ν) was kept constant and assumed as 0.34. The effect of latent heat was taken into account 
by adjusting the values of specific heat (Capriccioli and Frosi, 2009). Properties in the liquid 
region were neglected in the analysis. In the structural analysis a bilinear strain hardening 
model was used.

34.2.3 Thermal Analysis
A heat source with Gaussian heat distribution was adopted in the thermal analysis for a 
pulsed laser welding process. The volumetric heat distribution can be expressed by the fol￾lowing equation (Han et al., 2012):

where y is the distance normal to the weld plate, rb
 is the radius of the laser beam, Ptot is 
the total absorbed power, Ptot = α, Pinc, Pinc is the incident laser power, and α is the average 
absorptivity of the weld plate material, and c is shape parameter of the heat flux distribu￾tion. Welding conditions used in the simulation of the pulsed laser welding process are 
presented in Table 34.2. For determining temperature history, the heat source in ANSYSTM
was simulated by using DO* loop in a finite number of steps. Thermal load was applied in 
steps, i.e., for a particular time step only, the load is activated, and for other steps it remains 
deactivated. Based on the speed of the heat source, a total of 101 time steps were chosen in 
the analysis. A time step of 900 s was used for the process to simulate cooling of weldments 
into a steady state.
34.2.4 Mechanical Analysis
For obtaining the temperature distribution, transient thermal analysis is carried out 
first and subsequently, iterative structural analysis is performed. Further, imported 
thermal loads were utilised for executing structural computations. During the weld￾ing process, the total strain increment can be represented as a summation of plastic

For thermal analysis, meshing of the model is done with three dimensional SOLID90 
elements while 3D SOLID186 elements were used for structural analysis. A total of 8148 
elements were used to simulate both thermal and structural analysis. Total elapsed time 
for thermal computation is about 70 minutes and for structural computation is about 920 
minutes. The analysis was performed on a work station computer with a Intel core i5-2320 
CPU and 12 GB of RAM.
34.2.5 Boundary Conditions
During the thermal analysis, heat dissipation due to convection and radiation was included 
in the model. The first convective heat transfer coefficient of 250 W/m2
 °C due to the flow 
of argon gas was applied near the fusion zone on the top surface of the plate and a heat 
transfer coefficient of 11 W/m2
 °C was applied on the rest of the surfaces of the weld sheets. 
These values are obtained from the experimental calculations (Bajpei et al., 2016). Initial 
surrounding temperature was assumed to be 28°C.
In the structural analysis, fixed and frictional support boundary conditions were applied 
on AA sheets as shown in Figure 34.3. The clamp size used in the analysis was 80 mm × 40

was applied. For performing the numerical simulations, the ‘’Full Newton’’ method was 
employed in ANSYS. 
34.3 Results and Discussion
34.3.1 Thermal Variations
Figure 34.4 shows the numerically obtained transient temperature distribution in the 
pulsed laser welding process. High temperatures were measured as the heat source 
moves in the welding direction. Further, with the advancement of a heat source in the 
weld direction, reduction in temperature is observed due to heat dissipation primar￾ily by conduction and convection. The maximum value of temperature obtained after 
executing a transient thermal simulation is 166 °C in pulsed laser welding. Figure 34.5 
illustrates the contours of transient temperature in AA5052 sheets in the PLW process. 
It is evident from Figure 34.5 that maximum temperature in the fusion zone of a laser

welded plate is 630 °C. This indicates melting of aluminium alloy sheet material. With 
the advancement of heat source in the welding direction, the temperature decreases 
considerably from 295 °C - 228 °C. This is due to the increase in thermal conductivity 
at higher temperatures. 
34.3.2 Residual Stresses
Figure 34.6 shows the contours of longitudinal residual stresses and transverse residual 
stresses developed in the sheets during the finite element analysis of pulsed laser weld￾ing and GMA welding processes. From the figures it is seen that 3D residual stresses is 
developed around the weld zone developed during welding processes. Tensile stresses were 
produced in the weld zone vicinity due to the contraction of AA sheets during cooling and 
compressive stresses were produced in the material distant from the weld zone. Also, it is 
found that compressive stresses were developed in the weld sheets around the clamping

CFD Analysis of Car Parking Area to 
Study Carbon Monoxide Levels

Haryana, India
Abstract
The objective of the present research work is the measurement of the carbon monoxide levels in car 
parking. We know that there are primarily two health effects of CO emissions in a car parking garage 
on the human body. The first effect is breathing problems and another effect is chest pain. The CO 
produced by the fuel combustion in automobiles is in the form of gasoline smoke and oil fumes. It 
can cause nausea, headaches, confusion, and chest pain. Also, CO fumes are responsible for potential 
fire hazards. In order to dilute the effects of CO on human health, we need a proper ventilation of 
CO. The ventilation can also help in controlling other contaminants such as CO2
. The objective of the 
present work is to design a ventilation system in car parking for a CO level of 130 mg/m3
 (120 ppm) 
for 15-minute exposure, CO level of 74 mg/m3
 (65 ppm) for 30-minute exposure, and a maximum 
of 40 mg/m3 (35 ppm) for a 1-hour exposure limit as per the health and safety regulations according 
to the ASHRAE Handbook. In the present work, first we make a 3D model in the 3D modelling 
software Salome Mesh. We use governing equations such as mass conservation, momentum conser￾vation, and species conservation, however, we have not used energy conservation. We also used a 
jet fan because circulation is required for the fresh air in the car parking. The jet fan model is an IV 
smart EC induction fan. The considered fluid flow is turbulent. In order to account for the effect of 
turbulence, we used the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) based turbulence model, namely 
the standard k-epsilon model. All the governing equations are solved using an open-source CFD 
software OpenFOAM. The software is written in C++ language and provides the facility to modify 
the simulation code according to the requirement of the client. Contours of carbon monoxide level, 
velocity vector, velocity contour, pressure distribution, turbulence kinetic energy distribution, and 
rate of dissipation of turbulent of kinetic energy have been plotted. All the results have been shown 
from the ground level to the level of human height and jet height in the car parking area. Based on 
the results obtained, we determined the exact place where the jet fan should be installed for the cir￾culation of the fresh air in the car parking area.

35.1 Introduction
The car parking design is either completely closed or partially closed. For completely 
closed car parking, mechanical ventilation is required. On the other hand, along with 
mechanical ventilation, fresh air is also required for partially closed car parking. In auto￾mobile garages two concerns are present, the first concern is breathing problems and 
another concern is chest pain. The CO produced by the fuel combustion in automobiles 
is in the form of gasoline smoke and oil fumes. It can cause nausea, headaches, confusion, 
and chest pain. CO fumes are responsible for a potential fire. Other concerns regarding 
oxides of nitrogen and smoke haze from diesel engines may also require consideration. 
On the other hand, the ventilation required to dilute carbon monoxide to acceptable 
levels also controls the additional contaminants in the car parking. Spiljer et al. (2015) 
describes various types ventilation systems and one of them is a jet fan ventilation sys￾tem. The ventilation system is dependent not simply on the standards applied during 
the design of the system, but on the plans of the underground vehicle leave. Dimyadi 
and Amor (2019) describe modern regulatory systems in the UK, Australia, and New 
Zealand, that allow car-park ventilation systems to be designed to comply with perfor￾mance-based objectives. Duci et al. (2004) discusses the lack of information about the 
CO dispersion in a closed garage, such as organization of a microenvironment, with high 
expected CO concentration. Chaloulakou et al. (2003) discussed two different microen￾vironments present that were simulated on the outside and inside the car parking garage. 
The maximum limit of CO according to the Association Advancing Occupational and 
Environmental Health (ACGIH) is 25 ppm (29 mg/m3
) for an 8-hour exposure, but the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released the maximum limit near the sea as 
35 ppm (40 mg/m3
) for 1-hour exposure. In Europe, the CO contamination level varies 
between (40 mg/m3
) 35 ppm and CO of (230 mg/m3
) 200 ppm. The acceptance of CO 
contamination level varies nation to nation according to their agency opinion. We have to 
maintain the acceptance value of CO in the car park, so we should design the ventilation 
system for maintaining a CO level of 40 mg/m3
 (35 ppm) for 1-hour exposure accord￾ing to the World Health Organization (WHO). ASHRAE (America Society for Heating 
Refrigeration Air-Conditioning Engineer) is another standard followed for the estimate 
of CO emission. The standard gives a limit of CO exposure into the car parking area for 
human health as per Table 35.1.

35.2 Computational Fluid Dynamics Analysis
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be utilized to simultaneously predict airflow, 
heat transfer rate, and contaminant transport over a building. A CFD software works on 
basic physical equations such as fluid flow and energy transfer. The method is used for 
steady as well as unsteady state solutions coupled with differential equations that are used 
for fluid flow. The benefit of this method is to solve complex flow problems that are based 
on basic modelling involving some physics. It has used a very diverse range of uses in auto￾motives, aerospace, nuclear engineering, turbo machinery, bio-medical field, buildings, the 
environment, and fire safety engineering. A number of assumptions are taken throughout 
the CFD tool while formulating, constructing, and solving a particular flow problem.
35.2.1 Processes Involved in CFD
While utilizing a CFD tool for undertaking a flow and thermal analysis, there are number 
of steps that are involved for completing the CFD process. 
• Defining the computational region
• Identifying physical models 
• Setting boundary conditions at the extents of the computational domains, 
including inlets, outlets, walls, jet fans, supply fans, and exhaust fans
• Discretizing the partial differential equations, which includes generating 
grids (which sub-divides the computational domain into small volumes) and 
discretizing time steps (which turns the time into discrete time steps) 
• Analyzing and visualizing the simulation results
35.3 Governing Equations
Governing equations (Navier-Stokes equations) are equations that mathematically repre￾sent the physical problem considered. Hence, these equations are important in any CFD 
simulation. There are two types of governing equations used in CFD simulations: one is 
in compressible form and another is in incompressible form. To develop a mathematical 
representation of the physical problem considered in the present chapter and numerically 
solve the 3-D Navier-Stokes equations over a discretized flow field, incompressible Navier￾Stokes equations conservation of mass, and species transport equations are described below 
• Mass Conservation 
• Species Conservation
• Momentum Conservation 
35.3.1 Conservation of Mass 
In conservation of mass, it is ensured mathematically that the mass is conserved for a cho￾sen control volume. Change of mass due to density change inside the control volume is 450 Optimization of Industrial Systems
balanced by the net mass inflow to the control volume. For steady flows, the mass inflow 
to control volume is balanced by the mass outflow. The conservation of mass is written in 
coordinate free form as 
ρ  ρ
∂
∂ + ∇ = t .( u) 0 (35.1) 
where ρ denotes the density and 
u denotes the velocity vector.
35.3.2 Conservation of Species 
In order to model the conservation of carbon monoxide in the domain, an equation for 
conservation of species has been used. This can be represented by the species transportation 
equation as follows where the velocity is denoted by 
u , mass fraction by ‘Y’, and chemical 
species are denoted using ‘i’ in the subscript.

variation,

 u denotes convective contribution due to net inflow,

 denotes diffusive contribution of net inflow, and
mi denotes the production rate of species within the control volume due to 
chemical reaction.
35.3.3 Conservation of Momentum
Newton’s Second Law of Motion is utilized to derive the momentum conservation equation 
for a control volume. In other words, the rate of change in momentum for a fluid particle is 
equal to the sum of the external forces acting on it. The conservation of momentum equa￾tion can be expressed as:

volume.CFD Analysis of Car Parking Area to Study Carbon Monoxide Levels 451
35.4 Turbulence Model
There are mainly two types of models, laminar and turbulence models. These are simply 
the models used for solving the fluid flow and heat transfer related to numerical problems 
and involving various conditions of either laminar or turbulent flow depending upon which 
model we are using for the solution. We can use the laminar model, but it neglects the effects 
of eddies, vorticities, and other turbulent effects that are present in the flow. We use tur￾bulence modelling to take into account the various factors that are present in the real fluid 
flow. There are numerous turbulence models available but the choice of a particular model 
depends upon the turbulent viscosity and there is no universal model that can be applied to 
every case of fluid motion. Turbulent models are classified according to the governing equa￾tions. This governing equation helps in finding out the turbulent viscosity in a numerical 
method. There are several turbulent models used based on whether the flow is unsteady or 
steady. In the present work, we are using a steady-state turbulence model namely a standard 
k-epsilon model. The details of this model have been discussed in the next section. 
35.4.1 Types of Turbulence Model
There are three type of turbulent models as follows: RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier 
Stokes), LES ( \Large Eddy Simulation), and DNS (Direct Numerical Solution). DNS and 
LES are highly accurate models, however these models require significantly high compu￾tational resources. RANS based turbulence models offer satisfactory accuracy at the cost 
of reasonable computational cost. This is why most of the engineering flow problems are 
tackled using RANS based turbulence models. 
35.4.2 Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS)
In the present work, we are using a RANS based turbulence model. In RANS the instanta￾neous quantity is divided into the sum of mean and fluctuating quantity. RANS based models 
have closure problems due to unknown Reynolds stresses that exist in the RANS equations. 
These stresses are modeled using turbulent eddy viscosity. This model is suitable for both 
steady as well as unsteady problems. While the RANS turbulent model takes less storage and 
time for computation, it easily converges when compared to DNS and LES turbulent models. 
The most commonly used RANS turbulence model is a standard k-epsilon model and we are 
also using the same model for design and ventilation in the car parking area. This model is 
robust as well as simple for modelling flows involving indoor environment simulation. 
35.4.2.1 Standard K–Epsilon Model
In this model, two transport equations are solved to compute the turbulent eddy viscosity 
(Launder and Spalding, 1983). The first transport equation utilized is the transport equa￾tion of turbulent kinetic energy

35.5 Computational Domain and Boundary Conditions
A few simple assumptions are involved in mathematical modelling of physical flow and 
heat transfer problems. In the present work, sufficient care has been taken while tak￾ing assumptions in order to meet the safety requirements. The CO emissions generated 
within the car park area are calculated as per ASHRAE standards and the calculated CO 
emission value was distributed in the whole car park area. The analysis is done with a car 
parking area of 819.2 m2
 and car parking volume of 2037m3
. The emission rate per vehi￾cles is 115.0 mg/sec and total CO concentration in concerned geometry (CC) is 99.36 mg/
sec. The 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional geometrical model of the car parking have 
been prepared using an open source computer aided design (CAD) software SALOME. 
The 2-dimensional model and 3-dimensional model have been shown in Figure 35.1 and 
Figure 35.2, respectively. The green colors represent the natural fresh air opening and red 
colors represent the exhaust fan opening in the below sketch 
The entire computational domain has been discretized into small volumes using the grid 
generation software SALOME. Due to the complex geometry, unstructured mesh has been 
generated. Near the walls, mesh has been clustered to account for the effect of the wall on 
the numerical solution. A 3-dimensional grid is shown in Figure 35.3. The minimum cell 
size in any direction is taken as 0.1m. The total number of grids generated is 0.5 million. The 
maximum aspect ratio is 5.08 in the generated mesh. CFD Analysis of Car Parking Area to Study Carbon Monoxide Levels 453

35.6 Numerical Method
The open source CFD package OpenFOAM (Open Source Field Operation and 
Manipulation) was utilized to conduct a simulation of car parks and to measure the 
concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) therein. OpenFOAM is an open-source finite 
volume method (FVM) based C++ library which provides applications to solve spe￾cific fluid flow, heat transfer, and combustion problems. A customized solver based on 
bouyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam was used to solve all the governing equations discussed 
above. The solver named bouyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam is part of the default solver pro￾vided by OpenFOAM. The customized solver is an incompressible solver in which density 
is assumed to be constant during the simulation. All the governing equations have been 
discretized using the FVM Method and turbulence has been modelled by using a k-epsilon 
turbulent model in OpenFOAM. The Gaussian integration was used with different types of 
interpolation strategy for discretization. We used linear interpolation for Laplacian terms. 
A combination of PISO and SIMPLE algorithm was used for coupling momentum and 
pressure equations. This coupled algorithm is called a PIMPLE algorithm. The conver￾gence criteria for scaled residuals was set as 10-6 for continuity, momentum, and species 
transport equations. The Maximum Courant number during the simulation is kept less 
than 0.5.

35.8 Conclusions
In the present paper, a CFD simulation has been done to study the ventilation system 
in car parks. A customized solver based on bouyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam available in 
OpenFOAM was used to solve all the governing equations. In order to lower the CO level 
within the recommended limits, a ventilation system in car parks has been designed. This 
has been accomplished using CFD simulation. All assumptions have been taken accord￾ing to industrial standards. The maximum CO concentrations obtained in the car park 
area from the CFD simulations, with placing the induction fans, is 104 ppm (124.8 mg/
m3
) in the car park area, which is within acceptable CO limits for 15 minutes of human 
exposure as per ASHRAE standard, however, it is more than the acceptable CO limit as 
per Slovakia Executive regulations. Hence, the proposed induction fan ventilation system 
is able to extract the CO from the car park area as per ASHRAE standard requirement to 
reduce the CO concentration further. To meet the Slovakia Executive regulations it requires 
an increase in the exhaust airflow rates.

Abstract 
This chapter presents the performance analysis of a single pass semi-transparent photovoltaic ther￾mal (SPSPVT) module (case A) and double pass semi-transparent photovoltaic thermal (DPSPVT) 
module (case B). A comparative study has been carried out for the climatic condition of Bikaner. 
Energy and exergy analysis of both the cases has been carried out and energy matrices like energy 
payback time (EPBT), life cycle conversion efficiency (LCCE), and energy production factor (EPF) 
are used for comparison. The effect of EPBT and carbon credits on annualized uniform cost has 
been investigated for both the cases. The observation reveals that the lowest value of annualized 
uniform cost of case B is less by 31% and 21% than case A when effect of EPBT is considered on an 
exergy and energy basis, respectively. With the combined effect of EPBT on annualized uniform 
cost, it is observed that the highest values of case B are 33% and 56% higher than case A on an 
exergy and energy basis, respectively. The overall performance of case B is better than case A in all 
respects.

36.1 Introduction
The overall performance evaluation of a PVT system can be carried out based on ther￾modynamics, economics, marketing, and/or environmental implications. Lu and Law 
(2013) have developed an overall methodology for investigating the thermal and power 
behaviours of a semitransparent single-glazed photovoltaic window for office buildings 
in Hong Kong. Agrawal and Tiwari (2013) have performed energy matrices and enviro￾economic analysis of a glazed hybrid PVT system for New Delhi and reported that the 
environmental cost for overall thermal energy is 36.97 $/annum and for overall exergy is 
8.55 $/annum. A novel design of a dynamic model of an air based photovoltaic thermal 
system has been presented by Sohel et al. (2014). They showed that the thermal efficiency

and first law efficiency increased linearly with the increase in ambient temperature while 
the electrical efficiency and second law efficiency decrease. Rajoria et al. have performed 
the economic analysis of opaque, semi-transparent, and SCT based arrays and deduced 
very useful expressions for showing the effect of energy payback time on annualized uni￾form cost and earned carbon credits. Huang and Yu (2017) have performed a study on an 
EPBT on BiPVT system of three different kinds and found that the energy payback time 
of three systems is 3.0-7.4 years, which is far less than the PV system’s life cycle. A life 
cycle assessment of a standalone PV system has been performed by Wang et al. (2019). 
They have found that the EPBT for the microgrid was 9.2 years, while the EPBT values 
for grid extension and the diesel generator were 6.4 and 10.1 times longer than that of the 
microgrid, respectively.
36.2 System Description
The prescribed systems consist of a semi-transparent PVT module with 36 solar cells of 75 
Wp
 capacity each. The module having a duct below the panel to pass the air is referred to 
as a single pass semi-transparent photovoltaic thermal (SPSPVT) module (case A) and the 
one having ducts above and below the module is referred as a double pass semi-transparent 
photovoltaic thermal (DPSPVT) module (case B). The upper duct is made of glass to pass 
the solar radiation and the lower duct is made with acrylic sheet as depicted in Figures 36.1a 
and 36.1b, respectively.

36.4 Economic Analysis
The economic analysis involves a new idea for environmental assessment, i.e., the embodied 
energy. The purpose of this concept is used life cycle energy calculations of PVT modules. 
Thus, the purpose of any embodied energy analysis is to enumerate the amount of energy 
used to produce a material or component. This involves the evaluation of the overall energy 
consumption required to extract the raw material, fabricate a product or components, for 
installation, and to maintain the component element that is being assessed. 
36.4.1 Energy Matrices
Three basic matrices, namely energy payback time (EPBT), the energy production factor 
(EPF), and the life cycle conversion efficiency (LCCE) has been used to assess the perfor￾mance of the two cases mentioned.
(i) Energy Payback Time (TEPB)
The EPBT depends on the energy consumed to produce the materials used for fabrica￾tion of the module and its components, i.e., embodied energy and annual energy output 
obtained from the module.
It is the ratio of the total energy spent in the manufacturing of DPSPVT module and 
installation of the module (ECon) to the total energy out (EOut).

(ii) Energy Production Factor (EPF) 
The overall energy performance of the DPSPVT module can be evaluated by comparing 
the total energy consumed to the total energy output. The ratio of energy consumed and 
energy output is referred as the energy production factor. It is used to predict the overall 
performance of the system. The energy production factor is a function of time because both 
EOut and ECon are time dependent and can be defined by two ways.

36.2, while Figure 36.3 shows the cash flow diagram considering the effect of EPBT on the 
life cycle cost. In this method, new NPV is calculated from the point where EPBT is over 
and will be symbolized as VP T, EPB. The data for embodied energy and methodology adopted 
by Rajoria et al. (2016) for the computation of carbon credits and net present value has been

36.5 Results and Discussion 
The performance analysis of a DPSPVT module has been carried out and its comparison 
has been done with the analysis of an SPSPVT module carried out by Singh et al. (2016). 
The latter will be considered case A and the former as case B, respectively, in the further 
discussion. 
Figure 36.4 shows the annual overall exergy and overall thermal energy gain for case 
A and B, respectively. It is observed that the overall exergy gain for case-B has increased

by almost 50% and overall thermal energy gain by 45% compared to case A. A better heat 
removal is possible from two sides, which is responsible for higher gain in case B. EPBT and 
EPF on an annual basis are given in Table 36.1. 
It has been observed that the energy payback time for case B is less as compared to case A 
on the basis of overall thermal and exergy gain, respectively. The energy production factor 
is more for case B than case A on both the bases. A lower EPBT and higher EPF represent 
a better system. 
The LCCE has been evaluated for the life (n) of 20, 25, and 30 years on the basis of annual 
overall thermal energy and exergy gain for both the cases and is depicted in Table 36.2. The 
LCCE shows an increasing pattern as higher life of the system is considered. The highest 
LCCE of case B for 30 years has been observed, which is 0.86 and 0.13 on an energy and 
exergy basis, respectively. 
The variation of annualized uniform cost (Rs. / kWh) for a different life span and interest 
rates for case A and B without considering the effect of EPBT has been shown in Table 36.3. 
It has been observed that the annualized uniform cost for both the cases is decreasing 
with the increase in life span and at the same time, for a given life span, case B has a lower 
value than case A. The lowest value at an interest rate of 8% and a life span of 30 years is 
observed for case B, which is Rs. 19.92 /kWh and Rs. 3.26 /kWh against Rs. 24.73 /kWh and 
Rs. 4.01 /kWh for case A on the basis of overall exergy and thermal gain, respectively. Table 
36.4 shows the variation of annualized uniform cost considering the effect of EPBT for 
both the cases and it is important to note that the present value in this scenario is computed 
from the point where the EPBT is ended.

The annualized uniform cost obtained by adopting this method is higher than those 
without consideration of EPBT, but this approach gives more realistic values than the con￾ventional method. The lowest value of annualized uniform cost for case B is Rs. 29.47/kWh 
and Rs. 3.55/kWh, while for case A it is Rs. 42.57/kWh and Rs. 4.47/kWh on the basis of 
overall exergy and thermal gain, respectively, for a life span of 30 years with an interest rate 
of 8%. From the above study, it may be noted that, for scenarios related to Figures 36.2 and 
36.3, the annualized uniform cost (Rs. / kWh) is indicative of the cost of energy incurred 
(negative sign) in the system and hence, it can be concluded that the system with a lower 
value of annualized uniform cost is a better one.

36.6 Conclusion
The following conclusions have been drawn from the above analysis
• The energy payback time is 1.00 and 5.80 years for case B and it is 1.30 and 
8.00 for case A on the overall energy and exergy basis, respectively.
• The maximum EPF has been observed for case B, which is 1.10 and 0.20 on 
energy and exergy basis, respectively, while the highest LCCE of case B has 
been observed for 30 years, which is 0.86 and 0.13 on the energy and exergy 
basis, respectively.
• The value of lowest annualized uniform cost under conventional approach 
for case B is 21.6% and 18.7% less than case A on an exergy and energy basis, 
respectively. Similarly, when considering the effect of EPBT, the annualized 
uniform cost of case B is less by 30.7% and 20.7% than case A on an exergy 
and energy basis, respectively.

levels up to 4 cycles and to the cumulative strain of 2.4. Microstructural characterization of deformed 
material at different strain values was quantified using an optical microscope and transmission electron 
microscope. It was observed that MDF developed ultrafine grains (~300 nm) and full of dislocation 
cells structure along with subgrains. Mechanical testing showed that increasing the stain resulted in 
increased yield strength and hardness values attributed to accumulation of high density of dislocations 
owing to effective suppression of dynamic recovery and formation of equiaxed sub-grain structure with 
deformation bands. Corrosion behavior was studied using a cyclic polarization test and showed lower 
values of corrosion current density (Icorr= 23.53 nA/cm2
) for MDF samples indicating resistance to 
pitting corrosion than the received samples (Icorr= 76.81 nA/cm2
). Results of cryoforged samples when 
compared with cryorolled samples of equivalent accumulated strain has shown nearly similar trends.

37.1 Introduction
Several severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques such as equal channel angu￾lar pressing (ECAP) [1], high pressure torsion (HPT) [2], multi-axial forging (MAF) [3-4], 
and accumulative roll bonding (ARB) [5] have been developed and this is an area of inter￾est among material scientists and researchers for grain refinement in materials to produce 
ultrafine grained/nanostructured grains in bulk material with grain sizes between 1µm to 
100 nm from its counterpart on applying high hydrostatic pressure and shear deformation

deforming relatively at higher plastic strains. Multiaxial forging (MAF) is a promising SPD 
technique to refine microstructures where material is processed in a die to a defined strain, 
then removed and rotated to 90°, reinserted in die again, and pressed to the same strain 
after each pass. The material is least distorted, even after larger strains. It was developed 
by Salishchev et al. [6] and refined the microstructures of titanium, magnesium, and high 
strength nickel based alloys. Materials like aluminum, magnesium, and stainless steel were 
also forged to observe grain refinement. Grain refinement of the materials plays a signifi￾cant role on physical, chemical, and mechanical properties in polycrystalline materials [7], 
whereas grain refinement in material is affected by initial grain size, deformation tempera￾ture, strain rates, alloying elements, dispersoids, stacking fault energy of the material, and 
processing routes [8]. The microstructural heterogeneity and reduction in the grain size 
affects the kinetics of ultrafine grain development [9]. On the other hand, reducing the 
processing temperature slows down the kinetics of continuous dynamic recrystallisation 
[10]. Al 5083 alloy is used widely in structural applications such as marine, automobile, and 
aerospace industries due to their lightweight, high formability, moderate strength and high 
corrosion resistance. Grain refinement in aluminum alloys is difficult at room temperature 
due to high stacking fault energy and the material undergoes dynamic recovery at higher 
strain values. However, deformation at cryogenic temperatures restricts dynamic recov￾ery during plastic deformation and dislocation interaction accumulates high dislocation 
density at lower strain values. The effect of cryoforging and cryorolling on microstructural 
evolution and mechanical properties of the aluminum alloys (Al 5083 alloy, Al 6061 alloy) 
has already been discussed by the authors in a previous work [4, 11]. After MAF of Al 
6061, the composite microstructure of dislocation cells and lamaller boundaries at defor￾mation bands and equiaxed structure away from deformation bands leading to an increase 
in hardness was observed at 3 cycles, thereafter dynamic recovery was reported at 6 cycles. 
Mula et al. [12] studied the effect of cryoforging followed by aging on Al 2024 alloy and 
reported the enhancement in yield strength, ductility (UTS-500 MPa, ductility-9.7%), and 
corrosion resistance of deformed material consisting of deformation bands. Kapoor et al. 
[13] observed softening beyond 6 passes of MAF of pure aluminum, the fraction of high 
angle boundaries increased, and the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density 
decreases. There is no information available on the formation of ultrafine grained Al 5083 
alloy through cryoforging. The corrosion behaviour of deformed material has no consis￾tency in reported results. Therefore, the current study is intended to investigate the effects 
of forging at liquid nitrogen temperature -196 o
C on microstructure evolution, mechanical 
properties, and corrosion behaviour. The grain refinement observed is compared with uni￾directional rolling at the same temperature and at equivalent strain.
37.2 Experimental Details
Commercially available Al 5083 alloy plate (99.8%Al, 0.02%Mn, 0.03%Fe, and 0.07% Zn) 
was used in the present work. Samples with initial dimensions of 27 x 30.5 x 33 mm3
 were 
produced by machining and then subjected to homogenized annealing at 510 o
C for 2 hrs 
and quenched in water at room temperature. The initial microstructure comprises of 80 µm 
grain size, as shown in Figure 37.1. MDF was performed at liquid nitrogen temperature 
-196 o
C, referred to as cryoforging, for 2, 3, and 4 cycles. Samples were kept for 10 minutes Mechanical and Corrosion Behavior of Al 5083 Alloy 475
in liquid nitrogen and die was also filled with liquid nitrogen up to sample height during 
forging to avoid recovery. The sample was rotated to 90o
 after each pass. Each cycle com￾prised of 3 passes and the true strain per cycle was 0.6 up to Σɛ = 1.2 (2 cycles), Σɛ = 1.8 (3 
cycles), and Σɛ = 2.4 (4 cycles).
Cryorolling (CR) was performed on samples of 10 × 30 × 40 mm3
 up to a final thickness 
of 1 mm, i.e., equivalent strain of ~2.3. The samples were dipped in liquid nitrogen (-196 o
C) 
for 10 min prior to each pass to achieve thickness reduction of 90%. A schematic diagram 
of MAF and CR are shown in Figure 37.2. 
The microstructure of deformed material was characterised through an optical micro￾scope after etching the samples using Poulton’s reagent. Transmission election microscopy 
(TEM) observations were made on an FEI Technai 20 transmission electron microscope 
operated at 200 KV and the samples were polished by twin jet polishing with a solution 
of 20% perchloric acid and 80% methanol at -40 o

was measured by Vickers hardness testing machine (FEI- VM50 PC), applying 5 Kg load 
with 15s dwell time at room temperature and by a tensile testing (H25K-S Tinius Oslen) 
machine by preparing small sized samples with a gauge length of 8 mm. The thickness and 
width of gauge length sections were 1.5 mm and 3 mm, respectively, with a total length 
of the sample of 27 mm. Four samples were tested to check the reproducibility of test￾ing. Corrosion behaviour was investigated through cyclic polarization measurements using 
Gamry potentiostat (interface 1000).The samples were forward scanned at a rate of 5mV/s.
37.3 Result Discussion
37.3.1 Microstructural Investigation
Figure 37.3a shows the optical microstructure of solution treated material, with a relatively 
equiaxed coarse grain size of around 80 µm. Fine black color indicates Al3
Mg2
 particles 
aligned along grain boundaries observed in the material. Coarse precipitates of Al (Fe, Cr, 
Mn) in abundance and medium size Mg2
Si particles are also observed in the matrix. The 
dislocation of the free matrix along with rod shaped intermetallic particles of Al6
 Mn is 
revealed after solution treatment, as reported in our previous work and by other authors 
for the same material [11, 14]. Figure 37.3b, c, and d show the deformed microstructure 
evolved after MDF and CR at cryogenic temperature. After MDF, up to 3 cycles of defor￾mation bands in various directions were observed, but the size was small and with mutual 
crossing.
On increasing MDF cycles up to 4, the density of deformation bands is remarkably 
higher (marked with arrows in Figure 37.3c) and the second phase particles were frag￾mented and randomly distributed in the matrix as the large plastic strain is accumulated. 
Mutual crossing of deformation bands was observed due to change in direction after each 
pass. These observations are in agreement with previous works reported on MDF of Al 6061 
and Al 2024 at liquid nitrogen temperature [4, 12]. However, CR leads to an elongation of

the original grains along the rolling direction with ill defined grain boundaries and lamellar 
microstructures were observed. From TEM micrographs (Figures 37.4 (a-c)), the deforma￾tion microstructures developed at an equivalent strain of 2.4, resulting in the formation of 
a fine grain substructure of 300 nm with extended substructure due to strain localization at 
shear bands. The SAED image in the inset shows ring patterns indicating fine grain struc￾ture and evolution of high angle grain boundaries from low angle grain boundaries. Azimi 
et al. reported similar nanoscale subgrains with nanoscale deformation in Al 2219 when 
forged at cryogenic temperature over conventional forging that results in improvement in 
mechanical properties [15]. CR at equivalent strain contains a fine homogeneous subgrain 
structure with heavy dislocation pile up inside the grains.
37.3.2 Mechanical Properties
The change in the microstructure during cryogenic deformation indicates a substantial 
effect of the deformation technique on grain refinement which can be observed through 
mechanical behavior (Figure 37.5 and Table 37.1). Samples for hardness and tensile tests 
were made on a plane perpendicular to the forging axis of the last cycle in MDF and along 
the rolling direction in CR samples. It is observed that the hardness value raises on an 
increasing number of forging cycles and is maximum (142 Hv) at plastic deformation of 
ε∼2.4, compared to 63.5 Hv of a received sample, which is around 1.23 times. The CR

samples have shown less hardness (127 Hv) than MDF samples (142Hv). The YS and UTS 
were found to be 476 MPa and 493 MPa, which shows a significant improvement in strength, 
which is slightly more than CR samples (YS-460MPa, UTS-478 MPa). This improvement 
in behavior is a contribution of solid solution strengthening, work hardening effects, and 
grain boundary strengthening of material. Odnobokova et al. observed that MDF alleviates 
the formation of sub grain boundary structures with high dislocation density networks 
comprising of low-to-moderate misorientations in comparison to CR. Therefore, substan￾tial work hardening is noticed in MDF samples as characterized by an increase in hardness 
and strength values compared to CR samples [16]. The ductility was considerably reduced 
to 4.5%, but higher than 3.5% of CR samples may be due to sample size effects and heavy 
structural refinement of the alloy.
37.3.3 Corrosion Behavior
The cyclic polarization graph for a received (AR) and ST+MDF-4 C are evidenced in Figure 
37.6 and corrosion behavior is recorded in Table 37.2. The Icorr values were derived by 
extrapolating the linear Tafel segments of the cathode and anode polarization curves. 
Solution treatment followed by MDF alloy exhibits had more noble corrosion potential 
(-914.4 mV) compared to AR alloy (-932.6 mV), while the Icorr decreases from 76.81 nA/
cm2
 to 23.53 nA/cm2
. The Icorr value reflects the corrosion rate with more accuracy than 
that of Ecorr. The MDF, fractures the coarse grained as received microstructure into num￾ber of sub grains, grain boundaries and dislocation densities which lead to ease in formation

of uniform oxide film on the surface of UFG material [17, 18]. It is reported in previous 
studies that oxidation in metals occurs at crystallographic defects like grain boundaries and 
dislocations. These non-equilibrium and ill defined grain boundaries and large residual 
stresses inside the grain were observed during severe deformation providing the potential 
sites for growth of denser passive films than coarse grained counter parts. The literature on 
corrosion resistance in UFG Al alloys developed by ECAP, CR, ARB, and rotary swagging 
has shown improvement in comparison with bulk Al alloys [19-22]. The AR samples may 
have second phase particles on the grain boundaries resulting in a decrease in Ecorr values 
due to differences in the electrochemical potential.
The value of the passive potential range EPIT-ECORR may be used to indicate a material’s 
resistance to corrosion. The greater the value is, the greater the material’s resistance to cor￾rosion. Therefore, the MDF sample shows higher resistance towards corrosion. The passive 
potential range (EPIT-ERP) raised for the MDF alloy as the received Al alloy is shown in 
Table 37.2. In an MDF sample, the passive potential range is large due to fragmentation of 
grains and the presence of structural inhomogeneity in material due to second phase par￾ticles, interfaces, and other lattice defects (grain boundaries, dislocations). Therefore, the 
MDF sample shows higher resistance towards corrosion than course grained AR material. 
Miyamoto [23] reported that for solid solutions under soluble limits, such as Al-Mg alloys, 
that in corrosive media, selective dissolution of solute elements or solvents may cause the 
concentration gradient at the surface and in the case of UFG structures, this tendency gets 
promoted, which results in higher corrosion resistance. Table 37.3 summarizes the reports

demonstrating the general trend to observe the effect of UFG structures on corrosion 
behavior in various aluminum alloys developed through different techniques, but it is tough 
to make a general conclusion on the corrosion resistance of metals. 
37.4 Conclusion
(a)Multidirectional forging at cryogenic temperature was successfully used to 
refine an initial coarse grained microstructure of Al 5083 alloy. After 4 cycles 
of forging, a fine-grained structure of 300 nm average grain size was formed. 
(b)Microstructural refinement was accompanied by enhancement in YS-476 
MPa and UTS-493 MPa compared to that of ST condition samples, but the 
tensile ductility is reduced to 4.5%.
(c)The MDF-4C specimen showed better corrosion resistance compared to AR 
specimens. This improvement is due to the refinement of grains leading to 
formation of a greater grain boundary area leading to low current density.

Abstract 
Cold spraying is a procedure of solid-state powder deposition employing numerous exclusive prop￾erties, permitting the creation of coatings from a broad scope of materials. This innovation was 
found coincidentally when researchers attempted to study the two-phase supersonic flows by putting 
copper particles into the wind tunnel. Fruitful deposition of a variety of materials by cold spray gives 
the chance to tailor a wide scope of substrate/coating systems with explicit capacities for various 
applications. This chapter briefly describes the different parts of the sensible and imaginative devel￾opment of the cold spraying procedure inside the field of reproduction and repair using an idea of 
added substance fabricating. An intensive report was led on this innovation’s capability to form both 
thick and thin coatings while profiting by diminished residual stress levels contrasted with tradi￾tional thermal spray coating procedures like plasma spraying or high-velocity oxy-fuel. An orga￾nized review of process technologies, especially concentrating on the appropriateness of composite 
particles of ceramic-metal utilized in a deposition, was conducted. Additionally, the explanation 
was prepared relevant to molecule effects and bonding mechanisms at the time of deposition. The 
review is concluded with an assigned area to propose new avenues for additional exploration and 
improvements. 
Keywords: Cold spraying, coating, coating materials, corrosion, thermal spraying 
38.1 Introduction 
Thermal spray advances have advanced since the 1980’s from being difficultly controlled to 
controlled forms. At first, the difficult instrument was to improve the thermal spray based 
coatings which were the centre. This method was used for the most part portrayed by how 
the coating is shaped from melt or semi-melt beads, with a beginning fabric within the shape 
of powder, wire, or bars and is nourished into the fire delivered by the spraying weapon [1]. 
The nature of the vitality depends upon the source (warm/dynamic) and the kept fabric

shall give one kind of characteristic in coatings. In particular, coatings are utilized accu￾rately over a range of building businesses, especially within the repair and manufacture 
of the parts to upgrade the alternative surface properties of moo taken a toll, lightweight, 
and solid ventures. There are numerous illustrations of recovery, particularly plasma spray￾ing and HVOF (high velocity oxy-fuel), which are used for coatings in the generation of 
higher adhesion and minimum porosity [2]. The coatings are progressed to supply superior 
expectations over an untreated substrate for prescient over the benefit lifetime or for more 
effective execution in specific applications [3–6]. Advanced coatings are useful for supply￾ing numerous properties to parts. Very few applications value specifying carried resistance, 
resistivity erosion, warm resistivity, resistivity in oxidation, electrical resistivity, electrical 
conductivity, weakness quality, water repellent, anti-microbials, controlling of clearance, 
self-healing/cleaning, non-sticky, biocompatible, bioactive, dissemination hindrance, and 
high absorption capacity [7, 8]. These are regularly empowering, but troublesome advances 
in a differing to extend items such as upstream pumps, gas turbine motors, penetrate bit, 
glass building and insert orthopaedic.
Cold spray is a developing process found in 1990 [9] from a perception test and a hypo￾thetical is to relate the supersonic stream in two-phases (strong molecule + gas) to explore 
in burrow wind. It began in the Soviet Union with a group of analysts from Founded 
Connected Mechanics (ITAM) of the Russian Institute of Sciences and Hypothetical, a 
Siberian department, which is connected to interact with the two-phase stream through 
the surface of a submerged stiff. (Particles) and illustrated that it would be conceivable 
for near coatings from a strong particle in the stagnation temperature of the steam room. 
Awaiting it, for the most part, acknowledged that getting a coating required particles to be 
warmed to tall temperatures to ensure their dissolving within the stream of gas and which 
particles were within the strong state. It was incomprehensible to get a coating by spraying. 
Since at that point, the innovation has delighted in many cycles and has accomplished the 
most prominent victory by spraying metal precipitate/metal combination particles with the 
assistance of expansive accelerating metal particles [10]. A few licenses were recorded along 
these lines and given for the improvement of splash gear utilizing this handle and for the 
testimony of different materials such as polymers, metals amalgams, and blends [11]. 
There is a fundamental distinction among the conventional cold spraying and thermal 
spraying process. Thermal spraying technology needs heat and kinetic energy to make a 
coating, whereas cold spray employments were kinetic energy, as shown in Figure 38.1.
Molecule softening does not happen in a cold spray, as the method temperature remains 
underneath 800°C, although HVOF preserves up to 3000°C. Delicate resources (simple 
near misshape plastically) and resources that have the small warming capacity (simple near 
attain cut flimsiness) distantly profited from utilizing the strategy. This particular highlight 
empowers the utilization similarly used for powders and substrates that are temperature

delicate (like nano-structured and undefined) or oxygen delicate (such as titanium, alu￾minum, copper, etc.). Previously, the drive of a high-velocity molecule (more noteworthy 
than 1200 m/s) inside the nonappearance of warm vitality within the hard state produces 
regular coatings amid insignificant negligible remaining stretches and porosity. Cold spray 
is reliably favorable. Methods used for application include uniform and non-porous coats 
that are essentially lacking permitting substrate warming [12, 13]. In this way, this mod￾ern arrangement of small process temperatures through high molecule dynamic speeds 
requests an appropriate and orderly state-of-the-art model. As relevance areas grow ever 
extra and as handle yield surpasses creative energy, this survey chapter will center its con￾sideration on the developing request for cold splash coatings and 3D added substance fab￾ricating components within the repair and fabricating businesses.
38.2 Principle of Cold Spraying 
An essential guideline includes cold spraying which easily handles an elevated-velocity 
(300 to 1200 m/s) chatter fly and shaped employing of the comparative merging/separating 
spout or lavel is utilized for powder particles (from 1 to 50 μm). Spraying it into the sub￾strate found roughly 25 mm from an outlet of a spout anywhere they affect and on another 
side, the coating is formed. A dynamic vitality of these particles moderately having large 
temperatures makes a difference to keep up the strain vitality of the plastic from collisions, 
which increments the temperature of the substrate and mollifies a fabric, which diminishes 
the rate of strain solidifying. These impacts would be additionally known as adiabatic shear 
precariousness. Resulting deposits would have experienced tall temperature oxidation, 
dissipation, dissolving, crystallization, remaining stresses, and altogether lower decreases 
within the frame of gas discharge. In this preparation, the powder elements are quickened 
via supersonic planes at the temperature which is continuously smaller than a material soft￾ening aim, coming inside a formation of a coating from particles within a strong condition, 
thus softening as well as hardening the handle [14, 15].
The schematic of an agent cold splash weapon appears in Figure 38.2.
Under pressure, gasses (regularly discuss, helium and nitrogen) are regularly warmed 
through electrical vitality near temperatures extending as of 300 to 800°C along with, after 
that, separating the spout to create a supersonic gas fly that passed to a converging. In 
any case, not at all like customary warm splash forms, gas is heated. Enhanced speed has

supersonic value close to the focalized deviation spout. A supersonic speed mach (M = v / 
vs
, anywhere v is the gas speed, also vs
 is the sound velocity) comes due to changes besides 
the nozzle within a convergence component of the spout 1>M, within a throat M = 1, and 
within the inverse portion 1< M. While the speed of the gas increments, temperature, as 
well as the weight of the gas diminish, and concurring to the preservation of vitality law, 
speed and temperature must be ensured. Since the extension of the gas comes about in a 
diminish in temperature, which is a few cases that may be indeed underneath room tem￾perature, the method is named cold spray. Table 38.1 shows the comparison between the 
parameters of lower-pressure and higher-pressure cold spraying processes.
38.3 Contact Phenomenon and Bonding Mechanism of Cold 
Spraying Process
An arrangement of the coating is accomplished in mechanical deformation of the kinetic 
energy of the particles and changes in heat energy, which is lying on the arrangement of 
10-7 s. It was recommended that the bonding is, towards a great extent, suitable near mechan￾ical interlocking; anywhere the substrate physically traps particles. Due to high impact of 
speeds, an external local molecule that influences a substrate encounters extreme plastic 
distortion with huge temperature increments. It is accepted that. a temperature spike comes 
within the neighborhood dissolving of a molecule; everywhere the liquid fabric shapes a 
solid bond among the substrate [16, 17]. The molecule – molecule and molecule – substrate 
are hypothesized to head for a rise to nearby adiabatic shear insecurity [18] due to thermal 
softening. Agreeing to the adiabatic shear insecurity hypothesis, when a molecule is influ￾enced in a cold spraying, the molecule-molecule or molecule-substrate encounters a wide 
localized distortion (i.e., shear distortion) amid the interfacial field impact that leads to the 
disintegration/precariousness of lean oxide surfaces. 
This stress reduces a rate of solidifying and the stream stretch (momentary stretch to 
misshape something) becomes its greatest at certain stress esteem. At that point, it starts 
to diminish with the extra stress beneath genuine conditions (i.e., strain, fluctuating stress,

microstructure, temperature) and softening in pressure (heat, shear) is contained. In this 
case of localization, a stream push rapidly gets to be zero (i.e., plastic distortion happens 
exceptionally effortlessly in a limit locale around the molecule-substrate interface) and driv￾ing to the infusion of an interception fly, a protest hits the water comparative to the splatter 
made of the same, presently intensely distorted, particle-like fabric and at last expels the 
oxide film on top of the fly molecule. 
Also, the substrate, empowering coordinate contacts to metallic surfaces, in this way 
advancing a relationship with moderately large contact pressures as well as adiabatic soft￾ening of the interfacial locale. In any case, a more all-around acknowledged linkage compo￾nent can be caught on by separating the intermolecular wonders keen on four unmistakable 
stages [19] as in Figure 38.3.
Within an introductory phase, the molecule material’s lean film (monolayer) is kept 
on top of a substrate. This phase is categorized with a coordinate interface of the particle 
through a substrate, as well as is incredibly dependent upon the degree of planning of the 
substrate surfaces and substrate material characteristics. This phase incorporates a surface 
enactment time (acceptance time), amid which erosion will happen instead of a statement. 
Within the moment phase, there will be molecule distortion as well as realignment. A layer 
of limited breadth is shaped. While condensate, the material is uprooted by the point of 
contact and that contact zone increments into estimates. Also, the fabric streams are keen 
on the inner molecule vessels that are proportionate towards impact of peening. Then, the 
third phase is categorized via an arrangement of the metal bonding among particles and a 
zero cut. The fourth phase compares to more thickness with difficult work due to peening 
impact of a coating.
38.4 Coatings by Cold Spray
Surface coatings are utilized precisely over a range of fabricating. Building businesses en 
route for upgrading a property of surface of parts shall be made by lower-cost, lighter 
weight, and otherwise maintainable materials. This permits an architect to move towards 
the effective cost and high-performance of parts through functionalized characteristics of 
surface precisely used for a specified utilization. These may be frequently empowering trou￾blesome advances in a differing run of items such as drill bits, engineering glass, gas turbine 
engines, and orthopedic inserts, towards the title. Surface building and progressed coatings 
are utilized to grant an unsurprising expansion of working lifetime or else supply property 
to untreated substrate not used for productive execution into a specific function. A differ￾ent quality of material prerequisites, along with the financial affect of materials misfortune

owing to surface corruption, has driven the advancement of an assortment which is produc￾tive and has taken a toll on successful surface treatment forms. Carry safe erosion material 
should be exorbitant and needs uncommon procedures used for fabrication. Therefore, it 
is not conceivable or else conservative towards manufacturing a complicated plan utilizing 
wear along with safe erosion material. A simple arrangement towards such an issue which 
en routes the harder-facing layer on the moderately delicate as well as machinable surfaces 
is needed. Table 38.2 presents the concise outline of material which is utilized, as well as 
compares its application in cold spray. Despite the fact that the roll is exceptionally exten￾sive with many of the materials which cannot be specified owing to limited non-disclosure/

application can be considered agreeing to their aiming reason, which takes after: 
• For the accomplishment of an unadulterated deposition 
• For accomplishing progressed surface property throughout with way better

• For guaranteeing extraordinarily small or insignificant heat should be trans￾mitted to substrate
Unadulterated coating, as well as superior interlock, leads to enhanced thermal as well 
as electrical conductivity, which can moreover donate amazing mechanical quality and 
higher resistance towards erosion. Profoundly immaculate with homogeneous coating 
during cold splash creates eminent fitting for applications in biomedical, chemicals, and 
gadgets. Other than that, giving particular store characteristic cold splash could be a wor￾thy plausibility in favor of application at whatever points the bottom material is oxygen 
and heat-sensitive.
38.5 Cold Spraying Coatings Applications
The first uses of the CS methodology occurred in the last decade of the previous century 
[23]. This technique is also widely used in many businesses to increase the value of a 
commodity by improving the reliability and consistency of a wide range of consumer 
products. Furthermore, nearly all products have been deposited utilising the CS coating 
technique [24]. Several writers used cold spray for a variety of purposes, as shown in 
Figure 38.4.

38.5.1 Energy Sectors 
The cold gas dynamic spraying technology has strong prospectives for development in 
recent sectors, like thermal power plants, where it can improve the existence of super heater 
tubes by recovering higher temperature corrosion of intense chlorine-based and sulphate 
conditions [25, 26]. 
38.5.2 Nuclear Power Plant 
Austenitic nickel and iron alloys make up the bulk of wetted surfaces of nuclear power 
plants that are accountable for stress corrosion cracking (SSC) [27]. According to the exper￾imental results, an increase in bond reliability occurs when using a composite with a lower 
yield strength when using the cold spray technique. 
38.5.3 3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing 
3D printing is a cutting-edge technique that creates 3-D structures by depositing content 
layer by layer, whether it is aluminium, plastic, or concrete. AM has many advantages over 
conventional production processes, including minimised resource waste, parts that can be 
quickly assembled, good accuracy and efficiency, and a shorter time cycle [28]. Through 
depositing content layer upon layer, this manufacturing method will create every complex 
contour [29, 30]. 
38.5.4 Catalysis 
Metal powder particles may be retained at low temperatures using a dynamic cold gas spray. 
This helps to inhibit certain crystalline changes because TiO2 is a good material for photo￾catalyst coatings. Since transformations (crystalline/thermal) to rutile phase occur for high 
temperature thermal spray techniques [31], The results from SEM and XRD showed that 
the powder structure was preserved during cold spray because of low temperature. 
38.5.5 Biomedical Application 
Since hydroxyapatite (HAP) coatings are bioactive and osteoconductive, they are often 
used for forming the clear and solid biological fixations with adjacent bone tissue [35]. 
According to the results of the study, coated substrate has a higher adhesion ability and a 
greater surface finishing than bare substrate. The experimental results demonstrated that 
inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation with the alloy powder offers viable options to manage 
biofilm formation. 
38.5.6 Wear Application 
Numerous writers have effectively deposited various metal–ceramic cold sprayed coatings 
upon various steels for increased resistance to wear [32], [33], and [34]. The following is a 
list of a variety of coatings deposition by cold spraying method for increased resistance to 
wear upon various substrates, along with criteria, implementations, and conclusion. Critical Review of Cold Spraying Coating Techniques 493
38.5.7 Dimensional Restoration and Repairing Applications 
Numerous device parts are discarded in aerospace applications due to numerous defects cre￾ated in production. CS is the most cost-effective way for patching faulty components. Moog and 
colleagues’ (2017) [36] CS aluminum coating was used to effectively patch Mg cast housing. 
38.5.8 Corrosion Protection 
Corrosion is an unfavourable decay of an alloy or metal. In layman’s terms, it is a substance 
(metal/alloy) contact with the atmosphere that has a negative impact on the material’s 
to-be-preserved properties [37]. Cold spray technology is an efficient method of protect￾ing a substrate/material from ecological interaction and preventing corrosion. The primary 
purpose of CS coating is for covering a surface of the material and serves like a buffer for 
chloride ions, oxygen, blocking water, and other destructive substances from reacting with 
substrate and starting its corrosion [38]. 
38.5.9 Electrical Applications 
Since cold spraying coatings have strong thermal and electrical conductivity, they are uti￾lised for improvement in the electrical properties of products and are fit for electronic com￾panies. Since ceramics are commonly used as insulating substrates, the cold gas dynamic 
is primarily utilized in power electronics [43]. Tazegul et al. (2016) [43] used cold spray 
to create Cu matrix composite coatings for electrical applications. Furthermore, the touch 
resistance of the above coating decreased and stabilised at 3.5 mX. According to the author, 
annealing is the primary factor that influences both contact resistance and microstructure. 
38.5.10 Antimicrobial 
Bacterial development on surfaces occurs in many food manufacturing sectors and hospi￾tals due to the possibility of increased risk of bacterial contamination [39]. Bacterial infec￾tion is more prevalent on nurse stations, hospital surfaces, kitchens, and patient quarters 
[40, 41]. Several researchers have investigated the antimicrobial properties of Cu and its 
alloys against specific microorganisms that cause health trouble in food manufacturing, 
air conditioning, and other industries [42]. Despite this, no ideal Cu surface deposition 
approach for such applications has been established. At the end of 1100 hours of immersion 
in chloride solution, no corrosion was detected at the substrate/coating interface. 
38.6 Advantages and Potential Challenges of Cold Splash upon 
Another Thermal Spray Processes
Compared to other coat forms, supersonic cold splash offers numerous mechanical advan￾tages, including: 
a. Cold spraying coating would be utilized to create wide, unadulterated, 
thick coats. along with well-reinforced stores of numerous metal as well as 494 Optimization of Industrial Systems
combinations, such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), nickel 
(Ni), commercially unadulterated zinc (Zn), titanium (Ti) and silver (Ag) 
with nickel-base amalgams (Inconels, Hastalloys), and stainless steel and 
bond coats, such as MCrAlYs. 
b. Cold spraying shall create metals composites with metals like copper-tungsten 
or copper-chromium (Cu-W) aluminum-silicon carbide (Al-SiC) and metal￾oxides like (Al-Al2
O3
, NiCr-Al2
O3) aluminum-alumina. 
c. Cold spraying has been utilized on the way to deliver defensive coatings as 
well as an execution upgrading layer, ultra-thick coating, free form, and close 
web shape substrates. Normal defensive coating delivered by colder splash 
incorporates MCrAlY coats for higher temperature security and bonding 
coatings for warm obstructions, a copper-chrome layer for corrosion secu￾rity, and oxidation-resistant zinc and aluminum coating for gas and oil, cars, 
and others.
While CST is a capable solution to the deposition of practical additive manufacturing and 
surface coatings, depending on the application, there are still technological challenges and 
cost issues to address [44]. As CST is a line-of-sight method, spraying gun manipulation can 
be needed to coat components with complex geometries uniformly. Since the mechanical 
properties of substrate materials and feedstock powder have a direct effect on deposition 
performance, thick coatings can be challenging to obtain in certain situations. Cold spray 
coatings have an intrinsically rough surface, which necessitates a post-deposition polishing 
phase for many applications. Cold spray coatings could have reduced ductility due to their 
work-hardened nature. Post-deposition heat treatments are needed for near-net form man￾ufacturing to obtain the necessary mechanical properties. The high gas usage levels and the 
feedstock powder are the main cost drivers in CST. However, nitrogen is a widely studied pro￾pellant gas for cold spraying and is very cost effective. Regardless of the gas used, gas recycling 
technologies, powder recovery systems, and improved nozzle designs used to achieve higher 
particle velocities will dramatically increase the cold spray process’s economic viability [45].
38.7 Conclusion
Cold spring strategies shall be utilized because they are financially beneficial. and effective in 
the direction of a coat with a capacity to deliver wide, immaculate, and thick coats with well￾reinforced stores. The method has the ability to detain the remanufacturing and fix showcase 
to side the advancement of a modern coating. It is having conceivable outcomes and inves￾tigates after taking the challenge to create one of the cheaper, quicker, and more enhanced 
forms differed to other strategies accessible within advertising. After taking the challenges 
required to be tended as a prospect to investigate unused material, it exceedingly created fab￾ric (strength/tall hardness), explored advanced statement rate by parametrics optimized for 
different bland material, recovered the electrical conductivity as well as the warm conductiv￾ity of the coating, has an enormous scope on recycling feedstock fabric as well as prepared 
gases, and explores a combination on profoundly disparate material, avoiding softening with 
hardening by removing undesirable phases and thermally induced stress, ignoring oxidation 
(depositing metal in ambient air), and maintaining required chemistry and phases.Critical Review of Cold Spraying Coating Techniques 495

Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites possess high strength and become accessible 
materials to be utilized in the automotive and aerospace industries due to their unique and supe￾rior mechanical properties like high strength-to-weight ratios and stiffness-to-weight ratios. In all the 
machining operations, the most commonly performed process is drilling. Delamination is a signif￾icant disadvantage while drilling composites. Therefore, this work aims to present an experimental 
study of drilling behaviour that describes the effect of drilling process parameters such as feed rate 
and spindle speed on delamination by using a statistical approach called the Design of Experiments 
(DOE). This technique minimizes the number of tests required during manufacturing and maximizes 
the amount of account information. CFRP material “FMS 2275_Type1_Class1” is used for the exper￾iment by a Taguchi L16 orthogonal array. There are three types of drillbit materials that were selected: 
“HSS Drill, Kevlar Drill, and Polycrystalline Diamond Drill (PCD).” After the experimental study, the 
most effective drillbit PCD is used and the effect of drilling process parameters on delamination was 
studied further. The C-scan technique analyzes the delamination around the hole of the CFRP panel. 
The results obtained from these experiments show that at high spindle speed and lower feed rate, heat 
generation due to friction effect between cutting edges and the work material causes softening of the 
composite matrix, which results in inferior surface finish but lowers the delamination.
Keywords: Drilling, DOE, ANOVA, CFRP, delamination factor, C-scan techniques
39.1 Introduction
Composite materials are becoming more popular in the aerospace, automotive, naval, and 
space industries. Composite materials are known for their excellent combination of high 
structural stiffness and low weight. Since composite materials possess higher stiffness-to￾weight ratio and strength-to-weight ratios than isotropic materials, they are becoming more 
popular. Composites consist of laminate stacking with layers of different fiber orientation 
*Corresponding author: smp.prod@coep.ac.in500 Optimization of Industrial Systems
such as 0°, ±45°, and 90°, which helps to build an optimized composite laminate structure 
with different ply orientation for better results. 
Nevertheless, the cutting tool action during the composite machining process may dam￾age the work material’s surface. In the assembly of the structures, drilling is generally the 
final operation to be performed. Any manufacturing non-conformities that lead to rejec￾tion of the parts cause a tremendous loss in manufacturing costs and several working hours 
for the manufacturing process. In particular, Aircraft Industry drilling associated defects 
account for almost 40% to 60% of all parts rejection during the final assembly of an aircraft. 
Delamination is one of the primary defects that occurs and is observed after machining 
operations like the drilling of composite materials. Stress concentration, delamination, and 
cracking due to fatigue significantly reduces composite structural performance.
Wang X et al. (2004-2005) conducted a lot of research and experimental investigations 
to determine the effects of input parameters of the drilling process like as spindle speed, 
feed rate, and drillbit material geometry on output parameters like delamination around 
the hole, thrust forces, and the surface roughness factor. In the aircraft industry, it was 
reported that the rejection of parts consists of composite laminates due to drilling-induced 
delamination damages during the final assembly was as high as 60% (Wong T. L et al. 1982). 
Grinding drilling is used to overcome delamination in drilling (Park KY et al. 1995). H. 
Hochenga and C.C. Tsao (2006) studied the effects of special drillbits on the delamination 
of composite materials. They found that the core drill was able to withstand the highest feed 
rate with reduced delamination. In general, it is observed from the literature review that 
twist drillbits made of HSS or carbides are the principal or first choice in drilling composite 
laminates among various drillbits. Moreover, the applications of other drillbits in drilling 
of composite laminates are also pervasive to improve the machinability of composite lami￾nates. Most investigators found that using drillbits with different geometry and materials in 
drilling of composite laminates gave more advantages and benefits.
Several techniques are used by researchers to measure the delamination damage around 
the hole due to drilling. König W et al. and Tagliaferri V et al. found some of them. Chen 
W C and De Albuquerque VHC et al. used different methods like X-ray, an optical micro￾graph was used by Davim JP et al., an ultrasonic C-scan is used by Sao CC et al. and Durão 
LMP et al., a digital image/photograph was used by Hocheng H et al. and Piquet R et al., 
acoustic emission was used by Cai XJ, et al., and a laser-based imaging technique was used 
by Rojas-Oviedo R et al. to measure the details of delamination in terms of its area, shape, 
and orientation on the laminate.
The present study aims to conduct a drilling experiment on CFRP composite using the 
optimized drillbit material Poly Crystalline Drillbit (PCD) and evaluate the delamination 
around the hole using the C-scan technique. In practical CFRP machining, it is essential 
to determine the optimal machining parameters to achieve lower delamination and greater 
surface roughness. To achieve high quality in the machining processes, optimization of the 
process parameters is the critical factor. This paper also presents the variation in values of 
the delamination factor compared at different spindle speeds and feed rates at various tool 
point angles. The drilling process parameters were determined by using Taguchi’s exper￾imental design method. The L16 Orthogonal array of Taguchi, the signal-to-noise (S/N) 
ratio, the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression analyses are utilized to find the 
optimal levels and analyze the effect of the drilling process parameters on delamination 
around the hole and surface roughness. A confirmation test performed with optimal levels Experimental Study of Influence of Drilling Parameters 501
of machining parameters was carried out to illustrate the Taguchi optimization method’s 
effectiveness.
39.2 Materials and Methods
39.2.1 Materials
Aircraft composite laminate CFRP of thickness 4.896mm consisting of 24 layers with ply 
orientation (0/+45/-45/90) has been used as a work-piece material. The information related 
to the same is given in Table 39.1. The drills used for the experiment, namely, HSS Twist 
drill, Kevlar drill made of Carbide steel, and Polycrystalline Diamond Drill (PCD) of 10 
mm diameter are shown in Figure 39.1. The optimized tool identified as the PCD tool indi￾cates the minimum delamination factor among all three tools and was used for further 
detailed experiments. The machine tool is a MAKINO S 56 CNC vertical milling machine 
with a maximum speed of 3000 rpm. The research is carried out by varying spindle speeds 
from 1000-2500 rpm in steps of 500rpm and with feed rates from 100-400 mm/min in 
levels of 100mm/min. Damage around the hole is captured using the C-Scan technique by 
measuring the area of the damage and maximum diameter around the hole. To obtain a 
good quality image, parameters of noise suppression, brightness intensity, edge detection, 
and image enhancement are adopted. A histogram of array values of the delaminated zone 
was compared with that of a safe area to set the threshold value for the binary conversion of 
the images. The schematics of the experimental set-up are shown in Figure 39.2.

39.2.2 Design of Experiments
DOE is an essential tool for designing products and its processes. DOE methodology is used 
for quantitatively identifying the right inputs and parameter levels for making high-quality 
products or services. The main aim of performing proper design of experiments (DOE) is 
to perform more accurate, less costly, and more efficient operations. The number of tests 
required can be minimized by a Taguchi experimental design method, which is a power￾ful tool for designing a high-quality system that was developed by Taguchi. The Taguchi 
method uses a unique design with orthogonal arrays that incorporate the entire parameter 
space with a small number of experiments. In this study, two machining parameters were 
used as control factors and each parameter was designed to have four levels, denoted as 1, 2, 
3, and 4 (Table 39.2). Each experiment was repeated 2-3 times for getting reliable data. The 
averages of these tests were taken for determining the delamination factor. The experimen￾tal design was according to an L16 array based on the Taguchi methodology shown in Table 
39.3. With the help of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the effect of input parameters on the 
delamination factor is studied. Minitab software was used for Taguchi analysis.

39.2.3 Delamination Assessment 
39.2.3.1 Delamination Factor (Fd
)
The delamination factor is defined as the ratio of maximum delaminated diameter (Dmax) 
to the hole nominal diameter (Do) by Chen WC (1997). As shown in Figure 39.3, De is the 
equivalent diameter, Dmax is the maximum diameter created due to delamination around the 
hole and Do the hole or drill diameter. Also, the ratio of the delaminated area to the drilled 
hole area has been used to determine the extent of delamination.
39.2.3.2 Adjusted Delamination Factor (Fda)
The conventional delamination factor (Fd) accounts for only the size of delamination and 
the area of the delamination damage is not included in the calculation. Hence, another 
delamination factor was named as the adjusted delamination factor (Fda) which is calcu￾lated by
−
− F =F +A (F F )
A A da d
d d
2
d
max 0
The main advantage of this measure is that it incorporates the area of damage. It there￾fore distinguishes the severity of delamination in cases with different damage areas where 
the Dmax is identical. The Fda is a better measurement of delamination damage than Fd. 
39.2.3.3 Equivalent Delamination Factor (Fed)
Another factor has been proposed for the delamination damage, namely the equivalent 
delamination factor (Fed) calculated by using equation

39.3 Results and Discussions
Drilling experiments are conducted to evaluate the effect of cutting parameters on the work￾piece by optimizing tool bit material. The defect around the drilled hole was measured by the 
C-Scan technique for each drill material. Dmax around the damage hole is measured and 
the delamination factor is obtained. In the Taguchi analysis, the signal to noise ratio (S/N) is 
the measure of quality parameter and deviation from the desired value. By applying the equa￾tion 39.1, the S/N values for each experiment of L16 were calculated and tabulated in Table 
39.6. The signal-to-noise ratios were calculated using the condition smaller is better. Fd is the 
measured delamination, F1 is the ideal delamination = 1, and n is the number of trials.

Table 39.6 indicates that delamination increases with the feed rate and decreases with the 
spindle speed for all the drilling tools analyzed in this experimentation. Results obtained 
from the S/N ratio indicate that the optimal cutting parameters for the delamination 
were obtained with the feed rate at Level 1 (100mm/min) and the cutting speed at Level 
4 (2500rpm) for all the three tools, where S/N values are high. The effects of drilling input 
parameters such as feed rate and spindle speed on the delamination factor and interaction 
plots are shown in Figure 39.4 and Figure 39.5 and Table 39.4 and Table 39.5 describe the 
response table for means and the ANOVA of the input parameters, respectively.
From Table 39.5, the delta values for feed rate are more compared to the delta values of 
spindle speed for the HSS Twist Drill and Kevlar Drill, but higher for the PCD tool. The rank 
of the feed rate is 1 and that of spindle speed is 2 for all the three analyzed tools. Thus, from 
Table 39.5 F values are more significant. It is clear that feed rate affects the delamination fac￾tor more than spindle speed for all three tools (HSS Drill, Kevlar Drill, and PCD drill). Thus, 
from the level 4 experiments it is clear that the optimized value or the least delamination 
factor input parameters are at a feed rate of 100 mm/min and spindle speed of 2500 rpm. The 
drilling parameter feed rate has more influence on delamination than spindle speed.

39.3.1 Prediction for Optimized Value and Confirmation Test
Optimized value prediction and confirmation tests can be obtained from S/N analysis and 
mean response characteristics. The optimum levels of delamination factors were calculated 
as Level 2 (A2) for feed rate and Level 4 (B4) for spindle speed. Hence, the predicted mean 
of delamination factor is calculated using the equation given below by Nilrudra Mandal, B 
et al. (2011)

y is the average of delamination factor corresponding to all 16 readings (delam￾ination factor) in Table 39.6.

 are the average values of the delamination factor with input parame￾ters at their respective optimal levels and Fd opt indicates the predicted mean

39.3.2 Comparison between Effect of Use of HSS Drill, Carbide Drill, 
and PCD Drill on Delamination
The tools used for drilling in the present experiments are an HSS drill of point angle 
90°, Kevlar Carbide drill, and PCD drill. The experiment results state that the HSS drill 
had a substantial value of the delamination factor compared to Kevlar and PCD drills. 
The higher delamination value is because the delamination tendency increased with the 
point angle. A Kevlar Drillbit is specially designed for drilling of CFRP composites and 
its geometry includes two flutes with a point angle from the center, which acts as pre￾drilling, and this results in reducing the thrust force, reducing delamination. For a PCD 
drill used with three flank angles which grind three side surface results in a great hole and 
positioning accuracy, it is observed from Figure 39.6 and Figure 39.7 that delamination 
is increasing with feed rate and decreasing with spindle speed. There is a considerable 
variation at intermediate and high feed rates. Tool geometry and the material affect the 
delamination at lower spindle speeds and higher feed rates. It is interesting to note that 
at lower feed rates (level 1) and very high spindle speeds (level 4), all three tools shows 
almost similar patterns irrespective of their material and geometry. It implies that too 
low feed rate and too high spindle speeds are also not preferable to reduce delamination, 
but very high spindle speeds in the order of ten thousand rpm will reduce the delamina￾tion as mentioned by Campos Rubio J et al. (2008). This is maybe due to the severe heat 
generated because of friction between the tool and work, which may ultimately make the 
reinforced matrix weak and makes drilling much more comfortable. Hence, the thrust 
force is at minimum, causing lower delamination.

39.4 Conclusion
This paper has presented an application of the Taguchi method for the delamination study 
of drilling of CFRP composites. The conclusions of this present study are:
The experimental study and analysis are carried out by using Taguchi’s orthogonal L16 
array and analysis of variance. The level of the best cutting parameters on the drilling 
induced delamination is determined by ANOVA. The best suitable tool for aerospace com￾posites observed is a PCD drill tool which has a low delamination factor.
Drilling induced delamination decreases with spindle speed (1000rpm-2500rpm) and 
increases with feed rate (100mm/min to 400mm/min).
The results of ANOVA state that the feed rate is the main cutting parameter as it has 
a more significant influence on the delamination factor than spindle speed. The highest 
value of delamination factor is observed at the combination of low spindle speed (1000 
rpm) and high feed rate (400 mm/min) and the lowest value of delamination factor is 
found at the combination of high spindle speed (2500 rpm) and low feed rate (100mm/
min).
Extended work carried out from above results, with the help of the most efficient PCD 
drill is identified. The drilling trials are carried out with a 3mm, 6mm, and 10mm drill 
hole diameter to check cutting parameters effect on the damage. The damage area around 
the hole is scanned and evaluated with C-scan techniques and the values of maximum 
delamination diameter and area of delaminated zone, conventional delamination factor 
(Fd), adjusted delamination factor (Fda), and effective delamination factor (Fed) are cal￾culated. The minimum among all three above delamination factors were considered for 
analysis.

39.4.1 Experimental Results for 3mm Diameter
The responses will be studied for delamination factor (Fd) and surface roughness in CFRP 
laminate around the hole. Below, Figure 39.8 indicates the experimental results and regres￾sion analysis for responses to identify the most significant factors.
From the above experimental study, it is observed that the most significant input drilling 
parameters are speed (RPM) and feed rate (mm/min) and tool point angle has a less sig￾nificant effect on output parameters like surface roughness and delamination factor. Below, 
Figure 39.9 shows the interaction plots for surface roughness (Rs) and delamination factor 
(Fd).
Below, Figure 39.10 shows the correlation between the surface roughness with feed rates 
at various spindle speeds. Figure 39.11 and Figure 39.12 show the correlation between 
delamination factor values at different spindle speeds and feed rates.
From the above experiments it can be summarized that from all delamination models 
the conventional delamination factor (Fd) has the lowest factor of 1.03 at high spindle speed 
(2500 rpm) and feed rate (100 mm/min) and surface roughness (Ra) is 0.22 at high spindle 
speed (2500 rpm) and high feed rate (400 mm/min). 
In general, the values recorded for surface finish were better because of the plastic defor￾mation observed on the surface (burnish effect) which was produced by the rubbing action 
of the drill on the sides of the drilled hole. Both the factors, adjusted delamination factor 
(Fda) and equivalent delamination factor (Fed), gradually decrease with increasing spindle 
speed and an increase with the increasing feed rate. 
At the combination of highest feed rate and highest spindle speed, the values of these 
factors are high. The reason for this trend for both the factors may be that the heat gener￾ated in the drilling area at high spindle speeds and high feed rates causes softening of the 
matrix and fibre, which may make fibre cutting difficult at the cutting edges of the tool, 
The responses will be study of
delamination factor (Fd) and
Surface Roughness in CFRP
laminate and around the hole.

causing more areas to be damaged in the vicinity of the hole. These result in lower values 
for the conventional delamination factor compared to the adjusted delamination factor and 
equivalent delamination factor.
Similar experiments were carried out for hole diameters of 6 mm and 10 mm and found 
the same conclusion. Results are shown in Figures 39.13 to 39.22.

Abstract 
Robots are being used as a material handling system and they form a vital part of a flexible manufac￾turing system. Robots are very useful for work requiring high accuracy and repeatability. Articulated 
robots can be as straightforward as a two axis structure or complex with at least ten axes and are 
typically powered by servo motors. Most industrial robots have four to six axes, with six axes being 
the most well-known. The aim of this study is to maximize the machine utilization by increas￾ing machine flexibility to increase the level of automation/flexibility. This will ultimately result in 
reduced operation costs. The programs have been developed for transferring parts to the conveyor, 
pick-place, and stacking operation for the Aristo 6 Axis Robot using teach mode programming. An 
optimized robotic movement has also been selected. namely linear point to point movement, spline 
point to point movement, and corresponding point to point joint movement by observing the possi￾ble drawbacks of each mode and subsequently possible effects on the total operational time. Finally, 
the effect of using the ARISTO Robot for the stacking purpose instead of the operator will be studied 
by developing the simulation models for both cases on the ARENA simulation software.
Keywords: Automation, flexibility, robot, stacking, teach mode programming, 
ARENA simulation software
40.1 Introduction
A robot is a programmable, multifunctional controller intended to move materials, parts, 
tools, or special devices through programmed movement for performing an assignment or 
task. They are mainly used to perform tasks that are dangerous, repetitive, and require high 
precision or high speed. Articulated robots are the most widely recognized robot type uti￾lized in industrial settings as they provide excellent mechanical flexibility and can operate 
at high speeds for different tasks. A robot manipulator consists of two parts: a body and 
arm section and wrist assembly. They use grippers and tool holding devices as end effectors. 
Grippers are used for material handling, packaging, assembling, etc. while tool holding 
devices are required for performing various tasks such as spot welding, arc welding, drill￾ing, grinding, cutting, spray painting, and many more.

There are four coordinate systems with which robots are classified: Cartesian Coordinates, 
Cylindrical Coordinates, Spherical Coordinates, and Revolute/Articulated Coordinates. 
Cartesian Coordinate Robots have three linear movements, namely in the X, Y, and Z direc￾tion with a body-arm notation. LOO: (Linear-Orthogonal-Orthogonal) and robots’ end effec￾tors trace out a rectangular volume in a 3D space. Cylindrical coordinate robots undergo a 
radial movement, movement along direction, and a rotation about the Z axis. It has a body￾arm notation of TLO (Twist-Linear-Orthogonal) and traces out concentric cylinders in a 3D 
space. Spherical Coordinate Robots have two rotational and one translational movement with 
a body-arm notation of TRL (Twist-Rotational-Linear) and traces out concentric spheres in 
a 3D space. Articulated Coordinate Robots consist of a twisting base and two rotational axes 
resembling a human arm and has a body-arm notation of TRR (Twist-Rotational- Rotational). 
In view of above coordinates system, MTAB ARISTO Robots Programming uses two 
coordinate systems: World Coordinate System (WCS) and Axial Coordinate System (ACS). 
WCS contains three axes, X, Y, and Z, perpendicular to each other with the origin at the 
centre of the base and W, P, and R denoting rotation with respect to each axis. Its coordinates 
are denoted as P(X, Y, Z, W, P, R). In ACS, each robotic axis can be moved particularly in 
positive or negative sense rotation. Its coordinates are denoted as P(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6). 
Its complete notation for body-arm and wrist is denoted by TRR: RRT. Figure 40.1 shows the 
WCS and ACS axes on an articulated robotic arm. For ACS, the figure shows three axes, i.e., 
X, Y, and Z while for the WCS, it shows axes rotation for coordinates A1, A2, ...A6.
40.2 Research Background
A large number of literatures are available in different aspects of robots, more specifically artic￾ulated robots. Shah et al. [1] have summarized the different basic coordinate systems for robots 
and some specific coordinate systems used in industrial robots. Pachaiyappan et al. [2] have 
performed design and analysis of a generic articulated robot arm for various industrial appli￾cations, namely in traversing and performing manipulation in nuclear reactor facilities. They 
have also defined some technical robot terms such as speed, load bearing capacity, accuracy, 
repeatability, work envelope, and work cells. Singh et al. [3] have discussed the evolution of 
industrial robots and their applications and briefly describe robot technology, going into more 
depth about where robots are used and have also given a chronology of robotics technology. 
Chitte et al. [4] have performed static and vibrational analysis with the help of ANSYS software 
to decide which material we should use and how much load the robot will bear. Padhy [5] 
Figure 40.1 WCS and ACS axes on articulated robotic arm.Programming of 6 Axis Articulated Robot for Industrial Applications 521
has developed an industrial robot program using the teach pendant connected to the robot 
controller for automatic palletizing using a six-axis industrial robot which will provide more 
flexibility and results in space reduction to perform the operation. Albu-Schaffer et al. [6] 
have presented a new generation of torque-controlled lightweight robots (LWR) developed 
at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. In order to 
act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features 
and control/software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as a 
load-to-weight ratio of 1:1, torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive 
collision detection, as well as compliant control on joint and Cartesian levels. Albu-Schaffer 
et al. [7] have also studied and worked on a new method of Human Robot Interaction that is 
programmed by touch. In this paper, they have presented how an unskilled user can intuitively 
teach the lightweight robot at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Weßling, Germany, just by 
touching the arm. Programming by “touch” is very intuitive as they take the robot by the hand 
and demonstrate the movements. Senapati M. [8] has presented a report for the experiments 
conducted on a five- axis articulated manipulator equipped with a vision camera in an eye-to￾hand configuration designed for performing the pick and place operations of the defected tiles 
in a systematic manner. Kinematic and dynamic analysis of the system are first carried-out and 
a scaled prototype is fabricated for testing various operating issues.
40.3 Specification Details of Robot 
The following table gives the details of the specifications which were relevant for this proj￾ect’s work as shown in Table 40.1. It has been taken from the User Manual of the Aristo 
Robot by MTAB Engineers Pvt. Ltd [9].
40.3.1 Types of Movement in Articulated Aristo Robot
Straight Point to Point (PTP) Movement: In Straight Point to Point (PTP) movement, the 
gripper moves from one point of operation to the other in a straight line motion. Basically, 
the robot itself adjusts its coordinates to keep the gripper moving in the straight path. Its 
main advantage is that it follows the shortest possible path between two points, which 
implies a short cycle time, but it has a major disadvantage of ambiguity; this means that a 
certain position can be achieved with a plurality of axial positions. This is a concern espe￾cially in jointed-arm robots. Figure 40.2 shows the straight point to point motion path for 
the gripper of an Aristo robot from position 1 to position 3.
Spline PTP Movement: In Spline PTP movement, the gripper moves from one point of 
operation to the other by following the relevant equation of a spline. Basically, the robot itself 
adjusts its coordinates to keep the gripper moving on the spline path. Its main advantage is that 
it follows the possible path between two points in a smooth manner, but it also has a major 
disadvantage of Ambiguity; this means that a certain position can be achieved with a plurality 
of axial positions. Also, the cycle time for the spline motion is greater than that of straight line 
motion as following a spline path is more complex for robots. Figure 40.3 shows the spline 
point to point motion path for the gripper of an Aristo robot from position 1 to position 3.
PTP Joint Movement: In this mode, the gripper does not proceed on a fixed path while 
moving from one point of activity to the next. The robot moves the gripper by modifying 522 Optimization of Industrial Systems
the joints (A1, A2, ...A6) in an optimized way. To avoid the robot stalling out, which occurs 
if at least one joint of robot arrives at its precise limits, this mode is the best mode. Aside 
from this, it follows the path between two points in a smooth manner in the minimum pos￾sible time. This mode additionally overcomes ambiguity which is present over two modes. 
There is a tradeoff between complexity of motion and path covered in moving the gripper. 
Figure 40.4 shows the movement of joints about 6 axes of an Aristo robot to move the grip￾per to the required position [10].

40.3.2 Problem Statement
We have a CIMS and FMS lab with a loop layout established in our department. The lab 
has several components, including ASRS, AGV, Robots, etc. There is a problem of different 
incoming products being fed on the transfer conveyor line. There is a need to stack similar 
products and to feed the stack back to the transfer conveyor for the AGV to pick-place it 
to the ASRS system. With the existing facility it was not possible to do the job in a cost 
effective manner. This could have been solved in two ways, i.e., either investing in a new 
facility/machine (not a feasible solution) or increasing the Machine Flexibility of the exist￾ing components of the FMS layout. So, the best bet to solve the problem was to increase 
the Machine Flexibility of the existing Articulated Aristo Robot. The Robot was previously

being used to pick-part from the transfer conveyor and places items on the CNC lathe and 
vice versa. To overcome the problem, a worktable was attached with the existing layout and 
programs were developed using the ARISTO Simulation software with a controller using a 
PC based PID control algorithm working in coordination with the articulated 6 axis robot.
40.4 Experimental Work
Robot programming methods are classified as physical setup programming (manual 
method), Teach Mode Programming (walkthrough method), and Teaching by Showing 
Programming (off-line programming) [11, 12]. Teach Mode Programs have been developed 
for different industrial applications using the ARISTO simulation software with a controller 
using a PC based PID control algorithm working in coordination with the articulated 6 axis 
robot. Further, the Teach Mode Programming option is used in the software to move the 
robot arm accordingly using three possible movements: Point to Point (PTP) movement, 
Spline PTP movement, and Corresponding PTP Joint movement. It is to be noted that 
the same program can be developed in the three ways that have been discussed above. In 
this study, three programs have been developed: loading job to transfer conveyor, picking￾placing of parts from one location to another, and stacking of parts. 
Figure 40.5 shows the layout used for performing the experiments. In our FMS and CIMS 
lab, we have a loop layout FMS system. In the experiment an Aristo Robot, transfer con￾veyor, Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), and a worktable are used. AGV is used to move 
parts from storage/ASRS to the transfer conveyor and the stacked parts from the worktable 
to the storage/ASRS. It moves on the fixed path for the AGV movement present in the loop 
layout of FMS. The robot picks parts from the conveyor and places them on the worktable 
and combines multiple parts to form stacks of parts. We can understand the experimental 
procedure or the possible use of this project work in industrial applications by assuming 
different coloured parts queued on the transfer conveyor initially, which are being stacked 
into parts of same coloured parts on the worktable.

40.6 Development of Arena Model For Layout
The effect of using an ARISTO Robot for a stacking purpose instead of the operator at the 
final station has been observed by developing a simulation model on Rockwell ARENA sim￾ulation software. ARENA simulation software is a widely used simulation tool for developing 
a simulation model of an industrial layout. This simulation software basically consists of two 
modelling object templates: modules and entities. It has been built around SIMAN block-ori￾ented language. By using Arena software, one can perform modelling and simulation in the 
factory layouts to improve the performance of the layout and to study the effect due to pro￾posed redesign strategies without actually performing the change to the FMS layout [13].
For developing the model for our study, we have used Create, Assign, Process, and 
Dispose modules (basic ARENA modules) and route and station modules (advanced 
ARENA modules). The create module has been used to create three parts according to the 
problem statement: red, blue, and yellow parts. The parts have been created using random 
(expo) distribution. The simulation has been run for a 24 hour duration and a replica￾tion factor having a value of 5. Next, the assign module is used to assign entity sequence 
and entity picture and also provide the operation time for each machine (given in Table 
40.2). The route module is used for defining the sequence of operations for each machine.

For our FMS layout, the part first goes to the Lathe station, milling station, transfer con￾veyor, and then to the stacking station. The station module is used for defining the machine 
name, action (selected as the seize delay release action), delay type, delay time unit, and 
the expression. Finally, the dispose module is used to dispose of the parts from the system. 
The parts are removed from the system for inspection and further shipped to the respective 
customers. The operation times used for the respective machines have been shown in Table 
40.2. By using the above discussed properties, simulation models have been developed for 
both the cases [14-16]. The developed ARENA simulation models and animations of the 
simulation have been shown in Figures 40.9 and 40.10.

40.7 Discussion on Simulation Results
The simulations have been performed for two cases: (1) Operator performing the stacking 
operation and (2) robot performing the stacking operation and the results have been pro￾vided in Table 40.3. For the case of the operator, the model has been run for a duration of 
24hrs, replication factor value of 5, and a part creation time of 45 min. This results in a sys￾tem output of 93 parts and an average system utilisation of 45.08%. Next, the same proce￾dure is applied for the case of a robot for stacking operation. This results in the same system 
output but at low system utilization. The reason for this is that the robot and the machines 
were being underutilized. This is because the operation time on machines is greater than 
that of an ARISTO Robot and due to this, there is an undersupply of parts at the robot for 
the stacking operation. To increase the average system utilization, the parts creation time is 
reduced because the robot can perform a larger number of stacking operations. By decreas￾ing the parts’ creation time, the machine utilisation of Station 1 and Station 2 increases and 
due to this the utilization of the ARISTO Robot also increases. 
The use of an ARISTO Robot for the stacking operation increases the system output 
from 93 parts to 129 parts (i.e., 38.71% increase in system output) and the average system 
utilization increases from 45.08% to 60.76% (i.e., 34.78 % increase in average system utili￾zation). This basically serves our purpose of automating the stacking of comparable parts by 
increasing the flexibility of components of FMS (in our case ARISTO Robot).
40.8 Conclusion
The existing FMS layout could not tackle the issue of automating the stacking of compara￾ble parts as discussed in the problem statement. This was unrealistic without increasing the 
flexibility of components of FMS. Keeping this in mind, necessary programs were devel￾oped using the ARISTO simulation software with a controller using a PC based PID control 
algorithm working in coordination with the robot. As expected, parts stacking was done by 
utilizing robot programming and without any further investment in the machines. From 
the three modes talked about in this chapter, the PTP joint movement was found to be the 
most optimal movement, keeping in view the operation time and advantages/disadvantages 
of each mode. Finally, the effect of using an ARISTO Robot for the stacking purpose instead 
of the operator at the final station has been observed by developing a simulation model on 
Rockwell ARENA simulation software. The simulation study concludes that the use of an

ARISTO robot for the stacking operation results in a 38.71% increase in the system output 
and 34.78 % increase in average system utilization. Therefore, automation of the stacking 
process by increasing the flexibility of components of FMS helps to increase system output 
and average system utilization.

Abstract 
The unique property of composite materials is better volume to weight ratio, owing to prominent 
material for components design. The applications of composite materials are not only limited to 
the automobile and aircraft industry, but are extended to domestic appliance and electronic devices 
also. However, some challenges occur in the machining of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) due 
to different phases of the material bonded together. In this study, Electric Discharge Machining has 
been used to evaluate the machining parameters on three different composition samples of Al6063, 
Flyash, and Al2
O3
. The optimization of input parameters has been carried out to minimize tool 
wear rate and maximize material removal rate for input process parameters using a TAGUCHI L9 
Orthogonal Array. The machining results indicate that MRR directly depends upon Pulse Current, 
hence it increases with an increase in pulse current for all the three samples.
Keywords: MMCs, EDM, MRR, TWR, Taguchi L9 Orthogonal Array
41.1 Introduction
Metal Matrix Composites play a very important role in the aircraft, aerospace, and automo￾bile industries due to their high specific strength and high temperature resistance ability, 
but the main hurdle in using MMCs is that MMCs are very difficult to machine by conven￾tional processes. There are many unconventional processes which have replaced conven￾tional machining processes to machine difficult to machine materials and shapes. Electric 
Discharge Machining is one of them. Nowadays, EDM is the first choice of researchers in 
manufacturing industries because it is very efficient to machine hard materials and intricate 
shape parts with accuracy. EDM requires chip removal from the surface of workpieces with￾out the contact of tools and workpieces. EDM is mainly affected by working temperature

and thermal conductivity [1]. The EDM method makes use of electrical sparks to erode the 
material from the surface of the workpiece. Therefore, there is zero mechanical stress or 
vibrations which hamper the performance of the machine [2].
The machinability of MMCs is the challenge for conventional machining processes due 
to reinforced ceramic hard particles presence, which deteriorates both the tool life and 
machined surface characteristics. The non-contact type of machining processes is most 
preferred to machine the Al MMCs. The machinability of MMCs having a 2124Al alloy 
reinforced with SiC whiskers in volume fraction of 15% and 25% was studied to understand 
machinability using electric discharge machining process. It has been reported that MRR is 
better with brass electrodes compared to copper electrodes and better surface was observed 
in copper electrode machined surfaces. The machining time and TWR were significantly 
high while machining 25% SiC/Al than that of 15% SiC/Al composite [3]. Statistical mod￾els of the EDMed SiC reinforced Al composite has shown SiC particles shield and protect 
the Al matrix from being vaporised, thus reducing the MRR, however pulse current is a 
significant process for MRR [4]. The crater size is high when compared with stainless steel, 
the discharge is more irregular due to SiC particles presents in the machining gap, and it 
shows better stability at high pulse current and short pulse on-time [5]. During the EDM 
drilling process, 6025 Al-SiC composite with brass electrode peak current shows positive 
influence on MRR and in the reverse polarity (electrode positive) both MRR and TWR 
will increase and it also shows improvement in surface characteristics [6]. A study says that 
while EDMing, a white layer was being formed on the machined surface and that very much 
affects the formation of cracks and also propagation of cracks [7]. The study on machining 
of aluminum-alumina MMC using alumina powder mixed in dielectric fluid at various 
weight proportions (powder mixed EDM process) shows improvement in MRR and surface 
roughness when compared to the conventional EDM process [8-9]. The study on Al-4Cu￾6Si with 10% SiC composites while EDMing and finds that MRR, TWR, and radial over cut 
increase significantly in a nonlinear pattern with pulse current [10]. While parameters opti￾mization in EDMing of WC-6% composite, MRR can be achieved better by rising sparking 
frequency and low TWR can be achieved by a combination of low pulse current with longer 
pulse on-time and better surface finish at low pulse current and shorter pulse on-time with 
higher gap voltage [11]. A study of Al 4032 reinforced with Zrb2
 and Tib2
 in various weight 
percentages shows that mechanical properties such as tensile, compressive, and hardness 
values increase due to the bonding of reinforced particles and EDMing of the same com￾posite show that pulse on-time has maximum effect on MRR and TWR while copper is as 
an electrode [12]. In another research of optimization of input machining parameters in 
machining of Al-4Cu-6Si alloy with 10 wt. % SiC composite, it was found that among all 
the input parameters, pulse current plays an important role and TWR and MRR increase 
significantly in a nonlinear fashion with an increase in current [13]. While in another study, 
researchers discuss the effect of EDM current, pulse on time and flushing pressure on MRR, 
TWR, and SR (surface roughness) on machining Aluminium MMC using a brass tool [14]. 
In a study on Aluminium MMC reinforced with SiC and B4C, optimization of EDM pro￾cess parameters was done and they found that TWR and surface roughness increase with 
pulse current [15].
In the current study, three different samples of varying percentage of matrix and rein￾forcement, developed in our previous research [16] are taken for machinability analysis. Process Optimization of EDM Parameters using TAGUCHI 535
For machining, EDM is used with a copper electrode. Optimization of input parameters is 
carried out by using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array experimental design.
41.2 Material Selection
In this study, three stir casted aluminum metal matrix composite samples are being 
used for drilling operation in an electric discharge machine. The MMCs were made in 
three different compositions. The weight percentage compositions of three samples are 
as follows:
Sample 1: 95% Al 6063 + 5% Al2
O3
Sample 2: 95% Al 6063+ 5% Flyash
Sample 3: 90% Al 6063+5% Al2
O3
+ 5% Flyash
For the machining process, EDM model-ZNC-25 was selected and a copper electrode 
was chosen as tool material. EDM grade-30 oil was chosen as dielectric fluid. Three stir 
casted MMCs are shown in Figure 41.1.
41.3 Machinability Analysis on MMCs using Electric Discharge 
Machining 
Machinability analysis has been studied to understand the behaviour of composites. Three 
samples of composite (95% Al 6063 + 5% Al2
O3
; 95% Al 6063+ 5% Flyash; 90% Al 6063+5% 
Al2
O3
+ 5% Flyash) material are prepared for the EDM process. Each developed sample is 
cut into nine small pieces of approximate dimension (12 x 6 x 4 mm) using a power saw and 
shaper to hold the workpiece properly. The EDM on which the work is being performed is 
shown in Figure 41.2.
A ZNC-25 Electric Discharge Machine is used for machining the developed composite 
with the copper electrode. Pulse current, pulse on-time, off-time, and flushing pressure 
are considered as input parameters (level shown in Table 41.1) and Material Removal Rate 
(MRR) and Tool Wear Rate (TWR) as process responses. Machining has been carried out 
for a blind hole of depth 5mm for all samples. Machining time and the initial and final 
weight of workpiece and electrode has been recorded. The MRR and TWR have been cal￾culated using Equations 41.1 and 41.2, respectively.

41.4 Analysis of Process Parameters
The experiments were designed by Taguchi’s L9 standard orthogonal array. For each level, 
experiments were repeated thrice for accuracy. To determine an optimal set of process 
parameters for MRR and TWR, the Signal to Noise Ratio was evaluated using logarithmic 
transformation of the loss function from Equations 41.3 and 41.4. The value of signal to 
noise ratio should be smaller for better results of TWR and larger for better results of MRR. 
The experimentation results of Taguchi OA L9 are tabulated in Tables 41.2, 41.3, and 41.4 
for different samples.

41.5 Results and Discussion
The experiment results of EDM machining on all three samples have been plotted to under￾stand the mean effect of current, Pulse on-time, Pulse off-time, and Flushing pressure on 
MRR and TWR. All developed MMCs are showing (Figure 41.5a) the same trend with 
respect to Pulse current, which means MRR is increasing with pulse current. Due to high 
potential difference with increasing current, material will remove rapidly. The MRR is better 
on composite (Sample 2) when compared to the other two composite samples which shows 
better machinability character. This phenomenon is due to absence of non-conductive Al2
O3 
in Sample 2 and this is also evidence on composite Sample 3. The tool wear rate increased 
with increase in pulse current up to 7A in all three samples (Figure 41.6b), then decreased 
in case of fly ash reinforced composite. This is due to the higher current the composite get￾ting melted and flushed out easily in absence of Al2
O3
, so minimum TWR is observed and 
the presence of Al2
O3 indicates increase in TWR due to hardness of composites.

The behaviour of developed samples are the same with respect to Pulse-on-time for 
composites (Sample 1) and (Sample 2) MRR is continuously decreasing with increasing 
Pulse-on-time, while MRR for composite Sample 3 is showing the opposite trend and it is 
continuously increasing with Pulse-on-time. The reason being, in Sample 1 and Sample 2 
only one ceramic material is present, but in Sample 3 two immiscible ceramics are present, 
hence the machinability will be better and material will erode easily from the workpiece. 
As far as TWR is concerned, it is following just the opposite trend for the Sample 2 and 
Sample 3 because the presence of Al2
O3
 in Sample 2 is making the material hard so TWR is 
decreasing from 100 µs to 200 µs and afterwards it is increasing rapidly up to 300 µs, but in 
case of composite Sample 1, the TWR is decreasing throughout the given range because of 
the presence of Al2
O3
.
The trend of MRR with Pulse-off-time is the same for Sample 1 and Sample 3. MRR is 
first of all increasing from 10 µs to 15 µs and afterwards it is decreasing from 15 µs to 20 µs, 
but in composite Sample 2 , MRR is continuously increasing from 10 µs to 20 µs. The effect 
of flushing pressure on MRR is same for all the three sample composites. The MRR is con￾tinuously decreasing with the increase in flushing pressure because with increasing flushing 
pressure a recast layer is forming on the surface of composite material, which is hindering 
the material to erode.
The behaviour for TWR with respect to Pulse-off-time is continuously increasing for 
Samples 1 and 2 due to the presence of only one ceramic material in the sample, while in 
Sample 3, it is increasing from 10 µs to 15 µs and after that it is decreasing from 15 µs to

20 µs because the presence of two ceramics is making the composite harder after a certain 
limit of Pulse-off-time.
The effect of flushing pressure on TWR is following the same trend for Sample 1 and 
3 and TWR in these two samples is increasing from 0.5 kg/cm2
 to 0.75 kg/cm2
, then it is 
rapidly decreasing from 0.75 kg/cm2
 to 1 kg/cm2
. While in the case of Sample 2, TWR is 
decreasing from 0.5 kg/cm2
 to 0.75 kg/cm2
 and after that it is increasing from 0.75 kg/cm2
 to 
1 kg/cm2
. TWR first increases with current from 5 µs to 7 µs and after that it decreases from 
7 µs to 9 µs. The reason may be that initially the material of the tool is eroded frequently 
and after some time a recast layer of slurry is being formed on the tool surface, for which 
7 µs to 9 µs current is not sufficient to remove the material from the tool surface, while it 
was observed that TWR continuously increases with current from 5 µs to 9 µs for Sample1.
The maximum value of MRR is obtained at Current 9A, Ton 100µs, Toff 20µs, and flushing 
pressure 0.5kg/cm2
 and minimum value of TWR is obtained at Current 5A, Ton 300µs,Toff 
10µs, and flushing pressure 1kg/cm2
. In Sample 2, the maximum value of MRR is obtained 
at Current 9A, Ton 100 µs, Toff 20 µs, and flushing pressure 0.5kg/cm2
 and minimum value 
of TWR is obtained at 5A, Ton 300µs,Toff 10µs, and flushing pressure 1kg/cm2
. The tool wear 
rate while machining fly ash reinforced composite is significantly low as compared with 
Al2
O3
 reinforced composites. For Sample 3, the maximum value of MRR is obtained at 
Current 9A, Ton 100 µs, Toff 15 µs, and flushing pressure 0.5kg/cm2 and minimum value of 
TWR is obtained at Current 5A, Ton 200 µs, Toff 10µs, and flushing pressure 1kg/cm2
.
41.6 Conclusion
Three samples of different composition were made using a stir casting method [16]. The 
value of MRR and TWR has been investigated using the Taguchi method and the following 
conclusions are made:
1. Among all the three samples, Sample 2 has a maximum value of material 
removal rate for the given input parameters, which are Pulse current, Pulse

Abstract
Thermal conductivity has become a cardinal parameter for new technologies, especially in boilers, 
turbines, IC engines etc. In this article, a novel thermally sprayed composite layer coating is coated 
to solve the gordian knot of ineludible heat loss to enhance the competency of a system by decreasing 
the ability of thermal conductance. The function of Thermal Barrier Coating is to render the pre￾vention of heat loss at high temperatures. The microstructure is characterized in detail in this. This 
chapter reviews theoretical and experimental aspects of thermal conductivity in composite coatings 
coated by thermal spray technique. The measured thermal conductivity of a coating is 2.4W/mK 
and this paper also gives a review of the distinct materials selected for thermal barrier coating and 
the effect of coatings on thermal conductance ability according to various criteria and conditions. 
Thermal spray coating is a propitious innovation and contender for metal based thermal coating in 
steam pipes, heat pipes in fire tube boilers, IC engines, and other applications. 
Keywords: Thermal conductivity, TBC, thermal barrier coating, insulation
42.1 Introduction
In high temperature applications we need to prevent heat loss because as per the second law 
of thermodynamics, heat at higher temperatures is more effective. To enhance the efficiency 
of energy of vehicle engines, various aluminum alloys substituting steel components have 
been developed widely for reduction in weight in the last few decades. Surface protection 
is a big concern and needs to be implemented to some aluminum alloy components, such 
as piston crowns and cylinder liners. Among the various protective coatings, the thermal 
barrier coating is the most promising technology and it has allured much attention because 
of its thermal and wear properties studied by Yao et al. [1]. As per Li et al. [2], Thermal 
barrier coatings (TBCs) have been censorious in enhancing the proficiency of modern pro￾pulsion devices and gas turbines associated to energy production. The main function of 
TBCs is to proficient the hot components so that they can perform at higher temperatures 
than the limit temperature without loss of heat. With the help of a thermal barrier coating

of thickness 150-800 µm, the temperature at the entry to a turbine can be increased by 
100-300 oC. Dhomne et al. [3] pointed out that by using TBCs over vehicle components like 
pistons, the desired temperature inside the combustion chamber can be maintained with￾out heat loss. Due to this, reduction in heat loss occurs and it would be feasible to burn the 
un-burnt gases, which will lead to a reduction in polluted exhaust gases. The thermal bar￾rier coating is composed of a two layer a bond layer and top coat. The bond layer enhances 
coating adhesion between TBC and metal substrate (Dhomne et al.) [3]. 
For the steam turbines, the turbine blades experience elevated temperature due to vari￾ous issues like oxidation, thermo-mechanical fatigue, heat loss, and creep in blade surface, 
as presented by Meier et al. [25]. An applicable thickness of coating has to be applied over 
these blades in order to resolve these issues. Application of TBC will not only increase the 
effectiveness, but also reduce heat loss as well as develop the overall performance of the sys￾tem. In general, metals have good thermal conductors with respect to ceramics because of 
the presence of free electrons. An augmented density of scattering defects can be a possibly 
effective way to minimize the thermal conductivity of metals, which will ultimately decline 
heat loss (Yao et al.) [1].
42.2 Research Background
Thermal barrier coating is a trending topic in the field of research in this era of time and 
continuous research is being done on its tribological and thermal behavior. Our research 
also finds its basis in work done in the past and we have tried to add something from our 
side to this cardinal topic. Our coating of NiCrFeSi and its thermal study is a part of it. An 
8YSZ Coating fabricated by HVOF technology has a very low thermal conductivity of 0.86 
to 0.33 W/mK and due to this, it can provide excellent thermal protection (Zhou et al.) 
[4]. FeCrNbBSiC amorphous coating fabricated by induction plasma spraying (HVOF) is 
stable up to 900 kelvin and its thermal conductivity is 2.15W/mK, calculated by laser flash 
technique by Yao et al. [1]. Sm2
Zr2
O7 coating is sprayed by plasma technology found to 
have layered structure that yields low thermal conductivity (Zhao et al.) [5]. Zhang et al. 
[6] studied effects of TiO2
 on a Yb2
O3 stabilized zirconia oxide coating coated by Electron 
beam. Physical vapour porosity and ytteria content and claim that the thermal conductivity 
up to grain size 50nm is predominant by porosity and O2
 content (Raghavan et al.) [7]. As 
per Gao et al.[8], out of different microstructures hybrid lamellar, lamellar, and columnar 
structure, the columnar structure has the comparative least thermal conductivity of 1.15W/
mK. Rauf et al. [9] results as there is decrement in thermal conductivity of nanostructured 
coating because of the phonon scattering effect as there are increased nanopores. 
Thermal conductivity yields a higher value with degree of melting as high and also 
enhances the shock resistance. Therefore, there emerges a need to control the melting rate 
of particles (Song et al.) [10]. Jiang et al. [11] compared doped and undoped counterparts 
of La2
Zr2
O7 with similar porosity levels, then the thermal conductivity and temperature 
curve yields were flattened indicating that the phonon scattering levels were high. As per 
Yang et al.[12], the thermal conductivity of copper titanium or diamond composites coated 
by pulse plasma sintering and spark plasma sintering showed that as titanium and diamond 
content increases, the value of thermal conductivity initially increases, but if the levels of 
composite content are increased further, then it starts to decrease and the maximum value Study of Thermal Conductivity of NiCrFeSi Based Ceramic Composite Coating 547
of the thermal conductivity of this coating goes to 529W/mK at 0.2 percent titanium by 
weight. A layered thermal coating coated by electron beam physical vapour deposition 
leads to density changes parallel to the ceramic bond coat interface. Due these layered 
structures, both radiative and phonon transmission deteriorate efficiently (Nicolls et al.) 
[13]. Lanthanide Zirconates coating coated by spark plasma sintering technique yields that 
porosity of pyrochlores obtained by spark plasma sintering is lower in comparison to con￾ventional sintering (Fabrichnaya et al.) [14]. Kita et al. [15] investigated silica coating of an 
aluminum nitride board after sintering and yields density can be enhanced and porosity 
can be reduced by application of aluminum powder application on the coating. Kai et al. 
[17] studied how thermal conductivity of thermal barrier coating is affected by sintering 
and put up their conclusion as remarkable elevation in the value of thermal conductiv￾ity obtained after sintering and heat treatment application. Coating sintered is contributes 
greatly in thermal conductivity with respect to its counter, unsintered (Kai et al.) [17]. 
These are some of literatures that are reviewed and form the basis of our work. The 
domain of the work is great and it involves design to analyse the ranging parameters and 
the information of the parameters used is helpful to future engineers in order to craft their 
design for future purposes and can cause safety measure assurance even at allured condi￾tions. The insight idea about the paper can be obtained and the assurance of the field can be 
felt from the literature review and it helps new learners understand the topic easily so that 
the work of science of this topic can go beyond smoothly. 
42.3 Experimental Procedure
42.3.1 Substrate Material
In this study, stainless steel SS 304 has been taken as the substrate material for testing. 
This substrate material has many applications and is widely used in various sectors like 
Chemical industries, Pharmaceutical industries, heat exchangers in air conditioning refrig￾eration, etc.. The constituent element of substrate is shown in Table 42.1. The samples are 
of circular shape having dimensions of diameter 100mm and thickness 3mm, cut out from 
the steel sheets.

42.3.2 Formulation of Coating 
Thermal spray coating has been used for decades and is continuously being improved as 
technology and time evolve. They can be used for high temperature applications and at wear 
prone regions to avoid surface disruption (Pulsford et al.) [20]. The range of thickness of 
thermal spray coating is completely user based and ranges from some microns to some tens 
of millimetres. In our work, the ceramic coating of around 300µm thickness was deposited 
on SS 304 steel by thermal spray technology available with Delhi Technological University, 
Delhi (India). All the process parameters in consideration, such as spray distance, were 
kept constant during the complete coating process. The spraying parameters are given in 
Table 42.2. Thermal spray parameters have a deciding overhand that gives the coating its 
microstructure outlook for the study (Pasupuleti et al.) [19]. Thermal barrier coatings have 
an alternate as they can provide dimensional accuracy and also give improved tribological 
advantages and finishing on the applied surface (Mohan et al.) [21]. The microstructural 
study of coating is also required. In this work, we have done the same with an EDaX and 
Scanning Electron microscope (SEM).The characteristics have been explained in this work 
itself ahead.
42.3.3 Characterization of Coating
The microstructure of coating and the constituents present in the study are obtained by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Edax, as shown in Figures 42.1 and 42.2, respec￾tively. The Edax (Figure 42.1) of the coating powder gives the constituents present in the 
coating powder, as well as their weight percentage. The details of composition of NiCrFeSi 
are given in Table 42.3. The importance of the study of powder of the coating is deliberately 
needed to be done to understand the behaviour of the coating.
The SEM image (Figure 42.3) of the NiCrFeSi coating coated by thermal spray technique 
exhibits a mixed layer and globule type of characterisation. The SEM image shows that 
degree of melt of the particles is not uniformly a hetero arrangement and layerwise distri￾bution in the coating can be observed. Clearly, near to spherical coarse and fine pores which 
causes the air to be trapped, can be seen in the plane of coating. The coarser and finer holes

are responsible for the decrement of the value of thermal conductivity of coating (Shukla 
et al.) [22] as they inhibit thermal flux to flow due non-symmetrically in distribution and 
for entrapment of air in them.
42.4 Calculations
Thermal Conductivity 
Assuming longitudinal heat flow in a disc and neglecting radial and tangential heat flow 
by using Fourier law, Q = KA(dT/dx) can be simplified to Q = dT/R where R is resistance 
to heat flow and other symbols have their usual meaning. Convective and radiative heat 
losses are neglected. Thermal resistance for the composite is equal to the sum of thermal 
resistance of substrate and thermal resistance of coating. In order to calculate the value 
of thermal resistance of coating we used an electrical model that gives rate of electrical 
energy that is obtained by the product of instantaneous potential difference and current 
values are displayed on the setup. The requirement of temperature difference is fulfilled by 
measuring the temperature of top and bottom surface of the coating. To measure respec￾tive temperatures J type thermal censors are used. To measure the thermal resistance of 
substrate, R1
 is equal to L/KA, Length is 3mm, Area is 0.00785 m2
 and thermal conductiv￾ity is 16.3 W/mK [5], after calculation the value of resistance of substrate is 0.0237 K/W. 
After doing calculations for Q and dT by using Q = dT/R the value of Rcomposite is obtained 
to be 0.0431 K/W, therefore the value of Rcoating is equal to 0.010615 K/W, after obtaining 
the value of resistance the value of thermal conductivity of coating can be obtained as 
2.4 W/mK.

42.5 Discussion
The NiCrFeSi coating of 300 microns was obtained by thermal spray technique success￾fully at above discussed process parameters. EDaX provides the powder constituents as 
per weight percent Nickel(74.34%), Chromium(17.12%), Iron(5.21%), Silicon(3.3%). The 
surface morphologies of the NiCrFeSi coating consist of a pattern distributed with melted 
particles and globules of partially melted particles splattered as represented in Figure 42.3. 
The two types of voids can be seen in the SEM image. Fine voids are due to air trapped and 
coarse void are due to improper bonding in between coating particles. The preparation of 
stainless steel based amorphous coating provides the synergic effect of improved tribolog￾ical properties, corrosion resistance, and, most important for our point of view, thermal 
insulation, as studied by Wellman et al. [23, 24]. The thermal conductivity of the coating 
obtained is 2.4W/mK. The value of thermal conductivity is lower because of fine pores of 
coating being porous which makes heat flow inhibit and gives thermal insulation (Shukla 
et al.) [22]. The value of thermal conductivity of coating slightly fluctuates at the beginning 
and then increases with increase in temperature, as studied by Zhu et al. [16]. The applica￾tions in high temperature devices such as steam pipes and the tops of IC engine pistons can 
be found very useful with improved thermal resistance and durability of the device if coated 
thickness is more than critical thickness. 
42.6 Result
• NiCrFeSi powder coating was successfully deposited on ss-304 by thermal 
spray technique.
• In NiCrFeSi coating Nickel, Chromium, and Iron were the main constituents 
as per EDaX.
• Thickness of the coating is 300 microns and SEM Figure 42.3 shows fine 
pores which inhibit heat flow.
• The thermal conductivity of the coating is 2.4W/mK. The method used for 
calculation of thermal conductivity is 1-d steady heat flow.
• The behaviour of coating is insulating after thickness exceeds critical thick￾ness when coated on a spherical or cylindrical surface.
