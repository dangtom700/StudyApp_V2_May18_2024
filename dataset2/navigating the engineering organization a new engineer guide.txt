Navigating the Engineering 
Organization
Transitioning new engineers into professionals who can immediately blend in and 
contribute to the technical organization is, at best, doubtful. Trained in the “nuts and 
bolts” of a technical subject, new engineers have little to no training in the “soft” 
skills of how to work within an organization. This robust guide shows new engineers 
how to quickly operate and succeed within their new engineering organization.
Navigating the Engineering Organization: A New Engineer’s Guide focuses on 
the group behaviors of technical organizations. It provides a rigorous organizational 
framework to operate from and delivers guidance using a dual approach of academic 
insight and professional experience. Through numerous case studies, the book pres￾ents actual experiential guidance and offers a method on how to extend the insights 
covered in the book and turn them into a valuable personal model, valid through￾out the engineer’s career. It helps readers understand quickly the unique values and 
expectations within their new engineering organization and guides them in discov￾ering the proper ways to respond to these expectations. They can then act on these 
insights to deliver successful results, now and throughout their careers.
The approach and goals found in this book provide a building block to help all 
new engineers cross the “Great Divide” from student to professional and succeed in 
their new engineering organization.Navigating the Engineering

Foreword
Having taught undergraduate and graduate engineers for 35 years at the University of 
Michigan, I was always impressed by their high energy, general smarts, and unbri￾dled optimism that if they can think it, they can do it. When companies hire them, 
it is a bet on the future. Engineering graduates are a prized resource, and compa￾nies often treat them in a special way: paying well, offering interesting assignments, 
and even providing pathways to rapid promotion. View it as a honeymoon period. 
Unfortunately, all honeymoons end.
At some point, young engineers must carry their own weight and deal with the 
vagaries of organizations. Organizations are great at mobilizing resources toward 
big goals but also filled with infighting and strong personalities. Some of those peo￾ple will have a strong desire for control, and that could include the boss who wants 
to prove the young graduate is not as smart as they think.
Navigating through the good, bad, and ugly takes more than high grades in courses 
and enthusiasm. It takes savvy. By savvy I mean the ability to understand what is 
going on and overcome obstacles toward your goals. Ultimately this will come for 
some with experience, while others might struggle throughout their careers, com￾plaining to their family about the “politics.”
The book you have by Dr. Bob Santer is intended to accelerate the process of 
developing savvy. Bob became my Ph.D. student at a mature age after years of expe￾rience rising through the ranks of the Ford Motor Company. He was an aerospace 
engineer, a manager of engineers, someone who hired engineers, and ultimately was 
recognized as having a special ability to connect with people of various persuasions. 
That included people in advanced engineering, in different stages of product devel￾opment, and in production.
Ford had a problem. Some of their best ideas for new technologies were not get￾ting into vehicle design. They would ultimately get rejected in the product develop￾ment stage as too expensive or unnecessary. Bob was tasked with using his savvy to 
improve this process. In fact, his dissertation was about this very technology transfer 
process.
After Bob earned his Ph.D., I asked him to teach my popular course on Work 
Organizations, which was about organizational design and behavior. As I expected, 
he excelled and spent years helping students understand the human dynamics in the 
real world. He gave them a view of what to expect in the transition from student to 
professional. Ultimately that led to this book that is filled with practical advice but 
also draws on the best research by psychologists and sociologists about what makes 
organizations work.
You will learn about getting into a position to develop yourself, to connect with 
people with a wide variety of backgrounds, to work effectively in a team, and hope￾fully to ultimately become a leader developing future generations of people. The 
transition from doing the required work to becoming a leader is challenging and at xvi Foreword
the same time exhilarating. You will feel your power to positively influence people 
and society will grow. I envy you on your journey ahead.

Preface
Navigating the Engineering Organization stems from my own journey as a freshly 
graduated engineer into the complex and mysterious world of the large engineering 
organization.
My first professional position was as an aerospace engineer at a major U.S.-based 
aerospace firm, hired to help design the latest, next-generation navy fighter jet. A 
major “clean sheet of paper” project, I was excited and not a little prideful over my 
selection to be part of this leading-edge, high-technology aircraft program.
Arriving on my first day, my world instantly changed. Where was the private 
office I had seen in that eight-color brochure the recruiter had given me? Where were 
the clear-eyed, dynamic co-workers I was expecting to work with? Where was the 
smiling, fatherly boss with the time and interest to gently guide me on what I should 
do? And where was my arrival party, you know, the “we’re glad you’re here” gather￾ing? Instead, I found 1950s office furniture, a table in a large “bullpen” area with 
drawings and folders stacked high that was to become my desk, and a work group 
made up of middle-aged engineers who seemed to not know a new guy was starting 
that day. After a cursory round of introductions accompanied by my new supervisor 
(“welcome aboard” was the operative phrase), I was told to make myself a spot at the 
refuse table and “settle in.” Looking for a bucket to wash my new desk, I discovered 
I didn’t even know where the men’s room was.
I’m still trying to forget that day.
Thank goodness, times have changed. I’m certain your first day will be a pleas￾ant and enjoyable experience. But here’s the commonality between then and now. 
Coming in, I sincerely had no idea what was happening within the organization 
around me, and no one to help guide my way through. Every action I took seemed to 
result in alarming surprises and cringeworthy moments. And I believe most current 
graduates will have the same feelings.
I distinctly remember my first project meeting with a medium-sized group of 
engineers, financial people, manufacturing specialists, marketers, and other assorted 
business office representatives. Obviously, at that first meeting I didn’t speak; I just 
listened. The same with the second meeting, and the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. 
In fact, I didn’t speak up for literally months. Only when I realized the people talk￾ing didn’t really know as much as I thought they did was when I finally started to 
contribute.
By writing this book, I am wagering countless new engineers who have (or will) 
faced these same kinds of challenges, looking for some way to improve their chances 
of success while reducing the natural mistakes and missteps everyone experiences. 
Helping newly graduated engineers is the aim of this book, those who are looking 
for some way to improve their transition experience and quickly learn just what is 
going on in their new organizations. In short, helping new engineers progress from 
students to professionals is the goal.xviii Preface
As with many books, the material within is a result of my own professional 
journey of over 40 years. Added to these experiences are the corresponding organi￾zational theory and research concepts, providing a more complete picture of underly￾ing causes and effects. This means the points I share reflect my take on the common 
situations found in engineering and its management. This book is created through 
my “lens” and reflects the experiences I witnessed over time, those experiences that 
are as important today as they are in the recent past. To that end, please assume all 
persons and company names in this book are pseudonyms, except for my own per￾sonal experiences.
It’s important to note that not all the situations and advice, guidance and counsel 
in these pages will be totally relevant to you as an individual at all times. To say that 
not all people (or engineers) are the same is obvious. The points made here may only 
be applicable to you in certain instances or with certain people. That’s fine, and I 
depend on you to “take the best and leave the rest.”
Finally, you may become (at times) a bit uncomfortable with one or two points in 
this book. If this happens, that’s great news. This book is about change, and change 
can be inherently discomforting. Embrace the discomfort, and you’ll get the most 
out of this book.
Enough of the preliminaries: let’s begin.

Acknowledgments
Writing a book is a team sport. While the author’s name may appear on the front 
cover, an entire roster of players contribute to making the final product a win for 
everyone involved. I am fortunate to have many of these players.
First, I’d like to thank my Executive Editor at CRC Press, Cindy Carelli, and her 
Senior Editorial Assistants Erin Harris and Christina Graben. Without their faith in 
this project (and well-timed suggestions), Navigating would have been no more than 
an orphaned idea.
My thanks also go to Dr. Brian Denton and Tina Sroka of the University of Michigan 
College of Engineering’s Industrial and Operations Engineering Department. Their 
support in providing access to key research material was essential, and I am grateful 
for their help.
Interviews are a key part of any book of this type, and several contributors made 
a significant difference in the direction it took. Additionally, several individuals 
were gracious enough to read portions of Navigating and offer their sage advice. 
My thanks go to Peter Bejin, Bob Allan, Steve Santer, Chuck Nagy, Marcus Sprow, 
and Steve Karbownik. I also thank Katy Santer for reviewing and suggesting much￾needed improvements to the graphics and figures, and especially to Matt Karbownik 
for his special support at Schoolcraft College.
Nothing beats experience when searching for insights within any engineering 
organization. Among the many who contributed their encounters and learnings, Ed 
Krause deserves special attention.
Remarkables are individuals who have special talents and experiences that, over a 
career, make them unique and valuable contributors to any project such as this. I am 
fortunate to have three. Paul Mascarenas taught me an entire new set of skills when 
we worked together at the Ford Motor Company. Colonel Jack Lousma gave me a 
new perspective on professionalism and what really matters in his many years as a 
guest lecturer in my capstone course at the University of Michigan. And as the 74th 
Secretary of the United States Navy, Dr. Donald Winter not only contributed valu￾able insights into engineering leadership but also continuously asked me those dif￾ficult questions as he reviewed the book’s contents. I thank all three for their support.
Special thanks go to Professor Jeffrey K. Liker at the University of Michigan, 
who has continually given me his support and guidance throughout my doctorate and 
the writing of this book. I appreciate his understanding and insights during the long 
journey of bringing this book to light. His suggestions have always been helpful and 
unfailingly “spot on,” and this work has greatly benefited from his effort.
Another individual deserves special mention. I wish to thank Dr. G. Fredric 
Bolling for challenging me to think beyond my normal boundaries and sending me 
on this path in the early 1990s.
It’s no stretch to realize that without my family, this book would not have been 
possible. I want them to know that their kind words and encouragement have meant 
a lot to me. Special recognition goes to my mother, Mrs. Betty Santer, for her support xx Acknowledgments
and encouragement throughout. To my children Stephen, Steven, Nicholas, and 
Matthew, I extend my love and appreciation.
Most importantly, I want to thank my wife, Elizabeth, for her love, an endlessly 
giving nature and her continuous support as I sat at my desk and attempted to com￾plete this work. Without her amazing ability to care for both me and our family, and 
her willingness to take on so many added responsibilities, I know this day would not 
have come. She makes it very easy to love her. She is a very special person.xxi

1 Introduction
The Territory Ahead
1.1 ACROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE: THE NEED FOR CHANGE
The engineering organization is a mysterious place.
Full of surprises, unsolved riddles, and hidden forces, this territory is governed 
by invisible rules and unwritten expectations. And surrounding it is a Great Divide, a 
barrier separating it from the world of university studies. New engineering graduates 
entering this place could probably use some help, perhaps a good map to navigate its 
many paths and byways.
Fortunately, a new engineer does not need help with technical knowledge. Not 
with the calculus. Not with the statics and dynamics of non-linear mechanical sys￾tems. And certainly not with differential equations or C++ programming. I’m con￾fident you have those subjects down cold. But I’m willing to bet that you and your 
fellow graduates might need some insight into how to actually operate within a 
professional engineering or technical organization.
When it comes to entering your first engineering position, it may feel as if you’re 
standing on one side of that Great Divide, an intimidating mountain range prevent￾ing you from reaching the other side, that side representing the confidence, under￾standing and professional capability you wish for as a newly minted engineer. And 
the options on how to cross this Divide are limited.
Today, it’s fair to say your ability to quickly blend in and contribute to your new 
technical organization may be a bit precarious. New engineering hires who misinterpret, 
miscalculate, and misstep early in their first jobs can create a rough (and potentially 
short-lived) start to their careers. And, most importantly, there is little published informa￾tion to help engineers like yourself navigate this new and unknown territory.
But here’s some good news. This book aims to reduce the mistakes, blunders, confu￾sion, and catastrophes caused by organizational onboarding, allowing you to better focus 
on your immediate technical performance and contributions to your new firm.
This is a book about change and transformation. It is about preparing you to 
quickly transform from a university student into an effective and respected profes￾sional. Through this book, I hope to assist you in understanding your newfound 
profession differently than you might have before. In short, this book aims to provide 
you a robust guide on how to operate within your new engineering organization. It 
shares the universal underlying framework of engineering organizations. It provides 
an approach to navigate within this framework and the surrounding environment. 
It aims to help you create a personal model of how to work throughout your initial 
professional engineering career. And along the way, it provides an opportunity to

make sense of the many disparate pieces of the engineering organization. It gets you 
across that Great Divide.
Navigating the Engineering Organization provides missing knowledge and new 
insights into how you can become more effective during your early career. Most 
importantly, it provides support in solving the mystery of working within your new 
professional home.
As a reader of Navigating, I want you to benefit in four ways:
1) Quickly understand the unique values, expectations, and interrelationships 
present within your new (or future) engineering organization.
2) Help discover new insights into how to correctly respond to the unique 
organizational expectations of engineering.
3) Act on these insights to quickly deliver successful results to your manage￾ment, colleagues, and the all-important external customer.
4) Rapidly build your new management’s confidence in you, both through the 
results of your technical work and through your ability to deliver it within 
the expectations of your new professional home.
Together, we will do this by learning the fundamental engineering organiza￾tion model that all engineering firms use and then adding to it the common 
transition problems you will face and the ways to deal with them directly and 
successfully.
This book delivers the benefits I just mentioned through three principles:
1) First, it focuses exclusively on engineering and technical organizations, 
addressing their unique characteristics, culture, and working environment. 
Engineering organizations are unique and distinctive creatures that must be 
treated as such.
2) Next, it provides a rigorous framework for understanding the technical 
organization, the key to navigating the special factors in how engineering 
organizations work as opposed to general business firms.
3) Finally, it employs a “dual source” approach to providing guidance. One 
source provides the academic understandings and research results under￾pinning each topic being discussed. The other source modifies and enriches 
the theory through targeted real-world practice, culled from over four 
decades of engineering organizational experience from the author’s and 
colleagues’ careers in the technology sector.
To realize these benefits, Navigating is structured into four main parts:
Part One: Preparing for Change
Examines our currently held assumptions regarding how engineers should approach 
problems, what information we should use in their solution, and what is the validity 
of our methods and technical belief systems.Introduction 3
Part Two: Guiding the Way
A simple yet strong organizational framework from which to operate, no matter the 
technical product, service, or other activity needing to be done.
Part Three: Operating within the Inner Core
Guidance in working within the center of this organizational framework, where the 
real action takes place.
Part Four: Creating a Personal Roadmap
This fashions a complete, personal construct of how to work within your organiza￾tion, a foundation of understanding that can be used for the rest of your professional 
career.
A good question to ask is whether you believe this kind of insight is necessary or 
does a Great Divide even exist at all? Some graduates believe what engineering firms 
care about most are the new hire’s technical skills, and any organizational skills will 
be provided by the company’s “onboarding” process or are already in place through 
their university education.
This may be true, but the data say otherwise. Employers want college graduates 
with “soft skills,” such as being a good listener or talented at collaboration. A 2020 
survey by the American Society for Engineering Education found that the most in￾demand talents for all college students were listening skills (74%), attention to detail 
(70%), and effective communication (69%).1
Unfortunately, few college students feel confident they have these skills and 
knowledge to succeed in a workplace. A 2017 report from Gallup, a survey firm, and 
the Strada Education Network, an education social impact organization, provides a 
comprehensive assessment of student views on this topic.
The survey size was big: more than 32,500 students from 43 four-year public and 
private universities participated in the study. Only 34% of those students indicated 
they were confident that they would graduate with the expertise to succeed in the 
job market, and just 36% said they believed they had the skills and knowledge to be 
successful in their careers.
Similar results extend to engineering students specifically. According to the same 
study, some 59% of new engineering graduates say they feel unprepared having the 
professional skills (defined as project management, business proficiency, communi￾cations, teamwork, etc.) necessary to transition successfully.2
This is borne out in survey after survey over many years. And I’m wagering that 
at least some of you will need at least some guidance in some areas of your profes￾sional engineering life. That’s why it’s critical to read each chapter carefully and 
actively consider the points of view presented. This approach will maximize the 
benefit to you, which is the purpose of this book.
With our general purpose described, let’s now dispose of several small but impor￾tant matters.4 Navigating the Engineering Organization
1.2 DEFINING A COMMON LANGUAGE
Before we can begin a meaningful discussion about how to cross this Great Divide, 
we must first develop a common language with well-defined and commonly under￾stood terms. This is true not only for engineering organizations but for any other 
group activity, be it work, family, significant others, or any other person or group we 
wish to understand. And in a distressingly high number of cases, this doesn’t occur.
In this book, we will be using some special terms and phrases which have very 
specific meanings. Here’s a tip: you will soon find that the language and expressions 
commonly used in engineering organizations are alarmingly imprecise, contradic￾tory, and generally all over the place. So many terms have multiple meanings and 
definitions that getting our common language settled is essential before we can even 
begin to think about understanding an organization. We’ll define a few common 
terms now and introduce the rest as we progress through our work.
1.2.1 Management Ranks
We will spend a lot of time discussing “management,” not as an action but as a group 
of individuals who each day control your workplace and, therefore, you. We should 
have some common and consistent names for these people. Simply put:
The Engineer is you.
The Supervisor is the one individual you directly report to.
The Manager has the Supervisor reporting to them.
The Manager reports to the Director.
The Director reports to the Executive Director.
The Executive Director reports to the Vice President.
Anyone above the Vice President really doesn’t matter to us.
1.2.2 Organizations
We should also decide exactly what is an “organization.” As with most of the terms 
and concepts in this book, the definition of an organization is not written on a 
stone tablet somewhere. Instead, it is soft and fluid, changing depending upon the 
context or situation being experienced and who’s doing the defining. For example, 
ten minutes online will easily yield a dozen or more definitions of an organiza￾tion, and almost all are correct. For this book, we’ll choose our definition of an 
organization as:
An organization is a social entity that is goal oriented, designed as a deliberately struc￾tured and coordinated activity system and linked to the external environment.3
Note that this definition is a combination of multiple characteristics. An organization 
is a social entity. It is a goal-oriented, deliberately structured, and coordinated sys￾tem. And, critically, it is linked to an ever-changing external environment. It is made Introduction 5
up of people, attempting to achieve a goal, with attention given to the relationships 
between those people and how they communicate. And it is not isolated; it is part of 
a larger, dynamic communications network.
No matter the precise wording of the definition, an organization does three impor￾tant things. First, it designates formal reporting relationships, including the number 
of levels in its hierarchy and the span of control (i.e., the number of direct employ￾ees reporting to a particular superior). Second, it identifies the grouping together of 
individuals into departments and departments into a total organization. Finally, it 
includes the design of systems to ensure effective communication, coordination, and 
integration of effort across those departments.
For us, that’s probably a good enough description at this point.
1.2.3 Common Organizational Levels
Another set of terms that will be useful are definitions of the common levels of an 
organization’s hierarchy. Here, we will define three fundamental levels. Each level 
has a distinctly different breadth and depth of responsibility as well as its role within 
the enterprise.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the lowest level is operational, encompassing all workers 
like yourself, your colleagues, and your supervisor, who together perform the day￾to-day operations of the organization. These are specific tasks done by individuals

like yourself and very small groups. It easily encompasses the majority of the firm’s 
employees, perhaps 80% or more. This day-to-day, singular work fulfills very spe￾cific objectives. Good descriptors of operational work include repetitive, detailed, 
daily, weekly, short-term, reoccurring, individualistic, and, yes, sometimes tedious 
activity. It can also include small problems to be solved immediately and so on. All 
these and more define the world of operations.
The next level up is tactical. This middle level is populated by managers and direc￾tors whose job is to combine and coordinate individual efforts from the operational 
level. This is a middle ground of not very long-term or very short-term activity. This is 
where subsystems are born. Here, medium-impact decisions are made and executed, 
such as developing schedules for perhaps two to three years hence or planning for 
midterm hiring needs, or where new subsystems are designed. Not ten-year thinking 
nor one-year work, but perhaps focusing on projects in the two to four-year timeframe.
The top level is strategic, where combinations of tactical subsystems are brought 
together to support the strategic intent of the organization. As you would suspect, the 
strategic level defines the big picture, where long-term goals are set, encompassing 
a macro view of the business. This is where visionary thinking occurs. Planning for 
the future, identifying, and preparing for goals and visions of the five- to ten-year 
variety happen here. The most senior members of your engineering organization 
spend their time and energy primarily at this level.
1.2.4 Professionals, Identified
We will be using the word professional quite a bit, so it’s probably wise to take 
this moment to define the term. What is an engineering professional? Let’s con￾sider the U.S. engineering population. According to the U.S. National Academy of 
Engineering, there are three overlapping ways to define the engineering labor force:
1) By occupation: workers without an engineering degree who perform cer￾tain job duties that define an engineering occupation, i.e., an “engineering 
technician.”
2) By educational degree: Those with engineering degrees, implying that a 
person self-describes as an engineer throughout their career, regardless of 
their occupation or if any specific technical knowledge and skills associ￾ated with the degree they use on the job.
3) By application: a subset of the second category encompassing those who 
have an engineering degree and daily apply their technical and professional 
knowledge and skills acquired with that degree in their work.4
Let’s add a bit more confusion over these terms. In common usage throughout North 
America is the term professional engineer. As you already know, a professional 
engineer (or PE) is an engineer licensed by a governmental board of registration 
to practice engineering. The PE license is the engineering profession’s definitive 
standard of ability, competence, achievement, and quality of work. Only 18–25% of 
engineers obtain their PE certification at any one time.Introduction 7
On their face, none of these existing definitions alone will work so we’ll create 
our own. Let’s define an engineering professional a bit more broadly; as a combina￾tion of several of the statements above with several related characteristics:
An engineering professional refers to anyone who earns their living from performing 
engineering-related activity that requires a certain level of education, skill, or training 
plus appropriate experience. There is typically a required standard of competency, 
knowledge, or education that must be demonstrated, often in the form of a university 
degree or professional credential. In short, an engineering professional is correctly 
educated, experienced, ethically strong, trustworthy, and receives compensation for 
services rendered.
Note our definition means no professional engineering license is required, but the 
underlying characteristics of a PE are expected.
1.2.5  Engineering Disciplines
It may be obvious, but we still need to define the main engineering categories or 
disciplines applicable to this book. We’ll define seven different disciplines, based on 
their primary function as shown in Table 1.1.
That’s it, simple and straightforward. While there are many other definitions we 
will run across during our time together, this is a good start to getting our language 
straight and creating common understandings.
1.3 SOME BOUNDARIES AND GROUND RULES
At this point it’s important to discuss some fundamental boundaries and ground 
rules employed in this book. A boundary sets a limit on what we will consider 
in our discussions and what is out of scope. For instance, we will discuss many 
TABLE 1.1
Common Disciplines within Engineering
Engineering Discipline Definition
Research Pure investigation and creation of new inventions and enabling 
technologies
Development Application of invention and enabling technologies to convert invention 
into innovation through a transformation
Design Creation of a sellable product or service
Test Verification of the function, quality, and reliability of the product or service
Production Physical creation of the product or service, aka manufacturing
Construction Building of enabling facilities and hardware and software, normally 
physical objects but may include software
Operations Analysis and design of systems supporting all the above8 Navigating the Engineering Organization
cause-and-effect relationships that are common in organizations, but we will not 
develop any mathematical expressions defining those correlations.
A ground rule is a general process we will or will not follow when discussing a 
given topic. For example, I view this book as a pathway to learning, to attain knowl￾edge and insight in lieu of strictly checklist-style “training.” Training implies only 
“how” to do something, while knowledge implies understanding both the “how” and 
“why” of the subject. Thus, our ground rules follow a pathway to knowledge and 
insight as opposed to simple training.
Both boundaries and ground rules are important, as we need to focus our energies 
on the main themes and ideas and stay away from the many rabbit holes in organiza￾tional studies (and there are a lot). That’s what we’re after.
With that understanding, let’s look at some important boundaries and ground 
rules that underlie our discussions.
1.3.1  From “Great Man” Theory to Schools of Thought
Our first grounding principle has to do with the “schools of thought” approach to 
knowledge, as opposed to what is quaintly called the “Great Man” theory (with 
apologies to our female readers). The Great Man theory, by itself, can mess you up.
The Great Man, first described by Thomas Carlyle in 1840, is a common 
approach to education and training, especially in engineering and the sciences. 
Here, the educator selects a well-known individual as the single, end-all, and be￾all expert for a given subject. We all know the list. For general relativity it’s Albert 
Einstein; in anthropology it’s Margret Mead; for sociology and psychology it’s 
Malcolm Gladwell, and in evolutionary biology it’s Richard Dawkins. Of course, 
we can’t forget Stephen Hawking for theoretical physics. Closer to home, industrial 
engineering has Fredrick Taylor, the “Father of Industrial Engineering,” and so on. 
This is a convenient approach to learning; just follow their precepts and you’ll be 
fine. Unfortunately, this singular approach provides just a narrow fraction of what 
you might need to know, especially considering the importance of contingency 
theory (which we will discuss shortly). Because for every Edison there is a Tesla, 
for every Darwin there is an Owen, for every Alexander Graham Bell there is an 
Elisha Gray.5
That said, this theory isn’t dead. The Great Man idea has been around for centu￾ries before Carlyle. The idea survives and still influences all of us today.
In short, the Great Man theory is emotionally compelling. It is simple, easy to 
remember, and immensely comforting.
And extremely narrow, overly simplistic, slightly misogynistic, and totally inad￾equate when applied to engineering organizations.
The school of thought approach is the modern alternative to the Great Man. The 
idea is simple: there is no one single expert on any topic that contains any com￾plexity whatsoever. Truth, especially in complicated systems like organizations, is 
not contained in one single idea or person but is an amalgam of many viewpoints, 
understandings, and insights. Organizational truth is not derived from straight-line 
analysis but is uncovered as the result of a triangulation of insights, merely getting Introduction 9
us closer to reality but never fully attaining it. It is an approximation whose level of 
accuracy and precision is continuously improving but never definitive.
Currently, there are seven main Schools of Thought dealing with management 
theory. These schools have been created from fundamental assumptions and bound￾aries believed valid by their developers. These different approaches have been devel￾oped over time by specialists from a wide range of diverse yet related fields.
A summary of the principal schools of management thought can be found in 
Table 1.2.
6
In this book, we will use the Contingency School as our foundational approach, 
while enhancing and enriching it with a collection of well-known management think￾ers from psychology to sociology to anthropology, all contributing their thoughts to 
our discussion as appropriate. This is what we want: a holistic view of organizational 
knowledge today, drawn from many sources and points of the compass.
1.3.2 Which Approach: Scientific Management or Human Relations?
How an organization is managed is one of the critical factors of an engineering com￾pany’s success, no matter what product you make or technical service you supply. In an 
area as complex as running an organization, there are many, many ways to manage.
I want to share just two basic approaches to running technical businesses. These 
are the scientific management method and the human relations approach. All 
other management techniques and tools tend to be some flavor of these two basic 
approaches. Let’s take a minute to describe each one.
The earliest method of managing organizations was scientific management, a tech￾nique first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Following the (then) new 
and popular insights from the scientific revolution, proponents strictly applied scientific 
principles to emerging factory work. Here, systems were broken down into individual 
components; each was studied independently and then singularly optimized. Only after 
this optimizing task was completed was the system reassembled.
This method encompassed the main beliefs that:
1) Efficiency is everything. The greatest output per unit of input was the sin￾gular goal of the firm, in other words, maximum efficiency. Whether the 
product satisfied the marketplace need (i.e., effectiveness) was another mat￾ter entirely, leading to the possibility that the firm could produce the wrong 
product in a highly efficient manner.
2) Workers were seen as extensions of machines. Labor (i.e., humans) were 
perceived as expendable, replaceable parts to be popped in and out as the 
needs of the machine (the factory) demanded.
3) Maximum task breakdown, allowing for maximum simplicity of the task. 
Unfortunately, it also created “dumbing down” of work to produce mind￾numbing jobs. Thinking is left to management, which meant that “workers 
work while managers manage.”
4) The organization’s goals and objectives were the focus of all efforts, to the 
detriment of the workers.10 Navigating the Engineering Organization
TABLE 1.2
Principal Schools of Management Thought
School of 
Thought Definition Key Beliefs
Management 
Process 
School (aka 
Operations or 
Traditional 
School)
A process of getting things done through 
people operating in organized groups.
Process management principles are 
universally true and applicable in all 
situations.
Empirical 
School
Management is the study of experience 
and decision-making. By analyzing the 
experience of good or bad managers or 
engineers the most positive methods can 
be applied.
Managerial experiences can be taught 
to practitioners and engineers. 
Techniques used in successful cases 
can be directly applied by future 
managers. Theoretical research can be 
combined with practical experiences 
for better management.
Behavioral 
Science 
School
Improve the organization by 
understanding the psychological factors 
driving work behavior. Based on the 
reality that getting work done is through 
people, and thus management must be 
focused on interpersonal relations.
Heavily oriented toward psychology 
and sociology. Includes the study of 
human relations, the role of manager 
as a leader, and the study of group 
dynamics and interpersonal 
relationships. Stresses the people part 
of management and understanding.
Social Systems 
School
Very closely related to the behavioral 
science school. This approach to 
management is heavily sociological in 
nature. 
Sees management as a social system of 
cultural interrelationships, either as 
formal organizational relationships or 
various informal human relationships. 
Identical to the study of sociology.
Decision 
Theory
Concentrates on the selection of a 
suitable course of action from various 
possible alternatives. May deal with the 
decisions itself, with the person or 
organizational group making the 
decision or analysis of the decision 
process.
By expanding beyond evaluating 
alternatives, can apply theory to 
examine organizational structure, 
psychological and social reactions of 
individuals and groups and analysis of 
value considerations for goals and 
incentives.
Systems 
Approach
An integrated approach that considers 
management in its totality based on 
empirical data. The systems approach 
brings out the complexity of real-life 
management problems much more 
sharply than any of the other 
approaches.
Can be utilized by any other school of 
management thought.
According to this approach, attention 
must be paid to the overall enterprise. 
A system has several subsystems, 
parts, and subparts. All subsystems, 
parts, and subparts are mutually 
related to each other. A change in one 
part will impact most others. This 
approach emphasizes study of the 
interrelationships of subsystems rather 
than in isolation.
(Continued)Introduction 11
The belief in science underlying this method was appealing, as it was clean, simple, 
and for many years seen as the one and only correct management system. Yet while 
the scientific management method initially resulted in tremendous productivity 
gains, it also caused abuses to the human component of the system.
Please don’t think that today scientific management is a vestige of some ancient 
production system. It is stunning to see how widespread the strict scientific mindset 
exists today, especially within small firms in second and third world locations.
Due to these issues with scientific management, a second major method emerged 
in the middle of the 20th century. The human relations approach reacted to the sci￾entific method by focusing only on the social needs of the workers and ignoring the 
core technical (i.e., the input/output transformation) system. It attempted to focus on 
the entire production system, not just its individual parts. Significantly, it considered 
how informal groups inside the organization could actually control people’s work 
habits and attitudes.
A famous example of this impact is the Hawthorne Effect, first identified by 
George Elton Mayo and his colleagues as part of an efficiency study at the Western 
Electric Company’s Hawthorne plant. Western Electric wanted to know how much 
productivity would increase when better illumination was provided in their facil￾ity. The result was surprising: productivity increased as illumination was increased. 
Productivity also increased when illumination was decreased. Mayo discovered that 
productivity increased, not as a result of better lighting but as the result of the atten￾tion received by the workers under study.
A further analysis of the Hawthorne Effect found that, overall, people are social 
creatures and work is primarily a social activity. This implies that the need for 
TABLE 1.2 (CONTINUED)
Principal Schools of Management Thought
School of 
Thought Definition Key Beliefs
Contingency 
School
Emphasizes management as a highly 
practice-oriented and action-based 
discipline. Managerial decisions and 
actions are more a matter of pragmatism 
and less of theoretical principles.
The choice of approaches and their 
underlying management theory and 
principles tend to be deterministic, while 
the pace, pattern, and behavior of events 
defy deterministic approaches. What is 
valid and good in a particular situation 
need not be the same in some other 
environment.
The environment of organizations and 
managers is very complex, uncertain, 
ever-changing, and diverse. It is the 
basic function of managers to analyze 
and understand the environments in 
which they function before applying 
their techniques, processes, and 
practices.12 Navigating the Engineering Organization
recognition, security, and sense of belonging is more important in determining 
morale and productivity than physical working conditions alone.7
These (and other) findings spurred further studies in the human relations model. In 
1960, social psychologist Douglas McGregor developed two contrasting theories explain￾ing how managers’ beliefs about what motivates their people can directly affect their 
management style. He labeled these Theory X (authoritarian) and Theory Y (participative).
Theory X managers tend to take a pessimistic view of their people. This theory 
assumes that workers dislike their work, avoid responsibility, need constant direc￾tion, must be controlled, be threatened to deliver work, need to be closely supervised, 
and have no incentive to work or have any ambition. Authority is rarely delegated, 
and control remains firmly centralized. Managers are more authoritarian and actively 
intervene to get things done.
In contrast, Theory Y managers have a more optimistic, positive view of their 
people and use a decentralized, participative management style. They encourage a 
more collaborative, trust-based relationship between management and workers.
Theory Y assumes that workers wish to work on their own initiative, be involved 
in decision-making, are self-motivated, take ownership of their work, accept respon￾sibility for results, and need little direction. They see work as fulfilling and challeng￾ing, and Theory Y organizations also provide employees with frequent opportunities 
for promotion.
Obviously, Theory Y is viewed as superior to Theory X, reflecting the desire for 
more meaningful work and providing staff with more than just money.8
These theories continue to be important today, providing the basis for the ongoing 
experimental work methods being developed in startup and entrepreneurial firms, 
especially digitally-based organizations.
So what approach are we going to take in this book: scientific, humanistic, or 
something else? Frankly, compared to the length of human history, we really don’t 
know much about organizations and management. And yes, many of today’s orga￾nizations are still heavily imprinted with hierarchy, bureaucracy, and formalization. 
But another reality has emerged. Engineering organizations, both large and complex 
or small and entrepreneurial, are relentlessly experimenting with highly innovative 
approaches to the workplace that defy easy categorization. The orderly and predict￾able assumptions regarding these organizations, the role of managers, and their tools 
are furiously being replaced. What leaves us is an entire spectrum of work methods 
and approaches that are advancing without pause. Geographic location, age of the 
technology, first adopter or legacy, technology production or development, sophisti￾cation of the corporate culture, and worker age all heavily impact the firm’s manage￾ment style.
It’s obvious the proper methodology is highly contingent on these and many other 
factors. So, our approach is neither: we must address it as we proceed.
1.3.3 Which Perspective: Engineering, Business, or Other?
Several of you might be pondering if this book is more of a business tome than an 
engineering book. Let me assure you that this book is about engineering, but from Introduction 13
the point of view of who we are, what we do, how we think, and how we get things 
done, not just engineering as a mechanical function we perform each day. It is about 
engineering organizations, their operation, and your role within them.
There is a long-standing mental model about the relative knowledge of engineers 
vs. businesspeople. Knowledge has both depth and breath. The engineer tends to have 
a depth of knowledge: a specialist who has a precise and complete understanding of 
a narrower discipline. Businesspeople may gravitate toward the general: thinking 
in broad ideas and trends, but perhaps not in depth. Obviously a stereotype, but it 
does highlight the basic difference between engineering and business: engineering 
is precise; business is approximate. Engineering looks to the objective for guidance; 
business tends to be more subjective. Engineering is quantitative, and business is 
more qualitative. The differences between the two are not merely about topics but 
also about their fundamental viewpoint about knowledge. While initially distress￾ing, there is actually an advantage when studying both: the advantage of balance in 
pursuit of knowledge.
This brings us to the role of today’s management consultant. Philip Coggan, a business 
columnist for The Economist, has written about the massive number of words devoted to 
and about business management, lamenting the number of books piled high on his desk 
that he will never read. Coggan contends the sheer variety of business advice published 
suggests that management gurus don’t yet have a handle on the enterprise nor organiza￾tions: if they did, the pile of books on his desk would disappear.9
This means there is risk in blindly applying business advice from a single source, 
as some advice can actually be harmful to the firm. The good news is that these 
once fashionable but damaging management ideas do (thankfully) get thrown on the 
scrapheap. Shareholder value had its time in the sun: it led to poor or unsustainable 
business practices such as, in some cases, businesses falsifying financial information 
to boost shareholder returns. Business process reengineering was identified as one of 
the most important solutions for organizational improvements until high failure rates 
of 70% or more were reported.10 The list of these ideas has led some to refer to these 
notions as the “fad of the month.”
What all this means to answering our question of a business vs. engineering 
approach is a mixture of both: the more certain and precise aspects of engineering 
applied against the generalist and highly contingent facets of business. For you this 
implies a struggle: the uncertainty of balancing the science-based training you’ve 
experienced against the contingency-based foundation of organizations. At this 
point, just know it’s coming, and let’s move on.
1.3.4 What We Won’t Address
As important as what we will cover in this book, of equal importance is what we 
won’t cover. There is absolutely no way this book can cover every single topic or sub￾ject regarding organizations, especially engineering organizations. And that’s okay: 
we don’t intend to. Instead, I’d like you to use this book is a first step in understand￾ing the situations you might find yourself and then developing effective solutions 
based on those situations. In this way, this book provides the tools to arrive at a first 14 Navigating the Engineering Organization
understanding, and then help develop a holistic path to resolution. Remember, we 
are about knowledge and insight here, the how and why, not checklist-style training.
For the easy questions, yes, this book hopefully provides some simple and straight￾forward options, but for more difficult questions we intend to provide a method or 
approach and ultimately answer those questions, what our friends studying philoso￾phy would call a “path to Nirvana.”
1.4 REALIZATIONS
We’ve started this book by talking about the idea of transforming students and recent 
graduates into engineering professionals. The stakes can be quite large, and while 
some may find this transformation easy, most others will discover it to be quite dif￾ficult without some guidance. The simile here is that of crossing a large barrier, a 
Great Divide, and we need to arm ourselves with knowledge, insight, and a few tools 
before setting out to make that crossing.
The basic idea is, as you transition from an engineering student to a professional, 
you realize there is indeed an important change going on, and the success of this 
change depends on you, and only you, to make this happen.
This book aims to help you understand the unique values and expectations pres￾ent within your new engineering organization. It will help you discover insights into 
the unique organizational expectations of engineering. It will assist you in acting on 
these insights to deliver successful results to your management, thus rapidly building 
your management’s confidence in you as a professional.
It’s important we set out some fundamental boundaries and ground rules employed 
in this book, ring-fencing the specific topics and what (and what not) will be cov￾ered. Of particular importance is the school of thought approach, represented by the 
contingency model that we will follow. Related to the contingency model are two 
important concepts: scientific management vs. human relations, and the engineering 
vs. business perspective. Both are discussed in detail.
So that’s our introduction. We are on our way to crossing a Great Divide to a new 
destination, gaining some helpful ideas about the strange land you now entering, or 
perhaps just avoiding some skinned knees. If either of these outcomes occurs, we 
can count it as a win.
Let’s get on with it.

2 The Impending Problem
From Student to 
Engineering Professional
2.1 WELCOME TO YOUR BRAVE NEW WORLD
Let’s see if you agree with this. On graduation, you believe the hard part is over. No 
more exams, no more all-nighters, no more Ramen noodles at 2:00 am. Instead, you 
begin your professional life as an engineer. Think of it: just a mere eight hours a day, 
working on an exciting, life-altering product, basking in the praise of your manage￾ment and peers as your work is celebrated across the industry. And don’t forget the 
free snacks.
Of course, you already know these comforting thoughts aren’t necessarily true. 
But just what is going on? What will happen as you begin your new job? Will you 
fit in or be a pariah? Will anyone help you? Great questions, and this chapter will 
discuss the idea that yes, something big is lurking out there but you just can’t see it 
yet: the reality of your first professional job. The pre-season practice is over; it’s time 
for the game to count.
This moment describes the concept of “crossing the Great Divide,” where gradua￾tion and winning a new job immediately makes your current engineering education, 
well, less relevant than you might have thought. When you finally arrive at work, you 
will probably experience confusion, uncertainty, and worry while immediately mak￾ing mistakes of omission and commission, leaving your new boss shaking their head 
as to why they hired this minnow. And there will be a cost to you. You will quickly 
be assessed using the concept of confidence and comfort, that is, their confidence in 
your work result plus comfort in your fundamental social ability and behavior, both 
of which are necessary to integrate into your new home.
Indeed, welcome to your brave new world.
2.2 THE BASIC TRANSITION: STUDENT TO PROFESSIONAL
The essential problem you face is simple yet also complex. On starting your new 
job, your singular and immediate challenge is to successfully cross the barrier that 
stands before you. It’s a problem you probably have not faced before. While the goal 
is clear, the method of how to get there is not. You probably do not have the neces￾sary tools to achieve it. Even if you do know how to transition and have the necessary

tools, do you have the skill to use them? And how fast do you need to perform this 
metamorphosis?
At least the goal is simple. What we’re looking for here is a transition, a trans￾formation. A movement from one state of being to another. And what are you trans￾forming into? Simply stated, a professional identity. Figure 2.1 sums it up.
2.3 EASY OR NOT? YOUR CHOICE
Up to now, as an engineering student you have dealt with the immense world of 
science, mathematics, and technology. The calculus, differential equations, statics 
and dynamics, exotic materials and digital design; all were expected to be mastered 
within four short years. Simultaneously, the amount of technical information avail￾able to you during that time has snowballed, forcing you to cram ever more technical 
facts and concepts into that same four-year period. You learned the detailed “nuts 
and bolts” of technical subjects, but scant time was spent on the overarching skills of 
understanding and operating (never mind succeeding) in the actual day-to-day work 
of your new organization. This duty is left to you alone, perhaps (if you are fortunate) 
supplemented with a sketchy onboarding program run by your company’s human 
resources organization. Sadly, the reality is you will probably have little knowledge 
or understanding of your new professional home and how to operate within it.
Of course, the good news is that everyone experiences this phase, and I doubt 
anyone avoids it, but that is small comfort at this moment. The question being posed 
to you now is this: Will you transition from student to professional with an easy

laissez-faire approach, letting things take their own course, confident in your per￾ceptions and knowledge of people and the workplace? Or will you proceed with a 
more difficult proactive mindset, acknowledging that this is new territory for you, 
yet wanting to guide the trajectory of your transformation as you see fit?
Let’s consider some examples.
CASE EXAMPLE 2.1 BUILDING THE F-18 JET FIGHTER
One of my first experiences in transitioning had to do with an early assignment 
as an engineer. I had just entered the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now 
Boeing), helping to design and build the F/A-18 fighter jet for the U.S. Navy. 
At that time the F-18 was the world’s most advanced fighter, and I was very 
pleased (if not somewhat prideful) of my assignment as a design engineer and 
my part in this important project. As the fighter progressed from “drawing 
board” to first prototype build, I followed it onto the factory floor as a liaison 
engineer, responsible for solving initial build problems and correcting them for 
the production phase to follow.
In the factory, I became acquainted and worked with a foreman by the name of 
Bob Tyler. Bob was an excellent foreman, with about ten years’ experience build￾ing advanced aircraft. I quickly observed that Bob had the expertise and knowl￾edge to solve an amazing number of assembly issues, and had the communication 
skills to successfully direct his build crew in correcting these unique problems.
Late one afternoon, while working on the plane’s outer wing, one of Bob’s 
crew mistakenly drilled about 20 holes into a critical structural fitting. Since 
all flight stresses from the wing went through this key fitting, it had to be 
built perfectly. I was deeply concerned; there was not a spare part available so 
this damaged part had to be fixed correctly, otherwise the wing (and thus the 
entire aircraft) could suffer a major structural failure in flight. Consulting the 
structural engineers, we developed a repair that would work, but it had to be 
executed precisely with absolutely no margin for error. At the end of the day, I 
worriedly briefed Bob on the repair his crew must perform that evening. Bob 
assured me he and his crew would handle the job correctly that night.
That evening during dinner, I continued to worry about the problem. What 
if the crew mishandled the repair? They had already made a mistake, why 
wouldn’t they make another? What if somebody didn’t get the word and inad￾vertently wrecked the part? The first flight of the jet would be delayed, and I 
would be held responsible. Finally, standing it no longer, I returned to the fac￾tory after dinner to see what the crew was doing. As I approached the wing fix￾ture, I saw Bob standing there. He was not happy to see me. As I approached, 
he asked sharply:
Tyler: “What are you doing here?”
Santer: “I was worried about the repair and wanted to see if the crew was 
doing it right.”22 Navigating the Engineering Organization
I’ll never forget what happened next. Looking me in the eye, he said:
Tyler: “Santer, I’m really disappointed in you. You coming in here sent me the 
message that you don’t trust me or my crew’s ability or desire to do 
this job right. Do you think this is all about you? It’s not. My crew and 
I are just as interested in doing this right as you are. I suggest you go 
home, grab a beer, and watch the baseball game. We got this.”
I was stunned and more than a little embarrassed. But he was right. I assumed 
no one else cared about the job but me. I exposed a bias toward Bob and his 
crew by thinking of them as merely factory workers, showing I lacked confi￾dence in their professionalism to do the job right.
From that experience, I always tried to put myself in another worker’s position 
and certainly not judge them based on a stereotype. Instead, I now wait to see the 
capabilities and attitude my colleagues actually demonstrate before I make any 
judgments. Bob did me a great service that evening, and I haven’t forgotten it.
How about the situation in an office rather than the factory floor? Take Brad 
Collins, a new engineering hire in a Fortune 100 multinational. After a day or 
two of settling in, his supervisor, Craig Wilson, came to him early one morning 
with his first assignment. “Brad, calculate the weight difference between these two 
competing compressor designs.” Brad, eager to show off his engineering prowess, 
begins a detailed analysis, calculating the weight to the third decimal point. At 8 
o’clock the next morning, Craig approaches Brad and asks, “So, Brad, what did you 
find out?” Brad proudly reports that the first compressor weighs 31.724 lbs., and he 
will have the second compressor weight completed by day’s end. Craig is shocked. 
“Brad, we’re reporting out this weight study in 30 minutes, at the weekly project 
review. You mean you only have half an answer? Brad admits that, indeed, he 
only has a partial answer, saying he didn’t know about the review. Craig responds 
“Well, we’ll have to tell them something.”
At the review, Craig covers for Brad by making the status report himself, 
stating they have not completed their analysis but will send out the complete 
study by the end of the day. The program manager is annoyed, but grudgingly 
accepts the plan.
What happened? A classic case of unspoken expectations and conflicting 
assumptions between an experienced supervisor and new hire. Brad thought 
the important deliverable was a highly accurate analysis; Craig wanted a fast, 
approximate answer. Brad didn’t ask when the assignment was due; Craig 
assumed Brad knew the due date was the next day’s meeting. Brad cringed 
when being told of the misunderstanding; Craig was annoyed having to take 
the blame for his new hire. Brad could have avoided this outcome if he knew 
enough to ask for an explicit due date and what level of accuracy was required; 
Craig could have prevented the incident by realizing that Brad needs explicit 
instructions and explanation at this point. But neither understood the other. 
The takeaway? Both Brad and Craig lose a little confidence in Brad.The Impending Problem 23
This is what a new engineer’s transformation is all about: understanding both 
the overt and covert workings of the technical organization. Yes, learning these 
lessons and benefiting from the resulting experience can be uncomfortable. And 
sadly, there is little help available to assist you. Relevant books and published 
papers from professional engineering societies or other sources are virtually non￾existent. The small number of “engineering management” books available offer 
a series of disjointed, stand-alone technical topics in finance, production, deci￾sion-making, and the like, but either ignoring engineering organizational behavior 
(EOB) entirely or treat it as an afterthought. The EOB aspects are unique to engi￾neers: their thought patterns, work methods, definitions of success, work quality, 
and other engineering-specific behaviors are missing. Most importantly, no unified 
framework exists for new hires to understand organizational structure and then 
successfully apply these EOB concepts to their own technical organizations.
So, we arrive back at our initial question. Do you choose to move into your 
first professional job as so many people have done before, leaving your transi￾tion to luck and Brownian motion? Or do you wish to maximize your transition 
opportunities (and minimize your cringeworthy moments) by actively apply￾ing some of the concepts shared here? By reading this far, you are probably 
open to the latter. I hope that assumption is correct.
2.4 CROSSING THE GREAT DIVIDE
Congratulations on choosing to move forward. Let’s next talk more about the idea of 
the Great Divide that separates your current organizational skills from the expecta￾tions of your new organization. For-profit businesses want new engineers to contrib￾ute rapidly and effectively, with little or no incurred cost. Unfortunately, you do not 
yet have these skills, and as I’ve said, little guidance exists on how to obtain them 
without excessive time or embarrassment.
Obviously, this matters. If you as a new hire cannot effectively and efficiently 
integrate your effort into the organization, your work will certainly be relegated to 
the organizational shelf or, worse yet, the dustbin.
You have work to do in understanding what is really going on within your new 
group and with the organization in general. With that starting point, what informa￾tion or guidance do you actually possess, right now, that you can use in your transi￾tion? Your new company probably did not give you any brochure on what to expect, 
no “how to” guide on what’s next. Your past professors may not be the best source 
of current information, and perhaps the paid (or, more commonly, unpaid) intern￾ship you completed during your junior year was less than ideal. Maybe you have the 
good fortune of having friends or acquaintances already in the company. They can 
certainly give you a bit of a head start on what to expect, but they will probably be 
in a different department than you, and the differences between departments may be 
substantial. You will be exposed to a new language of the company, with acronyms 
galore. And what’s important to your boss and your new organization is something 24 Navigating the Engineering Organization
you’ve probably never considered. So based on what you actually have in hand, you 
may be a bit unprepared for what’s to come.
Yet you must proceed now to cross the Divide. You may feel woefully unprepared.
And that’s okay.
One thing you have going for you is this: once hired, all companies (including 
yours) want you to succeed. After all, they have devoted substantial money and time 
to your recruitment and onboarding. Managers are held to objective metrics on how 
well their talent acquisition systems are operating. As a result, they care deeply about 
understanding how your generational cohort (at this writing, Generation Z) thinks 
and believes to better recruit and apply your fresh knowledge for the firm’s greater 
good. This brings us to the question of internships.
2.5 INTERNSHIPS ARE NOT PREPARATION
We all know the situation. The expectation is that you, a recent graduate engineer, 
should have had one (if not two or even three) engineering-related internships, spend￾ing your summers at major, multinational companies on the leading edge of digital or 
technical innovation. You should have spent your time with fellow students sharing 
an awesome engineering experience, glowing with a special feeling as they prepared 
you for a new, exciting professional life.
That certainly is the hope, and many engineering undergraduates like yourself 
have enjoyed some of these eye-opening and exciting experiences. They may have 
even paid you, or provided free apartments, moving allowances and business trips.
For those lucky few, great. But for the vast majority of engineering students the 
internship experience may have been less than optimal. While the current emphasis 
on engineering internships can certainly help you for a few insights, the reality is that 
internships are generally much too short, limited in scope and very, very uneven in 
quality to be of much help. Let’s face it, some internships can result in the old joke: 
“If you pretend to train us, we’ll pretend to learn.”
You may wonder: why wouldn’t your internship adequately prepare you for your 
Brave New World? After all, isn’t that the purpose of an internship, a two-way street 
where you see if you might like the work, and the company gets an early look at your 
capabilities, talents, and technical prowess? Of course, that’s the general idea. But 
internships are not professional jobs.
There is no doubt, the intent of internships is well-meaning. Internships are meant 
to sharpen classroom knowledge against the stone of real-world experience. You may 
have read about the benefits of gaining experience, increasing your marketability and 
competitive advantage for jobs while building your professional network. Yet there are 
common issues with internships that can negate the preparation aspects they are meant to 
address. A significant issue is underutilizing interns, where some students are ignored or 
perform menial tasks for the entire duration of their tenure. And no one is fooled; every￾one is fully aware that what they do is not real-life experience. Another issue is being 
neglected by your supervisor or other person assigned to guide you as your supervisor 
or leader is much too busy to expend any energy on someone who will be gone in three 
month’s time. Still another is the lack of performance feedback. For those who have had 
at least one internship, this doesn’t qualify as news.1The Impending Problem 25
It’s clear that, while internships hold so much potential, they fall short in giving 
you the critically needed insight and skills to help you make a successful transition.
So, what does this transition from student to professional look like? Table 2.1 is a 
good start in summarizing this metamorphosis:
Each of the eight points in the left-hand column can help describe your internship 
experience. More importantly, the right-hand column can give you a hint into what 
your professional work life might look like.
I’m certain we all wish the internship experience could be better. But the intern￾ship experience is generally not a good preparation. So, what about other resources 
to help you conquer the Great Divide?
2.6 THE BOSS IS NOT THE PROFESSOR
Let’s start with a single basic fact: the boss is not the professor. I repeat, the boss is 
not the professor. A boss and a professor are two fundamentally different manage￾ment positions designed to accomplish two very different tasks. You cannot substi￾tute one for the other.
Your relationship with each is based on an implied social contract, which is an 
implicit agreement among the members of an organization or society to cooperate 
for mutual social benefits. However, in this discussion those social benefits are quite 
different for each relationship.
A professor is a facilitator charged with assisting you in receiving your educa￾tion. While they are an authority figure, they are nominally your guide, enabler, and 
judge who is obligated to provide training or knowledge (or both) to ensure you have 
reached the academic standards imposed by their institution, your profession, and 
overall society. Their role is to provide a credential that certifies you as “educated” 
in your profession. After you receive that credential, the relationship normally ends.
A boss is also an authority figure, a person who exercises control or power over 
workers in a business setting. Remember, an organization is about converting time, 
talent, money, and other resources into an output that is of more value than its inputs. 
Your boss, be they a supervisor, manager, or higher-level director, is there to ensure

your efforts translate into achieving the organization’s goals, normally (but certainly 
not exclusively) financial.
The differences can be seen in Table 2.2. But here’s a somewhat cynical insight: 
there are actually a pair of similarities between the two. The first similarity is that 
you provide resources to both. You pay universities, and you invest your talent and 
skill into firms. The second similarity is more impactful. Both institutions (universities 
and engineering firms) openly promote the notion that their management (professors 
and managers) energetically guide and counsel their charges (students and new hires), 
devoting plentiful resources to your training and development. Instead, you will find 
they will devote plentiful resources on their own annual objectives and goals, which 
normally have nothing to do with a student’s or new engineer’s development.
No matter what, the simple and obvious truth is your immediate future is now 
determined by the boss, not the professor. The totality of your attention should be 
directed at those supervisors, managers, and directors who hold the path of your 
future in their care.
Your professors are now obsolete.
2.7 CREATING AN ENGINEERING ARCHETYPE
As you and thousands of your new brother and sister engineers stand ready to cross 
the Divide and arrive at the promised land of the professional, it’s instructive to try to 
categorize this group of new graduates into some broad categories. Certainly not at the 
individual level (that would be flat wrong and, frankly, a bit insulting) but as a collective. 
Who is this group of new engineers? What are they about? And why do we care?

onThe Impending Problem 27
That last question is a simple one. As you will see repeatedly in this book, to 
comprehend today’s technical work world means to understand not only yourself, 
but especially those who will be your colleagues and, yes, your competitors. You 
must attempt to grasp their thoughts, recognize their values, and know their limita￾tions and strengths. This understanding is both necessary and required in preparing 
yourself for what is to come. And creating an archetype is a first step.
There is a difference between an archetype and stereotype. A stereotype is a widely 
held, fixed, and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. It’s a 
preconceived idea of the characteristics which typify a person or situation, or an attitude 
based on such a preconception. It’s a person who appears to conform closely to the idea 
of a type, a prerequisite belief about an individual or individuals.
An archetype is different. It’s a statement, pattern of behavior, or model which 
others can replicate or emulate going forward. It is the original pattern or model from 
which copies are made. It’s a prototype of an assumed ideal form. In other words, it’s 
the original of something, the original from which a model is developed.2
Archetypes apply to people as well as objects. Unsurprisingly, there are data 
available that outline the average characteristics of who and what a new engineer 
might be. Yes, this can be a slightly dangerous exercise (no one likes to be profiled), 
but in the aggregate it’s instructive in understanding the professional society you 
are about to enter. (As a preview, in Chapter 3 we will ask you to evaluate yourself 
individually using some very specific tools, but right now we’re attempting to outline 
and flesh out the engineering group archetype.)
Luckily, we have lots of data to work with. Groups such as the American Society 
for Engineering Education (ASEE) are awash in demographic and quantitative data 
regarding each year’s engineering graduate population. For example, ASEE reports 
very complete statistical data on undergraduate and graduate graduation numbers, 
gender, international vs. domestic origins, and so on. From this we can begin to con￾struct an amalgam of these graduates.3
So let’s go ahead and create an archetype of a prototypical new engineer. We’ll use 
three separate evaluation tools to perform this analysis: Demographics, the Myers￾Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and the Five-Factor Personality Inventory (FFPI). 
Why multiple tools? These and other personality assessments merely provide clues 
into the engineering temperament, not definitive conclusions or predictions. Trying 
to create an archetype strictly from any single tool will be inaccurate and highly 
arguable, so we must use all three tools to triangulate in on a judgment of the popula￾tion under study. In short, maximum benefit comes from creating an understanding 
of others through a combination of these tools.
Let’s now step through our analysis.
2.7.1  Demographics
Demographics are statistics that describe populations and their characteristics, 
and is the easiest analysis to perform. In this case, we will limit our archetype to 
a North American engineering graduate. We’ll call this engineer Jacob (the most 
popular American boy’s name in 2000), a 23-year-old male engineering graduate 
(77.5% of bachelor-level engineering graduates are men) from the Georgia Institute 28 Navigating the Engineering Organization
of Technology (the highest percentage of all national bachelor engineering gradu￾ates come from there). Jacob is a graduate in mechanical engineering (surprisingly, 
24.2% of all undergraduate degrees awarded are mechanical, higher than electrical 
or computer) and had good grades at university with a 3.4 out of 4.0 GPA (the top 
25% of the average of U.S. schools). Born in the United States, Jacob comes from 
a solidly middle-class family and was raised in a two-parent household that valued 
education and achievement. He landed an entry-level position in a large multina￾tional product development firm in his mechanical engineering specialty.
Pretty unremarkable information, only covers an individual. What about the 
demographics of the related members of his generation? What insights can be gath￾ered from the leading edge of the generational cohort of Generation Z?
As you probably already know, Generation Z is a demographic defined as indi￾viduals born after 1996, making their oldest members approximately 26 years old as 
of this writing. They are part of a highly racially and ethnically diverse group and 
extremely comfortable with digital communications and technology. Very highly 
educated, they are politically progressive and pro-government, and see diversity in 
racial, ethnic, and gender areas as positive. Currently, non-engineers are vulnerable 
to job loss (as they make up the majority of employees in high-risk work sectors), and 
they look to government, rather than businesses and individuals, to solve problems.4
Our graduate archetype becomes a little more interesting when we evaluate him 
using two additional tools: the MBTI and the FFPI.
2.7.2  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
Probably the most well-known personality instrument is the Myers-Briggs Type 
Indicator (MBTI), also known as the 16-Personality Assessment. The MBTI is a 
personal survey designed to assess individual personality based on Jung’s theory of 
types. According to this model, different personality characteristics drive different 
career choices and vocations. Most of you are already familiar with this, and many 
(if not most) of you probably took the MBTI in secondary school or university.5
The MBTI model has four distinct traits that represent contrasts in the way individu￾als think and behave, with a total of sixteen subcategories. The four main traits are:
1) Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E)
2) Intuition (N) vs. Sensing (S)
3) Feeling (F) vs. Thinking (T)
4) Perception (P) vs. Judging (J)
Literally millions of these tests have been given to all segments of global society, 
providing an extremely large data set from which to pull.
Significantly, the MBTI is often used by employers to help gain a general under￾standing of their employees’ strengths and weaknesses.6 Engineers have not been 
ignored. Specific research on the characteristics of engineer’s belief systems and 
resulting actions have been studied for some time now.
So, what can we say about the aggregate traits of new engineers compared with an 
average adult population?

of each, and the MBTI percentage distributions of two groups: the average U.S. adult 
population and North American undergraduate engineering students.7
Looking to identify the widest differences between the adults and students in 
each subcategory, and selecting a + / – 5% difference as an error band results in 7 of 
the 16 subcategories being notably different.
These data show three major personality types (INTP, ISTJ, and INTJ) compose 
39% of the sample engineers, being significantly overrepresented vs. just 17% of the 
general population. On the other hand, the four major types of ISFJ, ESFJ, ISFP, and 
ESFP make up just 11% of the engineering population vs. 43% for the population as 
a whole. This is shown graphically in Figure 2.2.
Now, here’s where things get controversial: attempting to generalize engineer’s 
traits. Some common characteristics emerge when examining these descriptors and 
attributes. Based on the MBTI data shown in Table 2.4, our archetypical engineer 
Jacob:
1) Seeks to develop logical explanations for everything that interests him. 
Tends to see patterns in external events and develop long-range explana￾tions of those events. Focuses on the theoretical and abstract and can be 
perceived as being more interested in ideas than social interaction.
2) Is naturally skeptical and occasionally critical, but always analytical and 
independent. Demonstrates high standards of competence and performance 
for himself and others which some may see as perfectionistic.

3) Tends to be quiet, serious, contained yet adaptable; earns success by thor￾oughness and dependability. Has an unusual ability to focus in-depth to 
solve problems in his area of interest.
4) Is practical, realistic, and responsible. Takes pleasure in making everything 
orderly and organized in his work, home, and life, and values traditions and 
loyalty.
5) Decides logically what should be done and work toward it steadily, regard￾less of distractions. When committed, shows great drive for implementing 
his ideas and sees the job through to achieve his goals.8
Compared to Jacob, the general adult population tends to mainly show more “peo￾ple centered” behaviors and actions. Common descriptors of this group include 
friendly, sensitive, kind, outgoing, cooperative, and considerate. Examples of 
these people-centric values are common: remembering specifics about people 
who are important to them, concern with how others feel, or striving to create a 
harmonious environment at work and home. They may notice what others need 
in their day-by-day lives and try to provide it. Enjoying life, people, and material 
comforts, they can readily adapt to new people and environments. Very impor￾tantly, this group is loyal and committed to their values and to the people who 
are important to them.9
It’s interesting to read these findings, but even more useful when we add some 
additional tools to the mix.
2.7.3  The Five-Factor Personality Inventory
A completely different personality assessment is the Five-Factor Personality 
Inventory (FFPI), a behavioral model used in psychology to model a person’s indi￾vidual personality traits. Personality traits are defined as patterns of thought, feeling, 
and behavior that are reasonably enduring across an individual’s lifespan. The FFPI 
is considered the most scientifically validated of the widely known evaluation meth￾ods, and has impressive substantiation across cultures, life span, and gender.
This model is based on five independent personality traits, each having its own 
causes and observable behaviors. The key word here is independent. These five char￾acteristics have minimum interdependence with each other and can be used as sepa￾rate descriptors. These descriptors are as follows:
1. Openness/Autonomy: demonstrates intellect, imagination, and indepen￾dent-minded thinking; can easily link facts together.
2. Conscientiousness: referring to orderly, responsible, and dependable behav￾ior; likes to follow a regular schedule.
3. Extraversion: someone who is talkative, assertive, and energetic; likes to 
converse.
4. Agreeableness: being good natured, cooperative, and trusting.
5. Emotional Stability: displaying calm, even-tempered, and secure behaviors, 
can take their mind off their own problems.34 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The model is based on a scoring system; the meanings of a high and low score for 
each factor can be seen in Figure 2.3. Each trait is shown as a percentile compared 
to the general population. For example, a person may have higher agreeableness than 
64% of the population, but higher openness than only 22% of that same population.
A number of FFPI studies have compared various groups of engineers with the 
general population. In one study of 419 subjects, Kichuk and Wiesner used the FFPI 
to examine the success and failures of engineering design teams. They found that 
successful teams tended to show higher levels of extraversion and agreeableness 
while also showing a higher level of emotional stability.10
Similarly, Reilly et al. showed that, in new product development teams, a higher 
level of team agreeableness and conscientiousness was related to more effective team 
performance.11
Meanwhile, Sayeed and Jain compared the interpersonal skills of students both 
with and without an engineering background. Students without an engineering back￾ground showed to be more open and understanding of others, and more focused on 
the feelings of others than students with an engineering education.12
Brown and Joslin found engineering students scored significantly lower on “need 
for independence” and higher on measures of responsibility, productivity, persever￾ance, goal orientation, and decisiveness compared with other college students.13
In Europe, Kline and Lapham studied students from five English universities. 
Engineering students scored higher on conscientiousness, tough-mindedness, and 
conventionality than students in other disciplines. No differences were found with 
respect to extraversion and emotional stability.14

Finally, a study by Van Der Molen and others investigated the personality charac￾teristics of a group of engineers with a variety of years of experience. A total of 103 
engineers were tested using the FFPI model. Overall, this group was shown to score 
lower on agreeableness, and higher on extraversion, conscientiousness, emotional 
stability, and autonomy, compared to the general public. Interestingly, the older the 
engineer, the more conscientious and autonomous they were, while engineers with 
lower educational degrees were more conscientious than those with higher degrees.15
Table 2.5 summarizes these various studies. Taken together, these FFPI-related 
studies strongly imply that student engineers are more conscientious and goal-driven

than others, and show some indications toward enhanced emotional stability. Higher 
extraversion for engineers was slightly elevated, but only in team-based work or 
within experienced engineers. Interestingly, agreeableness in engineers was positive, 
but only in team settings. Perceptions of agreeableness in engineers in individual 
settings were below the general populations. However, no positive or negative trends 
for openness were found.
A word of caution here. With just one exception (Van Der Molen) these studies 
were limited to engineering students rather than experienced, seasoned engineers. 
It’s possible that new engineering graduates demonstrate only certain FFPI char￾acteristics due to their inexperience, and they will “grow into” more open, extra￾verted, agreeable, and emotionally settled professionals over time. Additionally, 
most of the studies lacked an adequate norm group that could be used to compare 
the results.
Based on the three techniques, what insights about your future collogues and co￾workers can we make? What might they act like, believe in, and value? What can we 
say about a new engineering graduate?
Let’s go ahead now and define our friend Jacob, our engineering archetype. First, 
I have to make the obligatory comment that the results of this little comparison are 
not prescriptive, nor all encompassing, nor meant to call out any individual or pro￾fession. And the qualitative data is fairly scattered. We’re just trying to get a general 
handle on who the engineering archetype might be. Statistically speaking, this is not 
a bell-shaped curve shaped high and tight; it’s a curve with long tails on both ends 
and should remain that way.
That said, who is Jacob, and what have we learned? Table 2.6 is our judgment in 
tabular form.
So, what can we glean from this trilogy of behavioral insight? First, very soon 
in your first professional position, you are going to run into some version of Jacob. 
Obviously, not displaying all these characteristics but certainly several of them 
within the same individual. Assuming your goal is to work well with these col￾leagues, you can use these insights as a tool to develop specific connections to dif￾ferent individuals, a skill that builds social capital and cements the bonds between 
like-minded engineers striving to achieve common goals.
Second, this is an excellent tool for designing and populating work groups. 
Given a particular project, and having determined the collection of personnel skills 
required (a highly detailed worker, a critical thinker, a creative), you can identify and 
build a winning team whose skills complement each other.16
Yet another use is to help understand your management. If you are given an 
assignment that, frankly, doesn’t make much sense, you can use the archetype to get 
to the core of the difference in worldview and solve it to everyone’s advantage.
One suggestion. This archetype will be of more use to you if you tuck it away in 
your desk and refer to it as you proceed through your early days at work. When pre￾sented with an unusual situation, this summary should be one of the first references 
you reach for to help assess your circumstances.
One final point. This archetype is not a profile that is stuck in time. The archetype 
characteristics will change over time as the toll of hard-won experiences, success, The Impending Problem 37
failures, and insight changes our beliefs and view of reality. This archetype is about 
new graduates starting out, not seasoned engineers near the end of their careers.
2.8 THE PAST AS PROLOGUE
Let’s change gears now. This is probably a good time to talk about the role of history in 
technology and engineering. I generally want to stay away from strictly historical conver￾sations in this book. But knowing what has come before is important, as an old system 
can be put in place many decades ago yet continue to be used even when better systems 
have been proven and could be used instead. In other words, inertia is common.

Engineering is no different. As mentioned earlier, in the late 1800s Frederick 
Taylor became known for his “scientific” approach to engineering-related work. His 
famous experiment of measuring pig iron moved versus shovel size established the 
idea of scientific management, which is applying quantifiable metrics to work output. 
That idea from over 100 years ago is surprisingly still in use today. Scientific man￾agement is still one of many choices when working in an organization as an engineer. 
The past is still with us, and let’s keep this in mind as we move forward.
As a general understanding, there are three points about engineering and its story. 
First, when compared to length of human history, we really don’t know much about 
technical organizations and management compared to the length of time engineering 
has been a discipline. Second, today’s organizations are still heavily imprinted with 
hierarchy, bureaucracy, and formalization. Finally, as organizations become large 
and complex, the orderly and predictable assumptions regarding these organizations, 
the role of managers, and the tools first developed during the industrial age should 
change, but don’t necessarily do.
Another factor that makes the past relevant today has to do with your new specific 
organization. Your organization will implicitly select an overall view of the relation￾ship of your work to the firm based on the past. That is, without even knowing it, the 
company will select a general approach to their employee’s work. Some companies 
today still apply scientific management. Others apply McGregor’s Theory A or Theory 
B. Still others look to blend the two for guidance in how to run the organization, or 
maybe something totally different. The key here is to be aware and use this inertia as a 
starting point in assessing the approach your new company might be using.
2.9 REALIZATIONS
We’ve examined the impending problem of transitioning from your world as a stu￾dent to that of an engineering professional. We’ve asked, how large is the challenge? 
What does this new world look like? And what does it mean to me?
We’ve identified some obvious (and not so obvious) points to consider and then 
accept or decline their validity. The level of difficulty for you to make this transforma￾tion can be easy or hard, depending on how much effort you invest in it. Your prior 
internships aren’t going to help you much. The relationship you might have had with a 
favorite professor or instructor isn’t the same as with a boss. Those bets are off.
We’ve explored ways in which broad social factors and shared experiences can 
influence how a group of people close in age and sharing important experiences can 
interact with a society and develop values. We’ve spent some major time and effort 
attempting to define what an engineering archetype might look like and how they 
may or may not interact with you, and how the history of engineering and education 
may get in the way of your transformation into a new professional.
There is an old cliché that “to know where you’re going, you first have to know 
where you are.” You are at an inflection point, and it’s important to understand where 
you stand, not as an individual engineer or technical specialist, but who you are as 
part of the engineering profession. Begin to think in terms of the group. What is 
your group’s way of working? How do you in the collective solve problems? How do The Impending Problem 39
you work on technical issues with both new and experienced engineers, technical 
specialists, and other professionals?
With all that said, let’s go on to the first major step in navigating this maze called 
the engineering organization. Change can be hard, but many have discovered that the 
person undergoing change will have a much easier time if they first prepare them￾selves through adopting a new mindset. In the next chapter we’ll discuss this idea of 
mindset and how it can be used to your benefit.

3 Embracing a New 
Mindset
3.1 A NEW PERSPECTIVE
The first step in a successful transformation begins not with your arrival on your 
first day, nor with your first assignment or your initial meeting with your new boss. It 
begins within your own mind. This is a simple, but critically important, point. At this 
moment in time, if you do not consider the possibility that a new mindset is a neces￾sary prerequisite for any change, then there is a reduced hope of a successful transi￾tion. This means you need to first examine your own professional belief systems (as 
it’s been developed so far) and methods of thinking as an engineer.
This chapter offers an alternative to some current perceptions and convictions 
as acquired over 16 or so years of formal education, preparing you to consider and 
(hopefully) act on some new ideas presented in this book. It maintains that the first 
step to change is to weigh some contrary concepts that may be fundamentally in 
opposition to the outlook you currently hold. This is important, as these contrary 
ideas stretch and create new boundaries for understanding your pending transforma￾tion. In short, the goal here is to explore your current perceptions of engineering, 
study your existing assessments and beliefs, and condition you to better consider and 
absorb the ideas presented as we encounter them.
As I just said, this chapter argues that the first step to change is to ponder profes￾sional concepts that may be new to you and may be fundamentally in opposition to 
your previously learned beliefs. These contrary ideas will then constitute the new 
boundaries and ground rules for the rest of the book. These ground rules cover con￾tingency theory, data as imprecise approximations needing qualitative insight, the 
acceptance of the troublesome paradox and paradigm shifts, of self-understanding, 
the need for investigation, and the radical concept of “nobody knows anything.” 
Each of these concepts, however foreign at this moment, must be considered as a 
necessary first step in preparing to tackle the Divide.
After so many years of studying the “engineering way,” how do you accomplish 
this small feat? Through a series of insights and ideas that, step by step, build from 
on initial understanding into acceptance and ultimately, transformation. The initial 
step in a successful transformation does not begin with a checklist or a YouTube 
“how to” video.
The first step begins with evaluating a common engineering mindset.
We all know that worldview. Engineers in training are taught that all problems, no 
matter their complexity have a single, well-defined, and precise answer. That clearly 
defined systems can and should be designed and optimized to provide supreme effi￾ciency. That truth is exclusively data-driven, and all problems can be solved if only

enough prior planning and high-quality information are brought to bear. Reality is 
clean, clear, and relentlessly rational. And that perfectionism in all engineering work 
is not only desired but expected.
Unfortunately, upon entering your first professional employment, you (and your 
newly hired colleagues) must immediately deal with a critical reality. This stereotyp￾ical realm doesn’t exist. This tidy, formulaic world as learned at university is a messy, 
confused, chaotic, and nonsensical place. Problems aren’t only poorly defined; most 
can’t even be stated clearly. Goals are cloudy, project timing is impossible to estimate 
(let alone meet), work quality is uneven, and the necessary information is often just 
not available.
Your first reaction may be to deny this reality and instead attempt to impose your 
rational will upon this strange world, thinking, “Rationality has to be around here 
someplace and I’m going to find it.” Failure immediately results. You make mistakes; 
missteps abound, and your head starts hurting. And after a painful initiation, you are 
left to ponder, “What happened?”
The path to understanding what happened is first examining and then adjusting 
your values and the beliefs you’ve brought into the job. Each of the new concepts 
we’re about to consider must be absorbed and deliberated upon as a necessary step in 
preparing to cross this Divide. Let’s take a look at a few of them.
3.2 IS WHAT YOU KNOW REALLY TRUE? 
CONTINGENCY THEORY AS REALITY
A key concept throughout this book, the idea of contingency theory can be expressed 
in just two words: “everything depends.” It means that reality is conditioned on ever￾changing and uncertain facts that are only valid for a limited time and in a limited 
space. When stating obvious facts or truths, those actualities are only true if relevant to 
the surrounding conditions and environment at that time. This is in direct opposition to 
the learnings of engineering at university, i.e., there is one best, constant answer to any 
problem, that science develops “laws” that are unchanging, and that one can depend 
on facts as defined strictly by some numerical measurement. Contingency theory is 
fundamental and foundational to understanding a new reality.
Contingency theory is a subset of behavioral theory that contends there is no 
single, best way to organize a corporation, lead a company, design a problem-solving 
method, or make decisions. Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent (i.e., 
dependent) upon the internal capabilities of the organization and the condition of 
the external environment. This is not a new idea: several contingency approaches to 
organizations were developed in the late 1960s and are still used today.
The organizational theorist Jay Galbraith states clearly that, in contingency the￾ory, there is no one “best” way to organize and that the effectiveness of different 
ways of organizing depends upon the external environment and internal conditions 
present. Our definition of contingency theory will paraphrase Galbraith: 
“In contingency theory the best way to work depends on the nature of the envi￾ronment to which the work relates.”1Embracing a New Mindset 43
What’s important is that contingency theory comes from the fundamental con￾flict between scientific management and human relations models discussed earlier. 
We said scientific management holds that any organization is a purely scientific and 
rational animal that can be codified and controlled, treating an organization as a 
machine. The human relations perspective focuses only on social needs while ignor￾ing the core technical portion of organization. Contingency theory addresses these 
multiple issues by handling the dynamic external environment while melding these 
two opposing views into a flexible whole, where both viewpoints can be accommo￾dated while dealing with external environmental changes.
3.2.1  The Critical Importance of Contingency Theory
Contingency theory impacts this entire book. One of the most important and 
ubiquitous concepts repeatedly stated here is the idea there is not one best or 
optimum answer when it comes to engineering organizations and your role in 
them. There are many ways to analyze and operate within a company, with many 
correct answers conditional on the environment. And yes, some answers may be 
better than others. But this idea of many answers may be a bit uncomfortable. 
After all, you have been taught for years that there is one correct answer to a 
given problem. But unlike mathematics or other branches of the hard sciences, 
you will need to look at various points of view, and it will be your job to pick 
the most appropriate view consistent with your own education, experience, work 
life, values, and beliefs. 
It’s time for some examples highlighting the importance of contingency. Let’s 
consider the number of planets in our solar system. For anyone over the age 
of 40, we all “know” how many planets there are – nine, right? Actually, it 
depends on what year the question is asked. Nine is true, but only from 1930 
until 2006, when a few members of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) 
downgraded the status of Pluto to that of a “dwarf planet.” Pluto is still out there 
floating around; it has neither exploded nor disappeared. But with a simple voice 
vote, our entire solar system went from nine planets to eight. This is contingency 
theory in action.2
Another example deals with simple mathematics. As good engineers we all know 
that 1+1 is equal to 2. It’s been that way throughout our lives and centuries before us. 
Yet we also know that the contingency here (in this case, the unspoken assumption) 
is that we are considering numbers in the base 10 system. For instance, in the base 
2 system 1+1 equals 10. The correctness of the answer is totally dependent on the 
implied use of the binary or base 10 systems.
At this point, you might be looking for a scientific fact that is inviolate, solid, 
unchanging, and does not adhere to contingency theory. Let’s take the measure￾ment of time. We all know that on Earth, the time of day is based on a 24-hour 
clock equivalent to approximately one rotation around the Earth’s axis. But what 
about the day of the week or the day in the year? Consider the Julian calen￾dar as opposed to the Gregorian version. In 1582 the Julian calendar gained 
almost two additional weeks overnight to compensate for more accurate celestial 44 Navigating the Engineering Organization
measurement. That year, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Gregory 
XIII, decreed that Monday, October 4, 1582, would become Friday, October 15, 
1582, gaining 11 days in the process. The interesting point with this new calen￾dar was its implementation. It was not adopted in the (then) USSR until 1922, 
Greece in 1923, and Turkey in 1926. Until that time two calendars were in use 
worldwide, creating parallel answers to the question of what day it is, to some 
consternation and puzzlement.
These examples can be a lot of fun. Let’s look at one more time-related “fact” 
that sometimes is not a fact. As noted earlier, we all know that a day constitutes 
roughly 24 hours, no matter where you are in the world. Until 2000 this was true. 
But starting on November 2, 2000, this “fact” as a universal standard became obso￾lete when the first crew of the International Space Station began the continuous 
manned occupation of near-earth orbit. From then on, a day was almost exactly 
24 hours, except for an average of six earthlings, whose day changed to about 90 
minutes. From then on there have always been a handful of people whose day is not 
24 hours, but one and a half.
The message here is that contingency theory is universal, undeniable, and with 
us in every aspect of our daily life. As science and technology advances, more and 
more facts will become less certain and more contingent on the assumptions and 
environment where and when those facts are being measured. Contingency theory 
impacts, and can sometimes even control, nearly everything we experience, and the 
workplace is no exception.
3.3 THE DATA WILL SET YOU FREE … OR NOT
An unspoken tenet of engineering is this: data are our stock in trade, our coin of 
the realm. It has immense value: it points us to the truth, it comforts us in times of 
uncertainty. It can have an enormous impact on our lives. And it can steer us in the 
correct direction to solve our technical problems, bringing about personal and orga￾nizational success. For all engineers, data are keenly important. And when correctly 
analyzed, it will set us free. Yes, data are our friend.
Until it’s not.
3.3.1  Statistics and the Scientific Method
Statistics (that branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, inter￾pretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data) is a wonderful tool, a con￾stant companion who gently and earnestly shows us the way. No agenda, no hidden 
advantage to be gained: statistics provide comfort and counsel when needed most. 
Statistics is an important and useful means to understand cause and effect relation￾ships, significant differences, and give confidence to the user in that whatever is 
being measured is meaningful. Statistics has been around an awfully long time, and 
new techniques and ideas are constantly being incorporated into the field. For engi￾neers, statistics may also be a satisfying topic. It’s rare that one can do a calculation Embracing a New Mindset 45
and come away with a 95% (or 90% or even 98%) confidence level that what you 
measured is the truth. How can we not like this?
Unfortunately, statistics can also be a troublesome friend.
For me, statistics has been my trustworthy indicator of reality and truthfulness. 
Using formulas and mathematical concepts studied intensely by mathematical wiz￾ards over the course of decades: of course I’m going to go with it. Yet as time goes 
on, hints of doubts about statistics have begun to appear. One early doubt came from 
the work of the American author Mark Twain, who famously joked:
Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in 
which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: 
“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”3
Cute, and essentially harmless, especially considering its age.
Yet a growing issue of much more importance comes from today’s application of 
statistical techniques to scientific research and its reporting, especially in medical 
studies. Let’s consider the scientific method. Applying statistical methods to experi￾ments normally consists of five phases:
1) Design of the experiment
2) Selection of the statistical technique to be applied
3) Data collection and application of the selected technique to the data set
4) Interpretation of the statistical result
5) Reporting of the result
A simple search in Google Scholar under “statistical errors and research” yields page 
after page of statistical errors in all forms of science, medicine, software engineer￾ing, public health, and essentially every facet of research that relies on numerical 
analysis.
There seem to be two main issues in the application of this method. The first 
is misapplication, the unintended selection and usage of incorrect statistical tech￾niques in research papers, PhD dissertations and the like. Selection of a statisti￾cal technique is a minefield of error-producing choices. Fundamentally, in selecting 
which statistical method to apply, there is literally no limit to the techniques avail￾able. Without tight boundaries or ground rules surrounding the method to be used, 
an entire universe of answers can be generated, all of them correct per se for the 
individual technique, but none of them matching when compared against each other. 
Valid results are strictly contingent on technique.
The second issue is in the purposeful selection of certain data (cherry-picking)
to drive the analysis toward a certain premeditated, desired result (bias). Sadly, an 
important contributing cause to bias is some scientist’s desire to report new, block￾buster results representing breakthrough research, be it correct or not.
Another concern is replicability, both in direct reproducibility (same data, same 
analysis) and in robustness to different analytic approaches (same data, differ￾ent analyses). Supporting case examples are common and are increasingly being 46 Navigating the Engineering Organization
reported due to the transparency created by the digital commons. Case Example 3.1 
is a synopsis several examples of misapplication or bias in experimental statistical 
application. Medical research examples are chosen here as truth in medical research 
is incredibly important (people can die due to incorrect results) and the scientific 
method is held in very high regard.
CASE EXAMPLE 3.1 MISAPPLICATION AND BIAS 
WITHIN RECENT MEDICAL STATISTICAL STUDIES
There are scores of medical research studies addressing statistical misapplica￾tion and bias. This case example merely reports a brief sampling of current 
exemplars in the medical field.
Data Don’t Lie, But They Can Lead Scientists to Opposite Conclusions
A research team led by the European School of Management and Technology 
asked 29 independent statistical analysts to analyze a single research question. 
While the data provided to each analyst was identical, each of the 29 was free 
to choose whatever analysis techniques they believed were valid. The research 
team reported that no two analysts employed exactly the same method, and 
none got the same results. This included statistically significant effects in 
opposite directions for the same research question.
The problem was not that any of the analyses were “wrong” in any objective 
sense. The differences arose because researchers chose different definitions of 
what they were studying and applied different techniques. Common factors 
contributing to this problem include a simplistic reliance on “statistical signifi￾cance,” where a statistically significant result must have odds better than 1 in 
20, meaning many “meaningful” results are wrong just by chance. Other fac￾tors contributing to false results include small sample sizes, poorly designed 
studies, researchers’ cherry-picking their data, analyst’s bias, confirmation 
of pet theories, and financial interests. In short, general readers of scientific 
results (including engineers) should remember the method chosen to analyze 
scientific data directly influences the experimental results.4
Same Data, Opposite Results? A Call to Improve Surgical 
Database Research
According to the Journal of the AMA, Christopher Childers and Melinda Maggard￾Gibbon contend there is a current explosion of new clinically based medical stud￾ies, driven by the easy availability of digital registry data which can feed statistical 
programs in seconds, answering a broad range of questions. But:
The limitations are also well known: because the data are observational, 
they may be prone to bias from selection or confounding. In the absence of Embracing a New Mindset 47
randomized data, clinicians often rely on database research to…. make patient 
care decisions. With increased use of database research, greater caution must be 
exercised in terms of how it is performed and documented.
In short, researchers use data for a statistical study because it’s available, not 
because it’s necessarily appropriate.5
Statistics Misapplication and Countermeasures 
in Medical Papers Preparation
Statistical misapplication is not limited to just North America. Researchers in 
Wuhan, China, determined the main causes of numerical misapplication in 
medical research design, material description, and analysis in medical papers 
mainly are:
a) Violation of randomization, control, replication and equalization principles
b) Inappropriate material description
c) Misused statistical methods, regardless of the characteristics of the 
data
d) Confusion in statistical and practical meanings when explaining results.
They write:
[In] conclusion…. medical researchers should strengthen their learning on sta￾tistic theory and improve the ability of transforming practical issues into statis￾tical issues.6
Statistical Errors in Medical Research – A Review of Common Pitfalls
Strasak et al. bluntly state that statistical standards in medical research are 
generally low. An ever-growing body of evidence points to continuing statis￾tical errors, flaws, and deficiencies in most medical journals. Strasak argues 
that these statistical pitfalls occur at different stages in the scientific process, 
ranging from planning a study, conducting statistical analysis, documenting 
the statistical techniques used, presenting the data, and interpreting the study 
results. Strasak states:
Statisticians should be involved early in study design, as mistakes at this point 
can have major repercussions, negatively affecting all subsequent stages of med￾ical research. Consideration of issues discussed in this paper, when planning, 
conducting and preparing medical research manuscripts, should help further 
enhance statistical quality in medical journals.7
Poor Scientific Methods May Be Hereditary
In 1962, the scientist Jacob Cohen investigated under what conditions a sci￾entific study would detect a real effect. He estimated most studies would have 48 Navigating the Engineering Organization
detected a meaningful effect only about 20% of the time, yet on examination 
nearly all studies reported significant results. Cohen concluded these scientists 
were not reporting their unsuccessful research. He also suggested some papers 
were actually reporting false positives, i.e., noise that looked like data.
Today, results don’t look much better. Recently, Paul Smaldino and Richard 
McElreath showed that repeatability in published studies in psychology, neu￾roscience, and medicine is little better than it was in 1962. Their 2015 study 
focused on the ability to repeat another researcher’s experimental test result 
reliability. Their experiment was to employ over 200 researchers in the field of 
psychology to repeat 100 published studies to see if the results of these could 
be reproduced. Only 36% could.8
Ideally, everything would be put into context and statistics would be used 
honestly, but until then it’s wise to reflect critically on statistical studies on 
complex subjects such as cancer research.
So, statistics or numbers don’t lie. Yet they do. As engineers, statistical test￾ing is the one technique we put our faith into, and that faith is being shaken.
The key is to know what the numbers mean or don’t mean, to know their 
sources, their origin, and what they really convey. This is hard and certainly 
not convenient, but necessary.
3.3.2 Partnering Qualitative Data with the Quantitative
The supremacy of hard, numerically based data is one of the pillars of the engi￾neering world. Best summed up by the common saying “What is measured is 
real,” the solid foundation of high-quality quantitative data is a reassuring and 
constant belief within any engineer’s mind. It defines our reality and our “truth.” 
And surprisingly, a universal source of highly valuable data is overwhelm￾ingly ignored in the engineer’s life, that of qualitative insight. Qualitative data 
is defined as information that is normally described in prose that focuses on 
insight, action, belief, and values. To have full understanding of any engineering 
problem, any technical concern, then both quantitative and qualitative data must 
be considered in tandem. To borrow from medicine, quantitative data is the skel￾eton, the “bones” of the situation, while qualitative data is the meat on the bones 
that fleshes out the complete picture.
Why isn’t qualitative data applied more in engineering? The reasons are sim￾ple: it’s hard, time-consuming, and expensive. Qualitative data is collected by 
ethnographic means, which are normally interview-based and observational, and 
collected in prose. And qualitative data are slow to arrive. Very few commercial 
engineering firms are willing to spend the money and wait for a substantial time 
to receive the results. And even if qualitative data is provided, engineers will first 
assume that qualitative data can indeed be converted to a quantitative representa￾tion, and second, they can apply simplifying assumptions to analyze the data as Embracing a New Mindset 49
required by management timing or other desires. Remember, time and money is 
everything in any firm, including engineering, so ethnographic data are rarely used 
in our profession. The nearest thing an engineer may use is marketing or survey data 
converted into numerical representations. This is not qualitative data. An example of 
the differences between of quantitative and qualitative data is demonstrated in Case 
Example 3.2.
CASE EXAMPLE 3.2 RICHNESS OF QUALITATIVE 
DATA TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING
Take the example of a capstone engineering course at a major national-level 
engineering school. This course requires all students to provide certain bio￾graphical information to create an overall description of the class. Two types 
of data were obtained. The first (Type 1) lends itself to numerical analysis; the 
second (Type 2) is more qualified in nature. Both types were obtained from a 
standardized questionnaire as follows:
Case Example 3.2 Type 1 and Type 2 Data Questions
Type 1 Student Data:
• Name:
• Place of birth (Country / Region):
• Education:
• High School (Secondary) Education
• Where? (Country / Region)
• When?
• Undergraduate and Graduate Education (as applicable)
• Current University Level
• Where? (Country / Region)
• When?
• Major / Field?
Type 2 Student Data:
• Affiliations and Professional / Work Experience
• What? (Industry / Organization / Position)
• Where (Country / Region)?
• When?
• Notable Experience Related to Either Educational or Professional Areas
• Other Information the Professor Should Know

yielding a very precise and satisfying result. Now let’s look at our Type 2 data:50 Navigating the Engineering Organization

Now we’re really getting someplace. Whereas Type One data is clean and lends 
itself nicely to graphical analysis, the qualitative data is messy but very rich in under￾standing. Simple inspection shows many class members had significant internships 
during their university career. Many had traveled a long distance for their intern￾ships, such as to Europe, South America, and Asia. Others have taken internships in 
non-engineering areas such as financial services in New York City, pediatric health, 
and even Imagineering at Disney World in Florida.
Qualitative data is unparalleled in developing insight. This means as a new engi￾neer, you will need to develop a way to deal with this messy and undisciplined data. 
It takes time and a lot of effort to make sense of information like this, but you must 
eventually develop this skill by searching out assignments and (more rarely) ethno￾graphic training. It takes time and effort.
In short, quantitative data alone only provides a basic framework for understand￾ing a problem or analyzing a situation. For true insight, you must also use qualita￾tive data in equal or greater measure. While your early assignments will be almost 
exclusively quantitative in nature, fairly soon you will be given tasks that begin to 
involve some combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. And the time to 
start learning this skill is now. Having the patience, openness and proper mindset to 
handle softer qualitative information, melding it to the quantitative, is a necessary 
prerequisite to becoming a fully developed professional.
3.4 THE FALLACY OF THE OPTIMUM ANSWER
As mentioned above, we are all taught in engineering that there is one, and only one, 
optimum answer to every problem. That if we try hard enough, really put our backs 
into it, we can develop and identify not only an adequate answer to a problem but 
also the single, best answer possible. If we just increase the accuracy of our measure￾ments, if we define a constant to seven decimal points as opposed to just two, if we 
just have one more little bit of information, we can achieve that optimum answer. 
And reaching that optimum answer in itself is not enough. There is a second goal: 
reaching the best answer in the most efficient manner possible. What we want is to 
follow a straight line to the optimum answer, with little or no deviation from this path 54 Navigating the Engineering Organization
of righteousness. The single best answer, obtained by the most efficient technique 
possible: that is our definition of success as taught to us.
Peter Bradford, a chief engineer at a major manufacturing multinational, tackles 
this point when coaching new engineers joining his department:
There’s a couple of slides I like to show [new] engineers on what is a plan and what is 
reality. The first slide shows “the plan”, which is a drawing of someone on a bicycle 
following a straight, level path with a finish line flag dead ahead. That’s the plan. The 
next slide shows the reality. It shows the bike as much further away from the flag. It’s 
planted behind a pit full of rocks, followed by a river you have to cross. Then there’s 
another concrete barricade you have to climb over, followed by a deeper river. Then 
another deeper pit with a ladder going up the far side. Heading uphill, you find at the 
finish line a fake flag, and there’s a rainstorm overhead. And don’t forget the guy stand￾ing at the pole holding a clipboard and saying “What took you so long?” That’s reality. 
Oh, and don’t forget when you asked the finance people for the budget, they only gave 
you 80% of what you need.
A plan is like what military commanders say about waging war. The first causality in 
any war is the plan.9
Answers are never optimum. They only approach optimal by varying degrees. No 
one really has available the perfect information to achieve those optimum answers. 
And no path to this imperfect answer is straightforward. The path is circuitous, wind￾ing its way through the environment and can only be guessed at when beginning the 
solution process. If you can bake into your plan these realities (aka contingencies) 
you stand a much better chance of setting the correct expectations with your manage￾ment and fellow colleagues. Another way to say it is “get real.”
3.5 THE PARADIGM AND THE PARADOX
A key reality in engineering organizations is the continuous presence of paradox and 
new paradigms permeating the technical field. A paradox is a contradictory situation 
or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be actually true. A 
paradigm is a mental framework of understanding in which theories, hypotheses, or 
generalizations are created and accepted, resulting in a certain belief system. This 
system can sometimes be so strong as to overwhelm contrary facts that are obvious 
to others, but not to the belief holder. A paradigm shift is when that belief changes.
As a new engineer, both paradoxes and paradigms can significantly impact your 
view of reality, and your mind must be trained to both recognize a paradigm shift 
when it is occurring and become comfortable with resolving continuous paradoxes.
Let’s talk first about paradigms and where they might be found through the use 
of a few examples.
3.5.1  The Paradigm
As just stated, a paradigm is a belief system, a set of ideas. Paradigms are ubiquitous 
and have been in existence since humans first climbed out of the primal ooze. They Embracing a New Mindset 55
are powerful, and it is no exaggeration they have the capability of governing life or 
death. And a paradigm shift can instantaneously change from a docile entity into a 
powerfully different creature impacting all who come into contact with it.
As we all know, at 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, the British ocean liner Titanic
sank on its maiden voyage between Southampton, UK, and New York City. Over 
the next four hours an estimated 1,517 passengers and crew died before help arrived. 
Investigations proved the Titanic slammed into a large iceberg at 23 knots, mortally 
damaging a ship advertised as “unsinkable.” Contributing causes to the deaths were 
not enough lifeboats for the number of people onboard, a goal to set a world speed 
record between the two cities, and a sailing route away from normal shipping lanes. 
But another cause of the heavy loss of life involved something else:
We can also say another cause of the heavy fatalities was an unseen paradigm shift. 
The passengers and crew on the Titanic overlooked the possibility that the iceberg 
could have been their lifeboat. Newspapers estimated the size of the iceberg to be 50 - 
100 feet high and 200 - 400 feet long. Titanic was navigable for a while and could have 
pulled aside the iceberg. Many people could have climbed aboard it to find flat places 
to stay out of the water for the four hours before help arrived. Fixated on the fact that 
icebergs sink ships, people overlooked the size and shape of the iceberg, plus the fact 
that it would not sink.10
The paradigm visible to the passengers and crew was simple: humans need a boat to 
survive in the near-32-degree water of the North Atlantic. The operating paradigm 
can be summarized simply as “Iceberg Bad, Ship Good.” But what the passengers 
and crew overlooked was the possibility that a new paradigm was in play, as in 
Figure 3.2.
As the unfortunate souls discovered that evening, paradigms tend to be invisible 
to those within them, yet obvious to others outside the paradigm. People hold tightly 
to their paradigms, even when it is obviously against their own best interest. When 
presented with overwhelming evidence that a paradigm is no longer valid, people

FIGURE 3.2 Comparison of Titanic paradigms. 56 Navigating the Engineering Organization
(especially those with a large stake in its truthfulness) will not abandon it. Yet the 
instant a paradigm changes, the people supporting the previous paradigm become in 
the “wrong” and their paradigm becomes immediately irrelevant.
The presence of paradigms is not limited to human psychological situations only. 
Paradigms are a critical factor in pure and applied science. In his seminal book The 
Structure of Scientific Revolutions, author Thomas Kuhn applies the paradigm effect 
to the sciences and mathematics.
In his book, Kuhn argues that science does not progress via a linear accumulation 
of new knowledge but undergoes periodic revolutions (read “paradigm shifts”) where 
the nature of scientific inquiry within a particular field is abruptly transformed.
Kuhn pointed out the common pitfall of scientific experimentation, where during 
a period of normal science, the failure of a result to conform to an existing paradigm 
is seen not as refuting the paradigm but as the mistake of the researcher. As these 
nonconforming results build up, the science reaches a crisis at which point to a new 
paradigm, which replaces the old framework, is accepted.
Kuhn’s work has been applied extensively and is credited as a foundational force 
behind the sociology of scientific knowledge. In fact, an annual international award, 
the Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award honors those who present original views 
that are at odds with mainstream scientific understanding.11
A good question at this point is: can paradigm shifts really impact your work 
as an engineer? Consider this. Remember, a paradigm is a predetermined way of 
thinking, a framework containing the basic assumptions, methods of thinking, and 
methodology that are commonly accepted by members of a community, say, an engi￾neering society. It is a cognitive framework shared by members of any discipline or 
group. For you it might be your company’s technology development plan: the plan is 
a paradigm. A paradigm contains orderly and predictable assumptions regarding the 
holder’s beliefs and understandings. It is a reassuring way of thinking.
Let’s consider a recent paradigm shift, resulting in the fundamental alteration 
of manufacturing thinking in the United States from the 20th century into the 21st, 
both destroying and creating billions of dollars of company value in just a few short 
months.
CASE EXAMPLE 3.3 PARADIGM SHIFT IGNORED: 
THE U.S. AUTO BAILOUT OF 2008–2010
The rescue of the U.S. automobile industry amid the 2008–2010 financial cri￾sis was a highly consequential, controversial, and difficult decision made at a 
critical moment for the U.S. economy. General Motors and Chrysler (the pre￾cursor to Stellantis), two of the largest industrial companies in the world, were 
both on the edge of simultaneous, unprecedented bankruptcies. Each sought a 
financial rescue from the U.S. government involving tens of billions of dollars.
In the years prior to this financial crises, total vehicle sales plummeted 
to below 10 million from a peak of more than 17 million just a few years 
earlier, causing the “Big Three” U.S. automakers to record some of the worst Embracing a New Mindset 57
corporate performances in American history. General Motors (GM) alone lost 
almost $40 billion in 2007 and another $31 billion in 2008. Ford lost $3 billion 
and then $15 billion; Chrysler also lost comparable amounts of money.
By the fall of 2008, the automakers’ financial situation was so dire that they 
would soon be unable to even make their payroll, let alone pay their suppli￾ers. In November of 2008, the CEOs of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler 
requested from the U.S. Congress a $25 billion “bridge loan” to make these 
payments and avoid bankruptcy. In the CEOs’ minds, the crisis centered on 
major economic forces outside of their control (such as customers’ lack of 
access to credit) as the core reason for destroying their business.
This was ostrich thinking.
The Big Three had generations-old issues of high cost, questionable qual￾ity, and other factors contributing to the industry’s problems, yet the CEOs 
argued that they had already done all the restructuring necessary to fix those 
problems: the automakers themselves were no longer an issue. In reality, the 
Big Three’s problems had built up over many years and were certainly not 
caused only by the downturn. For example, falling demand was a severe prob￾lem. There was a sustained downward trend in demand of over 2 percentage 
points per year for the combined automakers. The Big Three’s market share 
in 1998 was 71 percent; by 2008, it was 47 percent. Hiding this problem was 
substantial price discounting relative to their overseas competition: by 2008 
the Big Three were discounting comparable cars by $2,000 to $3,000. Other 
factors had also taken a toll on the new car demand, such as perennial quality 
and reliability issues, lower resale values, poorly received new models, and a 
dearth of high gas mileage vehicles.
Still another headwind was the increasing domestic U.S. production 
of foreign-owned companies like Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and others who 
were expanding production in the United States, using predominantly non￾union plants in the American South. From 2000 to 2013, employment at the 
domestic transplant carmakers almost doubled to 163,000, while Big Three 
employment was cut nearly in half to 253,000. Additionally, the Big Three 
automakers were paying overall labor costs almost 45 percent higher than 
the transplants. Many concluded the problems of the Big Three automakers 
were particular to those firms and not fundamental to the national automo￾tive industry.
In short, the Big Three’s problems included long-term falling market share, 
a massive short-term drop in vehicle demand, and large fixed costs resulting in 
huge short-term losses. And even if they could reduce their fixed costs, when 
the recession ended and demand returned, the continuing decline in market 
share meant the automakers would soon be back in trouble, as no one knew 
if the prior sales levels of 17 million vehicles would ever return. If demand 
rebounded only partway after the recession ended, it was not clear that all the 
Big Three automakers could survive.58 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Simply speaking, the Big Three were living in the automotive paradigm of 
the 20th century, where failure to address systemic problems could be ignored 
and rely instead on yearly record sales levels to “kick the can down the road.” 
The new 21st-century paradigm of an entirely new business model exposed 
the lie.
The future became even more frightening as various governmental solu￾tions were proposed and rejected. For example, in Washington at a critical 
meeting of the National Economic Council, members held a straw vote on 
whether the Council believed Chrysler would survive for five years if a govern￾ment-supported merger with Fiat went through. The Council voted no.
But the final decision-maker on what to do was not the Council but the 
President of the United States, Barack Obama. Obama weighed the economic 
arguments as well as the political, financial, and social realities. The admin￾istration determined it was essential to rescue GM to prevent an uncontrolled 
bankruptcy and failure of countless suppliers, potentially destroying the entire 
U.S. auto industry. Yet the failure of the much smaller Chrysler would prob￾ably not have dire effects for the whole industry, even though Chrysler’s fail￾ure would cause considerable individual hardship. With this thinking, Obama 
choose to rescue GM as a stand-alone company, but also rescue Chrysler with 
the express intent to merge it with the automobile manufacturer Fiat, creating 
a new company.
If GM and Chrysler had been allowed to fail, in all likelihood the Great 
Recession would have been deeper and longer, and the recovery that began 
in mid-2009 would have been much weaker. The rescue was more success￾ful than almost anyone predicted at the time. Some of this success resulted 
from actions the auto companies took; others happened because the rebound 
in consumer demand for autos was especially strong during the next five years, 
meaning the auto industry turned out to be one of the drivers of the economic 
recovery. A combined paradigm shift of the U.S. automakers, the federal gov￾ernment, and the financial markets saved the North American auto industry.
It’s interesting to mention the Ford Motor Company’s actions during this 
time. Ford decided not to take any government support like GM and Chrysler, 
but to “go it alone” financially. Ford had large losses in 2006 but had already 
borrowed a significant amount of money in advance and begun restructuring 
before the financial crisis struck, so the company was able to withstand the 
cash crunch. (An interesting side note: By not taking any government funds, 
Ford’s reputation as a true “up by their bootstraps, all-American” company 
was greatly enhanced. Ford gleaned substantial, unexpected market share and 
unmeasured goodwill by this approach.)
So, what did the leaders of the Big Three learn about paradigm shifts and 
their failure to recognize them?
First, the Big Three lost their power to decide their own future. Second, 
they did not have the tools in hand to control the path of the crisis even if they Embracing a New Mindset 59
did have the power. Third, they were lucky, at least some were: Chrysler was 
absorbed by Fiat soon afterward and ceased to be a stand-alone automobile 
manufacturer.
The U.S. government also learned. Economic analysis provided key insights 
into the decision to rescue and restructure GM and Chrysler. That decision 
was risky. While those involved gathered all the information available and 
attempted to place the companies on a sustainable footing, they certainly did 
not know if it would work. More importantly the administration, living outside 
the automotive bubble, was clearly able to take the necessary actions to change 
the paradigm. As Obama summarized in 2015:
There was clear-eyed recognition that the auto companies couldn’t sustain busi￾ness as usual. That’s what made this successful. If it had been just about put￾ting more money in without restructuring these companies, we would have seen 
perhaps some of the bleeding slowed but we wouldn’t have cured the patient.
In other words, the willingness to abandon the “normal” way of solving an 
economic crisis and rapidly embrace truly innovative methods without para￾lyzing fear was key in saving these two firms.
Finally, Ford was able to weather the economic downturn and resulting 
financial crisis because it had taken proactive, anticipatory steps to restructure 
early. Ford had seen the paradigm had changed. That GM and Chrysler did not 
is a lesson about the importance of management seeing and acting on these 
shifts. The bailout’s ultimate success does not undermine the reality that the 
failure of seeing and dealing with a major paradigm shift can destroy entire 
industries.12

3.5.2  The Paradox
A paradox is different than a paradigm. A paradox is a set of “contradictory yet 
interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.”13
Like paradigms, the paradox exists everywhere, not just in the world of engineer￾ing or technology, but in any and every portion of our lives. Paradox has existed for 
centuries and is common in all aspects of our being. And everyone must face the 
cogitative dissonance of resolving two opposing facts or conditions simultaneously: 
we cannot escape it.
Everyone has their favorite paradoxes; you may have already heard some of these:
The Paradox of the Pessimist
The paradox of the pessimist is well known. A pessimist sees something in its most 
negative light, while an optimist perceives things in its most positive condition. 
Invariably, things are not as bad as the pessimist sees nor as good as the optimist 
would like to experience. Therefore, the pessimist’s poor expectations are normally 60 Navigating the Engineering Organization
exceeded, while the optimist’s overreaching positive expectations are normally 
dashed. So, the pessimist is fundamentally happy while the optimist is eternally 
disappointed.
The Epimenides Paradox
There are many versions of the Epimenides Paradox, some of which going back 
thousands of years. Epimenides was an ancient Cretan philosopher from the island 
of Knossos who made the immortal statement: “All Cretans are liars.” The paradox 
is that Epimenides himself was a Cretan: if all Cretans are liars, then Epimenides is 
also a liar. And if Epimenides is a liar, then the statement “all Cretans are liars” must 
be a lie, which would mean all Cretans tell the truth, which means Epimenides tells 
the truth, which means the statement “all Cretans are liars” is both true and false. 
Epimenides the Cretan saying all Cretans are liars is the fundamental paradox.
The Paradox of Promotion
A more current example is the Paradox of Promotion. The business literature lists a 
number of definitions of this paradox. For this discussion, we’ll define the Paradox of 
Promotion as when you or another employee, through hard work and conscientious￾ness, finally receives what you have been working for: a promotion to the next level. 
To your surprise, you quickly find that the vast number of skills you have learned and 
honed to this point are now instantaneously obsolete. Yes, obsolete. The skills that 
get you to a certain level are not the skills that you immediately need to keep you 
there. What results is a scramble to quickly find and apply skills that many times are 
not engineering or technically based, but instead grounded in social or management 
practice.
Take the example of Derek McAllister, a five-year materials engineer who in 
the last several years has shown the characteristics his management values in a 
first-level supervisor. One day Derrick’s manager calls him to a conference room 
and announces, “Congratulations, you are now the supervisor for the Willowcreek 
Advanced Materials project. Go ahead and introduce yourself to the group, find out 
what’s going on, and begin to draft a development plan assuming a two-year prod￾uct lifecycle. I need to see it in about three days.” Derek is shocked. How will he 
approach his new group, understand their needs, and provide a realistic development 
plan when he doesn’t even know how to deal with the variety of engineers he believes 
make up his group? Unfortunately, Derrick’s training as a materials engineer is of no 
use in handling this immediate assignment, or, in Derek’s eyes, this crisis. Derek is 
left to fumble about as he attempts to fulfill his management’s direction. And he will 
be fumbling for at least the next six months as he attempts to train himself for this 
position. Welcome to the paradox of promotion.
The Sigmoid Curve
The Sigmoid Curve is an S-shaped curve which describes an organization’s perfor￾mance over time. In engineering, it is the story of a product’s lifecycle or a corpora￾tion’s rise and fall, or even the arc of your own career. First described as a concept 
for businesses and organizations by Charles Handy, the curve’s X-axis is time while Embracing a New Mindset 61

FIGURE 3.3 Sigmoid Curve representation of organizational performance. 
the Y-axis is whatever performance measure chosen, say, the market share growth of 
an engineering design business. Whatever measure is selected, the curve starts flat, 
then accelerates upward until a maximum is reached, then flattens out and begins a 
shallow decline as shown in Figure 3.3.
As Handy shares in his book The Empty Raincoat: Making Sense of the Future, 
the impact of the Sigmoid Curve on your organization is a paradox:
The secret of constant growth is to start a new Sigmoid Curve before the first one 
peters out. The right place to start that second curve is at point A, where there is the 
time, as well as the resources and the energy, to get the new curve through its initial 
explorations and flounderings before the first curve begins to dip downwards. That 
would seem obvious; were it not for the fact that at point A all the messages coming 
through to the … institution are that everything is going fine, that it would be folly to 
change when the current recipes are working so well. All that we know of change, be 
it personal change or change in organizations, tells us that the real energy for change 
only comes when you are looking at disaster in the face, at point B on the first curve. At 
this point, however, it is going to require a mighty effort to drag oneself up to where, by 
now, one should be on the second curve. To make it worse, the current leaders are now 
discredited because they are seen to have led the organization down the hill, where 
resources are depleted and energies are low.…
Wise are they who start the second curve at point A, because that is the pathway 
through paradox, the way to build a new future while maintaining the present. Even 
then, however, the problems do not end. The second curve … is going to be noticeably 
different from the old. It has to be. The people also have to be different. Those who 
lead the second curve are not going to be the people who lead the first curve. For one 
thing, the continuing responsibility of those original leaders is to keep that first curve 
going long enough to support the early stages of the second curve. For another, they 
will find it temperamentally difficult to abandon their first curve while it is doing so 
well.… For a time, therefore, new ideas and new people have to coexist with the old 62 Navigating the Engineering Organization
until the second curve is established and the first begins to wane. The area beneath the 
peak is, therefore, a time of great confusion. Two groups of people, or more, and two 
sets of ideas are competing for the future. No matter how wise and benevolent they 
be, the leaders of the first curve must worry about their own futures when their curve 
begins to die. It requires great foresight, and even greater magnanimity, to foster others 
and plan one’s own departure or demise. Those who can do it, however, will ensure the 
renewal and the continued growth of their organization.14
There is the paradox: at the height of success, change and begin again.
The Paradox of Choice
Another favorite paradox is described in The Paradox of Choice – Why More Is Less, 
a book written by American psychologist Barry Schwartz. Schwartz argues that elimi￾nating choices can greatly increase a person’s happiness by reducing their anxiety. The 
book analyzes the behavior of different types of people (in particular, “maximizers” 
and “satisfiers”) who face an overwhelming number of decisions. Schwartz demonstrates 
how the dramatic explosion in choice challenges our ability to balance career, family, and 
individual needs, paradoxically becoming a problem instead of a solution. In short, our 
obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.
Specifically, Schwartz contends:
Autonomy and freedom of choice are critical to our well-being, and choice is critical 
to freedom and autonomy. Nonetheless, though modern Americans have more choice 
than any group of people ever has before, and thus, presumably, more freedom and 
autonomy, we don't seem to be benefiting from it psychologically.
Thus, the growth of options and opportunities for choice has three, related, unfortu￾nate effects: it means that decisions require more effort, it makes mistakes more likely 
and makes the psychological consequences of mistakes more severe.
Of course, Schwartz could be talking about engineers. After all, our core job is to 
select the optimum choice from many and demonstrate why that choice is correct. 
With the explosion of data, information, and resulting choice options, we can easily 
become overwhelmed. As Schwartz argues in this paradox, less is more.15
The Paradox of Crisis
“Never let a good crisis go to waste” has become a popular saying in commer￾cial companies, government circles, and other organizations ever since the Great 
Recession of 2008–2009. First spoken by Winston Churchill during World War Two, 
the quote remerged when uttered by Rahm Emanual, Chief of Staff to President 
Barack Obama, during his first term:
You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportu￾nity to do things that you think you could not do before.
The paradox is, rather than avoiding or fleeing a severe crisis, embrace it as an oppor￾tunity. The underlying idea is simple: a crisis makes a company’s normal operating 
rules irrelevant. New assumptions and guidelines must be developed immediately. Embracing a New Mindset 63
And whoever sets those rules controls what will happen next and what will be the 
ultimate outcome. A crisis radically changes the game, so opportunities abound.16
So what do all these examples tell us? These paradoxes are a preview of coming 
attractions. From the moment you begin your professional life, you will be continu￾ously presented with conflicting choices. It doesn’t matter if it is strictly technical, 
strictly personnel, or any combination: becoming at ease with the uncertainty the 
paradox brings when dealing with two contradictory ideas simultaneously is the 
goal. In a word, embrace the ambiguity.
3.6 AND JUST WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
And now the trouble begins.
To be honest, this next section may cause some heartburn. The territory we are 
about to cover does not come naturally to anyone, never mind someone steeped in 
the science, mathematics and precision of engineering. Yet in many ways, this sec￾tion holds the key to crossing the Great Divide. Of course, who we’re talking about 
is the reader of this book and consumer of this information.
This section will focus on “who you are”: your view of yourself as a single indi￾vidual and how your perceptions are the key to fitting within your organization.
Why have a section on who you are? Why does that matter? After all, what mat￾ters is your technical prowess as the driver of success in the workplace. Isn’t the abil￾ity to analyze complex technical puzzles and arrive at the correct answer in record 
time the goal? Perhaps, but the simple question of who you are is critical in establish￾ing the necessary mindset on entering your new professional home. Because your 
mindset, as the filter that establishes your personal view of reality, must reasonably 
match the actual environment you perform within each day. If reality and mindset 
don’t match, trouble results.
Thus, the simple question of “And just who are you, anyway?” becomes one of the 
key inquiries we need to ponder at this point of our time together.
Knowing who you are is a fundamental requirement of all new engineers (and, 
indeed, all successful employees). What is reality to you is actually the result of 
the “sifter” your mind uses to help make sense of the world. Knowing who you are 
helps us to figure out which filters are operating; to discover and analyze just what is 
going on around you. This is not an easy task for anyone, and is an even tougher job 
when attempted by anyone unfamiliar with the process. After all, most of us have 
been taught throughout our entire school life that facts are facts; there is little room 
left for subjectivity, perception, belief, values, or similar thoughts. Yet knowing who 
you are is a fundamental insight for current and future understanding, which leads to 
professional accomplishment and satisfaction.
Luckily, there are several methods to get us closer to understanding who we truly 
are. Similar to our engineering archetype exploration, a combination of methods and 
techniques allow us to approach this question from different directions and triangu￾late in on a satisfactory answer. We are going to use two different methods to help 
determine self-awareness and apply them to the object of interest, i.e., you. Let’s look 
at the first one.64 Navigating the Engineering Organization
3.6.1  Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences
Our initial task is to investigate the entire idea of intelligence and how it might apply 
to each of us. Howard Gardner’s seminal book Frames of Mind: The Theory of 
Multiple Intelligences has had a major effect on understanding human intelligence, 
especially in the area of education in the United States.17
Gardner is a developmental psychologist, who in the 1990s developed a new way 
of thinking about human nature. Gardner contends that each of us are a unique com￾bination of many “intelligences” (or what you and I might call “talents”) that are 
not generally measured in traditional education. Here, Gardner defines intelligence 
as “the capacity to solve problems or to fashion products that are valued in one or 
more cultural settings.” He posits that intelligence is not a single entity nor can it be 
measured solely from IQ tests. Instead, he uses eight “markers” or signs of intelli￾gence that subsequently create a fusion of personal characteristics. These eight intel￾ligences are defined in Table 3.1.

The first two markers are the typical subjects valued in schools. The next four are 
linked to the arts and the last two are called “personal intelligences.”
It’s not much of a surprise that I’m going to ask you to download the Gardner 
Multiple Intelligences evaluation instrument and complete the evaluation. After all, 
we’re on a quest for self-awareness and insight here, and this is foundational work all 
of us need to know. So, please take a moment and take the assessment. You can find it 
on your favorite search engine under keywords “Gardner,” “Multiple Intelligences,” 
or similar phrases.
These 8 categories are useful to begin to understand yourself and your particular 
talents. Ideally, it would also be helpful to have this assessment as a tool to help 
understand your colleagues and co-workers (provided your workgroup also takes the 
evaluation, which is not likely). Unlike our archetype engineer who is an amalgam 
of characteristics, the Gardner model is applied to yourself and other individuals on 
a more targeted level.
Experience has shown that the Gardner evaluation can uncover some interest￾ing intelligences of coworkers, allowing us to develop some “shorthand” sketches 
of types of people you may encounter along the way. Case Example 3.4 shares an 
experience about one person’s store of intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligence, 
or lack thereof.
CASE EXAMPLE 3.4 THE STORY OF TOM TIMID
One of the surprisingly common individual types in organizations is the 
“Nervous Nelly” or “Tom Timid,” an insecure, anxious person who is uncer￾tain, easily upset, and hesitant to act autonomously in work settings. These 
people, especially as supervisors or managers, can at best cause extra work for 
you and at worst create embarrassment or distain if your work is too closely 
tied to theirs.
My favorite example of a Tom Timid in action happened several years ago. 
Our advanced engineering division was about to have its annual “all hands” 
meeting, where all members of the organization (some 400 people) gather in 
person to hear the group’s annual objectives, significant accomplishments, and 
generally get reacquainted after a year apart. (You may have gone through at 
least one of these all-hands meetings already). One of the rules of the all-hands 
(at least until COVID) was that everyone attends in person; no digital atten￾dance is allowed, as a main purpose is to reconnect face-to-face.
The manager responsible for running the meeting was a classic Tom Timid. 
Every detail had to be correct, and they were in a continuous, low-grade state 
of terror as the meeting approached. One of the topics of the meeting was a 
two-minute video clip from a popular comedy movie about a Silicon Valley 
business internship. The clip was meant to poke fun at large technical orga￾nizations and provide a little comic relief for what could be a dry technical 
meeting.66 Navigating the Engineering Organization
All was well until the day before the conference. Someone asked Tom, “Did 
you get permission from the studio to show that clip in public?” Tom froze. 
“Oh my God, we have to get permission to show this thing? How do we do 
that?” In a panic, Tom calls the company’s legal department. The attorney on 
duty gave the required answer, the only answer they could legally give: “You 
have to pay the rights to show it and it’s going to be expensive, perhaps $10,000 
or more.”
On hearing this, Tom went into nervous overdrive. Where was he going 
to get $10,000 with less than a day to go? Keep in mind the company had 
no “Department of Video Clips for Major Motion Pictures” he could go to. 
Instead, Tom had three options: one, cancel the showing; two, pay the money 
within 24 hours: or three, get somebody else to make a decision. Tom was 
loathe to cancel the showing, as his boss had specifically requested it (even 
though it was a low-importance, “nice to have” request). Tom was also scared 
to ask anyone for $10,000 on no notice, as he would blow his entire meeting 
budget and didn’t even know who to pay the money to anyway. So choice three 
is what he settled on: get somebody else to make the decision.
On talking to his team, Tom decides the only person who could make this 
decision was the global vice president of human resources, Kendra Jackson. 
At that moment, Kendra was in the corporate jet midway across the Pacific 
Ocean, headed for a company meeting with the China division. Tom places the 
call to the corporate jet.
I can’t imagine what went through Kendra’s mind as she receives an emer￾gency telephone call at 35,000 feet from a manager in full crisis mode, asking 
her to decide whether to show a movie clip or not. Obviously, this is not a vice 
president’s job, especially midway across the Pacific. Kendra, incredulous, 
said yes. (She probably also asked her Chief of Staff to not take any more of 
this manager’s telephone calls.)
And the meeting proceeded.
This “crisis” significantly disrupted last-minute planning and execution for 
the meeting. I think you all know the correct answer that was never consid￾ered: just go ahead and play the damn clip. The chances of a movie studio 
caring about a private meeting showing two minutes with no electronic con￾nections anywhere else is, at best, infinitesimally low. But Tom increased his 
own chance of having a pulmonary embolism.
So what went wrong? First, the request was in the “nice to have” category, 
not an essential part of the meeting. After all, it was a two-minute comic break 
from the main business of the meeting: it was certainly optional whether to 
show it or not. Second, the legal department was brought in. Of course, the 
company attorneys can give only one answer due to their own legal exposure: 
tell Tom he has to pay the royalty, no matter how impractical. Third, inter￾rupting the work of the global vice president midway across the ocean should 
obviously be reserved for true emergencies. Fourth, the manager should’ve just Embracing a New Mindset 67
made the decision as it was such a low-stakes question. And, fifth, precious 
preparation time was wasted chasing irrelevant apprehensions. Five errors in 
five hours: not a good use of the day.
An advance dose of intrapersonal intelligence analysis plus interpersonal 
self-understanding might have changed the outcome. Unfortunately, needed 
strengthening in these two areas wasn’t accomplished.
A postscript. Tom never changed his ways, and one day about three years 
later, Tom disappeared. Quietly and without fanfare, Tom was gone. Though 
never spoken, everyone knew the cause. Requiescat in pace.
3.6.2  The Bolling Four-Step Exploration
There is an old saying that you can’t figure out where you’re going until you know 
where you are. This adage is very appropriate at this point in our journey across the 
Divide. The entire theme of this section is to be able to answer the question posed in 
the title: Just who are you, anyway? What is your makeup as an individual and as a 
new professional? What are your values, your understandings, and your beliefs? This 
is not easy, and I’m willing to wager that most new engineers have not done this type 
of self-reflective work before, and may be reluctant to do so now.
But I’ll ask for a little slack here. Unlike Tom Timid, figuring out who you are 
and what makes you tick will pay great dividends in the near-term and even greater 
benefits in the future. Knowing yourself allows you to predict your reactions to cer￾tain work experiences and situations you may not anticipate yet. To be prepared for 
the right now; to provide insights into your behavior in relation to your co-workers 
and management, is a critical part of understanding your thought processes and emo￾tional reactions to the wide variety of situations you are about to encounter.
To that end, there is something called the Bolling Four-Step Exploration Process. 
First developed in the 1990s by Dr. G. Frederic Bolling at the University of Michigan, 
this qualitative technique is a simple and straightforward way of getting a handle on 
these questions. Please note there are also a number of other self-realization instru￾ments out there, and using those is fine also. The point here is to do this self-explor￾atory work, by whatever technique, as a necessary step in moving forward.18
Bolling outlined four distinct steps in self-discovery. Table 3.2 provides the 
method.
At this point, you’ve probably realized that the Bolling evaluation is not magical, 
merely a systematic listing and culling of who you are and what you believe you 
are, today. Don’t attempt to be what you are not: honestly find out your authentic 
self. Because, ultimately, this is really a process to search for the pattern of how 
to manage yourself in the future. And when we examine who we are, we begin to 
understand how to change in the direction we desire.
So, what do we have at this point? Including our archetype investigation tech￾niques from Chapter 2, you now have five assessment tools available to you: three 
psychological instruments (Myers-Briggs, Five-Factor, and Multiple Intelligences), 68 Navigating the Engineering Organization

Step 
One
Be determined not to look at Steps Two through Four until you finish Step One. Knowing 
the other steps does not kill this exercise, but it can influence its results.
Find a quiet room or location where you’ll be comfortable, and set aside a predetermined 
time (perhaps one hour) with no interruptions. Provide for your needs like a cup of coffee 
beforehand, and arrange in advance for a way to record your responses. Most importantly, 
adopt a calm and quiet mindset.
Your task is to think of everything you are, and write down these items in simple ways. 
Since it is you and “you know you,” a one-word description may suffice for each item. 
These can be “daughter,” “son,” “brother,” “sister,” “caregiver,” “volunteer,” “musician,” 
and so on. These should not be temporal such as “hot” or “hungry” nor moralistic, such as 
a need to be more punctual or want to exercise. There are potentially hundreds of things 
that you are; endeavor to list as many as possible.
Be honest. This is just for yourself, and you are the only one who will see this exercise.
Because you will run out of things in 10 or 12 minutes, rest a while by doing nothing and 
start again with a clear mind. Generally, you will find a trigger that leads you down other 
paths that didn’t occur to you in the first place.
Repeat this listing exercise until the hour is up and put away the list for a few days.
It is important to spend at least a full hour on Step One.

If you listed under 50 or over 80 items in Step One, you probably need to reconsider a little 
before you continue to Step Two.
A few days after completing Step One, arrange another hour for yourself alone as before.
Now classify your items. Think about how you can classify them, then create the groupings. 
Cluster everything that you can, but you can have a category of just one item if you wish. 
It is important not to evaluate your answers while you are doing the groupings.
Look at the list you generated. For example, you might be a tennis player and ride a bicycle for 
fun. You may be a singer, collect rare music recordings and are an ex-smoker. Keep creating 
groupings until you feel that everything can be set in a grouping that makes sense. Change the 
groups and change what you put into the groups until you feel satisfied that overall it makes 
sense. If you think of new things, add them. But don’t discount an item once you have thought 
of it. For example, it may seem strange to you, because it doesn’t fit with the other things that 
you have entered being an ex-smoker. However, it is an example of achievement that may be an 
important sign for you. A grouping may have only one entry and it may be important. You 
should end up with a dozen or so groupings; there may be less or there may be more. I would 
suggest that if you have fewer than eight you haven’t grouped finely enough, and if you have 
15 or more you have a group more coarsely.
Finish the hour and put the groupings away for a few days.Embracing a New Mindset 69

you want to take Step Three more than once.
Force-rank your groupings from most important to the least. The groupings don’t have to 
have titles as you know what they contain and what they are.
As a result of your force ranking, number one will be more important than number two, 
number two more important than number three, and so on. Rearrange the positions of 
the groups in the ranked list until you are satisfied.
If you feel uncomfortable putting one group either higher or lower than another, perhaps 
it is because of a particular item you included in the grouping. Rethink as necessary and 
revisit until you are satisfied that indeed number one is more important than number 
two, number two is more important than number three, and so on.
Now wait a few days for Step Four.

Step Four As before, arrange some quiet time; perhaps 30 minutes or so.
Look at your force rank list. Choose no more than the top four of the groups you have 
created, even though there are many more. Pay attention to these top four items and don’t 
worry about the others. This list is your assessment of the most important things defining 
who you are. This is your personal reference of who you are. You now have a framework 
of yourself at this moment in time, maintaining a benchmark against what you might 
change, what you want to do and how you might obtain more of what you want. Always 
question the impact of what you would like to do against these four important groupings. 
This is your personal profile and value set.
Note there are probably additional reflections about yourself below these top four that are 
also important, but these four will probably represent more than 80% of what you are in 
your own life.
Finally, keep this exercise in a place where you can reference it later.70 Navigating the Engineering Organization
3.7 THE ENGINEER AS ANTHROPOLOGIST
Now let’s share a little secret. It’s true you’ve been hired as an engineer, to do “engi￾neering stuff.” Stuff like calculating, assessing, optimizing, testing, and a myriad of 
other tasks. One of the things you may not realize you have to do is to become a cul￾tural anthropologist. For those who were not able to take anthropology at university, 
cultural anthropology is the study of societies: how humans organize their lives and 
articulate their values. More than any other way anthropology reveals what society 
means and why it matters.19
For over a century, cultural anthropologists have circled the globe, uncovering 
surprising facts and insights about how humans organize their lives and articulate 
their values. In this way, anthropologists have revealed what civilization means. 
By witnessing behaviors and weaving them together into systems, anthropologists 
develop key concepts which try to make sense of the world, from culture and values 
to authority and behavior. Anthropology matters because it helps us understand other 
points of view, and in the process reveals something about ourselves.
For new engineers, rather than studying the Chimbu Tribes of the Eastern 
Highlands of New Guinea, we need to study the equally exotic tribes living in the 
Silicon Valley of California’s central coast, or the massive cauldron of technical 
thought brewing on the eastern tip of the Yangtze River Delta at Shanghai, or the 
digital society along Israel’s central coastal plain at Tel Aviv. Or maybe understand 
the technology ideas being developed in India. Just like the anthropologist, engineers 
must study their surrounding society, using ethnographic techniques to understand 
the “civilization” around them.
Of course, if the anthropologist simile doesn’t suit you, perhaps you could take 
the view of an investigative reporter.
Just as the need to investigate who you are is also the need to investigate and 
understand what is going on in the organization surrounding you. This is not news: 
new employees have been told this for decades. One easy way to do this is to merely 
follow the dictum “be curious.” Another way is through the viewpoint of this “inves￾tigative reporter” concept. This is the kind of news reporter that digs into situations 
for clues on what has happened or what is currently happening in the environment 
around them. Investigators must then take these clues and assemble them like a 
puzzle, to understand why something happened, and, most importantly, what may
happen.
Being an anthropologist or investigative reporter is a skill that is honed over a 
substantial amount of time. It involves observing behaviors, hypothesizing why 
those behaviors occur, investigating and confirming the reasons why those behaviors 
happened, and then judging the potential future actions resulting from those actions.
Let’s take an example of this in a technical context, in this case a straight-ahead 
engineering calculation you are asked to perform. Say you are asked to determine 
the heat transfer coefficient of a new material to be placed into the motherboard of a 
new home alarm system. As extended exposure to heat could cause premature fail￾ure of the board and repeated false-positive alarms, your chief engineer has a keen 
interest in knowing how much heat the motherboard can reject over the course of a Embracing a New Mindset 71
year. Thus, your calculation is a very important quality and reliability measure of 
the entire product.
Everything goes well with your calculation. The physics of the material is well 
known. It has substantial reference information available to actually calculate the 
heat transfer coefficient, and the calculation shows ample margin for successfully 
using this material. Just to be sure, you perform a double-check of your analysis 
using a different method, and this answer is comfortably close to your initial calcula￾tion. In other words, everything looks pretty good.
With a buoyant feeling, you and your supervisor visit the chief engineer’s office 
to report these favorable results. Showing them the screen on your laptop, you 
briefly report the results and the assumptions behind the work. Instead of receiv￾ing some words of affirmation, you are instructed by the chief to recheck the result 
with another engineer and have that engineer report back to the chief independently. 
Sitting there, you are surprised, hurt, and just a touch angry that all your good work 
is being discounted. You feel a bit diminished.
Walking down the hall with your supervisor, you begin to feel more and more 
incensed and begin to believe a major injustice has been done. Back at your desk, 
you begin to question other group members about the chief. What’s wrong with this 
person? Finally, another engineer clues you in.
Two years ago on our last big project, our chief signed off on some critical code for a 
new voice-activated monitoring device. The chief trusted the engineer who wrote the 
code; after all, that engineer was very experienced and had an excellent reputation. 
Unfortunately, the monitor went into production with about 40 buggy lines. The thing 
just didn’t work as advertised and the issue got lots of play online and in customer 
reviews. We had to pull the device after only nine weeks on the market, and Consumer’s 
Report was all over it. It was a big deal. Nowadays. our chief is super gun-shy and has 
started double and triple checking everybody’s work. It’s changed them.
Suddenly, everything makes sense. With just a single question you now understand that 
your chief’s reaction had nothing to do with you, but with a bad experience that occurred 
long before you ever arrived. That’s what is meant by being an anthropologist or inves￾tigative reporter. It’s about learning the “why” of any situation you might experience so 
you may understand at a deeper level what might be going on and react accordingly.
This approach isn’t just a North American best practice. This investigative 
reporter idea has a long history in Japanese engineering practice. As described by 
Dr. Jeffrey Liker in his seminal book The Toyota Way, this method is part of kaizen, 
the Japanese business philosophy of applying continuous improvement to working 
practices and personal efficiency. This particular technique, called the Five Whys, 
became an integral part of the Toyota philosophy:
The basis of Toyota’s scientific approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a 
problem.… By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solu￾tion becomes clear.20
Simple, yet highly effective.72 Navigating the Engineering Organization
3.8 NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
Here comes more trouble.
This section addresses the controversial contention, originally made by the screen￾writer William Goldman in his book Adventures in the Screen Trade, that many of 
us find very troublesome. Goldman contends that absolute and definitive knowledge 
of any area, no matter how expert and experienced the practitioner, is impossible to 
acquire and use. He argues that at its core, any decision made in almost all sophisti￾cated and complex situations still essentially amounts to nothing more than a guess. 
As Goldman says:
The single most important fact, perhaps, of the entire movie industry:
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
Again, for emphasis:
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what’s 
going to work. Every time out it’s a guess and, if you’re lucky, an educated 
one.21
Despite its origins in the motion picture business, this pithy observation has been 
adopted by uncounted decision-makers over the decades, in all aspects of technical 
and nontechnical fields alike. It is also an alarming contention. But please be patient 
as we examine this important and counterintuitive idea.
Let’s go back and parse the original statement: absolute and definitive knowledge 
of any area, no matter how expert and experienced the practitioner, is impossible 
to acquire and use.
Absolute and definitive means just that: someone, or some group, or some 
machine has in their possession total mastery of all knowledge in a given area. Since 
this totality of knowledge is unknown and unknowable, the practitioner is never 
truly a total master; they just have varying degrees of mastery (and confidence in 
that knowledge) at any given time. Since knowledge is never absolute, mastery is 
never absolute. And if knowledge is never absolute, its acquisition and use are never 
absolute but conditional.
Let’s take Goldman’s particular profession, writing Hollywood screenplays. 
Motion pictures are complicated, fluid creations, taking years to ideate, write, film, 
edit, and distribute. Hundreds upon hundreds of professionals can work on a single 
project (just look at the credits of a single blockbuster; if you include extras, over a 
thousand names can appear). The complexity of a motion picture is enormous, and 
that doesn’t count the personalities and egos of all those involved. And don’t forget 
the main indicator of success: how many individuals buy a ticket or stream the pic￾ture. It’s safe to say, given the massive complexity and Brownian motion of the movie 
business, indeed nobody knows anything.
What about the engineering profession? Of course, we know millions of facts, and 
they are certainly true within their assumptions. But we’re not talking about those 
kinds of simple, singular facts here. We’re talking about large (even immense) proj￾ects, developments, initiatives, proposals, schemes, and enterprises that involve large 
numbers of systems, talented people, complex environments, unanticipated factors, Embracing a New Mindset 73
and all the rest. With such a minestrone soup of interrelationships, with unknown 
or irrational interactions, all wrapped up with inadequate funding, short timing, and 
uncertain goals, it’s easy to see that indeed, for us, nobody knows anything.
But what about some highly successful examples of engineering, truly amazing 
feats of technical accomplishment such as the James Webb telescope, the CERN 
Large Hadron Collider, or New Horizons spacecraft? While incredibly successful 
and examples of engineering brilliance, they are also loaded with backup system 
upon backup system to handle those “unknowns,” all countermeasures to our lack 
of knowledge.
It bears repeating: Goldman is saying that absolute knowledge of any complex 
topic, by any expert, at any time, by any means is essentially impossible to possess 
with confidence, and that any person who believes otherwise is kidding themselves. 
Of course, Goldman’s statement is a bit cynical, and the words “nobody” and “any￾thing” are a writer’s device to get our attention, but the underlying truth is certainly 
valid.
Perhaps many of you are saying right now there is nothing in common between 
the film industry and engineering. This is where we differ. Let’s look at new product 
development in engineering versus major new motion picture creation.
Let’s consider two organizations. The first is a major, multinational engineer￾ing firm whose business is producing and selling commercial aircraft navigation 
systems. New products are invented and made production-ready through the firm’s 
separate Research and Development division. This division has a current portfolio 
of 435 new products undergoing development. This portfolio is costing $357 million 
per year with a development staff of 450 engineers, and project completion time var￾ies between one to four years.
Each year, the R&D division evaluates about 175 brand new technology propos￾als for approval. Some fraction of these projects will be approved and added to the 
ongoing portfolio. Since budgets and staffing levels are capped, previously approved 
but low-potential development projects will be canceled to make room for the new.
The selection criteria are many and varied. They include total development cost, 
investment cost, project development timing, foreign and domestic sales potential, 
anticipated functional and quality performance, lifecycle, evolutionary vs. revolu￾tionary market and technological impact, repairability, return on investment (ROI), 
return on sales (ROS), patent income potential, and on and on. Yet very few criteria 
are known with some certainty: perhaps 40% of the required criteria are not known 
at all, and even if known, only low quality data for the proposal is available. The 
Catch-22 here is the criteria to approve a project can only come from data, but that 
data is only available when the project is underway, yet you can’t start the project 
without the approval. A paradox.
Let’s now look at the second organization, a Hollywood movie studio, with a port￾folio of 22 feature-length movie scripts in development for the summer blockbuster 
season in two years’ time. New movies are written and produced through a studio 
process that is nearly 100% staffed by independent contractors. The 22-script port￾folio is costing $168 million with a production staff of 842 contractors. Studio man￾agement continually evaluates new script proposals, and a small fraction of these are 74 Navigating the Engineering Organization
approved and added to the portfolio. Since budgets are capped, previously approved 
but lower-potential scripts will be canceled to make room for the new. Scripting, 
shooting, and editing completion time varies between one and four years.
New script selection criteria involve many factors. They include total develop￾ment cost, investment cost, script development timing, foreign and domestic sales 
potential, anticipated quality of the performances, streaming potential, new market 
penetration, special effects feasibility, return on investment (ROI), return on sales 
(ROS), secondary income potential, and so on.
Once again, the Catch-22 is the data needed to approve a project is only avail￾able when the project is essentially done, yet you can’t start the project without the 
approval.
The similarities are striking. Both firms are managing development portfolios: 
the script is the same as a technology project; both are governed by finance, timing, 
quality, and risk. And the selection of the project/script is made by management who 
bear a high personal risk and no real data to work with.
In both cases, nobody knows anything. Decisions are made continuously with 
no real, accurate, or valid data available. Yet timing of the decision (timing being 
the primary driver of management decisions) forces executives to make educated 
guesses.
But what about those business cases people talk about? A business case is a highly 
organized and analytical study of a future decision that provides fact-based data to 
create a high-confidence outcome. It is the foundation of business and engineer￾ing recommendation systems used throughout the world. But by this time, you may 
know the question to ask: where is the decision data and how good is it? Look behind 
the equations and calculations to ask where did the data come from? Sometimes, this 
may cause a few uncomfortable moments.
Let’s take one more example of Goldman’s statement in an engineering context.
Consider a much larger technology development portfolio for an international 
manufacturing giant who are developing nearly a thousand advanced technology 
projects invested at over $950 million.
The massive amount of resources being spent in R&D caused management to ask 
a question: How effective was the investment in their technology development effort? 
Should more or less funding be provided in upcoming years? What percentage of their 
advanced projects actually made it to sale? A multiyear, high-intensity study of their 
development process was commissioned and found a startling result. Their technol￾ogy selection process, a highly formalized, impeccably designed system, managed by 
a platoon of supervisors and managers, investing millions of dollars and hundreds of 
people, mightily birthed a technology success rate of …… 0.6%. The causes of this 
disappointing result had nothing to do with formalized procedures or other quantita￾tive measures, but with complex organizational factors firmly residing in the qual￾itative arena. The expert designers of the development system ignored the cultural, 
educational, and organizational influences of the system. Not only did they not take 
these factors into account, no one even thought to include them in their deliberations.22
Examples of other engineering disasters caused by lack of knowledge are easy to 
find. The 2018 collapse of the Morandi bridge in the Italian city of Genoa, the failure in Embracing a New Mindset 75
1981 of the Hyatt Regency Hotel suspended walkway in Kansas City, Missouri, and the 
2003 Columbia space shuttle disintegration all point to the engineer’s curse: that new 
designs often hit the wall of existing knowledge. Any desire to advance the state of the 
art requires moving beyond the data into the realm of judgment and risk management.
And despite the hopes of the Artificial Intelligence community, at this time reality 
is still too complex, too nuanced, and too situational to know with certainty exactly 
the outcome of any given cause and effect, or the true impact of contingencies. That 
any analysis, no matter how sophisticated or advanced, at some level remains sus￾pect. While the recent triumphs of AI are promising, the examples shared by the AI 
community are extremely narrow, and highly selected, designed to show the promise 
of AI but far, far away from widespread adoption.
The point here is that sophisticated equipment or techniques can only take you so 
far. As a new engineer, you eventually will be forced to make critical, doubtful, and 
even cynical judgments counter to what may be common knowledge or belief. This 
is why the contingency factor approach has been used in engineering and systems 
design for decades. We know that after a calculation is completed a “contingency” 
(i.e., a safety or “fudge factor,” always a nice round number) is included to give 
everyone involved a warm feeling that the calculation may not be perfect but still 
will not cause a catastrophic failure.
In a word, be confident, but remember that “nobody knows anything.”
3.9 TAKING COMFORT FROM DISCOMFORT
At this point you may ask yourself a question: How comfortable are you with the 
idea of changing a mindset? What I mean by comfortable is a continuum, on one side 
perhaps enthusiastically embracing the notion, or in the middle perhaps experiencing 
a mild resistance, or all the way to a strong rejection of the entire idea that a mindset 
can or should be changed.
If you are experiencing some discomfort, congratulations.
Just like in university or other personal experience, discomfort is a key indica￾tor of where you are at in a change process. As discussed earlier, crossing the Great 
Divide is nothing more than a transformation progression. That transformation can 
create some discomfort, which is one of the best indicators that change is truly 
underway and is progressing.
In a word, be comfortable with discomfort and embrace the uncertainty. You’re 
on your way.
3.10 REALIZATIONS
This entire chapter is about change. Specifically, about changing the lens or filter 
of perception and understanding that we call mindset. Crossing the Great Divide 
will require at least some change in mindset. Yet achieving even a small change is 
a difficult and long-term effort. Examining and reconsidering long-held beliefs and 
understandings can take a substantial effort with little initial results in return. Yet an 
appropriate willingness to consider examining or adopting a changed mindset will 76 Navigating the Engineering Organization
pay benefits when put in the context of an engineering professional’s overall judg￾ment. Engineering judgment is a skill, and an appropriate mindset is as important a 
prerequisite as any training in materials, stress analysis, or the calculus. Mindset is a 
key gateway to engineering professionalism.
Mindset can speak volumes. It can tell you if what you believe is truly real. Are 
the facts as presented really facts? What portion of contingency theory is appropri￾ate in this situation? Is the data being used to make a contention strictly quantitative, 
qualitative, or a combination of both? How much faith would you put into that data? 
And are there any paradigms or paradoxes operating in this circumstance, and if so, 
how is your judgment processing this as you analyze the situation? Finally, is your 
judgment being filtered by who you are, what you believe in, and the possibility that 
judgment has been hindered by previous experience.
Knowing these questions and more importantly, knowing their answer will better 
your chances of judging a situation correctly while gaining confidence for future action.
Some summary ideas deserve mention. The idea that hard numerical data, 
obtained by the most sophisticated means available, may or may not free you from 
the uncertainty of the analysis being conducting or the decision about to be made. 
Blind trust in numerical data, while anxiety-reducing, can also lead to blindness as a 
whole. True insight, which is the goal, is better served by combining the quantitative 
with the qualitative.
The desire to find the holy grail of the optimum answer, that there is only one, 
unmistakable, absolute, and inarguable answer to a problem, is a goal that’s com￾mendable, but ultimately unattainable. Contingency theory means there are several, 
if not many, near-optimum or “good enough” answers. And the good news in finding 
them is they will give your management options on various courses of action, which 
they are guaranteed to love.
Paradigms and paradoxes are fun. They can also be deadly unless you have a 
clear-eyed understanding of what they might really mean. For example, the merger 
of two mechanical engineering firms, while increasing the size and power of the 
newly created entity, will also create the paradigm shift of duplicate departments; 
who stays and who goes? The paradox of the Sigmoid Curve creates two paths for 
your firm: do you stay with the original legacy organization or transfer over to the 
new group, with all its risks and unknowns?
Decisions like this can be helped by examining just who you are at your core. For 
instance, in the Sigmoid example your decision rests partly on a self-examination of 
your own approach to risk: are you risk-averse or risk-seeking? Do you have better 
skills for one path or the other? These are questions that only can be answered by 
knowing yourself, and well.
With that understanding goes the idea of personal investigation, a predisposition to 
proactively discover the territory you work in, what you know, and, most importantly, 
what you don’t know. There’s a simple term for this mindset: it’s called curiosity.
Finally, the idea that nobody knows anything obviously is not meant to be taken 
literally, but as a caution and a philosophy. We as engineers need to approach any of 
our responsibilities with humility and a realization for each fact we know, there are 
probably ten facts that we do not, and that “we don’t even know what we don’t know.”Embracing a New Mindset 77
As engineers, we apply Cartesian thinking to a world of Brownian motion; we 
employ an orthogonal lens to make sense of a spherical environment. Our mindset 
can help us make better judgments in this confusing world.
From this point, let’s move on to something a bit less esoteric: a framework for 
operating in the engineering organization.

Guiding the Way: Adopting the 
Essential Engineering Framework81
4 Establishing the Essential 
Engineering Framework
4.1 MAPPING THE ENGINEERING ORGANIZATION
We all need structure in our lives. Our daily routine, the rules governing how we 
drive, the behaviors we exhibit when interacting with anyone from bishops to book￾ies – all are based on predetermined, agreed-to, and generally common behavioral 
structures.
These structures come directly from prior agreements of how we live together, 
work together, and generally interact. Its importance is that it is predetermined. We 
don’t have to reinvent the structure for different situations or for each new person we 
meet. When presented with a given situation, we go to our predetermined structures, 
choose the structure closest to the situation presented, and then perhaps apply a small 
modification as needed to (hopefully) deal with the moment successfully. In short, a 
structure is a tool to help guide us through common situations without continuously 
reinventing the answer.
An important point emerges here. A structure is a relatively rigid construct. The 
ability to modify it is limited, mostly due to the assumptions we made when initially 
developing the structure. Let’s look at the example of a traditional, routine financial 
transaction at your local bank (admittedly a rarer and rarer case, but it will do). Say 
you receive from your grandmother a personal, paper check of $50 for your birthday. 
You deposit the check into your checking account, which is credited to you. You 
receive a receipt for the deposit and continue your day, knowing that the $50 is safe 
and secure. These steps are the process of a typical financial transaction based on 
the structure of the personal banking system in the United States. But minor modi￾fications to the system are plenty. For the deposit, you could visit the bank and have 
a personal interaction with a teller, or deal directly with an ATM machine, or mail 
in the deposit, or create an image of the check on your mobile phone and transmit 
the image to the bank via an app. While these options are all available to make the 
deposit, the core action of the transaction is to be credited $50. The structure exists 
to ensure you are reliably credited; the minor modification is the choice of how to 
receive the credit. The options to modify the structure are small and limited in num￾ber and scope.
But what about a structure with substantial flexibility? Consider the example of a 
local municipal courtroom. You are driving on an icy road in early morning traffic. 
The vehicle in front of you stops quickly, and the ice prevents you from avoiding a 
collision. The local police arrive, confirm no one is injured, and ticket you with a 
failure to stop in time. The ticket states you are required to appear in municipal court 
in two weeks’ time to address the charge, with the fine for a guilty plea being $250.

Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework
In preparation for your court appearance, you attend a preliminary hearing with 
the local prosecutor. Based on your excellent driving record, the prosecutor offers 
to reduce the charge from failure to stop to impeding traffic, reducing the fine for a 
guilty plea from $250 to $100. You accept the offer and appear before the judge, who 
immediately accepts your admission of guilt. You pay the $100 fine to the cashier 
and continue on your way.
In this example, the court operates using a very flexible structure. For the same 
offense, a wide variety of outcomes can occur, all at the discretion of the prosecutor 
and judge. The fine can vary widely, from zero to any amount higher; the charge can 
become greater or lesser; the punishment can extend to something more substantial 
than money, such as mandatory community service or incarceration, or the case 
could be dismissed entirely.
For this book, a structure with such a high level of flexibility is called a frame￾work. A framework’s key characteristic is its expanded applicability to a greater 
variety of situations versus a structure. The wider the range of situations that can be 
successfully dealt within a single framework, the stronger the framework is.
Now to the question we face. How can we apply this framework concept to 
help our understanding of engineering organizations? Is there a common set of 
interrelationships that can be identified and assembled into a unified engineer￾ing framework, applicable to any type of engineering organization or goal, be it 
process, project, experimental, service, test, R&D, or any other engineering or 
technical situations?
Fortunately, the short answer is yes.
It’s time to introduce the key framework for successfully operating within engi￾neering organizations. Called the Essential Engineering Framework, this concept 
provides an integrated, simple, yet academically rigorous, model of how engineer￾ing organizations function. Developed by Dr. David A. Nadler (Harvard) and Dr. 
Michael L. Tushman (MIT), the model is a robust framework applicable to all those 
product, process, R&D, and service activities just mentioned. It shows an engineer￾ing organization as a straightforward construct yet honors the reality that these orga￾nizations are also three-dimensional, highly interdependent, and essentially organic 
entities. Like all good frameworks it is very simple: a system of five basic elements 
interacting in an external environment through a system of relationships, all remain￾ing in balance through the forces acting on those connections.1
The underlying idea is simple. All engineering organizations (hopefully) create 
value, those products and services that make the enterprise worthwhile. Creating 
that value uses these five elements in an essentially linear process. These basic ele￾ments are:
1) An External Environment, which are all the outside organizations, laws, 
regulatory sources, and any other external entity that can impact the engi￾neering firm’s success or failure.
2) Inputs, in which raw materials (people, ideas, energy, money, skills, tan￾gible commodities, and so on) are taken from the external environment and 
transformed by the organization.Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 83
3) Outputs, comprising objects or services exported to the environment at an 
enhanced value, intended to fulfill the organization’s purpose.
4) A Feedback Loop, designed to determine if the output is what the organiza￾tion initially desired, and, if not, applying corrective action.
5) A Transformation Process, the internal “core” workings of an engineer￾ing organization that actually performs the transformation, modifying the 
inputs into the desired output state. This change of state occurs in the Inner 
Core, which includes the boundary separating the external environment 
from the workings of the Core. The model is represented in Figure 4.1.
On first look, the model is fairly trivial. Inputs, transformation, and outputs in an 
environment with feedback are the fundamental model of manufacturing engineer￾ing. Only when you expand this construct to apply to all engineering activities, be 
it product development, experimental design, process improvements, testing, R&D, 
or technical sales and service, do we begin to see the power in this simplicity. The 
takeaway here is that this model is the starting point for all engineering work, inde￾pendent of what that organization or enterprise produces, provides, or creates.
A note about the framework’s terminology before we proceed. The Essential 
Engineering Framework contains two levels of classification that define the model. 
The upper-level classification is referred to as elements, the five categories just

introduced: Inputs, Outputs, Feedback Loop, External Environment, and Inner Core. 
The lower-level classification is referred to as components and exclusively popu￾lates the Inner Core. There are five components: the Formal Organization, Technical 
System, Human and Hard Resources, Hidden Organization, and Ubiquitous 
Communication System.
That said, let’s begin to unpack the framework, beginning by defining the five 
individual elements of the model.
4.2 LOOKING OUTSIDE OURSELVES: THE 
EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
Of the five elements defining the Essential Framework, the External Environment 
has an outsize impact on all aspects of the functioning and ultimate product of any 
engineering organization.
The external environment is the world where organizations live. The obvious 
simile is to our own physical environment. Just like the atmosphere we breath, the 
water we drink, the ground we stand on, and the wind we feel, our natural environ￾ment provides the necessary conditions for us to survive and prosper. Conversely, 
we impact our environment through our care and stewardship of our air, water, and 
wildlife. In short, the natural environment impacts us and we impact the natural 
environment simultaneously.
The same is true with organizations. Organizations also require an environment 
to operate within. Here, the external environment is not the traditional environ￾ment or ecosystem but is defined as all the forces, powers, and entities outside the 
boundary of the organization that have any kind of interest in the workings of the 
firm. Thus, our first key point is to realize that everything outside the organization’s 
boundary impacts the organization, and the organization impacts its external envi￾ronment. Every firm must interact with its environment; otherwise, the organization 
slowly loses touch with its reason for being and ultimately fails and disappears.
Two major aspects describe the external environment: the external environment 
itself, made up of a dozen or so interest areas or sectors, and the boundary that 
divides the organization from this environment, as in Figure 4.2.
With that understanding, let’s first examine the main sectors that constitute the 
external environment. While this list is an example for a large, publicly held enter￾prise, subsets of these sectors apply equally well to all engineering firms, from min￾iscule to immense, privately or publicly held engineering companies and startups.
There are two main groupings making up the external environment: stakeholders and 
secondary players. Stakeholders have a direct interest in the goals, operations, and suc￾cess or failure of the engineering firm, while secondary players indirectly influence (and 
in turn are mildly influenced) by the organization’s results and operation.
There are ten main environmental sectors making up the external environment, 
as shown in Figure 4.3, defined by:
1) Industry: direct and adjacent competitors, industry size, competitiveness, 
and related factors.Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 85
2) Raw Materials: Suppliers, first-tier manufacturers, real estate, infrastruc￾ture, etc.
3) External Human Resources: Labor market, employment agencies, national 
and local unions, universities, training schools, employees in first-tier sup￾plier companies
4) External Financial Resources: Wall Street, investment community, venture 
capital, angel investors, banks, other private investors and higher-risk finan￾cial instruments.
5) Market: Current and future global customers, clients, and direct potential 
users of the firm’s output. Individuals and entities that actually provide 
money in exchange for products and services.
6) New Technology: Techniques of production, research, product develop￾ment, applied science, digital tools, and future information technology.
7) Economic Conditions: Domestic and international recession or growth, 
unemployment rate, inflation and investment rates, availability of invest￾ment funds, and black swan events.
8) Domestic and International Governments: Regulatory entities that examine 
and control the firm’s products and services. City, state, and federal laws 
and regulations, operating taxes, infrastructure and related services, court 
systems, and political processes.

representing distinct societal values and beliefs. Examples include con￾sumer, environmental, and safety protection movements.
10) International: The impact of international company operations on the pro￾ceeding nine sectors. Global competition, product homologation, potential 
acquisition by foreign firms, overseas markets, foreign customs, regula￾tions, and exchange rates.2
We should spend a minute talking about the market segment, specifically the actual 
customers. There are two types of customers: in-house clients (other internal depart￾ments that use your output or product within the Inner Core as part of the firm’s 
overall processes) and external purchase consumers (those end-product buyers who 
actually reach into their wallets and place money into the company’s coffers).
Dealing with an internal customer is straightforward. Simply ask what they want 
or need, and as possible provide it to them in the form, quality, cost, reliability, and 
timing they require. They should be able to tell you clearly. Now I’m not saying the 
work of providing the internal product to them is necessarily easy, just that the inter￾nal customer requirements should be relatively well defined.
Providing for the external purchase customer is an entirely different universe. 
New engineers are beseeched to “understand your customer” and be subjected to the 
continuous drumbeat of “know this” and “know that” about who is the recipient of 
the firm’s hard work, and exactly understand what they want and need. In the vast

majority of firms, one of the most common ways to understand the external customer 
is through basic demographics.
As we discussed in Chapter Two, demographics is defined as statistical data 
surrounding the characteristics of a population as classified by age, gender, 
income, and the like for market research, sociological analysis, and governmen￾tal policy development. Demographics has been the “go to” tool for multiple 
business generations, as it’s easy to understand, comfortable to use and the data 
is easily available through census data, surveys and other data sources (normally 
for sale).
Unfortunately, everyone tends to have the same data. Striving for a marketing 
advantage, some firms have moved away from strict demographic analysis and 
attempted to base their marketing on “softer” factors such as a customer’s values, 
desires, aspirations, and level of self-actualization.
One advantage of these methods is their potential ability to target very specific 
groups of customers with individualized products and marketing programs. These 
methods support a “segmentation” approach to targeting customer groups based on 
personal characteristics and beliefs. Specifically, consumer segmentation groups are 
similarly minded customers binned together by any number of traits. For example, 
a technique called “values-based segmentation” is worth describing. Here, the cus￾tomer’s personal values are the main consideration that compel them to make a 
purchase.
Let’s look at the values definitions for a U.S.-based automotive business in the 
last decade. Here, the segmentation is based on the purchase customer’s attitudes 
and values toward vehicles and driving, personal motivations, functional needs such 
as product usage, emotional needs and feelings while driving, the dealer experience, 
and overall satisfaction.
With that background, let’s compare the same U.S. market using both demograph￾ics and values-based segmentation. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 show these results.3
Both lists give valuable insight into the customer base; the demographic analysis 
defining who the customers are today, and the values segmentation can be inter￾preted as what the customer aspires to be going forward. Both analyses have value, 
but several factors impact the values-based approach. Demographic data is fast and 
cheap to obtain and analyze. Values-based data is expensive and slow to acquire, not 
only to gather the data through ethnographic means but especially conducting the 
analysis afterword.
Another factor is authenticity. While asking the customer directly is the appar￾ent best way to gain that data, the reality is customers will not always tell the truth. 
Many times, customers will not tell you what they truly think. Instead, they will tell 
you what they think you want to hear. Customers will attempt to gauge the inter￾viewer’s views and then state whatever they think the interviewer would like to hear, 
not what they themselves like or dislike about the product.
An additional authenticity factor regards investment-heavy businesses such as 
manufacturing. These firms are constantly designing new products for sale three 
or four years in the future. For example, in the automotive business vehicle design￾ers will create three levels of change (or “themes”) for a proposed new car or truck. 88 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The first is an evolutionary design with minor changes to the current model. The 
second design is one with a moderate level of change. The third level of change is 
normally a “stretch” design, with highly advanced shapes, colors, materials, and the 
like designed to make a revolutionary statement about the vehicle and the person 
driving it.

Typical customers of the existing vehicle are invited to discuss with market 
research experts what they like and don’t like about the three themes. A large per￾centage of customers will say they like all three, keeping their real opinions to them￾selves. Another large percentage will prefer the evolutionary design, and less so the 
moderate. Yet there is also a percentage of customers who will loudly and defini￾tively state they do not like the third, most advanced theme. These customers will 
invariably say, quite strongly:
“I know what I like, and that's not it!”
That’s fine, but market researchers will tend to evaluate these strong responses 
with their own interpretation of the comment:
“I know what I like, and I like what I know.”
Market researchers know that a customer’s reaction to a design or product is heav￾ily influenced by that person’s prior experience, highly impacting the acceptability 
of the design. The important thing here is to realize that marketing evaluations of 
new products are more an art than science, so be aware of the softness around any 
customer acceptance analysis.

Let’s switch gears and talk a bit about a firm’s overall relationship with the exter￾nal environment. When the environment is uncertain (which is nearly 100% of the 
time) the organization attempts to interact with that environment in three ways. The 
firm can adjust its own internal organization to better fit with the current or future 
external environment, or it can attempt to control that environment or both. This 
results in a continuous de facto negotiation between an engineering organization and 
the external environment, resulting in an unremitting change to the status quo; i.e., 
the organization is always in a state of flux.
Companies attempt to control the external environment through national or 
local political activity, supporting trade associations or initiating public relations 
campaigns, all of which attempt to influence outside organizations and other 
entities. 
The second, and more difficult, organizational strategy attempts to adjust the 
internal organization to react to substantial environmental change. This path 
may be chosen when senior management judges the environmental change is 
indeed revolutionary and unlikely to return to its prior state. The rise of the 
web, ubiquitous digital products and services, and cloud computing are obvious 
examples of this level of change. The techniques a firm may use to effectively 
change are many, including absorbing uncertainty by protecting the organiza￾tion’s technical core, offering a high degree of specialization, zeroing-in on a 
specific target environment, creating formal links through ownership or joint 
ventures, and several others.
Of the two approaches, experience teaches that attempting to control the envi￾ronment tends to be cheaper, faster, and marginally more effective than adjust￾ing internally. Internal changes are lengthy endeavors; expensive and high risk. 
That said, a combination of both control and adjustment strategies are usually 
applied. Because of its outsize impact on the entire enterprise, managing the 
external environment is a primary role of the CEO and Chairman of the Board, 
while the Chief Operations Officer (COO) tends to handle the internal workings 
of the organization.
The important point here is that companies change as a result of evolving environ￾mental factors, which constitutes the major reason for the organization’s continuous 
metamorphous in both the short and long term.
Before moving on, we need to discuss one more topic to fully grasp the idea of 
the external environment, that of understanding the Organizational Boundary. The 
Organizational Boundary is defined as a semipermeable layer which surrounds the 
organization and through which inputs and outputs may pass, as shown in Figure 4.4.
To completely understand an organization, it’s critical to precisely define the loca￾tion of the boundary that separates the enterprise from its environment, that is, where 
to define the limits of the company. Like nearly all concepts in this book, bound￾ary placement is governed by contingency theory. When asking, “Where exactly 
does my organization begin and end?” the answer will always be contingent on what 
level of the organization is being analyzed. The department level, the multidepart￾ment level, the division level, or the enterprise level, all have different boundaries. 
This is important, as how the level is defined sets up what is an input, an output, Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 91
and where the transformation activity and feedback loop are located. For example, 
when considering the enterprise level of a technical organization, an input would be 
investment bankers or Wall Street for finance, national NGOs for social responsibil￾ity, the federal government for regulations, and international industry players for 
competitors. Yet when considering a department-level analysis, inputs would be your 
internal finance department for funding, your firm’s internal sustainability depart￾ment for adherence to company “green” guidelines, local city or county governments 
for regulations, and other internal departments charged with controlling or limiting 
any technical work.
It may seem trivial that we must think about an organization’s boundary. After 
all, the idea is simple: everything having to do with the direct workings of the orga￾nization resides inside the boundary, and everything that does not must belong in the 
external environment. However, a key idea about the boundary is how it is initially 
placed in your mind and how it relates to your understanding. Engineering organi￾zations tend to be complex entities with imprecise language. When we talk about 
a technical organization, are we referring to an engineering department, a section, 
a directorate, a division, or an entire enterprise? Then what is considered an input, 
output, and external environment is completely dependent on contingency theory.
Let’s make this a bit more personal. Say you are asked to prepare a plan for 
improving the flow-through of a continuous manufacturing process. It’s critical that

you first define the boundary of the organization to set up the terms of the analysis. 
Selecting too large a boundary that includes the company sales and marketing divi￾sions as part of the manufacturing analysis is not likely to help improve the process. 
Instead, a department-level boundary placement is much more appropriate. In short, 
the boundary selection is critical. It’s therefore important that you select and under￾stand the environmental boundary before attempting to further develop the plan.
With this idea of the external environment fully in mind, let’s now turn to a sim￾ple element of the Essential Engineering Framework, the inputs that feed a firm’s 
transformation process.
4.3 MORE THAN WE MIGHT THINK: THE INPUT ELEMENT
At the most basic level, inputs are resources. In this book, a resource is a source of 
value that when transformed or combined, additional benefits are produced. It has 
value and utility. Resources can be broadly classified upon their availability and 
importance; that is, they can be classified as renewable and nonrenewable, or as 
something of explicit or intrinsic value.
Similarly, inputs are items or concepts of some worth taken from the environment 
and transformed by an organization into an output of greater value. Inputs are commonly 
thought of as physical items or commodity materials, as in a manufacturing process. 
Coal, steel, bananas, tomatoes, component subassemblies, rubber, and so on all tend to 
fit this definition. There are no new revelations here: you already know all about inputs.
We as engineers tend to think of inputs almost exclusively as a manufacturing or 
software concept. Inputs are either commodity materials used to build something or 
digital data applied to a computer program or simulation. The commonality here is 
that both these material and digital inputs are commodities, bulk items where each 
unit has a very low individual value. Note these are not to be confused with eco￾nomic commodities (i.e., gold, silver, pork bellies, and financial contracts), which are 
excluded from this discussion.
Here, inputs denote a much broader concept. Inputs reflect the total number and type 
of resources that a group has at their disposal to create a transformation. Inputs are the 
raw ingredients of talent, people, ideas, energy, time, money, information, skills, tan￾gible raw materials, and other various items of value. The key idea is still valid; just the 
boundary is different: organizational inputs are defined as something of value from any 
internal or external source and transformed by the organization into a product or service 
of increased value. Figure 4.5 shows the fundamental relationship to the model.
As we consider inputs to be a wide range of items the engineering organization uses to 
create value, they include items not normally considered traditional inputs, such as skills, 
energy, concepts, and ideas. Our perception of inputs needs to be something much more 
universal than we may have previously thought. Let’s look at some examples.
4.3.1 People as an Input: Commodities vs. Talents
Today, we do not think of people’s value as strictly a commodity, to be placed in 
the same category as iron ore or soybeans. Yet certain organizations, especially Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 93
organizations in the past, saw people as raw, mobile muscle; unthinking hordes to do 
the will of the overseer (or, in today’s lexicon, local management). The laborers who 
built the ancient Egyptian pyramids fit this definition nicely. Fredrick Taylor’s mecha￾nistic organizational beliefs (i.e., scientific management) are founded on workers as 
commodities. Vestiges of this type of input remain today: road crews and landscapers 
can be thought of as commodities, providing sheer numbers and muscle to the job.
The individual talent of a worker is typically not explicitly identified as an input. 
Yet without talent, today’s technical organizations would lack the knowledge and skill 
to operate complex systems (in fact, the phrase “knowledge worker” was coined to 
refer to these talented individuals). Talent has immense value in all organizations, the 
amount of value varying by organization type and desired output. Consistent with 
Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences covered in Chapter 3, talent can be thought 
of as a special aptitude or ability of many types, a competence in doing something 
uncommon. And unlike tons of green beans entering a canning plant or a thousand 
points of data powering a weather forecast, these talents cannot be readily measured.
Take the example of two colleagues you meet on the first day of your new job. 
Both are the same age, both come from big-name engineering schools, and both 
have the same social-economic backgrounds. As you soon discover, one is outgoing, 
energetic, and loquacious. The second is highly logical, stoic, and somewhat serious. 
Are each equally valuable to the technical firm?

FIGURE 4.5 Inputs within the Essential Engineering Framework. 94 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Of course. But the common perception is that engineering organizations tend 
to see talent as limited to mathematical or logical constructs. Yet in reality, engi￾neering managers consider talent as a wide range of characteristics, and when 
placed into the organization strategically can create enhanced value to the firm. 
Like a jigsaw puzzle, good managers will arrange talented people into positions 
that reinforce each other, where highly methodical workers do analytical work in 
association with others, and where more verbally skilled engineers are placed in 
more interactive positions.
The key idea here is that, as we learned from Gardner, most engineers are an 
amalgam of many attributes and characteristics that are arranged by manage￾ment to create an interactive, almost three-dimensional, network of talent and 
capability.
The boundary between people as commodities and talent is frequently seen during 
a new engineer’s early days at work. As a new hire, you are initially an unknown to 
the group, so it makes sense that early assignments will be more commodity-oriented 
than talent-based. This serves two purposes: to experiment with how you might per￾form, and frankly, to prevent you from causing any real damage. Once you demon￾strate some positive characteristics and establish initial trust, then your assignments 
will begin to draw more on talent than commodity. The main point is to realize that 
early commodity assignments should be expected and embraced and not seen as a 
disappointment.
An important distinction here concerns understanding the true boundary of 
the input. Are the people in question (either commodity or talent) already a direct 
employee of the organization or contribute to it as an outside hire? Are they already 
internal to the firm or an external input to the organization? “Hired guns,” consul￾tants, job-shoppers, and “temps” all fall into the external category. Seeing these 
resources as either external inputs or internal resources has an important bearing on 
the accuracy of the “mental map” you are attempting to create.
4.3.2  Funding as an Input
While a very easy idea to grasp, we need to touch on some additional types of fund￾ing acting as inputs. As everyone knows, funding is the single, most critical input to 
any engineering project or process. During the United States vs. Soviet space race 
of the 1960s, the old joke was, “What fuel propels a rocket ship to the moon? The 
answer: “Funding.” Today, this saying still holds. Is there enough funding? Is the 
funding of the right type? Will it arrive in time? Is the funding source reliable? Are 
the funds fungible, or are they locked into covering only certain expenses? The list 
of questions surrounding the funding input is truly large and important.
Some people suspect that new engineers tend to avoid funding questions, as they 
may feel that finance should be left to the finance department, upper-line manage￾ment, or some unknown “they.” In other words, “I’m an engineer, not an accountant.” 
Instead, new engineers need to embrace the chance to understand, at the day-to-day 
level, how the funding mechanism works in any given organization.Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 95
There is an important distinction when it comes to funding. The distinction is 
whether the funding in question is provided internally by your existing organization 
or comes from sources external to it. Radically different rules and limitations apply 
between these two sources. This will be covered in some detail in Chapter 6, but for 
now be alert that a significant difference exists between the two.
4.3.3  Ideas as an Input
Ideas are a fundamental input to any engineering project or process. Without new 
ideas, there is no reason to do the work or strive for a successful result. Ideas are 
the engine that propel a product, service, or entire enterprise forward. Sometimes 
identified as innovations, inventions, evolutionary improvements, or revolutionary 
advances, ideas are the creative factor required to gain a competitive advantage or 
other worthwhile output.
Now for a warning. When thinking of an idea as an input, a complex and con￾fusing situation emerges. Ideas are very nebulous creatures: they have many forms. 
They are described by countless definitions and terminology that is not agreed upon 
and are developed through an untold number of methods and techniques. They can 
encompass a tangle of concepts that innovators continuously argue about, never 
mind the near-infinite number of resulting innovations possible.
In short, ideas are a mess.
The challenge is not in identifying an idea to develop, as there is never a lack of 
good ideas already in your organization. A tableful of experienced engineers can 
generate dozens of new, worthwhile ideas in about two hours flat. Instead, the issue 
is the very nature of an idea. Ideas are a mess because you can’t readily get your 
arms around them; you can’t pin them down precisely. Instead, the challenge is to 
become comfortable with the ambiguity of ideas at the input stage and allow the 
natural maturity of the idea to better define itself over time. The nature of an idea 
will become clear, just not immediately.
For now, the takeaway is that ideas and innovations are a key input that can be 
nebulous, ill-defined, and very difficult to work with. And that’s OK.
4.3.4 Willingness or Commitment as an Input
This may seem an unusual input for an engineering project or task. Yet a willing￾ness or commitment to see a project through plays a surprisingly large role in the 
success of any undertaking. Here, commitment refers to the desire or will of the 
technical organization to actually achieve the goal or objective set. Organizational 
willingness is not a given; it varies widely depending on a number of factors, many 
of which are not necessarily visible. You can see indirect hints of this lack of will: 
low headcount assigned, funding starvation, a lack of space or proper facilities, or 
difficulty in getting management’s attention. All point to an organization’s lack of 
willingness to complete the project or achieve the goal. Many initiatives die, and on 
their tombstones is written the epitaph “Lacked the will to live.”96 Navigating the Engineering Organization
4.3.5  Time and Information as Inputs
Time is required for any project, yet time is a flexible concept, as we will discuss in 
Chapter 6. As an input, time can be flexible, rigid, limited, unlimited, or any num￾ber of different forms. At this point we just need to plant the seed that time is not 
a single, linear commodity but a amorphic, Jell-O-like quantity capable of taking 
many forms and shapes.
Information is an obvious input; its availability is critical to any knowledge-based 
project. As an input, information can be mere data or refined intelligence or knowl￾edge. The important considerations are obvious. Is it available? At what cost? In 
what form? And for what length of time is it accurate or even relevant?
All inputs have limitations, or boundaries, that directly impact their value and 
appropriateness to an engineering organization. Each of the input types we’ve dis￾cussed will have some sort of limitation set on them. Not all raw materials will be 
available in the quantities or quality needed. Time may be in short supply. Talent 
may be severely limited or just not available. While some needed inputs can be 
substituted (such as money for time), others cannot. Inputs are contingent and so 
must be considered individually and managed like any other aspect of contingency 
theory. In short, inputs can severely limit or enhance the success of your organiza￾tion’s goals, and the guarantee of their availability requires a substantial effort and 
investment.
4.4 IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT: THE OUTPUT ELEMENT
I’m certain everyone knows what an output is. An output is something of greater or 
(sometimes) lesser value created by a transformation process. Outputs are materi￾als, products, processes, knowledge, inventions, innovations, or a myriad of other 
entities exported to the outside environment intended to fulfill an organization’s 
purpose. Of course, not all outputs are favorable. Any coder who has unintention￾ally created an infinite loop on a customer beta site can tell you exactly what kind 
of output that is.
As with inputs, the definition of an output in contingency theory is far broader 
than traditional engineering thinking. The point here is that outputs, like inputs, 
consist of an entire galaxy of objects and ideas.
Be it new products, novel process recommendations, fresh insights, or plain old 
widgets, outputs are the core interest because they represent the end result of your 
firm’s considerable intelligence, planning, and investment. They receive the lion’s 
share of an organization’s attention. As with inputs, here we view outputs as broadly 
as possible. As the Essential Engineering Framework is meant to describe all engi￾neering work activities, so it stands that its outputs can be new consumer products, 
manufacturing processes, ideas, insights, recommendations, digital applications, and 
a universe of advancements created at the pleasure of the firm. Just take a look at 
Figure 4.6: it’s as simple as that.
But once an output is in hand, the question becomes this: Is this the output actu￾ally desired? Does it successfully achieve the goal? Are we where we wish to be? Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 97
Luckily, the answers to these questions are close by. Of course, we’re talking about 
the Feedback Element.
4.5 ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT THING: THE FEEDBACK ELEMENT
Feedback in engineering is a very familiar concept you already know. Sometimes 
called “closed loop control systems,” these are structures and methods that automati￾cally sense and correct for out-of-specification output conditions.
For us in engineering, a closed loop control system has a narrower definition 
than in general use. We see closed loop systems as a set of mechanical or elec￾tronic devices that automatically regulate a process to the desired state or set point 
without human interaction. Engineering closed loop methods are widely used in 
many industry applications, including agriculture, chemical plants, aviation, nuclear 
power plant cooling systems, automobile lane departure systems, and many, many 
other examples. Closed loop control systems contrast with open loop systems, which 
may sense an out-of-bounds condition but are unable to correct themselves without 
human assistance.
Organizational feedback systems are different in that, like the inputs and outputs 
we’ve discussed, their definition is wider, extending far beyond strictly mechanics. 
These feedback systems exist everywhere. All organisms in nature have closed loop

feedback systems. For example, pain is an example of an organic closed loop system. 
Pain exists to tell the body that damage is being (or has been) done to the organ￾ism and corrective action is required. In the animal world, prey rely on a variety of 
organic sensors to detect predators, including the visual, chemical, auditory, and tac￾tile senses. In the legal world, a repeat offender, by the very fact they have multiple 
convictions, offers feedback to the defense attorney that a successful argument on a 
new charge is unlikely.
Obviously, organizations also have feedback mechanisms (many times highly 
developed) which determine if they are achieving their intended purpose. Here, feed￾back mechanisms are designed to measure progress toward operative goals. In the 
Essential Framework, shown in Figure 4.7, feedback systems are designed to answer 
two questions: are you effective in hitting your organizational targets, and are you 
achieving your target efficiently? (Of course, this assumes you are actually aiming 
at the right target.)
In many instances, undergraduate engineers are taught that feedback loops are 
relatively straightforward systems, requiring minor attention or effort. Often, just 
one (or perhaps two or three) indicator is measured periodically or continuously and 
compared to a predetermined, desired output level. Usually, these measurements are 
selected for ease of measurement rather than as an optimal indicator of performance. 
Examples here can include quality, quantity, timeliness, and cost, characteristics that

are all related by the fact they are easy, quick numerical indicators that are extremely 
cheap to measure. This may or may not be appropriate. The key to selecting a feed￾back indicator is in its ability to truly measure what is important, not what is easy.
Another common misunderstanding is that many engineers view effectiveness 
and efficiency as the same thing. Effectiveness is not efficiency. Effectiveness is 
the degree to which an organization achieves its goals. Efficiency is the amount
of resources (time, funds, talent, etc.) used to achieve those goals. Efficiency con￾fused with effectiveness usually results in only efficiency being measured rather than 
both. Both measures must be well defined and clear; otherwise, you open the door to 
reaching the wrong answer in a very efficient manner.
A well-known example of efficiency being mistaken for effectiveness happens 
regularly in engineering decision meetings. Say you are invited to a meeting with the 
purpose of approving a major new design initiative within your division. Due to the 
importance and riskiness of the decision, in-person attendance is required. A time is 
set, a location reserved, and review material transmitted in advance.
As soon as the meeting begins, the majority of attendees immediately begin the 
ritual of bowing their heads and staring at their laps, tapping on their mobile devices 
under the table, sending texts, writing emails, making appointments, and perhaps 
booking dinner reservations. Soon, they are no longer “present” in the meeting.
The justification for this behavior is improved efficiency. Viewing “just listen￾ing” as wasteful, the attendee believes they are “making good use of their time.” 
Unfortunately, the quality and effectiveness of the major decision suffers, as impor￾tant information is commonly missed due to these digital distractions.
We already know this behavior is widespread, having seen it in lecture halls and 
conference rooms around the world. To combat this distraction, certain senior-level 
meetings require all participants, on entering the meeting room, to silence their 
mobile devices and physically place them on a side table. Not only does this reduce 
distraction, but it also sends the message that what is about to happen is important, 
requiring 100% attention. It also avoids the risk that the person texting is seen as 
disrespecting senior leadership. The message is clear: the texts and emails can wait.
As before, feedback should be an indicator of both organizational effectiveness 
and efficiency. Yet measuring organizational performance is a decades-old problem: 
it’s hard to do. High-quality feedback can be expensive, slow to obtain, and unwieldy 
to analyze. And consistent with contingency theory, organizations have evolved 
many techniques for measuring these two characteristics, based on environmental 
conditions, business type, the product created, the structure of the organization, and 
so forth. Common measurement techniques or approaches include (but are not lim￾ited to) the following.
4.5.1  Goal Approach
Here, the single focus is exclusively on current output or productivity, represented by 
one or perhaps two simple measurements. Quarterly financial profit and loss state￾ments or revenue are prime examples. Easiest to measure but most limited in insight, 
this approach is similar to a physician performing a diagnosis on you by only taking 100 Navigating the Engineering Organization
your temperature, neglecting blood pressure, body weight, blood glucose level, or 
any other physical measurement. While extremely fast and easy to measure, the goal 
approach is only a “backward looking indicator,” providing no insight into future 
performance. In short, this approach when used alone is totally inadequate to achiev￾ing an accurate assessment of an organization’s health.
4.5.2 Resource Approach
This method focuses on the ability to acquire necessary resources, such as funding, tal￾ent, time, or other resource to achieve the firm’s goals. While a “forward-looking” indi￾cator, and useful when other measures are difficult to obtain, its limitation is in being 
unable to track either internal processes or outputs, making it a very weak indicator.
4.5.3  Internal Process Approach
The emphasis here is on internal process efficiency only, implying that a healthy 
internal process guarantees a good organizational outcome. In other words, it indi￾cates only efficiency, neglecting effectiveness. This approach is a poor stand-alone 
indicator of the organization’s internal health.
4.5.4 Competing Values Approach
Adapts Robert Quinn’s Competing Values Framework to emphasize four interlock￾ing organizational values: human relations, internal processes, rational goals, and 
innovation. The point here is to provide a holistic assessment of the engineering 
organization’s performance, considering as wide a range of indices as possible. The 
difficulty is in the measurability and repeatability of these four indicators, as several 
tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative.
4.5.5 Balanced Scorecard Approach
The natural extension of the Competing Values model, the Balanced Scorecard devel￾ops curated, reliable, and repeatable metrics drawn from the four Quinn categories. 
Balanced Scorecards were initially developed by Kaplan and Norton to provide a 
more advanced but still holistic way to consistently measure the main characteristics 
of an engineering enterprise. Four main performance aspects are tracked: Financial, 
External Customer, Internal Processes, and Employee Development. Since its intro￾duction in the 1990s, the Balanced Scorecard (also referred to as a “dashboard”) is 
considered a best practice and is a favorite of numerous organizations worldwide. 
The challenge here is that the local organization must invent their own metrics; they 
cannot depend on a cookbook or menu approach to establish the metrics that matter.4
A summary of these five methods is shown in Table 4.3.
Despite the popularity of the Balanced Scorecard, arguments are plentiful over 
which of two underlying philosophies is better: does success come to those firms who 
drive their businesses with only strict numerical targets and performance measures, Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 101
or that managing a firm through a combination of qualitative and quantitative indica￾tors is optimum? Engineering firms can sometimes demonstrate a preset bias toward 
the former, as the engineering culture reinforces numerical measurement with such 
adages as “What is measured is real” or “In God we trust; all others bring data.”
With these two approaches unresolved, many (if not most) general organizations 
today tend to avoid controversy and adopt the more popular and “safe” Balanced 
Scorecard approach.
One of the most well-known examples of Balanced Scorecards is discussed in 
Bryce Hoffman’s American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor 
Company. During 2010–2012, Ford CEO Alan Mulally and his team achieved one of 
the great comebacks in business history. As the global automotive industry collapsed 
during the Great Recession of 2008–2010 (see Case Example 3.3), Ford quickly 
transformed from near-certain failure into the most profitable automaker in the 
world. The biggest strategic driver of Ford’s turnaround was a measurement process 
called the weekly Business Plan Review, or BPR, another name for the Balanced 
Scorecard. Held every Thursday, Mulally used the BPR to identify and focus on the 
four critical drivers of the business as defined by the firm. From this, Mulally was 
rapidly able to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the business and apply first 
aid to those areas needing it while strengthening targets of opportunity.5
One important but rarely talked about advantage of the Balanced Scorecard is as 
a tool for driving transparency and cultural change. At a critical moment in Ford’s 
transformation, Mulally used the BPR to identify an important hidden issue, forcing 
top executives to admit to a problem that had been previously covered up. And once 
Mulally demonstrated that executives owning up to this problem uncovered by the

BPR would not be punished (as was the previous practice), senior management could 
focus on solutions and not concealing trouble.
For a new hire, the upshot of feedback and measurement is in becoming familiar 
(and eventually conversant) with your company’s performance measurement system, 
and especially its preferred method of measuring results. This is how everyone and 
everything is measured, not only at the enterprise and divisional levels but within 
departmental and local groups as well. These are the rules of the game.
4.6 THE HEART OF THE MATTER: THE TRANSFORMATION 
PROCESS AND INNER CORE ELEMENT
We finally arrive at the center of our framework and the subject of the rest of this book. 
Our previous chapters have orbited around our foundational engineering organizational 
model: the Essential Engineering Framework. We now focus on the center of this model, 
the Inner Core. The Core is where the actual transformation of inputs into outputs takes 
place. We can view the Core as where the actual “day-to-day” work occurs, be it in a 
product design house, production factory, research complex, or computing facility.
The Inner Core denotes the location where the change of state of any input into 
any form of output occurs, be it data, knowledge, a physical product, a new idea, an 
improved process, or any other transformation. The Core houses the internal work￾ings of the engineering organization, consisting of all the systems, departments, 
technologies, sub-organizations, and corporate culture that provide the necessary 
elements to do work. The remainder of this book will deal with you as a new engi￾neer operating within this Core.
The Core consists of five components that together perform the actual transfor￾mation process, as diagramed in Figure 4.8. It comprises:
4.6.1  The Formal Organization
Think of an organization chart: this is where the formal organization would reside. 
Yet the formal organization is orders of magnitude more complex and far-reaching 
than depicted on a scrap of paper. This is where all written policies, methods of 
communication, standard operating procedures, vertical and horizontal relation￾ships, and all other prescribed activities reside. Being the most public face of a firm, 
this element contains the information that any outsider asking about an organization 
would be given.
4.6.2  Human and Hard Resources
This element addresses aspects of two different areas: human resources, which cov￾ers employee needs and labor relations, new hire selection, job roles, interpersonal 
dynamics, and formal reward systems; and hard resources, which is any nonhu￾man item of value, such as equipment, workspace, funding, and information. Note 
one distinction. Inputs are defined as resources that enter the transformation system. 
While commonly acquired from outside the organization, human and hard resources Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 103
are also sourced from inside the firm and are acted upon internally. The source of 
those interior inputs is ongoing budgets covering existing funds, talent, workspace, 
and so on. The distinction here is that all resources can come from either internal or 
external sources or both, and all are managed by a human and hard resource system.
4.6.3  The Technology System
The true center for converting inputs into outputs. Here, technical or technology is 
not the common definition of just a digital device or system; say, a smartphone or 5G 
network. Here, technology is defined by the U. S. National Research Council as the 
sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods 
or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. 
These include manufacturing technologies, product and services development tech￾nologies, and technologies deployed at different organization levels such as depart￾ment, individual, and information system echelons.
4.6.4  The Hidden Organization
Also called the corporate culture, this component is very important to you but largely 
hidden from view. The hidden organization is an interconnected and interrelated

network of behavioral and social norms, the “collective thoughts, habits, attitudes, 
feelings and patterns of behavior.”6 It deals with more behavioral, “softer” topics 
such as leadership norms, group culture, politics, power, interdepartmental relations, 
and any other concerns impacting the social cohesion of a group. In some instances, 
new engineers may initially doubt its existence, and even if accepted, many may see 
it as having little impact on their professional life.
4.6.5  The Ubiquitous Communication Network
In this model, a ubiquitous communication network refers to how information flows 
within all areas of an organization’s inner core. These networks are regular patterns 
of person-to-person, group-to-group, and person-to-group relationships through 
which appropriate information flows. This means that the flow of information is 
managed, regulated, and structured in a formal system while supplemented with an 
unconstrained, informal and nearly frictionless, multidirectional arrangement.
Ubiquitous communication is meant to meld the previous four components into 
a unified whole with an optimum level of multi-node information exchange. While 
each of these four components is intentionally well defined with fairly clean bound￾aries, the communications network is designed to cement these components into a 
strong and robust whole. While information overload is a real danger in this model, 
the goal is to provide decision-makers the right information at the right time in the 
right amount in the right form.7
4.7 REALIZATIONS
The Essential Engineering Framework is simple and easy to understand, with just five 
well-defined elements interacting in a basic relationship: Inputs, Outputs, Feedback 
Loop, Inner Core, and External Environment. Inputs are broadly defined, encom￾passing a much wider definition than in normal use. Equally broad is a concept of 
Outputs that can take a form far beyond traditional understanding. Linking inputs 
and outputs is a Feedback Loop, meant to adjust the system for optimum effec￾tiveness and efficiency over time. An Inner Core provides the actual transforma￾tion function of the enterprise. Surrounding these four elements is an ever-changing 
external environment.
The area of our greatest attention is the Inner Core. The Inner Core accomplishes 
the purpose of the enterprise: convert inputs of a given value into outputs of greater 
value. The Core is the heart of the organization, consisting of five internal com￾ponents: technology that performs the actual transformation, supported by human 
and hard resources, structured through a formal organization, enhanced by a hidden 
organization or culture, and bonded together through a multichannel communication 
network.
The Essential Engineering Framework is modest, unassuming, and unpretentious, 
yet fundamental to what all engineering organizations accomplish. That’s our model.
With this introduction to the Essential Engineering Framework, we now push 
forward to a detailed tour of the Inner Core. This is where you will operate, where Establishing the Essential Engineering Framework 105
you will spend your time, where you will learn, and where your success or failure 
will take place. And this is where the satisfaction or regret of choices you make will 
play out.
The Core is where the action is.

5 A Tour of the Inner Core
5.1 THE FIVE COMPONENTS OF THE CORE
Yes, we’re getting closer to the heart of our book, closer to learning how to cross that 
Great Divide. But before we get there, we need to take a deeper dive into the Inner 
Core of our Essential Engineering Framework. Viscerally understanding the Core 
and what goes into it is an important preparation step before you can begin to operate 
successfully within your new firm.
As introduced in the previous chapter, the Inner Core is where value is created. 
This is where inputs are absorbed, transformed, and released as outputs in either a 
continuous or periodic manner. Five basic components make up the Core, all con￾tained within a boundary that defines what is internal or external to the organization.
The Core is where new engineers receive their initial assignments and perform 
their first tasks. Early reputations are made there; initial triumphs and setbacks will 
happen within its boundaries. Why there and not someplace else? It’s very simple. 
Supervision will assume a new hire will know next to nothing about the business, 
making them an unknown quantity in a dynamic and churning environment. They 
will not be seen as the young, dynamic engineer as portrayed in the beautiful PDF 
the company recruiter sent you. At this point a new hire is considered a low-impact 
employee, too green to initially be given any complex, sophisticated, or high-risk 
task. Naturally, management will place them in a spot where “they can’t cause any 
damage.” (An engineer named Bill Freiburg once shared that his first assignment 
was to design a wooden base to hold a scale model of an F-15 fighter aircraft. Not 
something to brag about to your Mom or friends at the craft beer pub.) New hires will 
probably be pigeonholed into the supervisor’s mental “box” for perhaps two or three 
simple assignments until the new engineer can build enough trust to be rewarded 
with their first real assignment.
To help get out of this assignment purgatory, new hires like yourself will need to 
know each piece of the Core, and within each piece, know who inhabits it, what they 
do, when they do it, how they do it, and, most importantly, why they do it. Only then 
comes that hall pass to receive a meaningful assignment.
In a new group, you and your fellow engineers will need to make decisions and 
take actions that are timely, effective, efficient, integrated, and ultimately correct 
for both your local organization and the overall enterprise. You do this by operating 
within the Core, that five-part construct introduced in Chapter 4 and summarized as:
1. The Formal Organization, that part of the organization that is easily visible 
to both the organization’s inhabitants and those outside the firm. This is the 
public “face” of the enterprise. This is where the classic organization chart 
resides, where announced goals, strategies, plans, and policy deployment 
occur. This is what everyone sees as the “organization.” And the degree to

which it has anything to do with the reality of a local engineering organiza￾tion will vary.
2. Human and Hard Resources, consisting of human resources, which are the 
talent, skills, training, and personnel support required to accomplish the 
input-to-output transformation, and hard resources, those physical items 
that support human resources in getting the job done. These items include 
highly specialized equipment, fresh computer upgrades and analysis soft￾ware, test stands, physical or virtual commons areas, and for those working 
on-site, the cappuccino machine, and snacks provided in the breakroom 
down the hall.
3. The Transformation System, the “engine room” where the actual transfor￾mation of inputs into desired outputs is accomplished. This is the “core 
of the Core,” where products are created, services rendered, and value 
materializes.
4. The Hidden Organization, easily the most interesting and complex area of 
the Core. Also called the corporate culture, the Hidden Organization is a 
(mostly) invisible set of values, norms, guiding beliefs, and understandings 
that are shared by members of the organization and taught to new members 
as correct. This is where unwritten knowledge is shared, where deals are 
cut and tacit agreements are made. This is where your organization can 
become amazingly successful or sink without a trace. Without the Hidden 
Organization, a firm will be ineffective and could become irrelevant.
5. The Ubiquitous Communication System, defined as the information net￾work linking the four previous components together. The power of the Core 
resides in the mutual reliance on its component parts and resulting synergy. 
Without a strong communications network, coordination between these 
four areas will break down and the creativity and performance expected 
of the organization will suffer. This is why each of these four components 
must closely interact with and support each other through this multimodal 
information exchange. This network can be a combination of sophisticated 
or simple, formal or hidden, written or verbal, electronically transmitted or 
performed in person, or otherwise exchanged by any means possible (ide￾ally, all these modes are used). The important point is that a communication 
system must operate in a strong and frictionless manner.
The entire Inner Core is depicted in Figures 4.8 and Figure 5.1.
Let’s now deconstruct the Inner Core and examine each component, their indi￾vidual characteristics, and how they contribute to the totality of the product transfor￾mation. But first, we need to answer a fundamental question: just how do engineering 
firms organize, anyway?
5.1.1 Birthing an Engineering Organization
You may be wondering why we haven’t talked about organization charts yet. After 
all, what’s an organization without an organization chart? Doesn’t an organization A Tour of the Inner Core 109
chart map the heart of the enterprise? Isn’t it the Rosetta Stone of an engineer’s 
professional life? Well, there’s a very good reason for the delay. At this point, a new 
engineer may believe their local organization is like an island, self-contained and 
independent. Yet it is actually embedded in and dependent upon a larger organiza￾tion called by various names: the corporation, company, firm, or even the “mother 
ship.” And the local organization chart is the end result of an entire process based on 
the larger firm’s vision, mission, purpose, goals, customers, and myriad other factors. 
Only when these terms are identified, defined, and addressed can a local organiza￾tion chart finally be created. It’s the last step of what can be a long process.
We need to accomplish two things here. The first is to truly understand all these 
organizational terms, and the second is to outline the process that ultimately creates 
your group’s organizational framework. Only then can we understand each of the 
five components.
The terms I’ve just mentioned have an important purpose in the world of an engi￾neering firm: they define what the company is and is not. What it does, why it does 
it, who does it, when and how it is done; all these terms define the larger enterprise 
of which you are a part. Without these basic terms clearly defined, you and your 
colleagues theoretically wouldn’t know what to do, and neither would anyone else.
Of course, this is oversimplistic to the point of naivete. But the fact is, any orga￾nization, big or small, high-tech or commodity-based, old or startup – all need at the

highest level a definition of its purpose and guidance on how to achieve its purpose. 
With that in place, then the organization can help fulfill that purpose.
Unfortunately, there are many, many business terms in use and considerable con￾fusion over the definition of these expressions such as mission, values, and purpose. 
Consulting any two sources in the business literature will give you two very different 
sets of definitions, so once again we will have to define our own terminology:
Vision
A case in point, a vision can be defined using scores of different constructs. A typical 
example is a definition from Bain and Company, a consultancy: “A vision statement 
describes the desired future position of the company,”1 or Harvard Business School’s 
Graham Kenny: “A vision statement says what the organization wishes to be like in 
some years’ time.”2 My own favorite descriptor is “What we want to be when we 
grow up.” Note that visions have long time frames: a vision is the longest-term plan￾ning horizon that management is comfortable with considering.
Now all this sounds good, but here’s the rub. Visions are normally put together 
by a committee of senior executives, sweating out the placement of every adjective, 
verb, and dangling participle. A typical vision statement for large companies may 
take up to a year to complete and invariably ends up looking like a word salad rather 
than a clear communication of the company’s future. In short, it is a statement which 
unfortunately may communicate very little of substance.
It’s always fun to look for examples of bad vision statements. For example, Avery 
Dennison’s mission statement begins with: “To help make every brand more inspir￾ing, and the world more intelligent.” That’s a pretty heroic aspiration for an outfit 
that makes stick-on labels. Wikipedia has a vision more to the point: “A world in 
which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.” 
Yet neither of these statements addresses what direction the company actually wants 
to head.
With that said, let’s define our vision from the Kenny statement: “A vision state￾ment says what the organization wishes to be like in some years’ time.”
Mission
A mission statement states what we do today and what we will do tomorrow. It is 
strategic in scope. It describes what business the organization is in, both now and 
into the mid-range future, and its task is to provide a direction for its employees to 
work toward. One consultancy states that a mission statement “defines the compa￾ny’s business, its objectives and its approach to reach those objectives.”3 The mission 
statement is supposed to be a summary of what they do, a description of the present 
and a near-term expectation, not a picture of the far-field future. The mission state￾ment should distinguish the organization from other similar organizations.
It can be hard to create a good mission statement. Barnes & Noble, a bookseller, 
conveys their statement as: “Our mission is to operate the best specialty retail 
business in America, regardless of the product we sell.” Note that their mission is 
independent of the product they currently sell; their words and music don’t match. 
Albertsons, a grocery chain, wants “To create a shopping experience that pleases our A Tour of the Inner Core 111
customers; a workplace that creates opportunities and a great working environment 
for our associates; and a business that achieves financial success.” This misses the 
mark, as mission statements should state what the company actually does.
You might suspect that 21st-century digital companies would have different or 
more sophisticated approaches to their mission statements, as these firms represent 
the latest corporate trends and advanced thinking. Table 5.1 lists the current missions 
for a number of familiar digital firms. Surprisingly, the quality of their mission state￾ments ranges from good to poor, no different than legacy companies before them.
That said, let’s settle on this definition of a mission: “In its basic form, a good 
mission statement states what we do to fulfil the vision. It describes what business 
the organization is in for the mid-term timeframe.”
Purpose
A purpose statement declares “Why we do what we do”; that is, what is the firm’s 
reason for existing. It’s why you and your fellow engineers are there, working hard 
every day.
So how does purpose differ from the vision and mission? Vision and mission 
emphasizes how the organization views itself objectively. A purpose is more subjec￾tive. It’s not just about emphasizing clear endpoints and methods to achieve them, 
but also what compels the organization to be in that particular business. It’s motiva￾tional because it connects with the heart as well as the head. Examples of purpose 
include the Dutch financial services company ING (“Empowering people to stay a 
step ahead in life and in business”), the insurer IAG (“To help people manage risk 
and recover from the hardship of unexpected loss”), and Kellogg foods (“Nourishing 
families so they can flourish and thrive”).
Two points about purpose that deserve mention. Not all organizations explicitly 
define their purpose; they view it as already mixed in with their mission or vision 
statements. And that’s fine. The second may have more meaning to you in the future. 
To many people, the purpose of a company is to make as much profit for shareholders 
TABLE 5.1
Sample of 21st-Century Digital Corporation Mission Statements

Twitter “…to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly 
without barriers.”
Apple “…to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative 
hardware, software, and services.”
Meta “…give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”
Note: As of February 2022, the company is not operating under a single mission 
statement.
Amazon “We strive to offer our customers the lowest possible prices, the best available 
selection, and the utmost convenience.”
Zoom “Make video communications frictionless and secure.”112 Navigating the Engineering Organization
as quickly as possible that is legally feasible. Yet there is a substantial movement 
today to redefine a firm’s purpose as something much broader. Called sustainable 
capitalism, this approach advocates that companies must incorporate the interests 
of environmentalism, worker welfare, opportunity inequality, and social justice into 
their reason for being.4 The same intent is being pursued by the Business Roundtable, 
an association of nearly 200 chief executive officers of America’s leading compa￾nies. Their 2019 Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation committed them to 
modify their businesses to include these more holistic purposes.5 The odds are better 
than even that your company, either now or in the near future, will begin to address 
this movement, meaning your work may change to satisfy these new purposes.
Organizational Goals
An organizational goal is a strategic target a company’s senior management estab￾lishes to identify general outcomes that guide corporate efforts. These broad goals 
are normally qualitative, tending not to specify precise numerical values or achieve￾ment metrics. Here, desired achievements are broad-brush. Timing is given as a span 
of time in the mid-range future. An example of an organizational goal might be 
“Become the dominant player in the development of cloud-based storage through 
emerging quantum computing methods.” Note there is no definition of “dominant,” 
nor is any timeframe given. But employee’s efforts are directed toward “emerging 
quantum computing.”
A good definition might be this: “An organizational achievement (or achieve￾ments) delivered in the mid-range future that directly supports the firm’s mission 
and ultimate vision.”
Values and Principles
Values and Principles (also known as Core Values) describe a set of desired organi￾zational behaviors. They are interchangeable terms that serve as a behavioral “com￾pass” for all the firm’s employees. Values and Principles define how the company 
expects people to behave and guide how employees should operate. Almost every 
successful company has a clear set of these principles that foster positive behaviors 
and deter anything that may damage the firm.
For instance, Coca-Cola’s published values include “having the courage to shape 
a better future, leveraging collective genius, being real, and being accountable and 
committed.”
Values are hard to express succinctly, as stating a set of principles in clear, precise 
wording needs a Tolkien, Capote, or Mailer more than a committee of gray-haired 
business types. But the idea is clear.
That said, let’s define values as “the set of guiding beliefs upon which a business 
is based. Corporate values help people function together as one and shape the way 
employees (should) behave.”6
Organizational Culture
Also called the “hidden organization,” an organizational culture is the set of covert, 
shared assumptions, beliefs, and guidelines that determine how to behave and A Tour of the Inner Core 113
operate in a technical, product development, research and development, or technical 
service setting. Like values, these assumptions and beliefs have a strong influence on 
how people in any company act and perform their jobs. Mostly obscure and hard to 
see, the hidden culture exists within all companies and firms, invisibly operating at 
all levels and at all times. Each company’s hidden organization is unique and cannot 
be ignored.
Organizational Objectives
Essentially, organizational objectives are a more detailed and specific version of the 
organizational goals discussed above. They guide employee efforts, justify a com￾pany’s existence and actions, define performance and timing standards, provide bar￾riers to pursuing unnecessary goals, and function as incentives for desired actions. 
Successful technical organizations need objectives that are ambitious, achievable, 
and clear. Most importantly, they must be measurable. They provide the basis of 
a detailed organizational performance tracking system which is the foundation of 
management.
Again, a huge number of written definitions of “objectives” exist, but a solid one 
we will use is:
Objectives are measurable ends for a set process. They identify goals and take action 
to make them happen. Organizational objectives help in setting goals in a way that all 
company-wide activities move in one single direction. It is the future results that an 
organization wants to achieve.7
Strategy
Here comes a major source of confusion in business terminology. Misuse of the term 
“strategy” is extremely common, as it’s applied to just about any and every topic hav￾ing the word “business” in its name.
A strategy is a clear set of choices that define what the firm is going to do (or 
not do) to achieve an organizational objective. Unfortunately, many organizational 
“strategies” are in fact goals. For example, “We want to be the number one or num￾ber two in all the markets in which we operate” is a goal, not a strategy.
A strategy states what you are going to do, not what you hope to achieve. This 
means strategies need to be revisited often to keep them current, as the rapid change 
in the external environment significantly impacts strategy. Strategy is ultimately the 
responsibility of the CEO and their senior management group, and if done right, 
their engagement will align the organization more effectively.
Luckily, a strategy is easy to define. We will use: “A strategy is a clear set of 
choices that define what the firm is going to do to achieve organizational objectives.”8
Business Model
Business models are very popular with MBAs and their ilk. Armies of entrepreneurs 
will corner you during cocktail hour and gas on about their new business model, 
until your eyes glaze over or you can escape to your friends at the bar. Researchers 114 Navigating the Engineering Organization
will tell you there are 16 specialized variations of four basic business models, each 
with specific boundary conditions and so on. That’s fine, but all we need to know 
here is that a business model is what a company specifically does to achieve their 
organizational objective. It’s a detailed version of how your organization transforms 
inputs into outputs to create value. It’s a mini-version of the firm’s strategy, but con￾taining the detailed information that gets the firm where it needs to be. Our resulting 
definition is “A business model is a detailed transformation system that converts 
inputs into outputs in service of the organization’s goals.”9
Transformational Technology
This definition is refreshingly short and simple. We define a transformational tech￾nology as a “work processes, technique, machine, action, analysis, method, tool or 
any other object or knowledge used to transform organizational inputs into outputs.” 
It is not limited to digitally based products but extends to anything that performs 
a transformation: it enables the creation, development, and sale of any product or 
service. Ideally, a transformational technology should be totally contingent on the 
previously defined business model, strategy, objectives, and goals.10
Organizational Structure
An organizational structure is a map of basic relationships between groups or enti￾ties who are charged with getting things done. It is a general arrangement of how 
groups are arranged to create value. These are the basic organizational structures 
such as the traditional hierarchy, matrix, process, agile, and the like that we will 
come to know and love. In general, no individuals are identified at this level, only 
functions. These are the structures shown and discussed later on in Section 5.2.2.
Organization Chart
At last, here we are. So, what is this mysterious thing called an organization chart 
that’s been so hard to get to? An organization chart is a detailed diagram that 
conveys a company’s internal structure by showing formal relationships between 
individuals within the firm. An organization chart graphically represents an organi￾zation's interrelationships, highlighting the different jobs and departments that con￾nect the company’s employees to each other and to management. These charts can 
represent all company groups (depicting the overall company) or can be department 
or workgroup centric.
In Chapter 6 we are going to spend some time on this subject, so for now let’s 
define the organization chart as a construct that attempts to explain the formal 
authority relationship between members of an organization and the work product 
responsibility between those members.
Why have we spilled so much ink defining these terms? Because it’s critical for 
the second part of this chapter: applying these terms to understand your engineering 
organization. We aim to use these expressions as building blocks to understand how 
each interacts to create a viable, successful organization.
Here’s the key understanding. These separate terms interrelate with each other in a 
cascade of information and knowledge called policy deployment. Policy deployment A Tour of the Inner Core 115
means the deliberate and purposeful sharing of broad purposes and desired future 
success, downward into an organization into an ever more detailed division of effort. 
From the top of a multinational behemoth down to the individual engineer, all 
receive the same direction and coordinated into one strong and unified force with 
one intent in mind.
Too bad it rarely works out that way, but that’s the intent.
That said, let’s focus on this idea of policy deployment. The correct way to build 
an effective organization is to deploy the directions given from the “top of the 
house,” consistently down the organizational levels, where ideally everyone has the 
same information and understands it in the same way. This means your group’s for￾mal organization chart is developed as the last step in the policy deployment process 
as shown in Figure 5.2.
A few noteworthy comments. The policy deployment system is based on three 
insights. First, the organization’s structure (be it at the enterprise, departmental or 
group level) must follow the group’s strategy, and that strategy is developed from 
both the group’s surrounding environment and its internal capability. Structure is 
the direct and singular result of strategy. The result is that strategy impacts internal 
organization characteristics, meaning that executives must design the organization to 
support the firm’s competitive strategy. This implies there is not one “best” organiza￾tional structure or form. Instead, structure is always contingent on the organizational 
strategy being pursued. In short, structure follows strategy, and strategy follows 
environment: environment, strategy, structure, and technology all must be aligned. 
This is the heart of contingency theory as applied to organizations.
So, what’s our takeaway? First, it’s a long journey from a company’s vision and mis￾sion statements down to your individual job, and the length of that journey is a large 
problem. With the pressure to do more and more with less and less time to do it, most 
groups and individuals will merely take last year’s objectives, organization chart, and 
performance metrics, put this year’s date on them, and call them good. This obviously 
hurts the integrity of the process and relegates policy deployment to useless bureaucracy.
Second, however onerous, policy deployment is a critical and necessary effort to 
ensure you, your department, and your management are pulling together, driving for 
a common goal with the greatest efficiency and effectiveness possible.
So yes, it’s hard.
And?
5.2 THE FORMAL ORGANIZATION
Having worked through the policy deployment idea, let’s get into an investigation of 
the first component of the Inner Core: the formal organization. As mentioned earlier, 
the formal organization is where all written policies, business structures, methods of 
communication, standard operating procedures, official directions, specified vertical 
and horizontal relationships and all such reside. This component is what you would 
describe if any outsider asked you about your organization. By its very name, it is a 
collection of documented characteristics that defines a prescribed “surface level” of 
the company.116 Navigating the Engineering Organization
5.2.1  The Key Components of Organizational Structures
We’ve already established that the Essential Engineering Framework is just that: 
a relatively flexible relationship of activities that engineering organizations use to 
achieve a desired result. Now we are going to consider a number of organizational 
structures, the more rigid, specified set of relationships that the engineering firm

applies to achieve a narrowly defined output. It is a general map of how groups are 
arranged to create value.
An organizational structure does three important things. First, it designates 
formal reporting relationships, including the number of levels in the manage￾ment hierarchy and the span of control of directors, managers, and supervisors. 
Second, it identifies the grouping together of individuals into departments, and 
departments into the total organization. Finally, it includes the design of systems 
to ensure effective communication, coordination, and integration of effort across 
departments. It is no surprise these are the three characteristics of all organiza￾tional structures.
5.2.2 Organizational Structures: Which and When
For those of you who are breathlessly awaiting to see some organization charts, 
your time is at hand. Remember, the rule regarding organization design is very 
simple: the form of the organization chart reflects the firm’s goals and the method 
used to attain those goals. It’s as simple as that; the chart’s structure is uniquely 
and directly dependent upon the goal being pursued and strategy employed. This 
means that, theoretically, there are an infinite number of organizational forms 
and charts that could be devised. But for most companies that’s too hard and slow 
to actually pursue. So, management experts have conveniently clustered similar 
structures into bins and assigned characteristics to each, creating a “menu” of 
organizational structures and charts to choose from. If your desired result is 
“A,” then choose organization structure “1.” If your desired result is “B,” choose 
structure “2,” and so on.
Let’s take a brief look at each of the major structures and their applicability to 
what kind of result is desired.
Tables 5.2 and 5.3 and Figure 5.3 list eight major structures and their related 
characteristics.
Of course, with this universe of organizational forms available to the boss, how 
do they decide which one to use? After all, we just went through a long policy 
deployment discussion, so shouldn’t that be the basis for the boss’s organization 
chart? Well, it depends on who is doing the organizational design. Some very large 
engineering firms have their own dedicated organizational design departments 
whose job is to assist senior executives in designing efficient and effective orga￾nizations. Provided they already have a completed policy deployment analysis in 
hand, these groups will tend to choose from the list in Table 5.3 and then modify 
the selected structure to account for the unique characteristics of the group under￾going study. And this can work. However, for firms that don’t have the luxury of 
an organizational design department, it falls to the director, manager or sometimes 
even the supervisor to create the organizational design of the group. And with the 
constant specter of “do it fast,” a manager is apt to fall back to one of three basic 
designs. Yes, today there tends to be only three organizational structures used in 
engineering firms. These are the Hierarchy, the Matrix, and, just emerging, the 
Agile.118 Navigating the Engineering Organization TABLE 5.2 Major Characteristics of Engineering Organizational Structures Structure Name Condition of External Environment Interrelationship between Departments Organization Size Goal Operative Goal Planning and Budget Formal Authority Traditional Hierarchical (Functional) Organization Low uncertainty, Stable Routine, low interdependence among departments Small to medium Internal efficiency, quality Functional goal emphasis Cost basis, budget, statistical reports Functional managers Divisional (Product) Organization Nonroutine interdependence among departments Large External effectiveness, adaptation, client satisfaction Product line emphasis Profit center base, cost and income Product managers Geographical Organization Moderate to high uncertainty, environment changing Nonroutine, high interdependence among departments Large External effectiveness, adaption, client satisfaction Product line emphasis Profit center basis, cost and income Product managers Matrix Organization High uncertainty Nonroutine, many interdependencies Moderate, a few product lines Product innovation and technology specialization Equal product and functional emphasis Dual system by function and product line Joint between functional and product heads Hybrid Organization Moderate to high uncertainty, changing customer demands Routine or nonroutine, with some inter dependencies between functions Large External effectiveness, adaption, efficiency within some functions Product line emphasis, some functionals Profit center for divisions, cost basis for central functions Product manager, but with coordination responsibility resting with functional managers

Your management will invariably select the organizational form in which they 
are most familiar. Familiarity is based on history, and the organizational history 
of your group is probably not based on the best organizational form but gener￾ally on what’s come before. And that means it’s easy and quick to implement. So, 
hierarchy begets hierarchy, matrix begets matrix, and the agile will soon beget 
the agile.
Here’s the thing about the agile. The agile assumes that the external environment 
is not only unstable but can actually be a chaotic mass of outside factors spinning 
with ever-increasing velocity until it can’t be confidently analyzed. This environ￾ment can send your organization into a perpetual flux, where small subgroups form, 
detach, and reattach themselves to other groups, complete a task, break away and

move over to some other task, ad infinitum. Speed of product delivery becomes the 
goal in this unstable environment. Thus, the agile is very decentralized and can be 
remarkably difficult to centrally manage.
At the time of this writing, organizations have very limited experience with agile 
in the engineering workplace, as its application is early and currently limited to 
software development. Yet much is being written about it, including suggestions for 
its use in appropriate situations. A good path is to watch and wait: let the appropriate 
foundational experience be gained before moving forward in its application in your 
own situation. And don’t allow your management to pressure you into using it inap￾propriately, purely because of its current buzz.
Finally, consider this thought. The agile represents a case of trying to respond to 
a chaotic environment. Yet not all suborganizations in the firm are in these unstable

environments: all of the remaining organizational forms, such as a hierarchy, matrix, or 
any other configuration must still be in place due to their slower but still moving envi￾ronments. Yet accelerating environmental change means the duration of each of these 
forms moves from years to perhaps months, so an ever-better communication system 
must be anticipated. Communication between agile, hierarchy, matrix, and any other 
forms becomes a critical problem, both today and in the future.
5.2.3  The Divine Trinity of Product Development
Product and process development is where many (if not most) of you will end up as 
you enter the company. As the names imply, product development is the creation and 
bringing to market of some sort of object that provides a benefit to a customer, while 
process development is the creation or improvement of an internal system that allows 
that object to be produced more quickly, cheaply, or with higher quality.
If you are working for a product or process development organization, you will 
soon see there are three major groups that must act in concert to successfully achieve 
their goal. These are:
1. An engineering activity, charged with innovating, designing, testing, and 
otherwise bringing the product or process into a state of feasibility, which 
is the judgment that a design will actually work within the specifications of 
the original idea.
2. A marketing activity, which defines and certifies the characteristic profile 
of the customer (be they inside or outside the firm) and if they will actually 
part with their money to obtain the offered product or process.
3. A business office, led by a Project Manager or Director, who synthesizes 
the output of engineering and marketing with their own business analysis to 
ensure the final product or service achieves an adequate amount of revenue 
and meets other appropriate business metrics. This Project Manager is the 
ultimate decision-maker. Also located inside the business office is a project 
management group, charged with ensuring the “nuts and bolts” of project 
timing and development gateways are met.
Each member of this “divine trinity” of engineering, marketing, and business office 
is a power center, influencing the final form, functionality, and ultimate success of 
the end product. As a power center, engineering in product or process development 
takes the form of the seven functions defined in Chapter 1 (Research, Development, 
Design, Test, Production, Construction, and Operations), with engineers and tech￾nology specialists executing each of those functions. Engineering will have its own 
requirements and goals for each portion of the project in question.
As another power center, marketing’s job is to understand the external or internal 
customer and judge if the product being designed meets the spoken (and unspoken) 
desires of the end user. This can be a tricky business, as knowing precisely who the 
customer is, what are their true needs, and what they would be willing to pay for the 
product is typically more art than science. Complicating the problem is that customer A Tour of the Inner Core 127
surveys of current and potential future products are notoriously inaccurate. As men￾tioned in Chapter 4, customers have a way of not revealing their real thoughts about 
products; a reluctance to tell their true feelings to relative strangers or having the 
willingness to consider new ideas.
As the third center, the business office is an interesting amalgam of business 
school graduates, financiers, schedulers, and optimizers whose job (they feel) is to 
pass judgment on the information and recommendations that engineering and mar￾keting provide. As mentioned, the Project Manager is nominally the ultimate deci￾sion-maker for the product, absorbing insights from engineering and marketing and 
balancing them with their own views as to what is best for the product.
These three centers will exhibit various degrees of conflict as each attempt to 
push the project in the direction they prefer and believe is correct. Reasonable con￾flict is good for the product, but there is always the specter of a dysfunctional strug￾gle where the product suffers. Having three power centers in the trinity creates a 
built-in tiebreaker and makes resolving conflicts a bit easier.
What does all this mean for a new engineer like yourself? Obviously, it means 
learning to advocate for your engineering position to both marketing and the busi￾ness office as a routine part of the job. Your arguments regarding the best engineer￾ing position will undoubtedly be based on objective data. Marketing will base their 
recommendations on “soft” data from market research and their prior experience, 
while the business office will present endless cost–benefit ratios and other analy￾sis based on financial projections. And don’t forget the decision-maker, the Project 
Manager, who oversees the whole muddle. How do you ensure your engineering 
positions are honestly considered and (hopefully) included?
The secret is surprisingly simple but challenging. In addition to engineering con￾cerns, you must also be reasonably conversant with the everyday workings of both 
the marketing and business offices. When arguing any question or advocating any 
course of action, an advocate must know if an opponent’s analysis is solid or shaky, 
precise or approximate, or if their technique is appropriate or their premise faulty. 
You need to know their financial terms (such as ROI, ROA, net revenue, capital 
investment, churn, bluebird sale) and so on. Marketing and business methods cannot 
be a black box; a new engineer must understand how their analysis was conducted 
(if any was actually conducted at all) and how their conclusions drawn. In a word, 
you eventually need to know their business nearly as well as your own or risk getting 
bamboozled.
This may be an alarming bit of news, but this is the essence of experience. After 
all, this is really what a new employee job rotation program is all about. Experienced 
engineers and management know this already and can help you learn this skill. Just 
realize that school didn’t end at a graduation ceremony; you’ve merely changed sub￾jects for the next few years.
5.3 HUMAN AND HARD RESOURCES
Obviously, nothing gets done without resources. Resources are a critical enabler of 
your work, a necessary but not sufficient requirement to achieve the organization’s 128 Navigating the Engineering Organization
objectives. As mentioned earlier, it’s a good bet that many engineers think of resources 
as inanimate objects but sometimes neglect the human portion of the resource ques￾tion: the talent, creativity, and innovation people can bring to their workplace.
We also know human resources cover employee-related topics such as labor rela￾tions, new hire selection, job roles, interpersonal dynamics, conflict resolution, and 
the like, while hard resources are any non-organic item of value, such as equipment, 
workspace, funding, and information. Let’s consider each.
5.3.1  The Same, But Not
But wait a minute. We already talked about this whole resource idea back in Chapter 
4, where human and hard resources are part of the input element. Yes, we did. But 
now it’s time we introduce a new twist to the resource discussion. This twist has to 
do with your organization’s boundary.
We’ve learned that the boundary determines what is inside or outside an organi￾zation. A complete understanding of your engineering firm, your entire organiza￾tional worldview, revolves around the placement of that border. It’s simple: what’s 
inside the line is yours; what’s outside the line is someone else’s. This holds for both 
human resources and those hard, non-organic assets. Management defines where the 
border is: around the group or department, around the division or around the firm, or 
around some other configuration. The key is to actually define and know precisely 
where the line is.
This means something important when it comes to resources. The upshot is you 
actually have two supplies of human and hard resources available: those already in 
place within your home organization and those that are procured from outside the 
boundary, i.e., outside your department or firm.
The rules are simple. For any initiative or project you are assigned to, your 
supervisor or manager will first draw upon all the appropriate human and hard 
resources available from inside the organization’s boundary. These tend to be a 
fixed, predetermined amount. Only after those internal resources are exhausted 
will the search begin beyond the local boundary, be it within adjoining depart￾ments or into the external environment itself. This is why the boundary is so 
important. A natural bias is to consider resources outside the boundary as more 
expensive, harder to procure, of lesser quality or tougher to manage than those 
internal to you. This may be true.
However, there are situations where an engineer is forced to acquire hard or human 
resources from outside the boundary. For example, say your department is entering 
into a new technology space. Being new work, the department will probably not have 
the required tools, facility, or talent at hand to succeed. Bringing in the required 
new resources can be done in scores of different ways. If the new business is an 
experiment, this means new resources will be temporary: leasing rather than buying 
space, hiring contract workers (agency workers or “job-shoppers”) rather than per￾manent employees, and obtaining one-time funding only. If the new technology has 
a firm commitment from management (and we mean a firm commitment), permanent 
resources are required: training and education of new and existing employees for the A Tour of the Inner Core 129
new technology, long-term capital investment in hard resources like facilities and 
equipment, and appropriate operational funding committed for many years.
The takeaway here is that resources used by you and your group can come from 
a wide and disparate universe of sources, from strictly internal to company-wide, 
or even deep into the external environment. This goes for any resource: hard and 
human alike.
At this point, since resources can be human or hard, internal or external, there 
are four combinations that can be used to supply your needs. We’ll get into this a bit 
more in Chapter 7. For now, let’s move on to the Technology System.
5.4 THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM
The Essential Engineering Framework tells us the entire Inner Core constitutes the 
transformation system of the company, where the five components together trans￾form inputs into outputs of enhanced value. The technology system is where the 
actual, tangible work gets done. It is the “Core of the Inner Core,” and its product is 
the whole point of your and everyone else's employment. A technology system can be 
simple, like making popcorn at a movie theater, but within engineering it is normally 
exceedingly large and complex, incorporating uncounted procedures applied within 
intricate and interlocking subsystems. The technology system must be designed to 
support everything from product development to R&D, advanced manufacturing 
technologies to new technology processes, test methods to sociotechnical design, 
all connected to enabling departmental technologies at the enterprise, departmental, 
individual, and information system levels.
5.4.1  Technology vs. Transformation Systems
We should take a moment and specify two items that are normally confused. What 
is a technology, and what is a transformation? They are different.
As previously mentioned, this book defines technology differently than what is 
commonly thought or meant. In everyday usage (e.g., popular media or sitting at 
home among your friends), “technology” refers exclusively to common, digitally 
based products and features. Your cell phone, tablet, the safety features in your car 
and refrigerators that tell you when more milk is needed: these are all considered 
technologies in this context. These are not the technologies we will be referring to 
here. In organizational studies, technology is defined as the techniques, skills, meth￾ods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplish￾ment of objectives. These include manufacturing technologies, product and service 
development technologies, and work methods deployed by various organization lev￾els such as department, individual, and information system echelons. In this con￾struct, a technology is a tool to accomplish something.
A transformation is different from a technology. A transformation is a process 
where any input, when combined with all five inner core components, creates an out￾put of greater value than the inputs and resources initially provided. A chef creates 
a transformation when creating a wonderful boeuf bourguignon: their spoon is the 130 Navigating the Engineering Organization
technology. An auto mechanic creates a transformation when repairing the transmis￾sion of your car: their ratchet is the technology.
In a nutshell, a transformation is a result, a goal achieved, a unit of work accom￾plished. In contrast, a technology is a tool, used in service of accomplishing a 
transformation.
5.5 THE HIDDEN ORGANIZATION
The Hidden Organization is easily the most interesting and complex area of the 
Core. Also known by other names such as organizational culture, corporate 
culture, informal organization, or hidden culture, it’s seen as an invisible set of 
values, norms, guiding beliefs, and understandings that are shared by members 
of an organization and taught to new members as the proper way to behave and 
perceive. It is where unwritten knowledge is shared, where deals are cut and 
covert agreements are made. It is where organizations can become amazingly 
successful or sink without a trace. Frankly, it can be the most important compo￾nent of the Core.
For those in need of a formal definition of the hidden organization, there are many 
to choose from, which we will discuss further in Chapter 9. In the meantime, we will 
use this:
The [hidden] organization is the interlocking social structure that governs how people 
work together in practice. It is the aggregate of norms, personal and professional con￾nections through which work gets done and relationships are built among people who 
share a common organizational affiliation or cluster of affiliations. It consists of a 
dynamic set of personal relationships, social networks, communities of common inter￾est, and emotional sources of motivation. The [hidden] organization evolves, and the 
complex social dynamics of its members also.11
We can have a really good argument regarding if any organization could survive 
without its own culture, let alone prosper. For most experienced employees the 
answer would be “no.” Culture has strength and depth. It has layers of subcultures, 
any of which can be very hard to identify. And searching for and dealing with culture 
can absorb a major amount of your energy and attention.
The purpose of culture is to turn the pieces of a disparate organization into an 
effective “whole” through integration of the group’s many components. This internal 
integration includes using a common language, agreeing on group boundaries, the 
criteria for member inclusion and allocation of status, power, and authority, how to 
distribute rewards and punishments, and generally helping to manage the unman￾ageable. It is a covert adjunct to the overt structures and processes of the formal 
organization. It can accelerate and enhance responses to unanticipated events, foster 
innovation, and enable people to solve problems that require collaboration.
It can also prevent all this from happening.
As an engineer, the hidden organization is very important to you, even though it is 
largely invisible. And because it deals with “softer” topics such as leadership norms, A Tour of the Inner Core 131
group dynamics, power, interdepartmental relations, and other concerns impacting 
the social norms of your group, you need to know it, cold.
Let me share a personal experience. When I first started in engineering, I firmly 
believed anything having to do with group relationships or workplace behaviors was 
flat-out immaterial to me. I believed that engineering work performance was based 
on a strict meritocracy: correct results, delivered with high quality was all that mat￾tered. As a newbie, not only did I initially doubt culture’s existence; I believed that 
even if it was real, it had no business in the workplace. On a good day, I might have 
given it (maybe) a 5% impact on my professional life. And this view was common 
with the other new hires around me.
Over the next few years, my view changed. Each year I discovered a new way of 
how the hidden organization impacted my work. And I’m not talking about politics, 
which I now believe I initially confused with culture. I discovered that the formal 
organization, with its strong rules and boundaries, was incapable of dealing with the 
inherent “messiness” of real people working together. The workarounds, the invis￾ible knowledge people might possess and share, the experiences that create learning; 
all come from the culture. In a word, I found the hidden organization to be my friend. 
By the time I reached perhaps 15 years of experience working within technical orga￾nizations, my judgment was that corporate culture impacted at least 50% of my work 
life. I became a believer, and I wasn’t the only one. If you ask any experienced engi￾neer or technical specialist in your company, they will tell you without hesitation the 
corporate culture is a large and mightily important component of their performance 
and professional career.
5.5.1 Cultural Strength
On first look, it may not seem that something that is hidden could be classified as 
being either strong or weak. Yet organizational cultures and subcultures definitely have 
strength. Cultural strength is the degree of agreement among members of the organi￾zation about the importance of specific values. If there is widespread agreement or 
consensus, that indicates a strong culture. Likewise, little agreement indicates weak 
cohesion. Strength (and its resulting internal consistency) depends on several factors: 
the stability of the group, the amount of time the group has existed, the intensity of the 
group’s shared experiences and learnings, how the learnings take place, and the clarity 
of the assumptions and values held by the founders and leaders of the group. Like a 
championship soccer team fighting through a long season, the shared experiences and 
beliefs developed on the team’s journey to a championship determine the overriding 
culture going forward. Culture is an ongoing, changing entity, not a slogan.
An interesting example of cultural strength is “the good soldier.” A good soldier
in a corporation is seen as someone who blindly (and without second thoughts) does 
exactly what management wants and in a way that submerges their own individual￾ity. This behavior is a direct result of a strong culture and is commonly witnessed 
in new hires who want to demonstrate adherence and allegiance to their new group.
The power of this type of culture can be overwhelming. Very extreme examples 
are well known, such as the Jonestown massacre of 1978. The Jonestown People’s 132 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Temple in Guyana was a religious cult led by a self-proclaimed minister named 
Jim Jones. After the murder of officials investigating the group (including a U.S. 
Congressman), Jones was able to convince some 900 adherents of this cult to col￾lectively commit suicide in the name of their leader and organization. Jonestown 
remains one of the most infamous examples of the good soldier culture, and in fact 
the phrase “Drink the Kool-Aid” came directly from the Jonestown tragedy.
5.5.2  Subcultures
As the name implies, subcultures are a subset of an overall culture and reflect the 
common problems, goals, and experiences that members share on a team, depart￾ment, or other unit residing deeper within an organization. This makes sense, as 
we’ve learned that organizations do not share a single, monolithic organizational 
structure but are an amalgam of many structures based on the reality and goals of 
different levels. This means it’s possible for a single organization to hold conflicting 
values and manifest inconsistent behavior while having complete consensus on the 
group’s underlying assumptions.
We are going to spend some significant time examining cultures and subcultures 
in Chapter 9, sensitizing yourself to see subcultures, assessing their strength and 
depth, and deciding your place within them. For now, just be aware that subculture 
has a significant role to play in your work life, and mastery of it is not only important 
but also essential.
5.6 UBIQUITOUS COMMUNICATION
As you already know, a firm’s communication network refers to how information 
flows within an organization. These networks are regular and irregular patterns of 
person-to-person, group-to-group, and person-to-group relationships through which 
information moves and is consumed. This means that information must be thought￾fully designed, managed, regulated, and structured on a continuum from an effec￾tive, formal system to an equally effective but informal, covert arrangement.
In this book, a ubiquitous communication network is meant to meld the previous 
four Core components into an effective “whole” with an optimum level of multi￾directional and multidimensional information exchange. A ubiquitous communica￾tions network is designed to cement all these components into a strong, robust, and 
interdependent network, using all technological and personal means available.
This means that ubiquitous communication is not a two-dimensional construct 
but a three-dimensional concept. All Core areas should be connected to all others 
by every appropriate path, method, and mode possible. And ideally, not only should 
information pathways be ubiquitous; they should also be frictionless.
This is not easy. A reoccurring struggle with communications in any organiza￾tion is breaking down the natural walls that each Core area erects to protect their 
perceived “turf.” In other words, to control their domain.
If we are to create this communication paradise, several decisions are necessary. 
The first has to do with what should be communicated to what areas of the Core, A Tour of the Inner Core 133
what information does not need to be communicated, and which information needs 
to be communicated but is not, caused by either valid or invalid reasons. In other 
words, transparency.
There is one school of thought that says greater transparency is always better for 
the organization. Another school of thought says that, to maintain confidentiality 
and reduce risk, certain information should be strictly limited to those on a “need￾to-know” basis.
One of the hardest tricks for any group or engineer like yourself is balancing 
information transparency versus information containment. Your supervisor will 
probably spend much of his or her time performing this balancing act. It is also a 
prime area that can create embarrassment or praiseworthy moments for you person￾ally if brought before many eyes. For instance, many experienced engineers have 
had meetings with higher-level executives (say, a vice president plus a dozen direc￾tors from multiple departments) presenting a report of some kind. No matter how 
the presenter attempts to balance the information transparency vs. confidentiality, 
regularly one of the directors will complain “they are not receiving the informa￾tion.” Inevitably, the vice president will turn to the presenting engineer (i.e., you) 
and direct you to provide the information, even though it may not be appropriate for 
that director to receive it. The vice president wants to show in public they personally 
are a “team player” and are open, with nothing to hide. In reality, the vice president 
knows the director shouldn’t have the information but passes the problem to you. The 
dilemma is usually solved through a discussion with your mid-level management, 
but you understand the point.
So, the whole idea of “maximum” communications vs. “optimum” communica￾tions comes into play when thinking about ubiquity. More is not always better. As 
you’ve surely experienced, information overload is a real danger that must be pur￾posely designed out of the system, leaving us to communicate the right information 
at the right time in the right amount in the right form to the right people. This is no 
small trick to pull off, and we’ll address this and other communications conundrums 
relating specifically to you in Chapter 10.

5.7 REALIZATIONS
Hopefully, our tour through the Inner Core has convinced you this is a place to really 
care about. As an aspiring professional, mastery of the Core is the first and most 
important task as you enter this new territory of formal structures, resources, tech￾nologies, culture, and communications. The chances of receiving meaningful assign￾ments are limited until you demonstrate some understanding of these components.
The Core defines the fundamental interrelationship between these five areas. It is 
the map of how you can get things done and successfully compete in both your local 
organization and within the greater enterprise. It’s the guide to understanding just 
what is going on inside your engineering home.
A foundational idea within organizations is the concept of policy deployment; 
the cascading of the firm’s vision, mission, purpose, goals (and all the rest) down￾ward until it arrives at your workstation or desk. Following this deployment process 134 Navigating the Engineering Organization
results in an extremely well-defined and clear picture of the desired direction for 
your department and your company. And it is rarely (if ever) fully employed in the 
everyday life of an engineering company. Only bits and pieces are used, and only 
when they take minimum time and effort to accomplish. In short, management views 
policy deployment as more of a task with little upside and substantial waste. This is 
a mistake.
The formal organization is what you would expect, where all visible policies, 
structures, work methods, standard procedures, relationships, and all such reside. 
Combining the formal organization, policy deployment, and contingency theory 
together creates the many, many organizational structures engineering firms use 
every day. And an engineering department is not an island: it continually requires 
the cooperation of both the marketing and business office in an honest and competi￾tive relationship, best described as “Trust; but verify.”
Resources enable you to do your work and accomplish things. Defined as either 
hard or human, they come to you from various places and in various forms. Two 
main sources of these resources are available: those already in place within your 
home organization, and those that are procured from outside the department or firm. 
They extend from inorganic objects to talented individuals. Sometimes they are easy 
to obtain, sometimes they are impossible to acquire. Taken alone, they are a neces￾sary, but insufficient, condition for success.
Technology is a tool to help transform an input into a desired output. The 
Technology System is the component where the tangible work gets done. In this 
construct, a technology is a tool used to accomplish something. A transformation is 
a slightly different concept, a goal reached or target achieved.
The hidden organization (or corporate culture) is a mostly invisible society of 
beliefs, understandings, and actions that make up the social system of your work￾place. It’s seen as a covert set of values, norms, guiding beliefs, and understand￾ings that are shared by members of an organization and seen as correct. It is where 
unwritten knowledge is shared, and where trust, relationships, and the quid pro quo
happen. The hidden organization is many times a complex and confusing place yet 
is essential for your success.
A communication network controls how information flows within an organiza￾tion. The network can be both regular and irregular patterns of relationships and 
tools through which information moves and is consumed. That information must be 
managed, regulated, and structured on a continuum from an effective, formal system 
to an equally effective but informal, covert arrangement.
The key role of ubiquitous communication is to hold the other four components 
together in a spherical, 360-degree construct. When thinking about ubiquity, the 
whole idea of “maximum” communications vs. “optimum” communications comes 
into play. More is not always better. Information overload and unacceptable quality is 
a real danger that must be purposely designed out of the system, leaving us to com￾municate only correct, timely, and meaningful information.
So, we’ve gotten through our tour of the Inner Core, our introduction to the heart 
of the Essential Engineering Framework. What you’ve just read are how things

actually work once we apply those unspoken, messy factors like popular common 
practice, the impact of workers’ varying experience, the fallibility of systems, and 
just the plain old stuff that surprises us each day.
Let the games begin.

6 Navigating the Formal 
Organization
6.1 UNDERSTANDING THE FORMAL ORGANIZATION
At this point, we’ve introduced the Essential Engineering Framework, dissected its 
various elements, toured its Inner Core, and completed a basic examination of each 
component within that Core. It’s now time to begin the real work: uncover, correct, 
and prevent the common mistakes and misunderstandings you may encounter as we 
carefully inch our way over this barrier called the Great Divide.
Let’s begin with the first component, the formal organization, shown in Figure 
6.1. As covered in Chapter 5, the characteristics of formal organizations include 
highly defined organizational structures, detailed organization charts, prescribed 
methods of communication, rigid vertical and horizontal linkages, written policies, 
and standard operating procedures. Each of these characteristics is well defined and 
normally codified within the organization’s operations and policy websites. Yet what 
is shown on these websites is a crumb compared to what is truly needed; that is, a 
very large part of formal organizational knowledge is missing.
This chapter will focus on the fundamental topics that will help provide those 
missing insights. These topics cover managing the relationships with your first- and 
second-level management, the paradox of organizational timing, and the perceived 
security of the formal organization chart. Other discussions will explore the role 
of contingency in setting goals, methods, and structures, operating around power, 
politics, and conflict, and “soft” engineering standards. Let’s start with managing 
the relationship with your immediate supervisor and their boss.
6.2 MANAGEMENT OF MANAGEMENT
New employees like yourself generally begin their professional lives focusing on 
developing and delivering individual projects or assignments. Hitting the due dates, 
learning the technology, and figuring out how to get from here to there are all appro￾priate and necessary to achieve initial success. Here the mindset is “self”: focusing 
on the tasks that you as a new employee can directly control and have clear respon￾sibility for.
At this point, the idea of managing “up,” that is, concentrating on the viewpoints, 
wants, and needs of your immediate supervisor and your supervisor’s boss may not 
have occurred yet. Early on, this first- and second-level management territory tends 
to be a void, and no map is available to even begin to navigate through it.
This brings us to some key questions about your work. What is the goal of your 
efforts? Why are you doing it? Yes, a common goal is to complete your assignments

successfully. Certainly, you are doing it to create some awesome technologies and 
solve problems, to make some money, gain position and security, and perhaps earn 
the respect of your peers and superiors.
But some will argue those goals are not primary; they are secondary. They will 
contend your basic, primary goal, the reason you are there, is to solve your boss’s 
problems. And your bosses’ purpose is to solve their own bosses’ problems. No more 
and no less. All the individual goals mentioned above are subordinate to serving 
the goals of your management, be it local, divisional, or even at the enterprise level. 
Solving their problems solves your problems.
Consider the world through your management’s eyes. As supervisors, manag￾ers, and directors of their organizations, their problems are nearly infinite. They are 
probably receiving poor direction, unclear objectives, and continuously changing 
timing. They are short of time, funding, and perhaps energy. They are stressed, and 
it is your goal to uncover exactly what are their problems: the immediate and longer 
term, the important and the trivial, the new and the reoccurring. It is the responsibil￾ity of every group member to search for clues to your bosses’ problems and needs, to 
uncover their worries and concerns, and to aim their work to fulfill those needs. In 
short, a new hire needs to understand the pressures on their local management and 
respond accordingly. This is not easy, but fortunately for new engineers, manage￾ment will communicate some of their needs through the initial assignments they give

you. Keep in mind, for every assignment you receive, your supervisor is attempting 
to solve their own related, underlying problem. As time moves on, you will become 
more skilled at uncovering your bosses’ concerns and help alleviate them. But for 
now, begin to develop this skill.
One important caveat will condition your investigations into management needs. 
Each boss has a worldview, a certain set of beliefs, facts, and experiences that impact 
how they see their environment and, consequently, how they behave and react to 
it. For example, some bosses may have had their early formative experiences in a 
highly formal or bureaucratic organization, where personal conversations are lim￾ited, work is intense, and a certain interpersonal distance is always maintained. They 
may have learned this is the “proper” way to run a department. Or perhaps they 
learned in a more relaxed setting, where the atmosphere is lighter but excellence in 
the work product is still expected. Or some management may favor a more unusual, 
highly inventive, unstructured way of working, as personified by the Googleplex and 
Apple Park headquarters buildings, whose designs are purposely meant to foster 
new, informal ways of working.
As you already know, basic organizational behaviors tend to divide people into 
fundamental types. These types are combinations of emotional and rational charac￾teristics that constitute an individual’s worldview, and these can vary widely.
Hopefully, your supervisor or manager will know and understand their own world￾view and personal characteristics and their resulting approaches to management. 
They may even share them with you without you having to investigate. However, this 
probably will not happen as the natural tendency of first-level supervision is to com￾partmentalize information into convenient chunks that can be easily concealed. Yet 
understanding your supervisor or manger’s worldview is foundational in understand￾ing your workplace. This means practicing observing and analyzing your manage￾ment’s actions, beliefs, and personal characteristics over time.
6.2.1 Mapping Your Management’s Worldview
This brings us to the actual impact of your management’s style or worldview 
on your own daily work. A few initial thoughts. First, employees need to attend 
to two levels of management: not just the immediate supervisor but also the 
supervisor’s boss, usually a manager. Remember, employees are there to solve 
their supervisor’s problems, and most of the supervisor’s problems come from 
the supervisor’s own boss. Second, as touched on above, employees need to 
understand their management’s worldview and resulting attitudes. These tend 
to be bundled into three categories of management mindset, which we can call 
Normal, Proper, and Unusual:
1) Normal: A mainstream and balanced approach to their colleagues, staff, 
and work products. These are typically people you can relate to, and they 
get things done. Generally characterized by being easy to interact with.
2) Proper: A “by the book,” formal and rigid approach to their work and their 
direct reports. “Propers” are more methodical and stick to all the rules 142 Navigating the Engineering Organization
meticulously. For example, if there is a company logoed T-shirt they would 
naturally wear it as many days as possible.
3) Unusual: Unpredictable in their perceptions, work results, ways of process￾ing information, and interpersonal behavior, tending to keep you a bit off￾balance. Another description of an Unusual is “none of” the previous two 
definitions.
Table 6.1 shows a basic guide to understanding your bosses for whatever combination of 
management worldviews they exhibit. Say you have a “normal” (mainstream) worldview 
and are placed in a department with both levels of supervision are also judged as “nor￾mal.” Good for you; this is an easily manageable situation. Expectations are reasonable, 
communication will probably be good, and surprises are rare; a good fit results. Not so 
when both bosses are “proper” while you tend to be unusual. A clear misfit, and your 
unusual characteristics will have to be submerged while at work, where in effect you 
become a façade of someone you are not. You can probably do this in the short run, but 
it can become an untenable and unhappy situation in the long term.
The overarching point here is that the “fit” (in this case, the worldview) held by 
you, your first-level supervisor, and second-level manager must be reasonable. Not 
perfect, but good enough to be able to work together in pursuit of a common goal. 
Some matches will just not work; these happen all the time and result in someone 
moving on (perhaps you can guess who). But this assessment tool can help figure out 
why your management took some action or asked for a certain assignment and guide 
your response to it.1
Another clue surrounding your management’s worldview comes from Massey’s 
Generational Sociology concept. Any significant emotional event sparks a calcifi￾cation of people’s attitudes, beliefs, and values at that moment in time. Today, it’s 
easy to predict the 2020–2022 global COVID-19 pandemic is the defining emotional 
event for many lives. Your values may be strongly linked to this event. But chances 
are your supervisor or manager will have a different set of significant emotional 
events leading to a worldview that may be very different from what you hold. The 
9/11 generation (terrorism as a significant threat) or the Great Recession generation 
of 2008–2011 (the risk of losing all retirement savings) may be what drives your 
manager’s attitudes and actions. Whatever the specifics, there are most likely sig￾nificant unconscious emotional differences between you and your management. The 
challenge is to assess their values set and respond accordingly, which means deliver￾ing solutions that meet your own definition of good or right while honoring the value 
set of your management. One good trend is that supervisors and managers are prob￾ably closer in age to you than senior management, so it’s probably easier to connect 
to them than with their own seniors.
No discussion of management would be complete without touching on that most 
dreaded type of boss: the micromanager. Micromanagers have been famous for cen￾turies, inflicting their way of thinking on untold millions of innocent workers around 
the world.
As you probably already guess, a micromanager is someone who is compelled to 
direct an employee to do something and then closely, continuously, and suffocatingly Navigating the Formal Organization 143

watches them do the work. Their corrective comments are continuous, and anxiety 
fills the air. I once had a micromanager who stood over me and dictated what they 
wanted my report to say. Finding dictation too slow, my manager literally moved me 
out of my chair, then sat down at my computer, and typed the assignment themselves. 
Apparently, hovering over my shoulder wasn’t enough.
A good supervisor should give direction on what they want, but unless the 
employee is very new, not specify how it should be done: that is the employee’s role. 
Micromanagers are the opposite. They tell you what they want, how they want you 
to do it, where they want it, and exactly what it should look like, and then check with 
you every half-hour on your progress.
Dealing with the micromanager is hard, and strategies abound on how to get them 
to stop this behavior. But like any way of managing your management, it’s highly 
contingent on who you are dealing with. The good news is with some observation 
and just a little experience with that particular boss, a nicely communicated reassur￾ance, repeatedly given, should reduce their behavior with low consequences.
Or maybe not.
What about trust? This should be obvious. An experienced engineer (or anyone, 
really) will state that trust is a major prerequisite to having the boss accept your work 
and, by extension, you. In engineering groups, as in all of society, trust is the “coin 
of the realm.” High trust means others give more weight to your words and results, 
leading to more personal impact, resulting in management gaining more respect and 
comfort with you.
Good managers know that success in guiding an organization is all about the 
people on their staff, and trust is a major component defining excellent people. A 
manager looks for three things when establishing trust:
1) A manager must be able to believe what you tell them.
2) A manager must have confidence in the correctness and accuracy of what 
you are telling them.
3) You must honestly tell the manager what you don’t know about the topic at 
hand. This is critical, and as important as the information you do know.
This third point needs to be emphasized. There are two types of “not knowing.” The 
first is when briefing your management and a question is posed with an answer that 
is truly not known by anyone. As no one knows, it’s easy to state so. The second 
type covers when you are asked a question that may have known answers, but it’s 
just you who doesn’t know the information. There is rarely shame in not knowing 
an answer to a question posed in a conversation or meeting. The landmine here is 
attempting to pretend you know the answer when you don’t. This is very easy to see 
through and rarely works. Instead, immediately acknowledge you don’t know and 
offer to get back to them with the answer as soon as possible. Then you must keep 
your commitment and immediately provide the information to the requester after the 
conversation. While this is apparent, it amazes bosses how many first-level engineers 
(and others) fail to act on these guidelines. The simple lesson on building trust can be 
summarized in the old adage, “Say what you do and do what you say.”Navigating the Formal Organization 145
Of course, there are some relationship principles between you and your man￾agement which are essentially universal. One of these is keeping your management 
informed and in the right way. Another is seeing what needs to be done and just 
doing it. That is a wonderful thing for the boss and potentially for you. However, the 
skill here is deciding what things you can do on your own without informing the boss 
and what things you need to let your management know about before doing, and, of 
course, then keeping them appropriately informed as you proceed.
Let’s consider Steve Anderson, who, like most other new employees, wanted 
to take advantage of his company’s ongoing education program. This program 
would cover the cost of a master’s degree or other continuing education study 
for approved employees. Steve looked up the program information on his com￾pany’s website, saw the link to the application, filled it out, and submitted it to the 
company’s human resources department. Unfortunately, Steve neglected to do one 
thing: he did not talk to his manager prior to making the application. As the fund￾ing for the program came from the manager’s home organization, Steve essentially 
spent his boss’s money without their knowledge. His manager was totally surprised 
when some of his budget disappeared, which resulted in a friendly parent–child 
chat in the conference room.
Managers and supervisors need to be informed of all appropriate activity going 
on both inside and outside their local organization. The key word is appropriate. It 
is your judgment to decide what is appropriate to inform your management and what 
is not. A good rule of thumb says if your potential action impacts people or organi￾zations outside your local group, involves spending money, or in some way impacts 
the reputation of your department, be sure to check with your supervisor or manager 
before going ahead. This is different than the “Seeing what needs to be done and 
doing it” approach, which at this point is reserved for internal group business. A 
good way to judge which action to take is to simply put yourself in your manage￾ment’s shoes. Managers and supervisors hate surprises, and if a proposed action will 
surprise them, it’s best to let them know. When in doubt, just tell them.
6.3 THE PARADOX OF ORGANIZATIONAL TIMING
One thing all engineers can agree upon is the certainty of time. Time is a known 
quality, steady and constant, defined and measured with amazing accuracy by the 
best scientists and physicists around the globe. Beginning with the ancient astrono￾mers, measuring time by the movement of the sun, moon, and stars thousands of 
years ago, time is now measured by the most sophisticated technologies available. 
Today, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology defines the sec￾ond as the amount of time radiation takes to go through 9,192,631,770 cycles at the 
frequency emitted by Cesium atoms when making the transition from one state to 
another. It is said these Cesium clocks are so accurate that they will be off by only 
one second over about 30 million years. Amazing.
Yet there are other, completely different definitions of time. When it comes to 
an engineering organization’s concept of time, it is not the precise and irrefutable 
measurement of frequency. The concept of “organizational time” (i.e., how time is 146 Navigating the Engineering Organization
perceived and applied within organizations) has multiple forms, none having to do 
with the cycles of Cesium.
Organizational time is a paradox. It is highly contingent; it is variable. It disap￾pears, reappears, and disappears again. It stretches and contracts. It is a commodity, 
yet it has substantial individual value. It can be hoarded like gold or wasted like a 
discarded sheet of paper. It can pass blindingly fast or drag on with horrible slow￾ness. It has multiple meanings, totally dependent upon the understanding of its users. 
In short, time is distressingly chaotic.
New engineers need to embrace this paradox of organizational time, understand 
its relevancy to other engineers and non-engineers alike, and, most critically, solve 
problems based on this unpredictable paradox.
Context is key. Consider the case where you need to visit an innovative equip￾ment supplier, a startup designing a new Lidar sensor for an autonomous pack￾age delivery robot. The supplier is located in a loft in mid-town Manhattan, 
so your plan is to fly into LaGuardia airport, take a Lyft from LaGuardia to 
mid-town, and conduct the meeting at the startup’s loft. To plan the trip, you 
need to know, “How far is LaGuardia from mid-town?” You probably will con￾sult your navigation app and discover the answer is “8.9 miles.” Yet if you ask 
your chief engineer’s administrative assistant helping to plan the trip, the answer 
will be “41 minutes.” And ask the startup’s CEO, and they will say, “$47.” All 
three answers are correct; it’s the context of miles, time, or cost that changes the 
answer completely.
Examples of variable organizational time abound. Say you are given a 24-hour 
deadline by your director to complete a power-use analysis for a new integrated 
circuit. The tight deadline forces you to make some simplifying assumptions that 
turn out to be wrong. At the 24-hour review, those incorrect assumptions come to 
light and the analysis gets discredited. The director asks you to redo the analysis and 
report back in another 24 hours. The takeaway: there may be no time available to do 
something right, but there is always time available to do it again.
Or take the case where you are calculating the rolling resistance of a unique buta￾diene rubber compound for a new automobile tire. You are given one week to report 
the results. You already know the calculation will only take three days. Chances are, 
you will complete the analysis in the three days but not report it until the week is up, 
using the extra time to catch up on other work. The upshot: work always expands to 
fill the time allotted.
The paradox of organizational time can unexpectedly create unusual and irratio￾nal behaviors. Take the idea of “face time.” Here, an employee spends perhaps 10 or 
even 12 hours per day at work in a bid to demonstrate to the boss they are a dedicated 
worker. Unfortunately, these workers tend not to accomplish very much during those 
extra hours at work; the goal here is to spend time being seen as present. Investing 
in face time is a common office behavior; in fact, in some cultures this behavior is 
particularly widespread and customary.
The question of deadlines is particularly vexing. Organization members, espe￾cially management, have a firm belief that deadlines are solid and inviolate and 
will judge you negatively for a miss. In general they sincerely believe in this, as a Navigating the Formal Organization 147
deadline is something that can and should be “managed to.” These deadlines come 
from multiple sources:
1) Your management’s management, based on any number of reasons, rational 
or not.
2) A belief that good supervision, in service of the firm, will always push 
people to their maximum, normally expressed as deadlines. The thinking is 
that efficiency means fast, and quick results must mean the group is efficient 
and performing well. The deadline is established as a guess by the boss but 
then rationalized as correct after the deadline is set.
3) As a new employee, the supervisor may wish to test you by purposely giv￾ing you a tough deadline.
4) The deadline is absolutely real and correct, and meaningful consequences 
will happen for a miss.
The lesson here is that not all deadlines are set in stone, but not all deadlines are 
arbitrary. The secret is knowing which is which, and judging when and if you can 
negotiate the deadline if needed. This means understanding the balance between 
work quality, completeness, and correctness vs. time allotted.
Another variable time concept practiced by management is the “shrinking 
time syndrome.” Here, the supervisor unwittingly shrinks the time a previous 
routine assignment took, even tasks that they themselves did as a younger engi￾neer. Say you are asked to conduct a standardized test for lead contamination 
in a municipal water supply. It takes 72 hours to prepare the sample, run the 
test, verify the answer, and report. The supervisor is well versed in conduct￾ing the test, having done it themselves for many years, but that was 8–10 years 
ago. Unfortunately, over that decade, their memory of the test changes until they 
are convinced it only took, say, 48 hours, and that is the due date you receive. 
The test still takes 72 hours; the only thing that shrunk is the bosses’ memory. 
In these types of situations, it is important to bring it to the supervisor’s atten￾tion and correct the due date immediately. Ignoring or “letting it go” will only 
cause the problem to reoccur and become the new standard. Best to correct the 
issue as soon as possible, as a little short-term discomfort prevents longer-term 
frustration.
An interesting situation regards changing or adding goals in the middle of a task 
without time relief. Mission Creep is a term used to describe a request to increase 
the size or number of tasks within the same amount of time originally given. Say 
you are given an assignment and agree to the timing. Then as the task proceeds, 
your boss adds more related assignments to the original task, with timing held to the 
original date (and no additional staff to help). In other words, many added tasks and 
no resource relief.
The rub comes when you have these multiple tasks and a set deadline, all stacked 
up where the chances of doing a good job on all of them become slim. The result is 
some tasks are not completed or some tasks are finished but with poor or unaccept￾able quality.148 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Here, one way to resolve this dilemma is through the Eisenhower matrix. First 
popularized by General (later U.S. president) Dwight D. Eisenhower, the matrix is a 
simple and effective way to shift out competing assignments, to help guide the choice 
of where and when an assignment should be prioritized, thus helping regain control 
of your time. This is shown in Figure 6.2.
The idea is simple. Tasks can be categorized in a two-by-two matrix based on 
urgency (i.e., timing) and importance. These tasks are assessed as one of four com￾binations: urgent/important, not urgent/important, urgent/not important, and not 
urgent/not important. As the figure shows, the first to fourth priorities fall out quite 
easily, with the only caveat being knowing that discarding any not urgent/not impor￾tant assignment will require a conversation with your supervision.
You may have noticed this entire discussion regarding time has a single underly￾ing assumption when applied in an engineering (or any other) large firm or organi￾zation: speed is paramount. Speed to act, speed to decide, speed to market, speed 
to build: time is always short. It becomes obvious that speed of action is valued far 
beyond over attributes. This assumption drives your time and the time of everyone 
around you, and that won’t be changing anytime soon.
6.4 THE LURE OF THE FORMAL ORGANIZATION CHART
On arrival, new engineers like yourself may search for something, anything really, 
to serve as a touchstone or signpost to navigate this strange new world you’ve 
entered. The very first document you will receive (probably within 15 minutes of 
arrival) is a formal organization chart. Relieved to have something in hand that 
tells you anything, you may clutch this paper like a modern-day Rosetta Stone.

Gazing upon it are boxes, ovals, circles, solid lines, dotted lines, arrows, and text 
within boxes with strange initials and codes. In fact, some of these charts may look 
more like the labyrinth in Greek mythology than a chart of your new organiza￾tion. So, the first order of business during this initial meeting: have the supervisor 
decode the organization chart.
After this initial confusion, you may see the formal organization chart as some￾thing safe and certain. Somehow these lines and boxes on a sheet of paper give a 
sense of safety, security, and certainty, especially since it came from the supervisor. 
And at this point, that’s good enough.
But note that a formal organization chart is meant to be a map of reality, a holistic 
guide to department relationships, communication nodes, and power levels defining 
how the enterprise or department should work. As detailed in Chapter 5, it should be 
the result of a careful process incorporating the company’s vision, goals, and objec￾tives. Instead, it usually is the first and only step created in an urgent process; its 
creators seemingly always having a due date of two or three days hence and no time 
to consider any key factors.
But here’s a secret: the organization chart is merely a map of what management 
hopes the organization is, but not what it really is. A formal organization chart con￾tains very little real information. In the grossest sense it represents only two nuggets 
of information, and poorly at that. First, it attempts to definitively explain the formal 
authority lines between members of the organization, and second, provide a hint 
of the relative responsibility between those individuals. For a new employee like 
yourself, it may give an initially warm feeling, but really it acts more as a palliative 
for management than a trusted map. Unfortunately, as time moves on, this first intro￾duction to the chart becomes calcified in the employee’s mind, creating a permanent 
misunderstanding of its usefulness.
The reason for this disappointment is simple. Management needs an uncompli￾cated and clear way to communicate the organization’s makeup or characteristics. 
Yet organizations are much, much more complex and interesting than that. The tra￾ditional organization chart does not indicate true individual power. It does not show 
influence, or funding approval, or talent. It does not show true responsibility, or true 
authority, and may not even show the most current organization. And it certainly 
doesn’t show the informal (i.e., hidden) organization present within every group. 
Frankly, it doesn’t show much. An organization chart only designates the simplest of 
formal reporting relationships, including the number of levels in the hierarchy and 
the managers’ and supervisors’ span of control, and identifies the grouping together 
of individuals into departments, and departments into the total organization. At best, 
the formal organization chart shows only a gross approximation of the group’s reality.
Then why have it? After all, it does not include the systems that ensure effective 
communication, coordination, and integration of effort across departments. However, 
these organization charts are required by four groups: middle and upper manage￾ment (who need a simple map of the larger enterprise), legal (to fend off potential 
lawsuits), finance (to assess lending risk), and external regulatory and quality con￾trol organizations. For example, the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) 9001 certification process for engineering organizations requires organization 150 Navigating the Engineering Organization
charts. So do Wall Street and Main Street. Essentially any outside stakeholder needs 
the firm’s organization chart as part of their normal due diligence.
So, if these charts are extremely simple and of limited usefulness, how can taking 
the organization chart at face value cause trouble? As these charts are only approxi￾mations of the organization, using them exclusively as a tool to operate from will 
at best cause misunderstandings, or, worse, failure in reaching your goals. This can 
happen because:
1) Job titles are mostly incorrect, inaccurate, purposely misleading, or just 
plain wrong, causing misunderstanding as to who is the decision-maker and 
who does what.
2) Responsibility or real power sources do not necessarily correlate to chart 
position.
3) Guidance into essential informal or underground relationships is missing.
4) The chart may be (or probably is) out of date.
Consider organizational titles. Several decades ago, job titles, printed on embossed 
business cards, were something that were coveted, to be distributed as a token of 
influence and power. They certified that the bearer was indeed a member of the 
organization in good standing, someone to be taken seriously and entitled to respect. 
Considered valuable in their own right, these little cardboard totems were some￾times even collected by recipients and kept as a trophy, stored in their own specially 
designed faux-leather case.
Over time, this business etiquette became obsolete as title inflation became the norm. 
Today, a person may email or call a virtual bank to discuss a personal loan and be put in 
contact with an “Executive Director of Consumer Accounts.” Are they truly an executive 
director? No, they are simply the customer service representative at the call center.
The upshot here is to never confuse organization rank with an organizational or 
position title. To find out the true level of an individual, compare indicators of rela￾tive rank. These can include annual salary (if available), span of control, organiza￾tional budget authorization, or financial signatory authority and operational, tactical, 
or strategic-level control of the organization.
Overall, relying strictly on an organization chart for intelligence can be prob￾lematic. For example, say you have been assigned to assess the feasibility of adding 
a new feature to an existing consumer product, in this case a device to predict the 
impending failure of a surge protector within a household emergency power genera￾tor. The assessment must answer:
1) Will the new device work reliably once placed into the existing design?
2) Will any new customers now buy the product once this new feature is 
included?
3) Will the incremental margin increase if the feature is now included?
The first question is yours: the engineer is responsible for determining functionality, 
reliability, resultant quality, and related engineering questions. However, the second Navigating the Formal Organization 151
and third questions are not yours but reside within the Marketing and Business Office 
organizations. You must reach out to these unknown entities, explain the assignment, 
get their agreement to accomplish their portion of the assignment, and then receive 
the results on time and check to see if their assessment is reasonable. In effect, you 
are now being asked not to answer these questions but to manage them.
Your first step is naturally to consult the Marketing and Business Office organiza￾tion charts, pick off the name of the top manager or director of that activity, contact 
them, arrange an in-person or virtual meeting, explain your problem, ask for their 
help, tell them when you need it, and obtain their legitimate commitment to deliver. 
This is fine, if you’ve selected the correct manager or director from the chart.
Unfortunately, this is often not the case. Their title will probably not match their func￾tional assignment. Instead, the person selected may not cover that particular product, or, 
if they do, may be overwhelmed with their own core activities, may think your request as 
unworthy, may have a bad perception of your engineering activity based on prior experi￾ence, or think of the request as a “black hole” that needs to be actively avoided.
A better path to success is to use the chart as a list of names to get you somewhere 
in the neighborhood of the relevant person you need. To get help with the assignment, 
you need to identify and partner with the correct decision-maker, the person with the 
power, authority, and responsibility to help in your quest. This is rarely the manager 
or director, but often a regular-level employee within that activity. Reach out to the 
director’s administrative assistant (if there is one) or a lower-level employee, someone 
who resides in the general vicinity, and start an investigation into who is the correct 
decision-maker, based on reality, not chart position. There may be more than one.
A formal organization implies control, stability, a defined and stable external 
environment, and day-to-day certainty that is static, safe, and secure. It is not. The 
formal organization chart is a paper tiger, promising insight that it cannot deliver. 
Examine it, know that it exists, but keep in mind that it is a very weak tool for under￾standing your new organization.
6.5 DIFFERENT GOALS, DIFFERENT METHODS, 
DIFFERENT STRUCTURES
As stated earlier, when asked to design a new organization structure, engineering 
managers don’t go to their policy deployment training websites. They immedi￾ately grab a paper and pencil and begin to draw boxes and lines. What results will 
undoubtedly be a hieratical or pyramid-shaped drawing that takes about seven min￾utes to complete. You and your co-workers will all be placed in that pyramid. But 
your placement may have little or nothing to do with what you are actually respon￾sible for. The engineering manager will probably be more concerned with getting 
the drawing to come out in a nice symmetrical shape, with a predetermined span of 
control that is not what it should be.
Like organization charts, organizational structures suffer from a disconnect 
between what is perceived and what is reality. Structures should be developed as the 
last step of a careful process. Instead, the structure is usually the first and only step 
in a rushed process.152 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The key understanding is that organization structures should be explicitly designed 
for the type of work the engineering group is expected to produce. An oil refinery 
should have a continuous flow structure; a product development firm should be orga￾nized in a matrix arrangement. Without a structure design consistent with the output 
or product, effectiveness and efficiency both suffer. Most low-level (i.e., operational) 
supervision does not do this. Instead, they default to the traditional hierarchy, or 
perhaps at most a matrix, or may simply copy whatever the previous supervisor did. 
Why? Frankly, designing an organization correctly is labor- and time-intensive, yet 
again results are normally expected immediately.
So, here’s the fallout. At the operational and tactical levels, the assumptions used 
in developing an organizational structure include:
1) The existing group already has the talent capable of performing the work 
assigned. The new structure must employ the same people as before (“rear￾ranging the deck chairs on the Titanic”). No or little additional talent is 
available, or, if so, it is expected to be short-term agency help.
2) The structure must be completed with minimal effort.
3) The manager or director responsible will have no idea if the new structure 
is successful or not until substantial time has passed.
As you examine the typical organization chart upward from the operational to tacti￾cal to strategic levels and horizontally across functional or product areas, contin￾gency theory dictates that each local department’s goals are different, their work 
methods are different, and their external environment is different. Yet their orga￾nization structures are probably the same and thus disconnected from their goals.
Meanwhile, there is an additional twist: the external environment changes at an 
ever-accelerating pace. What in the past was a well-behaved, stable set of environ￾mental factors are now accelerating into a churning caldron over time, and the orga￾nization is usually ill-equipped to change rapidly in response.
So, what does this mean for a new engineer? The formal organization is neither 
static nor stable. It is dynamic over time, though the organization chart is represented 
as stable and authoritative. Current working relationships and networks will have 
limited shelf-life. Assignments, work methods, overall goals, and even bosses will 
change more rapidly than anticipated. Those who expect stability may have a dif￾ficult transition into their new work environment. As long as a new hire expects this 
churn and flexes with the new conditions, these changes can have a less significant 
impact on their work.
6.6 MEET CERBERUS, THE THREE-HEADED BEAST
For those familiar with Greek mythology (or maybe Dante’s Inferno), you will know 
Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades. In the myth, one head 
of the dog represents the past, one the present, and the third the future. Organizations 
have their own Cerberus, luckily not charged as the gatekeeper of Hell, but an inter￾related trio of heads representing the organizational concepts of power, politics, and Navigating the Formal Organization 153
conflict. Each concept has a relationship with the others, and we need to understand 
what they are, how they interact, and, most importantly, how they can affect any new 
employee.
6.6.1 Operating Around Power
We all know what power is. We’ve seen it operate toward both good and bad ends, 
applied by individuals or groups, governments, or commercial companies. It is pres￾ent in any situation where two or more people congregate to achieve a common 
purpose. But power is not a single idea or “thing.” Power is a multidimensional entity 
that can be described in several ways and conditioned by several caveats. There is 
personal power and organizational power. There is power derived from internal or 
external power and combinations thereof.
The classic understanding of power comes from the sociologist Max Weber. 
Weber developed three basic modalities (or types) of power. The first is Bureaucratic 
Power, where obedience is given to a set of “rational” rules (such as a legal system 
in a city or state) rather than to a particular person. An example might be obeying a 
judge’s or police officer’s direction. The next is Traditional Power, which is obedi￾ence given to a particular person based upon societal customs and habits. It’s given 
because it has always been given in the past, such as to royalty or religion. The king 
of England and the Roman Catholic pope are good examples. The third (and one 
of the most interesting) source of power is Charismatic Power, which forms when 
special or unique needs occur that cannot be satisfied by ordinary rules, but only by 
special people with special gifts “of body and mind.”2
For our purposes, we’ll define power somewhat more narrowly than Weber and 
focus strictly on organizational power, a subset of bureaucratic power. Organizational 
power is the ability of one person or department in an organization to influence other 
people or departments to bring about desired outcomes, even when others disagree. 
There are certain characteristics of power in organizations. First, it exists only in a 
relationship with two or more people and is the result of conflict (a direct interfer￾ence with goal achievement) and competition (the rivalry in pursuit of a common 
achievement).3
Power within an organization can exist as two general types: individual power, 
which is created due to certain characteristics of a particular individual, and organi￾zational power, which is derived from a group’s position within a hierarchy.
One of my favorite stories regarding individual power has to do with a manager 
named Ray Jessop. Jessop came to my company’s advanced engineering activity by way 
of an air force career, retiring as a full bird colonel. Ray carried himself with a military 
bearing: a commanding presence, a steady gaze, and always impeccably dressed.
Ray was a strategist. Each action he took during his workday supported one strat￾egy or other. There was always a goal in mind with every word and deed. In fact, 
our joke about Ray was “the brand of cornflakes Ray had for breakfast this morning 
was a strategy.”
Visiting Ray’s office was a textbook example of exhibiting power symbols. 
On entering you could not miss the 11″ × 14″ full-color photo of astronaut Neil 154 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Armstrong walking on the moon. Inscribed on the photo was Armstrong’s signature 
and the inscription “To Ray – Best wishes from your friend Neil Armstrong.”
Sitting in his visitor chair, you couldn’t help but notice an unusual totem. Mounted 
on a small wooden plaque was an odd-looking key. Beneath the key were the words 
“Operation Thunder Sky, 23 June 1974.” Of course, the plaque always draws a com￾ment from every visitor. On being asked, Ray would nonchalantly say,
Oh, that. That’s the launch key from a practice Minuteman II missile launch back in 
‘74. You turn that key at the same time with another key to launch a nuclear strike 
against the bad guys. That’s the key I turned during our launch.
Sitting there, you come to realize that Ray Jessop had the power to launch a nuclear 
ICBM across the Pacific Ocean. You came away with the feeling Ray was telling you 
he was some minor American Prometheus.
Ray’s display of his personal power extended far beyond mere objects. Ray could 
surprise you in public meetings with demonstrations of his power, to your detri￾ment. In one case, Ray was leading an effort to build an advanced aerodynamic 
concept vehicle. He was using an unconventional and, in my view, risky method to 
develop the basic shape, and I mentioned this to one of Ray’s engineers in the hall￾way. Several days later, I was urgently summoned to a meeting, with no indication 
of what it was about, who would be there, or why I was needed. Duly walking into 
the meeting, I found about 25 of his direct reports sitting around a large conference 
table. As I entered, Ray said to me directly: “I understand you have some problem 
with what we’re doing here. Tell us what your problem is.” I was floored. Ray was 
using this meeting to publicly show he would slap down any criticism of his engi￾neering method. I stammered out a few words and left the meeting, bright red. In 
short, this was a trap. The purpose of my summons was to elevate and enhance Ray’s 
power in front of his direct reports.
I learned three nuggets of wisdom that day. First, for any unusual meeting 
invitation or management summons, find out in advance the “what” but also the 
“who and why” of your invitation. Second, realize that some people will use 
you as a tool for their own gain at your expense, especially when you might not 
expect it.
The third nugget is my responsibility. Rather than sharing my complaint with 
a random engineer in Ray’s organization, I should have set up a one-on-one meet￾ing with Ray in his office and voice my concern directly rather than in a hallway. 
Criticism is a private matter, to be expressed privately. Ray was teaching me a lesson 
about operating around power.
Let’s spend a bit more time on power. Power can be exercised both vertically and 
horizontally, meaning power is essentially everywhere in your company and, once 
sensitized, you’ll see it in use continuously.
As the name implies, vertical power sources are dominance factors that individu￾als at the top of an organization use to wield power. Common techniques include 
formal position, resources, control of decision processes, and information control. In 
contrast, horizontal sources of power are how departments obtain power over com￾peting departments. This occurs through methods such as a department possessing Navigating the Formal Organization 155
organizational centrality, the inability to replace a unique, critical department, or the 
ability of cope with uncertainty.4
What about authority? If power is the ability to achieve desired outcomes, then 
authority is a force for achieving these outcomes that are determined by an organi￾zation’s formal hierarchy and reporting relationship. Thus, authority is a subset of 
vertical power more limited than generalized power.
There are several rules regarding authority. Authority is vested in organizational 
positions that are preestablished when you enter the group. Because of that, authority 
has legitimacy and is traditionally accepted by subordinates. Importantly, authority 
only flows down the vertical hierarchy. Thus, power can be exercised upward, down￾ward, and horizontally while authority can only be exercised downward.
It may be surprising, but lower levels of an organization also have power. Obviously, 
upper levels have power, but how would lower levels gather their own power?
Actually, lower levels have many possibilities available which tend to fall into 
two main categories: gaining power for themselves or limiting power available to 
others. A person or department may place themselves at the center of an information 
flow, positioning themselves in a “gatekeeping” role, such as the chief of staff to a 
CEO or an administrative assistant to a chief engineer. Perhaps you may be part of a 
committee reviewing corporate policies or rules. After all, knowing the rules better 
than anyone else is a powerful tool, using them as technicalities against opposition. 
Expertise that is in short supply, such as the ability to code in IO, Racket, or Erlang, 
could potentially command a higher salary or snag more interesting work. Perhaps 
being a technician on an expensive, highly technical, and rare piece of equipment 
would gain you more status and cache.
The second category, power limiting actions, is how employees without power 
can limit those with power. These can include retaliation (a revolt against higher 
powers), regulation (whistleblowers and other appeals to existing rules), apathy (dis￾engagement from the work), or creating an opposing coalition (such as a labor union).
Keep in mind that management has its own sources of power. How managers 
achieve power within their departments is plentiful. They include the ability to 
bestow rewards (i.e., “I can give you a good recommendation”), the ability to exact or 
recommend punishment (i.e., “I can fire you”), legitimate, which is another word for 
authority and derived from formal position (i.e., “I am the boss”), or expert, derived 
from skill or knowledge (i.e., “I am the expert and you are not.”)
Figure 6.3 represents the locations and forms of these various power sources.
6.6.2  Individual Managerial Power
We all have observed powerful people. We may have even met one or two. And you 
may wonder why they are powerful: after all, in a group of people it’s relatively easy 
to pick out the people with personal power. So what is going on?
There are two types of personal power in organizations. The first is power 
derived solely from the person’s position in the organization. This is easy to see. 
This power can be shown by the size of an office (if they exist) in a workplace. 
It’s the amount of budget the person controls or the amount that can be approved 
by that person. Non-organizational personal power is a different animal. This 156 Navigating the Engineering Organization
personal power is not bestowed on the individual because of their organizational 
position; their power comes from attributes outside the organization. An inter￾esting example is what we might call in the United States the “national genius.” 
For many decades now, the U.S. media has tended to assign one of the country’s 
top scientists the unofficial title of national genius. In the 1930s and 1940s it 
was Albert Einstein. In the 1950s it was Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi. 
In the 1960s it was Margaret Mead, and in the 1970s and 1980s it was Richard 
Feynman. The 1990s brought us Stephen Hawking and today Elon Musk fills the 
role. The power of their opinions could move national policies, establish new sci￾entific fields, and generally push scientific and social positions and global finance 
in their preferred direction. The interesting thing is each of these individuals ini￾tially emerged from an organization, mainly universities and startups. However, 
over time their influence extended far beyond their original organizations: they 
became a power center unto themselves.
Speaking of power and its expression, another expression of managerial power 
is totems. Totems are small objects that are symbols of personal or organizational 
power. They are meant to be displayed and must be seen to be effective in conveying 
the power of the individual wearing it.
“Belonging” totems are the most common. A company lapel pin is a common 
totem, as is a laptop case sporting a company logo. A certain color of the company 
badge denoting access to confidential information is highly desired. A windbreaker 
or hoodie with a project team’s name over the left breast (embroidered, of course) is 
another example. Your organization will have specific ones that are meaningful only

in your group. You may see people with certain items on their desks or hanging from 
their cubicle walls. Certificates denoting a training course completed, quality awards, 
thank-you notes signed by top company officials, and other tchotchkes all indicate 
relative power.
It can be enjoyable looking for power totems in your group or department. Some 
are obvious, and no training is needed to understand their meaning.
But other power totems are harder to see. Well-known or prominent individu￾als may require a personal security staff during public events or meetings. One 
U.S. Cabinet Secretary security detail uses a small metal lapel pin with a blue 
letter “R” placed within a white box. Barely visible, this pin is a subtle security 
badge. All members of the staff wear this pin, an indicator that they have been 
cleared to be inside the inner security perimeter. Without that pin, the security 
detail will remove anyone inside the perimeter by whatever means necessary. 
While the actual pin is small, anyone who possesses it certainly feels like they 
are important indeed.
But here is a key point. Many people, including top executives, will mistake orga￾nizational power for personal power, to their detriment. William Broadbank was the 
chief engineer of a major engineering corporation, heading up a global firm employ￾ing some 13,000 engineers and technical staff. Bill was a superstar and he knew it, 
with most of a 35-year career at the top echelons of the company. He was abrupt, 
demanding, and more than a little dictatorial. And the first thought anyone scheduled 
to meet with him was a nervous, “Oh, boy. What will Bill think?”
Unfortunately, Bill had forgotten that his power, his ability to command people 
at any hour of the day or night, was based solely on corporate power, not personal: 
he had conflated the two. And after many years of presumptuous and authoritative 
behavior Bill was asked to leave the company. Within two hours, the joke in the 
halls of the company was, “Bill who?” Where thousands of engineers used to think, 
“What will Bill think?” became, “Who cares what Bill thinks?” The transition from 
powerful to powerless was stunning, instantaneous and complete.
CASE EXAMPLE 6.1 THE RECOVERY OF 
THE APOLLO 8 SPACECRAFT
One of the most interesting examples of demonstrating organizational vs. per￾sonal power came during the preparations for the first trip to the moon by the 
Apollo 8 astronauts in December 1968. As flight director Christopher C. Kraft 
tells in his book Flight: My Life in Mission Control, the pressure was on to 
fulfill President Kennedy’s goal of landing a man on the moon and returning 
him safely to earth by the end of the decade. A critical step was to first fly to 
and then orbit the moon. The only time this flight could be made was over the 
1968 Christmas holiday, and the U.S. Navy needed to provide a large network 
of ships to recover the spacecraft after its flight. Unfortunately, many thou￾sands of sailors had already been given leave to be home for Christmas, and 158 Navigating the Engineering Organization
that was needed to change if the flight was to be successful. It was Kraft’s job 
to convince the admiral in charge of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral John McCain, 
to cancel Christmas leave and deploy the fleet. This required an in-person 
meeting between Kraft and McCain to request the change.
McCain had a deserved reputation for being tough, hard questioning and 
no-nonsense. As Kraft tells the story:
“They took us to amphitheater conference room, nicely paneled and with about 
100 seats. We sat down in front of the damnedest bunch of brass I’ve ever seen, 
all captains and admirals and even a couple of four-star Army and Air Force 
generals filtered in and filled every seat.”
“At 10:30 AM sharp someone yelled ‘Attention!’ and in walks four-star 
Admiral John McCain, commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet, who was a 
couple of inches shorter than me and full to the brim with military bearing. 
Someone said ‘Be seated’ as McCain took his chair right down front and looked 
me in the eye. ‘Okay young man,’ he barked in a loud voice, ‘What do you got 
to say?’”
“McCain’s eyes only left my face to look at my charts and graphs. I don’t 
remember many of my exact words. I simply ran through the mission and told 
him what we wanted to do. I know that I stressed the importance of the flight 
and its risk, and that the greatness of the United States of America was about to 
be tested in space.”
“Then I got to the real point. We had to land the crew in the Pacific. I memo￾rized exactly how I wanted to put it.”
“Admiral, I realize that the Navy has made its Christmas plans and I’m ask￾ing you to change them. I’m here to request the Navy support us and have ships 
out there before we launch and through Christmas. We need you.”
“There was complete silence in the room for maybe five seconds. McCain 
was smoking this big long cigar, and all of a sudden he stood up and threw down 
it on the table.”
“‘Best damn briefing I’ve ever had,’ he said, loud enough for everyone to 
hear. ‘Give this young man anything he wants’. And he walked out.”
“Apollo 8 was go.”5
A really great story, but there is more here than just getting the go-ahead 
to support the mission. Notice what McCain did. Before the meeting was 
ever held, there was no question McCain knew he was going to have to sup￾ply the ships and men to support the Christmas mission. No way was the 
president of the United States going to postpone this historic flight with so 
much national prestige at stake just so some sailors could go on vacation. 
Knowing he had no choice, McCain turned the “decision meeting” into 
active power theater. Instead of a private meeting in his office, McCain 
filled an entire auditorium with 100 or more staff so they could hear that 
the mighty NASA space program needed him. In short, McCain used this 
meeting to reinforce his personal power over his people. A brilliant dem￾onstration of individual power.Navigating the Formal Organization 159
6.6.3  Navigating Conflict
It’s time to look at the second head of our friend Cerberus, the head dealing with conflict. 
In a word, wherever there is power, there is conflict. Conflict is the natural and inevitable 
outcome of the close interaction of people who may have different beliefs, values, objec￾tives, or varying access to information and resources within an organization. Just as with 
power, we are taught that conflict can exist in two forms: organizational conflict (conflict 
between two or more organizations or groups of varying size) and individual conflict 
(conflict between two or more individuals interacting with another).
Conflict can occur due to several reasons. Perhaps different goals, ill-fitting skill 
sets, personalities, or cultures, departments depending on each other, or the struggle 
for limited resources, which can be significant.
Our idea of conflict creates two counterintuitive points. First, no matter how we 
parse the terms “organizational” or “individual” conflict, at its root all conflict stems 
from individuals. Organizational conflict is just conflict between groups of individu￾als driven by a person in charge. Individuals have conflicts in the name of organi￾zations. That means the tools used to resolve individual conflict are the same tools 
that can be applied to the person in charge of a group. The takeaway here is that all 
conflict is, at its core, individual.
Our second counterintuitive point is conflict in organizations is not necessarily bad. 
Conflict challenges the status quo, encourages new ideas and approaches, and can lead 
to positive change. It occurs in all relationships: individual to individual, group to group, 
and group to individual. Of course, we are talking about reasonable conflict: too much 
conflict can be detrimental, requiring a change in approach if unresolved over time.
This idea might be a bit uncomfortable. After all, haven’t we been raised to “play 
nicely with others” and avoid conflict at all costs? Depending on the organization 
you work in, there are various degrees of conflict that are deemed acceptable and 
even encouraged. Manufacturing plants may have a reputation for being high-con￾flict organizations, where “telling it like it is” is not only acceptable but admired. 
Software houses may practice an inclusive, high-respect culture (sometimes dispar￾agingly called “kumbaya”) where polite interaction is valued and conflict is to be 
avoided. No matter how it is expressed, many corporate cultures believe tension and 
conflict are necessary ingredients for any successful organization.
It is inevitable that you will be involved in conflict. Your conflict may be with mem￾bers of a different organization you partner with, or with colleagues in your workgroup 
or perhaps your management. You may have a conventional perspective where conflict 
is bad and should be eliminated, that conflict should not occur in the first place. If so, 
you may wish to consider the pluralistic perspective, where conflict is good and should 
be encouraged and managed with respect. Instead of being passive about conflict, it’s 
important to understand it and develop in advance a process or strategy to work through 
it where no party is injured. Let’s see how this might be done.
Each of us has a personal conflict style, a predetermined approach to perceiving, 
processing, and acting in conflict situations. A good personal goal is to evaluate and 
modify as required a current personal conflict style to drive toward more mutually 
beneficial resolutions.160 Navigating the Engineering Organization

Knowing this, what does this mean for you personally? Since organizational conflict 
still comes down to individual people, in a way conflict is indeed “all about you,” and that 
means you must again understand yourself when it comes to dealing with it.
Seeing a need, Kenneth Thomas and Ralph Kilmann created the Thomas–
Kilmann Conflict Mode Assessment (TKI), a personal evaluation tool that identi￾fies conflict management styles and provides solution techniques. It identifies five 
common conflict management modes, based on two overall conflict modes: asser￾tiveness, the extent to which an individual attempts to satisfy their own concerns, 
and cooperativeness, how much a person attempts to satisfy the opposing person’s 
issues. This produces five conflict management modes: Competing, Collaborating, 
Compromising, Avoiding, and Accommodating, as mapped in Figure 6.4. These are 
situational and time-dependent, and are tendencies, not absolutes.6
At its root, conflict is a form of negotiation. Unfortunately, many new engi￾neers have a fundamental discomfort with negotiation and little experience as well. 
Numerous new graduates (not just engineers) struggle to become more assertive. A 
key benefit of the TKI is to help raise awareness of the reflexive responses to conflict 
that can impede resolution. The insights gained from taking the TKI can be quickly 
used, as it helps to realize your dominant response to conflict situations.
Remember, no single approach to conflict negotiation is best; contingency theory 
applies here. But there are four general lessons:
1) In a conflict, a negotiator is not just stuck with their reflexes. They have a 
choice in resolving the conflict between value claiming (“mine”) and value 
creating (“ours”).Navigating the Formal Organization 161
2) A negotiator needs to know their reflexive response to conflict so they are 
more mindful of the choices they make.
3) Departing from intuitive reflexes requires energy: preparation, planning, 
mindfulness, and conscious effort.
4) Adaptability is needed and desirable. A negotiator might move from one 
TKI “type” to another as a negotiation progresses.7
Since collaboration is widely seen as the best method in resolving conflict, many 
subject matter experts have offered suggestions on improving the chance of success, 
as in Table 6.2.
It’s simple to say that collaboration is the preferred technique in resolving con￾flict as it can produce “win–win” outcomes if applied correctly. How to achieve this 
happy ending involves the thoughtful application of various methods, too many to 
address adequately in this book. There are many good guides available; an online 
search and review is an obvious place to start.
Unfortunately, collaboration will probably not be achieved 100% time, so a nego￾tiator will have to decide which of the remaining paths to pursue. Compromise is 
always a good choice, but as far as the next level, a discussion with your supervision 
is required.8
Now here’s the most important point in conflict resolution a new engineer needs 
to absorb. Never, never, never express anger inappropriately. We’re not talking about 
never showing anger but showing anger inappropriately by shouting, moving, or oth￾erwise acting out in a way that causes fear, insult, or other denigrating actions. One 
instance of becoming unsuitably angry will do more to damage a reputation than any 
mistake in daily work. It is very easy to become known as a hothead, to be seen as 
unreliable or as immature.
We all know this already, yet the temptation to vent or act inappropriately can 
sometimes overcome better judgment. Remember, no one appears powerful when 
angry; they just look uncontrolled and immature.
6.6.4 Politics Lurking around the Corner
Some portion of operating in a technical organization will have to do with politics 
and political tactics. For those starting out, this is a high-risk area. The expression of 
politics and resulting political gain in any organization is so highly contingent that 
hard and fast rules are dangerous and ill-advised. Yet seeing politics as practiced in 
your firm is an important skill, so let’s look at some tactics in action and become 
aware of their use and power. But please note, political activity is like playing with 
live ammunition: no one would recommend to actually use political tactics at this 
point in your professional development.
Politics is the exercise of power and influence when conflict exists. It is expressed 
as self-serving behavior within an organization or achieving a natural organizational 
decision process when conflict is high. Political tactics are used when uncertainty or 
disagreement exists within an organization.9
There are three common areas or domains of political activity. It can be through 
an organization’s structural change, where managers may negotiate to maintain their 162 Navigating the Engineering Organization

personal power bases. It can be the management of group secession, which is bar￾gaining over who gets what positions in the organization or who may be promoted. 
The third is the allocation of resources: money, equipment, and talent, as well as the 
methods of awarding good or bad performance.
There are also political tactics for increasing an individual’s power by making 
themselves more valuable to the organization. They can take high-risk assignments, 
create dependent behaviors, or provide scarce resources. And they can negotiate for 
what they want through building power bases.
One condition of politics at the group level deserves a mention. Say a group’s 
working environment is stable, where goals are consistent, power and control are 
centralized, decisions are orderly and rational, and norms are based on rational mea￾sures. Then conflict is low, and so political activity is low. But when the environment 
is unstable, goals become inconsistent and changing, power and control become 
decentralized with shifting coalitions and interest groups, and disorderly decision 
processes emerge as the result of bargaining among interests rather than rational 
means. Then conflict is high, and political activity becomes common. The upshot is 
to be aware of any increased group conflict over time and prepare for incipient politi￾cal behavior as a result. Knowing in advance how to deal with emerging political 
behavior can provide protection and more certainty in your daily work.
To sum up, let’s return once more to Cerberus. Power, conflict, and politics really 
are a three-headed beast, with each head of the creature separate yet interrelated. 
And as in Dante’s Inferno, this beast can’t be ignored, but it can be managed and 
successfully dealt with a little forethought and savvy. But it’s your job to prepare for 
Cerberus’ arrival.
6.7 LEADERSHIP IS NOT MANAGEMENT
Be forewarned: the argument between what is management versus leadership is 
a decades-old, unresolved, and emotional question, certain to cause red faces

and acid indigestion among anyone trying to definitively compare and contrast 
the two.
Yet it’s important we attempt to clarify these two terms and the difference between 
them. It’s safe to say there are as many definitions of these two concepts as there are 
management consultants for hire on the web. We certainly can’t settle the dispute 
here, nor do we want to. Instead, our goal is to introduce the idea of management as 
opposed to leadership and provide a basis for you to personally decide what it is and 
how to benefit from it.
In practice these two terms have become synonymous, a shorthand version for 
“the boss.” Both are concerned with people, yet leadership and management are two 
distinctly different things, two different concepts. And your interaction with these 
two ideas will vary accordingly.
Like so many topics in engineering organizations, the idea of management vs. 
leadership is highly contingent and rather fuzzy and soft. Rather than spending exces￾sive time struggling with this, let’s just start with a single core idea from Michael 
Maccoby: Management is a function while leadership is a relationship.
10 What this 
means is that the centrality of leadership is ambiguity while the center of manage￾ment is certainty. Leadership is hazy; variation is its central tenant. Management is 
control and measurement; discipline is at its core and variation is the enemy.
Warren Bennis further defines these contrasting terms in Table 6.3.
11
Similarly, management thinker Peter Drucker famously defined organizational 
management as a function that must be exercised in any organization, while lead￾ership is a relationship between “the leader and the led” that can energize an 
organization to action. Drucker defined management as five specific activities: 
planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling. Management is about 
control of people and processes, certainty of the results and “keeping things on 
track.”12
Defining leadership gets a little more slippery. We’ve already said that leadership 
is a relationship. It involves selecting talent, motivating employees, coaching those 
employees, and building trust between the leader and the organization they lead. Navigating the Formal Organization 165
Most employees assume that leadership means the top of the organization, and for 
many reasons this is true. However, recently there is a movement toward “leaders at 
every level.” These proponents contend that leadership is a relationship that can exist 
at whatever level the leader is placed within the organization. Yet a key difference is 
that while it can be a relationship, contingency theory must be satisfied, meaning the 
nature and content of that relationship will vary for each level.
A simple way of slicing this multilevel leader idea is saying there are two types 
of leaders: Strategic (high-level) leaders and operational (low-level) leadership. But 
still, at the core of each leadership example resides the relationship; just the specifics 
of the relationship vary by level.
6.8 STAYING SAFE VS. STEPPING OUT
Formal organizations tend to be safe. In fact, safety is one of the main characteristics 
of the formal organization and provides one of its critical benefits. Here, safe means 
that if you follow the written (and unwritten) rules of the organization, you won’t get 
into major trouble. Ambiguity is low, and policies (i.e., the rules) are clear and gen￾erally well documented. Standard operating procedures are common, and resulting 
employee anxiety is low. And what if you don’t comply with the rules? Well, there’s 
an old proverb: the nail that sticks up gets hammered down.
A policy is a pre-made decision, covering situations that repeatedly occur within 
the organization that do not warrant revisiting. If situation A occurs, then action B is 
the immediate response. The key here is that proper policies are always documented 
in writing and retained in some easy-to-find location. A policy not written down is 
not a policy; it’s an opinion.
Remember that very first meeting with your new supervisor on day one? He or 
she may have covered perhaps two or three basic policies you needed to remember. 
Perhaps it’s the policy regarding not accepting gifts above a certain nominal value 
from a supplier. Or maybe it covers confidentiality restrictions in meetings, or care of 
sensitive information, or allowed expenses during business trips. Alarmingly, there 
are dozens and dozens of written policies you will not know about until you break 
one of them. And unfortunately, there will probably be no central website or database 
showing all these policies in one place, and if there is, no one will know where it is.
Meanwhile, in large, long-established engineering organizations, many rules may 
seem arbitrary and irrelevant to you as a new engineer, reflecting a world from many 
years ago but unsuited to the 21st century. Remember that written rules are policy, 
and policies reflect the organization’s reality at a point in its history, not necessarily 
today. The pace of change in the organization always outruns the rules, replacing 
their relevance with insignificance over time.
This is not a new problem. The author Martin Lindstrom in his book The Ministry 
of Common Sense examines company battles to fight bureaucratic nonsense. Silly 
rules are often caused by new policies being introduced without a “sunset clause” or 
considering unanticipated short- and long-term implications of the rule. Why does 
this happen? One reason is that bureaucracy tends to endlessly multiply without a 
mechanism to retire old, irrelevant rules.13166 Navigating the Engineering Organization
While you may (correctly) believe certain rules are wasted energy or nonsensical, it’s 
important to think of the policies through the bosses’ eyes. In addition to many other 
responsibilities, your supervisor or manager is accountable for policy compliance within 
their group or department. Outside organizations (such as Finance, Human Resources, 
Quality, or Legal) require compliance for their interest area and will attempt to ensure 
it through periodic audits. And it is your management who must certify that your group 
complies by providing hard-to-find evidence. And if the boss must visit a new employee 
and remind them about the missing information, it’s just one more onerous and irritating 
task they must do. Best not to be an irritant and stay safe: perform compliance.
Obviously, formal policies carry a cost in money, energy expended, and time lost. 
The time impact is particularly common. What if you have a core assignment under 
tight timing, and the time required to fulfill some policy requirement will cause the 
assignment to be late? What should you do? Fulfill the policy rule and take the tim￾ing hit, or ignore the policy rule for now and complete the assignment, hoping the 
penalty is not too severe? Here, advance notice is your friend. Simply speak to your 
supervisor immediately after you discover the assignment conflict and await their 
decision. Here, the key is giving the supervisor or manager enough time to investi￾gate the relative importance of each course and render a low-stress decision.
One of the most famous and far-reaching “staying safe vs. stepping out” deci￾sions in recent history is the story of Mr. Ben Sliney, a former U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) National Operations Manager. On the morning of September 
11, 2001, Sliney was starting his first day of a new job overseeing the national U.S. 
airspace, managing some 4,200 aircraft simultaneously flying over the entire country.
About two hours into his first day, two aircraft crashed into the twin towers of the 
World Trade Center in New York and a third into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. 
Chaos grew as other planes were now suspected of being used as terrorist weapons. 
This fear was warranted: one additional hijacked plane crashed into a Pennsylvania 
field later that morning.
According to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United 
States, faced with intense uncertainty, urgency, lack of data, and unknown casual￾ties, Sliney alerted his superiors as to his understanding of the situation, who then 
went into a conference. Sliney then decided he could not wait for his superiors and, 
without approval, ordered over 4,000 aircraft to immediately land, reasoning that 
any aircraft still flying must be under terrorist control.
Sliney did the unprecedented: on his own he gave the order to immediately land 
every aircraft in the air over the United States, shutting down the entire U.S. air￾space. The 9/11 Commission later cited this action as an important and decisive 
moment in that morning’s chaos, and completely justified.14
How could he do this? The background information is important. While Sliney 
made the decision on his own initiative, he had the advice of an experienced staff of 
air traffic controllers and traffic managers within reach. And while it was his first 
day in charge, Sliney had over 25 years’ experience in air traffic management within 
the FAA. He had held positions as an Operations Manager and Traffic Management 
Officer in New York, a Traffic Management Specialist, National Operations Manager, 
Tactical Operations Manager, and Regional Office Manager for the Airspace and Navigating the Formal Organization 167
Procedures Branch for the Eastern Region. He was a hugely knowledgeable indi￾vidual who not only had the experience but also the confidence to assume command 
and decide on the best action to protect the United States. For Sliney, stepping out 
was a relatively low-risk decision.
Let’s look at something much less dramatic. Take the example of Noah, a new 
electrical engineer charged with testing a batch of 15 next-generation touch screens 
for uniform brightness. His reservation in his building’s test facility is at 3:00 pm, 
meaning his screens must arrive there by 2:30 pm for preparation. Being a large 
building, certain job classifications are performed by union-represented workers, 
who work to the contract negotiated by management and their union. One contract 
rule specified that moving large objects (large being defined as requiring two hands 
to carry safely) must only be performed by union workers, called millwrights. Any 
non-union worker caught violating this rule would have a “grievance” filed against 
them, resulting in the millwright who discovered the violation receiving a cash pay￾ment equaling four hours of overtime pay.
At 2:15 pm, Noah and his test articles are in the hallway, waiting for the mill￾wright to arrive and move the articles. At 2:20 pm, Tom (a very experienced engi￾neer) walked by and asks what Noah is doing:
Noah: “I’m waiting for the millwright to move my stuff down to the test lab.”
Tom: “What? Pick it up and carry it down there.”
Noah: “I can’t. I’ll get written up by the millwrights for a two-handed carry.”
Tom: “Jeez, pick it up and carry it. Any engineer who doesn’t have at least four out￾standing grievances isn’t doing their job.”
Now Noah doesn’t want to be late to test, and Tom, an “old hand,” says having a 
grievance is expected and no big deal, but Noah doesn’t what to do something explic￾itly wrong, especially so early in his tenure.
So, what should Noah do? Once again, contingency theory rules. If Noah was in 
good standing, had substantial experience, had a known and positive track record 
over time and perhaps some gray hair, ignoring minor rules may not cause him much 
grief. In this case, the negative of ignoring the policy (or knowingly breaking a rule) 
is often forgiven by prior respect and past successful results.
Unfortunately, a new hire like Noah has none of these positives. As a new engi￾neer he possessed no social capital. The concept of social capital is important to 
all employees, no matter the organization’s size, longevity, or marketplace success. 
Social capital is the potential of individuals to secure benefits and invent solutions to 
problems through membership in social networks. It revolves around three dimen￾sions: interconnected networks of relationships between individuals and groups, lev￾els of trust that characterize these ties, and resources or benefits that are both gained 
and transferred by virtue of these social ties and networks.
So, based on the amount of social capital available, Noah should not take the older 
engineer’s advice. Far better to wait for the millwright and be late (which can normally be 
rectified at the engineer’s level) vs. getting the grievance which will bring the unwanted 
attention of supervision. And, of course, plan extra time for the next test.168 Navigating the Engineering Organization
But here’s another important variation of contingency theory applied to social 
capital: even older engineers with a large cache of social capital can be mistaken. For 
example, say an engineering company (a large, traditional manufacturing firm) has 
a long-standing rule requiring all engineers to be at their workstations each morning 
at 8:00 am. However, as a new employee, you see many colleagues arriving as late as 
9:30 am or as early as 7:00 am, adjusting their quitting time accordingly. Obviously, 
the start time is not an enforced rule. Then you notice an experienced colleague 
(who is a constant 9:30 am arriver) having long-running, work-related conflicts with 
their supervisor. After several months, the colleague is let go. The stated reason for 
the release: the colleague was breaking work policy due to chronic tardiness. The 
unstated reason: the ongoing, unresolved conflict between the colleague and supervi￾sor. The lesson: if you are in good standing, certain minor work rules can be safely 
ignored or modified. However, if your status with management changes for the worse 
due to any reason, those same ignored rules can and will be retroactively applied as 
cause for reprimand or dismissal. Here, breaking rules is the ammunition to create 
delayed, self-inflicted wounds.
What does all this mean? Stockpiling social capital is an investment to attain 
future flexibility in dealing with some rules and situations, a buffer to absorb the 
mistakes of omission and commission we all make.
Stockpiling social capital can include, but is not limited to:
1) Avoiding creating extra work for your supervisor.
2) As much as possible, perform favors or actively help colleagues who need 
it. Be seen as a helpful individual.
3) Building trust that your judgment is sound.
4) Doing the low value-added work with the same enthusiasm as more signifi￾cant assignments.
5) Avoiding squandering your capital on minor situations, reserving your 
social capital for important uses only.
Sometimes, you just can’t stay safe. Take, for example, a former manager of mine, a 
crusty British engineering director named Ken Cookson. Ken was a firm believer in 
the old school of honoring and obeying the hierarchy of engineering organizations. 
He was aggressive, extremely self-confident and his natural inclination was to “shoot 
first and ask questions later.” One day, my manager Jack, an engineer of the more 
modern school, asked me what I would prefer my next job assignment to be. He 
asked me to discuss it with several veteran engineers within our local group, which 
I did. Thinking about it, on my own I also approached another director outside my 
department with equal rank to Ken; in fact, he and Ken shared an office. That direc￾tor was happy to advise me.
The next day, Jack asked for a word, took me into our conference room, and shut 
the door:
“Bob, let me give you a bit of parental advice. When I suggested you ask the engineers 
in our group for their thoughts, that’s all I wanted you to do. That’s my style. Ken is Navigating the Formal Organization 169
old school and will severely criticize both you and especially me for even asking for 
your opinion. I want your thoughts, but in Ken’s eyes your feelings or preferences have 
absolutely nothing to do with his decision. He does not want your views. For him, they 
do not matter. And by the way, he doesn’t want you sharing his internal business with 
outsiders. Please remember this: old school directors can be dictators, and they protect 
their turf. Remember that.”
I learned that when stepping out, I should first anticipate any unintended conse￾quences of my actions. So, think ahead and attempt to look for any surprises when 
crossing a boundary.
Let’s examine one more example of staying safe vs. stepping out. As described 
in Case Example 3.3, during the historic economic recession of 2008–2010, the 
finances of the United States (and the rest of the world) teetered on the edge of 
chaos. No one alive had seen this situation before, at least since the Great Depression 
of 1930–1933. The rules no longer applied. Barack Obama had just been elected 
the U.S. president and had to address this problem swiftly and effectively. Decisive 
action was called for.
Instead of staying safe at this historic, high-risk moment, the administration 
stepped out in an unprecedented manner, fundamentally changing American (and 
global) economic policy while simultaneously establishing a new national health￾care system. In describing these actions, Obama’s Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel 
famously said: “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” What he meant was large crises 
called for (in fact demanded) large responses unconstrained by the status quo. It 
means when in uncharted waters: the standard rules are gone, normal performance 
standards become irrelevant and management may not know what to do. These major 
events are an outstanding opportunity to step out as opposed to remaining safe.
6.8.1  An Imperative
Of course, there are many examples where stepping out is not only acceptable but 
imperative.
Surprisingly, certain cultures allow and even condone mental and other abuse to 
occur from supervisor to employee. According to recent reporting, this workplace 
bullying shows itself through verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse cases in dif￾ferent businesses and social strata. This abuse is common enough that it has a special 
term in some countries: pawahara, or power harassment. In Japan, worker objections 
to this behavior reached some 82,000 complaints in 2018, leading the government to 
pass two anti-harassment legislation bills. Japanese firms are now required to have 
clear policies and internal systems for reporting and verifying abuse.15
This is also happening in South Korea. South Korea’s business culture can be 
notoriously punishing. Workers in South Korea work some of the longest hours in 
first-world economies, where they have little control over their time and a small 
chance to escape from harassment. There is also a special word in South Korea 
for this authoritarian attitude: gapjil. Gapjil includes shouting at underlings, requir￾ing unpaid all-nighters, and requiring some employees to handle their managers’ 170 Navigating the Engineering Organization
personal errands. Even at new South Korean startups based on America’s Silicon 
Valley meritocracy model, some bosses are still tending toward this behavior.16
Obviously, through the Western lens, this type of behavior is unacceptable, and in 
many of the locations mentioned safeguards are now in place to provide a pathway to 
protection. In these companies, reporting abuse is imperative and relatively low risk. 
Firms in countries without these protections are a different story.
6.9 STANDARDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY STANDARD
As part of their training in engineering design, new engineers will be told explicitly 
that their work must follow “the requirements.” And for good reason. Engineering 
requirements are the result of many years of sometimes bitter experience in practic￾ing engineering correctly.
In this book, engineering requirements are defined as a collection of standards, 
codes, and specifications that new and existing designs must meet. All three are 
extremely important, often essential, in engineering and related technical fields.
A technical standard is an established norm or requirement. There is usually a 
formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, meth￾ods, processes, and practices for a given job. These documents, prepared by a pro￾fessional group or committee, specify proper engineering practices and contain 
mandatory requirements.
A code is a set of rules, specifications, or systematic procedures for design, fab￾rication, installation, and inspection, prepared in such a manner that can be adopted 
by legal jurisdictions. Codes are generally approved by local, state, or federal gov￾ernments and can carry the force of law. The main purpose of codes is to protect the 
public by setting up the minimum acceptable levels of safety for buildings, products, 
and processes.17
Specifications are quantitative, measurable criteria that a product is designed to 
satisfy. To be measurable and unambiguous, specifications must contain a metric, 
a target value, and defined engineering units for the target value. A metric is the 
characteristic of the product that will be measured. A target value is the acceptable 
range of the metric, such as “less than 6 seconds” or “between 20 and 50 pounds.” 
An engineering unit is an amount of a physical quantity defined and adopted by con￾vention or law that is used as a standard for measurement, such as minutes, degrees 
Celsius, and kilograms.18
All these requirements define a level of compulsory engineering performance. 
It’s simple: your design or project must meet its requirements or the work doesn’t 
proceed.
It’s easy to love requirements. Clean, clear, definitive, and inarguable, they are 
the bedrock that any engineering design or project rests on. But occasionally that 
bedrock is not as solid as you might think.
Requirements are the result of hard-won experience derived from engineering 
projects in the past. They are the equivalent of saying, “we shouldn’t do that again; 
somebody write that down.” Requirements capture the judgments of engineering 
experts that set the boundary of a discipline’s state of the art at that moment. Some Navigating the Formal Organization 171
requirements (like codes), once established, may remain in effect for decades: their 
strong tie to the force of law makes them very externally focused and stable. For 
example, civil engineering projects are highly invested in codes.
Consumer products are a different matter. External codes for these products can 
be minimal. A child’s toy may have only a few governmental code requirements: no 
small parts a child can swallow, use nonflammable materials, and prevent electrical 
shock. Yet the toy’s specifications may actually require a higher level of performance 
than the applicable external codes. This is normally driven by both consumer com￾petitive pressures and conservative legal positions: the toy’s part size may be double 
the governmental safety requirement, the fireproof materials may be much better 
quality than the competition, and higher-cost waterproof materials be installed on 
all electrical connectors. The goal is to avoid legal challenges while providing a 
competitive advantage.
But here’s the flip side of the coin. Internal company requirements are estab￾lished in response to lessons learned on past engineering projects. Many times, these 
requirements must be satisfied on all subsequent projects via formally signed written 
documentation. Yet these lessons tend to be contingent on the past project’s time and 
place: the specific conditions causing the issue. And due to the quickly changing 
external environment, these once-viable requirements quickly become irrelevant and 
obsolete. Yet the requirement remains.
Take the design of a new two-door, all-electric sports car. For a traditional gas 
engine coupe, the desired high acceleration and top speed require maximum engine 
cooling performance, and the company’s decades-old cooling requirement is for the 
car’s front-end grill opening to be at least 35% of the vehicle’s total frontal area. But 
all-electric vehicles don’t need traditional cooling: there is no grill on the car at all. 
What to do?
The answer is the deviation. A deviation is a formal document, signed by all top 
engineering management, that allows the current project to deviate from the stan￾dard in a specified manner. It documents under what conditions a project will not 
meet company standards, and why.
Yet the deviation is not actually a solution. The problem is twofold. First, obsolete 
standards are rarely retired: they stay in full force well into the future. The second is 
that upper-level engineering management is loath to sign deviations. No one wants to 
sign a document certifying their new product is “not up to standards,” no matter how 
irrelevant that standard is. What results is a new project needing dozens of obsolete 
deviations signed off before the first prototype is built, signed by management that 
doesn’t want to do it.
Why not retire the obsolete rules? It makes sense, except rarely is there a single 
responsible group charged with performing this task, plus the unproven fear of a 
current condition somewhere that the obsolete deviation still covers. The result is to 
shy away from the situation and let the next director address the problem. Best to just 
sign the deviation and get on with the job.
What this means is this: You will undoubtedly be working with standards, codes, 
and specifications quite early on. You need to know what requirements are legitimate 
and which are not; what are governmental and which are company-based. Which are 172 Navigating the Engineering Organization
obsolete and which are fully in force. Once you fully understand these requirements 
early on, you can proceed with minimum rework, which results in higher efficiency, 
certainty, and confidence.
6.10 REALIZATIONS
So, what does all this tell us? On the surface, the formal organization appears stable 
and certain, guided by written policies, bounded by management rules that are accu￾rate, fair, and provide clear-cut expectations so you will know where you stand at 
all times. In certain stable environments this can be true. However, the rest of us 
operate under different conditions. We’ve learned that management’s worldview may 
not match yours; that deadlines and timing are variable. We know that organization 
structures vary across the enterprise; that their charts tell us surprisingly little, and 
insignificant guidance exists on when you should step forward or hold back. We 
know that management is not leadership, that power, conflict, and politics are inter￾related, and that standards are less certain that expected.
We’ve discussed some causes of these realities and hopefully offered some insights 
and suggestions on how to respond. The best response is to adopt an “observe and 
listen” approach. Be that engineering archeologist we’ve discussed earlier. Then 
assemble the pieces you’ve observed to create a rough mental map of the formal 
organization and adjust your work product to suit.
Just remember that the formal organization is a frame of mind; it is the hope of 
management. Be aware that management’s hope is not necessarily what the formal 
organization really is.
That said, our next stop is in the area of resources, in the form of both human tal￾ent and hard objects. A different set of operating principles apply here. With this in 
mind, let’s examine how to operate with the resources available to you.

7 Understanding Human 
and Hard Resources
7.1 COMPREHENDING RESOURCES
Getting a handle on both human and hard resources is a bigger challenge than you 
might think. As outlined in Chapter 5, human and hard resources are two separate, 
but related, commodities, each of high value (I’m sorry, but in large commercial 
organizations humans are sometimes seen as commodities). As both resources are 
firmly entrenched within the Inner Core, as shown in Figure 7.1, it’s worthwhile to 
spend some time dealing with the concepts behind these types of resources. Let’s 
talk about human resources first, as this is definitely the more complex portion of 
the discussion.
7.2 HUMAN RESOURCES
Human resources is defined as the personnel of a business or organization. They are 
the talent and skill that an engineer brings to the organization to assist in fulfilling 
the firm’s goals.
Just as with the subject of management, Google can provide you the names of 
thousands of volumes dealing with organizational human resources. In fact, one of 
the largest professional associations in the United States is the Society for Human 
Resource Management (SHRM). With over 300,000 members, SHRM exists to 
improve the professional practice of human resource management. There is no way I 
can (or will) address the breadth and depth of the various human resources systems 
in existence, but I do want to touch on a number of topics that directly affect new 
engineers. (Note: in this book the phrase “human resources” in lowercase denotes an 
actual person as a resource. Human Resources capitalized or written “HR” refers to 
the organizational department that administers the company’s talent.)
7.2.1  The Mystery of the HR Office
For those new employees in larger engineering organizations, a trip to the HR office 
is a mysterious journey. What goes on in there? Who lives in those offices? What do 
they do, and does it mean bad things for me? Probably not, but I don’t know any new 
engineer who doesn’t view a trip down the hallway to HR without a bit of low-grade 
anxiety.
The purpose of the Human Resources department is twofold. The first is to 
administer the written HR policies of the organizations fairly, quickly and without 
further problem. The second is much more creative. These HR people are there to 
Navigating the Engineering Organization Understanding Human and Hard Resources
DOI: 10.1201/9781003214397-10
10.1201/9781003214397-10176 Navigating the Engineering Organization
solve unique, one-of-a-kind problems related to personnel issues. As a result, larger 
organizations have two types of HR employees.
One is the individual whose job is to strictly enforce those written policies and 
impose compliance. Tracking performance against required organizational metrics, 
processing paperwork, and handling 95% of personnel issues that are routine is their 
job. These employees can identify unique personnel issues, but their role is to refer 
these one-off problems to HR management, not necessarily solve them. These issues 
go to the HR managers as their role is to apply experience, creativity, or modify 
existing policies to solve the problem.
An example of this occurred to Mary McAllister, a relatively new engineer eager 
to continue her learning through her company’s continuing education program. This 
program, in place for many years, pays for advanced degrees for qualified engineers 
while they are employed: most firms have programs of this type and are based on 
part-time, evening classes.
Mary applied to this program and was approved. As the average time it takes 
to complete the degree is about three years, Mary knew she was committed to that 
timeframe and planned accordingly. Unfortunately, halfway through the program 
her firm suffered a revenue downturn and quick action was needed to reverse the 
losses. One of their first actions was immediately stopping the continuing education 
program, with no reinstatement date. Mary, now halfway through, was told that her

education would no longer be paid by the company. Mary felt this was reneging on 
the explicit and implicit social contract between her and the company. She made 
an appointment with the Human Relations department and spoke with a low-level 
employee. This employee told Mary this was the new policy and she was finan￾cially liable for the rest of her degree: the company would no longer pay. Luckily, an 
experienced co-worker told Mary to make an appointment with the HR director and 
explain the problem to them. Mary did so, and the director agreed that the company 
had made a commitment to her: she should be “grandfathered” in and have her entire 
degree paid for as promised. As this was a policy exception, the director took the 
issue to the vice president, who agreed and personally approved Mary’s program 
for the remainder of her studies. This is a perfect example of how a lower-level 
HR employee will only enforce written policy, while an upper-level HR manager 
will solve more judgment-based problems. Dealing with the ranking HR employee 
directly solved the problem: Mary could keep attending class, the company’s prom￾ise to pay was kept, and Mary strengthened her positive attitude toward her firm. 
Without the HR director’s decision to keep the commitment, Mary’s attitude would 
certainly have deteriorated.
Dealing with HR is an extremely contingent activity. Outcomes can be quite 
good, such as Mary’s experience, or perhaps frustrating if no true resolution of a 
concern occurs. Because of the wide variation in HR department policies, rules, and 
procedures, dealing with HR requires a modicum of savvy. Luckily, there is a very 
simple, common-sense approach to help solve problems related to personnel issues:
1) Become educated. First research the HR-related policy documents and 
other information available related to your concern. While you won’t know 
everything, you should be on reasonably solid ground relative to whatever 
the written policy and process specifies.
2) If practical, solve interpersonal issues directly with the person or persons 
involved. If the issue elevates, the first question you will be asked is: “Have 
you spoken to the other person yet?”
3) If unresolved after an initial outreach, approach your local supervision for 
assistance. Part of their responsibility is to solve concerns such as these.
4) If still unsatisfactory, be sure to follow all written process steps the firm 
specifies before making your next move. Whether to approach your man￾ager or other person or group, be sure to follow each process step com￾pletely and to the best of your ability. Compliance to the policy and its 
process must be demonstrated throughout.
5) When in compliance, go to the HR office. Notice that visiting HR is the 
fifth step in your checklist, not the first. Once HR is involved, your issue 
becomes “official”; documented and highly visible. HR is required to 
address it through their own system, meaning you now lose control of the 
outcome. While necessary, HR will view resolution in the company’s best 
interest, whatever that is.
In short: be deliberate, be educated, and know the territory in advance.178 Navigating the Engineering Organization
7.2.2 What Human Resources Does (and Doesn’t) Do for You
There is general agreement that there are six basic functions of a Human Resources 
department:
1) Recruitment and Selection: using different selection instruments in a reduc￾tion process to identify and decide upon the best candidate for a given com￾pany position.
2) Performance Management: a set of processes and systems aimed at 
evaluating an employee so they perform their role to the best of their 
ability.
3) Learning and Development: a systematic process to enhance an employee’s 
skills, knowledge, and competency, resulting in better work over time.
4) Succession Planning: the process of planning for various contingencies if 
and when critical employees leave the company.
5) Compensation and Benefits: the monetary and nonmonetary payments a 
firm provides to its employees in exchange for their labor.
6) Information Systems and Data Analytics: a digital system used to collect, 
store, manage, and mine data on an organization’s employees.
For an engineer now employed, the three relevant HR areas impacting them are per￾formance management, learning and skills development, and compensation and ben￾efits. Succession planning is strictly a role for management, while human resources 
information systems and data analytics are back-office functions of the HR depart￾ment supporting management reporting and analysis.1
Underlying these three HR areas is an unstated goal. The HR department oper￾ates with the relentless goal of moving the routine functions of administration to 
“expert” digital systems, making these three functions a self-service operation. 
Remember that HR is viewed strictly as a cost center, and these costs must be con￾tinuously reduced.
This means that certain functions traditionally performed by HR are being moved 
to the employee’s desk. Routine, periodic data collection and reporting is now in the 
employee’s hands vs. HR. A major movement has been to push career advising and 
planning completely onto the worker’s shoulders: don’t look for career advice in the 
HR office. As career planning is 100% the employee’s responsibility, this means new 
hires must find their own support system if advancement is the goal.
7.2.3  Your Objective Set
In Chapter 5, we defined Policy Deployment as the cascading down of goals and 
objectives to ever-lower organizational units. The natural extension of this system 
down to an individual engineer’s level is the personal objective set. This set is the 
collection of tasks, normally negotiated and agreed on with your immediate supervi￾sion, that you will accomplish by a specified time and at the correct quality level.Understanding Human and Hard Resources 179
There is no doubt you want to do the best job possible. Believe me, your man￾agement wants the same thing. But what does this really mean, and how is it 
accomplished? While there is not one best way to tackle this (remember our friend 
contingency theory), a good bet is through your objective set.
We now come to the point of setting your own personal objectives. Most compa￾nies use objective setting methods based on the SMART technique, a little kitschy 
memory device that allows you and your supervisor to create, track, and complete 
both your short-term and longer-term goals.
Objective setting can be complicated and onerous; the SMART method simpli￾fies it. SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Timely. Each letter of the acronym reinforces the goal to create an objective set that 
is clear, intentional, and can be tracked.
You may have set goals in your past that were difficult to achieve because they 
were too vague, aggressive, or poorly framed. Working toward a poorly crafted goal 
can feel daunting and unachievable, and creating SMART goals can help solve this 
problem. Let’s consider each portion of the method:
S: Specific
Specific is an explicit statement of what is desired. It means being as clear and exact￾ing as possible with what you want to achieve. The more narrow the goal and more 
clear the boundary surrounding it, the more you’ll understand the steps necessary 
to achieve it.
M: Measurable
Measurable is metric-based evidence to prove you’re making progress toward your 
goal. This usually means setting up measured milestones to track progress over time 
toward the end goal.
A: Achievable
Is the goal you wish to attain achievable? Reasonable goals provide structure and 
appropriate feasibility going forward. Before setting a particular goal, decide if it’s 
achievable now or if additional preliminary steps are needed.
R: Relevant
When setting goals, determine if they are relevant. As with policy deployment, your 
goals should align with the organization’s longer-term objectives and strategy. Avoid 
goals that don’t contribute toward these broader objectives.
T: Time-based
The date you intend to complete your objective. A hard end-date helps provide moti￾vation and prioritization. When setting a certain goal, you also set an estimated 
completion date. If the goal hasn’t been achieved in that timeframe, it might have 
been unrealistic or just have been unachievable.2
Table 7.1 summarizes each of the SMART categories.180 Navigating the Engineering Organization
7.2.4  So What Does Your Supervisor Think?
A fundamental assumption in this book is that you wish for a successful first pro￾fessional work experience. That you desire to demonstrate talent, intelligence, and 
technical savvy within your new engineering organization; to establish a good (or 
even great) reputation. All this is admirable, but also begs an age-old question: 
How do you know if you are doing a good job? That you are well regarded within 
your organization? Most importantly, how does your supervisor judge you so early 
in your tenure?
Difficult questions, and there are not simple, clean answers. But there does exist a 
basic approach to employee performance assessment that (to some extent) is univer￾sal in engineering organizations, and you need to understand how it operates.

Fundamentally, management judges you as an employee not with a single tool or 
method, but using several approaches, designed to “triangulate in” on a performance 
rating and thus your value to the group. These approaches can be divided into two 
types: objective methods and subjective methods.
Objective methods are formal performance measurement systems or tools fea￾turing numerical inputs, tightly defined terms and reassuring algorithms to try 
to ensure a fair comparative rating. These are the performance ratings systems 
your company will describe in their employee manuals and orientation sessions. 
Objective methods are generally well designed, widely used, and low risk, having 
been court-tested over time.
Subjective methods tend to be more covert in nature, used by managers and super￾visors as their personally preferred evaluation methods they have found to be useful 
over time. The reason for the widespread use of these covert methods is simple. A 
core role of management is making meaningful decisions and judgments, a role that 
bosses are not keen to give up. While the HR department provides a safe evaluation 
method, management still wants to make their own assessments and preserve their 
own decision-making authority. Let’s touch on an example of both objective and 
subjective systems and see how they might work.
Let’s talk first about a typical overt, objective performance measurement system. 
Obviously, performance is the “getting it done” phase of the job and is the reason 
for your existence within the firm. Your performance is what your management is 
interested in. Now, contingency theory dictates how your performance is measured 
and assessed. It depends upon the type of assignment you have, the characteristics 
of that assignment, its criticality, the company’s culture, and a host of other factors.
These objective performance systems normally consist of two parts. The first is an 
assessment of actual accomplishment; how well were your assigned tasks performed. 
The second addresses what the corporation or company believes is acceptable behav￾ior and attitude, and how your behavior measures up against these standards. These 
two factors can be represented by a two-by-two graphic as shown in Figure 7.2. Both 
horizontal and vertical axes have precise definitions attached to them, attempting 
to minimize confusion on what constitutes good or bad performance and accept￾able or unacceptable behavior. This system means an engineer can have excellent 
performance but be perceived as having poor behavior. Alternatively, you can have 
very poor performance but be perceived as having excellent intra-group skills and 
overall “fit.”
Normally, performance is captured by a simple process of clearly stating the indi￾vidual objective, a response statement on what was accomplished relative to that 
objective, and finally a judgment whether the accomplishment met, did not meet, or 
exceeded that objective. Many times this judgment is then converted into a numeri￾cal score.
The behavioral axis means you want to ensure you fit into your local organiza￾tion. Many organizations specifically define what those behaviors look like. Trying 
to codify something as Jell-O-like as behavior is not trivial; it requires a fair amount 
of verbiage to pin it down. Figure 7.2 shares a sample assessment for a Fortune 500 
firm, both performance and behavior within four major categories.182 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Note the goal is for you to move your assessment continuously up and to the right. 
This indicates improvement over time, which is what your supervision is looking for.
A person’s location on the graphic is the result of a preloaded algorithm with 
numerical data input by the manager or supervisor, and the goal is to move the 
assessment up and to the right. Very neat and tidy.
The result of this objective analysis is then compared to other engineers in a 
cohort of similarly grouped employees, perhaps based on job role, level in the com￾pany, their home department, experience, or any other of the dozens of ways man￾agement can group individuals. From there, a relative (or “forced”) ranking can be 
constructed, with engineers falling into “clusters” with other similarly rated employ￾ees, with pay and other benefits distributed on a sliding scale. Clean, but a somewhat 
mechanical way to judge someone’s worth.
This system requires good communication and clear ground rules between the 
employee and management to avoid needless conflict. The first ground rule is to 
ensure you understand how accomplishment is measured and that understanding is 
consistent between yourself and your management. This means knowing the compa￾ny’s official definitions of performance and behavior. The second ground rule speci￾fies that performance discussions should not be a once-a-year event, but a continuous 
and ongoing informal, verbal occurrence so you always know where you stand. This 
ensures performance reviews are not surprises but are consistent with what you’ve 
been hearing all year long. A third ground rule is to be sure to ask for ongoing feed￾back, as most supervisors and managers will not give it unless asked. Requesting 
continuous feedback is a small investment in effort that will pay big dividends at

your yearly review. No matter the method, the fundamental point here is to commu￾nicate repeatedly and well with your management.
An important insight about objective performance systems is their strong link and 
dependency on the organization’s corporate culture. Several years ago, a Fortune 25 
multinational attempted to move its existing performance system to the then-popular 
(and somewhat infamous) General Electric “A/B/C” ratings system. This system, relent￾lessly performance-based, forced supervisors to rank employees into three categories 
of achievement: “A” for the top 10% of workers, “B” for the next 80%, and “C” for the 
remaining bottom 10% of employees. This 10–80–10 split was compulsory; all employ￾ees were required to be ranked. The rub came with the “C” employees. They were given 
one year to improve to at least a “B” level; if not, they were released. Of course, if one 
employee is elevated to a “B,” then another employee is demoted to a “C.” This Darwinian 
rating system apparently worked within General Electric’s hard-nosed corporate culture. 
After moving to the General Electric system, that same Fortune 25 multinational, being a 
family-owned company, found this approach unacceptable to their culture and scrapped 
the system in less than two years, a remarkable move. The General Electric system was 
a substantial failure for that company: it did not fit the culture.
To do these objective methods well requires the supervisor to have a very good 
knowledge of the individual, complete notes of positive and negative work examples, 
and careful wording of the official document, least the employee dispute the rank￾ing. This takes time and effort, meaning it is commonly done only once a year. But 
management needs a useful yet informal system of rating their people, developing 
them, and ultimately deploying them to best advantage.
Fortunately, there is a model that does this, and it’s useful to understand it. 
Developed by Ken Blanchard and D. Johnson et al., and called the Situational 
Management Model, this concept allows supervisory-level management to infor￾mally assess your worth to the group by evaluating confidence in the technical qual￾ity and correctness of your work and comfort with you as a growing professional and 
with your fit within the group.3
Here’s how it works. Supervision tends to bin their employees into one of four cat￾egories, based on the combination of an engineer’s willingness to perform required 
technical tasks and their ability to actually accomplish the work. As shown in Table 
7.2 and Figure 7.3, this combination results in four evaluation classifications that are 
easy to evaluate:
The Situational Management Model is simple, widely applicable, and easy to 
remember. In short, it works.
We’ve mentioned the rule of seeing what needs to be done and just doing it. It’s 
time to expand that rule a little bit. Early on, you will be assigned jobs and assign￾ments that cleanly fit into your published role. But it’s important to demonstrate a 
willingness to comfortably volunteer to help with assignments outside your assigned 
role. And this means meaningful tasks, not planning the company picnic.
Department-level operations are not all the time well planned out. Many assign￾ments come in like meteors: they are identified only at the last moment before their 
impact causes a lot of damage. If your colleagues are not ready for them, they will 
be scrambling. And in crisis situations, there will always be some assignments that 184 Navigating the Engineering Organization

perceives a poor 
fit between the 
new engineer and 
their department. 
This situation 
would be 
equivalent to a 
military draftee: 
they don’t want to 
be there and are 
not willing to 
invest in the job.
This is where 
almost all new 
employees will 
start. 
Enthusiasm 
toward the job 
and its tasks is 
evident, but they 
do not yet have 
the technical 
skills to 
meaningfully 
contribute. This 
is the classic 
new employee 
starting point.
This is an 
interesting case. 
Here, the engineer 
is perfectly able to 
do the task 
assigned; they just 
don’t want to do 
it. This is the 
archetype of the 
burned-out 
employee. 
Normally 
longer-term, 
experienced 
employees, they 
are no longer 
interested in 
performing the 
job, even though 
they may still be 
very good at it. 
Boredom, lack of 
other 
opportunities or 
unpleasant past 
experiences can 
drive an engineer 
into this zone.
The golden 
engineer. This is 
a high￾performing 
employee who 
demonstrates 
both excellent 
technical skills

performance and 
high level of 
enthusiasm and 
social “fit” 
inside the local 
group. These 
engineers can 
almost supervise 
themselves and 
are in high 
demand both 
inside and 
outside the 
organization.

take it on, and do it fast. That’s where you come in. Be sure to get to the person in 
charge and volunteer to help with anything. And I mean anything. If it means cre￾ating some simple slides, do it. If it means collecting telephone numbers or email

7.2.5  Notes on Career Development
Just a very few comments on career development.
Armies of career development specialists lurk out there, each with a promise to 
the reader to speed their promotions, compete for plum jobs, and generally ensure 
their success and happiness. We’re not going to get into that. Instead, here are just a 
few thoughts on career development and continuing education.
Your development as a professional will be expected. Company training classes 
and continuing education degree programs are a prime tool to get this done. But be 
aware you must personally take the lead for your own development. Your manage￾ment is not going to invite you to enhance your toolbox or formal education: they 
are too busy (and probably too stressed) to taking a deep personal interest in your 
development. Instead, they will expect you to take charge of your professional future. 
Since most professional development actions are normally approved by the company, 
you should have little problem getting the approval of your management, especially 
if these actions are taken on your personal time. This means evening classes, semi￾nars, and other opportunities.
Development also includes fixed-duration job rotation opportunities, taken at a 
relatively decent frequency. Some companies have formal rotation programs. This 
may be worthwhile but normally are not strictly required.
HR departments frequently have preapproved paths for new engineer’s develop￾ment. These plans, while having the flavor of a template, can help identify the com￾pany’s preferred content for a new person’s development. The important thing is to 
not be chained to the template’s timing specification, but in the content it provides.
Finally, remember that in general, the HR department does not have the time 
or manpower to create custom programs for each individual engineer. That is your 
responsibility.
7.2.6 Rewards and Recognition
Ah, yes, the topic of rewards and recognition. Just how will you be recognized and 
rewarded for a job well done? How do you wish to be recognized? What do you 
want? A public recognition for an achievement? Or perhaps a boost to your pay￾check, your ego, or both?
A reward is a resource of value given to you is a result of a good or great job 
performance. Recognition is different, a (normally) public statement of achievement 
bestowed on you in front of others. A recognition is an honor; a reward is more con￾crete. A reward can be given as part of a recognition. Unfortunately, many times (or 
perhaps even in a majority of instances) rewards and recognitions are misapplied, as 
they are generally not well understood by management.
All engineering companies will say that recognition and reward is a necessary 
and important part of their human resources toolbox and is a legitimate and sincere 
expression of achievement. Yet how this expression is articulated is contingent. For 
large firms, reward programs are normally outsourced to companies that special￾ize in administering these programs on behalf of the organization. Because your Understanding Human and Hard Resources 189
management may not necessarily see reward and recognition as a core part of a 
firm’s engineering activity, recognition is offloaded to someone else and made as 
fast and efficient (i.e., cheap) as possible. A typical example is the popular “cata￾log rewards program” used by hundreds of large companies in North America and 
elsewhere.
Say you did an outstanding job on an urgent, high-profile assignment and your 
supervisor wishes to reward you for your performance. With these catalog programs, 
your supervisor accesses a website, types in your name and employee number, selects 
an amount, and presses return, an investment of approximately 53 seconds. Within 
a week, a pro forma email arrives informing you of your honor, with the facsimile 
signature of the vice president of Human Resources attached. In the email is a code 
number with an amount. You are instructed to visit a certain website, select a gift of 
some type, and then use the code to order the gift which comes in the mail. Enclosed 
with the gift is an auto pen signature from the CEO, assuring you that the company’s 
success is a direct result of your contribution. Obviously, this system is not true 
reward and recognition. This is a low-cost way of keeping management from spend￾ing time on true admiration and celebration.
Meaningful recognition is (like most things) contingent on both the person 
receiving the recognition and the achievement being highlighted. Types of rewards 
are many and very diverse. They can range from money (increased wages, one-time 
bonuses, or profit-sharing), enhanced career attainment, promotion, better ameni￾ties (perhaps a more capable computer or other digital device), additional vacation, 
recognition through praise or awards valued by the employee or intrinsically mean￾ingful work assignments. Untold other forms of recognition exist. The key is the rec￾ognition should be both motivating and enriching to the recipient, not the company.
Tom Siligato was a supervisor of engineering during the design and development 
of a new luxury vehicle program. Tom’s most valuable engineer was Rob Mierle, 
and together were performing feasibility on the interior and exterior of this vehicle 
(feasibility being the analysis of all appearance parts so they can be manufactured 
and assembled with quality). Their overall boss was Terry Carlson, director of proj￾ect management who ran the entire program. Carlson was demanding and looked 
to Tom and Rob for fast analysis and high-quality results over an extended period 
of time. Carlson placed tremendous pressure on them to accelerate their feasibility 
timing even faster than the schedule, as he wanted to polish his own reputation as 
an overachieving, “get it done” director. So even though they were on schedule, they 
were (in Carlson’s eyes) late.
Tom had booked his annual vacation in the middle of this intense period. Tom 
assigned Rob to act in his behalf for the two weeks of Tom’s absence. Unfortunately, 
a critical review and approval event was scheduled to take place while Tom was 
away. In this review of about 60 people, Rob was representing Tom and their group. 
When it came time to review and approve their feasibility work, Rob reported the 
truth: while they were on time against the baseline schedule, they were not on time 
or ready to be approved for the accelerated schedule.
What happened next became a “war story” told for years afterward. Carlson pub￾licly berated Rob for being late, incompetent, and not capable of being part of this 190 Navigating the Engineering Organization
program. Some people present say Carlson even called Rob “stupid.” All told, it was 
a brutal dressing down.
When Tom returned from vacation, several people immediately told Tom what 
happened. Rob had performed admirably and endured this harsh public reprimand 
well. On hearing the news, Tom sat down, and with different colored construction 
paper fashioned a paper “Medal of Honor.” About 3 inches wide and 6 inches long, 
this paper medal was decorated with words like “Great Job” and “Courage under 
Fire.” Tom then called a meeting of their group, asked Rob to come forward, and in 
front of everyone pinned this paper medal to his shirt.
Rob loved it. He had it framed and for the next 18 months proudly displayed this 
paper medal on his desk. The lesson here was by taking the time to create a unique, 
one-of-a-kind reward and publicly honoring him for the bullet he took on Tom’s 
behalf, Rob received a truly meaningful recognition. And he valued that medal more 
than any gift from some nameless catalog. Tom really appreciated Rob, and Rob 
really appreciated the gesture.
While meaningful recognition is a good management practice your bosses should 
use, there is no such thing as a “perfect” reward or recognition. And it is certainly 
impossible to please everybody at one time. What is important is the perceived 
equity between the accomplishment and the recognition, not absolute sums. Reward 
systems should be tailored to the individual, and clear, simple expressions of appre￾ciation are better than “make it fit,” rote gestures.
7.2.7  Flattening the Organization: Job Promotion vs. Enhancement
I’m willing to bet that, early in the recruiting process, you had a discussion about 
promotions: the time it takes to get one, how much would any pay increase be, what 
do you have to do to earn one; all the questions every employee asks going back to 
antiquity. And those are very good questions. Yet over the past several decades a 
purposeful and premeditated trend among large organizations, including engineer￾ing firms, is the idea of “flattening” the organization. You may have heard the term 
in describing “driving decisions down” into the organization or increasing employee 
responsibility. Whatever name is used and whatever rationale is given for this flat￾tening trend, one outcome is obvious: there will be less opportunities for promotion. 
If the span of control in a firm was 6 to 1, and flattening now makes the span 10 to 
1, it just means fewer open positions at the next level and greater competition for the 
spots that remain.
This is not a secret to anyone. Supervisors, managers, and directors all have had 
these conversations over the past decade with their employees. One of the more cre￾ative solutions to this reduced promotion opportunity is called “job enhancement.” 
Here, the employee stays in the same location on the organization chart, but the 
nature of the work changes. Now, this is not just another phrase for “doing more work 
for the same pay.” Job enhancement is different. Insightful managers and supervisors 
know their people. They know what each individual engineer gets excited about, the 
assignments that give particular satisfaction to their employees. In short, good man￾agement knows what their direct reports like and what motivates them.Understanding Human and Hard Resources 191
Knowing that there may be a longer time between promotions, supervisors will 
adjust assignments for each engineer, sending them desirable, unique assignments as 
available. In other words, these engineers receive more meaningful, important, and 
higher-status assignments, chosen by what is truly important to them.
Let’s take our friend Greg Gullette, a highly regarded engineer hired about 18 
months ago. Greg’s specialty is data visualization, and his professional interest 
extends to designing new visualization techniques that simply and accurately con￾vey sophisticated data quickly. Greg’s supervisor judges Greg to be a high-potential 
employee and would like to reinforce Greg’s success so far. Knowing it’s too soon 
for Greg to qualify for promotion, his supervisor instead selects an assignment that 
might’ve gone to a more experienced engineer: designing a visualization tool using 
“4D” analytics, a new field that promises a great leap forward in engineering analy￾sis. As no one in the company currently works in this area, Greg has the opportunity 
to become the company’s internal subject matter expert on 4D. The status and impor￾tance of the assignment reduces the emphasis on waiting for a promotion. Greg’s job 
is enhanced.
7.2.8  The Dual Ladder
It is almost certain that you, at some point, will be part of an organization employing 
many technical researchers, engineers, and scientists at a number of levels. Normally 
located in separate Research and Development or Product Development groups, 
these technical specialists thrive on inventing new materials, innovating new digital 
methodologies and investigating whatever their curiosity demands. These technical 
specialists are the company’s engineering elite.
Yet this means you may face a dilemma in your long-term career direction, a 
future choice that can be both stimulating to you personally and productive for the 
organization. 
A Technical Specialist means just that: a specialist in inventing, innovating, 
developing, and applying new technologies. Their skill set is deep and very specific: 
fulfilling a niche in a wide technological territory. In theory, technical professionals 
are motivated by desire to contribute to their fields of knowledge and to establish 
distinguished reputations within their disciplines. They are not the same as man￾agement, those supervisors and managers who direct the organization. Their skill 
sets are different, their goals are different, and their worldview is very different. 
Management desires upward mobility in the organizational hierarchy by focusing 
more on achievement of company goals and acquisition of organizational approval 
than technical excellence. Technical Specialists covet the opposite.
For decades, traditional companies with embedded technical subgroups had but 
one career path open to engineers: a traditional management path that moves high￾potential engineers ever upward, performing less and less technical work and more 
and more purely management functions. Technical work falls away at each level until 
the engineer becomes a full-time administrator.
But what if your professional aspirations are technical in nature? What if your 
goals are in conflict with the organization’s available career paths, especially if you 192 Navigating the Engineering Organization
are working in a large organization with many non-technical employees? In these 
cases, going into management creates a built-in conflict of values, where engineers 
with a technical value set are placed into nontechnical occupations, with values and 
definitions of success that differ significantly from those in technical organizations.
The Dual Ladder system is an organizational arrangement designed to solve this 
problem by providing meaningful rewards and alternative career paths for technical 
professionals.
The dual ladder is a specific corporate policy of providing promotions and 
rewards along two parallel hierarchies: advancement in a traditional managerial 
career path or advancement as a technical professional. The purpose here is to pro￾vide more equal status and rewards at equivalent levels in both the technical and 
traditional managerial hierarchies. In short, the dual ladder rewards technical profes￾sionals (especially scientists and engineers) for outstanding scientific and technical 
performance without having to remove them from their professional discipline. The 
major difference between the two is that traditional managers always have engineers 
reporting to them: pure technical specialists do not normally have staff working 
directly for them. This organization arrangement is shown in Figure 7.4.

FIGURE 7.4 Dual ladder organizational structure. Understanding Human and Hard Resources 193
While this sounds pretty good, there are some cautions to consider when con￾sidering following the dual ladder. A new engineer will probably not have a well￾defined notion of success in their early days, so their first-level supervisor will play a 
strong role in shaping the new hire’s view of the dual ladder system. Technical spe￾cialists will sometimes bias their advice toward the technical route. The opposite is 
also true: supervisors who are on the managerial ladder may unintendedly influence 
an employee to follow that path. This is natural: people advocate for what they know 
best. Just be aware that some subtle bias may occur during your career discussions.
Another caution is the tendency for inertia to occur in your career development 
when you are placed on one side of the ladder or the other. Technical new hires tend 
to be placed in technical specialties populated by other technical specialists, provid￾ing a bit of a cocoon that keeps the technologist within the technical community. 
Mirroring that, engineers placed on the managerial side of the ladder may tend to be 
kept on the managerial track. If this is your desire, all is well. If not, if you intend to 
move between managerial and technical tracks, you must establish linkages across 
the two tracks so that you are known to both sides. Being known is the key to mov￾ing back and forth. Just like the actor who takes only villainous roles or just comedic 
scripts, you will become “typecast” in your role in the organization. And you want 
to be sure you are typecast in the role that is right for you.
7.2.9  Thee versus We: Your Place in the Team
The word team is loaded with meaning, and endless books, blogs, and articles dis￾cuss what is their purpose, how teams should be organized, how they work together 
and generally get along. Your entire university career was undoubtedly filled from 
morning to night with teams: project teams, study teams, presentation teams, design 
contest teams, and probably teams washing the dishes in your dorm cafeteria. That’s 
fine and I recommend you check out any of the many, many books on “how to do” 
teams. At this point, it doesn’t matter which one.
Here, though, we will take a little bit different view regarding teams. Not all 
teams are created equal. In many organizations any group of employees are called a 
team, even when they are not. For a team to be legitimate, we must be very careful 
in defining what we mean, what we want from them, and how we will operate within 
them. This is hard, and very, very few groups of engineers can truly be called teams.
Let’s approach teams as a tier concept, where each level in the tier refers to a type 
of team. Dependent on the level, the appropriate approach, way of operating, and 
expected result will vary. We can think of teams as populating four basic tiers:
The Pseudo Team
Also known as the “One Team,” this is a group of people (sometimes a very large 
group) that are a team in name only. None of the typical characteristics of a real team 
are present. An example of this is calling an entire corporation or company “Team 
3M,” “Team Cisco,” or “Team Tata.” The pseudo-team may be very large, but it 
doesn’t matter except for the number of T-shirts ordered: these are simply corporate 
advertising slogans and are not teams by any definition.194 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The Project Team
A project team normally takes the name of the project or product they are work￾ing on. Typical examples might be “Team Cyborg” or “Team Deep Magic.” These 
can also be very large, but at least they have some sort of goal or identity to muster 
around. A project team tries to include everyone involved and is acceptable in some 
situations such as when building a strong subculture.
The Near-Ideal Team
These tend to be small and have expansive characteristics that actually promote a 
valid team attitude and action. These teams should be flexible, create mutual trust, 
and create a subculture where everyone truly pulls their weight. Their link to corpo￾rate management is loose and more freedom of action is their advantage. A good clue 
to its existence is if the team leader knows everyone on the team.
The Ideal Team
The rarest type by far, it is small, confident, and creates high anxiety for their 
management. Known for self-direction, autonomy, and creativity, these are highly 
sought-after positions where everyone knows everyone, and trust is strong and exists 
everywhere. The ideal team is like a Los Angeles street gang. It sets its own goals. Its 
members decide how to achieve those goals. It decides who is on the team and elects 
its own leader. And, most importantly, it is self-funded. If you believe you are part of 
an ideal team, just apply the street gang test: you may be surprised.
These four descriptions do not begin to describe the characteristics, uses, and 
appropriateness of each team type. Teams are complex creatures, and Table 7.3 more 
completely describes each team’s characteristics.4
Everyone knows you will be assigned to at least one, if not several teams imme￾diately upon arrival. While not initially assigned as the leader of a team, you will 
need to judge what kind of team you are placed in, how does the team operate, what 
do they need, and, most importantly, is the team set up for success or not. Making 
these judgments helps you adjust the way to contribute to the team in a legitimate 
and meaningful way.
Note that ideal or near-ideal teams can have another name, even though that name 
is very rarely used today. In engineering it’s known as a task force or a tiger team. 
These are defined as special groups brought together for an urgent, distinct, singular 
purpose (read this as “crisis”) and are expected to disband immediately after com￾pleting their task. The subculture of a task force tends to be hard-edged. The goal 
is paramount: little slack is cut for extraneous discussion, rambling speeches, or 
other wasted time or effort. The common goal of tiger teams or task forces is getting 
the assignment done extremely fast: time is of the essence. It also implies that tiger 
teams only select the most talented or knowledgeable people to be members, creat￾ing their own subculture.To be selected for a task force is normally seen as an honor.
Teams can also experience teamicide, the destruction of a work team due to any num￾ber of reasons. These reasons can be secrecy, defensive management, strong bureaucracy, 
or fragmentation of people’s time or effort. It can be caused by physical separation, silly Understanding Human and Hard Resources 195

7.2.10 When Is a Mentor Not a Mentor?
Personally, the topic of mentorship drives me a bit crazy. Most HR departments pro￾vide what they call “mentorship” programs for their new employees. Colorful, styl￾ish websites containing beautiful process charts accompany these programs, hoping 
to give new employees the sense that company management is truly invested in the 
arc of your career.
Unfortunately, these programs (which I’m sure you’ve already read about on that 
website) are not mentoring programs at all. For true mentorship has a precise and 
important meaning.
Mentorship is a very specific kind of employee guidance. It is special, unique, and 
frankly, somewhat rare in actual practice. In contrast, your company’s definition of 
mentorship is something completely different.
A company mentorship can be boiled down to what that website talks about; a 
monthly meeting with a mid-level engineering manager designed to answer ques￾tions and receive company-approved information that is safe and true. This is a HR 
program designed to answer the decades-long complaint by new hires for career sup￾port from experienced employees. And for routine matters and surface-level advice 
and guidance, this is perfectly fine. After all, most of this advice consists of telling 
you to look at a given webpage. And it’s very cheap: no real investment is made 
by the organization into this kind of development. In short, this type of program is 
convenient but lacking in the quality of its information. This is not real mentorship.
The guidance gained by true mentorship, however, is golden. True mentorship is 
a relationship between two individuals: a person asking for advice, guidance, and 
assistance, and an experienced employee with the capability, power, and willingness 
to invest in that person. In short, a mentor has one job: to tell you the secrets of the 
organization. That’s it; it’s letting you in on the mysteries of how things really work 
and provide you rich information on what in the world is going on.
Obviously, mentorship is not limited to engineering firms only. All organizations, 
whatever their goal or purpose, have mentors and mentees. An interesting story 
about mentorship comes from the book Man of the House: The Life and Political 
Memoirs of Speaker Tip O’Neill. O’Neill was the 47th Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. As Speaker, O’Neil was responsible for passing (or blocking) all 
legislation before the U.S. House, controlling which legislation was brought forward 
and passed and those bills that didn’t. No law was passed in the U.S. Congress unless 
O’Neil agreed and supported it.
In the early 1980s, the American automobile manufacturer Chrysler was in deep 
financial trouble. Chrysler was on the edge of bankruptcy and out of financial options. 198 Navigating the Engineering Organization
As a last resort, Chrysler was about to ask the U.S. government for $1.5 billion 
in loan guarantees to avoid liquidation. To that time, it would be the largest res￾cue package ever granted by the U.S. government to an American corporation. 
This was a highly contentious issue, as many House lawmakers were ideologically 
opposed to providing any government guarantees to private companies whatsoever. 
Yet other lawmakers felt to let Chrysler fail would deeply hurt the U.S. economy. 
At the height of this crisis Lee Iacocca, the new chairman of Chrysler, asked to 
see Speaker O’Neil in his Capitol Hill office to discuss a potential rescue package. 
O’Neil picks up the story:
“When Iacocca came into my office to tell me about Chrysler’s problems, he brought 
an entire entourage, including members of his board, lawyers, and lobbyists. As soon 
as everyone was assembled, Iacocca held forth on the various pressures affecting 
Chrysler and outlined his plan to bring the company back to life. When he finished, I 
thanked him for coming in and explaining his situation.”
“The following day a mutual friend called O’Neil to ask:
Friend: “So what went wrong?”
O’Neil: “What do you mean?”
Friend: “He [Iacocca] called me and said you were the coldest bastard he ever met.”
O’Neil: “What did he expect? He came in with a whole damn army. Do you think I’m 
going to tell them how to get the job done in front of all those lawyers and 
lobbyists? They’ll just take credit for my ideas. Tell Iacocca to come back 
and see me, just the two of us, head-on head, and I’ll tell him what to do.”
When Iacocca returned, O’Neil told him quite specifically how to pass bailout legis￾lation that would get bipartisan support. O’Neil would only tell Iacocca the secrets of 
how to get legislation passed if it was done in private. Iacocca took O’Neill’s advice 
point by point and Chrysler got their loan guarantees. A simple lesson in mentorship 
saved tens of thousands of U.S. jobs and helped keep Chrysler viable throughout the 
next three decades.5
So how do you know if you are in a true mentorship relationship or a HR pro￾gram? It’s actually quite simple to judge, as shown in Table 7.4.
There’s an easy way to think about mentors and mentorships. Unlike a company 
program, a true mentorship is a relationship, built on trust and mutual respect. The 
mentor invests personally in the recipient, supports them in their goals, and takes 
pleasure in their success. In many cases the mentor wishes to “pay back” for help 
they may have received on their own personal journey. Whatever the reason, the 
mentorship relationship is extremely valuable and special. If you come to have one, 
treat it with great care and attention.
7.2.11  Hidden Testing, When You Least Expect It
Perhaps you thought that once you left university, you would never be tested again. This 
is certainly not true. You will be tested, and not at a time, place, or subject of your choos￾ing. True, you will not be traditionally assessed using a web-based, multiple-choice, Understanding Human and Hard Resources 199
video-enhanced site or asked to write an essay on the history of C++ coding, but you will 
be quizzed at least once (if not several times) a week in an ongoing oral exam. This nor￾mally happens during the well-known and beloved “one-on-one” meeting, where your 
boss will actively check on your work, with your answers verbally provided on the spot. 
Actually, this sounds much worse than it really is, as these questions and answers will be 
embedded in a normally pleasant conversation about your current and future results. But 
this meeting has exam-like characteristics, and your grade will be built up day after day, 
week after week in these minor, but cumulative, examinations.
This “one-on-one” or individual meeting with your boss is 95% universal. It’s designed 
for your supervisor to handle daily business with you: to assign tasks, review your prog￾ress, and generally try to understand you as an employee and as an engineer. These nor￾mally take place each week, and, because we’re using digital scheduling devices, will last 
precisely one hour. Your supervisor may set the agenda for this meeting (an agenda here 
just means a list of topics he or she would like to discuss with you, and vice versa). As 
time goes on and the supervisor becomes more comfortable with you, they may have you 
design the entire agenda for the meeting. Again, these do not need to be formal agendas, 
but a general list of important items that you need to touch base on.
We’ll talk more about the one-on one meeting in Chapter 10, but for now please 
practice for these individual meetings featuring unscheduled questions and other 
exciting conversations. Because there is a reason: you will be assessed when you 
least expect it.
Sometimes you may be tested by your immediate supervisor in a way that you do 
not know you’re being evaluated. Some of these tests will be a spur of the moment, 
while others will be designed in advance.

One master of the hidden test was an engineer by the name of Norm Zeiger, a very 
experienced, no-nonsense, and respected supervisor. Norm was a straight shooter 
and didn’t suffer fools gladly. Because of his experience and approach to managing 
engineers, many new college graduates were assigned to Norm for training. And 
Norm did not disappoint.
Norm had a trick he used on all his new graduate employees. He would select a tech￾nical topic, say, the design of the new automotive headlamp. He would tell the new engi￾neer to coordinate with a technical lighting specialist in an adjoining building. What 
Norm did not tell the engineer was the lighting specialist was a close friend. Norm 
would call up his buddy and tell him, “I’m sending over a new hire. Be sure to give 
them a hard time and let me know how they did.” Inevitably, the new hire would meet 
with Norm’s friend and be subjected to an aggressive, in-depth technical question and 
answer conversation. As promised, Norm’s friend would report back on how the trainee 
performed. Norm would then hear the new employee’s account of the meeting, evaluate 
the two different stories, and then counsel the trainee on what they may or may not have 
done correctly. Norm would never let the new engineer in on the secret, but each trainee 
certainly remembered the experience. As a result, Norm was very effective in develop￾ing his people through these tests, and the rest of us loved him for it.
7.2.12 Characters You Will Meet
We can’t finish this section until we talk about some interesting characters you will 
undoubtedly meet in your new engineering firm. Depending on the size and age of 
the firm, you may not meet these people all at once, but the odds are overwhelming 
you will meet at least a few of these interesting personalities over time. These are my 
own classifications, and you will certainly create your own catalogue after bumping 
into these people in hallways, meeting rooms, elevators, the cafeteria, and on busi￾ness trips. Here are a few brief sketches:
The Intrapreneur
Some of your most interesting engineers. We all have a good idea of the entrepre￾neur; a self-starting rule-breaker who looks for opportunities and takes the personal 
risk in developing new products or services. The intrapreneur is the corporate ver￾sion of the entrepreneur. You know these people because you will never see them. 
They will never be in their office; their office will be an absolute mess and their 
voicemail will constantly be full. Why? Because they are busy looking for the next 
new thing, which they know is not in their office. And when you do bump into them, 
they are moving at the speed of light and quickly disappear. In a word, they are the 
ghosts of the engineering firm.
The Technician
The technician is just what you might think. Relentlessly rational and highly dedi￾cated to whenever technology they are working on, technicians are essential “get it 
done” individuals who are worth more than their weight in gold when it’s time to 
deliver a new technology. These are excellent people to get to know.Understanding Human and Hard Resources 201
The Bean Counters, aka Pencilnecks
Oh yes, our finance friends. Finance people are overwhelmingly well intentioned, 
friendly, and genuinely earnest about their role in the company. Many feel a personal 
responsibility for minimizing company costs, be they big or little, which is certainly 
deserving of respect. Yet some engineers develop a bit of an attitude toward finance, 
and while there may be a natural conflict between the finance people and any other 
department within the firm, respect for their professionalism and a sense of humor 
really goes a long way with these folks (despite their nicknames).
The Malcontents
These people are corrosive. These are the individuals who are continuously com￾plaining, with an overall negative outlook about the company’s future, their col￾leagues, your company’s latest products, and just about anything else having to do 
with your firm. Spending too much time with malcontents rubs off and can impact 
your own attitude, and not in a good way. Be polite and keep your distance.
The Marketing Whiz
You can easily spot the marketing whiz. These are outgoing, high-energy, engag￾ing, and likable individuals who tend to attract attention. Get them talking about 
the marketing game and you may quickly discover that deep down, they might view 
themselves as just a little bit smarter than anyone else in the room. I suspect this 
view is based on a belief in their personal insight into the human condition, which is 
of course their job. If they could speak to engineers in more quantitative terms, they 
might be a bit more persuasive.
The Walking Egos, Big and Small
The name says it all. Walking Egos, no matter what their level or position, are com￾mon: in every department, in every specialty and every part of an engineering orga￾nization. They are easy to spot in any meeting, as their comments are skewed to be 
ever so slightly pompous. Sometimes they are very entertaining, especially when 
they don’t mean to be.
The Court Jesters
Always good for a joke or funny story, Jesters provide a welcome break from the 
daily stress and seriousness caused by the precision work of many engineering orga￾nizations. But unfortunately for them, unless Jesters have a way of instantly switch￾ing to a serious, focused, and fully professional demeanor, they will suffer from low 
credibility, even when their engineering insights are spot on. They trade gravitas for 
likability, to their detriment.
The Company Boys and Girls
Enthusiastically pro-company, many new hires initially end up in this category. A 
positive and energizing asset to their departments, more experienced employees will 
give company boys and girls a pass on their behavior, as their enthusiasm is a normal 
phase of their integration into the firm. These are enjoyable, useful people.202 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The Nervous Nellies
Some engineers, including supervisors, managers, and directors, live in abject fear of 
making a mistake or not being in total control at all times. To them, committing any error 
opens them to criticism, embarrassment, or, in their mind, dismissal. In the extreme, this 
belief can freeze their ability to function, even in low-risk situations. See also nervous 
wreck, worrywart, hand ringer, scaredy-cat, nebbish, and bag of nerves.
7.3 HARD RESOURCES
Fortunately, understanding and using hard resources is a much easier task than deal￾ing with its human counterpart. For one thing, hard resources are inanimate objects. 
They don’t have personality issues or talk back or take rash actions on their own. 
They just sit there and wait for somebody to do something with them.
As mentioned earlier, hard resources are the nonhuman tools, facilities, equip￾ment, cash, and other physical commodities that, when coupled with human 
resources, assist transforming inputs into desired outputs.
While we can talk about computer systems, ergonomic chairs, fiber optic net￾works, test equipment, prototypes, and so many other things, the common factor of 
each is, of course, money. All hard resources can be transformed into money: the 
only questions are at what value and how fast. Money is your friend. With money, 
all things are possible. So, let’s talk about operating within the money system your 
firm might use.
First, let’s get our terms defined. We defined hard resources as any physical 
object such as tools, facilities, equipment, and other physical commodities that has 
worth. This includes money in any of its forms; cash or other liquid securities that 
has value to you today. You will hear the words “funding,” “money,” and “budget” 
used interchangeably; this is incorrect. Money is not funding. Money is immediate; 
funding is a promise, and budget is a schedule to convert funding into money. Your 
finance department, immediate management, or other authority promises you fund￾ing, scheduled and specified by a budget, to receive the money needed to complete 
your job. This promise is conditional. It is reexamined and renegotiated periodically 
(perhaps annually, semiannually, or quarterly), where progress and performance are 
reviewed, and if your work is deemed worthy, funding will continue.
All hard resources are fungible. Fungibility refers to a hard resource’s (or asset’s) 
ability to be exchanged for something else of equal value, in this case the ability 
of a hard resource to change forms: from cash and its infinite variants into equip￾ment, facilities, data, or other objects. All resources are fungible in that all can be 
ultimately turned into any other form of value through sale or barter. The only dif￾ference is that each change in form changes the worth of the resource: normally a 
reduction in value, sometime substantial. Obviously, I can sell a piece of test equip￾ment for cash; I just won’t get anywhere near the original value of the equipment, and 
it may take an eon of time.
Changing a hard resource from one form to another is hard work; so hard that 
doing it within an organization is normally a last option that smacks of desperation. 
It’s seen as a low percentage play and thus not practiced widely in most engineering Understanding Human and Hard Resources 203
groups. Instead, the equipment or other hard resource is usually forgotten in a corner 
somewhere and eventually scraped as its original use fades from memory.
7.3.1 Projects and Their Funding
A word about your work and this whole world of funding. As we’ve mentioned 
before, some engineers have a natural disposition to stay away from anything that’s 
not the development of core technology. After all, it can be hard enough to deal with 
advanced engineering innovation; knowledge of funding is an unneeded burden. The 
money questions should be left to the money people.
Unfortunately, this approach runs counter to the aim of becoming a “profes￾sional.” A professional has not only mastered their projects and core work, but they 
also know the peripherals: finance, timing, purchasing, warranty, service, and all the 
other disciplines involved in a successful project. And funding is a prime peripheral 
that needs to be clearly understood, if nothing more than to protect the ongoing via￾bility of the work. That said, let’s look at how a typical assignment would normally 
be funded by this specific hard resource called money.
When it comes to funding your work, the seven different functions of engineering 
identified in Chapter 1 (Research, Development, Design, Test, Production, Construction, 
and Operations) fall into roughly two categories: project work and operational work. 
Project work is the creation and development of something new, an object, service, or 
other effort that results in something not previously in existence. Research, Development, 
Design, and Construction are of this type. Operational work supports an existing pro￾cess, product, or activity and includes Test, Production, and Operations.
Budgets and funding for operational work tend to be stable: required funding is 
essentially the same year-to-year, with perhaps slight adjustments for inflation or 
operational improvements. For operational work, finance management uses a relativ￾istic funding technique, which merely means last year’s budget level is carried over 
to this year, with a small adjustment made as necessary. Project funding is a different 
animal. Projects are defined as work which focuses on completing a task. As most 
projects create something new, there is no history of how much money is needed to 
drive forward a concept’s creation, development, and delivery. Funding (along with 
its partner, timing) is an open question where estimates are unreliable, overly opti￾mistic, and generally wrong. For these projects, a zero-based budgeting method is 
used, where the overall project is broken down into its component parts and each part 
has an estimated budget assigned. Error upon error occurs, resulting in a total budget 
that could charitably be called “creative.”
This matters, as many new engineers will initially be assigned project work. In 
larger companies, you may be assigned one, two, three (or even more) projects to 
deliver; the number being determined by each project’s size, complexity, urgency, 
and your capabilities, keeping you more than busy throughout the day. Since you 
are part of a group of other engineers, your projects will become a portion of your 
supervisor’s project portfolio, a portfolio being nothing more than a grouping of 
projects under the management of a single person. Each project has a cost estimate 
attached which projects how much money is needed to complete the project. As just 204 Navigating the Engineering Organization
mentioned, these projections are wildly inaccurate. Nonetheless, these projections, 
once approved, become an individual project’s final budget. And combined, they 
become the supervisor’s portfolio budget.
This “projection, approval and combination” task cycles through ever-higher lev￾els of the organization, creating bigger and bigger bundles of projects. Each super￾visor’s portfolio is combined with other peer portfolios to create the manager’s 
portfolio; managers’ portfolios are combined to create the director’s portfolio and 
onward up the organization chart. That is, until the whole list of projects (which can 
easily number in the hundreds) arrive at the finance department. Theoretically, here 
finance reviews the entire portfolio, asks (hopefully) insightful questions, attempts 
to test the feasibility of the project proposals, and then sets and approves the overall 
budget for the entire collection.
Now here’s the key insight. The decision-making authority regarding the funding 
level of individual projects does not permenantly reside in the finance department. 
Once approved, portfolio management authority is delegated back down to local engi￾neering management, and local management has the power to shift, mix, and match 
funding between projects and portfolios at will. If Project A is $40,000 over budget 
and Project C is $60,000 under, the supervisor can shift $40,000 from Project C to 
cover the overage of Project A. This balancing act occurs repeatedly up and down the 
engineering hierarchy throughout the year and is strictly internal to the local organiza￾tion. Local engineering management controls the budget. Finance is not involved: they 
are interested only in the overall portfolio number, not individual projects.
One more important point regarding project funding. Everyone has great ideas 
about what technology projects to pursue. It is a “law” of technology development 
that there are at least 5 times more projects ready to develop than money available to 
start them. This creates an ongoing, eternal struggle to choose the best, most prom￾ising technologies to develop through some kind of Darwinian contest for survival. 
This results in a group of worthy, but unfunded, projects called something like the 
“next up list.” If a previously approved project is canceled or stopped, there is always 
a new project ready to be elevated and begun.
Why this is important is its linkage to the financial balancing act above. If a man￾ager’s entire portfolio is spending at a rate slower than initially projected (and it nor￾mally is), or certain projects are canceled during development for whatever reason, 
the local organization would then not spend their entire approved budget. Knowing 
the amount of the shortfall as early as possible is very useful, as management can 
now pull ahead some “next up” projects and maximize their portfolio’s effectiveness.
Of course, this begs the reoccurring question of “spending to your budget,” the desire 
to match actual spending to that wildly inaccurate projection made a year or so ago.
Surprisingly, bosses may not necessarily try to spend to their budgets exactly. 
This is because spending to a budget target level becomes a message to their man￾agement that falls into any of three categories:
1) Spending beyond the budget by some small amount. Many managers want 
to come in at some nominal value over budget (say, 3% or 5%) every year. 
This message says they are highly effective in using their resources (no Understanding Human and Hard Resources 205
money is left on the table), and they need every penny of their existing bud￾get (plus a bit more) for next year. It sets them up to argue for an increase 
the next budget year.
2) Hitting the budget exactly. This boss wants to be seen as absolutely in con￾trol of their work and thus be perceived as a highly effective manager. Yet 
hitting a budget exactly never, never happens. After all, the entire system is 
unstable, so reporting an exact hit is highly suspect. It leads some to believe 
some book-cooking might be involved. It strains credibility.
3) Spending substantially below the budget in a non-crisis year. Some man￾agers think they are a hero by underspending their budget by a significant 
amount (say 10%) in a given year, hoping they will be seen as a “star” team 
player. In a noncrisis year, this may be actually counterproductive. It shows 
one or more of the following:
a. Their initial budget projection was substantially padded, and the excess 
money could have been used for other projects.
b. There is a major risk of having next year’s budget permanently cut by 
the amount of the underspend.
c. Their project objective was too conservative, indicating a reluctance to 
stretch their goals to an appropriate level.
There is one caveat here, having to do with the “noncrisis” condition. If the organiza￾tion is not in a financial or other operational crisis, this message holds. If an organi￾zational crisis exists, financial or otherwise, all bets are off.
7.3.2 Budgets and Budgets
So far, we’ve been talking a lot about management’s tactics regarding funding. But 
what about your own approach to this whole world of money?
Say you’ve submitted a budget proposal for next year’s projects. It’s been approved 
and you’re ready to go, looking forward to delivering that technology breakthrough 
you’ve long dreamed about. Perhaps that funding approval was difficult to land, but 
now that’s in the past.
Unfortunately, you’re nowhere near home yet. Approved budgets are unstable. 
Remember, an approved budget is not money; it’s a promise of money. And like 
your unreliable friend who promised to pay you back that $50 three months ago but 
hasn’t, an approved budget isn’t any good until the funds transfer actually occurs. 
Finance (or management) have an endless assortment of reasons why they can, at 
any moment, delay your funds transfer, reduce the amount (the most common form 
of instability), or outright rescind their approval (rarer, but always there) for your 
funding.
Remember, project funding normally occurs in groups or tranches, and your 
project or task is bundled with other projects and managed as a group. And since 
approved engineering budgets are unstable, traditional technical firms have “annual” 
budgets that can be revised something like three to six times a year. If your project 
spending isn’t proceeding swiftly after approval, your project can get caught in one 206 Navigating the Engineering Organization
of these revised budget exercises. The threat to your funding is real, as if you haven’t 
spent it quickly, management or finance may think it must not be that important. 
Their response is to commandeer your unspent funding for something more “impor￾tant” (or perhaps to a project with an engineer who is a better advocate than you). The 
lesson is clear: the instant your project is approved for funding, spend your budget.
What about the situation where your project is short of funding and you need an 
infusion of cash? This commonly happens, as we already know the entire budget 
estimating process is inaccurate. If your boss is supportive and backstops your short￾fall, no problem. If not (for whatever reason), you may experience various excuses 
explaining their lack of support.
One technique a supervisor or manager may practice is the blanket “we don’t 
have the budget” statement. Say you require $25,000 to purchase an updated soft￾ware load for your project you didn’t anticipate initially. Your budget cycle begins on 
January 1st and ends on December 31st. You discover you need the new software by 
May 28th. You go to your management and request the $25,000 supplemental fund￾ing. They immediately turn you down, cold. The stated reason? “We don’t have the 
budget,” i.e., “It’s not anyone’s fault, we just don’t have the money.”
This is as old as Methuselah. The truthful statement is: “We choose not to give 
you the money.” Management may decide it’s too much trouble to process, your 
project may not be deemed that important, or it may be that they don’t trust you yet 
or you’re too new to be taken seriously. Whatever the reason, “we don’t have the bud￾get” avoids uncomfortable conversations. And for the amounts you’re dealing with, 
it is a nearly universally false statement as we already know funds can be transferred 
from other projects if desired.
There is a simple (but a very provocative, high-risk) way to test this reason: ask to 
see the budget and the year-to-date (YTD) spending against that budget. Management 
probably won’t have an accurate YTD summary on hand, and the budget may be sev￾eral months out of date. Of course, even if they do have accurate data, they probably 
won’t show it to you anyway. Budget matters are very sensitive, and asking to see the 
budget and associated spending will be a major sign that you don’t trust what they are 
saying, as well as indicating you want to rummage through (what they feel is) their 
own private business. And overall, pressing for funding too hard will run the risk 
of burning bridges. Best to withdraw and come back another day. This gives your 
management time to regroup and eventually find the money.
7.3.3  Economy and False Economy
Obviously, every technical (and other) organization, no matter how large or small, is 
interested in minimizing their cost of doing business. And it’s fair to say all employ￾ees would sign up to this ground rule. After all, low expenses mean higher profits for 
a given revenue level, leading to (hopefully) all employees sharing in that profit. But 
there are areas of company financial policy where the pursuit of true savings leads to 
the fantasy land of false economy.
Formal financial policies are a way of imposing economic discipline on a system, 
and the corporate travel department has a huge number of these policies in place. Understanding Human and Hard Resources 207
Proclamations require employees to do this, don’t do that, only book travel from cer￾tain websites, only stay at these hotels, don’t exceed this daily allowance for meals; 
these rules are pretty much universal. If you travel for your job, you will see this 
immediately.
Why does this happen? Because even though a company’s total travel costs are gener￾ally minuscule compared to other corporate expenses, they are closely watched for two 
reasons. First, management may tend to think business trips are fun and subject to abuse, 
and second, travel costs are extremely easy to track. Thus, travel costs are the number one 
item to audit during normal times and cut during any business downturn. Its influence is 
far beyond the actual impact it has on the corporate bottom line.
One example of pursuing false economy had to do with a major factory auto￾mation firm named ARGON Systems, whose specialty was providing automated 
assembly systems for appliance makers. ARGON had a strict policy: travel expenses 
(especially for foreign trips) would be rigorously controlled.
Michelle McQuaid, an engineer for ARGON based in Atlanta, Georgia, was 
tasked with negotiating a new $21 million contract with their tier-one supplier 
located in Cologne, Germany. To finish the contract, Michelle was required to travel 
from the United States to Germany and negotiate a 9.7% reduction in the cost of the 
agreement. Michelle, though well versed in the technical details of the contract, was 
not a trained negotiator, and she knew she was going to have to be “on her game” for 
this face-to-face meeting.
The meeting was set for 9:00 on a Thursday morning, Cologne local time. To 
prepare, Michelle submitted a travel plan for her to leave Tuesday evening, fly east 
through the night, and arrive at 7:00 Wednesday morning. This would give her 24 
hours of recovery time from jet lag and obtain last-minute intelligence from her local 
Cologne staff prior to the negotiation.
You can imagine Michelle’s surprise when management turned down her travel 
plan. Instead of leaving Tuesday night, she was required to leave Wednesday eve￾ning, fly all night, arrive at Cologne at 7:00 AM, and immediately take a Lyft to the 
meeting at 9:00 AM. The reason? By policy she was not allowed to spend an extra 
night on “non-core company business.” The fact that this plan would put Michelle 
into an exhausted state, unprepared, jetlagged, and otherwise poorly functioning was 
trumped by the need to save $207.52 for one night’s lodging and $87.43 for meals.
The meeting was a mess. In her groggy state, Michelle missed a newly inserted 
clause that negated any hope of a reduction and, under certain circumstances, would 
actually increase the cost of the contract by 1.3%. Also, she misunderstood a clause 
stating the timing of a certain critical component would be extended by six weeks. 
All told, instead of achieving a 9.7% reduction, she increased the contract cost by 
11% and put her product timing at risk.
This could have easily been avoided if the company offered a realistic, flexible 
policy that allowed exceptions due to the importance of the activity. The only thing 
needed was to empower her supervisor or manager to make these kinds of decisions 
on their own. Taking away responsibility and decision-making power from local 
management and making it automatic and nonnegotiable negates the purpose of the 
control policy. A simple solution, but not implemented.208 Navigating the Engineering Organization
You will see many, many examples of this kind of false economy. Your respon￾sibility is to point this out and, by asking questions, urge supervision to address it. 
You may or not be successful, but as they say, “the key to change is repetition.” Keep 
bringing these examples up when appropriate. A single win in the future begins with 
the effort today.
7.4 REALIZATIONS
Dealing with resources can be complicated. While human and hard resources are 
two separate, but related, commodities, both are of high value. Hard resources are 
relatively easy to deal with, while human resources require skill, patience, empathy, 
and an arsenal of understanding to navigate this mysterious world.
The purpose of the Human Resources department is to administer the policies 
of the organization and creatively solve unique, one-of-a-kind problems related to 
personnel issues.
These policies can include the rules controlling performance, behavior, and 
numerous other topics stemming from the messy interaction between an organiza￾tion and its members. Since this messiness can easily spark conflict and contention, 
then an excellent strategy toward dealing with HR, your colleagues, and manage￾ment means always leaving room for subjective judgment and understanding.
While hard resources are easier to deal with, certain hard resources are closely 
monitored by finance and associated purchasing departments, meaning the difficulty 
in obtaining and using these is more than you might think. And ensuring enough 
hard resources for what you need to do may take a surprising amount of your energy 
and time.
Yet while hard resources are inanimate objects, these objects are still controlled 
at some level by humans, which can sometimes create behaviors that are defensive 
or well intentioned but difficult. Funding is the most common sticking point, as it is 
fungible and viewed as the most important category of hard resource. Various indi￾viduals and departments have over time developed strategies to control and manipu￾late funding. Some are common, and some are specific to the organization.
When dealing with funding and budgets, just remember our discussion from 
Chapter 3: nobody knows anything, and that includes budget estimates. Management 
knows this. The key action in these situations is to apply creative and innovative 
thinking to overcome these common barriers.
At this point, let’s change our perspective and address an area a little closer to 
home and perhaps more enjoyable: the Technical System.

8 Exercising the 
Technical System
8.1 A UNIVERSE OF SYSTEMS
It’s a good assumption that the Technical System is where you will begin your career. 
This is where your technical training from university is finally applied. For you, 
operating within this space is the most straightforward and comforting of all the 
components we’ve outlined, and where your performance is best demonstrated and 
most easily measured.
As located in Figure 8.1, the Technical System refers to the work processes, tech￾niques, machines, actions, analysis, tools, and all other objects used to transform 
organizational inputs into outputs.1
The Technical System is probably the easiest way to begin to understand how 
your organization works and your work within it. As discussed in Chapter 5, most 
technical jobs are well-defined, repeatable, relatively easy to do with appropriate 
training, and straightforward to manage. And you will not be alone there: working 
directly within the technical core is where the overwhelming number of new gradu￾ates will be placed. Technical system jobs cover the waterfront: big and small, nar￾row or broad, so it is relatively easy for management to match the appropriate job to 
new engineers just entering the company.
What the technical core does is simple. Just as the team manager in the movie 
Bull Durham lectured his ballclub after a terrible start to the season:
This ... is a simple game.
You throw the ball.
You hit the ball.
You catch the ball.
You got it?
The creation, development, and sale of a technical product or service at the enter￾prise level is the same thing:
You design the product.
You make the product.
You sell the product.
You got it?
A new engineer’s placement into the technical core is something we could call “wide 
or deep.” Simply put, technical jobs can be classified as jobs where the knowledge

required is either “wide” (i.e., basic knowledge across a wide variety of tasks) or 
“deep” (i.e., substantial expert knowledge of a particular task but little elsewhere). 
There’s an old joke about experts vs. generalists. The expert learns more and more 
about less and less until they know everything about nothing, while the generalist 
knows less and less about more and more until they know nothing about everything. 
A clever saying, but containing a nugget of truth.
Let’s consider an example of a new engineer’s placement in the technical core.
Meet Julia Müller, a graduate engineer from the École Polytechnique Fédérale 
de Lausanne in Switzerland. Julia achieved a master’s degree in acoustic design and 
analysis, a notoriously difficult specialty within engineering. She was soon hired to 
work on the aural design of future products for the dominant European headphone 
manufacturer. This is a plum job, and Julia was delighted to apply her technical 
knowledge on behalf of this well-known and respected firm.
During her first week, Julia was assigned to the production quality assurance 
organization. The purpose of this group was to test sound quality performance for 
new headphone systems to be sold to the general public. As acoustics is a highly 
advanced field that encompasses many technical concepts as well as subjective cus￾tomer preferences, Julia was first placed in a subsection of this acoustic testing area: 
frequency response measurement. From here, Julia experienced an unexpected path 
through the technical core.

In her first position, she applied the basic measurement techniques in acoustics, 
such as DB(A), DB(B), DB(C), and sones. She learned to handle the delicate instru￾mentation needing to be calibrated and installed into the test headphones to gain 
repeatable and accurate measurements. This took her months of training to achieve 
reliable results.
At this point she had traveled deeply into a very narrow subset of acoustics. 
Once she demonstrated her capability in testing, her job expanded to handle more 
subjective parts of the evaluation discipline. This entailed analysis of frequency 
response curves, design of new testing techniques, and correlation of microphone 
measurements versus customer preference data. At one point she published a profes￾sional paper for the Acoustical Society of America on a new acoustic test technique 
recently adopted by her firm. This slow expansion of her technical skills (from first 
replicating standard operating procedures to interpreting those results to mastering 
test procedures to finally creating new knowledge) is a classic example of learning 
a technical system. Eventually, Julie became known within her own organization as 
a reliable professional in “all things testing.” Soon after, Julie was tapped as a key 
member of the advanced design and implementation group. The general job descrip￾tion communicated during her hiring had finally come true, but only after an exten￾sive journey through the technical core.
The point is that technical core activities are the normal and expected route 
into the company, and making yourself known as a respected engineer or technical 
expert is a classic way to establish yourself within the firm. Here, the depth of your 
technical knowledge is your competitive advantage while you increase the breadth 
of your skills by becoming educated in adjacencies, i.e., fields related to your normal 
technical specialty. Career advancement at this early stage depends upon establish￾ing your baseline skills, and then expanding your technical prowess into adjacent 
areas, all with the purpose of demonstrating your bona fides. This general path of 
narrow knowledge transitioning to wider skill in the technical core is probably the 
most common path forward for new engineers.
In Chapter 7 we discussed the idea of hidden testing, the “pop quiz” of profes￾sional engineering. In the technical core, management’s desire to conduct ever 
deeper and more detailed questioning sometimes can’t be resisted.
At his first job at Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG, Keith Penski, a recent engi￾neering hire, had a director by the name of Gerhard Schmidt. Gerhard was not a 
“touchy-feely” kind of guy. He was one tough Swiss, taught in the hard knocks 
school of engineering. Aggressive and with a sharp tongue, he was intimidating.
One day Gerhard commanded Keith into his office and, out of the blue, asked 
him if either aluminum or stainless steel should ever be anodized. Keith was caught 
completely flat-footed, and rather than saying he don’t know (or offering to look up 
the answer), he took a guess and said yes to both. “Are you sure?” Keith said yes, 
even though he wasn’t. Ken stared at him, said nothing, and abruptly dismissed him. 
To this day, Keith is certain Ken knew he was guessing. He is also certain that he 
was tested that day, and failed his test. Keith learned he needed to have his technical 
knowledge down cold, and never try to fake an answer (by the way, the answer is yes 
for aluminum and no for stainless).214 Navigating the Engineering Organization
8.2 DECISION TECHNIQUES AS TOOLS
One of the core functions of an engineer is making choices. During your career you 
will be asked to make hundreds (if not thousands) of decisions, be they individual or 
organizational, small or large, short-term or long-lasting in their impact. And your 
home organization will make even more choices directly impacting you, many of 
which will be hidden from view or sometimes nonsensical.
As an engineer, decisions are what you will make almost daily, and hopefully 
you have already had a taste of some decision-making techniques at university. 
But as decision theory is a huge topic, your decision training may have been 
limited to a single portion of the decision-making universe: the purely rational, 
quantified optimization model. In this chapter, we’re going to cast our net a bit 
wider and touch on several other models, not meant as an in-depth discussion to 
make you an expert, but allow you to recognize what decision technique may be 
used in what application.
The first key in understanding decisions is that the choice of a decision tool is 
a major example of contingency theory in action. Decision theory is massive, with 
scores of methods, techniques and other tools that can drive a conclusion in any 
number of directions. Each decision depends on dozens of factors, making outcomes 
highly individualistic. In short, contingency rules decision-making.
Second, addressing engineering or technical decision theory in a book of this 
type is high-risk. Making decisions, especially in large technical organizations, is 
like entering a large and frightening swamp: a territory full of poisonous snakes, 
alligators, and a universe of other creatures just waiting to pull you under. In-depth 
arguments about which method to use, what assumptions are in place, and the valid￾ity of the data can consume hours, if not days. In no way does this book attempt to 
address that detailed level of decision theory. Instead, we’ll limit ourselves to a basic 
understanding of the field. With that in mind, let’s define a simple topology of deci￾sion theory and introduce some fundamentals.
First, let’s agree that decision-making is defined as the process of identifying and 
solving problems.2 There are several classifications of decisions. One classification 
is by the complexity of the decision tool used: simple applications, requiring only 
basically trained individuals or groups to successfully apply the tool, and complex 
applications, needing an individual expert or several well-trained specialists to cor￾rectly use the technique.
A second classification is by the decision method employed. Again, there are 
two general groups of methods or techniques: engineering and organizational. 
Engineering decision methods are those techniques dependent on high-quality quan￾titative data, using calculation-based, maximization and optimization approaches. 
Conversely, organizational decision models must be able to handle much more 
subjective, qualitative, and complex information. This requirement means organi￾zational methods will vary significantly from the engineering approaches. It also 
means organizational decision-making processes are more complicated, as conflicts 
often arise from disagreement among influential members or factions within the 
organization.Exercising the Technical System 215
Luckily, we can categorize decision understanding into a matrix represented by 
both the basic engineering and organizational technique used and by the complexity 
of using that method. This provides four categories of decision tools on a continuum: 
Simple Engineering, Complex Engineering, Simple Organizational, and Complex 
Organizational, as mapped in Figure 8.2.
Let’s discuss the engineering techniques first, as these may be more familiar.
8.2.1  Engineering-Based Decision Methods
As mentioned above, engineering decision methods are those techniques dependent 
on applying optimization approaches to numerical data. A landmark study by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine identified the major 
decision techniques specifically developed for engineering, science, and medical 
use. This study aimed to:
[First] … identify the strengths and limitations of tools currently used in engineering 
design as they relate to decision making and issues of risk and values. Secondly, to 
identify approaches to decision making in other fields, such as operations research, 
economics, and management sciences, that address issues of risk and value.3
The resulting nine engineering techniques are all intended to analyze detailed quantita￾tive situations. Generally speaking, while these models are placed on a continuum, three

engineering models are favored for more simple, perhaps individual-performed, analysis, 
while the other six are appropriate for group-based analysis, but this split is not compul￾sory. All nine of these techniques are based on some form of statistical analysis. Table 8.1
compares these engineering-based methodologies, their applicability and strengths and 
weaknesses in use. This table is helpful by acting as a menu of techniques to choose from 
when presented with an engineering decision assignment. One of the common missteps 
in engineering choice is having personal knowledge of only one or two techniques, so the 
analyst is forced into a method that’s a familiar, but incorrect, technique for the situation. 
This failure to honor contingency results in a case synonymous with the saying, “If you 
only have a hammer, every problem becomes a nail.”
Spending some time visiting this table will let you come away with some handy 
guidelines regarding which quantitative engineering method to use in what cir￾cumstance. After all, Taguchi may not be a good substitute for Quality Function 
Deployment, nor Pugh with the Analytic Hierarchy Process.
At this point, it’s important to talk for a moment about what may be the typi￾cal engineer’s perception of a certain kind of decision model. Many new engineers 
do not have substantial decision training and, when asked, will default to only one 
kind of decision method: rational, quantitative models. There are two types of these 
models: the purely rational view and the bounded rationality perspective. Both of 
these center on the systematic analysis of the choices available for that solution. They 
are numerically based, data-driven, and relentlessly logical, employing calculation 
as the primary means of analysis. The purely rational view does not consider any 
exceptions to the logic of the solution, even when there is substantial evidence that 
local conditions make rational-only analysis inappropriate.
The substantial limitations of the purely rational point of view drive the impor￾tance and realism of the bounded rationality perspective. Bounded rationality means 
just that: a more credible judgment on the limits and assumptions of the problem 
impacting the result. For instance, say you work in the product engineering division 
of a manufacturing firm. Your engineering division makes up approximately 10% 
of the company’s total workforce. Your director is pondering whether to offer free 
tuition for training in Taguchi methods. This executive decides to ask the workforce 
for their views. Here’s the boundary question for the survey: should management 
ask the entire workforce or only the 10% of technical employees? Obviously, if only 
the technical employees are asked, free tuition would win easily. Yet if everyone 
is asked, the probable answer will be the engineers voting yes and the remaining 
90% of the total workforce saying no, as they probably believe the engineers are 
getting special treatment: the training is denied. The validity of the entire decision 
rests on where the decision boundary is, so setting an appropriate boundary is criti￾cally important. This brings us to an essential insight. Bounded rationality explains 
the importance of both contingency theory and the pervasiveness of intuitive deci￾sion making; those decisions are based on experience and gut feelings rather than a 
strictly logical sequence of steps.
Early on, these two rational decision techniques will make up a large majority of 
your decision-making needs, but only for a while. But what about the more complex 
decision situations you will face?Exercising the Technical System 217 TABLE 8.1 Engineering-Based Decision Methodologies Title Definition Primary Use Complexity in Applying Environment Where Used Advantages Disadvantages Ratings (a) Current Utilization Ease of Use Pure Rational The systematic analysis of the choices available for a given decision situation.

As mentioned earlier, a wide variety of engineering decision methods are avail￾able, varying in their complexity from moderately challenging to severely diffi￾cult. Most of these decision techniques support design alternative decisions. These 
include Decision Matrix, Pugh Method, Quality Function Deployment, and many 
more: all of these are not trivial and involve training and practice to truly become 
viable additions to your toolbox. Dependent upon your current and future positions, 
coaching in certain of these techniques will become mandatory, and it will be up to 
you to acquire that education at the right time.4
8.2.2 Organizationally Based Decision Models
As mentioned earlier, unlike engineering models, organizational decision methods 
can handle a much wider, more subjective, and complex information set. This capa￾bility means their fundamental methods will vary significantly from purely numeric 
engineering techniques.
Like the engineering methods, organizational models are classified by the com￾plexity of the decision tool, from simple applications used by basically trained indi￾viduals or groups to complex applications, needing specialists to apply the technique. 
Again, a continuum links these different applications.
Of course, the major difference in organizationally-based models is the involve￾ment of more individuals attempting to make a choice. By their very nature, group￾based decision processes will be more complicated than individual, where most of 
these complications arise from an inability to control the beliefs, views, and certain￾ties of the group members, a professional version of “herding cats.”
This means the outcome of the group approach can be mixed. There is truth to the 
contention that “two (or more) heads are better than one,” but that assumes all the heads 
are equal in organizational level and power. If not, the group can easily be hijacked by the 
most senior, longest-tenured, or most loquacious participant. Proceed cautiously.
Of the many, many organizational choice models available today, four are impor￾tant to mention:
Management Science
The Management Science approach is the organizational analog of the purely ratio￾nal approach in the engineering category. It is based on the use of statistical and 
mathematical tools to find an optimum solution to a particular organizational prob￾lem. Also known as the operations research approach, this method is best used for 
problems that are both analyzable and where the variables can be identified and 
measured. “Identified and measured” is the key phrase here. Unfortunately, these 
variables are the Achilles’s heel of Management Science. Not all variables can be 
identified, and certainly not all variables can be measured with any degree of accu￾racy or precision. Dependent on the system’s sensitivity, a small error in an input 
value can create a major error in decision output.
Carnegie
The Carnegie Model is the organizational version of the bounded rationality approach in 
the engineering classification. Carnegie emphasizes bounded rationality principles (such 220 Navigating the Engineering Organization
as limited time, information availability, and the mental capacity of the decision-makers), 
as its primary ground rule states that a purely rational solution often cannot be legiti￾mately derived. As in many organizational situations, disagreement among managers 
may force the formation of coalitions who agree on decision goals or priorities. Thus, the 
Carnegie Model emphasizes the political process involved in decision making.
The fascinating thing about the Carnegie model has to do with how it is applied. 
Due to the factors mentioned above, managers tend to engage in “problemistic 
search,” that is, looking for a quick solution in the immediate, local environment 
rather than trying to develop an optimal solution. Thus, a solution is often chosen to 
satisfice (satisfy + suffice) rather than optimize. This means management will select 
the first alternative that both satisfies the decision criteria and is “good enough” to 
be implemented. This is an important point, as the majority of decisions in engineer￾ing organizations are of this type. There is rarely, if ever, time to purely optimize. 
Satisficing is the name of the game.
Mintzberg Incremental
The Mintzberg Incremental process model is based on research into the actual deci￾sion-making processes of firms developing new products. This model emphasizes a 
step-by-step sequence of activities leading to a solution. In it, major decisions are 
broken down into smaller steps taking place in three major phases: identification, 
development, and selection, with each phase containing a specific series of activities.
One insight from the Mintzberg approach is that some organizations tend to make 
a series of small decisions in a certain order, ultimately resulting in a large, final 
choice. One disadvantage in this approach is that final decisions may take a very long 
time, making it unappealing for corporate use.5
Integrated Contingency
The Integrated Contingency philosophy is based on two dimensions. The first is goal 
consensus, that is, the degree of agreement on goals among decision-makers. The 
second is technical knowledge, i.e., the understanding of the cause and effect rela￾tionships in place that can lead to decisions that reach the group’s goals.
This is much easier said than done. In this approach, complexity is high, multiple 
decision techniques must be correctly applied, solution accuracy is poor due to the 
multiple models used, and the speed to solution can be very long. Not a very appeal￾ing approach.
To précis these major models, the summary shown in Table 8.2 may be helpful.
So, what can we say about these decision-making tools? First, all these approaches 
recognize the purely rational approach is often inapplicable, as decisions are bounded 
by limits set by the external environment. These limiting factors are many: time avail￾able, the mental capability of the decision-makers, insufficient information, scarce 
resources, boundaries on personal relationships and on the social constraints of the 
individual. Second, due to their contingent nature, organizational decision-making 
models can easily fragment as the assumptions used for different situations change 
and multiply. Third, generally speaking, for organizational analysis the bounded 
rationality and Carnegie approaches appear to be the most-used choice models.Exercising the Technical System 221
Finally, approaching decisions requires some basic analysis before jumping into doing 
the actual choice calculations. Contingency demands a thoughtful selection of method as 
a first step. And because of the substantial variability between decision model outcomes, 
for important decisions some practitioners may even repeat the decision analysis using 
two (or sometime even three) different models to triangulate in on a more valid outcome. 
In short, don’t become a slave to a particular decision model, but take a moment and 
consider your decision-making options as a required first step.
8.2.3  Decision Risk and Failure
One important factor we haven’t touched on yet: decision failure. There are dozens 
and dozens of conditions that cause either a failure to make a decision, or where a 
decision is made and found to be wrong.
The riskiness of every decision can be organized on a four-position scale accord￾ing to the availability of quality information concerning the possibility of failure.

The first position is the certainty that all information for what the decision-maker 
needs is fully available. This position is unrealistic; all decisions must contain some 
level of uncertainty. The second level of risk means a decision has clear-cut goals and 
good information available but has associated alternatives that are subject to chance. 
The third is uncertainty, which means a manager knows which goals they wish to 
achieve, but information about alternatives and future events is incomplete. The final 
level is ambiguity, meaning goals can be achieved, yet the problem to be solved is 
unclear, the alternatives are difficult to define, and information about outcomes is 
unavailable. This is by far the most difficult decision situation, requiring the most 
robust decision techniques available, yet understanding the risk will still be exceed￾ingly high. These levels are summarized in Table 8.3.
Many individuals or groups will try to assess riskiness through some form of 
numerical or quantitative technique, assigning values to certain conditions believed 
to be true at that time and then perhaps applying an algorithm to arrive at an answer. 
A plethora of methods are commonly available and can have varying degrees of 
effectiveness based on the method and the analyst’s skill in using it. In short, most 
analysts at some point will employ a quantitative technique.
It may seem counterintuitive, but the importance of analyzing risk in engineer￾ing decision-making is its value in actually performing the quantitative assessment, 
not in the numerical result. Performing the steps in a risk analysis process gives the 
analyst a better visceral understanding of the risk to inform the current and future

decisions. It’s not about the destination; it’s about the journey. Coping with uncer￾tainty demands thoughtful analysis from all analytic approaches, coupled with mak￾ing decisions when the time is right, such as before the future is clear to competitors.
8.2.4  A Different Type of Decision
Now, here comes something to think about. These decision models are all well and 
good. However, your local management, dealing with local questions, is more con￾cerned with a different kind of decision. Let me ask you: in a normal, local engineer￾ing organization, what is the most desirable type of decision:
1) An optimized decision
2) An accurate decision
3) The right decision
4) A good enough decision
5) A fast and correct decision
6) A wrong but fast decision
7) A reversible decision
Table 8.4 may give a clue to the answer.
Management decisions tend to default to speed. But why speed above all else? 
The cynical view is there is an unspoken belief that fast results imply competency 
TABLE 8.4
Ranking of Decision Importance Judged by Local Management

Importance Type of Decision Rationale
1 A fast decision Management continuously under pressure to answer questions 
from superiors immediately, no matter the quality of the

2 A good enough

Management likes low-cost, fast decisions, provided the answer 
is somewhere in the range of OK. Good enough fits the bill
3 A wrong but fast 
decision
Remember, there may never seem to be enough time to make a 
correct decision but there is always time to repeat the 
assignment

and skill, that the decision-maker is “on their game.” And fast decisions provide sig￾nificant leeway to cover errors in the decision: the inherent uncertainty of the quick, 
incomplete information available at the time of the decision provides air cover. Voilà, 
a fast decision.
Perhaps. But there is a more legitimate reason for fast decisions. The com￾pulsion for speedy decisions has to do with risk mitigation. Coping with uncer￾tainty demands making decisions when the time is right, before the future is 
clear. Much of the art of decision-making is anticipating the right time to make 
it. This means the organization must focus on surfacing critical issues quickly, 
performing the necessary approximate analysis fast and then nimbly decide on 
the action in concert with critical timing requirements. Correct decision timing 
means less risk.
8.2.5  Implementing Decisions
In engineering projects of a certain size, we have a tendency to put total effort and 
energy into making the decision regarding “what we are going to do?” Endless 
scenarios, return on investment calculations, and risk assessments are launched 
to make sure the decision is “right.” Unfortunately, many times the implementa￾tion phase, the “how do we intend to do this” portion of the project tends to get 
minimum attention and support. For decisions that are small to medium in size, 
overwhelming attention is sometimes placed on making the decision but not very 
much on its implementation.
Say your local group needs to upgrade their materials performance laboratory to 
speed up new product evaluations. Naturally, a user committee is formed, and after 
five months of weekly meetings generating equipment lists, specification arguments, 
and multiple visits to your director’s office, your committee decides on the configu￾ration of the new lab. Management approves the decision, and with smiles on their 
faces, everyone closes their laptops and makes for the door, happy the decision was 
made and relieved the effort is over. Yet very little is normally discussed about how 
this decision will be successfully implemented. An undeniable habit for many is, for 
small to modest projects, to immediately forget the decision just made and move on 
to the next topic or assignment. The decision itself is a fait accompli: implementation 
is left to flounder and, to management’s surprise, six months later little (or nothing) 
has been done to implement it. The decision tends to be thought of as the totally of 
the assignment: nothing more needs to be done.
We can argue the reason for this. Perhaps it’s the natural exhaustion that occurs 
after the crescendo of work on the decision. We take a break and somehow move onto 
the next urgent assignment, promising ourselves to come back to the implementation 
as soon as we finish this other quick task. Of course, we never come back. Another 
possibility is that implementation is just not considered a high-status assignment. In 
some organizations, implementation is perceived as being left to the “second string￾ers”: it’s old news and nobody wants to be part of yesterday’s work. Or perhaps the 
implementation suffers from resource starvation, where implementation is viewed 
strictly as a cost so the necessary people, money, and equipment are not provided.Exercising the Technical System 225
There are other reasons as well, but these reasons alone can be enough the scuttle 
a project. If management is smart it will lavish some of the same attention and fund￾ing on implementation as it does on the actual decision-making.
8.2.6  The Trap of Decision Making
The field of behavioral economics brings us to an unfortunate possibility: becoming 
snared in our premeditated beliefs about the decisions we are making.
Dr. Karl Weick has spent significant time examining this issue within decision￾making, providing some essential insights and potential pitfalls regarding this temp￾tation of choice.
Specifically, Weick suggests an alternative view of the bounded rationality model, 
where decision practice is actually different from what is believed. In 1995, Weick 
published the contention that much decision-making is not based on rational or even 
bounded rationality techniques, but instead is based upon the decision-maker’s feel￾ing about the topic, and, after a decision is made, will go back and search for reasons 
why the original choice was selected. This is surprisingly common, especially in 
complex decision-making environments. In other words, Weick argues that people 
justify their decisions only after they make them, and will try to convince others they 
“had decided” before they actually took the action.6
Early mentions of this trap go back several decades. The economist John Kenneth 
Galbraith mentions an early version in his thoughts on conventional wisdom:
We associate truth with convenience, with what most closely accords with self-interest 
and personal well-being or promises best to avoid awkward effort or unwelcome dis￾location of life. We also find highly acceptable what contributes most to self-esteem.
Economic and social behavior are complex, and to comprehend their character is 
mentally tiring. Therefore, we adhere, as though to a raft, to those ideas which repre￾sent our understanding.7
Let's take the example of a classic suburban family in the United States, wishing to 
buy a new vehicle for two parents and their two young children. There are many, 
many vehicle choices available in the market, including sedans, coupes, crossovers, 
sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and pickup trucks, all with gas, diesel, electric, and 
hybrid propulsion systems. The family selects a plug-in hybrid electric SUV with 
a high-end trim package and excitedly brings it home. Their neighbor, spying their 
new purchase in the driveway, naturally congratulates them on their new vehicle. 
And inevitably, the next comment is a question: “Why did you choose that particu￾lar vehicle?” And just as inevitably, the new owner will list several functional and 
responsible features, such as the vehicle’s safety rating, environmental responsibility 
credentials, command seating position, advanced communication electronics, and 
any number of sensible attributes.
But there’s another reason, rarely, if ever, mentioned to the neighbor. Frankly, 
what is probably never shared is the defining decision point: that the vehicle chosen 
is a premium brand, and the vehicle makes a statement as to the status and success of 226 Navigating the Engineering Organization
the breadwinners in the family. The choice of this SUV becomes an emotional deci￾sion, and its features are used as a kind of “retrograde rationalization” supporting the 
purchase. This happens constantly, yet no one will hear somebody buy a premium 
branded product and actually say out loud: “I bought this as a status symbol.” Yet it’s 
stunning how many important decisions are made his way.
So, what can we generally say about some of the pitfalls that influence and ulti￾mately drive decision-making in individuals and organizations?
First, reliable and accurate data on the conditions the decision will be made is 
rarely available. Cause-and-effect relationships are normally not well known, and 
generally, the more important the decision, the more complex and “softer” the infor￾mation to make the decision will be. And the more complex the decision, the more 
gut feelings will be used in making a selection. And, of course, many decisions are 
sold to others based upon retrograde rationalization.
One subtle point regarding decision-making meetings. Many management deci￾sions are not decided in meetings. Instead, management decides the result in advance, 
creating a “premade” outcome that is then “decided” in meetings that look more like 
theater than actual decision events. This is very common, and don’t be surprised if 
you see this in your own organization.
These are only a few of the scores of pitfalls engineers need to understand and 
be aware of in decision-making situations. These snares are everywhere, and you 
certainly won’t avoid them all. But even an awareness they exist can really help in 
understanding these traps.
8.2.7  Understanding the Data Driving Decisions
Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West, in their book Calling B******t: The Art of Skepticism 
in a Data Driven World, highlight an emerging trend in numerical analysis and pre￾sentation: that of data visualization overwhelming insight.
In the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020–2022, the U.S. State of Georgia tallied 
87,709 cases of COVID on July 2, 2020, as shown in red on the state’s official pan￾demic case map. On July 15, 2020, that number was 135,183. Yet the graphic on the 
Georgia map looked the same: there visually appeared to be no increase in COVID 
cases. What was causing this paradox?
Between July 2nd and July 15th, the map’s threshold for cases to turn red increased 
from 2,961 to 3,769 cases, causing the map to now display an inaccurate visualiza￾tion for a key indicator of public health. One single definition change in an important 
chart could have altered the trajectory of COVID care for an entire state.8
This example points to an emerging trend: as the amount of available numerical 
data grows, the need to show that data simply through visualization can result in 
data being massaged in the name of “clarity.” This can create a world full of doubt￾ful claims based on a series of spurious data points. After all, not all charts are cre￾ated by data scientists. As a new hire, you must know how to spot visual nonsense. 
Correlation and causality are prime concepts that can be misinterpreted.
Contributing to the problem is that some scientists are not participating in the 
usual peer-reviewed publication process (see Chapter 3). Unfortunately, pressure Exercising the Technical System 227
to make exaggerated claims (both bad and good) is pushed by media, online out￾lets, and TED-like venues and expressed in poorly designed visualizations. The 
bottom line for you is that judging visualizations must become a more skeptical 
activity, and using data to drive important decisions has to be more cynically 
evaluated.9
8.2.8  Decision-Making Under Stress: The After Action Review
High-stakes decision-making is a special animal that can bite your ankle unless you 
treat it with some respect. While you probably won’t be making critical decisions 
totally on your own at this early career stage, you will be working with people who 
will. And one side effect of high-stakes decision-making you may witness and will 
be obligated to share with your management.
The mental state of the decision-maker under stress has a huge role to play in the 
quality and appropriateness of an individual decision. Executives and other senior 
management are not infallible; each have their own personal filters and emotional 
reactions when weighing decisions, and the effectiveness of their filters is directly 
proportional to the importance of the decision.
In fact, the U.S. Army actively trains their commanders to confront this invisible 
possibility. Called the “After Action Review,” or AAR, senior commanders repeat￾edly take part in major war-game exercises involving literally thousands of individu￾als and hundreds of vehicles against a simulated opposing force. In these multiday 
war games, commanders are subjected to combat-level decision scenarios. What is 
fascinating is that these commanders are individually video recorded for the entire 
game. Their entire set of conversations, directions, and orders are chronicled to give 
a complete picture of what happened in the command center during high-stress and 
high-consequence situations.
During one exercise, I witnessed a commander, in the middle of the night, give 
an erroneous order that resulted in the simulated loss of a major part of his force. 
During the AAR, this error was brought up. The commander stated (quite honestly 
and sincerely) that he did not give that order. And everyone believed that the com￾mander sincerely thought that he had not given it. Yet when the recording made in 
the command center that night clearly showed the order had indeed been given, the 
commander was stunned. He had absolutely no memory of making that bad decision. 
Only when the recording was played did he realize that the “fog of war” impacted 
the safety of his soldiers. And that’s the whole purpose of the AAR, to review with 
senior management that decisions made in the executive’s mind may not translate 
into actual results.10
Of course, it’s rare a business executive will be directing army divisions at 3:00 
am, but consider that many senior executives look to the wisdom of military strate￾gists such as Sun Tzu and Carl von Clausewitz for guidance in dynamic situations. In 
fact, many consultancies exist to provide this type of training to business organiza￾tions desiring to become more nimble in their decision-making. But the fundamental 
conclusion here is that executives, when pressurized, could likely say or do things 
that may not be in the organization’s best interest.228 Navigating the Engineering Organization
What about less dramatic situations? A good (but somewhat rare) suggestion can 
be applied to your local organization. Whenever an action is required or decision 
made (which is about 99.7% of all assignments), you can apply the concept of AAR. 
What happened during the assignment? If positive, understand why it was a positive 
outcome. If not, why not? Was it a lack of clarity? Was it a misjudgment of the facts? 
Did the assumptions made about the situation prove false?
It’s incredibly obvious this evaluation must be done: it’s just “learning from your 
mistakes.” Yet perhaps 98% or more of all assignments will never undergo an AAR. 
The reasons are simple. First, the perception is that an AAR is wasted time: why 
rehash recent history when there are new projects to start and new markets to con￾quer? And, second, an AAR could bring unwanted attention to those who might 
bear some responsibility for the outcome. Why ask uncomfortable, embarrassing 
questions which may require corrective action on someone’s part when we can con￾veniently forget the whole thing? Fundamentally, it’ll take a large and expensive 
project failure to trigger a true AAR. But for you personally, you should always take 
some time and study your outcomes, even if your group will not.
8.3 MEASURING SYSTEM RESULTS
Let’s now change gears and look at something more concrete: measuring the results 
of a technology system. On the surface, measuring the results of the technical system 
you are operating would seem quite straightforward and simple. Each morning you 
turn on the system, apply some kind of input to it, a transformation occurs within 
the system and something of value pops out. You’ll eventually come to know many 
of the technical details of the system: the voltage required, optical sensor sensitivity, 
temperature limits, and the like. And soon, you will be able to quickly identify what 
is a reasonable result and what isn’t. Report that result into the balanced scorecard 
and you’ll be satisfied that you are a contributing member of the team.
However, underneath there’s a dirty little secret.
A technical system is designed to produce a valuable output built to a specifica￾tion established to indicate quality. With production comes feedback information 
regarding that product’s specifications. If the feedback information indicates an out￾of-control condition, the operations engineer in charge (i.e. you) will normally need 
to take an action to correct the out-of-bounds condition. This is classic manufactur￾ing engineering. Unfortunately, some problems are just not measurable, yet we as 
engineers attempt to make them measurable anyway; it’s what we’re trained to do. 
This results in many situations where we believe problems are moving toward solu￾tion, but in reality, we are just taking a guess that we are measuring something mean￾ingful. Many, many times we assign as a metric something that’s easy to measure, 
yet it may have nothing to do with true progress.
The quality guru Edward Deming shared a famous story about this. A factory 
wished to improve the acceptance rate of their product (ball bearings) by instituting 
a quality improvement program. This program consisted of an award given once a 
month to the “willing worker” who produced the highest percentage of bearings that 
met the quality control standards. Every month a ceremony was held in the factory Exercising the Technical System 229
to publicly award the fortunate winner. Yet after months of award ceremonies, qual￾ity remained at the same low level. Called in to solve the mystery, Deming’s team 
discovered that the Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts showed the machinery 
producing the bearings was incapable of providing “in control” parts. This meant no 
matter which adjustments the worker made to the machinery; a random rejection rate 
would result. In other words, the program was not about quality control but instead 
became a lottery, where pure luck was the only factor for who was awarded. Only 
when the manufacturing equipment was redesigned to produce “in control” parts did 
the award program become legitimate.11
Measuring something for the sake of measuring something is not helpful. Make 
each and every one of your measurements mean something legitimate. Don’t end up 
running a lottery.
8.4 TYPES OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS
At this point, we need to touch on a couple of the different types of technical systems 
found within the Inner Core. How should a technical system be chosen to facilitate 
and optimize operational work processes? As you already suspect, there can be an 
infinite number depending on the conditions present. To keep things simple, we’ll 
very briefly touch on two very different types of technical systems: manufacturing
and service.
8.4.1 Manufacturing Systems
The seminal classification of manufacturing work was developed by Joan Woodward, 
who developed the work-type topology we still use today.12
Woodward defined three overall types of manufacturing:
1) Group I – Small-batch and unit production
2) Group II –Large-batch and mass production
3) Group III – Continuous process production
Each one of these groups has its own basic characteristics, as shown in Figure 8.3.
As you already know, the main focus in manufacturing today centers on forms 
of flexible manufacturing. Flexible manufacturing systems are very common and 
have been in place for many years now. These systems include computer-aided 
design (CAD), where digital systems assist in drafting, design, and engineering of 
new parts; and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), where digitally controlled 
machines accomplish material handling, fabrication, production, and assembly 
tasks, increasing the speed of production for unique and intricate parts. Coupled 
with these machines are integrated information networks that link all aspects of the 
organization from design and manufacturing to supporting organizations such as 
accounting, purchasing, marketing, and inventory control.
Two relatively recent, game-changing developments in manufacturing systems 
are lean manufacturing (that implements the combination of just-in-time production, 230 Navigating the Engineering Organization
quick changeover, and continuous improvement) and the revolutionary and rapidly 
expanding area of additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing has already dem￾onstrated its capability to radically expand its reach, through the use of new mate￾rials and techniques in an ever-accelerating cycle. This cycle benefits unique part 
production, to reducing assembly complexity, and to providing an infinite number 
of customized versions of the same base product. As of this writing, the scope and 
reach of additive manufacturing is still being discovered, yet we do know this tech￾nology has the strong potential to upend traditional thinking about mass customiza￾tion and materials science. The current relationship between product manufacturing 
flexibility and production unit size is summarized in Figure 8.4.
13,
8.4.2  Service Systems
Service is a special form of product which consists of activities, benefits, or satis￾factions offered for sale. These are intangible and do not result in the ownership of 
anything at the end of the service. They are unusual in that services are produced 
and consumed at the same time, and that these services cannot be separated from 
their providers. This signifies that service systems are fundamentally different from 
traditional manufacturing systems, as the product is not a hard object but is an action 
perceived as satisfactory to a customer. This is noticeable in Figure 8.5. Technical Flexibility

FIGURE 8.5 Traditional customer service process.232 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Researchers Peter Mills and Newton Margulies define three basic types of service 
interactions:
Maintenance – Interactive
A cosmetic relationship between an employee and client in order to maintain or sus￾tain a relationship. Examples are banks and insurance providers.
Task – Interactive
A concentrated interaction between the employee and client where the focus is on the 
task to be performed, such as in advertising and engineering.
Personal – Interactive
Where the interaction focuses on the improvement of the client’s direct intrinsic and 
intimate well-being. Common examples are teachers and professionals such as doc￾tors, lawyers, and counselors.14
The characteristics of these three service types can vary widely, and the design of 
an engineering service system will depend on addressing unique service characteristics 
for each type. In terms of expense, training, support functions, and intangibility of the 
goal, these service systems are a substantial challenge to traditional engineering firms.
But this hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm of engineering firms or manufacturers 
to enter this potentially lucrative adjacency. A relatively new hybrid form for manu￾facturing firms is the industrial service transition company. Manufacturers are now 
increasingly adopting service-based strategies to maintain competitiveness. These 
firms develop product-related services through a dedicated service division designed 
to exploit the commercial opportunities of servicing an installed base of equipment. 
They employ a strategy of integrated solutions to enhance competitiveness of the 
manufacturer’s core product offering, as it is now difficult to maintain competitive 
advantage purely through technological leadership.
Examples of this hybrid are both the General Electric and Rolls-Royce aircraft 
engine divisions of their respective firms. Today, the majority of their income is derived 
from servicing their engines, rather than merely selling the base product.
8.4.3  Technical System Satisfaction Measures
Technical systems in engineering firms provide for customer needs by creating prod￾ucts and services fulfilling these needs, and one of the measures of a company’s 
success is high customer satisfaction ratings. For decades, high satisfaction ratings 
have been the crowning achievement for all firms, including engineering firms spe￾cializing in product development. There is a cottage industry of companies that inde￾pendently provide initial or time-in-service satisfaction measures such as J.D. Power, 
Ipsos, and Nielson. You often will see firms tout these measures in mass market 
outlets, all attempting to snag some conquest sales as a result.
In these surveys, customer satisfaction is commonly used as a synonym for qual￾ity, with a higher number indicating higher quality. Yet customer satisfaction is not 
quality: quality is a subset of customer satisfaction.Exercising the Technical System 233
And quality is much more than a numerical report. As we discussed in Chapter 3, 
quality measures really must partner qualitative data with the existing quantitative 
information. A good way to perform this trick is with the Kano customer satisfaction 
model. The Kano model, shown in Figure 8.6, is a marketing quality management 
technique used to establish client or customer satisfaction.
Three factors influence satisfaction. The first are basic factors. These are mini￾mum requirements set by the customer which will cause dissatisfaction if they are 
not provided but do not create customer satisfaction if they are fulfilled or exceeded. 
These are prerequisites in the market and are taken for granted: these are expected 
and, if missing, are dissatisfiers. For example, if you purchase a new mobile tele￾phone and it lacks a high-definition camera, this is a dissatisfier. If the camera is 
there, you’ll take no notice of it.
The second factor are performance factors. These cause satisfaction if perfor￾mance is high, and cause dissatisfaction if performance is low. These are directly 
connected to the client’s explicit needs and desires, and are sometimes referred to as 
traditional quality measures. If something works, great, that’s as expected. If it’s not 
working and you must have it repaired, that’s a dissatisfier.
The most interesting factors are the excitement factors. These are sometimes called 
“surprise and delight” features as these factors increase satisfaction if delivered but 
do not cause dissatisfaction if not delivered; the client feels they got something extra 
with their purchase or service. Premium luxury brand automobiles provide excite￾ment factors continuously. The Tesla electric vehicle line makes it their specialty to 
provide surprises in their vehicle and support systems that cause huge satisfaction

and “halo effects,” which has helped Tesla move to the top of the electric vehicle 
business globally. Many firms realize the “excitement factor” quality measure and 
strive to provide these positive surprises whenever possible.15
To sum it up, service technologies are fundamentally different from product 
development or manufacturing technologies. You will probably or certainly spend 
time in the service technology area as well as product development. These are two 
distinctly different tasks but are designed to give you a broader understanding of 
what a technology system really is.
8.5 MELDING THE TECHNICAL SYSTEM TO THE ORGANIZATION
This one should be a no-brainer. The technical system delivers the core prod￾uct, service, or desired output to the organization. It is the proverbial goose that 
lays the daily golden eggs. Yet there are situations when the connection from the 
Technical System to the organization becomes broken. This happens when atten￾tion is diverted from the core purpose of the company by political infighting, an 
external crisis, or both.
In the early 1990s, a global automotive firm began to develop a traditional four￾door mainstream sedan (or saloon as our European friends call it). Just as the pro￾gram got underway, a complete corporate reorganization commenced involving 
nearly all the senior management of the corporation. This reorganization took a very 
long time: about 24 months. During those 24 months the saloon program proceeded 
and the appearance and functionality were finalized, but without review or direction 
by senior management (who were too busy reorganizing to pay attention to the pro￾gram). When the new management finally came around, they were presented with a 
less than exciting vehicle with even less than exciting features. That ship had sailed: 
it was too late to change either its appearance or competitive feature set. And it sank 
without a trace in the marketplace. The technical system and rest of the enterprise 
communication links broke, and there was no recovery possible.
8.6 REALIZATIONS
The technical system of the typical engineering organization can be immense, even 
when considering small firms. The number of technological tools available for your 
use, even in startups, is nearly infinite.
Yet the most useful tool that applies to the entire technical system is decision￾making. A universe of decision methods abound: some technical and some organi￾zational. Many are detailed and quantitative; fewer are broad-based and qualitative, 
and many, many are misused. Yet if correctly chosen, these tools can be applied with 
enthusiasm and presented with certainty and confidence. The step-by-step mechan￾ics of applying these decision tools is not what we are about here. Instead, the aim 
has been to understand the conditional limitations of each method and the contin￾gent foundation they rest upon. The major models outlined represent a wide range 
of viewpoints and assumptions regarding how and when to use certain decision 
tools, as all decision models fall cleanly into contingency theory. High-uncertainty Exercising the Technical System 235
situations tend to call for more complex, “organic” models, while low-uncertainty 
situations can use more rational, quantitative approaches.
Selecting and applying a combination of decision-making models to the same 
question is a potentially wise choice, especially for high-uncertainty, high-risk situ￾ations. And in both the engineering and organizational contexts, speed of decision￾making tends to overshadow accuracy and optimization: urgency is the game.
Looking between the lines you may begin to see the limitations of our current 
decision-making processes. The main limitations are a lack of accurate data, uncer￾tain cause and effect relationships, and even limitations on defining the problem to 
be solved. And future decision-making will only become more complex and urgent, 
and our models must be updated to contain this trend.
The After Action Review shows that decision-making under stress can result 
in bad decisions, including those that are not even remembered. And the act of 
decision-making can attract the majority of management attention while deci￾sion implementation (especially for certain smaller decisions) may be starved. 
As a professional, the many decisions you and others will make will have some 
weakness or flaw you must see, understand, and accept as you nonetheless use 
them to do your work.
The good news is that, for technical system design, the way forward is relatively 
straightforward. Woodward’s fundamental studies in the typology of work remain 
valid. Service technologies vary from traditional product development technolo￾gies in that service is consumed immediately upon creation and generally can￾not be stored. As a result, original equipment manufacturers are now increasingly 
adopting service-based strategies to maintain competitiveness and open up paral￾lel revenue paths.
Finally, tools like the Kano Customer Satisfaction Model, with their three sat￾isfaction factors of basic, performance, and excitement, allow product designers to 
better target their features to maximize customer satisfaction.
Now, with our survey of the firm’s technical systems complete, let’s address some￾thing a bit more squishy and ill-defined. Let’s search for the Hidden Organization.

9 Searching for the 
Hidden Organization
9.1 SEEING THE INVISIBLE: THE HIDDEN ORGANIZATION
An organization’s hidden culture is one of the most interesting (and confusing) areas 
of understanding for any new company employee, not just for engineering organi￾zations but for any collection of individuals in any line of work or play. Illogical, 
obscure, surprising, veiled, startling and sometimes upsetting, a hidden culture 
exists within all companies and firms, invisibly operating at all levels and at all 
times. While it can be located nicely on a diagram, as in Figure 9.1, in reality a 
company’s hidden organization is a unique, one-of-a kind specter that inhabits every 
nook, corner, and cranny of your workplace. And it cannot be ignored.
Understanding and operating within your organization’s hidden culture can be 
challenging for any of us, but doubly so for new graduates like yourself. Most of your 
mistakes and blunders will occur in this cultural zone, the only question being the 
extent of the damage. At the jump, I strongly urge you to, early on, focus your atten￾tion on this hidden world, where logical cause-and-effect ceases to exist and where 
Alice in Wonderland would feel quite at home.
Many of us may perceive that engineering organizations have one single culture. 
Yet on reflection, you’ll find manufacturing plants are different than laboratories, 
product development is different than engineering sales, and technical service is 
different than R&D. Engineering cultures are uncounted and uncountable. And you 
need to know which one you’re dealing with at any particular moment. In short, you 
must search for the hidden organization within your organization.
We need to expand on the introduction to culture presented in Chapter 5, to spec￾ify exactly what is the hidden organization (also known as organizational culture,
corporate culture, informal organization, or hidden culture) and the characteristics 
that reflect its values and expected behaviors. We should also examine the impor￾tance of culture; that it is very real and can help you with your work or damage you 
greatly. Finally, we should perform some “training” to sensitize yourself to this hid￾den entity, to see it in all its overt and covert forms.
Let’s start with some definitions. Nadler and Tushman define the informal orga￾nization as:
Coexisting alongside the formal arrangements is a set of informal, unwritten guide￾lines that exert a powerful influence on the behavior of groups and individuals. Also 
referred to as organizational culture, the informal organization encompasses a pattern 
of processes, practices, and political relationships that embody the values, beliefs, and 
accepted behavioral norms of the individuals who work there.

DOI: 10.1201/9781003214397-12
10.1201/9781003214397-12238 Navigating the Engineering Organization
It’s not unusual for informal arrangements to actually supplant formal structures and 
processes that have been in place so long that they've lost their relevance to the realities 
of the current work environment.1
A more formal definition is given by Edward Schein in Coming to a New Awareness 
of Organizational Culture:
Organizational culture is the pattern of basic assumptions that a given group has 
invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external 
adaptation and internal integration, and that have worked well enough to be consid￾ered valid, and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, 
think, and feel in relation to those problems.2
Even though engineering organizations have special characteristics, for this book, 
the definition of corporate culture can be taken directly from the non-technical case 
as defined by Daft:
[A technical or engineering culture is a] … set of values, norms, guiding beliefs, and 
understandings that is shared by members of the organization and taught to new mem￾bers as correct. It reflects the common goals, problems and experiences of the group, 
conditioned by the technological tools and processes those members use.3

Today, while seeming like a vaporlike idea, corporate culture is actually a fairly 
ubiquitous term, and the phrase engineering culture is not that far behind. Major 
digital companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google all tout their special culture 
that makes them unique and desirable places to work. Unfortunately, sometimes 
their description of their culture may emphasize golf simulators, ping-pong tables, 
and free cappuccino bars rather than a true description of the corporate culture itself.
What about a culture’s purpose? The purpose of the hidden organization is two￾fold. The first is external adaptation, meaning how an organization as an entity 
meets its mission, goals, and tasks while dealing with its outside environment. This 
includes the specific goals pursued by the group, the means to accomplish those 
goals, the criteria for measuring those results and corrective actions if these goals 
are missed.
The second purpose is internal integration, where members develop a collective 
identity so to work together more effectively. This is where you will see a com￾mon language, a particular way of working, a certain distribution of status, power, 
and authority, and the criteria for the allocation of rewards and punishment for 
noncompliance.
Engineering groups arrive at their basic culture as they learn to use external adap￾tation and internal integration methods that are good enough to be considered legiti￾mate and thus passed on to new members.4
Let’s examine the importance of culture. As just mentioned, whatever definition 
you prefer, the concept of the organizational culture is very real, and certainly can 
have a direct, immediate, and potentially significant impact on your career and you 
personally. The blunders we spoke of earlier are real and can range from minor 
(where experienced employees might share a joke about a misstep at your expense) 
to much more serious, mistakes attracting the attention of senior management. Let’s 
discuss a serious example first.
CASE EXAMPLE 9.1 THE SAGA OF LAURA KENDRIC
The McCallister Company was one of North America’s largest retailers, 
renowned for providing rock-bottom pricing on all manner of goods, from 
groceries and housewares to sporting goods and every category in between. 
McCallister’s was a beloved brand, developed over some 50 years by its 
founder Joseph McCallister, who promised the absolute lowest price on any 
item every day. “Low prices with no frills” was the McCallister credo.
By the early 2000s, McCallister’s senior management felt an updated 
advertising presence was needed to replace their tired existing brand, consis￾tent with the dawn of the new millennium. This meant fresh ideas were needed 
in the form of a new Vice President of Branding.
Enter Laura Kendric.
It’s rare the hiring of a marketing vice president would grab national atten￾tion, but Laura was not an ordinary executive. Recruited to help modernize 240 Navigating the Engineering Organization
McCallister’s brand, Kendric was hired and fired in just ten short months, the 
victim of a serious mismatch of corporate culture.
Before joining McCallister, Kendric, 36, earned an edgy reputation as 
director of brand communications at a mid-level automobile firm, notable for 
attention-grabbing, buzz-producing TV commercials, and print ads featuring 
both provocative actors and ideas. Kendric was a star within the cloistered 
world of corporate advertising, winning multiple awards for her state-of-the￾art concepts and entertaining quotes.
Given her colorful career, Kendric’s hiring by one of North America’s most 
low-profile companies struck her marketing colleagues and other insiders as 
strange. And no one was really surprised when Kendric was dismissed by 
McCallister after well short of a year.
Yet the reason for her firing ignited controversy. Two reasons were reported in 
the press, one overt and the other covert. The overt being that Kendric was fired 
for accepting gifts and gratuities from ad agencies she was doing business with; 
the covert was for refusing to integrate into an iron-clad corporate culture.
When Kendric was first approached by McCallister, Kendric was flattered 
by the exciting idea of transforming an entire company and its image. Yet 
from the first moment she arrived at McCallister in February, Kendric real￾ized that fitting in would be harder than she had imagined. The core culture 
at McCallister was the concept of “Low Prices Every Single Day,” deeply 
embedded for decades. The McCallister headquarters, with its windowless 
offices and gray walls, was hardly inspiring for a woman who liked color. One 
of the first things Kendric did was paint her office chartreuse with chocolate￾brown trim. And that was her first mistake.
When it came to the executive suite, McCallister’s senior management 
always worked in the background; there were no “stars” on the team. Individual 
attention was not the McCallister way, and a passive-aggressive subculture 
emerged to deal with any high-profile personalities.
Some new employees would keep a low profile and spend their first 90 days 
listening, but not Kendric. Interviews in national periodicals offer a glimpse 
into her thinking at the time.
“I get overly excited,” she [said], “I want to hit the ground running.”
“But we realized you don’t know where the edge is unless you are willing to go 
over it once in a while.”
“Go, go, go.”
“…. if you don’t ask, you don’t get”
“I think part of my persona is that I am an envelope pusher. The idea of change 
in general can be uncomfortable for many people, and my persona as an agent 
of change can prompt that feeling.”
Meanwhile, Kendric’s cultural mistakes came fast. One was the annual 
McCallister shareholder meeting, a no frills, cheaply run gathering focused Searching for the Hidden Organization 241
strictly on financial matters. In one of her first assignments, Kendric trans￾formed a dull shareholder meeting into a three-hour Broadway show, hiring a 
cast of New York Broadway-style actors who sang songs like “The Day That I 
Met Joe,” the company’s legendary founder. The show caused rolled eyes and 
shaking heads from the senior executives.
Another was the weekly senior executive “all-hands” meeting held at 
McCallister’s headquarters every week. Each Friday morning, McCallister’s CEO 
would gather together some 300 managers and executives for a wide-ranging 
meeting at McCallister's headquarters. Kendric, always on the road and unaware 
of how important it was to attend these meetings, missed several in a row.
No other executives clued her into the mistakes she was making. Even when 
Kendric heard from her own staff that “you shouldn’t be doing” things like 
planning show tunes for the annual meeting, she ignored the advice.
The beginning of the end came with the decision to hire a new advertising 
agency for McCallister, a competitive bidding process worth approximately 
$640 million. For seven months, Kendric toured the country visiting the 30 
advertising agencies that were bidding on the account. It was during these 
months of nonstop travel that Kendric made her fatal errors. Whispers cir￾culated that she accepted gifts from these ad agencies and showed favoritism 
toward certain contenders.
During that time, her conduct surprised and alarmed other McCallister 
executives. She attended a dinner given by an agency at one of Manhattan’s 
most fashionable restaurants, where she praised the agency and suggested it 
was favored in the bidding process. Her fellow executives were livid about the 
dinner because of the strict McCallister ethics rules that ban employees from 
accepting gifts of any kind from existing or potential suppliers.
Shortly after this dinner, that agency won the McCallister account.
After learning of these incidents like the dinner and other behaviors, 
McCallister conducted an investigation. Shortly afterward, Kendric was fired 
for violating company ethics policies. Three days later, McCallister announced 
the agency bidding process had been tainted and would be reopened without 
the winning agency’s participation.
What happened? At the heart of the controversy was a culture clash that 
Kendric did not see. She later reflected on the experience. Regarding the 
weekly all-hands meetings: “Had I known,” Kendric says, “I never would have 
been gone on Friday.” Yet no one told her. And she acknowledged that her 
style and ideas did raise eyebrows at McCallister, and she was never at home 
within the painstakingly modest by-the-books culture of McCallister. Rather 
than adapting, she believed the rules didn’t apply to her: she was “special.”
What did she learn? “The importance of culture, it can’t be underestimated.”5,6
Kendric suffered from ignoring the key factor of corporate culture in orga￾nizational life. Unseen, lurking in the shadows, this “thing” has the power to 
damage, hurt, and even destroy careers and people, as it did to her. Of course, it 242 Navigating the Engineering Organization
can also enhance, improve, or advance an individual’s career. This may sound 
a bit dramatic, but after witnessing a few compelling incidents about culture, 
you will see the importance of paying attention to it and working within its 
confines.
Corporate cultures are certainly not just the purview of North American firms. 
As many of you know, Asian business culture has a long-standing and strong set 
of collective, expected behaviors and beliefs. Today, many North American engi￾neers, due to their increased interaction with their Chinese counterparts, struggle 
to make sense of these specific business and social cultures. For example, in his 
book Barriers to Entry: Overcoming Challenges and Achieving Breakthroughs in 
a Chinese Workplace, author Paul Ross lists challenges non-Chinese workers may 
face today. For example, increased respect for authority and reliance on informal 
communication for data transfer means working in China is ideal for someone who 
handles uncertainty, change, and taking the initiative in engineering or business. To 
date, immersing themselves in the culture by “doing” seems to be the only solution 
for non-Chinese to solve the cultural problem.
As an example, Ross mentions that taking a break by leaving the workplace, if 
only going to the coffee shop, may be regarded as impermissible at the office: it may 
seem like this is slacking even though it could be a useful device for maintaining 
productivity.7
The point here is, as much as it may cause discomfort, your performance within 
an engineering organization is more than a strict meritocracy. Yes, doing a good job 
will be rewarded. But that’s only half the story. Remember the performance reviews 
we discussed? There were two axes of evaluation that everyone is judged: by perfor￾mance in getting the job done (measured by a hopefully objective criteria), and then 
behaviors, those qualitative actions and interactions that contribute to comfort and 
confidence. And correct behaviors are driven by culture.
Learning to understand a corporate culture can be very difficult unless you have a 
little training in how to see it. Think of the concept of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
As we know, the full spectrum of electromagnetic energy extends from 102 Hertz up 
to 1024 Hertz, and is made up of both visible and invisible energy; the visible being a 
very small portion of the overall spectrum. Thus, the human eye can only see a small 
percentage of the existing electrical energy present. It’s only when we have tools like 
spectrometers or other instruments can we then see the entire range of energy reach￾ing us. This simile is shown in Figure 9.2.
Corporate culture is the same thing. You need tools that allow you to see this 
invisible spectrum of hidden beliefs, attitudes, and actions. And the best way to do 
this is through training. Not formal training, the type you would hire a consulting 
firm to provide (I don’t think I’ve ever seen a company that offered specific cultural 
training). Instead, personal practice is the route that will help you see these invisible 
yet critical aspects of a technical organization. This practice is an activity that may 
not be efficient, but hopefully effective.Searching for the Hidden Organization 243
9.2 REPRESENTATIONS OF CORPORATE CULTURE: 
THE SACKMANN AND SCHEIN MODELS
Several cultural models have been developed over the years. Two of them are partic￾ularly helpful in giving you the best training in understanding this squishy concept. 
These models, Sackmann and Schein, do a nice job of improving your sensitivity to 
perceive and understand various cultural situations.
Let’s consider the Sackmann Model first, as shown in Figure 9.3. This model 
(also known as the Iceberg Model) is a vertical construct dividing the informal orga￾nization into two layers, “observable” and “underlying.” The observable culture is 
superficial; evidence of the culture is easy to see yet is limited in what it tells you. 
Observable examples are ceremonies, stories, slogans, behaviors, dress and perhaps 
the group’s physical setting. The underlying culture is more difficult to observe yet is 
much more valuable in defining and understanding what’s going on. This underlying 
culture includes values, assumptions, beliefs, attitudes, and feelings expressed by 
members of that culture.8
An excellent example of observable culture as expressed through a physical set￾ting is the Apple headquarters building in Cupertino, California. Apple spent a 
reported $5 billion to create a headquarters campus, designed as a seamless circle, 
nicknamed the “spaceship.” The latest design thinking on enhancing workplace cre￾ativity and innovation is embedded in its blueprint, with minimal environmental 
impact and maximum energy efficiency deemed essential. Employee convenience 
such as seven different cafes, dry cleaning, dinners, free snacks, gaming, and all the 
rest are de rigueur.
It’s not hard to see that the Cupertino headquarters is far beyond a mere building: 
it is a strong statement of Apple’s corporate culture and a powerful recruiting tool.
FIGURE 9.2 Comparing the electromagnetic spectrum to corporate culture. 244 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The second representation, called the Schein model, divides culture into three 
main layers arranged in a pyramidal configuration. Similar in some respects to 
Sackmann, the Schein model (shown in Figure 9.4) is a bit more detailed in pars￾ing out layers of understanding. In this representation, the topmost layer denotes 
artifacts and creations. This is the portion of the culture that is seen most easily 
by its members. These include physical space and objects, written and spoken lan￾guage such as slogans, acronyms and buzzwords, and the overt behavior of mem￾bers remembered in various stories, legends, and myths. These are particularly good 
examples of common artifacts.
The middle layer, values and beliefs, gives a sense of what “ought” to be relative 
to the group. Usually tested over time and proven to work, values are group-based 
ideas that are overt, espoused (i.e., spoken) by group members and acted upon with￾out hesitation.
The bottom layer and most difficult to see are the culture’s underlying assump￾tions. These assumptions are validated beliefs that are taken for granted and treated 
as reality, often subconsciously. They are ultimate, non-debatable, foundational 
expectations and principles considered the underpinning of the local organizational 
society.9
A simple example of Schein’s model is a comparison of two schools within 
the University of Michigan (U-M) campus at Ann Arbor. The U-M College of 
Engineering is large; some 10,800 students are enrolled, taught by 658 faculty in 
multiple facilities sited across most of the northern campus. The U-M School of 
Business is much smaller, educating 4,152 students (including MBAs) with 224 fac￾ulty located in a small cluster of buildings on the central campus.
Observable Culture 
Superficial, easy to see yet limited it 
what it conveys. Symbols are 
ceremonies, stories, slogans, 
behaviours, dress and physical
settings.
Underlying Culture
Diicult to observe, yet most 
valuable aspect of culture in 
terms of creating an 
understanding. Includes values, 
assumptions, beliefs, attitudes
and feelings.
FIGURE 9.3 The Sackmann (aka Iceberg) Model of corporate culture. Searching for the Hidden Organization 245
An analysis of the two cultures shows some basic differences and similarities 
between them, as seen in Table 9.1.
Let’s consider another simple example of group cultural identification and its 
resulting artifacts. Figure 9.5 shows photographs of two groups of technologists: 
one is a group of engineers taken in the 1950s, and the other a group of coders taken

around 2010. Examine the photos closely and detail the variations in the artifacts 
between the two groups. What are the differences?
You might be surprised to learn that the cultural differences between the two 
groups are …. nothing. That’s correct: there is essentially no difference in the cultural 
markers between these two photos. The 1950s group is all dressed identically, with 
dark pants, white dress shirts, and narrow black ties. They are wearing a uniform, 
identifying them as members of this group of engineers, and their dress shows it.
There is no difference between these engineers and the coders. They identify 
themselves in the same way; the jeans and t-shirts are also uniform. The number of 
black t-shirts is striking: 12 out of 15 individuals are wearing this color. Nine out 
of ten wear blue jeans (of course, we can also point out another cultural artifact: the 
number of women in the photo as a marker for gender balance in the coding field at 
that time (4 out of 19, or 21%).
Cultural behavior can also extend to ignoring certain aspects of your firm’s poli￾cies or initiatives. Discounting or failing to include culture in new initiatives can 
substantially reduce their success and effectiveness, or in some cases actually create 
a deleterious effect. In the mid-2000s, before the widespread adoption of desktop 
computing and streaming, the Ford Motor Company made a bid to improve its enter￾prise-level communication with its 300,000 employees by installing hundreds of 
large-screen televisions into all their global facilities. Placed in hallways, entryways, 
and commons areas, these screens ran company-created programming continuously, 
FIGURE 9.5 Artifact differences in technical groups: 1950s vs. 2010s. Searching for the Hidden Organization 247
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The idea was to improve company communications 
and awareness through push broadcasting of corporate news stories, with a typical 
story on this private network lasting about four minutes. The result? To this day, no 
one can recall ever seeing a single employee standing and looking at one of these 
screens: the programming played to an empty house. The entire initiative ignored an 
important cultural fact: no one wanted to be seen standing and looking at a televi￾sion screen when they believed they should be scurrying about doing the company’s 
business. No one wanted to be seen as a slacker. Within five years, these orphaned 
television screens were quietly removed at great cost to the company, leaving nothing 
but bolt holes in the walls as witness to this failed idea.
What’s important to note is not that the people didn’t want the information, they 
just didn’t want to be seen idly absorbing that information in public. Today, you 
might see a remnant of this behavior in your own company. If you visit a colleague at 
their desk unannounced, and they are reading a story on the company streaming site, 
the odds are even up they will immediately change the screen. Different technology, 
but the same culture.
Examples like this are where the Sackmann and Schein models can guide you in 
identifying your own organization’s cultural markers, values, and assumptions. And 
developing those skills is a necessary prerequisite to truly understanding your own 
firm’s culture. And this means practice.
9.3 GROUP CULTURE: THE DENISON MODEL
Even though corporate culture tends to be invisible, we can still categorize group 
cultures in a basic way. The Denison Model is a clear way of classifying broad-brush 
organizational cultures and links them to the external environment and resulting 
internal organizational strategies. It is powerful in that it is easy to understand and 
points to what a correct corporate culture for your company might be. This means it 
can be used as a diagnostic tool by your management to ensure your group culture is 
somewhere near the desired one.10
The Denison construct, shown in Figure 9.6, is a matrix linking an organiza￾tion’s level of control of its structure to its focus on the external environment. This 
continuum of structure (highly structured vs. loosely controlled) and company focus 
(high internal concentration vs. external environmental attention) results in four 
quadrants, described below:
Clan Culture
Consisting of a flexible structure with a focus on the internal workings of the group, 
the clan culture is based on a maximum human relations perspective, placing a high 
regard on employee involvement and participative management. Employees have 
substantial input on work methods and (to some extent) goals, and higher-than-aver￾age resources are allocated to employee well-being. Important exposed values of this 
model include taking care of employees, ensuring they are satisfied and fulfilled as 
much as practical, while the role of management is to integrate the culture across all 248 Navigating the Engineering Organization
portions of the firm. The fundamental purpose of the clan model is to achieve high 
performance by focusing on the needs of employees, where employee investment in 
the firm creates a greater commitment to it. An excellent example is the Mary Kay 
Corporation, a U.S.-based beauty care product firm. Their strong commitment to the 
support of their sales representatives has made Mary Kay one of the largest direct 
sellers of skin care and cosmetics globally. Mary Kay products are sold in more than 
40 markets around the world, enjoying $2.8 billion in annual revenue at year-end 
2020.11
Adaptability Culture
As the name implies, an adaptability culture emphasizes serving the external envi￾ronment, using a flexible organizational structure to do this. This approach encour￾ages “entrepreneurial” values (sometimes referred to as “intrapreneurial” values for 
large, legacy firms) and corresponding norms and beliefs. It encourages behavior 
that allows the organization to detect, interpret, and translate changing environmen￾tal signals into new responses, reacting quickly to environmental shifts in customer 
needs, wants, and desires. It values employee creativity and risk-taking with mini￾mum penalties for failure. Management’s role is to establish and reinforce a culture of 
continuous change to maintain relevancy moving into the future. An example of this 
is the 3M Company, where the 2020–2022 COVID pandemic changed their famous 
internal innovation model into one much more collaborative with external techni￾cal firms. The results were impressive: 3M designed and produced a new powered 
air-purifying respirator in just months, increasing the production of high-efficiency 
filters for COVID personal protective equipment. In 2020 alone, 3M increased res￾pirator production from 20 million to 95 million per month in the United States and 
2 billion respirators globally.12

FIGURE 9.6 The Denison Model linking culture to organizational focus. Searching for the Hidden Organization 249
Bureaucratic Culture
The bureaucratic culture tends to be the opposite of the adaptability approach. As 
its name implies, the bureaucratic structure is best for tightly controlled company 
structures with an internal focus, implying an unchanging external environment. 
This drives a methodical approach to their business with lower personal involve￾ment coupled with a very high level of operational consistency and conformity. A 
highly integrated structure aims for best-in-class efficiency and a resulting hope for 
effectiveness.
Values in these bureaucratic cultures are cooperation and mutual support among 
employees through the strong and consistent application of established policies. 
Management’s purpose is to continuously reinforce this culture of control, process 
improvement, efficiency, and a highly mechanized approach to work. A good exam￾ple of this culture is the U.S. Internal Revenue Service with its annual deadlines, 
stable purpose, and easy-to-measure performance.
Mission Culture
The mission culture resides within organizations that value control of the business 
while keeping their attention on the external environment. The mission approach 
maintains a clear vision of organization’s purpose and goals, having a significant 
dependence upon metrics for employee evaluation and performance, competitive 
firms, process improvement, and bottom-line financial results.
Mission cultures value beating the competition while using superior processes 
to help achieve this goal. Management’s role is to strengthen this culture through 
training, education, and by example. An excellent illustration is the beverage com￾pany AB InBev, whose emphasis on professionalism, ambition, empowerment, and 
aggressiveness are key values. And for AB InBev, it works. Market share in 2020 
was 25.7% vs. 12.2% for its nearest competitor. AB InBev owns the market.13
These four models offer a good initial understanding of how corporate culture 
directly impacts company competitiveness and performance.
Let’s now move on to look at models focused on you as an individual to deal with 
culture on a day-to-day, local basis.
9.4 SELF-AWARENESS IN CORPORATE CULTURE
Let’s say you’ve developed a reasonably good skill at reading your group’s informal 
culture, and you begin to see some group behaviors and beliefs that are endemic to 
your local organization. For instance, say you perceive a tendency for your work￾mates to come in late and stay late, or perhaps tend to work at home four days a week 
and only come in on Monday afternoons. Or witness that “Taco Tuesdays” are actu￾ally an important group bonding experience that’s not to be missed.
Whatever the specific behavior or event, once you see it begs the question: what 
are you going to do about it? What I mean is, what is your own reaction and decision 
regarding your participation in your local organization’s culture? I’m not talking 
about grabbing a taco on Tuesday. I’m referring to your own decision as to how much 250 Navigating the Engineering Organization
you will embrace the prevalent culture, especially considering the power the culture 
can exert over your thinking and actions.
An example of this kind of decision happened to Reed Kitteridge a number of years 
ago. Reed was a new engineer, helping to design the Boeing 757 commercial airliner. It 
was a Saturday, and he was sitting at his desk trying to understand the internal arrange￾ment of some avionics equipment in the fuselage. Reading his blueprints, he just could 
not visualize how the parts came together. In the assembly building a quarter mile away, 
the first prototype was coming together and one of Reed’s colleagues suggested he walk 
over to the assembly area and look at the equipment bay in question. As Reed stood 
up and grabbed his coat, one of the older “gray heads” asked Reed what he was doing. 
Reed replied, “I’m headed over to see the prototype.” The gray engineer’s reply startled 
him: “So, going sightseeing on overtime, huh?” This stopped Reed in mid-stride. He 
immediately understood that leaving his desk to see the fuselage, while a big help to 
him, was seen by the others as a form of slacking. Reed took off his jacket and sat down. 
Now, the next regular workday, Reed went over and saw the prototype with absolutely 
no comment from anyone. But the message he received was clear: certain actions done 
during straight time were acceptable, but those same actions during high-cost overtime 
were considered sketchy. This cultural rule stayed with him for years to come. To the 
gray-headed engineers, overtime paid at a time and a half rate didn’t include what was 
seen as nonproductive activity, even though it was.
Sometimes cultural self-awareness isn’t left to be discovered; sometimes it’s told 
to you explicitly and directly. In the United States Congress (a hidden cultural insti￾tution if there ever was one), one piece of advice is always given to rookie first-term 
congressional members: “Go along to get along.” This means adopt the party lead￾ers’ beliefs and positions and become a loyal party member, voting for your leaders’ 
policies even if it runs against what you promised your constituents back home. The 
same is true where you work. And a common cultural example that cuts both ways 
is the quid pro quo.
9.5 THE QUID PRO QUO
An early concept you’ll encounter in the informal organization is the quid pro quo. 
The quid pro quo is a Latin phrase literally meaning “what for what” or “something 
for something,” more commonly seen as a favor or advantage granted in return for 
something of roughly equal worth at a future time. It’s an exchange of value between 
two individuals, parties, or organizations.
The quid pro quo is a staple of the informal organization. It is invariably covert 
and may be used immediately or separated by time and place. And while a quid pro 
quo is (on the surface) an exchange of value over time, it’s real worth is that of an 
investment in a person or group; the development of rapport that becomes the basis 
for an ongoing relationship. This is particularly important in what’s called building 
capital, which is a stockpile of a stockpile of favors done for another person, to be 
redeemed at a future time (sometimes called a “chit”). There is no way someone will 
not need the benefit that the quid pro quo provides. A technician solving an unfore￾seen circuitry problem, a graphic artist shifting your job to the head of the queue, or Searching for the Hidden Organization 251
the all-important IT helpdesk expert who can resurrect your laptop from the dead. 
Your success depends on building and spending the capital the quid pro quo provides.
9.6 SOCIAL RITES AND CEREMONIALS
Social rites and ceremonials are very important components of the corporate culture, 
lending strength and viability to a given organization. At its core, a social rite or 
ceremonial is a public expression of an organization’s culture. According to Trice 
and Beyer, a social rite “amalgamates a number of discrete cultural forms into an 
integrated, unified public performance; a ceremonial connects several rites into a 
single occasion or event.”14
Rites and ceremonials combine different forms of cultural expression within 
group events, with well-defined beginnings and endings. In them, people use certain 
cultural markers: customary language, gestures, ritualized behaviors, artifacts, and 
impressive settings to emphasize these shared experiences and values. As mentioned 
above, often these values are shared through myths, sagas, legends, or other stories 
associated with the occasion. Sometimes, these events can even demonstrate certain 
irrational or unproductive behaviors that are actually functional and appropriate for 
some members of the organization.
You will find there are a surprising number of organizational rites and ceremoni￾als routinely expressed in your new engineering group. Table 9.2 summarizes some 
of these common events and experiences you will undoubtedly witness firsthand.
TABLE 9.2

CASE EXAMPLE 9.2 INTRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL IPHONE
An outstanding example of a dual enhancement and integration rite occurred 
during the legendary 2007 corporate launch of the original Apple iPhone. 
This presentation, given by Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs, introduced the 
then-revolutionary idea of a single device combining a mobile phone, a digital 
music system, and internet access device, all packaged inside a minimalist 
design with a scrolling screen. This presentation has been repeatedly analyzed 
for its effectiveness, most notably by Nancy Duarte, author of Slide:ology: 
The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations.
15 While the presenta￾tion delivery aspect is the most discussed, there is another message embedded 
in the presentation that truly gives it power. In it, Jobs repeatedly (and not so 
subtly) communicates to the crowd of faithful Mac developers the cultural 
message that they are the very special individuals: the smartest people around, 
working on the world’s most advanced and disruptive technology that is 
changing human history while simultaneously defining what is “digital cool.” 
Over and over, as he describes the function of this groundbreaking device, he 
reminds his audience (or perhaps more accurately, his “fans”) that they are part 
of a unique and special organization and more importantly, are practitioners of 
a new way of thinking and being. The presentation is pure enhancement and 
integration, and well worth looking up on YouTube. Look for the cultural refer￾ences: not in the product, but from the implied description of Apple.
9.7 THE POWER OF MYTH: THE FOUNDERS’ STORY AND OTHERS
One of the most interesting cultural experiences you will witness has to do with “the 
power of myth”: the impact of storytelling on a firm’s culture. You may not think that 
storytelling has much place in an engineering organization, yet once sensitized you 
will see it nearly everywhere. Within just a few weeks of arrival, you will undoubt￾edly be exposed to various stories: some true, some not so much, and some merely 
exaggerations of prior events. These are the history of the organization, things that 
have happened to its members; always engaging and sometimes even funny. These 
tales give your organization its unique flavor and local rules for understanding and 
action. You will hear anecdotes that indirectly define the values of the group; the 
correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to your colleagues.
The fundamental corporate myth or story is a classic: nearly all engineering orga￾nizations tend to use the “founders’ story” as a cultural indicator. These stories are 
carefully crafted parables that quickly become identified with the root of the firm’s 
identity, purpose, and reason for being. They are also useful in large corporations 
to “humanize” their identity and are employed by corporate public relations depart￾ments to craft a belief of heroic (or perhaps just smart and well-meaning) employees 
trying to make the world a better place. We all know the famous story of the tele￾phone inventor Alexander Graham Bell saying to his assistant: “Mr. Watson – come Searching for the Hidden Organization 253
here – I want you.” The Bell Telephone Company and its many, many descendants 
have used that story to great advantage for decades.
Another familiar example regards the Hewlett Packard (HP) Garage, the found￾ing location of the HP company. Here’s what HP says about their garage:
Tucked away on a quiet, tree-lined residential street near Stanford University, the HP 
Garage stands today as the enduring symbol of innovation and the entrepreneurial 
spirit. It was in this humble 12x18-foot building that college friends Bill Hewlett and 
Dave Packard first pursued the dream of a company of their own. Guided by an unwav￾ering desire to develop innovative and useful products, the two men went on to blaze a 
trail at the forefront of the electronics revolution.16
Marketing professionals even have a name for all this: grand storytelling. And for any 
entrepreneurs you may know, the web has dozens of easy-to-find articles telling them 
how to craft their own unique and engaging founder story to propel their brand forward.
The sheer number of founders’ stories shows us just how effective these tales are 
in setting and maintaining a corporate culture. And from these stories can come your 
and your colleagues’ ongoing behaviors and beliefs.
9.8 THE DYNAMICS OF CULTURE
While the founders’ story implies the organization’s culture is static and fixed in the 
past, in reality, culture is dynamic, and changing at an accelerating pace. Like an 
evolving organism, the informal organization continually morphs as new products 
are created, fresh methods are developed, and recent employees bring new experi￾ences from the ever-changing external environment.
Let’s consider the story of Marsha Fleming, an engineering analyst taking a rou￾tine business trip from Boston to St. Louis. One day Marsha’s colleague John was 
in the snack room, looking for a Snickers bar when his coworker Darshan comes in. 
Darshan immediately says to John:
Darshan: “John, did you hear about Marsha’s business trip yesterday? Unbelievable!”
John: “No, what happened?
Darshan: “Marsha was flying to St. Louis, and you know that big ice storm we had 
yesterday? Well, on takeoff Marsha’s plane slid off the end of the runway. 
Thank God no one was hurt, but they had to take everyone off the plane 
on those rubber slides and close the airport. It’s so lucky that Marsha 
didn't get hurt or anything worse.”
“Now, here’s the amazing part. Marsha went right back to the termi￾nal, marched up to the counter, and immediately booked another flight to 
St. Louis for later that day. And she got on that next flight and flew right 
into St. Louis. I would never do that!”
John: “You're right, that is amazing! I wouldn't do it, either.”
The next day Ahmed, Marsha’s boss admiringly tells the same story during a 
weekly group meeting, citing Marsha’s “get it done” attitude and perceived bravery. 254 Navigating the Engineering Organization
The message is clear: management admired Marsha for placing her work above her 
personal concerns. That story was repeated for years afterwards, and a new cultural 
norm was born. The message? You, too, will be admired if you go the extra mile for 
the company, especially in some unusual way.
9.9 RESPECT THE COLLECTIVE
Tony Phillipson is a talented engineer with about 15 years’ experience. He has been 
with his engineering firm through the tough times, when money was tight and there 
was barely enough cash to cover the payroll, let alone “frivolous” items like office 
improvements. For his entire career he had been working at a desk with a file cabinet 
that was bought during the mid-1960s, while Lyndon Johnson was the U.S. president 
and international phone calls had to be reserved in advance with the phone company. 
The company conference rooms had not been renovated since the late 1970s and 
lacked the basic amenities like projectors, speakerphones, and chairs without springs 
tearing your pants.
Tony was delighted when the company finally renovated his building’s office 
space. His department’s conference room was now a dream: new chairs in bright 
colors, broadband videoconferencing capability, and variable lighting. In the middle 
of the room was a beautiful conference table made from light oak and large enough 
to seat 12 people in comfort and style. Tony and his entire department agreed: the 
room was a knockout.
Soon after the renovation was complete, Tony went to the room to prepare the 
communications equipment for an upcoming meeting. Tony opened the door and 
was astonished: sitting cross-legged on the table, texting, was a new engineer, and 
judging by the condition of his beard, perhaps 24 years old. Not in a seat, but actu￾ally sitting on the table, dirty sneakers and all.
Tony was stunned but quickly became furious. Actually yelling at the engineer, 
Tony delivered a quick lesson in respecting the culture:
What are you doing on that table? Don’t you know that’s brand-new? We haven’t had 
a new conference table in here for probably 50 years and you’re sitting on it with your 
dirty shoes. People work in here and sometimes eat lunch at that table. This isn’t in 
your dorm room and it’s certainly not your buddy’s apartment. Get the hell off that 
table and don’t you ever do that again. Get outta here.
The young engineer didn’t need to be told twice. As Tony tells it, the engineer disap￾peared from view faster than lightning. So, what happened next? Tony repeated this 
“can you believe it?” story to anyone he ran across, including those at staff meetings, 
design reviews and especially in hallway conversations. The guilty party became 
the object of rolled eyes and whispered comments, and certainly the story got back 
to him. The lesson is clear: discover and respect the culture that others before you 
have provided. Remember, to Tony, the young man not only disrespected his current 
workmates, but also everyone who had come before him. With culture, it’s not only 
about today: the past is still alive and relevant.Searching for the Hidden Organization 255
A favorite description of respecting the collective was from Peggy Noonan’s book 
What I Saw at the Revolution, about her time as a speechwriter for U.S. Presidents 
Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. In it, Noonan perfectly describes the special 
collective culture of the White House staff when traveling on Air Force One:
I was going to go on Air Force One with the president of the United States to the 
University of Alabama, where he would give the stump speech to thousands of ador￾ing students. I was so excited I dressed nicely, with an expensive sweater and a truly 
adult Norma Kamali black linen skirt, and I resolved to keep a friendly, open adult 
face on.
We rode in limousines from the White House to the airfield. We rode right up to 
the plane. I said my name to a military aide who …. checked off names as we jogged 
with just the right amount of casual energy up the stairs. At the top I turned to see what 
the president sees when he stands and waves …. and turned into the coolness of Air 
Force One. There it was: the West Wing hum. And the West Wing aroma, flowers on 
the airplane.
There was a name on each seat. There was no boisterousness, no loud talk. … I 
was too excited to read but I didn't want to look that way so I read the Times. People 
walked by. A steward. ‘Would you like anything, ma’am?’ Yah (with a yawn), think I’ll 
take some coffee. (This isn’t my first time here.) I …. looked around in a bored fashion. 
Intense men in suits.
The famous smooth takeoff was smooth. Air Force One macho: No one wore seat 
belts. I unbuckled mine. Soon we were above the clouds and the president walked back 
to say hello. … this morning he wore his suit and walked from chair to chair. Ken 
reminded him who I was, and the president said of course of course and talked about 
the day ahead.
Outside we scrambled for cars. … when you travel with a president, you get a little 
booklet that tells you not only what car you’re assigned to but who is in it with you, and 
as soon as people get it they read it to see if they’re being treated with respect.
Back to the plane …. This time I saw that everyone was sitting in his own separate 
seat doing his own separate work, all of them together but really apart. They did not 
speak with comfort and familiarity to each other. I didn’t feel I belonged. Now I won￾der, did anyone?
I remember Margaret Tutweiler, an aide to James Baker, knitting in the seat in front 
of me and saying to Senator Strom Thurmond as he boarded as a guest, “Senduh, you 
just sit right down here next to me and we'll catch up.” She belonged, or must have felt 
she did.17
Notice that almost every scene of the trip had its own little cultural twist, with the 
travelers all observing the West Wing culture, showing their respect when traveling 
within this special community. Even though they were not really part of the group, 
they made sure to follow the culture anyway.
One last example of respecting the existing culture had to do with Amad Jamal, 
an 18-year veteran process engineer in an 80-year-old company named Brookdale, 
which specialized in manufacturing and packaging processed vegetables. Brookdale 
was rapidly moving into manufacturing plant-based meats, a major innovation cer￾tain to disrupt the food processing business. Amad’s processing plant was being 
converted to support this new direction by installing two new continuous flow 256 Navigating the Engineering Organization
manufacturing lines, each to produce ground “beef” patties at a rate of over 1,600 
per hour. Each line was estimated to cost $8.7 million, complete.
A notable feature of each line was a very large compressed nitrogen tank, some 
38 feet high and 12 feet across. This tank provided critical pressure to quickly move 
the processed vegetable slurry into the patty extrusion machine. Each tank was cast 
steel and, due to its massive size, dominated the production line.
Amad was assigned total responsibility for installing one of two new lines. 
Assigned to lead the second line installation was a relatively new process engineer 
named Chuck Gregory. With just two years’ experience, this would be Chuck’s first 
installation. Though never said out loud, the installation would become a small com￾petition between the “old dog” and the “young turk.”
Both installations went well, with no job-stoppers or surprises, until the very 
end. With one day to go until their senior management was to visit and celebrate 
the new installations, Amad quietly told his crew to paint their compressor in a 
rich, gloss blue (Hawthorne’s corporate color) and add a large company logo to the 
tank’s side.
The next morning, Chuck arrived at the site and was horrified: Amad’s installa￾tion was beautiful; clean, and professional. Chuck’s installation looked like it wasn’t 
finished; dull and grimy. It was instantly apparent whose installation was perceived 
as better, even though from a functional viewpoint each was absolutely equal. Both 
engineers were congratulated by their seniors, but most people present noticed a bit 
more warmth shown to Amad.
Amad knew his culture. He knew at Brookdale, all things being equal, excellent 
building and hardware appearance was seen as professional, demonstrating the extra 
effort supporting the company’s desire to be the best. And a mere coat of paint made 
a huge difference.
A postscript. After the ceremony was over, Amad (with the smallest of grins on 
his face), offered Chuck his crew to help paint the unfinished tank.
Chuck accepted.
9.10 SUBCULTURES
As the name implies, subcultures are smaller, different cultures embedded within 
a larger organization’s society. A subculture reflects the common problems, goals, 
and experiences that members of a team, department, or other small unit share that 
are different from the firm’s culture as a whole. A subculture can successfully exist 
within a larger culture, even when the subculture holds conflicting values that can 
create inconsistent behavior as long as there is complete consensus on both cultures’ 
underlying assumptions.
Let’s discuss an example. A subculture exhibiting inconsistent subcultural behav￾ior is the U.S. Navy Blue Angels flight demonstration team. The Blue Angels have, 
for decades, demonstrated excellence in formation flying of high-performance air￾craft. The seven members of the team, drawn from existing fighter aircraft squadrons 
and rotated every two years, are a highly trained, small group-based organization 
consisting of the best pilots and crews the Navy has to offer.Searching for the Hidden Organization 257
As fighter pilots, you would expect this team to exhibit the behaviors and values 
of the stereotypical “Top Gun” fighter pilot: highly competitive, aggressive, rule￾breaking Type A personalities on steroids. Yet if you look in-depth into the training 
of Blue Angels members, you’ll see some unusual group dynamics and behaviors. 
One of the most interesting is the daily “séance,” where each morning the entire 
team practices their demonstration at a conference table with their eyes closed, visu￾alizing the speed and position of their aircraft relative to their teammates. Their right 
hand moves an invisible control stick while their left hand operates a nonexistent 
throttle. Watching these highly skilled pilots practice in an almost trancelike state is 
the antithesis of what we might think of as the typical supersonic warrior.
Another strong subculture is their heavy reliance on the After Action Review, 
as mentioned earlier. After each flight, every pilot performs a highly self-critical 
admission of each error they made in the exercise, followed by another hard-nosed 
evaluation by all the other members. This includes the team commander. And at the 
end of each individual self-examination, every pilot makes the same statement to the 
others: “I promise to correct my errors, and I am happy to be here.”
This subculture, exhibited by a high-profile group with a very unusual and danger￾ous job, developed out of necessity. With potential death resulting from any mistake 
or miscommunication, the team uses any and all techniques they deem appropriate 
to avoid disaster. And if that involves daily, Zen-like training sessions, that’s fine.
9.11 THE STUBBORNNESS OF CORPORATE CULTURE
Most long-established legacy companies eventually build up within their cultures 
a calcified view of themselves. Tending to focus on a successful past rather than an 
uncertain future, middle management develops a reluctance to embrace the chang￾ing external environment, preferring to enjoy the substantial perks of a past success. 
This spawns the organizational condition called layers of clay.
Layers of clay are a hidden cultural condition where those who have benefited 
from a past culture will actively erect barriers to establishing a new, required future 
culture.
Here’s how it works. Think of an organization as a structure made up of three 
major layers: the very top layer where senior management lives, the very bottom 
where the rank-and-file workers reside, and an intermediate layer populated by mid￾dle and slightly higher management types. Say a major change to the company’s 
product offerings is needed due to a surprise change in the external environment. 
As senior management is directly charged with ensuring the continued existence of 
the firm, they create and earnestly endorse the company’s new direction. The firm’s 
bottom rank-and-file population is open to this change, as they know declining sales 
mean layoffs and pay cuts. Supporting the new direction contains both an explicit 
and implicit promise of a better future for them.
The intermediate layer is a problem. As middle management, they have reached 
a moderate level of financial success, power, and influence. They may have just built 
a new home, bought that boat they’ve always wanted, or just completed their chil￾dren’s college savings accounts. To them, the status quo is very, very important. The 258 Navigating the Engineering Organization
reference to clay indicates their level can be exceedingly hard to penetrate. Without 
the support of the intermediate layer, executing an actual change becomes a signifi￾cant challenge. At its core, senior management creates and directs a change, the bot￾tom layer supports, but the mid-level attempts to stop the change because their “ox is 
getting gored.” Only in a severe crisis does this resistance break down.
The idea of layers of clay can help answer the question “Why doesn’t change 
within an organization happen quickly or doesn’t even occur at all?” Logically 
and rationally, anything that is good for the organization and the people within it 
should be a no-brainer, it should happen promptly and without much discussion. 
Unfortunately, this is not a universal rule.
However, there is good news about the impact of layers of clay on an organization. 
Senior management and almost all of the rank-and-file know this exists and will do 
their best to reduce this layer. Fortunately, as we move through the third decade of 
the 21st century, the resistance to change is slowly fading as a younger generation of 
engineers achieves middle management rank. Time will eventually wash this layer of 
clay away, opening the way for a new culture to support the new business direction.
9.12 WHOSE CULTURE IS IT, ANYWAY?
Let’s now look at the hidden organization from a different vantage point. Many large 
engineering corporations are multinational; spanning continents in pursuit of both 
market share and the talent necessary to gain it. Depending upon the type of orga￾nization structure, various countries will host local company facilities supporting 
research and development, production, tier-one suppliers, product development, and 
untold other groups required to conduct business in that country. On balance, it’s 
very beneficial to have these “outposts,” bringing the company closer to local cus￾tomers and their needs. But a sticky situation emerges when we talk about corpo￾rate culture in these locations. In general, there will be two groups of employees: 
local workers from the host country and the expatriate employees, those individuals 
from the firm’s headquarters country temporarily living there, from one to five years 
being typical. Which culture will be exhibited in the host facilities? What norms and 
expected behaviors will you see at these remote locations? Should these facilities 
follow local customs or attempt to emulate the headquarters culture?
The fact is, there is no universal answer: once again contingency theory raises 
its head. If an employee is in a foreign location, they will need to be on the lookout 
for a local solution to any cultural issue. In general, culture will default to a mix of 
lower-level, local cultural behaviors but also honor certain overarching, large cul￾tural behaviors specified by the mothership. For instance, an overseas facility may 
require all employees (including executives) to remove the trash from their own work 
area each night (a local cultural behavior), yet senior management review meetings 
at that same location must conform to the headquarters pro forma and rules of pre￾sentation. Expatriate management is normally aware of and sensitive to these local 
cultural issues, but sometimes they are not.
A few years ago, a quintessential American multinational elevated a Lebanese￾Australian executive to be the new CEO of the company. This company’s identity Searching for the Hidden Organization 259
was steeped in the American tradition. To many of its customers, its brand name was 
synonymous with America and what it stands for.
This new CEO made a telling cultural error from the get-go. Soon after taking 
charge, an email from the CEO’s office was sent to each employee, stating that effec￾tive immediately, British language spellings were to be used on all company docu￾ments. This meant “color” was now “colour,” “ton” was now “tonne,” and “labor” 
was now “labour.” Even the CEO’s first name (previously spelled and pronounced 
“Jack”) was now to be “Jacques.” Obviously, the new European slant put the com￾pany’s American workers into a bad humour.
The importance of this example was not in the pettiness of the directive but was 
seen as an attempt to reduce the identity and strength of the foundational culture, and 
was a preview of what was to come under the new regime. Immediately, Jacques lost 
much-needed goodwill from the North American employees of the company, not a 
good way to start. His errors only multiplied from there, and he had no reserve of 
goodwill to absorb his rookie mistakes. Finally, Jacques was ousted 34 months into 
his tenure as CEO and replaced with the great-grandson of the company’s founder, a 
move as American as you can get.
You probably shouldn’t be surprised when an organizational subculture pops up 
when you don’t expect it. An interesting experience occurred when I was working as 
a design engineer on the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B fighter. The schedule to complete 
the design phase was (as always) tight, and the design team was put on a standard 
54-hour workweek (10 hours per day Monday through Thursday, 8 hours per day on 
Friday, and 6 hours each Saturday). After a solid year of this, company management 
announced that, to reduce burnout and improve productivity, every fourth Saturday 
would be a mandatory day off.
Several years later, I was taking an evening class on manufacturing practices when 
the topic of work schedules came up. I shared my experience about the mandatory fourth 
Saturday off. To my surprise, a fellow student with a military bearing (brush cut and tie 
inserted between the 2nd and 3rd buttons of his epaulette shirt) turned and told me that 
anyone who needed a fourth Saturday off “obviously wasn’t tough enough.”
I stopped in mid-sentence, not sure what I just heard. Not until I thought a bit did 
I realize this was a classic subcultural example. This student was what we called a 
“plant rat,” a manufacturing employee who has a strong personal pride in their com￾mitment to work long hours at their job. You can identify this type by many clues, 
such as when they refer to “getting the product out” or “good SPC numbers” or 
especially “in control.” While others might prefer to spend their non-working hours 
outdoors or with family and friends, the subculture of the plant rats’ work ethic can 
be strong and compelling, and they own the culture with pride.
9.13 IN PURSUIT OF CULTURE
At this point, we know that cultures exist, that all are different depending on the 
company in question, and at first, almost all cultures and subcultures are invisible to 
you. We also know that new employees should try to integrate with the culture as fast 
as they possibly can, even if it may not make sense at that moment. There are many 260 Navigating the Engineering Organization
ways of quickly integrating, including the obvious artifacts (style or ways of dress, 
language, etc.) and the more hidden markers (behavior patterns and expectations).
Obviously, a good first place to look for your group’s culture is when you are 
completing any task or assignment involving several people from your unit. Analyze 
their activity. For example, in larger meetings, seemingly small things (such as seat￾ing position) can influence how a meeting proceeds and how people interact. Let’s 
take an old-school example that you might think no longer applies. Consider a for￾mal, planned meeting around a U-shaped conference table. Traditionally, the rank￾ing member will tend to take the position at the bottom of the U. Other participants 
will spread out on either side of the ranking member using both sides of the table. 
The lowest members will sit at the top of the U, and any overrun will take seats 
against the wall on either side. This simple matter of seating shows the explicit and 
implicit hierarchy of the group; you can identify the ranking member easily. If you 
suspect this is old-school behavior that isn’t relevant today, now consider this: let’s 
say your director asks everyone to meet outside on the lawn by a big oak tree. Who 
gets to lean back against the tree, who sits in the shade, and who sits in the hot sun? A 
good bet is the ranking member leans against the tree: the seating position hierarchy 
still exists. And now think about a Zoom, WebEx, or other virtual meeting. Who 
gets their “picture box” placed at the top of the screen? Is anyone’s box bigger than 
the rest? Who gets to black out their video? Who’s microphone always stays on while 
everyone else is muted? The point here is that no matter the surface technique used 
in a group interaction (a conference room, tree, or virtual), there is still a need for the 
participants to implicitly identify the power structure.
Corporate culture expressed through dress has been talked in every “how to” 
article since the mid-1950s, with the rise of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.
18
Other than the comparison of a group’s dress discussed earlier in this chapter, I’ll 
just add two additional points:
1) Believe it or not, dress is always important. As mentioned earlier, it’s important 
to know that every group adheres to the same consistency of dress; everyone 
uses dress to signify they are part of a particular group. Their cultural identity 
with the group is the key point, no matter the style of dress.
2) Don’t wear a costume.
A point you’ll hear constantly repeated is to make friends with people who can help 
you. There is always an invisible communication network present in your group and 
department: it is informal, private, and valuable. Do not mistake a company website 
or a formal, new employee communication network as all the information you need. 
The good stuff doesn’t reside there; it’s inside people’s heads. And that means tap￾ping into the hidden culture within your group and department. This means drinking 
a Monster at someone’s office or workstation can be very valuable time spent.
In a different realm, it’s better than even odds that the subculture already in place 
will require you to “pay your dues,” which is the idea that you must invest in the 
group before appropriate membership will be granted to you. Dues is not education; 
it is actual work and a real demonstration of commitment and investment in your Searching for the Hidden Organization 261
colleagues. In some engineering subcultures or jobs, the “new one” will be kidded or 
picked on by older, more experienced coworkers. This is not necessarily a bad sign. 
It may be the normal part of the dues-paying process. You will find out soon enough.
9.14 REALIZATIONS
There is a lot of “soft” information in this chapter, and because contingency the￾ory is so strong, distilling culture down into a few pithy “do and don’t” checklist 
items is doomed to failure. Instead, let’s briefly review the main ideas of what we’ve 
discovered.
First, an engineering company is a social organization, an entity made up of engi￾neers who must work together. The company mirrors the values of its founders, own￾ers, and hired managers, and the resulting corporate culture is a composite reflection 
of the values of its inhabitants. It has a founding story, but that story also changes 
over time. And one of the responsibilities of senior management is to ensure that 
culture changes in an appropriate and positive manner in response to a changing 
environment.
For success, it is essential to understand how a company’s culture relates to its 
employees and the outside world. Recognizing the existing culture is important from 
the standpoint of its breath and most importantly, it’s strength. And yes, that strength 
can cause you to be hypnotized by the existing culture.
Your company, department, or group culture has an importance far beyond what 
one might think. There is an old saying that “culture eats strategy for breakfast,” 
meaning the impact of the current culture can be more powerful than an organiza￾tion’s strategy and plans. There is some truth in this.
A professional has a good understanding of the informal organization in which 
they reside. They understand its power and honor its place in the company’s envi￾ronment. They work within it, and only in the rare instances where the culture is 
negative, destructive, or illegal do they knowingly negate the culture, usually by self￾selecting out. Professionals are not frightened by culture, nor are they subject to the 
temptation of being subsumed by it. They see culture can enrich their work life and 
even act as a teaching tool. The more experience they have, the better their ability to 
use the culture positively. And they respect the culture’s strength, and unlike Laura 
Kendric, know that the informal organization can damage them deeply.
Finally, subcultures give “running room” for smaller groups to establish custom￾ized cultures that enhance the local group’s performance and success. Subcultures 
should be allowed to prosper and grow under the protection of the main culture. 
While your firm has its culture, you will spend essentially all your time in your sub￾culture. Learn it well.

10 Ubiquitous 
Communication
10.1 ORGANIZATIONAL COMMUNICATION: 
IT’S NOTHING PERSONAL
Ask any engineering manager, director, or other executive what the most valued 
organizational talent is, and they will probably give you one word: communica￾tion. Communication is a skill, not a science. Articles and books galore talk 
about communication: your personal communication, communication between 
groups, high fidelity communication, communicating with technology, commu￾nicating without technology, and on and on. An entire army of communication 
consultants, presentation gurus, and management experts all promise they have 
the secret to good communication. The IABC (the International Association 
of Business Communicators) has thousands of members in over 100 chapters 
in North America alone. And for good reason. Communication is “sticky.” It’s 
the glue that holds an organization together, a cement that sticks to everything. 
Technical divisions, departments, groups, and individuals all depend on commu￾nication to effectively and efficiently get something done. Exchanging informa￾tion through communication is how it’s accomplished.
Multi-modal communication is critical in all organizations: big or small, old or 
new, complex or simple. Communication conveys information, and organizations 
use information strategically to make sense of ongoing changes in its environment, 
acquire new knowledge for future innovation creation and make decisions about 
future courses of action.1
Communication in firms is not defined by you or other individuals; it is defined 
and governed by the organization itself. The organization instructs you as an indi￾vidual engineer how to communicate, not the reverse. There are rules and boundar￾ies, conditions and contingencies that govern organizational communications, and 
everyone must get to know them.
Looking again at the entire Essential Engineering Framework (Figure 10.1), the 
Inner Core shows the communication component as the entity holding the four other 
components together. Here, communication binds these four entities tightly together. 
A technical organization needs this construct to create and support an integrated, 
holistic information transfer system. Without this cement, the Inner Core collapses. 
This is the nature of organizational communication and why we will spend some 
substantial time on it.
It’s only right to emphasize this communication. After all, communication, be it 
written, spoken, presented, texted, emailed (or merely whispered in the hallway), is 
Navigating the Engineering Organization Ubiquitous Communication
DOI: 10.1201/9781003214397-13
10.1201/9781003214397-13264 Navigating the Engineering Organization
one of the most important activities an engineer performs each day. Not only is the 
calculation or analysis of results important, but equally important is the dissemina￾tion of that knowledge. Communication is the critical enabler of the organization; 
an organization does not exist without it. With it, the group can move forward and 
deliver amazing technology; without it, the organization will fail no matter how 
astounding the actual technology or product is.
Communication is also a paradox. For something that we do hundreds of times 
per day, communication can be breathtakingly confused, unclear, mistaken or ill￾advised, or perhaps just plain wrong. It can be complex or simple, clear or chaotic, 
timely or irrelevant, passive or active. Not surprisingly, individuals communicate to 
others in ways far beyond what they think they do. Communicating is considerably 
more than speaking, or writing, or tapping on a mobile phone. Individuals communi￾cate to others with every gesture, every facial expression, the gait of their walk, and 
tone of their voice. The timing of an email and how one sits in a seat: all are part of 
ubiquitous communications. And whatever forms it takes, we can’t emphasize com￾munication enough.

Simply put, communicating correctly (meaning clear, concise, accurate, and 
memorable information transfer) is hard. A quote attributed to the Irish playwright 
George Bernard Shaw summarizes the issue:
The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.
Unfortunately, despite continuous pleas by management to “communicate well or 
often or clearly, or all three,” the reality of new engineer training has been to place 
scant emphasis on the “how” of communicating well, leaving true communication 
skill to be gained through hard-won experience in the workplace. A simple count 
of available communications courses offered at major engineering schools tells 
the tale that this skill is rarely if ever emphasized and even with communication 
training and assistance from a university engineering program, new hires begin 
their career at a deficit.
Let’s say a manager has hired two new engineers. Both are doing similar assign￾ments and the manager believes both are technically competent. It’s no surprise that 
the better communicator will be perceived as the more capable individual. In fact, 
even if one engineer’s technical answer is slightly deficient vs. the other, yet that 
engineer’s communication skills are better, the superior presenter could be seen as 
the better engineer. High-quality communication is that important.
But here comes another paradoxical situation. Experience shows there may be a 
predisposition in some engineers’ minds against strongly communicating or advo￾cating for their new technology or other work product. While personally proud of 
their work, they may feel that strong advocacy may smack of “salesmanship” which 
frequently is anathema to the technical mind. A common attitude is “My inven￾tion (or innovation or design or work product) is so good, it speaks for itself.” No, 
your invention is deaf and dumb. You must advocate for it through communication 
because no one else will.
So, in this chapter, we talk a lot about communication. Not as a cookie-cutter, 
checklist-driven guide to communication theory, nor as an attempt to replicate all 
those communication books mentioned earlier. Rather, we’ll talk a little bit about 
a communications framework and then discuss the common “holes” in organiza￾tional information transfer that are generally missed: those messaging exchanges 
and usages you will encounter every day.
With that said, let’s get a better handle on this whole notion of communication.
10.2 COMMUNICATING IN ENGINEERING ORGANIZATIONS: 
DEFINITIONS, MODELS, AND DESIGNS
Five minutes on Google is enough to convince you that once again, the definition of 
communication is strictly governed by contingency theory. Dozens of definitions are 
offered: the number of communication types and ways of organizing and structuring 
communication can be scores or more. The first conclusion you may reach is that the 
study of communication is really a minestrone soup, with too many chefs contribut￾ing too many “special” ingredients to the pot.266 Navigating the Engineering Organization
10.2.1  A Working Definition
With so many definitions to choose from (meaning, of course, there is no single, 
agreed-upon definition of communication at all), let’s just avoid attempting a “for￾mal” definition of organizational information transfer and instead create a definition 
that makes sense within the context of this book. And rather than force you to read 
a number of definitions only to be told what’s wrong with them, let’s just agree that 
our definition is this:
Communication involves the transfer of an idea from one mind to another. The com￾municative process consists of a sender, a message, a medium, and a receiver. First, 
the sender carefully selects the symbols (usually words) that form the message. Then, 
the sender must determine which method, or medium, of sending the message will 
work best. The receiver hears or reads the message and makes an interpretation. If the 
receiver’s interpretation matches the sender’s intended meaning, true communication 
has occurred.2
This is a good, simple, and accurate definition. But what about the next step, estab￾lishing a model that describes the basic communication process? The answer comes 
from Corey and Pierce in their Transactional Model, shown in Figure 10.2.
The transactional model is the most robust of the common communication mod￾els. For example, people are not labeled as “senders” or “receivers” of messages in 
this model but as communicators, implying that communication is achieved when 
people both send and receive messages nearly simultaneously. Corey and Pierce 
advocate that communication is a cooperative action in which the communicators

actually create the process, outcome, and effectiveness of the interaction. They con￾tend people create shared meaning in a more dynamic process in this transactional 
model.3
This model is good, but the simple processes implied in it are much more com￾plex in practice than first imagined. In an ideal world, the message is clear, and the 
medium is optimum; one commutator’s part of the process is successful, and if well￾executed, the other communicator should be able to clearly interpret the intended 
meaning. Of course, this rarely happens.
10.2.2  Designing a Communication System
This definition and model are helpful, but now let’s use them to create an engineering 
communication system. In daily use, there are really only two ways of how to com￾municate: spoken (through speech and hearing) and written (through vision). Both 
are underpinned by language and thinking. Yet when it comes to how we actually 
execute the communication, we find ourselves in a thicket of endless methods and 
techniques. So let’s make it simple. Let’s use the transactional model to maximize 
the potential for a holistic and successful engineering communication by using this 
model to design a technical communication system. Let’s examine the steps in this 
design process.
Emphasis Area
The first step in designing a successful communication is to establish the emphasis 
area the communication will use. An emphasis area is the major way a communi￾cation will be transmitted. It parses the proposed communication by the way the 
information transfer can occur, recognizing that communication has the best chance 
of being successful by stressing one of these emphasis areas. Researchers such as 
Corey and Pierce contend that all organizational communication falls into one of 
five emphasis areas:
1) By Communicator: Here, communication methods and techniques are 
based on the number of people involved in the information exchange. This 
is usually described as pairings: individual to individual, group to group, 
individual to group, group to enterprise, etc. This results in the communi￾cation system being designed around serving the needs of any number of 
participants.
2) By Efficiency: An approach where the best pathway of a message is designed 
and optimized to ensure minimum loss of signal, maximum understanding, 
and best efficiency of the transmission. Note we are not talking exclusively 
about electronic or digital transmission technologies here, but instead the 
complete pathway traversed by a given message. For example, an efficiency 
approach could be described as an optium design “from brain to voice to a 
chosen transfer medium to ear to brain.”
3) By Psychology of Understanding: Here, the prime concern is the quality 
of understanding of a message in the context of the sender’s and recipient’s 268 Navigating the Engineering Organization
feelings and mental filters. The reality that the meaning of a message by 
different individuals or groups is highly contingent on the prior understand￾ings, experiences, and expectations of either the sending or receiving par￾ties or both.
4) By Method of Transmission: Some communications are organized by the 
method of communication chosen (verbal, written, listening, visual, etc.). 
This method is surprisingly common, perhaps as it is straightforward, sim￾ple to apply, and avoids the more complex and uncertain aspects of psychol￾ogy and drives more toward maximum efficiency.
5) By Menu: Simply put, this is an approach to communication where solu￾tions to different aspects of the communication problem are selected from 
several of the previously listed techniques. Highly flexible and satisfying, 
this menu approach presents a quick, plausible method of designing a holis￾tically successful message. It fits well with contingency theory. For these 
reasons, the menu tends to be selected as the most preferred process for 
quality communication.
Opportunity for Message Transfer
The next step focuses on the communication opportunity. A communication oppor￾tunity is defined as an information transfer event or occasion; an opening or chance 
to execute the transfer; the time and place a given communication can occur. It is a 
contingent approach in that the exact method to best communicate depends on the 
location, time, and environment of its transmission. It is predicated on the belief that 
no communication can be successfully accomplished unless an appropriate opportu￾nity is presented. Table 10.1 summarizes this stage.
There are seven main opportunities: in traditional meetings, in 1:1 meetings, 
through traditional discussions, in hallways or elevators, auditorium presentations, 
and written communications. Each opportunity has many execution conditions: 
planned or “snap” (i.e., instantaneous), formal or informal, with prepared material, 
or ad hoc. Each opportunity (hopefully) has an appropriate duration to complete the 
transmission and yield a successful outcome. Finally, the communicators can be sin￾gular or multiple, and the transfer venue can be any number of spaces or locations, 
including virtual.
Table 10.1 summaries how each communication opportunity has a set of char￾acteristics associated with it that can provide guidance. For example, if you need 
the best opportunity to discuss a technical analysis with a fellow engineer, the 
traditional discussion opportunity is appropriate. To discuss your career, a 1:1 is 
essential, and to brief the chief engineer on your latest test result, a hallway is good 
if the timing is urgent and the message is simple. If not, a written communication 
or presentation is appropriate. The goal is to select the message opportunity that 
best fills the need.
Information Transfer Method
The next step addresses the design’s transfer method. Since organizational commu￾nications are highly contingent, selecting the appropriate method (or methods) of Ubiquitous Communication 269 TABLE 10.1 Basic Opportunities of Organizational Communications Communication Opportunity Planned or Snap Information Transfer Formal or Informal Prepared Material or Ad Hoc Opportunity Duration Designed Outcome: Awareness/ Discussion/ Decision Receiver: Individual or Group Typical Venue Meeting Normally planned, a few are snap Both formal and informal Active contributor: Prepared Passive participant: Ad Hoc Only long enough to achieve meeting goal, “refund” unused time Any: Awareness, Discussion or Decision Group Conference Room or other enclosed, formal or semi-formal space, and/or virtual 1:1 Normally planned Normally informal Prepared is highly recommended Only long enough to achieve meeting goal, “refund” unused time All Individual Individual Office/ Small CR.

Include questions All Group Large conference room/auditorium/ virtual Written Only Planned Both Prepared Variable Awareness/ Decision Individual Anywhere and everywhere270 Navigating the Engineering Organization
information transfer involves a fair number of considerations. These contingencies 
and resulting questions include:
1) The urgency of the message: how soon must it be received?
2) The importance of the communication: what is the critically of the message 
being sent? What will happen if the message is not received?
3) The half-life of the information being communicated: how long is the infor￾mation relevant? Is the “freshness” of the information short or long?
4) The need for clarity (i.e., quality) of the communication: will it be under￾stood once received?
5) The advocacy of the message: is the message passive or active? Is it a 
one-way-only message without feedback, or is two-way communication 
required?
6) The message complexity: is the message’s content simple or convoluted? Is 
the message nuanced or straightforward?
7) The communication’s audience: is the message intended for many recipi￾ents, a few, or only one?
8) The message’s sensitivity: is the communication confidential or public 
domain? If confidential, what level of secrecy is required?
9) It’s historical requirements: can a record of the communication be easily 
obtained, either immediately or at some point in the future? Will it be meta￾data only or must content be included?
10) It’s content classification: is the communication routine (a weekly status 
report, for example), or is it a one-time special message (say, a product 
safety issue has just emerged)?
11) The message’s context pairing: is the context of the communication identi￾cal between the sender and recipient?
Analyzing these 11 requirements will help determine the best communication 
method or mode to entrust the message. Generally, you will always have several 
methods available to you, some rarely used and others quite common. A summary 
of these methods is shown in Table 10.2 and is meant to provide a starting point in 
choosing the specifics of the particular communication design you need to accom￾plish. Many of these are obvious, but some may be new.
Like other concepts, the contingency of communication is both good and bad. It 
prevents you from using a comfortable, single communication channel and just hop￾ing it works. Instead, it forces you to create a specific, customized approach for each 
situation, resulting in a hopefully optimized information movement. But it takes 
time, energy, and some experimentation to ensure it works, which is counter to the 
routine urgency your message may demand.
Let’s walk through a simple example. Say you have developed a set of techni￾cal specifications for a new high-efficiency centrifugal pump. You now need to 
transfer these specifications to a group of five engineers located in an adjoining 
department. This downstream group will access the feasibility of your specifica￾tions for a manufacturing setting and pass judgment on your work.

you are professional and competent. What is the best way to perform this informa￾tion transfer?
You think about this communication task. The specification is contained in a 
26-page PDF document with three drawings detailing the pump configuration. Two 
areas of the specification have a nuanced meaning, not easily understood from either 
the document or drawings. You do not know these five engineers.
The framework asks to first select an emphasis area; how the transfer will take 
place. The first four options all seem to have some impact on the design of the trans￾mission, but not exclusively. Therefore, option five (the menu) is a good bet.
Next, thinking about the transfer, you decide to alert the group about the two 
nuanced areas of the specification that are prone to misinterpretation. You resolve to 
speak with the group personally to highlight these potential misunderstandings, and 
you want all five engineers to equally understand the same two areas. You also desire 
an opportunity for verbal question and answers, as you are new and feel your work 
may have missed some important points.
The message transfer selection then provides you with opportunities to achieve 
your transmission requirements. From Table 10.1, a meeting, a discussion, or an audi￾torium presentation look promising. Yet the auditorium is much too formal, plus it 
does not allow many two-way question-and-answer opportunities. So, either a meet￾ing or discussion is good. Since you wish to promote two-way, sincere, and informal 
communication, the traditional discussion opportunity is your choice.
The information transfer method is easy. The communication will be multichan￾nel: a face-to-face conversation with question and answer, a discussion or summary 
file for use during the meeting, then leave a document, file, or other evidence of your 
work on a website or as a digital record. The key is to provide both a verbal and writ￾ten status as of that date.
Now here comes the most important part of this example. Remember, the real 
purpose of the meeting is to officially transfer your work for the feasibility check. 
This will probably be a formal or documented step in your firm’s engineering devel￾opment process. As such, you must keep a formal record of the transfer: that it took 
place on a certain date, that adequate documentation was provided, that it was offi￾cially accepted by the downstream group, and any other evidence that showing a 
complete review and transfer occurred, including any nonconformance items and 
their disposition. Why? Being a process step, your work is subject to review at any 
time by any outside entity. If your documentation is not complete, you are open to an 
out-of-process correction, which can be painful and a reputation killer. While you 
might believe after-the-fact documentation doesn’t matter, especially under the pres￾sure of moving on to the next assignment, you must complete all your process steps, 
and you must take the time to keep a record of the successful transfer.
There it is: a discussion in a conference room with a written file of the transfer 
material, coupled with questions and answers, including a file location or website, 
plus certification that the transfer occurred successfully. Your communication is 
complete.
This framework may seem trivial, yet it’s important new engineers learn the dis￾cipline and train to automatically use this process. It’s very true that even moderately Ubiquitous Communication 273
experienced engineers already know these steps: it is probably second nature to 
them. Your aim is to to arrive at that level of knowledge as well.
10.3 TOWARD THE GREAT DIVIDE: NAVIGATING 
THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK
At this point, let’s take stock of where we’re at. We know that organizational com￾munication is highly contingent. That a universally agreed-upon definition of com￾munication doesn’t exist, but we have a workable approximation we can build upon.
We know that technical communication must be clear and highly accurate in spite 
of the difficulties caused by the fuzzy boundaries that surround it. And there are 
dozens upon dozens of information transfer modes, methods, and paths available to 
choose from, including hybrids.
That said, let’s now examine a selection of the most common communications 
situations all engineers face in technical organizations and share some suggestions 
on how to proceed.
10.3.1 Communication Opportunities and Situations
We need to discuss in greater detail the communication opportunities introduced 
in Table 10.1. Essentially all your work-based communications will fall into one or 
more of these categories, and each category will have some noteworthy dependen￾cies we should recognize and address. We’ll discuss several of the most common 
situations, all brought on by the dictates of contingency theory.
The Meeting
A meeting is a bounded, real-time gathering of two or more people for the purpose 
of achieving a common goal through conversation and interaction. It can be formal 
or informal, planned or spontaneous. Its purpose is to achieve an outcome of aware￾ness, discussion, or decision, or some combination of these.4
The motive for your attendance in a meeting can vary, but most reasons fall into 
four bins: attaining knowledge or education around a topic, exchanging information 
or ideas with others, deciding or being part of a decision, or portions of all three.
Attaining knowledge or education is passive, involving sitting there, listening, 
and (hopefully) absorbing. Discussion is an active exchange of knowledge between 
individuals, and decisions are a conclusion or resolution reached after consideration. 
This means that for a participant, communication in meetings is all about the discus￾sion, the give and take, and the contribution you personally make to the meeting. 
How you communicate in meeting discussions is our focus.
The Formal, Planned Meeting
At this early point in your career, a planned, formal meeting is one you normally 
might not attend. If invited, your presence is as a guest; summoned to either present 
information, convey results, or add to a discussion regarding a single topic. Typically, 
the meeting participants are of a higher rank, and you probably haven’t had prior 274 Navigating the Engineering Organization
interaction or experience with them; they are as unknown to you as you are to them. 
The meeting takes place in a formal manner, with exact participant lists, written 
agendas sent to participants in advance and rigid meeting conduct rules. Probably, 
your topic is one of several to be discussed, with an exact start and finish time speci￾fied on the agenda.
As mentioned earlier, formal meetings have three different types of outcomes:
1) Awareness: Providing participants necessary information and background 
on a topic without requesting a specific discussion or action.
2) Discussion: Presenting the status of a topic to promote discussion and guid￾ance among participants without requesting a decision at that time.
3) Decision: Sharing summary information on the topic to receive necessary 
direction and take decisions.
Preparing for these occasional meetings requires unfamiliar work. When invited, 
your preparation should include the following questions. What are the meeting orga￾nizers looking for you to provide? What do you wish to accomplish? And how do 
you achieve this to create a “win-win” outcome for you, the decision-makers and the 
audience members?
The first question is easy: ask. Surprisingly, there can be reluctance to ask clari￾fying questions, as the questioner is loath to potentially look foolish or be seen as 
lacking. Don’t get caught in this trap.
Next, explicitly decide what you are trying to accomplish. What do you wish 
to gain from this opportunity? Is it experience? Visibility? Learning the con￾cerns of senior management? Survival? Whatever the reason, keep it in the front 
of your mind.
The third question is more complex. Determine what “rules” are in play. This can 
be tough, as many of these rules are not written down, and you may not even realize 
there are rules at all. Be assured there are. The meeting organizer, if you speak to 
them personally (no email or text) can give you helpful hints on what these rules are. 
Without this guidance, management may think “This person hasn’t gotten the word 
yet” and discount your participation.
One final note about formal meetings. It should be obvious, but please do not 
arrive at executive meetings late. Irrespective of the amount of espoused formal￾ity or informality in your company, in a meeting, it is still imperative that you are 
there early and ready to go the minute the executive comes in. Distracting a meeting 
already begun through a Zoom or Webex chime (or opening the conference room 
door) is an irritant and bad look.
The Informal, Routine Meeting
The routine meeting is an informal work-related gathering that is local, periodic, and 
standardized, where everyone’s attendance is expected at each session, and where 
repetitive business is discussed. Called by many other names (staff meeting, weekly 
topics meeting, team huddle, operating committee meeting, and the like), a group of 
employees gather around a table, either virtually or physically, sipping their coffee Ubiquitous Communication 275
as the boss pontificates on whatever is the topic du jour. After 30 or 60 or even 90 
minutes (always an even increment), the group disbands and then attempts to catch 
up for the 30 or 60 or 90 minutes of work time lost. Uncounted trees have been sac￾rificed by consultants sharing how to improve the outcomes and reduce the waste of 
these routine meetings, to no avail. It is by far the most common type of meeting you 
will encounter.
There’s not much to say about these meetings. They can be primarily one-way 
information transfer meetings (with perhaps some discussion thrown in) and your 
contribution is normally limited. Occasionally, you may be asked to prepare some￾thing for the group, (an unexpected test result, a piece of competitive information, 
or a process improvement), but in general, these are low-pressure, passive gather￾ings. Enjoy.
The 1:1
The 1:1 is a form of informal, planned meeting between two specific people: you and 
your boss. It’s informal in that it can take place in a variety of locations (the boss’s 
office, the building’s commons area or even over lunch at a local restaurant) and 
more of a conversation. It’s planned in that it occurs regularly, perhaps once a week. 
Its purpose is different for each person participating. For you, it’s to inform your boss 
on the status of your work, and to gain information on company or department topics 
you need to know. The boss’s purpose is somewhat different: to review the condi￾tion of your work and to judge (over time) your technical and personal qualities as a 
department employee.
The rules of this meeting depend heavily upon and are dictated by the relationship 
you have with that boss. A 1:1 between a new employee and their boss will tend to be 
more reserved, formal, and more circumspect. Obviously, a boss and engineer who 
know each other well will be more informal and easier in their conversation.
Keep in mind this is your meeting, not the boss’s. They may have scheduled it, 
but you run it. Many styles prevail; some engineers will conduct a strictly verbal 
exchange with no written notes or record kept. Others prefer drafting a simple agenda 
and providing some sort of document or file to the boss for each item as a record of 
the meeting. Either way, the style and details of these 1:1s will (and should) be at the 
boss’s preference. Independent of the particular details, the overall thrust of a 1:1 is 
to enhance your bosses’ confidence in your technical capability, their comfort with 
you as a person, and grow the trust between both of you going forward.
As mentioned previously, the 1:1 is also the corporate version of a quiz, per￾formed verbally and given weekly. These ongoing presentations to your supervisor 
are ubiquitous; it behooves you to practice these as you be giving them often.
The Traditional Discussion
Many people do not see much difference between a meeting and a discussion. After 
all, both are normally planned events, involve multiple participants, achieve a give 
and take in the form of questions and answers, and can produce outcomes ranging 
from simple awareness to major decisions. However, there are actually substantial 
differences between the two. Meetings tend to be more formal than discussions, with 276 Navigating the Engineering Organization
additional prior planning involved, increased use of formal agendas, extra upper 
management attending (perhaps managers and directors or higher), occur in for￾mal or semi-formal spaces and are more presentation-like (i.e., one-way informa￾tion transfer) in their style. Generally discussions, while planned, are informal in 
language and pattern, rarely use formal agendas, occur between working-level engi￾neers and supervisors, exclude upper management, and use relaxed or collaborative 
settings to promote free information exchange.
A major benefit of discussions that is normally lacking in meetings is establishing 
confidence and comfort with engineers in other departments and organizations neces￾sary to achieve success. And like the ultimate goal of 1:1’s, an additional idea behind 
discussions is to eventually establish trust and create a professional working relationship. 
Discussions build bridges between individuals, and thus connections to departments.
Hallways and Elevators
A hallway talk is literally that; a brief discussion between two (or no more than 
three) individuals in a public space, designed to convey information of various levels 
of importance. The author Michael Lopp in his book Managing Humans: Biting 
and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager stresses the importance 
of hallway conversations. Hallway conversations are short, informal conversations 
about the status of projects, goals and similar topics. They are great for bouncing 
ideas off people or just letting them know what you are up to. The important insight 
is the hallway is a brief conversation to gain insight, perspective or guidance. But 
please note: it is not about decision-making on any topic of importance. In fact, one 
of the major downsides of the hallway is it can be a major source of confusion and 
miscommunication.5
This situation is easy to understand. Say you are assigned to a project involving 
three other engineering groups, all led by a business office director. You see that 
director in the hallway one day and decide to ask them for a decision that you were 
going to ask the entire project team at their meeting the following week. After all, 
getting a decision now saves a week of waiting. You ask the director who, not know￾ing any better, makes a snap decision and continues to walk down the hall. Having 
a clear decision, you proceed for the next week guided by that decision, happy in 
the knowledge that you are working efficiently. Unfortunately, for that week no one 
else knows a decision has been made, and even worse, it happened to be the wrong 
decision. Without all sides of a technical issue being heard simultaneously, a bad 
decision can easily result. Meanwhile, there is now an added problem: there is a good 
chance the director forgot he or she made the decision. That’s right. With so much 
information to process, many executives’ memories are overloaded and one-minute 
conversations in a hallway are easily lost.
From this, a good approach to the hallway interaction is to use it for decisions only 
if the decision is very minor and involves matters that are 100% in your control. For 
any other situation, wave off.
One other point about the hallway you need to know. Executives use hallways as 
an effective “trolling” method to uncover the truth about what’s happening within 
their projects and overall organizations. Because the hallway is usually between two Ubiquitous Communication 277
people, not overheard by others and by their nature informal, people are willing 
(sometimes very willing) to share information with little or no filtering. This is a 
strong and important information sharing device. For example, a former Secretary of 
the U.S. Navy (an organization of some 300,000 people) believes in the rule that “the 
quality of communications and information exchange is inversely proportional to 
the formality of the meeting. Much more information is exchanged in a hallway than 
in a formal meeting room.”6 It won’t take you long to see this in action in your own 
organization. If you elect to share this way, it’s certain that your information will be 
used at the pleasure of management. But don’t forget, you may regret it.
An elevator pitch is slightly different. It is a brief (perhaps 30 to 60 seconds) epi￾sode of one-way communication. It can be a method of introducing yourself, com￾municating a key status or result, or merely making a connection with someone. 
Obviously, it’s called an elevator talk because the simile implies it’s completed in the 
time spent taking an elevator ride with someone.
Some career consultants view elevator talks as great tools to use any time you 
want to establish a network connection or meet a prospective executive looking for 
a new person to hire. That’s fine, but think of it more as rehearsal for organizational 
life in general: it’s a practice session in effective verbal communication. Whatever 
the motivation, continuously hone and update your elevator skill, as you will eventu￾ally use it.7
Auditorium Presentations
You will be called on to perform occasional auditorium-style presentations. These 
are different than meeting presentations. As Table 10.1 outlines, these are a very spe￾cific form of communication with certain common characteristics. They are almost 
always a formal, scheduled in advance, one-way “broadcast”, as a single presenter 
speaks out to many recipients for a set duration of time. Obviously, these occur in 
auditoriums but also large conference rooms, and of course can be virtual. With a 
limited (if any) opportunity for two-way question and answer, these presentations are 
tightly controlled and can be high-anxiety experiences.
Uncounted books already exist that will give you presentation guidance and tips 
for a variety of audiences. I suggest you pick one up, as it will ground you in the fun￾damentals of the all-purpose presentation. For the engineering or technical audience, 
let me share just a few suggestions specific to those individuals.
Technical talks always involve a multistep process that is easily divided into pre￾delivery, delivery, and post-delivery stages:
Predelivery
This is the thoughtful preparation used in answering some fundamental, anticipated 
questions before you even begin.
1) First, analyze your audience. Who are they? What technical level are they? 
What is their technical “language”? Why should they listen to you? What 
is your message? This may seem obvious, yet in reality, these self-directed 
questions are rarely asked, let alone answered.278 Navigating the Engineering Organization
2) Establish your logistics. Where and when will the presentation be given? 
How will it be given? What is the medium? And most importantly, is the 
technology compatible and reliable? Any experienced presenter will tell 
you over 50% of presentations fail because the laptop couldn’t talk to the 
projector, the zoom link wasn’t tested, or the remote “advance” button 
lacked a battery. Don’t ever assume someone else will handle this: they 
won’t.
3) Follow the “rule of four” in presentations that states that at most only four 
ideas can be presented at one time (in fact, only three ideas are optimal for 
a single presentation). Make it clear that you are communicating just those 
three or four ideas, and do not overload the presentation with information.
4) Develop your material using a storyboard. Veteran presenters recommend 
using a storyboard approach (a paper and pen, drawing technique) to estab￾lish a narrative “arc” to their talk. An excellent reference is the previously 
mentioned Slide:ology by Karen Duarte.
5) Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words and hardware is worth a 
thousand pictures. Consider using hardware and other hands-on exhibits 
that attendees can examine and handle before or after the talk. This is old 
school but still highly effective.
6) Borrow with pride. An early step is to search for any previously developed 
material that you may repurpose for your presentation. Not only is this effi￾cient, as being previously used and approved, but your management will 
probably expect you to use it as a timesaving move.
Delivery
This is the actual execution of your presentation. Those “how-to” books I mentioned 
earlier are your best guide for delivery, but I need to emphasize these points:
1) Maintain time discipline and take a shorter time to complete your talk than 
allotted.
2) Never, never read the talk.
3) Avoid distracting mannerisms.
4) Maintain eye contact with various members of your audience.
5) Memorize the introduction and the conclusion, but not the main body.
6) For a new presentation, practice the talk at least three times, timing yourself 
each time.
7) As I mentioned above, it is crucial that you familiarize yourself beforehand 
with your electronic aids. Physically handle the controls and personally 
verify each component is working and ready.
8) Adjust the level of technical communications to the level of the audience, 
but still keep your actual message simple and clear.
9) If practical, engage in a brief question-and-answer session.
10) Your talk should be snappy.
11) Remember, the main point in preparing a presentation is deciding what to 
leave out.Ubiquitous Communication 279
Post-delivery
Post-delivery is where additional, unexpected benefits to you can occur. You should 
plan to:
1) Continue discussions with interested persons outside the venue or at a later 
time.
2) Follow-up on actions you promised, either during the presentation or in 
discussions after the event. Be sure to actually do what you committed to 
do, otherwise, you lose credibility.
3) Analyze your talk regarding how it was received. Was your audience analy￾sis correct? Did you stay within your time budget? What did you do well, 
and what would you do differently next time? Again, this may seem obvious 
yet less than 10% of presenters actually conduct an After-Action Review 
and learn from it.
Finally, there is an old joke regarding presentations that still has relevance today:
“The ideal speech should have a grabby beginning, a powerful ending, and they should 
be very close to each other.”
The Written Opportunity
Hopefully, you have already taken a writing or prose course at university or used 
another opportunity to train in the fundamentals of good, written idea transfer. Even 
better is a technical writing class especially designed for an engineering or technical 
practitioner. Coming into a new position means having a reasonable foundation in 
technical writing already in your skills portfolio. If not, I would sincerely suggest you 
find a suitable writing class or training opportunity locally to enhance your writing 
ability: clear and concise technical writing is that important as a professional skill.
Like in the presentation section above, I am not going to cover the fundamentals 
of technical writing here, as you should already know or move to acquire them. But 
I want to cover some organization-specific points.
The first is your home organization’s or department’s standard writing expecta￾tion. Every engineering company will have an expected writing style or approach 
and a certain look and feel for their written communications, be it on paper, slide, 
email, text, website, or discussion board. This approach may be explicit, using a 
commercially available formatting and composition method (Write to the Top: 
Writing for Corporate Success was the required approach to business writing at one 
of my employers) or implicit (someone wrote a particularly clear and clean document 
that was then copied by everyone). Whatever the reality in your firm, you need to 
discover it, learn it and ultimately embrace it.8
The second is the future of the “document.” Prior to the coming of desktop com￾puting, written communications (test reports, recommendations, decisions, method￾ologies, meeting notes, and the like) were detailed on paper, with this information 
and other supporting content included, written in a form that could be archived for 280 Navigating the Engineering Organization
later historical use. Paper was king, and copies were mechanically created to fill 
endless file cabinets.
Obviously, digital communications changed all that. Initially, written documents 
maintained this paper-based form and were merely created and stored electronically. 
Then, a fundamental change occurred: engineering writing moved from Word and its 
competitors to PowerPoint-style presentation decks. Documents that might have been 
400 words per page now were reduced to bullet points containing 25 words or less. 
Written communications were pared down to essential wording only, and efficiency 
of transmission (minimum words, always in bullet form) was placed ahead of holistic 
understanding. This is essentially the nature of written technical communications today.
What matters is how you approach this reality. With documents now containing 
just scores of words vs. the hundreds previously used, you now must develop an 
organized, easy to access, personal archive of those background test methods, analy￾sis, decisions and assumptions used in creating the final deck. Again, this sounds 
trivial, yet many, many engineers experience deep trouble when asked to produce 
their development material sometime after their deck is submitted, especially when 
asked to produce the material immediately. Without a legitimate, personally main￾tained reference system, your proof of the validity of your deck will disappear like 
smoke. And it is your personal responsibility to do this.
10.3.2  Not All Ground Rules Will Be Communicated
In communication, you will encounter (with distressing regularity) surprises having 
to do with ground rules, specifically with those that are communicated to you and 
those that are not. A good assumption in company communication (and in fact in 
all aspects of company life) is that not all ground rules will be told to you. In fact, 
take as a matter of faith that very few ground rules will be purposely shared. Or, go 
for the full Monty and just assume that no ground rules will ever be actually told to 
you. Now, they may be hinted at, or mentioned in passing which you might take as 
a pleasant conversational remark but fail to realize it was meant for you. Remember, 
your workmates speak in code and the rules for you are no different. Either your 
supervisor or coworkers will think the rules are too trivial to mention explicitly, or 
they will forget to share them until after you’ve made a mistake. So, that leaves you 
to uncover these little nuggets of guidance yourself.
For example, a classic ground rule that’s mostly forgotten to be communicated has 
to do with your first business trip. When assigned to your first trip, your supervision 
may or may not share with you the nuts and bolts of the travel policy. Travel policy 
is the rules and regulations imposed by the organization that you must follow on any 
business expedition. Classic travel policy examples include booking the cheapest 
flight possible, only using company-approved hotels, spending only so many dollars 
per day on food, and so on. These rules can be quite extensive, having been devel￾oped over decades as the result of financial audits and previous mistakes. Since these 
ground rules are normally not communicated to you, it’s a good idea to specifically 
ask for verbal or written guidance on all travel rules and regulations. Travel is a case 
where small mistakes can have outsized visability for you as a new engineer.Ubiquitous Communication 281
Overall, for any company situation, the only true way to uncover these tidbits is to 
ask: ask your supervisor, ask your experienced colleagues and for meetings, ask the 
meeting organizer. Active engagement with the people and “society” of your local 
organization is the true way to minimize unforced errors. Don’t be shy.
10.3.3 Calling an Audible
A snap presentation or talk at any venue usually involves calling an audible. Fans 
of American football know the audible as a situation where a play is planned by the 
offense but is changed at the very last moment in response to the defensive align￾ment. The quarterback shouts a coded word or phrase and the plan is changed mere 
seconds before play begins. A snap presentation is essentially the same thing: your 
presentation is changed moments before it is to begin in response to changes with the 
audience or environment. It happens quite often.
Pete Shaw was a test engineer with about two years’ experience in digital tem￾perature sensor evaluation and related connectivity systems design. Pete’s job was 
twofold: test the sensor functionality of new designs and use the test results to ana￾lyze the relative performance of the new system vis-a-vis existing benchmarks.
Enter Helmut Gretzell, Chief Engineer for Connectivity Design. Gretzell was 
highly respected for his engineering skill and feared for his very blunt, public take￾downs of any engineer not meeting his exacting standards. Presenting to Gretzell 
was always in adventure in trepidation and anxiety.
Pete was assigned as the sensor test analyst for one of Gretzell’s programs that 
was behind schedule and at risk. One day Pete was asked to provide an extremely 
fast analysis of an unusual sensor proposal. There would be no time to test; only a 
predictive study would meet the timing for a formal review meeting with Gretzell 
and this team of some 30 managers. Pete developed a quick analysis based on his 
experience and hoped for the best.
Pete’s topic was last on a packed agenda, and sure enough, his topic was announced 
about three minutes before adjournment. Instead of his prepared remarks, Pete calls 
an audible:
Pete: “I was asked to provide an evaluation of the proposed sensor design. There 
was no time to test, so this is a judgement evaluation only. This evaluation 
was performed by breaking the design into six subcomponents (labeled 
one through six as shown on the slide), quantitively analyze them sepa￾rately, and add up the results of each. Subcomponents 1, 3 and 4 exceed 
the reference benchmark, 5 and 6 are equivalent and 2 is below the refer￾ent design. This analysis shows the new design to be 7% better than the 
reference. Thank you.”
Dead silence followed. Then Gretzell spoke:
Gretzell: “Do you work for this company?”
Pete: “Yes.”
Gretzell: “How long have you worked for us?”
Pete: “Two years.”282 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Gretzell: “That explains it. You gave a complete briefing, with everything I needed 
to know, in under 60 seconds. But by next year you’ll probably be talking 
as much as the other gasbags at this table. Don’t ever forget what you just 
did here today.
Meeting adjourned.”
Ninety-two words in under 60 seconds. Pete gave a masterful performance 
that day due to his ability to call an audible and pull it off, an excellent lesson 
for us all.
In short, always be prepared for a surprise presentation or discussion about 
your project. I’m not saying you must have a PowerPoint stashed somewhere in 
your laptop, but I am saying to always be able to do a five-minute talk on your 
project, as a hallway, discussion, presentation, or other format as we discussed. 
Remember, you must be able to speak intelligently on your work no matter the 
circumstances.
10.3.4 Control Issues in Presentation
It’s distressing but true: your presentation will not be in your control. As we just dis￾cussed, no matter what venue or gathering, surprise is the norm. Your allotted time 
may be cut in half, or the time slot changed, or the digital equipment has failed, or 
you get a constant interrupter, or unexpected strangers are present. As you are not 
in control, you must be nimble. What is your backup plan for each situation? For 
example, if your presentation software has failed, be prepared to simply state the 
conclusion of each slide without visuals. Proceed with your presentation verbally and 
don’t attempt to fix the electronics for more than 10 seconds or so.
One important thing to ponder regarding control: you may not have a choice in 
making a presentation. You might think to yourself, why are you making the pitch? 
Why isn’t your boss, coworker, or someone else presenting your material? It could 
be one of three reasons. First, perhaps you are the only expert on the topic or the 
only one available at that moment to give the brief. Secondly, your management may 
decide that you need training in presentation, and this opportunity is an excellent 
chance for you to gain experience in this unfamiliar skill. The third reason has to 
do with positive exposure. If your management is invested in advocating for you in 
a positive light, they may specifically ask or require you to make the presentation 
so you will become known to upper management or give you an opportunity to oth￾erwise “shine.” Note that all three reasons are good, which link to an old saying in 
professional settings: “never turn down an opportunity to speak in public,” but with 
the caveat “just have something to say.” Even though it may be an uncomfortable, or 
even terrifying experience, grab it and run.
10.3.5  Standardizing Communication
In more formal engineering organizations, there is a strong desire to standardize 
communication methods, especially for routine, periodic meetings or reviews. And Ubiquitous Communication 283
for good reason. Standardized communication aids in understanding; reducing the 
time to communicate a given thought while also delivering higher accuracy. The 
simple fact is that engineering executives prefer routine reports that look the same 
and are highly standardized for ease and speed of understanding. This led to the rise 
of the communication proforma, a pre-existing template where standardized infor￾mation is routinely placed and presented. With the proforma, the recipients do not 
have to relearn the type and location of information for each report; it’s comfortable 
and reassuring. It’s also much faster to create the report. This is another advantage of 
the BPR method described previously. Do not be surprised if you will be standard￾izing your reoccurring assignments into one of these platforms.
But the key word here is routine. As covered later in this chapter, there is a critical 
exception to the proforma approach you must be aware of.
10.3.6 Context, Leveling, and Bias
Qianyan Shea had a really interesting job. Working for a large technical multina￾tional, she was assigned the daunting task of becoming the organization’s technology 
“futurist.” In Qianyan’s firm, fresh information regarding new technologies from 
outside her company’s industry was traditionally ignored, at the risk of missing key 
technological developments that could impact her company’s future. Qianyan’s job 
was to correct this weakness; to look outside her firm’s specific environment, search￾ing for breakthrough technologies that in the long term could change her firm’s prod￾ucts or services. As a futurist, she used many different techniques to ferret out these 
long-term, “faint signal” technical developments.
There are many methods to do this, one of which was a highly effective tech￾nique called “genius futuring.” As its name suggests, individuals who are considered 
“geniuses” in a specialty technology are interviewed to mine their thoughts and pre￾dictions. Typical candidates would be luminaries such as Freeman Dyson (quantum 
field theory and astrophysics), Richard Dawkins (selfish genes), Bert Sakmann (cel￾lular signaling), and Norman Packard (chaos theory).
As part of her research, Qianyan’s management asked her to specifically inter￾view a number of these brilliant individuals. Naturally, she approached this assign￾ment with (not a little) trepidation. How in the world was she supposed to interview 
a “genius” when she wasn’t one? She didn’t consider herself anywhere near qualified 
to talk to these stars of technology, let alone understand what they were saying. She 
needed help. Fortunately, she found the author Thomas Bass, who had recently writ￾ten a book titled Reinventing the Future: Conversations with the World's Leading 
Scientists, in which he interviewed paradigm-changing thought leaders. Qianyan 
shares the story:
I finally sat down with Tom [Bass], and he gave me some excellent insight about com￾munications. “You don’t need to worry about communicating with these people.” he 
said. ‘They are smart enough to know very quickly your level of communication abil￾ity and the context of the discussion. The worthwhile ones will automatically adjust 
their own speech, vocabulary and way of explaining to match your own level of 284 Navigating the Engineering Organization
understanding. In a way, “they will come to you”; you will not have to go to them. 
Frankly, any person you are interviewing who doesn’t adjust their own communication 
level just wants to feel superior and is not really interested in sharing their knowledge. 
Stay away from these people. Search for the experts who want to truly reach you.
The crux of Tom’s message was that in communication, ensure all parties have the 
same context and level of understanding and adjust the exchange level to match that 
context. As discussed before, a simple but important principle.9
A few words about a related concern: bias. Bias is the tendency for us to hear or 
understand only information that we accept or agree with. Bias is a filter preventing 
clear communication and cannot be completely negated; we can only reduce it. This 
means we must continuously combat bias through clear, precise, interesting, well￾organized writing and speaking, especially in technical communications where the 
transfer of exact meaning is especially important. Not only must the communication 
be clearly conveyed, it must be highly accurate and with minimum bias so there is 
little chance for misinterpretation. This is very hard to do.10
10.3.7  Simple, Declarative Statements in Presentation
Clarity, brevity, and efficiency are essential in communicating, especially when pre￾senting to senior management. This calls for moderately paced, simple, declarative 
statements as applied to presentations. A surprisingly good example had to do with a 
large North American manufacturer planning a presentation to a delegation of execu￾tives from a smaller technology company located in Japan. At the time, this Japanese 
firm and the North American manufacturer were in negotiations for a potential joint 
venture. As part of their due diligence, a Japanese business and engineering team 
visited the North American firm to receive a briefing on the design of the proposed 
joint project. To the best of anyone’s knowledge, none of the Japanese delegation 
knew English, and the North American attendees certainly did not know Japanese at 
that time. Thus, a professional translator was engaged to facilitate technical commu￾nication between the two groups. Don Rustori was assigned to make the presentation 
on the project’s design feasibility to the Japanese, and was very concerned about the 
language differences.
To his surprise, rather than having a difficult talk, Don discovered the briefing 
using a translator was exceedingly easy to do. Unlike a normal presentation, where 
the audience expects a steady flow of words and ideas at a brisk pace, in a translated 
meeting, the presenter makes one simple, declarative statement and then waits 5 to 
7 seconds for that statement to be translated. To Don, those extra seconds were a 
blessing as he could use the time to clearly organize his thoughts and prepare his 
next statement while keeping the message as simple as possible. The speed of the 
presentation slowed and surprisingly, Don began to feel more in control of his talk. 
And because non-English speakers were listening, he was forced to simplify each 
statement. The lesson here is that a moderately paced presentation using simple, 
declarative statements leads to a highly effective, highly satisfying presentation. And 
your audience will appreciate it.Ubiquitous Communication 285
10.3.8  Silos, Jargon, and Acronyms
There are a few additional concepts in organizational communication that you should 
be aware of and understand as a new employee.
The first is silos. The term silo (or chimney) has become synonymous with nar￾row-mindedness, extreme control, and institutional bias. Silos are a metaphor for for￾mal or informal business structures that prevent the corporate whole from becoming 
greater than the sum of its individual parts. They are vertical organizations that are 
surrounded by mental “fortifications” or “brick walls,” implying little goes in or out. 
For years, reducing silos has been a popular topic in management literature.
Silos extend to the transfer of knowledge through communication. In communi￾cation, the silo effect is a purposeful blockage of information moving from one orga￾nization or person to another. Communication silos are based on the false premise 
that information can be controlled for advantage, even though the digital era proves 
each day that information control is ultimately a fool’s errand. And it is your job as 
a new engineer to identify the communication silos in place around you, know why 
they are in place, and establish your own appropriate boundaries and ground rules to 
guide your relationship to them.
For example, your department management may insist on silos due to trust issues 
with other departments, or perhaps even with other employees within your own 
department. You as a new engineer must individually decide how a communication 
silo (or any other silo for that matter) may impact your own personal responsibili￾ties and develop your own response plan. Then, have a full, honest discussion with 
your management to fully understand your management’s ground rules and reach 
a resolution, either formally or informally. Getting silos out on the table will pay 
dividends, as you will then know where both you and your management stand and 
avoid conflict.
Another interesting facet of our communication discussion is jargon and acro￾nyms. Jargon is special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession 
or group. For example, the word stat in a hospital setting is jargon for “quickly” or 
“emergency.” A wrap in movie or TV production is the completion of a unit of work; 
in American football a dime is a forward pass that travels at least 30 yards in the air 
and fits into a catch window of one yard or less. All are jargon.
We all know acronyms. An acronym is a subset of jargon, a word or name formed 
from the components of a longer name or phrase, usually using individual initial let￾ters. Examples include NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), EU (European 
Union), and NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). While an 
acronym is a particular form of jargon, both are essentially the same and have simi￾lar characteristics.
Jargon and acronyms are something that every professional, academic, scientist, 
and engineer will come to know and sometimes even love. Jargon is a way for groups 
in a local or closed society to have their own specific, special language that com￾municates knowledge quickly and accurately. Technical occupations today almost 
demand their own jargon. As with most concepts, there are advantages and disad￾vantages to using it. It can be an efficient way to communicate with coworkers in 286 Navigating the Engineering Organization
the same group, provided they also know the definitions, and it can give a sense 
of belonging to that specific organization. Jargon also implies deep knowledge of 
a particular field, and its use can demonstrate mastery of the technical content of 
the subject. Yet there are also some negatives to using it. These include being seen 
as a way for the speaker to “show off,” or leave an outsider feeling excluded from a 
conversation, or even leave an impression that the speaker has a hidden agenda. That 
said, on balance, jargon has a positive place in communication if used carefully and 
appropriately. Table 10.3 shares some recent examples of jargon from the technical 
community.

10.3.9  Listening and Voice in Personal Communication
Let’s touch on your personal communication for a moment. Personal communication 
is just as the term implies: the communication you personally bestow upon others, 
be it your boss, your peers, upper management, people in adjoining organizations, 
or colleagues outside your group. This used to be most commonly done by verbal 
means, but text messaging is now the main alternative. Either way, you are totally 
responsible for the message’s content and the clarity in expressing it. Luckily, this is 
one area where you have total control. Of course, the ground rules and expectations 
of personal communication within your local group or wider organization are unique 
and specific to that location and need to be learned quickly.
Listening
There is a simple, single rule for new engineers when it comes to personal com￾munications. All those thousands of “how to” books on communications mentioned 
earlier tend to give similar advice when coming into a new organization, and this 
book would be no different: listen.
In her article Just be Quiet and Listen, Laura O’Connor simply divides listen￾ing skills as either bad or good. Bad listening means waiting for the other person 
to stop talking simply so you can start. Ironically, some people don’t even wait 
until the other person has finished. There are some people who think of them￾selves as “assertive communicators” who are often the worst listeners. Eager to 
get their point across, they interrupt so much that another person can’t complete 
their sentence. Another characteristic is pretending to listen but not really listen￾ing at all.11
Greg Harris was a 10-year veteran engineering manager in a civil engineering 
firm named Kueller-Brace (KB). KB was a global construction engineering firm 
specializing in urban commercial buildings having an average height of over 35 
floors. KB had a presence in over 130 countries and was known as an aggressive, 
no-nonsense firm.
Greg’s was on the hook for a status report to KB’s Board of Directors regarding 
their latest construction project: a 47-story commercial office tower in Singapore. 
Things were not going well, but Greg had a solid recovery plan and was comfortable 
that it would be approved in short order. Gregg was scheduled to enter the meeting 
while it was already in session, which was standard procedure.
At the appointed time, Greg entered the boardroom and froze. Sitting around a 
large oak conference table were the 12 members of the board, each speaking in turn 
while passing around a three-foot-long, highly decorated wooden stick.
Yes, a stick.
Greg gave his presentation, and despite the distraction caused by this wooden 
object, it went well. Then as it came time for the question-and-answer period, Greg 
suddenly realized the purpose of the stick.
It seemed the aggressive nature of the company was reflected in their board meet￾ings. Members consistently interrupted each other, cutting off discussion with snide 
comments, asides, and constantly making argumentative comments designed to 288 Navigating the Engineering Organization
score debating points but nothing else. It had gotten so bad that the CEO brought in 
a communications consultant who, witnessing the listening problem, installed the 
talking stick method.
The idea is incredibly simple: if you have the stick, you talk; if not, you don’t.
Adopted from tribal culture, talking sticks are a powerful symbol, a communica￾tion tool used to foster an atmosphere of active listening and respect. As only the 
bearer of the stick has the right to speak, and those present must listen quietly to 
what is being said. And because the power is vested in the stick, not in any single 
individual, it’s easier for the rule to be enforced.
As for Greg? After being initially embarrassed that the board needed such a child￾like method to listen, Greg realized that at least they were trying. And he vowed he 
would never need to use a talking stick at work or at home.
Listening completely is hard, especially when you have a significant investment in 
the conversation. A common technique you may have been told is when listening to 
nod your head and keep eye contact. Experts argue this is not really listening. Good 
listening is looking for facts, emotions, and indications of the speaker’s values. The 
fundamental aim of listening is to build a relationship so the other person trusts you. 
And remember that there isn’t complete communication until both of you understand 
and agree on what was said.12
Voice
Another important point has to do with you speaking in meetings, be they formal 
management reviews or routine departmental meetings. There are three general 
types of verbal comments you can make: questions, facts, and opinions. Everything 
you say in a meeting will tend to fall into one of these categories. Here’s a framework 
for your first few months or so:
1) Listen and don’t speak. You don’t know the answer.
2) When ready to launch your first comments, they should follow a distinct 
hierarchy. First, whenever you decide to finally add to a conversation, your 
first comments should be in the form of questions. And I mean good ques￾tions. A bad question to ask your supervisor is, “where is the bathroom?” 
(Don’t laugh, I witnessed this happen). Rather, a good question in a meeting 
would be, “When is this information needed?” or “Is there anything special 
I should know about this problem?” A question is useless unless it makes 
progress towards an end goal.
3) Once gaining some experience in the form of questions, you can then move 
on to the second category, which are statements of fact. When ready, you 
should be willing to state facts relative to the conversation, but just facts. 
And obviously, your facts must be right. The rule of thumb is when you 
share a fact for the first time, it must be right. When you share a fact for the 
second time, that also must be right. When you share a fact for the third 
time, it certainly must be right. Only after three times have you established 
a small reputation for having your facts straight. And then you can risk 
perhaps having a fact found incorrect. Remember, you are establishing your Ubiquitous Communication 289
bona fides by having your facts correct. During this time, if you don’t know 
for sure, don’t speak.
4) The final category are opinions. You already know this, but I’ll state it any￾way: as a new engineer you are assumed to know nothing, and the people 
around you believe this, even if you indeed know something. Early on, no 
amount of talking by you will change this perception. Only after establish￾ing your bona fides will you be able to voice an opinion based solely on your 
past reputation for speaking with truth or accuracy. There is a quaint old 
saying attributed to Maurice Switzer that goes something like this:
“Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.”
10.3.10  Touchstones and Mavens
Your department or local organization probably has either a touchstone or a maven. 
The touchstone (who used to be the group secretary back in the old days, now replaced 
by today’s office coordinator, department controller, or perhaps the director’s admin￾istrative assistant) who occupies the communication and social “crossroads” of the 
department. Almost everything going on within the department flows through their 
desk. And I mean everything. Key reports, status notices, expense reports, personnel 
evaluations, annual raises and bonuses, future plans for high-potential employees; all 
these move under the watchful eye of the touchstone. If you don’t understand some￾thing, you go to the touchstone. If you feel something is unfair, you get the touch￾stone’s opinion. If you need a specific piece of information, the touchstone probably 
knows where it is. And if you are behind or forgotten something to do, the touchstone 
might give you a gentle reminder before your supervisor notices. Everyone depends 
on the touchstone.
The touchstone is also surprisingly influential. In addition to handling the group’s 
daily tasks and information flow (acting as “oil between the gears”), they are also an 
important de facto advisor to the manager or director. And their viewpoint counts; 
they have cache with the boss. This means you don’t want to be on the wrong side 
of a touchstone. And frankly, it has always been ironic that one of the most valuable 
individuals in an organization invariability receives some of the lowest pay or status 
in the group.
In the early 2000s, the people who were normally the touchstones, the adminis￾trative assistants, disappeared from the lower levels of the organization. Those who 
remained served the higher echelons of the engineering group, the directors and 
chief engineers rather than the supervisors and managers. While financially advanta￾geous, what was lost was the natural location of the touchstone, leaving regular engi￾neers and others devoid of their friends and advisors. One of the challenges resulting 
from this change is there is now no natural place for a touchstone to reside, no single 
place where so much information and knowledge can be had so easily.
Enter the maven. Mavens and touchstones are similar; people who acquire and 
share information within an organization. The maven’s role is knowing the information 290 Navigating the Engineering Organization
and the connections to promote understanding of what’s going on. According to 
Malcom Gladwell (who first coined the label) mavens are “information specialists,” 
or “people we rely upon to connect us with new information.” They accumulate 
knowledge, especially about the inner organization and know how to share it with 
others. According to Gladwell, mavens start “word-of-mouth epidemics” due to their 
knowledge, social skills, and ability to communicate. As Gladwell states: “Mavens 
are really information brokers, sharing and trading what they know.”13
Mavens are incredibly useful, and you need to find them. There is no magic for￾mula to finding a group’s maven; just engage with colleagues and coworkers until 
they become visible. Be curious and observe.
10.4 SPECIAL CASES
Communication, being such a contingent subject, presents countless special cases that 
are guided by unique and powerful environmental conditions and ground rules. These 
are one-of-a-kind cases, situations you’ll share as stories with colleagues in the hallway 
for years afterwards. They tend to be more important than normal communications 
and in extreme situations, can have lasting effects on your firm and perhaps yourself.
10.4.1 Communicating in the Senior Management Meeting
Decades ago, engineers did the daily work and the engineer’s supervisor or manager 
presented the results of that work to the director or vice president. If the engineer 
was lucky, perhaps they could sit in on the senior management presentation, as long 
as they sat at the back along the wall and remained mute. In fact, sometimes the 
supervisor or manager would actually remove the engineer’s name from a presenta￾tion or document and substitute their own name. Such was the corporate world in the 
dark ages.
Luckily, those days are essentially gone, replaced by the expectation that, no mat￾ter what rank you are, you will be presenting your own work to the seniors. And you 
need to know how to do it. Let’s look at the two main categories of formal meeting, 
the planned meeting, and the snap meeting.
The Formal, Planned Senior Management Meeting Presentation
What about presenting to a formal, planned meeting of a group of senior manage￾ment types? Obviously, you should first return to our first communication principles 
and start there. But due to the audience, you must accomplish additional preparation.
First, think about the makeup of the seniors you are presenting to. They are 
undoubtedly time and energy starved. They are probably tired, distracted, and bal￾ancing multiple worries simultaneously. Knowing this, attempt to make their life 
easier through limiting your presentation as follows:
1) Announce what your purpose is.
2) Be extremely brief unless asked to expand. Use only as much time as 
is necessary to achieve your communication goal. This means using a Ubiquitous Communication 291
minimum of their time and energy, which is their most valuable commod￾ity. Remember, nobody complains if you “refund” some of their time back 
to them.
3) Answer the questions being asked, using simple, declarative sentences that 
are clear (more on this later). There is an old joke that when you ask an 
engineer what time it is, they’ll tell you how they built the watch. Resist the 
temptation.
4) Do not go into background on test methods and process unless it is a critical 
new method, or you are asked to specifically discuss it. Unlike at university, 
where the test method is always described and defended, in industry your 
management assumes you are competent and as a professional are using the 
correct method. Employing the appropriate method is understood without 
being mentioned.
5) At the end, explicitly ask if there are any questions, comments, or concerns.
6) If requesting a decision and one is given, your last statement should be a 
clear repeat of the decision. If a discussion topic, summarize your under￾standing of the outcome simply.
Finally, as simple as it sounds, you must speak up. Speaking up has two advantages. 
For one, people can then actually hear what you have to say (which is your whole 
point in being there), and two, it shows confidence in what you are presenting and 
who you are. Just project your voice and let your knowledge fill the room.
An aside: Occasionally your presentation will go terribly, terribly wrong. Despite 
your best effort, your audience strongly disagrees, or is highly skeptical, constantly 
interrupts, or is openly disrespectful. It’s obvious that you’ve stumbled badly. When 
this happens, be prepared for shunning behavior, where walking out of the meeting, 
the other participants will not even look at you, let alone speak. You have instantly 
become a ghost, and will remain one for the next day or two. It’s easy to suggest 
you laugh it off, but it will still sting. Just learn whatever lesson there is to learn and 
move on.
The Formal, Snap Meeting Presentation
One of the common situations you can experience is the formal, snap meeting pre￾sentation. As we’ve mentioned, a snap presentation is a very challenging version 
of a talk in front of a group or audience, where you are given extremely little or no 
opportunity to prepare. This is unnerving enough when given to an informal group 
of peers or colleagues; it can become terrifying when attempted in front of upper 
management or other important audience.
From the 1940s to the 1980s, Henry Ford II was the president and CEO of the 
Ford Motor Company. During this time, Ford was consistently ranked within the top 
five corporations in the U.S. Fortune 500 rankings. Mr. Ford (nicknamed within the 
automotive world as “Hank the Deuce”) was the grandson of Henry Ford and inter￾nationally famous, the equivalent of a Bill Gates, Larry Ellis, or Jeff Bezos today.
One of Mr. Ford’s closest company and personal confidants was the Group Vice 
President for Public Affairs, a gentleman by the name of Walter Hayes. Hayes was 292 Navigating the Engineering Organization
considered to be one of the three most powerful men within the company at that 
time. An elegant Englishman with an impeccable accent and dress, his job was to 
know everything about each upcoming vehicle, truck, and concept car being devel￾oped within the company (and everything else for that matter). An impressive and 
intimidating figure.
At this time, Greg Scribner was the aerodynamicist for the Ford Probe IV concept 
vehicle. The Probe IV was a major effort to create the world’s most aerodynamic 
four passenger, fully functional road vehicle. An area of major global competition, 
aerodynamics defined the phrase “Advanced Technology” in the automotive sector 
for an entire decade.
One morning a designer came breathlessly into Greg’s office. “Greg,” he said, 
“Walter Hayes showed up in the design studio just now, and wants a briefing on the 
aerodynamics of the Probe. You need to get down there right away.”
Sometimes a snap presentation is a good thing. Since there is no time to prepare 
(or overprepare) your pitch, you can relax as you have the built-in excuse that if it 
doesn't go well, you can say you didn't have time to prepare.
Entering the studio, there was Hayes in a Savile Row suit, elegant white hair and 
matching tie and pocket square. When top executives like Hayes arrive, they always 
attract a crowd and this was no different: all of Greg’s bosses plus many other man￾agement types gravitated to the studio. Greg was commanded to begin his briefing.
As he tells it, Greg never forgot the first line of his presentation: “The purpose of 
the Probe IV concept car is to develop the most aerodynamic efficient, fully func￾tional four passenger vehicle in the world.” Greg was immediately stopped by Hayes:
“Young man, thank you for telling me that. In almost all the presentations I ever hear 
from engineers, no one ever simply tells me what the purpose of the project is. They 
always launch immediately into the details of the whatever they’re doing and I never 
have any context. So, thank you and please proceed.”
Greg’s management beamed and Greg, at least for a day, was a hero.
The lesson learned is simple. In any presentation make a clean, short statement on 
the purpose of your talk. Again, always use simple, declarative sentences stripped of 
any unnecessary words. Strunk and White’s seminal book on writing, The Elements 
of Style, sums it up neatly, “Omit needless words! Omit needless words! Omit nee￾dles words!”.14
I guess we should omit needless words.
10.4.2 Bad News: Reporting Serious Problems to Management
This much is certain: you will run into problems in your work. Most will be trivial, 
requiring no extra help in solving. Many will be moderately difficult, perhaps requir￾ing a coworker or colleague to assist. A smaller number will involve your supervisor, 
who will probably collaborate and advise you before settling on a path forward. But a 
critical few will require the attention and direction of your manager, director, or even 
executive director to solve; an experience prone to stress, worry, and acid indigestion Ubiquitous Communication 293
dependent on the cause of the problem and who is responsible for the solution. These 
problems require a specific type of briefing.
These are situations where the communication you provide must be successfully 
received and understood immediately, independent of the normal, routine mode 
of transmission. In a true crisis or emergency, none of the routine communication 
modes described previously are appropriate. Simply put, for extremely urgent and 
critical messaging, you must ensure the timeliness of the message and its clarity. 
For these messages, it is your responsibility to cut through the normal communica￾tion barriers when any form of safety, reputational, legal, or other negative impact 
comes to your attention. In short, do not use the usual, routine channels for com￾munications here.
Regarding timeliness, there is always a reluctance to share bad news, famously 
expressed by Shakespeare in the 16th century. His was the phrase, “don’t kill the 
messenger.”
Yet bad or negative news needs to be shared with management as soon as possible, 
so they may begin countermeasures and avoid or reduce the negative consequences.
A more serious example of failing to tell senior management bad news happened 
about five years ago at a major digital products company. Mike Whittan, the execu￾tive director of the company’s Advanced Technology organization, was charged with 
performing an annual technology review for the senior management of the entire 
organization. Mike’s annual technology review was a key report card on how his 
large, technically savvy (but expensive) sub-organization was providing future-look￾ing technologies for the general consumer. Mike's goal was to emphasize their latest 
customer-facing products.
For this review, Mike’s engineers had developed a suite of seven related technolo￾gies, all designed to work in unison to provide an enhanced customer experience. 
Each individual technology enhanced the adjoining 6 other features, providing an 
overall best-in-class functionality.
To demonstrate these technologies, instead of showing each technology sepa￾rately, Mike decided to place all seven of them together in specially constructed, 
enclosed display area so that each executive could, with one visit, experience the 
entire suite. The interior of this enclosure would be designed with a futuristic theme, 
giving each executive an exciting and memorable experience. This is a very com￾mon way of demonstrating concept technologies by immersing decision-makers in a 
special environment, and from that experience, these top executives would hopefully 
approve those seven technologies to begin mass production.
With five months to go before the review, Mike assigned a four-year supervisor 
and two new engineers to have the enclosure designed and a specialty interior design 
house execute the futuristic vision. The supervisor was given the five months to com￾plete the project with a budget of $315,000.
Early on, the supervisor and two engineers experienced delays in hiring the 
design house and getting the enclosure begun. Additional delays happened due to the 
designers optimizing their styling rather than beginning actual construction. Three 
months into the project, the supervisor realized the enclosure was going to be late, 
very late. Rather than immediately report this bad news to Mike, the supervisor 294 Navigating the Engineering Organization
elected to keep quiet and hope the time could be made up with overtime without 
anyone noticing. Yet as the remaining weeks flew by, the schedule only got worse.
With three weeks to go, the timing issue getting more acute and substantial over￾time now being spent without approval, the build was in serious trouble. Unable to 
hide the status any longer, the supervisor went to Mike and reported that to deliver 
the vehicle on time would take an additional $252,000 to pay for the overtime already 
spent, plus the additional premium time needed to finish the build. Mike was asked 
to approve the additional funding.
Mike was livid. Here, he was presented with a huge bill without warning. As 
Mike said: “This is not a decision, it’s a gun to the head.” Mike was forced to spend 
over $250,000 in unbudgeted funds to avoid a major embarrassment with senior 
management.
While the technology suite showed well with senior management (and in fact did 
get approved as a new product line), the upset caused by the schedule and funding 
overruns had lasting effects. Within three months, the supervisor was transferred 
to a different organization within the larger company, and while the two engineers 
remained in the organization, they were sidelined on secondary projects. The super￾visor was not fired from the company per se, but was released from the home organi￾zation and the two engineers banished to an outpost within the department. The key 
mistake was made early on by not reporting impending trouble, eliminating options 
Mike could have taken to correct the situation. Closing out options for management 
is a sin.
Messaging clarity is equally important when reporting bad news. A well-known 
example is the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster. On February 1, 2003, the Columbia 
broke apart on reentry into the earth’s atmosphere, killing its crew of seven and 
dealing a severe blow to America’s technical prestige. Foam insulation from the 
shuttle’s external fuel tank separated during launch, impacting and criticality dam￾aging the shuttle’s wing leading edge. This damage allowed hot gases to enter the 
wing on reentry, melting the interior structure and ultimately causing the vehicle’s 
disintegration. While neither the crew nor ground controllers knew of the damage, 
certain structural engineers suspected that damage may had occurred, it was merely 
a hunch. While the investigation board assigned primary blame on the foam strike, 
it also identified another culprit: a communication failure rooted in the routine of 
formal management meetings, specifically the use of presentation slide proformas.
In Response Paper ESD.85J: Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Former 
Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Sheila Widnall cited NASA’s use of Microsoft’s 
PowerPoint slideware and its deleterious effect on communicating complexity and 
decision-making. To quote Widnall:
One week before Columbia’s scheduled re-entry … engineers … formally presented 
the results of their numerical analysis [on the potentially damaged wing] … They 
projected a typically crude PowerPoint summary … with which they attempted to 
explain a nuanced position: first, that if the tile had been damaged, it had probably 
endured well enough to allow the Columbia to come home; and second, that for lack 
of information they had needed to make assumptions to reach that conclusion, and Ubiquitous Communication 295
that troubling unknowns therefore limited the meaning of the results. The latter mes￾sage seems to have been lost. This particular PowerPoint presentation became a case 
study for Edward Tufte, Yale’s brilliant communications specialist, who subsequently 
tore into [PowerPoint] … for its dampening effect on clear expression and thought. 
The [Accident Investigation Board] later joined in, describing the widespread use of 
PowerPoint within NASA as one of the obstacles to internal communication.15
The board concluded that shuttle management had become too reliant on present￾ing complex information via PowerPoint templates instead of traditional technical 
reports. When NASA engineers assessed possible wing damage during the mission, 
they presented the findings in a confusing PowerPoint slide, so crammed with nested 
bullet points and acronyms that it was nearly impossible to understand. “It is easy to 
understand how a senior manager might read this PowerPoint slide and not realize 
that it addresses a life-threatening situation,” the board stated.
This communications Achilles heel is seconded by former U.S. Navy Secretary 
Dr. Donald C. Winter, who during his tenure, pushed to “ban” PowerPoint within the 
Navy, stating that the software retards clarity and insight in policy-level decisions.16
The takeaway here is that for routine reporting of uncontroversial data in stan￾dard meetings, communication proformas can help speed management understand￾ing. The exception is when reporting major problems, presenting unusual, critical or 
nuanced information, where misunderstanding will have strong consequences. In 
this case, the presenter must advocate for a unique communication mode that fully 
imparts the urgency, criticality, and consequences consistent with the importance of 
the message.
Knowing this, an engineer has many paths to choose from when deciding how to 
proceed. While each boss has a different preference in how to absorb information, 
a good bet is to approach the briefing in a way that maximizes information quality 
while taking ample time to ensure the message is correctly received. This is one time 
not to minimize presentation duration.
When briefing the organization’s leadership, the presenter needs to communicate 
three things:
1) What the briefer knows about the situation.
2) What the briefer doesn’t know about the situation. They must honestly tell 
the seniors what the presenter doesn’t know. This is as important as the 
information the briefer does know about the issue.
3) What is the recommendation or solution regarding the situation? This is 
critical, as if no recommendation or solution is brought forward, manage￾ment will feel obligated to impose one, and odds are no one will like their 
solution.
One important caveat will condition a presentation’s preparations. Remember, each 
boss has a worldview, a certain set of beliefs, facts, and experiences that impacts how 
they see their environment and their reaction to it. For example, some bosses may 
have had their formative experiences in a highly formal or bureaucratic organization, 296 Navigating the Engineering Organization
where T’s are crossed and I’s are dotted. Or they may be informal in word and deed. 
No matter their style, the key is to try to match your message to their best method of 
absorbing information. Otherwise, their stress may block the accurate reception of 
the information.
So, how do you pull off this little trick? After all, communications can be like a 
boxing match: engineering vs. finance, engineering vs. marketing, engineering vs. 
industrial design; sometimes one engineering specialty vs. another. You will run into 
this surprisingly often. The key to solving this problem is to understand the others’ 
language: the language of design, the language of finance, the language of market￾ing. You must be prepared to adjust your language and meaning to match your audi￾ence. Only then do you have a chance of legitimately changing minds, especially of 
any individual or group dealing with important problems.
10.5 REALIZATIONS
Organizational communication is complex. There are many failure states, some 
within your control and some not. The proper design of the organization’s communi￾cations system is to identify and address the unseen, critical elements of a successful 
information transfer system. Conversely, an improper communications system can 
hurt, or even destroy, the ability of an engineering organization to function.
Communication is a series of linkages between a starting and ending point. 
Communication is all about the quality of these linkages, directly dependent on type, 
strength, language, and distance between those endpoints. This is obvious; however, 
one point isn’t. The context of the communication is absolutely critical if a message 
is to be successfully transmitted and received. All parties taking part in communica￾tion must experience the identical context at the identical time.
We’ve spent a substantial amount of detailed effort discussing communication in 
meetings, presentations, hallways; in both formal and informal venues, and when 
sharing bad news or in crisis. These can be helpful, but please remember these are 
tactics in communications, not a strategy: the strategic purpose is to achieve that goal 
of clear and accurate transfer of thought between communicators.
As of this writing, the global COVID pandemic is beginning to recede, and new 
learnings in digital distance communication abound. Initial discussions regarding 
the enhanced role of electronic communication due to social distancing are starting. 
New “rules of the road” have been proposed and certain innovative protocols have 
been informally agreed to. A trend that started before the pandemic and has acceler￾ated since is the pending disappearance of printed paper, replaced with new forms 
of digital documentation. And many people are waiting for the next breakthrough in 
digital communications, the next step beyond WebEx, Zoom, and the like. Whatever 
the specifics, the intent of communications is not to use a particular technology but 
use any appropriate technology that maximizes the quality of communication.
We’re getting close to finally designing your personal roadmap. Just two penul￾timate steps remain: to complete some final preparations by integrating the compo￾nents of the Inner Core, and then top it off with the large role personal ethics will 
make in the entire roadmap creation. Our next chapter tackles these two steps.Ubiquitous Communication 297

Creating a Personal Roadmap301
11 Final Preparations
Integration and Ethics
11.1 FINAL PREPARATIONS: REACHING THE PENULTIMATE STEPS
Blessedly, we’re almost done. So far, we’ve identified the fundamental organiza￾tional framework that all engineering organizations use. We’ve parsed that model 
into its elements and individually examined those pieces. We’ve then looked deeply 
into the five key components of the framework’s Inner Core and discussed the fac￾tors that can help operate within that core, hopefully preventing the mistakes and 
miscues that lurk in its dark corners.
Our next step is twofold: connecting the components of the core into a strong, 
dependable, holistic model of mutual understanding and dependency and then apply￾ing a capstone of personal ethical considerations to the model. These final steps will 
complete the preparations developing your personal guide, the navigation tool you 
will apply each day as you transition into the professional ranks. The good news is 
that neither of these final two tasks is particularly difficult. Establishing the obvious 
linkages between components is straightforward, and developing your personal ethi￾cal understanding is fundamentally simple once the main points of ethical belief and 
behavior are understood. The only challenge is applying some mindfulness to both 
these activities.
Let’s start with connecting the components.
11.2 MELDING THE COMPONENTS TOGETHER
Let’s go back to Chapter 4 and look again at the original Essential Engineering 
Framework, specifically the Inner Core. As in Figure 11.1, the five components 
embedded in the external environment are each different by virtue of their specific 
purpose, function, and rules of operation: each component is unique. Yet if this is 
completely true, how can we reasonably expect to meld these disparate pieces into an 
integrated whole, something that makes sense and is useful to an aspiring engineer￾ing professional?
The trick to integrating these components is dependency. Each of the five com￾ponents is dependent upon the others, perhaps not on the surface, but will become 
visible when we perform a component-to-component analysis. All these components 
are adjacent: they lean on each other like a Roman arch where one missing stone 
brings the entire edifice to the ground. In short, the five components “need” each 
other to function and allow you to drive toward your goals.

10.1201/9781003214397-15302 Navigating the Engineering Organization
This has practical implications. You need to understand the basic purpose, char￾acteristics, and limitations of each component well enough to naturally and quickly 
see the dependencies present. And not just the obvious ones, but the hidden connec￾tions as well. That’s what melding the components means.
Let’s take the simple example of the hiring and onboarding process you expe￾rienced as you joined your new engineering company. You probably view this as a 
linear process per Figure 11.2.
Say you receive an offer to join the firm as a design engineer. You may negotiate 
the conditions of your employment, such as pay, benefits, bonus (if fortunate), work 
location, or home department. You and the company agree to terms, and you begin 
employment on the appointed day. After a morning of paperwork and routine busi￾ness, you are escorted down to your work location where, under the eye of your new 
supervisor, you officially begin your career.
You may or may not undergo training immediately, but after preparation of some 
sort, the daily work begins. And after a length of time, you are accepted as a group 
member in good standing and your work becomes a legitimate contribution to the 
organization.
This is most likely a universal process, and for you it is indeed linear. Yet for 
your organization your hiring is a networked, interdependent combination of compo￾nents and subcomponents that come and go over time. To see this, let’s rack up each

process step against our five core components and establish which step is dependent 
upon which component. We can then step down a level and judge which subgroup 
in each component impacts your onboarding, as shown in Table 11.1. Breaking the 
process down this way yields eight steps involving seven connections to a variety of 
the five components. These are:
Human and Hard Resources: Human Resources Department Subcomponent
In this role, HR is responsible for two tasks: identifying, engaging, assessing, and 
deciding if you are a potential engineering employee, and if hired, shepherd you 
through the formal onboarding process (as much as there is one). A single HR 
employee is assigned as your central contact throughout this hiring phase. They 
are your point of contact through the first six steps and then essentially disap￾pear. In large groups, this is a temporary relationship; in smaller organizations 
this person subsequently becomes your long-term connection to the world of HR. 
Even if they become your ongoing connection, their active interaction tends to 
end after some training is accomplished, except for normal career or personnel 
questions.
Human and Hard Resources: Finance and Legal Subcomponents
In the context of your onboarding, your connection to the Finance and Legal subcom￾ponents is short and hidden from you. Finance approves the negotiated compensation Degree of Integration

of your offer, and Legal primarily preforms the routine checks on your legal status 
(citizen, green card holder, conditional resident, foreign national, resident alien, and 
so on) and ensures you are allowed to be hired.
Human and Hard Resources: Facilities Subcomponent
The Facilities department connection is also quick and hidden. Their job is to arrange 
for and deliver your personal infrastructure: desks, chairs, cabinets, cubicles, open￾air work locations; all are their responsibility. This might seem like nothing: you 
show up and all your equipment is (hopefully) there. But this infrastructure doesn’t 
arrive on its own; it appears through the intervention of a number of facility staff. 
Personal infrastructure like this is normally in short supply, and you may unknow￾ingly be part of a competition with other employees to score that newer desk or on 
what day your special ergonometric chair might arrive.
Technology System: Information Technology 
and Functional Tools Subcomponent
The Information Technology (IT) Department and Functional Tools subgroup in 
the context of your onboarding is a very short but visible connection to you. You 
need a laptop, a phone, a workstation, and any other unique hardware or software, 
either as an external purchase or sourced inhouse. Your initial involvement with IT 
is hopefully short but it doesn’t disappear completely: you will have ongoing, low￾frequency interactions with IT throughout your tenure. The same goes with whatever 
subgroup handles any special technology you require. You will be talking with these 
people again.
Formal Organization: Local Group and Departmental Subcomponents
Obviously, the formal organization is where most of your integration will take place. 
You will be focused on your local group (engineering peers, colleagues, supervisor, 
and manager) and your overall department organization (your director, executive 
director, and adjoining departments). Clearly, you will be highly dependent on and 
most closely integrated with your local group, and with the systems and environment 
immediately surrounding you. This means you will continuously immerse yourself 
with policy deployment, standardized operating procedures, scores of ground rules, 
and all the other considerations listed in Chapter 6. Your interactions are immediate 
and ongoing with many individual relationships. This is home.
Hidden Organization: Corporate Culture and 
Departmental Subculture Subcomponents
As you might anticipate, this is probably one of the most difficult components you 
will integrate into. As we’ve discussed, this is where most hidden connections reside, 
and they can last for a very long time. On arrival, you have no relationships, no 
personal investments, no common history with others, no group knowledge, no 306 Navigating the Engineering Organization
first-hand reputation with them, and no trust established. In short, in the eyes of the 
group, you have nothing to contribute. Each of these characteristics must be pur￾posely established and demonstrated, and soon. Your first action or interaction must 
be right; your second interaction must be right; your third better be right.
After the formal organization, the hidden organization is the priority and needs your 
full attention. Because one day within the first month or so, a hallway conversation will 
occur between any two of your group’s members. It will go basically like this:
Question: “How’s the new kid doing?”
Answer: “They seem to be OK”,or
“They just don’t seem to get it”.
That’s it: short, small interactions in the hidden organization can convey an out￾sized message about you as a group member. For something so short, that exchange 
has a powerful impact.
Communication: Internal Connectivity Subcomponent
It’s no surprise that a required part of integration is communication, especially com￾munication at the personal, group, and department levels. As we learned in Chapter 
10, communication is the glue holding the other four components together and is 
essential to you starting from Day One. Communication may seem a bit overwhelm￾ing so early on, especially if your group members like to use a lot of jargon and 
acronyms. But communication will come naturally enough if you are curious and 
show a willingness to engage.
As you see, for the simple task of onboarding, there are a surprising number of 
connections that are made before, during, and soon after your arrival. The good news 
in an exercise like this is that making the connections is easy once you become sen￾sitized to it. Your first few months will, in large part, be spent learning to make those 
connections: understanding how these components interrelate is one of the main 
goals of your initial employment. Just realize that integration of these five pieces 
is multifaceted, involving connections with many people and entities. Complete 
understanding will not come quickly, but a working level knowledge can be attained 
quickly enough if it’s kept in mind.
In our onboarding example, it’s easy to see the connections within the Inner Core. 
But let’s discuss a situation where the protagonist does not meld the components 
together into a unified whole.
Say you are a new engineer at a national, high-end sporting goods manufacturer 
located in Boulder, Colorado. This company makes equipment in all areas of sports: 
baseball bats, basketballs, hockey sticks, football helmets, soccer shoes, and snow 
sports are all part of its equipment portfolio. They have an excellent reputation for 
providing high-performance sporting goods at a reasonable price.
You are the first mechanical engineer ever hired by this manufacturer, as they 
believe more advanced technology in their products will give them an edge in their 
existing market space. As a new member of their advanced product group, your Final Preparations 307
specialty is investigating and developing advanced materials to improve their offer￾ing’s performance, including unique “aspirational” equipment. Today, you are asked 
to perform your first major assignment: an evaluation of a new pair of downhill rac￾ing skis developed by a second-tier startup supplier.
High-performance skis are an interesting product. For maximum speed in downhill 
racing, the skier must continuously apply forward pressure to the ski. All modern perfor￾mance skis need to engage the tip at the top of each turn to start the ski carving and to 
prevent chatter, a speed killer. If you transfer all your weight into the middle of the ski, 
you’ll lose precious speed. The idea is to drive pressure onto the tip of your downside ski 
by flexing hard at the ankle against the inside corner of your ski boot. After you feel the 
tip engage, you can then allow pressure to build under your foot. A tough trick, some￾thing that only the most expert skiers can accomplish. But what if a dilettante skier (as 
99.98% of us are) could do the same thing? Faster speed and greater satisfaction.
This is where a first-tier supplier comes in. They are offering your company a rev￾olutionary new ski, one based on the piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect is 
the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to an applied 
mechanical force or stress. One of the unique characteristics of this effect is that it is 
reversible, meaning that materials exhibiting the effect (the generation of electricity when 
stress is applied) also exhibit the converse (the generation of stress when an electric field 
is applied). Since piezoelectric materials can change shape when an electric current is 
present, these materials can bend, stretch, or contract depending upon the amount of 
electricity applied. The idea here is that the ski could bend and flex independent of the 
terrain, continually changing shape to adhere closer to the ideal performance contour. A 
terrific, game-changing product, but only if it works.
Your job is simple. Evaluate the performance of the new ski and recommend if 
your company should take out an exclusive contract with the first-tier company for 
$24.3 million. An interesting assignment and important too.
Evaluating something as sophisticated as a piezoelectric ski is not easy, and you 
envision measuring an electric charge versus deflection per unit time, yielding a set 
of characteristic performance graphs.
Eager to begin and being told time is of the essence (it always is), your first step 
is to figure out just how to measure the deflection of the ski under a range of electri￾cal and environmental conditions. Finding no suitable test apparatus available, you 
investigate and submit a purchase order to your boss for $112,000 for the design and 
purchase a new testing stand. Your supervisor, while uneasy, approves the request 
and incurs a sunk cost of $112,000, with delivery in six weeks’ time.
After the six weeks, the test stand arrives, and you perform the test. The result 
is a nice, tidy set of deflection versus electric charge graphs that indeed shows sig￾nificant deflection when power is applied. This claim made by the first-tier supplier 
is proven true and you recommend the purchase at the original investment level of 
$24.3 million.
And your management’s reaction is … unenthusiastic.
The issue here is not measuring deflection but judging performance. It’s really 
about evaluating the entire ski package, not a single mechanical characteristic. 
While you accomplished the engineering task of proving the piezoelectric ski does 308 Navigating the Engineering Organization
work, a true performance analysis was not done. This type of analysis is meant to 
answer higher-level questions. Does the piezoelectric ski actually change shape fast 
enough to be used in downhill or mogul racing? If so, does it really result in a faster 
time? Can the average customer perceive any performance difference compared to a 
normal ski? Overall, even if the ski works as advertised, will the customer be satis￾fied with it or just view it as an advertising ploy?
At its root, the word evaluate has a certain meaning for you and a totally different 
meaning for your management and the company as a whole. You viewed evaluation 
as strictly an engineering function; your supervisor viewed evaluation as judging a 
total product system. What was needed was a holistic evaluation plan, incorporat￾ing all five of the Inner Core components. Your plan addressed only the Technical 
System. No total cost analysis was performed, no communication occurred except 
with the supervisor; no real-use testing occurred. Using an integrated, component￾based approach would have avoided this embarrassing result.
A few points to consider. First, no matter how quick the evaluation deadline is, 
you need to step back, have a Red Bull or Monster, and think about it. Was the assign￾ment clear enough? What does performance truly mean? Is your boss asking for help 
on a holistic assessment or a simple mechanical engineering evaluation? Each of 
these questions will identify which of the five components you need to employ. For 
example, to completely evaluate the ski, you need help from most of your department 
subgroups, plus organizations outside your group: the business office, the reliabil￾ity and durability offices, the warranty group, the finance department plus several 
others. If the ski truly delivers the benefit as touted by the supplier, you have no 
worries. If the piezoelectric effect is working but did not translate to improved per￾formance by either an advanced or average skier, management would make a judg￾ment whether to produce it or not. If the piezoelectric affect was not working at all, 
would the company still go ahead and offer it for sale, even if it was a false claim? In 
short, this evaluation involves judgments from the other core components. This is the 
difference between a savvy engineer and a brand new “one trick pony.”
But how about expanding this concept even wider by establishing an understand￾ing between your engineering organization and a completely unrelated group, say 
the company’s sales organization? Let’s look at a case example using these same 
components to link unrelated divisions together.
CASE EXAMPLE 11.1 THE DDS 
CORPORATION FLEET CONQUEST
DDS is a global provider of home and business security systems, operating 
in 34 global markets with annual revenue of nearly $10.9 billion. Their field 
technicians use a fleet of some 4,500 light utility vehicles to install and ser￾vice their products. Prior to 2019, DDS purchased these vehicles exclusively 
from the Legacy Mobility Corporation. However, in 2019 DDS elected to open 
their fleet procurement process to other automotive manufacturers, includ￾ing Legacy’s chief competitor Vibrant Motors. On hearing this, Vibrant Fleet Final Preparations 309
Manager Mike Garcia identified an exciting opportunity to seize substantial 
conquest sales away from Legacy.
DDS did not know very much about Vibrant’s vehicle capabilities, as DDS’s 
perception was that Vibrant “just made cars and trucks.” Discovering that DDS 
had no knowledge of Vibrant’s strong leadership in vehicle occupant safety and 
technology, Garcia contacted Tony Lewis in Vibrant’s Research and Advanced 
Technology Division (R&AT). Together they quickly determined that target￾ing DDS through education on safety technology, plus hands-on visits to wit￾ness actual safety crash tests, would radically change DDS’s perception of 
Vibrant and thus, the competitive landscape.
Mike and Tony quietly arranged multiple visits by DDS to the Vibrant 
Research Laboratories, witnessing testing and having Vibrant’s leading experts 
in automotive safety present their latest work.
The visits and safety education went well. The DDS management delega￾tion was very surprised at the depth and breadth of expertise and resources 
devoted by Vibrant toward safety. Improved safety had a double benefit for 
DDS. First, it reduced injuries to DDS drivers which substantially cut insur￾ance costs. Secondly, it could demonstrate to DDS drivers they were driv￾ing the most advanced, safety-equipped vehicles on the market, improving 
employee morale and job satisfaction ratings. Coupled with additional technol￾ogy systems, Vibrant built a compelling case.
It worked. In early 2020, DDS placed a conquest order for 4,500 Vibrant 
“Connector” light utility vehicles, replacing their entire fleet of Legacy vehi￾cles. Net revenue to Vibrant was $114 million dollars. In their purchase letter 
to Vibrant, DDS expressly stated that their briefings on vehicle safety research, 
and the passion of the safety scientists they met, was the key factor in their 
decision to leave Legacy and move to Vibrant.
The lessons of the Vibrant case are not hard to see. This example is all about 
the integration of components from separate organizations, demonstrated by:
1) Mutual communication linkages, where safety department members 
acted as technology “brokers” to attain mutually beneficial out￾comes for the both DSS and Vibrant.
2) The hidden organization where, by quietly acting as an ad-hoc group 
avoided the barriers and “bureaucratic drag” of traditional com￾mand and control, demonstrated by not asking for vice presidential 
approval of the project in advance.
3) Human resources in the form of talent; those experts who educated 
and convinced the DSS executives on the importance of safety.
4) The technology system which created the unique, advanced safety 
products that DSS desired.
In essence, Mike and Tony melded a one-of-a-kind set of components in the 
communication, culture, talent, and technology spaces, creating a “win” for 
both organizations.310 Navigating the Engineering Organization
One final point. We know how this example worked for Vibrant, but why did 
it work? For one, the groundwork was prepared several years before the DDS 
opportunity. Certain R&AT engineers had previously established strong, personal 
relationships across the many silos existing between R&AT and other Vibrant 
organizations. Vibrant R&AT was now connected personally to many other inter￾nal organizations, including the Vibrant Fleet Sales activity. By establishing in 
advance these relationships at the personal level, the traditional, formal collabora￾tion process was “short circuited” and major opportunities could then be quickly 
exploited. The fact that Mike Garcia knew specifically to call Tony Lewis, in a 
company of over 72,000 employees, proves the point. Garcia knew the connection 
existed and used it: it was part of his prior, personal integrated roadmap.
In your own search for connection and integration, what if the connections you 
see just don’t make any logical sense to you? What if, despite your best efforts, you 
can’t resolve the links (or lack of linkages) between certain components? Frankly, 
there is a good chance some of them won’t. We need to spend a few minutes on 
why this is and how to resolve this cognitive dissonance within your own mind.
11.3 RESOLVING THE CONTRADICTIONS: 
ORGANIZATIONAL SENSEMAKING
Integrating the components depends on making sense of each interaction between 
them. Sensemaking is an attempt to reduce multiple meanings and handle the com￾plex information used by people in organizations. In Chapter 8, we discussed the 
work of Karl Weick, who contends that the practice of day-to-day work is actually 
quite different from what we might believe.
Weick maintains organizing is a continuous, evolutionary process with the goal of 
reducing confusion, that employees place limitations upon the organization to avoid 
issues and that groups evolve as they make sense of themselves and their environ￾ment. Weick’s framework for understanding organizations means making sense of the 
often overwhelming complexity and contradictions people create.1 Communication 
becomes key because of its role in this sensemaking process.
Now here’s a controversial statement. From this perspective, strategies, plans, rules, 
and goals are not things that exist in an objective sense; rather their source is in the group 
member’s way of thinking. From a sensemaking perspective, the question of whether 
someone’s view of the world is correct is not meaningful. Instead, the correctness of a 
position is contingent on the point of view that is being used for evaluation. The basic 
idea of sensemaking is that reality is an ongoing realization that emerges from an indi￾vidual’s efforts to create order and understanding from complex environments. In short, 
sensemaking allows people to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity by creating rational 
accounts of the world that can cause them to enable some sort of action.2
This is certainly counterintuitive, but let’s play out this idea with a simple case. 
What if making a connection between you and a core component doesn’t make any 
sense? What if, for whatever reason, the connection between you and a person in the 
financial office is totally illogical and just not working? For example, let’s say you Final Preparations 311
absolutely need to purchase some carbon nanotube material for a new innovation, 
but your request is repeatedly denied by the financial controller. You know your 
innovation is a game-changer, that it will fill a current white space in the market, and 
you’re certain you cannot proceed with your project without this critical material. 
But your pleas to approve the funding have absolutely no effect on the controller. In 
short, this lack of integration with finance makes absolutely no sense. Why is this, 
and how can a successful connection be established?
The answer is in organizational sensemaking. You see your innovation as chang￾ing the competitive landscape: it changes the external environment. You see what the 
future will be. The controller only sees a request for a piece of expensive material, 
with no context as to what it is for, why it is important, and what its benefit to the 
enterprise is. You see a new world; the controller sees an unnecessary expense.
Lack of context and the resulting view of reality helps explain the controller’s 
position. The simple solution to this problem is to sit down with your controller 
(face-to-face, as dynamic message delivery is best) and explain the new environment 
this innovation will create; to bring the controller along on this journey to a better 
world. It means demonstrating the benefit of the new material; it means active com￾munication between both parties. (An aside: here we run into our old problem of not 
advocating for our work; the “my technology is so good, it speaks for itself” issue. 
Don’t fall into this mindset: spread the word.)
From Weick’s idea, researchers Chris Argyris and Donald Schön went further to 
argue that people have predetermined “mental maps” regarding how to act in vari￾ous situations. These involve the way they plan, execute, and judge their actions. It 
is these maps that guide people’s actions, rather than the beliefs they explicitly state, 
which is very similar to the retrospective sensemaking theory. In other words, in 
complex organizations what people say and do are highly inconsistent; “the words 
and the music don’t match.” A common example of this thinking is the case where 
organization members respond to changes in the environment by detecting errors 
which they then correct to maintain the status quo, rather than resolving incompat￾ible situations by setting new priorities and norms, or by restructuring the norms 
themselves together with new strategies and assumptions. In other words, maintain￾ing an existing paradigm rather than investigating if a new paradigm is now in place.3
In trying to resolve sensemaking, a paradigm shift is a very good starting place to 
start investigating. You will be very surprised how often this takes place. Look for 
the incompatible assumptions and mindsets in place: this is where you may find the 
key to making sense of a situation.
11.4 THE ONE CRITICAL EXCEPTION: YOUR 
PERSONAL CODE OF ETHICS
Throughout this book, we’ve been talking (somewhat insistently) about contingency 
theory. So much that your eyes may glaze over when you see those words and you’ll 
probably never utter that phrase again. But let me share just one last point about con￾tingency. Contingency theory has been the one touchstone that has been a constant 
in all the topics we’ve discussed. Now, it’s time to reveal the one exception to the 
contingency theory model. I’m talking about personal ethics.312 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Ethics can be a slippery idea, and like most important ideas is subject to confu￾sion and misinterpretation. Here, a moral or ethical principle is simply the belief 
that what is correct or incorrect is determined and accepted by an individual or 
social unit, i.e., how they should behave. This is based on what a person’s conscience 
(integrity, principle) says is correct or incorrect, rather than what the law says should 
be done and is good or right when judged by the standards of a typical person or 
society at large.
That sounds simple, but there’s much more to it than a single definition. Let’s 
deconstruct this concept and clarify what ethics is and the applications it entails.
In this book, we establish three categories of ethics based on where they are 
applied. The first is corporate or managerial ethics, which are behavioral guidance 
rules aimed at steering groups of corporate individuals in decision-making. Social 
media and other news outlets delight in reporting corporate ethical lapses of this 
kind. You don’t have to think very hard to recall such major corporate ethics disas￾ters as the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon explo￾sion, the Dow Chemical Bhopal catastrophe, the Volkswagen diesel scandal, and on 
and on, ad infinitum. You are probably most familiar with these when you think of 
a firm’s moral behavior.
The second type is critical: personal ethics. As we’ve repeatedly established in 
this book, there are many definitions of the same phrase, and personal ethics is no 
different. Here, personal ethics are moral principles governing the appropriate con￾duct of an individual or very small group.
The third type is a subset of personal ethics called professional ethics. Every 
profession has a code of ethics, a series of statements defining acceptable and unac￾ceptable professional behavior meant to provide guidance and comfort to those pro￾fessionals facing ethical dilemmas. For us, The Engineering Professional Code of 
Ethics developed by the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) is our 
guidepost. The current code is exhibited in Table 11.2.
4
These codes are good and can certainly provide initial guidance when faced with 
a professionally based, ethical choice. Where things get tough are when the ethical 
choices presented to you are not addressed in the code. These can be something as 
big as the construction of a high-rise apartment building or something more insidi￾ous like bumping the amount of money claimed on a travel expense account.
What makes engineering ethics slippery is that all three categories can exhibit 
varying amounts of overlap. This is an important realization: the amount and nature 
of corporate, personal, and professional ethical smearing can make what normally 
are clear-cut choices muddled and the engineer befuddled.
To gain some clarity, Richard Daft has helpfully defined a topology of five eth￾ics approaches or belief systems applicable to an engineering organization.5 Briefly, 
they are:
The Virtue Approach
This approach says that moral behavior “stems from personal virtues, given in an 
external law, which is revealed in religious scripture or apparent in nature and then Final Preparations 313

interpreted by religious leaders or humanist philosophers.” If an engineer develops 
good character traits, such as compassion, generosity, or courage, and learns to over￾come negative traits such as greed or anger, he or she will make ethical decisions 
naturally as the result of being a virtuous person.
The Utilitarian Approach
This approach holds that moral behavior produces the greatest good for the greatest 
number. An engineer or decision-maker is expected to consider the effect of each 
decision on all parties and select the one that will optimize the benefits for the great￾est number of people.
On the surface, it sounds quite admirable; making decisions for the greatest good 
for the greatest number has a certain appeal to it, and what can be wrong with that? 
For that reason, many (if not most) large organizations and corporations adopt this 
approach as their normal ethical guideline. A dividend is awarded equally to each 
and every shareholder, a nice and simple rule as no decisions need to be made about 
special circumstances or messy value judgments: just divide the profit by the shares 
and you’re done. However, the utilitarian philosophy may have some serious moral 
concerns. Utilitarianism is based on a strict meritocracy and equality in all things, 
irrespective of their contingencies. Persons should naturally receive benefits in direct 
proportion to their merits. But then, not everyone can be judged on the same compar￾ative scale. Your 75-year-old grandmother with a high school diploma is not able to 
compete in the workplace equally with a 25-year-old coding expert. The utilitarian 
ethic tends to not allow nor have room for exceptions to its strict meritocracy judg￾ment. A company following strict utilitarian ethics without substantial exceptions for 
special cases can quickly become unbalanced and eventually unfair.
Universalist Approach
This framework asserts that all human beings have fundamental rights that cannot 
be taken away by another individual’s decision. Here, an ethically correct decision 
is one that best maintains the rights of those people affected by it. In this system, 
these principles are the right to privacy, the right to free consent, and the right to free 
speech. In a word, everyone would act with an intent based on universal principles.
The Justice Approach
This approach holds that moral standards are based upon the primacy of a single 
value, which is justice. Moral decisions would be based on standards of equity, 
fairness, and impartiality. This involves three types of justice. Distributive Justice
requires that different treatment of people should not be based on arbitrary character￾istics such as race or gender. Procedural Justice requires that rules be administered 
fairly. Compensatory Justice argues that the party responsible for injury or damage 
should compensate individuals for the cost of those damages. Conversely, individu￾als should not be held responsible for matters over which they have no control.Final Preparations 315
The Pragmatic Approach
The Pragmatic Approach is just as the name implies; it avoids debates about what 
is right, good, or just and instead bases decisions on the prevailing standards of the 
engineering profession and larger society, taking the interests of all stakeholders 
into account. A decision is ethical if it is considered acceptable by the professional 
or common community. It is one where a manager would not hesitate to publish their 
actions on a social media site or one that a person would typically feel comfortable 
explaining to family and friends.
A (somewhat alarming) point of view on the Pragmatic Approach impacting per￾sonal ethics comes from Robert Jackall’s Moral Mazes, The World of Corporate 
Managers. Here, the overall theme is that engineers constantly adapt to the social 
environments of their organizations to succeed. In such environments, they have no 
use for abstract ethical principles but conform to the requirements of the company’s 
bureaucracy, which they will tell you is pragmatism. Several important business 
implications follow from this belief. As Jackall bluntly states:
It is hard to see a place for personal ethics in modern organizations at all. The moral 
ethos of managerial circles emerges directly out of the social context [of the corpora￾tion]. It is an ethos most notable for its lack of fixedness. In the … corporate world, 
morality does not emerge from some set of internally held convictions or principles, 
but rather from ongoing, albeit changing relationships with some person, some coterie, 
some social network, some clique that matters to a person. Since these relationships are 
always multiple, contingent, and in flux, managerial moralities are always situational, 
always relative.6
Whoa … This is an extremely important statement regarding relativism and ethics. 
Jackall is saying that many, if not most, corporate managers (including engineering 
managers) will adjust their ethical standards to meet the standards set forth by the 
organization: a person embedded in an organization will tend to take on at least some 
of the ethical characteristics of that group. As we just discussed, companies like the 
utilitarian approach, a structure that avoids those sticky value judgments and calcu￾lates its way out of trouble. And many unconsciously apply the Pragmatic Approach 
simultaneously. If someone will “go along to get along,” that means they are now a 
relativist and therein lies the conflict. Personally, you have a certain belief, but your 
company requires something different. How do you resolve this disconnect, and how 
does this play out in day-to-day office life?
This brings us to one of the most important realizations that individuals in engi￾neering or technical fields will come to, and one of the most earnest points I want to 
share. In the workplace, you will occasionally be presented with an ethical dilemma 
with absolutely no time to ponder it. You must make a decision, many times a dif￾ficult ethical decision, instantaneously. Say your manager (who is known to be vin￾dictive if denied something) may ask you to do something sketchy or even blatantly 
unethical. He or she will probably want an immediate answer. What will you do?
Over the course of your professional life, you’ll collect a number of these experi￾ences. Colleagues have been asked by directors to prepare two versions of the same 316 Navigating the Engineering Organization
report, one reporting bad news and the other version deleting that news, with certain 
individuals receiving one version and others getting the scrubbed edition. Or they’ve 
been asked to issue purchase orders without management approval. Or they’ve been 
asked to make statements that were false. And this, unfortunately, may happen to 
you. What is your response?
I suggest two difficult things:
1) You must have your answers to ethical situations worked out ahead of time, 
and
2) With ethical questions, there should be no moral relativism. Personal ethi￾cal positions should not be contingent.
You’ll be forced to choose a path, most of the time under pressure, that will be either 
expedient and easy, or slow and difficult, or right or wrong. You need to know ahead 
of time which path you are going to take.
CASE EXAMPLE 11.2 THE RISE AND FALL 
OF FLUIDTECH, INCORPORATED
An excellent example of a conflict between an engineering company’s ethics 
and personal morals has to do with a Research and Development Manager 
named Ed Krieger.
Ed led R&D for a company named FluidTech. FluidTech was a “Tier 1” 
(direct) fuel and fluid system supplier to the automotive industry. Their flagship 
product line were fuel systems made of “SuperTube,” a proprietary composite 
invented and patented by Ed’s R&D team, exhibiting unique and superior envi￾ronmental and safety attributes.
FluidTech was a private company new to the automotive market. Founded 
in 1989 and owned by two entrepreneurs, it achieved about $40 million sales 
by 1992. The company was technically unsophisticated but highly motivated 
to succeed in this new business. The company had a good culture with some 
truly exceptional people, and FluidTech offered an interesting opportunity 
for these people to be in on the ground floor of developing new and exciting 
technologies.
FluidTech’s culturally espoused values were, in order of importance:
1) Serve the customer
2) Become the technology leader in automotive fuel systems
3) Grow, grow, grow (they were then doubling sales every 2.5 years).
FluidTech had a culture of egalitarian meritocracy, offering professional 
opportunities to their employees with growth in responsibility and reward 
based on performance. The pay was below average, but the culture and fast 
growth offered their employees an opportunity to progress with substantial Final Preparations 317
freedom, influence within the company, and high levels of authority over their 
areas of responsibility. In short, it was a fun and dynamic place to work.
In the United States automotive fuel and fluid systems marketplace, 
FluidTech faced off against three larger, established competitors. These com￾petitors were old-line manufacturing companies with little R&D competence, 
only offering legacy products.
In automotive fuel systems, there were two major looming technical chal￾lenges. The first was Electro-Static Discharge (ESD). The “racetrack” fuel sys￾tem designs vehicles used at that time supplied more fuel to the engine than 
was needed and returned the unused fuel back to the tank, as in Figure 11.3. 
This resulted in high fuel flow velocities that, under conditions of low tem￾perature and humidity, generated dangerous levels of static electricity resulting 
in “thermal events” (i.e., fires). ESD became a major safety issue when new 
fuel injection systems moved away from heavier traditional materials that were 
conductive (continually eliminating static electricity) to lightweight plastic fuel 
lines that were electrically non-conductive. The solution was to make plastic 
tubing electrically conductive while maintaining other stringent physical and 
chemical properties. This was a challenging materials science problem.
The second impending problem was evaporative fuel emissions, soon to be 
regulated by new United States Clean Air Act standards. Previous emission 
regulations focused on the tailpipe, but by 1995 more hydrocarbon emissions 
came from unburned fuel than the exhaust. Permeation through materials was 
FIGURE 11.3 Racetrack fuel system design. 318 Navigating the Engineering Organization
the issue, and the plastic fuel systems were woefully inadequate to meet the 
pending standard. This was another significant technical problem.
Ed’s team determined what was needed to solve the permeation problem 
and the increasing temperature and chemical resistance requirements was a 
fluoropolymer. However, fluoropolymers were prohibitively expensive and 
failed to meet various physical properties. There were also no acceptable elec￾trically conductive grades available.
Through material science engineering analysis, Ed’s group decided the 
ideal fuel line of the future would be an inner core of a composite combining 
the permeation, chemical, and thermal properties of a fluoropolymer while 
utilizing the strength and economics of polyamide as an outer cover. The prob￾lem was, fluoropolymers were the original nonstick frying pan material (think 
Teflon) and there was no known method of bonding the fluoropolymer to other 
polymers. How do you stick something to a nonstick frying pan?
None of the major plastics companies had a viable fluoropolymer and 
polyamide combination meeting the ESD, permeation, and other stringent 
requirements. FluidTech decided on a bold and costly R&D program to staff a 
high-performance team to figure out how to effectively bond fluoropolymer to 
polyamide to develop the ideal composite structure.
It worked. Ed’s team succeeded in utilizing a mixed gas plasma and other 
technologies to allow the fluoropolymer to bond to the polyamide. Through a 
multi-year engineering initiative, they developed the right composite structure 
to meet the performance goals while bringing superior ESD, permeation, and 
chemical resistance in an economically viable (i.e., highly profitable) material.
Ed’s team patented the process, partnered with a leading fluoropolymer sup￾plier to develop an appropriate conductive grade, and negotiated a global pricing 
agreement based on high volumes to secure economic viability. This success was 
accomplished in just a few years with a series of handshake agreements and a 
strong trust-based relationship between FluidTech and the fluoropolymer supplier.
This product was dubbed “SuperTube” and was protected by a series of U.S. 
and foreign patents preventing competitors from copying the design.
SuperTube was game changing: the only product that solved the ESD prob￾lem and met the new Clean Air Act requirements. SuperTube quickly cap￾tured 96% of the U.S. market share and FluidTech was able to sell coils of the 
composite tubing at high profit to all their competitors, creating a dependency 
and competitive advantage. SuperTube became the flagship product and profit 
engine driving FluidTech’s success.
Over the next several years, FluidTech secured dominant market share sell￾ing to both automakers and FluidTech’s competitors, and eventually delivering 
the entire profit of the company. Ed’s group had found the “holy grail” of R&D, 
creating a system that continued to produce innovative products and competi￾tive advantage, keeping the team and the system together. So, they lived hap￾pily ever after, right?Final Preparations 319
For most startup companies, there comes a time when the initial entrepreneur￾ial owners pass the baton to sophisticated “professional” executive management. 
In 10 years, FluidTech had gone from $10 to $300 million in annual sales and $1 
billion was in sight. While the owners would remain, they realized it was time to 
bring in someone they believed knew how to manage a large company.
Both owners agreed on the particular individual they wanted as the next 
Executive Vice President (EVP) who would make the day-to-day business 
decisions. This incoming EVP (an outside hire) was very well known to Ed. 
Ed had high respect for the intelligence, market development savvy, and pro￾fessional polish of the EVP, but he was deeply concerned about the ethical 
behavior he had witnessed. This EVP had routinely used manipulation, telling 
people things that were not true to get them to act in a way that he desired. This 
is counter to accepted business practices in the United States, was strongly 
counter to the FluidTech culture, and was unacceptable to Ed. The EVP was 
a “moral relativist,” not believing in unchanging right and wrong. He often 
utilized situational ethics, with a track record of reversing previous ethical 
positions when business advantage could be obtained. Once Ed discovered 
who the new EVP would be, he spoke with the major owner about his concerns 
prior to the announcement. The owner downplayed Ed’s concerns but said, “If 
you don't get along with the new EVP, promise me that you will not leave the 
company. I will find another boss for you if you can't get along with the new 
guy.” Ed agreed that if things did not go well, he would not leave without talk￾ing with the owner to work out a new reporting relationship.
Initially the new EVP came in and generally made good decisions. He 
expanded Ed’s managerial authority substantially. For the first six months, he 
was the best boss that Ed had ever had. But as Ed recounted, “Bosses are 
like puppies; they are almost all cute when you first get them, but they don't 
all remain cute later on.” After the initial six months, the EVP began mak￾ing decisions that almost immediately forced Ed into three important ethical 
dilemmas.
The first dilemma revolved around performance reviews (PR) and pay 
increases. At FluidTech, each employee received their annual PR on their date 
of hire and their salary increase was granted immediately following the review. 
The EVP instructed all of the department managers to extend the performance 
review period from 12 months to 18 months while delivering the same percent￾age increase. This meant that a 6% raise after 18 months was equivalent to a 
4% annual raise, so people would really be receiving only two-third of their 
typical performance increase. Ed said that it should be no problem to extend 
the review periods but asked what the explanation to the employees was going 
to be. Were there unexpected expenses the company had to cover, had future 
business contracts not come through, or was there some other reason? The 
EVP’s response was, “I’m not asking you to explain it to them, I’m telling you 
to do it.” Ed was a bit taken aback and mentioned that in the past the employees 320 Navigating the Engineering Organization
had always been willing to endure cost cuts, but that reasons were always pro￾vided, and that doing so without an explanation would hurt morale and pos￾sibly productivity. The EVP told Ed that there would be no explanation, he just 
needed to go do it.
Ed disagreed strongly. What were Ed’s possible options at that point?
1) Go back to the EVP and try to convince him that an explanation was 
needed. Ed felt that another meeting would probably be unsuccess￾ful and would likely create a hostile interaction.
2) Obey the EVP and simply implement the policy with no explanation. 
However, Ed had an understanding with his subordinates that for any 
decisions that affected them, he would seek their input and explain the 
context as much as possible. This path would break that bond of trust.
3) Disobey the EVP and put through the employees’ performance 
reviews and raises on the existing 12-month cadence. This would 
maintain the bond of trust with his employees but be directly insub￾ordinate to his powerful boss, a high-risk option.
4) Go over the EVP’s head to the owner and make the case this was a 
bad decision. Going over a boss’s head is a lot more dangerous than 
it seems. If it doesn’t work, and even if it does, you will likely have 
made a powerful enemy who will not forget. This is an option but a 
very risky one.
5) Ed could leave the company, but you can’t quit your job every time 
you have a couple of bad days in a row. Leaving is always an option 
that must remain on the table. During this first ethical conflict, a 
disagreement at this level would be hard to justify throwing away a 
very enjoyable and successful career.
Ed chose the third option. He disobeyed the EVP and conducted his perfor￾mance reviews on the 12-month cycle, and put in pay increase requests for his 
people that ended up going through. Ed believed that he owed it to his people to 
give them an explanation if their financial livelihood was going to be adversely 
affected. Not being allowed to give such an explanation, he believed the integ￾rity of his relationships with his subordinates was more important than the risk 
of crossing his boss and taking whatever consequences might arise.
The second, more serious dilemma arose a few weeks later, centering on 
whether your word should be considered a binding contract. Ed was able to 
report a new, significant success that he hoped might mend his strained rela￾tionship with the EVP. The automotive supplier industry is a high volume/low 
margin industry, and there had been strong efforts to find low volume/high 
profit, non-automotive market applications for SuperTube. Some very lucrative 
business had been won in the offshore oil industry, where this outside business 
was going to bring in profits of about 65%.
There was an understanding in the agreement with the fluoropolymer sup￾plier that Ed and the EVP had negotiated in a handshake agreement. The Final Preparations 321
agreement stipulated that for automotive applications, FluidTech would pur￾chase the fluoropolymer resins at a very attractive cost, about two-thirds of 
the list price. However, for non-automotive applications, FluidTech would pay 
the full list price. In this case, the increase in fluoropolymer cost would barely 
affect the profits. When Ed reported the new offshore oil business deal, and 
they were going to pay market price for the increased shipment of fluoropoly￾mer resin, the EVP said, “No, we’re not.” Ed was surprised and reminded him 
of the handshake deal they had. The EVP looked him in the eye and said with 
annoyance, “It’s none of their damn business what we do with the resin once 
it hits our door. Buy the resin at the discounted automotive prices and run it.”
This ethical dilemma is based on whether your word is a contract. Ed’s 
options here are similar to the first dilemma:
1) Meet one-to-one again with the EVP to try to convince him. While 
going back to the EVP for a second discussion was a possibility, the 
first discussion was clear. Going back again would more likely re￾open the conflict than result in a solution.
2) Obey the EVP and invoice the fluoropolymer company at the 
reduced automotive pricing. This would result in FluidTech mak￾ing slightly more money, could potentially lead to a reconciliation 
between Ed and the EVP, and the oil industry sales would likely not 
be detected by the fluoropolymer company. Even if they did find out 
FluidTech was supplying the offshore oil industry, FluidTech could 
falsely insist that the resin used came from another company. So, the 
actual risk in terms of punishment of this option was low: this was 
the “easy way out.” The problem was Ed would be directly breaking 
his word and lying to the fluoropolymer company.
3) Disobey the EVP and continue the handshake agreement, invoic￾ing the fluoropolymer company at the higher market pricing. Simply 
paying the list price for the raw material could be done, but Ed could 
be accused of misallocating tens of thousands of dollars of company 
money by paying more for the material than the EVP directed. If Ed 
followed this course and had to explain himself to the owner, there 
would be no avoiding the fact the EVP was breaking his own word. 
It is very unlikely that the dispute in front of the owner would end 
without one of them losing in a very career-damaging way.
4) Go over the EVP’s head to the owner. This option has the same risks 
as before, except here, it would be even more clear to the owner that 
the EVP was lying. The animosity the EVP already had against Ed 
would be that much higher.
5) Leave the company. Resigning at this point begins to become a more 
serious consideration because there are now two important ethi￾cal conflicts. Ed and the EVP are in open conflict and there didn’t 
appear to be an easy resolution.322 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Ed chose the third option again. He directly disobeyed the EVP and directed 
his accounting person to pay the full list price for the supplier’s product used 
in the offshore application. His word was his bond, and if he had committed 
to doing something, he was going to do it. While this option certainly carried 
risk, all the other options were either ethically unacceptable or would be inef￾fective in getting to an ethical solution.
The third and highest stakes ethical dilemma arrived a few weeks later, 
centering on a potential safety recall. FluidTech had been purchasing a certain 
special type of metal tubing from their competitors but had decided to elimi￾nate this dependence by building their own identical product. There were no 
intellectual property concerns and no patents in force. Ed’s R&D organization 
had developed a new replacement material, and this next-generation FluidTech 
tubing went into limited production for a single customer. Soon after launch, 
it was discovered that this new tubing was dimensionally out of specification. 
Ed’s team reported this deviation from specification to the EVP and also stated 
they had immediately embarked on an investigation, subjecting the new tub￾ing to a complete battery of performance and accelerated durability testing. 
The product ended up passing all these performance tests with flying colors. 
Concurrently, service parts were also obtained from the two competitors who 
also manufactured this type of tubing. These two sets of tubing were also 
found to dimensionally deviate in the same way from the specification. Ed 
called a meeting with the EVP and the owner, attended by his R&D Team, to 
discuss the results. Ed explained that all performance testing met the specifi￾cation and that both competitors’ tubing also exhibited similar dimensional 
deviations from the specification. Ed recommended that a report be presented 
to the customer showing the deviation from the specified dimensions but also 
showing that all the performance testing proved that the tubing was safe and 
met requirements, also showing that the existing competitor tubing (that they 
had used for over 30 years) exhibited the same conformation deviation.
By this time, the EVP had begun to see Ed as an opponent because of the 
two previous disagreements, though he had not confronted Ed about these acts 
of insubordination. The EVP proposed a theory as to why the tubing devi￾ated and made the case that he thought the tubing constituted an unacceptable 
safety risk. Ed reviewed all the performance data showing that the tubing was 
not only safe but actually exceeded the performance specification, undermin￾ing the EVP’s theory. The EVP then said, “I wouldn’t let my kids ride in cars 
that have this tubing.” Ed responded, "Okay, then we need to go to the cus￾tomer and tell them that we are not confident in the safety of the product and 
we need to go on the record recommending that they issue a product recall.” 
The EVP said, “We can’t do that.” Incredulous, Ed looked over at the owner 
who had made himself busy counting the holes in the ceiling tiles and would 
not meet Ed’s gaze. Ed looked over at his R&D colleagues and they were wide 
eyed. Ed turned back to the EVP and saidFinal Preparations 323
You can’t have it both ways. Either the tubing is safe, and we go to the carmaker 
and explain the situation and recommend continued production while we inves￾tigate whether the dimensional deviation can be fixed, or we think the tubing is 
dangerous and advocate for a recall.
The EVP glared at Ed and said, “We can’t.” Confused, Ed looked at the EVP 
again and said, “If it’s your judgment that the tubing is unsafe, then we have 
to advocate for recall.” The EVP looked at Ed and said, “We can’t do that. If 
we did, we would go out of business.” Ed looked again at the major owner who 
continued to study the ceiling. Ed then made a brief note of the conversation, 
looked once more at the EVP and the willfully distracted major owner, got up, 
and walked out of the meeting.
While the testing Ed had ordered had clearly shown that the product was 
passing all performance and durability tests, FluidTech’s contract with the 
customer required that FluidTech report any deviations from specification, 
and this deviation fell under this requirement. The EVP had further raised 
the stakes by claiming that he believed that the tubing being produced was in 
fact unsafe, so he had chosen to make this a safety issue despite the test data. 
Depending upon how things played out, this could result in legal action with 
possible penalties affecting both FluidTech and its employees. This could also 
result in a rupture of the relationship with an important customer which could 
threaten FluidTech's survival.
This ethical dilemma is based on honesty to the customer and potentially 
safety. Again, Ed’s options were similar to the choices after the first two dilem￾mas but not identical:
1) Meet one-to-one again with the EVP to try to convince him. This 
option was no longer viable as the owner would need to be involved 
since he had witnessed the acrimonious disagreement. Given the 
open hostility between the EVP and Ed, and the owner avoiding the 
conflict, Ed perceived the chance of a second meeting resolving the 
issue to be negligible.
2) Obey the EVP and not tell the customer about the conformity issue 
which would mean that Ed would be knowingly participating in a 
coverup, with all of the ethical and career risks this choice entails.
3) Disobey the EVP and tell the customer, meaning Ed is acting as a 
“whistleblower” by exposing the lie. If Ed believed the product was 
truly unsafe, there would be no dilemma: he had an obligation to go 
to the customer and expose the issue. However, the tube had easily 
passed all relevant testing, so Ed and his experts were convinced that 
the product was indeed safe, especially given the high engineering 
“safety factor” for this tubing built into the design and specification. 
Ed now believed that EVP had chosen to classify this as a safety issue, 
despite the conclusive contrary test data, as a tactic of bringing the 324 Navigating the Engineering Organization
conflict with Ed to a decisive conclusion by blaming him for a safety 
problem and an existential business risk. That result? Ed would be 
fired.
4) Go over the EVP’s head to the owner, which was unlikely to yield 
success because the owner refused to take any leadership responsi￾bility during the crisis.
5) The fifth option, leaving the company, was clearly on the table and 
could no longer be denied as a serious likelihood. Whether the 
machinations of the EVP could get Ed fired or whether Ed would 
need to leave of his own free will was not clear, but it was now 
unavoidably apparent that his ethical framework was antithetical to 
the direction of the EVP.
Ed’s worst fears about the EVP had come to pass. He drove home and that 
evening called the leader of his R&D team to discuss the meeting. Ed’s R&D 
experts were in shock from what had happened. The next day, Ed had a private 
meeting with the owner.
Ed opened the meeting reminding the owner of the discussion they had 
had when Ed had warned against hiring the new EVP, in which the owner 
had made Ed promise not to leave the company and committed to finding 
him a different boss if things didn’t work out. The owner agreed that he did 
remember the conversation and what he had said. For a brief moment, Ed held 
out hope that he could salvage his fast-rising but now very tenuous career at 
FluidTech. Ed told the owner about all three ethical dilemmas, making clear 
in all three cases the EVP’s direction was unethical, and Ed was unwilling to 
execute the direction that the EVP had given. Ed told the owner that there was 
an impasse: the EVP was unwilling to budge, and Ed was unwilling to follow 
directions he deemed unethical.
Then the surprise. The owner said, “I’ve placed my bet on the new EVP 
to run this company. You guys need to find a way to work things out. I’m not 
going to give you another boss. You two have to work things out.” At that 
moment, Ed realized there was no way out; he felt almost physically sick real￾izing that the bright future he had at FluidTech was now ashes.
He looked at the owner, and with effort, kept his voice level, said “Then I’m 
going to give myself another boss. This is my two weeks’ notice. Thank you 
for the opportunities you have given me over the last nine years.” The owner 
was taken aback. He said that he didn’t want that to happen, and he would meet 
with Ed to talk further the next morning. But Ed knew it was over.
The next morning, the EVP showed up in Ed’s office. He told Ed that he had 
spoken with the owner, there was nothing more to say, and he wanted Ed gone 
right away. After a difficult goodbye with his shocked team, Ed left FluidTech, 
deeply concerned about the future of the company, his many friends there, and 
not knowing what the future would hold for himself personally.Final Preparations 325
Ed may ask: “What did you do about the third dilemma?” Ed’s answer was 
that he was completely convinced that there was no safety issue based upon all 
the test data and the competitive products that had been in the field for decades 
with the same dimensional deviation.
Once he left FluidTech, he never found out what they did about either talk￾ing to their customer or attempting to hide the deviation.
Now let’s turn our attention to the fallout from these ethical dilemmas. 
First, what happened to FluidTech over the next several years?
The hiring of the EVP dramatically changed the values, culture, and envi￾ronment of FluidTech. Under the EVP’s leadership, the relationship with the 
supplier fluoropolymer company deteriorated rapidly. The fluoropolymer com￾pany ended the handshake agreement they had with Ed on working exclu￾sively with FluidTech and began working to develop a competitive product 
to SuperTube, which they licensed to FluidTech’s competitors, eliminating 
FluidTech’s most profitable product: selling bulk SuperTube to the competi￾tion. It also introduced price competition eroding FluidTech’s profit margins 
when they sold to the automotive companies. FluidTech’s most powerful profit 
engine was rapidly reduced to a small fraction in a two-year period.
Relationships with the most important automotive customers also deterio￾rated rapidly under the EVP. The previous “serve the customer” cultural value 
attenuated under the EVP, and FluidTech increasingly failed to win new busi￾ness, stopping their decade-plus run of doubling in size every 2.5 years.
Most important was the effect the EVP’s leadership had on the employees of 
FluidTech. While Ed was not the first senior manager to depart, his resignation 
was quickly followed by a wave of other key management departures driven by 
the EVP’s changes to company culture and values. Shortly after the flight of key 
managers, a large-scale exodus of the leading technical people took place.
A few months later, the EVP was demoted, and shortly thereafter demoted 
a second time and then fired. He was replaced by a second EVP who reached 
out to Ed and some of the other key managers who had left, trying to convince 
them to return. An interview made it clear to Ed that the second EVP and his 
team had no real understanding of the company and that they would be unable 
to turn things around. Shortly thereafter, the company went into bankruptcy. 
FluidTech was bought out of bankruptcy by a notorious turnaround firm, expe￾rienced a grueling season of investment and employee cuts and, with no sig￾nificant new business on the books, the remnants of the company were peddled 
to an unsophisticated old-line manufacturing company for a tidy profit. The 
original owner, who had been worth about $100 million, ended up working for 
a salary at the turnaround firm and then retired.
Most importantly, what happened to Ed? Ed was 33 years old when he left 
FluidTech. He ended up at a major automotive company with global responsi￾bility for upstream research partnerships. The job was exceptionally reward￾ing, and also allowed him the flexibility he desired.326 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Now here’s something you may not yet have thought of.
Ed had a young son, a second child on the way, and his spouse worked 
half time. When he returned home after resigning, rather than complaining, 
criticizing, or worrying, his wife responded, “Good! I’m glad you’re gone from 
that place.” Ed was inclined to immediately search for another job, but his wife 
(whom he always described as being “the wiser of the two of us”) urged him to 
join her during her pending maternity leave to take some time and really figure 
out what he wanted to do next and give himself a chance to detoxify from the 
recent past. The job market was strong, and Ed turned away several serious 
opportunities, took his wife’s advice, and took maternity leave with her. They 
strictly controlled their expenses, dipping cautiously into savings.
As a result, Ed learned to be a more purposeful husband and father as he deter￾mined what he would like to do during the next phase of his career. Looking back, 
Ed had the same reaction to FluidTech that many military veterans have to their 
time at war: he would never do it again, but he wouldn’t trade the experience for 
anything. As unpleasant as it was at the end, Ed was able to leave the company 
with his ethics intact, knowing he had done what he believed to be right.
So, what are the takeaways from our journey with FluidTech? There are 
many. First, there is an absolute certainty that over the course of your working 
career, your personal ethics will be tested. You cannot avoid this fact by saying 
you’ll never do anything that would put yourself at ethical risk, because in the 
majority of cases you will not have any control over a dilemma being thrust 
upon you. To paraphrase Leon Trotsky’s famous quote regarding war:
“You may not be interested in ethics, but ethics is interested in you.”
Next, it is imperative that you determine your ethics before a dilemma arises. 
It’s radically more difficult to figure out (and have the courage to do) the right 
thing in the midst of an immediate, high-stress situation with angry execu￾tives and your career on the line. From the military and athletics we know 
that, in times of extreme stress, you revert to your training. In the middle of 
a dilemma, you really don’t have the time nor necessarily the mental focus to 
think carefully about ethics. You need to be able to instantly revert to an iron￾clad ethical code that you determined long before the crisis.
Another learning is if you ever truly need a job, you may be in deep trouble 
because you will do whatever it takes to keep that job rather than stay on your 
ethical path.
Importantly, most ethical choices in technology and engineering are not 
simple nor obvious: notice the many pages and level of detail required to tell 
the story of FluidTech. Ethical problems can exist deep in your organization or 
work: it may be hard to even describe the issue, let alone deal with it effectively.
It bears repeating: many times, ethical dilemmas require an immediate 
decision, response, or action on your part, be it a difficult question from an Final Preparations 327
authority figure, taking an “innocent” action, or agreeing to do something 
sketchy. The common factor here is that you will not have any time to ponder 
your answer; you will be forced to choose a path immediately. Your ethics 
must be firmly in place before a crisis arrives.
The Fluid Tech story highlights something else that may not be apparent: 
an organizational or corporate ethical issue becoming entangled with personal 
ethical choices. Rarely is a personal ethical dilemma neatly separated from the 
organizational problem. For Ed, the choice was to do what the organization 
said and remain employed or take a personal stand and likely suffer punish￾ment. In the FluidTech case, the company’s unethical behavior led directly to 
the loss of the highly valued employee.
Here’s probably the most important point regarding ethics: personal ethics 
is the one area of this book that does not follow contingency theory. “Moral 
relativism” and “situational ethics” are a trap; it’s easy to apply them as a ratio￾nalization to justify wrong or unethical behavior. “Everyone else was doing it” 
is not an ethical justification; it’s merely an excuse.
Finally, you will make ethical mistakes. Fix them and remain committed 
to your path.
A personal note. Remember, Ed and his wife had a small child and one on the 
way. Ed’s wife was working part time, and soon to be on extended leave. Savings 
were slim. It’s one thing to take a stand on principle when there is money in the 
bank. It’s quite another to come home, look your spouse in the eye and say: “I quit 
my job over an ethical issue.” That’s where the strength of your relationships out￾side of your workplace becomes critical. As mentioned, workplace ethical issues 
can easily flow into your home and may cause additional stress and heartache,
Let’s change gears for a moment. What about corporate ethics and its impact 
on you in the workplace? Before the arrival of ubiquitous digital information, 
many corporations (and their employees) would attempt to hide embarrassing 
or even illegal information from public view. With the onset of digital data, it 
is effectively impossible to hide corporate or personal information for even a 
short amount of time: anyone who thinks so is sadly, sadly mistaken. In today’s 
ethical reality, this means whatever information you have, be it good or bad, 
embarrassing or positive, people will eventually know about it; the only ques￾tion will be how quickly they obtain it.
It is amazing how even today, certain organizations have the hubris to 
attempt to hide deleterious information from investigators or the general pub￾lic. A recent example has to do with the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal 
uncovered in 2014. The company purposely installed an emissions-altering 
software system in Volkswagen diesel engines to defeat European government 
pollution requirements. Apparently, Volkswagen management thought this 
software could be hidden forever. It wasn’t. As of this writing, this mistake of 
arrogance cost Volkswagen and its related brands a total of some $34.7 billion 
to date in fines and untold costs in reputational damage.7328 Navigating the Engineering Organization
We’ve spent a lot of time on personal morals, so what about professional 
ethics? We should take a moment and touch on the ethics of the engineering 
profession as opposed to strictly personal or corporate ethics.
With the rise of digital information is a corresponding rise in the public’s 
expectation of transparency in all we do professionally. Every professional act 
has the potential to be examined, including your own. Simply put, conduct 
your professional life with the certain expectation that all your work will come 
to light, if not to the public, then certainly to your boss. In short, it’s foolish to 
attempt to hide major mistakes or missteps.
One last point. Professional ethics are unique in that they fall squarely 
between personal and corporate morals: both organizational and personal 
points are mentioned as shared in Table 11.2. This is good, but not totally 
sufficient. While professional ethics guidelines are a good place to start when 
beginning to develop your initial values framework, it is only a starting point. 
You will have to eventually move on to the personal moral constructs to “flesh 
out” a workable, strong point of view.
Obviously, ethics are overwhelmingly personal, but I think you would agree 
there are some ethical positions you may prefer over others. Whatever the case, 
the important point is to actively begin to address your moral or ethical posi￾tions now. You’ll need it soon.
11.5 REALIZATIONS
We’ve spent substantial time discussing two important ideas you need to absorb 
before you can finally create your personal roadmap: connecting the components 
of the core into a strong, dependable, holistic model of mutual understanding and 
dependency, and then applying a capstone of personal ethical considerations to your 
model. These final steps will complete the preparations for you to develop your per￾sonal guide, the navigation tool you will use each day transitioning into the profes￾sional ranks. The good news is that neither of these tasks is particularly difficult. 
Establishing the obvious linkages between components is straightforward, and 
developing your personal ethical understanding is fundamentally simple once you 
understand the main points of ethical belief and behavior. The only challenge is 
applying some mindfulness to both these activities.
Combining the individual components of the Essential Engineering Framework 
requires understanding the purpose, characteristics, and limitations of each compo￾nent well enough to naturally and quickly see the dependencies between them. And 
not just the obvious ones, but the hidden connections as well. That’s what melding 
the components means.
Note that not everyone has the same definition of connecting the components: your 
definition may be different from that of your colleagues or boss. Ensuring consistent 
definitions is your first task with any assignment involving joining components together. 
This means that no matter how quick the evaluation deadline is, you need to pause and 
think about it. Sensemaking may help. It is an attempt to reduce multiple meanings and Final Preparations 329
handle the complex information used by other people in your organization. This 
means strategies, plans, rules, and goals are not things that exist objectively, but 
within a group member’s way of thinking. In sensemaking, whether someone’s view 
of the world is correct is not relevant: the correctness of a position is contingent on 
the personal filters used for evaluation. The basic idea of sensemaking is that reality 
is an ongoing realization that emerges from individual’s efforts, meaning organizing 
is a continuous, evolutionary process with the goal of reducing confusion by plac￾ing limitations upon the organization as they make sense of themselves and their 
environment. Communication becomes doubly important because of its role in this 
sensemaking process.
Our second idea, personal ethics, is one of the most important subjects you will 
wrestle with. Personal ethics establishes a strong boundary between acceptable 
behavior and actions that would be damaging to yourself and others. While corpo￾rate and professional ethics also impact your work life, it is your personal ethics that 
will have the greatest impact on most aspects of your work life.
As our examples show, ethics can be quite complex, demanding a response that 
you may not have time to develop. Personal ethics can be buried deep within techni￾cal decision-making. And ethics can literally change your life if you do not under￾stand them.
Most importantly, ethics are the one topic that does not follow contingency the￾ory. They are constant and unchanging in a contingent world; relativistic ethics is 
a siren song of behavior. Do not be fooled by its lure of easy solutions to whatever 
situation you are experiencing.
Personal ethics will cause you to experience some uncertainty that making your 
way in a technical organization brings. This is normal. After all, uncertainty results 
from change, and change is what we’re after. It’s simple: if you don’t know, then you 
need to educate yourself on what understanding you are missing and fill in the miss￾ing knowledge
Enough moralizing. Let’s get on with creating your roadmap.

12 Crafting the Roadmap
Creating Your 
Personal Guide
12.1 CONSTRUCTING YOUR ROADMAP
At last, it’s time to take some action: gathering what we’ve discussed and creat￾ing your personal roadmap, designed to get you over the Great Divide and navigate 
through the organization you’ve just joined. But this leaves us with just one ques￾tion: How do we actually create that roadmap for you and your individual company? 
How in the world can you develop a workable roadmap incorporating who you are 
and your own personal understanding of your engineering organization? Where is 
the checklist, the process document, the instructions you can follow, or the boxes to 
check off as you complete each step? In short, what do you do next?
No worries, we’ll get there.
Let’s first define what a personal roadmap is. Most personal guidance plans are a 
variant of the business roadmap, which is a strategic document defining a corporate 
goal and the major steps necessary to achieve it over time. Much like its corporate 
cousin, personal roadmaps are touted as “personal action plans” featuring highly 
prescribed steps to achieving individual goals. Filled with checklists, milestones, 
and your own “mission statements,” these highly codified plans are reassuring and 
comforting. They are also goal based, sterile, and relentlessly rational. And that’s not 
what we’re talking about here.
For us, a roadmap is a framework of you and your organization, broken down 
into components to which are applied your current and desired characteristics in 
the future, and identifying the actions needed to achieve them. Our approach to the 
individual roadmap is about gaining organizational skills, not objectives or goals. 
It’s about personal development as a professional engineer. And it’s simple. We take 
the five components from the Essential Engineering Framework, add to it the com￾mon functions and skills needed to successfully operate within each component, and 
assess how each skill stacks up against your current and future capabilities. This 
identifies the action you need to take within each component. Ultimately, it’s about 
insight: insight into your current engineering organization, and most importantly, 
awareness of yourself as a new engineer.
Let’s break this down. We already know what the five components are. Functions 
and skills are quite easy to identify: they are the topics we’ve already discussed in 
Chapters 5 through 10. We then add to those skills your contingency topics; those

abilities that are unique to you and your situation that are not specifically covered in 
this book. Add to the roadmap your ethical positions, and your guide is complete.
What we haven’t really discussed yet is this roadmap is time-based, containing a 
starting point (your situation today) and an ending point (a time somewhere in your 
future). Your knowledge today and your desired knowledge tomorrow; your capabili￾ties now and your needed capabilities in the future. Your roadmap will include both 
these points in time.
You see, a roadmap is no good if it is stuck at a single moment. You change, 
the organization changes, your colleagues change, and so does the environment. 
Everything shifts, sometimes rapidly, and your roadmap must be flexible enough to 
provide for that change. Otherwise, your map would be valid for about three months 
and then quickly become more and more irrelevant. So, you will be assessing your￾self at two points in time: now and then.
Just like the difference between structures and frameworks discussed in Chapter 
4, we’ll take the same approach to developing your plan. Your roadmap is a frame￾work, not a structure. Remember, a framework is able to absorb the ongoing contin￾gencies and unique boundaries that a structure cannot, which is essential for what 
you are about to do.
So, let’s begin. Here’s the framework:
Section 1
1) Schedule at least one hour of uninterrupted time in a comfortable location.
2) If you have not yet done so, select and complete at least three of the six 
self-assessments we’ve covered: Myers-Briggs, Five Factors, Thomas￾Kilmann, Gardner Multiple Intelligences, Demographics, and Bolling 
4-Step Exploration, found in Chapters 2, 3, and 6. This is not optional. 
A self-assessment is an important first step in determining the time and 
energy investment you are about to make. It can drastically reduce the work 
you need to accomplish in creating your map, as you can ignore certain 
irrelevant personal characteristics and focus on others. It can also identify 
aspects of yourself you may have yet to realize. Make a summary of each 
self-assessment and keep it close by.
3) Also have a copy of the Essential Engineering Framework handy. You may 
need to refer to it during your evaluation.
4) Create a modifiable copy of Table 12.1. You may download one at the 
Roadmap Creation Template” within the Ancillaries section of the 
Routledge website at https://www.routledge.com/9781032102511. This will 
be the start of your plan.
5) Select the time frame you intend your map to be valid. Obviously, your 
starting point is today; your ending point can be a moment in time, attain￾ing a certain professional position (becoming a respected worker, senior 
engineer, supervisor, or technical specialist) or any other meaningful sign￾post of your future. Add this to your table.
6) Each of the five components is divided into two types: the standard skills
derived from our prior component discussions and unique skills supporting Crafting the Roadmap 333

your current and future positions stemming from your current role and what 
role you wish to attain. Say part of your current position requires you to evalu￾ate end-customers’ use of a new keyboard design. The required skill is to probe 
behind the customer’s façade and get at their true feelings about using the prod￾uct. In the future, you will still need this talent. Here, it’s appropriate to place 
“verbal evaluation skills” as a topic in the unique portion of the map.
7) If a unique skill is needed today but not in the future, list it. Conversely, if 
you anticipate a capability will be needed in the future but not today, still 
list it. The key is to list as many unique skills as appropriate, now and for 
the future.
8) Dependent on the time spent so far in your engineering organization, there 
may not be many entries in the unique area. This is fine, as this chart will 
become a living document and many more unique capabilities will be added 
over time.
9) Set the roadmap aside for a few days.
Section 2
10) As before, reserve at least one hour of quiet time in a calm location. Do not 
allow interruptions.
11) On your map, focus only on the columns “Current Location in Organization.” 
Do not consider the “Future Position” columns at this time.
12) The next steps are quite easy. For each component skill and capability 
shown, honestly and truthfully assess if that specific skill is needed in your 
current position and if so, what is your current mastery of that topic. If no

knowledge or skill, place a “0”; if you are a master of that domain, place 
a “5.” Do this realistically. Be sure to place your mark where you are cur￾rently at, not where you hope to be. Don’t be surprised if most of your 
self-evaluation scores are very low. Remember, you are assessing if that 
skill is needed now, and if so, what is your current capability. Do this for all 
standard and unique skills listed.
13) Now return to the top and repeat his procedure for the “Future” columns. 
This should be a much more uncertain assessment; some may be indetermi￾nate. This is normal; just evaluate with the same honesty as before.
14) Do not add any of these ratings together to create some sort of “summary” 
grade or overall score. This is not a contest.
15) This last step is even easier and more obvious: select the current vs. future 
self-evaluations ratings, search for the greatest differences between the two, 
and then decide what actions you must take to close the gap. Make a note of 
these and place them in an easy-to-access location.
16) And voilà, a map of the path through the engineering organization, cus￾tomized for you and your reality. It is a summary of organizational skills, 
focused on the five components of the inner core, estimating the type and 
amount of personal skill needed.
Well, actually that’s not totally it. The challenge now is to consider exactly how you 
close the gaps you’ve identified. Dependent on the particular gap and the level of 
skill required to master the topic, it may be as simple as taking an approved company 
training class (such as extending your coding skills) all the way to completing a one 
or two-year rotational assignment (say, a sensor design and implementation position). 
No matter what the gap actually is, you need to become educated on the topic, which 
means adopting a “curious” frame of mind. And like that investigative reporter we 
discussed earlier, you should take the initiative to accomplish this. No one will come 
and tell you to do this. You are on your own.
One final note about the roadmap. As mentioned earlier, this is not a “one and done” 
process. We all change, some quickly and some slowly. Sometimes our rate of change 
begins slowly and accelerates, other times we begin with a sprint and end with a crawl. 
Whatever the case, you should revisit your map periodically and update it to who you 
now are at that moment. Your Myers-Briggs assessment will change, so will your Five 
Factor assessment. And your map will (and should) change as well. You pick the time 
interval or goal, but the key is actually revisiting the work. Return to this exercise peri￾odically as your experiences grow and you continue to gain personal insights.
CASE EXAMPLE 12.1 CONTAINERIZED SHIPPING
We need to run through an example. Imad Makki is a new hire, working for the 
past nine months as a bachelors-level electrical engineer. He is part of an effort to 
develop a breakthrough logistics system for containerized ocean-going vessels, to 
address the continuing supply chain issues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 338 Navigating the Engineering Organization
As of 2021, the number of cargo container ships operating worldwide stood 
at a combined capacity of about 24.6 million 20 ft containers. Additionally, 
since 2000 the average vessel size of container ships has more than doubled, 
until today the largest container ships can carry about 24,000 of those 20 ft. 
containers each.1 If successful, this new logistics system would expand the 
number of sensors placed on each standard 20-foot container to over 400, or 
some 9.6 million sensors per ship. These sensors would do everything, from 
controlling the interior temperature and humidity environment of each con￾tainer (reducing spoilage due to excessive heat during long-distance voyages), 
to providing pin-point positioning of every parcel in a container and its condi￾tion. A game-changing innovation but also a substantial challenge due to the 
very large amount of data to be continuously monitored.
Imad has a typical engineering background, completing his bachelor’s 
degree in 4.5 years, focused on electrical engineering with a GPA of 3.56. 
His classes were overwhelmingly technical: only two composition or writ￾ing classes, one presentation class, and two unrestricted electives in which he 
selected technology-related subjects. While he was a member of many class￾room teams, the average duration of these teams was three months, composed 
of group members he already knew. His single capstone course in product 
design was of mixed success due to two group members electing to not con￾tribute to the group, leaving the other members to cover the extra assigned 
roles.
While a student, Imad spent one summer as an intern in the main office of 
a national civil engineering and construction firm. His 10-week internship was 
a disappointment: he converted stress simulation data into bar charts for man￾agement reviews. While he was able to attend these management meetings, his 
field experience was limited to “tours” of construction sites with other interns.
Imad wishes to spend his career in this logistics engineering specialty, but 
being a new hire, he is uncertain at this moment what his personal path for￾ward should be. He does know he would like to eventually lead a group of ana￾lysts in logistics systems improvement, but at an uncertain time in the future. 
With this as a starting point, Imad creates the following map:
The Technology System
In the standard categories, Imad has introductory knowledge in design, opera￾tions, and data analysis. In the unique functions, he has good skills in digital 
communication and low capabilities in C++ coding. He anticipates in his next 
position he will need knowledge in sensors, instrumentation, electronic design, 
and improved data analytics. Case Example Table 12.1a shows the resulting 
Technology System chart for Imad at this point.
Imad discovers two things: First, his existing knowledge and capabilities 
are substandard in all but one category. He needs education and experience 
in the remaining 11 to attain at least a minimum competency rating, giving Crafting the Roadmap 339
him the insights to prioritize the improvements he needs to accomplish. Imad 
needs to prioritize the 11 categories in rank order to systematically improve his 
technical skills standing.
The future lead engineer position assessment is more interesting. Twelve 
categories need attention, requiring enhanced skills to attain an appropri￾ate future skill set. Note that some categories need competence, other skills 
merely an awareness. The Operations category needs expert knowledge but the 
C++ category, interestingly, becomes irrelevant.
With the number of technical skills needing improvement, Imad (in asso￾ciation with his supervisor) needs to create a more formal development and 
education plan with appropriate time reserved to improve these ratings.

The Formal Organization
Knowledge and capability in understanding the formal organization are obvi￾ous. Let’s take a look at Imad’s case.
At his starting point, Imad essentially has no knowledge of the formal orga￾nization. This is to be expected, as his engineering school did not teach orga￾nization theory and his internship omitted it in the short time he was present. 
Here, he has a larger deficit to overcome than with the Technical System. Imad 
has very limited knowledge of organizational structures (only the hierarchy) 
and some industry standards. Overall, he has essentially no unique skills in 
this component. He anticipates his next position will require at least a basic 
knowledge in the standard categories, but again he has no idea of the skills 
required at that future time. Case Example Table 12.1b represents his current 
and future state of affairs.

On examination of his roadmap, Imad became alarmed: his existing knowl￾edge and capabilities in the formal organization were nonexistent, and he was 
very uncertain as to what unique skills he needed to concentrate on for the 
future, other than “everything.” He needs education, quickly. He begins to 
“interview” a wide range of individuals, similar to the self-assessment dis￾cussed in Chapter 3. These interviews are not formal: they are informal con￾versations with peers, a range of engineers, experienced supervisors, engineers 
in different groups, and especially any administrative assistants who may exist 
somewhere in the organizations. It means being curious. Now is the time for 
Imad to be that engineering anthropologist.
Human and Hard Resources
Things are faring better for Imad in the Human and Hard Resources zone, as he 
had some exposure to the hard resources area while at his internship but noth￾ing in the human category other than a six-month performance review. One of 
Imad’s hard resources tasks was to reconcile actual invoices for equipment and 
services rendered against their budget to determine if any funds were being under￾spent, creating some discretionary money for the department. He understood basic 
accounting principles from his one engineering economy course and could calcu￾late net present value and hurdle rates but not much more. Any understanding of 
human resources subjects was essentially zero. He knows for the future he needs 
substantial skill in understanding and practicing engineering group management. 
Case Example Table 12.1c defines his path through this important area.
Thankfully, Imad’s current skill level in the human and hard resources area 
is average for a person with only nine months of company experience. At this 
point, the Human Resources department is still a mystery, and hard resources 
are still controlled by the supervisor or manager. In these areas, hands-on, 
“learning by doing” is the only realistic way of gaining the necessary skills to 
improve his capability over time. This means Imad should volunteer for simple 
budgeting tasks to relieve his supervisor of this normally onerous work.
For a future group leader position, the necessary human resources expe￾rience is harder to obtain. To pursue the group leader position involves the 
paradigm of promotion discussed in Chapter 3: Imad must acquire the human 
behavior skills to run a group before he can actually run it. To break this cycle, 
Imad should ask for minor human resources-related tasks, nothing too impor￾tant or sensitive yet, and practice this craft. He needs to ask for advice within 
his department and elsewhere. Once again, Imad should be that anthropologist 
and uncover the essential skills he needs in this soft subject.
The Hidden Organization
This category is really hard to assess, not only in absorbing the basic skills 
to work within it but to even see it. Luckily, no one expects a new engineer 
to operate successfully in the hidden organization until a year or two after 342 Navigating the Engineering Organization
onboarding, as obtaining these skills can’t be taught: they must be learned 
through daily experience.
Here, Imad’s assessment of his current knowledge is easy to map: he has 
none. In the standard categories shown in Case Example Table 12.1d, he needs 
to begin to even understand what the categories are. In the unique function 
area, his goal is to just get a handle on the special cultural forces in play.
In his next position, he anticipates he will need knowledge of the basic 
cultural cues, subcultures, models of culture, ownership and social rites, just 
enough to know how to avoid the basic landmines.

The good news is that absorbing the corporate culture and group subculture 
is not on a strict timetable. Unlike a SMART objective, a new hire can’t declare 
“By December 31st, I will have a 3rd level capability in identifying specific cul￾tural types.” Instead, a novice like Imad adopts a mindset to continuously look 
for examples of cultural impacts and, more importantly, what do those mark￾ers mean. Imad begins to see the benefit of observation and reconciliation of 
actions and meanings. As suggested previously, he resolves to be more curious.
Ubiquitous Communications
This brings Imad to his next category: communication. Fortunately for him, 
Imad already had some natural advantages in his area. In school, he had no 
reluctance to speak up in class; at university, he was vice president of a student 
service organization which required him to make short, verbal presentations 
to groups of strangers. In these areas at least, Imad was not a strict novice. 
For the other areas of communication, including identifying unique skills,

Imad lacked experience. For future communication skills, Imad only had a 
fuzzy idea that he needed to know “all matters great and small.” The resulting 
assessment looked like Case Example Table 12.1e.
On examining his roadmap, Imad discovers that his communication skills 
are not as good as he thought they might be. While he was familiar with a cer￾tain subsegment of communication (ad hoc presentations), he didn’t know that 
certain communication categories even existed. He needs education and expe￾rience in the remaining skills to attain at least a minimum competency rating. 
Again, this insight allows him to prioritize the work he needs to do. In consul￾tation with his supervisor, Imad needs to take specific communications train￾ing, including presentation techniques, and request every opportunity to speak 
and communicate in public and in a variety of inter-organizational situations.
Ethics
Upon arrival, a new employee needs to have at least a rudimentary understand￾ing of their individual ethical makeup. Both an individual’s current and future

“values of self” inform and bind all the assessments they make within the 
five components. Both consciously and unconsciously, an individual’s beliefs 
condition their roadmap. In a nutshell, knowledge of self and a person’s ethi￾cal framework are critical boundaries and ground rules for creating a valid 
roadmap.
Imad is no exception. Fortunately for him, Imad attended a secondary 
school that offered two courses in philosophy and ethics. Imad took both, 
coming away with a decent understanding of the role both subjects can play 
in corporate life. As a result, Imad believes his ethical beliefs are appropriate 
for him at this time, and his future knowledge should build upon his existing 
foundational belief. While he knows he might be tested, he has reasonable 
confidence in his response, demonstrated in Case Example Table 12.1f.
So, there it is: a completed road map of where Imad believes he is today and 
where he wants to be tomorrow. Systematically, Imad deconstructed the neces￾sary organizational skills and capabilities, assessed himself today, and began 
to consider the skills he needs to achieve operational competency within his 
organization at a certain future point in time.
A few notes are in order. First, obviously this is not meant to be a precise 
exercise revealing an accurate “answer.” This is about gaining a skill in map￾ping your current abilities and assessing your way forward, and practice like 
this hones that skill. Second, as mentioned earlier, this roadmap should be 
revisited periodically. Each iteration will produce ever-better and higher-con￾fidence results. Remember, this process is like a physician: always “practicing” 
the art of medicine to learn more about how to best improve a patient’s health.

Finally, this process should make you a bit uncomfortable. After all, this is 
what it’s designed to do. Forcing new professionals to earnestly face their areas 
of skill (or non-skill) gets them closer to having a quality roadmap to handle 
the many situations coming their way.
12.2 CROSSING THE DIVIDE: TURNING INSIGHT INTO ACTION
There is a very old phrase that is appropriate here: “Talk is cheap, but action is 
priceless”: it is easier to talk about doing something than actually doing it. Many say 
they will do something but never do. Others say that something should be done, but 
they never envision themselves as the individual to do it. This roadmap is a prime 
example.
At this point, we have a defined framework, forged links between components, 
and developed a list of do’s and don’ts for each component. We have shared a process 
to develop a personal map to find a way across the Divide. But all this is of limited 
value unless these insights can be put into action, to do something with this knowl￾edge. Something that can be applied, especially on a moment’s notice, a solid path 
forward that addresses the barriers and contingencies within each situation and how 
to plow a way through it.
The famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, in his memoir The Spirit of St. Louis
tells the story of his decision to make the takeoff to start his nonstop trip across the 
Atlantic. He wrote of his great uncertainty in making the attempt, especially the many 
others who had crashed and died over the weeks before his own attempt. He wrote:
THIRTY REVOLUTIONS Low! The engine’s vibrating roar throbs back through the 
fuselage and drums heavily on taut fabric skin. I close the throttle and look out at tense 
faces beside my plane. Life and death lies mirrored in them – rigid, silent, waiting for 
my word. Thirty revolutions low – a soft runway, a tail wind, an overload … The wind 
changed at daybreak, changed after the Spirit of St. Louis was in take-off position on 
the west side of the field, changed after all those barrels of gasoline were filtered into 
the tanks, changed from head to tail - five miles an hour tail! Taking off from west to 
east with a tail wind is dangerous enough - there are only telephone wires and a road 
at the far end of the field, but …
A missing cylinder and – “Hit a house. Crashed. Burned.” – I can hear the pilots 
saying it – the end of another transatlantic flight.
I lean against the side of the cockpit and look ahead, through the idling blades of the 
propeller, over the runway’s wet and glistening surface … . A curtain of mist shuts off 
all trace of the horizon. Wind, weather, power, load – a balancing act.
Wind, weather, power, load – gradually these elements stop churning in my mind. It’s 
less a decision of logic than of feeling, the kind of feeling that comes when you gauge 
the distance to be jumped between two stones across a brook. Something within you 
disengages itself from your body and travels ahead with your vision to make the test. 
You can feel it try the jump as you stand looking. Then uncertainty gives way to the 
conviction that it can or can’t be done. Sitting in the cockpit, in seconds, minutes long, 
the conviction surges through me that the wheels will leave the ground, that the wings 
will rise above the wires, that it is time to start the flight. I buckle my safety belt, pull Crafting the Roadmap 347
goggles down over my eyes, turn to the men at the blocks, and nod. Frozen figures leap 
to action. A yank on the ropes – the wheels are free. I brace myself against the left side 
of the cockpit, sight along the edge of the runway, and ease the throttle wide open. 
Now, in seconds, we’ll have the answer. Action brings confidence and relief.
2
Action does bring confidence and relief. Taking action is hard. It takes practice, lots 
of practice. As I just said, it’s easy to read and talk; it’s hard to actually do. You are 
going to make mistakes before you get it right, and that may take some time. And 
while it may be frustrating to do this work but not get an immediate benefit, learning 
how to take action will pay increasing dividends from the day you begin until you 
become a master at handling different professional situations. What you can expect 
in applying these guidelines and taking action include:
1) Certain early failure
2) Slow progress
3) Frequent forgetting to apply underlying principles
4) Struggle for patience
5) Relief when a single action finally works out
6) Intense satisfaction when beginning to avoid a mistake or dodge a bullet
7) Remembering those failed experiences for future use
Some may become frustrated with this roadmap. Today, there tends to be a high 
expectation from digital natives: that of instant answers and more importantly, 
instant truth. Ask a question on Google: you get hundreds of immediate answers 
(even if some are wrong). Doing your banking now requires a single click, taking 
2.3 seconds to execute. Dinner magically arrives at your door in 30 minutes or less. 
But these are conveniences that unfortunately lead to an expectation that meaningful 
personal work is equally instantaneous. This personal work should have a different 
kind of expectation: one requiring continuous, sometimes uncomfortable, serious 
and meaningful effort. It is an investment in yourself that may not come easily.
The key point here is to not give yourself an excuse to avoid taking any action except 
reading this book. Taking action is where the benefit of this work is truly found.
It’s time to move on, but before we do, I’m going to leave you with a simple 
question:
What are you going to do?
12.3 REALIZATIONS
As you have seen, developing your roadmap is a fundamentally simple process. It’s 
a process of “start here (today) and go there (the future),” identifying your skills and 
capabilities in each component, bounded by an ethical boundary. Remember, the 
entire point in creating your map is in actually performing the analysis. There is no 
correct or incorrect answer, only an answer representing a point in time that will 
be readdressed, reconsidered, and weighed against ongoing organizational experi￾ence. The value is in defining what the “today” is, and what the future means, and 348 Navigating the Engineering Organization
untangling the interconnecting pathways between the components through the lens 
of self and your ethical framework.
To do this, you must practice the difficult and uncomfortable skill of moving 
from the strictly quantitative to the qualitative. Develop your roadmap in sections 
or pieces: remember, this is not an exercise in efficiency but an investigation into 
identity. Attempt to sensitize yourself to a more holistic view of your work and by 
extension, yourself. As you’ve heard before, embrace the uncertainty, apply mind￾fulness to this roadmap, and know that you are conducting an investigative process.
That said, let’s now look at what’s ahead and see some “previews of coming 
attractions”.

13 Coming Attractions
13.1 PREVIEWS OF COMING ATTRACTIONS
We’ll next briefly discuss what’s to come. Like previews at a movie theater, several 
“attractions” are coming your way: one concerning the immediate future and the 
other addressing the longer-term time horizon, as much as such a thing can be realis￾tically done. The point of this is to reinforce the notion that your roadmap, once cre￾ated, will soon need to change. You’ll notice this initially as small updates arrive (say, 
an improvement to an existing measurement technology that requires new training) 
to a major change to an HR conformance policy (say, requiring Darwinian “survival 
of the fittest” competition between department colleagues. Later, there will be even 
more substantial changes triggered by the external environment (think Tesla’s entry 
into the global automotive market). At some point your roadmap will need a solid 
update reflecting the new reality at that moment. With this in mind, let’s talk about 
the near-term, as well as long-term factors that may be approaching.
13.2 FACING THE IMMEDIATE
As mentioned above, the immediate future will begin to impact your roadmap soon 
after you finish it. These short-term changes are primarily caused by new informa￾tion arriving from the enterprise-level organization to your engineering group or 
department. This can be good: every day means learning more, seeing new connec￾tions between components that will enrich your roadmap. Each day will produce 
new insights and understandings.
Let’s consider some examples.
13.2.1 Continuing Sources of Information
At this point you may be sick of reading. After something like 16+ years of absorb￾ing textbooks, websites, screen content, and other sources of information, anyone 
would be worn out. But one thing should be considered: throughout every profes￾sional career is the continuing need to absorb new information from a wide variety of 
sources. We’re not just talking about journals specific to your engineering specialty 
but also a much wider variety of information topics and types. At this point in any 
career, there comes a need to broaden your viewpoint in addition to diving deeper 
within a technical specialty. Fortunately, as you know there are literally hundreds of 
adjacent technical and non-technical information sources (blogs, YouTube briefings, 
TED talks, and all the rest) to cull. Perhaps generate a list by category: some techni￾cal, some social, some balanced political, some economic (offshore sources are very 
good in this area), and some for pure enjoyment. Your purpose is not to make a list

of the “best” sources, checking each one off in turn, but instead looking for thought 
starters to broaden where to learn more. Just base your personal selections on two 
factors: the reliability of the information presented and the excellence in writing or 
speaking. Both can pay dividends in the long term.
Finally, please consider making this a weekly habit. Once established, you may 
find you do not have to carve out special time for reading, listening, or watching; it’s 
already been done.
13.2.2  You May Not Be in Control
Many new engineers express surprise that disrupters appear soon after their job 
begins: they really have no “control” over their work. Think about this. At university 
many (sometimes even a majority) of assignments are “team-based,” meaning not 
only is the work done in groups, but each member may also be graded as a group, 
not as an individual. If the assignment earns a “B,” then everyone does, including the 
group superstar and the two slackers who don’t bother to show up. The biggest frus￾tration for the committed group members is not having true control over their grades.
Like at university, work assignments are also expected to be accomplished despite 
your lack of control. So many potential derailers: interruptions, other deadlines, 
uncooperative group members, no supporting data, inadequate budgets, the boss’s 
wishes, changes in direction, and cancellations halfway through. The list can be long 
and difficult. Consider the common control issues between university and profes￾sional assignments in Table 13.1.
The solution to this is to plan your work, but not as you might think. You have to 
actually plan two things: the technical work itself and also plan your work system. 
The work system is not complicated. This is merely setting in advance the work pro￾cess boundaries and ground rules to enable the technical work to proceed without an

outside force stopping your progress. You’ve already done this in the past. Preparing 
for a final exam may have sent you to the library stacks, closing the door to your 
room, or working in the middle of the night to avoid pop-ins. In other words, estab￾lish privacy when required. This seems trivial, yet the open floor plans so common 
today have one major complaint: lack of privacy and excessive interruption. Just plan 
for your work before you work.
Finally, let’s leave this section with an old joke (summarized in Table 13.2) about 
the “alternative” phases of an engineering group assignment or project every engi￾neer eventually experiences.
13.2.3 Management Fad or Management Insight?
The book The Second Curve: Thoughts on Reinventing Society touched on the idea 
of identifying reoccurring corporate “fads” versus truly new and effective corpo￾rate management techniques.1 The examples are many: The One Minute Manager, 
Re-engineering, Blue Ocean Strategy and the like. An important (and famous) exam￾ple was the emphasis from 1970 onwards on an idea called shareholder value. This 
notion, most prominently expressed by the economist Milton Friedman, argued that 
the singular social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits, nothing more 
or less.2
Friedman argued that a firm is nothing more than a group of contractual rela￾tionships and the company management should strictly align themselves with the 
shareholders. This approach emphasizes attention on the company’s immediate 
or short-term profits at the expense of the medium-and long-term outcomes. This 
became the popular view to hold, meaning companies should use every technique 
possible to make money for shareholders, not necessarily creating world-class prod￾ucts. In this philosophy, profit was a managed end goal, not a measuring stick track￾ing the overall success of the firm. Financiers replaced engineers at the head of 
manufacturing companies and corporate cultures changed.
TABLE 13.2
Phases of an Engineering Group Project
Phase Outcome
Phase One Enthusiasm for the assignment
Phase Two Development and execution of the plan
Phase Three Initial bad results

Phase Five Search for the guilty
Phase Six Persecution of the innocent
Phase Seven Replacement of assignment lead engineer
Phase Eight Eventual project completion with everyone relieved
Phase Nine Disband the group with a promise never to do that again352 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Luckily, the shareholder value fad for the most part disappeared in the second decade 
of the 21st century. According to The Second Curve, “society has not benefited, indeed it 
almost collapsed in 2008 when banks and businesses overreached themselves.”3
The lesson here for new engineers and other recent hires is this: companies tend 
to go through eras (or sometimes fads) of new management thought. Each era is 
believed to provide a new, “progressive” way of doing business. If and when in the 
future your company adopts one of these ideas, you will be obligated and compelled 
to follow it. Just bear in mind that this new way may not be the panacea advertised, 
but instead a well-intentioned but flawed attempt at modernization or change. The 
good news is that true fads will slowly disappear as management sees the shortcom￾ings of the new way.
13.3 ANTICIPATING THE LONG TERM
It’s easy to see that a long-term assessment will result in a radical change to a road￾map. The immediate future will quickly fall away, replaced by a future with major 
unknowns as significant societal, technological, economic, environmental, and 
political factors emerge and morph into a kaleidoscope of change. These longer-term 
changes are primarily caused by new information, techniques, inventions, and inno￾vations from outside the firm, industry, or even current society. In this view, each day 
can produce major change, risks, and opportunities.
Let’s consider some examples.
13.3.1  Impact of the Changing External Environment
The external environment is a pesky and annoying problem. It just won’t stay still 
long enough for us to truly get a handle on it. And in the future, this problem will 
only get worse. Of all the major external forces you must deal with, each one is 
accelerating, and so its impact on you: seen as an increasing force of change and 
the emergence and disappearance of relevant factors. Many engineering planners 
are surprised when their six-month analysis of the external environment is rendered 
obsolete by the time they present their work to upper management. It’s a frustrating 
and embarrassing situation when, in a meeting, management contradicts your work 
on the external environment.
Take for instance our friend Qianyan Shea, whom we met in Chapter 10. As you 
remember, she was her organization’s technology “futurist.” In the early 2000s, 
Qianyan identified nanotechnology, the use of molecular configurations such as car￾bon to construct physical structures that are strong, cheap, and easy to be made. At 
that time, it was a significant emerging technology that could drastically change the 
company’s manufacturing methods and product performance. She correctly identi￾fied the emerging potential of this game changer.
It took about nine months of researching this technology to develop her analysis 
to where it could be briefed to senior management. Unfortunately, just a week before 
she was scheduled to present, nano took a significant turn from scanning tunneling 
microscope-based carbon manufacturing (STM) to a more biologically based growth Coming Attractions 353
engine using a building block approach. This change in direction was announced in 
the technology press. This turn of events quickly made the original carbon-based 
STM nanotechnology obsolete for her company’s product engineering process. Yet 
Qianyan was told by her management she was still obligated to present even though 
her material was now out-of-date. Their justification was it would become a “back￾ground only” briefing. What happened? Soon after she began, she was stopped by 
the vice president of product development and was told that this original technology 
was already obsolete, as the vice president had just read the announcement and was 
not now interested in a background-only talk. Needless to say, Qianyan was embar￾rassed, and her management lost some confidence in her when she was stopped from 
presenting even though she was directed to give the presentation.
Or take the example of fossil fuels for the automotive industry. All battery-electric, 
plug-in electric, conventional hybrid, diesel, and internal combustion engines con￾tinuously change their cost-benefit ratios due to commodity oil prices fluctuating on 
a daily basis, plus in the longer-term movement in electricity prices, especially when 
considering external foreign markets such as China, Middle East, Russia, Europe, 
and in North and South America. This instability in the energy external environment 
requires continuous analysis to anticipate the energy environment three to six years 
in the future to support the selection of an appropriate power plant. Ask any strategic 
planner and they will give you chapter and verse on the headaches caused by this 
extreme environmental fluctuation.
13.3.2  Understanding the Organization’s Lifecycle
Just like any organism, a technical organization is continuously moving through a 
lifecycle, a growth and decline dynamic where the organization is born, grows, pla￾teaus, and finally declines unless it experiences a rebirth. This is a macro trend exhib￾ited by any organization, and we need to understand what that lifecycle is, where a 
given organization currently is within that cycle and where it might be headed.
Figure 13.1 shows a generalized chart of a typical company lifecycle. This is an 
average; a particular engineering organization may or may not follow this exact trend 
line. But the important point is that there is a dynamic growth and decline aspect to 
every organization.
Briefly, there are five general stages of a firm’s lifecycle:
Entrepreneurial Stage
This stage is identified by the initial marshaling of resources, investigating many 
ideas, and performing niche entrepreneurial activities with little planning while 
attempting to be a first mover within that niche. Creativity is the goal, while the 
company’s size is very small.
Collectivity Stage
Collectivity is denoted by informal communication, structure, and a sense of group 
cohesion, resulting in a high commitment (i.e., spending long hours at work) origi￾nating from a strong sense of mission. Innovation continues at a high level.354 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Formalization Stage
Here, standard organizational rules are developed and adopted, communication 
becomes more structured, and a stable structure emerges with an emphasis on coor￾dination and control systems while expending a minimum of the firm’s resources. 
Bureaucracy is now embedded in the firm.
Elaboration Stage
Expansion of the firm with increased structural complexity, decentralization into 
local profit centers, and expansion of markets while working in a post-bureaucratic 
manner, including associated widespread adoption of new methods. Expressed as a 
general sense of company maturity.
Decision Stage
Completion of the elaboration stage forces the firm into a strategic decision of what 
direction the company should now take to remain vital. This decision can include 
continued maturity, adopting small company thinking, breaking up into separate 
units, or doing nothing (which greatly increases the chances of decline).4
Table 13.3 provides additional characteristics of these four stages to pair with 
Figure 13.1.

now familiar and beginning to become enjoyable. You seem to fit well with your 
colleagues, and your reputation is positive and growing. Assuming that you wish 
to stay, let’s say your future career expectation is a choice of either spending some 
additional time in your present position before rotating to that design position you’ve 
always wanted or being promoted into an advanced technology position in the R&D 
organization. You’ve shared this with your supervisor who is understanding and sup￾portive. Maybe you’ve already had several interesting, short-term rotations in other 
departments. And whenever you asked your supervisor if you could rotate there, the 
answer is always an immediate “yes.”
Then one day that same supervisor sides up to you and says: “Have you ever 
thought about getting your master’s in business administration?” You state you 
haven’t. The supervisor replies: “Maybe you should think about it. Let’s talk later.”
You now know what’s coming: the battle over expectations.

Harvard Business Review 50: 37–46.356 Navigating the Engineering Organization
Every new engineer has a series of personal expectations guiding their work path, 
normally a series of steps leading to a satisfying goal. These are important to you; 
after all, fulfilling these expectations is the main reason you joined the company in 
the first place. Yet at some point, at a time and place unknown to you, you will be 
confronted with another set of expectations: those of your organization.
The overall hypothesis is this. As a new hire, your company and professional 
knowledge are very limited. Essentially any position within the company will gain 
you experience. Through your management’s lens, wherever a new hire wants to go 
is granted. It’s a low-risk play: the engineer gets much-needed experience while see￾ing themselves as in control of their career path. This may go on for several years.
As more time passes, the supervisor or manager begins to exert a bit more con￾trol over the engineer’s job choices. This is evidenced by those friendly questions, 
and those suggestions that come out of the blue. There’s an agenda here. This may 
become apparent when, during the weekly 1:1 meeting, the supervisor asks if you 
would like to take on a certain role, either inside or outside the department. Of 
course, it’s totally your choice.
The firm’s expectations of you are normally well hidden, and many times couched 
in tempting terms. “You’ve done so well; we think you’re the right person to do this 
job.” Or “This is a great growth opportunity for your long-range development.” Or 
even “This is part of the great plans we have for you.” This may all be true. But there 
is another possibility: They need someone, now, to take over a position or do an 
onerous task which is risk-filled, unpleasant, or seen as a backwater. You are picked 
because they need their expectations filled, not yours.
You can tell if this is happening by the manner this is communicated: you are 
informed, not asked.
If this sounds a bit familiar, it should. This results in something commonly 
referred to as the golden handcuffs, where the past and current rewards and invest￾ments you’ve made in your current company prevents you from moving to a new 
position without risk. Over time, you find it harder and harder to leave. Ask anyone 
who has worked for a firm for over five years and they can tell you all about it.
The purpose of bringing this up has to do with awareness. Be aware this situation 
will be coming to you. And don’t be surprised, as nearly everyone in any organi￾zation experiences it. Just be thinking about this question: what are the company 
expectations that you are able to live with and those you are not? What if you are 
asked to transfer to a different department in your building? To a different building? 
A different city, or state, or country? Like ethics, this type of company expectation 
questions needs to be pondered in advance before you are asked.
13.4 SMALL MATTERS TO BE ATTENDED TO
This is a section I initially resisted writing, but in a book of this type, we can’t escape 
those pithy, one-line nuggets of advice that convey the wisdom of the ages in a dozen 
words or less. What follows is a list of these statements that you will collect in both 
the near and far term future. It’s easy to come up with a general list of “do this” or 
“be sure not to do that.” And it’s simple to receive advice but also equally easy to Coming Attractions 357
ignore. Yet in some instances we just can’t do that. So here are a few points that you 
will probably see or hear again: just remember you got them here first:6
1) Be careful with the commitments you make. If you make a commitment, 
you must fulfill it.
2) Learn from others: set up and operate an efficient and effective information 
gathering system.
3) Work on the right projects, meaning learn how to say no.
4) Plan your work, then work your plan, efficiently.
5) Allow reserve time. Don’t schedule 100% of your work hours. Leave slack 
time to ensure your work can be finished despite surprises and self-inflicted 
wounds.
6) Value yourself in the job, and value yourself personally.
7) Always keep your sense of humor.
8) The grapevine probably knew something about you before you arrived on 
the job. Find out what that something was.
9) Choose the style you are comfortable with and be yourself.
10) A common rule: “There is no sure thing as a stupid question.” Its corollary: 
“As long as it’s asked only once.”
11) Fitting in can be very difficult at first. Everyone knows everyone and you 
are new, so you are the pariah.
12) Of course, it’s easier to follow someone who has been fired.
13) Identify who are the friends of your local organization.
14) Talk to people, but more importantly, listen to people.
15) Be seen.
16) Get the skills you need quickly: this means training.
17) Understand the status quo.
18) Be right the first time on the first assignment. Be right the first time on the sec￾ond assignment. You should be predominately right on the third assignment.
19) Once you are ranked as a person with low potential, that corporate opinion 
will rarely change. If it does change, it takes a long, long time.
20) If you don’t have a network, you must build one, as current information 
helps you prepare for change.
21) Join into the social system as you are allowed.
22) Congratulate others’ accomplishments and successes as soon as possible.
23) The process and systems in your new organization will always be in flux. 
Be prepared for this.
24) Be cheerful and have fun.
25) Stop worrying.
26) Succeed.
13.5 REALIZATIONS
Anticipating the immediate and far-field future is obviously an uncertain business, 
yet there are a few actions available to better the chances of getting it right. The 358 Navigating the Engineering Organization
carefully constructed roadmap you’ve created will need to be updated periodically; 
at what frequency is up to you. Like a single loop control system, roadmaps drift 
away from their normal value over time and do not return until brought back into 
relevancy by revisiting the original work. In the meantime, one of the actions to 
slow down this normal drift between revisits is to absorb fresh information from 
wide-ranging sources, not just technology-related fields. The idea is to round out 
your personal knowledge over time. “Lifelong education” is not just a slogan; it’s a 
way of life.
One of the most frustrating facts about working within engineering is the inherent 
lack of control in your assignments and daily activities. The hoped-for straight line 
between start and finish rarely (if ever) happens, and the actual circuitous route has 
many sharp turns that can easily put you into the ditch. A mindset of expecting the 
sharp curves and meandering route may be the best way to prevent some unwanted 
frustration and anxiety.
A large contributor to this lack of control is management’s continuous desire to 
improve their operations. Major frustration occurs when everyone is forced to absorb 
another change to the general management philosophy. While this change is less 
prevalent now than in the recent past, pleas to “think nimbly” and “be entrepre￾neurial” can actually hurt productivity and effectiveness if presented without worker 
education, an implementation plan, and a serious mindset by management. Overwise 
“management by slogan” results.
Approaching the longer-term time horizon can be fraught with danger or at least 
has a high potential for embarrassment. Just knowing (and viscerally understanding) 
that the external environment will radically change in the farther-term time frame 
goes a long way to condition your mindset to anticipate the changes in your path. 
Being proactive rather than reactive is always a good bet, especially when consider￾ing your own engineering company’s lifecycle.
For instance, know where the firm is at this moment in time and attempt to judge 
where it might be headed. Is the firm’s path moving in a good direction? Is it address￾ing the normal issues at its current life stage? Significantly, does the company’s life 
stage match with your own personal stage of life? This can be telling. For example, 
say the firm is at the collectivity stage, with its informal structure, high commitment 
and required long hours at work. Are these long hours consistent with your personal 
life stage, such as caring for a significant person, or raising young children, or climb￾ing El Capitan? Consider the other non-engineering factors in your home and work. 
Comparing your company’s life stage with your own personal journey can really 
help assess your current path and plan for your next steps.

14 Some Final Thoughts
14.1 THE MEANING OF THE GREAT DIVIDE
We’ve reached the final part of our journey together, the “reflect and conclude” phase 
of making our way across the Great Divide. In our time together, we’ve covered a 
lot of territory and met a wide range of people; all different yet sharing the common 
challenge of working successfully within various technical organizations.
When reflecting on the major messages in this book, two immediately come to 
mind. First, the environment the organization operates in will continue to change at 
an exponential rate, meaning any insights presented today will evolve significantly 
in ten years’ time. Your future understandings will be informed by the foundation 
presented here, but it is your responsibility to keep the roadmap fresh and relevant. 
In short, contingency theory influences all that you do today, as well as hope to do 
for the foreseeable future.
Secondly, the important role of personal ethics and values needs to be devel￾oped and settled upon very early in a new engineer’s professional life. As repeatedly 
stated, ethics is the one subject that does not follow contingency theory. Values are 
absolute, not relativistic, and set a constant and fundamental context for all profes￾sional work. Making decisions within a values context significantly improves the 
quality and success of the work surrounding that decision.
That said, let’s consider some final thoughts to conclude our journey across the 
Great Divide.
14.2 DEMONSTRATING TECHNICAL MASTERY
This idea of technical mastery, that is, knowing your technical “stuff” at the expert 
level, depends on the technology involved and the organization you work in. Some 
organizations that value strong technical knowledge will articulate and express that 
value often and without hesitation. Other organizations tend to assume technology 
is a prior expectation merely in service of the greater goal of bringing an awesome 
product to market. Products addressing customer safety or important public policy 
tend to follow the former. Organizations that provide more convenience-based con￾sumer products will not emphasize technology as much, as convenience products 
do not normally impact public safety. They have the luxury of being less concerned 
about important functionality than companies such as autos, aircraft, pharmaceuti￾cals, and nuclear energy.
Yet no matter the case, being an expert in a technical specialty leads to respect 
and value even though management may not express it often. Consider when an 
engineering problem emerges. Management is interested in solving the technical 
problem as quickly as possible at the minimum cost, either in dollars, reputation,

DOI: 10.1201/9781003214397-18
10.1201/9781003214397-18362 Navigating the Engineering Organization
or both. As part of the task force solving the problem, you as an engineer will bring 
to bear your engineering knowledge in a “nuts and bolts” approach to solving the 
issue. Management assumes you know how to do this and will not necessarily real￾ize the depth of technical skill and knowledge needed to successfully accomplish 
this task. Yet without your technical knowledge, the problem may not be able to 
be solved at all.
So, at some point, what happens after spending a number of years within the 
technical core? Assuming you stay in the firm, do you stay in the core and continue 
a career in a technical area with the mastery that comes with it, or do you elect to 
move on to a different part of the enterprise? This question touches on the dual lad￾der concept we discussed in Chapter 7.
It’s also a very interesting question, and I will not venture individual advice on 
this complex and highly personal puzzle. But most people know that technical prow￾ess and strong reputation is an indicator of future success. As the old saying goes, 
“The best indication of future success is past success.” Just know the question is out 
there and will arrive someday.
A word about new tools. New, emerging tools are an exciting and critical part 
of any dynamic organization. Luckily for new employees, it’s also a place for 
enhanced job satisfaction, positive exposure, and a place to grow an excellent 
reputation.
Sadly, a surprising number of experienced engineers will tend to shy away 
from new tools, either from lack of confidence in learning them, resistance to 
new ways of doing business, or just plain laziness. New hires are excellent can￾didates to be “first movers” in adopting, learning, and applying these new tools. 
This opens up an excellent opportunity to provide a unique skill to the organiza￾tion. You would become part of a small group possessing that specific technical 
skill, making you more valuable to your department and especially your boss. 
There is very little downside to quickly adopting and learning these new tools, 
whatever they may be.
A great example of adopting a new organizational “tool” had to do with a new 
organization at a U.S. mobility firm being established in Palo Alto, California, in the 
mid-2010s. This company decided that the “Silicon Valley Way” of quickly creat￾ing and marketing products needed to be investigated and perhaps adopted for their 
own use. This firm decided to establish a large satellite campus adjacent to Stanford 
University. Here, engineers and coders would discover and develop breakthrough 
mobility products while demonstrating the superiority of new methods to the firm’s 
legacy engineers. It was also meant to be a “listening post” for emerging technolo￾gies as well as being a critical contributor to the company’s methods of working. 
Basically, this new facility was to become a huge “technical tool” for new product 
development.
One of the key approaches to this new way of working was the adoption of the 
“skunk works” methodology. Here, the Palo Alto facility was purposely placed some 
thousands of miles away from the headquarters “mothership.” This allowed the 
engineering team to work in relative anonymity, fostering those fresh methods of 
working. For a new engineer this can be heaven, but only if management provides Some Final Thoughts 363
meaningful support to let these new tools and processes work themselves out before 
being applied to the organization as a whole.
The story of the development of this Palo Alto facility is a long and interesting 
one. The conflicts, fault paths, and uncertainties convincing management this is a 
good idea and resulting employee benefits are just a few of the many challenges 
that need to be overcome. In fact, it took more than one attempt to get the facility 
up and running. Yet today, after almost a decade, the Palo Alto site is finally being 
accepted as a legitimate and forward-looking component of the overall organization, 
and adoption of this new tool is finally proceeding. And those located there are pur￾suing mastery of a new technology: a new way of working.
CASE EXAMPLE 14.1 THE IMPACT OF DR. HAREN GANDHI
This brings us to an excellent example of how a single individual’s technical 
mastery literally changed an entire planet.
We begin with a gentleman named Dr. Haren Gandhi, an automotive 
research chemist in a global mobility firm specializing in the nascent field of 
atmospheric pollution. In the mid to late 1960s, global tailpipe emissions of 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitric oxide were reaching crisis propor￾tions, and governments worldwide began to realize that regulatory action was 
required to reverse this alarming trend. In the United States and elsewhere, 
extremely aggressive new laws were passed, requiring automotive companies 
to substantially reduce tailpipe emissions, and quickly.
Starting in 1967, Haren focused his work on emissions mitigation. One 
promising area was three-way catalysts (TWCs) which perform three func￾tions: convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons into car￾bon dioxide and water, and nitric and nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water. 
What prevented TWCs from being used was the very high cost of three critical 
elements used in the catalyst: platinum, palladium, and rhodium. Individually, 
no one could afford these precious metals. If TWCs were to work, increased 
availability and reduced cost of these base elements across the industry were 
the challenge.
Haren’s solution was to establish a global infrastructure system through 
which all automotive companies worldwide would share their TWC technolo￾gies and together tackle precious metal utilization and recycling, making this 
catalyst feasible and affordable.
It worked. By sharing the best of global TWC designs, and banding manu￾facturers together to completely change the precious metals industry, pollution 
from hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide was cut by 90% from 1970 to 1975, 
and nitric oxide pollution was reduced by 90% from 1970 to 1976.
The short story is this: Haren invented and led the implementation of mod￾ern catalytic convertor system, the basic method for reducing global tailpipe 364 Navigating the Engineering Organization
pollution used to this day. Haren’s leadership brought the automotive industry 
through the crises.
In short, Haren literally changed the world.
Today, Haren’s legacy crosses all borders, having served as an automotive 
emissions panel expert appointee of the United Nations and advisor to the 
Indian government. His four-decade-long research led him to be regarded by 
the National Academy of Engineering as “one of the world’s foremost authori￾ties in the area of automotive emissions control.”
A postscript.
One day in 2003 while working at his office, Haren received a phone call 
from a strange number.
Haren: “Hello?”
Stranger: “Hello, is this Dr. Haren Gandhi?”
Haren: “Yes, it is”
Stranger: “Dr. Gandhi, this is the White House calling. The President 
of the United States has awarded you the National Medal of 
Technology and Innovation. He was wondering if you would 
join him in the East Room where he will present the award to 
you. Are you available?”
Haren: “I think I am.”
Haren won the nation’s highest honor for technology for his global leader￾ship in reducing atmospheric pollution. It was the first time ever that an auto 
industry researcher had been awarded the Medal of Technology, joining such 
past winners as Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Gordon Moore, Ray Kurzweil, and 
many others.
An important point emerges here that deserves mention. Mainstream think￾ing tells us that to make a global impact on society (and get rich in the process), 
a person should create a startup, fight for venture capital funding, and through 
superior ideation and plain old “smarts,” implement a game-changing technol￾ogy or innovation. The world changes as a result.
This has certainly worked. But there is another way that may be a higher 
percentage play.
Large, established companies (especially mass-market firms) have power 
that startups don’t. Internal funding, name recognition, hard resources, and 
existing infrastructure: all make an engineer’s life infinitely easier. Large firm 
engineers can book meetings and present ideas that startups will never be able 
to achieve. Yes, large firms can install internal barriers startups don’t need 
to worry about. But the point is this: joining larger, established companies 
can leverage power and resources that startups generally lack. And as Haren 
proves to us, there is more than one way to impact our world.Some Final Thoughts 365
14.3 WHAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL?
In the early days of globalization, North American and European companies strug￾gled with the disruption caused by digital communications and the rapid movement 
of goods and services offshore, especially to Asia and India. Relatively comfort￾able organizations suddenly found themselves attacked on cost performance due to 
so many services moving to low-wage, higher-education countries. Tom Peters, the 
influential management writer and author, came up with an effective counter to the 
overwhelming uncertainty of the time. It came in the form of a simple question: “So, 
what exactly makes you special?”1
Simply put, what product, service, knowledge, or talent do you as an individual 
(or collectively as a firm) possess that cannot be replicated digitally by anyone, over￾seas or local to your home market?
Peter’s thinking was that the digital revolution took the elements of geography 
and distance and removed them from the marketplace. With the sudden realization 
that any knowledge work can instantaneously move anywhere on the globe forced 
a rapid and radical rethinking of what is an individual’s value to the engineering 
organization. In other words, what is your personal competitive advantage you bring 
to any technical group? Mark Karbow, an IT engineer with about 25 years’ of experi￾ence, witnessed this firsthand. Very early in his career, Mark learned a specialized 
1980s computer language called Erlang. He found it easy and satisfying to work 
with. Unfortunately, Erlang was quickly surpassed by more sophisticated and robust 
languages in the 1990s such as Haskell and Java, and Mark naturally learned those 
languages and continued his career. Some three decades later, the original Erlang 
language had a bit of a renaissance as original programming done in Erlang needed 
to be updated to support current and emerging hardware and software systems. 
Suddenly, there was a strong demand for anyone with experience in Erlang, and 
Mark fit the bill perfectly. Soon, he had all the work he could deal with converting 
that legacy language into 21st-century uses.
That language made Mark special. It made him unique, and there was obviously 
a high demand for that special skill he brought to the workplace.
So, what makes you special?
14.4 WOULD YOU RATHER BE LIKED OR RESPECTED?
This simple phrase incorporates several of the points we’ve been discussing through￾out this book. A decision is looming: in the workplace, do you wish to be liked or 
respected? To be either liked or respected is a very personal “Y” in the road, a choice 
that can have a life-long impact on your work and personal life. The answer to this 
question can help direct you in so many situations and guide the decisions you even￾tually will be faced with.
Being liked involves several beliefs and actions you might consider. If you remem￾ber our conversation about conflict strategies, you’ll find being liked tends to fall into 
the passive category. It involves loss of control where you give up your original posi￾tion, sacrificing it to be accepted by another person or entity.366 Navigating the Engineering Organization
To be respected is a different animal. Respect means that you pursue fair out￾comes to conflict, that people trust your actions, words, and beliefs, and will do the 
right thing even if it causes additional effort or loss. Respect means integrity. It does 
not mean the avoidance of conflict but the pursuit of fairness.
Making the decision to be liked or respected needs to be made early and rein￾forced repeatedly, so it becomes second nature; to naturally follow that philosophy 
without consciously thinking about it.
I was introduced to this idea by my wife Beth. Beth is the smartest person I know, 
an amazing combination of first-class thinking combined with the special gift of 
empathy and the ability to understand people and their interrelationships. She is a 
wonderful combination of giving and insight.
Whenever I face an important question and am unsure how to proceed, Beth has a 
simple question for me: “Bob, would you rather be liked or respected?” The simplic￾ity of this question belies its importance.
It’s great if you can be both liked and respected. Unfortunately, it’s normally not 
that easy. Being respected is harder, yet no matter how uncomfortable you are in 
sharing unpleasant news with others or speaking truth to power, it’s a good bet that 
you will come out of the interaction with the respect of others. Respect makes for 
long-term benefits for you and the people around you. It’s nice to be liked, but it’s 
even nicer to be respected.
14.5 COMMITTING ENGINEERING
You are about to commit engineering. While a cute quip, there is a nugget of impor￾tance in the meaning of that phrase. The act of committing engineering is a deliber￾ate, important, and impactful action, where careers can be advanced or broken and 
lives won or lost. While we like to talk about the fun stuff in engineering: developing 
a new app or developing a cool and exciting new product that makes you eager to 
share it with your friends, there is a certain core importance we need to realize and 
commit to at the start of any professional career.
Soon after I began my work at Boeing, a terrible tragedy occurred on the F-15 
Eagle fighter program. The Eagle had been in production for many years, and each 
finished aircraft was routinely flown on an acceptance test flight to ensure all systems 
were functioning correctly and the plane was ready to be delivered to the customer.
During an acceptance test for a new F-15, the aircraft suffered a major structural 
failure. A life raft inadvertently deployed from under the pilot’s seat, jamming the 
control stick forward. The test pilot immediately lost control and crashed into the 
woods of western Missouri. As is normal in any crash investigation, the parts of the 
ill-fated aircraft were recovered and sent to a Boeing facility, where each part was 
reassembled (as best as possible) to help determine the root cause of the tragedy.
Soon after my arrival at Boeing, I was summoned to a meeting with a number of 
my newly hired colleagues. Not sure why we had been called, our group entered a 
large hangar where spread out on the floor and on tables throughout the room were 
the remains of the crashed fighter. Parts were everywhere: crumpled, broken, and 
covered in hydraulic fluid and oil. The scene was like something from a disaster Some Final Thoughts 367
movie. Our guide told us to take the next hour and examine, touch, and try to put 
together the remains in a way we could learn something.
As we gathered back together, our guide held up a shattered piece of the clear 
plastic canopy that once protected the pilot. On the inside surface were three long 
scratches. Our guide asked: “Does anybody know where these scratches came 
from?” Naturally, no one did. The guide then held up the test pilot’s helmet. On 
the left side of the helmet were three screws protruding from its surface. Our guide 
placed the helmet against the three long scratches, showing a perfect match to the 
three screws on the helmet. The conclusion was clear. During the accident, the pilot 
exited the vehicle through the top of the canopy. We all became very quiet.
It then occurred to me why we were there. This is not about reconstructing an accident 
by putting bits and pieces back together. This was about learning our responsibilities as 
aerospace engineers; that our actions, our designs, our checking and double checking our 
work all had a direct and literal impact on the lives of the pilots who flew these aircraft. 
We had a serious responsibility as engineers to ensure no one needed to visit a hangar in 
the future. A group of solemn young engineers left the building that day, better not only 
for the oil on our hands but for the visceral experience we just had.
A reminder of that experience occurred a few years later. The F-18A fighter had 
moved from design into the manufacturing phase with the building of a dozen pre￾production prototypes. As a liaison engineer in the factory, I was called on to solve 
a problem inside the pilot’s cockpit. An avionics electronics box would not slide into 
its mounting rack located by the pilot’s right elbow. The avionics box was about a 
1/16th inch too high for its rack, and a rework of the rack would be needed. As I 
climbed into the pilot seat, I thought I could wiggle the box and force it into its space 
on the rack. I began to push and shove, trying to get some leverage to force the box 
in. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a stranger approaching the cockpit.
Stranger: Hi, what ‘cha doing?
Santer (huffing): “Trying to get this avionics box into this support rack …”
Stranger: “Looks like it’s kind of tough, huh?”
Santer (puffing): “Yeah, but I think I can bend it enough to get it in. It’s only a six￾teenth interference. If I can just twist it, I can avoid having to rework the 
entire rack structure.”
Stranger (icily): “Well, I suggest you do it right. Because when this plane takes off 
for the first time, my ass is going to be sitting where yours is right now.”
It was the test pilot.
I immediately knew what I had done wrong. In my hope of avoiding a bit of work 
and “letting it slide,” I was willing to trade my inconvenience for the risk caused by 
not doing things right, and it took the actual test pilot to wake me up. The fact that I 
was looking at the face of the real person who would fly my product was sobering. 
The point here is not the severity of the cheat but the fact that I was willing to do it. 
It told me I was beginning to let standards relax. That pilot performed an excellent 
service for me that day. He reminded me of my responsibility; to watch for my ten￾dency to take a shortcut. The fact that I clearly remember this incident after so many 
years tells me its importance to this day.368 Navigating the Engineering Organization
14.6 THE LEGACY OF YOUR WORK
At this point it may feel premature to be thinking about the legacy of your work. 
After all, just hitting your marks each day, learning as fast as possible about each 
new situation; these thoughts are certainly going to push out of your mind the legacy 
aspect of your work. No one would blame you.
Yet as I gained time in various jobs and positions in my career, I began (slowly 
at first) to ponder two ideas: first, the “legacy” of my work and, secondly, its overall 
importance. What I mean by that is, how much longevity does my work have? What 
is the “mean time” of the relevancy of what I do each day as a professional? What is 
the relative importance of my efforts? No one wants their work to quickly become 
obsolete or insignificant. For many engineers, career satisfaction is directly sourced 
from both the impact and longevity of their work.
This is something that you don’t need to consider right now (after all, getting a job 
and then keeping it in your early days is the main event), but you might want to put 
these questions in your memory and use them to guide your experiences toward that 
future job that fulfills your definition of high impact and lasting usefulness.
CASE EXAMPLE 14.2 THE JOURNEY OF YUAN LONGPING
We live in both possible and probable times. As engineers, we want to see what 
is possible: a new material, the new bioengineered limb, a new data analysis 
tool, the new vaccine delivery device. Yes, all these are certainly possible. But 
the next question is harder. Are these things probable? Are we smart enough 
and savvy enough to move these desires from the possible to the probable? Is 
there a limit to the size of the immense problems we as engineers can over￾come, either as an individual or in groups, large or small?
I like to look at the story of Yuan Longping, an agronomist who died in 
2021 at age 90. A resident of Hunan Providence in China, Yuan spent his life 
on one thing: rice. Amazing, special, life-changing little bits of nutrition.
From early on, Yuan was fascinated with all things rice, growing it, tending 
it, and improving it; constantly striving to increase its size and nutrition. After 
a lifetime of work, “Super Rice” was born: a hybrid seed producing an amaz￾ing 20% to 30% higher yield, meaning some 60 million more people could be 
fed globally. With his help, China’s rice crop rose from just 57 million tons in 
1950 to about 195 million tons in 2017, moving the entire country from food 
scarcity to security. His higher ratios allowed growers to use the now-extra 
land for other crops such as fruit, vegetables, and fish. Diets became more bal￾anced: today, 20% of all rice in the world comes from his hybrids.2
So what can we learn from Yuan? Like Haren Gandhi, Yuan is a simple 
story of how a single passionate man from a Chinese province changed the 
world in a massive and positive way. Belief, knowledge, and action made this 
possible.Some Final Thoughts 369
14.7 ACROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE
There is an old proverb attributed to Geoffrey Chaucer: “All good things must come 
to an end.”
Nothing lasts forever, and all things and situations are temporary, including enjoy￾able ones. For me, it also applies to this book. The people we’ve met are remark￾able for their many experiences. We’ve met Bob Tyler, the aircraft factory foreman 
who taught lessons about bias. We’ve met Laura Kendric, the high-flying marketing 
executive who ignored the key facet of culture in organizations. We’ve witnessed 
Ed Krieger struggle with the ethical conflict between himself and his company, and 
so many more people with insights to share. Tom Siligato, Greg Scribner, Qianyan 
Shea: all contributed their experiences and learnings to our time together.
Your new organization wants you to succeed. The organization has already 
invested time, talent, and money (and for some, their reputation) in your recruitment. 
By hiring you they are placing a bet that you will perform to their expectation and 
most importantly, fit into their existing community and society. That is not to say that 
you don’t have to prove yourself, but it does provide you some cushion, as they will 
expect mistakes and missteps as you enter into your new professional world. And 
while they are interested that you succeed, that does not mean that your transition 
will be made easy. It will be your professional responsibility to use this opportunity 
to secure your ongoing place in your chosen organization.
So here we are. You’re now facing the impending problem you knew was out 
there, but now it’s knocking at the front door. That Great Divide is here. The transi￾tion has started, no matter your thoughts on it. It may be happening not at the time 
of your choosing and its duration is indeterminate. Some transitions are mild and 
short, others are somewhat painful and long, some begin easily and suddenly hit like 
a punch to the gut. All are totally at the discretion of you and your new professional 
organization, and you must be prepared for all these situations.
14.8 AU REVOIR
Finally, thank you for coming this far. I hope you have enjoyed this little journey 
across the Great Divide and have learned how to better operate in your future tech￾nical and engineering home. I prefer to think of this moment not as a goodbye but 
instead consider as the French would say: au revoir; until we meet again.
