The Fourier heat conduction model is valid for most macroscopic problems. However,
it fails when the wave nature of the heat propagation or the time lags become dominant
and the memory or/and spatial non-local effects significant—in ultrafast heating
(pulsed laser heating and melting), rapid solidification of liquid metals, processes in
glassy polymers near the glass transition temperature, in heat transfer at nanoscale,
in heat transfer in a solid-state laser medium at the high pump density or under the
ultrashort pulse duration, in granular and porous materials including polysilicon,
at extremely high values of the heat flux, in heat transfer in biological tissues. In
common materials the relaxation time ranges from 10−8 to 10−14 sec; however, it
could be as high as 1 sec in the degenerate cores of aged stars, and its reported
values in granular and biological objects vary up to 30 sec. The book considers
numerous non-Fourier heat conduction models that incorporate the time non-locality
for the materials with memory (hereditary materials, including fractional hereditary
materials) or/and the spatial non-locality for the materials with non-homogeneous
inner structure.

Introduction
The heat conduction is probably the most important dissipative phenomenon; thus it
is the starting point of any theories of dissipation, particularly for the non-equilibrium
thermodynamics; the distinctive property of this process is that it does not have a
reversible part [1]. The heat conduction model suggested in the beginning of the
nineteenth century by Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier [2] in his famous work named
“Analytical Theory of Heat” is based on the constitutive relation
q(r, t) = −λ∇T (r, t). (1.1)
leading, after substitution it into the energy conservation equation for the solid body
in rest
∂(cT )
∂t
=∇· q + Q (1.2)
to the classical parabolic heat conduction equation (called sometimes the “Fourier￾Kirchhoff equation”, rarely “Maxwell-Fourier law” [3], or the “Fourier heat conduc￾tion equation” (FHCE) [4])
∂(cT )
∂t
=∇· (λ∇T ) + Q (1.3)
that for the case of constant thermophysical properties is written as
∂T
∂t = κT (1.4)
where κ = λ/c is the thermal diffusivity. Specific heat capacity shows non￾negligible variations only in very wide temperature range [5]. However, Cimmelli
et al. [6] analysed the effect of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity
and heat capacity [7, 8] on heat transfer.

12 1 Introduction
For bulk materials, the thermal conductivity λ is believed to be an intensive prop￾erty that does not depend on the size and the geometry of the sample. This is valid
when the phonon transport is diffusive; when the sample size along the transport
direction is much smaller than the phonon mean free path, phonons propagate bal￾listically across the sample without experiencing an appreciable scattering [9–12].
This is, for example, the case in the thin films and nanowires where the thermal
conductivity decreases as film becomes thinner or the nanowire radius decreases due
to the increase of the phonon–boundary scattering [13].
The Fourier law can be directly derived from the classical irreversible thermody￾namics based on the local equilibrium hypothesis [14, 15]. The entropy production
is written as
 = q · ∇
1
T ≥ 0.
From the viewpoint of the irreversible thermodynamics, the Fourier law describes
a linear relationship between the generalized force (the temperature gradient) and
the generalized flux (the heat flux) [16]. For the isotropic materials the heat flux is
q = λT ∇
1
T = −λT
T 2 ∇T.
Thus λ = λT /t 2 is the Fourier heat conduction coefficient with λT being a thermo￾dynamic conduction coefficient [1].
The derivation of the Fourier equation is based on the principle of the local ther￾modynamic equilibrium and the continuum hypothesis, according to which each
small element of the medium has a local equilibrium state and can be described by
the local thermodynamic potentials that are dependent on the spatial variable and the
time only through the thermodynamic parameters.
The Fourier law is local with respect to time and space [17]. Accepting the local
equilibrium principle is possible only if the rate of change in the system macropa￾rameters due to the external influences is much less than the rate of system relaxation
to the local equilibrium [17]. Based on the local equilibrium principle, it is assumed
that the transport laws are valid not only for the entire system, but also for any arbi￾trarily small part of it. Thus it is possible to perform the limit transition (by tending
the volume of integration to zero) in the integral conservation laws and obtain these
laws in the form of the differential equations.
If the characteristic microscale of the system and the characteristic time of its
relaxation to equilibrium are significantly less than the characteristic macroscale and
the total time of the process, then the differential equations derived based on the local
equilibrium principle and the continuum hypothesis will be local both in space and
in time. Thus we obtain the transport equations that do not contain the relaxation
time τ and the characteristic scale of the microstructure l.
The Fourier law is a prototype of the constitutive equations leading to a parabolic
partial differential equation. The major drawback of the parabolic FHCE is the
unphysical instantaneous propagation of the disturbances—it neglects the boundness1 Introduction 3
of the speed of the thermal disturbances by the the internal structure of the media
they travel on—[18] (“the heat transfer paradox” [1], “the paradox of propagation
of the thermal signals” [19], “the paradox of heat conduction” (PHC) [1, 20–22],
“the heat transfer paradox” (HTP) [23] or “the paradox of diffusion” [24]) called
sometimes acausality [25]—it does not forecasts the propagation of the disturbances
restricted by the characteristic causal light-cones [26].
Lars Onsager in 1931 [27] pointed out that “... Fourier law is only approximate
description of the process of conduction neglecting the time needed for acceleration
of the heat flow”.
The solution of Eq. (1.4) in the one-dimensional case for the initial conditions
T (x = 0, 0) = 0, T (0, 0) = 1 is
T (x, t) = 1
√πκt
exp
− x 2
4κt

.
Thus, for x as large as one wishes and for any t > 0 one gets T (x, t) > 0. Hence
the heat has propagated from x = 0 to x in an interval of time no matter how small.
The speed of the propagation of the heat is infinite, which is not acceptable.
However, as noted Fichera [28], the Fourier law is a result of experimental obser￾vations; hence it is conditioned by the physical nature of the material under consider￾ation and by the degree of refinement of the measurements. It results that the infinitely
small heat signal that propagates at an infinite speed cannot be experimentally seen—
the sensitivity of the experimental devices is finite, therefore they can measure only
finite speeds [22, 29, 30]. Day [31] demonstrated that, if an infinitesimal small frac￾tion of the heat signal does propagate at an infinite speed, the propagation of the
bulk of the signal—which is physically significant—is at finite velocity. As stressed
Márkus [32], one should distinguish the signal and action propagation.
Auriault [33] claimed that the paradox is inconsistent using the underlying homog￾enization process to investigate the domains of validity of both the Fourier and the
Maxwell “Cattaneo” Vernotte (Sect. 2.1) equations.
The author used three different characteristic lengths l, L and L1 associated with
the atomic scale, the macroscopic scale where the Fourier law and the Maxwell
“Cattaneo” Vernotte law are defined and an upper macroscopic scale: l/L = ε 
1, L/L1 = η  1. The smallness of the parameter of separation of scales η is the
condition for the existence of the equivalent macroscopic models [33]. In the frame￾work of the homogenization theory T = T (0) + εT (1) + ε2T (2) +··· and the Fourier
law is
∂T (0)
∂t = κT (0) + O(ε).
Thus an infinite speed of a heat signal obtained from the classical Fourier equation
cannot be demonstrated from the last equation since such a signal is very small—it is
included in the term O(ε). Thus Auriault concluded that since the Fourier equation
is an approximation and cannot forecast a heat signal with an infinite speed because
such a signal would be infinitely small, it should not be considered paradoxical.4 1 Introduction
The Fourier law is valid if [34, 35]
• L
  O(1),
• t
τ  O(1),
• T  0◦K
where L is the characteristic size of the system,  is the mean free path of the heat
carries, τ is the relaxation time. The ratio K n = /L is called the Knudsen number
similar to the rarefied gas dynamics theory. The Fourier law is valid in the limit of
small Knudsen number, i.e. when /L  1. The Knudsen number may increase
either because of an increase of the mean free path of the heat carries as in rarefied
gases or due to the reduction of L as in miniaturized systems. Sometimes the Fourier
number is used Fo = λT0/ρC L [36, 37].
Thus, the Fourier law is invalid if the “microscopic nature of heat” [38] could
not be ignored. The Fourier law also fails in the case of the extremely high heat
fluxes since the heat flux cannot reach the arbitrary high values but is limited by the
quantity of the order of the energy density times the maximum speed of the signal
propagation, thus the saturation of the fluxes occurs for the high enough values of
the temperature gradient [39–44].
The heat waves in the form of the second sound [45]—the thermal transport regime
where the heat is carried by the temperature waves similarly to the propagation of
the sound wave in the ordinary gases—were predicted by Landau [46] and Tisza [47]
(see also [48, 49]) who studied the behaviour of the quasi-particles in the superfluid
liquid helium II using the two-fluid model (the normal fluid and the superfluid) and
were observed in the helium II at 1.4 K by V. Peshkov in 1944 with velocity about
19 m/s that is one order of magnitude less than the speed of sound in the helium II
[50–55].
As pointed out by Hardy [56, 57], the first sound (or simply “sound,” i.e. the
mechanical lattice vibrations) and the second sound are described by a similar equa￾tion where the variables have a different physical meaning—pressure and tempera￾ture, respectively.
The derivation of a dissipative extension of the Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte equa￾tion from kinetic theory, the Guyer–Krumhansl equation (see Sect. 3.2) provided the
“experimental window condition” , when dissipation is minimal. The second sound
was observed at the cryogenic conditions in other materials [58–67]—solid helium-3
[7, 68–72], sodium fluoride (at ca. 10–20 K [73–77]), bismuth (at 1.2–4.0 K [78]),
sapphire, strontium titanate SrTiO3 [79, 80], in the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
at the temperature above 100 K [81]. In some experiments second sound and bal￾listic propagation “heat pulses propagating with the speed of sound” were observed
together [75]. At lower temperatures ballistic propagation appears without second
sound [22].
At very low temperatures when both the normal and the Umklapp scattering MFP
are longer than the sample length, the longitudinal and the transverse phonons travel
ballistically. At higher temperatures, the normal scattering equilibrates phonons and
the second sound forms. At even higher temperatures, the Umklapp scattering dom￾inates and the heat propagation transitions to diffusion [82].1 Introduction 5
Hydrodynamic effects of the phonon transport, which usually observed at the
extremely low temperatures, become significant in the graphitic materials even at
the moderate temperature due to both the high Debye temperature and the strong
anharmonicity [83, 84].
The existence of the hydrodynamic effects in graphite—a three-dimensional
material—above the liquid nitrogen temperature was predicted by ab initio com￾putations by Ding et al. [85] who determined the phonon distribution function in an
infinitely large graphite crystal under the constant temperature gradient. The authors
demonstrated that at the temperature of 100 K heat transport in graphite is hydrody￾namic in nature, as it is dominated by the drifting phonons. In order to investigate the
robustness of the phonon hydrodynamics with respect to the sample quality, Ding et
al. studied the effect of the vacancies that are treated as the mass disorder and find
that the collective phonon drift motion is destroyed when the vacancy concentration
is about 0.01%, but can still be observed when the vacancy concentration is about
0.001%.
Ding et al. attribute the unusual behaviour of graphite to its strong intralayer sp2
hybrid bonding and to the weak van der Waals interlayer interactions. The authors
also noted that the reflection symmetry associated with a single graphene layer is
broken in the graphite, which opens up more momentum-conserving phonon–phonon
scattering channels and results in the stronger hydrodynamic features in graphite than
in graphene.
The first-principles simulations also predicted the existence of the hydrodynamic
phenomena at the non-cryogenic temperatures in the low-dimensional or the layered
materials such as graphene [86–88], other 2D materials [86], carbon nanotubes [89].
In the all experimental observations of the second sound, the dominance of the
momentum conserving phonon scattering (the Normal processes) with respect to the
resistive phonon scattering (the Umklapp processes, the isotope or the impurity scat￾tering) was found to be critical—the second sound was observed almost exclusively
in the very low temperature regime, with the exception of the experiment by Huber￾man et al. in the graphite [81]. Thus the condition for the experimental detection
of the second sound was found to be τN < τexp < τR, i.e. the typical experimental
observation times τexp must be larger than the normal phonon scattering times τN to
allow the momentum redistribution but smaller than the resistive phonon scattering
times τR to avoid the decay of the phonon wave packet into the phonon equilibrium
distribution [90]. Recently Beardo et al. [90] demonstrated the existence of the second
sound in bulk Ge between 7 K and the room temperature by studying the phase lag of
the thermal response under the harmonic high-frequency external thermal excitation
(the pump laser with the wavelength λ = 405 nm modulated between 30 kHz and
200 MHz).6 1 Introduction
The wave nature of the heat propagation or the time lags become dominant and
the memory,1 nonlinear or spatial non-local2 effects significant [99, 100]
• in the ultrafast heating
– the pulsed laser heating and melting [101–110] (a short pulse laser results in a
more localized heating than a continuous laser [111]; the ultrashort laser pulses
(USLP) have various advantages for the precision micro-fabrication: the amount
of energy deposited into the sample can be minimized and highly localized [112],
the heat flux can exceed 1013 W/m2 [113]. The use of the Fourier equation for
such problems results in the higher lattice temperature and the lower electron
temperature), e.g. the femtosecond heating of the metal films [114–121] or the
thin film of solid argon [122, 123]),
– the welding and drilling of metals,
– the surface annealing,
– the sintering of ceramics [124],
– the micro-machining [125],
– the rapid solidification of liquid metals [126–129] (e.g. the crystallization front
velocity in the undercooled melt can be as high as several tens of metres per
second [130]—the solidification rates up to 70 m/s were observed for the pure
Ni and Cu–Ni alloy [131]),
– the glass transition of supercooled liquids that could involve the multiple steps
of the energy relaxation [131, 132],
– the glassy polymers near the glass transition temperature [133],
– the heat pulse experiments at the room temperature, including “the book exper￾iment” [22, 134–141],
– the sudden contact of the two liquids such as the uranium oxide and sodium
[142],
• in the heat transfer at nanoscale [82, 143–147]
– in the microelectronic and optoelectronic devices [148–156], e.g. the hot spots
in the nanotransistors [157–164],3
1 The memory effects could be related to the inhomogeneity of the medium structure. For example,
position-depending trapping of the carriers or the enhanced diffusion due to the disorder could occur
[91].
2 Non-local effects could originate from the material non-homogeneity since defects, fractures and
lattice orientations interact with one another at a distance which can be relevant at a convenient
scale [92]. Non-local effects become also important in nanoscale systems, such as various kinds
of nanowires and thin layers, since even a small difference of temperature, or electrical potential,
over a small-scale length may generate very high temperature gradients [93–95]. The non-local
formulation of the thermal heat conduction is needed in other situations when the free paths of
the energy carriers are large, e.g. in the electron heat conduction in the models of the flaring solar
“loop” structures [96, 97] or in modelling of the tokamak power exhaust and scrape-off-layer
thermal transport in the high-power fusion devices [98].
3 The integrated schemes (IC) contain billions of the transistors (about 9 billions CPUs in 2015
[165]) that generate the huge heat fluxes in a very small area; these “hot spots” become the bot￾tleneck of the future development in terms of both the performance [144] (many devices have the1 Introduction 7

– in the nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) [179],
– in the two-dimensional materials [11],
– in the heterostructures [11, 180],
– in the layered strongly correlated materials (LCM) [181] such as, for exam￾ple, the transition metal oxides (TMOs) [182] in which the strong short-ranged
electronic interactions lead to the failure of the independent-electron approxi￾mation and which are characterized by the intertwining of the charge, spin and
lattice degrees of freedom and exhibit the wavelike regime for the temperature
propagation at the nanoscale [182, 183],

– in the nanoengineered suspensions for the radiative cooling [185] and the vol￾umetric solar thermal energy absorption [186],
– in the heat transfer in the macromolecule of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
during its denaturation (“melting”)—unravelling of the double-stranded struc￾ture into two single strands [187],
– in the ultrahigh thermal isolation across the heterogeneously layered two￾dimensional materials [188],
• in the heat transfer in a solid-state laser medium at the high pump density or under
the ultrashort pulse duration [189],
• in the heat transfer in the granular and porous materials [190–198] including porous
silicon (pSi),4 in the fractured geological media [208–213],
temperature-dependent figures of merit) and the reliability [166, 167] (overheating is the major
source of the device failure). The hotspot within the transistor drain region where the energy trans￾fer from electrons to the lattice is the most intense can be 10 nm thick [158] and lead to the increase
of the drain series, the source injection electrical resistances and the thermal-induced breakdown
[161].
Sverdrup et al. measured the ballistic phonon conduction near hotspot and the doped resistor
thermometry in the suspended silicon membrane and found that the temperature exceeds by 60%
a value predicted by the Fourier law [158]. Johnson et al. [10] by the transient thermal grating
(TTG) experiments on nanofilms proved that the room-temperature thermal transport in silicon
significantly deviates from the diffusion model already at micron distances.
The Fourier law for heat conduction dramatically overpredicts the rate of the heat dissipation
from sources with dimensions smaller than the dominant phonon free paths [168, 169] that is
very important in the thermal management in microelectronics. However, the scaling problem for
the thermal management in nanoelectronics is mitigated by the phenomenon discovered recently
by Hoogeboom-Pot et al. [169]—“collective diffusion”: when the separation between nanoscale
heat sources is small to compared the phonon mean free path, phonons can scatter with phonons
originated from the neighbouring heat source increasing the heat transfer efficiency to near the
diffusion limit.
4 Porous silicon was discovered in 1956 [199]. Now it is used in the light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
sensors, the thermoelectric devices [200, 201], as the insulation for the microelectronic device;
the thermal conductivity of pSi is two to five orders of magnitude smaller than that of the bulk Si
[202–204]. The nanoscale porous materials are also called Cantor materials [205].
The silicon porous membranes show the thermal conductivity values lower than expected by
porosity and the bulk phonon mean free path of silicon, and the small-pore membranes have smaller8 1 Introduction
• at the extremely high values of the heat flux [214] (>≈ 107W/cm2 [214])—for
example, in the beam deep penetration welding with the heat flux greater than
108W/cm2 [215] and
• in the heat transfer in the biological tissues [216–228].
Note, however, that errors due to the use of the Fourier law at the nanoscale are
not always important. For example, Wilson and Cahill [229] listed three reasons why
the errors in the diamond thermal conductivity are not essential in the analysis of
the thermal management of the microelectronic devices using diamond as the heat
spreader:
1. The magnitude of the ballistic–diffusive effects in the polycrystalline diamond
films grown by the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [230] will be smaller than
in the single crystal diamond due to the phonon scattering by the grain boundaries
that reduces the amount of the heat carried by the long mean-free-path phonons
[231];
2. At least for the GaN devices such as the high electron mobility transistors
(HEMTs) the substrate thermal conductivity is the major factor in the thermal
performance only when the dimensions of the active region undergoing the self￾heating exceed 1 µm;
3. For the sufficiently high areal density of devices there is no high in-plane temper￾ature gradient.
The non-Fourier effects are also reduced in the semitransparent media due to the
medium radiation [102].
The extensions of the Fourier law allowing to avoid the paradox of heat conduction
are important not only in the heat transfer itself but in the related physics areas such as
the thermoelasticity [232–234] and the piezoelectric thermoelasticity (PETE) [235–
238].
The ultrafast lasers (with the pulse duration range from subnanoseconds down
to femtoseconds [239] or even attoseconds [240]) are used in a wide spectrum of
the biomedical technologies: the optical tomography [241] that provides both the
physiological and morphological information about the of the living tissues and
organs [242], the photodynamic therapy [111, 243], the hyperthermia [244–251],
the laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK), the interstitial laser photocoagulation therapy
(ILP) [221]. The control of the temperature in the treated tissues could be enhanced by
the injection of the nanostructures [252, 253], for example, of the gold nanoparticles
(GNPs) [254–256] .
The relaxation time is the characteristic time taken by the system to return to the
steady state (that could be or not be in the thermodynamic equilibrium) after it has
been suddenly removed from it. The relaxation time is related to the mean collision
time τc of the particles responsible for the heat transfer. However, there is no universal
thermal conductivity compared to the large-pore ones despite that they have close porosity values
[206]. The hydrodynamic-heat-transport models are needed to describe the experimental effective
thermal conductivity of silicon thin films and periodic holey membranes for different sizes and
temperatures [207].1 Introduction 9
relation between τ and τc: in some cases τ may correspond to just a few τc while in
others the difference could be huge (for, example, in the model of the early universe
the relaxation time of the shear viscosity could be orders of magnitude larger than the
collision time between photons and electrons due to the matter–radiation decoupling
[26]).
The origin of the time lag could be the existence of several energy carriers [257]
(the well-known example in the solid-state physics is the relaxation between the
electron and phonon subsystems [258, 259], e.g. the heat transfer from free electrons
to the lattice [260, 261] in the metal heating by the ultrashort laser pulses [262–265]—
the time necessary to established an electron temperature is under picosecond, for
example, for gold is about 800 fs, while the electron-lattice relaxation time is on the
order of a few picoseconds for metals [112]) or the heterogeneous inner structure.
The biological tissues contain cells, membranes, organelles, superstructures, liq￾uids, solid/soft elements (sometimes the tissues are referred to as to the mesoporous
structure [266]). The heating or cooling of the living tissues induces a series of chem￾ical, electrical and mechanical processes, e.g. diffusion, electrical potential change
and osmosis across the cell membrane; the cell membranes could store energy [216].
Thus, the heat propagation involves the multimode energy conversion at the different
cellular levels [216, 267, 268]. From a purely thermodynamic point of view, rocks
do not differ significantly from the biological materials: they both porous, having
various heterogeneities and irregularities, thus parallel time scales are present [269].
There are numerous experimental approaches to study the heat transfer at the
micro/nanoscale [231]:
• the 3 ω method (based on measuring the third harmonic in the voltage during
heating of the sample with a sinusoidal wave of frequency ω) [270–274], including
the differential 3 ω technique [150]; 5
• the 2 ω method [37]
• the scanning thermal microscopy [272, 275–279]
6;
• the bimaterial cantilever;
• the optical methods, including optical pump-probe method [280]
7;
• the coherent X-ray probing;
• the thermal coherence tomography [281];
• the flash method [282, 283];
• the optothermal Raman method [11, 284];
5 3 ω method is based on measuring the third harmonic in voltage during heating of the sample with
a sinusoidal wave of frequency ω.
6 A scanning thermal microscope (SThM) operates by placing a sharp temperature-sensing tip in
close proximity to a solid surface of the sample and the local heat transfer changes the tip temperature
[231].
7 In the pump-probe technique the ultrashort laser pulse is split into two parts: one (“pump”) very
intense excites the medium under investigation while the weaker second part (“probe”) to detect
the physical effects induced by the “pump”.10 1 Introduction

The possibilities of the modern experimental techniques are impressive; for exam￾ple, the recently reported ultrafast coherent sources operating at the extreme ultravio￾let (EUV) and X-ray wavelengths [300] allow measurements of the thermal transport
on the 10-nm scale.
There are also several computational methods of the varying fidelity [301, 302]:
• the first-principal (ab initio) computations such as the density functional method,
frequently used to provide the required phonon dispersion dependencies and the
scattering rates for the phonon Boltzmann equation [303];)
• the lattice dynamics;
• the non-equilibrium Green’s function [304];
• the molecular dynamics [218, 305–309]—either the equilibrium (Green-Kubo)
method (EMD) based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [310] or the non￾equilibrium (direct) method (NEMD) based on storing positions and velocities of
all particles at each step of the simulation, the results of both approaches critically
depend on the accuracy of the interatomic potential functions [311, 312] and on
the nature of the thermal reservoirs on the contacts [313];10
• the Monte Carlo method [315–321];
• the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation11 [272, 326–330];
• the multiscale simulations [331–335].
8 TDTR is an optical non-contact method that applicable to the materials with wide range of the
thermal conductivity (from diamond to the ultralow thermal conductivity of disordered crystals)
and different sample geometries [145, 272, 285, 286]. It is necessary in experiments to account
for the reduction of the effective thermal conductivity of a semi-infinite semiconductor crystal at
high frequencies of the oscillating heat source applied to its top surface. If the heating frequency is
much smaller than the average dominant phonon scattering rate over all branches polarizations, the
steady-state form of the Boltzmann equation can be used to describe the phonon transport process
[287].
9 This method is based on the thermal response of the sample surface to a heat stimulus—also
known as the active thermography in contrast to the passive thermography without the external heat
stimulus—and could be used in two variants: the pulsed-based thermography or the lock-in (single
frequency) thermography.
10 Recent research [314] showed that both EMD and NEMD simulations underestimate the ballistic
thermal conduction observed in carbon nanotubes.
11 It is not straightforward to solve the BTE in general. Even the linearized BTE is still very
challenging to solve because of its high dimensionality. Three common methods have been used to
solve the BTE:1 Introduction 11
The relaxation time is the macroscopic parameter that integrates a series of micro￾scopic interactions and is associated with the communication time between the par￾ticles such as photons, electrons, phonons [336].
In common materials the relaxation time ranges from 10−8 to 10−14 s [337–341]
(e.g. it equals 3 ps–3.5 ps [151] for silicon, 4.5–6.4 ps for mercury, 5.1–7.3 ps for
molten gallium [342]). Evidently, the non-Fourier effects in these case are rather
small. For example, Saad and Didlake [343] studied the Stefan problem (melting of
a semi-infinite slab subjected to a step change in temperature) using the Cattaneo
heat conduction model and found for the aluminium (the estimated relaxation time
10−10–10−12 s) the non-Fourier effects are significant only for times on the order of
10−9–10−11 s and in the region within 10−4–10−5 cm from the phase boundary.
However, the thermal relaxation time could be as high as seconds in the degenerate
cores of the aged stars [26] (e.g. about 4.5 s for a white dwarf [344]) and its reported
value in the granular and biological objects varies up to 100 s [340].
For example, Kaminski [337] reported the relaxation time of 20 s for sand and
29 s for NaHCO3, Mitra et al. [345] found the value of the relaxation time for the
processed meat to be c.a. 15 s.
However, Grassman and Peters [193] and Herwig and Beckert [346, 347] did
not found the evidence for the hyperbolic heat conduction in materials with the
non-homogeneous inner structure.
These discrepancies were explained by Roetzel et al. [348] as an inconsistency in
the early experiments with determination of the thermophysical properties indepen￾dently from the relaxation time measurements. Roetzel et al. obtained all parameters
simultaneously from the single experiment. They confirmed the non-Fourier char￾acter of heat transfer but the reported smaller values of the relaxation times (2.26 s
for sand, 1.77 s for processed meat). The later experiments by Antaki [349] give a
value of 2 s for the processed meat. Sudár et al. [269] analysed the experiments by
Tang et al. [350] and by Jaunich et al. [351] and emphasized that one must separate
the heat sources from the heat conduction effects as much as possible. Although
volumetric heat generation is inevitable in many practical situations and also has a
significant influence in medical diagnostics, it could dominate the time evolution of
the temperature field. Thus, the experiments aiming to measure biological material’s
thermal properties should be designed to let the heat conduction be the dominant
heat transport mechanism.
For observation of the temperature oscillation in the living tissue [352] see, e.g.,
[353] and the review [354]. The errors in the predicted temperature distribution in
the case of the cryosurgery and the cryopreservation can manifest themselves in the
thermal stress distribution [355–357] and estimation of the tissue fracture [358, 359]
– the Monte Carlo method;
– the lattice Boltzmann method [322, 323];
– various deterministic discretization-based methods.
The Monte Carlo method is expensive for practical engineering application; the lattice Boltz￾mann method has only been used for simple 2D structures, the deterministic discretization-based
methods [324, 325] require a large number of solid angles, which is computational challenging.12 1 Introduction
due to the large the volumetric expansion [360]. The mechanical waves caused by
the thermal expansion were also observed in the pure argon films that were suddenly
heated [218].
The investigation of the thermal responses of the biological tissues is required
to be ensure of the patients’ safety during the hyperthermia and cryotherapy. The
study of skin biothermomechanics is also essential for military and space operations
to provide astronauts and army personnel as well as firefighters with clothes for
thermal protection.
Yu et al. [361] used the dynamic low-frequency impedance (DLFI) method to
register the biological tissue subjected to a minimally invasive therapy probe instantly
switched between strong freezing and heating.
To analyse the heat transfer in the biological tissue in vivo one should account
for the heat transfer by the arterial and venous bloods [228, 362–365]. The contin￾uum models of the microvascular heat transfer are derived with intention to average
the effects of a large number of the blood vessels present in the region of interest
[366–369]. The best-known and certainly the most important continuum model was
suggested by H.H. Pennes in 1948 [370] and referred to as the Pennes equation or
“bioheat” equation (sometimes this model is also called “heat and sink model” [371])

where T , , c and λ are the temperature, the density, the specific heat and the thermal
conductivity of the tissue as the homogeneous medium, ωb is the blood perfusion
rate, cb is the blood specific heat, Ta is the temperature of the arterial blood, q˙met
and Qext are the heat sources due to the metabolic reactions (the metabolic reactions
usually could be neglected in the cryobiology problems) and the external source of
energy.

account for the temperature dependence of the blood perfusion rate ωb = ω0

[372].
The different models of the bioheat equations have been presented where the vas￾cular structures of the tissues have been supposed to be uniformly distributed in order
to consider the physical model as a uniform porous medium [373–378]. For exam￾ple, Xuan and Roetzel [379] introduced a two-equation bioheat model that considers
the heat transfer in the porous media called the local thermal non-equilibrium equa￾tions (LTNEs). They modelled the biological tissue by dividing it into two different
regions: the tissue region (muscle, vascular tissues and other solid compounds—the
extravascular region) and the blood region (the vascular region), without considering
the local thermal equilibrium between the two media and introducing an equivalent
effective thermal conductivity in the energy equations of blood and tissue. They also
proposed an interfacial convective heat transfer term instead of the perfusion one.1 Introduction 13
Yuan [375] found that the equivalent heat transfer coefficient between tissue and
blood in a porous model is inversely related to the blood vessel diameter.
The coupled differential equations for the conservation of energy in the tissue and
blood are formulated as follows:

where Tt and Tb are temperatures averaged over the tissue and blood volumes, ε is
the porosity, h is the heat transfer coefficient, ub is the blood velocity vector, a is
the volumetric transfer area between tissue and blood, and Q is the absorbed power
density.
Later Roetzel and Xuan [380] developed a three-temperature model by dividing
the biological tissue into the artery, vein and tissue regions and investigated the
transient heat transfer process between the tissue, artery, and vein in a cylinder
biological model.
Nakayama and Kuwahara [374] developed a generalized three-equation bioheat
models for vascular and extravascular space under the local thermal non-equilibrium
condition and they incorporated the blood perfusion term within the two sub-volume
equations. They considered the effect of heat transfer in the closely spaced counter￾current artery-vein pair. Bazett et al. [381] found that the axial temperature gradient
in the limb artery of the human under a low ambient temperature is an order of
magnitude higher than that of in the normal ambient condition due to the effect
of countercurrent heat exchange in the bioheat transfer. The countercurrent heat
exchange also reduces the heat loss from the extremity to the surroundings [382].
The three equations are derived for the arterial blood phase, the venous blood
phase and the tissue phase with three different temperatures. If the two temperatures
are eliminated, the equation for the single (tissue) temperature could be derived that
contains the derivatives of the temperature up to the sixth order in space (eliminating
of the tissue or the blood temperature from the two-temperature model leads to
the bioheat transfer equation where the blood temperature or tissue temperature
is a sole unknown variable that contains temperature derivatives up to the fourth
order) [383, 384]. Thus, the non-local DPL bioheat transfer model and the two- and
three-temperature bioheat transfer equation model have the same effect on the heat
transport. One may obtain that the heat transfer processes with N energy carriers
depend upon the high orders of the lagging times and the non-local characteristic
length [384].
The deviations from the Fourier law are also observed for the low-dimensional
objects (i.e. the spatially constrained systems [385]) such as the thin films, the carbon,14 1 Introduction
boron-nitride, bismuth [386], silicon (both crystalline and with amorphous surface
[387–391]), silicon-germanium (single crystalline [392] and core–shell [393]) and
indium arsenide (both with wurtzite and zinc blende phases) nanotubes and nanowires
[394–396], including InGaAs/GaA and GaN/a-Si core–shell structures [397], the
graphene nanoribbons (GNRs, the flat monolayer of the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms
tightly packed into the 2D honeycomb lattice [398–400]) [87, 307, 401–407] as
well as the various graphene allotropes such as, for example, α-, β-, δ- and γ -
graphynes [408] and the derivatives of the graphene such as the graphane [409], the
fluorographene [410] and the diamane [411], the trilayer graphene [412], the polymer
chains [413, 414]; in the nanotubes the violation of the Fourier was observed even
when the phonon mean free path was much shorter than the sample length as showed
the experiments by Chang et al. [394] with the individual multiwalled carbon and
boron-nitride nanotubes and by the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
by Yang et al. [415].
The low-dimensional materials demonstrate the size effect [156] (“the Casimir
size effect” [82])12—the reducing the thermal conductivity with reducing the size of
the sample. For example, the thermal conductivity of the crystalline nanowires (NWs)
is significantly lower than the bulk value and decreases with the wire diameter [204]—
the thermal conductivity of the SiNW (one of the most promising nanomaterials due
to the ideal interface compatibility with the conventional Si-base technology) is about
two orders of magnitude smaller that that of bulk Si [163].
The reason for such behaviour of the thermal conductivity is the increase of the
roughening [420]. This model combines the incoherent surface scattering of the
short-wavelength phonon with the nearly ballistic behaviour of the long-wavelength
phonons. The thermal conductivity of the thinnest possible Si NWs reaches a super￾high level that is as large as more than an order of magnitude higher than its bulk
counterpart and shows the non-monotonic diameter dependence [421]. The abnor￾mality is explained in terms of the dominant normal process (energy and momentum
conservation) of the low-frequency acoustic phonons that induces the hydrodynamic
phonon flow in the Si NWs without being scattered. With diameter increasing, the
downward shift of the optical phonons triggers the strong Umklapp scattering with
the acoustic phonons. The two competing mechanisms result in the non-monotonic
diameter dependence of the thermal conductivity with minima at the critical diameter
of 2–3 nm.
Since the mean free path (MFP) is inversely proportional to a certain power of
the phonon frequency, no matter what the distance scale one has for the temperature
variation, there are always the low-frequency phonons with the MFP greater than the
linear scale, the non-local theory is actually needed in the analysis of all aspects of
12 The classical size effects also happen when the size of the heat source becomes comparable to or
smaller than the MFP of the materials, even without the interface or the boundary scattering [416,
417]. This situation may arise, for example, near the drain of aMOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor
field effect transistor), where most of the heat is generated [82].
The size effect is usually less important in amorphous materials since the mean free path of
phonons is short [418], and the opposite trend is observed in polyethylene chains because of the
reduction of the chain–chain anharmonic scattering [419].1 Introduction 15
the heat transport by phonons in the semiconductor and dielectric crystals, especially
when the low-frequency phonons have a considerable contribution to the process
[287].
For energy transport across a thin film or in a multilayer structure the effect of
the thermal boundary resistance (TBR) becomes significant [422–424]; moreover,
due to the wave–particle duality in some cases the electron wave or the phonon wave
effects should be also considered [144]. The thermal conductivity of the superlattices
(SLs) is significantly reduced compared to the bulk values of the corresponding alloys
[425–427]and non-monotonously depends on the superlattice period thickness [180,
428, 429].
The reduced thermal conductivity of the superlattices is beneficial for applications
such as the thermoelectrics [393, 430–432]. The coherent phonon heat conduction has
been confirmed experimentally in the superlattice structures. Such travelling coherent
phonon waves in the superlattices lead to increase of the thermal conductivity as the
number of periods increases. For applications such as the thermal insulation or the
thermoelectrics, minimization of the phonon coherent effect is desirable. It is found
that either aperiodic SLs [433] or SLs with the rough interfaces can significantly
disrupt the coherent heat conduction when the interface densities are high.
As the size further shrinks, a nanowire becomes a molecular chain and a thin
film becomes a molecular sheet. The famous experiment of Fermi, Pasta and Ulam
started the study of the thermal conductivity in the long chains of the interacting
particles that showed that thermal conductivity can diverge with the chain length
(the thermal conductivity scales with a positive power of the system size in 1D and
shows a logarithmic divergence in 2D [434]
13) in the case of the so-called integrable
systems (the FPU lattice, the disordered harmonic chain, the diatomic 1D gas, the
diatomic Toda lattice).
13 The behaviour of one-dimensional chain is more complex, if both longitudinal and transverse
motions are present, as, for example, in polymeric chain [435] that has flexibility—the divergence
could be logarithmic, 1/3 power-law or 2/5 power-law, depending on the strength of the longitudinal
and transverse motions coupling.
The phononic thermal conduction in quasi-one-dimensional system might not be the same as
that in 1D lattice models, because the atoms in the quasi-one-dimensional nanostructures can vibrate
in the three-dimensional real space; however, anomalous thermal conduction behaviour has also
been observed in numerical simulations for carbon nanotubes, nanowires and polymer chains [11].
It is interesting to note that electrical and thermal conductivities show very different behaviour
[436]: for example, the nanotube can be metallic or semiconducting depending on its chirality
while the thermal conductivity does not depend on the chirality; on the other hand, adding 14C
isotope impurity decreases the thermal conductivity and has no effect on the electronic properties.
The heat transport in chain also depends on the degree of its coupling to the environment—the
reservoirs that supplies the heat; Velizhanin et al. [437] distinguish three regimes
• weak coupling: energy input from the reservoir limits the heat flow;
• strong coupling: the lattice dynamics are distorted by the presence of the reservoir;
• intermediate coupling: thermal transport is determined by the intrinsic chain parameters.
The discrete chain system with long-range interactions could be transformed into continuous
medium models with fractional derivatives [438].16 1 Introduction
Moreover, the heat transport through the chain depends on the boundary conditions
and variation of these conditions could change the disordered chain from a heat
superconductor to a heat insulator [439].
Casati and Mejia-Monasterio [440] showed that while the absence of the total
momentum conservation is necessary for the emergence of the Fourier law in the
dynamical system of the interacting particles, the exponential instability (Lyapunov
chaos) is not needed for the establishment of the Fourier law. Hence, the Fourier law
can be derived from the laws of quantum mechanics since the main feature of the
quantum motion is the lack of the exponential dynamic instability [441].
These problems as well as their connection to the extremely high thermal conduc￾tivity of the carbon and boron nitride nanotubes [394, 395] and the graphene [284,
399, 442, 443], borophene [444], phosphorene [445, 446], silicene [447] sheets or
hybrid graphene/silicene monolayers [448] and diamond-like bilayer graphene [449]
as well as the strain effects on the heat transfer in nanostructures [449–453] are not
considered in this book—these topics are examined in detail in the reviews

nanodevices and cooling of the electronic circuits and such topics as the temper￾ature jump boundary condition or the thermal boundary resistance [37, 424, 427,
455–458] or the heat transfer via convection or radiation [459].

Phase-Lag Models
A number of the non-Fourier models have been developed that are based on the
modification of the constitutive relation between the heat flux and the temperature
gradient1 for media with thermal memory or/and with a discrete structure [3]. Most
of these models incorporate the time non-locality for materials with memory [4, 5]
(the hereditary materials, including the fractional hereditary materials [6]), some are
also considered as the space non-locality, i.e. materials with the non-homogeneous
inner structure.
Sobolev [7] suggested to distinguish the strong non-locality (the non-local effects
in the transport processes are described in the integral form of the balance equations)
and the weak non-locality (the parameters related to the internal characteristic time
and space scales are introduced into the differential balance equations). Takahashi [8]
noted that the space non-locality is related to the introduction of the scale intermediate
between the microscale and the nanoscale—the mesoscale. Studying the non-local
phenomena helps researchers to capture the microscopic effects at the macroscopic
level with greater accuracy.
The non-Fourier models must be compatible with the kinetic theory of gases—the
rarefied gases have the best understood microscopic composition among continua
(the macroscopic equations from the moment series expansion of the kinetic theory
are instructive in this respect)—and with the second law of the thermodynamics
1 However, Razi-Naqvi and Waldenstrom [1] suggested a non-Fourier heat conduction equation
∂T
∂t = λ(1 − e−t/τ )∇2 T
termed “the new heat equation” (NHE) that is essentially based on the Fourier constitutive relation
q = −λeff∇T with the time-dependent thermal conductivity λeff = λ(1 − e−t/τ ). In the long-time
limit the NHE reduces to the Fourier equation.
It is stated that the NHE overcomes the artificial wavefront observed in some models [2].

and the spacetime requirements of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics that are
universal, independent of the material composition and properties, and therefore their
consequences are universal as well [9]. The thermophysical fields and the constitutive
models should be frame-indifferent (sometimes this property is called objectivity)
[10–13].
One should remember that strictly speaking, a temperature has a well-established
meaning only in global equilibrium when the heat flux is zero [14]—a temperature at
a point can be defined only under the local thermodynamic equilibrium that is valid
only for a relatively weak deviation from equilibrium, thus a meaningful temperature
can be defined only at points separated on an average by the mean free path of the
energy carries [15, 16].
The meaning of temperature is related with the heat transport [14, 17]. Different
degrees of freedom, far from equilibrium, may be associated with the different “tem￾peratures”. Jou and Cimmelli [18] stated the question: how do the gradients of these
different temperatures contribute to heat transport?
The nonlinearity in the heat conduction equation is expressed in two ways—as
the temperature dependence of the material thermophysical properties and as the
presence of the nonlinear products of the temperature gradient or the heat flux [19,
20].
The constitutive relation (1.1) could be formulated in the integral form [21, 22]
(“the integrated history of the temperature gradient” [2]) similar to the theory of the
nonlinear materials (e.g. the viscoelastic materials [23]) in which the stress at the
point depends on the deformation gradients at the previous instants [24–26].
A general expression for the heat flux in the nonlinear materials with memory
as the convolution integral was written by Gurtin and Pipkin half a century ago in
analogy with the stress–strain relationship of the viscoelastic materials as [27] (see
also the paper by Coleman and Gurtin [28])
q = − t

where Q(s) is a positive decreasing function (called the relaxation kernel of the
Jeffreys’s type [29–32] after H. Jeffrey who used similar relations for the rheological
description of the earth core [33], also called the memory kernel) tending to zero as
s → ∞. This is an example of the strong time non-locality in terms of Sobolev [7].
Equation (2.1) is a particular case of the relation between the flux J(t) at a given
time t and the conjugated thermodynamic force X(t
) at the previous times t [34]

.2 Phase-Lag Models 41
In the classical transport theory the fluxes J and the thermodynamics forces X are
related by the linear law J(t) = Lˆ · X(t)where Lˆ denotes suitable phenomenological
coefficients.
Different choices of the memory kernel lead to different constitutive relations
and thus different heat conduction equations. For example, if the memory kennel is
chosen as the Mittag–Leffler function, a fractional-order constitutive equation will
occur [35].
The condition that the relaxation kernel Q(t − t
)is the decreasing function means
the decrease of the relevance of the older temperature gradients in comparison with
the newer ones, thus the term “fading memory” [36] is used.
Herrera [37] has recently considered the heat conduction that contravenes the
“fading memory” paradigm with the relaxation kernel of the form
Q(t − t

) = c

1 − e− t−t
τ

.
Evidently, in this case the older temperature gradients have more influence on the
heat flux than the present ones and the most impotent contribution to q is from the
remote past (t → −∞).
Differentiation of Eq. (2.1) with this kernel that represents the extreme case of
the violation of the fading memory paradigm gives the equation

The author considered two problems where such kernel is relevant:
1. The thermohaline convection that is observed when a layer of warm salt water is
above a layer of fresh cold water and due to the cooling of the warm salt water
the “salt fingers” appear in the freshwater layer. Instabilities of this kind can also
occur in stars [38].
2. The secular stability of the nuclear burning when the hydrogen falling onto the
surface of a neutron star in a close binary system undergoes nuclear fusion, inde￾pendently on how low the temperature may be. The nuclear instability appears
whenever the characteristic time for the increasing of the thermal energy gener￾ated by the nuclear burning is smaller than the time required for the removal of
this energy.
Note that selection of the integral domain (∞, t] instead of [0, t] means that the
initial effects are implicitly neglected [37].
As Sobolev [39] noted when for the heat flux the constitutive relation in the integral
form is used it is natural to apply the integral form of the energy conservation law
for the non-local media

For Q(s) = λδ(s) where δ(s) is the one-sided Dirac delta function [29]

δ(s)ds = 1
we get the Fourier law (1.1), i.e. the Fourier law corresponds to the “zero-memory”
material.
There are also a few other definitions related to the “memory” that are used in the
literature [40]:
• “Full memory” means that there is no fading, i.e. the relaxation kernel is constant
and

• “Long-tail memory”: such long-tail power kernel Q(t) ∝ t−α [41, 42] is realized
via the fractional derivative and integral (see Appendix)
q(t) = −λDα
a+ ∇T (t), 0 < α ≤ 1,
q(t) = −λJ α
a+ ∇T (t), 1 < α ≤ 2,
and leads to the time-fractional heat conduction equation
∂αT
∂tα = κT.
Different choices of the constitutive relation lead to numerous “lagging” models
(see, for example, [43–46] and references therein).
2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation
A well-known example of the constitutive heat flux equation of the Jeffreys type is
[29, 47]
τ
∂q
∂t
+ q = −λ∇T − τ λ1
∂
∂t
∇T. (2.4)
For the case λ1 = 0, Eq. (2.4) reduces to the well-known Cattaneo (also called
Maxwell2–Cattaneo–Vernotte (MCV) [9, 49, 50] or Maxwell-Chester–Cattaneo–
Vernotte [51]) constitutive relation that was independently formulated by Philip M.
Morse and Hermann Feshbach in their famous monograph “Methods of Theoretical
Physics” [52], by Harold Grad (1958), by Carlo Cattaneo (1958) [53] and by Pierre
Vernotte (1958) [54, 55] (see also [56, 57])
τ
∂q
∂t
+ q = −λ∇T (2.5)
2 As noted Müller [48], Maxwell indeed wrote the equation for the heat flux with a rate term derived
in the kinetic theory of gases in his papers of 1867 and 1879, but he finally dismissed it as being
small and uninteresting.44 2 Phase-Lag Models
If additionally τ = 0 Eq. (2.4) reduces to the Fourier law. The termτ ∂q/∂t introduced
in a reasonable (but arbitrary) manner is sometimes referred to as “thermal inertia”
[58].
Coleman et al. [59, 60] extended the Cattaneo equation (2.5) to the anisotropic
case
τˆ
∂q
∂t
+ q = −λˆ∇T
where τˆ and λˆ are the non-singular second-order tensors that, as function of temper￾ature, depend on the material under consideration.
Sobolev [61] suggested to extend the Cattaneo equation with additional second￾order space derivatives
τ
∂q
∂t
+ q = −λ∇T + l
2
e q
where le is the space non-locality of the heat transfer process (correlation length),
which in the case of metal is of the order of the mean free path of electrons; this
equation is similar to the Guyer–Krumhansl equation.
Note that similar relation is used to describe the viscoelastic effects [62]
τ ˙
Pˆ ν + Pˆ ν = −2ηVˆ s
where Pˆ ν is the viscous pressure tensor, Vˆ s is the symmetric part of the velocity
gradient tensor ∇V, and η is the shear viscosity.
The Cattaneo constitutive relation (sometimes called “modification of the Fourier
law” (MFL) [57]) is obtained if in the general Gurtin–Pipkin relation (2.1) the relax￾ation kernel is chosen as
Q(s) = κ
τ
e− t−t
τ
where κ = λ/(ρC) is the thermal diffusivity.
Thus the Cattaneo equation for the temperature (also “the hyperbolic heat con￾duction equation” (HHCE) [57]) could be written (for constant material properties)
as [63, 64]
τ
∂2 T
∂t 2 +
∂T
∂t = κ∇2 T. (2.6)
Earlier (in 1934) the similar equation for the diffusion
∂n
∂t
+ τ
∂2n
∂t 2 + = D∇2
n
was derived by Boris Davydov [56] who suggested the phenomenological system
for the particle density n(x, t) to account for the finite particle velocity during the
molecular diffusion introducing an explicit time interval of the mean free path [65,
66]2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation 45

∂q
∂x = 0, ∂q
∂t = q0 − q

where q0 = −D(∂n/∂x).
Equation (2.6) in contrast to the parabolic Fourier equation is the hyperbolic
differential equation and can be considered as a particular case of the telegrapher’s
equation [67] (sometimes called the causal diffusion equation [68]). This equation
describes the crossover between the ballistic motion and the onset of diffusion—the
transition from the reversible to the irreversible behaviour—at the characteristic time
τ :
• for small times t  τ the first term in Eq. (2.6) is dominant and it reduces to the
wave equation
τ
∂2 T
∂t 2 = κ∇2 T
that describes the reversible process since it is invariant with respect to the time
inversion.
Continuum mechanics and heat conduction are strongly related. Ballistic heat
conduction is the benchmark where the continuum and kinetic theories can be
compared and tested [9]. The ballistic propagation is predicted theoretically with
kinetic theory for rarefied gases. It is attributed to the free propagation of the
particles, when the average mean free path is larger than the characteristic length
of the system. For the phonons the free propagation means propagation with the
speed of sound. From a continuum point of view, it is the limit of the ideal elasticity;
the ballistic propagation with the speed of sound is a thermoelastic effect in a
continuum framework [9].
Based on phonon Boltzmann equation under the Callaway model, it was found
that in the transient thermal grating (TTG) experiments of suspended silicon mem￾brane, for short TTG periods compared to the phonon mean free path, the model
yields a non-exponential or wavelike decay of grating amplitude with time than
an exponential decay in the diffusive regime [69].
In contrast to the second-sound detection where the theoretical calculation of the
experimental window condition [70–72] helped the authors to choose the optimal
frequency for the excitation in order to find the lowest dissipation and making
visible the wave phenomenon, such window condition for ballistic propagation
does not exist. It is hard to find it experimentally, and it requires extremely pure
crystals [73], mostly made from NaF. Moreover, the appearance of the ballistic
signal is very sensitive for the temperature, probably due to the state dependence
of material properties, including the thermal expansion coefficient [74, 75].
The ballistic and second-sound effects could appear both in rarefied and nanosys￾tems under room temperature conditions [76]. In the kinetic theory the Knudsen
number characterizes the rareness of the system. For instance, phonon hydrody￾namics is applicable for processes with high Knudsen number K n > 0.01 [77]. In
such a situation, the second sound and ballistic propagations become experimen￾tally visible.46 2 Phase-Lag Models
The proper coupling between the heat flux and thermal pressure requires to include
the ballistic effects. In the case of rarefied gases the pressure is the complete
mechanical pressure. Thus the generalization of the Navier–Stokes–Fourier system
is needed with separation of the deviatoric and spherical parts of the pressure tensor
[78–81]. Both have a time evolution equation with different relaxation times; the
compressibility becomes significant, and hence the spherical part could possess a
different timescale than the deviatoric one [79, 82, 83].
The ballistic contribution is visible at very low pressures, at the order of magnitude
around 100 Pa, and observed as a change in the speed of sound respect to the mass
density variation [84–86]. Therefore the mass density dependence of the material
parameters (the thermal conductivity, shear and bulk viscosities, relaxation times
etc.) must be accounted for.
The observation of the ballistic phonon propagation at room temperature is possible
in the nanostructures as was convincingly demonstrated in experiments reported
by Siemens et al. [87], Hoogeboom-Pot et al. [88] and by Lee et al. [89].
The solution of Eq. (2.6) for the initial condition T (x, 0) = δ(x) is written as
T (x, t) = δ
κ
τ
t − x

,
i.e. the initial pulse propagates with the velocity √κ/τ without changing the shape
of the distribution [66].
• for large time t 
 τ the first term could be neglected, and one gets the parabolic
equation of the irreversible process—the heat diffusion.
Thus, the hyperbolic nature of Eq. (2.6) is the most significant at short times
τ ≈ t. From the physical point of view, this corresponds to an initial condition when
all particles move in the same direction; after the characteristic time τ due to the
effect of the randomization of the particle motion Eq. (2.6) reduces to the Fourier
heat conduction equation [57].
The value of τ can be considered as the characteristic time for the crossover
from the ballistic motion to diffusion [34] or as the Lyapunov time beyond which
predictability is lost [90].
Jou et al. [34] suggested to describe the transition to the ballistic regime introduc￾ing the generalized conductivity λ(T,l/L) in such a way that for all regimes

The dynamic properties of Eq. (2.6) are analysed under assumption that the solu￾tion has the form T (x, t) = t0 exp[i(kx − ωt)] where k is a complex wavenumber
and ω is a real frequency. The phase speed vph and the attenuation factor α are given
as
vph =
√2κω

τω + √1 + τ 2ω2
, α = 2κ
vph
.
In the high-frequency limit the phase velocity remains finite for the nonzero values
of the relaxation time τ
vph∞ = U =
κ
τ
.
The value of vph∞ diverges when τ → 0 leading to the infinite speed of propa￾gation.
The velocity U is called the second sound and is a damped temperature wave,
while the first sound is the pressure wave [91]. Cimmelli et al. [92] have shown that in
the framework of the weakly non-local extended thermodynamics [93] a small heat
pulse will travel with different velocity in the direction of the non-vanishing heat flow
than in the opposite direction—the heat pulse propagating in a body conducting heat
will travel more slowly in the direction of heat flow than in the opposite direction.
Sellitto et al. [94] studied the second sound at the nanoscale using the model based
on the dynamical non-equilibrium temperature that takes into account the effects of
relaxation and non-locality. The authors examine the propagation of thermal waves
in the heat conducting rigid solids and showed that non-locality alters the speed at
which second sound propagates. The authors used as the reference state value of the
speed of propagation of thermal signals in a rigid solid under the special case of the
Cattaneo law
c0 =
 κ0
ρ0cV0 τ0
and introduced the parameter λC
λC = 1
L
 κ0τ0
ρ0cV0
= τ0cV0
L ,
where L is the positive constant that denotes a length scale characteristic of the
domain of propagation.
The parameter λC plays the role of the Knudsen number, 0 < λC < 1. Evidently,
λC ∝ O(1) (i.e. small L) corresponds to nanoscale and 0 < λC  1 (large L) cor￾responds to macroscale of the heat transport. Sellitto et al. estimated λC to be
λC ≈ 6.2 nm/L in the case of gallium arsenide.48 2 Phase-Lag Models
The authors also stressed that the Clausius version of the second law, which states
that heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold to hot without external work being
performed, does not strictly apply to small systems, such as the individual nano [95],
and even micron-sized particles [96].
Chen et al. [97] using both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation based on
the Cattaneo–Vernotte (CV) model demonstrated that the thermal conduction could
be controlled in a one-dimensional periodical structure, named thermal wave crystal.
The Cattaneo equation (2.6) can be derived in different ways:
• from the Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation;
• in the framework of the extended irreversible thermodynamics (EIT).
The basic assumption of the relaxation time approximation written as (in one￾dimensional case)
∂ f
∂t
+ vx
∂ f
∂x = f0 − f
τ
(2.7)
is that the distribution function f is close to the equilibrium distribution function f0,
i.e. one can assume that
∂ f
∂x ≈ ∂ f0
∂x = ∂ f0
∂T
∂T
∂x .
Multiplying Eq. (2.7) by τεvx (ε is the particle energy) and integrating over the
momentum space give Eq. (2.6).
In the EIT the dissipative fluxes such as the heat flux are considered as the basic
independent variables [98, 99]. The classical irreversible thermodynamics, rational
extended thermodynamics (RET) [100, 101], extended irreversible thermodynamics
and thermodynamics with internal variables (NET-IV) [102, 103] are the special
theories of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics [104, 105].
The most important difference between the rational extended thermodynamics
and the extended irreversible thermodynamics is that the former assumes that the
state space is strictly local, while the latter allows a non-local state space [106].
The kinetic theory-based RET builds its heat conduction models on phonon inter￾actions, thus the transport coefficients can be calculated while the continuum formula￾tion of NET-IV leaves the particular transport mechanism aside, and these coefficients
can be determined through a fitting procedure [107].
Similarly to the CIT, NET-IV uses the balances of mass, linear momentum, angular
momentum and internal energy as the constraints to evaluate the entropy production
rate density from the balance of entropy, whose positive semidefiniteness is ensured
via the Onsagerian force-flux relations. CIT is based on the hypothesis of local
equilibrium.
The NET-IV assumes that the state space is extended by one or more internal
variables. In contrast to the EIT, they are not given any physical interpretation. Usually
[108] it is assumed that entropy is shifted by a concave expression of the internal
variables; the simplest choice is a quadratic function.
If ξk , where k = 1,..., M are M internal variables with arbitrary tensorial orders
and characters, the extended specific entropy is given as [109]2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation 49
s˜ = seq −	
M
k

mk
2 · ξk

· ξk
where mk are the coefficient functions of the appropriate tensorial orders and dot
denotes the full contraction of tensors of an arbitrary order.
In the framework of The NET-IV it is also possible to generalize the relationship
between the heat current density q and the entropy current density J and instead of
the usual expression J = 1/T q assume that
J =

T ˆI + Cˆ

· q +	
M
k
Ck · ξk
where Cˆ and Ck are constitutive tensors of the appropriate orders called Nyíri mul￾tipliers.
It should be mentioned that there is a close system—GENERIC—general equation
for non-equilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling [109–115]. It is based on an
abstract mesoscopic time evolution equation collecting the structure that guarantees
its physical pertinence, also called a metriplectic time evolution equation in order to
emphasize the presence of both the symplectic and the Riemannian (metric) geometry
x˙ = δL
δx +

δ(x, x )
δx 

x = δS
δx
.
where x a mesoscopic state variable (e.g. the particle distribution function in kinetic
theory or the hydrodynamic fields in fluid dynamics), x˙ is the time derivative of x, the
first term on the right-hand side represents mechanics (symplectic geometry), and the
second term is the thermodynamical (Riemannian geometry) contribution appearing
due to the mesoscopic nature of the state variable x. The GENERIC equation provides
a framework (a scaffold) for constructing mesoscopic dynamical models [110].
The basic idea of the GENERIC is the separation of the reversible and the irre￾versible contributions to dynamics. The object of the geometric mechanics is the
description of dynamics without dissipation, and Hamiltonian mechanics gives a
canonical description—the Hamiltonian plays the role of the total energy, i.e. the
integral of the sum of the kinetic and internal energy densities. GENERIC is suitable
for the multilevel description of processes [109, 116].
Heat current density is frequently identified with a vectorial internal variable;
however, Szücs et al. [109] had shown that identification of heat current density with
the conjugate of the vectorial internal variable is more advantageous.
Physically new variables differ significantly from the classical ones that obey the
conservation laws and changes relatively slowly in the system evolution—the fluxes
generally do not obey the conservation laws and are the relatively “fast” variables
[117].50 2 Phase-Lag Models
The local or non-local models of the heat transport could be derived, depending
on whether the gradients of the fluxes are included in the state space, or not [118].
Thus, an entropy in EIT depends on the internal energy and the heat flux s =
s(u, q) and obeys the evolution equation
∂s
∂t
+∇· Js = σs ≥ 0,
where Js is the entropy flux and σs is the entropy production rate.
The definition of the non-equilibrium temperature as T −1 = ∂s/∂u and an
assumption that ∂s/∂q = −αT , where α is a material coefficient, lead (with the
energy balance for the rigid conductor at rest—substantial time derivatives are equal
with partial time derivatives in case of rigid heat conductors) to the equation

The simplest way to provide the positiveness of the entropy production rate σs is to
assume a linear relation between the heat flux and the thermodynamic force in the

where μ is a positive coefficient.
By introduction of the notation

one recovers the Cattaneo constitutive relation (2.5).
Cimmelli et al. [20] derived the Cattaneo relation (2.5) using the dynamical
semiempirical temperature β [92, 119].
The dynamical semiempirical temperature could be considered as the internal
state variable [120] in the classical irreversible thermodynamics [121, 122] (the name
“internal variables” denotes parameters which, when are in equilibrium, reduce to
a function of the standard variables, such as, for example, temperature [92]). The
dynamical temperature differs from the thermodynamic non-equilibrium temperature
by a frictional term which is responsible of the finite speed of propagation of the
thermal disturbances [123].2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation 51
It is assumed that the heat flux is given by the relation
qi = −λ ∂β
∂xi
(2.8)
and the evolution equation for β is written as
β˙ = f ()
where  denotes the state space. In the case it includes θ and β, the evolution equation
for β is rewritten as
β˙ = − F(θ , β)
τR
(2.9)
where F is a suitable smooth function, θ is the non-equilibrium absolute temperature,
and τR is a temperature-dependent relaxation time related to the resistive processes
of interaction among the heat carriers [106].
The function F must fulfil the conditions
∂F
∂θ ≥ 0, ∂F
∂β ≤ 0
that ensure that [123]
1. In the thermodynamic equilibrium when θ equals to T [124] β is a regular function
of T .
2. The solutions of Eq. (2.9) are stable.
The simplest case these conditions are met if
β˙ = − 1
τR
(β − θ ). (2.10)
If λ and τR are constant, Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10) yield the Cattaneo relation (2.5).
The dynamical temperature follows after θ with a certain delay, which is controlled
by the relaxation time τ [125]. The dispersion relation of the heat waves along the
core-shell nanowires showed no difference between the different definitions of non￾equilibrium temperature—the absolute non-equilibrium temperature and a dynami￾cal non-equilibrium temperature [126].
In the EIT the dissipative fluxes are considered as the independent thermodynamic
variables, thus, accounting for the fact that the specific internal energy e is the function
of the thermodynamic local equilibrium temperature T , the state space includes the
heat flux
 = {e, β, β,i}.52 2 Phase-Lag Models
Carlomango et al. [123] postulated the following evolution equation for β
β˙ = e
σ − β
τ
+
A
2 β,iβ,j
where σ, τ and A are regular scalar function of e. For example, if τ (e) = τR(θ ) and
σ = CV τR
β˙ = − 1
τR
(β − θ ) +
A
2 β,iβ,j . (2.11)
From Eq. (2.11) follows that even in the steady state θ and β are related by the
partial differential equation [123].
When the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity λ = λ(θ ), the heat
capacity cV = cV (θ ) and the relaxation time τR = τR(θ ) are taken into account, the
constitutive relation is expressed as

Cimmelli et al. studied the propagation of the longitudinal plane waves
θ (x, t) = θ (¯ x) + θ0 exp[i(ωt − kx)]
in one-dimensional case. Linearization around the non-equilibrium steady state θ (¯ x)
with the average heat flux qx0 = −λ∂θ/∂ ¯ xi gives

In Eq. (2.14) the nonlinear second-order terms such as θ˙2 and (∂θ/∂x)02 were
neglected.2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation 53
In the case of the high-frequency waves (i.e. when θ˙  θ¨ and ∂θ/∂x  ∂2θ/∂x 2)
the dispersion relation is written as

(2.15)
where 2 = qx0 (
√τR/λcV )∂ ln λ/∂θ.
When the thermal conductivity λ does not depend on the temperature θ,  = 0
and U + ≡ U − ≡ U0 = √χ/τR. Equation (2.15) shows that the temperature pulse
travels with different velocities in the direction of the heat flow (U +) than in the
opposite direction (U −). Similar results have been reported in the papers by Coleman,
Casas-Vazquez, Cimmelli and others [92, 127, 128]. In the case   1 Eq. (2.15)
becomes
U ± = U0(1 ∓ )
and the difference of the phase velocities of the temperature waves travelling in the
different directions

Cimmelli and Frischmuth [129] found this difference is rather small for waves in
NaF at 15 K—about 2.1 × 10−4 cm (µs)−1.
Jou and Casas-Vazquez [17] have shown that it is possible to include the non-local
term into the Cattaneo equation assuming that the generalized entropy, the entropy
flux and the entropy production explicitly depend on the the flux of the heat flux, the
tensor Qˆ , to get
τ
∂q

+ q = −λ∇T + 2
∇2q.
This equation differs from the Guyer–Krumhansl equation (see Sect. 3.2) by an
absence of the term of the form ∇∇ · q.
The relaxation time τ is the time lag required to establish the steady heat conduc￾tion in a volume element once a temperature gradient has been imposed across it;
this lag is the result of the “thermal inertia” of the material.
The thermal disturbances in this model propagate with a finite speed

.54 2 Phase-Lag Models
The estimates for the relaxation time in solids and rarefied gas could be written,
respectively, as [130]
τs = 3λ
c¯2
and
τg = 3ν
c¯2
where c¯ is the phonon velocity in the solid or the mean molecular velocity in the gas
c¯ =
 8
π
kB T
m
where ν is the gas kinematic viscosity and m is the mass of molecule. The relaxation
time for metals at the low temperatures could be considered constant [131].
Sometimes the Cattaneo number is used [130] that is defined as
Ca = κτ
L2
or the Vernotte number [132, 133]
V e2 = κτ
L2 .
For example, Kundu and Lee [134] studied the effect of the Vernotte number
on the heat conduction analysis in the absorber plates of a flat-plate solar collector
and found a significant difference in the temperatures obtained from the Fourier and
non-Fourier models for the higher values of the Vernotte number.
The Cattaneo constitutive relation could be rewritten by the entropy and entropy
flux distributions [135]. The entropic constitutive relations provide a perspective for
heat conduction modelling. Analogous to hyperbolic heat conduction, an entropic
relaxation is introduced between the entropy flux and entropy gradient, but this
entropic relaxation can avoid non-positive absolute temperature for the well-posed
problems because non-positive absolute temperature will generate a singularity.
The Cattaneo constitutive relation (2.5) could be considered as Taylor’s series
expansion of the relation with a time lag
q(r, t + τ ) = −λ∇T (r, t) (2.16)
which is called sometimes the “improved” Cattaneo model or the single-phase-lag
(SPL) model [136].
Evidently, the SPL model (2.16) is Galilean invariant [137].
Chen et al. [138] have derived the SPL model equation from the Boltzmann
equation using for the time derivative approximation [137]2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation 55
∂ f
∂t ≈ f (t + t)
t = f (t + τ )
τ .
Recently Li and Cao [139] noted that the Cattaneo model should not be consid￾ered as a consequence of the SPL model since the accuracy of this approximation is
uncertain—the remaining higher-order terms could be very large even if the relax￾ation time is very small and the predictions of these models could be different.
The Cattaneo constitutive relation (2.5) could be written as an integral over the
history of the temperature gradient
q = −λ

exp
−t − t



. (2.17)
Frankel et al. [140] noted that the alternative formulation—in terms of the heat
flux (scalar equations for three components in the general case), could be useful for
the problems involving the heat flux in the boundary conditions. The temperature
distribution is recovered by integration of the general energy balance equation over
time

Nir and Cao [141] have compared the numerical simulations (using the alternating
directions implicit, ADI, finite difference scheme) based on three representations:
the temperature, the flux and the hybrid and found the last one to be preferable, and
Kovács stated that q-representation is advantageous over the T-representation [142].
Sometimes the Cattaneo model is called a damped version of Fourier law (damped
wave equation, DWE) [143–145]. In practice the Cattaneo model is useful for the
low-temperature heat conduction problems [107, 146].
Jou et al. [147] extended in the framework of EIT generalized the Cattaneo relation
to the case of graded materials with the composition gradient ∇ξ introducing into the
constitutive relation the additional terms containing ∇ξ that account for the non-local
and nonlinear effects.
Cattaneo law removes the paradox of the infinite speed of propagation of dis￾turbances but causes another one for the case of heat transfer in the moving body:
the Cattaneo law is not Galilean invariant [148]: while the Fourier law is frame￾indifferent, but does not respect the causality principle, the Cattaneo’s model removes
the causality problem, but its form depends on the choice of the observer [13].
The Cattaneo law is also not Lorentz-covariant [149], i.e. the form of the equation
changes under the transformations

The heat conduction in the moving medium is governed by the equation (in the
dimensionless variables) [150]
∂2 T
∂t 2 + ∂(u · ∇T )
∂t
+
∂T
∂t
+ u · ∇T = T. (2.19)
In the simplest case of the one-dimensional problem and the constant velocity
u(x, t) = U Eq. (2.19) reduces to
∂2 T
∂t 2 + U
∂2 T
∂x∂t

The speeds of disturbances in the coordinate system moving with a velocity U
are the nonlinear functions of U [150]:
c1,2 = 1

U ± 
U2 + 4

.
Evidently, c1,2 = U ± 1, i.e. the sum or the difference of the dimensionless frame
velocity and the thermal wave speed.
This paradox is removed when instead of the partial time derivative a material
derivative is used [150]. According to the Galilean principle of relativity the equation
should be the same in the inertial moving frame, i.e. do not change under the Galilean
transformation
ξ = x − Ut, τ = t.
In the general 3D case the Cattaneo relation in the material framework is written
as
q + τ
 ∂
∂t
+ u · ∇
q = κ∇T. (2.20)
Equation (2.20) cannot be resolved with respect to the heat flux, and thus a single
equation for the temperature cannot be derived [150].
Later Hristov [151] suggested to use the frame-indifferent upper-convected [152]
Oldroyd derivative and to write the Cattaneo equation (2.5) as
τ

∂q
∂t

Hristov showed that Eq. (2.21) retains its form under the change of variables corre￾sponding to the frame that moves with a constant velocity.
Müller and Ruggeri [48] formulated the constitutive equations for the heat and
momentum transfer in fluids in the non-inertial frame using the extended thermo￾dynamics and kinetic theory. They replaced the time derivative of the heat flux by
∂qi/∂t + qk (∂vi/∂xk ) − 2qkWik where v is the fluid velocity and W is the angular
velocity matrix. The first additional term qk (∂vi/∂xk ) follows from the requirement
of objectivity (the so-called Jaumann derivative), and the second can be rewritten as
−2c2(ρhuh)kWik and regarded as the Coriolis inertia term [153].
Al Nahas et al. [13] proposed to replace the notion of the frame-indifference with
the covariance principle introduced by Einstein [154, 155] and derived a covari￾ant spacetime heat conduction model using the spacetime formalism to ensure the
indifference to changes of observer.
Thermal convection with the Cattaneo–Hristov constitutive relation is studied by
Straughan [156]. He observed that the thermal relaxation effect is prominent if the
Cattaneo number is sufficiently high. Stability for the Cattaneo–Christov equation has
been investigated by Ciarletta and Straughan [157]. Haddad [158] studied the thermal
stability in the Brinkman permeable space in the existence of the improved heat
conduction Cattaneo–Christov model. Fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics
of the Maxwell material over a stretched sheet by employing this heat conduction
model are addressed by Han et al. [159]. Hayat et al. [160] simulated the 3D flow of
Prandtl fluid. Zhang et al. [161] studied the heat transfer of blood vessels subject to
the transient laser irradiation, where the irradiation is extremely brief and has high
power.
Chu et al. [162] numerically studied the effect of the radiation on the propa￾gation of the thermal waves. The authors found that the internal radiation in the
medium significantly influences the wave nature. The thermal wave nature in the
combined non-Fourier heat conduction with radiation is more obvious for large val￾ues of conduction-to-radiation parameter, small values of optical thickness and higher
scattering medium.
Joseph and Preziosi [29] suggested to use the relaxation kernel in the form RJ P =
λ1δ(s) + (λ2/τ )exp(−s/τ ) where λ1 is the effective thermal conductivity and λ2 is
the elastic conductivity. In this case the heat flux equals (in the one-dimensional case)
to

The Cattaneo (Cattaneo–Vernotte) model may give the unphysical predictions
such as the negative temperature when the two cooling waves meet [163] or the
jumps at the wavefront, indicating the discontinuity of the temperature distributions
[164].
Kronberg et al. [165] derived a mixed-type boundary condition, and an accommo￾dation coefficient was introduced. When the accommodation coefficient equalled to
1, no temperatures exceeding the boundary value exist. However, the discontinuity58 2 Phase-Lag Models
was not avoided. In addition, it is found that for smaller accommodation coefficient,
the results for the mixed boundary condition are same as that for Dirichlet boundary
condition.
Körner and Bergmann [166], Rubin [167], Criado-Sancho and Lebot [168], Bai
and Lavine [169], Barletta and Zancini [170–172] analysed the compatibility of
the Cattaneo law with the second law of thermodynamics. Barletta and Zancini
also considered the Taitel’s paradox (a temperature exceeding the difference of the
boundary values in the slab whose sides are kept at the different temperatures). In
the frame of the classical irreversible thermodynamics (CIT) the entropy production
could be written as [91]
σs = λ
(∇T )2
T 2 +
τ
T 2
∂q
∂t
+ ·∇T.
Barletta and Zancini found that the production of the entropy could be negative in
the regions where the heat flux decreases so steeply that |∂q/∂t| > |q|/τ . Note also
that the second law does not say anything about fluctuations, and for a short time an
instantaneous negative production could be observed [173].
Torii and Yang [174] studied the heat transfer in the thin film under the continuous￾operated and pulse laser heat sources and found that CV model could lead to the
overshooting phenomenon in the propagation of the thermal wave that depends on
the frequency of the laser source and seemingly violates the second law of thermo￾dynamics.
However, these results do not contradict the second law since classical thermody￾namics is based on the local equilibrium hypothesis [175] that is not fulfilled in this
case [176] and the concept of “temperature” in the hyperbolic heat transfer equation
cannot be interpreted in the conventional sense [91].
Cattaneo law is compatible with the second law in the extended irreversible ther￾modynamics that introduces the generalized entropy and entropy flux depending not
only on the classical variables but also on the fluxes [34, 177, 178].
Li and Cao [179] studied the thermodynamics problems of the SPL model. Using
the expression of the entropy production rate
S = −q · ∇T
T 2
from the classical irreversible thermodynamics (CIT) the authors got for the Fourier
law
SF = − q2
λT 2 ≥ 0
and for SPL
SCIT
SPL = −q(t) · q(t + τ |)
λT 2 .2.1 Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte Equation 59
Evidently, the entropy production rate for the SPL model is not necessary positive
or zero. The second law of thermodynamics is satisfied in the EIT [177] where the
entropy production rate is expresses as
SEIT
SPL = −q(t + τ ) · q(t + τ |)
λT 2 .
Still, the SPL model could violate the second law of thermodynamics by the
breaking the equilibrium spontaneously in the special circumstances. Li and Cao
[179] have constructed the simple example of such behaviour. They have considered
the case
2τn2π

and obtained the solution

of the SPL model equations with the boundary conditions T (0, t) = C0, T (l, 0) =
C0 and the initial condition T (x, 0) = C0.
The coefficient C1 in the solution (3.51) is arbitrary, and the initial equilibrium
T = C0 could be broken spontaneously. Note that both Fourier and Cattaneo models
preserve the equilibrium [179]:

Glass et al. [180] numerically studied the Cattaneo heat conduction in a semi￾infinite slab with the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity λ = λ0(1 + βT )
and found that the nonlinear thermal conductivity alters the speed of the thermal
front.
In biological problems the Cattaneo equation is called the thermal wave model
or the thermal wave model bioheat transfer (TWMBT) [181–184]; sometimes the
terms the “heat wave” or “temperature wave” are also used [185, 186].
Conejero et al. [176] studied the chaotic asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of
the Cauchy problem for the hyperbolic heat transfer Eq. (2.6)

T (0, x) = φ1(x), x ∈ R
∂T
∂t (0, x) = φ2(x), x ∈ R
whereφ1(x) andφ2(x) are the initial temperature and the initial temperature variation.60 2 Phase-Lag Models
The authors expressed the hyperbolic heat transfer equation as a first-order equa￾tion and represented the solutions as a C0-semigroup3 on the product of the certain
function space X with itself [187] and showed that this semigroup is hypercyclic and
chaotic in the sense of Devaney [176].
Cattaneo equation can be derived using non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
and the assumption of the near equilibrium state (thus accepting Maxwellian as the
non-equilibrium distribution) [188, 189].
Podio-Guidugli [190] (see also [191]) derived the Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte￾type equations using the splitting the entropy into the standard and dissipative parts.
Compte and Metzler [35] suggested three possible generalization of the Cattaneo
equations (GCE) using the generalization of the constitutive equation
q(r, t) + τ γ ∂γ q
∂t γ = −λ∇T
and continuity equation
∂γ T
∂t γ = −q(r, t).
The generalization is written as follows:
• GCE I
∂γ T
∂t γ
+ τ γ ∂2γ q
∂t 2γ = −λT
• GCE II
∂2−γ T

The equation GCE III is equivalent to

∂1+γ q
∂t 1+γ = T.
Compte and Metzler analysed the behaviour of solutions of GCE I–GCE III equa￾tions in the short-time and long-time limits and found that in the former GCE II
describes the pure ballistic propagation, while the signal propagation velocity is infi￾3 A family {Tt}t≥0 of linear continuous operators on the Banach space X is called C0-semigroup if

nite in the case of GCE I and GCE III. In the long-time limit GCE I and GCE III
show that subdiffusion and GCE II correspond to the superdiffusive transport.
2.1.1 “Relativistic” Heat Conduction
Ali and Zhang [51] introduced the HHCE-like “relativistic” heat conduction equation
(RHE) using the weaker interpretation of the relativity theory (relativity in the strong
sense deals with objects moving at speeds comparable with speed of light): the weak
relativity is concerned with objects moving at speeds comparable with the limiting
speed C of the signal propagation in the medium involved.
Ali and Zhang used four-dimensional (Minkowski) space–time (τ, x, y,z) coor￾dinate system where τ has a length dimension. The authors set τ = iCt with i being
the imaginary unit constant; there are no restrictions on the numeric value of C

stressed that the imaginary component in Eq. (2.23) is the manifestation of the wave
nature of heat conduction and that no information on the microstructure of the heat
conducting medium is needed.

In contrast to the Cattaneo model the “relativistic” heat conduction equation does

2.2 Dual-Phase-Lag Model
To include effects of both the relaxation and the microstructure, Tzou [192–194]
introduced the dual-phase-lag (DPL) model
q(r, t + τq ) = −λ∇T (r, t + τT ) (2.25)
where τq and τT are the phase lags for the heat flux vector and for the temperature
gradient, respectively, arising from the “thermal inertia” and the “microstructural
interaction” [195]; these parameters are the intrinsic properties of the material. The
phase lag of the heat flux can be interpreted as the time delay due to the fast transient
effect of the thermal inertia, while the phase lag of the temperature gradient represents
the effect of the phonon–electron interactions and the phonon scattering during the
ultrafast heat transfer [196].
Tang and Araki [197] (see also the paper by Shen and Zhang [198]) distinguish
four heat propagation modes of the DPL model:
• wave mode (τT = 0);
• wavelike mode (0 < τT < τq );
• diffusion mode (τT = τq );
• overdiffusion mode (τT > τq ).
Askarizadeh and Ahmadikia [199] suggested to distinguish the modes according
to whether the heat flux is the cause of temperature gradient in the medium (over
diffused or flux precedence heat flow) or the temperature gradient is the cause of
heat flux (gradient precedence heat flow).
Zhang et al. [200] considered the damping of the thermal waves measured as
the relative decrease of the temperature and the heat flux for the Cattaneo and the
DPL models (and for the thermomass model, see below ) and introduced the dimen￾sionless “damping factor” ξ = L/
√κτ . In the case of the heat conduction by the
photon transport this factor is shown to be inversely proportional to the Knudsen
number (K n = l/L, l is the mean free path of phonons) ξ = √3/K n—the decrease
of the Knudsen number reflects stronger collisions between phonons and thus quicker
damping of the energy transported by the thermal wave. In contrast to the SPL model
that could lead to unphysical infinite value of the local heat [201] the DPL model
smooths such wavefront and eliminates these infinite values [202].
The DPL model reduces to the SPL model when τT = 0 and to the Fourier law if
τT = τq = 0.
Both relaxation times are very small for common materials. For example, the
phase lags τq and τT for gold are 8.5 ps and 90 ps, respectively [203]. The relaxation
time τT was found by the molecular dynamics computations to be smaller than τq
and both times being in the range from a few picoseconds to tens of picoseconds in
the pure solid argon films and films with vacancy defects [204].
Goicochea et al. [205] found for the bulk silicon from the molecular dynamics
computations that the relaxation time τq is inversely proportional to the cube of64 2 Phase-Lag Models
the temperature τq ∝ T −3 and to the temperature τq ∝ T −1 when the temperature
is higher than the Debye temperature. Thus, the thermal wave travels faster at the
higher temperature [206].
There is a lot of controversies in the literature concerning the values of relaxation
times for the biological tissues. For the processed meat the values of τq and τT are
estimated as 14–16 s and 0.043–0.056 s[207], and experiments with the muscle tissue
from cow give values 7.36–8.43 s and 14.54–21.03 s [208]. Zhang [209] estimated
the relaxation times in terms of the blood and tissue properties and the interphase
convective heat exchange coefficient and found them to be close to each other.
Equation (2.25) could be rewritten as
q(r, t) = −λ∇T (r, t + (τT − τq )) (2.26)
Thus, the solution of the DPL model does not depend on the relaxation times τT
and τq separately but only on their difference [210], and the SPL and the DPL models
are mathematically equivalent [211–213].
Fabrizio et al. [212, 214] showed that there are mathematical conditions in addi￾tion to the physical ones to obtain an exponentially stable equilibrium solution for
DPL equation. Such condition requires the negative time delay τd (called the retarded
effect) between the heat flux and temperature gradient τd = τq − τT ≤ 0. The oppo￾site case, i.e. τd > 0 is mathematically ill-posed which enlightens the validity of the
MCV equation but excludes equations based on the arbitrary Taylor series expansion.
The DPL model is closely related [215] to the hyperbolic models that describe
the energy exchange in the systems composed of two subsystems, each with its own
temperatures [34], for example, between the electrons and the phonons in the solids
by a pair of the coupled nonlinear equations governing the effective temperatures
of the electrons and the phonons [3, 136, 216–222] (the two-temperature models,
TTM).
Two-temperature models are valid if the time needed to establish the equilibrium
within each subsystem is much less than the time needed to establish the equilibrium
between them [3]. In this case it is possible to assign an individual temperature to
each subsystem and reduce the thermal problem in the system to the determination
of the space–time evolution of these temperatures with an account for the energy
exchange between the subsystems [117].
For example, it is assumed that the electron and phonon subsystems in the solids
are at their local equilibrium, the heat conduction by phonons is neglected, and the
lattice temperature is near or above the Debye temperature (thus the electron–electron
and electron-defect scatterings are insignificant compared with the electron–phonon
scattering [186]). Electrons play a major role in the heat transport in metals; often it is
assumed that electrons move with the velocity of the order of the Fermi velocity [3].
The equations of the TTM for the one-dimensional case could be written as

where Te is the temperature of the electron gas, Tl is the temperature of the lattice,
ce and cl are the heat capacity of the electron gas and the lattice, respectively, and G
is the electron–phonon coupling factor that is estimated as [223]
G = π2menec2

where me is the mass of electron, ne is the density of the free electrons, τe is the
electron relaxation time, cs is the speed of sound in bulk material cs = √B/ρm, B
is the bulk modulus, and ρm is the density.
There are other physical two-temperature systems, for example, the protons and
the electrons in the astrophysical models of the accretion flow or the ions and the
electrons in the partly ionized gas [224].
Qiu and Tien [225, 226] suggested a similar model named a hyperbolic two-step
(HTS) model that accounts for the lattice conductivity

For pure metals heat conduction in the lattice is small compared to that in electrons
and can be neglected as well as the electron relaxation time, and thus the dual￾hyperbolic model reduces to the parabolic two-temperature model [227].
Tzou [193] had estimated the relaxation times of the DPL model in terms of the
parameters G, ce, cl of this model and obtained for copper, silver, gold and lead the
typical values of τT and τq about 10−11s and 10−13 s, respectively.

where Ctb = ρtCt/(ρbCb) is the ratio of heat capacities of tissue and blood, Ktb =
λt/λb is the ratio of the thermal conductivities, ε is the porosity of the tissue, and G
is “the lumped convection-perfusion parameter”.
Gonzalez-Narvaez et al. [228] developed the two-temperature model for the heat
conduction in solids with internal structure. The model is based on the fact that the
total internal energy of the system u may be separated in two parts u = u M + um,
namely the part associated with the macroscopic length scale processes u M and the
part related to processes taking place in the microscopic length scale um.
Each of the internal energies is related to a quasi-temperature referred to as the
macrotemperature TM = u M /CM and the microtemperature Tm = um/Cm where C
is he heat capacity at constant volume. The total (measurable) temperature of the
system is given by the average value
T = CM TM + Cm Tm
CM + Cm
.
The two-temperature model for heat transport in the rigid solid could be interpreted
as the model in which one of the temperatures accounts for the deviation of the
system from the Fourier behaviour [228].
There are three sources of dissipation: (1) processes on the macroscopic scale, (2)
processes at the microscopic scale and (3) interaction processes—energy exchange—
between the two subsystems.
The heat fluxes could be written (in the one-dimensional case) as

Deriving an equation for the single temperature in the three-carrier system (e.g.
the composite with three constituents or the polar semiconductor where the heat2.2 Dual-Phase-Lag Model 67
could be transported by electrons, holes and phonons) Tzou and Dai found that the
nonlinear effects are related to the τ 2
q and τ 2
T .
Depending on the value of phase lags, the alternative orders of the Taylor series
expansion can be made to provide a series of DPL heat conduction models [229, 230].
Using the first-order expansion for both τq and τT in Eq. (2.25) gives the constitutive
relation

Inserting this relation in the energy conservation law results in the so-called type I
[213, 229, 231] (also linear [232] or first-order [230]) DPL model.
The first-order DPL bioheat transfer equation is written as

and even in terms of the heat flux potential φ defined by the equation q = ∇φ [234].
Wang et al. [234] proved the well-posedness of the DPL model on a finite one￾dimensional region under the uniform Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin conditions. Later
Wang and Xu [235] extended this result to the n-dimensional case.
Type II DPL model [213] is obtained when the first-order and the second-order

Sometimes the other notation is used to distinguish the DPL models, indicating
the orders of the Taylor expansions, for example, DPL (2,1) [237] or just “1st–1st”
order, “1st–2nd” order, etc. [238].
Rukolaine [239] found the solutions of the DPL model to be unstable. He investi￾gated the initial value problem for the three-dimensional equation with the positive
localized source of the short duration. The constitutive equation of the Jeffrey-type
was used. Rukolaine obtained an analytical solution using the Fourier transform
and the Laplace transform for DPL equation assuming the Gaussian source of finite
duration

.
The solution for τq > τT gives an unphysical behaviour of the temperature history,
and it goes into the negative domain in the vicinity of origin at least for the small
values of the parameter σ.
Later Rukolaine confirmed his conclusion for the type III DPL model [240].
Quintanilla and Racke [241] (see also [242]) analysed the stability of the solution
of the different DPL versions. Quintanilla introduced the ratio of the two relaxation
times of the DPL model
ξ = τT
τq
as a parameter that controls the stability of the DPL model.
The author considered the characteristic polynomial associated to the Laplace
operator for the case of the Dirichlet boundary conditions in a bounded domain.
Stability or instability of the solution is determined by the real part of the eigenvalues.
The results of the study could be summarized as
• When approximation up to first order in τq and up to first or second order in τT is
used, the system is always stable.
• When approximation up to second order in τq and up to first order in τT is used,
the system is stable if ξ > 1/2 and unstable if ξ < 1/2.
• When approximation up to second order in both τq and τT is used, the system is
stable if ξ > 2 − √3 and unstable if ξ < 2 − √3.
• Whenever ξ > 1/2, the several models predict the same behaviour.
Restrictions on the ratio ξ = τT /τq were derived from the second law of thermo￾dynamics by Fabrizio and Lazzari [243].
The compatibility of the DPL with the second law of the extend irreversible
thermodynamics was proved by Xu [244].2.2 Dual-Phase-Lag Model 69
Both the TWMBT and DPL models are used widely to study the heat transfer in
the biological objects. For example, interaction of the laser radiation with the tissue,
including the laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) [9], has been considered by
the numerous researches: Zhou et al. [245], Jaunich et al. [246], Liu [247], Afrin et
al. [248], Ahmadikia et al. [249], Sahoo et al. [250], Liu and Wang [251], Poor et al.
[252], Hooshmand et al. [253], Kumar and Srivastava [254], Mohajer et al. [255],
Jasinsky et al. [256], Liu and Chen [257] and Zheng et al. [258].
Singh and Melnik [259] used the SPL and the DPL models incorporating both the
tissue contraction and expansion during the procedure, considering DPL along with
Helmholtz harmonic wave equation, the modified stress–strain and the thermoelastic
wave equations to simulate the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave (MW)
ablation. The authors reported that the effect of the non-Fourier based coupled ther￾moelectromechanical model is less pronounced in RFA as compared to the MWA.
Recently Singh and Melnik published the review of the computational models and
future directions of the thermal ablation [260].
The high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation was investigated by Li et
al. [261], Namakshenas and Mojra [262, 263] and Singh et al. [264]. As the power
of the transducer increases, the deviation from the Fourier results also increases.
Zhou et al. [265] solved the two-dimensional (axisymmetric) problem for the two
cases: the surface heating and the body heating and found the multidimensional effect
to be not negligible.
Noroozi et al. used the thermal wave model to study the heat transfer in the slab
heated by a laser radiation [266] and the DPL model for the case of a slab subjected
to an internal heat source [267].
Liu et al. [182] computed the temperature elevation generated by the ultrasonic
irradiation using the TWMBT model. Li et al. [261] used the DPL model to predict
the ex vivo temperature response to the focused ultrasonic heating of a homogeneous￾tissue phantom and a heterogeneous liver tissue.
Kumar et al. used the finite element wavelet Galerkin method to study the hyper￾thermia assuming the Gaussian external heat source [268]. Ho et al. exploited the
lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solution of the DPL model studying the heat
transfer in the two-layer system [269].
Kumar and Rai [270] used DPL model to investigate the heat transfer in the bilayer
living tissues during the magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment exploiting the finite
element Legendre wavelet Galerkin method. Kumar et al. [271] used the non-local
DPL model to compute the heat conduction approach in a bilayer tissue (tumour
and normal tissue) during magnetic fluid hyperthermia. The effect of variability
of magnetic heat source parameters (magnetic induction, frequency, diameter of
magnetic nanoparticles, volume fractional of magnetic nanoparticles and ligand layer
thickness) has been investigated. The effect of the phase-lagging times only appears
in the tumour region: the temperature increases with the increment of the value of τq
and decreases with the augmentation of the value of the τT in the tumour zone [9].
Liu and Chen [272, 273], Liu and Cheng [274], Liu and Yang [275], Raouf et al.
[276] and Kumar et al. [271, 277] also used the DPL model to study the magnetic
fluid hyperthermia.70 2 Phase-Lag Models
Kumar et al. [278] numerically solved the nonlinear DPL model for the heat
transfer within the skin tissue.
The DPL of the bioheat transfer is used for the assessment of the protective
clothing. Zhai and Li [279] have reviewed different burn prediction techniques used
in clothing evaluation. These methods are founded on experiments performed on
living bodies which are getting in touch with hot water or exposed to radiant source.
Ye and De [280] published the review on the experimental and numerical studies of
thermal injury of the skin and subdermal tissues.
Moradi and Ahmadikia [281] used the DPL model to study the heat transfer during
the extremely fast freezing of the biological tissues (the cooling rate about 1000◦/s
[282]) when the frozen region tends to form the amorphous ice [283].
Alghamdi and Yuossef [284] applied the DPL model to investigate the effect of
the porosity, the evaporation rate and the ambient temperature on the heat transfer
in the human eye subjected to the exponentially decaying laser radiation. Afrin et
al. [285] used the DPL model to investigate the heating of a gas-saturated porous
medium with short laser pulses.
Chou and Yang [286] studied the two-dimensional problem of the heat transfer in
the multilayered structures using the space–time conservative element and solution
element (CESE) method [287]. This method was developed for solving the Euler and
the Navier–Stokes equations of the fluid dynamics [288] and provides the local and
global flux conservation due to using both the flow variables and their derivatives as
unknowns. Chou and Yang found four modes of the heat propagation: hyperbolic,
wavelike, diffusive and overdiffusive. Earlier these authors [289] used the CESE
scheme for computations of the SPL and DPL thermal waves and found that this
method is characterized by the low numerical dissipation and the dispersion errors.
Li et al. [290] applied DPL to investigation of the thermoviscoelastic behaviour
of the biological tissue subjected to the hyperthermia treatment.
Liu et al. [291] applied the second-order Taylor expansion of dual-phase-lag model
for analysis of the thermal behaviour in the laser-irradiated layered tissue, which was
stratified into skin, fat and muscle.
Jiang et al. [292] studied heat conduction in porous material heated by the
microsecond laser pulse. The authors found that the both the HHC equation and
the DPL model can predict the non-Fourier heat conduction phenomena observed in
the experimental sample qualitatively. However, referring to the maximum temper￾ature emerging in the experimental sample, the the DPL model is more agreeable to
the experimental result. The maximum temperature predicted by the DPL model is
still greater than but closer to that of the experimental result.
Gandolpi et al. [293] used the first-order expansion of DPL (2.30) that results in
the temperature equation

as the basis for the design of the temperonic crystal (TC)—a periodic structure with
a unit cell made of two slabs sustaining the temperature wavelike oscillations on the2.2 Dual-Phase-Lag Model 71
short timescales. The temperonic crystal is similar to the electronic, phononic and
photonic superlattices. The complex-valued dispersion relation for the temperature
scalar field in TCs discloses the frequency gaps, tunable upon varying the slabs
thermal properties and dimensions, serving, for instance, as a frequency filter for a
temperature pulse [293].

while the last two are responsible for the damping effects; κ/τq is the speed of

The authors sought the solution of Eq. (2.36) in the form
θ (ξ , β) = θ0ei(k˜ξ+ ˜ωβ)
where the complex-valued dimensionless wave vector k˜ and the angular frequency

i.e. the period of the temperature oscillation in time 2π/| ˜ω| must lay between the
two relaxation times and that the temperature gradient must precede the onset of heat
flux.72 2 Phase-Lag Models
Gandolpi et al. [293] considered the system of two slabs, within each slab the
thermal dynamics is described by Eq. (2.35), the continuity of temperature and heat
flux is enforced at the boundary between slabs. The authors studied the propagation
of a small temperature pulse that not substantially affect the TC’s initial temperature
and can be considered as a linear superposition of the plane waves. Each single plane
wave was assumed to have a real-valued k and a complex-valued ω˜ = ω1 + iω2,
where 2π/ω1 is the temperature oscillation period and 1/ω2 is the damping time.
To quantify the damping of a given mode, the modal quality factor Q(k) =
ω1(k)/ω2(k) is introduced which discriminates the overdamped (Q  1) from the
underdamped regimes (Q 
 1) [295].
Dispersion curve ω1(k) and dependence Q(k) are obtained numerically. However,
Gandolphi et al. [295] obtain the analytic expressions of ω1 and ω2 as a function of k
for the one-dimensional problem in which the spatial coordinate, z, is perpendicular
to the sample surface.
The authors showed that the nature of the solution strongly depends on the ratio
τT /τq . The non-oscillatory solutions (i.e. ω1 = 0) are found for τT > τq , i.e. when
the heat flux precedes the establishment of a thermal gradient, a wavelike behaviour
of the temperature propagation may emerge in the case τT < τq , i.e. when the tem￾perature gradient is established before the onset of the heat flux. The authors defined
lower (klow) and upper (kup) bounds for the wave vectors that can sustain oscillatory
solutions:

Numerous researches used the DPL model to study the heat transfer in the nano￾electronic devices, for example, the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transis￾tors (MOSFETs) [296–298], see the papers [299–304] and references therein.
2.2.1 Non-local Dual-Phase-Lag Model
To accommodate the effect of thermomass (see Chap. 4), the distinctive mass of
heat, of dielectric lattices in the heat conduction and the size dependency of the
thermophysical properties, Tzou and Guo [305] and Tzou [306] have introduced the
non-local (NL) behaviour of the heat transport in space in addition to the thermal
lagging of the temperature gradient and heat flux, in time. The non-local dual-phase￾lag (NL DPL) heat conduction can be written as:
q(r + λq , t + τq ) = −λ∇T (r, t + τT ) (2.37)
where λq is the correlating length of the non-local heat flux that has the same form
of the length parameter in the thermomass model [196].
The natural extension of the NL DPL (2.37) is the introduction of another local
space scale λT
q(r + λq , t + τq ) = −λ∇T (r + λT , t + τT ). (2.38)
Using the first-order Taylor series expansion of Eqs. (2.37 and 2.38) with respect
to both the correlating lengths and phase lags, Tzou has developed the non-local DPL
(NDPL) heat conduction models.
The first-order expansion in the lagging time and the second-order effect in the
non-local parameters of Eqs. (2.37 and 2.38) are given in the one-dimensional case

Li et al. [230] noted that the coefficient λ2
qρc/2λ at the term ∂3T/∂t∂x 2 in
Eq. (2.39) is similar to the coefficient τt in the first-order DPL bioheat transfer
Eq. (2.31) indicating that the lagging time terms with τT in Eq. (2.31) and the non￾local items with λq in Eq. (2.39) have similar effect on the bioheat transfer. Thus it
is possible to model the microstructural interaction effect in space using the lagging
time τT in the temperature gradient instead of the non-local parameter λq in the heat
flux [230].
Li et al. [230] considered the introduction of the non-local parameter λT into the
one-dimensional non-local DPL model

2.3 Triple-Phase-Lag Model
The triple-phase-lag model is obtained by Choudhuri [307] (who extends the ther￾moelastic model suggested by Green and Naghdi [308]) by introduction to the DPL
additionally to the relaxation times for the heat flux and the temperature gradient the
relaxation time for the thermal displacement4 gradient [45, 307, 311, 312], some￾times simply the “phase lag of the thermal gradient” [313] or the “phase lag of the
thermal displacement” [314].
q(r, t + τq ) = −[λ∇T (r, t + τT ) + λ
∇v(r, t + τv)], (2.42)
λ is a positive material constant characteristics of the TPL theory (“the rate of
thermal conductivity”).
Falahatkar et al. [315] used the TPL model to study heat conduction in a laser￾irradiated tooth. The human tooth is composed of enamel, dentine and pulp with the
unstructured shape and the uneven boundaries. Earlier Falahatkar et al. [316] studied
this problem using the DPL model and found that the heat flux phase lag has the
significant effect on the temperature profile at the early stages, while the temperature
gradient phase lag is more important at the later stages.
Akbarzadeh et al. [311] used the TPL model to investigate the heat transfer in the
functionally graded hollow cylinder (earlier these authors exploited the DPL model to
study the heat conduction in the one-dimensional functionally graded media [317]).
2.3.1 Non-local Triple-Phase-Lag Model
Akbarzadeh et al. [196] derived the non-local three-phase-lag (NL TPL) constitutive
equation for the non-Fourier heat conduction in the following form to include the
effects of the thermal displacement (the scalar “history variable” used by Green
and Naghdi [308, 310]) and its associated non-local length in the NL DPL thermal
analysis:
q(r + λq , t + τq ) = −[λ∇T (r + λT , t + τT ) + λ
∇v(r + λv, t + τv)] (2.43)
4 Thermal displacement was introduced by H. von Helmholtz [196, 309]. It satisfies the definition
v˙ = T . This quantity was used in models by Green and Naghdi [308, 310] as “a scalar history
variable”
v =
t
t0
T (τ )dτ + v0.
Bargmann and Favata [191] used the thermal displacement in their continuum thermomechan￾ical analysis of the laser-pulsed heating in polycrystals including time derivative of the thermal
displacement v˙ (i.e. the temperature), gradients of the thermal displacement ∇v and its time deriva￾tive ∇ ˙v as the state space variables for all quantities of the coupled equations—free energy, entropy,
first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, chemical potential, defect flux, heat flux.76 2 Phase-Lag Models
where λq , λT and λv represent the correlating non-local lengths of heat flux, tem￾perature gradient and thermal displacement gradient. The Taylor series expansion of
the constitutive Eq. (2.43) with respect to either non-local lengths and/or phase lags
leads to the alternative non-local phase-lag heat conduction models.

Phonon Models
Phonons are the quantized lattice vibrations (the elastic waves that can exist only at
the discrete energies); phonons serve as the major heat carriers in the dielectric and
semiconductor crystals (in contrast to metals [1–3]
1) that undergo scattering in the
course of propagation [8, 9].
In a simple monoatomic solid with only one atom per primitive cell one can have
only three acoustic phonon branches corresponding to the three degrees of freedom
of atomic motion, for monoatomic solids with two atoms per primitive cell such as
diamond or diatomic compounds such as GaAs, one also has three optic phonon
branches in addition to the three acoustic phonons. In compounds with a greater
number of atoms and complex crystal structures, the number of optic phonons is
more than three: if the crystal unit cell contains N atoms, then 3N degrees of freedom
result in 3 acoustic phonons and 3N − 3 optical phonons [10].
The electrons and/or holes may also contribute to the heat transport [11, 12]
(however, frequently the energy and entropy productions due to the presence of
an electromagnetic field could be neglected). For example, the electronic thermal
conductivity could be significant in the special cases, for example, in the channel
layer of the AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) due to the
formation of the high density electron two-dimensional gas [13, 14].2
1 In metals the relaxation of the heat and charge currents is closely related as they are carried
by the same particles. The Wiedemann–Franz (WF) law states that the electronic contribution to a
metal’s thermal conductivity is proportional to its electrical conductivity and temperature. However,
violations of the WF law have been reported for in strongly interacting systems [4] such as Luttinger
liquids [5], metallic ferromagnets [6], and underdoped cuprates [7].
2 Electronic heat transport is also important in the layered quantum correlated materials (LCM).
Moreover, LCM could be considered as the ideal platform to access the entire spectrum of the
unconventional electronic heat transport regimes [15]
The strong local Coulomb interaction can drive fast local thermalization processes leading to
the rapid build up of a hot intralayer electronic temperature before relaxation via slower scattering

8990 3 Phonon Models
It is important to stress that both the phonons and the electrons are not in an
equilibrium state during the heat transfer [16, 17].
3.1 Phonon Transport Regimes
Phonons are the eigenstates of the atomic system and can propagate without dissipa￾tion in the purely harmonic solid that should have the infinite thermal conductivity
[18, 19]. Peierls [20] stated that the origin of the thermal resistance is the combination
of anharmonicity and the discrete nature of crystal lattice.
However, the anharmonicity alone cannot induce resistance—an infinite thermal
conductivity is expected if all the phonon scattering processes that conserve momen￾tum [20].
Dissipation occurs due to the phonon scattering. One should consider the different
mechanisms of the phonon scattering: the three-phonon inelastic scattering such as
normal [21, 22] and Umklapp (both transverse and longitudinal [23]), the defect
scattering (one should distinguish the scattering on the impurity and on the isotope
atom [24]), scattering at the boundaries of the sample [25, 26] that in the general case
should account for the root-mean-square roughness height [27] and the dependence
of the phonon scattering probability on the phonon frequency, the incidence angle
and the surface roughness [28, 29], the phonon–electron scattering [30]; the four￾phonon processes could be important above the Debye temperature [31–34]. The
Umklapp scattering, the isotope scattering and the impurity scattering are referred
to as the momentum-destroying phonon scattering processes (R-scattering) [35].
Phonons, which are the main heat carriers in non-metallic systems, can undergo
not only a diffusive regime that can be described by means of the Fourier law, but
also a hydrodynamic regime (Poiseuille-like [36]) and a ballistic one [37]. Division
of the phonon processes into the normal and Umklapp ones is also applicable to
the amorphous materials [38], for example, polymers (except crystalline one) where
the structural scattering can occur that reduces the phonon mean free path to a few
monomer lengths [39].
Recent studies show that Umklapp scatterings are not necessarily resistive—no
thermal resistance is induced if the projected momentum is conserved in the direc￾tion of heat flow [40]. This feature is especially important in anisotropic materials
such as graphite where phonons dispersion along one direction (“soft” axis) is much
softer than the other directions (“stiff” directions). Ding et al. proposed that a clas￾sification of N scattering and U scattering should be based on the projected phonon
momentum in the heat flow direction and the condition of the quasi-momentum
paths takes place. The interaction may thus act as a tuning parameter to control the relative inter￾and intralayer energy exchange processes in LCM. As it increases, the two processes can effectively
decouple, thus opening to novel electronic heat transport regimes.Mazza et al.[15] concluded that the
subpicosecond thermal dynamics of electrons displays three regimes of heat transport: the ballistic
propagation of energy; the hydrodynamic propagation of energy; the Fourier-like heat transport
driving the recovery of thermal equilibrium.3.1 Phonon Transport Regimes 91
conservation (3.57) should be modified to (k1)j + (k2)j = (k3)j + bj where j is
the heat flux direction. Thus the scattering event is the normal scattering as long as
bj = 0, which holds when b = 0 or b is a reciprocal lattice vector orthogonal to j
[40]. By comparison with the exact solutions of the phonon BTE, Ding et al. demon￾strated that the new classification of N-scattering and U-scattering processes leads to
the more accurate predictions of the thermal conductivity using the Callaway model.

Holland [21] tried to correct the Callaway approximation to improve the pre￾dictions of the thermal conductivity at the high temperatures. He accounted for the
bifurcation of the phonon branches and separately considered the contributions of
the LA and TA phonons.
First-principles computations show that in the pure single crystals the dominant
relaxation mechanism for the phonons near the Brillouin-zone centre is the normal
phonon–phonon scattering while the dominant mechanism for phonons near the
Brillouin-zone edge is the Umklapp phonon–phonon scattering [43].
The semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) (also the Peierls–
Boltzmann equation, BPTE) for the phonon distribution function [44] f is written
as

∂ P =

(3.1)
where P is the momentum, F is the external force.
In the disordered systems the phonon MFPs could be so short that the quasi￾particle picture of the heat carriers is invalid and the BTE is not applicable [45].
To solve the Boltzmann one needs to know the phonon dispersion relation ω(k),
the group velocity vg = ∂ω/∂k and the rate of collisions.92 3 Phonon Models
The phonon BTE combined with first-principles computations has achieved great
success in exploring the thermal conductivity of various materials and understand
the underlying phonon transport mechanism [46–53] provided the phonon branches
remain well separated [54].
However, the convergence of the predicted value is a critical issue, leading to quite
scattered results even for the same material [55].
The prediction accuracy depends on a number of input parameters [56–58].
Among them, the accuracy of interatomic force constants and the cutoff radiusrc for
the nearest neighbours’ interaction.
Jiang et al. [55] studied, using the first-principles computations based on density
functional theory, the origin for the convergence in the 2D materials (graphene and
silicene) and in the bulk silicon.
By iteratively solving the BTE and neglecting the four-phonon scattering process
[59] in the framework of three-phonon scattering, the lattice thermal conductivity
tensor καβ was obtained as [60]

coordinate directions, and the term Fβ

λ is the phonon lifetime obtained under single-mode relaxation time approx￾imation (RTA)—see below. The term β
λ is obtained by the fully iterative solution
of the BTE, which is a correction term to reflect the phonon distribution deviation
from the RTA scheme [55].
It was found that the thermal conductivity of these three materials exhibits diverse
convergence behaviours with respect to the third-order interatomic force constants ,
which coincides with the strength of hydrodynamic phonon transport. In contrast to
the fast convergence the thermal conductivity at very small rc in the 3D bulk silicon,
the conductivity of the 2D materials exhibits a persistent dependence on rc in both
graphene and silicene, which is more pronounced in graphene even up to the 15th
nearest neighbour.
By further analysing the phonon lifetime and scattering rates, the authors revealed
that the dominance of the normal scattering process gives rise to the hydrodynamic
phonon transport in both graphene and silicene, which results in long-range inter￾action and a large lifetime of low-frequency flexural acoustic phonons, while the
same phenomenon is absent in the bulk silicon, thus proved the importance of long-3.1 Phonon Transport Regimes 93
range interaction associated with hydrodynamic phonon transport in determining the
thermal conductivity of the 2D materials.
There are mainly two strategies to deal with the scattering term in the Boltzmann
transport equation [61]:
1. the full integral scattering term;
2. relaxation time approximations.
In the first strategy, the solution is obtained using the empirical phonon–boundary
scattering term [46, 62–65] or via theMonte Carlo (MC) scheme developed to directly
solve the BTE (3.1) under full scattering term [66]; however, this approach is very
computationally expensive [67, 67]. The relaxation time approximations represent
more feasible models for engineering applications.
Frequently a number of assumptions are made: single mean relaxation time
(grey approximation); linear phonon dispersion (Debye approximation) local near￾to-equilibrium; local occupation number; ad hoc or fitted boundary scattering rates;
neglecting the cross-mode correlations.
The relaxation time approximation (RTA) [68]
∂ f
∂t

scatt
= − f − f0
τ
where f0 is the equilibrium distribution function.
It is also called the single-mode relaxation time model approximation (SMRTA or
just SMA) [44, 68–73]), the Callaway model, or the grey relaxation time model [74,
75] or the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model [76, 77]. This approximation is
known to underestimate the thermal conductivity [19, 78], including the conductivity
of graphene, graphite, diamane and the ultrathin silicon nanowires [65, 79], especially
when the strong normal scattering is present [40, 80].
The RTA, due to its simplicity, is useful as long as the size of the samples is quite
large and the experiments are performed under the slow heating conditions. The new
devices reduce the sample size down to few nanometres, and the heating times can
be of the order of picoseconds. In these cases the RTA solution is often far from
the real solution [81, 82]; thus the more accurate solutions are needed such as the
direct solution, the iterative solution or the kinetic collective model (KCM) approach.
Recently Torres et al. [83] investigated the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs,
here MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) from the first principles (using the set of the
interatomic force constants computed within the density functional theory (DFT))
by solving the Boltzmann Transport Equation and found that RTA can result in the
underprediction of the thermal conductivity up to the 50%.
In the local/linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory (LLNETT) the heat
flux density current is a local and linear function of the temperature gradient ∇T that
constitutes the only driving potential force. On the other hand, when the non-local
and nonlinear effects are considered, other driving potential forces come to play with
two kinds of terms ∇nT and (∇T )n with n > 1; the former are non-local while the
latter are nonlinear [84].94 3 Phonon Models
Ezzahri et al. [84] studied the heat transfer in the semiconductors in one dimension
and considered a semi-infinite geometry for the crystal that corresponds to TDTR
and FDTR experiments using the modified Debye–Callaway model [85] in which
both longitudinal and transverse phonon modes are included explicitly.
The semiconductor crystal is assumed to have a cubic symmetry and is treated as a
continuum, elastic and isotropic medium characterized by a linear phonon spectrum
for each phonon branch polarization so that one considers heat transport due only
to acoustic phonons and ignore any contribution from optical phonons. Callaway’s
approximation of the collision operator in BPTE captures the effects of phonon–
phonon normal scattering processes (N-processes). The contributions of the lon￾gitudinal and transverse acoustic branch polarizations are considered separately;
furthermore, any conversion of the normal modes between both acoustic polariza￾tions (inter-transitions) is neglected; only transitions within the same acoustic branch
polarization (intratransitions) are considered.
Ezzahri et al. wrote the steady-state Callaway’s form along the x-axis as

where (τ C
q,p)−1 = (τ N
q,p)−1 + (τ R

The authors found that the heat flux is formed under two different driving potential
forces—the conventional Fourier’s temperature gradient dT/dx and the temperature
Laplacian d2T/dx 2.
The common formulas for the bulk thermal conductivity are based on the kinetic
theory and can be derived from the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation
time approximation by summation of the polarization dependence and integration of
the frequency dependence [86]:

where C is the volumetric specific heat capacity per unit frequency, v is the group
velocity, bulk is the bulk MFP, ω is the frequency, and s indexes the polarizations.
It is assumed that the dispersion relation and the bulk MFPs are isotropic. This
assumption is exact for gases (e.g. molecules, photons, free electrons) and for elec￾trons and phonons in the amorphous materials. In the crystalline materials the disper￾sion relation of electrons and phonons depends on the direction and a more general
form of the Eq. (3.2) is needed [49] (the thermal conductivity κbulk itself still can be

relation could be determined experimentally or calculated using the elastic wave
theory [23].

This function represents the fraction of the total thermal conductivity due to

Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5) determine the range of MFPs that contribute to heat conduction
flux. Often this range is described by a single “effective” (or grey) MFP96 3 Phonon Models

The Eq. (3.6) corresponds to the MFP distribution that given by the Dirac δ func￾tion with weight κbulk centred on gray that is a good approximation in systems where
the real MFP distribution is narrow (e.g. including the ideal gases or the free electron
gases). However, in the systems with the strongly frequency-dependent scattering
(e.g. the semiconductor crystals), the distributions can be quite broad [86].
As noted by Yang and Dames [86], as long as the structure’s characteristic length
Lc is much larger than the thermal wavelengths of the energy carriers and there is no
coherence effects, the group velocity and spectral heat capacity in the nanostructure
are identical to those in bulk, so the only effect of the nanostructuring is to reduce
the effective MFP by scattering at boundaries and interfaces. Thus, the nanostructure
thermal conductivity could be written as

For a wide variety of the geometries (the wires of arbitrary cross section, the thin

and distributions) the ratio nano/bulk depends only on the Knudsen number K n =
bulk/Lc without any other explicit dependence on polarization, group velocity,
frequency, etc. [86].

where fλ is the distribution function of the uniformly drifting phonon gas, τN is the
relaxation time for the normal scattering and τR is the relaxation time for the Umklapp
process. The Callaway dual relaxation approximation allows a simple separation of
N-processes and U-processes.
Callaway dual relaxation approximation provides better estimation for the 2D
materials than the single-mode relaxation time approximation [89, 90].3.1 Phonon Transport Regimes 97
Although the Callaway’s model has been widely used in modelling hydrodynamic
phonon transport [35, 67, 88, 91–94], the direct numerical solution of the BTE using
Callaway’s scattering term has been advanced only recently [91, 95–97].
Guo et al. [98] studied the thermal phonon vortices in the graphene ribbon using
the deterministic discrete ordinate method (DOM) [95] for the solution of the phonon
Boltzmann equation under the Callaway’s dual relaxation model. The phonon scatter￾ing rates of the normal and resistive processes are acquired from ab initio calculation
without need of any empirical input parameters.
In recent years there is the increasing interest in modelling hydrodynamic phonon
transport in the graphene ribbon. The first works were mainly focused on the temper￾ature profile and the thermal conductivity in-plane [67, 95, 99] and cross-plane [91,
92] in the relatively simple rectangular geometries and usually considered the steady￾state phonon transport; the transient transport was studied only in few works [93,
96, 97]. The phonon transport falls into the hydrodynamic regime when the phonon
scattering strengths of normal scattering (N), Umklapp scattering (U), isotope scat￾tering (I) and extrinsic scattering rates (ε) satisfy this relationship N  U + I  ε
[100].
The phonon transport in the hydrodynamic regime could be described by the the
Guyer–Krumhansl Eq. (3.21) where the contribution of the heat flux may be neglected
with respect to its spatial derivatives [37]—a signature of the hydrodynamic phonon
transport is the collective drift motion of phonons that manifests itself in the phonon
distribution function and is similar to the viscous fluid flow [101].
It is expected that the vortex phenomenon of phonons motion may take place in
crystals, in particularity, in the graphene ribbons [102–105]. Yet it has attracted less
attention than the electron hydrodynamic flow.3
There is a demonstration of heat vortex in a rectangular graphene ribbon based
on the macroscopic phonon hydrodynamic equation in a recent paper [108].

3 Strongly interacting electrons can move in a neatly coordinated way, reminiscent of the movement
of viscous fluids, e.g. viscous flows interactions facilitate transport that can allow conductance
to exceed the fundamental quantum-ballistic limit for nanoscale electron systems. This effect is
particularly striking for the electron flow through a viscous point contact, a constriction exhibiting
the quantum-mechanical ballistic transport at T = 0 but governed by electron hydrodynamics at
a higher temperature [106]. Such flows have been observed in ultraclean GaAs, graphene and
PdCoO2 [103]. For example, the experiments by Moll et al. [107] on the ultrapure PdCoO2 that
show a large viscous contribution and yielded an estimate of the electronic viscosity compared to the
water viscosity at the room temperature. The Dirac fluid—a strongly-interacting quasi-relativistic
electron- hole plasma—in graphene demonstrates the hydrodynamic behaviour [4].98 3 Phonon Models

the mediate mathematical quantities to ensure the energy conservation of relaxation￾type scattering term [110], the local temperature T defined from the local energy

Thus, there are no heat vortices inside the system in the diffusive regime.
In both hydrodynamic (the normal scattering conserves momentum and causes
no thermal resistance [67]) and ballistic (rare phonon–phonon scattering) regimes,
the heat flux is conserved in the interior domain [62, 63, 92] and there is no heat
dissipation

+∇· Qˆ = 0. (3.14)
Although Eq. (3.14) is valid in the ballistic and hydrodynamic limits, these regimes
are different. In the ballistic regime [67] the momentum conservation is satisfied due
to rare phonon–phonon scattering and the phonon mean free path is much larger
than the system characteristic length: at the steady state, the phonon distribution
function does not vary with the spatial position until scattering with the boundaries
and the appearance of heat vortices depends on the geometry settings or/and boundary
conditions.
However, it is hard to unmistakably distinguish the (quasi) ballistic or hydrody￾namic phonon transport only by the wave like propagation of the heat, as noted by
Zhang and Guo [112]: the wavelike propagation of heat can be observed in both the
hydrodynamic [113–115] and (quasi) ballistic regimes [116, 117].
Up to now there is no general consent on the exact definition of the terms “hydro￾dynamic phonon transport” or “phonon hydrodynamic”, in particularity, whether the
strong N scattering of phonons is required—see discussion in the paper by Zhang
and Guo. These authors themselves assumed that the hydrodynamic phonon transport
occurs when the N scattering is much stronger than the R scattering.
Recently Zhang and Guo [112] suggested to use a transient heat conduction to
distinguish the hydrodynamic and (quasi) ballistic phonon transport regimes. The
authors studied the transient heat propagation in the homogeneous thermal system
using the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under the Callaway dual
approximation. The authors considered the three-dimensional materials; the phonon
dispersion was not accounted, and the Debye model was used that is acceptable for
studies of the hydrodynamic phonon transport in the bulk materials [67, 92, 118,
119]. The temperature difference in the domain was assumed to be small compared
to the reference temperature T0 , i.e. |T − T0|  T0. The phonon BTE for the devi￾ational phonon distribution function of energy density e = e(x, s, t) which depends
on spatial position x , unit directional vector s and time t is written as

The macroscopic spatio-temporal distributions such as the local energy E(x, t) or

To wrote the dimensionless version of the BTE Eq. (3.15) the authors related the
spatial scale to L, the temporal scale to tref = L/vg, the distribution functions to
eref = CT/4π (T is the temperature difference in the domain) and introduced
two Knudsen numbers which represent the ratio between the phonon mean free path
of the R scattering and N scattering to the characteristic length

Zhang and Guo established that the transient temperature could be lower than
the lowest value of the initial environment temperature in the hydrodynamic regime
within a certain range of time and space. This phenomenon disappears in the ballistic
or diffusive regime and in the quasi-one-dimensional simulations and thus could be
used to distinguish the hydrodynamic phonon transport from the heat propagation in
the ballistic regime.
In the hydrodynamic regime, the phonon mean free path is much smaller than
the local characteristic length due to the frequent normal scattering [62, 63] . At the
steady state, the phonon distribution function can be approximated as [108, 120]
e ≈ e
eq
N − τN v · ∇e
eq

Thus in contrast to the ballistic regime the phonon distribution function varies with
the spatial position. This conclusion was confirmed by the experiments exploiting
the picosecond laser irradiation [121].
Zhang et al. [109] used the discrete ordinate method [95, 122] to solve the station￾ary phonon BTE. The authors studied the phonon dynamics in several situations: the
heat vortices in the 2D ribbon and in the two-dimensional porous materials, including
the porous graphene, using both the grey and non-grey models.
Guo et al. [98] studied the phonon vortex dynamics in the rectangular and the T￾type graphene ribbon that influenced by the temperature, the ribbon size and carbon3.1 Phonon Transport Regimes 103
isotope. The wide MFP distribution of the resistive phonon scattering processes is
the crucial factor that destroys the vortex hydrodynamic effect. The phonon vortex
configuration in the T-type graphene ribbon is found to depend on the height–width
ratio, with the multihierarchy primary, secondary and ternary vortexes obtained.
Shang and Lü [123] studied the hydrodynamic phonon heat transport in the two￾dimensional (2D) materials. The authors started from the Boltzmann equation with
the Callaway model (3.9) and multiply each term by ωv and summing over all wave
vectors and phonon indices to get

Shang and Lü considered the heat flow through the nanoribbon with the length
L(x ∈ [0, L]) and the width w(y ∈ [0, w]) with the temperature difference applied
along the ribbon (x direction). At the steady state neglecting q/τR the Eq. (3.18)

and the total flux that scales as w3—that is the signature of the Poiseuille flow (for
the diffusive transport, the heat current scales linearly with the width) [123].
For computation of the pattern of vortices in the stationary 2D flow the authors
introduced a streamfunction and used a simplified version of the Eq. (3.18)104 3 Phonon Models

The presence of the viscous terms in the Guyer–Krumhansl-like equation of the
phonon hydrodynamics allowed Huberman [124] (similar to Cimmelli et al. [125,
126], see Sect .4.2) to introduce a “thermal Reynolds number”
Retherm = vss L
|v|
2τN
where vss is the speed of second sound.
However, as noted by Zhang et al. [109], this definition is hardly fruitful since the
“thermal Reynolds number” has only formal resemblance to the Reynolds num￾ber (and its importance) in fluid dynamics: there is no convective term in the
Guyer–Krumhansl-like equation and this equation actually is similar to the Stokes
equations—the low-Reynolds-number form of the Navier–Stokes equations.
Recently the progress in studying the hydrodynamic phonon transport in 2D mate￾rials was reviewed by Yu et al. [127].
The alternative approach is based on the similarity of phonons and photons [128].
They are both bosons—their equilibrium distribution function is the Bose–Einstein
distribution. Both phonons and photons are considered as non-local quasi-particles
with zero mass carrying energy ω when the length scale exceeds the coherence
length for phonons and the wavelength for photons.
It is possible to define the phonon radiative intensity by analogy with the thermally
emitted photons
Iω(x, t, s) = 1
4π
D(ω)nω(x, t, s)ωvω,
where D(ω) is the number of modes per unit volume, vω = dω/dk is the group
velocity and nω is the average number of phonons with angular velocity ω moving in
the direction of the unit vector s averaged over all branches of the dispersion curves
of the phonons.
The frequency-dependent BTE (FD-BTE) is useful for both transient and steady￾state cases (see, e.g. [82, 129]). However, despite its high accuracy, the FD-BTE has
two major limitations [130]:
• It requires knowledge of the phonon dispersion curves and the phonon–phonon
relaxation times, which are generally unknown for new materials;
• FD-BTE requires the discretization of the dispersion curves and thus dense sam￾pling close to zero group velocity zones. Furthermore, as all polarizations have to
be included, it becomes computationally prohibitive for materials with complex
materials, where phonon dispersion curves have several branches.3.1 Phonon Transport Regimes 105

The presence of the phonons with a broad spectrum means that there is no the
single value of the MFP that determines the heat transfer regime. The range of values
of the effective mean free path of phonons is rather wide [86, 132], e.g. for silicon
at the room temperature values from 40 to 260 nm are mentioned [133].
The first principal methods predict the different MFP distributions for different
materials, e.g. in Si half of the heat is carried by phonons whose mean free paths is
greater than 1μm [134] while in diamond 80% of heat is carried by phonons with3.2 Guyer–Krumhansl (GK) Equation 107
the mean free paths between 0.3 and 2μm [43]; more than 95 % of heat in sapphire
is carried by phonons with the MFP shorter than 1μ m [135].
The formation of the nanometre-scale phonon hotspots in the semiconductor
devices with the highly non-equilibrium distribution of phonons by the scattering
of the high-energy electrons is important for the analysis of the conduction device
cooling. This process involves the following nanoscale conduction phenomena [136]:
the phonon–boundary scattering that reduces the thermal conductivity; the intense
electron-phonon coupling in the transistor channel; the weak anharmonic coupling
between the slow longitudinal optical (LO) phonons generated by the scattering with
high energy electrons and faster acoustic phonons.
Dong et al. [133] in the studies of the heat transfer in the nanostructures dis￾tinguishing the mean free paths of phonons in the normal (lN = vτN ) and resis￾tive (lR = vτR) scatterings and suggested to define an effective length scale as
l = √lNlR/5 and the Knudsen number as K n = l/L.
The authors also considered different boundary conditions for the phonon gas
motion: the Maxwell boundary [18]; the backscattering boundary; the
MFP-proportional slip boundary.
3.2 Guyer–Krumhansl (GK) Equation
Guyer and Krumhansl [120, 137] solved the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation
assuming that the normal scattering rates are much larger than the resistive scattering
rates that is valid at low temperatures. Earlier Krumhansl [138] solved the BTE in
the presence of sole N processes. Nielsen and Shklovskii [139] noted that the intense
N-processes lead to the phonon distribution function in the form of “Planck function
with drift”; the drift velocity in the absence of the external influence relaxes to zero
through the U-processes.
Guyer and Krumhansl developed a phenomenological coupling between the
phonons and elastic dilatational fields caused by the lattice anharmonicity.
When the bulk phonon MFP is large compared to the sample size—the Knudsen
number becomes comparable to (or higher than) 1, the heat transport is no longer dif￾fusive, but ballistic. Moreover, when the MFP between successive collisions becomes
large, there is a direct connection among non-adjacent regions of the system with
different values of the temperature [140]. In this case the phonon-gas description is
equivalent to the “Knudsen flow” [141] or “ballistic transport”. Such heat conduc￾tion can occur without energy dissipation [142] because phonons can ballistically
travel for hundreds of nanometres. The extreme situation when boundary scattering
dominates over the intrinsic scattering is often called the “Casimir limit” [143, 144]
owing to the Casimir’s investigations using cylindrical rods [145].
However, the control over directionality of the ballistic transport and thus its
practical use remains a challenge, as the directions of the individual phonons are
chaotic. Anufriev et al. [146] demonstrated a method to control the directionality of
the ballistic phonon transport using the silicon membranes with arrays of holes that108 3 Phonon Models
form the fluxes of phonons oriented in the same direction (the silicon films with the
controlled, periodic arrays of the cylindrical holes can be fabricated by patterning
the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device layer [144, 147]). To show the potential for
practical applications, the authors introduced the thermal lens nanostructures and
demonstrated the evidence of the nanoscale heat focusing.
Guyer and Krumhansl established conditions when the Poiseuille flow can con￾siderably contribute to the thermal conductivity.
The Poiseuille regime emerges when energy exchange between phonons is fre￾quent enough to keep the local temperature well defined, and the Umklapp collisions
are very rare. Recently Martelli et al. [148] experimentally proved the existence of
the Poiseuille flow of phonons in the single crystal of perovskite Sr1−x N bxTiO3
at low temperatures. The authors found that the thermal conductivity varies faster
than cubic temperature dependence (that corresponds to the ballistic heat conduction
regime) in a narrow (6 K < T < 13 K) temperature window. First-principles simula￾tions seem to support the hydrodynamic transport claim in SrTi O3, although a much
smaller grain size (4 μm) than the actual sample size (100 μm) had to be assumed
to achieve agreement between simulation and experiment [149].
The thermal conductivity measurements in solid helium 4 in the size effect regime
shows that thermal conductivity scales with the temperature with an exponent of
7–8, because the relaxation time for normal scattering has a strong temperature
dependence [29, 150].
In the suspended graphene [63] and other 2D systems [62, 83] the Poiseuille
phonon flow could be observed at higher temperatures than in the 3D systems,
because in the 2D systems the normal momentum conserving phonon–phonon col￾lisions are two orders of magnitude higher than those in the 3D systems [37]. Such
phonon transport phenomena as the phonon interference [151–153] and the phonon
localization [154, 155] are observed in the 2D materials. For example, Chen et al.
[153] found in numerical simulations that the thermal conductivity of the Lorentz gas
model oscillates with the degree of the boundary roughness due to the interference
between the transporting particles and the periodic boundary conditions.
In the 2D materials the phonon MFP can be affected by various factors [127],
such as doping [156], defects [157], the edge chirality [158], stress [159], and the
substrate coupling [160] .
Sellitto et al. [37] studied the thermal transport in a 2D strip of width w assuming
that the thickness of the layer is much smaller than its other two characteristic sizes.

when  = 0 the Eq. (3.21) reduces to the Cattaneo relation (2.5).
The Guyer–Krumhansl equation is the macroscopic heat transport equation that
provide the hydrodynamic description of the phonon system [164].
Similar equation is used to study the transport regimes and inhomogeneous super￾fluid turbulence in liquid helium II [165, 166].110 3 Phonon Models
The Guyer–Krumhansl equation is successfully applied for the heat conduction in
rocks, foams and biological material [167, 168]. Calvo-Schwarzwälder et al. inves￾tigated the one-dimensional growth of a solid into a liquid bath, starting from a
small crystal and nanoscale solidification using the Guyer–Krumhansl and Maxwell￾Cattaneo models of heat conduction [169, 170].
Sellitto and Alvarez [171, 172] used the Guyer–Krumhansl Eq. (3.21) to study
the heat removal from the hot nanostructures characterized by the radius r0 and the
thickness h0 through the graphene layer with the outer radius rg and the thickness
hg.
Increase of the integrated circuits (IC) density and of the clock speed makes the
heat removal one of the major problem of the chip design. The small temperature
differences divided by the minute length yield the very high-temperature gradients
[172–174]. Incorporation of the graphene could yield the devices that are faster and
more reliable [175]. The heat removed from the hot spot per unit time through the
graphene layer is higher than through the usual materials [171] since the mean free
path of phonons in the graphene l is very long—of the order of hundreds nanometres
at the room temperature [176–180]. 4
The authors considered the simplified case when the heat is carried away radially
along the layer without being transversally transferred to the environment. The radial
profile of the heat flux is given (in the first-order approximation in dr) by an equation
dq
dr + q(r) = 0 (3.22)
that results in
q(r) = 
r (3.23)
where  = Q/(2πhg) is a constant value, Q is the heat removed from the device
per unit time.
4 Hu et al. [181] investigated the diffusive thermal conductivity of the diamond-like bilayer graphene
combining the first-principles calculation and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. This
diamond-like nanoscale film formed by the two-layer graphene upon compression exhibits stiffness
and hardness comparable to diamond. The diamond-like few-layer graphene sheets have attracted
tremendous interest, because of their robust stability and excellent mechanical properties [182–188].
Diamane has high thermal conductivity due to its high phonon group velocity. Hu et al. computed
the group velocity projected phonon dispersion of diamane. They found that the maximal phonon
group velocity occurring in longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch is up to 18 Km/s, which is higher
than most 2D materials and near to graphene (about 21 Km/s). The calculations also showed that
the lowest two optical branches exhibit relative high phonon group velocity, which are close to 9
and 11 Km/s, respectively.
Cocemasov et al. explored the effect of various rotation angles on phonon properties of twisted
bilayer graphene [189]. In twisted bilayer graphene, phonon modes from different high-symmetry
directions in the Brillouin zone can form hybrid folded phonons, which depend strongly on the
rotation angle. Moreover, the lattice specific heat also depends strongly on the twist angle in bilayer
graphene at low temperature [190]. Recently, the covalent-bonded bilayer graphene was synthesized
experimentally [191].3.2 Guyer–Krumhansl (GK) Equation 111

Evidently, the greater the external radius of the graphene layer, the less important
the role of the non-local effects.

[171] introduced the heat-exchange coefficient between graphene and environment
σ and modified the Eq. (3.22) to

Note that combination of the Guyer–Krumhansl equation with the energy balance
produce the parabolic partial differential equation for the temperature and thus the

shock waves generated by a moving heat source [195]. Both et al. [196] investi￾gated the one-dimensional version of Eq. (3.26) and considered the so-called Fourier
resonance condition112 3 Phonon Models

τ = κ.
The solutions of the energy conservation equation with the heat flux (3.26) show
wavelike characteristics if 2/τ > κ and are over-diffusive in the case 2/τ < κ
[197, 198].
In some cases in the nanosystems it is possible that
2
∇2q ≈ K n2  q
since the Knudsen number could be much greater than unity [140, 199]. Then the
non-local term the Eq. (3.26) is more important than the heat flux q itself and the
equation reduces to [163, 200, 201]
∇2q = λ
2 ∇T. (3.27)
Equation (3.27) is similar to the Stokes equation of the classical hydrodynamics
∇2 = 1

that justifies the term “hydrodynamic regime” of the heat conduction and allows to
define the “viscosity” of phonons in terms of the thermal conductivity and the mean
free path. The hydrodynamics is a fundamental ingredient of the semiconductor
heat transport in the nanoscale at the room temperature allowing to explain many
experimental situations in terms of the hydrodynamic concepts, such as friction and
vorticity [202].
Recently Machida et al. [203] showed that making the graphite samples thin
expands the hydrodynamic regime from cryogenic to the room temperatures. The
researchers measured an extremely high thermal conductivity in the very thin graphite
samples.
The Guyer–Krumhansl equation was later obtained in the framework of the nine￾moment phonon hydrodynamics by Struchtrup et al. [204, 205]. Fryer and Struchtrup
used the phonon Boltzmann equation and the Callaway model for the phonon–phonon
interaction; for the phonon interaction with the crystal boundaries the condition sim￾ilar to the Maxwell boundary conditions in the classical kinetic theory was exploited.
The macroscopic transport equations for an arbitrary set of moments were developed
and closed by means of the Grad’s moment method. As example, sets with 4, 9, 16
and 25 moments were considered and solved analytically for the one-dimensional
heat transfer and the Poiseuille flow of phonons. The results showed the influence
of Knudsen number on phonon drag at the solid boundaries that the Knudsen layers
near the boundaries reduce the net heat conductivity of solids in the rarefied phonon
regimes.3.2 Guyer–Krumhansl (GK) Equation 113
Later Mohammadzadeh and Struchtrup [206] derive the macroscopic equations
for the phonon transport at the room temperature from the phonon-Boltzmann equa￾tion. In these equations, the Callaway model with the frequency-dependent relaxation
time is considered to describe both the resistive and normal processes in the phonon
interactions. The Brillouin zone was considered to be a sphere with the diameter that
depends on the temperature of the system. A model to describe the phonon interac￾tion with the crystal boundary was employed to obtain the macroscopic boundary
conditions, where the reflection kernel is the superposition of the diffusive reflec￾tion, specular reflection and isotropic scattering. The macroscopic moments were
defined using a polynomial of the frequency and the wave vector of phonons. As an
example, a system of the moment equations, consisting of three directional and seven
frequency moments, i.e. 63 moments in total, was used to study the one-dimensional
heat transfer and the Poiseuille flow of phonons.
The Guyer–Krumhansl equation can be derived from the extended irreversible
thermodynamics under an assumption that non-locality could be introduced into the
entropy flux as [207]
Js = q
T + γ (q · ∇q + 2q∇ · q)
where γ is a positive coefficient. Cimmelli [208] showed that the Guyer–Krumhansl
heat transport equation could be also obtained within the frame of the weakly non￾local rational thermodynamics [209]; they can also be derived using the extended
irreversible thermodynamics [210].
Lebon and Dauby [211] used a variational principle that is a generalization of
Prigogine’s minimum-entropy production criterion to derive the Guyer–Krumhansl
equation from macroscopic arguments.
Ramos et al. [212] studied the basic structure of the Guyer–Krumhansl equation
proved the well-posedness of some initial and boundary value problems.
The Guyer–Krumhansl equation could also be derived in the framework of the
GENERIC approach (since the GK equation can be considered as a non-local exten￾sion of the MCV model, the reversible dynamics needs no modification, but it is only
the dissipation potential has to be extended by a non-local term) [213].

Cimmelli et al. derived the equation for the coupled heat transfer by phonon and
electrons the restrictions that follow from the second law of thermodynamics using
the generalized Coleman–Noll procedure [215–217]. The obtained equations account
for the non-local effects, which may arise at the nanometric length-scale, when the
mean free paths of phonons and electrons are higher than the physical dimensions
of the system. These equations may be applied, e.g. to the simulation of the heat
transport in metallic nanowires, in which both electrons and phonons contribute,
and extended to heat heat transport in semiconductor nanowires, in which phonons,
electrons and holes contribute.
If the coupling can be neglected, the authors recovered two parabolic equations
for the phonon and electron transport of the Guyer–Krumhansl type; the terms pro￾portional to the mean free paths (i.e. the non-local effects) in these equations are
negligible, the equations of the Maxwell-Cattaneo type are recovered.
The EIT formulates the 13-fields theory and the heat propagation in rigid con￾ductors whose state space is spanned by the thirteen thermodynamic variables: the

The non-local character of the heat transfer could leads to unusual results such
as the heat flowing from the cold regions to the hotter ones. Cimmelli et al. [218]
considered an axisymmetrical problem of the heat transfer in the circular thin layer
of thickness h surrounding a steady source of heat—the hot nanodevice. The authors
assumed that the total heat flux q arises from two contributions due to both phonons
and electrons q = qp + qe. The evolution of the phonon and electron fluxes is gov￾erned by the Guyer–Krumhansl equations (3.21)

The temperatures of phonons and electrons are assumed to be equal (this restriction
has been removed in the later authors’ papers [16, 219]).
The radial dependence of the heat fluxes was obtained by considering two con￾centric circular areas at a radial from the source equal to r and r + dr to get in the
first-order approximation in dr
2π(r + dr)q(r + dr) ≈ 2π(r + dr)

and thus
r
dq
dr + q(r) = 0.
From the last equation follows
q(r) ≡ qp(r) + qe(r) = 
r
where  = (Q0/2πh) is a constant value, Q0 is the heat produced by the hot source
per unit time.
Both fluxes q p and qe are divergence free and thus Eqs. (3.28, 3.29) reduce to

and

and allow to determined the profiles of the phonon and electron fluxes. Finally,

Integration of the last equation showed that in the neighbourhood of the source the
temperature increases with the radial distance. This anomalous temperature hump—
the heat flux against the temperature gradient—is related to the non-local effects
[220].
To prove the thermodynamic compatibility of this behaviour the authors consid￾ered the local balance of the entropy that in the steady case could be written as
σ(s) =∇· J(s)
where σ(s) is the entropy production per unit volume,116 3 Phonon Models

Recently Calvo-Schwarzwälder et al. [169] used the Guyer–Krumhansl Eq. (3.21)
to solve the one-dimensional Stefan problem. Calvo-Schwarzwälder [221] also inves￾tigated the heat transfer in the one-dimensional solid by considering a Fourier law
with a size-dependent effective thermal conductivity proposed by Alvarez and Jou
[222]

and a Newton cooling condition at the interface between the solid and the cold envi￾ronment. Calvo-Schwarzwälder found that non-local effects become less important
as the Biot number Bi = hl/κ (h is the the heat transfer coefficient in the Newton
cooling condition q(0, t) = h(Te − T (0, t))) decreases.
The simplified version of Guyer–Krumhansl Eq. (3.27) was used by Jou et al.
to model the heat transfer in the nanowires considered as the phonon flow [201,
223, 224]. The authors used the analogy with the flow of the viscous fluid along the
cylindrical duct of the radius R under the pressure gradient p/L with the velocity
profile

l = c0
√τr τN is the phonon mean free path, τN and τR are the relaxation times of
normal and resistive phonon scattering.
The Eq. (3.31) gives a quadratic dependence of the effective thermal conductivity
on the nanowire radius while experiments show the linear variation [201]. Alvarez
et al. assumed that the heat flux, similar to the velocity in the rarefied gas dynamics,
does not obey the no-slip boundary condition on the wall, i.e. takes no-zero value on
the wall and as in microfluidics [226] is proportional to the phonon mean free path
and to the flux gradient at the wall
qw = Cl ∂q
∂r

r=R
. (3.32)
This boundary condition is called sometimes “first-order slip condition” [163]
or “Maxwell slip model” [227]. In the case of the general geometry the boundary
condition (3.32) written as [37, 228]
qw = Cl ∂q
∂ξ 
γ
where ξ means the normal direction to the wall cross section (pointing towards the
flow), and γ is the curve accounting for the outer surface of the transversal section
of the system.
Lebon et al. [229] investigated the heat slip flow along solid walls in the frame of
EIT elevating the heat flux at the boundary to the status of the independent variable
and formulated the boundary conditions obtained from the constraint imposed by the
second law of thermodynamics expressing that the rate of the entropy production is
non-negative.
Xu [77] derived the slip boundary condition for the heat flux from the Boltzmann
transport equation for phonon. Sellitto et al. [200, 224] suggested an extended version
of this condition (“second-order slip condition” [163])

The Eq. (3.33) is analogous to the boundary condition for the fluid velocity in the
gas dynamics that was suggested by Cercignani [230].
The coefficients C and α describe the effect of the interactions of phonons with
walls: C describes the specular or diffusive reflections of the phonons while α
accounts for the backscattering collisions [224].
Sellitto et al. [231] formulated the relations of the coefficients C and α to the
characteristics of the wall and to the temperature

When the condition (3.33) is used with α = 2/9 the term “1.5-Order Slip-Flow
Model” is also used [232].
The coefficient C describes the specular and diffusive collisions of the phonons
with the wall while the coefficient α accounts for backscattering [163]. Both coeffi￾cients in the equations (3.32, 3.33) depend on the temperature and are related to the
properties of the wall [200, 231].
Zhu et al. [233] studied the heat transport in a 2-D nanolayer in which the size
along x-axis direction is much larger than the mean free path of the heat carriers
using the Guyer–Krumhansl Eq. (3.21) with the second-order slip condition (3.33)
where the coefficient C is written as suggested by Carlomango et al. [234] similar
to the relation for gases and for electron collisions [143]
C = 2
1 + P
1 − P
where P is the fraction of the heat carriers reflected back with a specular reflection
from a solid surface. Since P ∈ [0, 1], the coefficient C ∈ [2,∞]. Small values of
C mean that the diffusive phonon–wall collisions are predominant over the specular
ones. Conversely, the large values ofC mean that the specular phonon–wall scattering
dominates over the diffusive one. The boundary scattering is the main cause of the
non-uniform heat-flux profile in the hydrodynamic regime [37].
Zhu et al. also used the developed for the rarefied gas dynamics by Bird [235] the
direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) to investigate the heat transfer in the argon
gas nanolayer.
The slip-flow contribution to the heat flux is essential in the so-called Knudsen
layer with the thickness of the order of the phonon mean free path. However, in the
nanosystems with dimension comparable or smaller than the phonon mean free path
the influence of the slip boundary condition extends to the whole system.3.2 Guyer–Krumhansl (GK) Equation 119
Alvarez et al. [163] stated that the slip boundary condition should be modified in
the case of the high-frequency perturbations: the relaxation of the heat flux should
be introduced similar to the Cattaneo law

Alvarez et al. suggested a crude estimate of the relaxation time through the total

3.3 Two-Fluid Models
Such models are based on the division of the phonons into two populations. Usually
it is assumed that the high-frequency part is in the quasi-thermal equilibrium with
the well-defined local temperature [238] while the low-frequency modes are out of
the equilibrium and do not interact with each other because of the small phase space
for such scattering [143, 239–241] but can exchange energy with the high-frequency
modes. The weakness of the two-fluid (two-channel) models is the arbitrariness of
the choice of the cut-off between two channels [242].
3.3.1 Ballistic–Diffusive Model
Ballistic–diffusive (BD) model was introduced by Chen [243, 244]. This model can
be considered as an approximation to the grey unsteady BTE [32] and is close to the
differential approximation used in the analysis of the radiative heat transfer [245] that
involves replacing the integral equation for the heat transfer by the differential equa￾tion for the heat flux and its modification (MDA) suggested by Olfe [246]. BD model
could be considered as the mixed macroscopic–mesoscopic method [164, 247].
BD model is based on the splitting of the distribution function (as well as the
internal energy and the heat flux) into the two parts
f = fb + fd , e = eb + ed , q = qb + qd
reflecting the coexistence of two kinds of the heat carriers3.3 Two-Fluid Models 121
• Ballistic phonons that experience mainly the collisions with the boundaries,
• Diffusive phonons that undergo multiple collisions within the core of the system.
The evolution of these two parts of the internal energy is governed by the classical
balance equations
∂eb
∂t
= −∇ · qb + rb, (3.35)
∂ed
∂t
= −∇ · qd + rd . (3.36)
The source termsrb and rd describe the energy exchange between the ballistic and
the diffusive phonon populations and in the absence of the external sourcesrb = −rd .
The evolution equations for the heat flux are
τb
∂qb
∂t
+ qb = −λb∇T + 2
b(∇2qb + 2∇∇ · qb, ) (3.37)
τd
∂qd
∂t
+ qd = −λd∇T. (3.38)
The coupled equations (3.37, 3.38) lead to the Guyer–Krumhansl equation under
the assumption that τd = τ,b = , λ = λb + λd .
The relative contributions of these two components of the phonon distribution
depend on the value of the Knudsen number K n and on the geometry of the considered
system [248]. As noted Li and Cao in the just cited paper, the ballistic transport is
responsible for the nonlinearity of the temperature distribution and this nonlinearity
increases with increasing the Knudsen number.
The advantage of the ballistic–diffusive model over the Boltzmann transport equa￾tion is the simplicity of the description—only the time and spatial coordinates are
involved.
Similar model called the “two-channel model” [81] is based on the assumption
that there are two individual heat conduction channels and division of the phonon
population into two parts: the long MFP and the short MFP phonons.
Chen [243] used the Boltzmann equation under the relaxation time approxima￾tion assuming that the relaxation time depends on the phonon frequency ω (phonon
energy) and does not depend on the on the wave vector that is linearly related to the
phonon quasi-momentum p = k , i.e. the isotropic scattering is considered

where f0 is the equilibrium phonon distribution function, v is the phonon group veloc￾ity v = ∇kω. The single-mode relaxation time approximation leads to the following
expression for the phonon thermal conductivity [179]122 3 Phonon Models

The equation for the diffusive part of the phonon distribution function is

Chen [243] solved the BTE using the spherical harmonic expansion and keeping
the first two terms
fb = g0 + g1 · ,
where g0 is the scalar average of fb over all directions, g1 is a vector related to the
heat flux.
Using this solution, multiplication of the Eq. (3.40) by  and integration over the
solid angle gives

the phonon density of states per unit volume, Sω is the phonon source term that could

Vazquez et al. [251] and Lebon et al. [207] have considered the two-temperature
variant of the ballistic–diffusive model. Vazquez et al. used the Guyer–Krumhansl
equation (see Sect. 3.2) to describe both the ballistic and diffusive heat fluxes. Lebon
et al. assumed that the distributive function of the diffusive phonons is governed

equation.
Direct nanoscale imaging of ballistic and diffusive thermal transport in graphene
structures was reported by Pumarol et al. [252].
Siemens et al. [253] used the ultrafast coherent soft X-ray beams (the wavelength
29 nm) to study heat transfer from the nanoscale hotspot (the highly doped silicon
resistor near a thin silicon membrane was investigated). The authors found a signifi￾cant (as much as three times) decrease of the energy dissipation away from the heat
source compared to the predictions by the Fourier law.124 3 Phonon Models

3.3.3 Unified Non-diffusive-Diffusive Model
Ramu and Ma [254] suggested a two-fluid (two-channel) model similar to the BD
model and called it the unified non-diffusive-diffusive (UND) model. The authors
based this model on the Boltzmann transport equation, considered one-dimensional
case and used different accuracy of the spherical harmonic expansions of the phonon
distribution function for the low-frequency (LF) phonons with the mean free path
(MFP) of the same order of magnitude as the length scale of interest and high￾frequency (HF) phonons.
The phonon spectrum is divided into two parts
1. High-heat-capacity high-frequency phonons that are in quasi-equilibrium with
local temperature.
2. Low-heat low-frequency phonons that are farther out of equilibrium.
The LF modes do not interact with each other due to the small phase space for
for such scattering [239] but can exchange energy with the HF modes [254].
The distribution function for LF phonons g(x, k) is expanded in the spheri￾cal harmonic functions [255] that form a complete orthogonal set for expanding
azimuthally-symmetric functions
g(x, k) = ∞
i=0
gi(x, k)Pi(cos θ ), (3.44)
where k is the phonon wave vector making an angle θ with the x-axis.
The authors assumed that all LF modes have the same lifetime τ , the same group
velocity magnitude v and that the phonon dispersion is isotropic (thus v = vk/k).
The linearized steady-state Boltzmann equation for the LF part of spectrum is
written as
v cos θ
∂g
∂t = −g − f0
τ . (3.45)126 3 Phonon Models
Substitution of the expansion (3.44) into the BTE (3.45), multiplying by
Pi(cos θ )sin θ (i = 0, 1, 2, ...) and integration over θ produces a hierarchy of cou￾pled equations for gi . The first three of these equations are written as

Ramu and Ma truncate the expansion at second order by requiring g3 = 0 that is
the next approximation after the Fourier law which consists in setting g2 = 0.
After elimination of g2 and g0 Ramu and Ma get the equation in terms of g1

h0 + h1 cos θ.
2. The Bose statistics is used for the symmetric part of the distribution, i.e. h0(x, k) =
f0.
Thus the HF heat flux is written as
q H F = −λL F ∂T

3.3.4 Enhanced Fourier Law
Ramu and Bowers [242, 256] derived an enhanced Fourier law from the BTE assum￾ing the grey population of the quasi-ballistic phonon modes.
Similar to the unified non-diffusive-diffusive model the authors propose to get
the heat flux of the quasi-ballistic mode directly from BTE using the expansion
of the phonon distribution function in the spherical harmonic functions (3.44) and
truncating it at the second order in the angular momentum. The original version [254]
exploited the two-channel model, later [242] it has been extended to incorporate the
quasi-full spectral solution of the BTE.
The authors derived the hierarchy of the coupled equations for harmonics gi
similar to (3.46).
The general ith equation of the hierarchy is written as
i + 1
2i + 3
v
∂gi+1
∂x +
i
2i + 1
v
∂gi−1
∂x + gi
τ = 0.
Increasing the number of harmonics certainly improves the accuracy but intro￾duces the difficulty with the specification of the boundary conditions [242].
Ramu and Bowers [257] use the BTE in the isotropic (thus the group velocity is
v(k) written as v(k)kˆ, where kˆ is the unit vector in the direction of k) relaxation time
approximation
v(k) · ∇ f = f0 − f
τ (k)
where f0(r, k) is the equilibrium Bose function.128 3 Phonon Models
Introducing the model mean free path (k) = vτ produces
f = f0 − kˆ · ∇ f.
The authors “reiterate” the BTE to get
f = f0 − kˆ · ∇ f + 2
(kˆ · ∇)(kˆ · ∇) f. (3.50)
Since cos θ is the first spherical harmonic, its orthogonality to all other harmonics
allows to get the heat flux in the one dimension as [242] the sum over modes and the
integral over angles.
The authors multiply (3.50) by kˆvω(k) where ω(k) is the modal frequency,
integrate over the polar angles of kˆ and use the identities [258]

to get the expression for the modal heat flux.
This expression accounts for the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics and
includes 81 angular integrals most of which evaluate to zero and is finally written as

flow to reduce the effective thermal conductivity.

3.3.5 Two-fluid Model
The two-fluid model [260–262] similar to the BD model divides the phonon popu￾lation into two groups:
• The reservoir group: longitudinal optical (LO), transverse optical (TO), transverse
acoustic (TA) phonons;
• The propagating group: longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons that have a single
group velocity.
All phonons are assumed to have a single overall scattering time [136].
The Monte Carlo computations show that the high-energy electrons scatter prefer￾entially with the LO phonons [263] thus the Boltzmann equation for the LO phonons
includes the term Se−L O (that is absent in equations for other phonon modes) and
could be written in the steady state as

per unit volume and angular frequency, φ¯ is an average over all directions at a
given point, indexes “imp” and “an” refer to the elastic impurity scattering and the
anharmonic phonon scattering, respectively.
Multiplication of equations by ω, integration over all frequencies for each branch
and summing branches give energy balances for the reservoir and propagating groups

3.4 Generalized Fourier Law by Hua et al.
Hua et al. [264, 265] developed a generalized Fourier model valid from ballistic to
diffusive regimes. The authors start with the mode-dependent phonon Boltzmann
equation under the relaxation time approximation (Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK)
model [76, 77])

3.5 Phonon Hydrodynamics
Guo and Wang [164, 266] derived the macroscopic equations for the phonon gas
motion from the phonon Boltzmann equation
∂ f
∂t
+ vg = C( f )
where f = f (x, t, k) is the phonon distribution function, vg = ∇kω is the phonon
group velocity.
The scattering term C( f ) includes the contribution of the two major processes
1. The normal scattering (N-process) and
2. The resistive scattering (R-process).
The energy is conserved in both kinds of collision of phonons with the wave vectors
k1 and k2
ω(k1) + ω(k2) = ω(k3)
while the quasi-momentum of phonons
k1 + k2 = k3 + b (3.57)
is conserved only in the N-processes for which b is the reciprocal lattice vector or
b = 0 [143, 267].
The simplification of the Boltzmann transport equation is based on the Callaway’s
dual relaxation model that assumes that the N process and R process proceed sep￾arately. At the low temperatures the dominant process is N process while at the
ordinary temperatures N process is negligible and the phonon Boltzmann equation
becomes

The phonon relaxation time and phonon group velocity depend often on the
phonon frequency that complicates the solution of the BTE and forces one to use
numerical methods such as the discrete ordinate method (DOM) [50] or the Monte
Carlo (MC) method.
Guo and Wang made a few assumptions:
• The phonon distribution is isotropic, i.e. the phonon properties in one crystalline
direction are representative of those in the whole wave vector space;
• Grey assumption—three acoustic phonon branches have an effective constant
relaxation time, contribution from the optical phonon branches is neglected;
• The phonon dispersion relation is linear ω = vgk (Debye model).
The phonon hydrodynamic model is based on the macroscopic field variables that
are defined as the statistical averages of the phonon distribution function:
the phonon energy density
e =

ωf dk,
the heat flux
q =

vgωf dk,
the flux of the heat flux
Qˆ =

Multiplication of the Boltzmann Eq. (3.58) by the phonon energy quanta ω and
integration over the wave vector space gives the balance equation for the energy
density
∂e
∂t
+∇· q = 0. (3.60)
The right-hand side of this equation vanishes because of the energy conservation
during phonon scattering.
Using the similar procedure with the factor vgω one obtains the balance equation
for the heat flux
∂q
∂t
+∇· Qˆ = − q
τR
. (3.61)
These balance equations are the four-moment field equations of the phonon Boltz￾mann equation.5 To close the system of the phonon transport equations the flux of the
heat flux Qˆ has to be specified in terms of the four basic field variables (the energy
density e and the three components of the heat flux q).
There are several approaches to deal with the closure problem in the kinetic theory:
• The Hilbert method [268],
5 There is a misprint in [266]—Qˆ is printed as a vector in the equation for the heat flux.134 3 Phonon Models
• The Chapman–Enskog expansion [164, 269, 270],
• The Grad’s moment method [271, 272]
• The “regularized moment method” (the R13 moment method)6
• Maximum entropy moment method7 [278–280],
• The invariant manifold method [281].
The authors close for phonon transport problem developing a perturbation equa￾tion to the Boltzmann equation around the four-moment non-equilibrium phonon
distribution function obtained by the maximum entropy principle8 [217] (the idea
of this principle is to resolve the distribution function through a maximization of
entropy density under the constraints of field variables)—thus the derived phonon
hydrodynamic equation should be able to describe the strong thermodynamic non￾equilibrium effects in nanoscale heat transport.
Thus the problem reduces to maximization of the following functional

6 The R13 moment method consists in using the Chapman–Enskog expansion around the Grad’s
thirteen-moment non-equilibrium distribution instead of the usual local Maxwell-Boltzmann equi￾librium distribution. The R13 moment method differs from the classical Grad’s 13-moment system
in the closure relations—the new closure process allows to add some terms of super-Burnett order to
the classical 13-moment equations. Three new quantities, a third-order tensor mijk , a second-order
tensor Ri j , and a scalar , are introduced in order to represent the deviations of the effective values
of the higher-order moments ρijk , ρnnijk , and ρnnpp in 13-moment system, from the corresponding
values determined through the usual Grad’s closure [208].
As a result, the R13 equations can be used to model the high-Knudsen-number gas flow. [273–
275].
7 The maximum entropy method of the determination of the phonon distribution function is based
on the maximization of the phonon entropy density under the constraints of the state variables with
the Lagrange multiplier method (Liu procedure) [276]: the constraints may be removed by the use
of the Lagrange multipliers [277]. Thus a closed set of balance equations for all the phonon state
variables (energy, quasi-momentum, ... ) and the Lagrange multipliers [164].
8 It is formulated by Jaynes in connection with the information theory [282, 283] as: The thermo￾dynamic systems evolve naturally toward states corresponding to a distribution function f (x, ξ , t)
which maximizes the entropy h = −kB
"
R3 f log f dξ where kB is the Boltzmann constant, f dxdξ
is the number of particles in the volume dxdξ of the phase space centred at (x, ξ ) and included
in R3 × R3. The closely related notion is the maximization of the entropy production during non￾equilibrium processes (the so-called maximum entropy production principle, ME PP) [284].3.5 Phonon Hydrodynamics 135

where  = vgτR is the mean free path. Since Eq. (3.66) uses the same field variables
as the traditional Fourier’s description, this model avoids the complexity of classical
moment methods that involve the governing equation of higher-order moments. In the
diffusive limit where both relaxation and non-local effects are negligible, Eq. (3.66)
reduces to the Fourier’s law.
The Eq. (3.66) differs only by the numerical coefficient at the non-local term from
the Guyer–Krumhansl Eq. (3.21) that was developed for the study of the heat trans￾port in bulk dielectric crystals in low-temperature situations. The authors stressed
that the mathematical structure of these equations is the same, but the underly￾ing physical mechanisms of heat transport are different. The non-local terms in the
Guyer–Krumhansl equation are originated from the non-resistive phonon normal
scattering and this equation is suitable for the investigation of the heat transfer at low
temperatures. The non-local terms in the phonon hydrodynamic by Guo and Wang
represent the spatial non-equilibrium effects from the phonon–boundary scattering
or from the large spatial thermal variation.
The non-equilibrium phonon distribution function corresponding to the hydrody￾namics Eq. (3.66) is written as [266]3.5 Phonon Hydrodynamics 137

• The one-dimensional transient phonon transport across a thin film.
• The high-frequency periodic heating of a semi-infinite surface.

3.5.1 Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Phonon
Hydrodynamic Model
As a phonon is a kind of boson, the kinetic (or statistical mechanical) definition of
the entropy density is [204, 287, 288]
s = −kB

Using the phonon Boltzmann equation, the entropy balance equation for phonon
transport is written as

+∇· Js = σs
where entropy flux is


vg[ f ln f − ( f + 1)ln( f + 1)]dk
9 This problem was studied in numerous work both experimentally and theoretically—see, for
example, Hua and Gao [285] and references therein. Monte Carlo method is frequently used to
solve the Boltzmann transport equation, intrinsic scattering processes such as phonon–phonon and
phonon–impurity scatterings being accounted for in the relaxation time approximation. The lateral
boundaries usually are assumed to be completely diffusive while other boundaries are treated as
phonon blackbody, i.e. as absorbing phonons. One of conclusions drawn is that phonon–boundary
scattering significantly suppresses the in-plane thermal transport [285, 286].138 3 Phonon Models
and the entropy generation is
σs = −kB

C( f )[ln f − ln( f + 1)]dk.
The authors considered the heat transport at ordinary temperatures, where the
phonon resistive scattering is dominant over the normal scattering, i.e. the normal
scattering and hydrodynamic phonon transport usually relevant at very low tempera￾ture [95, 137] are not taken into account. In the diffusive regime of heat conduction,
the phonon distribution function is obtained through a Chapman–Enskog expansion
within first order

Using the Eq. (3.68) in the kinetic definition of the heat flux produces the Fourier
law q = −λ∇T with the bulk thermal conductivity λ = 1/3cV vgwhere the phonon
mean free path is defined as  = vgτR.
The authors used the approximations through Taylor’s expansion

The second-order term in φ2 is negligibly small in the near equilibrium regime where
Fourier law is valid and the entropy density reduces to exactly the equilibrium value
and thus is consistent with the local equilibrium hypothesis in the classical inverse
thermodynamics.
In the case of the phonon hydrodynamics Guo et al. derived the following expres￾sion for the entropy density

The non-negativeness of entropy generation is explicitly ensured σs ≥ 0 due to
the quadratic form of its expression.
Thus, the phonon hydrodynamic equation for nanoscale heat transport at ordinary
temperature is consistent with the second law in the frame of the extended irreversible
thermodynamics.
3.5.2 Flux-Limited Behaviour
Usually three kinds of the non-Fourier behaviour are considered: relaxation, non￾local, and nonlinear effects [125, 289].
At high-temperature gradients the nonlinear effects of the heat transport become
important due to the limited velocity of the heat carriers and a saturation of the heat
flux occurs: it cannot reach the arbitrary high values but is limited by the quantity of
the order of the energy times the maximum speed of the signal propagation.
This case may be met in nanostructures where a finite temperature difference is
established over an extremely small-scale length. This kind of nonlinear behaviour
may have important effect, for example, on the effective cooling of the microelec￾tronic devices.
Similar situations arise in the radiative heat transfer [290, 291] where the maxi￾mum heat flux is ∝ T 4c (c is the speed of light), mass diffusion [292–294] and in the
plasma physics in the study of the collapse of stars and in the laser–plasma interaction
in the laser-induced nuclear system where the maximum heat flux is ∝ T 3/2 [295].
Guo et al. [289] studied the flux-limited behaviour in the phonon hydrodynamics
and some other non-Fourier models:
• The phonon hydrodynamic model derived from the phonon kinetic theory that
the authors considered as a credible standard, since it is the direct result from
the phonon Boltzmann equation. The zeroth-order solution to the BTE under the
Callaway relaxation approximation by maximum entropy principle is [287, 296]

Guo et al. thus analysed three group of non-Fourier models: phonon hydrody￾namic model from phonon kinetic theory (3.69), non-equilibrium thermodynamic3.5 Phonon Hydrodynamics 141
models derived in the framework of the the irreversible thermodynamic theory.
(3.70,3.71,3.72), the phenomenological models (3.73,3.74), and the generalized non￾linear heat transport equation that combines several models (3.75).
To assess the models, the authors considered the one-dimensional steady-state
heat conduction under a temperature gradient dT/dx. For example, the phonon
hydrodynamic model (3.69) reduces to
qx = − 
5 − 4
√1 − M2

λ
dT

where M = √3qx/2vgcV T . From the Eq. (3.76) evidently follows that M ≤ 1, i.e.
qx ≡ C ≤ qmax = 2
√3
vgcV T.
The second law of thermodynamics requires a non-negative effective thermal
conductivity, which gives a smaller upper bound and thus the upper limit for the heat
flux is
C ≤ qmax = 2
√3
5
vgcV T.
Guo et al. [289] listed the approximations for the heat flux qx derived from all
other models. In the limit of small heat flux (small temperature gradient) all models
reduce to the Fourier law qx = −λ|DT/dx.
In contrast, in the limit of large heat flux the nonlinear terms are important and can
no longer be neglected. Furthermore, there exists the upper bound for the heat flux in
all the nonlinear heat conduction models except the nonlinear phonon hydrodynamic
model (3.72).
As Li and Cao [301] stated, Fourier heat conduction with the nonlinear thermal
conductivity λ = λ(T ) can also predict flux-limited behaviour. In the “fast diffusion”
model [302] with λ = λ0/T α the heat flux always exists for arbitrary boundary
temperatures and size in 1D steady-state problems and equals

λ0
l ln T2
T1 α = 1.
If α > 1, the limiting saturation heat flux is
λ0T α−1

(α − 1)l
,
which will decrease with T1 increasing. In contrast, the saturation heat fluxes of the
above non-Fourier models are increasing with T1 increasing (usually it is proportional
to T ).142 3 Phonon Models
Li and Cao [301] noted that some of the models considered above cannot be
applied to the heat conduction problem with arbitrarily small size because the defini￾tions of the local temperature and heat flux will be questionable or even undefinable
for extremely small size. Therefore, besides the value of the heat flux varying along
with the increasing temperature gradient, the applicable size of a heat conduction
model should also be limited.
The authors considered 1D steady-state heat conduction with the boundary condi￾tions T (0) = T1 and T (l) = T2 , where flux-limited behaviours are usually discussed,
and found that there exists a critical size determined by the boundary temperatures,
and the heat flux will exist only when the size is larger than the critical one. The
critical sizes of these models can be regarded as the limits of their applicable ranges.
For the phonon hydrodynamic model (3.69) the authors found that in order to
guarantee the existence of heat flux, the size should satisfy the following inequality

If the ratio of the boundary temperatures is sufficiently small, the phonon hydro￾dynamic model could be applied to arbitrarily small-scale heat conduction problems.
For 41/9 < T2/T1, the value of l
c is positive and only when the size is larger than
l
c, the heat flux will exist.
For the tempered diffusion model (3.73) Li and Cao obtained the following expres￾sion for the critical size

c = λ

that is always positive. Thus, for any problem with fixed boundary temperatures,
there always exists a critical size l
c for the existence of heat flux.
The hierarchy moment model (3.71) and the nonlinear phonon hydrodynamic
model (3.72) have no restrictions on the linear scale of the problem.
The size and boundary effects for the existence of heat flux show different from
Fourier heat conduction behaviour—even in the limit of small heat flux these non￾Fourier models with flux-limited behaviours will not reduce to Fourier law and thus
nonlinear effects could not be negligible.
3.6 Relaxon Model
Recently (2020) Simoncelli et al. [101] used the evolution of relaxons to derive two
coupled equations for the temperature and for the drift velocity that describe the heat
transfer in dielectric crystals.3.6 Relaxon Model 143
The concept of relaxons was introduced several years ago by Cepellotti and
Marzari [303] as the collective excitation of the out-of-equilibrium lattice vibrations
consisting of a linear combination of the out-of-equilibrium phonon populations.
Each relaxon is characterized by a well-defined relaxation time; each relaxon also
has a well-defined drift velocity and the mean free path. The thermal conductivity
can be interpreted as the relaxon gas motion.
Simoncelli et al. restricted their analysis to the “simple” crystals, i.e. such crystals
where the phonon interbranch spacings are much larger than their linewidths.
The authors start with the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE)

(r, t) (3.77)
where the sum is over all possible phonon states μ (μ = (q,s) where q varies over
the Brillouin zone and s over phonon branches), vμ is the phonon group velocity, V is
the normalization volume (V = νNc, i.e. the unit cell volume ν times the number of
unit cells that constitute the crystal Nc), μμ
 is the linear phonon scattering operator
(the phonon scattering matrix) [303].
The phonon Boltzmann transport Eq. (3.77) governs the evolution of the deviation
of the phonon population nμ from the equilibrium, i.e. the Bose–Einstein distribution

where ωμ is the phonon frequency,

and the total crystal momentum

could be derived [304].
The energy flux generated in response to the temperature gradient determines
the thermal conductivity; correspondingly, the crystal-momentum flux generated in
response to the perturbation of the drift velocity determines the thermal viscosity.144 3 Phonon Models
The authors considered a crystal in the hydrodynamic regime of thermal transport;
the local equilibrium phonon distribution, obtained maximizing the local entropy
under the constraints of fixed local energy and momentum [305] is the phonon drifting
distribution [306]
N D
μ = 1
exp(ωμ − q · u)
kB T

− 1
, (3.78)
where u is the drift velocity.
This distribution differs from the Bose–Einstein distribution due to the presence
of the drift velocity u(r, t), a parameter expressing the amount of local momentum.
The temperature T (r, t) and the velocity u(r, t) can be related to the Lagrange
multipliers that enforce the constraints of fixed local energy and momentum, respec￾tively [101].
The drifting distribution (3.78) depends on time and space implicitly through
T (r, t) and u(r, t).
Simoncelli et al. in order to study the small perturbation of the temperature and
drift velocity split the deviation of the distribution function as

the scattering operator introduce the coupling between the phonons and the phonon
thermalization cannot be described by the exponential relaxation.

The authors stressed that the derived viscous heat equations differ from the Stokes
equations for fluids in two major ways:
• There is no analogy with the mass conservation satisfied by Stokes equations, since
the total phonon number is not a constant of motion (e.g. a phonon coalescence
event decreases the number of phonons in the system);
• While collisions between molecules in the fluid conserve momentum, scattering
among phonons does not conserve crystal momentum in the presence of Umklapp
processes.
The most important feature of the viscous heat equations is their capability to
describe hydrodynamic thermal transport in terms of mesoscopic quantities, i.e.
temperature and drift velocity, resulting in a much simpler and computationally
less expensive approach than the solution of the microscopic BTE. The parameters
entering these equations can be determined from first principles .
Second sound is the coherent propagation of a temperature wave is an effect
properly described by the viscous heat equations. From a phenomenological point
of view, second sound appears when the temperature field satisfies the following
damped wave equation (x as the second sound propagation direction):
∂2 T (x, t)
∂t 2 +
1
τss
∂T (x, t)
∂t − τss
∂2 T (x, t)
∂x 2 = 0
where τss and τss are the second-sound relaxation time and propagation velocity, yet
to be determined.
Simonelli et al. derived the second-sound equation from the viscous heat equa￾tions following two different approaches (bottom up and top down). The tempera￾ture profile that solves the second-sound equation has the form of a damped wave:
T (x, t) = T¯ + δT ei(kx− ¯ω(k)t)) where the second-sound frequency ω(¯ k) depends on
the second-sound wave vector k.
Simonelli et al. solved the one-dimensional problem for Eqs. (3.81, 3.82) analyt￾ically neglecting the dissipation of momentum by the Umklapp process (Di j
U = 0)
These equations can be rewritten (suppressing indices) as

For one-dimensional domain (with the length 2l) the no-slip boundary condition
is used
u(x = ±l) = 0
and Dirichlet conditions for the temperature
T (x = ±l) = T¯ ± δT.

The factor 1/b is the length scale at which boundary scattering affects thermal
transport.
The authors calculated the normalizedL2 distance between the temperature profile
predicted by Fourier law and the viscous heat equations for a given sample length
lTOT and reference temperature T¯ in the spatially homogeneous region G as
L2 =

The authors found that the dependence of L2 on T¯ and T¯ is qualitatively unchanged
for different sample shapes.
The model of relaxons has also been used to predict the existence of a driftless
second sound in addition to conventional drifting second sound, although this driftless
second sound would be difficult to observe [29].150 3 Phonon Models

Thermomass Model
The thermomass model is based on the old ideas of Tolman [1] that, since accord￾ing to the special relativity all forms of energy have inertia, the heat carriers own
the mass-energy duality: these carriers exhibit both the energy-like characteristics
(in the conversion processes) and the mass-like characteristics (in the transport pro￾cesses) [2].
The thermomass theory applied to the heat conduction in the rigid solid bodies at
rest formally could be classified as an example of the phonon model, and its equations
are similar to that of the phonon hydrodynamics, but the underlying physical ideas
are quite different.
The mass of heat is determined by the mass-energy equivalence of Einstein [3–5]
E = Mc2 = M0c2

1 − v2
c2
where E is the thermal energy, M0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the heat
carrier, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and M is the relativistic mass.
When v  c, this equation is simplified to
E ≈ (M0 + Mk )c2
here Mk is the additive mass induced by the kinetic energy. The thermomass (TM)
Mh is the relativistic mass of the internal energy U
Mh = U
c2 .
The thermomass is very small (10−16 kg for 1 J heat) [2, 6]. The density of the
thermomass contained in the medium is [7]

ρh = ρCV T
c2
where ρCV T represents the thermal energy density.
The thermon is defined as a unit quasi-particle carrying thermal energy. For fluids,
the thermons are supposed to be attached to the particles of the medium; for solids, the
thermon gas is the phonon gas that flows through the vibrating lattices or molecules
[2].
The macroscopic drift velocity of the thermon gas that is considered as a contin￾uum is given as
vh = q
ρCT .
The total energy of thermon gas in a medium is the sum of the kinetic energy and
the potential (pressure) energy [8]
ET =
 
V
(ρT uT duT + dpT )dV,
where V is the total volume of the medium.
4.1 Equation of State (EOS) of the Thermon Gas
A general form of the EOS of the thermomass gas can be the written as
F(pt, ρT , T,ξ) = 0, where pT is the thermomass pressure, ρT is the density of
the thermon gas, and ξ the parameter related to the effects of the interaction between
thermons; if the interaction between the thermons could be neglected, the EOS has
an explicit form [2].
4.1.1 EOS of Thermon Gas in Ideal Gas
Two assumptions are made for the thermon gas as an ideal gas:
1. The thermons are attached to the gas molecules and satisfy the Maxwell–
Boltzmann distribution function.
2. The Newtonian mechanics is applicable to the thermon gas.
The pressure for a system of n particles with mass m randomly moving in x direction
with the velocity ux is

The last equation shows that the thermon gas pressure is proportional to the square

E as
P =

which is similar to the classic expression in the kinetic theory of gases

 f (x, t, v)mv2
xdvxdvydvz.
4.1.2 EOS of Thermon Gas in Dielectrics
Phonons are thermons for dielectrics. The total energy of the lattice vibrations can
be written as
ED = ED0 + Eh = (M0 + Mh)CV T
where Eh is the energy of TM. Thus the thermon gas pressure is
P = γGρ
c2 (CvT )
2166 4 Thermomass Model
where γG is the Grüneisen parameter (also called “the Grüneisen anharmonicity
constant” [9]) that describes the overall effect of the volume change of a crystal on
vibrational properties, which is expressed as γG = V/CV (dP/dT )V , where V is the
volume of a crystal, CV is the heat capacity at constant volume, and (dP/dT )V is
the pressure change due to the temperature variation at constant volume [10].
The pressure of the phonon gas is proportional to the square of the temperature
as in ideal gas. For silicon at the room temperature the thermon gas pressure is about
5 × 10−3 Pa [5].
4.1.3 EOS of Thermon Gas in Metals
The thermons in metals are attached to electrons. The thermon gas pressure is given
as
P = 1
3
nmhu2
h
where mh = ε
c2 , ε is the internal energy that includes contributions of both electrons
and lattice, uh = √2ε/m is the velocity of the randomly moving particles, and thus
the pressure is
P = 2

The general equation for the thermon pressure is written as

.4.2 Equations of Motion of Thermon Gas 167
Wang et al. [2] noted that the electrical interaction between electrons in metals
may be not be negligible and can influence the EOS below the Debye temperature.
4.2 Equations of Motion of Thermon Gas
The one-dimensional conservation equations of mass and momentum are
∂ρh
∂t
+ ∂ρhuh
∂x = S
c2
where S is the internal heat source and
∂
∂t
(ρhuh) +
∂
∂x
(uh · ρhuh) +
∂ P
∂x + fh = 0
where fh is the resistance.
The continuity equation for the thermon gas is actually the energy conservation
equation.
The thermon flow in the solid can be seen as the flow of the compressible fluid
in the porous medium, and the D’Arcy law (K is the permeability of the porous
medium)
u = −K
dp
dx
can be used to estimate the TM resistance fh = βhuh, the proportionality constant
[11, 12]
βh = 2γρ2C3T 2
c2λ .
The effective resistance force fh is introduced instead of the viscous term
(μh∇2uh) to avoid [2]
1. determination of the viscosity μh for the complex materials;
2. the interaction effects between the thermomass gas and the lattice/solid molecules.
The thermon gas flow in the solids (phonon flow) is driven by the pressure gradient,
thus by the gradient of the square of the temperature [11].
The thermomass is too small to be observed under common conditions, but under
the extreme conditions of the ultrafast heating or the ultrahigh heat flux the inertia
of TM will represent itself and cause detectable influences to the heat conduction
process.
The conservation equation of the thermon momentum can be written as a heat
conduction equation [5]168 4 Thermomass Model

The coefficient b could be expressed through the thermal Mach number Mah [13,
14] as the ratio of the phonon gas velocity uh to the thermal wave speed in the phonon
gas Ch

h .
Equation (4.1) could be rewritten in the form similar to the Cattaneo model by
introduction of the material derivative
D
Dt = ∂
∂t
+ 2(vh∇)
as [4]
τh
Dq
Dt + q = −λ(1 − b)∇T.
Wang et al. [6] noted that relaxation times in the thermomass theory and in the
Cattaneo model have different meaning: while in the thermomass theory the charac￾teristic time means the lagging time from the temperature gradient to the heat flux,
and in the Cattaneo equation it is relaxation time to the equilibrium state.
Wang [5] developed a special two-step version of the thermomass theory for metals
that are subjected to the ultrafast laser heating under the following assumptions
1. The electrons absorb the laser energy and then transfer it the lattice by the electron–
phonon coupling.
2. The scattering at the defects and the grain boundaries is ignored.
3. The electron–phonon collisions are presented by an electron–phonon coupling
factor.
Similar to the porous flow hydrodynamics the Brinkman term μ∇2q (μ is the
effective viscosity that is defined as μ = 2τ/CvT [15]) could be introduced into the
equation of the thermon gas motion (4.1) that exhibits the additional drag by the
walls in the system and is necessary only if the characteristic length of the system
is comparable to the friction boundary layer of the thermomass, i.e. if the Knudsen
number is large enough [7]4.2 Equations of Motion of Thermon Gas 169

+ 2(l · ∇)q − bλ∇T + λ∇T + q − μ∇2q = 0. (4.2)
The equation similar to Eq. (4.2) was suggested by Cimmelli et al. [15, 16] as the
nonlinear extension of the Guyer–Krumhansl equation (3.20). The authors modified
the evolution equation for the semiempirical dynamical temperature (2.10) to

length L and thus ∂2qx
∂x2 ∝ qx/L2 [16].
Formal analogy with the Navier–Stokes equations of the hydrodynamics (more
exactly, their low Reynolds number version-Stokes equations) allowed Cimmelli et
al. [15, 16] to introduce the thermal Reynolds number. As was stated above (Sect. 3.1)
its usefulness is dubious.
Sometimes the Brinkman number Br = lB/L is used [17] that compares the vis￾cous friction with the D’Arcy friction; the characteristic length scale lB = √μh/βρh:
• if Br  1, the boundary effect region is small compared to the channel width and
the velocity profile is nearly uniform across the channel cross section.
• if Br  1, the velocity profile is close to the Poiseuille flow.
The entropy production during heat transport is due to the dissipation rate of the
mechanical energy of the thermon gas similar to the viscous dissipation in hydrody￾namics
dEh

+∇· J Eh = f h · uh,
where Eh is the mechanical energy of the thermon gas and J Eh is the flux of Eh.170 4 Thermomass Model
Thus the entropy production in the thermomass theory can be written as [18]
σs
TM = − 1

Fh · uh = 1

Dong et al. [4, 18] formulated the total derivative of the entropy density as

= −∇ · Js + σTM = q
λT 2 · (q + λ∇T ) − ∇ · q

where Js is the entropy flux.

where the subscript V, q means that the derivative is token at constant volume and

Evidently, the non-equilibrium temperature θ is lower than the local equilibrium
temperature Teq .

Dong et al. [19] exploited an analogy analysis between the non-Fourier heat
conduction and the non-Newtonian momentum transport. Similar to the assumptions
in the thermomass model, the authors derived a governing equation for momentum
transport in the nanosystems, which accounts for the varying effective viscosity
in steady flow. This shear thinning effect will be apparent in the nanochannel flow
where the velocity gradient and the momentum transport flux are huge. The molecular
dynamics simulation was performed in the Lennard–Jones fluid and the hard sphere
gas and showed that the viscosity decreases with the shear rate.
4.3 Heat Flow Choking Phenomenon
Wang et al. [20, 21] for the one-dimensional steady heat transfer without the internal
heat source use the heat conduction equation in the form
κ

1 − Ma2
h
 dT
dt
+ q = 04.4 Dispersion of Thermal Waves 171
where the thermal Mach number is introduced
Mah = uh
Ch
,
u is the drift velocity of the phonon gas, and the thermal sound speed is, e.g. for
dielectrics, Ch = √2γCV T .
Thermon gas is a compressible fluid; thus its flow demonstrates numerous features
similar to those of the flow of the compressible gas such as air. One of such features is
the flow behaviour in the convergent nozzle when the Mach number equals to unity.
In the flow of compressible air driven by the pressure gradient in the converging
nozzle the velocity increases and the pressure decreases in the flow direction. The
flow choking occurs when the current Mach number equals unity and there is the
pressure jump.
The drift velocity of thermon gas driven by the temperature gradient increases
as it flows in the opposite direction of temperature gradient. The heat flow choking
that occurs at the thermal Mach number equalled to unity results in the temperature
jump.
The confirmation of the heat flow choking phenomenon was obtained in the exper￾iments on the heat conduction in an individual single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)
suspended between two metal electrodes by Wang et al. [20]. The CNT was elec￾trically heated by the internal Joule heat, the heat flowed from the middle to the
two ends of the CNT. The heat flux was governed by the electrode temperature until
the thermal Mach number reaches unity at the CNT ends; further decrease of the
electrode temperature had no effect on the heat flux.
However, this phenomenon was not confirmed by Zhang et al. [22] who studied
using the molecular dynamics simulations of the energy transport in the open-ended
single-walled carbon nanotube cantilevered out of the (001) surface of bulk silicon.
The authors did not observed the heat flow choking as the flow increases but found
that energy can be efficiently transported by the low-frequency mechanical wave.
This energy can be calculated as
PW = 1
2
μω2 A2Vg
where μ is the mass of CNT per unit length, ω is the angular frequency, A is the
wave amplitude, and Vg = ∂ω/∂k is the phonon group velocity.
4.4 Dispersion of Thermal Waves
The speed of the thermal wave in the thermomass theory depends on whether the
wave is moving towards the heat flux or in the opposite direction; the temperature
dependence of the wave speed to the shrinking or extending of the heat pulses spatially
[23].172 4 Thermomass Model
Zhang et al. [24] investigated numerically using an implicit finite difference
scheme (with the central differences for space discretization and the backward dif￾ferences for time) the dispersion of the thermal waves.
The authors considered the case of the cosine heat flux pulse boundary condition.
As the wave moves forward, peaks appear in the rear of the thermal wave. The
underlying mechanism for the dispersion is that thermal waves travel faster in the
the regions with higher temperature.
Computations were performed for the CV, DPL and TM models. Zhang et al. [24]
started with the TM model written in the form
q + τTM
∂q
∂t − τTM
q
T
∂T
∂t
+ τTM
q
ρCV T
∇ · q − τTM
q
ρCV T · q
T
∇T = −λ∇T
(4.5)
and in order to analyse the origin of the thermal wave dispersion considered the
special versions of Eq. (4.5)
q + τTM
∂q
∂t = −λ∇T, (4.6)
q + τTM0
∂q
∂t − τTM
q
T
∂T
∂t = −λ∇T, (4.7)
q + τTM0
∂q

∇ · q = −λ∇T, (4.8)
q + τTM0
∂q
∂t − τTM
q
ρCV T · q
T
∇T = −λ∇T. (4.9)
Equation (4.6) is used to study the effects of the inertia term of heat flux to time on
the dispersion of the TM-wave; this term is different from that of the CV model since
the characteristic time τTM decreases with the temperature, while the relaxation time
remains unchanged in the propagation of the CV-wave. The effects of the inertia
term of temperature to time, the inertia term of heat flux to space and the inertia
term of temperature to space could be investigated using Eqs. (4.7), (4.8) and (4.9),
respectively [24].
It should be noted that according to the energy conservation equation
ρCv
∂T
∂t
+∇· q = 0
with the constant thermal properties and no heat sources Eq. (4.7) could be trans￾formed into Eq. (4.8) by replacing ∂T/∂t by −∇ · q/ρCv.
Zhang et al. also showed that the increase of the amplitude of the heat flux pulse
and the decrease of the initial temperature enhance the dispersion of TM-wave; the
increase of the amplitude of the heat flux pulse and of the relaxation time τq enhance
the dispersion of CV-wave and DPL-wave, while the increase of the relaxation time
τT weaken the dispersion of the DPL-wave.References 173

Mesoscopic Moment Equations
In order to correctly describe the high-frequency and the short-wavelength processes
Bergamasco et al. [1] developed in the frame of the kinetic theory a number of
the mesoscopic moment systems (the two-moment and the three-moment systems)
introducing the Knudsen number Kn as the ratio of the mean free path of the heat
carriers to the characteristic size of the system and using the concept of ghostmoment.
The authors considered the following four-flow regimes [2]: continuum flow (K n ≤
0.001), slip-flow regime (0.001 < K n ≤ 0.1), transition regime (0.1 < K n ≤ 10)
and free molecular flow (K n > 10). The ghost moments are those that have a higher
order with respect to those required to recover the hydrodynamic level (hydrodynamic
moments).
This approach provides a quantitative description of heat hydrodynamics at the
mesoscopic level, i.e. in terms of the partial differential equations (PDEs) that are
simpler than the microscopic integro-differential BTE (Simonelly et al. [3] used
the term “mesoscopic model” to denote any description that requires more fields or
PDEs than the Fourier’s law for the temperature field—probably the first example of
such approach is the research by Sussmann and Thellung [4] who, starting from the
linearized BTE in the absence of momentum-dissipating (Umklapp) phonon–phonon
scattering events, derived mesoscopic equations in terms of the temperature and of
the phonon drift velocity, i.e. the thermal counterparts of pressure and fluid velocity
in liquids).
The authors start from the Fourier equation rewritten as
K n2 ∂T
∂t
+ K n
∂
∂x

−K nκ
∂T
∂x

= 0
and add a ghost moment φ = Knq, which has units of thermal flux, to increase the
order of the physical description

where an additional term involving the time derivative of the ghost moment respon￾sible for the enriched mesoscopic description is introduced into Eq. (5.2) and c is
the constant velocity of arbitrary value. Equations (5.1) and (5.2) are called the Two￾Moment Hyperbolic Equation system from which the mesoscopic equation for the

Equation (5.3) has the same form as the Cattaneo equation where the heat flux

Bergamasso et al. also suggested another two-moment system where the velocity
appears in both equations:

The system of Eqs. (5.4)–(5.5), called by the authors the Switched Two-Moment
Hyperbolic system, leads, as the system (5.1)–(5.2), to the same equation for the
temperature (5.3).
The authors introduce another ghost moment e that has units of temperature and
is defined such that e − T = 0 and two additional parameters γ and θ to get Three￾Moment Hyperbolic Equations system:

To analyse the solution, Bergamasso et al. perform the Fourier transform
T ˆ (k, t) =
∞
−∞
T (x, t)e−ikxdx
with the inverse Fourier transform
T (x, t) = 1
2π

to get the Fourier equation in terms of the Fourier image
dTˆ
dt = −κk2Tˆ
that has the general solution
T ˆ (k, t) = T ˆ (k, 0)e−κk2t
.
The authors introduce the complex temperature 


(k, x, t) = T ˆ (k, 0)eikx−κk2t = 
0ei(kx+ωt)
where ω = iκk2.
The authors assumed that the ghost moment  has the same form as the complex
temperature
(k, x, t) = 0ei(kx+ωt)
Substituting of these solutions into the two-moment system (5.1)–(5.2) yields an
eigenvalue problem with the characteristic polynomial
κK n2
c2 ω2 − iω − κk2 = 0
that has roots
ω1,2 = ic2 ± √−c4 + 4κ2K n2k2c2
2κK n2 . (5.10)
The solution can be written as

 = 
01ei(kx+ω1t) + 
02ei(kx+ω2t)178 5 Mesoscopic Moment Equations
and
 = 01ei(kx+ω1t) + 02ei(kx+ω2t)
.
The same procedure applied to the three-moment system (5.6)–(5.8) results in
more complex characteristic polynomial
(γ K n2
ω − i)
κK n2
c2 ω2 − iω − κK n2
θ

.
Solution of the last equation requires a rather cumbersome algebra.
Authors analyse in detail the two-moment systems. Equation (5.10) is rewritten
as
ω1,2 = i
c2 ± c
√c2 − 4κ2K n2k2
2κK n2 .
Two cases are
• κKnk
c < 1
2
The argument of the square root is positive. The authors used the Taylor expansions
for ω1 and ω2 and concluded that 
1 and 
2 depend on the time with the multiple
scales

1 = 
1
 t
K n2 , t, K n2
t,...
and

2 = 
2(t, K n2
t, . . . ).
Thus the authors concluded that solution can have two modes:
1. a fast (advective) mode that goes to zero very quickly when K n is small;
2. a slow (diffusive) mode that does not depend on K n and recovers the diffusive
behaviour of the macroscopic equation.
• κKnk
c > 1
2
The argument of the square root is negative; thus, the square root yields a complex
number, and oscillations in the solution are expected.

Microtemperature and Micromorphic
Temperature Models
Liu et al. [1] suggested to divide the non-Fourier heat conduction models into four
classes depending on the used theoretical framework:
1. Modifications of the classical Fourier models such as the Cattaneo and Vernotte,
the Guyer–Krumhansl (GK), the dual-phase-lag model, the ballistic–diffusive
heat-conduction equations. In fact, to obtain a finite velocity for the propagation
of thermal signals it is not necessary to assume relaxation terms in heat equation.
This result can be also obtained if one assumes a nonlinear equation with the
thermal conductivity depending on the temperature [2–4].
2. Inclusion the temperature gradient as an argument of the Helmholtz-free energy.
There are three ways to comply with the second law of thermodynamics intro￾ducing the gradient of temperature or gradient of entropy:
• By introducing an extra entropy flux: for example, Ireman and Nguyen [5] using
the idea of Maugin’s [6, 7] work on gradients of internal variables introduced
the gradient of temperature that leaded to the additional entropy production;
• By modification using the extra energy production: Forest et al. [8] incorporated
the temperature and temperature gradient into the second grade theory, with
extra energy production (extra power) by extending the method of virtual power.
Later Forest et al. [9] developed the entropy gradient theory and derived an
enhanced heat equation which has the structure of the Cahn–Hilliard equation.
• Modification with additional entropy production. Nguyen [10] proposed an
additional entropy production and a new relationship between internal energy
and free energy to introduce the gradient of temperature in the set of state
variables.
3. Double temperature models such as models by Aifantis [11, 12] and by Sobolev
[13, 14].
4. The microtemperature or microentropy theory. The microtemperature that depends
on the microcoordinates of the microelements is based on the work on kinematics
and dynamics of a continuum with microstructure by Eringen and Suhubi [15,
16] (see also [17]).

181182 6 Microtemperature and Micromorphic Temperature Models
6.1 Microtemperature Models
Based on the theory by Grot [18] of the thermodynamics of elastic bodies with
microstructure whose microelements possess a microtemperature vector, Iesan et al.
[19–22] derived a linear theory of microstretch thermoelastic bodies with microtem￾peratures.
The local forms of balance of energy and the balance of first moment of energy
can be expressed as
ρe˙ = ˆσ : ∇v + ˆσ : ˆv + ˆσm : ∇v +∇· q + ξ ,
and
ρe˙m = ˆσm : (∇v − ˆv) +∇· q + q − Q + ξ ,
where v is the velocity vector, σˆ is the microstress tensor, vˆ denotes the microgyration
tensor, σˆm is the first stress moment third-rank tensor, e˙m represents the first moment
of energy vector, q is the first heat flux moment second-rank tensor, Q is the microheat
flux average, and ξ is the first heat supply moment tensor.
The local form of the second law of thermodynamics is modified to include the
microtemperature
ρs˙ −∇·  q
T − q
T · T

− 1
T (ξ + ξ · T) ≥ 0
where T is the microtemperature vector.
Finally the following field equations of temperature and microtemperature are
obtained for the rigid body heat conduction (without body heat sources) [1]
cT˙ = λT + k1∇ · T
and
bT˙ = k6T + (k4 + k5)∇ (∇ · T) − k2T − k3∇T
where ki , b and c are material constants. Considering the internal constraint that
T = ∇T , the generalized heat equation becomes
cT˙ = (λ + k1 − k2 − k3)T − bT˙ + (k4 + k5)2 T.
If 2T is small, the above heat equation is equivalent to the one derived from the
hyper temperature model [1]
ρcV T˙ + T0 AT T˙ = λT
that has the same form as the heat equation of Cattaneo if τ = T0 AT /λ.6.2 Micromorphic Approach 183
6.2 Micromorphic Approach
Iesan and Nappa [23] also deduced the heat equation in micromorphic continua,
while using the thermomechanical theory established by Green and Naghdi [24]. In
particular, the authors showed that in the linearized theory according to this approach,
heat can be transferred as thermal waves with finite speed. The heat equations of linear
theory for temperature and microtemperature are given by:
aT¨ + m∇T˙ = λT
and
bT¨ = d2T + (d1 + d3)∇ (∇ · T) − m∇T˙
where a, m, k, b and di are material constants.
For a hypothetical medium in which m = 0, these equations are uncoupled in
the sense that the temperature is independent of microtemperatures. In this case the

Forest and Aifantis [12] proposed theories based on scalar microtemperature and
microentropy model by applying the micromorphic approach by Forest [25] to the
temperature and entropy. They showed that the gradient of entropy theory and gra￾dient temperature theories can be regarded as a limit case of the microentropy and
microtemperature theories. In the purely thermal case there exist additional inde￾pendent power of internal and external generalized forces due to the introduced
microentropy variable s˘ and ∇ ˘s. The virtual power of the generalized internal forces
according to Germain [26] is enhanced

The micromorphic temperature T˘ is introduced, based on the micromorphic

where ζi represents the generalized mass of micromorphic temperature. The first
contribution one mimics the mechanical acceleration and introduces the second time
derivative of the micromorphic temperature, it is similar to the inertia of displace￾ment. The second one involves only the first time derivative of the micromorphic
temperature and is based on justifications from kinetic theory of gas, where the
kinetic energy is proportional to temperature [1].
If ζi = 0, the theory reduces to a micromorphic temperature model similar to the
microentropy model derived by Forest and Aifantis [12].

Thermodynamic Models
Thermodynamic models are deduced from the thermodynamic constraints following
from the second law of thermodynamics [1–15].
The maximum entropy method of the determination of the field variable is based
on the maximization of the entropy density under the constraints of the state variables
with the Lagrange multiplier method (Liu procedure) [16]: the constraints may be
removed by the use of the Lagrange multipliers [17]. An alternative approach—
Coleman–Noll procedure [18] and its generalization [19, 20] according to idea by
Cimmelli [21] that one should consider as constraints for the entropy inequality both
the governing equations of the wanted fields and their gradient extensions up to the
order which appears in the state space.
Triani et al. [22, 23] showed using the example of a rigid heat conductor with
general entropy flux that the Coleman–Noll and the Liu procedures are equivalent,
if in the Coleman–Noll procedure all relevant equations are taken into account as
constraints.
The wavelike propagation of heat such a second sound is due to the inertia of
internal energy. The deviations from the Fourier law could be modelled by an addi￾tional non-equilibrium thermodynamic state variables. The internal variables are the
powerful tool for modelling in other continuum theories, for example, rheology [24,
25], dislocations in semiconductor crystals and superlattices [26], porous nanocrys￾tals filled by fluid flow [27, 28]. In the case of the heat transfer the simplest choice
for the additional vectorial state variable is the heat flux as in the extended thermo￾dynamics [29–32]. In such a way one obtains the Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte and
Guyer–Krumhansl equations. With the additional variables, including the tensorial
variables, a more general theory can be derived that correctly describes, e.g. the
ballistic propagation and the propagation of heat with the speed of sound [33]. The
evolution equations for these new variables are direct consequences of the second
law of the thermodynamics and could be obtained by solving the inequality of the
entropy production.

7.1 Jou and Cimmelli Model
Jou and Cimmelli [10] introduced an extra internal variable represented by a second￾order tensor Qˆ and wrote the balance of the heat flux as follows
τ1q˙ + q = −λ∇T +∇· Qˆ , (7.1)
where τ1 is the relaxation time.
The tensor Qˆ is assumed to be symmetric and may be split Qˆ = Q ˆI + Qˆ s, where
the scalar Q is one-third of trace of Qˆ , Qˆ s is the symmetric traceless (deviatoric)
part of Qˆ . In the relaxation time approximation the evolution equations for the tensor
parts are written as
τ0 ˙
Qˆ + Qˆ = γ0∇ · q (7.2)
τ2 ˙
Qˆ s + Qˆ s = 2γ2

(∇q)
0
s (7.3)
where 
(∇q)0

s is the symmetric traceless part of ∇q.
Under the assumption that τ0 and τ2 are small and only regular processes, for
which the time derivatives at the left-hand side of Eqs. (7.2) and (7.3) do not diverge,
are considered, the equation for the heat flux (7.1) could be rewritten as [10]

producing a vector.7.1 Jou and Cimmelli Model 189
The absolute temperature is given by the reciprocal of the derivative of the entropy
with respect to the internal energy at constant values of the other. When the extended
entropy (7.5) is used instead of the local equilibrium entropy, the resulting absolute
temperature is [34]

The local equilibrium temperature loses its validity in situations where the devi￾ation from equilibrium ensemble is significant [35, 36].
The dispersion relation of heat waves along nanowires which are not isolated
from the environment allows to compare different definitions of non-equilibrium
temperature, since thermal waves are predicted to propagate with different phase
speed [10, 37].
The first-order flux as the sole independent variable is not sufficient for the correct
description of the high-frequency processes when the frequency becomes comparable
to the inverse of the relaxation time of the first-order flux, all the higher-order fluxes
will also behave like independent variables.
EIT allows one to introduce the higher-order fluxes Jˆ

k is the
tensor of order k that serves as the flux of the preceding flux Jˆ
k−1. Thus the specific

Consideration of this hierarchy of the equations for the higher-order fluxes in

7.1.1 Heat Conduction in Thermoelectric Systems
The authors considered two-temperature model of the transport in the thermoelectric
systems.
Thermoelectric effects involve an interplay between the electric and thermal prop￾erties of the material. The two primary thermoelectric effects are the Seebeck effect
and the Peltier one: the Seebeck effect describes how a temperature difference cre￾ates a charge flow; the Peltier effect describes how an electrical current creates a heat
flow. Thermoelectric devices are attractive; they do not have moving parts, do not
create pollution and do not make noise [41].
In practical applications, the thermodynamic efficiency of a thermoelectric device
is determined by the dimensionless parameter Z T , where T is the operating temper￾ature, and Z is the figure-of-merit Z = 2σe/λ, where  is the Seebeck coefficient, σe
is the electrical conductivity. Although the thermal conductivity λ of thermoelectric
materials is usually dominated by that of the electrons, sometimes the lattice heat
conductivity should be accounted for.
The primary challenges in developing advanced thermoelectric materials are
increasing the power factor 2σe and reducing the thermal conductivity. Nanomateri￾als provide an interesting avenue to obtain more performing thermoelectric devices,
for example, using the one-dimensional nanostructures [42, 43].7.2 Sellitto and Cimmelli Model 191
Jou and Cimmelli [10] considered the case when the phonons and electrons have
no the same temperature. Accounting for two different temperatures is necessary in
several physical situations
• The presence of hot electrons. When the electron mean free path corresponding to
electron–phonon collisions is long, one may have a population of “hot electrons”,
whose kinetic temperature is higher than that of the phonons [44].
• Non-equilibrium temperatures. As the electron mean free path is usually shorter
than the phonon mean free path, when the l distance is bigger than the electron
mean free path but smaller than the phonon mean free path, there will be a very
high number of electron collisions, and only few phonon collisions. Thus, the
electron temperature may reach its local equilibrium value, whereas the phonon
temperature may be still far from it.
• Fast laser pulses.When a laser pulse hits a system, initially the electrons capture the
main amount of the incoming energy and subsequently, through electron–phonon
collisions, they give a part of the energy to the phonons.
The evolution equations for the internal energy of phonons per unit volume ep,
the internal energy of electrons per unit volume ee and the electrical charge per unit
volume of electrons ρe are
e˙p = −∇ · qp, e˙e = −∇ · qe + EI, ρ˙e = −∇ · I.
The average temperature—a measurable quantity in practical applications—is
defined as T = (c p
v Tp + ce
V Te)/cV where cV = c p
v + ce
V the volumetric heat capacity
at constant volume of the whole system [45].
7.2 Sellitto and Cimmelli Model
Sellitto and Cimmelli [8] developed a continuum approach to the thermomass model.
The authors introduced the absolute temperature θ and the vectorial variable c as the
sate variables and postulate similar to the approach by Lebon et al. [46] that c is
proportional to the heat flux.
The authors assumed that the evolution of c is governed by the balance equation
c˙ =∇· ˆ (c) + σ(c) (7.7)
where the flux and the production of c are given as
ˆ (c) = 1(θ ) ˆI + 2(θ ) 

c2 + cc

In the absence of heat source the energy conservation is (u is the volumetric
internal energy)
u˙ = −∇ · q, (7.9)
the constitutive equation is written as
q = g(θ , c2
)c. (7.10)
Sellitto and Cimmelli listed several reasons to use the variable c instead of the
heat flux q (see also [47]):
• This choice allows to get the constitutive equation in the form similar to that in
phonon hydrodynamics.
• c is proportional to τ , which is a small parameter, it may be very helpful in the
determination of the closure of nonlinear series expansions.
• Compliance with earlier models of the generalized Fourier law [48].
• The form of the function g could be chosen in accordance of the principle of the
frame indifference.
Jou et al. [47] consider c as the renormalized heat flux. Since c is collinear to
q but not equal to q and c is not identified, c may be considered as an internal
variable, instead of the heat flux. The internal variables constitute an efficient tool
when dealing with non-equilibrium processes involving complex thermodynamical
systems. These additional non-equilibrium parameters, whose nature depends on the
phenomenon at hand, usually are introduced through ordinary differential equations,
called kinetic equations.

The Eqs. (7.8) and (7.11) form a closed set of equations. Solving these equations
under the restrictions imposed by the second law of thermodynamics, the authors
obtained the general equation for the heat flux that in one-dimensional case is written
as [8]

7.3 Kovács and Ván Model
Kovács and Ván [7] introduced the heat flux and a second-order tensorial variable
as additional internal field variables and assumed the following form of the entropy
flux
J = bˆ · q + Bˆ : Qˆ , (7.12)
where bˆ is second order and Bˆ is third-order tensorial functions called current mul￾tipliers (Nyiri multipliers [49]).
The authors also assumed a quadratic dependence of the entropy density on the
additional field variables
s = seq (e) − m1
2 q · q − m2
2 Qˆ : Qˆ ,
where m1 and m2 are the constant positive material coefficients.194 7 Thermodynamic Models

The material coefficients (l1, k1, k2, k12, k21) are subjected to the following restric￾tions from the second law of thermodynamics:
l1 ≥ 0, k1 ≥ 0, k2 ≥ 0, k1k2 − k12k21 ≥ 0.
Using the constraints from the second law of thermodynamics (the non-negative
production of the entropy) and eliminating the internal variables, the authors get the
general constitutive equation for the heat flux as

including the possible Onsager reciprocity relations and second law requirements
for the transport coefficients. Their model could be considered as the extension of
the Kovács and Ván model (Sect. 7.3).
The authors consider the balances of the internal energy e
ρ
∂e
∂t
+∇· q = 0
and of the entropy s in the rigid heat conductor
ρ
∂s
∂t
+∇· J = σ(s)
where σ(s) is the entropy production rate.
The authors introduced an additional internal variable Qˆ (a second-order tensor)
which incorporates higher-order effects in the heat transport. Qˆ may be interpreted
as the flux of the heat flux in solids [12, 30] or as the pressure tensor in fluids [30,
50]. Similar to the Kovács and Ván model it is assumed that the entropy flux is zero
if q and Qˆ , the Eq. (7.12) is valid.
Expansion of the entropy function s(e, q, Qˆ) up to second approximation around
the equilibrium state gives
s(e, q, Qˆ) = seq (e) − 1
2ρ mi jqiqj − 1
2ρ
Mijkl Qi jqkl
where there are symmetry relations
mi j = m ji, Mijkl = Mklij . (7.13)
Note that relation (7.13) is valid for the anisotropic systems, too. For isotropic
systems mi j and Mijkl would reduce to a scalar and the three scalar components
conjugate to the three scalar invariants of the tensor Qˆ , respectively [33]. Thermody￾namic stability requires that the inductivity tensors mˆ and Mˆ [51] are positive definite
and the authors assumed that they are constant.196 7 Thermodynamic Models

the thermodynamic fluxes bi j − δi j/T, bji,j − mi j ∂qi /∂t, Bijk , Bkij,k − Mijkl∂ Qkl
and forces qi, qi,j, Qi j, Q jk,i .
Famá et al. obtained the Onsager coefficients taking into account that the body
properties are invariant with respect to all rotations and inversion of the frame of
axes and the rate equations for q and Qˆ accounting for the Onsager reciprocity
relations. The authors investigated the one-dimensional case and showed that the list
of the special case includes ballistic–conductive, Guyer–Krumhansl, Cahn–Hilliard,
Jeffrey type, Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte and Fourier equations.
The authors stressed that the entropy density depends on the internal variables
quadratically, in order to preserve the concavity, that is thermodynamic stability. The
entropy flux depends on the internal variables linearly; therefore, it disappears when
they are zero. As long as these two physical conditions and the entropy inequality
are valid, the derived consequences are also valid.
7.5 Rogolino et al. Models
Rogolino et al. [13] based their analysis on the work by Ván & Fülöp [5] that used
two assumptions:
1. The deviation from the equilibrium state is described by the heat flux and the
second-order tensorial internal variable;
2. The deviation from the classical form of the entropy current is described by two
tensorial functions, called the current multipliers.
Rogolino et al. developed two versions of the generalized heat conduction equa￾tions. The first one ignores the non-local effects, and the second equation is able to
describe the heat conduction in the presence of the non-local effects.
The authors used in the first case as the basic field variables the specific (per
unitary volume) internal energy e, the heat flux q and the flux of heat flux q. In
the second case they considered the differential consequences in the first case by the
spatial and time derivatives of the equations and obtained the higher-order equation7.5 Rogolino et al. Models 197
for the heat flux. Rogolino et al. proved that the entropy flux is non-local in both
cases while the entropy is local in the first case and non-local in the second case.
The authors assumed the following form of the corresponding balance laws (in
the one-dimensional case)

where rq and r are the production rates of the heat flux q and flux of heat flux q ,
 is the flux of q .
For the closure of the system of Eqs. (7.14–7.16) it is necessary to use the consti￾tutive equations for the flux  and the source terms rq and r.
The system of Eqs. (7.14–7.16) is the one-dimensional version of the 13-moments
system of extended irreversible thermodynamics [30, 31] that is related to the Grad’s
13-moments method.

The authors using the entropy constraints and the Lagrange–Farkas multipliers1
λ, α and β calculate the entropy inequality and found that the Lagrange–Farkas
multipliers are determined by the partial derivatives of the entropy with respect to
the basic field variables

1 The Lagrange multipliers are used to incorporate the constrains related to the entropy [16, 52].
Some of these multipliers have the classical counterparts such as, for example, the temperature, the
chemical potential, while others related to the non-equilibrium constraints do not have analogous
in the equilibrium theory.198 7 Thermodynamic Models
The solution of the inequality (7.17) requires the additional assumptions. Rogolino
et al. choose as the entropy a quadratic function of the non-equilibrium variables q
and q
s = ¯s(e) − m q2
2 − M

where m and M are the constant positive coefficients and assumed the following
compatibility condition to be valid

.
The chosen function (7.18) ensures the fulfilment of the principle of maximum
entropy at the equilibrium.
The authors also required that expression for the entropy flux reduces to the clas￾sical value J = ∂s/∂e at equilibrium and finally get the simplified form of entropy
inequality (7.17) as

Rogolino et al. derived two versions of the generalized heat equation

non-local effects.
2. The fourth order in space and second order in time equation incorporating the
non-local effects.
7.6 Two-Temperature Model by Sellitto et al.
Sellitto et al. [14] suggested the model that accounts for the non-local and nonlinear
effects in the different regimes which electrons and phonons (that are considered
as the gas-like collections, flowing through the crystal lattice [53–55]) can undergo
in the heat conduction (when the equations for the electrons and the phonons are
identical, the subscript “c” is used to denote the heat carrier, “e” or “p”)

As the authors noted these equations do not follow from a rigorous microscopic

the EIT framework, the authors chosen the following state space:

The authors showed by direct calculations that the proposed model has well-posed
theoretical basis.
Sellitto et al. determined the speed of the heat waves for the cases when the wave
propagates in the same direction of the average heat and in the opposite direction.7.7 EIT Ballistic–Diffusive Model 201
The authors investigated the influence of both the non-local effects (represented in
the model by terms l
2
e and l
2
p) and the nonlinear effects (represented in the model by
terms 2qjqe
i,j

V T e and 2qjq p
i,j
/c p
V T p) on the the wave propagation. They found that
the non-local effects enhance the speeds of propagation; the effect of the nonlinear
terms depends on the direction of the wave propagation.
The authors noted that applications of the model limited to the problems where
the electron–phonon interactions could be neglected—in the proposed the two￾temperature model the two different species of heat carriers have been completely
decoupled. However, the electron–phonon interactions in graphene, e.g. are impor￾tant for the describing the anomalies of photoemission spectra observed [56, 57].
7.7 EIT Ballistic–Diffusive Model
The EIT ballistic–diffusive model [58] follows the purely macroscopic approach in
contrast to the BD model introduced by Chen [59, 60] that is based on the mixture
of the kinetic and macroscopic approaches.
Similar to the Chen’s model EITBD by Lebon et al. relays on the coexistence of
two kinds of heat carriers
• The ballistic phonon that originate at the boundaries and collide mainly with the
walls;
• The diffusive phonons that undergo the multiple collisions within the core of the
system.
The internal energy and the heat flux are splitted into two parts
e = eb + ed , q = qb + qd .
The state variables of EIT are selected as
1. (eb, qb) provide the description of the ballistic motion of phonons.
2. (ed , qd ) provide the description of the diffusive motion of phonons.
The authors introduce the ballistic and the diffusive quasi-temperatures Tb =
eb/cb and Td = ed /cd that do not represent the temperatures in the usual sense but
serve as the measure of the internal energies [9]. Assuming that the heat capacities
are equal, the total quasi temperature is introduced T = e/c = Tb + Td .
Evolution of the internal energies is governed by the balance equations

Fractional Derivative Models

equation in the fractal media1

where 0 < α ≤ 1, 0 < β ≤ 1.

to study the heat transfer in a fractal medium arising in the silk cocoon hierarchy;
the structure of the cocoon could be duplicated in the biometric fabric design.
Similar approach was used by Beybalaev [5] to study the heat conduction in the
fractal medium and Beybalaev et al. [6] to study of the ground freezing.
He et al. [7, 8] used the stationary space-fractional equation
1 The fractal media cannot be described as the fractals since the main property of the fractal is the
non-integer Hausdorff dimension that should be observed on all scales—the fractal structure of the
real media cannot be observed on all scales [2].

Earlier these authors considered Eq. (8.1) with the Riemann–Liouville fractional
time derivative ∂αT /∂tα and used the Fourier transform [11] in the spatial coordinate
and the Laplace transform in time to get the solution [12].
Voller et al. [13] used the time-fractional and Meilanov et al. [14] the time–space
fractional models to solve the Stefan problems.
Voller et al. considered the cases of both the sharp and diffuse interfaces between
the liquid and the solid phases. The authors neglected the surface tension and the
kinetic effects and assumed that the heat flux, temperature and the latent heat are
zero. Thus the heat balance is

where L is the latent heat of fusion, l is the part of the liquid domain surface that
coincides with the total domain surface, n is the outwards pointing normal.

where () is the gamma function, α is the measure of the memory retention (α = 0

The above equations are derived for the case of the sharp phase boundary. In case
of the diffuse interface Voller et al. use the enthalpy H = ρcT + ρL f where the
liquid fraction f changes smoothly from f = 1 to f = 0 across the temperature
interval and get

To compare the sharp and the diffusive formulations the authors considered the
one-dimensional problem where the melting is driven by imposing the fixed temper￾ature at x = 0:
• The sharp phase boundary: the governing equation is

∂α T

• The diffuse phase boundary: the governing equation is

The memory of the latent heat accumulation is lumped on the interface through
the fractional interphase speed dαs/dtα in the sharp interface model while in the208 8 Fractional Derivative Models
diffusive model each point in the melt retains the memory of both the sensible and
latent heat—the memory of the latent heat accumulation is distributed.
Meilanov et al. [14] considered the non-local Stefan problem and solved the
Eq. (8.1) written for the solid and the liquid phases coupled by the condition at
the crystallization front ζ (τ ) (the dimensionless variables ξ = x/L and τ = t/τ0 are
used)

Sierociuk et al. [15] exploited the time-fractional Fourier equation to study the
heat transfer in the non-uniform semi-infinite beam.
Cheng and Pang [16] reviewed the existing definitions of the fractional Laplacian
(−)s [17, 18] (when s = 2 the standard Laplacian is recovered) that is the spatial
integro-differential operator describing the spatial non-locality and the power law
behaviour in the heat conduction:

Cheng and Pang [16] suggested a new implicit definition of the fractional Lapla￾cian using the Riesz fundamental solution. The implicit fractional Laplacian is
defined by the integro-differential operator that satisfies the Fourier transform
F[(−)s
u(x), k] = ||k||s F[u(x), k], x, k ∈ R3
where the Fourier transform and the inverse transform are defined as
uˆ(k) = F(u(x), k) =

and
u(x) = F−1

and that has a fundamental solution of the form

8.1.1 Nonlinear Diffusivity

Using transformations du/dξ = 1/D(ξ ) and ds/dt  = a(t ), u(0) = 0,
s(0) − 0) Fa [19] obtained the solution of the problem of the heat conduction in

Falcini et al. [21] used the limiting case of the Stefan problem—the moisture
infiltration into the porous medium—to study three effects that can extend the appli￾cability of the Fourier equation to account for the anomalous heat diffusion:
• Time non-locality (memory)
• Space non-locality
• Nonlinear spatial dependent thermal diffusivity
and action of their combinations.
The authors considered the heat conduction equation
∂γ T
∂t γ = ∂
∂x

κ(x)
∂αT
∂xα

(8.4)
where α (1 < α ≤ 1) is degree of the space non-locality, γ (1 < γ ≤ 1) is the
measure of the memory effect, and nonlinear diffusivity is described as8.1 Fractional Fourier Model 211
κ(x) = κ0x
2β − 1
β ,
thus β (1 < β ≤ 1) could be considered as a measure of nonlinearity.
The relation between the characteristic time and length scales in the normal heat
conduction (normal diffusion) l ∝ √τ . In the general anomalous case this relation
is written as l ∝ τ n where n = 1/2.
Falcini et al. [21] showed that three non-Fourier effects combine and compete to
determine the time exponent
n = γ
1 + α +
 1
β − 2
.
Thus deviations from the Fourier law behaviour could be described by different non￾Fourier effects, for example, the roles of fractional derivatives and suitable nonlin￾earity of the thermal diffusivity are interchangeable [21] and the anomalous diffusion
effects could be obtained by the different combinations:
• Subdiffusion (n < 1/2):
– Memory only
– Nonlinearity only, β ∈ (0, 0.5]
– Memory + non-locality, 1 + α > 2γ
– Memory + nonlinearity, βγ < 1/2
– Non-locality + nonlinearity, α + 1/β > 3
• Superdiffusion (n > 1/2):
– Nonlinearity only, β ∈ (0.5, 1]
– Memory + non-locality, 1 + α < 2γ
– Memory + nonlinearity, βγ > 1/2
– Non-locality + nonlinearity, 3 > α + 1/β > 2
• Superdiffusion+ (n > 1):
– Non-locality + nonlinearity, α + 1/β < 2
8.1.2 Fractional Pennes Model
The time-fractional generalization (∂α/∂tα is the Caputo fractional derivative of
order α ∈ (0, 1] T, α is sometimes called the order of fractionality) of the Pennes
bioheat Eq. (1.5)
c
∂αT
∂tα =∇· λ∇T + cbωb(Ta − T ) + ˙qmet + Qext, (8.5)212 8 Fractional Derivative Models
was used by Damor et al. [22] to study the hyperthermia and the anomalous diffusion
in the skin tissue with the constant and the sinusoidal heat flux at the boundary [23,
24] and by Ezzat et al. [25] to study the temperature transient in the skin exposed to
the instantaneous surface heating.
As noted by Ferras et al. [26], the Eq. (8.5) is not dimensionally consistent and
one has to either redefine the coefficients of these equations or to introduce a factor
τ 1−α to get a “new” thermal conductivity.
Singh et al. [27] used the space–time-fractional bioheat equation
ρC
∂β
∂β = λ
∂α

to study the heat transfer in the tissues during the thermal therapy.
8.2 Zingales’s Fractional-Order Model
Zingales [28] (see also [18]) considered two components of the heat transfer in the
rigid solid bodies at rest
1. The short-range heat flux governed by the conventional Fourier law.
2. The long-ranged heat transfer between the elementary volumes located at the
points x and y that is proportional to
• The product of the interacting masses;
• The temperature difference T (x) − T (y);
• The distance-decaying function g(||x − y||) .
The long range correlations of the local thermodynamic variables in the non￾equilibrium steady-state (NESS) systems are studied by Bertini et al. [29] using the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the non-equilibrium free energy.
Zingales assumed that the distance-decaying function g decays as the power law
of the distance
g(||x − y||) = 1
dn(α)¯
1
||x − y||n+α
where dn(α)¯ is the normalizing coefficient related to the decaying exponent α and to
the dimension of the topological space of the body n.
Finally the energy balance equation is written in the form

8.3 Fractional Cattaneo and SPL Models
The hyperbolic models of the non-Fourier heat conduction suffer from the unrealistic
singularity of the temperature gradient across the thermal wavefront; the fractional
calculus for differentiation and integration can remove the thermal wave singularity
[30].
Sometimes the fractional version of Cattaneo equation is called “non-local”
Cattaneo–Vernotte equation, reflecting the basic properties of the fractional deriva￾tives [31].
Liu et al. [32] used the modification of the Cattaneo model by Christov to develop
the space-fractional equation with the Riesz derivative.
A time-fractional SPL model for the bioheat transfer is formulated as [33]

Computations show that the fractional SPL equation give the same temperature
distribution as the DPL model [33].
The space-fractional SPL model was formulated for the one-dimensional case by
Kumar et al. [34]

Qi et al. [37] studied the laser heating generalizing the Cattaneo relation as
τ p Dp
t q + q = −λ∇T ; 0 < p < 1,
where Dp
t is the Caputo derivative of order p; the factor τ p is introduced to keep the
dimensionality in order.
Povstenko [38, 39] and Jiang and Xu [40] proposed the time-fractional Fourier
law as the constitutive relationship
q = −κ D1−α∇T
where D1−α the Caputo fractional derivative. Povstenko [41] showed that many
fractional generalizations of the Cattaneo relation could be obtained from the time￾non-local genealization where the kernels are functions of the Mittag-Leffler type
(see Sect.A.3.3.1).
Xu et al. [42] formulated the fractional Cattaneo equation using two fractional
derivatives (Caputo) of the different order. The authors started with the generalized
constitutive equation
∂β−1q
∂tβ−1 + τ

transfer in the thin films.
Moroz et al. [46] used the space–time-fractional version of the SPL model to
simulate the heat conduction in the ferroelectric material (triglycine sulphate).
Hristov [47, 48] developed the space-fractional equation for the transient heat
conduction with the damping term expressed via the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional
derivative [49] that is the extension of the Caputo fractional derivative with the

8.4 Fractional DPL Model
Ji et al. [55] derived the fractional DPL model starting with one-dimensional version
of the original general definition (2.25)
q(x, t + τq ) = −λTx (x, t + τT )

Ji et al. [56] used the time-fractional DPL and the developed by the authors earlier

The authors have changed the relaxation times of DPL model τq and τT to τ α

Xu et al. used the nonlinear least-square method to estimate simultaneously two
relaxation times and two or up to degrees of fractionality.
Kumar and Rai [58] solved the time-fractional dual-phase-lag model to study the
heat transfer within the skin tissue during the thermal therapy. To reduce the time￾fractional equation into the system of ordinary differential equations, the spatial
descretization in space is applied. Then the time-fractional ODEs are converted into
Sylvester matrix equation by using the finite element Legendre wavelet Galerkin8.5 Fractional TPL Model 217
method with utilization of the block pulse function in terms of Caputo fractional￾order derivative.
Famy [59] proposed a new hybrid algorithm based on integrating the local radial
basis function collocation method and the general boundary element method for
studying time fractional DPL problems in the functionally graded tissues. The author
claims that the general solution, T , of the time-fractional DPL equation is the sum of
the Tf , the solution of the fractional-order governing equation without dual phase
lags, and Td , the solution of the DPL governing equation without fractional derivative
T = Tf + Td .

8.5 Fractional TPL Model
Ezzat et al. [62, 63] obtained the Fractional TPL model (FTPL) taking the Taylor
series expansion on the both sides of the constitutive relation of the TPL model (2.42)
and retained the terms up to 2αF -order for the relaxation time τq and up to αF -order

The fractional TPL model as well as ordinary TPL one was used to study the prob￾lems of the thermoelasticity [62, 63] and the piezoelectric thermoelasticity problems.
Ezzat et al. [62] use the energy conservation equation for the homogeneous
isotropic thermoelastic solid

where Q is the heat source, CE is the specific heat at constant strain, eii are the
components of the strain tensor, γ = (3ν + 2μ)αT , ν,μ are the Lame’s constants,
αT is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion.218 8 Fractional Derivative Models

This equation is an extension of the Green–Naghdi theory of type II. The heat
conduction equation of the Green–Naghdi theory of type II [64]
ρCE T¨ + γ T0e¨ − ρQ˙ = λ
∇2 T
is obtained if τT = τv = τq = 0.
• When αF = 1, τT = τv = τq = 0 (hence τ 
v = λ) the Eq. (8.11) reduces to the heat
conduction equation of the Green–Naghdi theory of type III [65, 66]
ρCE T¨ + γ T0e¨ − ρQ˙ = λ
∇2 T + λ∇2 T.
• When αF = 1 and λ = 0 the equation (8.11) reduces to the heat conduction
equation of the DPL model [67, 68].
• When αF = 1 and λ = 0, τT = τv = 0, τq > 0, the Eq. (8.11) reduces (neglecting
τ 2
q ) to the Lord-Shulman model [69].
• When αF = 1 the Eq. (8.11) reduces to the heat conduction equation of the TPL
model.
• When 0 < αF ≤ 1, τT = τv = 0 and neglecting τ 2αF
q the fractional model due to
Sherief et al. [70] is obtained.8.5 Fractional TPL Model 219
8.5.1 Non-local Fractional TPL Model
Akbarzadeh et al. [30] suggested the non-local fractional three-phase-lag (NL FTPL)
heat conduction model. The constitutive equation of NL FTPL heat conduction is
written as
q(r + λq , t + τq ) = −[λJ αF−1∇T (r +λT , t + τT ) + λ J αF−1∇v(r + λv, t + τv)]
(8.12)
where 0 ≤ αF ≤ 2, J α is the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral.
Alternative forms of the constitutive Eq. (8.12) can be derived by the Taylor series
expansion of the correlation lengths λq , λT , λv in the space domain and of the relax￾ation times τq , τT , τv in the time domain.
The heat conduction equation is obtained by the elimination of the heat flux from
the constitutive equation and the energy conservation equation. In the case of the
second-order Taylor expansion for both the correlation lengths and the relaxation
times it is written (in the absence of the volumetric heat source) as [30]

Akbarzadeh et al. [30] also derived the wave-like NL FTPL for the homogenous
medium by simplifying the NL FTPL heat conduction Eq. (8.13) using the first-order
Taylor series expansion of λq in space and the second-order Taylor series expansion
of τq and the first-order Taylor series expansion of τT and τv in time:

The authors noted that τq , τT , τv could present the delayed thermal responses
due to the collisions of electrons and phonons, the temporary momentum loss, the
normal relaxation in the phonon scattering, and the internal energy relaxation [71,220 8 Fractional Derivative Models
72] and the time-fractional derivative removes the thermal wave singularity across
the thermal wavefront and is used to present the subdiffusion (0 ≤ α < 1), normal
diffusion (α = 1) and superdiffusion phenomena (1 <α< 2) [73].
The NL FTPL heat conduction shows that the non-local length of heat flux in the
absence of heat generation only contributes in the mixed derivative term implying
the negligible effect of heat flux non-locality on the thermal responses for long-term
and steady-state heat transport analysis and the reduction of thermal behaviour of
NL FTPL to transient Fourier heat conduction [72, 74].

Fractional Boltzmann

entropy flux and the entropy production rate for the standard and fractional phonon

The authors stressed that the last equation does not require small temporal or

conduction problems in contrast to Eq. (9.2) that requires small temporal and spatial

The authors investigated the fractional BTE in the framework of models of the
GCE class (see Sect. 2.1). The fractional BTE in the RTA is written as follows:
τ γ −1Dγ
t f + vg · ∇ f = f − f0

where Dγ

The fractional Fokker–Planck (FFP) equation could describe the different trans￾port regimes—subdiffusive, normal and superdiffusive. The FFP equation can be
derived using the stochastic approach for the processes with the finite increments
(such as, for example, the continuous-time random walks model, Sect. 9.1) or the
processes with the continuous trajectories (fractional Brownian motion) [3]. This
equation also could be derived in the framework of the phenomenological linear
response theory [4].

The parameter γ = 1 corresponds to the normal diffusion, and γ = 1 describes
the anomalous behaviour—subdiffusion (γ < 1) or superdiffusion (γ > 1).

Sokolov [3] noted that Eq. (9.4) is the only description of the nearly equilib￾rium systems showing the linear response since they fulfil the Nyquist theorem that
connects the linear response behaviour with the noise spectrum at the equilibrium.
Sokolov proved that Eq. (9.4) in the subdiffusive case (γ < 1) is “thermodynam￾ically sound”—it provides the solution P(x, t) that will stay non-negative for the
non-negative initial condition P(x, 0) in the arbitrary time-independent potential
force field (earlier this result was obtained by Schneider and Wyss [6] for the force￾free case)—it correctly describes the transport of the positively defined density. On
the other hand, the solution is not “thermodynamically sound” in the superdiffusive
case (1 < γ ≤ 2) unless some additional conditions are fulfilled.
9.1 Continuous-Time Random Walks
Diffusion is essentially the macroscopic manifestation of the random microscopic
motion of the particles. The word particle is used in the generic sense and, depending
on the problem, may refer to the real particles (e.g. electrons) or to the spatially local￾ized entity that can be transported, such as the fluid mass or the energy packet. This
idea has been generalized in the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) formalism,
which leads to the generalized master equation (GME) that provides the useful mod￾els of the transport. Under some conditions the fluid limit of the GME corresponds
to the Fokker–Planck (FP) diffusion equation in the inhomogeneous systems, which
reduces to Fick’s law when the system is homogeneous [7]. The CTRW formal￾ism does not enter into the details of the physical processes underlying the particle
motion.
The continuous-time random walks model introduced by Montrol and Weiss [8,
9] is based on the description of the energy transport in the system by the random
motion of the particles each carrying a single quantum of energy. Thus, the local
energy density and the energy current at any point are directly proportional to the
particle density and current, respectively [10–12].
In the general random walk models [13–15] a single particle located at the space
(x
, t
) has a certain probability p(x − x
, t − t
) to move to a new point (x, t). Each
step of the walk consists in
• choosing a time of walk τ from a given distribution;
• and then moving it at speed v over a distance x = vτ .
CTRW arises [16] by a sequence of the independently identically distributed
(IID) positive random waiting times T1, T2,..., with probability distribution func-230 9 Fractional Boltzmann and Fokker–Planck Equations
tion (PDF) ψ(x − x
, t − t
)), t > 0 and sequence of the IID random jumps
X1, X2,..., ∈ R with the PDF ψ(x − x
, t − t
). Frequently these probability dis￾tribution functions are temporal and spatial invariant—ψ(t) and w(x)—that enables
the use of the Laplace–Fourier transform [17].
An essential assumption is that the waiting time distribution and the jump length
distribution are independent of each other. The stochastic process is Markovian if
and only if the wating time PDF is of the form ψ(t) = m exp(−mt) with positive m
[16].
The CTRW model is a generalization of the compound Poisson model in which the
underlying Poisson process is replaced by the renewal process [18]. In the Poisson
process the waiting times are the exponentially distributed IID random variables.
In the renewal process the waiting times have the general distribution. The only
“memoryless” distribution is the exponential one, and thus the only Markov renewal
process is the Poisson one.
The transition from the microscopic level to the macroscopic level by scaling
produces four classes of the motion: the Brownian motion, the Lévy motion, the
subordinated Brownian motion and the subordinated Lévy motion [18]. These classes
are similar to the random motions derived by Eliazar and Schlesinger [18] from
the Langevin motion (two Markov motions—the Brownian motion and the Lévy
motion, two non-Markov motions—the fractional Brownian motion, the fractional
Lévy motion).
Eliazar and Schlesinger noted that these classes of motion are the self-similar pro￾cesses, but have the different statistical behaviour: the increments of the subordinated
Brownian/Lévy motions are not Gauss/Lévy distributed and are non-stationary, while
the increments of the fractional Brownian/Lévy motions are Gauss/Lévy distributed
and stationary.
The evolution equation for the probability p(x, t) of finding the random walker at
the position x at the time instant t (the Montrol–Weiss equation [19]) can be written
(for the initial condition p(x, 0), i.e. the walker is initially at the origin) as

The function (t) is the survival function—the probability that at the instant t
the walker is still sitting in the starting position x = 0.
The special choice w(x) = δ(x − 1) gives the “pure renewal process” with the
position x(t) = N(t) denoting the counting function with all jumps of the length 1
in the positive direction at the renewal instants [20].9.1 Continuous-Time Random Walks 231

If the CTRW is Markovian, by the choice of unit of time (t) = δ(t) [21] we get
the exponential waiting time φ(t) = e−t and the most general master equation for

Sánchez et a. [17] called the considered above CTRW model integrable due to the
spatial and temporal-invariant dependencies of the waiting time and the jump proba￾bility distribution functions that simplifies the use of the Laplace–Fourier transform.
The authors proposed to extend the model to the non-integrable CTRW case using
for the step-size PDF of the function w(x − x
, h(x

nonlinear function of the form

,
where n(x
, t) is the walker density—the probability of the walker being at the point
x at time t.
This extended CTRW model could describe the nonlinear interaction between the
multiple transport mechanisms. As an example, the authors considered the case of
the two transport channels. The step-size PDF is written as
w(x − x

1 The Lévy PDF is characterized by three parameters [17]:
1. α gives the asymptotic behaviour of the function at large k and for α = 19.1 Continuous-Time Random Walks 233
while the second process is diffusive characterized by the Gaussian.
The “projectors” λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t) are arbitrary as long as they are positive
and satisfy
λ1(x, t) + λ2(x, t) = 1.
As Sánchez et al. [17] noted, the CTRW model defined by Eq. (9.11) even it is
Markovian in time by choosing the waiting time exponential could keep some sort of
the system memory—the past events could affect the system later evolution—due to
the nonlinearity hidden in the functions λ1(x, t) and λ2(x, t). This model was used
to study the turbulent particle transport in the plasma confined in the tokamak [7].
The authors considered the fluid limit of the CTRW model that is achieved in the
limit of the large distances (k → 0 in the Fourier space) and of the long times (s → 0
in the Laplace space). Equation (9.12) in the fluid limit simplifies to

The non-integrable CTRW model (9.11) is based on the assumption that all trans￾port channels share the same temporal dynamics, i.e. are characterized by the same
waiting time probability distribution function. Sánchez et al. showed that this restric￾tion could be removed and that the finally obtained fractional differential equation
with the Riesz derivative for the walker density could be considered as the simplest
nonlinear generalization of the distributed-order fractional equation (Sect. A.3.1).
The diffusion equation is obtained from the CTRW model by the rescaling of the
waiting times and jumps [22]. It is achieved by making smaller the waiting times by
a positive factor τ and jumps by a positive factor h.
The reduced waiting times τ Tn have pdf φτ (t) = φ(t/τ )/τ and the reduced jumps
h Xn have PDF wh(x) = w(x/h)/h, thus the the generalized master equation in the
Fourier–Laplace domain is written as [22]

In the absence of the external force F(x) = 0 Eq. (9.14) describes the Gaussian
evolution. This equation describes the overdamped motion and thus has no explicit
dependence on the velocity of the test particle. The fractional Fokker–Plank equa￾tion was suggested to model the quantum particle interacting with the chaotic bath:
Kuznetsov et al. [26] considered the dynamics of a system coupled to a chaotic sub￾system described through random matrix theory and found that the reduced density
matrix can display dynamics given by Lévy stable laws.

Gorenflo et al. [22, 29] proposed the generalized space–time fractional diffusion
equation to describe the evolution in time of the spatial probability density related
to the self-similar stochastic process as
Dβ
 P(x, t) = Dα
θ P(x, t), −∞ < x < ∞, t ≥ 0, (9.18)
where the real parameters α, β, θ are restricted as 0 < α ≤ 2, 0 < β ≤ 1, |θ| ≤
min[α, 2 − α].
In Eq. (9.18) Dα
θ is the Riesz–Feller space-fractional derivative of order α and
skewness θ, Dβ
 is the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order β. The particular
cases of this equation are the space-fractional diffusion equation (0 <α< 2, β =
1), the time-fractional diffusion equation (α = 2, 0 <β< 1) and the standard
diffusion equation (α = 2, β = 1) [22].
The fundamental solution (the Green function) of Eq. (9.18) Gθ
α,β (x, t) is the
solution with the initial condition u(x, 0+) = δ(x)—the probability density evolving
in time with the scaling property

9.1.1 Lévy (Khintchine–Lévy) Walks
The Lévy (also Khintchine–Lévy or Lévy–Gnedenko [17]) walks [32–34] or the
Lévy flights2 are the random walks of the step length of which follow the probability
with the heavy power law tails such that the clusters of the short steps are connected
by the rare long steps [36] and are able to describe the anomalous heat transport
[37–39]. Lévy walks model combines the ability to generate the fast diffusion and a
finite velocity of the random walker [36].
It is claimed that the Lévy walks occur in nature: the wandering albatrosses
(Diomedea exulans) perform Lévy flights which are more efficient than the Brownian
search when searching for the prey on the ocean surface; the similar search strategies
are used by the deer and the bumblebees [36, 40]. However, the closer examination
of the foraging trips of the albatrosses does not confirm this statement [41]—the
flight durations are consistent with the shifted gamma distribution
f (t) = rs
(s)
γ s−1
er y
where s is the shape parameter and r is the rate parameter.
The Lévy walks occur in other cases, for example, in the energy space for the single
molecules interacting with the two-level systems via the long-range interactions [40].
There are two approaches to incorporate the finite velocity of the random walkers
[36]:
• After spending the waiting time, the walker does not jump instantaneously, but
moves with a constant speed to its destination.
• Waiting time periods are eliminated, and the walker is always on the move.
Thus the second approach requires the speed of the particle v and only one distribution
function—the PDF of the duration of movement ψ(τ ). The frequency of the velocity
changes at a given point is [36]
ν(x, t) =

φ(y, τ )ν(x − y, t − τ )dτ + δ(t)P0(x)
where the coupled transition probability φ(y, t) accounts for the fact that only par￾ticles flying from x − vτ and x + vτ can reach the point x in time τ and change the
direction of their velocities
φ(y,τ) = 1
2
δ(|y| − vτ )ψ(τ ).
2 Shlesinger [35] noted that while the term Lévy flight only addresses the end points of the jump
and does not account for the time spent in the flight or points crossed, the term Lévy walk implies
that the time of the flight and all points on the flight are accounted for.238 9 Fractional Boltzmann and Fokker–Planck Equations

δ(|y| − vτ )(τ )
is the probability density to travel a distance y and remain in the state of flight.
Zaburdaev et al. [36] solved this equation using the combined Fourier–Laplace
transform
P(k,s) = [(s + ikv) + (s − ikv)]P0(k)
2 − [ψ(s + ikv) + ψ(s − ikv)] .
This solution can be used for the analysis of the particular cases. For example,
for the exponentially distributed flight time ψ(τ ) after the substitution of its Laplace
transform and the subsequence inversion the telegraph equation results
∂ P
∂t
+ τ0
∂2P
∂t 2 = DP(x, t)
where D = v2τ . This equation describes the almost ballistic spreading of the particles
on the very short times. As time goes, the diffusive evolution starts to dominate for
t  τ0.
The Lévy flights are the Markovian stochastic processes with the individual jumps
having PDF w(x) decaying at large x as W(x) ∝ |x|
−1−α with 0 <α< 2, the
extremely long jumps may occur, and the typical trajectories are self-similar, on
all scales showing clusters of the short jumps interspaced by the long excursions.
In contrast to the “area-filling” nature of the Gaussian random walk, Lévy flights
have a fractal dimension with the exponent α and consist of self-similar clusters
connected by the long-distance jumps; this happens on all length scales creating
slowly decaying spatial correlations [10].
The Lévy stable PDF can be defined through its characteristic function of the
probability density, i.e. its Fourier transform [40]

Thus the Lévy stable PDF is determined by four real parameters:
• α ∈ [0, 2] which is the index of stability (the Lévy index) defines the asymptotic
decay of the PDF.
• β ∈ [−1, 1] which is the skewness parameter defines the asymmetry.
• μ is the shift parameter.
• σ > 0 is the scale parameter.
The shift and the scale parameters can be eliminated by the shift and scale trans￾formations

The Lévy stable PDF for the arbitrary α can be expressed via the Fox H-functions

There are two generalizations of the Lévy walks model [36]:
• Lévy walks with random velocities;
• Lévy walks with rests where the waiting periods alternate with the periods of the
ballistic motion.

where (t) describes the white noise statistics that models the Brownian motion
leading to the dependence x 2 ∝ Dt. There are cases of anomalous diffusion with
different dependencies x 2 ∝ Dαtα, α = 1 (subdiffusion α < 1, superdiffusion9.3 Li and Cao Model 241
1 <α< 2, ballistic α = 2, turbulent diffusion α = 3) that could be described by the
fractional generalization of Eq. (9.19).
There are three different formulations of the fractional Kramers–Fokker–Planck
equation [44]:
• Metzler and Klafter [11, 45] obtained this equation by means of the non-Markovian
generalization of the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation
∂ f (x, u, t)
∂t
= [−u · ∇x − F(x) · ∇u + LF P ]γδ D1−δ t f (x, u, t); (9.20)
• Barkai and Silbey [46] suggested the equation

∂t


f (x, u, t) = LF P γδ D1−δ t f (x, u, t) (9.21)
where γδ is the damping coefficient and D1−δ t is the fractional derivative whose
Laplace space representation is written as D1−δ t ⇔ λ1−δ ;
• Friedrich et al. [47] using the concept of CTRW derived the equation
 ∂
∂t
+ u · ∇x + F(x) · ∇u

f (x, u, t) = LF P γδD1−δ t f (x, u, t) (9.22)
where D1−δ t is the fractional derivative whose Laplace space representation is
written as D1−δ t ⇔ [λ + u · ∇x + F(x) · ∇u].
9.3 Li and Cao Model
Li and Cao [48] considered the fractional linearized Boltzmann transport equation
(the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook kinetic equation) suggested by Goychuk [49]

 fMB − f

, (9.23)
where f = f (x, t, v) is the single-particle distribution function, v is the particle
velocity, fMB is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, Dα
t is the Riemann–Liouville
fractional derivative and 0 < α ≤ 1.
The standard Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model leads to the following expression
for the thermal conductivity
λ = 5k2
B Tρτ
2 m2
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, ρ is the density, τ is the relaxation time, and m
is mass of the particle.242 9 Fractional Boltzmann and Fokker–Planck Equations
Equation (9.23) does not have a stationary solution in the non-equilibrium cases
because τ α−1Dα
t ( fMB − f ) is zero only if f = fMB [48]; thus Li and Cao consider
the quasi-stationary heat conduction in the time-independent temperature field.
The energy density and the heat flux are written as, respectively,
e(x, t) = m

(v − c)

and
q(x, t) = m

where c =  vdv.

(v − c)
2
(v − c)v · ∇ f dv − ∂tq


|v − c|
2
(v − c)v · ∇ fMBdv. (9.24)
For the pure conduction case (c = 0, ∇ · v = 0) Eq. (9.24) simplifies to

Equation (9.24) could be written as

Thus the heat flux is the sum of two contributions q = q0 + qT .9.3 Li and Cao Model 243

Evidently, the long-time behaviour of the heat flux is dominated by the temperature
gradient q ∝ tα∇T .
Multiplying Eq. (9.23) by |v − c| and integrating it yield the energy conservation
equation
τ α Dα+1 t + τ ∂2
t T = κ∇2 T +
T |t=0τ α
tα+1(−α), (9.27)
which reduces to the Cattaneo model for α = 0.
When the initial value term in Eq. (9.27) is neglected, this equation belongs to the
so-called class GCE II [50]. However, the constitutive relation for Eq. (9.27) does
not follow from Eq. (9.26) but is written as
q + τ 1−α D1−α t q = −τ −α D−α
t κ∇T.
Li and Cao also considered other versions of the fractional linearize BTE contain￾ing in contrast to Eq. (9.23) the standard collision source term without any memory
kernel that lead to other constitutive relations introduced in the class CGE II:
τ −α D1−α t f + vg · ∇ f = f0 − f

In the case of the phonon heat transport Eq. (9.23) is rewritten as

Multiplying of these equations by ω and integrating over the wave vector space

Elasticity and Thermal Expansion
Coupling
Elasticity is not connected to the Fourier heat conduction without thermal expansion.
However, with the nonzero thermal expansion the position dependent temperature
influences the strains and displacements. The coupled equations of the Fourier heat
conduction, of the elastic mechanics and of the kinematics relationships lead, after
elimination of the mechanic and the kinematic quantities, to the equation for the
temperature that contains the higher derivative corrections to the Fourier equation.
Fülöp et al. [1] analysed in detail the simplest case of the small strain regime of
the homogeneous isotropic solid material at rest with the constant thermodynamic
properties. The constitutive relations for the Hooke-elastic material are written as
σˆ d = Ed Dˆ d , σˆ s = Es Dˆ s
,
where Ed = 2G, Es = 3K and the superscripts d and s denote the deviatoric (trace￾less) and the spherical parts, respectfully, of the stress tensor σˆ and the strain tensor

where ˆI is the unit tensor, thus

The shift is rather small; for example, it is about 1% for steel and copper and
about 6% for aluminium at the room temperature [1].
Bargmann and Favata [2] developed the continuum thermomechanical analysis
of the laser-pulsed heating in the polycrystals that includes the highly nonlinear
strongly coupled system of the governing equations describing the heat conduction,
the species diffusion and the finite elastic effects.
The laser pulse transfers the significant amount of energy that is tightly packed in
time and space and causes the coupled thermal and mechanical effects. These effects
are either desirable (e.g. the attenuation of defects in the metals and semiconductors
due to the annealing) or undesirable (e.g. the laser-induced damage).10 Elasticity and Thermal Expansion Coupling 249
The authors considered three basic evolution phenomena:
• Thermal conduction (thermal waves)
• Lattice straining (mechanical waves)
• Defect dynamics
and formulated the continuum model based on the balance of the internal energy, the
linear momentum, the concentration, the order parameter and the entropy inequality.
The energy equation is written (for each body part P) as
E˙(P) = Q(P) + 	s
(P) + T (P)
where
E(P) =

P
ρ0εdV,
ε is the volume density of internal energy, the heat inflow is
Q(P) =

∂ P
Q · ndA +

Q is the heat flux, r is the heat source, the stress power is

Pˆ is the Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, F is the deformation gradient, the energy flow

T (P) =

∂ P
μD · ndA +

P
μddV,
μ is the chemical potential, D is the defect flux, and d is the defect density.
Using the localization procedure, the authors formulated the energy balance equa￾tion as
ρε˙ = −div Q + ρr + Pˆ : F˙ + μn˙ − D · ∇μ.
Thus there are two contributions into the energy equation due to the coupling
of different phenomena: the first containing the Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor and
the deformation gradient called the Gough–Joule effect (the deformations lead to
the heating), and the second one is responsible for the heating due to the species
diffusion [2].
Sellitto et al. [3] considered the coupled nonlinear first- and second-sound propa￾gation along equilibrium and non-equilibrium states of a thermoelastic system under-250 10 Elasticity and Thermal Expansion Coupling
going small perturbations. The nonlinear constitutive equation for the Cauchy stress
and the nonlinear heat transport equation for the heat flux are used. These equations
account for relaxational and nonlinear effects, as well as for the coupling between
strain tensor and heat flux. The speeds of thermomechanical waves are found to
depend on whether the waves are travelling along, or against, a superimposed heat
flux.
10.1 Non-Fourier Thermoelasticity
The classical thermoelasticity theory (Biot’s theory) is based on the Fourier equa￾tion [4]. One of the first studies of the “thermoelasticity with second sound” was
performed by Chandrasekharaiah [5]. Later he used a generalized linear thermoelas￾ticity theory to study the phenomena in piezoelectric media [6]. The reviews of the
early studies in the hyperbolic thermoelasticity were published by Chandrasekhara￾iah [7] and Hetnarski and Ignaczak [8].
Lord and Shulman [9] and Green and Lindsay [10] have extended the thermoe￾lasticity by introducing the thermal relaxation times in the constitutive equations.
Lord and Shulman have considered isotropic solids and introduced one relaxation
time parameter into the Fourier heat conduction equation; thus the heat equation
associated with this theory is hyperbolic. A direct consequence is that the paradox
of infinite speed of propagation inherent in both the uncoupled and coupled theories
of classical thermoelasticity is eliminated.
For example, Arai and Yamazaki [11] numerically studied thermoelastic wave
coupled with non-Fourier heat conduction equation using the generalized Hooke’s
law written as the Duhamel–Neumann-type equation under a small strain assumption:
σi j = 2μεi j + λδi j − β(T − T0)δi j
where σi j is the stress tensor, εi j is the strain tensor, μ and λ are Lame’s constants,
 = εii is the volumetric strain, and β is expressed as β = (3λ + 2μ)α.
The equation of motion for linear elastic media in the absence of body forces is
expressed as
u¨i = μ∂k∂kui + (λ + μ)∂ − β∂T.
The non-Fourier heat conduction equation coupled with the effect of thermoelastic
dilatation is
κ∂i ∂i T = ρcE (T˙ + τ0T¨) − T
∂σi j
∂T (ε˙i j + τ0ε¨i j)
where cE = −T ∂2φ/∂T 2, the Helmholtz free-energy function φ(εi j, T ) =
e(εi j, T ) − T s(εi j, T ), e is the internal energy, and s is the entropy density.
The non-Fourier model with one relaxation time was extended to the anisotropic
case by Dhaliwal and Sherief [12].10.1 Non-Fourier Thermoelasticity 251
Green and Lindsay have developed a temperature rate-dependent thermoelasticity.
In this theory, both the equations of motion and the heat conduction equations are
hyperbolic.
Another generalization to the coupled theory of elasticity is what is known as the
theory of the thermoelasticity with two relaxation times. Also, Green and Naghdi [13–
16] have proposed three formulations of the thermoelasticity based on the inequality
of entropy balance [17] and the constitutive equation for the heat flux q˙i = (−λT˙
,i +
κT,i) where κ is the material constant characteristic of the Green & Naghdi [18].
The triple-phase-lag model has been used for the thermoelasticity problems (e.g.
[19, 20]), including the magneto-thermoelastic problems in a piezoelastic medium
[21].
Borjalilou et al. used the dual-phase-lag model to solve the problem of the
thermoelasticity—they analysed the damping of the microbeams [22]. Luo et al. [23]
studied numerically the transient thermoelastic responses of a slab with temperature￾dependent thermal conductivity.
10.1.1 Fractional Thermoelasticity
Recently Sheordan and Kundu [24] published the review of the fractional-order
generalized thermoelasticity theories. The authors considered, among others,
• Sherief’s model [25]. The heat conduction equation is written as
qi + τ0
∂α
∂tα qi = −κi j T,j, 0 < α ≤ 1;
• Youssef’s model [26]. The heat conduction equation is written as
qi + τ0
∂α
∂tα qi = −κi j I α−1T,j, 0 < α ≤ 2,
where
I α−1 f (x, t) = 1
(α) t

• Ezzat’s model [27]
qi +
τ0
(α + 1)
∂α
∂tα qi = −κi j T,j, 0 < α ≤ 1;
• Ezzat’s TPL model (see Sect. 8.5).
Abbas [28] formulated the fractional thermoelasticity model using the Green and
Naghdi model.252 10 Elasticity and Thermal Expansion Coupling
Guo et al. [29] suggested a modified fractional-order generalized piezoelectric
thermoelasticity model with variable thermal conductivity to better predict the inter￾actions mechanisms for piezoelectric medium in non-uniform thermal environment.
The authors note that the time-fractional-order models available in literatures [30–
32] are not unique in the form and that the time-fractional derivative contained in
them shares some limitations:
• The fixed forms of kernel functions in it fail to satisfy the needs of reflecting
memory effects in different processes.
• It may be invalid in describing the memory effect for large time.
To compensate for the above-mentioned defects, the concept of memory￾dependent derivative (MDD) was proposed [33]. MDD can be viewed as an exten￾sion of fractional-order derivative and it shares the following advantages to reflecting
memory effect:
1. The time delay and kernel function of MDD can be chosen freely according to
the necessity of application.
2. MDD can characterize the memory effect of a real process that basically occurs
in a segment of time (i.e. the delayed time).
The MDD was in the modelling of behaviour of the viscoelastic [34, 35] and the
thermoelectric materials [36].
Guo et al. formulated the governing equations in the absence of body force, free
charge and inner heat source:
(i) Equation of motion
σi j, j = ¨ui .
(ii) Equation of energy conservation
ρT0 S˙ + qi,i = 0.10.1 Non-Fourier Thermoelasticity 253
(iii) Gauss equation and electric field relation

Here a comma followed by a suffix denotes the derivative with respect to a spatial

To deal with nonlinear thermal conductivity, Kirchhoff transformation method

that leads to the relations
κϑ,i = κ

The authors investigated the dynamic responses of a transient heated thin piezo￾electric plate composed of a material with the variable thermal conductivity κ(θ ) =
κ(1 + κ1) where κ1 is the small quantity to measure the influence of temperature on
thermal conductivity.

The temperature in the sample is written as
T (x, t) = T0 + Tdc(x) + Tac(x, t),
T0 is the ambient temperature, and Tdc(x) and Tac(x, t) = Re[θ (x)eiωt

Thus the general solution of Equation (11.5) for the spatial part of the oscillatory
temperature θ is given by
θ (x) = Beqx + Ce−qx ,

Tzou [19] obtained an analytical solution of the propagation of the thermal dis￾turbance produced by the moving crack.
Jiang [20] considered the radial heat conduction in the hollow sphere with con￾stant properties, where ri is the inner radius and ro is the outer radius. The initial
temperature is uniform and equals to T0. The heat transfer is caused by the sudden
change of the inner surface temperature to Twi and the outer surface temperature to
Two.

ro → ∞) and to the solution of the corresponding parabolic problem for ε → 0.
Barletta and Zancini [21] analysed the non-stationary heat transfer in an infinitely

Zhang et al. [36] used elements of the method of the “manufactured solutions”
(the authors called it “the method of trial and error”) that is based on guessing of
the possible exact solution and obtaining the initial and boundary conditions by
substituting the “guess” solution into the studied equation.
The method of manufactured solutions [37–39] is a simple process, although it
involves the cumbersome algebra: a chosen analytical “exact” solution φex(t, x, y,z)
is substituted into the equations to produce the source terms fex = L(φex, φ
ex, φ
ex)
and the boundary conditions.
This approach is attractive since it could be applied to the multidimensional
domains while allowing the assessment of the solution accuracy. However, its useful￾ness depends on the similarity of the guessed exact solution to the typical solution of
the real problem in question. An availability of the analytical exact solution greatly
reduces the CPU time needed for testing of the non-stationary codes: one can use an
exact solution for the specification of the initial and, if necessary, the (non-steady)
boundary conditions and avoid the need of using large time integration intervals.

where θ is the excess temperature, κ is the thermal diffusivity, τq is the relaxation

Zhukovsky used the operational approach to solve the problem and claimed that
in some regimes the solution could be negative and that the maximum principle could
be violated.
However, this conclusion was not confirmed in the recent paper by Kovács [44].
The initial and boundary conditions were chosen as in the laser flash experiment. The
solution was obtained for two intervals 0 < t < τ and t > τ (τ is the duration of
the laser impulse) in the form of an infinite sum. No negative temperature domains

Jiang and Chen [50] studied the heat transfer in the composite medium consisting
of M parallel layers in the perfect thermal contact that could be considered as the
skin tissue model. The heat conduction problem is governed by the equation
ρc0Dα
t Ti = λi∇(∇Ti) + gi(x, t), 0 < α ≤ 1, i = 1, 2,... M,
where 0Dα
t is the Caputo derivative and gi(x, t) is the metabolic heat generation in
the ith layer.
The boundary conditions are formulated as follows:
• inner surface of the first layer
Ti = Tb
• interface of the ith layer (i = 1, 2, …M - 1)
Ti = Ti+1, λi
∂Ti
∂x = λi+1
∂Ti+1
∂x
• outer surface of the M-th layer
λM
∂TM
∂x + hM−1TM = hM fM(t)
and the initial conditions
T (x, 0) = Fi(x), xi−1 < x < xi .

Prajapati et al. [52] studied the heat transfer within the spinning satellite affected

have if it spun with infinite angular speed so that solar heating would be uniform,
S is the net solar heating, r is the radius of the satellite, f is the rate of rotation, η
is the longitude along the equator with the effect of rotation subtracted out, β is the
ratio of the emissivity of the interior shell to the emissivity of the exterior surface,
and F(η) is either cos(2πη) or zero, depending on the value of η.

Deyinkaya and Kiymaz [62] used the generalized differential transform method
to solve the fractional diffusion equation with the derivatives in the Caputo sense.
Povstenko derived the exact solutions of the fractional heat conduction for the
cases of two joint half-lines [63], the semi-infinite composite material [64] and in an
infinite medium with the spherical inclusion [65].
Junyi and Mingyu [66] obtained the solution of the Stefan problem, and Yang et al.
[67] solved the one-dimensional transient heat conduction with the local fractional
derivatives.
Kazemi and Erjaee [68] studied the multiterm fractional diffusion equation.
Ghosh et al. [69] derived the solution of the linear fractional differential equation

Yang et al. [70] considered heat transfer in the fractal medium with no heat
generation governed by the equation in local fractional derivatives

Evidently, for problems with the complicated geometries or the variable thermal
properties, numerical methods are the only option.
For example, Carey and Tsai [72] used the central and backward difference
schemes to a one-dimensional problem to study oscillations of propagating heat
wave reflected at a boundary. Glass et al. [73] used McCormack predictor-corrector
method to solve the same problem. Tamma and Railkar [74] applied the finite element
method with special shape functions to remove the numerical oscillations. Han-Taw
and Jae-Yuh [75] solved one-dimensional hyperbolic heat equation using Laplace
transform and finite volume technique and later [76] extended the this approach to
two-dimensional problems. Yeung and Lam [77] developed a flux-splitting algo￾rithm based on the Godunov numerical scheme for the solution of the one- and two￾dimensional non-Fourier heat conduction equation. Hsu and Chu [78] used the central
finite difference method to solve the two- and three-dimensional inverse non-Fourier
heat conduction problem in electronic device. Liu and Chen [79] applied a hybrid
application of the Laplace transform and control-volume formulation in conjunction
with the hyperbolic shape functions to investigate the hyperbolic diffusion prob￾lems. Wu and and Li [80] extended the time discontinuous Galerkin finite element
method (DGFEM) developed by Li et al. [81] to the heat wave propagation problem.
Rahideh et al. [82] studied the one- and two-dimensional heat wave propagation in a
medium subjected to different boundary conditions and with temperature-dependent
thermal conductivity using the differential quadrature method (DQM). Yasaf et al.
[83] developed the eighth-order compact finite difference method for the case of
Dirichlet boundary condition and the fourth-order accurate scheme for the Neumann
boundary conditions.

Relativistic Transport
The relativistic fluid flows play the major role in many sectors of physics, such as
the quark–gluon plasmas [1–5] produced in the course of the heavy-ion collisions
due to the transition from hadron to quark and gluon degrees of freedom [6, 7] that
can be observed experimentally in such colliders as the RHIC at Brookhaven and
the LHC at CERN [8, 9], the relativistic astrophysics [10]—for example, the stellar
collapse [11], the accretion [12] or the cosmology problems [13], the distortions of
the cosmic microwave background [14], the electron flows in graphene [15, 16].
The Fourier law leads to a parabolic partial differential equation and thus predicts
the instantaneous propagation of the disturbances—it is called sometimes acausality
[17]. The relativistic version of the Fourier law [18]
qa = −κhab[T;b + T u˙b]
where qa is the heat flux, hab is the projector (projection tensor [19]) orthogonal to
the matter flow, and the semicolon and the dot denote the covariant and the proper
time differentiation, respectively, which is also acausal. Furthermore, as shown by
Hiscock & Lindblom [20, 21] (see also Olson & Hiscock [22]) this equation suffers
from the stability problems—the runaway solutions occur when the homogeneous
perfect-fluid states are perturbed.
The acausality of the Fourier equation effect is a direct consequence of the strong
maximum principle that states that if T attains an interior maximum at one time, it
must be constant for all previous times [23, 24]—if the solution is perturbed locally,
the perturbation is instantly detected at arbitrarily distant point.
Evidently, the Fourier law contradicts the relativity theory. A number of modified
heat conduction models can overcome the infinite heat propagation speed problem
in Fourier law, which violates the relativity, but this does not mean that these models
obey the relativity. A limited speed of heat conduction does not equal the Lorentz
covariance required by relativity [25]. It is necessary that the heat conduction law
obeys the Lorentz covariance and reduces to the Fourier law in the classical limit
[26].280 Part II: Relativistic Transport
Sometimes the “relativistic” heat equation is obtained by formal mathematical
considerations. For example, Marquina [27] used the generalized Fokker–Planck
equation proposed by Rosenau [28] of the form
∂T
∂t
= ∇ f (T, ∇T ).
The solution of this equation allows diffusion fronts propagating at a finite speed,
and the equation is called by some researches (e.g., Jordan et al. [29]) the relativistic
heat equation. The existence and uniqueness of the solution were proved by Andrew
et al. [30, 31].
Marquina rewrite the Fourier Eq. (1.4) as

This solution, as the authors noted, yields a less significant spreading and a larger
reduction of the peak compared to the ordinary heat equation.
A relativistic gas at equilibrium is best characterized by the parameter ζ =
mc2/kT that is commonly used to differentiate between the ultrarelativistic (ζ  1)
and the relativistic (ζ  1) regimes [36].
Mendoza et al. [36] reported a transition from the single peaked to the bimodal
velocity distribution in a relativistic gas under increasing temperature, in contrast
with the non-relativistic gas, where only a broadening of the bell-shaped distribution
is observed: the one-dimensional distribution develops a transition in velocity space,
with the emergence of two separate peaks, moving with opposite, nonzero speeds;
for two and three dimensions, it generates, in velocity space, a ring and a hollow
sphere, respectively. Physically this corresponds to a transition between the regimes
where kinetic energy is mainly stored increasing the velocity and where this is done
by enhancing the mass.
This result is in sharp contrast with the way a non-relativistic gas at rest responds
to the constraint of an increasing temperature, namely through a progressive broad￾ening of the Gaussian shape. On the contrary, the transition exhibited by the Júttner
distribution signals that, even in a gas at rest, the temperature constraint can only
be met by clustering most of the particles around the two oppositely moving beams,
thereby depleting the zero-speed particles in the process. Such transition results from
the interplay between the raise in thermal energy and the constraint of maximum
velocity imposed by the speed of light.
These considerations could be generalized to the case of a moving gas, the
main change being that the two oppositely moving beams get differently populated,
the comoving one being enhanced, and the counter-moving being correspondingly
depopulated. This phenomenon is general, and it might apply to a whole class of
systems where physical signals are forced to move close to the their ultimate limiting
speed.
Thus the equilibrium distribution for relativistic particles, no matter whether clas￾sical or quantum, exhibits a transition as the temperature is brought close to the rest
energy (the ultrarelativistic limit).
The above transition is not transmitted to the conserved macroscopic quantities
(energy and momentum), and thus it is not directly observed at the macroscopic
level. In order to experimentally detect the transition, thermal energies of the order
of the rest energy of the gas particles would be required. This could be achieved, for
example, in hot electron plasmas.
This transition is the organized response of the distribution of particles to the
constraint of an increasing temperature, compatibly with the existence of a limiting
speed for the propagation of physical signals. Mendoza et al. discussed the conditions
under which such transition could be detected in the graphene experiments. In the
case of graphene, the authors have found that the transition takes place, not only by
increasing the temperature, but also by increasing the Fermi energy at constant low
temperature.
Ali & Zhang [37] showed that the hyperbolic heat conduction equation (HHCE)
can be derived not using non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the assumption282 Part II: Relativistic Transport
of the near equilibrium state (thus using local Maxwellian as the non-equilibrium
distribution [38]) but directly from the special theory of relativity, as a direct conse￾quence of the space time duality, without any consideration of the microstructure of
the heat conducting medium.
The authors interpreted the derived HHCE a weak sense: this is achieved by
relaxing the definition of c from speed of light in vacuum to some limiting speed of
the medium. The value of c is no longer a universal constant, nor does it have to be
numerically very large (see Sect. 2.1.1).
The relativistic version of the Navier–Stokes and the Fourier laws from the Boltz￾mann equation [39–41] were obtained by Israel [42] in the sixties of the twen￾tieth century. Relativistic gases are important to describe several astrophysical and
cosmological problems like white dwarfs and neutron stars, the particle production
in the early universe, the controlled thermonuclear fusion and other high-energy
phenomena.
The relativistic transport equation derived by Israel & Stewart [43–45] is written
as
τ hμ
ν qν
,βVβ + qμ = −κhμνT,ν − κhμ
ν T av − 1
2 κT 2
 τVα
κT 2

,αqμ
where Vβ = (c/
√gtt, 0, 0, 0) is the four-heat flux vector, gtt is the metric tensor, av
is the four-acceleration, and comma denotes covariant derivative.
The first term on the left side becomes τ ∂q/∂t in the non-relativistic limit, the
second term is just the heat flux that becomes q, the first term on the right side
is the temperature gradient, while the second term is “purely” relativistic (it was
established by Tollman [46] who studied the conditions of the thermal equilibrium
in the gravitational field).
The last term of the Israel–Stewart theory is absent in some other theories
(e.g.,[47]). It should be noted that in some relativistic theories additional terms could
be present that vanish in the classical limit [48].
Herrera [48] showed how to modify the Israel–Stewart equation that it will produce
the Eq. (2.2) in the non-relativistic limit

In dissipative theories of relativistic fluids one has to consider four fundamental
questions [49]:
•Causality. Only divergence-type theories are, in general, causal because there the
symmetric hyperbolicity of the system of nonlinear evolution equations is established
by construction [50–54]. The weaker version of causality requires for the symmetric
hyperbolicity only for the linearized equations and allows for characteristic speeds
less than the speed of light [55]. This weak causality was studied in the Israel–Stewart
theory—resulting inequalities could be found in [20]. The causality of theories with
parabolic differential equations should also be possible. In this case the validity of
the continuum description is restricted by the characteristic maximal speeds [56, 57].Part II: Relativistic Transport 283
• Generic stability—it is the linear stability of the homogeneous equilibrium
solutions (in the absence of external forces the dissipation always damps pertur￾bations [58]). The simplest relativistic generalization of the Fourier–Navier–Stokes
equations was proved to be unstable by Hiscock & Lindblom [21].
• The correct distinction between the ideal and dissipative fluids—these distinc￾tions are involved in the so-called matching conditions [59–61].
• The proper choice of flow frame—the proper choice of flow frames continues
to be an unsettled question [62]. Frequently it is stated that the flow field uα can be
chosen arbitrarily. It is customary to fix the flow either to the motion of particles
(Eckart frame) [63] or that of the energy density (Landau–Lifshitz frame) [64].
However, Ván & Biró [49] stated that, contrary to the belief in a free choice
of the flow frame, this may not be completely arbitrary, as one associates a given
physical content of the dissipation to each and presented the general flow frame with
the separation of perfect and dissipative parts of energy–momentum and particle
number current density. The key aspect connecting these problems is relativistic
thermodynamics. The most important observation is that the usual assumption of
kinetic equilibrium by introducing the velocity field parallel to the local thermometer
and Lagrange multiplier field βα also appearing in the collision invariant ψ = α +
βαkα acts as a flow frame fixing. The authors tagged this choice as thermometer
frame or Jüttner frame, distinguishing from the Eckart, Landau–Lifshitz and other
conventions.
A single component fluid is characterized by the particle number four-vector Na
and the symmetric energy–momentum density tensor Tab. The velocity field of the
fluid, the flow frame ua, introduces a local rest frame, and the basic fields Na and
Tab can be expanded by their components parallel and perpendicular to the flow
Na = nua + j a, T ab = euaub + qaub + uaqb + Pab
where n is the flow frame particle number density, j
a is the non-convective particle
number current density, e is the energy density, qa is the momentum density, and Pab
is the pressure tensor.
The balances of the particle current density and energy–momentum are expressed
by the local rest frame quantities
∂aNa = ˙n + n∂aua + ∂a j a = 0,
∂bT ab = ˙eua + eu˙a + eua∂bub + ˙qa + qa∂bub + ua∂bqb + qb∂bua + ∂bPab = 0a
where the substantial time derivative d/dt = ua∂a is denoted by and overdot.
In order to provide the validity of the second law of thermodynamics an additional
vector field—the entropy current as a function of the basic fields Sa (Na, Tab)—is
introduced. It must not decrease by fulfilling the conditions of balances of the particle
current density and energy–momentum. That conditional inequality is represented
by introducing the Lagrange–Farkas multipliers α and βa
 ≡ ∂a Sa +α∂aNa −βb∂aT ab ≥ 0. (1)
Note that that the definition of the entropy production is done independent of the
specifying the flow frame.284 Part II: Relativistic Transport
Tsumura & Kunihiro [65] who derived the relativistic hydrodynamic equations
using the renormalization group method claimed that the Landau–Lifshitz frame (the
energy frame) is unique since in that frame the dissipative effects comes from only
the spatial inhomogeneity.
Ván & Biró, however, argued that what is spacelike is a frame-dependent question
and that only the physical systems may reveal by their internal dynamics a physical
ground for the separation of the ideal and dissipative parts of the basic physical
quantities.
In the perfect fluid that deals with the absence of dissipation, the entropy
production vanishes:
0 ≡ ∂a Sa
0 + α∂aNa
0 − βb∂aT ab
0 = 0.
The equilibrium entropy density Sa
0 is connected to the equilibrium particle
number density Na
0 and equilibrium energy–momentum density T ab
0 by the isotropic
pressure [49]:
poβa = Sa
0 + αNa
0 − βbT ab
0
The multipliers α and βa are coefficients in the collision invariant of the equilib￾rium distribution function, ψ = α + βaka, and the pressure is that of an ideal gas
p0 = n0T.
Ván & Biró noted that the freedom in the choice of a flow frame should be
restricted to different handling of non-dissipative currents and introduced the Jüttner
frame defined by the direction of βa (thermometer motion):
ua
J = βa
√
βaβa 
 (2)
In that frame the equilibrium fields are decomposed as:
Na
0 = nJ ua
J , T ab
0 = eJ ua
J ub
J − pab
J , Sa
0 = (bJ hJ − αnJ )ua
J
where hJ = eJ + p0 is the equilibrium enthalpy density in the Jüttner frame and
bJ = baua
J = 1 = /TJ is the reciprocal temperature. Note that α, β, p0 do not have
a frame index since they are introduced before specifying the flow frame.
In the case of a general flow frame ua that is not parallel to βa the difference
between the frames is described by wa = βa/(βbub) − ua The four-vector wa
is orthogonal to ua and spacelike since wawa = − w2. The Lagrange multiplier
four-vector βa can be splitted as
βa = βJ ua
J = β(ua + wa)
where β = βaua is the reciprocal temperature in a general frame defined by ua. The
equilibrium fields in this frame are
Na
0 = nJ ua
J + j

√1 − w2, e = (eJ + pw2)/(1 − w2), j

0 = n0wa, qa
0 = h0waPart II: Relativistic Transport 285
In the equilibrium the Jüttner, Eckart and Landau–Lifshitz frames coincide. The
relativistic theories revealed that the flow frame fixing plays a special role in the
specification of local equilibrium: the momentum density (energy current density)
is not purely dissipative, and therefore in relativistic theories it has to be taken into
account even in local equilibrium.
Ván & Biró introduced the potential a as
a = Sa + αNa − βbT ab (3)
and the thermostatic pressure uaa/β, thus a = βp(ua + ga) where uaga = 0.
The parallel and perpendicular components of the Eq. (3) to the flow ua are
s + αn − β(h + Wb
q ) = 0,
J a + αj a − β(qa + wbab) + βp(wa − ga) = 0a
where h = e + p, ab = Pab + pab is the viscous pressure.
Then it is possible to rewrite the entropy production (1) with flow-related quantities
 = −Na∂aα + T ab∂aβb + ∂aa
and to reduce it to a form collecting terms according to the gradients of intensives.
Ván & Biró identified thermodynamic fluxes and forces and establish functional
relationships that are strictly linear in the first approximation. In particular, the authors
determined the thermal forces and fluxes in the different flow frames:
• A general flow frame.
Force: ∇aβ + βu˙a, Flux: qa − hwa.
• The Eckart flow frame.
Force: ∇aβ + βu˙a, Flux: qa
• The Jüttner flow frame.
Force: abq˙b + qa∂bub + qb∂bua + ac∂bb
c , Flux: −β
h qa.
Unfortunately in the case of The Eckart flow frame a generic instability occurs,
the linear instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, as it was proved by Hiscock &
Lindblom [21]. Non-negative entropy production is established only if considering
the basic balance equations (for energy, momentum and further conserved Noether
charges) as constraints.
The Eckart frame is defined by the direction of the particle current density vector
ua = Na/

NbNb
. In case of dissipative fluids the Jüttner and Eckart frames do
not coincide.
In the case of a Landau–Lifshitz frame the flow field is defined by the direction
of the momentum density vector ua = ubT a
b /ucT a
c . In the case of dissipative fluids
the Jüttner and Landau–Lifshitz frames also do not coincide.
In the case of ultrarelativistic speeds the flow is energy dominated, and therefore
it is reasonable to use Landau–Lifshitz flow frame, where propagation of energy
defines the flow. This choice eliminates the possibility of heat conduction, and only
viscous dissipation is possible.286 Part II: Relativistic Transport

Relativistic Brownian Motion
The Brownian motion is one of the cornerstones of statistical mechanics that has
been used as a stochastic model to represent a variety of different phenomena in
physics, chemistry, biology, finance, etc.,—its universal character rests on it being
the simplest model available for describing time evolution implied by a combination
of random and deterministic factors [1].
Many phenomena are the result of the cooperation of the systematic and random
events. For example, in the case of a molecule of a gas, the free flights between
collisions with other molecules of the systematic part, while the random collisions
with other molecules which interrupt the free flights, constitute the non-systematic
component of the motion [2]. This picture applies to all forms of dynamics, including
relativity, provided a universal time parameter that is defined.
The relativistic Brownian motion [3–7] can be demonstrated on the graphene
chip [8] using the strong applied electric fields or the high enough temperatures to
suppress the quantum transport effects, otherwise dominant in graphene, and to get
the classical (i.e. non-quantum) relativistic motion.
The relativistic Brownian motion is a random process with stationary independent
increments, in which a Brownian particle travels on a geodesic until it is dislodged by
the interaction with another object, which shifts it onto a new geodesic. Thus there
are two aspects to consider:
• the motion of the particle along the smooth parts of its piecewise smooth trajectory
that obeys the deterministic laws of relativistic dynamics;
• the random fluctuations that occur as the particle bounces from one smooth section
of the trajectory to another.
Brownian motion is a series of “jumps” of a particle along its path and necessarily
involves an ordered sequence. In the non-relativistic theory, this ordering is naturally
provided by the Newtonian time parameter. In the relativistic framework, the Einstein
time does not provide the suitable parameter. If one considers the jumps in the

spacetime, to accommodate a covariant formulation, a possible spacelike interval
between two jumps may appear in two orderings in the different Lorentz frames
[9, 10].
There are two possibilities:
1. A Brownian random walk in which a single time variable determines both the
stopping times and the time between jumps.
2. A Brownian random walk in which two independent time variables are used,
the stopping times and the the proper time difference between two consecutive
stopping times.
As each time increment ξi is a proper time (recall the local time of the rest
frame is equivalent to the proper time) it remains invariant in general relativity under
coordinate transformations, which also includes the laboratory frame. This is the
only information transmitted from frame to frame. Moreover as the heat bath is held
at a constant temperature, then it is reasonable to assume using the strong Markov
property that the set {ξi}∞
i=1 defines a set of stationary independent increments. This
may not be reasonable in general relativity, since the density of the kicks may be
affected by the gravitational field. For example, in the case of the Schwarzschild
metric, one might expect that for a closed system in equilibrium the Brownian kicks
would have the same intensity on the hypersurface given by τ = h(t, θ, φ) where h
is a given function and τ is constant [1].
The random four-vector X indexed by the stopping times between two impulsive
events representing the increments via the Lorentz invariant inner product is s2

In the case of isotropy for the positions(X, Y, Z) and for the velocities(Vx , Vy , V z)

z < c2 it is assumed E(X) = E(Y ) = E(Z) = 0 and E(Vx ) =
E(Vy ) = E(Vz) = 0, where E denotes expected value.
The time elapsed between two impulsive events will be positive with meanμT > 0
if the future events are considered. It may be assumed μT = 0—there is no loss of
generality due to this assumption since μT = 0 just implies a translation along the
time axis. Further a positive standard deviation σcT > 0 and σ=σY = σZ = σ > 0
is assumed where the equalities are due to the assumed isotropy (the isotropy con￾dition can be easily relaxed, allowing different standard deviations for the different
directions of space), and thus

where the operator within square brackets is the Laplacian in the Minkowski space,
and the variable n is considered as a continuous variable representing the flow of
time.
Another fundamental difficulty in formulating a covariant theory of the Brow￾nian motion lies in the form of the correlation function of the random variables
of spacetime. The straightforward generalization of the usual Brownian correlation
property to the special relativity is impossible. The Brownian motion in spacetime
should be a generalization of the non-relativistic problem, constructed by observing
the non-relativistic process from a moving frame according to the transformation
laws of the special relativity. The process taking place in space in the non-relativistic
theory should be replaced by a spacetime process in which the Brownian jumps are
spacelike.
One of the difficulties in describing the Brownian motion in spacetime is the
possible occurrence of a negative value for the second moment of some component
of the Lorentz four-vector random variable. If the Brownian jump is timelike, or
spacelike, the components of the four-vector are not independent, but must satisfy
the timelike or spacelike constraint [9].
Koide and Kodama [12] studied the Brownian motion of a relativistic particle
deriving the stochastic differential equation (SDE) on the base of the Langevin equa￾tion. The authors listed two difficulties of the relativistic generalization of the Brow￾nian motion:
• Non-uniqueness of the discretization of the Langevin equation due to the nature
of the multiplicative noise of the covariant Langevin equation for a relativistic
particle;
• The transformation property of the noise—usually the force term and the noise
term are assumed to be independent Lorentz vectors.

) and D(p0
) are the Lorentz scalar
functions that characterize the relaxation of the momentum and the strength of the
noise, and the index 
 denotes the variables in the rest frame of the heat bath. The
Langevin equations describe the Markov processes in the relativistic one-particle
phase space. Debbasch et al. [13] probably were the first to propose the relativistic
Langevin equations as models for the relativistic Brownian motions.
One has two options dealing with the Langevin equations [7]:
• One can postulate the Langevin equations as the phenomenological model equa￾tions. In this case the parameters and the explicit functional form of the friction
and the noise amplitude functions have to be determined from the experimental
data [14].
• One can try to derive the Langevin equations from the microscopic models. If
successful, this approach yields the explicit expressions for the friction and noise
functions in terms of the microscopic model parameters.
The Gaussian white noise F(t) present in the Langevin equations has the following
correlation properties:

where  0 denotes the stochastic average in the rest frame of the heat bath.
Dunkel and Hänggi [15] derived the Langevin equation for the one-dimensional
relativistic Brownian motion from a microscopic collision model that assumes that
a heavy pointlike Brownian particle (with mass M) interacts with the lighter heat
bath particles (with mass m 	 M) via the elastic hard-core collisions. Because of
the frequent elastic collisions with the heat bath particles, the Brownian particle
performs the stochastic motions.
The authors noted that while the non-relativistic LEs can be derived by considering
a bath of the harmonic oscillators with the canonical phase space distribution, it is
problematic to directly transfer this approach to the relativistic case, because any
instantaneous linear or nonlinear interactions between the Brownian particle and the
heat bath particles would violate the basic principles of special relativity.
To circumvent this problem, Dunkel and Hänggi pursued a different method, using
only the non-relativistic microscopic conservation laws for energy and momentum
known to hold for the elastic pointlike binary collisions (the contact interactions).
The coordinates and the momenta of the heat bath particles are xr ∈ (−L/2, L/2)
and pr ∈ (−∞,∞), where r = 1, 2,..., N. The probability density function of the
heat bath particles is the spatially homogeneous Maxwell distribution

It is implicitly assumed by the authors that the heat bath particles are identi￾cally distributed and the collisions with the Brownian particles do not alter the bath
distribution.
In the relativistic case it is also assumed that the heat bath distribution is stationary
and spatially homogeneous, so that the PDF can be written in the product form

One can identify the first term on the right-hand side as friction and introduce an
averaged friction coefficient, and the second term on the right-hand side is interpreted
as noise.
Dunkel and Hänggi [5] formulated the Langevin equations in the four-vector nota￾tion. The (1+3)-dimensional Minkowski metric tensor with respect to the Cartesian
coordinates is (gαβ) = (gαβ) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1), (gα
β ) = (gβ
α ) = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).
The covariant vector components xα can be calculated from the contravariant com￾ponents xα by virtue of xα = gαβ xα, which, in particular, means that for Cartesian
coordinates x0 = −x 0 and xi = xi hold.
If in a certain inertial coordinate system  a Brownian particle has the three￾velocity v(t) ≡ dx(t)/dt, then the differential dτ of its proper time is defined by294 12 Relativistic Brownian Motion

Let a Brownian particle has the rest mass m, the proper time τ and four-velocity
uβ (τ ), i.e. the four-momentum of the particle is pαmuα, where uαuα = −c2. It is
assumed that the particle is surrounded by an isotropic, homogeneous heat bath with
constant four-velocity Uβ and subjected to an external four-force Kα(x ν , pμ), such
as, for example, the Lorentz force. Then the relativistic Langevin equations of motion
are written as
dxα(τ ) = pα

d pα(τ ) = 

The friction tensor να

να
β = ν

gα
β + uαuβ
c2

with ν denoting the scalar viscous friction coefficient measured in the rest frame of
the particle.
The friction tensor has the same structure as the pressure tensor for an ideal fluid.
In particular, this means that in each instantaneous rest 
 frame of the particle,
where temporarily uα

 = (c, 0) holds, the tensor reduces to the diagonal form

This form of the friction tensor reflects the simplifying assumptions that the heat
bath can be considered as isotropic and homogeneous.

Koide and Kodama considered the reference frame that is moving with the velocity
V (MF) with respect to the rest frame of the heat bath. The four-momentum d pμ
in this frame is given by the Lorentz transformation of d p
μ as d pμ = (d pμ)d pμ.
The authors assumed that the stochastic part of the Brownian motion preserves the
property of the Gauss white noise

tmV = dtδi j δlm
where  0 denotes the stochastic average in the moving frame and that the noise term
is isolatedly Lorentz invariant.296 12 Relativistic Brownian Motion
The authors found that the Lorentz transformation entangles with the integration
scheme and the noise term itself is not covariant but constitutes the Lorentz vector
together with the force term. Thus, the force part and the stochastic part are mixed.
Fa [21] analysed the behaviours of the second moment of momentum in terms
of the temperature, for the stationary solutions. For the non-stationary solutions, the
second moment is difficult to be obtained analytically, and the author investigates
some more complicated averages of the momentum.

Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
The theoretical description of dilute non-equilibrium systems is based on the so￾called one-particle distribution function. All macroscopic properties of a dilute non￾equilibrium system can be expressed in terms of this function that can be determined
by solving a transport equation that describes the behaviour of the non-equilibrium
system. The most famous such equation is the non-relativistic equation derived by
Ludwig Boltzmann at the end of the nineteenth century. In the forties, Lichnerowich
and Marrot generalized this equation to the special relativity [1]. Israel [2] was one
of the first to calculate relativistic transport coefficients on the basis of this equation.
He also was one of the first authors that wrote down a general relativistic version of
the Boltzmann equation [3].
According to the classical, non-relativistic definition of the one-particle position￾momentum distribution function f (t, xi
, pi
) is a function of the time t, a position
vector xi ≡ x 1, x 2, x 3 and a momentum vector pi ≡ p1, p2, p3. The combination
f (t, xi
, pi
)3x3 p yields the average number of particles which will be found in
a small but finite volume element 3x around the point xi with momenta in a small
but finite volume element 3 p around pi
. The spatial volume elements 3x are
supposed to be large enough to contain many particles, but small enough in order
to make it possible to treat the distribution function as a constant all over these
volume elements. The one-particle position-momentum distribution function could
be written as

, t) =

This expression is valid also in special relativity [4].
The first results on the one-particle distribution function in the relativistic kinetic
theory were obtained by Jüttner [5] who derived an equilibrium distribution func￾tion for a relativistic gas (1911) which in the non-relativistic limit becomes the

Maxwellian distribution function and later the relativistic Bose–Einstein and Fermi–
Dirac distribution functions (1928).
This Boltzmann equation gives the rate of change of the distribution function in
time and space due to the particle interactions under several assumptions:
• Only binary collision are considered.
• The spatiotemporal changes of distribution function on microscopic scales are
negligible.
• The assumption of molecular chaos (i.e. no correlations exist between the colliding
particles, and the average number of binary collisions is proportional to the product
of their distribution function) [6].
The relativistic Boltzmann equation was used to study irreversible processes in
relativistic gases employing either the Chapman–Enskog method or the Maxwell–
Grad moment method to solve the kinetic equation; these methods were used as
a means to obtain or justify a macroscopic theory of irreversible processes in the
relativistic framework [7].
Jüttner used an entropy minimization procedure by postulating that, for a suffi￾ciently large particle number, the one-particle equilibrium distribution in the phase
space should be a maximizer of the Boltzmann–Gibbs–Shannon (BGS) entropy [8].

is the modified Bessel function of second kind and the relativistic parameter ζ =

This top-down (macro-to-micro) derivation of the equilibrium distribution for rel￾ativistic particles was also used by other researches [11, 12]. The conclusive evidence
for the original form proposed by Jüttner has been brought by numerical simulations
of the relativistic molecular dynamics in the one, two and three dimensions [13, 14].
In the relativistic kinetic theory there is no unique differential cross section which
tends in the non-relativistic limiting case to the one which is proportional to the
relative velocity, known as the differential cross section of the Maxwellian particles
[15].
Hsiao and Yu [16] proved the asymptotic stability of the relativistic Maxwellian
and Glassey [17]—the existence of the global solutions of the Cauchy problem for
the relativistic Boltzmann equation with near-vacuum data.
As in the non-relativistic case, the relativistic Boltzmann equation describes the
evolution of the one-particle distribution function of an ideal non-degenerate gas (i.e.13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation 301
a gas where quantum effects are not taken into account) f (xμ, pμ) = f (x, p, t) in
the phase space spanned by the space–time coordinates xμ = (x 0 = ct, x) and the
momentum four-vectors pμ = (p0, p) of the particles.
The distribution function is such that

dx 2
dx 3
d p1
d p2
d p3
gives at time t the number of particles in the volume element d3x about x with
momenta in the range d3 p about p.
Due to the mass-shell condition [18, 19] p2 + m2 = 0 one can write [20]
p0 = (p0 − g0i pi
)/g00, p0 =

g00m2c2 + (g0i g0 j − g00gi j)pi p j
where gμν are the components of the metric tensor.
The relativistic Boltzmann equation is written as [21, 22]
pμ ∂ f
∂xμ − i
μν pμ pν ∂ f
∂pμ = Q (13.3)
where Q is the collision term, which depends on the product of the distribution
functions of two particles, and i
μν are the Christofell symbols. In the absence of
the gravitational fields the Christofell symbols vanish and Eq. (13.12) reduces to the
Boltzmann equation in the Minkowski space [20]. The main difference between the
relativistic and non-relativistic BE lies in the collision term and the coupled equations.
In the relativistic BE, the collision integrals are usually much more complicated than
those in the non-relativistic case.
There is a difficulty related to the nature of the time. The covariant relativistic
Boltzmann equation describes the evolution of a system of particles in the spacetime
evolving with the universal invariant parameter τ . The observed time t of Einstein
and Maxwell, in the presence of interaction, is not necessarily a monotonic function
of τ . If t(τ ) increases with t, the worldline may be associated with a normal particle,
but if it is decreasing in t, it is observed in the laboratory as an antiparticle [23].
The flow of an ensemble of the particles governed by the Boltzmann equation
obeys the usual H-theorem implying a non-decreasing entropy in the usual definition
of the time τ as well as in the invariant world time t, provided that there are no
antiparticles involved. Tayler and Weinberg [24] and Chernikov [25] proved the
H-theorem for the relativistic Boltzmann equation.
If the antiparticles occur as part of a pair annihilation process, one may observe that
the entropy flow of the antiparticle part of the system may have decreasing entropy in
τ and the generally expected increase of the entropy may not be universally observed.
Sarbach and Zannias [26] developed the relativistic kinetic theory of gases using
the Hamiltonian structure of the theory.
Synge [9] introduced the notion of the world lines of gas particles as the most
fundamental ingredient for the covariant formulation of relativistic kinetic theory.302 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
Synge’s idea led naturally to the notion of the invariant distribution function and a
statistical description of a relativistic gas which is fully relativistic.
The authors [26] used the ideas of Synge and Euler [27] and denoted (M, g) the
C∞-differentiable Lorentzian manifold of dimension n = 1 + d, X and
(N) denote
the class of C∞ vector and k-form fields on a differentiable manifold N, while X
and LX denote the interior product and the Lie derivative with respect to the vector
field X.
Sarbach and Zannias considered a simple gas—a collection of neutral or charged,
spinless classical particles of the same rest mass moving in a time-oriented spacetime
(M, g). From the tangent bundle point of view, the gas particles follow segments of
integral curves of the Liouville vector field L. All gas particles have the same rest
mass; thus these segments are restricted to a subset m of MT (defined as the vector
space of all tangent vectors p at some event x ∈ M—the tangent bundle of M)
referred to as the mass shell. m is defined as
m := H−1

−m2
2
	
= 
(x, p) ∈ T M : 2 H(x, p) = gx (p, p) = −m2
where H : T M → R is the Hamiltonian defined as (x, p) → gx (p, p) and gx is the
Poincaré or the Liouville one-form induced by the spacetime metric g [26].
The central assumption of relativistic kinetic theory is that the averaged properties
of the gas are described by a one-particle distribution function that is defined as a
non-negative function f : G+
m → R on the future mass shell. For the collisionless
gas the distribution function f must obey the Liouville equation (Vlasov equation)
LL( f ) = 0 where
(LL f )(x, p) = pμ ∂ f (x, p)
∂xμ − μ
αβ pα pβ ∂ f (x, p)
∂pμ .
Similar to the Liouville equation, the central ingredient of the Boltzmann equation
is again the one-particle distribution function. However, the collisions between the
gas particles can no longer be neglected. The Liouville equation is replaced by the
Boltzmann equation which has the following form

where the natural volume is


m2 + δi j pi p j
,13.1 General Relativistic Boltzmann Equation 303
and W(p3 + p4 → p + p2) is the transition probability scalar that obeys the follow￾ing symmetries:
W(p3 + p4 → p + p2) = W(p4 + p3 → p2 + p),
W(p + p2 → p3 + p4) = W(p3 + p4 → p + p2).
The second symmetry expresses microscopic reversibility — the principle of detailed
balance [2].
The relativistic Boltzmann equation is used, for example, to study the processes
in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which collide two accelerated nuclei to create
a hot and dense deconfined nuclear matter, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).
However, the full solution of the relativistic BE is challenging both analytically and
numerically due to the complexity of the collision integral and high dimensions
[28, 29]. Even in the today’s pentascale clusters, the BE still presents a substantial
computational challenge.
Still, Zhang et al. [30] recently reported development of the numerical framework
for a full solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equations to study the problem of
the early thermalization [31] of the quark-gluon matter using the multiple GPUs on
distributed clusters [32].
13.1 General Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
In the case of the relativistic fluid dynamics the formulation is possible that is covari￾ant with respect to the Poincaré (inhomogeneous Lorentz) transformations in the
Minkowski (special relativistic) spacetime, or general coordinate transformations in
the Einstein (general relativistic) space–time [33–36]. The velocity three-vector of
the non-relativistic case is modified to a four-vector in spacetime, tangent to a fluid
element’s worldline.
The thermodynamic state variables are the scalar fields defined in a “comov￾ing frame” riding along with a fluid element. The spatial particle flux of the non￾relativistic formulation is modified to a particle number four-vector whose spacetime
four-divergence expresses conservation of the particles. The non-relativistic stress
tensor expressing three-momentum flux is generalized to a stress-energy tensor in
spacetime whose four-divergence expresses the local conservation of the energy–
momentum.
Minkowski spacetime M is a flat pseudo-Riemann manifold, adding to its affine
structure an indefinite non-degenerate bilinear form—the Minkowski metric g that
defines a scalar product g(a, b) = g(b, a) of two vectors a and b. The metric is called
indefinite because the scalar product of a vector with itself need not be positive: a
vector a is spacelike if g(a, a) > 0, timelike if g(a, a) < 0 and null if g(a, a) = 0.
The Minkowski metric g is304 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation

The metric provides a duality between vectors and linear forms, which allows the

In the general relativity there are two possible generalizations of the one-particle
distribution function— f (t, xi
, pi
) and f(t, xi
, pi), both of which are general rela￾tivistic scalars [4]. Here a lower asterisk indicates that covariant momentum compo￾nents are used as variables rather than contravariant ones.
The distribution function f (t, xi
, pi
) depends on variables that are directly mea￾surable, just as in special relativity, namely the time-position (t, xi and the contravari￾ant momentum pi
. In general relativity, however, this choice of variables leads to an
undesirable definition of f

It contains, next to the usual Dirac delta functions in the position and three-momentum
space, the factors containing the energy and the determinant of the metric.
The distribution function f(t, xi
, pi) contains covariant momentum variables
that depend on the metric via pi = giμ(t, xi
)pμ and, therefore, are not directly mea￾surable.
However, the definition of the distribution function f(t, xi
, pi) in terms of
Dirac delta functions (13.1) is simpler than the corresponding definition (13.4) for
f (t, xi
, pi
): there are no extra factors like the energy or the determinant of the met￾ric. As a consequence, the Boltzmann equation for f takes a simpler form than the
Boltzmann equation for f .

right-hand side is called the collision term; the streaming term does not have its usual
appearance: it contains the combination f with the function r instead of f only, as one
would expect [4].

where s is the energy variable: s = (p + q)μ(p + q)μ and θ is the scattering angle
in the centre of the mass system.306 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
The above equation was derived by Debbasch and van Leeuwen using the seven￾dimensional phase space. A typical point in this space has seven coordinates—the
four coordinates x 0 = ct, x 1, x 2, x 3 and the three momentum coordinates p1, p2, p3
on the mass shell gμν (x)pμ pμ = m2c2 (working on-shell restricts the four￾dimensional momentum space to a three-dimensional submanifold). In the next paper
[38] the authors used all four components of the four-momentum as a variables and
got what they called the “manifestly covariant” general relativistic Boltzmann equa￾tion.
In order to rewrite the Boltzmann equation in a general covariant form the authors
introduced a function F(t, xi
, p0, pi) such that
f(t, xi
, pi) =

∞
−∞
F(t, xi
, p0, pi)δ(p0 − p0(t, xi
, pi))d p0.
If the variable p0 equals p0(t, xi
, pi) this function coincides with the one-particle
distribution function f(t, xi
, pi) and, thus, on the mass shell, F(t, xi
, p0, pi) and
f(t, xi
, pi) may be interchanged, i.e., f(t, xi
, pi) is the restriction of a function
F(t, xi
, p0, pi) to the mass shell, or F(t, xi
, p0, pi) is an off-shell extension of
f(t, xi
, pi).
The seven derivatives with respect to time t, space xi and three-momentum pi in
the streaming term for f have to be transformed to the eight derivatives of F with
respect to the four-vector space–time xμ and the four-momentum pμ.

(13.7)
governing the distribution functions f (t, x, p) depends on the choices of spacetime
and momentum space coordinates. The curvilinear spatial coordinates and rotating
reference frames respectively would induce “fictitious” and Coriolis force contribu￾tions to F. One may wish to reckon the components of x and p and p with respect to
two different reference frames in relative motion; this further complicates the left￾hand side with momentum-(component)-changing contributions to F, associated
for instance for the angular aberrations and the Doppler shifts. Sometimes called
“observer corrections”, these terms involve the relative velocity of the two frames
and—in the case of accelerated relative motion—its gradients [41, 42].
Lindquist [43] introduced distinct coordinate systems for spacetime and momen￾tum space in the context of general relativity, through use of an orthonormal basis
or “tetrad”. Given a spacetime metric in a coordinate basis (also called a “natural”
or “holonomic” basis), an orthonormal basis can be chosen at each spacetime point,
in terms of which the metric locally takes the Minkowski form. Lindquist wrote the
general relativistic Boltzmann equation in terms of such an orthonormal basis. He
then re-expressed all time and space derivatives in Eq. (13.7) as well as the metric and
tetrad derivatives entering F—in terms of the original coordinate basis. However, all
momentum components and the momentum space gradient were left in terms of the
orthonormal basis. Thus the independent variables were the spacetime position com￾ponents in the coordinate basis and the momentum components in the orthonormal
basis.308 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
An advantage of an orthonormal basis in momentum space is that, as a local
Minkowski frame, it facilitates direct importation of flat-space results for particle
interaction rates into the collision integral. Lindquist also noted that the “tangent
bundle” (spacetime plus the tangent space at every point of spacetime) is a natu￾ral way to conceptualize phase space in general relativity; in this context, in which
momentum space is identified with the (flat) tangent space at each spacetime point,
an orthonormal basis for momentum space also seems natural. The introduction of a
second coordinate system allows simultaneous exploitation of the differing symme￾tries of the spacetime and the associated momentum space (e.g. spherical symmetry
in position space, vs. axial symmetry about the radial direction in momentum space).
Cardall et al. [39] rewrote the left-hand side of Eq. (13.7) to obtain the conser￾vative formulation as a phase space divergence—i.e., as the sum of spacetime and
momentum space divergences. Conservative formulations are benefit to the numer￾ical simulations allowing to maintain fulfilment of the global conservation laws at
modest resolution by transparently relating volume integrals to surface integrals.
The general relativistic Boltzmann equation [3, 43] equates the directional deriva￾tive of the distribution function along the phase flow to a collision integral:
d f
dλ = C[ f ]. (13.8)
That is, the change in f along a phase space trajectory with affine parameter λ
is equal to the phase space density C[ f ] of pointlike collisions that add or remove
particles from the trajectory. The phase space measure is defined in such a way that
f and C[ f ] are both invariant scalars.
For practical computations it is necessary to introduce phase space coordinates—
they could be the spacetime position coordinates xμˆ and the momentum space
coordinates pˆi measured in an orthonormal frame comoving with the fluid. The
components in the comoving frame are denoted with hatted indices, and only the
spatial momentum components are considered as independent variables, due to the
mass-shell relation m2 = −pμˆ pμˆ = −ημˆ νˆ pμˆ pνˆ where m is the particle mass and
(ημˆ νˆ) = diag[−1, 1, 1, 1] is the Minkowski metric tensor. In terms of these phase
space coordinates the Boltzmann equation becomes

When the spacetime is curved, and/or the curvilinear laboratory frame spacetime
coordinates are used, and/or the comoving frame undergoes the accelerated motion,
the comoving frame connection coefficients ˆi
νˆμˆ do not vanish, despite the fact that
the metric is ημˆ νˆ in an orthonormal frame. This is because the metric can be brought
into the Minkowski form only locally, with a transformation that varies from point
to point in the spacetime.
The independent variables other than the orthonormal comoving frame compo￾nents xμˆ and pˆi are needed. A global coordinate basis for the spacetime position
typically is used for the numerical simulation, often an Eulerian one when the parti￾cle transport is coupled to multidimensional hydrodynamics.
Given a laboratory frame coordinate basis (denoted by unadorned indices) in
which the metric components are gμν , the coordinate transformation Lμ
μˆ to the comov￾ing frame is such that
Lμ
μˆ Lν
νˆ gμν = ημˆ νˆ .
Since the comoving frame components of the fluid four-velocity are uμˆ =
(u0, ui
)T = (1, 0, 0, 0)T , the transformation Lμ
μˆ will indeed be to the comoving frame
provided Lμ
μˆ uμˆ = uμ.
In the laboratory frame coordinate basis, the connection coefficients are torsion￾free (symmetric in the lower indices) and are determined in terms of the metric and
expressed as [39]

13.2 Particles in External Electromagnetic Fields
Kremer [20] exploited the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time
approximation to study the transport processes in the two cases:
• the electrons and the photons subjected to the external electromagnetic fields in
the special relativity;
• the relativistic gas under the influence of the Schwarzschild metric.
For a mixture of ideal gases of r components in the electromagnetic fields, the
Boltzmann equation for the α component is
pμ
α
∂ fα
∂xμ − qα
c Fμν ∂ fα
∂pμ
α
= Qα (13.12)
where Qα is the collision term, q is the particle’s charge, and Fμν is the electromag￾netic field tensor.
Kremer used the relaxation time model equation suggested by Anderson and Wit￾ting [44] that replaces the collision term by the simpler expression Qα ∝ ( f − f eq)
where the equilibrium function f eq can be either the Fermi–Dirac, the Maxwell–
Jüttner or the Bose–Einstein distribution [45] and use the Landau and Lifshitz
decomposition [46] of the particle four-flows and the energy–momentum tensors.
The following quantities are used: the particle number density nα, the diffusion flux
Jα, the hydrostatic pressure pα, the heat flux qα, the energy εα and the enthalpy
hα = εα + pα/nα.
For a binary mixture of electrons and protons the heat flux of the mixture is
[20, 47]
qμ = qμ
e + (he − hp)Jμ
e = qμ
e + he Jμ
e
since the partial heat flux of the protons is negligible in comparison with the partial
heat flux of the electrons.
To derive the Fourier and the Ohm laws the thermodynamic forces that appear in
the deviation from the equilibrium distribution function which are the four-vectors
are defined as312 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation

where ∇μ ≡ Uμ∂μ and decompose the thermodynamic forces into parts parallel,
perpendicular and transverse to the magnetic flux induction.
The authors determined the all components of the electric and thermal conductivity
for the cases of (1) a non-relativistic mixture of protons and non-degenerate electrons
and (2) an ultrarelativistic (mec2/kT  1) mixture of non-degenerate electrons and
photons.
Garcia-Perciante et al. [48] investigated the relativistic heat flux for a single￾component charged fluid in the presence of an electromagnetic field.
When the thermal agitation in a gas is high enough, such that relativistic effects
become relevant, heat dissipation is driven not solely by a temperature gradient but
also by other forces [47]. In the case of relativistic charged fluids, a heat flux is driven
by an electrostatic field even in the single species case. The present work generalizes
such result by considering also a magnetic field in an arbitrary inertial reference
frame.
The external force is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic field tensor Fαν
that has the antisymmetry properties [47]:
∂
∂vα (Fανvν ) = Fαν ∂vν
∂vα = Fαν δνα = 0.
In this case the Boltzmann equation is written as
vα

∂vα = J ( f, f 

The authors used an approach similar to [49], multiplied both sides of Eq. (13.13)
by a collisional invariant ψ(vμ) and integrate over velocity space to get

velocity and position variables in the phase space has been used, and dv = γ −1 w d3v
is the invariant volume element [50]. The authors further obtained

is

For the momentum–energy invariant ψ(vβ) = mvβ the following balance equa￾tion is obtained:

αβ is the Navier’s viscous tensor, and hαβ is the spatial projector
hαβ = ηαβ +
UαUβ

The right-hand side of Eq. (13.15) can be expressed as the four-divergence of the
electromagnetic stress tensor Mαβ , and thus the energy–momentum conservation
equation for the single charged fluid can be written as
∂
∂xα (T βα + Mαβ) = 0.
Garcia-Perciante et al. [48] used the relaxation time approximation J ( f, f 

The heat flux is the transport of internal energy arising from the chaotic motion
of the molecules which is a quantity characteristic of the comoving frame in which
all mechanical effects are absent. It can be constructed as a tensor quantity and can
thus be calculated in any arbitrary frame [49]. The expression314 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation

Kn() is the nth order modified Bessel function of the second kind.
The heat flux for a single-component charged fluid in the special relativistic regime
features a contribution due to the electromagnetic force q FμνUν . This effect is
purely relativistic. Thus, the constitutive equation obtained by the authors shows that
both electric (Benedicks effect) and magnetic forces contribute to dissipation in the
relativistic flow.

Thus the heat flux has the usual term proportional to the gradient of temperature
and two relativistic terms, the first one proportional to an acceleration and the second
one to the gravitational potential gradient.
Note that the coefficient of thermal conductivity in the presence of a gravitational
field decreases with the increase of the gravitational potential through the ratio ||/c2.
13.4 Grad’s Moment Method
A relativistic mixture of r components is characterized by the moments of the dis￾tribution function: the particle four-flows, the energy–momentum tensors and the
third-order moment tensors. By using the Eckart’s decomposition and introducing
(13r + 1) scalar fields—related with the four-velocity, the temperature of the mix-316 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
ture, the particle number densities, the diffusion fluxes, the non-equilibrium pres￾sures, the heat fluxes and the pressure deviatoric tensors—the Grad’s distribution
functions are obtained [15].
Grad’s distribution functions are used to determine the third-order tensors, and
their production terms for the mixtures whose component’s rest masses are not too
disparate, so that it follows a system of (13r + 1) scalar field equations.
The particles of component a = 1,...,r have rest mass ma and are characterized
by the space–time coordinates xα = (ct, x) and momenta pα
a = (p0
a, pa). The length
of the momentum four-vector is p0
a = 
| pa|
2 + mac2.
For a binary mixture the authors used 21 scalar equations to determine the constitu￾tive equations for the non-equilibrium pressures, diffusion fluxes, pressure deviatoric
tensors and heat fluxes. Hence the Navier–Stokes and generalized Fourier and Fick
laws were obtained.
The one-particle distribution function of the component satisfies the Boltzmann
equation, which in the absence of the external fields is written as [21, 37]

a paα paβ )
where f0 is the Jüttner function (13.2) and the tensorial coefficients are to be deter￾mined from the definitions of the partial particle four-flow and the partial energy–
momentum tensor.
The heat flux of the mixture is a sum of the partial heat fluxes and a term which
represents the transport of the heat due to diffusion

where hα is the enthalpy.
Kremer and Marques presented the rather cumbersome balance equations for the
partial heat fluxes [15].
The authors also considered a simplified system—a binary mixture characterized
by the six scalar fields of the particle number densities n1, n2, the four-velocity Uα
(that has only three independent components) and the temperature T . The equations
for the partial heat fluxes are written as
qα

Méndez and García-Perciante [50, 54] used the Chapman–Enskog (CE) expansion to

vα fα = J ( f, f 

where vα = γ (w, c) is the molecular four-velocity, γ (w) = (1 − w2/c2)−1/2 is the

with the thermal conductivity predictions by the first approximation of the CE expan￾sion. It should be, however, noted that CE approximations of higher order could lead
to the unstable equations [56].320 13 Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
13.5.1 Anderson–Witting Transport Coefficients in General
Relativity
Ambrus [57] used the Chapman–Enskog procedure to derive expressions for the
transport coefficients when the Anderson–Witting approximation for the collision
term in the relativistic Boltzmann equation is employed.
The Boltzmann equation can be written in conservative form with respect to a
tetrad field e

= J [ f ],
where hatted indices denote tetrad components, pαˆ represents the particle four￾momentum vector, f is the one-particle distribution function, and J [ f ] represents
the collision integral.
The Anderson–Witting approximation in the Landau frame is written as [44]
JAW [ f ] = puL
τ
( f − f
eq
L ),
where τ is the relaxation time. The equilibrium distribution function f
eq
L is defined
in terms of quantities expressed with respect to the Landau frame:
f
eq
L = nL

.
Here m is the particle mass, ζL ≡ m/tL, K(ζL) is the modified Bessel functions of
the third kind, pL is the hydrostatic pressure, and the Landau energy EL and Landau
temperature TL are linked through EL = nLmG(ζL) − pL. In order to perform the Chapman–Enskog expansion the author considered
δ f = f − f
eq
L and τ to be small. Thus, the deviation δ f from equilibrium can be
approximated by keeping only the zeroth-order f = f
eq
L on the left-hand side to get

Variational Models
14.1 Márkus and Gambár Model
Márkus and Gambár [1, 2] applied the Hamiltonian description of dissipative trans￾port processes to study the thermal propagation. The least action principle (Hamilton
principle) states that there exists a Lagrange density function L such that the calcu￾lated action S =  Ld3xdt is extremal for the real physical process [3, 4].
The authors defined the Lagrange functions for both the Lorentz invariant heat
propagation Lw [5] and classical (Fourier) heat conduction Lc that in the one￾dimensional case are written as

Equation (14.3) is the Klein–Gordon-type equation with the negative term (c2c2

[2], Eq. (14.4) is just the Fourier law.
The dispersion equations for these equations are written as
ω(k) = ck
1 − c2
4κ2k2 , ω(k) = −iκk2
where κ = λ/cV is the diffusivity.
Thus the phase velocity for the Klein–Gordon equation is

covers both the wavelike. Evidently,
lim
c→∞ vg = −i2κk
thus the Lorentz invariant description covers both the wavelike (non-dissipative) and
the Fourier-type (dissipative) heat propagation with the transition at the critical wave

The real part of the phase velocity is

Márkus and Gambár [5] stated that quantization of the thermal field generates
quasi particles with the mass M0 = /2κ where  is the Planck constant and the
equation (14.1) could be re-written (in the Planck units c = 1,  = 1) as

The authors calculated the Wheeler propagator that is a half sum of the retarded
and advanced propagators, using the Bochner’s theorem [6, 7] and performing the
integration using the path above the poles for the retarded and below the poles for
the advanced propagators.
14.2 Multifluid Model
Andersson et al. [8, 9] based their analysis of the relativistic heat transfer on the
convective variational formulation developed by Carter [10, 11]. The advantage of
the variational approach is that once the Lagrangian (“master function” [9]) is known,
the theory provides the relation between the various currents and their conjugate
momenta [12]. The model Andersson et al. developed for the relativistic heat transfer
is formally equivalent to the model for superfluid helium [13] and superfluid motion in
the neutron star cores [14, 15]. Another key advantage of the variational derivation
is that incorporating additional fluid components is straightforward. For example,
the helium model could be extended to include the thermal conductivity due to the
interaction between rotons and phonon that is essential at higher temperatures [16].
In Carter’s model for the heat problem, one considers two fluxes, one corre￾sponding to the matter flux and one which is associated with the entropy. These two
currents are the fundamental fields appearing in the matter sector of the Einstein–14.2 Multifluid Model 329
Hilbert action. The Lagrangian of the theory is a relativistic invariant, and hence it
should depend only on covariant combinations of the two fluxes, which includes the
relative flow between them.
This encodes the so-called entrainment effect, which tilts the momenta with
respect to the currents when two or more fluids are coupled, and which turns out
to be the crucial feature of the multifluid approach to the relativistic heat conduc￾tion [17]. The entropy current is in general not aligned with the particle flux. The
misalignment is associated with the heat flux and leads to entropy production [9].
In Carter’s original work the aim was to keep the model as simple as possible by
imposing restrictions on the way that the currents interact, thus Carter ignored the
entrainment. This omission resulted in a truncated model with severe stability issues
[18]. Thus it was assumed that Carter’s approach does not provide a viable alternative
to the Israel–Stewart model. However, a detailed comparison of the two formalisms
by Priou [19] showed that, at second order in the deviation from equilibrium, the full
(entrained) variational approach is essentially equivalent to the Israel and Stewart
model.
For a generic two-fluid system the key point is the definition of a relativistic
invariant Lagrangian (master function) 	. Assuming that the system is isotropic, 	
should be a function of the different scalars that can be formed by the two fluxes—the
three scalars:
n2 = −nana, s2 = −sasa, j
2 = −nasa.
Thus the master function could be used as the density for the matter sector of the
Einstein–Hilbert action [9]

The conjugate momentum associated with each of the fluxes is defined as
μa = ∂	
∂na = gab(Bnnb + Anssb
), θa = ∂	
∂sa = gab(Bnsb + Ansnb
)
where the coefficients
Bn ≡ −2
∂	
∂n2 , Bs ≡ −2
∂	
∂s2 , Ans ≡ −∂	
∂ j 2 .
The conjugate momenta demonstrate the fundamental role of the master function.
An advantage of the variational approach is that these quantities are determined by the
form of the master function. Moreover, it is clear that the momenta are not generally
aligned with the respective currents due to the dependence of the master function on
the relative flux. In the case of superfluid neutron star cores, the entrainment arises
owing to the strong interaction and couples the neutron and proton fluxes [9]. In the
heat transfer problem, with matter and entropy, the entrainment is associated with
the thermal relaxation of the system. The energy–momentum tensor is obtained by
noting that the displacements of the conserved currents induce a variation in the
space–time metric and therefore the variations of the fluxes are constrained. The
energy–momentum is thus
T b
a = μanb + θasb + ψδb
a
where the generalized pressure
ψ = 	 − μana − θasa.
The four-velocity ua is introduced in the matter frame such that na = nua, where
uaua = −1 and the relative velocity wa. The entropy flux is written as sa = s(ua +
wa). An asterisk denotes the variables in the matter frame, the entropy is the observer
dependent quantity, s = γ s where redshift associated with the relative motion of
the two frames γ = (1 − w2)−1/2.
The thermal momentum is written as [9]
θa = (Bs
s + Ansn)ua + Bs
s
wa
from which the temperature measured in the matter frame follows as
−uaθa = θ  = Bs
s + Ansn.
This quantity can be interpreted as the effective mass of the entropy component.14.2 Multifluid Model 331
Using the orthogonal projection ⊥ab = gab + uaub the heat flux (the energy flow
relative to the matter) could be written as

For the enforcement of the second law of the thermodynamics the orthogonality
of the entropy force density with the matter flux is used with the expression of the
entropy via the heat flux

The second law is satisfied if the entropy production is a quadratic in the sources,
i.e.
s = q2

where λ is the thermal conductivity.
From these considerations the equation for the heat flux followed in the following
form

Equation (14.6) is the relativistic version of the Cattaneo equation. The entropy
entrainment is essential in the determination of the thermal relaxation time via the
coefficient Ans.
Andersson and Lopez-Monsalvo [20] investigated the wave propagation by the
analysis of the stability of the thermal equilibrium state where no heat flux qa =
0 and no matter acceleration u˙a = 0. The authors also assumed that there is no
shear, divergence or vorticity associated with the flow, i.e. ∇aua = 0 and ∇bua =
0, considered the plane-wave solutions exp(iωt + iki xi
) and introduced the phase332 14 Variational Models
velocity σ = ω/k. They found that the thermal relaxation time τ > 0 is essential for
the stability of the transverse waves.
In the analysis of the longitudinal waves, Andersson and Lopez-Monsalvo con￾sidered long- and short-wave limits.
For the long wavelength case (k → 0) the authors found two stable (I mσ > 0)
sound-wave modes and two diffusive—slowly and fast decaying—modes. As they
noted, the last solution decays so fast that it is difficult to observe it.
In the short-wave case (k → ∞) the dispersion relation transforms into quadratic
equation for σ2. The solution has modes with the phase velocity lesser and greater
than the adiabatic speed of sound cs: σ2
− ≤ c2
s ≥ σ+. The authors also proved that
σ2 < 1, i.e. all waves remain causal.

Relativistic Thermodynamics
García-Colína and Sandoval-Villalbazo [1] developed the relativistic irreversible
thermodynamics and derived the heat transport equation.
The authors noted that the first attempt to connect the first law of thermodynamics
with the standard energy–momentum tensor of the relativity made by Eckart [2]
encounters a problem in finding a heat density to combine it with the three-vector
associated with the flow of heat to form a four-vector. This is precisely the root of one
of the difficulties found today with the papers dealing with this subject and follow
Eckart, who proposed to construct a tensor which would include both the internal
energy and the flow of heat. However, this is against the tenets of the general theory
of relativity; the stress energy tensor includes only all forms of mechanical energy
[3]; heat cannot be incorporated into its structure. It should be noted that the Eckart’s
theory leads to results that violate causality and involve undesirable unstable modes.
García-Colína and Sandoval-Villalbazo derived an equation for the entropy bal￾ance using a representation in which the independent local variables are the number
of particles per unit of volume n, the four velocity uν and the internal energy per
particle ε. It is assumed that the fluid is isotropic and free from shearing stresses,
thus the mass-stress tensor is
T μ
ν = ρuμuν + ˜phμ
ν
where ρ is the mass density, p˜ = p + p
, p is the local hydrostatic pressure, p is
the diagonal part of the stress tensor, the spatial projector is

[Q] is a four-vector heat flux.
Total energy conservation is Jμ
[T ];μ = 0, the internal energy balance equation is
ε˙ =−˜pθ − Jμ

García-Colína and Sandoval-Villalbazo derived the entropy balance equation

Thus the entropy balance equation in general relativity using n and ε is identi￾cal in structure to the canonical classical equation. The entropy flow is simply the

Neglecting small terms such as θ 2 yields the hyperbolic-type equation for T

Causality is not violated, and no temperature perturbations can propagate with a
velocity larger than c. Moreover, these equations lead to an entropy production
σ = κT ;μT;μ

T
which is a non-negative quadratic form since the transport coefficients are known
to be positive. Therefore the obtained equation is in complete agreement with the
second law of thermodynamics.
The special-relativistic version of continuum thermodynamics (CT) is based on
• the conservation laws for the particle number and the energy–momentum tensor;
• the dissipation inequality and the Gibbs fundamental law.
Muschik and von Borzeszkowski [4] (see also [5, 6]) considered the incorporation
of the CT into the general relativity. To perform this task one has to formulate CT
on a curved space–time, i.e. to derive its general-covariant formulation—general￾covariant continuum thermodynamics (GCCT).
The authors considered the entropy production and other thermodynamic quan￾tities such as the entropy flux. They discussed the equilibrium conditions in gravi￾tational theories. In particular, thermodynamic implications of the non-symmetry of
the energy–momentum tensor and the related spin balance equations were studied.
The vanishing entropy production is a necessary condition to be satisfied in the
thermodynamic equilibrium. The authors wrote the entropy balance338 15 Relativistic Thermodynamics
Sk
;k = σ + φ, Sk = 1
c2 suk + sk (15.1)
where Sk is the entropy four-vector, σ is the entropy production, φ is the entropy
supply. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is taken into account by the demand
that the entropy production has to be non-negative at each event for arbitrary materials
σ ≥ 0.

The identity is valid for arbitrary values of λ and p [4]. In the local equilibrium
it simplifies to

σ = ∂λ

qk + λ

c2 u˙lql + σlkπkl
where πkl is the viscosity tensor.
The authors also considered the case of non-dissipative material that is charac￾terized by vanishing entropy production even in the case of non-equilibrium for
all space–times. Thus by definition all processes in non-dissipative materials are
reversible: qk

ndiss = 0.15 Relativistic Thermodynamics 339
The vanishing entropy production is necessary for equilibrium but is not sufficient
for it, i.e. additional equilibrium conditions are needed. The authors obtained the
sufficient and necessary equilibrium condition for arbitrary materials as

Faraoni et al. [7, 8] proposed a new approach to the thermodynamics of the scalar￾tensor gravity and its expansion toward the general relativity (GR).
There is a deep connection between thermodynamics and gravity, first noted in
the black hole thermodynamics, which produced an unexpected relation between the
entropy and horizon area for stationary black holes and the temperatures of black
hole and Rindler horizons. This connection is related to the research by Jacobson
[9] who obtained the Einstein field equation of GR as an equation of state using the
thermodynamical considerations.
Eling et al. [10] derived the field equation of the fourth-order metric gravity using
only thermodynamics—the modification of the GR, which contains an extra scalar
degree of freedom and corresponds to the dissipative non-equilibrium “thermody￾namics of gravitational theories–in which a “bulk viscosity of spacetime” was intro￾duced to explain the dissipation; the GR corresponds to a state of thermodynamic
equilibrium.

Thus the heat flux is proportional to the four-acceleration of the effective fluid
“elements” [7].

where Ra describes entropy generation due to dissipative processes; Eckart’s entropy

Quantum Transport
The lattice degrees of freedom in the mesoscopic structures that have dimensions
ranging from tens of nanometres up to micrometres behave in the non-classical way
(e.g. the phenomena analogous to those of electron transport have been observed,
such as quantized heat conduction, coherence and Anderson localization in heat
conduction [1], the phonons are confined to the suspended nanowires [2–4] that are
sometimes called quantum wires [5] or in the freestanding semiconductor quantum
wells [6] that could lead to changes in the phonon dispersion relation, e.g. in the reduc￾tion of the phonon group velocity [5, 7]), and the thermal conductance is quantized in
the universal units πk2
B T/6 at the low temperatures similar to the well-known 2e2/h
electronic conductance quantum or the phonon phenomena similar to the quantum
optical phenomena such as the squeezed phonon states1 are observed. Blencowe [8,
9] proposed to call the study of such phenomena mesoscopic physics.
Experimental study of the phonon behaviour in the mesoscopic structures is rather
difficult. First of all, fabrication of such structures is more complex than of the
electron quantum wells, wires, dots, etc. [8]: for the acoustic phonons, there are no
perfect thermal insulators; although the confined modes may exist in a heterostructure
consisting of layers of material with different elastic properties, there will always
be the unconfined bulk modes with the same energies, and thus one needs to use
the suspended structures that are physically separated from the substrate for most of
their extent. Moreover, the measurements are more difficult. Evidently, it is much
more difficult to fabricate suspended nanostructures integrated with the ultrasensitive
probes than it is to fabricate the conventional heterostructures.
Many models of the heat conduction in solids are based on the Boltzmann transport
equation treating the phonons and electrons as the classical particles. Moreover, the
scattering rates in the BTE are calculated under the assumption that the system is only
1 The quantum fluctuations of the phonon system can be dominant at low enough temperatures.
These states are important because they can achieve the lower quantum noise than the zero-point
fluctuations of the vacuum or the coherent states and can be considered as the generalized coherent
states [10].344 Part III: Quantum Transport
slightly perturbed from the equilibrium. The classical theory should be modified in
order to account for the quantum effects which are present in the collision processes.
The quantum effects play an important role in the thermal transport dealing with
atomic-scale structures or low temperatures or combination of the two. For example,
in the seminal theoretical work, Pendry presented, 40 years ago, the important obser￾vation that a ballistic channel for any type of a carrier can transport heat at the rate
given by the so-called quantum of thermal conductance [11].
In most solids at room temperature all of the phonon states in the Brillouin zone
are involved in the heat transport; most of the heat is carried by phonons with the
wave length of a few nanometres [12]. On this scale the wave interference becomes
important in the heat transport. The phonon interference could result in the phononic
band gaps and reduce the phonon group velocity. Confinement of the phonon waves2
along the radial direction could modify the phonon dispersion dependence because
of the interface of the waves reflected by the nanowire surface. In the superlattices
the phonon states significantly depend on the interference due to scattering from the
multiple layer boundaries [12].
The quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), also known as the Uehling–Uhlenbeck
equation, is the quantum mechanical modification of the Boltzmann equation, which
gives the non-equilibrium time evolution of a gas of quantum-mechanically inter￾acting particles. It was first formulated by L. W. Nordheim et al. in 1928 [13] E. A.
Uehling & George Uhlenbeck in 1933 [14]. A basic result on a quantum extension
of the original Boltzmann equation—only the collision term had to be changed to
take into account the quantum degeneracy of the particles—is the introduction of a
correction accounting for the effects of quantum statistics in the classical collision
[15].
The Boltzmann equation describes the one-particle distribution of a dilute gas,
whose self-interaction gives rise to the nonlinear form of the integro-differential equa￾tion. Frequently the quantum linear Boltzmann equation is considered that describes
the motion of a single test particle in an ambient medium, taken to be an ideal,
stationary and uniform background [16].
Although quantum mechanics is microscopically time-reversible, the quantum
Boltzmann equation gives irreversible behaviour because phase information is
discarded [17]—only the average occupation number of the quantum states is kept.
The solution of the quantum Boltzmann equation is therefore a good approximation
to the exact behaviour of the system on time scales short compared to the Poincaré
recurrence time (which is not a severe limitation since the Poincaré recurrence time
is very large even in small systems).
2 It is important to distinguish between the dimensionality of the system and the dimension￾ality/degree of confinement [19]. A bulk material is a 3D system and is unconfined. Semiconductor
superlattices and quantum well structures are examples of 2D systems because the phonons are
confined within a plane; however, the degree of confinement is 1D because phonons are restricted
along one direction. Similarly, 2D confinement occurs in nanowires and in carbon nanotubes, and
the highest degree of confinement occurs in quantum dots and nanoparticles where the propagation
is restricted in all three directions.Part III: Quantum Transport 345
QBE describes the behaviours of two kinds of dilute quantum gases: the Bose gas
and the Fermi gas [18]. The Bose gas is composed of bosons, which have an integer
value of spin and obey the Bose–Einstein statistics. The Fermi gas is composed of
fermions, which have half-integer spins and obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics.
It is possible to solve the quantum Boltzmann transport equation; however, there
is one more vector variable in the argument that makes the solution more complex
[12, 18, 20].
Numerically solving the Boltzmann kinetic equations with the small Knudsen
number is challenging due to the stiff nonlinear collision term. A class of asymptotic
preserving schemes based on penalizing the collision term by the Bhatnagar–Gross–
Krook-type operator. This method, however, encounters its own difficulty when
applied to the quantum Boltzmann equation. To define the quantum Maxwellian
(Bose–Einstein or Fermi–Dirac distribution) at each time step and every mesh point,
one has to invert a nonlinear equation that connects the macroscopic quantity fugacity
with density and internal energy. Setting a good initial guess for the iterative method
is troublesome in most cases because of the complexity of the quantum functions
(Bose–Einstein or Fermi–Dirac function).
Another problem is the choice of the boundary conditions to apply on the surface of
the system in order to connect it to the heat reservoir. In full generality (including the
p-space and x-space drift terms, which are often neglected) the equation is represented
analogously to the Boltzmann equation. Thus, the QBE is seldom solved [12].
An alternative method of investigation of the quantum transport processes is the
generalization of the random walks models. The simplest quantum analogues of
random walks are the discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) [21–23].
One step of the procedure can be presented as

ψ−(ti + t, xm)
ψ+(ti + t, xm)

 ψ−(ti, xm + x)

Landauer Approach
At the nanoscale, especially at the sub-Kelvin temperatures, the heat conduction
enters a quantum regime where the phonon exchange obeys the Landauer formalism.
In a one-dimensional quantum channel connecting two reservoirs, the heat current
is related to the probability for a phonon of being transmitted from one heat bath to
the other when they are kept at the different temperatures. The thermal conductance is
expressed in terms of the transmission coefficient (called “the degree of ballisticity”
by Pekola and Karimi [1]) T between the reservoirs [2–5]. The heat current from
one reservoir to the other could be realized by the flux of electrons [6, 7], photons
[8, 9] or phonons [10].
The ballistic thermal transport through the narrow dielectric channel connecting
the two reservoirs with temperatures T1 and T2 is similar to the electromagnetic
radiation between two blackbodies separated by a vacuum, and the heat fluxes could
be written (in the case of linear dispersion relation) as [11]

where ξP (ω)is the transmission coefficient of the polarization branch P that accounts
for both the scattering in the channel and the reflection from the junctions, ωP is the
cutoff frequency for the phonon mode P that is determined by the width of the
channel and the order of the phonon mode and, for example, for the channel of the
rectangular cross section with dimensions Lx and Ly for the mode (m, n) is

The net heat transfer is q12 = q1→2 − q2→1 and under the assumption that the

This value is considered as the universal limit of the phonon heat transport known
as the quantum of the thermal conductance for one channel [12]. The value of the
quantum of thermal conductance is universal independent of the characteristics of the
material [3]. Note that the quantum thermal conductance for the phonons (bosons)
differs the quantum thermal conductance for the electrons (fermions) by a factor equal
to the sum representing the number of current carrying modes in the conductor; the
ratio of the thermal and electrical conductances satisfies the Wiedemann–Franz law
g( f )
T /g( f ) = LT , where the Lorenz number is L = π2k2
B/3e2 [1].
Schwab et al. [10] were the first to demonstrate the quantized thermal conductance
experimentally. Their setup (the “phononcavity”) consists of silicon nitride mem￾brane suspended by four legs of equal thickness; each leg has catenoidal waveguide
shape. This waveguide shape as a 1D channel is the ideal profile to achieve unit
transmissivity between the suspended cavity and the bulk reservoir [13].
Their data exhibit the usual phononic thermal conductance ∝ t 3 at temperatures
above 1 K. Below this temperature there is a rather abrupt levelling off of gT to the
value 16gT0 . The authors argue that the coefficient 16 arises from the trivial factor 4
due to four independent bridges in the structure and the less trivial factor 4 due to
four possible acoustic vibration modes of each leg in the low temperature limit: one
longitudinal, one torsional, and two transverse modes.
Greiser et al. [14] reported the quantum thermal conductance of 16gT0 for the
silicon nitride membrane suspended by four narrow bridges each of which acts as a
channel with four phonon modes.
Jezouin et al. [6] measured the quantum-limited heat conductance of electrons in
a quantum point contact. A micrometre-sized metal plate is connected to both cold
phonon bath and to a big electronic reservoir via an adjustable number n of ballistic
quantum channels with both reservoirs at T0. By injecting Joule power to the metallic
plate, the electrons were heated up to temperature T which can be directly measured16 Landauer Approach 351
by a noise thermometer. This power is then transmitted via the quantum channels at
the rate nGT (T − T0) through two quantum point contacts and to the phonon bath.
Zen et al. [15] showed that conductance can be suppressed in two-dimensions by
patterning of the membranes into a nanostructured periodic phononic crystal.
The Landauer expression for the heat flux in a ballistic 1D nanowire between two
reservoirs is frequently written as [2–4, 16]
q = 
α
∞
0
dk
2π
ω(k)vα(k)[ηhot − ηcold ]Tα(k) (16.2)
where α is the mode index, ωα(k) is the dispersion relation for the phonon with
wave vector k, vα is the group velocity, ηi = 1/(eω/kB T − 1) is the distribution of
phonons in the reservoirs, and Tα is the transmission coefficient.
At the low enough temperature only fundamental acoustic modes are occupied in
the 1D quantum channel connecting the two reservoirs and the heat flux given by the
Eq. (16.2) can be expressed through the approximation [12]: q = NT gT0 (T2 − T1)
valid only when T2 − T1  (T1 + T2)/2 where N is the number of channels, T is
the transmission coefficient integrated over all the wave-vectors.
The thermal conductance of insulators could be quantized due to the limited
available phonon modes in the small structures at the low temperatures [11].
Experimental study of the ballistic transport of phonons can be performed at
very low temperatures with the optimal coupling of the quantum channels to the
two reservoirs where the phonon mean free paths can be longer than the length of
the heat conductor, and the dominant phonon wavelength is much larger than the
nanowire diameter. This wavelength is [12] λdom = hvs/2.82kB T , vs is the phonon
group velocity, and reaches 200 nm at 1 K in nanowires made from the stoichiometric
silicon nitride SiN and still increases to up 2 μm as the temperature decreases down
to 0.1 K. Thus it is expected that the nanowire of the diameter d below 100 nm will
enter the one-dimensional regime (where λdom  d) at the temperature below 1 K.
In this extreme limit, it is expected that the phonons travel ballistically between the
two reservoirs through the one-dimensional waveguide; the thermal transport is then
dominated by the wave nature of phonons and thus by the transmission coefficient
T.
Tavakoli et al. [12] used for the extremely sensitive thermal experiments the
microplatform suspended sensor that provide a power sensitivity of 15 attoWatt√Hz−1
at around 100 mK that allows the authors to measure the thermal conductance vari￾ation with a sensitivity of 0.15 f emtoW attK −1
√Hz−1
[3].
The measurement platform consisted of two membranes suspended by eight sup￾porting beams and thermally connected to each other by one or two nanowires (the
1D phonon waveguides). Each nanowire has four quantum channels of the heat
conduction, corresponding to the four different acoustic phonon polarizations (one
longitudinal, two transverse and one shear modes) [3]. To reduce the contact resis￾tance due to the acoustic mismatch between the nanowire and the membrane, the352 16 Landauer Approach
whole system has been fabricated from the same material (SiN). The thermal link
between the 1D phonon waveguide and the reservoirs was patterned with a catenoidal
shape to optimize the transmission of the phonon modes [12] since this geometrical
design was shown to maximize the transmission coefficient [3, 17].
Ballistic thermal transport is found by Tavakoli et al. [12] to be dominated by
non-ideal transmission coefficients and not by the quantized thermal conductance of
the nanowire itself.
In recent years, it has become possible to measure quantized thermal conductance
even at room temperature [7, 18]. The experiments are performed on metallic contacts
of atomic size with scanning thermal microscopy probes. The material is usually Au
or Pt [18]. The electrical conductance plateaus at multiples of 2e2/h are typically
seen when pulling the contact to the few conductance channel limit.
Blencowe [19] considered the phonon behaviour in the nanowire that connects
two very long, “perfect” leads (crystalline leads having the uniform cross section).
The scattering may be caused by a changing cross section, the surface roughness
[20] or the various internal defects.
The author made a few assumptions: the phonon scattering is elastic; the phonon–
phonon interactions could be neglected (it should be noted that the phonon–phonon
interaction increases with size reduction due to the confinement [21]); no scattering
occurs at the reservoir-lead connections; the phonon distributions in reservoirs con￾nected to the leads are Bose–Einstein distributions; the continuum approximation
can be used for the wire lattice dynamics.
The equations of motion for the displacement field ui are written as

∂2ui
∂t 2 − cijkl

∂x j ∂xk

thus in the absence of scattering one subband n contributes to the conductance κ the
universal quantum gT0 (16.1) in the limit En,0/kB T → 0 [3].
Blencowe analysed whether the steps in the temperature dependence of the thermal
conductance could be detected experimentally and found that the subband separa￾tion would have to increase by the order of magnitude from one subband to the next
En+1,0/En,0 > 14 while in the real wires the subband separation typically varies as
En+1,0/En,0 ≈ (n + 1)/n. Thus the steps cannot be resolved because of the broad-16 Landauer Approach 355
ness of the Bose–Einstein distribution compared with the subband edge separation
[19] that confirms conclusions made by Angelescu et al. [2].
There is a plateau in experiments for T → 0 where only phonons in the lowest
subband with En,0 = 0 contribute to the conductance as was shown by Rego &
Kirczenow [3]. The plateau has the value four in universal quantum units since there
are four basic modes: dilatational, torsional and two types of flexural mode [22].
Santamore and Cross [23] explained the reduce of the conductance below the
universal value at the low temperature T ∈ (0.1 − 0.4)K by the surface roughness
and derived the expression based on the interaction of the elastic waves with the

Sääskilahti et al. [24] studied the quantum heat transfer between the lead regions
connected by the centre region. The authors noted that commonly used model such
as the Boltzmann transport equation is not applicable to the systems where the
phonon wave effects are significant while the non-equilibrium Green’s function
NEGF method is computationally extremely demanding and thus limited to the small
systems. Sääskilahti et al. exploited the self-consistent thermal bath (SCTB) model
[25] that allows to study the nanostructures consisting of the relatively large number
of atoms.
All atoms within the leads are coupled to the local Langevin heat baths set to
the given temperature values TL and TR. The atoms in the centre region are coupled
to the local heat baths whose temperatures are determined self-consistently from
the requirement of the local current conservation—there is no net energy transfer
between an atom and the corresponding local heat reservoir [24]. The coupling to
the Langevin heat baths effectively mimics thermalization events such as the phonon–
phonon scattering. In contrast to the Landauer–Büttiker model, the phonon transport
is not assumed to be ballistic either in the leads or in the centre region.
The time evolution of atoms consists of two parts. The first—deterministic—part
is specified by the system Hamiltonian

The second part consists of a stochastic force and friction due to the interaction

mu¨ I = −K I uI −
J=I
V I J uJ − mγI u˙ I + ξI (16.7)
where the last two terms are the Langevin friction and the noise terms. The friction
parameter γI determines the strength of coupling to the heat bath that can be inter￾preted as the phonon decay rate [24, 27]. The Ith component of the stochastic force
ξI is the fluctuating force at site I due to the interaction with the local heat bath.

Green–Kubo Approach
Recently Isaeva et al. [1] introduced an approach for modelling the heat transport in
solids based on the Green–Kubo theory of linear response [2–5] that relates the heat
conductivity to the ensemble average of the heat flux auto-correlation function [6]

where V is the system volume, T is the temperature, Jα(t) is the α-th Cartesian
component of the macroscopic heat flux, which in solids coincides with the energy
flux, and · indicates a canonical average over initial conditions.
The heat flux is the macroscopic average of the heat current density, which is in
turn defined as the non-convective component of the energy current density. Atoms in
solids can be assumed to not diffuse; thus, the energy and the heat currents coincide
[6].
The macroscopic energy flux J can be expressed in terms of the atomic positions
Ri and the local energies εi as
J =

(R˙ i εi + Ri ε). ˙

The second term on the right-hand side of the Eq. (17.2) is the total time derivative
of a process that, in the absence of the atomic diffusion, is stationary and of the finite
variance.
The recently established gauge invariance principle for the heat transport1 states
that such a total time derivative does not contribute to the thermal conductivity and
thus this term could be neglected [1]. The final expression for the harmonic heat flux
is written as [1]

Inserting Eq. (17.3) into the expression (17.1) yields an infinite conductivity, as
expected for a harmonic crystal [9]. Isaeva et al. [1] introduced the anharmonic effects
by renormalizing the single-mode correlation functions the normal-mode lifetimes
in order to regularize the integral and get for the heat conductivity tensor (“the quasi￾harmonic Green–Kubo QHGC approximation”)

1Thermal transport coefficients are independent of the specific microscopic expression for the
energy density and current from which they can be derived through the Green–Kubo formula [6, 8].
It is often implicitly assumed that the well-definiteness of the thermal transport coefficients
would stem from the uniqueness of the decomposition of the system’s total energy into localized,
atomic, contributions. This assumption is incorrect, as any decomposition leading to the same value
for the total energy; the very possibility of defining the energy current density stems from the energy
extensibility and conservation. Two equivalent energy densities can be thought of as the different
gauges of the same scalar field and the energy fluxes of the same system in two different energy
gauges, differing by a total time derivative, result in the same heat conductivity, as given by the
Green–Kubo formula. Thus, while the heat flux is inherently undetermined at the atomic level (this
indeterminacy stems from the liberty one has to formally unpack the total energy of the system into
the localized contributions in an infinite number of equivalent ways), the heat conductivity resulting
from it through the Green–Kubo formula is indeed well defined [6].17 Green–Kubo Approach 361

QHGK is a general theory that allows one to accurately calculate the thermal
transport in both the crystals and glasses at a full quantum mechanical level. To
account for the quantum mechanical effects in the energy transport the authors used

Isaeva et al. [1] compared the theoretical results with the molecular dynamics
simulations for amorphous silicon using the empirical bond-order Tersoff potential
and found an excellent agreement at temperatures less than 600 K while at higher
temperatures QHGK model overestimates the thermal conductivity since it neglects
the higher-order anharmonic effects.362 17 Green–Kubo Approach
The suggested by Isaeva et al. combines the Boltzmann kinetic approach in the
single-mode relaxation-time approximation (RTA) to the heat transfer in crystals
[10] and the Allen-Feldman model for glasses [11, 12]. As the authors stated this
approach is based on using the IFC matrix computed at the mechanical equilibrium
and the anharmonic lifetimes of the vibrational modes computed from the cubic
corrections to the harmonic IFCs using the Fermi’s golden rule [13].

Coherent Phonon Transport
Superlattices play an important role in thermoelectricity [1], in micro- and optoelec￾tronics [2–4]. The thermal properties of the semiconductor and metal/semiconductor
SLs have been widely investigated numerically [5–8] and experimentally [9, 10].
The phonon superlattice corresponds to the periodic arrangement of the different
crystalline materials. It forms a superperiod that confers a new translational symmetry
to the crystal which can impact the phonon dispersion relation and subsequently the
thermal transport properties in the different ways [11]. The heat is carried by a wide
spectrum of the phonon wave packets with the different transport regimes depending
on the magnitude of the characteristic lengths. Each normal mode has the specific
frequency ν, the wavelength λ and the wave vector k = 2π/λu, and u is the unit
vector indicating the propagation direction. Each wave packet has a finite spatial
extension defined as the spatial coherence length lc that is always larger than the
associated wavelength [11].
The effects stemming from the wave nature of phonons enable the subwavelength
features of the structure to affect the long-wavelength phonons. Such low-frequency
vibrations contribute significantly to the thermal transport in the semiconductor mate￾rials due to their long mean free paths (MFPs) [12].
For superlattices with the perfect interfaces the cross-plane thermal conductiv￾ity has a minimum at a particular period thickness depending on the nature of the
materials [6, 9, 10, 13, 14]. On the other hand, for the superlattices with imper￾fect interfaces—for example, the structural interfacial defects [6, 15] or the pressure
induced by the lattice parameter mismatch [7, 16]—the cross-plane thermal conduc￾tivity increases monotonically with the SL period thickness. It has been experimen￾tally established that phonons can propagate ballistically in the superlattices [14].
Consider heat conduction perpendicular to the thickness direction of a thin film
with thickness d. If the inelastic free path of the phonon in > d, a phonon wave
packet of width Lc (Lc is the coherence length for phonons) excited from one bound￾ary traverses the film but maintains its coherence inside the film. At the other bound￾ary, the phonons are scattered (reflected or transmitted). As long as inelastic scat￾tering is not dominant, the diffracted waves can interfere with each other and with
the incoming wave packet even if Lc < d [17]. The resulting transport can span

the ballistic, diffusive and strong localization regimes [18]. Multiple interfaces add
additional chances for a wave packet reflected at an interface to add phase coherently
with scattered waves at other interfaces, as long as these waves are not scattered
inelastically, thus increasing the chance of observing coherent heat conduction by
phonons.
The concept of the phonon coherent transport was invoked in most works to
explain the thermal conductivity trends [11, 19, 20].
In contrast to the spatial and temporal coherence of optical sources that can be
observed externally by measuring their emission [21], the phonon coherence in heat
conduction can only be inferred [17].
Latour et al. [11, 22] suggested the method to compute the frequency-dependent
spatial coherence length by tracking the fluctuations of the atomic displacements at
equilibrium.
The authors stated that any coherence phenomena can be described using the
second-order coherence theory [23] as a correlation: for instance, the spatial coher￾ence of light [24–27] as well as the spatial coherence of electrons [28] is related
to the spatial correlations of the electromagnetic field; the spatial coherence of the
Bose–Einstein condensates arises from the spatial correlations of the wave functions
[29, 30].
Thus the authors postulated that the spatial phonon coherence corresponds to the
spatial correlations of the atomic displacement fluctuations at equilibrium: when two
atoms separated by a distance l oscillate with a given phase relationship their motion
is correlated. The persistence over which this correlation remains preserved at l + l
corresponds to the spatial phonon coherence length lc. These spatial correlations arise
from the presence of the phonon wave packets in the system. Within the wave packet,
atoms vibrate in phase, which means they have a correlated motion with respect to
each other. Hence, the spatial coherence length lc(ω) represents the average spatial
extension of a wave packet at the frequency ω.
The mutual coherence function α,β (|zm − zn|,τ) is introduced between two
transverse planes of coordinates zm and zn along the correlation direction e as the
triple sum of the time correlations of the velocity fields between all pairs of atoms
separated by |zm − zn|. Taking the Fourier transform of α,β (|zm − zn|,τ) allows
the authors to extract the two-point cross-spectral density function Wα,β (zm,zn, ω).
For each frequency of the phonon spectrum Wα,β (zm,zn, ω) contains the space￾dependent correlation along the direction e. The degree of coherence μ(zm,zn, ω)
is then calculated from the two-point cross-correlation function as [11]
μ(zm,zn, ω) = Wα,β (zm,zn, ω)
[Wα,β (zm,zm, ω)]1/2[Wα,β (zn,zn, ω)]1/2 .
Since Wα,β (zm,zm, ω) corresponds to the local density of states of all atoms
present at z = zm and thus is a real number, μ(zm,zn, ω) contains the two-point
correlation of all possible pairs of planes. Latour et al. define the spatial cross￾correlation C(kz, ω) as18 Coherent Phonon Transport 365
C(kz, ω) = 1
N − k
N
−k
i=1
μ(zi,zi+k−1, ω), k ∈ (0, 1 ... N − 1).
z is the spatial resolution of the correlation; if e is collinear to one of the lattice
vectors, z corresponds to the lattice parameter along this direction.
The spatial coherence length lc(ω) is defined as the spatial decay of the cross￾correlation function C(kz, ω) that can be extracted from the variance of the nor￾malized cross-spectral density function as [11]

The normalized cross-spectral density function can be considered as the den￾sity probability function. Latour et al. stated that this estimator of the variance is
convenient for the analytical problems but too sensitive to noise for the numerical
simulations and suggested another estimator based on the cumulative distribution
function F(nz, ω) of the normalized cross-spectral density:
F(nz, ω) =
n
k=0 |C(kz, ω)|
2
N−1
k=0 |C(kz, ω)|
2
, n ∈ (0, 1 ... N − 1).
As a cumulative distribution function, F(nz, ω) is bounded between 0 and 1.
Latour et al. [11] introduced the characteristic dimensionless ratio lc(ω)/dSL that
determines whether the phonon transport regime is coherent or incoherent:
• lc(ω)/dSL ≥ 1—the transport of phonon modes at this frequency is coherent since
the spatial extension of the corresponding wave packet is greater than the SL
period thickness and the phonon mean free path is not impacted by the interface
scattering.
• lc(ω)/dSL < 1—the phonon transport is incoherent since the spatial extension of
the wave packet is smaller than the SL period thickness, thus phonons undergo
the diffuse interface scattering and the mean free path is bounded by the period
thickness of the superlattice.
Latour et al. noted that this classification is related to the anharmonicity of the
crystal: if one considers a harmonic system, the coherence length should be infinite
and no transition to an incoherent regime could be observed.
The inclusion into consideration of the mean free path in bulk materials  and
the system length L that characterize the superlattice geometry lead to six possible
transport regimes [11]:
1. lc > dSL , > L. The spatial extension of the phonon wave packet is larger
than the SL period thickness: it is created from the normal modes of the folded
Brillouin zone. Therefore, the larger the SL period thickness, the more folded is
the phonon dispersion, opening more and more band gaps that leads to a lower366 18 Coherent Phonon Transport
group velocity and thus to a smaller thermal conductivity. Phonon travels in an
effective homogeneous medium, free of interfaces in a ballistic regime. Thus the
mean free path is bounded by the superlattice length SL = L and the thermal
conductivity exhibits a increasing trend when making L larger [14].
2. lc < dSL , > L. The phonon wave packet is located in only one-layer material
so it cannot feel the superlattice periodicity. The phonon dispersion corresponds
to the bulk dispersion relations of one of the materials, depending on in which
layer it is. Thus the group velocity is independent from SL period. Even if  > L
the wave packet scatters at the interfaces, limiting the mean free path in the
superlattice SL to half of the period thickness. As a consequence, the thermal
conductivity is not sensitive to L.
3. lc > dSL , dSL << L. Similar to case (1) the coherence length is greater SL
period and so the phonon transport is coherent and governed by the band folding.
As a consequence, the thermal conductivity decreases when increasing period.
Since the wave packet is not sensitive to the interface scattering, the mean free path
in the superlattice SL has the same order of magnitude as in the bulk material.
Thus the thermal conductivity does not depend on the system length.
4. lc < dSL , dSL << L. This case is similar to the case (2): the phonon transport
is incoherent and the interface scattering limits the phonon mean free path in
the superlattice SL = dSL . Thus the thermal conductivity increases with period
thickness and is insensitive to the system size.
5. lc > dSL , < dSL . This case is not physically possible since the phonon coher￾ence length should be always smaller than the bulk phonon mean free path [11].
6. lc < dSL , < dSL . The wave packet is located in only one material layer and
encounters many phonon–phonon collisions before scattering at the interfaces,
thus the thermal conductivity of the SL corresponds to an average of the two bulk
materials with the addition of the interface resistance between them.
The coherent phonon transport (cases (1) and (3)) is associated with a ballistic
transport: the observed ballistic transport in superlattices is a consequence of the fact
that the coherence length of phonon wave packets is larger than the SL period.
To compute the cross-spectral density function and so the spatial phonon coher￾ence length, Latour et al. [11] used the equilibrium molecular dynamics simula￾tions employing the Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential in the argon superlattices and the
Stillinger–Weber potential [31] in the silicon superlattices.
The local density of states (LDOS) was computed for various layer thicknesses,
and the phonon band folding was observed for the SL thickness below the certain
value.
Juntunen et al. [32] showed that the aperiodic superlattices exhibit interplay
between the phononic coherent wave interference effects and the incoherent trans￾port. Numerous studies have predicted the thermal conductivity reduction in SLs
with the randomized layer thicknesses that was attributed to the Anderson local￾ization [33] originating from the destructive interference of coherent phonons and
consequently the quenching wave transport. In the SLs the high-frequency phonons
are primarily scattered by the interface roughness and the atomic mixing [14, 34–36].18 Coherent Phonon Transport 367
The most phonons responsible for the heat conduction have the mid- to long wave￾lengths. These long-wavelength phonons maintain their phases while propagating
through the entire thickness of the SL. If such mid- to long-wavelength phonons can
be scattered, the thermal conductivity of the SLs can be further reduced [37].
The observation of the phonon localization in the heat conduction is surprising
due to the broadband nature of the thermal transport [38, 39]. The recent experiments
[37] and the numerical studies based on using the non-equilibrium Green’s function1
on the GaAs/AlAs superlattices with the ErAs nanodots randomly distributed at the
interfaces have shown the evidence of the phonon wave localization—the Anderson
localization2—of the thermal phonons at the low temperatures.
The computations were performed for three cases:
1. the perfect interfaces;
2. the atomic mixing (roughness) at interfaces;
3. the nanodots at each interface.
The embedded ErAs dots have the additional effect of the scattering phonons over
a wide frequency range decreasing the range of the coherent phonons that propagates
through the entire SL without undergoing scattering. As more dots are added, the
affected range grows. This is indicated by the decreasing the thermal conductivity
with increasing ErAs density.
Luckyanova et al. [37] observed that with an increasing number of superlattice
periods measured with the time-domain thermoreflectance method the thermal con￾1 The atomistic Green’s function [40, 41] approach models the heat transfer through a finite size
device that is coupled to the semi-infinite reservoirs on each end. The dynamical matrix of the entire
system can be written as,
H =

⎣
HL τL D 0
τ †
L D HD τD R

⎤
⎦
where HL , HR and HD are the dynamical matrices of the left reservoir, right reservoir and device
region, respectively. τL D and τD R are the dynamical matrix that couple the left reservoir to the device
and the device to the right reservoir. This formulation is valid when the reservoirs are uncoupled
from one another.
For the semi-infinite reservoirs, the dynamical matrix of this equation is infinitely large. To make
the problem tractable [37], the interactions between the device and the reservoirs are encoded in the
self-energy terms L = τ †

functions obtained from a real space decimation method [42].
2 The Anderson localization first observed in electrons [33] originates from the coherent backscat￾tering, and the destructive interference between the multiple wave scatterings in strongly disordered
media also applies to classical waves in the disordered media [43]. The phonons, as quasiparticles,
have both the particle and wave natures. The phonon wave transport depends on the magnitude of
the phonon mean free path relative to the system size. If the MFP is comparatively shorter than the
system size, phonon propagates in the diffusive regime. If the system size is smaller than MFP, the
ballistic propagation occurs and long-wavelength phonons dominate the thermal transport—those
phonons are the coherent phonons that are especially pronounced at lower temperatures. If there
is a high density of scatterers in the medium, the exponential localization of eigenmodes can be
induced, i.e. the amplitudes decay exponentially along the medium with a rate of decay inversely
proportional to a certain localization length [44].368 18 Coherent Phonon Transport
ductivities near the room temperature increased and eventually saturated, indicating
a transition from the ballistic-to-the diffusive transport. The authors studied three set
of seven GaAs/AlAs SLs with 4, 8, 12, 16, 100, 200 and 300 periods each compris￾ing a 3-nm GaAs layer and a 3-nm AlAs layer on the semi-insulating GaAs (001)
substrate.
The three sets of the SLs were distinguished by the density of the ErAs nanodots
epitaxially grown at the interfaces of the GaAs and AlAs layers:
1. the reference SL without dots;
2. the SL with ErAs dots covering 8% of the interface area;
3. the SL with 25% interface coverage.
In the SL system, the high-frequency phonons are substantially scattered by the
interface roughness and atomic mixing leading to the lower-than-bulk effective ther￾mal conductivity. For all the SLs, the thermal conductivity rapidly increases with
increasing temperature up to about 100 K, above which the thermal conductivity
roughly plateaus, the addition of the ErAs nanodots decreases the overall SL thermal
conductivity, with a greater areal coverage leading to a greater decrease in the ther￾mal conductivity—the embedded ErAs dots have the additional effect of scattering
phonons over a wide frequency range, decreasing the range of coherent phonons that
propagate through the entire SL without undergoing scattering [37].
For small numbers of periods the thermal conductivity also increases with
increasing number of periods, indicating the presence of coherent phonon thermal
transport—the long-wavelength phonons are not effectively scattered by the inter￾face roughness and traverse the thin SLs ballistically while maintaining their phase,
leading to an increasing thermal conductivity.
However, at the cryogenic temperatures the thermal conductivities first increased
but then decreased, indicating the phonon wave localization. The localization effects
in the phonon transport are expected to unfold over an increasing sample thickness,
as the certain phonon modes make the transition from being propagating to non￾propagating due to the destructive interference from the multiple elastic scattering
events.
So far, the localization of the phonon heat conduction has been observed only at
low temperatures [17]. The molecular dynamics simulations suggests that the ape￾riodic Si/Ge superlattices with the perfect interfaces can demonstrate the Anderson
localization at the room temperature [32], although the atomic mixing diminishes
the effect. Similar simulations in GaAs/AlAs did not show the same trend [45–47],
owing to the weaker acoustic contrast [17].
Juntunen et al. [32] studied the spectral characteristics of the phonon localization
in the aperiodic SLs at the room temperature, including the effect of the incoherent
impurity scattering by the interfacial mixing of atomic species. As a paradigmatic
material system, Si/Ge SLs were chosen. The authors found that the broadband
Anderson localization leads to the strongly quenched thermal transport in these sys￾tems resulting in the low cross-plane thermal conductivity (well below the alloy limit
for Si0.5Ge0.5).18 Coherent Phonon Transport 369
Wang et al. [48] using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) sim￾ulations quantitatively described the cross-plane thermal conductivity reduction in
the random Lennard–Jones SLs and multilayer systems using the simple two-phonon
model that decomposes the thermal conductivity into an effective exponentially local￾ized coherent mode and an effective incoherent mode insensitive to wave localization.
However, this model neglects the frequency dependence of MFPs and the length scale
for localization [32]. Wang et al. stressed that the thermal conductivity of a super￾lattice (SL) is significantly reduced by randomizing the thicknesses of its layers,
by which a SL becomes a random multilayer (RML) (Juntunen et al. [32] used a
different terminology: the periodic superlattice (p-SL) and the aperiodic superlattice
(ap-SL)). Such reduction a signature of coherent phonon that can be localized in
RMLs: in the SL both the coherent and the incoherent phonons contribute to the
heat conduction, while in the RML the coherent phonons are localized so only the
incoherent phonons contribute to the heat transfer. The significant increase in the
thermal conductivity of SL with total length is due to the long MFP of the coher￾ent phonons, and the lower thermal conductivity of RML than SL is caused by the
localization of coherent phonons. Imposing aperiodicity on the system with sharp
interfaces, the thermal conductivity is quenched by a drastic 98%. Since the in-plane
thermal conductivity of ap-SL remains comparable to that of p-SL, the cross-plane
localization additionally provides an anomalously large thermal anisotropy of ≈ 102
[32].
Juntunen et al. found that in the case of the interfacial mixing, the impurity scatter￾ing and the associated in-plane disorder reduce the cross-plane and in-plane thermal
conductivities of p-SL by factors of approximately four and eight, respectively, result￾ing in the modest anisotropy of 1.3. While the in-plane conduction of ap-SL follows
that of p-SL, the incoherent scattering induced by the atomic mixing results in an
85% increase in the cross-plane conduction as compared to the ap-SL with sharp
interfaces. Such delocalization reduces the ap-SL anisotropy down to ≈ 10. Still,
anisotropy of the interfacially mixed ap-SL remains over six times larger than in the
corresponding interfacially mixed p-SL. Thus the authors noted that the absence of
the thermal conductivity minimum in the period length dependency of SLs is not a
sufficient indication of incoherent transport.
Juntunen et al. [32] determined the frequency-resolved phonon transmission func￾tion from the atomic velocities collected during NEMD simulation by tracking the
force-velocity correlations between atoms i and j, left and right from the interface,
respectively [49]:

Juntunen et al. distinguish three phonon transport regimes
1. ballistic
2. coherent
3. diffusive
and found through there atomistic simulations the ballistic-to-localized transition
for the low-frequency coherent phonon spectral contribution. Such transition was
experimentally confirmed recently [37].
Luckyanova et al. observed the ballistic-to-localized transport transition at the
low temperatures, while at the higher temperatures the thermal conductivity versus
the number of SL periods dependence indicates the ballistic-to-diffusion transition
behaviour. They stress that such observations open up the opportunities to engineer
the phonon thermal conductivity using the wave effects.
The spectral results obtained by the authors suggest that the aperiodicity-driven
phonon localization presents a robust strategy for tuning the mid-to low-frequency
phonons without fabricating the structurally complex features. The low thermal con￾ductivity is further achieved without deteriorating the crystalline structure of the
material, which is optimal for retaining good electrical properties in, e.g. the ther￾moelectric applications [50].

Conclusions
The attempt is made to cover all major models designed to study the heat transfer
beyond the Fourier conduction model when either temporal or spatial non-locality
(or both) is essential—to describe “a full landscape”. Thermodynamic and fractional
models seem to be the most perspective. The relaxon model is very attractive for
the study of heat conduction in dielectrics and semiconductors. The heat transfer in
biological tissues is studied in majority of cases using the DPL model [1, 2].
There is still no definite experimental evidence in favour of any of the relativistic
hydrodynamical theories. To choose the adequate equations in a mathematically
rigorous justification of the relativistic hydrodynamics on the ground of microscopic
theory is of great importance [3].

An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
A.1 Fractional Derivatives
Fractional calculus (FC) is now an efficient tool for numerous problems in science
and engineering [1–8]. The term “fractional” is kept for the historical reasons—it is
a misnomer since the order can be real and is not restricted to be rational [9, 10].
Historical survey of the development of FC starting from the letter by Gottfried
Leibniz to Guillaume l’Hôpital (1695) including contributions by Joseph Liouville,
Bernhard Riemann, Niels Abel, Grünwald, Aleksey Letnikov, Gerasimov, Marcel
Riesz, Magnus Mittag-Leffler, Paul Lévy, Raoul Nigmatullin, Yuri Rabotnov, Oliver
Heviside, Arthur Erdélyi and others during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
could be found in Refs. [11–15].
Lorenzo and Hartley [16] analysed the minimal set of criteria for the generalized
calculus formulated by B. Ross:
1. Analyticity: if f (z)is an analytic function of the complex variable z, the derivative
Dν
z f (z) is an analytic function of z and ν.
2. Backward compatibility: the operation Dν
z f (z) must produce the same result as
ordinary differentiation when ν = n is a positive integer; the operation Dν
z f (z)
must produce the same result as ordinary n-fold integration when n is a negative
integer; Dν
z f (z) must vanish along with its n − 1 derivatives at x = c.
3. Zero property: the operation of order zero leaves the function unchanged
D0
z f (z) = f (x).
4. Linearity: the fractional operators must be linear Dν
z [a f (x) + bg(x)] = a Dν
z
f (x) + Dν
z g(x).
5. Composition (index law): the law of exponents for integration of arbitrary order
Dν
z Dμ
z f (x) = Dν+μ z f (x).
The fractional derivatives are based on the extension of the repeated integration
and are defined either by the continuation of the fractional integral to the negative
order or by the integer order derivatives of the fractional integrals [12].

375376 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
There is no unique definition of the fractional derivative [4, 6, 8] (and notation
for fractional derivatives is not standardized [12, 17]).
There are several kinds of definitions of the fractional derivatives (Riemann–
Liouville, Caputo, Grünwald–Letnikov, Riesz, Weyl, Marchaud, Caputo–Fabrizio,
Yang, Chen, He, Zhao-Cai-Yang and some others) that are not equivalent [18, 19].
The initial conditions for the Caputo derivative are expressed in terms of the initial val￾ues of the integer order derivatives; for the zero initial conditions Riemann–Liouville,
Caputo and Grünwald–Letnikov derivatives coincide [20]. The non-differentiable
functions such as the Weierstrass function can have the fractional derivatives. Most
of the fractional derivatives are define through the fractional integral thus derivatives
inherent some non-local behaviour [21]. The following relation is valid for all types
of the fractional derivatives [22]
dα+β
dtα+β = dα
dtα
dβ
dtβ = dβ

dtα .
The most frequently used are the Riemann–Liouville (e.g. in the calculus), the
Caputo (e.g. in the physics, the numerical computations) and Grünwald–Letnikov
(e.g. in the signal processing, the engineering) fractional derivatives [17, 23].
Grigoletto and de Oliveira [24] considered the generalization of the fundamental
theorem of calculus to the fractional calculus—Fundamental Theorem of Fractional
Calculus (FTFC) for the cases of the Riemann–Liouville, Liouville, Caputo, Weyl
and Riesz derivatives.
Baleanu and Fernandez [25] considered the possible classification of the fractional
operators into broad classes under some restrictions and criteria. In particularity,
many operators could be considered as the special cases of [26]

Both the Riemann–Liouville and the Caputo fractional derivatives are based on the

function and fort → 0 behaves like O(t−ν )with ν<α. To get the strict mathematical
rigor it is possible to use the framework of the Lebesgue spaces of the summable
functions or the Sobolev spaces of the generalized functions [29].

The Riemann–Liouville fractional integral has the semi-group property (also
called additivity law [12]):
J α
a+ J β
a+ f (x) = J α+β
a+ f (x), α > 0, β> 0
which implies the commutative property [30]:

It is evident that the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral coincides with the clas￾sical definition in the case α ∈ N. The fractional integration improves the smoothness
properties of functions [31].
Sometimes the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral could be expressed in terms
of the elementary functions [8]. For example,
J α
a+ (x − a)
μ = (μ + 1)
(α + μ + 1)
(x − a)

A particular case of the Riemann–Liouville fractional integrals is the Liouville
fractional integrals [24] that is obtained by transitions a → −∞ and b → ∞ in Eqs.

Atangana and Secer [32] presented tables of the fractional Riemann–Liouville
derivatives of the trigonometric and some special functions.
The fractional Riemann–Liouville derivative of the power function is

and, particular, the derivative of a constant
Dα

(1 − α).
Since the fractional Riemann–Liouville derivative of a constant is not zero, thus
the magnitude of the fractional derivative changes with adding of the constant.
Jumarie [33] suggested a modification to remove this drawback. He started with
a fractional derivative (F-derivative)
f α(x) = lim

based on the fractional difference α f (x) of order α, α ∈ R, 0 < α ≤ 1.

[36, 37].

and found that these simplifications are not universally valid.

A.1.3 Caputo Fractional Derivative
The fractional derivatives in the Caputo sense on the left (C Dα
a+) and on the right
(C Dα
b−) are defined via the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral [24] (C Dα
a+ f ) =
(J n−α a+ f (n)
)(x) and (−1)n(C Dα
b− f ) = (J n−α
b− f (n)
)(x). It was introduced indepen-382 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
dently in 1948 by Caputo and by Gerasimov [48]; later by Dzherbashyan and Ners￾esian [49].
The major difference of the Caputo fractional derivative is that the derivative act
first on the function and after the integral is evaluated while in the Riemann–Liouville
approach the derivative act on the integral.
The Caputo fractional derivative is defined as [6]
Dα
 f (t) =

dt, α ∈ (0, 1)
d f (x)
dt
, α = 1
(A.5)
The definition of the Caputo derivative (A.5) is more restrictive than of the
Riemann–Liouville derivative (A.3, A.4) since it requires the absolute integrabil￾ity of the derivative d f (x)/dt [29].
The Caputo fractional derivative can be considered as the regularization in the
time origin for the Riemann–Liouville derivative [9]
Dα
 f (t) = Dα f (t) − f (0+)
t−α
(1 − α)
and satisfies the property of being zero when applied to a constant.
Yuan and Agrawal and Singh and Chatterjee suggested the alternative definitions
of the Caputo fractional derivative [31]. The first approach is based on the introduction
of the auxiliary bivariate function φ : (0,∞) × [a, b] → R as
φ(w, x) = (−1)

where   denote the ceiling function, and, finally

φ(w, x)dw.
The second approach is based on expressing the fractional derivative of the the
given function in the form of the integral over (0,∞) with the integrand that can be
obtained as the solution of the first-order initial value problem

A.1.4 Matrix Approach
Operations of the fractional calculus can be expressed by matrix [50, 51]. For exam￾ple, the left-sided Riemann–Liouville or Caputo fractional derivative can be approx￾imated in the nodes in the equidistant discretization net with the help of the upper
triangular strip matrix B(α)
n as [50]

Similarly, the right-hand Riemann–Liouville or Caputo fractional derivative can be
approximated with the help of the corresponding lower triangular strip matrix.
A.1.5 Caputo and Fabrizio Fractional Derivatives
Caputo and Fabrizio [52, 53] proposed the fractional derivatives without the singular
kernel [54] by replacing the kernel (t − τ )−α with the function exp(−α/(1 − α))
that does not have singularity for t = τ in the definition of the Caputo derivative and
replacing the factor 1/(1 − α) with M(α)/(1 − α).
For example, the fractional time derivative for α ∈ [0, 1] and function f ∈
L1(−∞, b) is
Dα

1 − α
t

where M(α) is a normalization function such as M(0) = M(1) = 1.384 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
A.1.6 GC and GRL Derivatives
Zhao and Luo [55] suggested to divide the fractional derivative with different—
singular and non-singular—kernels (e.g. Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, Caputo–
Fabrizio, Atangana–Baleanu [56]

the water diffusion in the human brain using the magnetic resonance imaging [60])

into two classes—GC (general, Caputo sense) and GRL (general, Riemann–Liouville)
derivatives that obeys the the principles formulated by Volterra in his “general laws
of heredity” [61]:
1. The linearity principle,
2. The invariance principle,
3. The fading memory principle,
4. The compatibility principle.
The compatibility principle requires the validity of two limits: Dα f (x) → f (x)
when α → 0 and Dα f (x) → f 

(x) when α → 1.
The principle of non-locality was suggested by Tarasov [62].
A.1.6.1 GC Derivatives
Zhao and Luo [55] defined the GC derivative by
DGC
a,α f (x) = N(α) x

k(x − t, α)
d f (t)
dt
dt
1 The fractional diffusion equation with the Atangana–Baleanu operator is related to the fractional
derivatives of distributed order [57].Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 385
The fading memory principle requires that the remote time and position has less
effect: k(x − t, α) decreases when x increases and k(x − t, α) → 0 when x → ∞.
The compatibility principle requires that N(α)/k(x, α) → 1 when α → 0 and
N(α)/k(x, α) → δ(x) when α → 1.
A.1.6.2 GRL Derivatives
DRL

dx N(α) x

The restrictions on k(x − t, α) and N(α) are the same.
A.1.7 Marchaud–Hadamard Fractional Derivatives
Marchaud’s approach is based on the analytic continuation of the fractional integrals
to the negative orders using the Hadamard’s finite parts of the divergent integrals
(Hadamard’s idea is to ignore the unbounded contribution to the integral and to
assign the value of the remaining—finite—expression [31]).
The Marchaud fractional derivative with the lower limit a is
(Mα
a+ f )(x) = f (x)
(1 − α)(x − a)α +
α
(1 − α) x
a
f (x) − f (y)

and with the upper limit b is

(1 − α)

There are two approaches to extend the definition (A.7) to the case α > 1 [12]:
1. To apply (A.7) to the nth derivative dn f/dx n for n <α< n + 1.
2. To consider f (x − y) − f (x) as the first-order difference and to generalize to nth
order difference (difference quotient)

A.1.8 Grünwald–Letnikov Derivative
The approach suggested independently by Grünwald in 1867 and Letnikov [63] in
1868 is based on the use the limits of the difference quotients (A.8) similar to the
classical definition of the derivatives for n ∈ N, f ∈ Cn[a, b], a < x ≤ b

and extension to the case of the arbitrary n.

f (x − kh). (A.9)
The series (A.9) is uniformly convergent for any bounded function if n > 0 [64].
The use of (A.9) introduce two problems [31]:
1. The function f needs to be defined on (∞, b].
2. The function f should be such that the series converges.
These problems are solved by the introduction a new function f 
f  =

f (x) x ∈ [a, b]
0 x ∈ (−∞, a)
that is used instead of the original f .
It is also assumed that in the tending to zero h takes only the Grünwald–Letnikov

The Erdélye–Kober fractional integral for a sufficiently well-behaved function φ(t)
is defined as [68, 69]390 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus

where μ > 0, η> 0, γ ∈ R.
In the special case γ = 0, η = 1 the Erdélye–Kober fractional integral is related
to the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral of the order μ as

A.1.12 Interpretation of Fractional Integral and Derivatives
The integer-order and integrals have a clear physical and geometrical interpretation
that simplify their use in practice. The numerous different interpretations of the
fractional derivatives and integrals have been proposed [70]: the probabilistic [71–
73], geometric [74–77], physical interpretations [76–80].
However, as noted Podlubny [81], “since the appearance of the idea of differen￾tiation and of arbitrary (not necessary integer) order there was not any acceptable
geometric and physical interpretation of these operations for more than 300 years”.
Teneiro Machado [73] wrote the Grünwald–Letnikov fractional derivative of the
signal x(t) as
Dα[x(t)] = lim
h→0

1
hα
∞
k=0
γ (α, k)x(t − kh)

,
γ (α, k) = (−1)
k (α + 1)
k!(α − k + 1)Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 391
where h is the time increment.
The author noted that
γ (α, 0) = 1, −
∞
k=0
γ (α, k) = 1
thus the “present” (P) is constituted by x(t) the probability 1 while the totality of the
“past/future” (PF) is constituted by the samples x(t), x(t − h), x(t − 2h), . . . ; each
sample is weighted with a probability −γ (α, k).
Nigmatullin [78, 82] interpreted the fractional integral in terms of the fractal
Cantor set. The author considered the evolution of the state of the physical system
J (t) =
t
0
K(t,τ) f (t)dτ
where the memory function K(t,τ) f (t) accounts for the loss of some states of th
system; the fractional index of integration equals the fractal dimension of the Cantor
set.
Podlubny [81] and Podlubny et al. [83] suggested the geometrical interpretation
of the left-sided (Eq. (A.1)) and right-sided (Eq. (A.2)) Riemann–Liouville fractional
integrals and of the Riemann–Liouville (Eqs. (A.3)–(A.4)) and the Caputo (Eq. (A.5))
derivatives, as well as of the Riesz potential that is the sum of the left-sided and right￾sided Riemann–Liouville fractional integrals

⎦
and of the Feller potential
α f (x) = c J α
a+ f (x) + d J α
b− f (x).
The geometric interpretation by Podlubny is based on adding the third dimension
gx (t) = 1
(α + 1)
[xα + (x − t)
α]
to the pair (t, f (x)) and considering the three-dimensional line (t, gx (t), f (t)) as
the top edge of the “fence” that gives shadow on the wall in the (g, f ) plane.
Tarasov [84] proposed the “informatic” (“computer science”) interpretation of the
Riemann–Liouville and the Caputo derivatives of the non-integer orders using the
reconstructions from the infinite sequence of the derivatives of the integer orders.
Such reconstructions are based on the Kotel’nikov theorem (also known as the sam-392 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
pling theorem) proved by Vladimir Kotel’nikov in 1933 and also by Claude Shannon
1949: under the certain restrictive conditions, function f (t) can be restored from its
samples f [n] = f (nT ) according to the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.
The author stressed that infinity of the sequences of the integer derivatives plays a
fundamental role in representation of the fractional derivatives that describe non￾locality and memory.
Gómez-Aguilar et al. [85] analysed the Caputo fractional differentiation in time
using the RC circuit for which the fractional version of the Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s
law are written as
v(t) = 1
σ1−γ
dγ q
dt γ , R
dq
dt
+
1
C q(t) = v(t)
where q is the electric charge, v is the voltage, R is the resistance of the conductor,
C is the capacitance. The parameter σ is introduced in order to be consistent with
the dimensionality; it characterizes the fractional structures (the components that
show the intermediate behaviour between conservative (capacitor) and dissipative
(resistor) [85]. The authors derived the fractional differential equation for the RC
circuit
dγ
dt γ
+

τγ
q(t) = C
τγ
v(t)
where
τγ = RC
σ1−γ
is called the fractional time constant. Gómez-Aguilar et al. claimed that the fractional
differentiation with respect to time can be interpreted as an existence of memory
effects that reflect the intrinsic dissipation in the system.
Sierociuk et al. [86] used the RC network to model the fractional order diffusion
based on the analogy between the heat and electrical conduction. The authors showed
that the equations for the capacitor and for the resistor in the transmission line could
be used to get the diffusion equation; the loosing of heat was represented by the
additional resistors connected parallel to capacitors.
Carpinteri et al. [87] considered the mechanical interpretation of the Marchaud
fractional derivative using the body springs connecting the non-adjacent points of
the body with the stiffness decaying with the distance between the material points.
A.1.13 Local Fractional Derivatives
The fractional derivatives are non-local. Several researches introduced the local vari￾ants [88] that are useful for study of the pointwise behaviour of the fractal and mul￾tifractal functions that describe, for example, the stress and deformation patternsAppendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 393
in materials exhibiting the fractal-like microstructure [87] or the velocity field of
turbulent fluid [89].
Kolwankar and Gangal [89–92] defined the local derivative via the Riemann–
Liouville fractional derivative as
Dq f (y) = lim
x→y
Dq ( f (x) − f (y))
(x − y)q
if the limit exists and finite.
The local fractional Taylor formula is written as [93]
f (x) = n
i=0
f (n)(y)
(1 + n)
(x − y)
n Dα
(n! + α)(x − y)
α + Rα(x, y).
Yang et al. [94, 95] used similar definition
D(k) f (τ ) = lim
τ→τ0
f (τ ) − f (τ0)
τ k − τ k
0
.
Chen et al. [96] proposed the local derivatives based on the integrals of the
difference-quotient (IDQ) or the singular of difference-quotient (SIDQ). For exam￾ple, the right SIDQ local derivative is
Dα f (y) = 1
(1 − α)
lim
h→0+

1
0
(1 − t)
−α f (th + y) − f (y)
hα dt.
The local fractional derivative is essentially the fractal derivative [97, 98]. In con￾trast to the purely analytical approach of the fractional calculus, the fractal calculus
follows the physical-geometric approach; to avoid confusion it is suggested to call
the latter the scaled calculus [99].
The fractal (“Hausdorff”) derivative on the time fractal is defined as [100]
∂ f
∂tσ = lim
tB→tA
f (tB) − f (tA)
(tB)σ − (tA)σ
where σ is the fractal dimension of time.
A more general definition is formulated as [101, 102]
∂τ f
∂tσ = lim
tB→tA
f τ (tB) − f τ (tA)
(tB)σ − (tA)σ
Since the fractal derivative is the local operator, the numerical solution of the
fractal derivative equations can be performed by the standard numerical techniques394 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
for the integer-order differential equations [103]. The similar properties have the
so-called conformable fractional derivatives.
A.1.13.1 “Conformable” Fractional Derivative
Most fractional derivatives do not have the desirable properties [104–106]:
• the derivative of a constant is not zero;
• they do not obey the product rule Dα( f g) = f Dα(g) + gDα f ;
• they do not obey the quotient rule
Dα
 f
g

= gDα( f ) − f Dα(g)
g2 ;
• they do not obey the chain rule Dα( f g) = f α(g(t)gα(t);
• they do not obey in general Dα Dβ f = Dα+β f .
Khalil et al. [105] and Katugampola [106, 107] suggested the so called con￾formable limit based [108] derivatives
Dα f (t) = lim
→0
f (t + t 1−α) − f (t)
 , 0 <α< 1,
and
Dα f (t) = lim
→0
f (tet−α
) − f (t)
 , 0 <α< 1.
Since the conformable derivative is the extension of the classical derivative defi￾nition, this derivative obeys the product rule, the quotient rule, the linearity property,
the zero derivative for the constant and are valid for some extensions of the classical
calculus such as the Rolle’s theorem or mean value theorem [21].
A.2 Tempered Fractional Calculus
Sabzikar et al. [109] suggested a variant of the fractional calculus where power
laws are tempered by the exponential factor. The random walks model with the
exponentially tempered power law jumps converges to a tempered stable motion
[110]. This tempered fractional diffusion is useful in the geophysical [111, 112] and
financial [113] problems.
The authors considered two intervals for the parameter α:
• 0 <α< 1
The tempered fractional derivative ∂α,λ
x is defined as the function with the Fourier
transform [(λ + ik)α − λα] ˆf (k) that in real space is written asAppendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 395

The negative tempered fractional derivative ∂α,λ
−x is defined as the function with the
Fourier transform [(λ − ik)α − λα] ˆf (k) that in real space is written as

• 1 <α< 2
The tempered fractional derivative ∂α,λ
x is defined as the function with the Fourier
transform [(λ + ik)α − λα − ikαλα−1] ˆf (k) that in real space is written as
∂α,λ
x f (x) = α(1 − α)
(2 − α) ∞
0
( f (x − y) − f (x) + y f 

(x))e−λy y−α−1
dy.
The negative tempered fractional derivative ∂α,λ
x is defined as the function with the
Fourier transform [(λ − ik)α − λα + ikαλα−1] ˆf (k) that in real space is written as
∂α,λ
−x f (x) = α(1 − α)
(2 − α) ∞
0
( f (x + y) − f (x) − y f 

(x))e−λy y−α−1

Sabzikar et al. introduced the positive tempered integral as
Iα,λ

(α) x
−∞
f (u)(x − u)
α−1
e−λ(x−u)

(α) x

f (u)(u − x)
α−1
e−λ(u−x)

called the Riemann–Liouville tempered fractional integrals since for λ = 0 they
reduce to the usual Riemann–Liouville fractional integrals.
The authors defined the Riemann–Liouville tempered fractional derivatives Dα,λ

as functions with the Fourier transform (λ ± ik)α ˆf (k) that can be expressed via the

A.3 Fractional Differential Equations
Generally, the fractal media could not be considered as continuous media. The use
of the non-integer dimensional spaces [1] is necessary to describe a fractal medium
by the continuous models [40]. The fractional differential equations [31, 114–116]
(Niels Abel and Joseph Liouville were the first to apply the fractional calculus ) are
non-local (i.e. could incorporate the effects of the memory and the spatial correla￾tions) and able to describe the anomalous diffusion (both the sub- and superdiffusion)
and the anomalous heat conduction [117]—e.g. the heat conduction in the porous
medium can be described by the superdiffusion model [118].
Zhao et al. [119] listed a number of the heat transfer equations in the fractal mate￾rials using the local fractional calculus (LFC), e.g. the non-homogeneous equation
in the fractal ω-dimensional space is written as
ρωCω
∂ωθ
∂τ ω − λ2ω ∂2ωθ
∂φ2ω −  = 0,
where ρω is the density of the fractal medium, Cω is the specific heat, λ2ω is the
thermal conductivity,  is the external heat source.
Fractional differential equations could be formulated in the distinct but mathe￾matically equivalent forms. Mainardi et al. [120] compared the fractional extensions
of the standard Cauchy problem for the diffusion equation
∂u(x, t)
∂t = ∂2u(x, t)
∂x 2 , x ∈ R, t ∈ R+
0 (A.11)
with the initial condition
u(x, 0+) = u0(x). (A.12)
The fundamental solution (or Green function) of the Eq. (A.11), i.e. the solution
subjected to the initial condition u0(x) = δ(x), is the Gaussian probability densityAppendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 397

The Green function has the scaling property
u(x, t) = t

,
U(x) is the reduced Green function.
The Cauchy problem (A.11, A.12) is equivalent to the integro-differential
equation
u(x, t) = u0(x) +
t

∂2u(x,τ)
∂x 2

dτ
where the initial condition is incorporated.
The fractional diffusion equation could be written with the use of the Riemann–
Liouville derivative D1−β (β is the real number 0 <β< 1)
∂u(x, t)
∂t = D1−β ∂2u(x, t)
∂x 2 (A.13)
or the Caputo derivative Dβ

Dβ
 u(x, t) = ∂2u(x, t)
∂x 2 . (A.14)
Equations (A.13) and (A.14) are equivalent to the equation based on the use of
the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral of the order β
u(x, t) = u0(x) + J β

∂2u(x,τ)
∂x 2

. (A.15)
Note that the Eq. (A.13) could be obtained by differentiating (A.15), the Eq.
(A.15) can be derived by the fractional integration of (A.14).
Equation (A.13) was studied by Metzler et al. [121] and by Saichev and Zaslavsky
[122], the Eq. (A.15) by Gorenflo et al. [123, 124] and by Mainardi [125, 126],
the integro-differential Eq. (A.15) by Schneider and Wyss [127] using the Mellin
transform.
Mainardi et al. [120] search for the fundamental solution of the Eq. (A.14) by
applying the sequence of the Fourier398 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
F {v(x); k}= ˆv(k) =

eikxv(x)dx, k ∈ R
and the Laplace
L{w(t);s}= ˜w(s) =

transforms.
Thus the Green function in the Fourier–Laplace domain is determined by
ˆ
u˜(k,s) = sβ−1
sβ + k2 , 0 < β ≤ 1, R(s) > 0, k ∈ R. (A.16)
There are two strategies to determine the Green function in the space–time domain
u(x, t) related to the order in performing inversions in the expression (A.16) [120]:
1. Invert the Fourier transform to get u˜(x,s) and then invert the Laplace transform
[125, 126].
2. Invert the Laplace transform to get uˆ(k, t) and then invert the Fourier transform
[128, 129].
Nieto [130] studied the linear fractional differential equation with the spatial
Riemann–Liouville derivative for initial or periodic boundary conditions and derived
the maximum principle using the properties of the Mittag-Leffler functions.
Compte [131] and West et al. [132] studied the equation for the hyperdiffusion
(Lévy-flight diffusion)
∂ P
∂t = D(−) γ
2
where the fractional n-dimensional Laplace operator (−) γ
2 is defined by its Fourier
transform with respect to the spatial variable [114]
F [(−) γ
2 g(x)]=|ω|
γF [g(x)].
Luchko [133] derived the maximum principle for the initial-boundary-value prob￾lem for the time-fractional diffusion equation with Caputo derivative over the open
bounded domain G × (0.T ), G ⊂ Rn.
The fractional differential equation could subjected to the fractional complex
transformation [134–136]
s = x S
(1 + α)Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 399
to convert to a partial differential equation2 For example, the heat conduction equation

(1 + γ ) +

where q, p, k,l are constants.400 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
Babusci et al. [139] discussed relations between the fractional differential equa￾tions and the theories of the pseudo-operators [140, 141] and the generalized integral
transforms.
A.3.1 Distributed Order Differential Equations
The distributed order differential equations (DODE) are a special class of the frac￾tional differential equations [142–150]. Chechkin et al. [151] discussed the natural
and the modifies forms of DODEs and noted that modified form in combination
with the continuity equation and the retarded linear response equation for the flux
exhibiting memory of the processes at the previous times admits a thermodynamic
interpretation. DODEs are used to describe such phenomena as the accelerating sub￾diffusion, decelerating superdiffusion or transformation of the anomalous behaviour
at the short times into the normal behaviour at the long times. For example, Metzler
and Klafter [66] considered the DODE for the description of the ultraslow diffusion
with the logarithmic time dependence x 2(t) ∝ logk t including the so-called Sinai
diffusion (k = 4).
The concept of the distributed order differentiation is close to the variable order
fractional operators that are useful for the study of the viscoelasticity, the reaction
kinetics of proteins, the electrorheological fluids, the damage modelling [152–154].
There are two approaches to the formulation of the distributed order differential
equations
• Direct approach—a new variable does not assigned for the variation in order.
• Independent variable approach—the order is considered as a function of some
independent variable.
Mainardi et al. [120] considered the time-fractional diffusion equation of dis￾tributed order

b(β)dβ = 1 (A.17)
with x ∈ R, t ≥ 0 and the initial condition u(x, 0+) = δ(x). The weight function
b(β) is called the order-density.
The authors used the Fourier and Laplace transforms to get the fundamental
solution similar to a single-order case (A.16)

In the case of small k the Eq. (A.18) can be approximated as

1 − k2
B(s) + ...
and the second moment is written as
μ˜2(s) = − ∂2
∂k2
ˆ
u˜(k = 0,s) = 2
B(s)
. (A.19)
The special case of DODEs are the double-order fractional equations [151]
b(β) = b1δ(β − β1) + b2δ(β − β2), 0 < β1 < β2 ≤ 1, β1 > 0, β2 > 0, β1 + β2 = 1.
Asymptotic behaviour of μ2(t) follows from (A.19) for cases of
• the slow diffusion (the power-law growth, b(β) = b1δ(β − β1) + b2δ(β − β2))
μ˜2(s) = 2
b1sβ1+1 + b2sβ2+1
• the ultraslow diffusion (the logarithmic growth, b(β) = 1)
μ˜2(s) = 2
ln s
s(s − 1)
.
The distributed order equations allow to describe the more complex media. The
time-fractional diffusion equation of the distributed order (A.17) is potentially more
flexible to represent the local phenomena while the space-fractional diffusion equa￾tion of the distributive order is more suited to represent the variations in space [155].402 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
A.3.2 One-Dimensional Fractional Heat Conduction
Equation
The non-local heat transport can be defined as one where the heat flux at given point
depends not only on values at that point but also on values at remote locations, e.g.
a non-local heat flux can be defined as the weighted sum of temperature gradients
evaluated at the points throughout the domain. Due to their non-local nature many
works (e.g. see [156, 157]) have been directed at using the fractional derivative
operators to construct the non-local heat transport models.
Baeumer et al. [158] studied the numerical solution of the heat transfer equation
in the non-conservative form
∂u(x, t)
∂t = κL1+αu(x, t) + f (x, t), 0 <α< 1, x ∈ [0, 1], t > 0
using the different fractional operators, κ is the thermal diffusivity, f (x, t) is the
source/sink term.
The authors found that while the solutions obtained with the Riemann–Liouville
and the Patie–Simon [159] fractional derivatives are conservative, it is not true for
the solution based on the Caputo fractional derivative that can have negative values
for the initial non-negative pulse u(x, 0).
Namba et al. [160] studied the conservative version of the heat conduction equation
∂u(x, t)
∂t = ∂
∂x (κLαu(x, t)) + f (x, t), 0 <α< 1, x ∈ [0, 1], t > 0.
The authors approximate the conserved transport equation using the control vol￾ume scheme [161] and compared the models for heat flux—the Fourier, the Riemann–
Liouville and the Caputo. Namba et al. found that an additional term in the discrete
Riemann–Liouville heat flux could be interpreted as an “apparent advection”. The
authors also suggested the new expression for the heat flux in the finite interval
x ∈ [a, b] as
q(x, t) = ∂α
∂x
[u(x, t) − u(a, t)].
A.3.3 Special Functions
There are special functions related to the differential equation similar to the classical
case (e.g. the Bessel and the cylindrical functions, the classical orthogonal polyno￾mials, the Airy, the Whittaker functions) [162].
The most important functions in the fractional calculus are the Mittag-Leffler
function [163], the H-functions [164–166], the Wright functions [167, 168], the
generalized Lommel–Wright functions [169].Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus 403
The Mittag-Leffler function is even called the “Queen”-function of the fractional
calculus [166].
A.3.3.1 Mittag-Leffler Functions
The eigenfunction of the Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives are the solutions
of the fractional differential equation [12]
Dα
0+[ f (x)] = λf (x)
where λ is the eigenvalue.
The eigenfunctions are
f (x) = x 1−αEα,α(λxα)
where
Eα,β = ∞
k=0
x K
(αk + β) (A.20)
is the generalized (two-parameter) Mittag-Leffler function (also called the Wiman’s
function [170]).
The more general eigenvalue equation for fractional derivatives of the orders α
and β is
Dα,β
0+ [ f (x)] = λf (x)
The solution is [12]
f (x) = x(1−β)(1−α)Eα,α+β (λxα).
The special case is the equation
Dα,1
0+ [ f (x)] = λf (x)
with eigenfunction
f (x) = Eα(λxα).
The one-parameter Mittag-Lefler function is the particular case of (A.20) for
β = α

There are other special cases such as [163]

• E2(x 2) = E2,1(x 2) = cosh(x);
• for x > 0 E1/2(x 1/2) = E1/2(x 1/2) = (1 + er f (x)) exp(x 2);

The Mittag-Leffler function E1 satisfies the functional relation [31, 163]

and the relation between two Mittag-Leffler functions with different parameters
En1,n2 (x) = x En1,n1+n2 (x) +

.
Note that the frequently used relation
Eα(a(t + s)
α) = Eα(atα)Eα(asα), t,s ≥ 1
is valid only if α = 0 or α = 1 [171].
Asymptotic expansions and integral representations of the Mittag-Leffler func￾tions could be found in the papers [152, 163, 172].

A.3.3.2 H Functions
The H-function of order (m, n, p, q) ∈ N4 is defined via the Mellin–Barnes-type
contour integral [114, 165]

(aj − αjs).
Here m, n, p, q are integers satisfying 0 ≤ n ≤ p, 1 ≤ m ≤ q, m2 + n2 = 0,
aj(j = 1,..., p), bj(j = 1,..., q) are complex numbers.406 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
The integration contour L could be chosen in different ways:
• L = L−i∞,i∞ chosen to go from −i∞ to i∞ leaving to the right all poles of
P(A) of the functions  in A(s) and to the left all poles of P(B) of the functions
 in B(s);
• L = Li∞ is a loop beginning and ending at +∞ and encircling in the negative
direction all the poles of P(A);
• L = L−i∞ is a loop beginning and ending at −∞ and encircling in the negative
direction all the poles of PB).
A.3.3.3 Wright Functions
The Wright function is defined by the series representation that is convergent in the
whole z-complex plane [168, 177–179]
Wλ,μ(z) = ∞
n=0
zn
n!(λn + μ), λ> −1, μ ∈ C.
The integral representation of the Wright function is written as
Wλ,μ(z) = 1
2πi

H a
eσ+zσ −λ dσ
σ μ
where H a is the Hankel path (a loop that starts from −∞ along the lower side of
the negative real axis, encircles the circular area the origin with radius  → 0 in the
positive sense, and ends at −∞ along the upper side of the negative real axis).
There are two Wright-type auxiliary functions
Fν (z) = W−ν,0(z), Mν (z) = W−ν,1−ν (z),
where 0 <ν< 1; these functions are related Fν (z) = νzMν (z).

A.4 Solution of Fractional Differential Equations
A.4.1 Analytical Methods
Numerous approximate analytical methods are known:
• the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) [180];
• the combined Laplace–Adomian method (CLAM) [181];
• the variational iteration method (VIM) [182–187]
3 and its local (LVIM) [187–
190] and fractional (using the fractional order Lagrange multipliers) [191, 192]
variants;
• the homotopy perturbation method (HPM)[193–198] and its modification [199]
and local fractional variant (LFHPM) [200];
• the differential transformation method [201–203];
• the heat-balance integral method (HBIM)[204–206];
• the fractional complex transform method (FCTM) [134, 207–210];
• the local fractional Fourier series method (FSM) [211, 212];
• the modified simple equation method [213, 214];
• the method of images (limited to special spatial symmetries);
• the Mellin integral transform method [215];
• the local fractional decomposition method (LFDM) [216];
• the fractional subequation method [217, 218];
• the Sumudu transform methods [219, 220] and its variant — the local fractional
homotopy perturbation Sumudu transform method [221];
• the theta-method [222];
• the Picard successive approximation method (PSAM) [223, 224];
• the local Laplace transforms.
Frequently analytical methods are variants of perturbation methods [225]). For
example, He [226–228] based his homotopy perturbation method to solve the general
equation
A(u) − f (r) = 0
with the general differential operator A divided into linear L and nonlinear N parts
L(u) + N(u) − f (r) = 0
3 VIM includes three steps to determine the variational iteration formula:
1. establishing the correction functional;
2. identifying the Lagrange multipliers;
3. determining the initial iteration.
The second step is the crucial one [188].408 Appendix: An Introduction to Fractional Calculus
on the approach of Liao [229] (who used the two-parameter family of equations) by
considering the one-parameter family
(1 − p)L(u) + pN(u) = 0.
He constructed the homotopy v(r, p) :  × [0, 1] → R that satisfies
H(v, p) = (1 − p)[L(v) − L(v0)] + p[A(v) − f (r)] = 0
where the homotopy parameter p ∈ [0, 1], v0 is the initial approximation.
Evidently,
H(v, 0) = L(v) − L(v0) = 0
and
H(v, 1) = [A(v) − f (r)] = 0.
In topology, L(v) − L(v0) is called deformation. The homotopy parameter p is
considered as a small parameter and the solution is written as a series
v = v0 + pv1 + p2
v2 + p3
v3 +···
and when p → 1
u = lim
p→1
v = v0 + v1 + v2 + v3 +··· .
The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) [230, 231] does not use lineariza￾tion, perturbation or the Green’s functions. The accuracy of the approximate analyt￾ical solutions can be verified by the direct substitution.
The initial value is written as
Lu + Ru + N u = g
where L is the linear operator to be inverted, R is the linear remainder operator and
N is the nonlinear operator.
Thus L−1Lu = u − ,  incorporates the initial values.
The solution and nonlinear term are decomposed into series

The fractional subequation method includes several steps [218]:
• Transformation of the nonlinear fractional equation in two variables x and t
P(u, ut, ux , Dα
t u, Dα
x u,...) = 0, 0 < α ≤ 1,
Dα

(ξ ),
σ is a constant.
• Formulation of a set of overdetermined nonlinear algebraic equations for c and
ai(i = −n, −n + 1,..., n − 1, n) [218].
A.4.2 Numerical Methods
Diethelm et al. [234] listed the requirement to the numerical methods that should be
• convergent,
• consistent of some reasonable order h p,
• stable,
• reasonably inexpensive to run,
• reasonably easy to program.
Numerous methods are used in practice: finite difference, finite elements, radial
basis functions, spectral methods, meshfree methods.
The numerical methods for the fractional differential equations usually are con￾structed by the modification of the methods for the ordinary differential equations but
require significantly more computation time and storage. The approximation of the
fractional derivative needs the computation of the convolution integral that requires
to sample and multiply the behaviour of two functions over the whole of the interval
of integration leading to the operation count of O(n2) where n is number of sampling
points [235].
The reduction of the computational efforts is related to the fading memory prop￾erty of the fractional derivatives that allows to restrict the integration interval—using
the short memory principle [236, 237] (also fixed memory principle [235] and log￾arithmic memory principle [238]), and using adaptive time stepping and adaptive
basis selection [239].
Numerous methods are used to solve the fractional differential equations in prac￾tice: the finite difference [240, 241] (both the explicit, e.g. Euler [242], and the
implicit [243, 244], e.g. the Crank–Nicolson [245, 246] or the alternating direc￾tion implicit [247, 248] schemes, compact schemes [249–252]), the finite elements
[253–257] (including least squares FEM [258], Galerkin FEM [259, 260], discontin￾uous Galerkin FEM [261]), the spectral methods [262–265], the meshfree methods
[266, 267] (including the radial basis functions methods that exploit cubic φ = r 3,
Gaussian φ = exp(−r 2/c2), multiquadrics φ = √c2 + r 2 or inverse multiquadrics
φ = 1/
√c2 + r 2 functions [268–270]), Legendre wavelet collocation method [271].
Chen et al. [272] suggested to use Bernstein polynomials [273] for the solution
of the nonlinear fractional differential equations of variable order. The BernsteinReferences 411
polynomials are defined as
Bi,n =

n
i

xi
(1 − x)
n−i = n−i
k=0
(−1)
k
The Bernstein-spectral method that combines the Bernstein and the shifted Legendre
polynomials was suggested by Karimi et al. [274]. The method for the distributed￾order fractional differential equations is considered by Diethelm et al. [275].
Agarwal et al. [276] considered the solution of the fractional differential equations
with uncertainty.
Bahuguna et al. [277], Hanert [278], Deng et al. [279] and Deng and Li [280],
Ford and Simpson [235], Ford and Connolly [281], Momani et al. [282] reported the
results of the comparison of several numerical methods.
