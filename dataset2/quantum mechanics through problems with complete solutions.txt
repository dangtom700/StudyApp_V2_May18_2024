Quantum Mechanics through Problems
This book contains more than 300 problems in quantum mechanics, with accompanying solutions,
covering topics that are commonly taught in first-year graduate physics programs. Special care is
given to each problem’s formulation, with detailed and extensive solutions provided to support
understanding. The problems span a range of difficulty, from basic exercises to more challenging
applications and extensions of the standard material. Students are required to think critically and
incorporate physics and mathematical techniques learned previously or concurrently to solve the
more challenging problems. Each chapter begins by framing the particular topic being examined
with a short theory section, which sets the context for and motivates the problems that follow. This
text is well suited for self-study or as a useful supplement to existing quantum mechanics textbooks
for upper-undergraduate and graduate students and their instructors.

This book grew out of handwritten class notes, problems, and solutions for the two-semester graduate
quantum mechanics course, which I have been teaching in the Physics Department at Old Dominion
University over the past three decades or so. Undeniably, the start of the covid pandemic in March
2020, and the ensuing forced isolation, provided the impetus for typesetting the notes and problems
into LaTex. While, for a short time, I was tempted by the idea of writing a new graduate quantum
mechanics textbook, I quickly realized that such a textbook – or, at least, the one I had in mind –
would not add a sufficiently novel perspective on the subject to justify its publication. In contrast,
I thought that the collection of problems and solutions had pedagogical value and could be useful not
just to students but also to instructors, as a resource for additional problems and as a reference for
derivations and/or topics not usually covered in class.
A glance at the table of Contents reveals that the problems cover core material, which is standard
fare for the two-semester quantum mechanics sequence. Regretfully, some important topics – for
example, entanglement and path integrals – have been deliberately left out. In my many years of
teaching graduate quantum mechanics at Old Dominion University, I have never had the time to
cover those topics satisfactorily. The reason is mostly the varied backgrounds of an incoming class,
which has made it pedagogically necessary to spend the first several lectures reviewing some more
introductory material, corresponding roughly to the first few chapters of the present book. I suspect
that this state of affairs is not uncommon in other physics departments. In order to keep up the interest
of the more advanced students, the weekly homework assignments have usually included one or two
more challenging problems, aimed at those students. The solutions of these problems were then
discussed, for the benefit of all students, during the following homework follow-up sessions.
Each chapter begins by framing the particular topic being examined with a concise theory section
that sets the context for, and motivates, the problems that follow. Special care has been devoted to
the formulation of these problems and to their solutions.They span a range of difficulties,from basic
exercises to more challenging applications and extensions of the material covered in the chapter.
Examples of the latter type include: Problem 12 in Chapter 3 on the derivation of Ehrenfest’s
relations for a charged particle in an electromagnetic field; Problem 15 in Chapter 5 on the phase￾shift method for describing scattering in one dimension; Problem 11 in Chapter 8 on a model of a
one-dimensional crystal with nearest-neighbor harmonic interactions; Problem 14 in Chapter 11 on
the algebraic derivation of the hydrogen-atom spectrum; Problem 18 in Chapter 14 on the derivation
of the leading- order correction to the hydrogen atom ground-state energy in an electric field;
Problems 24 and 25 in Chapter 15 on the high-energy eikonal approximation for phase shifts and
scattering amplitudes; Problem 21 in Chapter 17 on irreducible tensor operators and time reversal;
Problem 17 in Chapter 18 on the theory of line widths; Problem 10 in Chapter 19 on the derivation
of the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars.
The aim of these more challenging problems is to encourage students to think critically and
to incorporate physics and mathematical techniques learned previously or concurrently into their

work in quantum mechanics. My hope is that the extensive and detailed solutions accompanying the
problems will make the present text well suited for self-study and a useful supplement to existing
quantum mechanics textbooks for upper-undergraduate and graduate students.
Finally, a word about notation: I have used the standard Dirac notation in terms of kets, bras, etc.
that has been adopted by the books on quantum mechanics of the last several decades. However, when
I felt that the Dirac notation was ambiguous, in particular for the inner product ψ|φ, as is the case,
for example, in the discussion of antiunitary operators and time reversal symmetry in Chapter 16,
I used the notation (ψ, φ), prevalent in the mathematical literature, to denote this product. Also, an
operator in the state space of a system is generally denoted by a caret on the letter representing it.
The emphasis here is on the word “generally;” when I felt that it was clear from the context that
the discussion involved operators, I avoided including the caret in order to keep the notation simple.
I hope the reader will not be confused, or too bothered, by this slight lack of consistency.

I owe much to the many first-year graduate students to whom I have had the pleasure to teach
quantum mechanics at Old Dominion University and who have had to endure, through no fault
of their own, the weekly homework assignments which form the body of the present book. Their
questions and comments and, yes, facial expressions, particularly during the homework follow-up
sessions, have motivated me to constantly try to improve and clarify each problem’s formulation
and solution and, whenever appropriate, expand its scope. It is for the reader to judge whether these
efforts have been successful.
I am especially indebted to Vince Higgs and Stephanie Windows at Cambridge University Press.
Vince’s gently persistent nudges have been decisive in helping me to see and define the scope and
focus of the book, while Stephanie’s patient responses to my repeated inquiries have been helpful
in navigating the practicalities of preparing the manuscript for publication. I am also indebted to the
four seasoned and anonymous reviewers, who gave me valuable criticism and advice at an earlier
stage, and to Susan Parkinson for her careful editing of the final version of the manuscript.
Finally, I would like to recognize a special person in my life, my wife Lynn Louise. To her
go my deepest thanks for the patience and understanding she has extended to me, undeservedly,
during the completion of this project and, truly, over the past many years together, when professional
commitments and obligations have intruded into, and sometimes disrupted, our personal lives. Quos

Published online by Cambridge University PressPublished online by Cambridge University Press1 The Failure of Classical Physics
At the beginning of the twentieth century, classical physics – Newtonian mechanics and electromag￾netic theory (Maxwell’s equations, wave phenomena, and optics) – could not explain a number of
experimental facts, including the observed black-body radiation spectrum, the photoelectric effect,
the stability of atoms and the associated spectral lines, the heat capacities of solids, and several
others. The following problems are intended to illustrate the failure of classical physics to explain
these phenomena and how this failure pointed to the need for a radically new treatment.
1.1 Problems
Problem 1 Black-Body Radiation Spectrum
Consider an enclosure of volume V whose walls are kept at temperature T, and define as u(ν, T) dν
the energy density (energy per unit volume) of electromagnetic radiation in the frequency interval ν
to ν + dν. In the mid nineteenth century (at the height of classical physics!), Gustav Kirchoff was
able to show, on the basis of purely thermodynamic arguments, that the distribution u(ν, T) has a
universal character. He also calculated the energy per unit time of radiation of given frequency that
strikes a small area A of the enclosure walls. He introduced polar coordinates r, θ, and φ, where r
is the distance from a point P in the enclosure to the area A, the polar angle θ is measured from the
normal to A and the azimuthal angle φ is measured around the normal to A. The area subtends a solid
angle at P given by A cos θ/r2 and the fraction of radiation energy from P that is directed to A is
given by A cos θ/(4πr2). The total energy in the frequency interval ν to ν + dν that strikes the area
A at time t is then obtained as
 2π
0
dφ
 π/2
0
dθ sin θ
 ct
0
dr r2 A cos θ
4πr2 u(ν, T) dν = ctA
4 u(ν, T) dν ,
where the integration is restricted to a hemisphere of radius ct, c being the speed of light, with θ
varying in the range 0 to π/2. Given the finite velocity c of propagation, only radiation within this
hemisphere will reach the area A in the time t. Denoting by f (ν, T) the fraction of this energy that is
absorbed by the enclosure walls, we have that the total absorbed energy per unit time and area is
E(ν, T) = c
4 f (ν, T) u(ν, T) dν .
In a situation of equilibrium, E(ν, T) must equal the energy per unit time and area emitted by the
enclosure walls in the same frequency interval. The fraction f (ν, T) of absorbed radiation can be at
the most equal to unity. Indeed, a material for which f (ν, T) = 1 is called black, and hence the name
“black-body radiation” used to describe the present phenomenon.

Electromagnetic radiation in an enclosure can be described in terms of an infinite set of uncoupled
harmonic oscillators. The equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics then leads to a
prediction for u(ν, T) that is in contradiction with the experimental data and produces nonsensical
results in the limit of high frequency ν, leading to the so-called ultraviolet catastrophe. The goal of
the present problem is to see how this comes about.
1. Write down Maxwell’s equations for the electric and magnetic fields, E(r, t) and B(r, t), in the
absence of charge and current distributions (use CGS units).
2. Consider the enclosure to be a cubical box of side V1/3, and impose periodic boundary conditions
on the fields, namely
E(x + V1/3, y,z, t) = E(x, y,z, t) , B(x + V1/3, y,z, t) = B(x, y,z, t) ,
and similarly for y and z. Given that the E and B components are periodic functions, they can be
expanded in Fourier series of the form
Ei(r, t) =

k
Ei(k, t) eik·r , Bi(r, t) =

k
Bi(k, t) eik·r ,
where the quantities carrying tildes are coefficients and the wave number k =(kx, ky, kz) is given by
k = 2π
V1/3 n , n = (nx, ny, nz) , ni = 0, ±1, ±2, ...
Insert these expansions into Maxwell’s equations and show that 
E(k, t) satisfies

E(k, t)
∂t
2 = −ω2
k 
E(k, t) , ωk = c|k| = c
2π
V1/3 |n| .
How many independent directions of 
E are there? Further, show how to obtain 
B(k, t).
3. In the limit of large V1/3, the wave numbers k are densely distributed. Show that in this limit the
number of independent harmonic oscillators (normal modes) in dk is as follows:
number of modes in dk = ρ(k) dk = 2 V
(2π)3 dk .
Recalling that in classical statistical mechanics the average energy of a harmonic oscillator kept at
temperature T is simply kBT, where kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and that the frequency ν is related
to the wave number |k| via c|k|/(2π), show that the energy density of radiation with frequencies
between ν and ν + dν is given by the Rayleigh–Jeans law
u(ν, T) dν = 8π
kBT
c3 ν2 dν .
For a fixed temperature the above prediction is in agreement with the data only for small values of
the frequency; it fails spectacularly at larger values. Furthermore, the total energy density of the
radiation, obtained by integrating over ν, is found to be infinite – the aforementioned ultraviolet
catastrophe; see Fig. 1.1.
4. Following Einstein, suppose that the radiation energy of frequency ν is quantized in integer
multiples of hν, where h is Planck’s constant. Calculate the average energy of radiation of
frequency ν, given that the probability that there are n quanta is
pn = e−nhν/kBT

Obtain the energy density in this case – the correct black-body radiation formula first derived by
Planck. Show that the total energy density, that is, the energy density integrated over frequency ν,
is proportional to T4.
Solution
Part 1
In the absence of charge and current distributions, Maxwell’s equations read (in the CGS system of
units)
∇ · E(r, t) = 0 , ∇ × E(r, t) = −∂B(r, t)
c ∂t ,
∇ · B(r, t) = 0 , ∇ × B(r, t) = ∂E(r, t)
c ∂t ,
where c is the speed of light.

By inserting Fourier expansions into the set of Maxwell’s equations, we obtain

which shows that Maxwell’s equations in the absence of sources are equivalent to an infinite set
of uncoupled harmonic oscillators. The initial condition 
E(k, t0) and that on ∂
E(k, t)/∂t at time t0,
which follows from ic k×
B(k, t0), determine 
E(k, t). For each wave number k and angular frequency
ωk there are two harmonic oscillators, corresponding to the two possible independent directions of
the vector 
E(k, t) in the plane perpendicular to k, that is, the two independent polarizations of the
electric field. Once the electric field 
E(k, t) has been determined, the magnetic field 
B(k, t) follows
from direct integration of the equation obtained above,
∂
B(k, t)
c ∂t = −i k × 
E(k, t) .
Part 3
In the limit of large V1/3, we can describe the distribution of modes with a function ρ(k). Since there
is a single wave number in each cell centered at k and with volume (2π)3/V, given that the allowed
k values are close to each other, the function ρ(k) must satisfy the condition
ρ(k) (2π)3
V = 2 =⇒ ρ(k) = 2 V
(2π)3 ,
where the factor 2 accounts for the two independent polarizations associated with each given k. We
then obtain
number of modes in dk = ρ(k) dk = 2 V
(2π)3 dk ,
and the energy density of radiation between ν and ν + dν is given by
u(ν, T) dν = 1
V
kBT × (number of modes in dν) .
Recalling the relation between |k| and ν, it follows that
number of modes in dν = 2 V
(2π)3 4πk2 dk = 8π

yielding the Rayleigh–Jeans law for the energy density of radiation:

Jeans law at small hν/(kBT) but predicts an exponential fall-off at large frequency, in agreement with
experimental data; see Fig. 1.1. In particular, the total energy density is now finite and is proportional

Problem 2 Compton Scattering for an Electron in Motion in the Lab Frame
Consider the scattering of monochromatic photons by free electrons (Compton scattering).
1. Assuming that the electron is initially at rest and using energy and momentum conservation, show
that the shift in the photon wavelength Δλ = λγ
f − λγ
i is given by
Δλ = 2λe sin2 θ0/2 with λe = h
mc ,
where m is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, and θ0 is the angle between the momentum
of the scattered photon and the momentum of the incident photon. Determine (under the same
assumption) the magnitude and direction of the recoil momentum of the electron as a function of
the incident-photon energy Eγ
i and scattering angle θ0.
2. Assume that the electron has an initial momentum pi parallel to the incident-photon momentum
pγ

where λγ
i is the wavelength of the incident photon, θ is the angle of the scattered photon, and
Ei = c

p2
i + (mc)2 is the initial energy of the electron.
3. Show that the result in part 2 can be derived from the expressions in part 1 when the electron is
initially at rest, by a suitable Lorentz transformation.
Solution
Part 1
In the rest frame of the electron, let pγ 
i and pγ 
f be the incident- and scattered-photon momenta.
Energy and momentum conservation give

yields the required relation between the magnitude of the electron’s final momentum and the photon’s
initial energy and final scattering angle.
Part 2
We call the frame in which the electron has initial momentum pi the lab frame. By assumption pi is
parallel to pγ
i . We will denote the momenta and energies of the electron and photons by unprimed
symbols, so pγ
i , Eγ
i and pγ
f , Eγ
f are the initial and final photon momenta and energies and pi, Ef and
pf , Ef are the initial and final electron momenta and energies, respectively. Energy and momentum
conservation in this frame read
pγ
i + pi = pγ
f + pf , Eγ
i + Ei = Eγ
f + Ef .
These relations imply
Ei + Eγ
i − Eγ
f = c

(pi + pγ
i − pγ

and squaring both sides yields

f = cpiEγ
i − cpiEγ
f cos θ − Eγ

where we have used the fact that pi and pγ

f (Eγ

which can be further simplified by using the identity cos θ = 1 − 2 sin2 (θ/2) to obtain

Part 3
Another (instructive) way to solve the problem in Part 2 is to work in the electron’s initial rest frame,
and then transform back to the lab frame, in which the electron has initial momentum pi (parallel to
the initial photon momentum pγ
i ) and energy Ei. The energy of the scattered photon in the laboratory
frame follows from the Lorentz transformation relation:
Eγ
f = γ(Eγ 
f + βcpγ 
f ,x) = γEγ 
f (1 + β cos θ0),
where β xˆ with β = cpi/Ei is the velocity of the electron in the lab frame, and γ = 1/
1 − β2.
By substituting for Eγ
f the expression found in part 1, we obtain
Eγ
f = γ
Eγ 
i (1 + β cos θ0)
1 + (Eγ 
i /mc2)(1 − cos θ0)
.
We need to express the photon energy Eγ
i and scattered photon angle θ0 in terms of the corresponding
lab frame quantities. The energy of the initial photon in the electron’s rest frame is related to its energy
in the lab frame by a Lorentz transformation:
Eγ 
i = γ(Eγ
i − βc pγ
i,x) = γEγ
i (1 − β),
where the momentum of the initial photon is along the xˆ-direction, and hence p
γ
i,x = p
γ
i . The Lorentz
transformation also gives

where θ is the angle of the scattered photon in the lab frame. Making use of the identity cos θ0 =
1/
1 + tan2 θ0, we find
cos θ0 = 1

1 + sin2 θ/[γ2 (cos θ − β)2]

γ2 (cos θ − β)2 + sin2 θ

cos2 θ + β2 − 2 β cos θ + (1 − β2) sin2 θ

1 − β cos θ ,
from which we have the following relations:
1 − cos θ0 = (1 + β)
1 − cos θ
1 − β cos θ , 1 + β cos θ0 = 1 − β2
1 − β cos θ = 1/γ2
1 − β cos θ .
We insert all these relations into the expression for Eγ

and the wavelength shift is, of course, identical to that found in part 2 above.
Problem 3 The Thomson Model of the Atom and Rutherford’s Experiment
After the discovery of the electron by Thomson in 1897, it was believed that “atoms were like
puddings, with negatively charged electrons stuck in like raisins in a smooth background of positive
charge” (S. Weinberg). This picture was drastically changed by experiments performed by Rutherford
and collaborators, who scattered α particles (4He nuclei, which, as we now know, consist of two
protons and two neutrons bound together by the nuclear force, having electric charge 2e) off a thin
foil of gold. Rutherford and collaborators observed α particles scattered at large backward angles.
This was totally unexpected, since electrons are much lighter than α particles.
1. Consider a particle of mass M and velocity v hitting a particle of mass m at rest and continuing
along the same line with velocity v
. Show that, for a given v, energy and momentum conservation
lead to two possible solutions for v
. If a certain condition is satisfied, one of these solutions
corresponds to the case in which particle M inverts its direction of motion. What is this condition?
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press10 The Failure of Classical Physics
2. Suppose the α particles (which were in fact emitted by a radium source in Rutherford’s
experiment) have velocity v ≈ 2.1 × 109 cm/sec, and that the target particles (much heavier
than the α particles) have each charge Ze. If the α particles and target particles interact via the
Coulomb repulsion, what is the distance of closest approach? Show that this distance is of the
order 3 Z × 10−14 cm, and therefore (even for Z ≈ 100) it is much smaller than atomic radii.
Solution
Part 1
Energy and momentum conservation require
Mv2
2 = Mv 2
2
+
mu2
2 , Mv = Mv + mu ,
where, as assumed in the problem, the particle of mass M proceeds after the collision along the same
trajectory as it followed before the collision. Replacing u with M(v−v
)/m in the energy-conservation
relation leads to an equation for v
/v:

v
v − 1 +
M
m = 0 ,
which has the solutions
v = v , v = −m − M
m + M
v .
The first solution (v = v) says that the particle continues along its trajectory undisturbed, which is
unphysical. However, the second solution says that if m > M the particle inverts its trajectory, since
in that case v < 0.
Part 2
At the distance of closest approach, the kinetic energy of the α particle must have been converted
into potential energy (we are neglecting here the recoil energy of the target particle, that is, we are
assuming m 
 M),
Mv2

We have
e2 ≈ 2.3 × 10−19 g cm3
/sec2 , v ≈ 2.1 × 109 cm/sec , M ≈ 6.6 × 10−24 g ,
where we have expressed e2 as αc and α is the (non-dimensional) fine-structure constant having
the approximate value ≈ 1/137 and have used  ≈ 1.05×10−27 g cm2/sec and c = 3.00×1010 cm/sec.
For the mass of the 4He nucleus we have used Mc2 = 2(mp + mn)c2 − 28.3 MeV ≈ 3727 MeV. Here
28.3 MeV is the nuclear binding energy of 4He, and MeV/c2 ≈ 1.78 × 10−27 g. We obtain
r0 ≈ 3Z × 10−14 cm ,
which is much smaller than the size of the atom, of the order of 10−8 cm.

Problem 4 The Stability Problem for the Rutherford Model of the Atom
Consider the Rutherford model of the atom: an electron of electric charge −e orbiting a point-like
nucleus (much heavier, and hence effectively at rest) of electric charge Ze in a circular orbit of radius
R. Knowing that the electron radiates energy away at a rate dE(t)/dt, given by
dE(t)
dt = −2

c3 ,
where a(t) is the electron’s acceleration and c is the speed of light, show that it will take a time
τ = m2c3
Ze4
R3
4 ,
for the electron to spiral into the nucleus. Assume that τ is much larger than the revolution period.
By taking Z = 1 and R ≈ 10−8 cm, as is appropriate for the hydrogen atom, justify this assumption a
posteriori by comparing τ with the revolution period.
Solution
The electron energy is given by
E = mv2
2 − Ze2
r .
It is assumed that the electron is in a circular orbit and that the energy lost by emission of radiation per
revolution is tiny relative to E. The electron is subject to a centripetal acceleration whose magnitude
is given by a = v2/r, where r is the radius of the orbit, so that
ma = Ze2
r2 =⇒ v2 = Ze2
mr ,
and hence
E = −Ze2
2r .
The radius does change with time, albeit very slowly, corresponding to the loss of energy:

At time t = 0 the electron is in an orbit of radius r(0) = R, while at time τ the electron has “fallen into

and, for the hydrogen atom, Z = 1 and R ≈ 10−8 cm, and so we find τ ≈ 10−10 sec, while the revolution

Problem 5 Bohr’s Calculation of the Energy Spectrum of the Hydrogen Atom
In order to solve the stability problem, Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the atom can exist only in
certain states having energies E1 < E2 < ··· , that is, atomic energies are quantized. To obtain these
energies, Bohr assumed that the angular momentum of an electron of mass m and electric charge −e
in a stable circular orbit of radius r around a nucleus of electric charge Ze is an integer multiple n of
the Planck constant  = h/(2π). Following Bohr, calculate the energies En.
Solution
The magnitude of the angular momentum of the electron in a circular orbit of radius r is given by
mvr, where v is the magnitude of the velocity, and according to Bohr’s hypothesis
mvr = n .
The attractive Coulomb force acting on the electron is responsible for its centripetal acceleration,
which reads (in magnitude)
v2
r = Ze2
mr2 =⇒ r = Ze2
mv2 .
When combined with the quantization condition, this leads to
v = Ze2
n ,
and hence to the energy levels, given by (after substituting for r and v the expressions above)
E = mv2
2 − Ze2
r = −mv2
2 =⇒ En = −Z2e4m
2n22 = − (Zα)2mc2
2n2 ,
which turns out to give the (correct!) result obtained in Schrodinger’s wave mechanics. ¨
Problem 6 The Bohr–Sommerfeld Quantization Rule and the Harmonic
Oscillator Energy Spectrum
In the old quantum theory, one assumes that the particles follow the laws of classical mechanics but
one postulates further that, of all the possible solutions of the equations of motion, one must retain
only those which satisfy certain ad hoc quantization rules. One therefore selects a discontinuous
family of motions; these are, by hypothesis, the only motions which are realized in nature. The
discontinuous sequence of energy values thus obtained constitutes the spectrum of quantized energy
levels.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press13 1.1 Problems
For a one-dimensional periodic motion, the quantization rule, known as the Bohr–Sommerfeld
quantization rule, is

E
dq p = nh n = 1, 2, ... ,
where h is Planck’s constant – recall that  = h/(2π) – and the symbol 
E means that one must
integrate over a complete period of the motion corresponding to the energy E. Here q and p are the
position and momentum variables, respectively. The integral is known as the action integral. Apply
this rule to the case of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, for which
E = p2

Problem 7 An Application of the Bohr–Sommerfeld Quantization Rule
to the Hydrogen Atom
Quantize the circular electronic orbits of the hydrogen atom by applying the Bohr–Sommerfeld rule
introduced in the previous problem. Determine the energy, period, and radius of the quantized orbits.
Calculate specifically the numerical values of the energy, period, and radius of the lowest orbit. Use
mc2 ≈ 0.51 × 106 eV and c/e2 ≈ 137.
Solution
The energy of a hydrogen-like atom is given by
E = p2
2m − Ze2
r ,
where m and −e are the electron mass and charge; we assume that the nucleus of charge Ze is fixed at
the origin (we will neglect reduced-mass corrections). In a circular orbit the centripetal acceleration
of the electron is provided by the attractive Coulomb force, and hence
m
v2
r = Ze2
r2 =⇒ p2
m = Ze2
r ,
where r is the radius of the circular orbit; the magnitude p of the electron momentum is constant (but
not its direction, of course). The momentum corresponding to a given energy for such an orbit is then
given by
E = p2
2m − p2
m = − p2
2m =⇒ p = 
2m|E| ,
and the action integral for such an orbit follows from

r = −Ze2
2r =⇒ r = Ze2

Inserting this expression into the action–integral result and imposing the Bohr–Sommerfeld rule
yields

the electron rest mass. The result above for En turns out to agree with that obtained in Schrodinger’s ¨
wave mechanics. The radii of these circular orbits are quantized,

Problem 8 Heat Capacity of Solids
In addition to the failures in explaining the black-body radiation spectrum, the photoelectric effect,
and the stability of atoms and spectral lines, classical physics could not explain the heat capacity of
a solid.
1. Assume that a solid of volume V with N atoms (or molecules) can be modeled as a set of 3N
independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators of frequency ν0 (that is, all oscillators have the
same frequency ν0). Making use of the equipartition theorem, calculate the total average energy
E of the solid at temperature T and derive the Dulong–Petit law for the heat capacity (at constant
volume),
cV =
	
∂E
∂T


V
= 3N kB ,
where kB is Boltzmann’s constant.
2. The observed heat capacity of a solid is not in fact a constant independent of T but rather vanishes
as T3 at low temperature and only approaches the classical prediction (the Dulong–Petit law)
at high temperatures. Einstein (1907) proposed that the energy of each harmonic oscillator is
quantized and that its average energy at temperature T is given as follows:
average energy = hν0
ehν0/kBT − 1 .
Show that the heat capacity is now found to be
cV = 3NkB
x2
0 ex0
(ex0 − 1)2 , x0 = hν0
kBT .
Does cV vanish as T −→ 0 ? What happens at high temperature?
3. Einstein’s theory predicts that cV vanishes exponentially at low temperature, a result that is at
variance with experimental observations. A more realistic model of a solid is that it consists of 3N
independent harmonic oscillators (normal modes) with a distribution in frequency g(ν) given by
g(ν) = 4π
V
v3
S
ν2 ,
where vS is the sound velocity in the solid, such that
number of modes =
 νmax
0
dν g(ν) = 3N .
This condition fixes νmax as a function of the density N/V. Introduce the parameter TD (the Debye
temperature), defined as
TD = hνmax
kB
,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press16 The Failure of Classical Physics

E = 9Nhνmax 	 T

and that the constant-volume heat capacity is proportional to T3 for low T, in agreement with

Solution
Part 1
Each oscillator contributes kBT to the total average energy E of the solid held at temperature T,
and, since there are 3N oscillators, this total energy is simply 3NkBT, which immediately yields the
Dulong–Petit law given in the text of the problem.

Light exhibits both wave behavior (interference and diffraction phenomena) and particle behavior
(the photoelectric and Compton effects). The proposal that particles too could exhibit wave behavior
and that this wave–particle duality was in fact a property of matter particles was made by de Broglie
in 1923. He postulated that a particle of momentum p and energy E has a plane wave associated
with it of wave number k = p/ and angular frequency ω = E/. The de Broglie hypothesis found
experimental confirmation (Davisson and Germer, 1927) when diffractive phenomena were observed
in the scattering of a beam of electrons by a crystal. When X-rays are scattered by a crystal, intense
peaks of reflected light are observed. These peaks depend on the wavelength of the incident light
and on the incidence angle (Bragg reflection). The condition for Bragg reflection, which results from
constructive interference of the waves reflected by different crystal planes, is
2d sin θ = nλ , (2.1)
where λ and θ are respectively the wavelength and angle of the incident wave, d is the separation
between two adjacent crystal planes, and n is an integer (see Fig. 2.1). Davisson and Germer showed
that electrons scattered by a single crystal of nickel produced a diffraction pattern similar to that
observed in X-ray scattering by crystals.
2.1 Wave Packets
Following de Broglie, we represent the wave associated with a particle as a superposition (a wave
packet). In one dimension it is written as
Ψ(x, t) =
 dk
(2π)1/2 f (k
) eiϕ(k
) , ϕ(k
) = k
x − ωkt , (2.2)
and its generalization to three dimensions should be obvious. The generally complex function f (k
)
is such that its magnitude | f (k
)| takes on appreciable values only in a small region surrounding
k = p/; the factor 1/(2π)d/2, with d the number of dimensions, is introduced for convenience. The
condition ϕ(k
) = ϕ0, a constant, defines a plane of constant phase, which moves according to
xph (t) = (ωk t + ϕ0)/k , vph = x˙ph = ωk
k = Ep
p = p
2m , (2.3)
where vph is the phase velocity. The phase velocity depends on the wave number. Thus, different
wave-number components in Ψ(x, t) move at different phase velocities, in contrast with electromag￾netic wave components propagating in vacuum, for which the phase velocity is independent of the
wave number and equal to c. As a consequence, in matter waves there is a tendency for the original
coherence to be lost, and for the wave packet to become distorted in space as time goes on.

Fig. 2.1 Bragg reflection: d is the separation between adjacent crystal planes, θ is the incidence angle, and the path difference is
2d sin θ.
Since the function f (k
) = | f (k

) is appreciable only over a narrow range around k, the wave
packet Ψ(x, t), given by
Ψ(x, t) =
 dk
(2π)1/2 | f (k

will be negligible in this range if the phase factor ei[ϕ(k
)+δ(k
)] oscillates rapidly, since positive and
negative contributions in Ψ(x, t) will tend to cancel out. By contrast, if the phase factor hardly
oscillates around k ≈ k then Ψ(x, t) will be large. Indeed, the condition that ϕ(k

slowly around k implies that

It follows that |Ψ(x, t)|≈|Ψ(x − x0 (t), 0)|; that is, the wave packet that was concentrated at t = 0 in a
range Δx centered at x, is approximately concentrated at t in about the same range Δx but centered at
x + x0 (t).

2.2 Wave Mechanics
A free particle is represented by the wave packet
Ψ(r, t) =
 dk
(2π)3/2 f (k
) ei(k·r−ωkt) , (2.11)
and use of the de Broglie condition  ωk = 2k2/2m shows that it satisfies a partial differential
equation, known as the Schrodinger equation, ¨
i ∂
∂t
Ψ(r, t) = − 2
2m
∇2Ψ(r, t) . (2.12)
Since this equation is first order in time, its solution is uniquely specified by the initial condition
Ψ(r, t0) at some reference time t0. The physical meaning of the wave packet (or wave function,
hereafter) is that |Ψ(r, t)|
2 dr gives the probability of finding the particle in a volume element dr
centered at r. It is natural to define a probability density (probability per unit volume)
ρ(r, t) = |Ψ(r, t)|
2 (probability density) , (2.13)
which obviously must satisfy

dr ρ(r, t) = 1 , (2.14)
the integration being over all space (i.e., the particle is to be found somewhere!). In particular, Ψ(r, t)
must be a square–integrable function (note that the set of square-integrable functions forms a linear
vector space).
The requirement in Eq. (2.14) is independent of time. To verify this fact, consider
∂
∂t
ρ(r, t) =

∂
∂t
Ψ∗ (r, t)

Ψ(r, t) + Ψ∗ (r, t) ∂
∂t
Ψ(r, t) . (2.15)
From the Schrodinger equation, we have ¨
∂
∂t
Ψ(r, t) = − 
2mi
∇2Ψ(r, t) , ∂
∂t
Ψ∗ (r, t) = 
2mi
∇2Ψ∗ (r, t) , (2.16)
yielding
∂

ρ(r, t) =

= − 
2mi
∇ · [Ψ∗
(r, t)∇Ψ(r, t) − Ψ(r, t)∇Ψ∗
(r, t)] .
(2.17)
We are then led to define a probability current density j(r, t) as
j(r, t) = 
2mi [Ψ∗ (r, t)∇Ψ(r, t) − Ψ(r, t)∇Ψ∗ (r, t)] (probability current density) , (2.18)
so as to obtain a local conservation law for the probability,
∂
∂t
ρ(r, t) + ∇ · j(r, t) = 0 , (2.19)
which is formally identical to the local conservation law satisfied, for example, by the electro￾magnetic charge and current densities. However, in the present case, rather than a flow of charge
(or matter as in hydrodynamics), we are dealing with the flow of a “probability fluid.”
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press21 2.2 Wave Mechanics
Having established the local conservation law, we immediately obtain by Gauss’ theorem

dr ρ(r, t) =

dr
∂
∂t
ρ(r, t) = −

dr ∇ · j(r, t) = −

dS nˆ · j(r, t) = 0 , (2.20)
where nˆ is the outwardly directed unit vector perpendicular to the surface element dS. Since the
volume integration is over all space, the surface is obviously at ∞, and therefore the surface integral
vanishes, since Ψ(r, t) and hence j(r, t) vanish as |r| −→ ∞ (recall that the wave function is square
integrable). We obtain
d
dt 
dr ρ(r, t) = 0 =⇒

dr ρ(r, t) = constant . (2.21)
Given a wave function Ψ(r, t) we can calculate the average position of the particle at time t as
r(t) =

dr Ψ∗ (r, t) r Ψ(r, t) , (2.22)
where we have assumed Ψ(r, t) to be normalized:

dr |Ψ(r, t)|
2 = 1 . (2.23)
We note that the average position is time dependent, since Ψ(r, t) changes in time. The meaning of
this average is the following: if we make a large number of position measurements with the particle
always in the same state, represented by the wave function Ψ(r, t), then the average of these position
measurements is r(t). Similarly, the average of any function of position f (r) follows:
f (t) =

dr Ψ∗ (r, t) f (r) Ψ(r, t) . (2.24)
In order to evaluate the average momentum of the particle at time t, we need first to consider the
distribution of momenta p =  k associated with the wave function Ψ(r, t). To obtain this distribution,
we evaluate the Fourier transform
Ψ(p, t) =
 dr
(2π)3/2 e−ip·r/ Ψ(r, t) =
 dr
(2π)3/2 e−ip·r/

dr ei(p
−p)·r/ =

dp f (p
) e−iEpt/ δ(p − p) = f (p) e−iEpt/ ,
(2.25)
where we have used the δ-function property

dr ei(p
−p)·r/ = (2π)
3 δ(p − p) , (2.26)
and Ep = p2/(2m). We interpret f (p) e−iEpt/ as the momentum-space wave function Ψ(p, t) of the
(free) particle. The associated momentum-space probability density is then
|Ψ(p, t)|
2 = | f (p)|
2 , (2.27)
and is independent of time. Note that this density is normalized if the wave function Ψ(r, t) is
normalized (Parseval’s identity). The average momentum of the particle at time t is obtained as
p(t) =

dp Ψ ∗ (p, t) p Ψ(p, t) , (2.28)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press22 Wave–Particle Duality and Wave Mechanics
and is constant for a free particle,
p(t) =

dp p | f (p)|
2 . (2.29)
The average value of the particle’s momentum can also be calculated from the coordinate-space
wave function Ψ(r, t), by noting that
p Ψ(p, t) =

dr Ψ∗
(r, t) [−i∇Ψ(r, t)] . (2.31)
Therefore, in coordinate space we have p −→ −i∇, and so in this space the momentum is a
differential operator such that pΨ(r, t) = −i∇Ψ(r, t). By contrast, in momentum space the action of
p is to multiply the (momentum-space) wave function by the vector p: p Ψ(p, t).
While it is obvious from the calculation in momentum space that the average value of the particle’s
momentum is real (as it must be to have physical meaning), this can also be verified directly in
coordinate space, since
p(t) =

dr Ψ∗ (r, t) [−i∇Ψ(r, t)] =

dr [i∇Ψ∗ (r, t)] Ψ(r, t)
=

dr [−i∇Ψ(r, t)]
∗ Ψ(r, t) = p(t)
∗ . (2.32)
This property follows from the fact that, when viewed as a differential operator −i∇ acting on
square-integrable wave functions, the momentum operator is hermitian, namely, it satisfies

dr Ψ∗
1 (r, t) [−i∇Ψ2 (r, t)] =

dr [−i∇Ψ1 (r, t)]
∗ Ψ2 (r, t) , (2.33)
where Ψ1 (r, t) and Ψ2 (r, t) are any two (square-integrable) wave functions.
Of course, we can also calculate the average value of the particle’s position from the momentum￾space wave function, since inversion of the Fourier transform in Eq. (2.25) gives
Ψ(r, t) =
 dp
(2π )3/2 eip·r/ Ψ(p, t) , (2.34)
so that

Therefore the descriptions based on coordinate-space and momentum-space wave functions,
respectively Ψ(r, t) and Ψ(p, t), are completely equivalent. The position and momentum operators
are given in these spaces by
position momentum
coordinate space r −i∇

Problem 2 Diffraction of Neutrons by a Linear Chain of Nuclei
A beam of neutrons having energy E is incident on a linear chain of atomic nuclei. The chain is
perpendicular to the beam, as indicated in Fig. 2.2, and the nuclei are located along it at regular
intervals separated by a distance d, which is much larger than the radius of a nucleus. A neutron
detector is positioned far from the chain and in a direction making an angle θ with the direction of
the incident beam. Intensity peaks are observed at the detector (just as in Bragg reflection): under
what condition do they occur?
Solution
One expects to see peaks in the counting rate of diffracted neutron waves when the length difference
in the paths from two contiguous nuclei is a multiple of the wavelength associated with a neutron of
energy E. To determine this length difference, we refer to Fig. 2.2. By the law of cosines, we have
R2
1 = d2 + R2
0 − 2dR0 cos(π/2 + θ) = d2 + R2
0 + 2dR0 sin θ ,
and the length difference between the two paths is |R1−R0 | and we are given that d  R0. We find that
|R1 − R0 | = R0

1 + 2d sin θ/R0 + d2/R2
0 − 1

≈ R0 (1 + d sin θ/R0 − 1) = d sin θ .
Constructive interference occurs if
d sin θ = nλ n = 1, 2, ... , λ = h
√
2ME .
As the energy of the neutrons changes, peaks will be seen in the counting rate when the wavelength
λ matches this condition.
Problem 3 Bragg Reflection with Index of Refraction
Davisson and Germer, while carrying out their experiment on the reflection of electrons from a nickel
crystal, actually observed a slight deviation from the Bragg reflection formula, as if there were an
index of refraction μ > 1 in the medium. In this problem the reader can explain this deviation.

Fig. 2.3 Bragg reflection with index of refraction.
1. Begin by considering the reflection of two light rays by two contiguous crystal planes, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.3. Let μ be the index of refraction of the light in the crystal (the index
of refraction is 1 in vacuum), and let θ and θi be the angles in vacuum and in the medium,
respectively, as specified in the figure. Snell’s law of optics then states that cos θ = μ cos θi.
Knowing that the optical path length is defined as the geometric length times the index of
refraction, show that there is no difference in the optical path lengths of s (extra-bold line in
vacuum) and si (bold line in the medium).
2. Show that the difference in optical path lengths between the two reflected light rays is given as
follows:
difference in optical path length = 2μd sin θi ,
and that intensity peaks in the reflected light occur when
2d

μ2 − cos2 θ = nλ ,
where λ is the wavelength of the incident light and n is an integer (Bragg reflection taking into
account the index of refraction).
3. Now, consider the Davisson–Germer experiment. Assume that an electron in the medium sees,
approximately, a uniform attractive potential −|V|. If the energy E of the electron is conserved,
show that its wavelengths inside and outside the medium, respectively λi and λ, are related to
each other via
λ

Solution
Part 1
Referring to Fig. 2.3, we see that the segment s (extra-bold line) is the adjacent side of a right-angled
triangle with hypothenuse, say, b; the length of this side is b cos θ. The segment si (bold line) is the
adjacent side of another right triangle sharing the same hypothenuse, and its length is b cos θi. The

optical path lengths in vacuum and in medium are, respectively, b cos θ and μb cos θi. By Snell’s
law we conclude that these optical lengths are the same.
Part 2
The difference in the optical path lengths of the two light rays is given by 2μ times d sin θi, and the
condition for constructive interference becomes
2μd sin θi = n λ ,
which by Snell’s law can also be expressed as
2μd

1 − cos2 θi = 2μd

1 − cos2 θ/μ2 = 2d

μ2 − cos2 θ = nλ .
Part 3
An electron of energy E (which is assumed to be conserved) has momentum pi =
√
2m(E + |V|) in
the crystal and momentum p =
√
2mE in vacuum, The wavelengths of the associated waves in the
medium and in vacuum are λi = h/pi and λ = h/p, respectively, and hence
λ

and the condition for Bragg reflection of the electron waves is

E − cos2 θ = nλ .
Problem 4 Shape of a Wave Packet in Three Dimensions as a Function of Time
Consider the following wave packet in three dimensions:
Ψ(r, t) =
 dk
(2π)3/2 f (k
) ei(k·r−ω
t) ,
and assume that ω is some function of k
.
1. Suppose f (k
) is  0 only for k in a small region around k. By expanding ω in a Taylor series
around k = k up to linear terms in k − k, show that
Ψ(r, t) ≈ e−i(ω−k·∇k ω)t Ψ(r − ∇k ωt, 0)
where we have defined ω = ω
(k) and ∇k ω = ∇k ω
|k=k. Consider the shape of the wave packet
|Ψ(r, t)|. What does the relation above imply about the change of this shape with time?
2. From the relation obtained in part 1, deduce that the wave packet travels with velocity – the so￾called group velocity vgr – given by ∇k ω. Identifying this velocity as the velocity k/m of the
particle, where m is its mass, shows that
ω =  k2
2m
+ constant .

Solution
Part 1
To linear terms in k − k, we have
ω(k
) = ω(k) + (k − k) · ∇kω
(k
)|k=k + ··· = ω + (k − k) · ∇k ω + ··· ,
in the notation adopted in the text of the problem. Inserting this expansion into the expression for the
wave packet, we find
Ψ(r, t) ≈
 dk
(2π)3 f (k
) eik·r e−i[ω+(k
−k)·∇k ω]t = e−i(ω−k·∇k ω)t
 dk
(2π)3 f (k
) eik·(r−∇k ω t) .
At t = 0 the wave packet is given by
Ψ(r, 0) =
 dk
(2π)3 f (k
) eik·r ,
and we see that the magnitude of Ψ(r, t) is the same as that of Ψ(r − r0 (t), 0) with r0 (t) = ∇k ωt,
that is,
|Ψ(r, t)| ≈


= |Ψ(r − r0 (t), 0)| .
Thus, the shape of the wave packet is unchanged as time increases (of course, this is true only
under the approximation that higher-order corrections in the expansion of ω can be neglected). In
particular, if the wave packet was localized at a position r at t = 0, it will be localized at the position
r + r0 (t) at time t.
Part 2
The wave packet travels with the group velocity, given by r˙0 (t) = ∇k ω, which we identify with the
particle’s velocity k/m. It follows that
∇k ω =  k
m =⇒ ω =  k2

Problem 5 The Green’s Function for a Free Particle
1. Show that the wave function at time t for a free particle of mass m can be written as
Ψ(r, t) =

dr0 G(r − r0, t − t0) Ψ(r0, t0) ,
where Ψ(r, t0) is the wave function at the initial time t0 and the function G(r − r0, t − t0), known
as the free-particle Green’s function, is given by
G(r − r0, t − t0) =
 dp
(2π)3 ei[p·(r−r0)−Ep (t−t0)]/ , Ep = p2
2m .
2. Obtain an explicit expression for the Green’s function.

Problem 6 Dominant Contribution to the Free-Particle Wave Packet
The wave packet at time t for a free particle of mass m can be written as
Ψ(r, t) =

dr0 G(r − r0, t − t0) Ψ(r0, t0) ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press29 2.3 Problems
where Ψ(r, t0) is the wave function at the initial time t0 and the function G(r, t), known as the free￾particle Green’s function, reads
G(r, t) =
 m
2πit

.
Deduce from this that the main contribution to Ψ(r, t) comes from a region surrounding r whose
radius is of order √
2 (t − t0)/m.
Solution
It is convenient to make the shift in integration variable r − r0 −→ r0 to obtain
Ψ(r, t) =

dr0 G(r0, t − t0) Ψ(r − r0, t0) ,
where the Green’s function,

Ψ(r, t) to come from the region |r0 |  a0. We expand Ψ(r − r0, t0) in a Taylor series,

Because of the spherical symmetry of G(r0, t − t0), the only non-vanishing terms in the integral are
those having i = j; they each have the same value, so r0,i r0,i −→ r2

Problem 8 Probability Density and Probability Current Density as Expectation
Values of Operators
Show that the probability density and probability current density at position r0 can be expressed as

Problem 9 Wigner Distribution
Suppose that a particle is described by the normalized wave function ψ(r). The Wigner distribution
is defined as
W(r, p) = 1
(2π)3

dx eip·x/ ψ∗ (r + x/2) ψ(r − x/2) .
1. Show that W(r, p) is a real function of the (real) variables r and p (note that these are not to be
interpreted as the position and momentum operator).
2. Show that

dp W(r, p) = |ψ(r)|
2 ,
and that the expectation value of a function of the operator r is given by
f (r) =

dr

dp f (r) W(r, p) .
Solution
Part 1
We have
W∗ (r, p) = 1
(2π)3

dx e−ip·x/ ψ(r + x/2) ψ∗ (r − x/2) ,
and making the exchange x −→ −x yields
W∗ (r, p) = 1
(2π)3

dx eip·x/ ψ(r − x/2) ψ∗ (r + x/2) = W(r, p) ;
thus the Wigner distribution function is real.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press35 2.3 Problems
Part 2

 δ(x)

and the p-integral can be viewed as the inverse Fourier transform of δ(x); indeed,
δ(p) =
 dx
(2π)3/2 e−ip·x/ δ(x) = 1
(2π)3/2 and δ(x) =
 dp
(2π)3/2 eip·x/ δ(p) =
 dp
(2π)3 eip·x/ .
Thus, exploiting the δ-function, we have

dp W(r, p) =

dx ψ∗ (r + x/2) ψ(r − x/2) δ(x) = |ψ(r)|
2 .
This also implies that the average of f (r) follows as

dp f (r) W(r, p) =

dr f (r) |ψ(r)|
2 = f (r) .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press3 Schrödinger Equation; Uncertainty Relations
In this section we introduce the Schrodinger equation for a particle under the influence of a potential ¨
and Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations for the position and momentum operators (as a matter of fact,
for any two hermitian operators). Heisenberg’s relations put limitations on our ability to measure
simultaneously the position and momentum of a particle (or the observables associated with any two
non-commuting hermitian operators).
3.1 Schrödinger Equation for a Particle in a Potential
In a great leap of faith, which however, turns out to be justified a posteriori by the success of
the theory in describing correctly all quantum phenomena, we write the Schrodinger equation for ¨
a particle in a potential V(r), a real function of r, as
i ∂
∂t
Ψ(r, t) =

− 2
2m
∇2 + V(r)

 H(r,−i∇)
Ψ(r, t) , (3.1)
where the right-hand side is the classical Hamiltonian H(r, p) = p2/(2m)+V(r), with r and p replaced
by the corresponding operators. The resulting Hamiltonian operator is hermitian, which ensures that
its average (or expectation) value on Ψ(r, t) is real. The interpretation of the wave function is the
same as in the free-particle case, and
ρ(r, t) = |Ψ(r, t)|
2 , j(r, t) = 
2mi [Ψ∗ (r, t)∇Ψ(r, t) − Ψ(r, t)∇Ψ∗ (r, t)] (3.2)
represent, respectively, the probability density and probability current density associated with Ψ(r, t).
They satisfy the same local conservation law as that obtained in the free-particle case.
The time dependence of the wave function can be made explicit by setting Ψ(r, t) = ψ(r) φ(t) and
solving the Schrodinger equation by the separation of variables, to obtain ¨ Ψ(r, t) = e−iE(t−t0)/ ψ(r),
where ψ(r) satisfies the time-independent Schrodinger equation ¨
H(r, −i∇) ψ(r) = Eψ(r) . (3.3)
This partial differential equation can be viewed as an eigenvalue problem for the hermitian operator
H(r, −i∇). For its solution, we need to impose suitable boundary conditions on ψ(r). Since the wave
function must be square integrable for its probabilistic interpretation to make sense, we must have1
1 These boundary conditions are appropriate for bound states. Later, we will expand the class of wave functions by including
those that are only bounded as |r| −→ ∞ (typically, they oscillate at large |r|) and for which  dr |ψ(r)|
2 is not defined.
They will be interpreted as describing scattering states.

lim
|r|→∞ ψ(r) = 0 . (3.4)
Furthermore, ψ(r) and its derivatives ∇ψ(r) are continuous, unless the potential V(r) has an infinite
singularity as is the case for a δ-function potential or an infinite barrier potential. In such cases,
only ψ(r) is continuous; its derivatives are not. Once these boundary conditions have been imposed,
solutions are found only for specific values of E,
H(r, −i∇) ψn (r) = Enψn (r) , n = 1, 2, ... (3.5)
The solutions ψn (r) represent the eigenfunctions of the differential operator H(r, −i∇), and the
constants En represent the associated eigenvalues.2 The solutions satisfy a number of properties: (i)
since H is hermitian, the eigenvalues En are real; (ii) the eigenfunctions corresponding to different
eigenvalues are orthogonal, in the sense that

dr ψ∗
m(r) ψn (r) = 0 if Em  En ; (3.6)
and (iii) the eigenfunctions ψn (r) form a complete set (a basis),3 and so any square-integrable
function φ(r) can be expanded as
φ(r) =

n
cnψn (r) , cn =

dr ψ∗
n (r) φ(r) . (3.7)
Once an initial condition is specified,
Ψ(r, t = t0) = φ(r) , (3.8)
a unique solution Ψ(r, t) can be constructed by linear superposition:
Ψ(r, t) =

n
cn ψn (r) e−iEn (t−t0)/
 Ψn (r,t)
, (3.9)
with the cn as given in Eq. (3.7). Note that Ψ(r, t) satisfies the same boundary conditions as ψn (r).
The above treatment is in coordinate space. Because of the equivalence of the descriptions based on
coordinate- and momentum-space representations, however, we can write the Schrodinger equation ¨
in momentum space as
i ∂
∂t
Ψ(p, t) =

p2
2m
+ V(i∇p)

Ψ(p, t) , (3.10)
where ∇p denotes the gradient with respect to the p variables and V(i∇p) is the differential
operator resulting from the replacement r −→ i∇p. The coordinate- and momentum-space
wave functions are related to each other by a Fourier transform, again as in the free-particle
case.
2 A particular eigenvalue may have two or more independent eigenfunctions corresponding to it, in which case it is said to be
degenerate. 3 Mathematically, completeness requires that for any square-integrable φ(r)

3.2 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Relations
Along with the average value, it is useful to define the variance of r (or p) as
(Δrx)
2 =

dr Ψ∗ (r, t) (rx − rx)
2 Ψ(r, t) , (3.11)
and similarly for the other components (it is understood that the average and variance depend
generally on time).4 Note that (Δrx)
2 ≥ 0 gives a measure of the spread of rx values around the
average rx. Similarly, we define

Δpx
2 =

dr Ψ∗ (r, t) 
px − px
2 Ψ(r, t) . (3.12)
If we make a large number of measurements of rx and px with the particle always in the same state,
described by the wave function Ψ(r, t), the variances (Δrx)
2 and 
Δpx
2 give the spreads in values
(fluctuations or uncertainties) around rx and px. In this context, however, it is worthwhile pointing
out that, since the expectation value of any power p of the Hamiltonian on its eigenfunctions Ψn is
given by Hpn = Ep
n, the variance of the Hamiltonian on these states vanishes, and so the energy
value is sharp in Ψn; there are no energy fluctuations.
The uncertainties (Δrx)
2 and 
Δpx
2 depend on the state of the particle, and not on the instrument
and/or method of measurement, which in fact will introduce additional uncertainties. It can be
shown that
Δrα Δpα ≥

(Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation) . (3.13)
The above relation limits the precision with which a given component α of the position and
momentum of a particle can be measured simultaneously. However, it puts no a priori lim￾itations on the precision with which we can measure different components of the particle’s
position and momentum, say the x and y components, since in that case the commutator [rx , py ]
vanishes.

which A and B can be measured simultaneously.

are not orthogonal to each other, albeit each is assumed to be normalized.

and so the normalized wave function is given by
ψ 
2 (r) = 1

1 − |λ|
2 ψ
2 (r) .
We cannot have |λ| = 1 in this case, otherwise ψ2 (r) would differ from ψ1 (r) only by a phase factor
and therefore could not be an independent solution of the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the ¨
same eigenvalue E.
Part 3
We choose any two eigenfunctions, say ψ1 (r) and ψ2 (r), from the set and make them orthonormal,
proceeding as in part 2. We choose another eigenfunction, say ψ3 (r), from the remaining n – 2 and
construct
ψ
3 (r) = ψ3 (r) − λ1ψ 
1 (r) − λ2ψ 
2 (r) ,

where
λi =

dr ψ ∗
i (r) ψ3 (r) with i = 1, 2 .
It is easily seen that ψ
3 (r) is orthogonal to both ψ 
1 (r) and ψ 
2 (r). However, it is not normalized and
a straightforward calculation shows that

dr ψ∗
3 (r) ψ
3 (r) = 1 − |λ1 |
2 − |λ2 |
2 .
We therefore define
ψ 
3 (r) = 1

1 − |λ1 |
2 − |λ2 |
2 ψ
3 (r) ,
and ψ 
1 (r), ψ 
2 (r), ψ 
3 (r) form an orthonormal set. We now choose another eigenfunction, say ψ4 (r),
subtract from it its projections along the orthonormal set, and normalize it to obtain ψ 
4 (r); and so on.

Problem 6 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Relations: An Alternative Derivation
Let ψ(r) be a normalized (square-integrable) wave function, and consider
ϕα (r; λ) = (r
α + iλ p
α)ψ(r) ,
where λ is real, and, for α = x, y,z,
r
α = rα − rα , p
α = pα − pα ,
rα and pα being the expectation values of the operators rα and pα = −i∇α. Define the second￾order polynomial
Pα (λ) =

dr |ϕα (r; λ)|
2 ,
and, observing that Pα (λ) ≥ 0 for any (real) λ, deduce Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations
Δrα Δpα ≥ /2.
Solution
We have
Pα (λ) =

dr |ϕα (r; λ)|
2 ≥ 0 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press45 3.3 Problems
or, by inserting the expression for ϕα (r; λ),
0 ≤

dr [(r

α + iλp
α)ψ(r)]

[(r

Since r
α and p
α are hermitian, the above expression can be written as
(Δrα)
2 + λ2 (Δpα)

dr ψ∗ (r)

(p

where we have introduced the variance
(Δrα)
2 =

dr ψ∗ (r)[r 2
α ψ(r)] =

dr ψ∗ (r)[(rα − rα)

and similarly for (Δpα)2. We note that
p
α r
α − r
α p
α = (pα − pα)(rα − rα) − (rα − rα)(pα − pα) = pα rα − rα pα = −i ,
and, by exploiting the fact that ψ(r) is normalized, the above inequality reads

The above polynomial as a function of λ has a minimum when
P
α (λ) = 0 =⇒ λmin = 
2(Δpα)2 ,
and so
Pα (λmin) = (Δrα)
2 +
2
4(Δpα)2 − 2
2(Δpα)2 = (Δrα)
2 − 2
4(Δpα)2 .
Since Pα (λ) ≥ 0 for any λ, we must have Pα (λmin) ≥ 0, and therefore
(Δrα)
2 − 2
4(Δpα)2 ≥ 0 =⇒ Δrα Δpα ≥

Assume that V(r) vanishes as |r| −→ ∞ fast enough for its Fourier transform to exist. Note that in
the momentum-space Schrodinger equation, as given above, the term with the potential reduces ¨
to a convolution product involving the Fourier transforms V(p) and Ψ(p, t).

Solution
Part 1
Introduce the Fourier transform given by

In momentum space the position and momentum operators are given, respectively, by i∇p and p,

Problem 9 Formulation of the Schrödinger Equation for Ψ(r, t) = eiS(r,t)/
Consider writing the wave function as
Ψ(r, t) = eiS(r,t)/ ,
where Ψ(r, t) satisfies the Schrodinger equation in the presence of a potential ¨ V(r) and S(r, t) is
generally a complex function.

2m
∇2 S(r, t) + V(r) = 0 .
It is interesting to note that in the limit  −→ 0 this reduces to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of
classical mechanics.

2. Express the probability density ρ(r, t) and probability current density j(r, t) in terms of the real
and imaginary parts of S(r, t), denoted respectively as SR(r, t) and SI(r, t) with S(r, t) = SR(r, t) +
iSI(r, t). In particular, show that the wave function can be written as
Ψ(r, t) =

ρ(r, t) eiSR(r,t)/ .
3. By taking the real and imaginary parts of the equation for S(r, t) derived in part 1, show that this
equation reduces to a set of coupled partial differential equations for ρ(r, t) and SR(r, t), given by

3. The above equation looks like Newton’s second law but for average values. As a matter of fact, if
F = F(r) then r(t) changes in time as the position of a classical particle under the action of
the force F(r). Under what condition(s) can this happen? Obtain r(t) and p(t) for a particle in

Solution

Start from

where in the last step we have used the identity
∇ · ( f g) = (∇ f ) · g + f ∇ · g =⇒ f ∇ · g = ∇ · ( f g) − (∇ f ) · g ,
with f = rx and g = j. Now, the first term can be written as a surface integral with the surface at ∞
(Gauss’s theorem), and hence vanishes. Noting that the vector ∇ rx has components ∇ rx = (1, 0, 0),
we conclude that
d
dtrx (t) =

dr jx (r, t) .
A similar result holds for ry and rz, which proves that
d
dtr(t) =

dr j(r, t) .
Inserting the expression for j, we find that

Identical manipulations for the other components lead to
d
dtp(t) = −

dr Ψ∗ (r, t) [∇V(r)] Ψ(r, t) = −∇V .
Part 3
If the force is linear in r, as is the case for a particle in a harmonic potential, then F is proportional
to r(t) and the latter will change in time as for a classical particle under the action of the force F(r).
This will also occur, albeit approximately, if the magnitude |Ψ(r, t)| of the wave function is sharply
peaked at r0 (t), in which case r(t) ≈ r0 (t) and F ≈ F(r0).
For the harmonic potential given in the problem, the force is F = −m ω2r, and we have
d
dtr(t) = 1
m
p(t) , d
dtp(t) = −m ω2
r(t) .
One way to solve this set of coupled first-order differential equations is to introduce an auxiliary
function ξ(t), defined as
ξ(t) = p(t) + imω r(t) ,
from which we obtain (note that the averages are real)
p(t) = Re[ξ(t)] , r(t) = 1
m ω
Im[ξ(t)] .
The system of differential equations is easily seen (by taking the real and imaginary parts of both
sides) to be equivalent to ˙
ξ(t) = iω ξ(t), which has the solution (the reference time is t = 0)
ξ(t) = ξ(0)eiωt = [p(0) + imω r(0)] [cos(ωt) + i sin(ωt)] .
By taking the real and imaginary parts of both sides, we obtain
p(t) = p(0) cos(ωt) − mωr(0) sin(ωt) ,
r(t) = r(0) cos(ωt) +
p(0)
mω
sin(ωt) ,
and so in the harmonic oscillator the average values of the position and momentum operators oscillate
in time with angular frequency ω.

2. Now, switch to quantum mechanics, and interpret r and p – the position and conjugate momentum
of classical mechanics – as operators, with p = −i∇. Note that the scalar and vector potential
U(r, t) and A(r, t) are also operators, since they are functions of the particle’s position operator r.

electromagnetic field.
Hint: Several commutators need to be evaluated. The following identity, valid for any three
generic operators A, B, and C, is easily seen to hold,
[ AB , C] = A [ B , C] + [ A , C] B ,
and may be useful in the solution of this part of the problem. Also note that
[ A , B ] = −[ B , A ], [ p , F(r, t) ] = −i∇F(r, t) ,
where F is an operator function of the position operator (and possibly of time).

Bound States
In this chapter we review the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation. This is not just an academic ¨
exercise, as many problems of physical interest, for example the problem of two particles interacting
via a central potential (as in the hydrogen atom), ultimately involve the solution of a one-dimensional
Schrodinger equation. ¨
The time-dependent wave function is given by
Ψ(x, t) = e−iE(t−t0)/ ψ(x) , (4.1)
where ψ(x) satisfies the time-independent Schrodinger equation ¨

− 2
2m
d2
dx2 + V(x)

ψ(x) = Eψ(x) . (4.2)
The latter can be more conveniently written as
ψ(x) = [v(x) − ] ψ(x) with v(x) = 2m
2 V(x) and  = 2m
2 E . (4.3)
Note that  and v(x) have dimensions of (length)−2, since 2/m has dimensions of energy × (length)2.
Here, we are interested in solutions that either vanish or are bounded in the asymptotic regions
|x| −→ ∞; specifically, either lim|x|→∞ ψ(x) = 0 or 


ψ(x)


 ≤ M, where M is a finite nonzero constant.
The former solutions exist only for discrete values of  (the eigenenergy or, simply, the energy), are
square integrable, and correspond to the bound states of the particle. Their number can be finite or
infinite, depending on the potential. The latter solutions exist for a continuum of  values, are not
square integrable, and represent the scattering states of the particle.
4.1 Nature of the Energy Spectrum and General Properties
of the Eigenfunctions
Here, we recall some results regarding the nature of the energy spectrum for a generic potential v(x);
in particular, under what conditions discrete and/or continuous energies  are obtained. We also
briefly review some of the properties satisfied by the associated solutions. For definiteness, we
assume that v(x) is piecewise continuous, has an absolute minimum v0, and is such that
v± = lim
x→±∞ v(x) , v− ≥ v+ , (4.4)
where the constants v± can be zero (several potentials of physical interest satisfy these requirements).
No other assumptions are made on v(x).
61
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press62 The One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation; Bound States
We are looking for continuous solutions ψ(x) that are either vanishing or bounded as |x| −→ ∞.
The first derivative of ψ(x) can be expressed as
ψ
(x) = ψ
(x0) +
 x
x0
dx [v(x
) − ]ψ(x
) , (4.5)
which shows that ψ
(x) is also continuous, if the integral on the right-hand side is finite. This is
certainly the case for a potential v(x) with finite discontinuities (piecewise continuous) but not
for a singular v(x). For example, in the case of an infinite barrier v(x > a) = ∞, we require only
ψ(x ≥ a) = 0 and impose no condition on ψ
(a); in the case of a δ-function potential v(x) = v0 δ(x−a),
we require ψ(x) to be continuous at a but its first derivative to have a jump discontinuity, given by
ψ
(a+) − ψ
(a−) = v0ψ(a) , (4.6)
which can be easily derived from Eq. (4.5).
For a given , there are two types of x-regions that can occur:
region I, v(x) −  < 0 ; region II, v(x) −  > 0 . (4.7)
The nature of the energy spectrum, that is, whether it is discrete or continuous, depends on whether,
respectively, v(x) −  as x −→ −∞ and as x −→ ∞ are both of type II or not. It is only the asymptotic
behavior that is important. There are no acceptable solutions for  < v0, the absolute minimum of
v(x). The remaining three possibilities are: (1) v0 <  < v+; (2) v+ ≤  ≤ v−; and (3)  > v−.
We examine them in turn.
(1) v0 <  < v+. In the asymptotic regions x −→ ± ∞, the Schrodinger equation is obtained as ¨
ψ
± (x) = κ2
± ψ±(x) , κ± = √
v± −  . (4.8)
In each of these regions, the solution consists of a linear combination of increasing and decreasing
exponentials. However, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions that ψ±(x) vanishes as |x| −→ ∞,
we must require that
ψ±(x) = α± e∓κ±x as x −→ ± ∞ , (4.9)
where α± are constants. Since ψ(x) and its derivative are continuous, ψ−(x) and ψ+(x) must match:
given a point x0, we must have
ψ−(x0; ) = ψ+(x0; ) , ψ
−(x0; ) = ψ
+(x0; ) , (4.10)
where we have emphasized the implicit dependence on  of the solution. This matching can only
occur for certain values of  (or possibly not at all). The total number of allowed energies  depends
on v(x), and can be finite (possibly zero) or infinite.
Suppose that 0 < 1 < ··· < n < ··· are the discrete eigenenergies, and ψ0 (x), ψ1 (x), ... ,
ψn (x), ... the corresponding eigenfunctions. These eigenenergies are non-degenerate. Further,
ψ0 (x), the ground-state wave function, has no nodes (zeros), ψ1 (x), the first excited-state wave
function, has one node, ..., ψn (x), the nth excited-state wave function, has n nodes, and so on.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press63 4.2 Parity
(2) v+ ≤  < v−. In the regions x −→ ± ∞ the Schrodinger equations read ¨
ψ
− (x) = κ2
− ψ−(x) , κ− = √
v− −  , (4.11)
and
ψ
+ (x) = −k2
+ ψ+(x) , k+ = √
 − v+ , (4.12)
with
ψ−(x) = α− eκ−x x −→ −∞ , ψ+(x) = α+ eik+x + β+ e−ik+x x −→ ∞ ; (4.13)
namely, the solution vanishes for x −→ −∞ and oscillates (that is, it is bounded) for x −→ ∞. The
matching of ψ−(x) and ψ+(x) can now be satisfied by any value of  in the range v+ ≤  < v−,
since there are three available constants but only two conditions. These continuous eigenenergies are
non-degenerate.
(3)  ≥ v−. In the regions x −→ ±∞ the Schrodinger equation is given by ¨
ψ
± (x) = −k2
± ψ±(x) , k± = √
 − v± , (4.14)
with solutions
ψ±(x) = α± eik±x + β± e−ik±x , (4.15)
and ψ±(x) oscillate as |x| −→ ∞. Since the Schrodinger equation is a linear second-order differential ¨
equation, it admits two independent solutions,1 both of which are oscillating as |x| −→ ∞. We
conclude that each (continuous) eigenenergy  ≥ v− is doubly degenerate.
4.2 Parity
Consider a potential v(x) that is invariant under the parity transformation x −→ −x, that is,
v(x) −→ v(−x) = v(x) . (4.16)
As a consequence, the Schrodinger equation is also invariant under such transformation, ¨
d2
dx2 ψ(x) = [v(x) − ]ψ(x) −→ d2
dx2 ψ(−x) = [v(x) − ]ψ(−x) , (4.17)
and therefore ψ(x) and ψ(−x) are both solutions corresponding to the same . We can construct two
additional solutions by forming the linear combinations
ψe (x) = ψ(x) + ψ(−x) , ψo (x) = ψ(x) − ψ(−x), (4.18)
where ψe (x) and ψo (x) are, respectively, even and odd under parity, that is, ψe (−x) = ψe (x) and
ψo (−x) = −ψo (x). Two cases can then occur.
1 Linear independence of two functions f1 (x) and f2 (x) means that λf1 (x) + μf2 (x) = 0 is satisfied for any x in −∞ < x < ∞
iff λ = μ = 0. Equivalently, the two functions are linearly dependent iff the Wronskian W[f1 (x), f2 (x)] = 0 for any x in −∞ <
x < ∞ (just take the derivative of the above relation, and view the resulting equations as a linear system in the unknowns λ
and μ).
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press64 The One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation; Bound States
1.  is non-degenerate: the four wave functions ψ(x), ψ(−x), ψe (x), and ψo (x) are multiples of
each other. Thus, ψ(x) is necessarily proportional either to ψe (x) with ψo (x) = 0 or to ψo (x) with
ψe (x) = 0. We conclude that the ground-state wave function, being nodeless, must be even; the
first excited-state wave function, having one node, must be odd; and so on.
2.  is doubly degenerate: any eigenfunction can be written as a linear combination
αψ1 (x) + βψ2 (x) , (4.19)
where ψ1 (x) and ψ2 (x) are two independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same . Suppose
one of them, say ψ1 (x), has no definite parity. We can construct ψe (x) and ψo (x); neither of
these is zero, since ψ1 (x) has no definite parity by assumption. But ψe (x) and ψo (x) are linearly
independent, and therefore ψ1 (x) and ψ2 (x) can be expressed as linear combinations of ψe (x)
and ψo (x). In other words, the eigenfunctions of the degenerate spectrum can be written as a
superposition of ψe (x) and ψo (x).
4.3 Problems
Problem 1 No Acceptable Solutions for Energies Less Than the Minimum of v(x)
Suppose v0 is the absolute minimum of the potential v(x), that is, v(x) ≥ v0 for any x in −∞ < x < ∞.
Show that the Schrodinger equation admits no vanishing or bounded solution for ¨  < v0.
Hint: Consider the the sign of the ratio ψ(x)/ψ(x).
Solution
Given  < v0, the Schrodinger equation implies that ¨
ψ(x)/ψ(x) = v(x) −  > 0 in − ∞ < x < ∞ ,
and the curvature of ψ(x) is either up or down depending on whether ψ(x) > 0 or ψ(x) < 0,
respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 4.1. Furthermore, possible zeros of ψ(x) are inflection points.
Consider a point x0 such that, without loss of generality, ψ(x0) > 0 (if ψ(x0) < 0, multiply ψ(x)
by –1; this is permissible, since the Schrodinger equation is homogeneous). Draw a tangent at ¨ x0.

If ψ
(x0) > 0, then ψ(x) is always above the tangent for x > x0, and hence ψ(x) diverges as
x −→ ∞. If ψ
(x0) < 0, then ψ(x) is always above the tangent for x < x0, and again ψ(x) diverges
as x −→ −∞. In either cases, ψ(x) is neither bounded nor vanishing as |x| −→ ∞, and cannot be a
solution.
Problem 2 Degeneracy of the Energy Eigenvalues Corresponding to a Potentialv(x)
Show that the discrete eigenenergies corresponding to a potential v(x) are non-degenerate. Does this
hold for the continuum solutions that vanish at either −∞ or ∞? Justify your answer.
Solution
Suppose that there are two wave functions ψ1 (x) and ψ2 (x) corresponding to the same ; then
ψ
1 (x) = [v(x) − ]ψ1 (x) , ψ
2 (x) = [v(x) − ]ψ2 (x) .
Multiply both sides of the first Schrodinger equation by ¨ ψ2 (x) and both sides of the second by ψ1 (x)
and subtract one from the other, to obtain

We conclude that ψ1 (x) and ψ2 (x) are proportional to each other and, as such, are not independent
solutions of the Schrodinger equation. ¨
The same argument holds for the continuous energies corresponding to solutions that vanish, say,
at x = −∞: the Wronskian is zero in this limit, implying that ψ1 (x) and ψ2 (x) are proportional to
each other.

be satisfied since the left-hand side is positive and the right-hand side is negative. The identical
conclusion is reached if ψn (x) is taken to be nodeless and positive in [a, b]. Therefore ψn (x) must
change sign at least once in [a, b].
Problem 4 Coordinate- and Momentum-Space Bound-State Wave Functions
in a δ-Function Potential
Consider the problem of a particle in an attractive δ-function potential given by
v(x) = −v0 δ(x) v0 > 0 .
1. Obtain the energy and wave function of the bound state.
2. Calculate the probability dP(p) that a measurement of the momentum in this bound state will give
a result between p and p + dp. For what value of p is this probability largest?

Solution
Part 1
The Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ(x) = −[v0 δ(x) + ]ψ(x) .
A bound-state wave function vanishes as |x| −→ ∞ and is continuous at x = 0. What condition needs
to be imposed on the wave function’s first derivative? To obtain this condition, integrate both sides
of the Schrodinger equation over a small interval containing the origin, ¨

(−η) = −
 η
−η
dx [v0 δ(x) + ]ψ(x) = −v0ψ(0) − 
 η
−η
dx ψ(x) .
Taking the limit η −→ 0 yields
ψ
(0+) − ψ
(0−) = −v0ψ(0) ,
and the integral of ψ(x) vanishes, since ψ(x) is continuous. We conclude that the first derivative of
ψ(x) must have a finite discontinuity at the location of the δ-function.
To solve the Schrodinger equation, we split the real axis into two regions: ¨ x < a (region <) and
x > a (region >). In these regions, we have (recall that  = −|| is negative)
ψ
<(x) = || ψ<(x) , ψ
>(x) = || ψ>(x) ,
and, since ψ<(x) −→ 0 as x −→ −∞ and ψ>(x) −→ 0 as x −→ ∞ in order to satisfy the boundary
conditions at ∞, we find
ψ<(x) = α e
√| | x , ψ>(x) = β e−
√| | x .
We now impose the condition of continuity of ψ(x) at x = 0 and the condition on its first derivative,
to obtain
α = β , −β

|| − α

|| = −v0β .
The linear system for the unknown α and β has a non-trivial solution if the determinant of the
coefficient matrix vanishes, namely

|| − v0

|| − v0 = 0 =⇒  = −v2

and we find a single energy. The corresponding normalized eigenfunction follows:
ψ<(x) =
v0
2 ev0x/2 , ψ>(x) =
v0
2 e−v0x/2 .
The larger the value of v0 the more the wave function is localized at the origin.

Problem 5 The Schrödinger Equation in Momentum Space for an Attractive
δ-Function Potential
This problem deals with the solution of the the Schrodinger equation in momentum space. ¨
1. Solve directly in momentum space for the bound-state energy and wave function in an attractive
δ-function potential, given in coordinate space by v(x) = −v0 δ(x) with v0 > 0.
2. From the momentum-space wave function thus obtained, calculate the average kinetic energy of
the particle. Repeat the calculation of this average kinetic energy but in coordinate space, using the
wave function you derived in the Problem 4. Note that the first derivative of the coordinate-space
bound-state wave function is discontinuous at x = 0.

Problem 6 Inequality for Ground-State Energies Corresponding to Potentialsv(x) ≤ v(x)
Let ψ0 (x) and ψ0 (x) be the ground-state wave functions for a particle in potentials v(x) and v(x),
respectively. Assume v(x) ≤ v(x) for −∞ < x < ∞. Show that the corresponding ground-state
energies 0 and 0 satisfy 0 ≤ 0. What can you conclude for energies other than the ground-state
energy?
Solution
We have
ψ
0 (x) = [v(x) − 0]ψ0 (x) , ψ
0 (x) = [v(x) − 0]ψ0 (x) .
Multiplying the first equation by ψ0 (x) and the second equation by ψ0 (x) and subtracting one from
the other, we obtain
ψ0 (x)ψ
0 (x) − ψ0 (x)ψ
0 (x)  W(x)

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press71 4.3 Problems
The left-hand side of the above relation consists of the derivative of the Wronskian W(x) =
ψ0 (x)ψ
0 (x) − ψ0 (x)ψ
0 (x), and hence integrating both sides yields

dx [v(x) − v(x) − (0 − 0)]ψ0 (x)ψ0 (x) ,
where the left-hand side vanishes given that ψ0 (x) and ψ0 (x) are bound-state wave functions.
We arrive at
0 − 0 =
 ∞
−∞ dx [v(x) − v(x)]ψ0 (x)ψ0 (x)
 ∞
−∞ dx ψ0 (x)ψ0 (x) .
Note that, since ψ0 (x) and ψ0 (x) are ground-state wave functions, they are nodeless and can be
made to have the same sign (if they do not originally have the same sign then just multiply one of
the Schrodinger equations by –1). Thus, we have ¨
 ∞
−∞
dx ψ0 (x)ψ0 (x) > 0 ,  ∞
−∞
dx [v(x) − v(x)]ψ0 (x)ψ0 (x) ≤ 0 ,
where the second inequality follows from ψ0 (x)ψ0 (x) > 0 and the assumption v(x) ≤ v(x).
We conclude that 0 ≤ 0. Note that the above proof fails for energies other than ground-state
energies, the reason being that the presence of nodes in the corresponding wave functions ψn (x) and
ψn (x) does not ensure that the overlap integral of these wave functions is positive definite.
Problem 7 Particle in an Asymmetric One-Dimensional Potential Well
Consider the problem of a particle of mass m in a potential given by
v(x) = v1, x < 0 ; v(x) = 0, 0 < x < a ; v(x) = v2, x > a ,
where v1 > v2 > 0.
1. Discuss the nature of the energy spectrum.
2. Solve graphically for the energies of the bound states (if any).
3. Consider the case v1 = v2 = v and show that there is at least one bound state for any values of v and
a. How many bound states are there for a given v and a?
Hint: In part 2 you should find the equations
cot β = κ1/k , cot(ka + β) = −κ2/k ,
where β is a constant and the wave numbers are defined as
κ1 = √
v1 −  , κ2 = √
v2 −  , k = √
 .
The above equations have the solutions (verify this!)
β = n1π + sin−1 (k/K1) , ka + β = n2π − sin−1 (k/K2) ,
where n1 and n2 are integers, and we have defined the wave numbers
K1 = √v1 , K2 = √v2 .
After eliminating β, you should be able to carry out a graphical solution of the eigenvalue equation.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press72 The One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation; Bound States
Solution
Part 1
There are no valid solutions for  < 0. For 0 <  < v2 only bound states are possible, while for
 > v2 only continuum states occur, which are either non-degenerate if v2 <  < v1 or doubly
degenerate if  > v1.
Part 2
Assume 0 <  < v2. There are three regions: region I for x < 0; region II for 0 < x < a; region III
for x > a. We have
ψ
I (x) = κ2
1 ψI(x) , κ2
1 = v1 −  ,
ψ
II (x) = −k2ψII(x) , k2 =  ,
ψ
III(x) = κ2
2 ψIII(x) , κ2
2 = v2 −  ,
with corresponding (normalizable) solutions
ψI(x) = α1eκ1x , ψII(x) = α sin(kx + β) , ψIII(x) = α2e−κ2x .
We now impose the continuity of the wave function and its first derivative at x = 0 and x = a, to obtain
x = 0: α1 = α sin β , α1κ1 = αk cos β
x = a: α2 e−κ2a = α sin(ka + β) , −α2κ2 e−κ2a = αk cos(ka + β) ,
which imply
cot β = κ1/k , cot(ka + β) = −κ2/k .
To solve these equations, it is convenient to re-express them as
sin β = 1

1 + (κ1/k)2 = k
K1
, sin(ka + β) = − 1

1 + (κ2/k)2 = − k
K2
,
where we have used sin x = 1/√
1 + cot2 x and have defined the constants
K1 = √v1 , K2 = √v2 .
In particular, we observe that k/K1 and k/K2 are both < 1 here. In the intervals −π/2 ≤ β ≤ π/2 and
−π/2 ≤ ka + β ≤ π/2, these equations have unique solutions, given by, respectively, sin−1 (k/K1) and
− sin−1 (k/K2). However, the cotangent has period π, and hence the complete sets of solutions are
given by
β = n1π + sin−1 (k/K1) , ka + β = n2π − sin−1 (k/K2) ,
where n1 and n2 are integers. Eliminating β, we finally arrive at
ka = nπ − sin−1 (k/K1) − sin−1 (k/K2) ,
where n must be a positive integer, n = 1, 2, ... , for the equation to have a solution (the left-hand
side is positive). Note that the values of sin−1 lie in the interval [0, π/2]. The above equation can be
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press73 4.3 Problems
solved graphically; see Fig. 4.3. Since for bound states 0 ≤  ≤ v2, the wave number k must lie in
the range 0 ≤ k ≤ K2. We define
f (k) = ak , g(k) = nπ − sin−1 (k/K1) − sin−1 (k/K2) ,
and f (k) is a straight line with slope a while, for a fixed n, g(k) is monotonically decreasing function
of k with
g(0) = nπ , g(K2) = nπ − sin−1 (K2/K1) − sin−1 (1) = (n − 1/2)π − sin−1 (K2/K1) .
We see that if a is too small, there is no intercept and therefore no solution. For fixed a, there is in
general a finite number of bound states.
Part 3
When K1 =K2 =K, as is apparent from Fig. 4.3 there will be at least one solution for any K and a.
Note that in this case g(K) = (n − 1)π and so g(K) vanishes for n = 1. In the limit Ka  1, we must
have n = 1 and
ak = π − 2 sin−1 (k/K) =⇒ sin−1 (k/K) = π/2 − ak/2 =⇒ k/K = sin(π/2 − ak/2) .
Using sin(π/2 − ak/2) = cos(ak/2), in the limit aK  1 we can approximate as follows:
cos(ak/2) = cos(λk/K) = 1 − λ2

Problem 8 Particle in a Potentialv(x) = ∞ forx < 0 and v(x) = −v0 δ(x − a) forx > 0
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional potential v(x) such that v(x) = ∞ for x < 0 and
v(x) = −v0 δ(x − a) for x > 0 ,
where v0 is a positive constant. Determine whether this potential admits any bound states.
Solution
The Schrodinger equation is given by ¨
ψ(x) = −[v0 δ(x − a) + ]ψ(x) ,
and bound states, if they exist, occur for  < 0. The wave functions in regions 0 < x < a and x > a
are denoted, respectively, as ψ<(x) and ψ>(x). The boundary conditions are
ψ<(0) = 0 , ψ<(a) = ψ>(a) , ψ
>(a) − ψ
<(a) = −v0 ψ>(a) , limx→∞ ψ>(x) = 0 .
In the region 0 < x < a we have
ψ
<(x) = || ψ<(x) =⇒ ψ<(x) = α< sinh(

|| x) + β< cosh(

|| x) ,
and the boundary condition at the origin requires β< = 0. In the region x > a we have
ψ
>(x) = || ψ>(x) =⇒ ψ>(x) = α> e−
√| | x + β> e
√| | x ,
and the boundary condition at ∞ imposes β> = 0. The remaining boundary conditions yield

Problem 9 Particle in a Potentialv(x) = −v0 [δ(x) + δ(x − a)]: The Ionized H+
2 Molecule
A particle in one dimension is subject to a potential consisting of two attractive δ-functions, placed
at the origin and at x = a (this could be a model for the H+
2 molecule)
v(x) = −v0 δ(x) − v0 δ(x − a) , v0 > 0 .

Provide a graphical solution for this equation.
2. Denote by 0 = −v2
0/4 the energy of a particle bound in a single (attractive) δ-function potential
of strength v0. Show that the ground-state energy S of this system is less than 0. Further, show
that, if a is larger than a certain value a0, to be determined, there exists an excited state of energy
A > 0. How do S and A vary as function of a ? What happens in the limits a −→ 0 and
a −→ ∞ ? Explain why the ground- and excited-state wave functions are, respectively, even and
odd with respect to a reflection about the point x = a/2. Sketch these wave functions.
3. Justify in what sense the above system provides a rough model for the ionized H+
2 molecule, in
which the two protons, assumed to be fixed in space, are separated by a distance a. Include in the
total energy of the molecule the contribution of the Coulomb repulsion between the protons, and
discuss the variation of the total energy with respect to a. Argue why, under certain conditions,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press76 The One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation; Bound States
one can predict the existence of bound states of the H+
2 molecule, thus illustrating a mechanism of
chemical bonding.
Solution
Part 1
We define three regions: region I for x < 0; region II for 0 < x < a; and region III for x > a. The
wave function must be continuous at x = 0 and x = a, its first derivatives satisfying the conditions
ψ
I (0) − ψ
II(0) = v0ψI(0) , ψ
II(a) − ψ
III(a) = v0ψIII(a) .
The solutions are
ψI(x) = A eρx , ψII(x) = B e−ρx + Ceρx , ψIII(x) = D e−ρx .
Imposing the boundary conditions leads to the homogenous linear system,
A = B + C
Aρ − (−Bρ + Cρ) = v0A
B e−ρa + Ceρa = D e−ρa
−Bρ e−ρa + Cρ eρa + Dρ e−ρa = v0D e−ρa ,
which we rewrite as
A − B − C = 0

Fig. 4.5 Graphical solution of the eigenvalue equation; here,z = ρa. Two cases are shown: in one case av0/2 = z0 = 0.2 (dashed and
long-dash-dotted lines) and there is only one solution za, while in the other case av0/2 = z1 = 2.0 (dotted and
short-dashed-dotted lines) and there are two solutions,zb andzc.
Part 2
We introduce the variables z = aρ and z0 = av0/2. As should be clear from Fig. 4.5, there is always at
least one bound state, given by the intercept of e−z and −(1 − z/z0). The intercept za or zc in the figure
is such that ρ0 > v0/2, which leads to

where 0 is the ground-state energy of a particle in a single δ-function potential; indeed, a numerical
solution gives
S (a) ≈ 0

1 + e−av0
2 .
By contrast, there is no intercept of e−z with 1 − z/z0 unless the slope of 1 − z/z0 is larger than the
slope of e−z at z = 0, yielding the condition −1/z0 > −1 or z0 > 1 and hence a > 2/v0 ≡ a0. Thus, if
a < a0, there is no excited state, but if a > a0 then there exists an excited state with energy A > 0.
In the limit a −→ 0, we have v(x) = −2v0 δ(x), so that S −→ 40 and there is no excited state. In
the limit a −→ ∞, we have S = A = 0. The potential can be written as
v(x) = −v0 δ[(x − a/2) + a/2] − v0 δ[(x − a/2) − a/2] ,
which shows that v(x) is even under a reflection (x−a/2) −→ −(x−a/2). The (non-degenerate) bound￾state wave functions corresponding to this v(x) are either even or odd with respect to reflections about
a/2. Since the ground-state wave function is nodeless, it must be even whereas the excited-state wave
function, when it exists, must be odd. A sketch of the even and odd wave functions is provided in the
left-hand panel of Fig. 4.6.

Problem 10 Particle in a Potentialv(x) = −v0 δ(x) for |x| < a/2 and
v(x) = ∞ for |x| > a/2
Consider the one-dimensional potential
v(x) = −v0 δ(x) |x| < a/2
= ∞ |x| > a/2 ,
where v0 > 0.
1. Assume the particle’s energy  < 0. Show that there is a bound state if a certain condition is
satisfied.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press79 4.3 Problems
2. Assume the particle’s energy  > 0. Find the bound-state energies in this case (a graphical solution
of the relevant condition suffices).
3. Compare the bound-state energies found in part 2 with those obtained in an infinitely deep well
for which v(x) = 0 if |x| < a/2 and v(x) = ∞ if |x| > a/2. Comment on the results.
Solution
We denote −a/2 < x < 0 as region L and 0 < x < a/2 as region R. The boundary conditions are
ψL(−a/2) = 0 = ψR(a/2) , ψL(0) = ψR(0) , ψ
R(0) − ψ
L(0) = −v0 ψR(0) .
The potential is even under parity. We consider the cases  < 0 and  > 0 separately.
Part 1
For  < 0 the Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
L (x) = κ2ψL(x) , ψ
R (x) = κ2ψR(x) , κ2 = || .
The solutions in each region can be written as combinations of hyperbolic sine and cosine functions.
However, the boundary conditions at x = ±a/2 lead to
ψL(x) = AL sinh[κ(x + a/2)] , ψR(x) = AR sinh[κ(x − a/2)] .
The boundary conditions at the origin give
AL sinh(κa/2) = −AR sinh(κa/2) =⇒ AL = −AR
and
ARκ cosh(κa/2) − ALκ cosh(κa/2) = v0AR sinh(κa/2) =⇒ tanh(κa/2) = 2κ
v0
.
Define x = κa/2; the above condition requires that
tanh x = 4x
av0
,
and, recalling that tanh x ≈ x for small x, we see that there is always a solution if
4
av0
< 1 =⇒ v0 >
4
a .
The corresponding solution is found as the intercept x0 of tanh x with (4/av0)x, giving the energy
0 = −
4x2
0
a2 .
Part 2
For  > 0 the Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
L (x) = −k2ψL(x) , ψ
R (x) = −k2ψR(x) , k2 =  .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press80 The One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation; Bound States
The solutions in each region can be written as combinations of sine and cosine functions. However,
the boundary conditions at x = ±a/2 lead to
ψL(x) = AL sin[k(x + a/2)] , ψR(x) = AR sin[k(x − a/2)] .
The boundary conditions at the origin give
AL sin(ka/2) = −AR sin(ka/2)
and
ARk cos(ka/2) − ALk cos(ka/2) = v0AR sin(ka/2) .
These can be satisfied by either
AL = AR and ka
2 = nπ n = 1, 2, ... ,
which lead to the same n and ψn (x) with n even for the infinite well (see part 3), or
AL = −AR and ka
2  nπ n = 1, 2, ...
which require that
cot(ka/2) = v0
2k ,
or, in terms of x = ka/2,
cot x = α
x , α = av0
4 .
Note that cot x is periodic with period π, and a graphical solution of the equations shows that there
is an infinite number of intercepts. If α < 1, one solution is close to x = 0; if α > 1, this solution is
“pushed” into negative energy.
Part 3
In the absence of the δ-function potential, the (bound-state) energies would be
p = π2
a2 p2 , p = 1, 2, ... ,
with corresponding (normalized) eigenfunctions given by
ψp (x) =

p = 1, 3, ...

p = 2, 4, ... ,
Even when the δ-function is present, we note that the (odd-under-parity) wave functions ψp (x) with
p even satisfy the boundary condition at the origin and |x| = a/2. Therefore, p and ψp (x) with p even
must be the eigenfunctions found in part 2 (up to phase factors). Indeed, we have, for AL = AR = A and
ka/2 = nπ with n =1, 2, . . . ,

Problem 11 Particle in a Potentialv(x) = v0 θ(a − |x|) − w0 δ(x)
Consider the one-dimensional potential given by
v(x) = v0 − w0 δ(x) |x| ≤ a
= 0 |x| > a ,
consisting of a repulsive square well superimposed on an attractive δ-function potential. Note that
the potential is even under parity.
1. Explain why there cannot be bound states of odd parity.
2. Determine under what condition there is a single bound state (of even parity), and explain why its
energy is higher than the bound-state energy for the attractive δ-function potential alone. Show
that in the limit v0 = 0, that is, when there is no repulsive well potential, the bound-state energy is
that of a particle in the potential −w0 δ(x).
3. Provide a graphical solution of the eigenvalue equation.
Solution
Part 1
The Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ = [v0 θ(|x| − a) − w0 δ(x) − ] ψ(x) ,
where we have introduced the step function θ(z) = 1 if z > 0 and θ(z) = 0 if z < 0. Bound states,
if they exist, occur when  < 0. These bound states are necessarily even or odd under parity, since
the corresponding energies are non-degenerate. However, odd bound states are not possible given
that their wave functions must vanish at x = 0 and are therefore unaffected by the presence of the
attractive δ-function potential. This fact will become obvious below.
Part 2
In regions 1 and 2, defined by, respectively, x > a and 0 < x < a, we have
ψ
1 = ||ψ1 (x) , ψ
2 = (v0 + ||)ψ2 (x) ,
with solutions
ψ1 (x) = α e−κ1x , ψ2 (x) = βe−κ2x + γeκ2x ,
where we define
κ1 = 
|| , κ2 = 
v0 + || .
The even solutions in regions 3 (−a < x < 0) and 4 (x < −a) are obtained as ψ3 (x) = ψ2 (−x) and
ψ4 (x) = ψ1 (−x), while the odd solutions follow from ψ3 (x) = −ψ2 (−x) and ψ4 (x) = −ψ1 (−x). The
boundary conditions at x = a require ψ1 (a) = ψ2 (a) and ψ
1 (a) = ψ
2 (a), so that
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press82 The One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation; Bound States
α e−κ1a = β e−κ2a + γ eκ2a , −ακ1 e−κ1a = −βκ2 e−κ2a + γκ2eκ2a .

We will treat the even and odd solutions separately. The even solution is necessarily continuous at
x = 0, while its first derivative must satisfy
ψ
e,2 (0) − ψ
e,3 (0) = −w0ψe,2 (0) ,
which yields

functions. In this case, the condition on the first derivative gives

Thus, we conclude that there are no odd solutions, as anticipated.
Going back to the eigenvalue equation, we first note that the ground state, if it exists, should have
energy higher than 0 = −w2
0/4, which is the ground-state energy corresponding to the δ-function
potential −w0 δ(x). The latter is less than or equal to the present potential v(x) = v0θ(|x|−a)−w0 δ(x)
(see Problem 4.6). Note also that in the limit v0 −→ 0, that is, when there is no repulsive well
potential, we have κ2 −→ κ1 and the eigenvalue equation reduces to 1/κ1 = 2/w0 or  = 0.
We set

When the particle is only just bound we have  −→ 0−, and in this limit x −→ x0, so that the
eigenvalue equation reduces as follows:
f (x) −→ f (x0) = 1
x0 tanh x0

aw0

0 = 2
√v0 tanh x0 ;
for w0 =w
0 there is a bound state with energy 0−, and hence for w0 < w

Part 3
We provide a graphical solution of the eigenvalue equation; see Fig. 4.7. Note that the bound-state
energy approaches the limit 0 as 2/(aw0) −→ 0.

where the conditions  larger and smaller than v(x) characterize, respectively, the classically
allowed and classically forbidden regions.
2. Assume for the time being that  > v(x) and, by neglecting the term proportional to u(x) on the
r.h.s. of the differential equation for u(x), obtain the zeroth-order approximation
u0 (x) = ±

where C is constant. Obtain a better approximation u1 (x) for u(x) by substituting u(x) by u

in the r.h.s., that is,
[u


for  < v(x) ,
which also follows from the replacement k(x) = −iκ(x) in the solutions for the classically allowed
region.
3. The approximation outlined above is valid if u1 (x) is close to u0 (x). Show that this requires, in the
classically allowed region,
|k
(x)|  [k(x)]
2 ,
with a similar relation in the classically forbidden region. By introducing the x-dependent
wavelength (the “local wavelength”) for the de Broglie wave associated with the particle,
λ(x) = 2π
k(x) ,
show that the above condition can also be written in a number of equivalent ways:
|λ
(x)|  2π , λ(x) |p
(x)|  2π |p(x)| , λ(x) |V
(x)|  4π
[p(x)]
2
2m ,
where p(x) is the local momentum of the particle and V(x) = (2/2m)v(x) is the potential. What
does each of these equivalent conditions require? Explain. What happens close to a classical
inversion point? Recall that a classical inversion point is defined by the condition  = v(x).
4. The WKB approximation as formulated so far fails near a classical inversion point. Suppose that
x = a is such a classical inversion point and that x > a is the classically forbidden region and x < a
is the classically allowed region. Then, away from a we have the general solutions
ψ(x) ≈ A− √

for x  a .
Since ψ(x) must represent the same state, we need to relate the constants A± to B±. We cannot
impose the continuity of ψ(x) and ψ
(x) at x = a, since the above approximation breaks down
there. Proceed in the following way. Expand v(x) −  near the inversion point so that
v(x) −  ≈ g(x − a) with g > 0 ;
g must be larger than zero since the classically forbidden region is x > a. Consider the resulting
Schrodinger equation in the region ¨ x ≈ a. Show that it can be written as
d2ψ(z)
dz2 − zψ(z) = 0 ,
by introducing the auxiliary variable
z = g1/3 (x − a) .
5. Noting that for this linear approximation of v(x) −  the square of the wavenumber k2 (z) or κ2 (z)
is given by g2/3 |z|, show that the condition for the validity of the WKB approximation |k
(x)| 
k2 (x) established in part 3 is equivalent to
|z|
3/2 

1
2 .
6. The solutions of the Schrodinger equation ¨ ψ(z) = zψ(z) are known to be the Airy functions Ai(z)
and Bi(z). They behave asymptotically as follows:

where
ξ = 2

The next step involves matching the Airy functions to the WKB solutions obtained in part 4.
To this end, first show that, for v(x) −  = g(x − a),
 x

dx κ(x

x

Next, show that
ψ(x

Last, obtain the constants B± in terms of A± by matching the above wave function expressed in
terms in Airy functions to the asymptotic form for ψ(x  a) in part 4. Show that

By going through steps 4–6 it is easy to see that, when the classically forbidden region is to the

7. Consider a generic potential v(x), and assume that for any  in a given range there are only two
inversion points b and a with a > b and that the classically forbidden regions are x < b and x > a.
Then for x < b the WKB solution corresponding to a bound state must be

Part 2
The zeroth-order approximation u0 (x) results from neglecting u(x) on the r.h.s. of the differential
equation, which yields

We obtain a better approximation u1 (x) on replacing u(x) by u

0 (x) .
Note that

Part 3
For the approximation in part 2 to be valid, we require that |k

expressed as
k(x) = 2π
λ(x) =⇒ k

that is, the rate of the change of the local wavelength should be small. Using k(x) = p(x)/, where
p(x) is the local momentum, this requirement can also be expressed as
|p
(x)|


|p(x)|
 |k(x)| =⇒ λ(x) |p
(x)|  2π |p(x)| ,
which says that the rate of change of the local momentum over a length λ(x) should be small
compared with the local momentum. Last, using

 ,
we arrive at a different formulation for the validity of the approximation, namely
λ(x) |V
(x)|  4π p2 (x)
2m ,
that is, the rate of change of the potential over a length λ(x) should be much smaller the local kinetic
energy. Clearly, all these conditions become invalid in the proximity of a classical inversion point,
where v(x) =  and therefore |p(x)| = 0 and |λ
(x)| −→ ∞.
Part 4
Close to the inversion point x = a we expand v(x) in a Taylor series and keep only the term linear in x,
v(x) = v(a) + v
(a)(x − a) + ··· =  + g(x − a) + ··· ,
where g – the derivative of v(x) at the inversion point – is positive, since v(x) is an increasing function
of x (since v(x) >  for x > a). Thus
ψ(x) = g(x − a)ψ(x) .
In terms of the variable z, we have
d
dx = dz

dz2 − zψ(z) = 0 .
Part 5

For the linear expansion of v(x), we have

eigenvalue equation conform to your expectations?
Solution
Part 1
Bound states are possible for −v0 <  < 0. The Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
1 (x) = −(v0 − ||)ψ1 (x) 0 < x < a , ψ
2 (x) = (w0 + ||)ψ2 (x) a < x < b ,
and
ψ
3 (x) = ||ψ3 (x) x > b .
We define
k1 = 
v0 − || , κ2 = 
w0 + || , κ3 = 
|| .
After imposing the boundary conditions at the origin, ψ1 (0) = 0, and at infinity, ψ3 (x −→ ∞) = 0, the
wave functions are given by
ψ1 (x) = A sin(k1x) , ψ2 (x) = B eκ2x + Ce−κ2x , ψ3 (x) = D e−κ3x .
The continuity of the wave function and its first derivative at x = a and x = b yield the following
relations, respectively,
B eκ2a + Ce−κ2a = A sin(k1a) , B eκ2a − Ce−κ2a = A k1

and
B eκ2b + Ce−κ2b = De−κ3b , B eκ2b − Ce−κ2b = −D

To gain insight into the solutions of the above equation, it is convenient to define

In a scattering experiment a beam of particles is scattered by a target. The interactions between the
particles in the beam and those in the target occur in a small region of space. The regions where
the particles in the beam are prepared and where the scattered particles are detected are both well
outside the region where the interactions between beam particles and target particles are effective.
Therefore, the particles in the initial state (before entering the interaction region) and in the final state
(after passing through the interaction region) can be considered as free. Of course, we are assuming
that the interactions among the beam or target particles can be neglected. Thus, a scattering process
essentially involves the transition from an initial free-particle state to a final free-particle state.
Here, we consider the simple but instructive case of a particle under the influence of a potential
v(x) in one dimension. The particle can only scatter forward or backward. The question we want to
answer is the following: given v(x), what is the probability that the particle is scattered forward? And
backward? These probabilities will depend on the initial energy of the particle and, of course, must
add up to 1.
As before, we assume that v(x) is piecewise continuous with limits v(x −→ ± ∞) = v± and
v− ≥ v+. In the asymptotic regions x −→ ± ∞, the solutions of the Schrodinger equation for ¨  > v−
are given by Eq. (4.15), with α±, β± generally complex constants. The matching of the left, ψ−(x),
and right, ψ+(x), wave functions determines two of these four constants, say β− and α+, which can
then be expressed as functions of the remaining two, namely
β− = β−(α−, β+) , α+ = α+(α−, β+) . (5.1)
Two independent solutions follow by taking, for example, β+ = 0 and α− arbitrary, and α− = 0 and β+
arbitrary, which result in
ψ(+) − (x) = α− eik−x + β− e−ik−x , ψ(−) − (x) = β− e−ik−x , (5.2)
ψ(+) + (x) = α+ eik+x , ψ(−) + (x) = α+ eikx
+ + β+ e−ikx
+ . (5.3)
Physically, solution (+) and solution (−) correspond, respectively, to a particle traveling only to the
right or only to the left in the regions x 
 0 or x  0. The matching for solution (+) and solution (−)
leads to a determination of, respectively, the ratios β−/α−, α+/α− and α+/β+, β−/β+ as functions of k
(that is, of the energy ):
β−

= A(k) , α+
α−
= B(k) , (5.4)
α+
β+
= C(k) , β−
β+
= D(k) . (5.5)
In view of the discussion in terms of wave packets to follow, we will write the solutions as

= B(k) eikx

not normalizable; consequently, as such, they cannot be used to calculate probabilities. In order to
remove this difficulty, we introduce wave packets.

and positive for simplicity (this does not affect the following discussion in any significant way). The
function g(k) on the left in Eq. (5.8) has the property that it is non-vanishing only in a narrow interval
centered at k0 = √0 > k∗. Inserting the expressions obtained earlier, we find

(x, t) will also be continuous; it consists of three terms, labeled as incident (i),
reflected (r), and transmitted (t), which live in different regions of space. The incident and reflected
wave packets live in x  0 and the transmitted wave packet lives in x

with similar expressions for the reflected and transmitted wave packets. The function G[··· ] is largest
when its argument vanishes. For times t  0 (i.e., in the remote past), the center xi(t) of the incident
wave packet is in the region x  0 and propagates from left to right with constant velocity k∗
−/m.
On the other hand, the position xr(t) of the center of the reflected wave packet is large and positive,
and therefore outside the region where the expression in Eq. (5.19) is valid. Similar considerations
hold for the transmitted wave packet. Therefore, at t  0, Ψ(+)

By contrast, at t 
 0 (i.e., in the distant future), Ψ(+)
(x, t) consists of a reflected wave packet for
x  0 and of a transmitted wave packet for x

for t −→ ∞, Ψ(+)

Here, R(k0) and T(k0) represent the probabilities for the particle to be reflected and transmitted,
respectively, and
R(k0) + T(k0) = 1 . (5.27)
Proceeding similarly, we can show that the wave packet based on the solution (−) leads to reflection

For a potential that is invariant under parity, it is obvious that R(k0) = R(k0) and T(k0) = T(k0), but in
fact this remains true for a generic v(x) (it is related to invariance under time reversal; see
Problems 14 and 17).
5.2 An Alternative Treatment
Here, we present an alternative treatment of scattering that does not rely directly on the use of wave
packets. We begin with the two independent solutions derived earlier,
ψk (x) = eik−x

ψi(x)
+ A(k)e−ik−x
 ψr(x)

 ψt(x)
x 
 0 , (5.29)
and the similar one in Eq. (5.7) (we have dropped the superscripts distinguishing these independent
wave functions). In view of our previous discussion in terms of wave packets, we can interpret
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press98 Scattering in One Dimension
ψi(x), ψr(x), and ψt(x) as, respectively, the incident, reflected, and transmitted wave functions. The
full time-dependent wave function reads Ψk (x, t) = ψk (x)e−iωkt
. While Ψk (x, t) is not normalizable,
we can still evaluate its probability current density. It is time independent (we are dealing with a
stationary wave function) and is given by
j(x) = 
2mi

ψ∗
k (x)ψ
k (x) − c.c.

Inserting the explicit expression for ψk (x) yields simply

m
|B(k)|
2 , (5.32)
associated, respectively, with the wave functions ψi(x), ψr(x), and ψt(x). The minus sign in jr
is needed because the reflected wave is propagating from right to left. In the absence of time
dependence, the continuity equation requires
d
dx j(x) = 0 , (5.33)
that is, j(x) is independent of x and hence j(∞) = j(−∞), yielding ji + jr = jt. We define
R(k) = |jr|

and T(k) are in agreement with those obtained earlier in the analysis based on wave packets.

Solution
Split the real axis into two regions: x < 0 (region <) and x > 0 (region >). In these regions, the
Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
<(x) = −ψ<(x) , ψ
>(x) = −ψ>(x) ,
with boundary conditions at the origin given by
ψ<(0) = ψ>(0) , ψ
>(0) − ψ
<(0) = v0ψ>(0) .
The general form of these solutions is obtained as
ψ<(x) = α< eikx + β< e−ikx , ψ>(x) = α> eikx + β> e−ikx ,
where k =
√
 > 0 and α<, β< and α>, β> are constants. The boundary conditions for two of these
four constants, say β< and α>, can then be expressed as functions of the remaining two, namely
β< = β<(α<, β>) , α> = α>(α<, β>) .
Two independent solutions follow by taking β> = 0 and α< arbitrary, and α< = 0 and β> arbitrary,
which results in
ψ(+) < (x) = α< eikx + β< e−ikx , ψ(−) < (x) = β< e−ikx ,
ψ(+) > (x) = α> eikx , ψ(−) > (x) = α> eikx + β> e−ikx ,
corresponding to the outgoing waves in x > 0 and in x < 0, respectively. Next, we impose the
boundary conditions at the origin on each of these two solutions; for example, for solution (+) we get

in the region x < 0 only for t < 0. Its center reaches the origin, where the δ-function is located, at
time t = 0.
For the reflected and transmitted wave packets A(k) and B(k) are now complex, and the

It is easily verified that the wave packet formed with the solution (−) leads to the same R(k0)
and T(k0).
To elucidate further the physical interpretation of what is going on, it is useful to analyze the
situation first classically and then quantum mechanically. Classically, a particle approaching from,
say, the left, hits the wall at x = 0, and instantaneously inverts its direction of motion, moving
back towards −∞. The magnitude of the momentum before and after hitting the wall is the same,
|p| =
√
2mE. The particle cannot penetrate into the x > 0 region.
Quantum mechanically, the situation is rather different. The center of the incident wave packet
arrives at the wall at time t = 0. Then, when t is sufficiently large (t 
 τ), we see that the incident
wave packet has disappeared, and we are left with the reflected (for x < 0) and transmitted (for x > 0)
wave packets. The probability that the particle is in the classically forbidden region x > 0 is given by
T(k0). For a fixed energy 0, this probability becomes smaller and smaller as the strength v0 of the
δ-function potential increases. In contrast with the classical case, the particle has a finite probability
of penetrating the region x > 0 (the tunneling effect).
The reflected and transmitted wave packets propagate towards the left and right with velocities
−k0/m and +k0/m, respectively. A time delay is introduced between the reflected and transmitted
wave packets. Contrary to what is predicted by classical mechanics, the particle is not instantaneously
reflected by the wall. It is as if the particle “hangs around” in a region of approximate size (k0/m)τ
before being reflected and transmitted.
Problem 2 Study of the Potential Step
Consider the potential step
V(x) = 0 x < 0
= V0 x ≥ 0 ,
with V0 > 0. Describe the classical motion of a particle of mass m approaching the potential step
from the far left (x < 0) with momentum p. Distinguish two cases:
case (a), V0 < E ; case (b), 0 < E < V0 ,
where E is the energy of the particle. What are its velocities in the two cases? Next analyze the
problem quantum mechanically.
1. Discuss the expected energy spectrum.
2. Obtain the reflection and transmission probabilities in case (a) from the incident, reflected, and
transmitted probability current densities.
3. Do the same for case (b). What are the reflection and transmission probabilities in this case?
Discuss the result.
4. Repeat the calculation in part 2 of the problem for case (a), utilizing wave packets defined as
Ψ(x, t) =
 ∞
0
dk
√
2π
g(k) ψk (x) e−iωkt , ωk = k2
2m ,
where the profile function g(k) is real and non-vanishing in a small interval centered at k∗ > k0 = √v0, and ψk (x) is one of the (two) independent solutions that you found in part 2. It is to be
assumed that

|g(k)|
2 = 1 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press103 5.3 Problems
5. Work out what happens in case (b), utilizing wave packets for the incident and reflected waves
(there is no transmitted wave packet in this case). Assume the profile function to be sharply peaked
at k∗ with 0 < k∗ < k0. Note that the reflected wave packet becomes appreciable only after a time
delay τ. Calculate τ and provide a physical interpretation.
Solution
In case (a), the (classical) particle will suffer an instantaneous deceleration at x = 0 upon entering the
region x > 0 where the potential is effective. In x > 0 the energy of the particle will be mv2/2 =
E−V0 = mv2/2−V0 and its velocity will be v = 
v2 − 2 V0/m. It will continue to travel with constant
velocity v towards x = ∞.
In case (b) the particle will be reflected at x = 0, inverting the direction of motion and traveling
towards x = −∞ with the same speed v as it had initially.
Part 1
In both cases only continuum solutions with E > 0 are obtained. They are doubly degenerate in case
(a) and non-degenerate in case (b).
Part 2
We split the real axis into two regions: x < 0 (region <) and x > 0 (region >). In these regions, the
Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
<(x) = −k2ψ<(x) , ψ
>(x) = −K2ψ>(x) ,
where we have defined
k2 = 2mE
2 =  , K2 = 2m(E − V0)
2 =  − v0 .
The wave function and its first derivative must be continuous at the origin, since the potential is
non-singular (as a matter of fact, it is piecewise continuous),
ψ<(0) = ψ>(0) , ψ
<(0) = ψ
>(0) .
We take the two independent solutions as
ψ(+) < (x) = α< eikx + β< e−ikx , ψ(−) < (x) = β< e−ikx ,
ψ(+) > (x) = α> eiKx , ψ(−) > (x) = α> eiKx + β> e−iKx ,
and impose boundary conditions at the origin on each of these two solutions; for example, on solution

K =

Part 3
We have continuum non-degenerate solutions in the energy range: 0 < E < V0. The Schrodinger ¨
equation reads
ψ
<(x) = −k2ψ<(x) , ψ
>(x) = κ2ψ>(x) ,
where
k2 = 2mE
2 , κ2 = 2m(V0 − E)
2 = k2
0 − k2 .
The general form of the solution is obtained as
ψ<(x) = α< eikx + β< e−ikx , ψ>(x) = β> e−κx ,
since the wave function must vanish at x −→ ∞. Imposing the continuity condition for ψ(x) and
ψ
(x) at the origin, we find
β< = k − iκ
k + iκ
α< , β> = 2 k
k + iκ
α< .
Dropping the irrelevant constant α<, we can express the solution as
ψk (x) = eikx

ψi(x)
+ C(k) e−ikx
 ψr(x)
x < 0
= D(k) e−κx
 ψt(x)
x > 0 ,
where
C(k) = k − iκ
k + iκ , D(k) = 2 k
k + iκ .
Note that, apart from the complex constant D(k), the transmitted wave function is real, and therefore
its current density vanishes. There is no transmitted wave function. On the other hand, we find
ji = k
m , jr = − k
m
|C(k)|
2 = −k
m ,
since C(k) has unit magnitude and is just a phase factor. Thus in this case R(k) = 1 independently
of the energy. As in classical mechanics, the particle is always reflected. However, there is a finite
probability for the particle to be found in the region x > 0, since
|ψ>(x)|
2 ∝ e−2κx .
This probability becomes negligible when x 
 1/(2κ).
Part 4
We insert the explicit expression for ψ(+)
k (x) found earlier in part 2 in order to obtain the wave
packet; we will consider only the wave packet associated with this solution, as the treatment of the
wave packet associated with solution (−) is similar. We have

Since Ψ(+)
(x, t) is a linear superposition of the ψ(+)

the origin; it consists of three terms, to be labeled incident (i), reflected (r), and transmitted (t).
In the present case the constants A(k) and B(k) are real, as is the function g(k). Using the stationary
phase method, we find that the centers of the incident, reflected, and transmitted wave packets are,
respectively, at

C(k) can be expressed as follows:

Therefore, the reflected wave packet becomes appreciable only after a time delay τ, that is, its center
is at x < 0 for t > τ. In the time interval τ, the reflected wave packet tunnels into the (classically
forbidden) x > 0 region and then tunnels back into the (classically allowed) x < 0 region, covering
a distance of the order (k∗/m)τ/2 = 1/κ∗. This distance is of the same order as the distance 1/(2κ∗)
over which the probability density for the particle in the classically forbidden region is appreciable.

Problem 4 Finite Barrier: Tunneling, Transmission, and Transit Time
Calculate the transmission probability for a particle in a potential that is given by v(x) = 0 for x < 0
and x > a and is equal to a constant v0 > 0 for 0 < x < a. Consider the two cases 0 <  < v0 and
 > v0. Discuss the motion of a classical particle in the two cases.
By introducing wave packets, calculate the transit time – the time needed to traverse the barrier
– of the transmitted wave for the two cases 0 <  < v0 and  > v0 and compare it with that for a
classical particle.
Solution
The case 0 <  < v0. We have three regions: region I for x < 0, region II for 0 < x < a, and region
III for x > a. In these regions the Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
I (x) = −k2ψI(x) k2 =  > 0 , ψ
II (x) = κ2ψII(x) κ2 = v0 −  > 0 ,
and
ψ
III(x) = −k2ψIII(x) ,
with solutions
ψI(x) = eikx + A e−ikx , ψII(x) = C cosh(κx) + D sinh(κx) , ψIII(x) = B eik(x−a) ,
where the incident wave is from the left and the transmitted wave to the right. The transmission
coefficient is given by
T = |B e−ika |
2 = |B|
2 ,
which follows from evaluating the incident (ji) and transmitted (jt) probability flux T = |jt|/|ji|.
We impose the following boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = a,
1 + A = C
1 − A = −i
κ
k D
B = C cosh(κa) + D sinh(κa)
i
k
κ
B = C sinh(κa) + D cosh(κa) .
We solve the last two equations with respect to C and D,


B ,
D =

and substitute these expressions into the first two of the equations to find

B .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press111 5.3 Problems
We solve these with respect to B:
B = 2
2 cosh(κa) + i(κ/k − k/κ) sinh(κa) .
Finally, the transmission coefficient is obtained as
T = 4
4 cosh2 (κa) + (κ/k − k/κ)2 sinh2 (κa)
= 4
4 + [(κ/k − k/κ)2 + 4] sinh2 (κa)
,
which can be written as
T() = 4(v0 − )
4(v0 − ) + v2
0 sinh2 (
√v0 −  a)
,
since (κ/k − k/κ)2 + 4 = v0/[(v0 − )]. The transmission coefficient vanishes at  = 0, and increases
as  increases, reaching a maximum at  = v0 with
T(v0) = 1
1 + v0a2/4 ,
where we have used sinh2 (
√v0 −  a) ≈ (v0 − )a2 as  −→ v0.
The case  > v0. The procedure above can be repeated in this case. The solution in region II now
involves sine and cosine functions. However, we can obtain the transmission coefficient in the present
case by observing that
κ −→ iK K = √ − v0 ,
which leads to
T = 4
4 + [(iK/k + ik/K)2 + 4] sinh2 (iKa)
.
Note that
sinh(ix) =

(ix)2k+1
(2k + 1)! = i

k=0

2k x2k+1

and
4 + (iK/k + ik/K)
2 = 4 − (K/k + k/K)
2 = − v2
0
( − v0) .
We finally arrive at
T() = 4 ( − v0)
4 ( − v0) + v2
0 sin2 (
√ − v0 a)
,
and we see that T() oscillates between a minimum value equal to T(v0), obtained earlier, and unity.
The transmission is equal to unity at energies such that
T(n) = 1 =⇒ n = v0 +
n2π2
a2 n = 1, 2, ...
It is interesting to compare the motion of a classical particle and that of a quantum particle. If the
energy in the former case is less than the height of the barrier, the classical particle rebounds from
the barrier without being able to penetrate it. By contrast, the wave packet describing the quantum
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press112 Scattering in One Dimension
particle splits into a reflected and a transmitted wave packet, whose intensity never vanishes. As the
energy increases from 0 to v0 the transmission coefficient increases from 0 to the maximum T(v0).
The quantum particle has a finite probability of penetrating the barrier and “materializing” on the
other side. This is the tunneling effect. Such an effect plays a role, for example, in the theory of α
emission by nuclei (α radioactivity).
On the other hand, if the classical particle has energy larger than the height of the barrier, it will
traverse it and travel beyond it. Assuming it is approaching the barrier from the left, the particle will
suffer a sudden deceleration at the origin and a sudden acceleration at x = a, which will restore the
original velocity. It will then travel with this velocity to +∞. This is very different from the quantum
description, in which the wave packet will almost always be partially reflected, the exception being
when the particle energy is n, for n = 1, 2, ... , in which case T(n) = 1 and there is no reflected
wave packet.
The transmitted wave packet for k < k0 in the region x > a has the form
Ψt(x, t) =
 k0

√
2π
g(k) B(k) ei[k(x−a)−ωkt] x > a ,

.
Using the stationary phase method, where the phase is
ϕ(k) = k(x − a) + δ(k) − ωkt ,
we find from ϕ
(k∗) = 0 that the center xt(t) of the transmitted wave packet is given by
xt(t) = a +

g(k) ei(kx−ωkt) x < 0 ,
and the center of the incident wave packet reaches the barrier (x = 0) at time t = 0. Thus we interpret
τ as the time for the particle to materialize on the other side of the barrier at x = a. We expect τ to
become larger and larger as the energy ∗ approaches 0. We are left with the evaluation of δ
(k∗).

(∗ −→ 0) is a constant, it takes an infinite time for the transmitted wave to materialize on

Problem 6 Bound- and Scattering-State Problems in a Potential
v(x) = v0θ(−x) − w0δ(x)
Consider a particle of mass m under the action of a potential given by
v(x) = v0θ(−x) − w0δ(x) ,
where θ(z) = 1 if z > 0 and 0 otherwise.
1. Show that the presence of the potential step of height v0 does not alter the boundary conditions
that the wave function and its first derivative must satisfy at x = 0. Is there a bound state? If there
is, what is its energy?
2. Assume  > v0. Calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients. Find expressions for these
coefficients in the limit  
 v0,w0.
3. Now, assume 0 <  < v0. Calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients in this case.
Explain why you could have anticipated the result.
Solution
Part 1
In regions 1 and 2, defined, respectively, as x < 0 and x > 0, the Schrodinger equation reads ¨
ψ
1 (x) = (|| + v0)ψ1 (x) , ψ
2 (x) = ||ψ2 (x) ,
where  < 0 for bound states. We define κ1 =
√
|| + v0 and κ2 =
√
||, and obtain
ψ1 (x) = α eκ1x , ψ2 (x) = β e−κ2x ,
with boundary conditions
ψ1 (0) = ψ2 (0) , ψ
2 (0) − ψ
1 (0) = −w0ψ2 (0) .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press117 5.3 Problems
We note that the presence of the step potential v0θ(−x) does not alter the condition on the first
derivative; indeed, integrating the Schrodinger equation over a small interval around the origin, ¨
 η
−η
dx ψ(x) =
 η
−η
[−w0δ(x) + v0θ(−x) − ]ψ(x) ,
yields
ψ
(η) − ψ
(−η) = −w0ψ(0) + v0
 0
−η
dx ψ(x) − 
 η
−η
dx ψ(x)
and hence, in the limit η −→ 0, the jump discontinuity of the first derivative.
The boundary conditions lead to a homogeneous system in α and β given by
α − β = 0 , α +
	
κ2
κ1
− w0
κ1


β = 0 ,
which has non-trivial solutions if
κ1 + κ2 = w0 =⇒ 
|| + v0 +

|| = w0 .
Squaring the above expression twice yields the bound-state energy
 = −
(w2
0 − v0)2
4w2
0
.
In the limit v0 = 0, or w0 
 √v0,  reduces to the well-known result for the attractive δ-function
potential, as expected.
Part 2
It is assumed that  > v0. We consider the case of an incident wave approaching from the right (from
region 2, having x > 0). The solution of the Schrodinger equation is given by ¨
ψ1 (x) = Ce−ik
x , ψ2 (x) = A e−ikx + B eikx ,
where
k = √
 , k = √ − v0 =

k2 − v0 .
The boundary conditions at the origin yield
A + B = C , −ik(A − B) + ik
C = −w0C ,
which, when solved with respect to the incident-wave amplitude, give
B = k − k + iw0
k + k − iw0
A , C = 2 k
k + k − iw0
A .
The incident, reflected, and transmitted probability current densities are obtained as
ji = −k
m
A , jr = k
m
B , jt = −k
m
C ,
and the reflection and transmission coefficients follow from

and so
R ≈ w2

4k2 −→ 0 , T ≈ 4k2
4k2 + w2

−→ 1 .
Part 3
Now, it is assumed that 0 <  < v0, which implies the solutions
ψ1 (x) = Ceκx , ψ2 (x) = A e−ikx + B eikx ,
where
κ = √
v0 −  =

v0 − k2 .
The probability current density associated with the transmitted wave vanishes, since (up to the
possibly complex constant C) ψ1 (x) is real. Hence, we must have ji + jr = 0 (by the conservation
of j). As a consequence, the reflection coefficient is unity for any energy in this range. The values
of B and C follow from those of part 2 by simply making the replacement −ik −→ κ or k −→ iκ,
so that
B = k − i(κ − w0)
k + i(κ − w0)
A , C = 2k
k + i(κ − w0)

and it should be noted that B differs from A just by a phase factor, since

Problem 7 Wave Functions for a Potentialv(x < 0) = ∞ and v(x > 0) = −v0θ(a − x)
Consider the one-dimensional potential v(x) given by
v(x < 0) = ∞ , v(0 < x < a) = −v0 , v(x > a) = 0 ,
with v0 > 0.
1. Discuss the energy spectrum: for what energies (if any) are there bound states? For what energies
are there continuum states? What is the degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues?
2. Assume the energy  of the particle is less than zero. Determine under what conditions there is at
least a bound state.
3. Show that for x > a the positive energy solution (up to an overall constant) can be written as
ψ>(x) = ei[k(x−a)−2δ] + e−ik(x−a) .
Determine δ and the solution ψ<(x) in 0 < x < a (up to an overall constant). Calculate the
reflection coefficient.

where the real function g(k) is sharply peaked at k0. Examine the incident and reflected wave
packets in the region x > a, and show that the incident wave packet reaches the edge of the
potential well at x = a at time t = 0, while the reflected wave packet leaves this edge after a time
delay τ. Calculate τ and show that it is given by

Solution
Part 1
Bound states are possible for energies −v0 <  < 0; continuum states occur for  > 0. The whole
(discrete and continuous) spectrum is non-degenerate.
Part 2
Let ψ<(x) and ψ>(x) be the wave functions in the regions 0 < x < a and x > a, respectively. They
satisfy the Schrodinger equations: ¨
ψ
<(x) = −(v0 − ||)ψ<(x) , ψ
>(x) = ||ψ<(x) ,
where for bound states −v0 <  < 0. Define k = √
v0 − || and κ = √
||, so that
ψ<(x) = A sin(kx) , ψ>(x) = B e−κx ,
where we have imposed the boundary condition ψ<(0) = 0 and ψ>(x −→ ∞) = 0. The continuity of
ψ(x) and its first derivative at x = a require
A sin(ka) = B e−κa , Ak cos(ka) = −Bκ e−κa ,
and the (possible) eigenvalues  are found from
tan(ka) = − k
κ .
Set x = ka and hence κa =

x2
0 − x2 with x2
0 = a2v0, and the above equation reduces to
tan x = − x

x2
0 − x2
0 < x < x0 .
A rough plot of the left- and right-hand sides of this relation shows that for at least a single bound
state to occur we must have x0 > π/2. As a matter of fact, if x0 exceeds (2N − 1)π/2 with N integer
there are N bound states. Having determined the solution x
n for the above equation with 1 ≤ n ≤ N,
the bound-state energy results from
ka = 
v0 − || a = x
n =⇒ n = −v0 + (x
n /a)
2 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press120 Scattering in One Dimension
Part 3
For energies  > 0 (the continuum solutions), the Schrodinger equations read ¨
ψ
<(x) = −( + v0)ψ<(x) , ψ
>(x) = −ψ<(x) .
They have the solutions
ψ<(x) = A sin(Kx) , ψ>(x) = B eik(x−a) + Ce−ik(x−a) ,
where
K = √
 + v0 , k = √
 ,
and the requirement ψ<(0) = 0 has already been imposed. The boundary conditions at a give

C = sin(Ka) − i(K/k) cos(Ka)
sin(Ka) + i(K/k) cos(Ka) .
Note that the ratio B/C is just a phase factor, B/C = e−2iδ, and
tan δ = K
k cot(Ka) .
Up to the overall constant C the solution is obtained as
ψ<(x) = 2 e−iδ

sin2 (Ka) + (K/k)2 cos2 (Ka)

The incident and reflected probability currents in the region x > 0 are given by

yielding a reflection coefficient
R = |jr|

2 = 1 .
Part 4
The incident and reflected wave packets (x > a) are given by
Ψi(x, t) =

0
dk g(k) e−ik(x−a) e−iωkt , Ψr(x, t) =
 ∞
0
dk g(k) ei[k(x−a)−2δ] e−iωkt .
Using the stationary phase method, the center of the incident wave packet moves according to
ϕ(k) = −k(x − a) − ωkt and ϕ
(k0) = 0 =⇒ xi(t) = a − k0
m

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press121 5.3 Problems
and so for t  0 it is at x 
 a, reaching a at t = 0. The center of the reflected wave packet moves
according to
ϕ(k) = k(x − a) − 2δ(k) − ωkt and ϕ

and thus the time delay vanishes as

√0
for 0

The reflected wave packet starts off without delay to move back towards x −→ ∞.
It is also interesting to examine the case in which
K0a = 2n − 1
2 π =⇒ n ≡

(2n − 1)π

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press122 Scattering in One Dimension
on the allowed n-values. At these resonant energies n, K0a is an odd multiple of π/2, and the time
delay reduces to
τ = 2am

√n
for 0 = n .
If the depth v0 is very close to (but slightly less than) (2n −1)2π2/(4a2), then n will be very small,
and the associated τ will be very long, that is, the reflected wave packet will take a long time before
starting off to move towards x −→ ∞. It is as if the particle hangs around the region of the potential
for a long time. As n increases (to n + 1, n + 2, . . . ), the time delay will be progressively reduced,
but it will still be relatively fairly long if n 
 1, namely if the potential is very deep.
Problem 8 Transmission and Reflection Coefficients in WKB
Approximation with Application
This problem deals with the application of the WKB method (developed in Problem 12 of Chapter 4)
to the calculation of the transmission probability through a generic potential v(x). The only
assumptions made on v(x) is that it vanishes as |x| −→ ∞ and that it has a (single) maximum v0
at x0. Continuum solutions of the Schrodinger equation exist for ¨  > 0. Hereafter we restrict the
energy  to the range 0 <  < v0. For  in this range, there are two classical inversion points, a and
b with a < b. Write the WKB solutions as follows:

Problem 9 Scattering and Resonances in a Potentialv(x) = ∞ forx < 0

Consider a particle of mass m confined in the region x ≥ 0 and subject to a repulsive δ-function
potential located at x = a, that is,
v(x) = v0 δ(x − a) for x ≥ 0 .

for any  > 0.
2. Obtain the complete solution ψk (x) with k =

packet moves from a back to infinity with time delay 2τ. Determine τ.

Solution
Part 1
Continuum non-degenerate energies exist for any  > 0. The solutions of the Schrodinger equation ¨
in the regions 0 < x < a and x > a are
ψ<(x) = A sin(kx) , ψ>(x) = B e−ik(x−a) + Ceik(x−a) ,
with k =
√
. The boundary condition at the origin has already been imposed. The probability current
density vanishes in the region 0 < x < a , since the wave functions is real (up the possibly complex
constant A). In the region x > a it is given by
j = − i

 jr
,
where ji is the probability current density associated with the incident wave (from right to left, hence
the minus sign), and jr is the analogous quantity associated with the reflected wave propagating from
left to right. Since j is conserved, we must have ji + jr = 0. Thus, there is no transmitted wave and the
reflection coefficient R must be unity for any energy  > 0,
R = |jr|
|ji|
= |C|
2
|B|
2 = 1 ,
implying that C must differ from B by at most a phase factor.
Part 2
We now impose the boundary conditions at x = a, where the δ-function potential is located, to find

and the complex number zC has magnitude |zC| = 1. It follows that |C| = |B|, and hence R = 1, as must
be the case.
Part 3
The complete continuum wave function for  > 0 follows:
ψk (x) = Ak sin(kx) 0 < x < a
= e−ik(x−a) + Ck eik(x−a) x > a ,
where the coefficients Ak and Ck are given by the relations in part 2; the coefficient Bk has been set to
unity, since it is irrelevant (see below). As a check, we consider the limit v0 = 0, namely the situation
when there is no δ-function potential and the particle is free in the region x > 0. We have, in this
limit,
Ak = −2i eika , Ck = −e2ika
and so
ψk (x) = −2i eika sin(kx) = e−ik(x−a) − eik(x+a) 0 < x < a
= e−ik(x−a) − eik(x+a) x > a ,
that is, a free-particle solution for x > 0 satisfying the boundary condition ψk (0) = 0.

2π
g(k) ψk (x) e−iωkt ωk =  k2

The reflected wave packet will start on its way back from a to ∞ with a delay 2τ.

It is also interesting to examine the region x < a, where the incident and reflected wave packets are

where
x

r(t) = v(t − τ) .
Thus, the incident wave packet reaches a (traveling from ∞) at time t = 0 and takes a further time
τ to reach the origin (where the infinite barrier is located); the reflected wave packet starts off at
time t = τ to travel from the origin to the edge a, which it reaches at time 2τ, and then moves back
to ∞. However, the amplitudes of the incident and reflected wave packets in the region x < a are
suppressed by the factor 1/ρ, where
ρ2 = 1 +
x0
x
sin(2x) +
x2

x2 sin2 x with x0 = av0 , x = ak .
The factor 1/ρ2 is an oscillating function of x (that is, of the energy  = k2). However, for x0 
 1
this factor is very small everywhere, except for sharp peaks occurring at certain energies. At these
energies, the magnitude of the wave packet is relatively large in x < a, and the particle has a non￾vanishing probability of being in this region; see Fig. 5.1. The states corresponding to these energies
are known as resonances.

We now investigate the time delay obtained above as a function of energy. We find

τ

x
1 + (x0/x2) sin2 x
1 + (x0/x)2 sin2 x + (x0/x) sin(2x)
τ0 = ma2
 ,
and we see in Fig. 5.1 that (again, in the limit x0 
 1) it is very large at the resonant energies, in
consistency with the notion that the particle “hangs around” the region x < a for a relatively long
time before traveling back to ∞.
Problem 10 Scattering in a Potential with an Infinite Barrier atx = 0 and
a Finite Barrier for a < x < b
Consider a particle in a square well potential consisting of an infinite barrier at x = 0 and
v(x) = −v0 θ(a − x) + w0 [θ(x − a) − θ(x − b)] x > 0 ,
with v0,w0 > 0 and b > a. In the following, we will be interested only in the continuum solutions
corresponding to energy  with w0 >  > 0.
1. Introduce the wave numbers

in regions 1, 2, and 3, corresponding, respectively, to 0 < x < a, a < x < b, and x > b, and write
the wave function in region 3 as
ψ3 (x) = e−ik3x + D eik3x x > b .
By using the local conservation of the probability current density, show that D has unit magnitude
and conclude that the reflection coefficient R is equal to unity, that is, there is no transmitted wave
at x = 0, the position of the infinite barrier. In particular, show that D can be expressed as
D = α + iβ

Solution
Part 1
We consider only the case 0 <  < w0. Continuum non-degenerate energies exist in this range.
The solutions of the Schrodinger equation in regions 1 and 2 are ¨
ψ1 (x) = A sin(k1x) , ψ2 (x) = B eκ2x + Ce−κ2x ,
with
k1 = √
v0 +  , κ2 = √
w0 −  .
In region 3 we have
ψ3 (x) = D eik3x + E e−ik3x , k3 = √
 .
The solutions are not normalizable. The probability current density vanishes in regions 1 and 2, since
the wave functions are real (up the possibly complex constants A, B, and C). In region 3, it is given by

where ji is the probability current density associated with the incident wave (from right to left, hence

have multiplied by the overall phase factor eikb, as instructed by the text of the problem, for later
convenience. The coefficients Ak, Bk, Ck, and Dk are given by the relations in part 3; the coefficient

and we have identified the incident and reflected wave packets. We find that the center of the incident
wave packet moves according to
xi(t) = b − vt v = k

and so it reaches the edge b at time t = 0 (this is the reason for multiplying the wave function by the
phase factor eikb). The incident wave packet is approximately given by

Part 3
We now investigate the time delay obtained above as a function of energy for 0 <  < w0. We go
back to the expression for ϕ given in part 3 above, and introduce the following definitions:

A necessary requirement for this to happen is that x1 > π/2, which ensures that tan x is negative in
a portion of the interval x0 < x < x1 (otherwise there is no solution). At the points xn where ϕ(x)
changes rapidly (see Fig. 5.2) the slope is large and negative), implying a large time delay. These
points xn (their number will depend on the potential parameters) correspond to energies n = (xn/a)2−
v0. So, at these energies the particle “hangs around” the region 0 < x < a for a long time, before
traveling back to ∞. The states corresponding to the n are known as resonances.

Suppose that a particle is confined to the xy-plane and is subject to the repulsive potential
v(x) = v0 θ(x) v0 > 0 .
Assume that the particle’s energy  > v0.

These equations have solutions of the type (assuming  > v0) X(x) ∼ e±ikxx for x < 0 and X(x) ∼
e±iKxx for x > 0, where K2
x = k2
x − v0, and Y(y) ∼ e±ikyy

where ψi, ψr, and ψt indicate the incident, reflected, and transmitted wave functions. Note that the
current corresponding to ψk(x, y) in the region x < 0 is not simply given by the sum of the currents
associated with the incident and reflected wave functions; there are interference terms between these
waves which do not vanish. This difficulty is avoided by introducing wave packets.
The boundary conditions require (note that the common factors eikyy cancel out)
A + B = C , A − B = Kx

with solutions with respect to A given by

where θ and ϕ are the angles made by the incident and transmitted wave-number vectors with the

The above relation is just Snell’s law,

dr ∇ · j =

dS nˆ · j = 0,
where j is the total probability current density, given by
j = ji + jr for x < 0 , j = jt for x > 0 .
In order to verify the above conservation law, we consider the “surface” integral as in Fig. 5.3.
We find
−a (ji + jr) · xˆ + a jt · xˆ = 0
and note that the contributions from the upper and lower sides (of length b) of the rectangle cancel
each other out in the regions x < 0 and x > 0. Thus, we find

Problem 12 Reflection and Transmission at Two Repulsive δ-Function Potentials
Consider a particle in one dimension under the influence of a potential consisting of two repulsive

Calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients and determine for which values of a the
transmission coefficient is unity.
Solution
Denoting by I, II, and III the regions x < 0, 0 < x < a, and x > a, we have
ψI(x) = eikx + A e−ikx , ψII(x) = B eikx + Ce−ikx , ψIII(x) = D eikx .

The resonances do not occur at the values nπ/k or nλ/2, where λ is the de Broglie wavelength. The
reason is that the reflections of the particle at x = 0 and x = a occur with a phase shift of the wave
function. As a consequence, resonances occur at an.

We write
cos2 (ka − α)
cos2 α = 1 + cos(2ka − 2α)
1 + cos(2α) .
The following cases can be distinguished.
1. Real non-degenerate eigenvalues, that is,
cos2 (ka − α)/cos2 α > 1 =⇒ cos(2ka − 2α) > cos(2α) ;
this is satisfied if
pπ < ka < (p + 1)π and α > (ka − pπ)/2 p = 0, 1, 2, ...
2. Real degenerate eigenvalues, that is,
cos2 (ka − α)/ cos2 α = 1 =⇒ cos(2ka − 2α) = cos(2α) ;
this is satisfied if
pπ < ka < (p + 1)π and α = (ka − pπ)/2 p = 0, 1, 2, ...
3. Imaginary eigenvalues, that is,
cos2 (ka − α)/ cos2 α < 1 =⇒ cos(2ka − 2α) < cos(2α) ;
this is satisfied if
pπ < ka < (p + 1)π and α < (ka − pπ)/2 p = 0, 1, 2, ...
It is convenient to define
ξ = cos(ka − α)
cos α .
Note that in the range where real eigenvalues occur, we have
ξ > 1 if pπ < ka < (p + 1)π and α > (ka − pπ)/2 p = 0, 2, 4, ...
ξ < −1 if pπ < ka < (p + 1)π and α > (ka − pπ)/2 p = 1, 3, 5, ... .
In terms of ξ the eigenvalues are the following:
1. Real for |ξ| ≥ 1:
λ± = ξ ±

ξ2 − 1, non-degenerate ; λ± = 1, degenerate case
2. Imaginary for |ξ| < 1:

The determinant of Q is equal to 1 since, using det(A B) = det(A) det(B) and det(S−1) = 1/det(S), it
follows that
det Q = det 

In order to calculate Q, we need to find S, in other words the eigenvectors of P. To this end, it
is convenient to define cos η = ξ when |ξ| < 1, and sign(ξ) cosh η = ξ when |ξ| > 1, where
sign(ξ) = ± depending on whether ξ > 1 or ξ < −1, and to rewrite the eigenvalues as
λ± = e±iη |ξ| < 1 , λ± = sign(ξ) e±η |ξ| > 1 .
The matrix P is given as follows:

In order to calculate the transmission coefficient, we need the matrix element Q22, that is,
Q22 = 
SDN+1
S−1

22 = a+b−λN+1 − − a−b+λN+1 +
det(S)
or, explicitly,
Q22 = sin[(N + 2)η] − ei(ka−α) sin[(N + 1)η]/ cos α
sin η .
The transmission coefficient is then obtained as
T = sin2 η
| sin[(N + 2)η] − ei(ka−α) sin[(N + 1)η]/ cos α|
2 .
Thus it is an oscillating function of the energy in energy bands defined by the condition pπ < ka <
(p + 1)π and α < (ka − pπ)/2 with p = 0, 1, 2, ... .
The Case |ξ| > 1. For ξ > 1 make the replacements η −→ −iη and sin η −→ −i sinh η,
corresponding to e±iη −→ e±η; for ξ < −1 make the replacements η −→ −iη + π and sin η −→
i sinh η, corresponding to e±iη −→ −e±η (recall that for |ξ| > 1 the eigenvalues are sign(ξ) e±η).
Thus for ξ > 1 the coefficient Q22 is given by
Q22 = −i sinh[(N + 2)η] + i ei(ka−α) sinh[(N + 1)η]/ cos α
−i sinh η ,
and hence
T = 1
|Q22 |
2 = sinh2 η
| sinh[(N + 2)η] − ei(ka−α) sinh[(N + 1)η]/ cos α|
2 .
For ξ < −1, we note that
sin[(N + 2)η] −→ sin[−i(N + 2)η + (N + 2)π] = −i(−1)
N+2 sinh[(N + 2)η] ,
and so
Q22 = −i(−1)N+2 sinh[(N + 2)η] + i(−1)N+1 ei(ka−α) sinh[(N + 1)η]/ cos α
i sinh η ,
which yields a similar expression as that above except for a sign switch in the denominator:
T = 1
|Q22 |
2 = sinh2 η
| sinh[(N + 2)η] + ei(ka−α) sinh[(N + 1)η]/ cos α|
2 .
In the limit N 
 1, we can approximate sinh[(N+2)η] by eNη/2 and obtain that T ∝ e−2Nη for fixed η
(energy). Thus, transmission for energies in the bands defined by the condition pπ < ka < (p + 1)π
and α > (ka − pπ)/2 with p = 0, 1, 2, ... is strongly suppressed in the limit N 
 1.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press144 Scattering in One Dimension
The Case |ξ| =1. The transmission coefficient in this case can be obtained from that corresponding
to |ξ| > 1 by taking the limits ξ −→ ±1 and η −→ 0. Note that |ξ| = 1 requires energies such that
α = (ka − pπ)/2, and hence
ei(ka−α)
/cos α −→ −1 + i cot(ka/2) p odd
−→ 1 + i tan(ka/2) p even .
Using sinh x ≈ x as x goes to zero, we find
T = 1
1 + (N + 1)2 cot2 (ka/2) p odd ,
= 1
1 + (N + 1)2 tan2 (ka/2) p even .
The requirement α = (ka − pπ)/2 puts a condition on the energy since α = tan−1 (v0/2k), and hence
the energy must be such that tan(ka/2 − pπ/2) = v0/2k, yielding cot(ka/2) = −v0/2k for p odd and
tan(ka/2) = v0/2k for p even, and hence the transmission coefficients can also be written as
T = 1
1 + (N + 1)2 (v0/2k)2 p = 0, 1, ... .
It is interesting to note that in this case the transmission coefficient is identical to that corresponding
to a single δ-function potential of strength (N+1)v0 (here N+1 is the number of individual δ-function
potentials present in the problem). We also note that, for fixed energy, T vanishes as N 
 1.
Problem 14 A General Treatment of Scattering:S-Matrix
Consider a potential v(x) that vanishes as |x| −→ ∞. We will be concerned below with the (two-fold
degenerate) continuum solutions corresponding to energy  > 0. In the asymptotic regions x −→ −∞
and x −→ ∞ these solutions satisfy the free-particle Schrodinger equation and can be written as ¨
ψ−(x) = A eikx + B e−ikx x −→ −∞ ,
ψ+(x) = Ceikx + D e−ikx x −→ ∞ ,
where k = √

1. Evaluate the probability current densities j± corresponding to the wave functions ψ±(x) and use
the conservation of probability current to show that
|A|
2 − |B|
2 = |C|
2 − |D|
2 .
Show that in terms of these coefficients the reflection and transmission probabilities are obtained
from either of the following two relations (they are the same, regardless of which set of relations
we use; see part 3 below):
R = |B|

|A|
2 and T = |C|

2. After joining the ψ−(x) solution smoothly to the ψ+(x) solution, relations between the coefficients
A and B, on the one hand, and C and D, on the other hand, are obtained. These relations can be
written equivalently as relations between the coefficients B and C of the “outgoing waves” e−ikx
for x −→ −∞ and eikx for x −→ ∞, and the coefficients A and D of the “incoming waves” eikx, for
x −→ −∞ and e−ikx for x −→ ∞, namely,

relation |A|

that the matrix

is such that
S† (k) S(k) = I ≡

,
that is, S is unitary. Obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of the matrix
elements of S(k).
3. Since the potential is real, the complex-conjugate solution also satisfies the Schrodinger equation, ¨
with asymptotic behavior given by
ψ∗
−(x) = A∗ e−ikx + B∗ eikx x −→ −∞ ,
ψ∗

and deduce from this that
S∗ (k) S(k) = I ,
and hence that S(k) must be symmetric (that is, equal to its transpose), in addition to being unitary
(this is a consequence of time reversal invariance as we will see in Chapter 16). Conclude from
this that the reflection coefficients obtained from either |B|
2/|A|
2 or |C|
2/|D|
2 are the same, and
similarly for the transmission coefficients.

holds for the generic (real) potential that we are considering here (see below as well as Problem 17).

and hence taking the complex conjugate of both sides we find

and so the S-matrix is symmetric (and unitary), namely S12 = S21. This implies that the reflection and
transmission coefficients are the same whether we use the solution with outgoing wave for x 
 0 or
that with outgoing wave for x  0.
We note in closing that a parity-invariant potential v(x) also yields a symmetric S-matrix. Indeed,
rearranging the matrix gives

Thus, in one dimension parity invariance does not impose any additional constraints on S beyond
those imposed by time-reversal invariance.
Problem 15 Scattering in a Parity-Invariant Potential: Phase-Shift Method
In this problem we consider the case of a parity-invariant potential v(x) = v(−x), such that v(|x| −→
∞) = 0, and describe the scattering process in terms of even and odd wave functions. The effect
of the potential is to introduce phase shifts in the asymptotic behaviors of these wave functions.
The reflection and transmission coefficients are related to these phase shifts, which then contain all
relevant information about the scattering process.1
1. Write the asymptotic even (e) wave function as
ψe
k (x) = A eikx + B e−ikx x  0
= B eikx + A e−ikx x 
 0 ,
and the asymptotic odd (o) wave function as
ψo
k (x) = Ceikx − D e−ikx x  0
= D eikx − Ce−ikx x 
 0 .
Show that |A| = |B| and |C| = |D|. Introduce the phase factors
B
A = e2iδe and D
C = e2iδo ,
and show that, up to overall factors, these wave functions can be written as
ψe
k (x) = cos(kx − δe) ψo
k (x) = sin(kx − δo) x  0
= cos(kx + δe) = sin(kx + δo) x 
 0 .
2. By taking appropriate linear combinations of ψe
k (x) and ψo
k (x), construct the wave functions
having outgoing waves only in the x 
 0 and x  0 regions, respectively. Read off the reflection
and transmission coefficients in terms of the phase shifts δe (k) and δo (k), which are of course
functions of k. Using the results of Problem 14, obtain the S-matrix in terms of these phase shifts.
Solution
Part 1
Conservation of the probability current yields j(x  0) = j(x 
 0) and hence, for the even wave
function,
k(|A|
2 − |B|
2) = k(|B|
2 − |A|
2) =⇒ |A| = |B| ,
1 The phase-shift method is especially useful in the case of a rotationally invariant (central) potential in three dimensions.
In one dimension, rotational invariance is equivalent to invariance under parity.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press149 5.3 Problems
and similarly for the odd wave function. After introducing the phase factors δe and δo, we have
ψe
k (x) = A

eikx + e−ikx+2iδe

= A eiδe

ei(kx−δe ) + e−i(kx−δe )



and
ψo
k (x) = C

eikx − e−ikx+2iδo


ei(kx−δo) − e−i(kx−δo)


= Ceiδo

ei(kx+δo) − e−i(kx+δe )

= 2iCeiδo sin(kx + δo) x 
 0 ,
which is the required result.
Part 2
Consider the linear combinations
ψ(±)
k (x) = eiδe (k) ψe
k (x) ± i eiδo (k) ψo
k (x) .
We find
ψ(+)
k (x) = eiδe ei(kx−δe ) + e−i(kx−δe )
2
+ i eiδo ei(kx−δo) − e−i(kx−δo)
2i = eikx + e−ikx e2iδe − e2iδo
2 x  0
= eiδe ei(kx+δe ) + e−i(kx+δe )
2
+ i eiδo ei(kx+δo) − e−i(kx+δo)
2i = eikx e2iδe + e2iδo
2 x 
 0 ,
and similarly
ψ(−)
k (x) = e−ikx e2iδe + e2iδo
2
x  0
= e−ikx + eikx e2iδe − e2iδo
2 x 
 0 .
Note that
e2iδe + e2iδo
2 = ei(δe+δo) cos(δe − δo) , e2iδe − e2iδo
2 = i ei(δe+δo) sin(δe − δo) ,
and the reflection and transmission coefficients read
R(k) = sin2
[δe (k) − δo (k)] , T(k) = cos2
[δe (k) − δo (k)] .
Using the results of the Problem 14, we find that
S =

i ei(δe+δo) sin(δe − δo) ei(δe+δo) cos(δe − δo)
ei(δe+δo) cos(δe − δo) i ei(δe+δo) sin(δe − δo)

,
and it is easily verified that S is unitary and symmetric.
Problem 16 Application to Scattering in a Repulsive δ-Function Potential
Consider a repulsive δ-function potential v(x) = v0 δ(x) that is even.
1. Construct the even (e) and odd (o) wave functions for a given energy  = k2, and show that they
can be expressed as
ψe
k (x) = cos[k|x| + δ(k)] , ψo
k (x) = sin(kx) ,
up to irrelevant multiplicative factors. Obtain the phase shift δ(k).
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press150 Scattering in One Dimension
2. Explain why the odd wave function is unaffected by v(x). What is the effect of v(x) on the nodes
of the even wave function?
3. Express the reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of δ(k).
Solution
Part 1
We write the even (e) wave function as
ψe
k (x) = α eikx + β e−ikx x < 0
= β eikx + α e−ikx x > 0
and the odd (o) wave function as
ψo
k (x) = α eikx − β e−ikx x < 0
= β eikx − α e−ikx x > 0 ,
where α and β, and α and β
, are constants; conservation of the probability current leads to |α| = |β|
and |α
| = |β
|. The boundary conditions at the origin imposed by the δ-function potential require
ψe
k (0−) = ψe
k (0+) =⇒ α + β = β + α ,
ψe 
k (0+) − ψe 
k (0−) = v0 ψe
k (0+) =⇒ ik
β − α

− ik
α − β

= v0

α + β

;
and the first equation is a tautology, while the second gives
β = 2ik + v0
2ik − v0  z with |z|=1
α ,
For the odd wave function we find β = α
. We note that the complex number z has unit magnitude,
and therefore it can be written as
2ik + v0
2ik − v0
≡ e2iδ(k) , δ(k) = −1
2
tan−1
	 4kv0
4k2 − v0


.
We can now express the even and odd wave functions as
ψe
k (x) = α 
eikx + e−ikx+2iδ(k)

= α eiδ(k) 
ei[kx−δ(k)] + e−i[kx−δ(k)]
 x < 0
= α 
eikx+2iδ(k) + e−ikx
= α eiδ(k) 
ei[kx+δ(k)] + e−i[kx+δ(k)]
 x > 0
and
ψo
k (x) = α 
eikx − e−ikx x > 0
= α 
eikx − e−ikx x < 0 ,
and thus up to irrelevant (complex) constants, respectively given by 2α eiδ(k) and 2iα
, as
ψe
k (x) = cos[k|x| + δ(k)] , ψo
k (x) = sin(kx) ,
over the whole region −∞ < x < ∞.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press151 5.3 Problems
Part 2
The potential produces a phase shift δ(k) in the even wave function but has no effect on the odd wave
function. Indeed, sin(kx) is a free solution of the Schrodinger equation. Since the odd wave function ¨
ψo
k (x) must vanish at the origin, it does not feel the potential, which only acts at x = 0. In contrast, the
even wave function is shifted as a whole, the nodes in x > 0, for example, occurring at
xn = nπ
2k − δ(k)
k n = 1, 3, 5, ... ,
rather than at n π/(2k) as in the free-particle case. Whether it is shifted in or out depends on the sign
of the phase shift.
Part 3
In order to relate the reflection and transmission coefficients to the phase shift, we need to relate the
solutions in terms of standing waves to those in terms of traveling waves. We write the latter as
ψ(+)
k (x) = eikx + A(k) e−ikx x < 0
= B(k) eikx x > 0
and
ψ(−)
k (x) = D(k) e−ikx x < 0
= e−ikx + C(k) eikx x > 0 .
The linear combinations are easily found as
ψ(+)
k (x) = eiδ(k) ψe
k (x) + iψo
k (x) ,
ψ(−)
k (x) = eiδ(k) ψe
k (x) − iψo
k (x) .
Indeed, we have
ψ(+)
k (x) = eiδ 1

Problem 17 Reflection and Transmission in a Generic Potential
Consider a generic potential v(x) such that v(x −→ ± ∞) = v±, where the constants v± are such that
v− ≥ v+. We are interested in the scattering-state solutions occurring for energies  ≥ v−.
1. Show that in the asymptotic regions x −→ ± ∞ the two independent solutions can be written as
ψ(+)
(x) = A eik−x + B e−ik−x x  0
= Ceik+x x 
 0
and
ψ(−)
(x) = B e−ik−x x  0
= Ceik+x + D e−ik+x x 
 0 ,
where k± = √ − v±. Obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients, R(l)
(k) and T(l)
(k),
respectively, corresponding to the solution ψ(l)
(x), with l = + and –, in terms of A, B, C, and
D. The goal of this problem is to show that
R(+)
(k) = R(−)
(k) , T(+)
(k) = T(−)
(k) .
Such a result, while obvious for a parity-invariant v(x), also holds for a generic v(x).
2. Write the general asymptotic solution as
ψ(x) = A eik−x + B e−ik−x x  0
= Ceik+x + D e−ik+x x 
 0 ,
and, using the conservation of probability, show that

4. Noting that [ψ(l)

By rescaling these constants as

The asymptotic solutions in the x −→ ±∞ regions must be matched, so that the wave function, along

Part 4
In fact, the matrix S is not only unitary but also symmetric (S12 = S21). This can be seen by noting that,
since the potential v(x) is real, ψ∗ (x) in part 2 is also a solution corresponding to the same energy,
ψ∗ (x) = A∗ e−ik−x + B∗ eik−x x  0

In quantum mechanics, the wave function Ψ(r, t) plays a central role,1 as it defines the state of the
particle and allows us to calculate the probability of obtaining a given result from the measurement
of a given dynamical variable (for example, the particle’s position or momentum). Because of the
interpretation of |Ψ(r, t)|
2 as a probability density, we must have

dr |Ψ(r, t)|
2 < ∞ . (6.1)
Therefore, we are naturally led to consider the set of square integrable functions for which the above
integral is convergent. In this section, we begin by reviewing the Hilbert space of square-integrable
functions and introducing operators and bases in this space. Next, we generalize these concepts
and introduce abstract state spaces and the notion of representations. We conclude with a review
of observables and tensor products.
6.1 Hilbert Space of Square-Integrable Functions
The set of square-integrable functions, denoted as L2 (R), forms a Hilbert space. Generally, a Hilbert
space is a linear vector space in which a scalar product has been defined. In the specific case of L2 (R),
this implies that, if the generally complex-valued functions ψ1 (r) and ψ2 (r) are square-integrable,
that is, ψ1 (r), ψ2 (r) ∈ L2 (R), then any linear combination λ1ψ1 (r) + λ2ψ2 (r), where the λi are
complex numbers, is also square-integrable. Any function belonging to L2 (R) can be thought of as a
“vector” in this space.
Given two vectors ϕ(r), ψ(r) ∈ L2 (R), their scalar product (ϕ, ψ) is defined as
(ϕ, ψ) =

dr ϕ∗ (r) ψ(r) . (6.2)
This definition associates a complex number, denoted as (ϕ, ψ), to any two square-integrable
functions ϕ(r) and ψ(r). From the above definition, the following properties follow easily:
1. (ψ, ϕ) = (ϕ, ψ)∗;
2. (ϕ, λ1ψ1 + λ2ψ2) = λ1 (ϕ, ψ1) + λ2 (ϕ, ψ2);
3. (λ1ϕ1 + λ2ϕ2, ψ) = λ∗
1 (ϕ1, ψ) + λ∗
2 (ϕ2, ψ).
4. A norm is associated with any ψ ∈ L2 (R) and defined as
ψ =

(ψ, ψ) =

dr |ψ(r)|
2
 1/2
≥ 0 , (6.3)
and ψ = 0 iff ψ(r) = 0.
1 Note that the considerations made here for wave functions in the coordinate representation also hold for wave functions in
the momentum representation.

An operator is generally any mapping of a Hilbert space onto itself. Specifically, an operator A in
L2 (R) takes any vector ∈ L2 (R) into another vector ∈ L2 (R):
ψ(r) −→ ψ
(r) = Aψ(r) . (6.4)
In quantum mechanics we are dealing primarily with linear operators (the exception being the time￾reversal operator, which is anti-linear). A linear operator is such that A

λ1ψ1 (r) + λ2ψ2 (r)

=
λ1Aψ1 (r) + λ2Aψ2 (r). Given two operators A and B, the product operator AB is defined as the
mapping ψ(r) −→ ψ = A [Bψ(r)], and generally AB  BA, so that the ordering in which
the operators are applied is important, unless, of course, AB = BA, when the operators are said to
commute. Of particular importance are adjoint, self-adjoint or hermitian, and unitary operators.
Given an operator A, its adjoint operator A†, if it exists, is defined as that operator for which
(ϕ, A ψ) =

dr ϕ∗ (r)

Aψ(r)

=

dr

A†ϕ(r)
 ∗
ψ(r) = (A†ϕ, ψ) . (6.5)
By using property 1 of the scalar product, we also have (ϕ, Aψ) = (ψ, A†ϕ)∗. The following
properties follow from the definition of the adjoint operator:
1. 
A†
†
= A ;
2. (λA)
† = λ∗A†;
3. (A + B)
† = A† + B† ;
4. (AB)
† = B†A† .
A hermitian or self-adjoint operator A is such that A† = A, while a unitary operator U is such that,
for any two vectors ϕ(r), ψ(r) ∈ L2 (R), it preserves the scalar product,
(Uϕ, Uψ) = (ϕ, ψ) , (6.6)
which also implies that
(Uϕ, Uψ) = (U†
Uϕ, ψ) = (ϕ, ψ) =⇒ U†
U = 1 , (6.7)
where 1 is the identity operator. By multiplying both sides of the last relation from the right by U−1,
we see that the adjoint of a unitary operator is equal to its inverse, U† = U−1.
Hermitian and unitary operators play a special role in quantum mechanics. The former are
associated with observables – the dynamical properties of the system that we can, at least in
principle, measure (position, momentum, and energy, for example). The latter induce symmetry
transformations on the system, such as, for example, translations and rotations. The time evolution
of a quantum state is also governed by a unitary operator.
Before introducing the concept of a basis, it is useful to recall the concept of linear independence.
A set of vectors ψ1 (r), ψ2 (r), ... , ψp (r) is said to be linearly independent when
λ1ψ1 (r) + λ2ψ2 (r) + ··· + λpψp (r) = 0 , (6.8)
where the λi are complex numbers, is satisfied iff λ1 = λ2 = ··· = λp = 0. In particular, if the
vectors ψm(r) are orthogonal, so that
(ψm, ψn) = 0 if m  n , (6.9)
then they are independent, since taking the scalar product of Eq. (6.8) with any of the ψm yields
(ψm, λ1ψ1 + λ2ψ2 + ··· + λpψp) = λm(ψm, ψm) = 0 =⇒ λm = 0 m = 1, ... , p . (6.10)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press157 6.2 Abstract Hilbert Space
The converse is not true, and the vectors of an independent set are not necessarily orthogonal to each
other. However, if p vectors are independent, they can be made orthonormal by the Gram–Schmidt
procedure, as illustrated by Problem 4 in Chapter 3.
The infinite set of orthonormal functions φ1 (r), ... , φp (r), . . . with (φm, φn) = δmn is a basis in
L2 (R) if the series
∞
m=1
cmφm(r) , cm = (φm, ψ) , (6.11)
converges to ψ(r), in the sense that ψp (r) = ψ(r) − p
m=1 cm φm(r) and limp→∞ ||ψp || −→ 0. Such
a basis is denumerable (the subscript p identifying the individual basis functions takes on integer
values) and is made up of functions which are square-integrable and, therefore, themselves in L2 (R).
It is known as a discrete basis. However, it is also convenient to introduce bases which are not in
L2 (R) but in terms of which any square-integrable function can nonetheless be expanded. These
are so-called continuous bases. In a continuous basis, the subscript identifying the basis functions
assumes a continuum of values, φm(r) −→ φα (r), where α varies over some interval I of the real
axis. The “orthonormality condition” now reads
(φα, φβ ) = δ(α − β) ; (6.12)
it involves a δ-function rather than a Kronecker δ. The expansion of a vector ψ(r) is given by
ψ(r) =

I
dα c(α) φα (r) , c(α) = (φα, ψ) =

dr φ∗
α (r) ψ(r) . (6.13)
An important example of a continuous basis is that formed by the eigenfunctions of the momentum
operator −i∇ (a hermitian operator),
φp(r) = eip·r/
(2π)3/2 , −i ∇φp(r) = p φp(r) , (6.14)
where the components of p , which vary in −∞ < pα < ∞, are the eigenvalues of the momentum
operator and label the basis functions. The orthonormality condition reads, in this case,
(φp, φp) = 1
(2π)3

dr ei(p−p
)·r/ = δ(p − p
) . (6.15)
Thus the momentum-space wave function ψ(p) = (φp, ψ) introduced in previous sections can be
viewed as the component of the vector ψ(r) in the basis φp(r).
In general we will be dealing with bases that have discrete and continuum portions. For example,
the eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian for a particle in a one-dimensional attractive δ-function potential
form a basis which has a discrete part, consisting of the single bound-state wave function with
negative energy, and a continuous part, consisting of the two independent scattering wave functions
corresponding to any energy ≥ 0.
6.2 Abstract Hilbert Space
In the previous section we established that the wave function describing the state of a system can be
uniquely represented by its components in a basis. The situation is similar to that in ordinary space,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press158 Mathematical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
where knowledge of a vector is equivalent to knowing its components in a coordinate system. These
components depend, of course, on the particular coordinate system we have chosen.
However, we can also think of a vector in a more abstract way, as a quantity with magnitude and
direction. Then, we can describe relations between vectors without having to specify a coordinate
system. For example, we can say that two vectors are parallel or orthogonal to each other. These
statements are independent of the coordinate system. While the representation of a vector in terms
of components is often more convenient for doing calculations, thinking of a vector as an entity in
itself, while more abstract, has advantages too.
Ket space
Hereafter, the states of a system are represented as vectors (“state vectors”) belonging to a Hilbert
space, or “state space,” which we denote as E. The dimensionality of this space can be finite or
infinite, depending on the system under consideration. Following Dirac, a state vector is denoted by
a “ket” |ψ, which is assumed to contain all information about the physical state. Kets satisfy the
superposition principle and hence, if |ψ1, |ψ2 ∈ E then so does any linear combination λ1 |ψ1 +
λ2 |ψ2, where the λi are complex numbers. It is also postulated that the states |ψ and λ|ψ with
λ  0 represent the same physical state: only the “direction” of the state in E matters.
Bra space and inner (or scalar) product
It is convenient to introduce the concept of “bra space”, which is dual to “ket space.” It is postulated
that to every ket |ψ corresponds a bra denoted as ψ| in this dual space. The ket-bra correspondence
is one-to-one, that is, |ψ  ψ|. It is also postulated that the correspondence is antilinear, in the
sense that
λ1 |ψ1 + λ2 |ψ2  λ∗
1ψ1 | + λ∗
2ψ2 | . (6.16)
The inner or scalar product associates a complex number with a bra ϕ| and a ket |ψ (taken in
this order); it is indicated as
ϕ|ψ = (ϕ|) · (|ψ) . (6.17)
The inner product is assumed to satisfy the same properties as the scalar product in L2 (R). The kets
|ϕ and |ψ are said to be orthogonal if ϕ|ψ = 0 (or, equivalently, if ψ|ϕ = 0).
The operator concept can be carried over from the previous section. Specifically, an operator maps
a ket into another ket,
|ψ −→ |ψ
 = Aˆ |ψ , (6.18)
where we denote operators acting in the state space E with a caret on a capital or lower-case letter.
Two operators Aˆ and Bˆ are the same if for any ket |ψ we have Aˆ|ψ = Bˆ|ψ; by contrast, Aˆ is the null
operator if for any |ψ the state Aˆ|ψ = 0. Apart from the time-reversal operator, which is antilinear,
we are dealing with linear operators, such that Aˆ

λ1 |ψ1 + λ2 |ψ2

= λ1Aˆ|ψ1 + λ2Aˆ|ψ2. We can
also consider the action of an operator Aˆ on a bra,
ψ| −→ ψ
| = ψ| Aˆ , (6.19)
where it is understood that Aˆ acts on ψ| from the right. In general, the ket Aˆ |ψ and the bra ψ| Aˆ
are not dual to each other.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press159 6.2 Abstract Hilbert Space
The addition of operators is both commutative and associative, namely, Aˆ+Bˆ = Bˆ +Aˆ and (Aˆ+Bˆ)+
Cˆ = Aˆ + (Bˆ + Cˆ). However, while the product is associative, (AˆBˆ)Cˆ = Aˆ(BˆCˆ) = AˆBˆCˆ, it is generally
non-commutative, AˆBˆ  BˆAˆ. In particular, the action of a product on a ket or a bra is defined as
Aˆ (Bˆ |ψ) = (AˆBˆ)|ψ = AˆBˆ |ψ , (ψ| Aˆ)Bˆ = ψ|(AˆBˆ) = ψ| AˆBˆ , (6.20)
and so Bˆ acts on a ket from the left first, and then Aˆ acts on the result; by contrast, first Aˆ acts on the
bra from the right, and then Bˆ acts on the result.
An interesting operator can be constructed by “multiplying” (or by taking the so-called outer
product of) a ket |ψ by a bra ϕ| (in this order), namely
Aˆ = |ψϕ| . (6.21)
When acting on a ket or a bra, this operator yields, respectively,
Aˆ |φ = (|ψϕ|) · |φ = |ψϕ|φ , φ| Aˆ = φ| · (|ψϕ|) = φ|ψϕ| ; (6.22)
in the first case the action of Aˆ consists in multiplying the ket |ψ by the complex number ϕ|φ,
while in the second case the action of Aˆ consists in multiplying the bra ϕ| by the complex number
φ|ψ. This example makes it plain that φ| Aˆ is not dual to Aˆ |φ.
Products such as ϕ|ψ, Aˆ |ψ, ϕ| Aˆ, |ψ ϕ|φ, and φ|ψ ϕ| are all meaningful and well
formed. However, products such as Aˆψ| and |ψ Aˆ are simply meaningless.2 So, in order to avoid
any misunderstanding, we should write, for example, ϕ|φ |ψ = (ϕ|φ) · |ψ without omitting
the parentheses and multiplication dot; by contrast, there is no ambiguity in |ψ ϕ|φ since
(|ψ ϕ|) · |φ and |ψ · (ϕ|φ) are well-formed products representing the same state, although
the former expression says that this state is obtained by the action of the operator |ψϕ| on |φ,
while the latter says that it is obtained by multiplying |ψ by the complex number ϕ|φ. In the
notation invented by Dirac, this equality results from the application of a generalized associative
axiom. Another illustration of this axiom is that, given an operator Aˆ, we have
ϕ| · (Aˆ |ψ) = (ϕ| Aˆ) · |ψ = ϕ|Aˆ |ψ , (6.23)
where in the last step we have removed the parentheses, since whether the operator acts to the right
on the ket or to the left on the bra is irrelevant; the result is the same.
The adjoint operator Aˆ† of an operator Aˆ is defined by the following property:
Aˆ |ψ  ψ| Aˆ† , (6.24)
that is, ψ| Aˆ† is the bra dual to the ket Aˆ |ψ. An operator such that Aˆ† = Aˆ is known as self-adjoint
or hermitian. The adjoint (AˆBˆ)†, defined as (AˆBˆ) |ψ  ψ| (AˆBˆ)†, satisfies
(AˆBˆ)
† = Bˆ†
Aˆ† , (6.25)
since Aˆ |ψ
  ψ
| Aˆ† and |ψ
 = B |ψ  ψ
| = ψ| Bˆ†. As in the space L2 (R), the following
identities hold:
(Aˆ†)
† = Aˆ , (λAˆ)
† = λ∗
Aˆ† , (Aˆ + Bˆ)
† = Aˆ† + Bˆ† . (6.26)
2 As a matter of fact, a product such as |ψ |ϕ or ψ|ϕ| is also nonsensical, unless the two kets or bras belong to different
state or dual spaces; for example, if |ψ and |ϕ are in the state spaces of particle 1 and 2 or in the orbital and spin spaces
of a particle, respectively. Indeed, in such cases we should more properly write |ψ⊗|ϕ or ψ|⊗ϕ|, that is, a tensor
product (this good practice is not always followed in this book!).

The adjoint of Aˆ = |ψϕ|, for example, is obtained as
Aˆ |φ = |ψϕ|φ = |ψφ|ϕ
∗
 λ∗
 φ|ϕ

λ
ψ| = φ| · (|ϕψ|) = φ| Aˆ† , (6.27)
where we have used the property λ∗ |ψ  λψ|. We conclude that Aˆ† = |ϕψ|. Another example is
the following:
ϕ| Aˆ |ψ = ϕ| · (Aˆ |ψ) = [(ψ| Aˆ†) · |ϕ]
∗ = ψ| Aˆ† |ϕ
∗ , (6.28)
where we have used the definition of the adjoint operator (that is, Aˆ |ψ  ψ| Aˆ†) and the property
of the inner product in order to obtain a relation between the matrix element of Aˆ and that of its
adjoint. In particular, for a hermitian operator we have
ϕ| Aˆ |ψ = ψ| Aˆ|ϕ
∗ , (6.29)
which implies, in particular, that ψ|A|ψ is real.
A unitary operator Uˆ is such that, for any Uˆ |ψ and ϕ| Uˆ†, where the latter is the bra dual to the
ket Uˆ |ϕ, we have
(ϕ| Uˆ†) · (Uˆ |ψ) = ϕ| Uˆ†
Uˆ |ψ = ϕ|ψ, (6.30)
and so Uˆ preserves inner products, which in turn implies that Uˆ† = Uˆ−1.
As a final remark, hereafter in this text we will primarily use Dirac notation. At times, though,
we will revert to the notation, preferred by mathematicians, that we used previously in the context
of the L2 (R) Hilbert space. In such a notation, for example, the adjoint of an operator Aˆ is
defined by (ϕ, Aˆψ) = (Aˆ†ϕ, ψ), which has no counterpart in Dirac notation; instead, we write
ϕ|Aˆ|ψ = ψ|Aˆ† |ϕ
∗.
6.3 Representations
Choosing a representation means choosing a basis in the state space. Once a representation is chosen,
kets, bras, and operators are represented by column vectors, row vectors, and square matrices,
respectively; the elements are generally complex numbers. To see how this is effected, we restate
below the properties of discrete and continuous bases in Dirac notation. A discrete basis |φm is a
denumerable set of state vectors labeled by the subscript m (an integer) with3
1. orthonormality, φm|φn = δmn ;
2. completeness, any state |ψ ∈ E can be expanded as follows:
|ψ =
∞
m=1
cm|φm , cm = φm|ψ , (6.31)
implying that
|ψ =

Pˆm = 1ˆ , (6.32)
where Pˆm = |φmφm| is the projection operator onto state |φm.
3 Of course, if the basis if finite, that is, the state space is finite dimensional, then the series are replaced by finite sums.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press161 6.3 Representations
A continuous basis |φα (whose vectors are not in E, since they are not normalizable) is a set of
vectors labeled by a subscript α which varies continuously in some interval I of the real axis, with
the properties of
1. orthonormality, φα |φβ = δ(α − β) ;
2. completeness, any state |ψ ∈ E can be expanded as
|ψ =

in the case of a continuous basis is

dβ A(α, β) c(β) . (6.37)
Given the matrix A representing the operator Aˆ, the matrix that represents the adjoint operator Aˆ†
is obtained by taking the transpose of A and the complex conjugate of all matrix elements, since,
using the definition of the adjoint, we have
φm|Aˆ† |φn = φn |Aˆ|φm

A hermitian operator Aˆ† = Aˆ is represented by a hermitian matrix A = A† (note that the diagonal
matrix elements are real in this case). Lastly, a unitary operator is represented by a unitary matrix U

and Kronecker deltas are replaced by integrals and δ-functions, respectively.

where the last relation follows from the unitarity of S.
6.4 Hermitian Operators and Observables
In quantum mechanics, hermitian operators play a special role: they are associated with quantities
that can be measured, that is, observables. The measurement of an observable results in one of the
eigenvalues of the associated hermitian operator.4 It is also postulated that the eigenstates of an
observables form a basis, that is,
Aˆ |ψ(k)
i  = λi|ψ(k)
i  with k = 1, ... , gi ,

i

gi
k=1
|ψ(k)
i ψ(k)
i | = 1ˆ , (6.43)
where gi ≥ 1 is the degeneracy of eigenvalue λi; if gi = 1, the eigenvalue is non-degenerate. There
are three important results that hold for observables:
1. If Aˆ and Bˆ commute, and |ψ is an eigenstate of Aˆ with eigenvalue a, then the state Bˆ |ψ is also
an eigenstate of Aˆ corresponding to the same eigenvalue a,
Aˆ

Bˆ |ψ
 = AˆBˆ |ψ = BˆAˆ |ψ = Bˆ 
a |ψ
 = aBˆ |ψ . (6.44)
If the eigenvalue a is non-degenerate then |ψ is also an eigenstate of Bˆ, since Bˆ |ψ must be
proportional to |ψ, that is, Bˆ |ψ = b |ψ. If the eigenvalue a is g-fold degenerate, then Bˆ |ψ(k)
 is
in the subspace spanned by the eigenstates of Aˆ having the eigenvalue a, that is, it can be expanded
as follows:
Bˆ |ψ(k)
 =

g
m=1
c(k)
m |ψ(m)
, c(k)
m = ψ(m)
| Bˆ |ψ(k)
 , (6.45)
where Aˆ |ψ(m)
 = a |ψ(m)
.
4 Recall that hermitian operators have real eigenvalues and that eigenstates belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press163 6.4 Hermitian Operators and Observables
2. If Aˆ and Bˆ commute, and |ψ1 and |ψ2 are two eigenstates of Aˆ corresponding to distinct
eigenvalues a1 and a2, then the matrix element
ψ1 | Bˆ |ψ2 = 0 , (6.46)
since
0 = ψ1 | AˆBˆ − BˆAˆ 
[ Aˆ, Bˆ ] =0
|ψ2 = ψ1 | Aˆ†
Bˆ − BˆAˆ |ψ2 = (a1 − a2)  0
ψ1 | Bˆ |ψ2 . (6.47)
3. If Aˆ and Bˆ commute then there exists a basis of common eigenstates of Aˆ and Bˆ. The proof is
straightforward. Let |ψ(k)
i  with i = 1, 2, ... and k = 1, ... , gi be the basis consisting of eigenstates
of Aˆ. We order it as follows (as an example, we are assuming here that a1 is g1-degenerate, a2 is
non-degenerate, etc.):
|ψ(1)
1 , ... , |ψ(g1)

In such a basis, Bˆ has matrix elements (from properties 1 and 2 above)
ψ(k)

where only the first four blocks are illustrated, for simplicity. If ai is non-degenerate then property
1 above says that |ψi is also an eigenstate of Bˆ with eigenvalue bi (this case corresponds to i = 2
and i = 4 in the matrix above). By contrast, if ai is degenerate then Bˆ is represented by a hermitian
matrix of dimension gi × gi. As such, it can be diagonalized,

Suppose that Aˆ, Bˆ, Cˆ, ... form a set of commuting observables. Then there exists a basis of
common eigenstates. Such a set of observables is said to be “complete,” that is, a complete set
of commuting observables, if specifying the eigenvalue of each observable specifies the unique
common eigenstate. As an example, consider the case of the Hamiltonian and parity observables, Hˆ
and Pˆ, for a particle in a one-dimensional repulsive δ-function potential located at the origin. The
energy eigenvalues are doubly degenerate. However, Hˆ and Pˆ commute and specifying the energy
and parity (either + or −) eigenvalues specifies a unique common eigenstate. So, in this case Hˆ and
Pˆ form a complete set of commuting observables.
6.5 The Coordinate and Momentum Representations
It is interesting to see how wave mechanics emerges in the present abstract formulation. To this
end, we introduce the position operator ˆx, an observable (in one dimension for simplicity but the
discussion is easily generalized to the three-dimensional case). It has eigenstates
xˆ |φx = x |φx −∞ < x < ∞ , (6.54)
where x is the (non-degenerate) eigenvalue, which takes on a continuum of values, and |φx
represents the state in which the particle is at position x. The eigenstates |φx form a continuous
basis, and hence
φx |φx = δ(x − x
) ,
 ∞
−∞
dx |φxφx | = 1ˆ . (6.55)
A particle in a state |ψ can be expanded in the basis of eigenstates of ˆx,
|ψ =
 ∞
−∞
dx ψ(x) |φx , ψ(x) = φx |ψ , (6.56)
and so the wave function ψ(x) is simply the component of |ψ in the basis of eigenstates of ˆx. From
this perspective, wave mechanics in coordinate space (as opposed to momentum space, see below)
consists of using the basis consisting of the eigenstates of ˆx to represent states and operators.
An operator that is a function of ˆx, such as the potential energy operator Vˆ(xˆ), has matrix elements
φx |Vˆ(xˆ)|φx = δ(x − x
) V(x) , (6.57)
where V(x) is the function obtained by replacing ˆx by its eigenvalue x. This can be seen by expanding
Vˆ(xˆ) as follows:
Vˆ(xˆ) =
∞
m=0
V(m)
(0)
m! xˆ
m , V(m)
(0) = dm
dzm V(z)


z=0 , (6.58)
and by noting that
φx |Vˆ(xˆ)|φx =
∞
m=0
V(m)
(0)
m! φx |xˆ
m|φx =
∞
m=0
V(m)
(0)
m! xmδ(x − x
) = V(x)δ(x − x
) , (6.59)
since the δ-function enforces x = x and hence V(x
) = V(x), that is, the operator Vˆ(xˆ) is diagonal in
the |φx representation. It is shown in Problem 9 that matrix elements of the momentum operator ˆp
are given by
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press165 6.6 Tensor Products
φx | pˆ |φx = −i d
dx δ(x − x
) , (6.60)
or, more generally, that
φx | pˆ n |φx = (−i)
n dn
dxn δ(x − x
) . (6.61)
As an example, the eigenvalue problem for a generic observable Aˆ reads, in this representation,
 ∞
−∞
dx A(x, x
)ψ(x
) = aψ(x) , A(x, x
) = φx | Aˆ |φx , (6.62)
which follows by projecting both sides of Aˆ|ψ = a|ψ onto position eigenstates and using complete￾ness.
We can equally well use the momentum representation, namely, we can work with the continuous
basis |φp of momentum eigenstates, for which
φp |φp = δ(p − p
) ,
 ∞
−∞
dp |φpφp | = 1ˆ . (6.63)
Clearly, an operator function of ˆp is diagonal in this basis, since
φp | Fˆ(pˆ) |φp = F(p) δ(p − p
) , (6.64)
whereas (see Problem 11)
φp | xˆ |φp = i d
dp δ(p − p
) . (6.65)
The eigenvalue problem for an operator Aˆ follows:
 ∞
−∞
dp A(p, p
) ψ(p
) = a ψ(p) , A(p, p
) = φp | Aˆ |φp , (6.66)
where ψ(p) is the momentum-space wave function,
ψ(p) = φp |ψ =

where we have used (see Problem 10) φx |φp = eipx//

2π. In particular, S(x, p) = φx |φp can be
viewed as the “transformation matrix” relating the |φx and |φp bases,

(6.68)
the last relationship expressing the unitarity of S(x, p).
6.6 Tensor Products
Consider the cases of a single particle in one dimension and in three dimensions. We denote the
corresponding state spaces as Ex and Er. Possible choices for bases in Ex and Er are those of the
eigenstates |φx and |φr of the position operator ˆx in one dimension and rˆ in three dimensions,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press166 Mathematical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
respectively. The state space Er can also be thought as of consisting of the three state spaces Ex, Ey,
and Ez, which we indicate as
Er = Ex ⊗ Ey ⊗ Ez , (6.69)
namely, the tensor product of Ex, Ey, and Ez. Similarly, the basis |φr can be viewed as the tensor
product of the three bases:
|φr = |φx⊗|φy⊗|φz = |φy⊗|φx⊗|φz = ··· , (6.70)
and the relative ordering of the states in the tensor product is irrelevant, since it is understood that
|φx ∈ Ex, |φy ∈ Ey, and |φz ∈ Ez. However, it is important to stress that a state |ψ ∈ Er
cannot generally be written as the tensor product of three states |ϕx, |χy, and |ξz belonging to,
respectively, Ex, Ey, and Ez. While the state |ψ can be expanded as
|ψ =

dx 
dy 
dz ψ(x, y,z) |φx⊗|φy⊗|φz =

dr ψ(r) |φr , (6.71)
it is only in the special case in which ψ(x, y,z) = ϕ(x) χ(y) ξ(z), that is, the expansion coefficients
(wave functions) factorize, that we have5
|ψ =

dx 
dy 
dz ϕ(x) χ(y) ξ(z) |φx⊗|φy⊗|φz

⊗

dz ξ(z) |φz
 |ξz
. (6.72)
To any operator, for example, Aˆ
x, acting in the state space Ex there corresponds an operator Aˆ
x ⊗
1y ⊗ 1z acting in E, such that Aˆ
x ⊗ 1ˆ y ⊗ 1ˆz |φr = (Aˆ
x |φx) ⊗ |φy⊗|φz and hence, on a generic
state |ψ,
Aˆ
x ⊗ 1ˆ y ⊗ 1ˆz |ψ =

dx 
dy 
dz ψ(x, y,z)

Aˆ
x |φx

⊗ |φy⊗|φz . (6.73)
It is easily seen that operators acting in different spaces commute, that is, Aˆ
x ⊗Bˆ y ⊗1ˆz and Bˆ y ⊗Aˆ
x ⊗
1ˆz acting on any state |ψ yield the same result. In particular, if Aˆ
x, Bˆ y, and Cˆz are three observables
with eigenstates |anx
, |bpy
, and |cq
z and corresponding eigenvalues ax
n, b
y
p, and cz
q in state spaces
Ex, Ey, and Ez, respectively, then the observable
Oˆ = Aˆ
x ⊗ 1ˆ y ⊗ 1ˆz + 1ˆ x ⊗ Bˆ y ⊗ 1ˆz + 1ˆ x ⊗ 1ˆ y ⊗ Cˆz , (6.74)
acting on the tensor product state |ax
n; b
y

q = |anx ⊗ |bp
y ⊗ |cqz has eigenvalues

Similarly, the operator Aˆ

p; cz
q in E has eigenvalues ax
n b
y

the product of the individual eigenvalues. In the following, we will often omit the ⊗ symbol in the
tensor product, and write simply |ax

5 Generally, let E1 and E2 be two state spaces with bases |χn (1) and |ξp (2), respectively. The basis
|χn (1); ξp (2) = |χn (1)⊗|ξp (2) spans the space E = E1 ⊗E2. If both E1 and E2 have finite dimensions N1 and N2, then
E has dimension N1×N2; if either of E1 and E2, or both, are infinite dimensional then E is also infinite dimensional. A state
|ψ in E can be generally expanded as |ψ = 
np cnp |χn (1); ξp (2), and, if the coefficients cnp factorize into cnp = an bp, the
state above is not “entangled” and can be written as the tensor product of states |φ(1) = 

since |ψ is normalized, and
ψ|(1ˆ − Pˆ) |ϕ = ψ|ϕ−ψ|ψψ|ϕ = 0 ,

Problem 9 The Momentum Operator in the Coordinate Representation
Derive the coordinate representation of the momentum operator ˆp using only the commutation
relation [ ˆx , ˆp ] = i (in one dimension for simplicity). Proceed as follows:
1. Consider the operator Tˆ = 1ˆ − (i/)η pˆ with the parameter η −→ 0. Show that, to linear terms in η
included,
xˆ Tˆ |φx = (x + η) Tˆ |φx ,
where |φx is the position eigenstate with eigenvalue x.
2. Deduce that Tˆ |φx is proportional to |φx+η, and show that the proportionality constant can be, at
most, a phase factor (note that Tˆ is unitary to linear terms in η).
3. Consider the matrix element φx |Tˆ|φx and deduce that, in the limit η −→ 0,
φx | pˆ |φx = −i d
dx δ(x − x
) .
Show that
φx | pˆ
n |φx = (−i)
n dn
dxn δ(x − x
) .
Solution
Part 1
We have
xˆ Tˆ |φx = 
Tˆ xˆ + [ ˆx , Tˆ ]

|φx = x Tˆ |φx + [ ˆx , Tˆ ]|φx ,
where in the next to last term we have used the fact that |φx is an eigenstate of ˆx (and that Tˆ is linear,
of course). Evaluation of the commutator gives
[ ˆx , Tˆ ] = 
xˆ , 1ˆ − i
 ηpˆ

= − i
 η [ xˆ, ˆp ] = η ,
where the identity operator is understood. Therefore, we find
xˆ Tˆ |φx = x Tˆ |φx + η |φx = x Tˆ |φx + η Tˆ |φx = (x + η) Tˆ |φx ,
where in the next to last step we have ignored terms quadratic in η and have used the relation
η |φx = η Tˆ |φx. We conclude that (in the limit η −→ 0) the state Tˆ |φx is an eigenstate of ˆx with
eigenvalue x + η.
Part 2
Since the eigenvalues of ˆx are non-degenerate, it is clear that Tˆ |φx = c |φx+η, where c is constant.
However, this constant has unit magnitude, since Tˆ is unitary:
Tˆ† Tˆ = 
1ˆ + iη pˆ/
 1ˆ − iη pˆ/

= 1ˆ + terms quadratic in η ,
thus yielding
δ(x − x
) = φx+η |φx+η = 1

|c|
2 φx |φx = 1

2 δ(x − x
) =⇒ |c|
2 = 1 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press173 6.7 Problems
Part 3
The matrix elements of Tˆ read
φx | Tˆ |φx = φx |φx+η = δ(x − x − η) = φx |1ˆ − i
 η pˆ |φx = δ(x − x
) − i
 η φx | pˆ |φx ,
which leads to the required result,
φx | pˆ |φx = i lim
η→0
δ(x − x − η) − δ(x − x
)
η = −i d
dx δ(x − x

Problem 13 Some Consequences of the Commutation Relation between xˆand pˆ
The Hamiltonian Hˆ of a particle in a one dimension is given by
Hˆ = pˆ 2

Let |φn be the eigenstates of Hˆ with Hˆ |φn = En |φn, where n is a discrete index. Evaluate the
commutator 

and deduce that
φm|pˆ|φn = αmn φm|xˆ|φn ,
where the coefficient αmn depends on the energy difference Em − En. Using the closure relation
satisfied by the eigenstates of Hˆ and the previous result, obtain the following sum rule:

2. Show that the trace of an operator is independent of the basis |φn used to evaluate it.

Problem 15 Properties of Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of a Hermitian Operator
Show that the eigenvalues of a hermitian operator Aˆ are real and that eigenstates belonging to
different eigenvalues are orthogonal.
Solution
Since Aˆ is hermitian, we have
Aˆ |ψ = λ|ψ  ψ| Aˆ = λ∗
ψ| ,
and therefore by taking the scalar product with ψ| in the first relation and |ψ in the second it
follows that
λψ|ψ = ψ|Aˆ|ψ = λ∗
ψ|ψ ,
and so either ψ|ψ  0 and λ = λ∗, or ψ|ψ = 0 and |ψ is the null state. Eigenstates belonging
to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, since if Aˆ |ψ1 = λ1 |ψ1 and Aˆ |ψ2 = λ2 |ψ2 with λ1  λ2
then
ψ1 |Aˆ|ψ2 = ψ1 |·
Aˆ|ψ2) = λ2ψ1 |ψ2 and also ψ1 |Aˆ|ψ2 = 
ψ1 |Aˆ†)·|ψ2 = λ1ψ1 |ψ2;
then subtracting one from the other we arrive at

Problem 17 Basis of Simultaneous Eigenstates for Two Observables, Commutativity
Consider two observables Aˆ and Bˆ. Assume that there are simultaneous eigenstates |ψam,bn  of Aˆ and
Bˆ with
Aˆ |ψam,bn  = am|ψam,bn  , Bˆ |ψam,bn  = bn |ψam,bn  ,
which form an orthonormal basis. Can you conclude that the two observables commute? Justify your
answer. (Adapted from Modern Quantum Mechanics, J. J. Sakurai and J. Napolitano, Cambridge
University Press.)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press179 6.7 Problems
Solution
Consider a generic state |ψ. Since the eigenstates |ψam,bn  form a basis, it can be expanded as
follows:
|ψ =

m,n
cm,n |ψam,bn  , cm,n = ψam,bn |ψ .
Now, acting on |ψ with AˆBˆ and BˆAˆ yields, respectively,
AˆBˆ |ψ =

m,n
cm,n AˆBˆ |ψam,bn  =

m,n
cm,nbnam|ψam,bn 
and
BˆAˆ |ψ =

m,n
cm,n BˆAˆ|ψam,bn  =

m,n
cm,nambn |ψam,bn  ,
that is, the same result. We conclude that (AˆBˆ − BˆAˆ)|ψ = 0 for any |ψ, implying that Aˆ and Bˆ
commute.
Problem 18 Simultaneous Eigenstate of Two Anticommuting Observables
Suppose that Aˆ and Bˆ are two observables that anticommute, that is, {Aˆ , Bˆ} ≡ AˆBˆ + BˆAˆ = 0. Can
there be a common eigenstate of Aˆ and Bˆ? Justify your answer. (Adapted from J. J. Sakurai and J.
Napolitano, Modern Quantum Mechanics, Cambridge University Press.)
Solution
Since Aˆ is an observable it can be diagonalized, so that in the basis consisting of eigenstates of Aˆ, the
associated matrix is given by (A)ij = aiδij. In this basis, observable Bˆ is represented by a hermitian
matrix (B)ij = bij. The requirement that Aˆ and Bˆ anticommute leads to the condition

A B + B A

ij =

k

aiδikbkj + bikδkjaj

= bij
ai + aj

= 0 .
Suppose the state space is two dimensional, in which case the above condition requires that
a1b11 = 0 , (a1 + a2)b12 = 0 , a2b22 = 0 ;
and note that (a1 + a2)b21 = 0 is redundant since (a1 + a2)b21 = [(a1 + a2)b12]
∗ (the eigenvalues ai are
real and B is hermitian). The coefficients ai cannot both be zero, otherwise we would have the null
matrix. We take a2 = 0; then b11 = 0 and b12 = 0, and hence the matrices representing Aˆ and Bˆ must
have the forms
A =
	
a 0
0 0

, B =
	
0 0
0 b

with eigenvalues a and 0, and 0 and b, respectively. The common eigenvectors are

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press180 Mathematical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
and A and B certainly anticommute (note that they also commute!). For a less trivial case, consider a
three-dimensional state space with
A = 

Problem 19 Normal Operators and Associated Eigenvalues
A normal operator is one that commutes with its adjoint. A linear algebra theorem assures us that
(at least for a finite-dimensional state space) a normal operator can be diagonalized and that the
eigenvectors form a basis in the state space.

Solution
Part 1
Since the eigenstates of an operator Aˆ form a basis in the state space, we have the completeness
relation

n

gn
k=1
|φ(k)
n φ(k)
n | = 1ˆ ,
where an (with degeneracy gn) is the eigenvalue (not necessarily real) corresponding to the
eigenstates |φ(k)
n . We obtain
Aˆ =

n

gn
k=1
an |φ(k)
n φ(k)
n | ,
where we have multiplied Aˆ on the right by the identity operator 1ˆ and exploited the completeness
relation. Now, taking the adjoint yields
Aˆ† =

n

gn

n φ(k)
n | ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press181 6.7 Problems
and hence, using the orthonormality property of the eigenstates, φ(k)
n |φ(l)
p  = δnp δkl, we have
Aˆ Aˆ† =

n

gn
k=1
|an |
2 |φ(k)
n φ(k)
n | = Aˆ† Aˆ
and Aˆ commutes with Aˆ†.
Part 2
Let Uˆ be a unitary operator. Since Uˆ† = Uˆ−1, we see that Uˆ†Uˆ = 1ˆ = Uˆ Uˆ† and hence Uˆ is normal.
Now, if |ψ is an eigenstate of Uˆ with eigenvalue u, then
Uˆ |ψ

|ψ
= u|ψ ,
with ψ
|ψ
 = |u|
2ψ|ψ. Exploiting unitarity leads to
ψ
|ψ
 = ψ|ψ =⇒ |u|
2 = 1 ,
that is, the eigenvalue u is a phase factor.
Part 3
The characteristic equation determining the eigenvalues is given by
det 
A − λ 1
 .
Under a basis transformation, we have
A −→ A = S† A S ,
and S is unitary. Using Binet’s theorem, that det
A B
 = det
A
 det
B

, it follows that
det 
A − λ 1

S†

since det 
S†

= det 
S−1

=

det 
S
−1
. We conclude that the characteristic equation and therefore its
roots are invariant under a basis transformation.
Part 4
Given that Aˆ is normal, it can be diagonalized. In the basis of eigenstates, we have
A = S AD S† ,
where AD is the matrix with eigenvalues on its diagonal. We also have

Problem 20 A Model Hamiltonian
Suppose that a linear operator Sˆ satisfies the two equations

Let |ψE be an eigenstate of Hˆ with eigenvalue E, namely Hˆ |ψE = E|ψE. We have
E2 |ψE = Hˆ2 |ψE = λ Hˆ |ψE = λE |ψE ,
yielding E2 = λE. The eigenvalues E are 0 or λ.
Problem 21 A Simple Two-State Hamiltonian
The Hamiltonian operator for a two-state system is given in some basis |1, |2 by
Hˆ = E(|11|−|22| + |12| + |21|) ,
where E is a constant with the dimensions of energy. Find the energy eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenstates (as linear combinations of |1 and 2). (Adapted from J. J. Sakurai and J. Napolitano

Solution
In the basis |1, |2, the matrix representing Hˆ has matrix elements given by
1|Hˆ|1 = E , 2|Hˆ|2 = −E , 1|Hˆ|2 = 2|Hˆ|1 = E ,

Problem 22 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Two-State Hamiltonian
Consider a system with a two-dimensional state space. In this space, the states |1 and |2 form an
orthonormal basis. The Hamiltonian describing the system in this basis has the form
Hˆ = H11 |11| + H22 |22| + H12 ( |12| + |21| ) ,
where H11, H22, and H12 are real parameters with dimensions of energy. Obtain the eigenvalues
and corresponding eigenvectors of Hˆ. Make sure that they reduce to the expected (and obvious!)
eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the limit H12 −→ 0.
It is convenient to introduce the parameter
η = 2H12
H11 − H22
with H11  H22 ,
and to express the results in terms of η.
Solution
The eigenvalues result from
det 
H11 − E H12
H12 H22 − E

= 0 ,
where H11, H22, and H12 are real. We find that
(H11 − E)(H22 − E) − H2
12 = 0 =⇒ E± =
H11 + H22 ±

(H11 − H22)2 + 4H2

We now introduce the parameter

In the basis consisting of |1 and |2, we write the corresponding eigenvectors as column vectors
(a±, b±)T and obtain
H12a+ + (H22 − E+)b+ = 0 , (H11 − E−)a− + H12b− = 0 ,
where we consider only the second and first equations for the eigenvector, corresponding to E+ and
E−, respectively. Inserting the expressions for the eigenvalues yields the eigenvectors

Problem 23 Two Observables in a Three-Dimensional State Space: An Example

where a and b are real.
1. It is obvious that Aˆ has a degenerate spectrum. Is the spectrum of Bˆ also degenerate?
2. Show that Aˆ and Bˆ commute.
3. Find a new set of orthonormal kets which are simultaneous eigenstates of both Aˆ and Bˆ. Specify
the eigenvalues of Aˆ and Bˆ for each of these three eigenstates. Does specifying these eigenvalues
uniquely identify the relative common eigenstate? That is, do Aˆ and Bˆ form a complete set of
commuting observables? (Adapted from J. J. Sakurai and J. Napolitano 2020, Modern Quantum

Part 3
The matrix A is diagonal and so
Aˆ |φ1 = a|φ1, Aˆ |φ2 = −a|φ2 , Aˆ|φ3 = −a|φ3 .

The common basis of simultaneous eigenstates consists of |φ1, |ψ2, and |ψ3 with corresponding
eigenvalues of Aˆ, Bˆ given by a, b, −a, b, and −a, −b. Thus, specifying the pair of simultaneous
eigenvalues uniquely identifies the eigenstate, and Aˆ and Bˆ form a complete set of commuting
observables.

Problem 24 Model for a Planar Molecule
A certain molecule is composed of six identical atoms A1, A2, ... , A6 which form a regular hexagon.
Consider an electron which can be localized on each of the atoms. Denote by |ψn the state in which
the electron is localized on the nth atom (n = 1, ... , 6). The electron states are taken to be limited to
the space spanned by the |ψn, assumed to be orthonormal ψm|ψn = δmn; in other words, these six
states form a basis.
1. Define the operator Rˆ by the following relations:
Rˆ |ψ1 = |ψ2 , Rˆ |ψ2 = |ψ3 , ..., Rˆ |ψ6 = |ψ1 .
Find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of Rˆ. Show that the eigenvectors form an orthonormal set
(i.e., they form a basis).
2. Show that the adjoint operator Rˆ† acts as follows:
Rˆ† |ψ1 = |ψ6 , Rˆ† |ψ2 = |ψ1 , ..., Rˆ† |ψ6 = |ψ5 .
Also, show that Rˆ is unitary.
3. When the probability of the electron jumping from one site to a contiguous one to the left or right
is neglected, its energy is described by the Hamiltonian Hˆ0, whose eigenstates are the six states
|ψn all having the same eigenvalue E0, namely,
Hˆ0 |ψn = E0 |ψn .
The possibility that the electron will jump from one site to another is modeled by adding to the
Hamiltonian Hˆ0 a perturbation Vˆ such that
Vˆ |ψ1 = −a|ψ6 − a|ψ2 , Vˆ |ψ2 = −a|ψ1 − a|ψ3 , ...,
Vˆ |ψ6 = −a|ψ5 − a|ψ1 .
Show that Rˆ commutes with the total Hamiltonian Hˆ = Hˆ0 + Vˆ. From this deduce the eigenstates
and eigenvalues of Hˆ. In these eigenstates is the electron localized?
Hint: The N distinct complex roots of zN = 1 are given by

Solution
Part 1
The “hopping” operator Rˆ satisfies
Rˆ |ψi = |ψi+1 i = 1, ... , 6 , and |ψ7 = |ψ1 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press188 Mathematical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
yielding Rˆ 6 = 1ˆ. Let |r be an eigenstate of Rˆ with eigenvalue λ, namely Rˆ |r = λ|r. We find
|r = Rˆ 6 |r = λRˆ 5 |r = λ2
Rˆ 4 |r = ··· = λ6 |r =⇒ λ6 = 1 ,
which has the solutions
λn = e2πin/6 = eiπn/3 n = 1, ... ,6.
To determine the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue λn, we first obtain the representation of
Rˆ in the basis |ψi,

Explicitly, the linear system reads
c6 = λnc1, c1 = λnc2 , c2 = λnc3 , c3 = λnc4 , c4 = λnc5 , c5 = λnc6 ,
and, since |λn | = 1, it can also be written as
c1 = λ∗
nc6, c2 = λ∗
nc1 , c3 = λ∗
nc2 , c4 = λ∗

|rn = c6

In fact, Rˆ is unitary, since
ψj|RˆRˆ† |ψi = ψj|Rˆ |ψi−1 = ψj|ψi = δij =⇒ RˆRˆ† = 1ˆ ,
and similarly Rˆ†Rˆ = 1ˆ, which also implies that [Rˆ , Rˆ†] = 0, that is, Rˆ is a normal operator. The
unitarity of Rˆ can also be shown by multiplying out the matrices representing Rˆ and Rˆ†.

The eigenvalues En are partly degenerate, since

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press7 Physical Interpretation: Postulates
of Quantum Mechanics
The physical interpretation of the mathematical framework outlined in the previous chapter rests on
a number of “postulates”, which are introduced here:1
• The physical state of a system is represented by a vector – more precisely, a “ray”, a normalized
vector – in the state space E, a Hilbert space; as a consequence, a linear combination of state
vectors is also a state vector (linear superposition).
• Measurable physical quantities – observables – are represented by hermitian operators acting in E;
if Aˆ is an observable then there exists a basis consisting of eigenstates of Aˆ.
• The only possible result of a measurement of an observable Aˆ is one of its eigenvalues. If the
spectrum of Aˆ is discrete, the results obtained by measuring Aˆ are quantized.
• When the observable Aˆ is measured on a system in state |ψ, the probability of obtaining the
discrete eigenvalue ai is
p(ai) =

gi
k=1
|φ(k)
i |ψ|2 = ψ|Pˆi|ψ with Pˆi =

gi
k=1
|φ(k)
i φ(k)
i | and ψ|ψ = 1 , (7.1)
where |φ(k)
i  are the (normalized) eigenstates of Aˆ corresponding to eigenvalue ai, having
degeneracy gi,
Aˆ |φ(k)
i  = ai|φ(k)
i  , k = 1, ... , gi , (7.2)
and Pˆi is the projection operator onto the subspace spanned by the eigenstates |φ(k)
i . Of course

i p(ai) = 1, which follows from the completeness of the basis of Aˆ eigenstates. Note that when ai
is degenerate, there is an infinity of possible bases in the subspace of E belonging to the eigenvalue
ai; however, the probability p(ai) is independent of the basis chosen.
If the observable Aˆ has a continuous spectrum then the probability that we measure an eigenvalue
centered at α in an interval dα is obtained as
p(α)dα = ψ| Pˆ
α |ψ dα =

gα
k=1
|φ(k)
α |ψ|2

dα , Pˆ
α =

gα
k=1
|φ(k)
α φ(k)
α | , (7.3)
and p(α) can be thought of as a probability density. This interpretation is in line with that of |ψ(r)|
2
as the probability density for the particle to be found at position r. Indeed, the position operator
has a (non-degenerate) continuous spectrum, rˆ |φr = r|φr, and the probability density that the
system will be found at r is |φr |ψ|2 = |ψ(r)|
2.
If many measurements of the observable Aˆ are performed with the system always in the same
state |ψ, then the average value, denoted as Aˆ, of the results obtained in these measurements is
given by
1 There is a large amount of literature on the interpretation of quantum mechanics and its conceptual difficulties. A good
summary is given in S. Weinberg 2012, Lectures on Quantum Mechanics, Cambridge University Press, Section 3.7.

Aˆ =

i
aip(ai) , (7.4)
where the sum is over all possible results. This average can also be expressed as the expectation
value of Aˆ on the state |ψ,
Aˆ = ψ|Aˆ|ψ , (7.5)
as implied by the completeness of the basis of eigenstates of Aˆ,
Aˆ = Aˆ

• If the measurement of the observable Aˆ on the system in state |ψ gives the result ai then the
state of the system immediately after the measurement is either |φi, if ai is non-degenerate, or
a normalized linear combination obtained by projecting |ψ onto the subspace spanned by the
eigenstates |φ(k)
i , if ai is degenerate. We can encompass both cases by writing
normalized state directly after measurement = Pˆi |ψ

ψ|Pˆi|ψ
, (7.7)
where Pˆi is the projection operator onto the subspace corresponding to eigenvalue ai.
If the observable Aˆ has a continuous spectrum then its measurement on a system described by
the state |ψ will yield a result α0 to within Δα, with probability
 α0+Δα/2
α0−Δα/2
dα

gα
k=1
|φ(k)
α |ψ|2 . (7.8)
The state immediately after the measurement is given as follows:
normalized state directly after measurement = PˆΔα (α0) |ψ

ψ| PˆΔα (α0) |ψ
, (7.9)
where we define the projection operator
PˆΔα (α0) =
 α0+Δα/2
α0−Δα/2
dα

gα
k=1
|φ(k)
α φ(k)
α | . (7.10)
Given that in practice any measuring apparatus has a finite resolution, the definition above is
physically sensible.
The present postulate implies an interaction between the system and the measuring apparatus,
in consequence of which the state of the system is changed; indeed, the measurement results in
the collapse of the state |ψ into the state Pˆi|ψ or PˆΔα (α0) |ψ, up to a normalization constant.
It should be also clear that, if immediately after the first measurement, we carry out a second
measurement of the same observable Aˆ, we are bound to obtain the result ai or α0 within Δα with
certainty, that is, with probability 1. Here, immediately after the first measurement means that the
system has not had time to evolve (time evolution in quantum mechanics is the subject of the next
postulate).

• The time evolution of the state vector |ψ(t) is governed by the Schrodinger equation ¨
i d
dt |ψ(t) = Hˆ(t)|ψ(t) , (7.11)
where Hˆ(t) is the (possibly time-dependent) Hamiltonian. Time evolution in quantum mechanics
is deterministic: given the state |ψ(t0) at time t0, the (unique) state at time t > t0 is obtained
by solving a first-order differential equation. This determinism is at odds with the process of
measurement. If the time-dependent Schrodinger equation were to describe this process then we ¨
could predict that the system would be in some definite state after the measurement, rather than in
any of a number of possible states, each characterized by a specific probability.
7.1 Time Evolution Operator and Time Dependence
of Expectation Values
The time evolution of the state can also be described by an operator (a unitary operator, as it
turns out),
|ψ(t) = Uˆ(t, t0)|ψ(t0) t ≥ t0 , (7.12)
where Uˆ(t, t0) satisfies
i d
dtUˆ(t, t0) = Hˆ(t) Uˆ(t, t0) , Uˆ(t0, t0) = 1ˆ . (7.13)
When Hˆ is time independent, this equation is easily solved to yield
Uˆ(t, t0) = e−iHˆ(t−t0)/ . (7.14)
However, when Hˆ is time dependent, a formal solution can be obtained by first converting the
differential equation into an integral equation,
Uˆ(t, t0) = 1ˆ − i

 t
t0
dt Hˆ(t

dtn Hˆ(t1) ··· Hˆ(tn) + ··· ; (7.16)
the nested time-integration limits should be noted. In general, the Hamiltonians at different times will
not commute, so the ordering in the expansion above is important.
The unitarity of Uˆ(t, t0) is obvious when the Hamiltonian is time independent. When it is time
dependent, we observe that the evolution from t to t + η, where η is a small increment, is governed
by Eq. (7.15):
Uˆ(t + η, t) = 1ˆ − i

) Uˆ(t

, t) =⇒ Uˆ(t + η, t) = 1ˆ − i
η

Hˆ(t) + O(η2) , (7.17)
where Uˆ(t + η, t) is unitary up to linear terms in η. For a finite time interval, Uˆ(t, t0) can be written
as the product
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press195 7.1 Time Evolution Operator and Time Dependence of Expectation Values
Uˆ(t, t0) = Uˆ(t, t − η) Uˆ(t − η, t − 2η) ··· Uˆ(t0 + 2η, t0 + η) Uˆ(t0 + η, t0) ; (7.18)
we note that the product of unitary operators is unitary. Thus time evolution preserves the
normalization of the state, that is, ψ(t)|ψ(t) = ψ(t0)|ψ(t0).
Having established how states evolve in time, we can deduce how expectation values change
in time. Let Aˆ be an observable and let Hˆ be the system Hamiltonian, both assumed to be time
independent. The expectation value of Aˆ will generally depend on time,
Aˆ(t) = ψ(t)| Aˆ |ψ(t) , (7.19)
and this time dependence can be made explicit by expanding |ψ(t) on a basis consisting of
eigenstates of Hˆ:
|ψ(t) =

e−iEi(t−t0)/ c(k)
i (t0)|φ(k)
i  , c(k)
i (t0) = φ(k)
i |ψ(t0) . (7.20)
Using the Schrodinger equation, the rate of change of the expectation value can be expressed as ¨

We conclude that the expectation value is time independent, namely, the observable is a constant of
motion if it commutes with the Hamiltonian,2

Hˆ , Aˆ  = 0 =⇒ Aˆ is a constant of motion . (7.22)
Obviously, since Hˆ commutes with itself, the average value of the energy for a system in a state
|ψ(t) is constant in time. The above results can also be used to derive Ehrenfest’s relations (see
Problems 10 and 12 in Chapter 3; the latter relates to Ehrenfest’s relations for a charged particle in
an electromagnetic field),
d

m

for a system described by the Hamiltonian
Hˆ = pˆ 2
2m
+ Vˆ(rˆ) . (7.24)
The above relations resemble Hamilton’s equations of classical mechanics. However, they do not
imply that the averages rˆ(t) and pˆ(t) generally follow the laws of classical mechanics, except
for the special cases in which the particle is free or the potential energy operator Vˆ(rˆ) is linear or
quadratic in rˆ.
2 The above relation has a counterpart in classical mechanics, where a quantity A(qi, pi) is a function of the generalized
coordinates and momenta qi and pi with i = 1, ... , n (n is the number of degrees of freedom) is conserved, that is, a
constant of motion, if it has vanishing Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian H(qi, pi): {A , H} = 0. Poisson brackets are
generally defined for any two functions B and C of the qi and pi as

.
In particular, note the fundamental Poisson brackets {qi , pj} = δij. The transition from classical to quantum mechanics is
implemented via the replacement qi, pi −→ qˆi, ˆpi and by requiring that [ ˆqi , ˆpj] = i {qi , pj}. Indeed, we have the general
correspondence [ Bˆ , Cˆ ] −→ i {B , C}.

7.2 Schrödinger and Heisenberg Pictures
In the Schrodinger picture (the S-picture, denoted by the subscript ¨ S below), states carry the time
dependence,
|ψS (t) = Uˆ(t, t0) |ψS (t0) . (7.25)
The time dependence can be transferred from the states to the operators by defining
|ψH = Uˆ† (t, t0) |ψS (t) = |ψS (t0) , (7.26)
and it follows that
Aˆ
H(t) = Uˆ† (t, t0) Aˆ
S (t) Uˆ(t, t0) =⇒ Aˆ
S (t) = Uˆ(t, t0) Aˆ
H(t) Uˆ† (t, t0) , (7.27)
where the subscript H stands for the Heisenberg picture (H-picture).3 In the H-picture, the states are
time independent and the operators carry the time dependence. The definitions are such that matrix
elements of H-picture operators between H-picture states at time t are the same as those of S-picture
operators between S-picture states at the same time, namely
ψH|Aˆ
H(t)|φH = ψS (t)|Aˆ
S (t)|φS (t) . (7.28)
We can determine how Aˆ
H(t) evolves in time. Recalling the general relation
i d
dtUˆ(t, t0) = HˆS (t) Uˆ(t, t0) , (7.29)
it is easily seen that

Note that if the Hamiltonian in the S-picture is time independent then
Uˆ(t, t0) = e−iHˆS (t−t0)/ =⇒ HˆH(t) = eiHˆS (t−t0)/ HS e−iHˆS (t−t0)/ = HS , (7.31)
and the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in the H-picture are time independent, as they are in the
S-picture, since
ψH|HˆH(t)|φH = ψS (t)|HˆS |φS (t) = ψS (t0)|HˆS |φS (t0) . (7.32)

system. Show that the probability p(ai) that the result of a measurement of Aˆ will be ai is independent

Problem 2 Explicit Time Dependence ofAˆ(t)
Using the basis of Hamiltonian eigenstates (stationary states), make explicit the time dependence
of the expectation value Aˆ(t) for a generic observable Aˆ. Under what condition is Aˆ(t) time
independent? Justify your answer.

Problem 3 Time–Energy Relation
Suppose that Aˆ is an observable for a system governed by the Hamiltonian Hˆ. Define the time
τA = ΔA

,
where ΔA is the standard deviation
ΔA =

.
Show that τA ΔH ≥ /2. Note that, while ΔA is generally time dependent, ΔH, similarly defined, is
not. Provide a physical interpretation for the time τA.
Solution

which yields the required relation. In particular, τA can be interpreted as the time required for the
average of Aˆ to change by an amount equal to its uncertainty ΔA; equivalently, Aˆ(t1)Aˆ(t0) for
t1 > t0, if the time interval t1 − t0 is small compared with τA, which characterizes the rate of change
of the physical property represented by Aˆ.
Note that, if the system is in one of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, i.e., in a “stationary” state,
so that
|ψ(t0) = |φ(k)
i  =⇒ |ψ(t) = e−iEi(t−t0)/ |φ(k)
i  ,
then dAˆ(t)/dt = 0 regardless of whether Aˆ is a constant of motion or not, that is, whether it commutes
with Hˆ or not. The characteristic time τA becomes infinite in this case.
Problem 4 Measurements on a Generic Wave Function ψ(r)
A particle is in a state represented by the normalized wave function ψ(r). Calculate:
1. The probability that a measurement of the momentum component ˆpx will yield a result between
p1 and p2;
2. The probability that a simultaneous measurement of the position component ˆx and momentum
component ˆpz will yield results x1 ≤ x ≤ x2 and pz ≥ 0, respectively;
3. The probability that a measurement of the observable ˆu = ˆx + yˆ + zˆ will yield a result between u1
and u2.

Solution
Part 1
One way to obtain this probability is to compute the momentum-space wave function,
ψ(p) = φp|ψ =

dr φp|φrφr |ψ =
 dr
(2π)3/2 e−ip·r/ ψ(r) ,
where |φp and |φr are the momentum and position eigenstates, respectively, with
pˆ |φp = p |φp , rˆ |φr = r |φr , φr |ψp = eip·r/
(2π)3/2 .
The probability of measuring a px value between p1 and p2 is then obtained as

where we have expressed the completeness in the state spaces Ey and Ez in terms of the ˆy and ˆz
eigenstates, respectively. Of course, we are free to choose any bases we like in Ey and Ez, such as,
for example, those of the ˆpy and ˆpz eigenstates, as we did previously. The probability then follows by
evaluating the expectation value of Pˆpx ∈[p1,p2] for the state |ψ,

This probability is easily verified to be same as that obtained previously.
Part 2
Following the discussion above, we choose the basis |φx,y,pz = |φx⊗|φy⊗|φpz in the state space
E = Ex ⊗ Ey ⊗ Ez, and the relevant projection operator is written in the present case as

Part 3
The observable ˆu commutes with any of the components of the position observable rˆ, and hence
uˆ |φx⊗|φy⊗|φz = (x + y + z) |φx⊗|φy⊗|φz .
In particular, the states |φu,y,z = |φu−y−z⊗|φy⊗|φz are infinitely degenerate eigenstates of
uˆ corresponding to the eigenvalue u (u assumes continuous values), since for any y and z we
have ˆu |φu,y,z = u|φu,y,z. However, ˆu, ˆy, and ˆz form a complete set of commuting observables.

Of course, we could have taken either ˆu, ˆx, ˆz or ˆu, ˆx, ˆy as complete sets of commuting observables.
The probability P(u1 ≤ u ≤ u2) calculated above would be the same.
Problem 5 Measurements of Non-Commuting Observables
Consider three non-commuting observables Aˆ, Bˆ, and Cˆ. Observable Aˆ is measured, yielding the
non-degenerate eigenvalue a with corresponding eigenstate |ψa. Then, the following two different
experiments are carried out.
1. In the first experiment, before the system has had any time to evolve after the measurement of Aˆ,
observable Cˆ is measured, yielding the non-degenerate eigenvalue c with corresponding eigenstate
|χc. Calculate the probability Pa (c) of measuring c.
2. In the second experiment, observables Bˆ and Cˆ are measured in rapid succession so that the system
has not had any time to evolve between the measurements of Aˆ and Bˆ and those of Bˆ and Cˆ.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press201 7.3 Problems
Suppose these measurements yield, respectively, the non-degenerate eigenvalues b and c, where
|ϕb is the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue b. Calculate the probability Pa (b, c) of
measuring b and c.
3. Assuming that the eigenvalues of Bˆ are all non-degenerate, show that
Pa (c) =

b
Pa (b, c) + something else ,
and provide an expression for the “something else.” What is then the essential difference between
the two experiments? What conclusions can you draw?
Solution
Part 1
We find
Pa (c) = |χc |ψa|2 .
Part 2
Given that the system is in state |ψa (after the measurement of Aˆ yielding a), we find, for the
probability of measuring b,
Pa (b) = |ϕb |ψa|2 .
Then, the probability of measuring c with the system in state |ϕb is given by
Pb (c) = |χc |ϕb|2 ,
and hence the probability of measuring b and c with the system in state |ψa reads
Pa (b, c) = Pb (c)Pa (b) = |χc |ϕb|2 |ϕb |ψa|2 .
Part 3
Using the completeness of the eigenstates of Bˆ (the corresponding eigenvalues are assumed to be all
non-degenerate), we can express the amplitude χc |ψa as follows:
χc |ψa =

b
χc |ϕbϕb |ψa ,

In the second experiment, the measurement of Bˆ yielding the result b forces the system into the
state |ϕb, while in the first experiment, when Bˆ is not measured, the system can transition into the

amplitudes rather than probabilities, otherwise crucial interference effects are missed.
Problem 6 Energy Measurements for a Particle in a One-Dimensional
Infinitely Deep Well
A particle in an infinitely deep one-dimensional potential well V(x), for which V(x) = 0 for |x| ≤ a/2
and V(x) = ∞ for |x| > a/2, is at time t = 0 in a state
|ψ(0) = c1 |ψ1 + c2 |ψ2 + c3 |ψ3 + c4 |ψ4 ,
where the |ψn are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H = p2/(2m) + V(x). Suppose an energy
measurement is performed: what is the probability of finding a value smaller than 3π22/(ma2)?
What are the mean value and root-mean-square deviation of the energy in state |ψ(0)? Obtain the
state |ψ(t) at time t and show that the results above remain valid for any t: why is this?
The energy is measured and the result 8π22/(ma2) is obtained. After the measurement, what is
the state of the system? What is the result if the energy is measured again?
Solution
The eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of a particle in an infinitely deep potential
well are
Hˆ |ψn = En |ψn , En = π22
2ma2 n2 , n = 1, 2, ...
The state |ψ(0) is assumed to be normalized. The probability of measuring energy Em is given by
p(Em) = |ψm|ψ(0)|2 ,
where
ψm|ψ(0) = c1 δm,1 + c2 δm,2 + c3 δm,3 + c4 δm,4 .
We define
0 = π22
2ma2 ,
so that the eigenvalues can be written as En = 0n2, and the probability of measuring energy,
Em < 3 π22
ma2 = 60 ,
is given by
p(E < 60) = p(E1) + p(E2) = |c1 |
2 + |c2 |
2 .
The expectation value of H is given by
H = ψ(0)|Hˆ|ψ(0) =

Eip(Ei) .

The variance of the energy is given by

and the root-mean-square deviation is 
(ΔH)2.
The state at time t follows from
|ψ(t) = e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) =

4
i=1
ci e−iHtˆ / |ψi =

4
i=1
ci e−iEit/ |ψi .
Note that p(Em) is constant in time, since
p(Em, t) = ψ(t)|Pˆm|ψ(t) = ψ(0)|eiHtˆ / Pˆm e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) = ψ(0)|Pˆm |ψ(0) = p(Em, 0) ,
where we have defined the projector onto eigenstate |ψm as
Pˆm = |ψmψm| ,
and have used the fact that it commutes with Hˆ and hence with the time evolution operator. Therefore
the probability of measuring an energy less than 60 is the same as before. A similar argument shows
that the variance is time independent; indeed,
ψ(t)|(Hˆ − H)
2 |ψ(t) = ψ(0)|eiHtˆ / (Hˆ − H)
2
e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) = ψ(0)|(Hˆ − H)
2 |ψ(0) .
The energy 160 is that of the third excited state, having n = 4. Right after the measurement, say at
time t1, the state |ψ(t1) collapses into the state |ψ4. The latter then evolves as
|ψ(t > t1) = e−iHˆ(t−t1)/ |ψ4 = e−iE4 (t−t1)/ |ψ4 .
If the energy is measured again at some later time t > t1, the result E4 will be obtained with certainty,
namely p(E4) = 1.

1. Consider the four sets of observables Hˆ, Hˆ x, (Hˆ x, Hˆ y), and (Hˆ, Hˆ x). Which of them constitutes a
complete set of commuting observables?
2. Consider a particle whose wave function is given by

measurement yields the result π22/(2ma2), what will the results of a subsequent measurement
of Hˆ y be? With what probabilities?

is carried out. What are the probabilities of obtaining Ex = 9π22/(2ma2) and py at p0 in dp?

Solution
We consider the state space E = Ex ⊗ Ey. The eigenstates of Hˆ in this space are the tensor product
of those of Hˆ x and Hˆ y in state spaces Ex and Ey, respectively; that is, if Hˆ x |ψnx  = Enx |ψnx  and
Hˆ y |ψny  = Eny |ψny  then

The eigenfunctions of Hˆ x (or Hˆ y) are easily obtained from solutions of the Schrodinger equation ¨

and the (normalized) eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues are given by

a
sin(nπx/a) En = (nπ)2
2ma2 ,
where n = 1, 2, ... . The (normalized) eigenfunctions of the total Hamiltonian Hˆ are

.
For given nx and ny we list in Table 7.1 a few of the resulting n2
x + n2
y (in increasing order). We see
that generally when nx = ny there is no degeneracy, while when nx  ny the degeneracy is two-fold.
However, additional degeneracy can occur in special cases; for example, the states ψ5,5, ψ7,1, and
ψ1,7 are degenerate, with energy 25(π)2/(ma2).
Part 1
We see that Hˆ and Hˆ x do not constitute a complete set of commuting observables. For example,
specifying the eigenvalue 10(π)2/(2ma2) of Hˆ does not uniquely specify the state of the
particle, since this eigenvalue is two-fold degenerate with eigenfunctions ψ3,1 (x, y) and ψ1,3 (x, y).
Similarly, each eigenvalue n2
x (π)2/(2ma2) of Hˆ x is infinitely degenerate in the state space E, since
ψnx,1 (x, y), ψnx,2 (x, y), . . . are all eigenfunctions of Hˆ x corresponding to this same eigenvalue.
By contrast, (Hˆ x, Hˆ y) and (Hˆ, Hˆ x) constitute complete sets of commuting observables.

Problem 8 Measurements of Three Observables in a Three-Dimensional

Consider a system with a three-dimensional state space. The Hamiltonian Hˆ has a non-degenerate
eigenvalue E1 = E0 with (normalized) eigenstate |φ1 and a degenerate eigenvalue E2 = 2E0 with

1. At t = 0 the energy of the system is measured. What values can be found and with what
probabilities? Calculate H and the root-mean-square deviation ΔH for the system in the state
|ψ(0).
2. Suppose that at t = 0, instead of Hˆ, we measure the observable Aˆ, which in the basis |φ1, |φ2,

so that the root-mean-square deviation is given by
ΔH =

Hˆ2−Hˆ2 = E0
2 .
Part 2
We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of Aˆ. It is easy to verify that Hˆ and Aˆ commute;
hence, Aˆ |φ1 is an eigenstate of Hˆ with eigenvalue E1. Since E1 is non-degenerate, it follows that
|φ1 must be an eigenstate of Aˆ; it is indeed such an eigenstate, with eigenvalue a, as is obvious
from the matrix representation of Aˆ. It is only necessary to diagonalize Aˆ in the degenerate subspace
belonging to the eigenvalue E2 of Hˆ. We find
det

= 0 =⇒ λ± = ± a ,
with corresponding eigenstates
|ϕ± = 1
√
2

|φ2±|φ3

.
We see that the eigenvalue a is doubly degenerate, with eigenstates |φ1 and |ϕ+, while the
eigenvalue −a is non-degenerate with eigenstate |ϕ−. We obtain for the probabilities of measuring
a and −a,
pa = |φ1 |ψ(0)|2 + |ϕ+|ψ(0)|2 = 1 , p−a = |ϕ−|ψ(0)|2 = 0 .
Note that the states |φ1, |ϕ+, and |ϕ− are simultaneous eigenstates of Hˆ and Aˆ with eigenvalues,
respectively, E0, 2E0, and 2E0, and a, a, and −a. As a matter of fact, Hˆ and Aˆ form a complete set of
commuting observables.

Since Aˆ commutes with Hˆ, the expectation value ψ(t)|Aˆ|ψ(t) is time independent and hence equal
to a, given that a measurement of Aˆ with the system in state |ψ(0) yields with certainty the result a.
By contrast, it is easily verified that Bˆ does not commute with Hˆ, and hence

,
and so the expectation value, as expected, is time dependent.
Part 5
The observables Hˆ and Aˆ commute and the probabilities of measuring a and −a at time t are the same
as those at time t = 0, since, for example,
pa (t) = ψ(t)|Pˆ
a |ψ(t) = ψ(0)| eiHtˆ / Pˆ
a e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) = ψ(0)|Pˆ
a |ψ(0) = Pa (0) ,
where we have defined the projection operator
Pˆ
a = |φ1φ1 | + |ϕ+ϕ+| ,
and have used the fact that
[ Pˆ
a, Hˆ ] = 0 =⇒ eiHtˆ / Pˆ
a e−iHtˆ / = Pˆ
a .
By contrast, the observables Bˆ and Hˆ do not commute. The eigenvalues of Bˆ are −b (non￾degenerate) with eigenstate
|χ− = 1

and b (doubly degenerate) with eigenstates |φ3 and

Problem 9 Consequences of a Sudden Change in the Potential
In a nuclear β decay, a proton is instantaneously changed by the weak interaction into a neutron,
positron (e+), and electron neutrino (νe). The positron and electron neutrino leave the nucleus without
suffering any interactions on their way out (or, rather, minor ones in the case of the positron).
However, the average attractive potential felt by the proton is different from that felt by the neutron
(for one thing, the neutron does not carry any charge and is therefore unaffected by the repulsive
Coulomb potential due to the remaining protons in the nucleus). This is the motivation for the
following problem.
Consider a particle of mass m subject to an attractive δ-function potential given by −v0 δ(x) (in
the notation of Chapter 4).
1. Show that the complete set of energy eigenfunctions can be written as

for the bound state, and
ψk,±(x) = 1

2π
	
e±ikx − v0
v0 + 2ik eik|x|


,
for the doubly degenerate ± scattering states corresponding to incident wave from, respectively,
the left and the right.
2. Show that the bound-state wave function is orthogonal to the scattering-state wave functions.
Also, show that the wave functions ψk,±(x) satisfy the continuum normalization

3. Suppose that the particle is initially in the bound state. Suddenly, the strength of the potential v0 is
changed to v0 > v0. Assume that this sudden change does not affect the state of the particle. What
is the wave function ψ(x, t) at time t, given that it is
ψ(x, 0) =
v0
2 e−v0 |x|/2 ,
at the initial time t = 0? Compute the probabilities that the particle is found in the ground state and
± scattering states corresponding to the −v0 δ(x) potential.
4. Evaluate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with the −v0 δ(x) potential and hence obtain
the energy required to change v0 to v0.

and are in agreement with those derived in Problem 1 of Chapter 5 for a repulsive δ-function
potential, provided that v0 −→ −v0. Here, we have defined
A(k) = − v0
v0 + 2ik , B(k) = 2ik
v0 + 2ik .
Part 2
It is convenient to introduce the parameter a = 2/v0. Orthogonality of the bound and continuum states
follows from

Problem 10 Time Evolution ofx(t)and p(t)in a One-Dimensional
Linear Potential
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional potential given by
Vˆ(xˆ) = −F0 xˆ , F0 > 0 .
1. Write down Ehrenfest’s relations for the mean values of ˆx and ˆp. Integrate the equations and
compare the results with those in classical mechanics.
2. Show that the root-mean-square deviation of ˆp does not change in time.
Solution
Part 1
Ehrenfest’s relations read
d
dt xˆ(t) = 1
m
ψ(t)| pˆ |ψ(t) , d
dt pˆ(t) = −ψ(t)| Vˆ
(xˆ) |ψ(t) ,
where Vˆ
(xˆ) = −F0 is a constant. We therefore find that
d
dt pˆ(t) = F0 =⇒ pˆ(t) = p0 + F0 (t − t0) .
Inserting this result into the right-hand side of the equation for ˆx, it follows that
xˆ(t) = x0 + p0
m
(t − t0) +
F0
2m
(t − t0)
2 ,
where the constants x0 and p0 are given by
x0 = xˆ(t0) , p0 = pˆ(t0) .
The expressions above for xˆ(t) and pˆ(t) are identical to those obtained in classical mechanics for
a particle under the action of a constant force F0.
Part 2
The variance,
(Δp)
2 = ψ(t)|(pˆ − p(t))
2 |ψ(t) ,
does not change in time because its time derivative vanishes. We consider the time dependence of
the expectation value of the operator Aˆ = (pˆ − p(t))2 to find
d

It follows that

Since the variance is constant in time, so is the root-mean-square deviation 
(Δp)2.
Problem 11 The Virial Theorem in One Dimension
Let |φn be the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian Hˆ with Hˆ |φn = En |φn, where n is a discrete index.
Given an arbitrary operator Aˆ, show the expectation value of its commutator with Hˆ on any state |φn
vanishes. Next, suppose that Hˆ describes a particle in one dimension and subject to a potential Vˆ(xˆ),
Hˆ = pˆ 2
2m
+ Vˆ(xˆ) .
Evaluate the commutators 
Hˆ, ˆx

,

Hˆ, ˆp 
, and 
Hˆ, ˆx pˆ

, and deduce that the expectation values
of ˆp on the eigenstates |φn vanish. Establish a relation between the expectation values on |φn
of the kinetic energy operator and the expectation values of the operator ˆx Vˆ
(xˆ), where Vˆ
(xˆ) is the
derivative of the operator Vˆ(xˆ). Assuming that Vˆ(xˆ) = V0 xˆ n with n integer (n = 2, 4, ... ) and V0 > 0,
establish a relation between the expectation values of the kinetic energy and potential energy.
Solution
We have
φn | AˆHˆ − HˆAˆ 
[Aˆ , Hˆ]
|φn = Enφn |Aˆ|φn − Enφn |Aˆ|φn = 0 ,
where in the second step we have used the hermiticity of Hˆ. We also have
[Hˆ , ˆx] = 1
2m
[ ˆp2 , ˆx] = pˆ
2m
[ ˆp , ˆx] + [ ˆp , ˆx] pˆ
2m = −i

m
pˆ ,
since Vˆ(xˆ) commutes with ˆx. Similarly, it follows that
[Hˆ , ˆp] = [Vˆ(xˆ), ˆp] = i

[ ˆp2 , ˆx] ˆp + xˆ [Vˆ(xˆ) , ˆp] = i xˆ Vˆ
(xˆ) − i

Using the above result,
pˆ = i
m
 [Hˆ , ˆx] ,
we deduce
φn |pˆ|φn = i

 φn |[Hˆ , ˆx]|φn = 0 .
From the relation
φn |[Hˆ , ˆx pˆ]|φn = 0 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press218 Physical Interpretation: Postulates of Quantum Mechanics
and evaluating the commutator, we obtain

Problem 12 Interaction Representation
Consider a system governed by the Hamiltonian Hˆ0 (t) and the corresponding time evolution operator
Uˆ0 (t, t0), satisfying
i d
dtUˆ0 (t, t0) = Hˆ0 (t) Uˆ0 (t, t0) , Uˆ0 (t0, t0) = 1ˆ .
Now, assume that the system is perturbed in such a way that its Hamiltonian becomes Hˆ(t) with
Hˆ(t) = Hˆ0 (t) + Vˆ(t) .
The state vector |ψI(t) of the system in the “interaction” picture is obtained from the Schrodiner- ¨
picture state vector |ψS (t) via the unitary transformation
|ψI(t) = Uˆ†
0 (t, t0) |ψS (t) .
1. Show that the time evolution of |ψI(t) is given by
i d

I(t) |ψI(t) ,
where Vˆ
I(t) is the representation of the perturbation operator Vˆ(t) in the interaction picture,
Vˆ
I(t) = Uˆ†
0 (t, t0) Vˆ(t) Uˆ0 (t, t0) .
2. By converting the above differential equation into an integral equation,

where |ψI(t0) = |ψS (t0), show that the state vector |ψI(t) can be expanded in a power series
of Vˆ

Solution
Part 1
Using the unitarity of Uˆ0 (t, t0), we express the Schrodinger-picture state as ¨
|ψS (t) = Uˆ0 (t, t0) |ψI(t) .
It satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation ¨
i d
dt |ψS (t) = [Hˆ0 (t) + Vˆ(t)] |ψS (t) ,

We now note that, since Uˆ0 (t, t0) is the time evolution operator corresponding to Hˆ0 (t), it satisfies
i d
dtUˆ0 (t, t0) = Hˆ0 (t) Uˆ0 (t, t0) ,
which, when inserted into the above equation, yields

Part 2
At time t0 we have U0 (t0, t0) = 1ˆ and hence |ψI(t) satisfies the initial condition |ψI(t0) = |ψS (t0).
By formally integrating over time both sides of

This integral equation can be solved by iteration. We set the zeroth-order correction as |ψ(0)
I (t) =
|ψI(t0) = |ψS (t0) and substitute it into the right-hand side of the integral equation, to obtain the

Problem 13 Two-Flavor Neutrino Oscillations
This problem deals with the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations in a simplified scenario, in which
the neutrino flavors are two (the electron and muon neutrinos), rather than three (the electron, muon,
and tau neutrinos) observed in nature. We denote these two flavors by νe and νμ, respectively. It turns
out that an electron neutrino of momentum p is given by
|νe; p = cos θ |ν1; p + sin θ |ν2; p ,
where |νk; p with k = 1, 2 is an eigenstate of the relativistic free-particle Hamiltonian
Hˆ k = c

pˆ 2 + (mk c)2 ,
that is,
Hˆ k |νk; p = Ek |νk; p , Ek = c

p2 + (mk c)2 ,
where mk and c are, respectively, the mass and speed of light, and
νk; p|νl; q = δkl δ(p − q) .
A muon neutrino of momentum p is given, in terms of the Hamiltonian eigenstates defined above,
by the orthogonal linear combination
|νμ; p = − sin θ |ν1, ; p + cos θ |ν2; p .
1. Assume that at time t = 0 the neutrino state is |ψ(0) = |νe; p. Calculate the probability pνe→νμ (t)
that at time t the neutrino is in state |ψ(t) = |νμ; p, that is, the neutrino has undergone the flavor
oscillation νe −→ νμ. Calculate also the survival probability pνe→νe (t). Alternatively, assume that
the neutrino state at time t = 0 is |ψ(0) = |νμ; p, and calculate pνμ→νe (t) and pνμ→νμ (t).
2. Assume that the momentum p (that is, the eigenvalue of the momentum operator) is such that
|p| 
 mkc. Show that, to leading order in Δm2 =m2
1 − m2
2, the probability for the conversion
νe −→ νμ can be written as
pνe→νμ (L) = sin2 (2 θ) sin2

where L is the distance traveled by the neutrino in time t.

Solution
Part 1
The Hamiltonian eigenstates evolve in time according to
e−iHˆkt/ |νk; p = e−iEkt/ |νk; p ,
and, since |ψ(0) = |νe; p, the evolved state at time t is obtained as
|ψ(t) = cos θ e−iE1t/ |ν1; p + sin θ e−iE2t/ |ν2; p .
It is convenient to define
E± = E1 ± E2

and hence that the muon and electron neutrino survival probabilities are the same.
Before moving on, we note that we can also obtain these probabilities by evaluating the time
evolution operator directly in the flavor basis. To this end, we introduce the orthogonal matrix

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press8 The Harmonic Oscillator
The harmonic oscillator is of a great relevance in quantum mechanics: quadratic Hamiltonians enter
all problems involving quantized oscillations, for example, in the theory of molecular and crystalline
vibrations. The harmonic oscillator also plays a central role in quantum field theory.
8.1 Lowering and Raising Operators and the Number
Operator Representation
The harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian (in one dimension) is given by
Hˆ = pˆ 2
2m
+
mω2
2 xˆ
2 , (8.1)
where ˆx and ˆp are the position and momentum operators and ω is the natural angular frequency of
the oscillator. It is convenient to introduce the following combinations:
aˆ = 1
√
2mω

ipˆ + mωxˆ
 aˆ
† = 1
√
2mω

−ipˆ + mωxˆ
 , (8.2)
known, respectively, as the lowering and raising operator. They satisfy the commutation relations
[ aˆ, ˆa ] = 0 = 
aˆ
†
, ˆa† 
, 
aˆ, ˆa† 
= 1ˆ , (8.3)
where 1ˆ denotes the identity operator (hereafter, the latter will be simply denoted by 1). In terms of
aˆ and ˆa†, the position, momentum, and Hamiltonian operators read
xˆ =
 
2mω
(aˆ
† + aˆ) , ˆp = i
 2
mω
(aˆ
† − aˆ) , Hˆ = ω
	
aˆ
†
aˆ +
1
2


. (8.4)
The eigenstates of Hˆ are the same as those of the number operator Nˆ = ˆa†aˆ. This operator satisfies a
number of properties:
1. Nˆ aˆ = aˆ

Nˆ − 1

and Nˆ aˆ
† = aˆ
† 
Nˆ + 1

; for example,
Nˆ aˆ = aˆ
† aˆ aˆ = 
aˆ aˆ

aˆ = aˆ aˆ
† aˆ − aˆ = aˆ

Nˆ − 1

. (8.5)
2. If |ψ is an eigenstate of Nˆ with eigenvalue λ then λ ≥ 0; indeed,
ψ|Nˆ|ψ = λ ψ|ψ and ψ|Nˆ|ψ = ψ|aˆ
† aˆ|ψ  φ|φ
≥ 0 , (8.6)
224
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press225 8.1 Lowering and Raising Operators and the Number Operator Representation
where the inequality is just the statement that the norm squared of the state |φ = aˆ|ψ is larger
than or equal to 0. We conclude that λ = φ|φ/ψ|ψ ≥ 0; further, if λ = 0 then necessarily
aˆ |ψ = 0.
3. If |ψ is an eigenstate of Nˆ with eigenvalue λ then ˆa |ψ and ˆa† |ψ are also eigenstates of Nˆ, with
eigenvalues λ − 1 and λ + 1, respectively; for example,
Nˆ aˆ |ψ = aˆ

Nˆ − 1

|ψ = aˆ (λ − 1)|ψ = (λ − 1) aˆ |ψ . (8.7)
From property 3 we see that if |ψ is an eigenstate of Nˆ with eigenvalue λ then the sequence of states
aˆ |ψ, ˆa2 |ψ, ... , ˆap |ψ , (8.8)
consists of eigenstates of Nˆ with corresponding eigenvalues
λ − 1 , λ − 2 , ... , λ − p . (8.9)
This set is finite, since the eigenvalues of Nˆ are necessarily positive or zero. Further, according
to property 2, if λ = 0 then ˆa|ψ = 0. Multiplying both sides of this relation by ˆa† leads to
aˆ
† aˆ |ψ =Nˆ |ψ = 0, and |ψ is an eigenstate of Nˆ with eigenvalue 0. Thus there must exist an integer
n such that the action of ˆa on a non-zero eigenstate ˆan |ψ with eigenvalue λ − n yields zero, and
hence λ = n.
By contrast, the sequence of states
aˆ
† |ψ, ˆa† 2 |ψ, ... , ˆa† p |ψ , ... (8.10)
consists of eigenstates of Nˆ with eigenvalues, respectively,
λ + 1 , λ + 2 , ... , λ + p , ... (8.11)
This sequence never terminates, and so the eigenvalues of Nˆ are the non-negative integers
n = 0, 1, 2 ... . We denote the corresponding normalized eigenstates by |n, and obtain for the
Hamiltonian
Hˆ |n = ω(n + 1/2)  En
|n , n = 0, 1, 2, ... , (8.12)
where the eigenvalues En are non-degenerate. The action of ˆa and ˆa† on |n results in1
aˆ |n = √
n |n − 1 , ˆa |0 = 0, ˆa† |n = √
n + 1 |n + 1 , (8.13)
the last of which yields the recursive relation
|n = 1
√
n
aˆ
† |n − 1 =⇒ |n = 1
√
n!
aˆ
† n |0 . (8.14)
1 We will show this for ˆa†. Since ˆa† |n is an eigenstate of Nˆ with eigenvalue n + 1, it must be proportional to |n + 1, that is,
aˆ
† |n = λ|n+1 (λ constant), given that the eigenvalue is non-degenerate. Now, consider the square of the normalized state
|φ = aˆ
† |n with dual bra n| aˆ = φ|,
φ|φ = n| aˆ aˆ
† |n = |λ|
2n + 1|n + 1 = |λ|
2 .
On the left-hand side we can express ˆa aˆ
† in terms of the number operator by noting that
aˆ aˆ
† = 
aˆ, ˆa† 
+ aˆ
† aˆ = 1 + Nˆ ,
which then leads to
|λ|
2 = n| aˆ aˆ
† |n = n|Nˆ + 1|n = (n + 1)n|n = n + 1 ,
implying that |λ| = √
n + 1 (up to an irrelevant phase factor).
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press226 The Harmonic Oscillator
These eigenstates form a basis in the Hilbert space of single-particle states in one dimension,
∞
n=0
|nn| = 1 , m|n = δmn . (8.15)
The matrix elements of ˆa and ˆa† in this basis follow easily as
(a)mn = m|aˆ|n = √
n δm,n−1 , (a†)mn = m|aˆ
† |n = √
n + 1 δm,n+1 . (8.16)
Lastly, it is interesting to point out an alternative interpretation of the operators ˆa, ˆa†, and ω Nˆ.
Since the eigenvalues of Nˆ are the non-negative integers, we may consider ω Nˆ as the Hamiltonian
of a system of particles all in one and the same single-particle state of energy ω. Then, |n represents
the state of the system consisting of n particles while |0 is the vacuum state, in which no particles
are present. The operators ˆa and ˆa† destroy and create particles, respectively, since ˆa|n and a† |n are
proportional to the states of the system with n − 1 and n + 1 particles. Such an interpretation is used
in quantum field theory. For example, the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field in a box is written
as
Hˆ γ =

k

λ=1,2
ωk aˆ
†
kλ aˆkλ , (8.17)
where ˆakλ and ˆa†
kλ destroy and create photons of wave number k, polarization state λ, and energy
ωk = c |k| (c is the speed of light).
8.2 Wave Functions of the Harmonic Oscillator
In this section, we construct the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions ψn (x) = φx |n. We begin by
considering the ground state |0 with the property ˆa|0 = 0, which in the coordinate representation is
expressed as
0 = φx | aˆ |0 =
 ∞
−∞
dx φx | aˆ |φxφx |0 =

−∞
dx φx | aˆ |φx ψ0 (x

differential equation

The Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator is invariant under space inversion. As a consequence, the
(non-degenerate) eigenstates have definite parity. In particular, as expected, the ground-state wave
function ψ0 (x) has parity +, while the excited-state wave functions ψn (x) have parity (−)n, as is
obvious from Eq. (8.25), which under the mapping x −→ −x becomes

8.3 Problems
Problem 1 Some Properties of the Raising and Lowering Operators
Let ˆa and ˆa† be the lowering and raising operators for a harmonic oscillator with [ ˆa , ˆa†] = 1 and
Nˆ = aˆ
† aˆ. Show that
1. the operators ˆa and ˆa† have no inverse;
2. the relations [Nˆ , ˆap] = −p aˆ
p and [Nˆ , ˆa† p] = p aˆ
† p, where p is a positive integer, hold.
Solution
Part 1
There is a non-null state |0 such that ˆa |0 = 0. Suppose that ˆa−1 exists; then, we would have
aˆ
−1 (aˆ |0) = 0 = (aˆ
−1 aˆ)|0 = |0 =⇒ |0 = 0 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press228 The Harmonic Oscillator
a contradiction. Therefore ˆa−1 does not exist. A similar argument for ˆa†, which is defined in such a
way that 0|aˆ
† = 0, shows that its inverse does not exist.
Part 2
Proceed by induction. The relations hold for p = 1, since
[Nˆ , ˆa] = Nˆ aˆ 
aˆNˆ−aˆ

Nˆ = aˆ

Assume the relations also hold for p; then for p + 1 we have
[Nˆ , ˆap+1
] = aˆ
p [Nˆ , ˆa] + [Nˆ , ˆap
] ˆa = −aˆ
p+1 − p aˆ
p+1 = −(p + 1) aˆ
p+1 ,
and similarly for ˆa†.

Solution
Part 1
The probability that the particle will be in an interval dx centered at the origin is
p0 = |ψ0 (0)|
2 dx =
mω
π
1/2
dx .
Part 2
Directly after the measurement the particle is in the eigenstate |φx of the position operator with
eigenvalue x = 0, namely |φ0. Recalling that
φx |φx = δ(x − x
) ,
we obtain
ψ(x, 0) = φx |φ0 = δ(x) .
Part 3
The time evolution of a state is governed by the Hamiltonian,
|ψ(t) = e−iHt/ |ψ(0) .
We denote by |n the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with eigenvalues ω(n+1/2).
Using the completeness of the basis |n, we can express |ψ(t) as
|ψ(t) =
∞
n=0
e−iω(n+1/2)t
cn |n , cn = n|ψ(0) ,
or, in the coordinate representation,
ψ(x, t) = φx |ψ(t) =

n=0
e−iω(n+1/2)t
cnφx |n =
∞
n=0
e−iω(n+1/2)t
cnψn (x) ,
where the ψn (x) are the harmonic oscillator wave functions. In our case we have |ψ(0) = |φ0 and
cn = n|φ0 =
 ∞
−∞
dx n|φxφx |φ0 =
 ∞
−∞
dx ψ∗
n (x) δ(x) = ψ∗
n (0) = ψn (0) ,
since the harmonic oscillator wave functions are taken to be real. The ψn (x) have definite parity,
ψn (−x) = (−1)
nψn (x) ,
implying that
ψ(x, t) =
∞
even n=0
e−iω(n+1/2)t
cnψn (x) .
Part 4
The probability of measuring the ground-state energy is given by
pgs = |0|ψ(t)|2 = |c0 |
2 = |ψ0 (0)|
2 =

Part 5
The state |ψ(t) is expanded in terms of eigenstates |n with n even only; hence, m|ψ(t) for any
odd m vanishes.

energy at t = 0 has yielded the result 2 ω. After this measurement, the system evolves undisturbed
for a time t. If a measurement of the energy of particle 1 is then carried out at time t, what are the
possible results and with what probabilities? If, instead of the energy of particle 1, its position is
measured, what results could be found and with what probabilities?
2. Suppose that at t = 0, instead of the total energy, the energy of particle 2 is measured, yielding the
result ω/2. How do the answers to the questions of part 1 change?
Solution
We label the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian as |E(k)
n  with n = 0, 1, ... and k = 1, ... , gn (here,
gn = n + 1 is the degeneracy), namely
Hˆ |E(k)

n  = δmn δkl ,
and
|E(1)
n  = |n, 0 , |E(2)
n  = |n − 1, 1 , ... , |E(gn) n  = |0, n ;

We define the projection operator over the subspace of states with total energy En as
Pˆn =

Since the total energy E1 = 2ω is measured, after the measurement the normalized state of the
system is given by

probability density that particles 1 and 2 are found at positions x1 and x2, respectively, is given by

1. Solve Heisenberg’s equations of motion for dxˆH(t)/dt and dpˆH(t)/dt, where ˆxH(t) and ˆpH(t) are the
position and momentum operators in the Heisenberg picture,
xˆH(t) = eiHtˆ / xˆ e−iHtˆ / ,
and similarly for ˆpH(t). Denote by ˆxH(0) = ˆx and ˆpH(0) = ˆp the operators at the initial time t = 0;
they coincide with the Schrodinger picture operators ˆ ¨ x and ˆp. It may be convenient first to solve
Heisenberg’s equations of motion for ˆaH(t) and ˆa†
H(t).

where in the last step we have replaced x by −x; so xˆ = −xˆ and so xˆ = 0. A similar argument
holds for pˆ, showing that pˆ = 0. It should be noted that this argument proving that the expectation
values of ˆx and ˆp vanish requires only that |ψ(0) has definite parity (either even or odd). Of course,
we obviously have ψH|xˆH(t)|ψH = ψH|pˆH(t)|ψH = 0.
Now, we further assume that the wave function ψ(x; 0) is real and show that the expectation value
of ˆx pˆ + pˆ xˆ vanishes in this case; indeed, consider

Problem 7 Two Uncoupled Harmonic Oscillators and the Exchange Operator
The Hamiltonian of a two-particle system of uncoupled harmonic oscillators is given by
Hˆ = Hˆ1 + Hˆ2 , Hˆi = pˆ
2
i
2m
+
mω2
2 xˆ
2
i ,
where ˆxi and ˆpi are the position and momentum operators for particle i. Let |n1, n2 = |n1⊗|n2 denote
the common eigenstates of Hˆ1 and Hˆ2, with eigenvalues ω(n1 +1/2) and ω(n2 +1/2), respectively.
1. Define the two-particle exchange operator as
Pˆ e |n1, n2 = |n2, n1 .
Show that Pˆ e is both hermitian and unitary, and that its eigenvalues are ±1. Further, show that
under the action of Pˆ e the observables Hˆ1, ˆx1, and ˆp1 transform as follows:
Pˆ e Hˆ1 Pˆ†
e = Hˆ2 , Pˆ e xˆ1 Pˆ†
e = xˆ2 , Pˆ e pˆ1 Pˆ†
e = pˆ2 ,
and vice versa.
2. Since Hˆ is invariant under the action of Pˆ e, show that there exists a basis of common eigenstates
of Hˆ and Pˆ e. Construct such a basis. Do Hˆ and Pˆ e form a complete set of commuting observables?
Solution
Part 1
Using the definition, it follows that, on the basis |n1, n2,
Pˆ 2
e |n1, n2 = Pˆ e |n2, n1 = |n1, n2 =⇒ Pˆ 2
e = 1ˆ ,
and therefore, multiplying both sides of the last relation by Pˆ−1
e , we arrive at
Pˆ e = Pˆ−1
e .
In fact the exchange operator is also hermitian, since

2 |Pˆ e |n1, n2 =⇒ Pˆ†
e = Pˆ e .
Since Pˆ e = Pˆ−1
e , we conclude that Pˆ e is also unitary: Pˆ†
e = Pˆ−1
e . Let |ψ be an eigenstate of Pˆ e with
eigenvalue λ, that is, Pˆ e |ψ = λ |ψ; then
|ψ = Pˆ 2
e |ψ = λ Pˆ e |ψ = λ2 |ψ =⇒ λ = ±1 .
On the basis |n1, n2, where it is understood that the first and second labels specify the states in the
state spaces of, respectively, oscillators 1 and 2, that is,
|n1, n2 = |n1⊗|n2 ,
we have

2 |Pˆ e Hˆ1 Pˆ†
e |n1, n2 ,
which implies
Pˆ e Hˆ1 Pˆ†
e = Hˆ2 .
To show that Pˆ e xˆ1 Pˆ†
e = xˆ2 and vice versa, we can proceed in a similar way to that above. However,
rather than using a basis of eigenstates of Hˆ1 and Hˆ2, it is convenient to use the basis |φx1,x2  of
continuum eigenstates of ˆx1 and ˆx2, namely
|φx1,x2  = |φx1 ⊗|φx2  , ˆxi |φx1,x2  = xi |φx1,x2  .
The proof is then identical to that above, the only difference being that the Kronecker δs are replaced
by δ-functions. In the case of the momentum observable, we use the basis |φp1,p2  of continuum
eigenstates of ˆp1 and ˆp2, obtaining Pˆ e pˆ1 Pˆ†
e = pˆ2 and vice versa.
Of course, we could also have shown this directly by noting that
φx1,x2 |n1, n2 = ψn1 (x1) ψn2 (x2) ,

The observable Hˆ = Hˆ1 + Hˆ2 is obviously invariant under the action of Pˆ e,
Pˆ e Hˆ Pˆ†
e = Hˆ =⇒ Pˆ e Hˆ = Hˆ Pˆ e ,

Problem 8 Momentum-Space Eigenfunctions of the Harmonic Oscillator
This problem deals with the harmonic oscillator in the momentum representation and, in particular,
with the relation between the coordinate- and momentum-representation eigenfunctions of its
Hamiltonian.
1. As a preliminary, consider the operator ˆy = α xˆ with α a real constant, that is, it provides a rescaling
of the position operator ˆx. Denote by |φx and |ϕy the bases consisting of eigenstates of ˆx and ˆy,
respectively, which satisfy the completeness relations
 ∞
−∞
dx |φxφx | = 1ˆ ,
 ∞
−∞
dy |ϕyϕy | = 1ˆ .
Clearly, we have
|ϕαx = c |φx or |φy/α = 1
c
|ϕy .
Exploiting the continuum normalization φx |φx = δ(x − x
), determine the constant |c|. Now,
consider the momentum operator ˆp and its rescaled version ˆq = β pˆ, with β a real constant, and
denote by |ψp and |χq the corresponding bases of eigenstates such that
|χβp = d|ψp or |ψq/β = 1
d |χq .
Determine |d|.
2. By appropriate rescaling of the Hamiltonians in the coordinate and momentum representations,
show that the Schrodinger equations satisfied by the coordinate- and momentum-space eigenfunc- ¨
tions can be written as
1

ξ
n (q) = (n + 1/2)ξ
n (q) ,
where
ξn (y) = ϕy |ξn , ξ
n (q) = χq |ξn ,
and |ξn are the harmonic oscillator eigenstates:
	
pˆ

2 xˆ
2


|ξn = (n + 1/2)ω |ξn .
3. Explain why the wave functions ξn (y) and ξ
n (q) can differ by at the most a phase factor, that is,
ξ
n (q) = eiηn ξn (y=q) .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press246 The Harmonic Oscillator
By expressing the relation a† |ξn = √
n + 1 |ξn+1 in the (rescaled) position and momentum
representations, show that the phase factors satisfy the requirement
eiηn+1 = −i eiηn =⇒ eiηn = (−i)
n eiη0 ,
where eiη0 is the phase factor for the ground state |ξ0. Using the relation a |ξ0 = 0, show that this
phase factor is in fact unity.
4. Show that the wave functions in the coordinate and momentum representations are related via
ξ
n (p) = (−i)n
√
mω
ξn[x=p/(mω)] .
Of course, we could have obtained the momentum-space wave function by evaluating the Fourier
transform
ξ
n (p) =
 ∞
−∞
dx e−ipx/
√
2π
ξn (x) ,
but the relation determined above avoids the carrying out of these Fourier transforms and shows
that, for example, the probability densities in coordinate and momentum space have the same
shape.
Solution
Part 1
We consider
φx |φx = δ(x − x
) = δ(y/α − y
/α) = |α| δ(y − y
) = |α| ϕy |ϕy ,
from which we deduce |c| = 1/√
|α|, that is,
|φy/α = 
|α| |ϕy and |ϕαx = 1
√
|α|
|φx .
Proceeding similarly in momentum space, we find
ψp |ψp = δ(p − p
) = δ(q/β − q
/β) = |β| δ(q − q
) = |β| χq |χq ,
and so
|d| = 1/
|β|, |ψq/β =

|β| |χq , and |χβp = 1


|ψp .

Part 2
Since the Hamiltonian is invariant under parity, the eigenstates are either even or odd under parity
(only bound states are possible for the present Hamiltonian). Note that this property of the eigenstates
is independent of the representation adopted; for example, using the coordinate representation, we
have for an even or odd wave function the general relation ψE(x) = ±ψE(−x), and

where in the next-to-last step we have replaced x by −x. The integral

vanishes for odd ψE(p). We conclude that the odd eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
are also eigenstates of the present Hamiltonian. This, of course, is immediately obvious in the
coordinate representation, since odd wave functions vanish at the origin and are unaffected by the
δ-function potential. Thus, in this case we have
E −→ ω(2 n − 1/2) , ψE(p) −→ ξ
2n−1 (p) ,
where n = 1, 2, ... and ξ
m(p) are the momentum-space harmonic oscillator wave functions
(discussed in Problem 8).

where n is a non-negative integer (the poles correspond to the singularities seen in the left-hand panel
of Fig. 8.1). For negative , the function g(), given by
g( ≤ 0) = Γ(1/4 + ||/2)
Γ(3/4 + ||/2) ,
is a monotonically decreasing function of || (see the right-hand panel of Fig. 8.1), which vanishes
as √
2/|| in the limit || −→ ∞.
For a repulsive δ-function potential (v0 > 0), the horizontal line − < 0 (shown as the lower
dashed line in the left-hand panel of Fig. 8.1) intersects g() at  values larger than those at which
the poles n = 1/2, 5/2, 9/2, ... occur, for any  or, equivalently, any v0 > 0. There is a one-to-one
correspondence between these energy eigenvalues and those of the simple harmonic oscillator for
even n.
For an attractive δ-function potential (v0 < 0), the cases  > 0 and  < 0 need to be considered
separately (bound states may also exist for  < 0). We define g(0) = −
0 , yielding

in the left-hand panel of Fig. 8.1 by the upper dashed line) intersects g() at  values smaller than
n = 1/2, 5/2, 9/2, ... . Again, there is a one-to-one correspondence between these energy eigenvalues
and those of the simple harmonic oscillator for even n. By contrast, if v0 < v
0 then there is
a single energy eigenvalue less than zero (the intersection of the dotted and solid lines in the
right-hand panel of Fig. 8.1), in addition to energy eigenvalues occurring at  values smaller than
n = 5/2, 9/2, 13/2, ... . Note that in this case 0 = 1/2, corresponding to the ground-state energy ω/2
of the simple harmonic oscillator, has migrated to negative energy.

be real.3

Deduce from this that

which implies that the eigenstates of ˆa are of the form |χα = Uˆ α |0 with α a complex number.
Here |0 is the ground state of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. Thus, ˆa has a continuous
spectrum. Are these eigenstates normalized to one? If they are, why is this surprising?
3. For two generic operators Aˆ and Bˆ, each of which commutes with the operator resulting from

3 Generally, only a normal operator Aˆ, which by definition commutes with its adjoint, that is, [Aˆ, Aˆ†] = 0, is guaranteed to be
diagonalizable. In particular, hermitian and unitary operators are examples of normal (and hence diagonalizable) operators.
An operator that is not normal may not be diagonalizable. As an example, consider an operator Aˆ that in a two-dimensional
state space is represented by a matrix,
A =

where α is a complex number. This matrix has a single (two-fold degenerate) eigenvalue equal to zero; however, two

Solution
Part 1
Define Bˆ = αaˆ
† − α∗aˆ, so that Uˆ α = eBˆ
. We then have
Bˆ† = (α aˆ
† − α∗
aˆ)
† = α∗
aˆ − α aˆ
† = −Bˆ =⇒ Uˆ†
α = e−Bˆ ,
and Uˆ†
α Uˆ α = e−Bˆ
eBˆ
= 1ˆ.
Part 2
We first evaluate the commutator
[Bˆ , ˆa] = α[ ˆa†
, ˆa] − α∗
[ ˆa, ˆa] = −α 1ˆ ,
and, since this commutator is proportional to the identity operator, it follows that higher-order nested
commutators all vanish,

  = ··· = 
Bˆ ,

Bˆ , ··· 

···   = ··· = 0 .
We conclude that (with λ = −1)
Uˆ†
α aˆUˆα = e−Bˆ
aˆ eBˆ = aˆ − [Bˆ , ˆa] = aˆ + α 1ˆ .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press255 8.3 Problems
On multiplying both sides on the left by Uˆ α and using the unitarity of Uˆ α we obtain that
Uˆ α Uˆ†
α aˆUˆ α = aˆUˆ α = Uˆ α (aˆ + α 1ˆ) = Uˆ α aˆ + α Uˆ α .
Let |χα be an eigenstate of ˆa with eigenvalue α (generally a complex number); then, Uˆ β |χα is an
eigenstate of ˆa with eigenvalue α + β since
aˆUˆ β |χα = (Uˆ β aˆ + β Uˆ β ) |χα = (α + β) Uˆ β |χα .
Thus we can generate all the eigenstates by starting with the state |χ0 corresponding to α = 0 and
applying Uˆ α to it, that is, |χα = Uˆ α |χ0, where α is any complex number. In particular, since |χ0 is
an eigenstate of ˆa with zero eigenvalue, we have
aˆ |χ0 = 0 =⇒ |χ0 = eiδ |0 ,
and so, up to an irrelevant phase factor (which we set to 1), the state |χ0 coincides with the
ground state of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, assumed to be normalized to 1. We see that
the eigenvalues of ˆa form a continuum (the complex numbers). The unitarity of Uˆ α ensures that
|χα = Uˆ α |0 is also normalized to 1. Here, then, is an example of an operator with a continuum
spectrum, which nevertheless has normalizable eigenstates (rather than eigenstates obeying a
continuum normalization condition).
Part 3
Define
Aˆ = α aˆ
† , Bˆ = −α∗ aˆ , [Aˆ , Bˆ] = −αα∗ [ ˆa† , ˆa] = |α|
2 1ˆ ,
yielding
Uˆα = eAˆ+Bˆ+[Aˆ , Bˆ]/2−[Aˆ , Bˆ]/2 = eAˆ+Bˆ+[Aˆ, Bˆ]/2 e−[Aˆ, Bˆ]/2 = e−|α|
2/2 eAˆ
eBˆ = e−|α|
2/2 eα aˆ
†
e−α∗ aˆ ,
where in the second step we have used the fact [Aˆ , Bˆ] is proportional to the identity and hence for
any operator Cˆ we have eCˆ+γ1ˆ = eγ1ˆ eCˆ = eCˆ
eγ1ˆ = eγ eCˆ (and the identity operator is understood).
Using ˆa |0 = 0, we see that
e−α∗aˆ |0 =
∞
n=0
(−α∗)n
n! aˆ
n |0 = |0 ,
since in the series only the term with n = 0 is left. We conclude that
|χα = Uˆ α |0 = e−|α|
2/2 eα aˆ

|0 .

We find that
χβ |χα = e−|α|

and the evaluation of the matrix element is straightforward if eβ∗ aˆ can be passed to the right of eα aˆ

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press256 The Harmonic Oscillator
This can be achieved by using the operator identity in part 3. Setting
Aˆ = β∗ aˆ , Bˆ = α aˆ
† ,
we have
eAˆ
eBˆ = eAˆ+Bˆ
e[Aˆ, Bˆ]/2 ,
where we used the fact that the commutator is proportional to the identity; indeed,
[Aˆ , Bˆ] = αβ∗ .
Under the exchange Aˆ  Bˆ the operator identity reads
eBˆ
eAˆ
= eBˆ+Aˆ+[Bˆ , Aˆ]/2 = eAˆ+Bˆ−[Aˆ , Bˆ]/2 =⇒ eBˆ
eAˆ
= eAˆ

e−[Aˆ, Bˆ]
or
eβ∗aˆ eα aˆ

and hence
χβ |χα = e−|α|

7. Knowing that, for a system held in equilibrium at temperature T, the probability that it will be in

Consider the thermodynamic limit (that is, the limit in which N, L −→ ∞ with the spacing a held
fixed), and show that in the low-temperature limit the heat capacity cV (that is, the derivative
of ET with respect to T) is linear in T. Does the high-temperature limit for cV conform to
expectations?
Solution
Part 1
The equilibrium positions are x0
l = l a and the displacements from these equilibrium positions are
ηl = xl − x0
l . The kinetic energy of the system is given by
T = m
2

N
l=1

l ,
since ˙xl = η˙l, while the potential energy follows as

2 + ··· +
k
2 (xN−1 − xN − a)
2 +
k
2 (x0
N+1 − xN − a)

and a is the length of the unstretched spring. In terms of the displacements, V reads
V = k

which can also be written as
V = k

Combining these results, we arrive at

As an aside, we note that the above set of differential equations also describes the transverse
(as opposed to longitudinal) oscillations of N identical masses, equally spaced, on a stretched
massless string. Let T be the uniform tension in the string; then, we have
mη¨k = T sin θ − T sin φ ≈ T(θ − φ) ,
where ηk now denotes the transverse displacement of the mass located at x0
k , sin θ ≈ θ ≈ (ηk−1−ηk)/a,
and sin φ ≈ φ ≈ (ηk − ηk+1)/a. We find that
η¨k (t) = − T
ma

2ηk (t) − ηk−1 (t) − ηk+1 (t)
 .
It is easier to visualize the transverse oscillations of the string than the longitudinal oscillations of
the spring-connected masses.
Part 2
We substitute the ansatz
ηk (t) = Re 
A ei(qx0
k−ωt)

,
where the wave number q and angular frequency ω are as yet unknown and x0
k = ka, into the equations
of motion, to obtain

2 − eiq(x0

,
and the real part can be taken at the end (the differential equations are linear). Therefore, we have the
dispersion relation
ω2 = ω2
0

2 − e−iqa − eiqa
= 4ω2
0 sin2 (qa/2) .
In order to determine q, we impose the boundary conditions η0 (t) =0= ηN+1 (t). To this end first note
that, since the dispersion relation is even under q, the solution consists of a superposition of traveling
waves:
ηk (t) = 
A+ eiqx0
k + A− e−iqx0
k

e−iωt ,
and hence
η0 (t) = 0 =⇒ (A+ + A−) e−iωt = 0 =⇒ A− = −A+
and
ηN+1 (t) = 0 =⇒ 
A+ eiq(N+1)a + A− e−iq(N+1)a

e−iωt = 0 =⇒ sin[qa(N + 1)] = 0 ,
this last relation yielding the allowed values qn,

where the generally complex constants Cn = |Cn | eiϕn are determined by the 2N initial conditions on
ηk (0) and η˙k (0). After the redefinition of the constants 2|Cn | −→ An and ϕn + π/2 −→ −ϕn, the

as such it can be diagonalized. Indeed, the eigenvalues are mω2

Angular Momentum
In the present and next chapters, we consider the important problem of a particle under the action of
a potential which depends only on the distance from a center of force (a so-called central potential).
Physically relevant examples are an electron in the Coulomb field of the proton (the hydrogen
atom) and the classic problem of a particle in a three-dimensional harmonic potential. Unless stated
otherwise, hereafter we adopt the coordinate representation. The state is represented by the wave
function Ψ(r, t) = φr |Ψ(t), and
Ψ(r, t) = e−iE(t−t0)/ ψ(r) ,

where μ denotes the particle’s mass and the potential V(r) depends only on the magnitude |r| ≡ r.
The problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian H(r, p) with
p = −i∇.
9.1 Orbital Angular Momentum
In classical mechanics, the solution of the equations of motion for a particle in a central potential is
greatly facilitated by introducing the angular momentum L= r × p (relative to the center of force),
a constant of motion. As a consequence, it can be seen that the motion of the particle occurs in a
plane perpendicular to L and that its position vector sweeps equal areas in equal times. It is therefore
natural to introduce the angular momentum in quantum mechanics as the operator
Lˆ = rˆ × pˆ ; (9.2)
in the coordinate representation L= −i r × ∇. Its components can be conveniently expressed as
Li = −i

jk
ijkrj∂k , ∂k ≡ ∂
∂rk
, (9.3)
where ijk is the Levi–Civita tensor, with the property that
ijk =
+1 if ijk = 123 or 231 or 312
−1 if ijk = 132 or 213 or 321
0 otherwise .
(9.4)
Thus ijk is a totally antisymmetric tensor that is equal to +1 for a cyclic permutation of 123, to −1 for
an anticyclic permutation of 123, and to zero if any two or more indices are the same; it changes sign

tensors is useful in applications,1

as a consequence of the transformation properties of vector operators under rotations. We will return
to this topic when we discuss symmetry transformations (translations, rotations, etc.) in quantum

commutation relations (see Problem 1 for an explicit derivation)

different components of the angular momentum do not commute with each other and, therefore,
cannot be measured simultaneously.
The commutation relations of L and V also imply that

Li , V2 
= 0 , (9.10)
that is, L commutes with the scalar operator V2; in particular, it commute with p2 and r =
√
r2, and
hence with the Hamiltonian of a particle in a central potential. The Hamiltonian, L2, and one of
the components of L, which conventionally is taken as the z-component, form a set of commuting
observables. As a consequence, there exists a basis of simultaneous eigenfunctions of H, L2, and Lz.
In order to fully exploit the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian of a particle in a central
potential (that is, the fact that H commutes with L), first we note that

1 We write (note the positions of the subscripts): 
l ijl mnl = ij1 mn1 + ij2 mn2 + ij3 mn3; the first term requires ij and
mn to be equal to 23 or 32 (namely, the four possibilities ij = 23 and mn = 23 or 32, or ij = 32 and mn = 23 or 32), the second
term requires ij and mn to be equal to 13 or 31, and the last term requires ij and mn to be equal to 12 or 21. Thus, for any of
the allowed possibilities, only one of these three terms survives. Consider the first term, ij1 mn1: for ij = mn = 23 or 32 the
product 231 231 = 321 321 = 1, since 231 = 1 and 321 = –1; on the other hand, ij = 23 and mn = 32, or ij = 32 and mn =
23, the product 231 321 = −1. We can summarize these results in the following way:

l
ijl mnl = δim δjn − δin δjm .

where it is important to stress that the partial derivatives act on everything to their right. Next, we
consider the two terms A and B separately:

L2 = −2 
r
2 ∇2 − (r · ∇)



which can be further simplified by expressing r · ∇ in spherical coordinates as r∂/∂r. Therefore, we
obtain
L2 = r

In solving for p2, we have multiplied both sides on the left by 1/r2, the inverse operator of r2.
This operator does not commute with ∂rr2 ∂r, and so the relative ordering of 1/r2 and ∂rr2∂r is
important (1/r2 is on the left, as it must); on the other hand, L2 and 1/r2 do commute, and their
relative ordering is irrelevant.

ψ(r, θ, φ) = Eψ(r, θ, φ) , (9.18)
which makes it obvious that the Hamiltonian and L2 commute (the square of the angular momentum
operator acts only on the polar angle θ and azimuthal angle φ, see Problem 2). The next task is to
determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of L2 and Lz. We will see in a later section how this
can be done on general grounds by using only the commutation relations satisfied by the Li.
2 The term ∂krj can be written as δjk + rj∂k, since for any f (r) we have ∂k[rj f (r)] = δjk f (r) + rj∂k f (r); this also yields
rj∂k = ∂krj − δjk.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.010 Published online by Cambridge University Press273 9.2 The Spectrum ofL2 and Lz
We assume that the wave function ψ(r) is a smooth (continuous) function of r, in particular near
the origin; such an assumption is justified if the potential V(r) is not too singular at r = 0 (see below).
Under this assumption, ψ(r) can be expanded in a Taylor series around r = 0,
ψ(r) = ψ(0) +

i

r=0 +
1

r=0 +
1
3!

ijk
rirjrk∂i∂j∂kψ(r)
r=0 + ··· . (9.19)
It may happen, for a given wave function, that some terms in this expansion vanish. Suppose that
the non-vanishing term with the smallest number of ri factors has l ≥ 0 such factors; for example,
if ψ(0)  0 then l = 0; if ψ(0) = 0 and ∂iψ(r)|r=0 = 0 and some of the second partial derivatives are
non-vanishing then l = 2. Thus, generally we have that
ψ(r) = Pl(rx,ry,rz) + Pl+1 (rx,ry,rz) + ··· , (9.20)
where Pn (rx,ry,rz) with n = l, l + 1, ... , ∞ is a homogenous polynomial of order n: it consists of a
sum of terms, each of which contains n factors of the ri; for example, P2 (rx,ry,rz) = ar2
x + bryrz with
a, b constants. When expressed in spherical coordinates, we see that
ψ(r, θ, φ) = r
l
Pl(θ, φ) + r
l+1
Pl+1 (θ, φ) + ··· , (9.21)
since each of the ri is proportional to r. The Schrodinger equation implies that ¨
L2 ψ(r, θ, φ) = 2 ∂
∂r
r
2 ∂
∂r ψ(r, θ, φ) + 2μr
2[E − V(r)]ψ(r, θ, φ) . (9.22)
In the limit r −→ 0, the dominant term in ψ(r, θ, φ) is rl
Pl(θ, φ). Assuming that r2V(r) −→ 0 in
this limit (this requirement is satisfied by the Coulomb potential in the physically relevant case of the
hydrogen atom), we conclude that
L2 ψ(r, θ, φ) = 2 ∂

l(l+1)rl
Pl(θ, φ) = 2
l(l + 1)ψ(r, θ, φ) . (9.23)
Even though the above result has been derived in the limit r −→ 0, it must hold for any r; since L2
acts only on θ and φ, the eigenfunctions of L2 must be proportional to functions of these angles –
we denote them generically as Y(θ, φ). The coefficient of proportionality can be a function of r, and
hence
ψ(r, θ, φ) = R(r) Y(θ, φ) , L2 Y(θ, φ) = 2
l(l + 1)Y(θ, φ) . (9.24)
We also require that ψ(r, θ, φ) be an eigenfunction of Lz,
Lzψ(r, θ, φ) = mψ(r, θ, φ) , (9.25)
where we take m to be a real number (Lz is a hermitian operator, and its eigenvalues are real), and the
factor  is included for convenience. Since Lz, given by
Lz = −i ∂
∂φ , (9.26)
acts only on the φ dependence, we must have
LzY(θ, φ) = mY(θ, φ) ; (9.27)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.010 Published online by Cambridge University Press274 Particle in a Central Potential; Orbital Angular Momentum
expressing Y(θ, φ) = P(θ) Φ(φ) as a product (using the separability of the variables) of a function
of θ times a function of φ, we arrive at
− i
∂
∂φ Φ(φ) = mΦ(φ) , Φ(φ + 2π) = Φ(φ) , (9.28)
where the boundary condition ensures that the Φ(φ), and hence Y(θ, φ), assume the same value as
φ −→ φ + 2π. The solution is given by Φ(φ) ∝ eimφ with m = 0, ±1, ±2, ... . At this stage, there is
no upper limit on |m|. In fact, it will turn out that |m| ≤ l. How this comes about will become clear
when we construct the spherical harmonics in the next subsection.
Inserting Eq. (9.24) into the Schrodinger equation, we obtain ¨

where in the limit r −→ 0 the radial function R(r) ∝ rl (of course, we are assuming here that
r2V(r) −→ 0 in this limit). In addition, for bound-state solutions the wave functions must be
normalizable:

dr r2 |R(r)|

and so the integral over θ and φ and the integral over r must each be convergent. The differential
equation (9.29) can be cast into a one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for a particle of mass ¨ μ
under the influence of an effective potential V(r) + l(l + 1)2/(2μr2) by introducing an auxiliary
function u(r):
R(r) = u(r)

Here, we construct the eigenfunctions of L2 and Lz, known as spherical harmonics. We have
already determined their eigenvalues, respectively l(l + 1)2 and m with l = 0, 1, 2, ... and
m = 0, ±1, ±2, ... , albeit with no restriction on |m| as of yet. We write the eigenvalue equation
for the square of the orbital angular momentum as (see Problem 2 for a derivation of L2 in spherical
coordinates)

and m, where l = 0, 1, 2, ... and m = −l, ... , l (and hence, for fixed l, there are 2 l + 1 allowed

Problem 2 Explicit Expressions forLi andL2 in Spherical Coordinates
Obtain explicit expressions for the components of L and of L2 in spherical coordinates.
Solution
Spherical coordinates are related to cartesian coordinates via
x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ , z = r cos θ ,
where the angles θ and φ vary in the ranges 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π. These relations can be
inverted to give
r =

the matrix, having determinant (r2 sin θ)−1, is well defined, if r > 0 and θ  0 or π (it can be
inverted so as to express the partial derivatives with respect to spherical coordinates in terms of those
with respect to cartesian coordinates). For θ = 0 and π, regardless of φ, the vector r lies along the
z-axis. Thus, we obtain

As expected, since L commutes with r the components Li act only on the angular dependence; in

The “harmonic” functions Ylm(r, Ω) are homogeneous polynomials of order l in r± and r0, where

Knowing these facts, obtain the spherical harmonics Y33, Y32, Y31, and Y30 up to normalization factors.

Problem 6 Measurements ofL2 and Lz: An Example
The state of a certain particle is represented by the wave function
ψ(x, y,z) = N(x + y + z) e−r2/α2
,
where α is real and N is a normalization constant. The observables L2 and Lz are measured; what are
the probabilities of obtaining, respectively, 22 and 0? (Adapted from J. J. Sakurai and J. Napolitano

Solution
In spherical coordinates the wave function reads
ψ(r, Ω) = Ne−r2/α2
r(sin θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ + cos θ) .

Given this wave function, we are asked to calculate the probability of measuring specific values
of l and m. In order to answer this question, we introduce the basis consisting of eigenstates of
the complete set of commuting observables ˆr (the magnitude of the position operator), Lˆ 2, and Lˆz.
We denote these eigenstates as |ϕrlm and we have
rˆ |ϕrlm = r|ϕrlm , Lˆ 2 |ϕrlm = l(l + 1)2 |ϕrlm , Lˆz |ϕrlm = m |ϕrlm .
We have reinstated the hat on top of the symbols representing operators for clarity. The basis of
eigenstates |ϕrlm is continuous. We choose to normalize these states as follows:
ϕrlm|ϕrl
m = δ(r − r
)
r2 δl,l
 δm,m ,
so that the completeness relation is given by

l=0

dr r2 |ϕrlmϕrlm| = 1ˆ .
The wave function (in spherical coordinates) corresponding to |ϕrlm reads

Given the (normalized) state |ψ above, the probability of measuring l and m values regardless of the
r position of the particle is obtained from
Plm =

It is convenient to evaluate the matrix element in the (spherical) coordinate representation:

Problem 7 Measurement ofL2
: An Example
A particle of mass μ is under the influence of a central potential V(r). Its wave function is given by
ψ(r) = (x + y + 3z) f (r) .
1. Is ψ(r) an eigenfunction of L2 ? If so, what is the l-value? If not, what are the possible values of l
we may obtain if L2 is measured?
2. What are the probabilities for the particle to be found in the various m states?
3. Suppose it is known that ψ(r) is an energy eigenfunction with eigenvalue E. Indicate how we may
determine the potential V(r).

Solution
Part 1
In spherical coordinates the wave function reads
ψ(r, Ω) = rf (r)(sin θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ + 3 cos θ) .
The dependence on θ and φ can be expressed as a linear combination of spherical harmonics Y1,m(Ω)
by noting that
Y1,±1 (Ω) = ∓

Since ψ(r, Ω) consists of a linear combination of spherical harmonics of order l = 1, it must be an
eigenfunction of L2 with eigenvalue 22. A measurement of L2 would yield this value with certainty.

Part 2
As in Problem 6, we denote by |ϕrlm the eigenstates of the complete set of commuting observables
rˆ (the magnitude of the position operator), Lˆ 2, and Lˆz,
rˆ |ϕrlm = r|ϕrlm , Lˆ 2 |ϕrlm = l(l + 1)2 |ϕrlm , Lˆz |ϕrlm = m |ϕrlm .
Given a normalized state |ψ, the probability of measuring particular l and m values regardless of the
r position of the particle is obtained from
plm =

Therefore, the probability of measuring m = ±1 is 1/11, and the probability of measuring m = 0 is 9/11.

Problem 8 Ehrenfest’s Relations forL(t)
Consider a particle in three dimensions with Hamiltonian given by
Hˆ = pˆ 2

Show that the time derivative of the expectation value of the orbital angular momentum operator
Lˆ = rˆ × pˆ is given by
d

Does this equation have a classical counterpart?

momentum Lˆ – is given by

Term 1 is immediately seen to vanish (pˆ 2 is a scalar operator, and as such it commutes with the
angular momentum; see Problem 1). For term 2, consider the x-component,

Vˆ , Lˆ x

and similarly for the other components (here, ∂Vˆ/∂z is to be understood as the operator obtained by
replacing the vector r by the vector operator rˆ) in the function ∂V(r)/∂z; hence, we have

Vˆ(rˆ) , Lˆ  = i rˆ × ∇Vˆ(rˆ) ,
yielding the required result,
d
dt ψ(t)|Lˆ |ψ(t) = −ψ(t)|rˆ × ∇Vˆ(rˆ)|ψ(t) .
This is the quantum mechanical counterpart to the equation of classical mechanics L˙ = τ, where τ
is the torque, defined as τ = r × F = −r × ∇V.
Problem 9 Some Identities Involving r, p, andL
Show that the following properties relating to the orbital angular momentum operator L= r × p are
satisfied:
1. r · L and L · r, and similarly p · L and L · p, are null operators;
2. L2 = −r · [ p (p · r) − p2 r ] (consider the order of the operators); next show that
[ r , p2 ] = 2i p , r · p − p · r = 3i ,
and hence obtain
L2 = r
2 p2 + i r · p − (r · p)
2
;
3. By direct calculation show that in spherical coordinates
r · p = −ir ∂
∂ r ,
and using the result in part 2 obtain
L2 = r
2 p2 + 2 ∂

where in the third step we have used the fact that, owing to ijk, the subscripts must satisfy j  k and
hence the operators rj and pk commute. A similar argument shows that p · L and L · p vanish, since
the operator p × p is the null operator.

+ r cos θ [cos θ ∂r − (sin θ/r) ∂θ] = r ∂r ,
which could have been guessed given that r · p, as a scalar operator, commutes with L; since the
components Li depend on θ and φ, and derivatives with respect to these variables, it follows that r ·p
cannot have any dependence on θ, ∂θ or φ, ∂φ if it has to commute with each Li. We arrive at

Problem 10 More Identities InvolvingLˆ for a System of N Particles

1. Show that the components of Lˆ satisfy the commutation relations that define the angular
momentum operator. Deduce from this that if v and v are two generic vectors (not vector
operators) then

Lˆ · v , Lˆ · v


2. Evaluate the commutators of the components of Lˆ with those of rˆi and pˆi and obtain the following
three identities:

As we have seen, the wave functions in a central potential can be written as
ψElm(r, Ω) = uEl(r)
r Ylm(Ω) , (10.1)
and are eigenfunctions of H, L2, and Lz with eigenvalues E, l(l + 1)2, and m, respectively. The
reduced radial wave functions uEl(r) in the region 0 < r < ∞ satisfy (for each l) the one-dimensional
Schrodinger equation ¨

uEl(r) = EuEl(r) . (10.2)
The boundary conditions are uEl(r) ∝ rl+1 as r −→ 0 and uEl(r) −→ 0 as r −→ ∞ for bound states
(scattering, or continuum, states require only that uEl(r) is bounded in 0 < r < ∞; we will return to
these later). Note that the subscript E specifying the energy eigenvalue is not explicitly included in
most of the formulae below.
10.1 Hydrogen-Like Atoms
We consider an electron of charge −e (e > 0) in the attractive Coulomb field of a nucleus of charge
Ze (for the hydrogen atom Z = 1), fixed at the origin. The Schrodinger equation for the reduced radial ¨
wave function ul(r) reads

ul(r) = 0 ,  = 2μ E

which corresponds to a one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for an electron constrained in the ¨
region in 0 ≤ r < ∞ and under the action of an effective potential given by
veff(r) = −2μ
2
Ze2
r +
l(l + 1)
r2 . (10.4)
This effective potential is repulsive at short distances because of the centrifugal barrier (for l ≥ 1), and
is attractive at large distances because of the Coulomb potential. For l ≥ 1, veff(r) has a minimum at
rmin = l(l + 1) 2
Ze2 μ , veff(rmin) = − (Ze2μ)2
l(l + 1)4 . (10.5)
Therefore, if bound states occur (as they do) for l ≥ 1 then the corresponding energies must be in the
range veff(rmin) ≤  < 0. For the S-wave (l = 0), the only requirement is  < 0.

Next, we remove the known short- and long-range behavior of ul(x) by introducing a function Fl(x)
such that
ul(x) = xl+1 e−
√
x Fl(x) , (10.10)

l(z) + (ξ − l − 1) Fl(z) = 0 , ξ = 1

and, in order for Fl(z) to be an acceptable solution, we must have (see Problem 2)
l + 1 − ξ = −ν =⇒  = 1
(ν + l + 1)2 , ν = 0, 1, 2, ... , (10.13)
which then implies that Fl(z) is a polynomial in z. We define n = ν+l+1, and express the bound-state
energies (recall that  = −E/E0 with E < 0) as

non-degenerate (of course, we are ignoring here the fact that the electron and nucleus have intrinsic
angular momenta, i.e., spin angular momenta; we will come back to this later). Collecting results,
and keeping track of the various definitions, the corresponding wave functions can be written as

It can be seen that, the wave function decreases at large ρn as ρl
n ρn−l−1 n e−ρn/2, or, in terms of r,
ψ(r, Ω) ∼ r
n−1 e−(Z/n)r/a0 , (10.22)
and the electron is localized within a region of radius na0/Z. The results we have derived here are or
a single-electron atom in the Coulomb field of a nucleus of charge Ze, and so they are valid for the
hydrogen atom, the singly ionized helium atom (which has Z = 2), or the doubly ionized lithium atom
(Z = 3), and so forth. We have already noted that the degeneracy of the energy levels is gn = n2.
This is due to the 1/r behavior of the Coulomb potential,1 and the accidental extra degeneracy
on l (beyond the 2 l + 1 degeneracy from rotational symmetry) originates from an additional
symmetry of the hydrogen-like Hamiltonian (see Problem 14 in Chapter 11). In multielectron atoms
the energies depend on both n and l, since in that case the electrostatic potential ceases to be strictly
proportional to 1/r.
According to the standard notation, the states with l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are labeled as s, p, d, f, g, . . . ,
(the letters stand for “sharp”, “principal”, “diffuse”, and so on, for reasons which have to do with the
appearance of the spectral lines). Hydrogen-like atom states are often labeled as 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p,
3d, and so forth, where 1, 2, 3, . . . specify the “principal” quantum number n.
10.2 Harmonic Oscillator in Three Dimensions
We consider a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential of natural angular frequency ω,
V(r) = μ ω2

1 It turns out that the harmonic oscillator potential too shares this feature, in that an accidental extra degeneracy on l appears,
as we will see.

Only bound states are possible, as it will be apparent below from the asymptotic behavior of ul(r).
It is convenient to define the variable r0 =

adimensional variable x = r/r0, in terms of which the above equation is written as

In the limit x −→ ∞, Eq. (10.25) reduces to
u
l (x) − x2
ul(x) = 0 =⇒ ul(x) ∝ e−x2/2 , (10.27)
since 
e−x2/2 = (x2 − 1) e−x2/2 ≈ x2 e−x2/2. We see that all solutions vanish in the asymptotic
region and, as a consequence, no continuum solutions can exist in a harmonic oscillator potential.
We remove the short- and long-range behavior of ul(x) by introducing the auxiliary function gl(x),
ul(x) = xl+1 e−x2/2 gl(x) , (10.28)
so that

l(x) + ξxgl(x) = 0 , ξ =  − 2l − 3 . (10.29)
It can be shown (see Problem 3) that, in order for ul(x) not to be exponentially increasing in the limit
x −→ ∞, we must have ξ equal to 2p with p an even integer,
ξ = 2p =⇒  = 2p + 2l + 3 and p = 0, 2, 4, ... , (10.30)
which in turn implies that gl(x) is a polynomial in x. We then obtain the well-known eigenvalues,
En = ω(n + 3/2) , n = 0, 1, 2, ... , (10.31)
where n = p + l with l = 0, 1, 2, ... . The energy level with n = 0 is non-degenerate, since p and l
must be both zero; however, the first excited level has n = 1, which necessarily implies p = 0 and l = 1,
and is three-fold degenerate; the second excited level has n = 2, which is satisfied by either p = 0 and
l = 2 or p = 2 and l =0 (p must be an even integer) and is therefore six-fold degenerate, and so on.
The degeneracy for a given n is
gn = (n + 1)(n + 2)

10.3 The Two-Body Problem
In this section we consider the quantum mechanical treatment of two particles. In classical mechanics
the two-body problem with a potential that depends only on the relative positions of the two particles
is equivalent to a one-body problem. This equivalence also holds in quantum mechanics. Let r1 and
p1 = −i∇1, and r2 and p2 = −i∇2, be the position and momentum operators for particles 1 and 2 of
masses m1 and m2. They satisfy the commutation relations

riα , rjβ
 = 0 = 
piα , pjβ

, 
riα , pjβ
 = i δijδαβ , (10.34)
and note that the position and momentum operators of different particles (i  j) commute. We now
proceed as in classical mechanics and introduce the center-of-mass and relative position operators,
respectively, R and r,
R = m1 r1 + m2 r2
m1 + m2
, r = r1 − r2 , (10.35)
and the conjugate momentum operators,
P = p1 + p2 , p = m2 p1 − m1 p2
m1 + m2
. (10.36)
We define the total mass M and reduced mass μ as
M = m1 + m2 , μ = m1m2
m1 + m2
. (10.37)
The above relations are easily inverted to yield
r1 = R + μ

r2 = R − μ
m2

The center-of-mass and relative variables satisfy canonical commutation relations, that is,

Rα , Pβ
 = iδαβ , 
rα , pβ
 = iδαβ , (10.40)

 Hrel
; (10.42)
thus it separates into a center-of-mass and relative Hamiltonian. The center-of-mass Hamiltonian
is that of a free particle of mass M, and its eigenstates are those of the center-of-mass momentum
operator, Pˆ |φP = P |φP, that is,
Hcm|φP = P2
2M |φP . (10.43)

The relative Hamiltonian is that of a particle of mass μ under the influence of a potential V(r) (we are
assuming that V(r) vanishes as |r| −→ ∞ but not that it is a central potential). This Hamiltonian might
have discrete eigenvalues Ei < 0 with eigenstates |ψ(k)
i ,
Hrel |ψ(k)
i  = Ei |ψ(k)
i  , k = 1, ... , gi , ψ(k)
i |ψ(l)
j  = δij δkl ; (10.44)
it will generally have continuous eigenvalues E ≥ 0 with corresponding eigenstates |ψ(k)

E  = E |ψ(k)
E  , k = 1, ... , gE , ψ(k)
E |ψ(l)
E  = δ(E − E
) δkl . (10.45)
The introduction of center-of-mass and relative variables has allowed us to reduce the two-body
problem to two independent one-body problems, a significant simplification. The eigenstates of the
complete Hamiltonian H = Hcm + Hrel are simply given by the tensor product of eigenstates of Hcm
and Hrel,
|φP; ψ(k)
i ≡|φP⊗|ψ(k)
i  , (10.46)
with corresponding wave functions
φR,r |φP; ψ(k)
i  = eiP·R/
(2π)3/2 ψ(k)
i (r) , (10.47)
and similarly for the continuous eigenstates of Hrel . We then have
H |φP; ψ(k)

Φ(φ) ∝ eimφ , m = 0, ±1, ±2, ... ,
and there is no upper bound on |m| as of yet.

Solution
In the limit x −→ ∞, Eq. (10.7) reduces to
d2ul(x)
dx2 − ul(x) = 0 =⇒ ul(x) ∝ e−
√
x .
This asymptotic behavior can be removed by introducing the auxiliary function fl(x) via
ul(x) = e−
√


fl(x) = 0 .
We remove the effect of the centrifugal barrier on the short-range behavior by defining
fl(x) = xl+1Fl(x); we find
f 
l (x) = (l + 1)xl
Fl(x) + xl+1

l (x) = l(l + 1)xl−1
Fl(x) + 2 (l + 1)xl
F

F
l (x) .
After dividing by xl

As a last step, we rescale x by defining

to arrive at (on dividing by 2 √

zF
l (z) + (2l + 2 − z) F
l(z) + (ξ − l − 1)Fl(z) = 0 , ξ = 1

which can be rewritten as
zF
l (z) + (b − z) F
l(z) − aFl(z) = 0 , a = l + 1 − ξ , b = 2 l + 2 .
We look for a power series solution,

Substituting this expansion into the equation above and lumping together terms with the same power

q z

For the power series to be a solution, each coefficient of zp must vanish:
z

0 = 0 =⇒ s(s + b − 1) = 0 ,
z

: [s(s + 1) + b(s + 1)] c(l)
1 = (s + a)c(l)
0 =⇒ c(l)
1 = s + a
(s + 1)(s + b)
c(l)

and so on. For the generic term proportional to zq, we find
z

: [(s + q)(s + q + 1) + b(s + q + 1)] c(l)
q+1 = (s + q + a)c(l)
q ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press301 10.4 Problems

with s determined from
s(s + b − 1) = 0 =⇒ s = 0 or s = 1 − b.
The solution corresponding to s = 1−b = −2l−1 is the irregular function Gl(z), which is unacceptable,
since it behaves in the limit z −→ 0 as Gl(z) ∝ z−2l−1, and would lead to ul(r) ∝ r−l with incorrect
behavior for small r. Thus the only acceptable solution has s = 0, which gives

where c(l)

The recurrence relation yields c(l)
q+1 = γq γq−1 ··· γ0 c(l)
0 and the solution has the form
Fl(z) = c(l)

This is known as the confluent hypergeometric series. The series must terminate, that is, Fl(z) must be
a polynomial, because otherwise it would lead to a solution ul(r) which would diverge exponentially
at large r and therefore could not describe a bound state. This can be seen by noting that for q

ratio c(l)

q behaves as 1/q. The series can be written, up to the overall normalization factor c(l)

we find that ul(x) for large x (or, equivalently, for large r as x = r/r0) behaves as e√
 x and is not
normalizable. Thus the series must terminate, and Fl(z) must be a polynomial. This can only happen

Problem 3 The Radial Equation for the Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator

g
l(x) + ξxgl(x) = 0 , ξ =  − 2 l − 3 ,
and show that bound-state solutions result from the conditions ξ = 2p or  = 2p + 2l + 3, where p
is a non-negative even integer. Define n = p + l and show that the degeneracy of energy level n is
gn =(n + 1)(n + 2)/2.
Solution
We posit
gl(x) = xs
∞
q=0
c(l)
q xq , c(l)
0  0 .
Inserting the above expansion into the radial equation and lumping together terms with the same
power of x, we obtain

q xq−1 =

q=0
[2(s + q) − ξ] c(l)

For the power series to be a solution, each coefficient of xp must vanish. Consider first the terms
proportional to x−1 and x0,
x−1
: [s(s − 1) + 2(l + 1)s] c(l)
0 = 0 =⇒ s = 0, −(2l + 1) (for c(l)
0  0) ,
x0
: [s(s + 1) + 2(l + 1)(s + 1)]  0 for s=0 or s=−(2l+1)
c(l)
1 = 0 =⇒ c(l)
1 = 0 ,
where in the last relation c(l)
1 must vanish, since the prefactor [··· ] is  0 when s = 0 or s =−(2 l + 1).
For a general term proportional to xp+1 with p ≥ 0, we find
xp+1
: [(s + p + 2)(s + p + 1) + 2(l + 1)(s + p + 2)] c(l)
p+2 = [2(s + p) − ξ] c(l)
p ,
which implies the following recurrence relation:
c(l)
p+2 = 2(s + p) − ξ
(s + p + 2)(s + p + 1) + 2(l + 1)(s + p + 2)
c(l)
p with p = 0, 1, ... .
Because of the condition c(l)
1 = 0, it immediately follows that c(l)
p = 0 for p odd. Furthermore, only the
solution corresponding to s = 0 is acceptable, since that corresponding to s =−(2l + 1) is too singular
at the origin as it would lead to ul(r) ∝ r−l
. Thus, the series solution is of the form
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press303 10.4 Problems
gl(x) =

c(l)
p xp , c(l)
p+2 = 2p − ξ
(p + 2)(p + 2 l + 3)
c(l)
p , c(l)
1 = 0 .
An analysis similar to that carried out for the equation relative to the hydrogen atom in Problem 2
shows that, for the solution to be normalizable (that is, vanishing at x±∞), the series must terminate,
namely gl(x) must be a polynomial. This can only happen if ξ = 2p with p even, yielding  = 2p+2l+3
or, in physical units,
En = ω(n + 3/2) , n = p + l with p = 0, 2, 4, ... and l = 0, 1, 2, ...
In order to calculate the degeneracy we observe that, for n even, l must be even and hence (setting
l = 2k)
n
l even=0
(2l + 1) =
n/2
k=0
(4k + 1) = 4
(n/2 + 1)n/2

2 ,
and, for n odd, l must be odd (l = 2k + 1), so that
n

(2l + 1) =
(n

k=0
(4k + 3) = 4 [(n − 1)/2 + 1](n − 1)/2

as expected.

Obtain the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions, and determine the degeneracy of the

where ψn (x) is the single-harmonic-oscillator wave function defined in Eq. (8.26) (with m replaced

Ei = ω(n1 + n2 + n3  n

In order to determine the degeneracy gn, we need to calculate the number of ways in which three
non-negative integers n1, n2, and n3 can add up to a given integer n. This number is
gn =
n
n1=0

2 − n(n + 1)/2 = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 .
The above procedure is obviously generalizable to the case of the isotropic harmonic oscillator
in d dimensions. Eigenstates consists of tensor products |n1⊗|n2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ |nd with eigenvalues
En = ω(n + d/2), where n = n1 + ··· + nd. The degeneracy of these eigenvalues is given by (see
Problem 4 in Chapter 8)
gn = (n + d − 1)!
n! (d − 1)! .
Problem 5 Differences in the Energy Spectra of Hydrogen and Deuterium
In nature there are two stable isotopes of the hydrogen nucleus: the proton with mass mp ≈ 1836 me
and the deuteron (a bound state of a proton and a neutron) with mass md ≈ 3670 me. How does this
difference in mass impact the energy spectra of the hydrogen and deuterium atoms?
Solution
The eigenvalues of the relative Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom are given by
En (hydrogen) = − α2
2n2 μepc2 ,
where α is the fine structure constant and μep is the reduced electron–proton mass,
μep = me mp
me + mp
≈ me
	
1 − me
mp


≈ 0.99945 me .
In the case of deuterium, the only change in the expression for the eigenvalues is the replacement
of μep by μed, the reduced mass of the electron–deuteron system; μed ≈ 0.99973 me. This difference
leads to an overall tiny shift proportional to μed − μep in the frequencies of the light emitted in
transitions between energy levels in hydrogen and in deuterium, and consequently a tiny shift in the
positions of the corresponding spectral lines. This shift can be detected. From the intensity of the
spectral lines astronomers are able to infer the relative abundance of hydrogen and deuterium in the
interstellar medium, which in turn reveals conditions in the early universe, when a small fraction of
matter consisted of deuterons.

and the boundary conditions for ρ −→ ∞ will depend on the problem of interest (for example, in
the case of a bound-state solution we must have f ,n (ρ −→ ∞) = 0). The boundary condition at the

Problem 7 S-Wave Bound States in a Spherical Potential Well
Consider a particle in a spherical potential well defined as
V(r) = −V0 r < a , V(r) = 0 r > a ,
where V0 > 0. Assume the particle has orbital angular momentum l = 0 (that is, it is in the S-wave
state).
1. Show that there are no bound states unless
V0a2 >
π22

2. If the ground state of the particle is only just bound, show that the well depth V0 and radius a are
related to the binding energy by the expansion

where κ =

2μ|E|/2. The simplest compound nucleus is the deuteron, which consists of a proton
and neutron. They are bound with an energy of 2.226 MeV and there are no discrete excited states.
If the deuteron is represented by a particle with reduced mass μ given by
μ = mpmn
mp + mn
,
where mp and mn are, respectively, the proton and neutron mass, moving in a square well potential
of radius a = 1.5 fm, estimate the depth V0 of the potential.
Solution
Part 1
Bound states (if they occur) must have energies in the range −V0 < E < 0. The radial Schrodinger ¨
equation in the S-wave case for the reduced wave function u(r) reads
u
<(r) + v0u<(r) = || u<(r) 0 ≤ r < a , u
>(r) = ||u>(r) r > a ,
2 Since the differential equation defining fk,n (x) is homogeneous, the overall normalization factor is arbitrary.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press310 Bound States in a Central Potential: Applications
where we define v0 = 2μV0/2 and  = 2μE/2 (and take E < 0). The boundary conditions are
u<(r) ∝ r as r −→ 0 , limr→∞ u>(r) = 0 ,
and u(r) is continuous along with its first derivative at r = a. We find
u<(r) = A sin(Kr) , u>(r) = B e−κr ,
where
K = 
v0 − || , κ = 
|| ,
and note that 0 < || < v0. Imposing the continuity of u(r) and u
(r) yields
A sin(Ka) = B e−κa , AKcos(Ka) = −κ e−κa ,
from which we obtain the eigenvalue equation
tan(Ka) = −K
κ .
Set x =Ka and hence κa =

x2
0 − x2 with x2
0 = a2v0, and the equation above reduces to
tan x = − x

x2
0 − x2
0 < x < x0 .
A rough plot of the left- and right-hand sides of this relation shows that, for at least a single bound
state to occur, we must have x0 > π/2, and so
x2
0 >
π2
4 =⇒ V0a2 >

Since the particle is only just bound, its energy is close to zero (in magnitude). It is also clear that x0
must be close to π/2 (that is, x0 −→ π+/2). We expand f (z) for small z as
f (z) = z tan x0 + O(z

around π/2. We define u = x0 − π/2 with |u|  1, and note that

Using the deuteron binding energy of 2.226 MeV and a = 1.5 fm, the expansion parameter is
κa ≈ 0.348 =⇒ V0 ≈ 58.3 MeV ,
where we have kept only the linear term κa in the expansion of V0.

Problem 8 Particle Constrained in a Spherical Potential Well
Consider a particle in a spherical potential well V(r) given by V(r) = −V0 (V0 > 0) for r ≤ r0, and
V(r) = ∞ for r > r0.
1. Obtain the S-wave energy eigenvalues.
2. Obtain an expression for the energy eigenvalues for a generic orbital angular momentum l and the
corresponding eigenfunctions.
Solution
Part 1
The radial equation in 0 ≤ r ≤ r0 reads
u
l (r) +

 + v0 − l(l + 1)
r2

ul(r) = 0 , v0 = 2μV0
2 > 0 and  = 2μE
2 ,
with the boundary conditions ul(r −→ 0) ∝ rl+1 and ul(r0) = 0. We must have  ≥ −v0 for acceptable
solutions. The case of S-waves (corresponding to l = 0) is especially simple, since then
u
0 (r) + ( + v0)u0 (r) = 0 ,
which (for  > −v0) has as solutions linear combinations of sin(kr) and cos(kr) with
k = √ + v0 ,  > −v0 .
However, u0 (r) must vanish at the origin and also at r0, and therefore the only allowed solutions are
proportional to sin(kr) with
kr0 = nπ =⇒ En = −V0 + (nπ)22
2μr2
0
, n = 1, 2, ...
It can be seen that there is an infinite number of S-wave bound states.
Part 2
For a generic l, the radial equation can be cast into the form of a Bessel equation. To this end, it is
convenient to work with Rl(r) rather than ul(r), so that

Jl(ρ) = 0 ,
which is in the form of a Bessel equation with ν = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ... , with solutions
Rl(ρ) = Jl(ρ)
ρ1/2 = αjl(ρ) + βnl(ρ) ,
where jl(ρ) and nl(ρ) are known as the regular and irregular spherical Bessel functions, respec￾tively;
3 for illustration, we list a few of them:
j0 (ρ) = sin ρ

ρ .
In the limit ρ −→ 0, the Bessel functions behave as
jl(ρ) ∝ ρl , nl(ρ) ∝ ρ−(l+1) .
Again, because of the boundary conditions, we must have β = 0 and jl(kr0) = 0, that is, kr0 must be
a node of jl(ρ). There is an infinite number of nodes for any fixed l, and we label them ρnl with
jl(ρnl) = 0,
kr0 = ρnl =⇒ Enl = −V0 +

The bound-state energies Enl depend on n and l but are independent of the azimuthal quantum number
m. Therefore, each eigenvalue Enl has degeneracy gnl = 2l + 1; in particular, the ground state, for
which nl = 1s, is non-degenerate. No analytical expression is available for the nodes ρnl, except for
l = 0. The resulting level ordering for the lowest states can be easily obtained from Table 10.1. The
eigenfunctions are obtained as

3 Incidentally, the above procedure also provides the solutions of the radial equation for a free particle. In that case v0 = 0, the
range of ρ (or r) is 0 ≤ ρ < ∞, and the condition of regularity at the origin imposes β = 0 in the linear combination above.
The spherical Bessel function jl(ρ) is bounded (but is not normalizable).

Problem 12 WKB Approximation of the Hydrogen-like Atom Spectrum
Apply the WKB formula derived in Problem 13 in Chapter 4 to obtain the (bound-state) energy levels
of a S-wave electron (charge −e) in the Coulomb field of a nucleus with charge Ze (the hydrogen-like
system).
Derive the energy levels for a generic angular momentum l.
The application of the WKB method for the radial equation needs to be discussed. The radial
coordinate r is in the range 0 < r < ∞, and there is no boundary condition as r goes to −∞ (in contrast
with the one-dimensional case). In the specific case of the Coulomb attractive potential, the formula
as derived in Problem 13 in Chapter 4 can be applied when the orbital angular momentum l 
 1,
since only then is the smallest inversion point sufficiently far from the origin. We will ignore this
issue here, and use the WKB formula without concerning ourselves with such a difficulty.

where in the classically allowed region  > v(r). Here, r± are the classical inversion points (with
 < 0). Setting
γ = Ze2μ

we find the inversion points from v(r) = , which yields

Comment
In reference to the cautionary note in the text of the problem, we observe the following. For S-waves
(with an attractive Coulomb potential), the smallest inversion point is the origin, where u(r) must
vanish. We can use the WKB formulae as follows. For r 
 r+ (here r+ is the largest inversion point),
we must have a decreasing exponential, namely
u0 (r) ≈ A− √
κ(r) exp 

The connection formulae in this case give (here, A+ is zero)

and the wave function in the classically allowed region is

The boundary conditions on u0 (r) are:

u0 (r) = 0 , limr→∞ u0 (r) = 0 .
The general solution of the Bessel equation is the linear combination
u0 (ξ) = AJ|α|(ξ) + BJ−|α|(ξ) ,
where J|α|(ξ) and J−|α|(ξ) are Bessel functions. In terms of ξ the boundary condition at r −→ ∞
implies ξ −→ 0; since J−|α|(ξ) is divergent in this limit, we must have B = 0. Hence, we are left with

Problem 15 Virial Theorem in Three Dimensions
Consider a particle of mass μ in a central potential which admits bound states.
1. Show that the operator Oˆ, defined as
Oˆ = rˆ · pˆ + pˆ · rˆ ,
has vanishing expectation values on the eigenstates |ψElm of the Hamiltonian.
2. Show that if |ψ(t) is a generic state at time t then
d
dtψ(t)|Oˆ|ψ(t) = 2ψ(t)|pˆ 2
/μ − rˆ · ∇ Vˆ(rˆ)|ψ(t) .
3. Specialize to the case in which |ψ(t) −→ e−iEt/ |ψElm. What does the relation derived in
part 2 imply in this case? Show that, if the potential is proportional to a power ˆr α, this relation
allows us to determine the expectation values of the kinetic and potential energy operators
independently. Determine these expectation values in the case of the hydrogen atom and isotropic
three-dimensional oscillator.
Solution
Part 1
We note the following identity,
[Hˆ , ˆrα] = 1


Hˆ rˆ2 − rˆ2 Hˆ

,
where, expanding the two commutators, we see that the term ˆrα Hˆ rˆα enters with a plus sign in the
first commutator and a minus in the second, canceling out. The expectation value of Oˆ on a bound
eigenstate of Hˆ vanishes, since
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press326 Bound States in a Central Potential: Applications
ψElm|Oˆ|ψElm = iμ
 ψElm|Hˆ rˆ2 − rˆ2 Hˆ|ψElm = iμ
 (E − E)ψElm|rˆ2 |ψElm = 0 .
It is instructive to derive this result directly. To this end, we note that
rˆ · pˆ −→ −ir · ∇ = −ir ∂
∂r ,
so that
ψElm| rˆ · pˆ |ψElm = −i

where in the last step we have expressed the bound-state wave function as
ψElm(r) = REl(r) Ylm(Ω) ,
and have carried out the angular integration. Note that the (bound-state) radial wave function is real.
We also have
ψElm| rˆ · pˆ |ψElm
∗ = ψElm| pˆ · rˆ |ψElm = i

dr r3
REl(r)R
El(r) ,
which implies that the expectation value of Oˆ vanishes.

and we have already obtained [Hˆ , ˆrα] = −(i/μ)pˆα. We find for the remaining commutator

Part 3
The expectation value of a generic operator on a stationary state (an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian),
|ψElm(t) = e−iEt/ |ψElm ,
is time independent; in our particular case, we have
ψElm(t)|Oˆ|ψElm(t) = ψElm(0)|Oˆ|ψElm(0) = ψElm|Oˆ|ψElm = 0 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press327 10.4 Problems
which in turn yields
ψElm|pˆ 2
/μ − rˆ · ∇ Vˆ(rˆ)|ψElm = 0 =⇒ 2ψElm|Tˆ|ψElm = ψElm|rˆ · ∇ Vˆ(rˆ)|ψElm ,
where Tˆ is the kinetic energy operator. If the potential energy operator is proportional to ˆrα, where α
is a real number, then rˆ · ∇ Vˆ(rˆ) = α Vˆ(rˆ) and the relation above leads to
TˆElm = α

energy operators independently, as
Vˆnlm = 2En = − (Zα)2

Problem 16 Harmonic Oscillator in Two Dimensions in Plane Polar Coordinates
First review Problem 6 and its solution. Then consider the isotropic two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator potential.

Introduce the auxiliary function gn (x), defined as

and show that it satisfies the following differential equation:

g

where
a =  − 2(|n| + 1) , b = 2 |n| + 1 .
2. Posit the following power series solution for gn (x):

where the subscripts n on both g and the coefficients cq have been dropped for brevity. Assume
that the series must terminate (that is, g(x) is a polynomial) for the solution to be acceptable.
Show that this happens if
 − 2(|n| + 1) = 2p or Em = ω(m + 1) with m = p + |n| ,
where p is even and |n| = 0, 1, 2, ... Determine the degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues Em.
3. Justify the assumption above, that is, show that if the series does not terminate then g(x) behaves
asymptotically as x2 ex2
, and hence f (x) behaves as x|n|+2 ex2/2.
Solution
Part 1
Using the results of Problem 6, the wave function is given by
ψn (ρ, θ) = f n (ρ) einθ ,
where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ... and the function f n (ρ) satisfies the radial equation for ρ ≥ 0,


f n (ρ) = 0 .
The boundary conditions on f n (ρ) are that it vanishes for ρ −→ ∞ for bound states and that it is
proportional to ρ|n| as ρ −→ 0 (assuming that ρ2v(ρ) −→ 0 in this limit). In the specific case of the
the (isotropic) harmonic oscillator in two dimensions, we have

f n (x) = 0 ,  =

In the asymptotic region x −→ ∞, f n falls off as e−x2/2 (see Section 10.2), and it is convenient to
define an auxiliary function gn (x):
f n (x) = x|n|
e−x2/2 gn (x) .
in order to remove the short- and long-range behavior. We find

g
n + axgn = 0 ,
where we define
a =  − 2(|n| + 1) , b = 2|n| + 1 .
Part 2
Inserting power series into the differential equation for g(x), and lumping together terms with the
same power of x, we obtain
∞
q=0
[(s + q)(s + q − 1) + b(s + q)] cqxq−1 =
∞
q=0
[2(s + q) − a] cqxq+1 .
For the power series to be a solution, each coefficient of xp must vanish. Consider first the terms
proportional to x−1 and x0,
x−1
: [s(s − 1) + bs] c0 = 0 =⇒ s = 0, 1 − b (for c0  0) ,
x0
: [s(s + 1) + b(s + 1)]  0 for s=0 or s=1−b
c1 = 0 =⇒ c1 = 0 ,
where in the last relation c1 must vanish, since the pre-factor [··· ] is  0 when s is either 0 or 1 − b.
We also observe that the solution corresponding to s = 1 − b = −2|n| would lead to singular behavior
for x −→ 0 – that is, gn ∝ x−2|n| in turn implying f n (x) ∝ x−|n| – which is unacceptable. Therefore,
the only allowed solution is s = 0. Assuming the latter, we find for a generic term proportional to xp+1,
with p ≥ 0,
xp+1
: [(p + 2)(p + 1) + b(p + 2)] cp+2 = [2p − a] cp ,
which implies the following recurrence relation:
cp+2 = 2p − a
(p + 2)(p + 1) + b(p + 2)
cp with p = 0, 2, 4, ...
Because of the condition c1 = 0, it follows that cp = 0 for any odd p. Thus, the series solution is of
the form
g(x) =
∞
p even=0
cpxp , cp+2 = 2p − a
(p + 2)(2|n| + p + 2)
cp ,
where we have inserted the value for b. Clearly, the series terminates if a = 2p with p even, which
yields the eigenvalue
 − 2(|n| + 1) = 2p or Em = ω(m + 1), with m = p + |n| ,
where p is even and |n| = 0, 1, 2, ... The degeneracies of the lowest energy levels are indicated in
Table 10.2. It is easily seen that in general Em has degeneracy gm = m+1, as expected (see Problem 4
in Chapter 8).

The series must terminate, that is, g(x) is a polynomial, because otherwise the solution f (x) would

We therefore conclude that
g(x) = (polynomial in x2) + (q − 1)! c2qx2 ex2
,
which in turn would imply that, in the asymptotic region,
f (x) ∝ x|n|+2 ex2/2 ,
an exponentially diverging f (x). Hence, the series must terminate.

We have already introduced the orbital angular momentum operator Lˆ in our discussion of a particle
in a central potential. In analogy to classical mechanics, it is defined as Lˆ = rˆ × pˆ, and satisfies the
commutation relations [ Lˆi , Lˆj ] = i

k ijk Lˆk, which follow from the commutation relations of the
position and momentum operators. In fact, as we will see later, the angular momentum commutation
relations can be derived from the transformation properties of states and vector operators under
rotations; in particular, invariance under rotations leads to a conserved angular momentum. This
point of view, which is based on symmetry considerations, avoids having to rely on the classical
analogy.
In the treatment that follows, we assume only that there exist three hermitian operators Jˆ
i which
satisfy the commutation relations
[ Jˆ
i , Jˆ
j ] = i

ijk Jˆ

Using these commutation relations, we will obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates of Jˆ2 = Jˆ2
1 +Jˆ2
2 +Jˆ2
3
and Jˆ
3. We will find that the eigenvalues of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
3 are, respectively, j(j + 1)2 and μ, with
j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... and μ = −j, ... , j, and therefore, in addition to integer values, half-integer
values are allowed.
11.1 Raising and Lowering Operators: Definitions and Properties
To begin, we note that
[ Jˆ
i , Jˆ2 ] = 0 , (11.2)
see Problem 1 in Chapter 9 relating to the orbital angular momentum operator (any property derived
using only the commutation relations of the Lˆi clearly also holds in the present case). Next, we define
the raising (+) and lowering (–) angular momentum operators as

Since Jˆ2 and Jˆ
3 commute, they can be diagonalized simultaneously.
11.2 Determining the Eigenvalues of Jˆ2 and ˆJ3
Let |ψλμ be an eigenstate of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
3 with (real) eigenvalues λ and μ (the factors  are included
for convenience, to make λ and μ non-dimensional):
Jˆ2 |ψλμ = λ2 |ψλμ , Jˆ
3 |ψλμ = μ|ψλμ . (11.8)
The set |ψλμ forms a basis,
ψλμ|ψλμ = δλλ δμμ ,

λμ
|ψλμψλμ| = 1ˆ . (11.9)
The following results follow from the commutation relations of Jˆ
± and Jˆ
3:
1. The matrix elements of Jˆ
i in the basis |ψλμ vanish unless λ = λ
, since
0 = ψλμ| Jˆ2 Jˆ
i − Jˆ
i Jˆ2

[ Jˆ2 , Jˆ
i ]=0
|ψλμ = (λ − λ
)2 ψλμ|Jˆ
i|ψλμ , (11.10)
and, therefore, if λ  λ then ψλμ| Jˆ
i |ψλμ = 0. As a consequence the state Jˆ
i |ψλμ can be
expanded as follows:
Jˆ
i |ψλμ =

μ
|ψλμψλμ | Jˆ
i |ψλμ , (11.11)
namely, the expansion is in the subspace spanned by the eigenstates having the same eigenvalue
λ2 of Jˆ2.
2. The states Jˆ
± |ψλμ are proportional to the eigenstates of Jˆ
3 having eigenvalues (μ±1) (that is, Jˆ
+
raises, and Jˆ
− lowers, μ by one unit). Using the first of equations (11.7) from right to left, we have
− ψλμ| Jˆ
+ |ψλμ = ψλμ| Jˆ
+ Jˆ
3 − Jˆ
3 Jˆ
+ 
[ Jˆ
+ , Jˆ
3 ]
|ψλμ = (μ − μ) ψλμ| Jˆ
+ |ψλμ , (11.12)
which leads to
(μ − μ + 1) ψλμ| Jˆ
+ |ψλμ = 0 =⇒ μ = μ + 1 , (11.13)
since it cannot hold that ψλμ| Jˆ
+ |ψλμ = 0 for all μ and μ
, because that would imply that matrix
elements of Jˆ
+ vanish identically on the basis |ψλμ and therefore that Jˆ
+ is the null operator.
Similarly, we find
(μ − μ − 1) ψλμ| Jˆ
− |ψλμ = 0 =⇒ μ = μ − 1 . (11.14)
From these last two relations we conclude that Jˆ
± |ψλμ must be proportional to the eigenstates
|ψλμ±1, that is
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press334 Angular Momentum: General Properties
Jˆ
+ |ψλμ = a(λ, μ) |ψλμ+1 , Jˆ
− |ψλμ = b(λ, μ) |ψλμ−1 . (11.15)
The coefficients a(λ, μ) and b(λ, μ) are related to each other, since, using Jˆ
†
+ = Jˆ
−, we have
a∗ (λ, μ) = ψλμ+1 | Jˆ
+ |ψλμ
∗ = ψλμ| Jˆ
− |ψλμ+1 = b(λ, μ + 1) , (11.16)
and therefore
Jˆ
+ |ψλμ = a(λ, μ) |ψλμ+1 , Jˆ
− |ψλμ = a∗ (λ, μ − 1) |ψλμ−1 . (11.17)

We arrive at the following recurrence relation:

2 = 2μ2 , (11.21)
which has the solution2
|a(λ, μ)|
2 = c(λ) − μ(μ + 1)2 . (11.22)
4. It turns out that c(λ) = λ2 and that λ ≥ 0. Since Jˆ2 can be expressed in terms of raising and

i |ψλμ = 
i Jˆ
i |ψλμ2 ≥ 0, where Jˆ
i |ψλμ is the norm of the state Jˆ
i |ψλμ,
we conclude that λ ≥ 0.
2 To see how this comes about, define f (μ) = |a(λ, μ)|
2; the recurrence relation can then be written (taking μ −→ μ + 1) as
f (μ) − f (μ + 1) = 2(μ + 1)2 .
In the limit μ 
 1, we have f 
(μ) ≈ −2μ2, since in this limit the left-hand side of the equation above is nothing other
than −f 
(μ); thus we conclude that, for μ 
 1, f (μ) = −μ22. Assuming that f (μ) is a polynomial in μ, it must have the
general form f (μ) = c + dμ − μ22. Inserting this into the equation above determines d:

Note that c can depend on λ.

Having established that
λ ≥ 0 , |a(λ, μ)|
2 = 
λ − μ(μ + 1)

2 , (11.25)
we can now easily obtain the values taken on by the eigenvalues λ and μ. To begin with, if we apply
Jˆ
± to |ψλμ we change μ by ±1. We can apply the raising or lowering operators to |ψλμ repeatedly,
but it is clear that such a procedure must terminate at some point otherwise the positivity condition
above for |a(λ, μ)|
2 would be violated. We also note that the norms squared (necessarily ≥0) of the
two states Jˆ
− |ψλμ and Jˆ
+ |ψλμ are

|ψλμ = |a(λ, μ)|

2 ≥ 0 . (11.27)
Since, for a given λ, these inequalities are satisfied if
Eq. (11.26):
1 − √
1 + 4λ
2 ≤ μ ≤
1 + √
1 + 4λ
2 ,
Eq. (11.27): −1 − √
1 + 4λ
2 ≤ μ ≤ −1 + √
1 + 4λ
2 ,
then they will be satisfied simultaneously if μ is in the following range:
1 − √
1 + 4λ
2 ≤ μ ≤ −1 + √
1 + 4λ
2 . (11.28)
We now express λ as j( j + 1) with j ≥ 0, and, in terms of j, noting that 
1 + 4j(j + 1) = 2j + 1, the
inequality above simply reads
− j ≤ μ ≤ j . (11.29)
We still need to establish that j is an integer or a half integer. Let us denote by μ0 the minimum
allowed value for the eigenvalue of Jˆ
3. The corresponding eigenstate must be such that Jˆ
− |ψjμ0  = 0,
and, Jˆ
− |ψjμ0  being the null state, its norm must vanish. Then, using Eq. (11.26) with λ = j(j + 1),
we find
0 = Jˆ
− |ψjμ0 2 = ψjμ0 | Jˆ
+ Jˆ
− |ψjμ0  = 
j(j + 1) − μ0 (μ0 − 1)

2 =⇒ μ0 = −j . (11.30)
Thus, the minimum allowed value has μ0 = −j. Now, we act p times with Jˆ
+ on the state |ψj,−j. This
process must also terminate, and so there must be an integer p such that (Jˆ
+)p |ψj,−j is the null state
with (Jˆ
+)p |ψj,−j2 = 0. To calculate this norm, we observe that

Next, we use p times the first of equations (11.17) along with its adjoint,
(Jˆ
+ |ψj,−j)
† = (ψj,−j| Jˆ
−) = a∗ (λ, −j) ψj,−j+1 | , (11.32)
where λ stands for j(j + 1), to arrive at
(Jˆ
+)
p |ψj,−j2 = |a(λ, −j)|
2 |a(λ, −j + 1)|
2 ··· |a(λ, −j + p − 1)|
2 . (11.33)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press336 Angular Momentum: General Properties
This norm vanishes if
|a(λ, −j + p − 1)|
2 = [j(j + 1) − (−j + p)(−j + p − 1)]2 = 0 , (11.34)
from which we obtain either p = 0 or p = 2 j + 1. The first solution is not acceptable since it would say
that |ψj,−j is the null state, thus contradicting that it is the state with the minimum eigenvalue of Jˆ
3.
The other solution says that, since p is an integer ≥ 1, j is either an integer or half integer, namely
j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... .
11.3 Basis Consisting of Eigenstates of Jˆ2 and ˆJ3
We provide in this section a summary of the results obtained so far. The simultaneous eigenstates of
Jˆ2 and Jˆ

where we have made a choice of phase, in the sense that the coefficient a(λ, μ) = |a(λ, μ)| eiφ(λ,μ)
with λ = j(j + 1) has been taken to be real (the arbitrary phase factor φ(λ, μ) has been set to zero).
In particular, note that
Jˆ
+ |ψj,j = 0 , Jˆ
− |ψj,−j = 0 . (11.38)
We can also obtain the matrix representations of the Jˆ
i in this basis. We have already established
that the matrix elements ψjμ| Jˆ
i |ψj
μ vanish unless j = j

; the matrices representing Jˆ

subspace with a given j are square matrices of dimensions (2j + 1) × (2j + 1). In particular, the
matrix representing Jˆ

matrices representing Jˆ

where μ, μ = −j, −j + 1, ... , j. We have also used the fact that these matrix elements vanish unless
the eigenvalue j of Jˆ2 is the same for the left-hand and right-hand states. Of course, Jz is diagonal in
this basis, and
(Jz)μμ = μ δμ,μ .

Problem 5 Construction of the State of a Spin-1 Particle Polarized in a General Direction
The normalized state |ψ is in the subspace spanned by the eigenstates of Jˆ2 having eigenvalue
22. Suppose |ψ is also an eigenstate of n · Jˆ with eigenvalue +; here, n is the unit vector with
components (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ). Obtain |ψ as a linear combination of the eigenstates
|m of Jˆ
z with m = ±1, 0.
Solution
Since |ψ is an eigenstate of n · Jˆ, we have
n · Jˆ |ψ = |ψ ,
where
|ψ =

m=±1,0
cm|m ,
and |m are the eigenstates of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z with eigenvalues 22 and m, with m =±1, 0, respectively.
It is convenient to express the projection of Jˆ along n in terms of raising and lowering operators:
n · Jˆ = sin θ cos φ Jˆ

Problem 6 Construction of Spherical Harmonics
The eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum satisfy the eigenvalue equations
Lˆ 2 |ψl,m = l(l + 1)2 |ψl,m , Lˆz |ψl,m = m |ψl,m ,
where l = 0, 1, 2, ... and m = −l, ... , l. In the coordinate representation, the corresponding wave
functions are the spherical harmonics,
Yl,m(θ, φ) = φr |ψl,m .
1. Using the expression for Lz as a differential operator, solve the differential equation implied by
the second eigenvalue equation above to show that the φ dependence of Yl,m(θ, φ) is proportional
to eimφ.
2. Using the condition L+ |ψl,l = 0 and the fact that Yl,l(θ, φ) = Fl(θ) eilφ, show that
Yl,l(θ, φ) = cl sinl θ eilφ ,
where cl is a normalization factor.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press343 11.4 Problems
3. Assume that the orbital angular momentum can also take on half-integer values, say l =1/2.
Construct the “spherical harmonic Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ)” by (i) applying the lowering operator
L− to Y1/2,1/2 (θ, φ) ∝ sin1/2 θ eiφ/2 and (ii) by solving the differential equation resulting from
L− Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ) = 0. Show that the two procedures are problematic and yield contradictory
results. Thus, half-integer values cannot occur for the orbital angular momentum operator.
(Adapted from J. J. Sakurai and J. Napolitano (2020), Modern Quantum Mechanics, Cambridge
University Press.)
Solution
Part 1
In the coordinate representation we have
Lz −→ −i ∂
∂φ ,
and hence
Lz |ψl,m = m|ψl,m =⇒ −i ∂
∂φ Yl,m(θ, φ) = m Yl,m(θ, φ) =⇒ Yl,m(θ, φ) = Fl,m(θ) eimφ .
Part 2
The raising and lowering (orbital) angular momentum operators are given by the following
differential operators:
L± = Lx ± i Ly = ±  e±iφ
	 ∂
∂θ ± i cot θ ∂
∂φ


,
and hence
L+ |ψl,l = 0 =⇒  eiφ
	 ∂
∂θ + i cot θ ∂
∂φ


Fl,l(θ) eilφ = 0 ,
yielding the differential equation
d
dθFl,l(θ) = l cot θ Fl,l(θ) .
This latter equation is easily solved writing,
dFl,l
Fl,l
= l cot θ dθ =⇒
 Fl,l dF
l,l
F
l,l
= l
 θ
cot θ dθ =⇒ ln |Fl,l| = l ln |sin θ| + constant ,
and so
Fl,l(θ) = cl sinl θ ,
with cl constant.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press344 Angular Momentum: General Properties
Part 3
We first apply the lowering operator to Y1/2,1/2 (θ, φ), that is
L− Y1/2,1/2 (θ, φ) = 

1/2(1/2 + 1) − 1/2(1/2 − 1)  unity
Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ) ,
yielding
Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ) = 1

L− Y1/2,1/2 (θ, φ) ,
where, using the result of part 2, we have
Y1/2,1/2 (θ, φ) = c1/2 sin1/2 θ eiφ/2 .
We find
Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ) = −c1/2 e−iφ
	 ∂
∂θ − i cot θ ∂
∂φ


sin1/2 θ eiφ/2 = −c1/2 e−iφ/2 cot θ sin1/2 θ ,
and we observe that the solution is singular at the end points θ = 0 and π.
We now obtain Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ) = G1/2 (θ) e−iφ/2 (note that the φ dependence follows from part 1) by
determining the function G1/2 (θ) via the requirement
L− Y1/2,−1/2 (θ, φ) = 0 =⇒ − e−iφ
	 ∂
∂θ − i cot θ ∂
∂φ


G1/2 (θ) e−iφ/2 = 0 ,
leading to the differential equation
d
dθ G1/2 (θ) = 1
2 cot θ G1/2 (θ) =⇒ G1/2 (θ) = d1/2 sin1/2 θ ,
where d1/2 is a normalization constant. Thus, we see that the two procedures lead to inconsistent
results, namely
Y1/2,−1/2 = −c1/2 e−iφ/2 cot θ sin1/2 θ and Y1/2,−1/2 = d1/2 e−iφ/2 sin1/2 θ .

where I1 and I3 are moments of inertia and Lˆx, Lˆy, and Lˆz are the components of the orbital angular
momentum operator.
1. Determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and their degeneracy in the two limits I1 = I3 and
I1 > I3. Sketch the energy spectrum in these two limits.
2. What are the eigenvalues and their degeneracy in the limit I1 
 I3?

We consider two cases.
1. I1 = I3: the eigenvalues are independent of the azimuthal quantum number m and are given by
El = 2l(l + 1)

with degeneracy gl = 2 l + 1.

and the states with positive or negative m are degenerate; specifically, the eigenvalues El0 are
non-degenerate while the eigenvalues El|m| are two-fold degenerate.
Part 2
If I1 
 I3 then we have
E|m| = 2m2
2I3
,
and E|m| is infinitely degenerate, since for m = 0 the states with l ≥ 0 all have vanishing energy, for
|m| = 1 the states with l ≥ 1 all have energy 2/(2I3), and so on.

Part 2
Since the Jˆ
i operators satisfy the same commutation relations as the angular momentum components
(up to factors of ), it follows that Jˆ2 and Jˆ
3 commute. It also follows that the possible eigenvalues
of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
3 are j = 0, 1/2, 1, ... and m = −j, −j + 1, ... , j, respectively (using the same proof as for
angular momentum operators).

Problem 11 Orbital Angular Momentum and Parity
Let Lˆ be the orbital angular momentum of a particle. The parity operator Pˆ acting on a generic state
|ψ leads in the coordinate representation to
Pˆ |ψ −→ Pψ(r, θ, φ) = ψ(r, π − θ, φ + π) ,
where ψ(r, θ, φ) is the wave function in spherical coordinates.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press350 Angular Momentum: General Properties
1. Show that [ Pˆ , Lˆ ]|ψ = 0 on any state |ψ by using the explicit expression for L in spherical
coordinates. This implies that [ Pˆ , Lˆ ] = 0.
2. Deduce from part 1 that the spherical harmonics have a well-defined parity depending only on the
quantum number l of Lˆ 2. Determine this parity.
Solution
Part 1
Recall that, in the coordinate representation,
Lx = 
	
sin φ ∂
∂θ + cot θ cos φ ∂
∂φ


, Ly = i
	
− cos φ ∂
∂θ + cot θ sin φ ∂
∂φ


, Lz = −i ∂
∂φ .
Under parity we have θ −→ θ = π − θ and φ −→ φ = φ + π, and hence
∂
∂θ = ∂θ
∂θ
∂
∂θ = − ∂
∂θ , ∂
∂φ = ∂
∂φ .
We first consider
Lx P ψ(r, θ, φ) = Lx ψ(r, θ
, φ
)
= 

− sin(φ − π) ∂
∂θ + cot(π − θ
) cos(φ − π) ∂
∂φ

ψ(r, θ
, φ
)
= 

sin φ ∂
∂θ + cot θ cos φ ∂
∂φ

ψ(r, θ
, φ
) .
Next, we examine
P Lx ψ(r, θ, φ) =  P
	
sin φ ∂
∂θ + cot θ cos φ ∂
∂φ


ψ(r, θ, φ)
= 

sin φ ∂
∂θ + cot θ cos φ ∂
∂φ

ψ(r, θ
, φ
) .
Thus, for any wave function ψ(r, θ, φ), we have Lx P ψ(r, θ, φ) = P Lx ψ(r, θ, φ), implying that the
operators Lˆx and Pˆ commute with each other. A similar argument works for Lˆy and Lˆz. An alternative
proof consists of noting that under parity the position and momentum operators are odd, namely
rˆ −→ rˆ = Pˆ rˆ Pˆ† = −rˆ and pˆ −→ pˆ  = Pˆ pˆ Pˆ† = −pˆ, and hence Lˆ is invariant, since Lˆ −→ Lˆ  =
Pˆ Lˆ Pˆ† = Pˆ rˆ Pˆ† × Pˆ pˆ Pˆ† = rˆ × pˆ = Lˆ .
Part 2
First note that, since Pˆ2 = 1ˆ, the eigenvalues of Pˆ are ±1. Furthermore, since it commutes with Lˆ 2
and Lˆz, it follows that the spherical harmonics are also eigenfunctions of Pˆ; indeed,
Lz P Ylm(Ω) = P Lz Ylm(Ω) = m P Ylm(Ω) ,
but the Ylm are non-degenerate on the unit sphere (in other words, L2 and Lz form a complete set
of commuting observables on the unit sphere), and hence P Ylm(Ω) must be proportional to Ylm(Ω),
that is
P Ylm(Ω) = clmYlm(Ω) .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press351 11.4 Problems
The eigenvalue clm must be independent of m, since for example
clm Ylm(Ω) = P Ylm(Ω) = P L+ Ylm−1 (Ω)

√
l(l + 1) − m(m − 1) = L+ P Ylm−1 (Ω)

√
l(l + 1) − m(m − 1)
= clm−1

√
l(l + 1) − m(m − 1)
L+ Ylm−1 (Ω) = clm−1Ylm(Ω) ,
implying that clm = clm−1. In order to determine the parity of the Ylm(Ω), we consider Yl0 (Ω), which
is given by
Yl0 (Ω) =
2l + 1
4π
Pl(cos θ) ,
where (x = cos θ)
Pl(x) = 1
2l l!
dl
dxl (x2 − 1)
l .
Under parity x −→ −x, and hence
Pl(x) = 1
2l l!
dl
d(−x)l [(−x)
2 − 1]l = (−1)
l
Pl(x) ,
from which we deduce that
P Ylm(θ, φ) = Ylm(π − θ, φ + π) = (−1)
l
Ylm(θ, φ) .
Problem 12 Verification of the Properties Satisfied by ˆ
L±

operators),
L± Ylm(Ω) = 

l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1) Yl,m±1 (Ω) ,
where L± are the raising and lowering orbital angular momentum operators.
Hint: Use the explicit expressions for L± in spherical coordinates and recall the following

In spherical coordinates, the L± differential operators read
L± = Lx ± i Ly = ±  e±iφ

Using explicit expressions for the Ylm(Ω), we obtain

Problem 13 Transformation of States and Vector Operators Under Rotations
Consider a vector operator Vˆ . By definition it satisfies the following commutation relations with the
components of the angular momentum Jˆ:

1. Consider the operator
Uˆ y (β) = e−iβJˆ
y/
,
and prove that it represents a rotation by an angle β about the y-direction by showing that
Uˆ y (β) Vˆ

Hint: Define Vˆ (β) = Uˆ y (β) Vˆ Uˆ†
y (β) with Vˆ (β = 0) = Vˆ and consider the derivatives of the
components Vˆi(β) with respect to β.
2. Assuming the above transformation properties for the components Vˆ

β −→ 0 they imply the commutation relations of Jˆ

3. Show that the state Uˆ y (π) |ψjm, obtained by applying a rotation by π about the y-axis to an
eigenstate |ψjm of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z with eigenvalues j(j + 1)2 and m, remains an eigenstate of these
operators with eigenvalues j(j + 1)2 and −m, respectively.

e−iβJˆ
z/ = e−i(π/2)Jˆ
x/
e−iβJˆ

ei(π/2)Jˆ

which, as we will see in a later chapter, says that a rotation by β about the z-axis can be achieved
by the following sequence of rotations: (i) a rotation by π/2 about the x-axis; then (ii) a rotation
by β about the y
-axis (the new y-axis); and lastly (iii) a rotation by −π/2 about the x-axis (the
new x-axis).3
Solution
Part 1
Following the hint, we consider
d
dβ
Vˆ
i(β) = − i
 e−iβJˆ
y/ 
Jˆ
y Vˆ
i − Vˆ
i Jˆ


eiβJˆ
y/ = 2ij e−iβJˆ
y/ Vˆ

y/ = 2ij Vˆ
j(β) ,
or, explicitly,
d
dβ
Vˆ
x (β) = −Vˆ
z(β) , d
dβ
Vˆ
y (β) = 0 , d
dβ
Vˆ
z(β) = Vˆ
x (β) .
We immediately obtain that Vˆ
y (β) = Vˆ
y (0) = Vˆ
y is independent of β. We also find
d2
dβ2 Vˆ
x (β) = − d
dβ
Vˆ
z(β) = −Vˆ
x (β) ,
with the initial conditions

dβ
Vˆ
x (β)



β=0
= −Vˆ
z(0) = −Vˆ
z .
The above second-order differential equation has the solution
Vˆ
x (β) = Aˆ cos β + Bˆ sin β .
Imposing the initial conditions yields
Aˆ = Vˆ
x , Bˆ = −Vˆ
z =⇒ Vx (β) = Vˆ
x cos β − Vˆ
z sin β ,
which in turn implies that
Vˆ
z(β) = − d
dβ
Vˆ
x (β) = Vˆ
x sin β + Vˆ
z cos β .
3 The attentive reader will have noticed that the sequence of operators in e−i(π/2)Jˆ
x/e−iβJˆ
y/ei(π/2)Jˆ
x/ appears to be reversed
with respect to the order in which the rotations are actually carried out (the rotation by −π/2 about the x-axis is carried
out first rather than last, while that by π/2 about the same axis is carried out last rather than first. For an explanation, see
Section 17.1.

Part 3
We first note that, since Jˆ2 commutes with the components Jˆ
i, it commutes, in particular, with Uy (β)
and hence
Jˆ2 Uˆ y (β) |ψjm = Uˆ y (β) Jˆ2 |ψjm = j(j + 1)2 Uˆ y (β) |ψjm ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.012 Published online by Cambridge University Press356 Angular Momentum: General Properties
showing that Uˆ y (β) |ψjm is an eigenstate of Jˆ2 for any β. Now, consider
Jˆ

y (β) Jˆ

and
Jˆ
z(−β) = −Jˆ
x sin β + Jˆ
z cos β =⇒ Jˆ
z(−π) = −Jˆ
z .
We conclude that, for β = π ,
Jˆ
z Uˆ y (π) |ψjm = Uˆ y (π)(−Jˆ
z)|ψjm = −m Uˆ y (π)|ψjm ,
showing that the state Uˆ y (π) |ψjm is an eigenstate of Jˆ
z with eigenvalue −m; in fact, it can differ
from |ψj,−m by at most a phase factor.

ikj(Lkpj − pkLj) = −(L × p − p × L)i ,

hence

where in the first line we have expressed piLj = Ljpi +[pi , Lj] and have used pirk = rkpi, valid for i  k

it is obvious that the last two terms satisfy the commutation relations appropriate for vector operators.

Using the earlier notation for the terms in K, we have

Since the hermitian operators J± satisfy the angular momentum commutation relations, their squares
must have eigenvalues given by 2 j±(j± + 1) with j± = 0, 1/2, 1, ... (that is, integer and half-integer

We have established that the square of the angular momentum operator generally admits eigenvalues
j(j + 1)2 with j integer or semi-integer. On the other hand, in our treatment of a particle in a central
potential we obtained the eigenvalues of the square of the orbital angular momentum operator as
l(l + 1)2 with l integer. The question arises then whether semi-integer values occur in nature. The
answer is in the positive, as particles, in addition to orbital angular momentum, have an intrinsic
angular momentum that we call spin. Spin can assume semi-integer or integer values – for example,
the electron and photon have spin 1/2 and spin 1, respectively. In Chapter 13 we will study how
to combine the orbital and spin angular momenta to form the total angular momentum of a particle
(this is the general problem of the addition of angular momenta). Here, we present the treatment of
spin degrees of freedom and discuss some of the physical consequences of spin, in particular the
interaction of its magnetic dipole moment with a magnetic field. We also briefly review the classical
and quantum mechanical treatments of a charged particle in an external electromagnetic field. Below,
we specialize to the case of spin 1/2, but most of what we will say can be generalized to the case of
a particle with spin ≥ 1.
12.1 Treatment of a Spin-1/2 Particle
For a spin-1/2 particle, let |+ and |− represent the two eigenstates of Sˆ 2 and Sˆ
z (we use the symbol
Sˆ rather than Jˆ to denote the spin angular momentum) with eigenvalues given by
Sˆ 2 |± = 3
4
2 |± , Sˆ
z |± = ±
1
2
 |± . (12.1)
The spin operator commutes with the position and momentum operators of the particle, [ Sˆ
i , ˆrj ] =
0 = [ Sˆ
i , ˆpj ], and therefore also commutes with any operator function of rˆ and pˆ, in particular the
orbital angular momentum Lˆ = rˆ × pˆ. Orbital and spin operators act in different state spaces; the
orbital state space is infinite dimensional, while the spin state space is two dimensional (or 2s + 1
dimensional for a generic spin s ≥ 1).
Since rˆ, Sˆ 2, and Sˆ
z commute, we can form a continuous basis of common eigenstates of these
observables. These eigenstates consist of tensor products of the eigenstates |φr of rˆ and the
eigenstates |σ of Sˆ 2 and Sˆ
z, with σ = ±, and will be denoted as
|φr,σ≡|φr⊗|σ . (12.2)
Since they form a basis, they satisfy the properties
φr,σ |φr,σ = δ(r − r
) δσ,σ ,

σ=±

dr |φr,σφr,σ | = 1ˆ . (12.3)
365
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press366 Spin; Charged Particle in an Electromagnetic Field
Any state |ψ of the particle in this combined orbital and spin space can be expanded in the basis
above:
|ψ =

σ=±

dr ψσ (r) |φr,σ , ψσ (r) = φr,σ |ψ , (12.4)
and the wave function ψσ (r) now depends on the spin projection. We therefore interpret |ψσ (r)|
2 dr
as the probability for the particle to be in a volume dr centered at r with spin projection σ. In
particular, 
σ=± |ψσ (r)|
2 dr and  dr |ψσ (r)|
2 are interpreted as the probabilities, respectively, for
the particle to be at r in dr regardless of its spin projection, and for the particle to be in spin projection
σ regardless of its location in space.
In the basis |φr,σ, a generic operator Aˆ acting on both space and spin degrees of freedom has
matrix elements given by
Aσσ (r, r
) = φr,σ |Aˆ|φr,σ . (12.5)
Thus in this basis the state |ψ can be thought of as a two-dimensional vector in spin space (a spinor
wave function),
|ψ −→ 	
ψ+(r)
ψ−(r)


, (12.6)
and the operator Aˆ as a 2 × 2 square matrix,
Aˆ −→ 	
A++(r, r
) A+−(r, r
)
A−+(r, r
) A−−(r, r
)


. (12.7)
The action of Aˆ on |ψ can be represented as
φr,σ |Aˆ|ψ =

σ=±

dr
φr,σ |Aˆ|φr,σφr,σ |ψ =

σ=±

Aσσ (r, r

or, in matrix notation,
Aˆ |ψ −→

)
A−+(r, r
) A−−(r, r

 	ψ+(r
)
ψ−(r
)


. (12.9)
Of course, we could have chosen the continuous basis of common eigenstates |φp,σ of pˆ, Sˆ 2, and
Sˆ
z (or, in fact, any other basis of common eigenstates of a complete set of commuting observables
that includes Sˆ 2 and Sˆ
z).
12.2 Charged Particle in an Electromagnetic Field
In this section we review the treatment of a charged particle in an external electromagnetic (EM)
field, first classically and then quantum mechanically. The EM field consists of an electric and a
magnetic field, respectively E(r, t) and B(r, t), which satisfy Maxwell’s equations (we use Gaussian
units; in these units the Coulomb force between two charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is
given by q1q2/r2)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press367 12.2 Charged Particle in an Electromagnetic Field
1. ∇ · E(r, t) = 4πρ(r, t) , 3. ∇ × E(r, t) = −∂B(r, t)

2. ∇ · B(r, t) = 0 , 4. ∇ × B(r, t) = 4π
c
j(r, t) +
∂E(r, t)
c ∂t . (12.11)
The fields can be described by a scalar and a vector potential, which we denote respectively as U(r, t)
and A(r, t). To see this, note that the first of Eqs. (12.11) implies that
B(r, t) = ∇ × A(r, t) , (12.12)
and equation 3 then gives
∇ ×

E(r, t) +
∂
c ∂t
A(r, t)

= 0 , (12.13)
which says that the quantity in square brackets can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function,
E(r, t) +
∂
c ∂t
A(r, t) = −∇U(r, t) , (12.14)
where a minus sign is conventionally introduced. Note that the physical fields E and B can be
described by different pairs of U and A fields (using different gauges). For, suppose that we have
two pairs of vector and scalar potentials A, U and A
, U both of which give rise to the same EM
fields. Then we have
∇ × A(r, t) = B(r, t) = ∇ × A
(r, t) =⇒ ∇ × 
A
(r, t) − A(r, t)
 = 0 , (12.15)
and hence
A
(r, t) = A(r, t) + ∇Λ(r, t) , (12.16)
where Λ is an arbitrary scalar function. Furthermore, we have
− ∇U(r, t) − ∂
c ∂t
A(r, t) = E(r, t) = −∇U
(r, t) − ∂
c ∂t
A
(r, t) , (12.17)
from which we deduce that
∇

U
(r, t) − U(r, t) +
∂
c ∂t
Λ(r, t)

= 0 . (12.18)
The scalar quantity in square brackets can only be a function of time, since its gradient with respect
to the space variables vanishes identically. We conveniently choose this arbitrary function of time to
be zero, so that
U
(r, t) = U(r, t) − ∂
c ∂t
Λ(r, t) . (12.19)
If A and U are inserted into Eqs. (12.12) and (12.14), we find the given EM fields. Thus different
pairs of vector and scalar potentials are related to each other as in Eqs. (12.16) and (12.19). Of
course, once a gauge A, U has been chosen, the remaining two of Maxwell’s equations (1 and 4) can
be expressed in terms of these potentials.

scalar and vector potentials as (see Problem 4)

where we note that the result of operating with ∂/∂r˙i on U vanishes since U depends only on r.
The Lagrangian for a charged particle in an EM field now follows easily by taking L = T−V, where
T is the kinetic energy and V is the velocity-dependent potential introduced above, namely
L = mr˙2

that is, L and L would differ by the total time derivative of an arbitrary function. Consequently,
when taking variations of the action integral relative to L
, this total time derivative drops out, and
the equations of motions derived from L and L are the same. This is apparent from Eq. (12.23): it
involves the E and B fields, which are independent of the gauge choice.
The Hamiltonian follows from
H(r, p) = p · r˙ − L(r, r˙) with p = ∂L
∂r˙ , (12.25)
where the conjugate momentum is
p = mr˙ + q
c
A , (12.26)
and p differs from the mechanical momentum mr˙, associated with the velocity of the particle.
Substituting r˙ by [p − (q/c)A]/m, we easily find
H = 1

Hamilton’s equations then leads to the equation of motion given in (12.23) (see Problem 5).
The transition to quantum mechanics is effected by interpreting r and p (the momentum conjugate
to r) as (hermitian) operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations [ ˆri , ˆpj ] = i δij. The
generally time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian for a charged particle then reads

This Hamiltonian governs the interactions of an atom with the EM field. We will see later how from
it we can calculate, for example, the probabilities for photon absorption or emission in transitions
between different atomic states. In the coordinate representation, the Schrodinger equation follows as ¨

and we face the problem of gauge invariance. Under a gauge transformation A −→ A = A + ∇Λ and
U −→ U = U−∂Λ/(c ∂t) the physics cannot change, since the E and B fields (the physical fields) are
left invariant under such a transformation. Therefore, the wave function must also change in order to
leave the Schrodinger equation invariant in form; indeed, as shown i ¨ n Problem 6, we must have
Ψ(r, t) −→ Ψ
(r, t) = eiqΛ(r,t)/(c) Ψ(r, t) . (12.30)
Thus Ψ and Ψ differ only by a phase factor (recall that Λ must be real since E and B, and hence A
and U, are real), and consequently represent the same physical state. Note that the phase factor is not
a global one but, rather, depends on r and t.

A vector potential associated with this magnetic field is given by
A(r) = 1
2
B × r , (12.31)
with ∇ × A = B.
1 Ignoring the spin degrees of freedom for the time being, the quantum Hamiltonian
relative to the orbital degrees of freedom (denoted by a the subscript o) reads in this case
Hˆo = 1
2m

pˆ · Aˆ (rˆ) + Aˆ (rˆ) · pˆ

+ q2
2mc2 Aˆ 2 (rˆ) . (12.32)
The term in square brackets on the right-hand side can be simplified by noting that
[··· ] =

i

pˆi Aˆi+Aˆi pˆi
 =

i
  pˆi , Aˆi

−i ∂iAˆ
i+2 Aˆi pˆi
 = −i∇·Aˆ +2 Aˆ ·pˆ = 2 Aˆ ·pˆ ,
(12.33)
since the vector potential of Eq. (12.31) has vanishing divergence. The Hamiltonian Ho is then
written as
Hˆo = pˆ 2
2m − q
2mc
(B × rˆ) · pˆ + q2
8mc2 (B × rˆ)
2 = pˆ 2
2m − q
2mc
B · Lˆ + q2
8mc2 B2 rˆ
2
⊥ , (12.34)
where rˆ⊥ is the position operator of the particle in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. The
second term represents the interaction −B · μˆ o of a magnetic dipole with a magnetic field, where the
magnetic moment operator associated with the orbital motion of the particle is given (as in classical
electrodynamics) by
μˆ o = q
2mc
Lˆ . (12.35)
In fact, experiments indicate that a charged particle with spin has, in addition to μˆ o, a magnetic dipole
operator associated with the spin angular momentum. Consequently, the Hamiltonian describing such
a system must include the interaction of the spin magnetic dipole with the B field,
Hˆ = Hˆo − μˆ s · B , (12.36)
1 Of course, because of gauge freedom the vector potential is not unique; for example, taking B= Bzˆ, an equally valid
choice for the vector potential is A = (0, xB, 0), since ∇ × A = B zˆ. This vector potential and that given in Eq. (12.31)
as A = (−yB/2, xB/2, 0) differ by the gradient of a scalar function Λ, with Λ = xyB/2 and A = A + ∇Λ.

where μˆ s is given by
μˆ s = g
q
2mc
Sˆ . (12.37)
Here, m is the particle mass and g is known as the gyromagnetic factor. The (non-dimensional)
g-value depends on the particle: for an electron qe = −e and ge = 2 × (1.001159652 ...) while for
a proton qp = e and gp = 2 × (2.792847 ...). Interestingly, even though the neutron is neutral and
therefore has no orbital magnetic moment, it has nevertheless a spin magnetic moment, written as
[gne/(2mpc)] Sˆ, where gn = 2 × (−1.913043 ...) and mp is the proton mass. The fact that both the
proton and neutron have a quark substructure is the cause of the deviation of the gyromagnetic factor
from the value 2 predicted by the Dirac equation for a structureless spin-1/2 particle, such as the
electron (this is up to radiative corrections from quantum electrodynamics, the quantum theory of
the EM field; for the electron, the leading radiative correction is given by α/(2π) with α being the
fine structure constant). Since mp/me ≈ 1836, in atoms and molecules, effects associated with the
proton and/or neutron magnetic moment (∝ 1/mp) are much smaller than those due to the electron
magnetic moment (∝ 1/me).

Problem 3 The Lorentz Force in Terms of Scalar and Vector Potentials

Solution
Consider, say, the x component of the term r˙ × B,
(r˙ × B)x = r˙y (∇ × A)z − r˙z(∇ × A)y = r˙y (∂xAy − ∂yAx) − r˙z(∂zAx − ∂xAz)
= r˙x∂xAx + r˙y∂xAy + r˙z∂xAz  ∂x (r˙·A)
− r˙x∂xAx − r˙y∂yAx − r˙z∂zAx ,
where in the second line we have added and subtracted the term ˙rx∂xAx. Next, we observe that if we
take the total time derivative of Ax, we have by the chain rule
dAx
dt = ∂Ax
∂t
+ r˙x ∂xAx + r˙y∂yAx + r˙z∂zAx ,
since Ax depends on the position r(t) of the particle, a function of time. Thus we find that
(r˙ × B)x = ∂x (r˙ · A) − dAx
dt +
∂Ax
∂t ,
where ∂x acts only on the r dependence contained in the vector potential. Similar relations are
obtained for the y and z components, so that

Consider an electron at a fixed position in an oscillating magnetic field
B(t) = B0 cos(ωt) zˆ ,
where B0 and ω are constants and the caret denotes a unit vector

1. At time t = 0 the electron is in the spin state with respect to the x-axis having eigenvalue /2.
Determine the spin state of the electron at later times.
2. Obtain the probability of obtaining −/2 if one measures Sx.
3. What is the minimum field B0 required to force a complete flip in Sx?
Solution
Part 1
Ignoring orbital degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian reads
H(t) = −μ · B(t) = g
e B0

Sz cos(ωt) ,
where m and −e are the mass and charge of the electron and g is its gyromagnetic factor. The time￾dependent Schrodinger equation in the spin space of the electron is ¨

where the second step gives the representation of the state |ψ(t) in the basis consisting of eigenstates

that is, an eigenstate of Sx with eigenvalue /2. It is convenient to define the angular frequency
ω0 = g
eB0
4mc ,
so that
c˙+(t) = −iω0 cos(ωt) c+(t) , ˙c−(t) = iω0 cos(ωt) c−(t) ,
which have the solutions
c±(t) = c±(0) e∓i(ω0/ω) sin(ωt) = 1
√

e∓i(ω0/ω) sin(ωt) .
The state |ψ(t) is thus uniquely determined (up to an overall phase factor, of course).

yielding
px,−(t) = sin2 [(ω0/ω) sin(ωt)] .

Problem 7 Scattering of Spin-1/2 Particle in Spin-dependent δ-Function Potential
Consider a spin-1/2 particle of mass m in one dimension subject to a spin-dependent potential

v(x) = v0 σx δ(x) , v0 > 0 .
Here σx is the Pauli matrix
σx =

.
The particle approaches the interaction region from the far left, x −→ −∞, and has energy E > 0
and spin projection +/2 in the zˆ-direction. Calculate the probability for the particle to have spin
projection −/2 relative to the zˆ-direction after it has traversed the interaction region and is at the far
right, x −→ +∞ (that is, calculate the transmission coefficient for the spin-flip transition).
Solution

There are reflected and transmitted waves with spin up as well as reflected and transmitted waves
with spin down, but only a spin-up incident wave. Since the interaction does not commute with σz
,
the spin of the particle can be flipped. This is in contrast with the situation in which the particle has
spin up or down along the xˆ-direction, in which case no spin flip can occur.
The transmission coefficient for the spin-flip transition (from up to down) is obtained from the
incident current for spin up and the transmitted current for spin down, which are respectively

The reflection coefficient for the spin-flip transition follows similarly:

whereas the transmission and reflection coefficients for the non-spin-flip case are given by

Conservation of probability requires

which is easily seen to be satisfied.

Problem 9 A Simplified Analysis of the Stern–Gerlach Experiment
In the Stern–Gerlach experiment a beam of neutral atoms is sent into a region of space where a
constant but non-uniform magnetic field B(r) is present, having the form
B(r) = B0 + B1 (r) ,
where the non-uniform term B1 (r) is much weaker than B0 = B0 zˆ. The atom enters the region where
the magnetic fields are present at time t = 0.
1. Suppose that the atom has mass M and total angular momentum J; ignore its internal structure.
The eigenvalues of J2 and Jz are, respectively, j(j+1)2 and m. Associated with the total angular
momentum is a magnetic moment operator, given by
μ = μ0
j J ,
where μ0 is a constant. Show that the expectation values of the position and momentum operators
of the atom satisfy Ehrenfest’s relations
d
dtψ(t)|r|ψ(t) = ψ(t)|p|ψ(t)
M , d
dtψ(t)|p|ψ(t) = μ0
j  ψ(t)|∇[J · B1 (r)]|ψ(t) ,
where |ψ(t) is the state of the atom at time t.
2. At time t = 0, the atom is in a state described by the following superposition of simultaneous
eigenstates of the momentum operator and Jz,
|ψ(0) =

j
m=−j

dp gm(p) |φp⊗|m ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press380 Spin; Charged Particle in an Electromagnetic Field
where gm(p) is the momentum-space wave function. Suppose the subsequent time evolution of
the state is governed by the Hamiltonian H0, where
H0 = p2
2M − μ0B0
j Jz ,
that is, the contribution from the much weaker B1 (r) field is ignored. Evaluate the expectation
values of the three components of the angular momentum, ψ(t)|Ji|ψ(t).
3. Ignoring rapidly oscillating time-dependent terms, show that
d
dtψ(t)|p|ψ(t) = μ0
j ψ(t)|Jz ∇B1,z(r)|ψ(t) .
4. Now suppose that the non-uniform field depends linearly on position, namely, the components
B1,i(r) can be expanded as
B1,i(r) =

j
bijrj .
Maxwell’s equations impose conditions on the coefficients bij. Establish the properties that the
3 × 3 matrix b must satisfy.
5. Assume that |gm(p)|
2 is negligible except when m = m∗, that is, the atom is in a state with total
angular momentum projection m∗. Show that
d2
dt2 ψ(t)|ri|ψ(t) = μ0m∗
j
bzi
M .
Since m∗ = −j, ... , j, there are 2j + 1 possible trajectories, and observation of the actual trajectory
followed by the atom determines the value of m∗.

Evaluation of the Jx and Jy expectation values proceeds similarly. We need

Part 4
Maxwell’s equations require (in the absence of time-varying electric fields)
∇ · B(r) = 0 , ∇ × B(r) = 0 .
The first condition gives

i
∂iB1,i(r) =

ijk bkj = 0 =⇒ bjk = bkj .
The first relation says that the matrix b must be traceless; the second that it must be symmetric.
Part 5
If |gm(p)|
2 is negligible for m  m∗, then
|ψ(t) ≈ 
dp gm∗ (p) e−iEm∗

and hence

j ψ(t)|Jz∂iB1,z(r)|ψ(t) = μ0

It follows that
d2
dt2 ri(t) = d

M ,
and the “trajectories” followed by the atoms depend on m∗, thus providing a means of experimental
verification for quantization of the angular momentum projection.
Problem 10 Polarizing a Beam of Spin-1/2 Particles by a Magnetic Interaction
A mono-energetic beam of neutral spin-1/2 particles is perpendicularly incident on a region where a
uniform and constant magnetic field is present. The direction of the incident beam is along the x-axis,
while the magnetic field fills the region with x > 0. The incident particles have energy E, mass m, and
magnetic moment μ = −(μ0/)S, where μ0 > 0 is a constant. Their potential energy V(x) consists of
two terms,
V(x) = θ(x)

V0 − μ · B0

,
where θ(x) is the step function: θ(x) = 1 for x > 0 and 0 otherwise. The field B0 is along the z-axis,
and is strong enough that 0 < V0 < μ0B0/2.
1. Suppose that the energy E of the incident particles is in the range
0 < E < V0 + μ0B0/2 .
Determine the eigenfunctions of these particles (of energy E in the range above) corresponding to
a positive incident momentum along the x-axis and spin either parallel or antiparallel to the z-axis.
In particular, calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients for these two cases.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press383 12.4 Problems
2. Assume the incident beam is unpolarized, that is, it consists of N/2 particles with spin up, and
N/2 particles with spin down, along the z-axis. Denote by N+ and N− the numbers of reflected
particles with spin up and spin down (along the z-axis), respectively. Calculate the polarization of
the reflected beam, defined as
P = N+ − N−
N+ + N−

Observing that

we find, for the ± components,
ψ
± (x) + [ − θ(x)(v0 ± w0)]ψ±(x) = 0 ,
where we define
 = 2mE
2 , v0 = 2mV0
2 w0 = mμ0B0
2 .
In the region x < 0 we have a free-particle solution,
ψ±(x) = A± eikx + B± e−ikx k = √
 ,
while in the region x > 0 we have, for the + component,
ψ+(x) = C+e−κ+x , κ+ = √
v0 + w0 −  ,
and for the − component
ψ−(x) = C−eik−x , k− = √
 − v0 + w0 .
Imposing the boundary conditions at the origin yields the relations
A+ + B+ = C+ , A+ − B+ = i
κ+
k C+
and
A− + B− = C− , A− − B− = k−
k C− ,
which we can solve in terms of the incoming wave coefficients A± to find
B+ = 1 − iκ+/k

1 + iκ+/k A+
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press384 Spin; Charged Particle in an Electromagnetic Field
and
B− = 1 − k−/k
1 + k−/k A− , C− = 2
1 + k−/k A− .
We obtain for the transmission coefficients

(k + k−)2
and similarly for the reflection coefficients,
R+ = 1 , R− = (k − k−)2
(k + k−)2 .
Part 2
The incident beam is unpolarized and can be thought of as consisting of N/2 particles having spin up
and N/2 particles with spin down. The probabilities that a reflected particle has spin up or spin down
are, respectively, R+ = 1 and R−. The fractions of reflected particles with spin up and with spin down
are therefore
N+ = R+
N
2 = N
2 , N− = R−
N
2 ,
and the polarization of the reflected beam is then given by
P = N+ − N−
N+ + N−
= 1 − R−
1 + R−

Problem 11 Time Evolution of a Spin-1 State in a Time-Dependent Magnetic Field
Consider a spin-1 particle with magnetic moment μ = −(μ0/) S, where μ0 is a constant (ignore the
orbital degrees of freedom). The particle is subject to the action of a time-dependent magnetic field
given by B(t) = B(t) zˆ, where B(t) is an assigned function of time. Denote as |m, with m = ±1, 0, the
eigenstates of S2 and Sz with eigenvalues 22 and m, respectively.
1. Consider the state

and show that the time-dependent coefficients satisfy the equation
ic˙m(t) = mμ0B(t)cm(t) .
Solve the equation above, expressing your solution in terms of an integral over time of B(t).
2. Construct the states | ±1x with polarizations ±1 along the x-axis as linear combinations of the
eigenstates |m defined above.
3. Suppose that at time t = 0 the particle is in the state |+1x. Calculate the probability that at time t
the spin-flip transition |+1x −→ |−1x will occur.

Problem 12 Neutron Interferometry and 4π Rotations of Spinor Wave Functions
Consider an experiment in which a neutron interferometer is arranged so that one of the paths
(path A) available to the neutrons passes through a magnetic field B, while the other (path B) goes
through a magnetic-field-free region.
3 The length of the region where the magnetic field is present
is L. The magnetic field is uniform in this region and directed along the z-axis. The neutron is an
electrically neutral spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment μ = −(μ0/) S, where μ0 is written as
|gn | e/(2mpc) where gn ≈ −1.913 and mp are, respectively, the gyromagnetic factor and proton mass;
the combination e/(2mpc) is known as the nuclear magneton. The neutrons at the source have spin
projection + /2 along the z-axis (so, the beam is polarized), and are approximately mono-energetic
with a very narrow spread in energy about the central value E = p2/(2mn), mn being the neutron mass.
1. Denote with φA(r, t) and φB(r, t) the orbital parts of the neutron spinor wave functions ψA(r, t)
and ψB(r, t) for neutrons moving along paths A and B, respectively. Justify why φA(r, t) and
φB(r, t) are free-particle wave packets. Then, obtain the spinor wave functions ψA(r, t) and
ψB(r, t) by assuming that it takes a time interval τ for a neutron along path A to traverse the
region where the magnetic field is present.
2. Assuming that the free-particle wave packets φA(r, t) and φB(r, t) differ by a phase factor, namely
φA(r, t) = eiα φB(r, t) ,
determine under what condition the counting rate in the interference region is largest. Show that
the difference in magnetic fields that produces two successive maxima in the counting rates can
be written as
ΔB = 8πc
|gn |eλ∗L , λ∗ = λ
2π ,
where λ is the de Broglie wavelength of the neutron with momentum p and energy E = p2/(2mn)
(ignore the neutron–proton mass difference).
3 This experiment was actually carried out by Werner et al. (1975), Phys. Rev. Lett. 35, 1053, using a beam of thermal
neutrons.

Fig. 12.1 Schematics of the neutron interferometry experiment.
Solution
Part 1
The neutron along path B is free and is described by the spinor wave function
ψB(r, t) = φB(r, t)|+ ,
where |+ is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +/2 and the orbital part can be represented by
the free-particle wave packet φB(r, t). By contrast, the neutron along path A interacts, via its spin
magnetic moment, with the magnetic field when traversing the region of length L. After it has exited
this region, its spinor wave function reads
ψA(r, t) = φA(r, t) e−iμ0Bτ/(2) |+ ,
given that the interaction H = −μ · B= μ0BSz/ acts only on the spin degrees of freedom for a time
interval τ, and
e−iHτ/ |+ = e−iμ0Bτ/(2) |+ .
Here, φA(r, t) is also a free-particle wave packet (the neutron has no electric charge and its orbital
motion is unaffected by the magnetic field); however, it can differ from φB(r, t) by a phase factor as
follows:
φA(r, t) = eiα φB(r, t) .
Part 2
In the interference region, the amplitude is given by ψA(r, t) + ψB(r, t), and the counting rate is
therefore proportional to
counting rate ∝ |ψA(r, t) + ψB(r, t)|
2 = |φB(r, t)|

.
The counting rate is largest when

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press388 Spin; Charged Particle in an Electromagnetic Field
Let B0 and B1 be the magnetic fields producing successive maxima, corresponding to n0 and n0 + 1,
that is
B0 = 2
μ0τ
(α − 2n0π) , B1 = 2
μ0τ
[α − 2(n0 + 1)π] .
The difference in magnetic fields is then obtained as
ΔB = B0 − B1 = 4π
μ0τ .
Assuming that the neutron beam at the source is approximately mono-energetic and of energy E, we
have τ = L/(p/mn), where mn is the neutron mass and p = h/λ (λ is the de Broglie wavelength) is the
momentum corresponding to E = p2/(2mn). Inserting the expression for μ0 and ignoring the small
neutron–proton mass difference leads to
ΔB = 8πc
|gn | eλ∗L , λ∗ = λ
2π .
A comment is in order here. The time evolution operator for a spin in a time-independent magnetic
field is formally identical to the rotation operator, in the sense that
e−iHτ/ = e−i(μ0/)Bnˆ ·Sτ/ = UR(ϕ nˆ) , UR(ϕ nˆ) = e−iϕnˆ ·S/ with ϕ = μ0Bτ
 ,
where the unit vector nˆ specifies the direction of the magnetic field. For integer spins (or, in general,
integer angular momenta), we have, as expected, UR(2π nˆ) = 1. By contrast, semi-integer spins (or,
generally, semi-integer angular momenta) have the property that UR(2π nˆ) = −1; it is only for ϕ = 4π
that the rotation operator reduces to the identity. This fact is reflected in the value of ΔB obtained
above. If semi-integer spins were left invariant under a rotation of 2π (rather than 4π) then ΔB would
have been one-half of this value. Experiments utilizing neutron beams have verified that the correct
ΔB is indeed 4π/(μ0τ).

where in the last step we have made use of the identity ˆa aˆ
† = aˆ
† aˆ + 1, which follows from the
commutator of ˆa and ˆa†. Inserting the expression for α, we finally obtain for the Hamiltonian
Hˆ = qB

Since ˆa and ˆa† satisfy the same commutation relations as in the harmonic oscillator problem, the

where the ground state |0 has the property that it is annihilated by the action of ˆa, that is, ˆa |0 = 0.
Note that, even though the Hamiltonian looks the same as that for a one-dimensional harmonic
oscillator, this is not a one-dimensional problem. Indeed, the energy eigenvalues are infinitely
degenerate (rather than being non-degenerate as in case of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator).

Problem 15 Ahronov–Bohm Effect for Charged Spinless Particle Confined in Cylindrical Shell
Consider a particle of mass m and charge q confined in a hollow cylindrical shell whose axis coincides
with the z-axis. The wave function is required to vanish on the inner and outer walls, with radii,
respectively, a and b (0 < a < b), and also at the bottom and top surfaces, located at z = 0 and z = L.
In the inner cylindrical region with 0 < ρ < a there is a uniform and constant magnetic field B= B zˆ;
you may assume that this field is produced by a very long (L 
 0) solenoid whose axis coincides
with the z-axis and which is enclosed by the inner cylindrical surface.
1. Obtain the vector potential A in the regions 0 < ρ < a and ρ > a.
2. Obtain the eigenenergies of the particle; note that they depend on the magnetic field even though
the particle is confined in a region where there is no magnetic field (but there is a vector potential!).
3. Suppose the flux of the magnetic field is quantized,
πa2

What then happens to the eigenenergies?

namely, the flux of B through the surface S equals the line integral of A along the curve C
enclosing the surface; here, nˆ is perpendicular to the surface, and the curve C is traversed either
counterclockwise or clockwise as specified by the right-hand rule relative to nˆ. If S is a disk parallel
to the xy-plane (that is, perpendicular to the axis of the solenoid), we find that the flux of B is given by

where γmn are the solutions of the eigenvalue equation with m = 1, 2, ... for fixed μn. It is important
to note that these energies depend on the magnetic field through the order μn of the Bessel functions
and hence the roots γmn. Therefore, even though in the region of space in which the particle is
confined there is no magnetic field, nevertheless the energy eigenvalues do depend on the field in
an adjacent region (this is just one version of the Aharonov–Bohm effect); this is so because the
conjugate momentum of a particle in an EM field is not simply the kinetic momentum mr˙ but also
includes a dependence on the vector potential.
Part 3
If the flux of the magnetic field through the surface is quantized then the parameter η defined above
is simply an integer, that is,
η = πa2

2πc = l .
In such a case, the transcendental equation determining the solution for γ is given by
Jn−l(γa) Nn−l(γb) − Jn−l(γb) Nn−l(γa) = 0 ,
which can be seen to be the same as that obtained for the case in which there is no magnetic field,
after making the replacement n − l −→ n. We see that eigenstates with quantum numbers m, n, p with
no B-field and m, n + l, p in the presence of the B-field have the same energies.
Problem 16 Electron in a Uniform Magnetic Field
Consider an electron (charge −e, mass m, and spin S) in a uniform magnetic field B.
1. Write down the Hamiltonian including the magnetic interaction of the spin with the magnetic
field (here, the electron gyromagnetic factor is taken as ge ≈ 2). Show, in particular, that H can

2. Take A =B × r/2 as the vector potential, with B along the z-axis, and show that the orbital part
of the Hamiltonian consists of two commuting terms, which we denote as H⊥ and H (here, the
symbols ⊥ and  mean perpendicular and parallel to B, respectively).

by a suitable definition of the operators Q and P, with [ Q , P ] = i. Introduce the annihilation
and creation operators a and a† and obtain the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of H⊥.
4. Show that H⊥ commutes with the component of the orbital angular momentum along the z-axis,
denoted as Lz, and that Lz satisfies the commutation relation [Lz , a† n] = n a† n.

5. Obtain the H⊥ ground-state wave function in plane polar coordinates by utilizing the relation
a|0⊥ = 0 (see Problem 14), and show that it is also an eigenstate of Lz, with eigenvalues −k
where k is equal to 0 or a positive integer.
6. Using the results of parts 4 and 5, show that the states |n⊥, k are eigenstates of Lz with
eigenvalues −(k − n⊥). Further, by examining the behavior of the associated wave functions
ψn⊥,k (ρ, φ) near the origin, show that k ≥ n⊥ must hold.
7. Obtain the eigenvalues of H and write down the common eigenstates of H⊥, H , and Lz.
8. Show that the spin magnetic interaction HS can be written as
HS = ω
	
b† b − 1

with b = 1

(Sy + i Sx) ,
and that b and b† satisfy the anticommutation relation { b , b† } = 1 and the properties b2 =0= b† 2.
Show, further, that the number operator NS = b† b has eigenvalues 0 or 1 and that the normalized
eigenstate |0 corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is such that b |0 = 0 and the normalized eigenstate
|1 corresponding to eigenvalue 1 is given by b† |0.
9. Define the operator R =
√
ω a b† (here, a is the annihilation operator defined earlier) and show
that R satisfies the anticommutation relation
{R , R†} = H⊥ + HS .
10. The eigenstates of H⊥ +HS are the same as those of the number operators N⊥ = a† a and NS = b† b.
We write these eigenstates as |n⊥, nS = |n⊥⊗|nS, where nS = 0 or 1. Show that R and R†
commute with H⊥ + HS and that, as a consequence, the eigenstates |n⊥, 0 and |n⊥ −1, 1 are
degenerate in energy.

The operators a and a† satisfy the usual commutation relations

eigenstates are
En⊥ = ω(n⊥ + 1/2) , |n⊥ = a† n⊥

It is clear that these eigenvalues must be degenerate, since the dimensionality of the original
Hamiltonian is 2.

HO = p2
2m

Lz +

which makes it plain that Lz commutes with HO (and, of course, it commutes with HS too). This
result also follows by noting that the components of L (the generators of rotations) commute with
the scalar operator v2 and hence with HO.
Since v is a vector operator, we obtain that
[ Lz , vj ] = i

the last relation following from − a† = [ Lz , a ]

[ Lz , a† n ] =  a† n ,

Problem 17 Spin Precession in a Magnetic Field
Consider a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment g[q/(2mc)] Sˆ (g is the gyromagnetic factor) in a
uniform and constant magnetic field B directed along the positive z-axis. Ignore orbital degrees of
freedom. Suppose the particle at time t = 0 is polarized along the positive x-axis (that is, it is in state
|+x, an eigenstate of Sˆ
x). Obtain the state at time t and calculate the expectation values of Sˆ
x and Sˆ
y
at this time. Interpret the results.
Solution
Neglecting the motion of the particle in orbital space, the Hamiltonian simply reads
Hˆ = −g

Sˆ
z ,
with eigenstates and eigenvalues given by
Hˆ|± = ±
ω
2 |± , ω = −g

where |± are the eigenstates of Sˆ
z with eigenvalues ±/2, respectively. At time t = 0 the particle is in
the eigenstate of Sˆ
x corresponding to the eigenvalue +/2,
|ψ(0) = |+x = 1
√

and hence at time t the state is given by
|ψ(t) = e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) = 1

Up to an irrelevant phase factor, the state |ψ(t) can also be written as
|ψ(t) = 1
√

|+ + eiωt |−
.
Recalling that the eigenstates of Sˆ

y are given by
|±x = 1
√
2
(|+ ± |−) , |±y = 1
√
2
(|+ ± i |−) ,
we see that, as time progresses, the state |ψ(t) “rotates” (that is, precesses) in the xy-plane with
period 2π/ω; for example, at times tk = k π/(2 ω) we have
|ψ(t1) = |+y , |ψ(t2) = |−x , |ψ(t3) = |−y |ψ(t4) = |+x .

Note that our definition of the angular frequency is such that ω is either positive or negative
depending on whether the charge q is either negative or positive. When ω > 0 the precession of
the state about B is anticlockwise, while it is clockwise when ω < 0. The expectation values of Sˆ
x

y on the state |ψ(t) are obtained as

respectively, −/2 and /2, since at t2 (t4) the particle is in the eigenstate |−x ( |+x) of Sˆ
x. Similarly,
we find Sˆ
y (t) = (/2) sin(ωt) and Sˆ
z(t) = 0. We could have anticipated the last result: since Sˆ
z
commutes with the Hamiltonian, its expectation value is a constant of motion. It vanishes at t = 0,
and hence will vanish at any other time.
Problem 18 Spin Precession in a Magnetic Field: Alternative Treatment
Consider a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment g[q/(2mc)] Sˆ (g is the gyromagnetic factor) in a
uniform and constant magnetic field B. Ignore orbital degrees of freedom. Obtain an equation for the
time evolution of the expectation value of Sˆ at time time t. Assuming that the magnetic field is along
the z-axis and that the particle is polarized along the positive x-axis at time t = 0, solve explicitly the
equation for Sˆ(t) (see also Problem 17).

namely a set of first-order coupled differential equations. In order to solve them, we introduce the
auxiliary function ξ(t) = Sˆ
x (t) + iSˆ
y (t), which has real and imaginary parts given by
Re[ξ(t)] = Sˆ
x (t) , Im[ξ(t)] = Sˆ

and satisfies
ξ˙(t) = iω ξ(t) =⇒ ξ(t) = ξ(0) eiωt .
Since at t = 0 the expectation values are Sˆ
x (0) = /2 and Sˆ
y (0) = 0 given the initial state |ψ(0) =

ξ(t) =

The precessional effect just discussed is used to determine precisely the magnetic moment of the
muon μ− (one of the lepton family, a heavier version of the electron e−). The muon is unstable, and
decays via the weak interaction according to μ− −→ e− νe νμ, where νe and νμ are respectively the
electron anti-neutrino and muon neutrino. This decay has the interesting property that the electron
tends to come off, in the center of mass frame where the initial μ− is at rest, in the direction opposite
to the spin of the muon. One can measure the magnetic moment of the μ− by preparing a beam of
muons polarized in the direction opposite to their direction of motion, which is along the xˆ-axis,
say. This beam is then passed through a uniform magnetic field directed along the zˆ-axis for a time
t, and the direction in which the electrons come off in the xy-plane is measured (this direction is
preferentially opposite, as noted above, to that of the precessing muon spin). Taking into account
the Lorentz force, the angle with respect to the direction of motion of the muons provides a direct
measurement of the gyromagnetic factor for the muon, gμ.
Problem 19 Magnetic Resonance
Consider a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment g[q/(2mc)] Sˆ (g is the gyromagnetic factor)
in a magnetic field consisting of a constant term B0 along the zˆ-axis and weak oscillating (time￾dependent) term B1 (t) along the xˆ-axis, namely
B(t) = B0 zˆ + B1 cos(ωt) xˆ .
Assume B0

Neglecting rapidly oscillating transients, solve explicitly for the time evolution of the spin state |ψ(t)
(ignore orbital degrees of freedom). Next, suppose that at time t = 0 the particle is polarized along
the positive z-axis, that is, it is in the state |+. Calculate the probability for the spin-flip transition
|+ −→ |− at time t, and show that it can be expressed as

the dot symbol indicates the time derivative. Since we have assumed B0 
 B1, we have |ω0 |
|ω1 |
(the sign of these angular frequencies depends on the sign of the charge). As a consequence, the “fast”
time dependence is determined by ω0. For this reason it is convenient to extract this dependence by
defining
	
ψ+(t)
ψ−(t)

e−iω0t φ+(t)

Note that, if the weak time-dependent field were to be absent (ω1 = 0), then the state

,
would satisfy the Schrodinger equation with (the time-independent) ¨ Hˆ0. The (generally complex)
constants φ± would specify the components of the initial state |ψ(0) in the basis |±.
Substituting the above ansatz into the Schrodinger equation gives ¨
	
iφ˙+(t) e−iω0t + ω0φ+(t) e−iω0t
iφ˙−(t) e+iω0t − ω0φ−(t) e+iω0t

this equation is equivalent to the initial Schrodinger equation (no approximations have been made up ¨
until this point). However, we are interested in solutions of this equation for driving frequencies ω

in the oscillating magnetic field which are close to 2ω0. This allows us to introduce approximations.
Consider the factor

e2iω0t = 1


.
When ω is approximately equal to 2ω0, the term ei(2ω0−ω)t will vary slowly with time, while ei(2ω0+ω)t
will oscillate rapidly with time. If the solution is to be averaged over some time interval where the
second term is varying rapidly, its contribution will tend to average to zero. By contrast, the slowly
varying term will not be noticeably changed by the averaging. As a result we can make the “rotating￾field approximation”
cos(ωt) e2iω0t ≈ 1
2 ei(2ω0−ω)t , cos(ωt) e−2iω0t ≈ 1
2 e−i(2ω0−ω)t .
With these approximations the time-dependent Schrodinger equation reduces to the following pair of ¨
coupled first-order differential equations:
φ˙+(t) = − i
2 ω1 ei(2ω0−ω)t φ−(t) , φ˙−(t) = − i
2 ω1 e−i(2ω0−ω)t φ+(t) .
These equations can be decoupled by taking the time derivative of, for example, the first equation to
obtain
φ¨+(t) = 1
2 ω1 (2ω0 − ω) ei(2ω0−ω)t φ−(t) − i
2 ω1 ei(2ω0−ω)t φ˙−(t) .
By re-expressing the term with φ−(t) via
φ−(t) = i
2
ω1
e−i(2ω0−ω)t φ˙+(t) ,
and the term with φ˙−(t) via the second equation above, we find
φ¨+(t) = i(2ω0 − ω) φ˙+(t) − ω2

namely a second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve it, assume a solution

In this section, we consider the problem of combining two angular momenta, for example the orbital
angular momentum and spin of a particle or the spins (or orbital angular momenta) of two particles.

as is the case for the orbital angular momentum and spin of a particle or the the spins of two particles.
The eigenstates and eigenvalues of each of these angular momenta are assumed to be known,

2z |ψj2m2  = m2 |ψj2m2  , (13.3)
where j1 and j2 are either integers or semi-integers, −j1 ≤ m1 ≤ j1, and −j2 ≤ m2 ≤ j2. The set of
commuting operators Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2

|ψj1j2

For fixed j1 and j2, there are (2 j1 + 1)(2 j2 + 1) of these eigenstates. Next, we define the operator
Jˆ = Jˆ1 + Jˆ2 , (13.5)

The operators Jˆ2

j is either an integer or a semi-integer with −j ≤ m ≤ j. We ask: given j1 and j2, what are the
allowed j-values? How are the eigenstates |ψj1j2

m1m2  (and vice versa)?
We address these questions in the next two sections.

13.1 Eigenvalues of the Total Angular MomentumJˆ2
Below we establish that, for given j1 and j2, the allowed j-values are
j = |j1 − j2 |, |j1 − j2 | + 1, ... , j1 + j2 , (13.9)
so that j runs from a minimum value of |j1 −j2 | to a maximum value of j1 +j2 in steps of one unit; for
example, adding together an orbital angular momentum l = 1 and a spin s = 1/2, the allowed values
for j are 1/2 and 3/2. To see how this comes about, we note the following.
• There are two “special” eigenstates of the set Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2
2, Jˆ
1z, and Jˆ
2z; these also happen to be eigenstates
of the set Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2
2, Jˆ2, and Jˆ
z:
|ψj1j2
j1j2
 = |ψj1j1 ⊗|ψj2j2  , |ψj1j2
−j1−j2
 = |ψj1−j1 ⊗|ψj2−j2  , (13.10)
where m1 and m2 assume their maximum values j1 and j2, or minimum values −j1 and −j2,
respectively. It is easily seen that these are also eigenstates of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z (they are obviously
eigenstates of Jˆ2
1 and Jˆ2
2); indeed,
Jˆ
z |ψj1j2
j1j2

Jˆ
1z + Jˆ
2z

|ψj1j1 ⊗|ψj2j2  = (j1 + j2) |ψj1j1 ⊗|ψj2j2  , (13.11)
and so the eigenvalue of Jˆ
z is (j1 + j2). We find similarly that |ψj1j2
−j1−j2
 is an eigenstate of Jˆ
z
with eigenvalue −(j1 + j2). From the known properties of the spectrum of an angular momentum
operator, we expect that both these states are eigenstates of Jˆ2 with eigenvalue (j1+j2)(j1+j2+1)2.
We verify this fact explicitly:

A similar reasoning, but using
Jˆ

shows that |ψj1j2

conclude that j

There is a total 2 j

1 and Jˆ2
2, each is also an
eigenstate of these operators, with eigenvalues, respectively, j1 (j1 +1)2 and j2 (j2 +1)2. We could

orthogonal to that of Eq. (13.20) (another choice of phase has been made). It is clear that it is an
eigenstate of Jˆ
z with eigenvalue (j
∗ − 1) as well as an eigenstate of Jˆ2
1 and Jˆ2
2 with eigenvalues,
respectively j1 (j1 + 1)2 and j2 (j2 + 1)2. It is straightforward to verify that it is also an eigenstate
of Jˆ2 with eigenvalues j
∗ (j
∗ − 1)2, by expressing Jˆ2 as in Eq. (13.12).

∗ (j

of Jˆ2 (these form, the multiplet corresponding to j = j
∗ − 1).
• Consider the two eigenstates of Jˆ
z with eigenvalue (j
∗ − 2) belonging to the multiplets of Jˆ2
corresponding to j = j
∗ and j = j
∗ − 1. They are easily seen to be (orthogonal) linear combinations
of the three states |ψj1,j1−2⊗|ψj2,j2 , |ψj1,j1−1⊗|ψj2,j2−1, and |ψj1,j1 ⊗|ψj2,j2−2. Out of these three
states, we can construct a third linear combination orthogonal to the previous two (and yet another
phase choice is made). Then by applying Jˆ
z and Jˆ2 to it, we verify that it is an eigenstate of these
operators with eigenvalues, respectively, (j
∗ −2) and (j
∗ −1)(j
∗ −2)2, corresponding to j(j+1)2
with j = j
∗ − 2. By repeated application of Jˆ
− we generate all remaining eigenstates in the multiplet
having j = j
∗ − 2.
• It should now be clear that the procedure can be iterated to generate the multiplets of Jˆ2 having
j = j
∗ − 3, j
∗ − 4, ... ; clearly, however, the sequence of multiplets has to terminate at some point,
for two reasons. First, since the operator Jˆ is an angular momentum, the eigenvalues of Jˆ2 are
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press414 Addition of Angular Momenta
j(j+1)2 with j ≥ 0. Second, as we have already noted, for fixed j1 and j2 the total number of states
is (2j1 + 1)(2j2 + 1). This number must be preserved in going from the eigenstates of the set Jˆ2
1,
Jˆ2
2, Jˆ
1z, and Jˆ
2z to those of the set Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2
2, Jˆ2, and Jˆ
z. Indeed, this fact allows us to determine that the
minimum value of j is |j1 − j2 |; see Problem 1
To summarize, we have outlined a procedure to construct the simultaneous eigenstates of the set
Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2
2, Jˆ2, and Jˆ
z. For given j1 and j2, we have determined that the allowed j-values range from
|j1 − j2 | to j1 + j2 in steps of one unit. The eigenvalues of Jˆ2 are j(j + 1)2 and those of Jˆ
z are m
with m = −j, ... , j, namely, there are 2j + 1 values. In the process, we have also determined, in the
subspace with fixed j1 and j2, the coefficients of the transformation that maps the basis consisting of
eigenstates |ψj1j2
m1m2  of Jˆ2
1, Jˆ
1z, Jˆ2
2, and Jˆ
2z into the basis of eigenstates |ψj1j2
jm  of Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2
2, Jˆ2, and Jˆ
z. We
now turn our attention to discuss a few properties of these coefficients, known as Clebsch–Gordan
coefficients.
13.2 Clebsch–Gordan Coefficients
In the subspace with fixed j1 and j2, we have established that the states in the two bases are related
via
|ψj1j2
jm  =

m1m2
Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) |ψj1j2
m1m2  , Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) = ψj1j2
m1m2 |ψj1j2
jm  , (13.23)
and the procedure we outlined in the previous section, concurrently with the phase choices we made,
shows that the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) are all real,1
Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) = C∗
j1j2 (m1m2; jm) =⇒ ψj1j2
m1m2 |ψj1j2
jm  = ψj1j2
jm |ψj1j2
m1m2  . (13.24)
Of course, they are non-vanishing only if j = |j1 − j2 |, |j1 − j2 | + 1, ... , j1 + j2 and m = m1 + m2, as is
apparent from the explicit construction of the previous section. The last requirement also follows by
considering that, since Jˆ
z = Jˆ
1z + Jˆ
2z, we have
m |ψj1j2
jm  = Jˆ
z |ψj1j2
jm  =

m1m2
Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm)

Jˆ
1z + Jˆ
2z

|ψj1j2
m1m2 
= 

m1m2
(m1 + m2)Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) |ψj1j2
m1m2  , (13.25)
which can be written as

m1m2

m − (m1 + m2)

Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) |ψj1j2
m1m2  = 0 , (13.26)
yielding
Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) = 0 if m  m1 + m2 . (13.27)
The orthonormality and completeness (in the subspace with fixed j1 and j2) of the states |ψj1j2
jm  has
two important implications for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients:
1 Several different notations are used for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. Apart from that adopted above, other common
notations are j1m1, j2m2 |j1j2jm and Cj1j2j m1m2m. More importantly, different authors may use different phase choices.

The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients also satisfy a number of “symmetry” properties. As an illustra￾tion, we show below that
Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) = (−1)
j1+j2−j
Cj2j1 (m2m1; jm) , (13.31)
that is, under the exchange j1m1  j2m2 the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is either even or odd
depending on whether j1 + j2 − j is even or odd. To see how this comes about, we note that the
states |ψj1j2
jm  and |ψj2j1
jm  can differ only by a phase factor, since they are (normalized) eigenstates of
the complete set of commuting observables Jˆ2
1, Jˆ2
2, Jˆ2, and Jˆ
z, corresponding to the same eigenvalues
of these observables. Under the exchange j1m1  j2m2, we have |ψj1j2
jm  −→ eiφ |ψj2j1
jm ; exchanging
j1m1  j2m2 twice, we then arrive at |ψj1j2
jm  −→ eiφ |ψj2j1
jm  −→ e2iφ |ψj1j2
jm , which implies e2iφ = 1 or
φ = 0 or φ = π. Thus, this phase factor is ±1. It cannot depend on m, since states with different m are
related to each other by application of the raising or lowering operators Jˆ
± = Jˆ
1± + Jˆ
2±, which are
symmetric under the exchange 1  2. We conclude that these states all have phases +1 or all have
phases −1,
|ψj1j2
jm  = (±1)j1j2j |ψj2j1
jm  , (13.32)
where (±1)j1j2j indicates that the sign depends only on the j1-, j2-, and j-values. This in turn leads to
Cj2j1
(m2m1; jm) = (±1)j1j2j Cj1j2 (m1m2; jm) . (13.33)
From Eq. (13.10) we see that the state with maximum m = j = j1 + j2 is given by
|ψj1j2
j1+j2,j1+j2
 = |ψj1j1 ⊗|ψj2j2  =⇒ Cj1j2 ( j1 j2

m1m2
; j1 + j2

j
j1 + j2
 m
) = 1 , (13.34)
and so the phase is +1 in this case as it is for all other states in the multiplet having j = j1 + j2 but
different m; hence,
Cj2j1
(m2m1; j1 + j2

j
, m) = Cj1j2
(m1m2; j1 + j2

j
, m) . (13.35)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press416 Addition of Angular Momenta
Next, consider the state with m = j = j1 + j2 − 1 (the next state “down”) in Eq. (13.21),
|ψj1j2
j1+j2−1,j1+j2−1 = −

|ψj1j1−1 ⊗|ψj2j2  +

j1
j1 + j2
|ψj1j1 ⊗|ψj2j2−1 , (13.36)
which is antisymmetric under the exchange j1  j2, and hence (in order to arrive at the condition in
Eq. (13.37), denote the coefficients in the linear combination above and that obtained by exchanging
j1m1  j2m2 with the appropriate Clebsch–Gordan coefficients)
Cj2j1
(m2m1; j1 + j2 − 1  j
, m) = −Cj1j2
(m1m2; j1 + j2 − 1  j
, m) . (13.37)
The argument can be repeated for the state with m = j = j1+j2−2, then for the state with m = j = j1+j2−3,
and so on, to arrive at Eq. (13.31).
13.3 Problems
Problem 1 Determining the Minimum Value|j1 − j2 | in the Addition of Two Angular Momenta
Let j
 be the lowest non-negative integer or semi-integer obtained in the addition of two angular
momenta, following the procedure outlined in Section 13.1. Using the fact that
j
1+j2
j=j

(2j + 1) = (2j1 + 1)(2j2 + 1) ,
that is, that the number of states in the subspace (j1, j2) is independent of whether the basis |ψj1j2
m1m2 
or |ψj1j2
jm  is adopted, show that j
 = |j1 − j2 |.
Solution
Two cases can occur. The first is when j1 and j2 are both integer or both semi-integer, which implies
that j
∗ = j1 + j2 and j
 are both integer. We obtain

The other case occurs when j1 is semi-integer and j2 integer or vice versa; then j

semi-integer, and 2j

Problem 2 Angular Momentum in the Deuterium Atom
A deuterium atom consists of a deuteron nucleus – a proton and neutron bound together by the strong
interaction – and an electron. The deuteron has total angular momentum I, including the relative
orbital angular momentum between the proton and neutron and their respective spins, equal to 1,
while the total angular momentum of the electron is J = L + S, where L and S are its orbital angular
momentum and spin. The total angular momentum of the atom is F = J + I, and the components
of I commute with those of J. What are the possible values of the quantum numbers j and f for a
deuterium atom in either the 1s ground state or the 2p excited state?
Solution
In the 1s state the relative orbital angular momentum between the electron and deuteron is zero, and
hence j = 1/2 and f = 1/2 or 3/2. For the 2p excited state (having relative angular momentum quantum
number l = 1), it follows that j = 1/2 or 3/2 and f = 1/2, 3/2, or 5/2. Note that f = 1/2 or 3/2 come from
combining j = 1/2 with i = 1 and j = 3/2 with i = 1, while f = 5/2 comes only from combining j = 3/2
with i = 1.
Problem 3 Combining Angular Momenta 1 and 1/2
Consider an angular momentum j1 = 1 with eigenstates |1, |0, and | − 1, such that
J2
1 |m = 22 |m , J1,z |m = m |m , m = 0, ±1 .
Combine this angular momentum with an angular momentum j2 = 1/2 with eigenstates |+ and |−,
J2
2 |± = 3
4
2 |± , J2,z |± = ±

2 |± .
What are the possible values for the total angular momentum J = J1 + J2? Use a table of Clebsch–
Gordan coefficients to express the states in the basis consisting of eigenstates of J2
1, J2
2, J2, and Jz,
labeled simply as |jm with
J2 |jm = j(j + 1)2 |jm , Jz |jm = m |jm ,
as linear combinations of the states in the basis consisting of eigenstates of J2
1, J2
2, J1,z, and J2,z,
labeled as |m, ± with m = 0, ±1.

Solution
The possible values of the total angular momentum are j = 1/2 and 3/2. We can use the properties of
the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients to write
|ψ1,1/2
j,m  =

m1,m2
C1,1/2 (m1, m2; j, m) |ψ1,1/2
m1,m2  ,
where m1 = ±1, 0 and m2 = ±1/2. We then find, for j = 3/2,
|ψ1,1/2
3/2,3/2 = |ψ1,1/2
1,1/2 , |ψ1,1/2
3/2,1/2 =

Of course, if access to a tabulation of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients is not available, an alternative
approach is sketched in Section 13.1.
Problem 4 Combining the Spins of Three Spin-1/2 Particle
Let S = S1 + S2 + S3 be the total spin of three spin-1/2 particles (whose orbital degrees of freedom
are ignored). Let |σ1, σ2, σ3 be the eigenstates common to S1,z, S2,z, S3,z, with respective eigenvalues
(/2)σ1, (/2)σ2, (/2)σ3 and σi = ±. Give a basis of eigenstates common to S2 and Sz in terms of the
basis states |σ1, σ2, σ3. Do these two operators form a complete set of commuting observables?
Solution
We first combine the spins of particles 1 and 2 to obtain pair-12 spins 0 and 1 (of course, we could
have chosen instead pair-13 or pair-23). We have, for the pair-12 state with spin 0,
|0, 0; 12 = 1

(|+, − − |−, +) ,
and, for the pair-12 state with spin 1,
|1, 0; 12 = 1

(|+, − + |−, +) , |1, ±1; 12 = |±, ± ,
where the notation on the right-hand sides of these relations is as follows: is
|σ, σ
 = |σ; 1⊗|σ
; 2 .
Next, we combine pair-12 spin 0 with the spin of particle 3, to obtain a total spin 1/2. Using the
properties of the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients,
|ψj1,j2
j,m  =

m1,m2
Cj1,j2 (m1, m2; j, m) |ψj1,m1 ⊗|ψj2,m2  ,
with j1 = 0 and j2 = 1/2, we find
|1/2, 1/2; 12(0)3 = |0, 0; 12⊗|+; 3 , |1/2, −1/2; 12(0)3 = |0, 0; 12 ⊗ |−; 3 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press419 13.3 Problems
In a similar way, we combine pair-12 spin 1 with the spin of particle 3 to obtain the four total-spin-3/2
states:
|3/2, 3/2; 12(1)3 = |1, 1; 12⊗|+; 3 ,
|3/2, 1/2; 12(1)3 =

1
3 |1, −1; 12⊗|+; 3 ,
|3/2, −3/2; 12(1)3 = |1, −1; 12 ⊗ |−; 3 .
We combine pair-12 spin 1 with the spin of particle 3 to obtain the two total-spin-1/2 states:
|1/2, 1/2; 12(1)3 =
2
3 |1, 1; 12 ⊗ |−; 3 − 1

3 |1, 0; 12 ⊗ |−; 3 − 2
3 |1, −1; 12⊗|+; 3 .
In terms of the states |σ, σ

|3/2, −3/2; 12(1)3 = |−, −, − .
Note that the total-spin-3/2 states are symmetric under the exchange of any pair of particles, while
the total-spin-1/2 states are either symmetric or antisymmetric under the exchange of particles 1 and
2 depending on whether the pair-12 spin is either 1 or 0, respectively. The operators S2 and Sz alone
do not form a complete set of commuting observables, since specifying their eigenvalues does not
uniquely identify a single common eigenstate; in particular, there are two eigenstates corresponding
to the pair of eigenvalues s = 1/2 and sz = 1/2 (or s = 1/2 and sz = −1/2).
Problem 5 Projection Operators onto j = l ± 1/2 States
Consider a spin-1/2 particle. Show that, in the state space with given orbital angular momentum l,
the operators
P+ = l + 1 + L · σ/
2l + 1 , P− = l − L · σ/
2l + 1
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press420 Addition of Angular Momenta
are projection operators onto the states of total angular momentum j = l + 1/2 and j = l − 1/2,
respectively.
Solution
It is obvious that P± are hermitian, since the components of the orbital angular momentum and spin
commute with each other. In order to show that P2
± = P±, we first note that
σ · L σ · L = L2 + i σ · (L × L) = L2 −  σ · L ,
where we have used L × L= iL, since
(L × L)1 =

j,k
1jk LjLk = L2L3 − L3L2 = [L2 , L3] = i L1 ,
and similarly for the components 2 and 3. Considering P+ (a similar argument holds for P−), it
follows that
P2
+ = (l + 1)2 + 2(l + 1)L · σ/ + L2/2 − L · σ/
(2l + 1)2 .
In the subspace with fixed l, we have L2 −→ l(l + 1)2, so that
P2
+ = (l + 1)2 + (2l + 1)L · σ/ + l(l + 1)
(2l + 1)2 = l + 1 + L · σ/
2l + 1 = P+ .
We also observe that
P+ P− = l(l + 1) − L · σ/ − L2/2 + L · σ/
(2l + 1)2 = 0 .
Lastly, since
L · σ = 2L · S/ = [J2 − L2 − S2
]/ −→ J2
/ − [l(l + 1) + 3/4] ,
the projectors can also be written as
P+ = l + 1 + J2/2 − l(l + 1) − 3/4
2l + 1 = J2/2 − l
2 + 1/4
2l + 1
and
P− = l − J2/2 + l(l + 1) + 3/4
2l + 1 = −J2/2 + l(l + 2) + 3/4
2l + 1 .
In the subspace with j = l + 1/2, we have J2/2 −→ (l + 1/2)(l + 3/2) = l
2 + 2l + 3/4 and we see
that P+ = 1 while P− = 0. On the other hand, in the subspace with j = l − 1/2, we have J2/2 −→
(l − 1/2)(l + 1/2) = l
2 − 1/4, so that P+ = 0 and P− = 1.
Problem 6 Angular Momentum and Parity Conservation in a Two-Particle Decay
An unstable particle – the N(1520) – has spin Si equal to 3/2 and is at rest. It decays into a nucleon
(a proton or neutron) and a pion. The nucleon has spin SN equal to 1/2, while the pion is spinless.
Denote by Lf the relative orbital angular momentum between these final particles, and assume that
total angular momentum is conserved in the decay process. What are the allowed values for Lf ?
Suppose that parity is also conserved in the decay: what consequence would this fact have for the
previous question?
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press421 13.3 Problems
Assume that initially the N(1520) is at rest and in spin state |3/2, mi, an eigenstate of S2
i and Si,z,
with eigenvalues, respectively, (15/4)2 and mi, and that parity is conserved. Show that the relative
orbital angular momentum (and hence parity) can be determined by measuring the probability for the
final nucleon to be in the state |1/2, +.
Hint: The final state can be written as
|lf mf⊗|1/2, mN , mf = −lf , ... , lf and mN = ±1/2 .
Solution
The initial angular momentum ji = 3/2. The final angular momentum consists of the relative orbital
angular momentum Lf between the nucleon (N) and pion (π) and the nucleon spin SN, and therefore
jf = |lf − 1/2|, |lf + 1/2| . Since total angular momentum is conserved, the only possibilities are lf = 1
and 2. The final state is the tensor product of the eigenstate |lf , mf with L2 and Lz and the nucleon
spin state |1/2, mN, an eigenstate of S2
N and SN,z. Hence, the parity of the final state2 is (−1)lf , while
that of the initial state is +. Parity conservation requires lf = 2.
The initial state is |3/2, mi. The final state | f must have jf = 3/2 and angular momentum projection
mi, and therefore
| f =

mf ,mN
Clf 1/2 (mf , mN; 3/2, mi) |lf , mf |1/2, mN
=

mN
Clf 1/2 (mi − mN, mN; 3/2, mi) |lf , mi − mN; 1/2, mN .
The probability of finding the nucleon with spin up is
P+(lf ) =

l

f m

furthermore,

= Clf 1/2 (mi − 1/2, 1/2; 3/2, mi) δl

f ,lf δm
f ,mi−mN δmN,1/2 ,
which then yields
P+(lf ) = [Clf 1/2 (mi − 1/2, 1/2; 3/2, mi)]
2 .
The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are real. We find
P+(1) = [C1 1/2 (mi − 1/2, 1/2; 3/2, mi)]
2 = 3/2 + mi
3 ,
and
P+(2) = [C2 1/2 (mi − 1/2, 1/2; 3/2, mi)]
2 = 5/2 − mi
5 .
For any mi, P+(1)  P+(2), and so a measurement of P+(lf ) leads to a determination of lf and,
hence, of parity.
2 Here, we are ignoring the intrinsic parities of N(1520), the nucleon, and the pion, respectively, –, + and –. If we account for
these, the parity of the initial state πi = −1 and that of the final state πf = (−1)
lf +1. However, parity conservation leads to
the same conclusion as that in the main text.

Problem 7 The Addition Formula for Two Spherical Harmonics
A state |ψ is invariant under rotations if J |ψ = 0. Now, consider two angular momenta J1 and J2,
with J2
1 and J1z and J2
2 and J2z having eigenvalues j1 (j1 + 1)2 and m1, and j2 (j2 + 1)2 and m2,
respectively.
1. What condition must j1 and j2 satisfy in order for a state of total angular momentum that is
invariant under rotations to be constructed?
2. As implied by J |ψ = 0, such a state is annihilated by the operator J+ = J1+ +J2+, that is, J+ |ψ = 0.
Show that this requirement yields a relation between the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients.
3. Making use of the relation in part 2, show that the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are given by
Cjj(m, −m; 00) = (−1)j−m

2j + 1 .
4. Use the result in part 3 to obtain the formula for the addition of two spherical harmonics:
Pl(aˆ · bˆ) = 4π
2l + 1

l
m=−l
(−1)
m Yl,m(aˆ) Yl,−m(bˆ) ,
where aˆ and bˆ are two unit vectors. To this end, first note that the function
Fl(aˆ · bˆ) =

l
m=−l
(−1)l−m
√
2l + 1
Yl,m(aˆ) Yl,−m(bˆ) ,
can depend only on the quantity aˆ ·bˆ, a scalar and hence invariant under rotations. Then, by taking
aˆ = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) and bˆ = (0, 0, 1), obtain the addition formula for spherical
harmonics.
Solution
Part 1
A state that is invariant under rotation must have j = 0, that is, it must be the state |ψjm = |ψ00. This
state has the properties
J±|ψ00 = 0 and Jz|ψ00 = 0 =⇒ J|ψ00 = 0 .
Therefore a state invariant under rotations can result only from combining two angular momenta
having j1 = j2 = j.
Part 2
We have
|ψjj

Cjj(m, −m; 0, 0)|ψj,m|ψj,−m .

which implies that
Cjj(m + 1, −m − 1; 0, 0) = −Cjj(m, −m; 0, 0) ,
that is, a recurrence relation between the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients.
Part 3
The above recurrence relation can be satisfied by taking
Cjj(m, −m; 0, 0) = (−1)
j−m Nj ,
where Nj is a positive normalization constant to be determined shortly. Note that we have made the
choice of phase such that
Cjj(j, −j, ; 0, 0) > 0 ,
that is, the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient with the maximum allowed m, that is, m = j, is positive. The
normalization constant results from the orthonormality condition of the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients,

Problem 8 Positronium in a Magnetic Field
The Hamiltonian of the positronium atom (that is, the bound system made up of an electron of charge
−e and a positron, the electron’s antiparticle, of charge e) in the 1s state (that is, the state with relative

(S1z − S2z) ,
where the electron and positron are labeled, respectively, as particles 1 and 2 and each has mass m.
Using the coupled representation in which S2 = (S1 + S2)2 and Sz = S1z + S2z are diagonal, obtain the
energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors and classify them according to the quantum numbers associated

The electron and positron are spin-1/2 particles. Using the identity

Problem 9 Decay of a Spin-1/2 Particle into a Spin-0 Particle and a Spin-1/2 Particle
Consider a particle (a) of spin 1/2 (say, an N(1440) baryon) which can disintegrate into two particles,
one (b) of spin 1/2 (a nucleon, that is a proton or neutron) and the other (c) of spin 0 (a pion).
Place yourself in the rest frame of particle a. Total angular momentum is conserved during the
disintegration. Note that (i) the total angular momentum of the initial state is just Sa (the spin of
particle a), while that of the final state is L + Sb, where L is the relative angular momentum and Sb
is the spin of particle b; and (ii) the final state can be written as
|lm⊗|mb , m = −l, ... , l and mb = ±1/2 .
1. What values can be taken on by the relative orbital angular momentum of the two final particles?
Explain why there is only one possible value if the parity of the relative orbital state is fixed.
2. Assuming that the parity of the relative orbital state is not fixed, show that the spinor wave function
of the final state with total angular momentum 1/2 and projection mf = ±1/2 can be written in
momentum space as
ψ1/2mf (p)=AS Y00 (pˆ) |mf + AP

mb=±1/2
C1,1/2 (mf − mb, mb; 1/2, mf ) Y1(mf −mb) (pˆ) |mb ,
where the |p| dependence of the relative S- and P-wave amplitudes is ignored.
3. Show that the states ψ1/2,±1/2 (p) are given explicitly by the following expressions:
ψ1/2,1/2 (p) = 1
√
4π

AS |+ − AP


and
ψ1/2,−1/2 (p) = 1
√
4π

AS |− + AP

cos θ |− − sin θ e−iφ |+

,
where |± are the spin states of particle b with mb = ±1/2 and θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal
angles specifying the direction pˆ relative to the spin quantization axis, the zˆ-axis.
4. Assume that the initial particle a is in a state with spin projection along the direction
Pˆ = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) ,
that is, it is polarized along Pˆ relative to the spin quantization axis. Show that such a state can be
written as
|Pˆ = cos(θ∗
/2) |+ + sin(θ∗
/2) eiφ∗
|− ,
where |± are the spin states of particle a with ma = ±1/2.
5. Show that if the initial particle a is polarized along Pˆ then the angular distribution of the final-state
particles b and c is proportional to 1 − η Pˆ · pˆ. Determine η in terms of AS and AP.
Solution
Part 1
Since total angular momentum is conserved, the final relative orbital angular momentum l and spin
1/2 must combine to give total angular momentum 1/2. Hence, only l = 0 or 1 are possible. If it is
further assumed that the parity of the relative orbital state is fixed, then even (odd) parity implies l = 0
(1), since the parity of the orbital states |lm is (−1)l
.

=

Al

mb
Cl,1/2 (mf − mb, mb; 1/2, mf ) |l(mf − mb)⊗|mb ,
where in the second line we have enforced the condition m+mb = mf implicit in the Clebsch–Gordan
coefficients. In the basis of eigenstates |φp of the relative momentum operator p it follows that
ψ1/2,mf (p) = φp|ψ1/2,mf  = AS Y00 (pˆ) |mf+AP

mb=±1/2
C1,1/2 (mf −mb, mb; 1/2, mf ) Y1(mf −mb) (pˆ) |mb ,
since for the S-wave term the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is C0,1/2 (0, mb; 1/2, mf ) = δmb,mf .

A particle polarized along Pˆ is in an eigenstate of Pˆ · S with eigenvalue /2, or, in terms of Pauli

Problem 10 Addition of Three Angular Momenta
Let Ea, Eb, and Ec be the state spaces of three systems a, b, and c with angular momenta Ja, Jb,
and Jc (the components Jai and Jbj commute if a  b). The eigenstates of J2
a and Jaz are denoted
by |ψjama , and similarly for systems b and c. We want to add these three angular momenta to form
eigenstates of J2 and Jz – here J is the total angular momentum – corresponding to the quantum
numbers jf and mf . We denote these eigenstates as
|ψja,(jbjc )je
jf mf  ,
where jb and jc are added first to obtain je, and then ja and je are combined to give jf . Of course, we
could also add ja and jb to form jd and then jd and jc to form jf , with the corresponding eigenstates
denoted as
|ψ(jajb)jd,jc
jf mf  .
1. Express the eigenstates |ψja,(jbjc )je
jf mf  and |ψ(jajb)jd,jc
jf mf  as linear combinations of those of J2
a, Jaz, J2
b, Jbz,
and J2
c , Jcz, that is,
|ψjajbjc
mambmc  = |ψjama ⊗|ψjbmb ⊗|ψjcmc  .
2. Show that the sets of kets |ψja,(jbjc )je
jf mf  and |ψ(jajb)jd,jc
jf mf  corresponding to the various possible values
of, respectively, je, jf and jd, jf form orthonormal bases.
3. Show, by using the operators J±, that the scalar product ψ(jajb)jd,jc
jf mf |ψja,(jbjc )je
jf mf  does not depend on
mf . Hence, denote this scalar product as
ψ(jajb)jd,jc
jf |ψja,(jbjc )je
jf  .
4. Show that
|ψja,(jbjc )je
jf ,mf  =

jd
ψ(jajb)jd,jc
jf |ψja,(jbjc )je
jf  |ψ(jajb)jd,jc

6. Starting from the result in part 5, prove, using the Clebsch–Gordan orthogonality relations, that
the following identities hold:

Part 2
In the basis |ψjajbjc
mambmc  (for fixed ja, jb, jc) there are (2ja + 1)(2jb + 1)(2jc + 1) independent states. The
number of states |ψja,(jbjc )je
jf mf  is the same, since (see Problem 1 for an evaluation of these sums)
j

jf =|ja−je |
(2jf + 1) =

(2ja + 1)(2je + 1) = (2ja + 1)(2jb + 1)(2 jc + 1) .

There are only few problems for which we can determine the energy spectrum and eigenstates
exactly; a particle in a Coulomb or harmonic oscillator potential are two important examples. For
most other problems we must rely on approximation methods. In this section we introduce two of
these methods, known as time-independent perturbation theory and the variational method, primarily
for bound-state problems.
14.1 Non-Degenerate Perturbation Theory
We begin by writing the Hamiltonian as
Hˆ = Hˆ0 + Vˆ , (14.1)
where it is assumed that the eigenvalues and (normalized) eigenstates of Hˆ0 are known:
Hˆ0 |φm = m|φm . (14.2)
Some the eigenvalues of Hˆ0 may be degenerate; however, we assume that the eigenvalue n to which
we are interested in determining corrections is non-degenerate. We also assume that matrix elements
of the perturbation Vˆ are small relative to those of Hˆ0; a more precise characterization of what “small”
means in the present context is given below. We introduce a real parameter λ varying in the interval
[0,1], and define
Hˆ(λ) = Hˆ0 + λ Vˆ . (14.3)
As λ is varied between 0 and 1, the non-degenerate eigenstate |φn of Hˆ0 will smoothly become
a non-degenerate eigenstate |ψn of Hˆ and the energy n will smoothly become the energy En
corresponding to |ψn. We look for expansions of the eigenstate |ψn (λ) and eigenvalue En (λ) of
Hˆ in powers of λ (eventually, λ will be set to 1, but for now it is a convenient way to keep track of
powers of Vˆ):
|ψn (λ) = |φn + λ|ψ(1)
n  + λ2 |ψ(2)
n  + ··· (14.4)
En (λ) = n + λE(1) + λ2
E(2) + ··· . (14.5)
It is important to stress here that the existence of such expansions is a rather strong assumption.
Expanding the states in a power series implies that the physics for, say, a small positive V(r) is only
slightly different from the physics for a small negative V(r). But this is certainly not the case for a
bound state. A weak attractive potential can have a bound state, but a weak repulsive one cannot – a
433

very different situation.
1 In particular, bound states in a weak attractive potential cannot be obtained
using perturbation theory based on the free-particle Hamiltonian.
With this proviso, we return to the expansions above. The states |φn are normalized (φn |φn = 1).
However, we choose to normalize the states |ψn (λ) in such a way that
φn |ψn (λ) = 1 =⇒ λφn |ψ(1)
n  + λ2
φn |ψ(2)
n  + ··· = 0 , (14.6)
and the coefficient of each power λ must vanish,
φn |ψ(p)
n  = 0 p = 1, 2, ... (14.7)
We insert the expansions into the Schrodinger equation ¨ (Hˆ0+λ Vˆ)|ψn (λ) = En (λ)|ψn (λ) and match
the powers of λ on the left- and right-hand sides to obtain
λ0
: Hˆ0 |φn = n |φn ,

n  + Vˆ |ψ(p−1) n  = n |ψ(p)
n  + E(1)
n |ψ(p−1) n  + ··· + E(p)
n |φn .
We project onto the state |φn both sides of each of the relations above (the first one, for λ0, gives
nothing new, and so we can ignore it),

n |φn

and use the fact that |φn is an eigenstate of Hˆ0 along with the condition in Eq. (14.7),
λ1
: E(1)
n = φn |Vˆ |φn ,
λ2
: E(2)
n = φn |Vˆ |ψ(1)

n = φn |Vˆ |ψ(p−1) n  .
We see that the correction to the energy at any particular order requires knowledge of the correction
to the state at the next lower order.2 Note, however, that the procedure has provided us with the
1 As a specific example, consider a particle in one dimension under the influence of a potential V(x) = −V0 for |x| ≤ a/2 and
V(x) = 0 for |x| > a/2. For any value of V0 there is at least one bound state of energy E0 = −ma2V2
0/(22), however small
V0 is. By contrast, the potential with the sign of V0 flipped does not have any bound states. Hence, the physics for small
negative V(x) is very different from that with small positive V(x). In the former case, perturbation theory based on free
states will fail. 2 On multiplying both sides of the last equation by λp and then summing over p from 1 to ∞, we obtain

first-order correction to the energy – the first of the equations above: it is obtained as the expectation
value of the perturbation Vˆ on the unperturbed state |φn. We are left with the problem of determining
the state |ψ(p)
, representing the pth-order correction to |φn. Such a state can be expanded over the
basis of eigenstates of Hˆ0 as
|ψ(p)
n  =

mn
|φmφm|ψ(p)
n  , (14.11)
where we have omitted the term with m = n, since φn |ψ(p)

project both sides of Eq. (14.8) onto |φm:

or, letting Hˆ0 act to the left on the left-hand sides of the equations above and noting that φm|φn = 0
for m  n, we obtain

which allows us to find the pth order correction. Note that the energy denominators never vanish.
We can work out explicitly the formulae above in the special cases of the first- and second-order
corrections (by assumption, the energy n being perturbed is non-degenerate). As already noted
earlier, the first-order correction to the energy is given by
E(1)
n = φn |Vˆ |φn , (14.14)
while the first-order correction to the unperturbed state |φn reads
|ψ(1)
n  =

mn
|φmφm|ψ(1)
n  =

mn
|φm
φm|Vˆ |φn
n − m
. (14.15)
Note that |ψ(1) n  is “small” if the absolute value of the matrix element |φm|Vˆ |φn| is much less than
the smallest energy difference |n−m|; in such an instance, we can expect the expansion to converge
rapidly.
The second-order correction to the energy follows from the second of equations (14.10):
E(2)
n = φn |Vˆ |ψ(1)
n  =

mn
φn |Vˆ |φm
φm|Vˆ |φn
n − m
=

mn
|φm|Vˆ |φn|2
n − m
. (14.16)
Note that if the state in which we are interested is the ground state |φ0 of Hˆ0 then the second-order
correction E(2)
0 is always negative (0 − m < 0). It is often the case that the first-order correction E(1)
0
vanishes because of selection rules; in such a case the second-order correction E(2)
0 always lowers the
ground-state energy of Hˆ0. The second-order correction |ψ(2) n  to the state is obtained in Problem 1.

14.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory
Perturbation theory is, in essence, an expansion in terms of ratios given by
φm|Vˆ |φn
n − m
. (14.17)
Therefore, one may expect the expansion to be more rapidly converging the smaller are the matrix
elements of Vˆ compared with the level spacings of the unperturbed system. However, if there are any
states for which m = n but φm|Vˆ |φn  0, the method as formulated so far breaks down. This is
the case for the perturbation theory for a degenerate eigenvalue n of Hˆ0,
Hˆ0 |φ(k)
n  = n |φ(k)
n  k = 1, 2, ... , gn , (14.18)
where the states |φ(k)
n  span a subspace, which we denote as En, of the state space E of the system.
Note that any linear combination of the |φ(k)
n  is still an eigenstate of Hˆ0 with the same eigenvalue
n. We can exploit this freedom to remove (at least partially, depending on the specific perturbation
Vˆ; see below) the aforementioned problem. We choose a set of gn orthonormal states
|χl =

gn
k=1
c(l)
k |φ(k)
n  l = 1, ... , gn , (14.19)
such that
χl|Vˆ |χm = 0 if l  m , (14.20)
namely, the matrix representing Vˆ in the basis |χl is diagonal. We can then use the perturbation
methods developed earlier, since vanishing energy denominators are always accompanied by
vanishing numerators, as will become apparent below. The correct choice of basis states to use in
doing perturbation theory is therefore the basis that diagonalizes Vˆ within each group of degenerate
states. Should we be interested in the perturbation of only one specific such group of energy n, then
it is only necessary to diagonalize Vˆ within that one group of states. The reason is that all the energy
denominators that occur in the perturbative expansion are energy differences between n and the ener￾gies of other states of Hˆ0, which are not in the subspace En spanned by the basis |χl: that the energies
of these other states may be degenerate is not an issue, since they do not give vanishing denominators.
The first task is to determine the coefficients c(l)
k of the linear combination in Eq. (14.19). To this
end, we report below the first two equations of the set (14.8)
λ0
: Hˆ0 |χl = n |χl ,
λ1
: Hˆ0 |χ(1)
l  + Vˆ |χl = n |χ(1)
l  + E(1)
nl |χl , (14.21)
where |χl is any of the gn states in the subspace En of energy n, and |χ(1)
l  and E(1)
nl are the first￾order corrections to that state and the corresponding energy, respectively. The λ0 equation does not
allow us to determine the c(l)
k ; it just says that |χl, being a linear combination of the |φ(k)
n , is an
eigenstate of Hˆ0 with eigenvalue n. Now, project both sides of the λ1 equation onto the state |φ(m) n 
in the subspace En,
φ(m) n | Hˆ0 |χ(1)
l  + φ(m) n | Vˆ |χl = nφ(m) n |χ(1)
l  + E(1)
nl φ(m) n |χl , (14.22)
and note that letting Hˆ0 act to the left in the first term on the left-hand side leads to φ(m) n | Hˆ0 |χ(1)
l  =
nφ(m) n |χ(1)
l , which exactly cancels the first term on the right-hand side. We are left with
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press437 14.2 Perturbation Theory with Degeneracy

gn
k=1
φ(m) n | Vˆ |φ(k)
n  c(l)
k = E(1)
nl c(l)
m , (14.23)
and hence the first-order corrections E(1)
nl with l = 1, ... , gn are the eigenvalues of the gn × gn
matrix representing the perturbation in the subspace En and the states |χl are the corresponding
eigenvectors.
We can also use the λ1 equation to determine the first-order corrections |χ(1)
l  to |χl. We project
both sides onto states |φm of energies m  n. These states are orthogonal to each of the gn states
|φ(k)
n  or |χl, namely, they are in the subspace complement of En. We find
φm| Hˆ0  mφm |

, (14.24)
which we can solve for φm|χ(1)
l ,
φm|χ(1)
l  = φm|Vˆ |χl
n − m
, (14.25)
from which we obtain
|χ(1)
l  =

mEn
|φmφm|χ(1)
l  =

mEn
|φm
φm|Vˆ |χl
n − m
, (14.26)
where the notation 
mEn means that the sum is over all states except the states |χ1, ... , |χgn 
spanning the subspace En.
Having determined the first-order corrections E(1)
nl , two situations can occur: (i) the E(1)
nl are all
distinct from each other, in which case Vˆ has completely removed the degeneracy of the level n; (ii)
some of the eigenvalues E(1)
nl are the same, in which case Vˆ has partially removed the degeneracy (it
may happen that some degeneracy persists to all orders in perturbation theory; this is the case when
the perturbation is invariant under some symmetry transformation – for example, when Vˆ commutes
with the total angular momentum Jˆ).
Case (i)
Consider the λ2 equation in Eq. (14.8), which we report below to assist the reader,
λ2 : Hˆ0 |χ(2)
l  + Vˆ |χ(1)
l  = n |χ(2)
l  + E(1)
nl |χ(1)
l  + E(2)
nl |χl , (14.27)
and project it onto the state |χl:
χl| Hˆ0  nχl |
|χ(2)
l  + χl |Vˆ |χ(1)
l  = nχl|χ(2)
l  + E(1)
nl χl|χ(1)
l   vanishes
+ E(2)
nl χl|χl  =1
, (14.28)
where the second term on the right-hand side vanishes because the state |χ(1)
l  is in the subspace
orthogonal to En, and hence χl|χ(1)
l  = 0. Also, the first terms on the left- and right-hand sides
cancel out, which leaves
E(2)
nl = χl |Vˆ |χ(1)
l  =

mEn
|φm|Vˆ |χl|2
n − m
, (14.29)
and thus the second-order correction |χ(2)
l  to the state is as was obtained in the non-degenerate case.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press438 Approximation Methods
Case (ii)
Let the energy E(1)
nl have degeneracy gnl ≤ gn, and label the corresponding eigenstates as
|χ1, ... , |χgnl. We intend to find the “optimal” linear combinations of the gnl eigenstates (in a sense
that will become clear below) of the type
|ξp =

gnl
l=1
c
(p)
l |χl p = 1, ... , gnl . (14.30)
These states all have energy n +E(1)
nl . We go back to the λ2 equation in (14.27), now written in terms
of the states |ξp:
λ2 : Hˆ0 |ξ(2)
p  + Vˆ |ξ(1)
p  = n |ξ(2)
p  + E(1)
nl |ξ(1)
p  + E(2)
nl |ξp , (14.31)
where |ξ(1)
p  is as in Eq. (14.26) but with |χl replaced by |ξp,
|ξ(1)
p  =

mEn
|φm
φm|Vˆ |ξp
n − m
, (14.32)
and where |ξ(2)
p  is to be determined, although it is not needed if the second-order correction to
the energy is all that concerns us. We now project Eq. (14.31) onto the subspace spanned by
|χ1, ... , |χgnl (which is contained in En); that is, we take the scalar product

Zˆ =

in terms of which Eq. (14.34) reads

gnl
l=1
χm| Zˆ |χlc
(p)
l = E(2)
nl c

m , (14.36)
which is the eigenvalue equation for the gnl × gnl matrix representing Zˆ in the basis |χl. The gnl
eigenvalues are the second-order corrections E(2)
nlp, with p = 1, ... , gnl, that we are seeking. The
calculation of these corrections is typically quite complex, since the construction of the matrix Z
requires the evaluation of a sum, that is in general infinite, over intermediate states:
Zml =

kEn
χm| Vˆ |φkφk | Vˆ |χl
n − k
. (14.37)
Of course, some second-order eigenvalues might be degenerate. One has then to look at the third￾order corrections.

14.3 The Variational Method
For some problems perturbation theory may not be suitable, because the expansion converges poorly
or because the Hamiltonian of interest is not close to a Hamiltonian with known eigenvalues and
eigenstates. An example of the former is the perturbative treatment of dense neutron matter starting
from the unperturbed Hamiltonian of a free Fermi gas of neutrons. An example of the latter occurs
in molecular physics: there is no small parameter in which to expand eigenvalues and eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian of a molecule with several nuclei. In such cases, the variational method provides a
useful (and often very effective) alternative to perturbation theory.
The method is based on a general theorem that states that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
on any state |ψ is greater than, or equal to, the exact ground-state energy E0 of the system, that is,
ψ| Hˆ |ψ
ψ|ψ ≥ E0 for any |ψ . (14.38)
The proof follows easily by noting that, if En and |ϕ(k)
n  are the (unknown) eigenvalues and
eigenstates of Hˆ,
Hˆ |ϕ(k)
n  = En |ϕ(k)
n  k = 1, ... , gn , (14.39)
then the state |ψ can be expanded in terms of the basis |ϕ(k)
n  as
|ψ =

n

gn
k=1
c(k)
n |ϕ(k)
n  , c(k)
n = ϕ(k)
n |ψ . (14.40)
Using the above expansion and the orthonormality of the basis states, ϕ(k)
n |ϕ(l)
p  = δnp δkl , yields
ψ| Hˆ |ψ =

n

gn
k=1
En |c(k)

n

since En > E0 for n ≥ 1, and
ψ|ψ =

|c(k)

2 . (14.42)
Equations (14.41) and (14.42) imply Eq. (14.38), namely that the expectation value on any |ψ is an
upper bound to the true ground-state energy. Of course, if |ψ happens to be a linear combination of
the |ϕ(k)
0  then the expectation value gives the exact ground-state energy E0.
It is interesting to compare this result with that obtained for the ground-state energy in first-order
perturbation theory,
0 + E(1)
0 = 0 + φ0 |Vˆ|φ0 = φ0 | Hˆ0 + Vˆ 
Hˆ
|φ0 . (14.43)
Note that this relation remains true also in degenerate perturbation theory, as long as |φ0 is
understood, in that case, to correspond to the linear combination of degenerate unperturbed states
|φ(k)
0  which diagonalizes the perturbation Vˆ (with E(1)
0 its lowest eigenvalue). We can now see that
the expectation value φ0 |Hˆ|φ0 represents not only a first-order perturbative estimate but also an
upper bound to the exact ground-state energy.

The simplest implementation of the variational method consists in choosing a trial state which
depends on a set of parameters β1, ... , βn, and in minimizing the function
E(β1, ... , βn) = ψ(β1, ... , βn)| Hˆ |ψ(β1, ... , βn)
ψ(β1, ... , βn)|ψ(β1, ... , βn) . (14.44)
with respect to β1, ... , βn. Of course, the success of the method depends on the choice of trial state,
which should include as many of the known features of the true ground state as possible. More
sophisticated trial wave functions can be obtained by adopting more flexible parameterizations; for
example, for a system of N helium atoms (which are bosons) strongly interacting with each other
via a Lennard–Jones potential (a “quantum liquid”), a suitable and properly symmetrized trial wave
function has the form ψ(r1, ... , rN) = $N
i<j=1 f (rij), where f (r) is known as the correlation function.
The function f (r) can be obtained by minimizing the functional E[ψ] with respect to variations in
the correlation function f (r).
There is a general result which applies to all discrete energy eigenstates. For an excited state the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian is not a minimum, of course; however, we can show that the
quantity
Hˆψ = ψ| Hˆ |ψ
ψ|ψ , (14.45)
viewed as a functional of the state |ψ, is stationary with respect to infinitesimal variations |δψ;
indeed, we have

Since Hˆ is hermitian and the expectation value Hˆψ real, it follows that
δHˆψ = 2 Re
δψ| Hˆ − Hˆψ |ψ

ψ|ψ . (14.47)
The condition for an extremum is that for arbitrary variations |δψ we have
δHˆψ = 0 =⇒ 
Hˆ − Hˆψ

|ψ = 0 , (14.48)
and the last relation is satisfied iff |ψ is one of the eigenstates of Hˆ and Hˆψ is the corresponding
eigenvalue. A by-product of this result is that, for example, a first-order change in the exact eigenstate
|ϕn to |ψ = |ϕn + |δψ produces only a second-order change in the exact eigenvalue En, namely
ψ| Hˆ |ψ
ψ|ψ = En + O(|δψ
2) . (14.49)
This is only true for the Hamiltonian; the expectation value of operators other than Hˆ will generally
have errors linear in |δψ.

Problem 2 Wave-Function Renormalization Constant
The perturbed state |ψn was constructed in Section 14.1 so as to have the normalization φn |ψn = 1.
In order to correctly normalize |ψn, we must multiply it by the factor Z1/2
n = 1/
ψn |ψn, where
Zn is the so-called wave-function renormalization constant. The state |ψn = Z1/2
n |ψn is such that
ψn |ψn = 1. Calculate Zn to second order in Vˆ, and show that it can be expressed as Zn = ∂En/∂n,
where En is the correct energy up to second order, that is, En = n + E(1)
n + E(2)
n . What is the physical
meaning of Zn?
Solution
To second order, we have (recall that φn |ψ(p)
n  = 0 with p ≥ 1)

where the partial derivative with respect to n does not act on the matrix elements of Vˆ, or on the m
with m  n. It is conceivable that the relation above remains valid to all orders, namely Zn = ∂En/∂n
where En is the exact energy eigenvalue – not just its second-order expansion – but this of course
needs to be proven. We note that
φn |ψn = Z1/2

Therefore, we can interpret Zn as the probability of observing the interacting system (described by
the Hamiltonian Hˆ) in the unperturbed state |φn.
Problem 3 One-Dimensional Harmonic Oscillator in a Uniform Electric Field
Consider a particle of charge q in one dimension in a harmonic-oscillator potential and under the
influence of a uniform electric field. The Hamiltonian reads
Hˆ = Hˆ0 + Vˆ , Hˆ0 = pˆ
2
2m
+
mω2
2 xˆ
2 , Vˆ = −qE xˆ .
1. Assume the electric field is weak, so that a perturbative calculation is permissible, and calculate
the first- and second-order corrections to a generic eigenvalue n of Hˆ0 (recall that the eigenvalues
of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are non-degenerate).
2. Solve for the exact eigenvalues of Hˆ and compare the results with those obtained in the
perturbative calculation. What do you conclude?
Solution
Part 1
The eigenenergies and eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator are well known: Hˆ0 |n = n |n, where
n = ω(n + 1/2). We also recall that the position operator can be expressed in terms of lowering and
raising operators as
xˆ =
 
2mω
(aˆ + aˆ
†) ,
with the properties
aˆ |n = √
n |n − 1 , ˆa |0 = 0, ˆa† |n = √
n + 1 |n + 1 .
It is now easy to see that the first-order correction to any unperturbed level n vanishes,
E(1)
n = n|Vˆ|n = −qE 
2mω
n|aˆ + aˆ
† |n = 0 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press443 14.4 Problems
since the operator ˆa ( ˆa†) can only connect the state |n to the state |n − 1 (|n + 1); in other words,
the only non-zero matrix elements of the perturbation Vˆ are n ± 1|Vˆ|n. In view of this fact, the
second-order correction is easy to evaluate,
E(2)
n =

mn
|m|Vˆ |n|2

= |n + 1|Vˆ |n|2
n − n+1
+
|n − 1|Vˆ |n|2
n − n−1
.
The energy differences between the unperturbed energies are given by n − n±1 = ∓ ω, while the
matrix elements read
n − 1| Vˆ |n = −qE 
2mω
√

We observe that Hˆ can be written as
Hˆ = pˆ

+
mω2
2
	
xˆ − qE
mω2

− (qE)2
2mω2 ,
that is, the Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator with shifted position and energy operators. Thus we
perform the transformation (in fact, a canonical transformation, since it preserves the commutation
relations)
xˆ −→ Xˆ = xˆ − qE
mω2 , Pˆ −→ Pˆ = pˆ , 
Xˆ , Pˆ  = i .
In terms of the new variables the Hamiltonian reads
Hˆ = Pˆ2
2m
+
mω2
2
Xˆ2 − (qE)2
2mω2 ,
with (exact) eigenvalues given by
En = n − (qE)2
2mω2 .
We see that the correction is independent of the particular state |n under consideration, and consists
of an overall shift downward as found in part 1. We conclude that all corrections E(p)
n with p ≥ 3
must vanish.
Problem 4 Particle in an Infinite Potential Well Subject to a Barrier Perturbation
A particle of mass m is placed in a potential
V(|x| > b) = ∞ , V(b/2 < |x| < b) = 0 , V(|x| < b/2) = V0 ,
where the barrier height V0 > 0. Note that V(x) is invariant under space inversion, V(x) = V(−x).
1. Assuming that the barrier can be treated as a perturbation, determine the first-order corrections to
the unperturbed energies.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press444 Approximation Methods
2. Assuming that the energy E of the particle is larger than V0, solve the problem exactly and show
that the eigenvalues of the even- and odd-parity solutions result from
cot(kb/2) = K
k tan(Kb/2) , even parity ,
and
tan(kb/2) = − k
K
tan(Kb/2) , odd parity ,
where (in the notation of Section 4.1)
k = √
 , K = √ − v0 .
Write down the corresponding eigenfunctions.
3. Show that, when the barrier can be treated as a perturbation, the eigenvalue equations yield
energies in agreement with those obtained in part 1 (do this just for the even solutions).

Part 2
Since the potential is invariant under space inversion, the states have alternating parities: even, odd,
even, odd, and so on, the ground state and first excited state being even and odd, respectively. We have
for energies E > V0
ψ
I = −k2ψI(x) , ψ
II = −K2ψII(x) , ψ
III = −k2ψIII(x) ,
where k =
√
, K= √ − v0, and the regions I, II, and III are −b < x < −b/2, −b/2 < x < b/2, and
b/2 < x < b, respectively. We can solve for, say, x > 0, and then obtain the complete solution
in −b < x < b by exploiting the known parity of the state. In particular, the first derivatives of
even-parity solutions ψe (x), and the odd-parity solutions ψo (x), vanish at x = 0, namely
ψe 
(0) = 0 , ψo (0) = 0 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press445 14.4 Problems
For x > 0, we have
ψII(x) = A cos(Kx) , ψIII(x) = B sin[k(b − x)] , even parity ,
ψII(x) = C sin(Kx) , ψIII(x) = D sin[k(b − x)] , odd parity ,
where the boundary condition ψIII(b) = 0 has already been imposed. It should be noted that these
solutions also satisfy the requirement ψe 
(0) = 0 and ψo (0) = 0. The boundary conditions at x = b/2
yield
A cos(Kb/2) = B sin(kb/2) , −KA sin(Kb/2) = −kB cos(kb/2)
C sin(Kb/2) = D sin(kb/2) , KC cos(Kb/2) = −kD cos(kb/2)
and the eigenvalues result from
cot(kb/2) = K
k tan(Kb/2) , even parity , tan(kb/2) = − k
K
tan(Kb/2) , odd parity .
The complete even-parity solutions are then
ψe
I (x) = B sin[ke (b + x)] , ψe
II(x) = A cos(Kex) , ψe
III(x) = B sin[ke (b − x)] ,
and the odd-parity solutions are
ψo
I (x) = −D sin[ko (b + x)] , ψo
II(x) = C sin(Kox) , ψo
III(x) = D sin[ko (b − x)] .
where, having determined the eigenvalues e and o, we can express A and C in terms of B and D as
A = sin(keb/2)
cos(Keb/2)
B , C = sin(kob/2)
sin(Kob/2)
D ,
and |B| and |D| can be fixed by normalizing the states. Here, we have defined
ke = √e , Ke = √e − v0 ,
and similarly for ko and κo.
Part 3
Introduce the variables
x = bk/2 ,  = 4x2
/b2 , x0 = b
√v0/2 , v0 = 4x2
0/b2 ,
so that the eigenvalue equations obtained in part 2 can be written for the even solutions as
tan x tan

0 = x

x2 − x2

,
and for the odd solutions as
cot x tan 
x2 − x2
0 = −

x2 − x2

x ,
for x > x0. Hereafter, we consider only the eigenvalue equation for the even solution, for the purpose
of illustration. We define
f (x) = tan x tan 
x2 − x2
0 , g(x) = x

x2 − x2
0
,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press446 Approximation Methods
and in the asymptotic regime x 
 x0, where f (x 
 x0) = tan2 x and g(x 
 x0) = 1, the eigenvalue
equation reduces to
tan2 x = 1 =⇒ tan x = ±1 =⇒ xn = π

that is, the unperturbed eigenenergies of the infinite well corresponding to the even eigenfunctions,
as expected (for x0 = 0 the potential is just that of an infinite well). Next, we want to determine the
corrections linear in x2
0 to these solutions xn. To this end, we expand f (x) and g(x) around xn,
f (x) = f (xn) + (x − xn) f 

Problem 5 Alternative Derivation of First-Order Energy
in Degenerate Perturbation Theory
Introduce a projection operator onto a degenerate subspace of energy n,
Pˆn =

gn
k=1
|φ(k)
n φ(k)
n | ,
and redefine the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the perturbation as
Hˆ
0 = Hˆ0 + Pˆn Vˆ Pˆn , Vˆ = Vˆ − Pˆn Vˆ Pˆn , Hˆ = Hˆ
0 + Vˆ
0 .
Show that this redefinition is such that the matrix elements of Vˆ vanish in the degenerate subspace,
while they are left unchanged between eigenstates |φm of Hˆ0 corresponding to eigenvalues m other
than n. Obtain the matrix elements of Hˆ
0 in the degenerate subspace, that is, the φ(p)

and determine its eigenvalues. Do they agree with those found in Section 14.2?
Solution
In the degenerate subspace we find

that is, Vˆ is the null operator in this subspace. By contrast, the matrix elements of Vˆ between
eigenstates |φm of Hˆ0 corresponding to eigenvalues m other than n are left unchanged,
φl| Vˆ |φm = φl| Vˆ |φm−φl| Pˆn  vanishes
Vˆ Pˆn |φm  vanishes

In a similar fashion, it is easy to see that the matrix elements of Hˆ

n | Hˆ
0 |φ(q)
n  = n δpq + φ(p)

and so Hˆ
0 is no longer diagonal in the degenerate subspace. We now proceed to diagonalize Hˆ
0 – or
equivalently Vˆ – in this subspace. We denote its gn eigenvalues and eigenstates as
Vˆ |χl = E(1)

and the gn eigenvalues E(1)

Problem 6 Particle Confined in a Box and Subject to a Perturbation
Consider a particle of mass m confined to a box of volume Ω, that is, the potential vanishes if 0 ≤
x ≤ Ω1/3, 0 ≤ y ≤ Ω1/3, and 0 ≤ z ≤ Ω1/3 and is infinite otherwise. Inside the box, the particle is
subject to the perturbation described by the potential

Calculate the perturbed energies of the ground and first excited states to linear terms in V0. Obtain
the first excited states to leading order in V0.
Solution
The normalized eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian describing a particle confined in the box are

Problem 7 Effect of Finite Nuclear Size on Energy Spectrum of Hydrogen-Like Atom
In this problem the effect of the finite size of the nucleus on the spectrum of hydrogen-like atoms
is considered. We assume for simplicity that the nuclear charge distribution has spherical symmetry
(so that the nucleus has zero total angular momentum) and that it is described by a function ρN(r)
normalized as  dr ρN(r) = 1, where ρN(r) vanishes for r 
 R, R being the nuclear radius, of the
order of a few 10−13 cm (note that the proton in the hydrogen atom has a finite size too). The
(attractive) Coulomb potential felt by the electron is given by
V(r) = −Ze2

dr ρN(r

|r − r|

where Z is the atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus).3 Ignore effects associated with
the electron’s spin, and write the Hamiltonian as

than the atomic radius). Compare the first-order correction to the ground-state energy level with its

that r> is equal to r if r > r and equal to r if r > r, and so it cannot be taken out of the integral sign.

angular momentum, and its projection take on the values n = 1, 2, ... , l = 0, 1, ... , n − 1, and
m = −l, −l + 1, ... , l, respectively.

and so the first-order correction makes the ground state less bound, as one might have expected (the
Coulomb attraction felt by the electron is reduced when the electron penetrates the nuclear region).
An excited energy level n has degeneracy gn = n2, and hence we need to use degenerate
perturbation theory. The first-order corrections to the energy n are the eigenvalues of the matrix
of dimension gn whose matrix elements are given by
φnlm | V |φnlm ,
in the subspace with fixed n. However, the perturbation V(r) is spherically symmetric and is therefore
invariant under rotations (for the case we are considering, that of a spherical nucleus), specifically

L, V  = 0 .
In particular, V(r) commutes with L2 and Lz, and as a consequence its matrix elements vanish
between eigenstates of L2 and Lz belonging to different eigenvalues, which implies that
φnlm | V |φnlm = φnlm| V |φnlm δllδmm ,
and the matrix is diagonal in the basis |φnlm. The first-order corrections are simply the diagonal
matrix elements. Further, these diagonal matrix elements are independent of the azimuthal quantum
number,4 and are given by
E(1)

l(l + 1) − m(m ± 1) |φnl,m±1, and the fact that L± commute with V to show that

thus proving its independence of m.

We conclude that at first order in the perturbative expansion only s-wave states are affected and the
corresponding energies are shifted up. The upward shift is tiny; indeed,

However, this correction becomes appreciable for μ-mesic atoms, in which one electron is replaced
by a (negative) muon. The Compton wavelength of the muon is a factor ≈ 207 smaller than that of
the electron and consequently the upward shift relative to the 1s level is of the order of 1.3 × 10−5.
By measuring this shift in μ-mesic atoms, information can be obtained on the nuclear mean square
charge radius.
Problem 8 Hydrogen Atom in a Static External Electric Field: Stark Effect
We neglect spin degrees of freedom and take the unperturbed Hamiltonian as
H0 = p2
2μ − e2
r .
Assume that the (static) electric field is produced by an external electrostatic potential U(r). This
leads to an additional term in the Hamiltonian, given by −e U(r). Since atomic dimensions are much
smaller than the length scale over which U(r) varies appreciably, we can expand U(r) about the
origin to obtain
U(r) = U(0) +

By setting the arbitrary value U(0) to zero and noting that E(r) = −∇U(r), we obtain the perturba￾tion as5
V = eE · r with E ≡ E(0) ,
and arrange the coordinate system so that E= E zˆ, namely the external electric field is directed along
the z-axis.
Calculate the first-order corrections to the unperturbed ground- and first excited-state energy
levels, and compare them with the corresponding unperturbed energies (tabulations of the radial
wave functions are readily available). Obtain the approximate eigenstates.
Solution
The perturbation Vˆ commutes with Lˆz (it is invariant under rotations about the z-axis) but not
with Lˆ 2. Under parity, the unperturbed eigenstates transform as UˆP |φnlm = (−1)l |φnlm, and so
they are even or odd depending on whether l is even or odd. As a consequence, except for the

non-degenerate ground state (corresponding to n = 1), which, being s-wave, is even under parity,
the degenerate excited states with principal quantum number n ≥ 2 have no definite parity. However,
the perturbation Vˆ is odd, UˆP Vˆ Uˆ†
P = −Vˆ, which implies that its matrix elements φnl

basis of eigenstates of Hˆ0 vanish unless l + l

After these preliminary considerations, we evaluate the first-order corrections to the ground-state and
first-excited-state levels of hydrogen induced by an external electric field. For the (non-degenerate)

E(1)
n=1 = φ100 | Vˆ |φ100 = 0 ,

Note that the linear combinations |φ± are not eigenstates of the parity operator; as a matter of fact,
UˆP |φ± = |φ∓. The admixture of 2s and 2p states is independent of the strength of the electric field.
Even a very weak field will maximally mix these two states. As we will see, the radiative decay of
the 2s into the 1s state by single-photon emission is forbidden; the decay of the 2p into the 1s state is
not. For this reason, the 2s state (in the absence of an external electric field) is metastable. However,
in the presence of even a very weak electric field, it can decay rapidly through its mixing with the 2p
state by emission of a single photon.
Problem 9 Spin-1/2 System in a Uniform Magnetic Field in a Generic Direction
Consider a spin-1/2 system described by the following Hamiltonian:
H0 = 2 vx
 Sx + 4 vz
2 S2
z ,
where S is the spin operator and vx and vz (vz > vx) are positive constants with dimensions of energy.
1. Obtain the eigenvalues ± and corresponding eigenstates |± of H0. Why are the |± also
eigenstates of Sx?
2. The system has magnetic moment μ = −(μ0/) S, with μ0 assumed to be positive. A static
magnetic field B is applied with components
B = B0 (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) ,
where θ and φ are the polar angles. Obtain the matrix representing the interaction V of the system
with the magnetic field in the basis |±, consisting of eigenstates of Sz.
3. Assume that the magnetic field is weak enough that the effects of the interaction V can be treated
in perturbation theory. Calculate the energies of the system to first and second order in B0 and
obtain the eigenstates to first order in B0.
4. Denote by |ψ0 the ground state of the system including the first-order correction calculated above,
and evaluate the mean value ψ0 |μ|ψ0. Define the induced magnetic moment as ψ0 |μ|ψ0 −
−|μx |− xˆ, where |− turns out to be the (unperturbed) ground state corresponding to H0. Is
this induced magnetic moment parallel to B? Show that

and calculate the coefficients χαβ (that is, the components of the magnetic susceptibility tensor).
Solution
Part 1
In the basis |+ and |− that diagonalizes S2 and Sz, the matrix representing H0 is given by
H0 =

,
since S2
z |± = (2/4)|± and Sx |± = (/2) |∓; this last relationship follows from
Sx = (S+ + S−)/2 , S±|∓ =  |± , S±|± = 0 ,
where S+ and S− are the spin raising and lowering operators, respectively. The (non-degenerate)
eigenvalues ± and corresponding eigenstates |± of H0 are easily obtained,
± = vz ± vx , |± = 1
√
2
(|+ ± |−) ,
and |± are also eigenstates of Sx with eigenvalues ±/2. This is so because Sx commutes with H0,
as is easily verified by noting that Sx anticommutes with Sz and hence commutes with S2
z.

The interaction V is given by
V = −μ · B = μ0 B0

Problem 10 Charged Particle Constrained on a Circle in a Uniform Electric Field
A particle of mass m and charge q is constrained to move in a circle of radius R. Its unperturbed
Hamiltonian consists of the kinetic energy operator, which is written as
Hˆ0 = Lˆ2
z
2I ,
where Lˆz = −i d/dφ is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator Lˆ, and I = mR2 is
the moment of inertia.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press458 Approximation Methods
1. Obtain the eigenvalues, including their degeneracy, and eigenstates of Hˆ0.
2. Suppose that the particle is now under the influence of a uniform (time-independent) electric field
directed along the x-direction and of magnitude E. Assuming that this interaction can be treated
in perturbation theory, obtain the corrections to the ground-state energy to first and second order
in E, and the perturbed ground state to first order in E. Calculate the electric susceptibility
χ = −∂E0
∂E ,
where E0 is the ground-state energy including these first- and second-order corrections.
3. The ethane molecule has the chemical formula CH3–CH3. In the CH3 group, the three H atoms
form the basis of a regular three-sided pyramid with the C atom at its vertex. The ethane molecule
therefore consists of two inverted pyramids joined by an axis going through the two C atoms. One
group rotates relative to the other. To first approximation, this rotation is free, and the associated
kinetic energy operator is just the Hamiltonian Hˆ0 above, where I is now the moment of inertia of
the CH3 group relative to the rotational axis. The electrostatic energy between the two groups is
approximately modeled by adding to Hˆ0 a term having the form
Vˆ = V0 cos(3φ) ,
where V0 is a real constant. Give a physical justification for the φ dependence of Vˆ. Calculate
the energy to second order and the wave function to first order of the new ground state. Give a
physical interpretation of the result.
Solution
Part 1
The eigenfunctions of Lˆz are also eigenfunctions of Hˆ0. They satisfy
−iψ
(φ) = mψ(φ) =⇒ ψ(φ) = c eimφ/ .
Periodic boundary conditions demand that
ψ(φ) = ψ(φ + 2π) =⇒ e2πim/ = 1 ,
requiring m/ = m integer, with m = 0, ±1, ±2, ... ; the normalized eigenfunctions are given by
ψm(φ) = 1

The eigenvalues of Hˆ0 follow from
Hˆ0 |ψm = m |ψm ,
and m = 2 m2/(2I) is two-fold degenerate for m  0 and non-degenerate for m = 0.
Part 2
The perturbation reads Vˆ = −qEx = −qER cos φ. The first-order correction to the ground-state
energy vanishes, since

Problem 11 Electron Interacting with Two 3
He Nuclei in a Magnetic Field
An electron and two 3He nuclei are in a uniform magnetic field B zˆ. The electron has a magnetic
moment given by
μe = −ge
e
2mec
S ≡ −γe S ,
where me and ge are the electron mass and gyromagnetic factor, respectively. The 3He nucleus is a
spin-1/2 particle consisting of two protons and a neutron, bound together by the strong interaction.
It has a magnetic moment given by
μ = −g
e
2mpc
I ≡ −γ I ,
where mp is the proton mass and I and g are the 3He-nucleus spin-1/2 operator and gyromagnetic
factor, respectively. Here, the parameters γe and γ are both positive, and γe 
 γ. The orbital degrees
of freedom of the electron and 3He nuclei are to be ignored throughout; further, the two 3He nuclei
(which are fermions) are to be considered as distinguishable particles.
1. Accounting only for the interactions of these particles with the external magnetic field, write
down the Hamiltonian H0 for this system and obtain the possible eigenvalues and their degree of
degeneracy.
2. Now assume that, while the interaction between the nuclear spins is negligible, the hyperfine
interaction between the electron and 3He spins is given by
V = v S · (I1 + I2) ,
where the parameter v > 0 and v2 has dimension of energy. Treat V as a small perturbation and
obtain the first-order corrections to the energy levels, found in part 1.
3. Switch off the magnetic field, so that the Hamiltonian reduces to V. Let I = I1 + I2 be the total
nuclear spin. Show that V has no matrix elements between eigenstates of I2 belonging to different
eigenvalues. Let F = S + I be the total angular momentum. What are the eigenvalues of F2 and
their degeneracies? Determine the energy eigenvalues of the three-spin system and corresponding
degeneracies. Do F2 and Fz form a complete set of commuting observables? And how about I2, F2,
and Fz?
Solution
Part 1
The Hamiltonian H0 of the system is given by
H0 = −(μe + μ1 + μ2) · B = ΩSz + ω(I1z + I2z) with Ω = γe B and ω = γB ,
where the angular frequencies Ω and ω are both positive, and Ω 
 ω. The eigenstates of H0 are the
orthonormal kets |ms, m1, m2, which are common eigenstates of Sz, I1z, and I2z, with corresponding
eigenvalues given by
H0 |ms, m1, m2 =  [Ωms + ω (m1 + m2)] |ms, m1, m2 , ms, m1, m2 = ±1/2 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press461 14.4 Problems
These eigenvalues are
++ = 
2
(Ω + 2ω) , +0 = 
2
Ω , +− = 
2
(Ω − 2ω)
and
−+ = −
2
(Ω − 2ω) , −0 = −
2
Ω , −− = −
2
(Ω + 2ω) ,
where the first subscript specifies whether the electron is spin up (+) or down (–), while the second
subscript specifies whether the nuclear spins are both up (+), or the first up and the second down or
vice versa (0), or both down (–). The eigenvalues +0 and −0 each have degeneracy 2.
Part 2
As a preliminary, we note that
m
s, m
1, m
2 | S · I1 |ms, m1, m2 = δm
2,m2 m
s, m
1 | S · I1 |ms, m1 .
Define J1 = S + I1, so that
S · I1 = 1
2
	
J2
1 − 3
2
2


.
Since J1z = Sz + I1z commutes with S · I1 and the states |ms, m1 are eigenstates of J1z,
J1z |ms, m1 = (ms + m1)|ms, m1, it follows that
m
s, m
1 | S · I1 |ms, m1 = 0 if m
s + m
1  ms + m1 .
Similarly, we have for S · I2 that its matrix elements vanish unless m
1 = m1 and m
s + m
2 = ms + m2.
We now proceed with the evaluation of the first-order corrections induced by V on the levels of
H0. We begin by considering the non-degenerate energy levels. We find
E(1)
++ = +, +, +|V|+, +, + = v (+, +|S · I1 |+, + + +, +|S · I2 |+, +) .
Since the state | + + has j1 = 1, we have, for the first matrix element within the parentheses,
+, +|S · I1 |+, + = 1
2
+, +| J2
1 − 3 2
/2 |+, + = 1
4
2
and similarly for the second matrix element. Thus, the first-order correction follows,
E(1)
++ = v2
2 ,
and it is easy to see that E(1)
−− = v2/2 also.
Next, we consider
E(1)
+− = +, −, −|V|+, −, − = v (+, −|S · I1 |+, − + +, −|S · I2 |+, −) .
Recalling that the state |+, − is the following linear combination of j1 = 1 and j1 = 0 states with
mj1 = 0, namely
|+, − = 1
√
2
(|1, 0 + |0, 0) ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press462 Approximation Methods
we obtain
S · I1 |+, − = 1
2
	
J2

(|1, 0 + |0, 0) = 1

and

2 (1, 0| + 0, 0|)
	
1
4 |1, 0 − 3
4 |0, 0


= −2
4 .
Of course, the second matrix element, involving S · I2, is the same. Thus we arrive at
E(1)
+− = −v2
2 .
The correction E(1)
−+ can be obtained similarly; the two-particle states are written as
|−, + = 1
√
2
(|1, 0−|0, 0) ,
which leads to
S · I1 |−, + = 1
√
2
	
2
4 |1, 0 +
3 2
4 |0, 0


and hence
−, +|S · I1 |−, + = 2
2 (1, 0|−0, 0|)
	
1
4 |1, 0 +
3
4 |0, 0


= −2
4 ,
so that E(1)
−+ = E(1)
+−.
To obtain the corrections to the degenerate levels, we need to evaluate the matrix representing the
perturbation in the degenerate subspace,
V =
	
+, +, −|V|+, +, − +, +, −|V|+, −, +
+, −, +|V|+, +, − +, −, +|V|+, −, +


=
	
+, +, −|V|+, +, − 0
0 +, −, +|V|+, −, +


,
where the off-diagonal matrix elements vanish because either m
1  m1 or m
2  m2, and so
+, +, −|V|+, +, − = v (+, +|S · J1 |+, + + +, −|S · J2 |+, −) = v2
4 − v2
4 = 0
and
+, −, +|V|+, −, + = v (+, −|S · J1 |+, − + +, +|S · J2 |+, +) = −v2
4
+
v2
4 = 0 .
We conclude that the states have vanishing first-order corrections and remain degenerate. The matrix
for the remaining two degenerate states is given by
V =
	
−, +, −|V|−, +, − −, +, −|V|−, −, +
−, −, +|V|−, +, − −, −, +|V|−, −, +


=
	
−, +, −|V|−, +, − 0
0 −, −, +|V|−, −, +


=

,
yielding vanishing corrections.

Part 3
The Hamiltonian reduces to V = v S·I with I = I1+I2. Since V commutes with I2, it follows that matrix
elements of V between eigenstates of I2 belonging to different eigenvalues vanish. We can combine
the electron spin 1/2 with the total nuclear spin 0 (1) to obtain total angular momentum 1/2 (1/2, 3/2).
The eigenvalues of F2 are f ( f + 1)2, and so 32/4 for f = 1/2 with degeneracy 4, and 152/4 for
f = 3/2, also with degeneracy 4 (recall the mf degeneracy is 2 f + 1; however, f = 1/2 occurs twice).

degeneracy 2; and v2/2 for f = 3/2 and i = 1 with degeneracy 4. Clearly, F2 and Fz do not form a
complete set of commuting observables, since the eigenvalue 1/2 occurs twice; however, I2, F2, and
Fz constitute a complete set of commuting observables, since specifying their respective eigenvalues
identifies uniquely the corresponding common eigenstate.
Problem 12 Nucleus with Spin in Non-Uniform Electric Field and Weak Magnetic Field
Consider a nucleus of spin I = 3/2, whose state space is spanned by the four states |m with m = ±3/2
and ±1/2, which are common eigenstates of I2 and Iz with eigenvalues 152/4 and m. The nucleus
is placed in a non-uniform electric field derived from the scalar potential U(r), which satisfies the
Laplace equation, ∇2 U(r) = 0. The Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the electric field
gradient and the nuclear electric quadrupole moment is given by

H0, their degeneracy, and the corresponding eigenstates.
3. In addition to its quadrupole moment, the nucleus has magnetic moment μ = γ I (here γ is
the gyromagnetic factor). A magnetic field B0 of arbitrary direction nˆ is superimposed on the

electrostatic field. Set ω0 = −γ |B0 |. Include the interaction of the magnetic field with the nuclear
magnetic moment and obtain the energies of the system to first order in B0. The unperturbed
Hamiltonian is that of part 2.
4. Assume that B0 is along the z-axis and is weak enough for the eigenstates in part 2 and the energies
found in part 3 to be good approximations, to first order in ω0. What are the Bohr frequencies that
can appear in the expectation value Ix (t)?

corrections we need to diagonalize V in the subspace spanned by the states |φ1 and |φ2. However,
in this space,
φm|V|φn = 0 m, n = 1, 2 ,
and hence the first-order corrections vanish in this case, and the degeneracy persists. In order to
calculate the second-order corrections in the case of degeneracy, we construct a matrix corresponding
to the operator Z, where

Problem 14 Charged Particle in Anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator
Potential and Uniform Magnetic Field
Consider a charged particle (mass m and charge q) in an anisotropic three-dimensional oscillator
potential with ωx  ωy = ωz = ω. The particle is also exposed to a uniform magnetic field in the
xˆ-direction, B= B xˆ.
1. Write down the Hamiltonian for this system.
2. Assuming that the magnetic field is weak and the anisotropy of the oscillator potential is small
(namely, |ωx − ω|  ω), split the Hamiltonian obtained in part 1 into an unperturbed term H0 and
a perturbative term V.
3. Assuming that the Zeeman splitting is comparable with the energy splitting produced by the
anisotropy but small compared with ω, calculate the first-order corrections to the energy of the
first excited level. Does the perturbation remove the degeneracy completely?
4. Suppose that the oscillator potential is isotropic and that the term quadratic in the magnetic field
is negligible. What are the exact eigenvalues and eigenstates of the resulting Hamiltonian?

excited level (n = 1) is three-fold degenerate. To construct the matrix V in the degenerate subspace
spanned by the states |1, 0, 0, |0, 1, 0, |0, 0, 1, it is convenient to first express the perturbation in

Problem 15 Hydrogen Atom in a Uniform Electric Field: Induced
Electric Dipole Moment
Consider a hydrogen atom exposed to a uniform electric field E zˆ. Ignore spin degrees of freedom.
1. Calculate the corrections to the ground-state energy level up to second order in perturbation theory.
You may neglect the contribution from the continuum states in the second-order calculation.
2. Calculate the electric dipole moment D = −e r induced by the electric field for the ground state of
hydrogen, and verify that D has a non-vanishing component only along the zˆ-direction.
3. Prove the Hellmann–Feynman theorem: it states that, if the Hamiltonian depends on a parameter
λ and |ψn (λ) is a normalized eigenstate with eigenvalue En (λ), it follows that
dEn (λ)
dλ = ψn (λ)|
dH(λ)
dλ |ψn (λ) .
Apply the theorem to the case of the hydrogen atom in an electric field (λ −→ E), and obtain the
following relation for the ground state:
ψgs|Dz|ψgs = −dEgs
dE .
Verify that it is satisfied by the second-order calculation carried out in part 2.

The first-order correction vanishes because of the parity selection rule. In the second-order correction
we neglect the contribution of the continuum states; these are eigenstates of H0 with continuum
eigenvalues  > 0 and continuum normalization given by φl
m |φlm = δ( − 
) δl,l
 δm,m
(note that the sum over l is unrestricted for these states). Since the ground state is an s-wave, states
contributing to E(2)
gs must have m = 0 (the perturbation commutes with Lz). We are thus led to consider
matrix elements of the type
φnl0 |z|φ100 = 0 , l even ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press474 Approximation Methods

The expectation value of r on the unperturbed state vanishes (owing to the parity selection rule), so

Problem 16 A Symmetric Rotator under the Influence of a Small Perturbation
A system with only angular degrees of freedom θ and φ is described by the following Hamiltonian:
H = L2
2I
+ λ 2 cos(2φ) ,
where I is the moment of inertia and λ is a (positive) parameter such that λI  1. Considering only
the S- and P-wave levels, calculate their energies in first-order perturbation theory, and work out the
corresponding zeroth-order energy eigenfunctions.
Solution
The unperturbed Hamiltonian is taken as H0 =L2/(2I). It has eigenvalues l = l(l + 1)2/(2I) with
degeneracy gl = 2l + 1 and corresponding eigenstates |ψlm, which, in the coordinate representation,
are given by the spherical harmonics (here m is the azimuthal quantum number, the eigenvalue of
Lz being m). Hence, the ground-state (S-wave) level is non-degenerate, whereas the first excited
(P-wave) level is three-fold degenerate. The first-order correction to the ground state is

Problem 17 Electron in a Harmonic Potential under the Action

An electron (mass m and charge −e) is bound in a harmonic potential V(r) = mω2r2/2, with wave
functions given by
φr |φnlm = φnlm(r) = Rnl(r) Ylm(Ω) .
It has an electric dipole moment along the z-axis given by Dz = −ez.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press477 14.4 Problems
2. Now suppose the electron also interacts with a uniform and weak electric field E zˆ. Obtain the
first- and second-order corrections to the ground-state energy, and the first-order correction to
the ground-state wave function. Show that the expectation value of the harmonic potential in the
perturbed ground state is the same as that in the unperturbed ground state, to linear terms in E.
Show explicitly that the sum rule is satisfied for the ground state.
3. Under the same conditions as above, obtain the first- and second-order corrections to the first￾excited-state energy and show explicitly that the sum rule is satisfied for each |φ11m state.
4. Obtain the exact energies for the Hamiltonian H = H0 + W, where W is the interaction term with
the electric field, and compare them with the energies obtained in parts 2 and 3.

where α = mω/. Also, recall that the Rnl(r) are orthonormal in the following sense (note the same l
values)
 ∞
0
dr r2 Rnl(r) Rpl(r) = δnp .
Further, note that rR00 (r) is proportional to R11 (r) and that rR11 (r) can be written either as a linear
combination of R00 (r) and R20 (r) or as proportional to R22 (r). These observations allow one to carry
out the radial integrations easily. Finally, we report for convenience the following expressions for the
spherical harmonics:
Y00 (Ω) = 1

4π , Y10 (Ω) =
 3
4π
cos θ , Y1±1 (Ω) = ∓

4π
3 cos2 θ − 1
2 , Y2±1 (Ω) = ∓
 15
8π
sin θ cos θ e±iφ ;
the Y2±2 (Ω) are not needed. Again, the observation that Y00 (Ω) cos θ and Y1m(Ω) cos θ can be
written as linear combinations of spherical harmonics simplifies the angular integrations by making
use of the orthonormality of the Ylm(Ω).

Part 3
The first excited state has l = 1 and its energy is three-fold degenerate (corresponding to m = ±1
and 0). In first order, we need to diagonalize the matrix representing the perturbation in the subspace
spanned by the states |φ11m. However, φ11m|V(r)|φ11m = 0 (by the parity selection rule) and the
resulting matrix is identically zero. Thus, there are no first-order corrections. In second order, we
need to construct the matrix

Since the parity of |φnlm is (−1)l (and the perturbation is odd under parity),
φ11m| z |φnlm = 0 if l is odd .
Further, we must have l = 0 or 2 and m = m
. To verify this, consider
φ11m| z |φnlm =

Problem 18 Leading-Order Correction for the Hydrogen-Atom
Ground-State Energy in an Electric Field
The second-order correction to an unperturbed energy level generally involves a summation over an
infinite number of states, which is often difficult to carry out in closed form. In this problem, we
investigate an alternative method based on the following relation:
E(2)
n = φn |Vˆ|ψ(1)
n  ,
where Vˆ is the perturbation and |ψ(1) n  is the first-order correction to the unperturbed state |φn
(an eigenstate of Hˆ0 with eigenvalue n, the latter assumed to be non-degenerate).
1. Show that expanding En (λ) and |ψn (λ) – respectively, the eigenvalue and eigenstate of Hˆ(λ) =
Hˆ0 + λ Vˆ – in a power series in λ leads, to linear terms in λ, to the following relation satisfied by
|ψ(1) n :
(Hˆ0 − n)|ψ(1)
n  = (φn |Vˆ|φn 
E(1) n
−Vˆ)|φn .
2. Assuming that both Hˆ0 and Vˆ are local in the coordinate representation,
φr |Hˆ0 |φr = H0 (r, −i∇) δ(r − r
) ,
and similarly for Vˆ (here, |φr are the eigenstates of the position operator r), show that the relation
in part 1 can be viewed as an inhomogeneous differential equation satisfied by the wave function
ψ(1) n (r),
[H0 (r, −i∇) − n] ψ(1)
n (r) = 
E(1)
n − V(r)

φn (r) .
The solution of this equation is not unique, since an arbitrary multiple α|φn can be added to it.
However, it can be made unique by imposing the auxiliary condition φn |ψ(1) n  = 0.
3. Consider a hydrogen atom under the influence of a uniform electric field directed along the z-axis,
namely E= E zˆ. Show that the first-order correction ψ(1)
100 (r) to the ground-state wave function
φ100 (r) satisfies

and a0 is the Bohr radius. Explain why the wave function ψ(1)

Hence, show that such a wave function ψ(1)
100 (r) is orthogonal to φ100 (r) (thus ensuring its
uniqueness) and that g(r) satisfies

where x = r/a0. Solve the equation for p(x) by assuming that it is a polynomial.
5. Obtain the second-order correction by computing
E(2)
100 = φ100 |Vˆ|ψ(1)
100 ,
and compare the result with that obtained in Problem 15.
Solution
Part 1
As in Section 14.1, we write
(Hˆ0 + λ Vˆ) (|φn + λ|ψ(1)
n + ··· ) = (n + E(1)
n + ··· ) (|φn + λ|ψ(1)
n + ··· )
and the linear terms in λ lead to the following relation:
Hˆ0 |ψ(1)
n  + Vˆ |φn = n |φ(1)
n  + E(1)
n |φn ,
or
(Hˆ0 − n)|ψ(1)
n  = (φn |Vˆ|φn − Vˆ)|φn .
Part 2
In the coordinate representation, we have

dr φr |Hˆ0 − n |φrφr |ψ(1)
n  =

dr φr |φn |Vˆ|φn − Vˆ|φrφr |φn ,

,
that is, an inhomogeneous partial differential equation. Clearly, the solution of the inhomogeneous
equation is not unique, given that ψ(1) n (r) + αφn (r), with α an arbitrary constant, also satisfies the
equation, since
[H0 (r, −i∇) − n]φn (r) = 0 .
It is made unique by imposing the auxiliary condition
φn |ψ(1)
n  = 0 =⇒ φn |(|ψ(1)
n  + α|φn) = α = 0 ,
since |φn is normalized.

Part 3
The first-order correction φ100 | eEz |φ100 to the ground-state energy vanishes (owing to the parity
selection rule), and therefore the equation reads

The unperturbed Hamiltonian on the left-hand side commutes with the components of the orbital
angular momentum L (it is a scalar operator) and hence with L2, while the function r cos θ φ100 (r)
on the right-hand side is proportional to the spherical harmonic Y10 (θ) and is an eigenfunction of L2
and Lz, with eigenvalues 22 and 0, respectively. It follows that ψ(1)
100 (r) must also be an eigenfunction
of L2 and Lz with the same eigenvalues. This implies that ψ100 (r) can be written as g(r) cos θ.

and the common cos θ factor can be canceled, resulting in the radial equation given in the text of

ground-state wave function, and so the requirement φ100 |ψ(1)

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press486 Approximation Methods
Since p(x) is a polynomial, it is clear from the structure of the equation that the highest power that
can occur in p(x) is x2; indeed, if a power xn with n ≥ 3 were to be present then the term x2p
(x) in
the equation would yield a power xn+1 which could not be canceled. Thus, we take
p(x) = p0 + p1x + p2x2 ,
and upon substitution in the equation we have
2p2x2 + 2x(1 − x)(p1 + 2p2x) − 2p0 − 2p1x − 2p2x2 = αx3 .
Matching powers of x leads to
p0 = 0 , p1 = −α

A finer point: we should consider the homogeneous equation
x2
p(x) + 2x(1 − x)p
(x) − 2p(x) = 0 ,
since its solution can always be added to that obtained above. It turns out, however, that such a
solution would lead to a wave function ψ(1)
100 (r) that diverges exponentially in the asymptotic region,
and therefore would not be acceptable. To see how this comes about, assume
p(x) =

Insertion of the above expansion yields (after dropping a common factor xs

∞
n=0
[(n + s)(n + s − 1) + 2(n + s) − 2] anxn =
∞
n=0
2(n + s)anxn+1 .
Matching powers of x on the left- and right-hand sides, we see that the n = 0 coefficient on the left￾hand side must vanish
[s(s − 1) + 2s − 2]a0 = 0 or s
2 + s − 2 = 0 =⇒ s = 1, −2 ,
and the only acceptable solution is s = 1 (the solution with s = −2 would lead to a wave function that
was singular at the origin). Substituting s = 1 into the expansion, we find
∞
n=0
[n(n + 1) + 2 (n + 1) − 2] anxn =
∞
n=0
2(n + 1)anxn+1
or, setting n + 1 −→ n in the sum on the right (and noting that the term with n = 0 does not contribute

Note that the series cannot terminate (so the solution p(x) of the homogeneous equation cannot be a
polynomial). It can be identically zero if a0 = 0, which in fact turns out to be the only possibility, the
reason being that otherwise p(x) diverges exponentially as x −→ ∞. Indeed, the series for p(x) can
be summed to give

to order E2. The perturbation induces an electric dipole moment (since it deforms the spherically

Problem 19 Perturbative Calculation of the Relativistic Kinetic Energy
Term in Hydrogen-Like-Atom Levels
Consider a hydrogen-like atom described by the Hamiltonian
H =
	
c

p2 + (mc)2 − mc2


− Ze2
r ,
where m is the mass of the electron and Ze is the nuclear charge, with Z 
 1. Since the typical
velocity of the electron in such a system is of the order of Zα c (here, α ≈ 1/137 is the fine structure
constant and c is the speed of light), it is physically sensible to represent the electron kinetic energy
operator by its relativistic expression.
1. Expand the kinetic energy operator in powers of [p/(m c)]
2, and show that the Hamiltonian can be
written as
H = H0 + V with H0 = p2
2m − Ze2
r
where V is the perturbation, consisting of the leading correction to the non-relativistic kinetic
energy operator. Provide an expression for V.
2. Show that the operator V can also be expressed as
V = − 1
2mc2
	
H0 +
Ze2

.
Evaluate the first-order correction to the ground-state energy (corresponding to the unperturbed
Hamiltonian H0).
3. Obtain an expression for the second-order correction E(2)
100 to the (unperturbed) ground-state
energy, ignoring the contribution of the continuum states. Explain why the sum over (discrete)
states includes only those having l = 0 (s-waves). Do not carry out the integrations explicitly;
however, reduce them to dimensional constants times non-dimensional numbers, by an appropri￾ate change of the integration variable. Express your result in terms of Z, α, and mc2.
4. Now consider the first excited level, having n = 2, which is four-fold degenerate. Obtain the first￾order corrections to the unperturbed energy 2. Does the perturbation lift the degeneracy of this
level completely or only partially? Would you expect degeneracy to persist in higher orders of
perturbation theory? Justify your answer. Compare the first-order correction in part 2 with the
corrections obtained here and order them from smallest to largest. Explain why this ordering was
to be expected.
Hints: The unperturbed bound-state energies are
n = − (Zα)2
2n2 mc2 , n = 1, 2, ... ,
where α = e2/(c) is the fine structure constant. The corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are
written as

Part 4
The first-order corrections to the first excited level follow from diagonalizing the 4 × 4 matrix in the
degenerate subspace spanned by the states |φ200 and |φ21m. Since V is a scalar operator, the matrix
elements satisfy the selection rules
φ2l
m |V|φ2lm = δl,l
 δm,m φ2lm|V|φ2lm ,
and so the matrix is diagonal. Further, the p-wave matrix elements (having l = 1) are independent of
m. This can be seen by noting that
φ21m|V|φ21m = φ21m|VL+|φ21m−1

√
2 − m(m − 1) = φ21m|L+V|φ21m−1

√
2 − m(m − 1) = φ21m−1 |V|φ21m−1 ,
where in the last step we applied L+ = L†
− to the left bra to obtain (here, L± are raising and lowering
angular momentum operators)
φ21m| L+ = (L− |φ21m)
† =

2 − m(m − 1) φ21m−1 | .

most of the contribution from the small-r region, and that R20 (x) is constant and R21 (x) ∝ x as
x −→ 0. It is also clear that the first-order correction to the ground state is larger in magnitude than
v0. Since R10 (x) and R20 (x) must be orthogonal and R10 (x) is nodeless, then R20 (x) must have a
node (which is obvious from the expression given in the text of the problem). As a consequence,
the expectation value of the positive definite operator (2 + Ze2/r)2 is smaller for the first excited
(s-wave) level than for the ground state.
Problem 20 Derivation of the Brillouin–Wigner Perturbation Theory
This problem deals with the derivation of the Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory (as opposed to
the Rayleigh–Schrodinger perturbation theory presented in ¨ Section 14.1). The starting point is the
eigenvalue problem
(Hˆ0 + Vˆ)|ψn = En |ψn ,
where the unperturbed wave function and energy, |φn and n, are assumed to be known,
Hˆ0 |φn = n |φn .
The (unknown) state |ψn is normalized as follows:
φn |ψn = 1 .
1. Define the projection operator
Qˆ n =

mn
|φmφm| = 1 − |φnφn | .
Show that
(En − Hˆ0) Qˆ n |ψn = Qˆ nVˆ|ψn
2. Noting that
|ψn = |φn + Qˆ n |ψn
satisfies the normalization condition φn |ψn = 1, show that
|ψn = |φn + Rˆn Vˆ|ψn ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press493 14.4 Problems
where the operator Rˆn is defined as follows:
Rˆn = (En − Hˆ0)
−1
Qˆ n = Qˆ n (En − Hˆ0)
−1 ,
and (··· )−1 indicates the inverse operator. Show further that the equation above can be solved by
iteration to give
|ψn = |φn + (RˆnVˆ)|φn + (RˆnVˆ)
2 |φn + (RˆnVˆ)
3 |φn + ··· ,
which can be formally summed to yield
|ψn = (1 − RˆnVˆ)
−1 |φn ,
even though this last form is not often used.
3. Show that
En = n + φn | Vˆ |ψn ,
and, hence, that
En = n + φn | Vˆ |φn +

Note that the expression above involves the unknown En on the right-hand side. Referring to this
expression, suppose you were asked to calculate En at the third perturbative order. How would
you proceed?
4. By formally expanding (En − m)−1 as
1
En − m

n − m

show that the expression above reduces to the Rayleigh–Schrodinger perturbation theory for ¨ En
up to and including third order.
5. Consider a two-state system described by
H0 =

, V =

.
Show that the Brillouin–Wigner formulation of perturbation theory yields the exact eigenvalues in
both the non-degenerate (1  2) and degenerate (1 = 2) case. What happens in the Rayleigh–
Schrodinger version? ¨
Solution
Part 1
From the eigenvalue equation satisfied by |ψn we have
(En − Hˆ0)|ψn = Vˆ|ψn .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press494 Approximation Methods
The projection operator Qˆ n commutes with Hˆ0, since
Qˆ n Hˆ0 =

mn
|φmφm| Hˆ0 =

mn
m|φmφm| = Hˆ0

mn
|φmφm| = H0 Qˆ n .
Applying Qˆ n from the left to both sides of the eigenvalue equation and using the above commutativity
property, we obtain
Qˆ n (En − Hˆ0)|ψn = (En − Hˆ0) Qˆ n |ψn = Qˆ n Vˆ|ψn .
Part 2
Using the completeness of the H0 eigenstates yields
|ψn =

m
|φmφm|ψn = cn |φn + 


mn
|φmφm|

	
|ψn ,
and the normalization condition φn |ψn = 1 then gives cn = 1, and so
|ψn = |φn + Qˆ n |ψn .
From part 1, after multiplying both sides by (En − Hˆ0)−1, it follows that
Qˆ n |ψn = (En − Hˆ0)
−1
Qˆ n Vˆ|ψn =⇒ |ψn = |φn + (En − Hˆ0)
−1
Qˆ n  Rn
Vˆ|ψn .
Since Qˆ n commutes with Hˆ0, it also commutes with any function of Hˆ0 and so
Rˆn = (En − Hˆ0)
−1
Qˆ n = Qˆ n (En − Hˆ0)
−1 .
The equation for |ψn can be solved by iteration, by setting
|ψn
(0) = |φn ,
|ψn
(1) = |φn + RˆnVˆ|φn ,
|ψn
(2) = |φn + RˆnVˆ|φn + RˆnVˆ RˆnVˆ|φn ,
and so on. Formally, the resulting geometric series can be summed to yield
|ψn =
∞
p=0
(RˆnVˆ)
p |φn = 
1 − Rˆn Vˆ
−1
|φn ,
This formal solution, even assuming convergence for the series, is not very useful, as the inverse
(1 − Rˆn Vˆ)−1 is not easily calculable.
Part 3
Starting from the eigenvalue equation satisfied by |ψn, we immediately obtain by projecting both
sides onto φn |
φn | En − Hˆ0 |ψn = φn | Vˆ |ψn =⇒ (En − n) φn |ψn  =1
= φn | Vˆ |ψn .
Now using the iterative solution obtained above, we find
En = n + φn | Vˆ |φn + φn | Vˆ Rˆn Vˆ |φn + φn | Vˆ Rˆn Vˆ Rˆn Vˆ |φn + ··· ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press495 14.4 Problems
where Rˆn can expressed as follows:
Rˆn = (En − Hˆ0)
−1

mn
|φmφm| =

mn
|φmφm|
En − m
.
Insertion of the expression above into the perturbative expansion finally leads to
En = n+φn | Vˆ |φn+

mn
φn | Vˆ |φmφm| Vˆ |φn
En − m
+

kn

mn
φn | Vˆ |φkφk | Vˆ |φmφm| Vˆ |φn
(En − k)(En − m)
+··· .
Note that the exact (unknown) energy En appears in the denominators. As an example, a calculation
up to and including third order would require setting En −→ n in the double summation term (the
last term above) and En −→ n + φn | Vˆ |φn in the single summation term, that is,
En to third order = n + φn | Vˆ |φn +

+

kn

mn
φn | Vˆ |φkφk | Vˆ |φmφm| Vˆ |φn
(n − k)(n − m) .
The expression above includes all terms up to those cubic in Vˆ.
Another method for obtaining En (in Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory) is to guess an initial
value for it (for instance, a variational estimate) and then to iterate this estimate by inserting it into
the expansion for En up to a predetermined order until convergence within an assigned tolerance is
achieved.

expansion of En vanish as there are no additional states beyond the degenerate states (in other words,
the subspace orthogonal to the degenerate subspace spanned by |φ1 and |φ2 is the null space).
Problem 21 Variational Calculation of the Ground-State Energy
in a Screened Coulomb Potential
Consider an electron (mass m and charge −e) in a multi-electron atom and assume that the
electrostatic potential felt by the electron can be adequately described by a screened Coulomb
potential of the form
V(r) = −Ze2

where R has the dimension of length. Use as a (normalized) trial wave function

where a is a free parameter, and perform a variational calculation of the ground-state energy.
Determine the condition that the screening radius must satisfy for a minimum of this energy to exist.

where x = a/(2R) and r0 = a0/Z, and a0 is the Bohr radius. The function f (x) is such that f (0) = 0 and
f (x −→ ∞) = 0, and it assumes a maximum at x0 ≈ 1.55 with f (x0) ≈ 0.528. If r0/(2R) > f (x0),
there are no solutions, suggesting that, if the screening radius is too small, there are no bound states.
For a minimum (and a bound state) to exist, we must have R > (r0/2)/ f (x0).
Problem 22 Variational Calculation of the Hydrogen Atom Ground-State Energy
Perform a variational calculation of the hydrogen atom ground state using the (spherically symmetric)
trial wave function ψT(r) = u(r; β)/r, with two possible choices for u(r, β):
u1 (x; β) = x
x2 + β2 , u2 (x; β) = x2 e−βx ,
where x = r/a0, a0 is the Bohr radius, and β is a variational parameter. Which of these two trial wave
functions provides the better variational estimate for the ground-state energy? Interpret the results.
Also, calculate the quantity
δ = 1 − |ψ0 |ψi|2 ,
where ψ0 (r) is the exact (and normalized) ground-state wave function of the hydrogen atom and
ψi(r) = ui(r; β0)/r is the (normalized) trial wave function corresponding to the optimal β0 that
minimizes the energy.

and the pre-factor happens to be the exact ground state energy. Inserting the trial wave functions

value β0 that minimizes E(β), the variational estimate E(β0) to the true ground-state energy E0, and
the overlap δ, reported in Table 14.1. The parameter δ provides a rough estimate of the difference
between the trial and true wave functions.

The wave function u1 (r) has the correct behavior at the origin (namely, it is linear in r) but incorrect
behavior at ∞ (it vanishes only as 1/r in this limit, not fast enough); nevertheless it gives the best
variational estimate for the energy. By contrast, u2 (r) falls off exponentially, and hence correctly, as
r −→ ∞ but behaves incorrectly as r −→ 0. It gives a worse variational energy than u1 (r) because
it has the wrong behavior near the origin, where the potential is strongly attractive. Interestingly,
δ1 > δ2 even though E1 (β0) < E2 (β0).

Problem 24 The Born–Oppenheimer Approximation
The purpose of this problem is to derive the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for a molecule. The
molecule consists of M nuclei of charge Zie and masses Mi with i = 1, ... , M and N electrons of mass
m with

M
i=1
Zi = N ,
so that the molecule is neutral.
1. Denote by Rˆ i and Pˆi the position and momentum operators of nucleus i, and with rˆk and pˆ k
those of electron k. Recall that [Rˆiα , Pˆjβ] = i δij δαβ and [ˆrkα , ˆplβ] = i δkl δαβ, with all other
commutators vanishing. Ignoring spin degrees of freedom, write down the Hamiltonian of the
molecule. It consists of three terms
Hˆ = Tˆ
nuc + Tˆ
el + Vˆ
where Tˆ
nuc and Tˆ
el are the kinetic energy operators for the nuclei and electrons, respectively, and
Vˆ is the potential energy operator.
2. Ignore the kinetic energy of nuclei – why is it reasonable to do so? – and explain why the
resulting Hamiltonian Hˆ = Tˆ
el +Vˆ can be diagonalized simultaneously with the position operators
Rˆ 1, ... , Rˆ M of the M nuclei. Denote the simultaneous eigenstates compactly as |ψa,R, where
|ψa,R≡|χa⊗|φR1 ⊗···⊗ |φRM  ,
and |φRi
 are the position eigenstates of nucleus i and |χa are the eigenstates of Hˆ
. The
eigenstates |ψa,R form a basis. Write down the normalization condition that they satisfy.

where hereafter R is a shorthand for R1, ... , RM. In the coordinate representation for the N

where ∇2
k is the Laplacian with respect to rk.
4. Exploiting the completeness of the basis |ψa,R introduced earlier, expand a generic eigenstate |Ψ
of the full Hamiltonian Hˆ corresponding to eigenvalue E as
|Ψ =

a

dR |ψa,R Ψa (R

|ψa,R = 0 .
This equation is exact; no approximations have been made up to until now.
5. Project the equation obtained above onto the basis of position eigenstates of the N electrons and
M nuclei,
|φr,R≡|φr⊗|φR = |φr1 ⊗···⊗ |φrN ⊗|φR1 ⊗···⊗ |φRM  ,
and show that if derivatives of the wave functions ψa (r; R) with respect to the R variables are

Ψa (R) = EΨa (R) ,
that is, the wave function Ψa (R) satisfies a Schrodinger equation in which the electronic energy ¨
Ea (R) obtained for fixed nuclear positions acts as the potential for the nuclei. This is the essence
of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Define the Hamiltonian Hˆnuc as follows:
Hˆnuc =

6. Consider the case in which Ea (R) −→ E0 (R) is the ground-state energy of the electronic
configuration. Estimates for E0 (R) can be obtained by the variational method, by minimizing the
Hamiltonian Hˆ
. Suppose that the potential E0 (R) has a minimum when the nuclei are at positions

7. Using the Hellmann–Feynman theorem derived in Problem 15, show that partial derivatives of
E0 (R) relative to the components Riα can be expressed as expectation values of corresponding
derivatives of the potential energy V(r, R), on the wave function χ0 (r; R).
8. Show that the energies of the vibrational modes of the molecule are suppressed relative to those
of the electrons by a factor (m/M)1/2, where M is a typical nuclear mass.

Part 2
Since the nuclear masses are three orders of magnitude larger than the electron mass (mp/m ≈ 1836,
mp being the proton mass), it is reasonable to ignore the nuclear kinetic energies and approximate
the full Hamiltonian by retaining only the kinetic energies of the electrons and the interaction terms,
that is,
Hˆ = Tˆ
el + Vˆ ,
where it should be noted that Hˆ depends not only on the position and momentum operators of
the individual electrons but also on the position operators of the nuclei. Since [Rˆiα , Rˆjβ] = 0 and
[Rˆiα , Hˆ
] = 0, it is possible to construct a basis of common eigenstates of all these observables. The
position eigenstates relative to Rˆ i are denoted as |φRi
, and
Rˆ i |φRi
 = Ri |φRi

|φRi = δ(Ri − R

the corresponding eigenvalues Ri form a continuum. The basis of position eigenstates for nuclei
1, ... , M consists of the tensor product |φR1 ⊗···⊗|φRM . In the state space of electrons and nuclei,
we write the simultaneous eigenstates of Hˆ and Rˆ 1,..., Rˆ M as
|ψa,R≡|χa⊗|φR1 ⊗···⊗ |φRM ≡|χa⊗|φR .

and the Laplacian acts on both the “nuclear wave function” Ψa (R) as well as on the “electronic

The electronic wave functions are orthonormal,

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press505 14.4 Problems
and we see that the electronic degrees of freedom enter the nuclear eigenvalue problem only through
the “potential” Ea (R). Of course, if derivatives of the electronic wave functions are retained then the
problem becomes much more complex, as there are then couplings between Ψa (R) and Ψa (R).

,
and the 3M × 3M matrix K has non-negative eigenvalues (it is positive definite). Up to an overall
energy shift, by the constant E0 (R0), the nuclear Hamiltonian is reduced to that for a set of 3M
coupled harmonic oscillators. On introducing normal coordinates the oscillators decouple, that is, we
arrive at a system of 3M independent oscillators (see Problem 11 in Chapter 8). We can then easily
obtain the energy spectrum of the vibrational modes of the molecule.
Part 7
We first observe that, since χa (r; R) is a normalized eigenstate of H
, the corresponding eigenvalue
Ea (R) can be obtained from

Ea (R) =

which simplifies the problem considerably, since in order to evaluate derivatives of Ea (R) we do not
need to calculate derivatives of the electronic wave functions relative to the nuclear positions.
Part 8
The typical excitation energies of electrons in molecules are similar to those in atoms; they are of
the order of e2/a0 where a0 = 2/(me2) is the Bohr radius. By contrast, the vibrational energy of the
nuclear modes is of the order  ω = (2K/M)1/2, where M is a typical nuclear mass and K is obtained
from the second derivatives of the electronic energy Ea (R). The parameter K has the dimension of
energy over (length)2, and as a consequence it is of order (e2/a0)/a2
0, that is, the ratio of the typical

electronic excitation energy divided by the square of the typical length – the Bohr radius – over which
the electronic wave function χa (r; R) changes appreciably. Thus, we obtain

Problem 25 Variational Calculation of the H+
2 Molecular Ion Binding Energy
This problem concerns the variational ground-state energy calculation of the H+
2 molecule, consisting
of two protons, to be considered fixed at positions r1 and r2, and an electron “shared” by the two
protons. Ignoring spin degrees of freedom (and hence spin–orbit interactions, magnetic interactions
between the spins of the electron and protons, etc.), here the Hamiltonian for this system is taken to
include only the Coulomb attraction between the electron and protons and the Coulomb repulsion
between the two protons:
H = p2
2m − e2
|r − r1 |
− e2
|r − r2 |
+
e2
|r1 − r2 |
,
where m is the mass of the electron and r and p are its position and momentum operators. As a trial
wave function, consider
ψT(r) = N

φ(|r − r1 |; λ) + φ(|r − r2 |; λ)

,
where N is a normalization factor, λ is a variational parameter,
φ(r; λ) =

λ3
πa3
0
e−λr/a0 ,
and a0 is the Bohr radius. Note that for λ −→ 1 the trial wave function above reduces to a linear
combination of two hydrogen atom ground-state wave functions, centered at r1 and r2. Define the
binding energy of H+
2 as
B(R; λ) = ET(R; λ) − gs
e2/(2a0)
with ET(R; λ) = ψT|H|ψT
ψT|ψT ,
where gs = −e2/(2a0) is the hydrogen atom ground-state energy, and obtain a variational binding
energy for it as a function of the distance R = |r1 − r2 |/a0 (in units of a0) between the two protons.
What do you conclude? Is the molecule bound? And if so, for what value of R is the binding energy
largest?
Now consider the expression that was derived above for B(R; λ) in the case λ = 1. It turns out that
the corresponding electronic binding energy is not much less accurate than the variational estimate.
In the spirit of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, we can interpret B(R; λ = 1) as the potential
energy, in units of e2/(2a0), between the two protons, that is,
V(R) = e2
2a0
B(R; λ = 1) .
Write down the corresponding Hamiltonian (denote the proton mass by M), and discuss how to obtain
the vibrational spectrum of the H+
2 molecule.

We note that if x < X then |x − X| = X − x and, by contrast, if x > X then |x − X| = x − X, yielding the
expression as given above.

In the limit in which one proton is very far from the other proton, the H+
2 molecule ground￾state energy should reduce to that of an isolated hydrogen atom, that is, gs = −e2/(2a0), so gs
represents the minimum energy required to disassociate the H+
2 molecular ion. In units of e2/(2a0),
we conveniently define the molecular binding energy as
B(R; λ) = ET(R; λ) − gs

Note that, for R 
 1, the function B(R 
 1; λ) −→ (λ − 1)2 and so in this limit we must have λ = 1,
yielding a vanishing binding energy. For each R, let λ∗ (R) be the λ-value that minimizes B(R; λ). We
denote the corresponding energy by B∗ (R), which then represents the variational estimate. It is plotted
in Fig. 14.1 along with B(R; λ = 1). We find that the minimum of B∗ (R) occurs for R0 = 2.0a0 = 1.06×
10−8 cm, which is the equilibrium separation between the two protons (the λ-value at R0 is 1.239).
The corresponding energy is B∗
0 = −0.173 in units of e2/(2a0), or approximately we have B∗
0 =−2.35
eV. These values compare well with the experimental values, respectively, Rexp

Problem 26 Estimating Bound-State Energies of a Hamiltonian
with the Variational Method
We are interested in estimating the bound-state energies of a Hamiltonian H with the variational
method. Let φi(r) with i = 1, ... , n be a set of linearly independent and square integrable functions.
We will assume that these functions are also orthonormal without loss of generality; this can always
be accomplished by Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization of the φi(r). Consider the trial wave function
ψ(r) =
n
i=1
ciφi(r) ,
where the (generally complex) parameters ci are to be determined by the variational method.
1. Since the ci are generally complex, we minimize H by independently varying the ci and c∗
i (which
is equivalent to independently varying the real and imaginary parts of ci). Show that this procedure
leads to the following set of equations:
n
j=1
Hijcj = Hci, i = 1, ... , n ,
and a second set of equations that are equivalent to those above since H is hermitian. Here, we
have defined
Hij = φi|H|φj =

dr φ∗
i (r) H φj(r) , H ≡ ψ|H|ψ
ψ|ψ .
2. Denote the (presently unknown) real expectation value H as E; then, the linear system above
reduces to the following eigenvalue problem:
n
j=1
Hijcj = Eci, i = 1, ... , n .

Let ψk (r) with k = 1, ... , n be the optimal trial wave functions,
ψk (r) =
n
i=1
c(k)
i φi(r) ,
where in matrix notation
H c(k) = E
k c(k) .
Show that the matrix elements of H are diagonal if the set of optimal trial wave functions ψk (r) is
used, namely, that ψk |H|ψl = E
k δkl. Hereafter, assume that the eigenvalues of the n × n matrix
H have been ordered, so that
E
1 ≤ E
2 ≤ ··· ≤ E
n−1 ≤ E
n .
Of course, some of these E
k may be the same (degenerate).
3. An additional function φn+1 (r) is added to the set ψ1 (r), ... , ψn (r); it can be chosen to be
normalized and orthogonal to the ψk (r), that is, ψk |φn+1 = 0 for k = 1, ... , n. Show that the
eigenvalue problem has a non-trivial solution if
Dn+1 (E) = det

4. The characteristic equation Dn+1 (E) = 0 in part 3 has n+1 solutions. The values of the determinants
Dn+1 (E) for E = E
k and for E = E
k+1 can be shown to have opposite signs, provided E
k < E
k+1.
Hence, there must be a zero of Dn+1 (E) = 0 between E
k and E
k+1. It can also be shown that there
are two additional roots, one less than E
1 and the other greater than E
n. Since there are n+1 roots of
the characteristic equation, n – 1 roots lie in the intervals [E
1, E
2], [E
2, E
3], ... , [E
n−1, E
n], and the
two additional roots lie respectively below and above the old spectrum. Prove these statements.
The procedure described above is known as the Rayleigh–Ritz variational method. It provides
approximate upper bounds to the lowest n eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The bounds can be
improved by choosing larger and larger values of n. The limit n −→ ∞ is equivalent to solving for
the exact eigenvalues of H. However, given a set of initial functions φi(r), it is difficult to establish
whether convergence to the exact eigenvalues will be achieved slowly or rapidly (of course, it will
be rapid if the φi(r) are close to the eigenfunctions of H).
Solution

We express the (real) expectation value of H as
H = ψ|H|ψ
ψ|ψ =

l=1 c∗

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press513 14.4 Problems
and in the denominator of H we have used the fact that the set of φl(r) is orthonormal. We minimize
H with respect to independent variations of the cl and c∗
l (which is equivalent to minimizing with
respect to the real and imaginary parts of cl, respectively cl + c∗
l and cl − c∗
l ). We find

which is equivalent to the eigenvalue problem
n
m=1
Him cm = ci H
in the n-dimensional subspace spanned by the φi(r). Minimizing with respect to the ci yields
n
m=1
Hmi c∗
m = c∗
i H ,
which can be obtained from the previous eigenvalue problem by taking the complex conjugate of
both sides and using the fact that H is hermitian and hence H∗
im = Hmi. Thus, it is enough to consider
one of these eigenvalue problems.
Part 2
The problem is now reduced to the diagonalization of the n×n matrix H. The eigenvalues result from
the roots of the characteristic equation (here E = H)
det(H − E I) = 0 .
This equation has n roots E
k (eigenvalues), some of which may be the same (degenerate). The
corresponding normalized eigenvectors |ψk consist of the linear combinations
|ψk =
n
i=1
c(k)

and the matrix is diagonal in this basis.
Part 3
We expand the set by adding a single state |φn+1, which we choose to be orthogonal to all |ψl and
normalized, that is, φn+1 |φn+1 = 1. Now, we define the projectors
P =
n
l=1
|ψlψl| , Q = 1 − P ,
where P projects states onto the subspace spanned by the |ψ1, ... , |ψn and Q projects states onto
the complement of this subspace. Clearly, we have
P|ψl = |ψl , Q|ψl = 0 , P |φn+1 = 0 , Q |φn+1 = |φn+1 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press514 Approximation Methods
The full Hamiltonian can be written as
H = (P + Q)H(P + Q) = PHP + PHQ + QHP + QHQ .
In the P-subspace H is diagonal, since
ψl|PHP + PHQ + QHP + QHQ|ψm = ψl|PHP|ψm = ψl|H|ψm = E
l δl,m .
Note that H |ψl  E
l |ψl, since H is the Hamiltonian in the full space. However, we have for the
Hamiltonian restricted to the P-space,
PHP =

l=1
E
l |ψlψl| .
Similarly, we find
ψl |PHP + PHQ + QHP + QHQ|φn+1 = ψl |PHQ|φn+1 = ψl |H|φn+1 = Hl,n+1
and
φn+1 |H|ψl = H∗

and so on (namely, the signs alternate). Now, there are n + 1 roots of the characteristic equation
since Dn+1 (E) is a polynomial of order n + 1 in E. Being a polynomial, Dn+1 (E) is also
a continuous function, and therefore at least n – 1 of these roots must lie in the intervals
[E
1, E
2], [E
2, E
3], ... , [E
n−1, E
n]. There are two more roots: one must be less than E
1 and the other
larger than E
n. To show this, we note that the leading power of E in the polynomial Dn+1 (E) is
(−1)n+1 En+1. It follows that, for E sufficiently large and negative, that is, E −→ −∞, Dn+1 (E) is
positive and hence there must be a root below E
1, since Dn+1 (E
1) is negative (there is a change of
sign of the polynomial between −∞ and E
1). However, in the limit E −→ ∞, the sign of Dn+1 (E)
is (−1)n+1, that is, it is positive or negative depending on whether n is respectively odd or even. By
contrast, the sign of Dn+1 (E
n) is (−1)n, and therefore there is another change of sign between E
n and
∞, requiring the presence of a root above E
n.
In the above argument, we have tacitly assumed that the eigenvalues E
k are all non-degenerate. In
the presence of degeneracy, the conclusions above remain valid. As an extreme case, suppose that
the E
k are all degenerate, that is, E
k = E
; the determinant Dn+1 (E) is then given by
Dn+1 (E) = (E − E)

We have already analyzed scattering phenomena in one dimension. Here, we extend the treatment
to three dimensions, introduce the concept of the scattering cross section, and relate the latter to the
asymptotic behavior of the wave function.
In a scattering process, a beam consisting of particles of type 1 collides with a target consisting
of particles of type 2. The products of the collisions between particles 1 and 2 – that is, the particles
produced in the final state – are measured by detectors situated far from the region of space where the
collisions have occurred. The detectors measure properties of the final-state particles (their energies,
momenta, charges, etc.).
Scattering phenomena can be complex. For example, if particles 1 and 2 are not elementary but
have a substructure (such as nuclei, which are made up of protons and neutrons, which in turn are
made up of quarks and gluons), then in a collision their constituents can rearrange themselves into
two or more composite particles that are different from 1 and 2. Similarly, if the energy of the beam
particles is high enough then part of this energy can be converted into the creation of new particles,
in fact a great many of them if the energy is very high.
The description of these complex scattering processes is outside the scope of the present textbook.
In this section, we will concern ourselves with the simpler, but nevertheless physically relevant, case
of elastic scattering, the process 1 + 2 −→ 1 + 2, where the initial and final state are composed of
the same particles and their substructure (if they have one) is left unchanged during the collision.
We will assume that the interaction between particles 1 and 2 can be described (in the coordinate
representation) by a potential energy operator V(r1 − r2) that depends only on the relative positions
of particles 1 and 2. We will further assume that (i) the target is thin enough to avoid multiple
scattering, that is, processes in which particle 1 suffers multiple collisions with particles of type
2 before leaving the target and (ii) coherence effects,1 that is, effects produced by destructive or
constructive interference between waves scattered by different particles in the target (such as the
Bragg reflection phenomenon mentioned at the end of the introduction to Chapter 2).
15.1 Cross Section and Scattering Wave Function
In a scattering experiment a beam of particles, all with the same momentum and energy, collides
with a target. We define the incident flux Fi as the number of beam particles crossing a unit surface
perpendicular to the beam direction per unit time,
Fi = ni v, (15.1)
1 This requires that the wavelength associated with the scattered-particle wave is small compared with the distance between
particles in the target.
516
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press517 15.1 Cross Section and Scattering Wave Function
where ni is the number of beam particles per unit volume and v is the magnitude of the velocity
relative to the target (its direction specifies the beam direction). We assume implicitly that the
mutual interactions between beam particles are negligible, and that they undergo their collisions
independently of each other. We place a detector far from the region where the collisions have
occurred. The detector is positioned in a direction specified by the polar angles θ and φ relative to
the beam direction, and subtends a solid angle dΩ (the “collision region” dimensions are negligible,
since the detector is far from it). We then count the number dns of particles scattered per unit time
into the solid angle dΩ about the direction specified by θ and φ. This number must be proportional
to the incident flux and to dΩ (obviously, if Fi and/or dΩ increase then dns increases),
dns = Fi σ(θ, φ) dΩ , (15.2)
and the constant of proportionality, which will generally depend on θ and φ, is known as the
differential scattering cross section. Since Fi has dimensions of 1/(area×time) and dns has dimensions
of 1/time, the differential cross section has dimensions of an area.
Having defined the cross section, we now need to connect it to solutions of the Schrodinger ¨
equation. We assume that the interaction of a beam particle with a particle in a target is described
by a potential that depends on their relative positions. We can then use center-of-mass and relative
variables to reduce the problem to that of the scattering of a particle of (reduced) mass μ from a center
of force situated at the origin of the coordinate system. We will assume that the potential vanishes,
namely as r −→ ∞ faster than 1/r
lim
r→∞ rV(r) = 0 . (15.3)
This condition defines what we mean by a “short-range” potential. Scattering in a Coulomb potential
must be treated separately. The Schrodinger equation is written as ¨

∇2 + k2

ψk(r) = v(r) ψk(r) , v(r) = 2μ
2 V(r) , k2 = 2μ
2 E . (15.4)
It might have bound-state solutions that vanish as r −→ ∞ and are therefore normalizable. We are not
interested in those here. It will certainly have a continuum of solutions having E > 0 (or k > 0). As
we will see below, we can relate the differential cross section to the continuum solutions that behave
asymptotically:
ψk(r) = eik·r + fk(θ, φ)
eik r
r as r −→ ∞ . (15.5)
In the asymptotic region the wave function consists of a plane wave and a spherical wave eikr/r
modulated by a function fk(Ω). In fact, this function is precisely the scattering amplitude, and the
differential cross section is given by (see below)
σk(Ω) = | fk(Ω)|
2 . (15.6)
Before proceeding any further we need (i) to show that the asymptotic solution above does indeed
satisfy the Schrodinger equation (in the asymptotic limit) and (ii) to derive the connection between ¨
the cross section and fk (Ω). The first issue is settled in Problem 1, while to address the second issue
we proceed in two steps. We first introduce the wave packet

where we have assumed that k is along the z-axis and that the profile function g(k) is real, for
simplicity, and strongly peaked at k0. Since the wave packet is a superposition of solutions ψkzˆ (r),
it obviously satisfies the Schrodinger equation. In the asymptotic region, we have the sum of two ¨
terms, an incident and a scattered wave packet,
Ψ(|r| −→ ∞, t) =

dk g(k) e−iEt/ eikz

These wave packets are largest when the phase factor in the integrand is stationary around k0 (the
stationary phase method, see Section 2.1). This requires that the incident wave packet satisfies (recall
that g(k) is real)
d
dk (kz − Et/) 

k=k0
≈ 0 =⇒ zi(t) ≈ (k0/μ)t , (15.9)
and so the center of the incident wave packet travels along the z-axis with a velocity given by
k0/m = p0/m. On the other hand, for the scattered wave packet we have
Ψs(r, t) =

dk g(k) e−iEt/ | fkzˆ (Ω)| eiχkzˆ (Ω) eik r
r , fkzˆ (Ω) = | fkzˆ (Ω)| eiχkzˆ (Ω) , (15.10)
since fkzˆ (Ω) is a generally complex function of k and Ω. We therefore find that

, (15.11)
and the center of the scattered wave particle in the direction Ω is located at a distance rs(t) from the
center of force. Since rs(t) must be large and positive, there is no scattered wave packet as t −→ −∞
(rs(t) would be large and negative!). Therefore, in this limit only the incident wave packet is present:
it approaches the scattering region traveling from z −→ −∞. On the other hand, for t −→ ∞ both
wave packets are present; the incident wave packet continues to travel along the z-axis while the
scattered wave packet propagates in all directions as a spherical wave emanating from the center of
force.
Having clarified the interpretation of the two terms present in the asymptotic form of ψk(r), we
calculate the probability current densities associated with the incident plane wave and scattered
spherical wave.2 We find, for the plane wave, ji = k/μ, a result independent of r, while for the
scattered wave the component along rˆ is given by

15.2 Integral Equation for Scattering, Lippmann–Schwinger
Equation, and Born Approximation
In this section, we derive a relation between the scattering amplitude fk(Ω) and the the wave
function ψk(r), which turns out to be useful for developing a perturbative expansion for fk(Ω) (see
Problem 9). The first step in the derivation consists in converting the Schrodinger equation into an ¨
integral equation. Suppose that we can find a function Gk (r, r
) – the Green’s function – such that

∇2 + k2

Gk (r, r
) = −δ(r − r
) , (15.14)
where the Laplacian ∇2 acts on r (and not on r
). We then write ψk(r) as follows:
ψk(r) = eik·r −

dr Gk (r, r
) v(r
) ψk(r
) . (15.15)
It is now easily verified that ψk(r), as given above, satisfies the Schrodinger equation ¨

where we have used the fact that ∇2 eik·r = −k2 eik·r and have passed 
∇2 + k2

under the integral
sign, since it acts on the unprimed variables.
The second step in the derivation consists in showing that the solution of this integral equation
satisfies the asymptotic boundary condition
ψk(r) = eik·r + fk(Ω)
eik r
r as r −→ ∞ . (15.17)
For this we need the explicit form of the Green’s function. It can be expressed as the following
Fourier transform (η −→ 0 at the end), which can be evaluated by contour integration, as detailed in
Problem 8; here, we only quote the result,
Gk (r, r
) =

q2 − k2 − iη = 1
4π
eik|r−r |

dr eik|r−r |
|r − r|
v(r
) ψk(r
) , (15.19)
which is fully equivalent to the Schrodinger equation with, as shown next, the additional advantage ¨
of automatically incorporating the correct asymptotic behavior of ψk(r). We note that, because of
the presence of the short-range potential v(r
), which is negligible for |r
|  R, the r integration is
in practice confined to a finite sphere of radius R. In the asymptotic region |r| 
 R, we can therefore
expand |r − r
| as

where the θ and φ dependences of the scattering on the right-hand side amplitude are implicit
the direction of the unit vector rˆ = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) on the right-hand side. The last
expression makes it clear that fk(Ω) can be viewed as the matrix element of the potential operator –
recall that v(r) = (2μ/2) V(r) – between the initial scattering state ψk(r) and a final free-particle
state of momentum k = k rˆ. The energy of this final state is the same as the energy of the initial state,
since
E = 2k 2
2μ = 2k2
2μ = E , (15.24)
which is of course in line with the fact that we are dealing with elastic scattering. These relations
are exact, albeit in their present forms they are not useful for the calculation of fk(Ω), since they
require a knowledge of ψk(r) in the region r  R where the potential is effective, and not just of its
asymptotic behavior.
The above treatment is suitable for a potential that vanishes faster than 1/r as r −→ ∞. The
Coulomb potential is therefore excluded and must be dealt with separately. We will not discuss it here
(we refer the reader to A. Messiah (1961). Quantum Mechanics, North Holland), but will just note
that Coulomb-scattering wave functions ψC
k (r) follow from solutions of the Schrodinger equation ¨

The differential cross section is independent of the signs of the colliding charges. It is also
independent of the azimuthal angle φ and is therefore symmetric about the incident axis; it falls
off as 1/E2 as the relative energy (see Eq. (15.24)). In particular, it diverges as 1/θ4 in the forward
direction, where θ ≈ 0. As a consequence the total cross section obtained by integrating over θ and
φ is divergent. This divergence is characteristic of the pure 1/r Coulomb field. In nature such a field
never occurs. For example, in the scattering of a charged particle by a nucleus, the Coulomb field due
to the nucleus is screened by that of opposite sign generated by the orbiting atomic electrons, so that
at distances large relative to the dimensions of the atom, the potential felt by the incoming charged
particle effectively vanishes.
There is an interesting rewriting of the integral equation (15.15) known as the Lippmann–
Schwinger equation. To obtain it, we first note that the Green’s function (times 2μ/2) can be
expressed as
2μ

Eq − Ek − iη
, (15.28)
where we have defined an energy Eq = 2q2/(2μ) and it is understood that η −→ 0. We can reinterpret
Eq. (15.28) as the coordinate-space representation of an operator, since

where we have used the completeness relation for the basis of momentum eigenstates |φq and the
fact that these states are also eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian, Hˆ0 |φq = Eq |φq. The integral

and, using the completeness of the position eigenstates, reduces to
|ψk = |φk +

Ek − Hˆ0 + iη
Vˆ |ψk , (15.31)
the Lippmann–Schwinger equation precisely. It is equivalent to the Schrodinger equation ¨ (Hˆ0 +
Vˆ)|ψk = Ek |ψk, as can easily be verified by applying the operator Ek − Hˆ0 to both sides and using
the fact that the free-particle state |φk is an eigenstate of Hˆ0 with eigenvalue Ek. However, it has
the advantage that it includes the correct asymptotic behavior for the wave function ψk(r). The
Lippmann–Schwinger equation can be solved by iteration,

and the scattering amplitude is seen to be proportional to the matrix element of the operator Tˆ (known
as the T-matrix) between initial and final plane-wave states. The definition above makes it clear that
Tˆ satisfies the following equation:
Tˆ = Vˆ + Vˆ 1
Ek − Hˆ0 + iη
Tˆ . (15.34)
In the perturbative expansion of Eq. (15.33), the leading-order correction to the scattering amplitude

The BA is simply given by the Fourier transform of the potential. Here, q is the momentum transfer,
where
q2 = 


2 = 2k2 − 2k2 cos θ = 4k2 sin2 θ/2 , (15.36)
and the dependence of f BA
k (Ω) on the scattering angles comes via the dependence on q. If we now
assume that V(r) has rotational symmetry, that is, it only depends on the magnitude of the relative
position vector, then the Born amplitude is real, since

15.3 Scattering by a Central Potential: Phase-Shift Method
We now turn our attention to the case in which the potential V(r) has spherical symmetry. We can then
expand the scattering wave function in a basis of simultaneous eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian,
the square of the angular momentum operator L, and its z-component Lz,
ψkzˆ (r) =

and v(r) = 2μV(r)/2 −→ 0 as r −→ ∞. We are interested in the solutions for positive energy
2k2/(2μ) = E > 0. They form a continuum; for fixed E, there is infinite degeneracy, since
l = 0, 1, 2, ... and m = −l, ... , l. The boundary conditions satisfied by ukl(r) are (assuming that
r2v(r) −→ 0 as r −→ 0, see Section 9.2)
ukl(r) ∼ r
l+1 as r −→ 0 (15.42)
and
ukl(r) = akl sin(kr − lπ/2 + δkl) as r −→ ∞ , (15.43)
where the factor lπ/2 is included for convenience. Equation (15.43) follows from the asymptotic
form of the radial equation, which reads
u
kl(r) + k2
ukl(r) = 0 as r −→ ∞ . (15.44)
The constant akl and so-called phase shift δkl (for fixed k and l) are obtained by matching the wave
function ψkzˆ (r) of Eq. (15.40) to the asymptotic form given in Eq. (15.17). As we will see, this allows
us to relate the scattering amplitude to the phase shifts δkl. But, before establishing this connection,
we need to briefly examine the free-particle problem.
The solution ukl(r) of the radial equation for a free particle – set v(r) = 0 in Eq. (15.41) – is
proportional to the regular spherical Bessel function r jl(kr) (see Problem 8 in Chapter 10 and
Problem 17 in the present chapter, which are relevant to the present discussion), and the wave
functions
φklm(r) = bkl jl(kr) Ylm(Ω) (15.45)
form a basis of simultaneous eigenfunctions of the free-particle Hamiltonian, L2, and Lz with
eigenvalues given by 2k2/(2μ), l(l + 1)2, and m, respectively. The basis is continuous, and the
“normalization constants” bkl are determined by requiring that

dr φ∗
klm(r) φkl
m (r) = δ(k − k
) δll δmm , (15.46)
which, because of the orthonormality of the Ylm(Ω) implies that, since the jl(kr) are real functions,
|bkl|
2
 ∞
0
dr r2 jl(kr) jl(k
r) = δ(k − k
) . (15.47)
Up to an irrelevant phase factor, bkl is independent of l and is explicitly given by bkl =
√
2/π k (a clear
derivation of this result and others relating to free-particle wave functions is provided in Chapter
VIII of C. Cohen-Tannoudji, B. Diu, and F. Laloe ( ¨ 1997). Quantum Mechanics, Wiley).
Next, we want to relate the continuous basis of eigenfunctions eik·r of the momentum operator
to the continuous basis consisting of the eigenfunctions φklm(r). Since the plane waves are also
eigenfunctions of the free-particle Hamiltonian, we must have
eik·r =

l=0

l
m=−l
clm(k, Ωk) φklm(r) =
∞
l=0

l
m=−l
bkl clm(k, Ωk) jl(kr) Ylm(θ, φ) with |k| = k ,
(15.48)
where Ωk specifies the angles θk and φk of the direction kˆ. Thus a given momentum eigenfunction
is generally a linear superposition of all possible angular momentum eigenfunctions. In particular, if
kˆ is taken to be along the z-axis, which we indicate with Ωk = 0 so that the expansion coefficient is
clm(k, 0) in this case, then only m = 0 terms can occur on the right-hand side of Eq. (15.48), since the
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press524 Scattering by a Potential
left-hand side is independent of the angle φ; recall that Ylm(θ, φ) is proportional to Pm
l (cos θ) eimφ.
Hence, the expansion simplifies to

where Pl(x) is a Legendre polynomial and the combination √

equal i
l
(2l + 1). This expansion can be generalized to the case where k, rather than being along the
z-axis, is in a generic direction specified by Ωk. In that case, θ is interpreted as the angle between the
directions kˆ and rˆ, that is, cos θ −→ cos θkr = kˆ · rˆ, and we obtain

Pl(cos θkr) =

We now return to the problem of matching the wave function of Eq. (15.40) to the asymptotic form
given in Eq. (15.17). Because of the spherical symmetry of the problem, the scattering amplitude is
independent of φ, fkzˆ (Ω) = fkzˆ (θ), and therefore it can be expanded in Legendre polynomials:
fkzˆ (θ) =
∞
l=0
fkl Pl(cos θ) . (15.52)
In the asymptotic region the wave function can be written as

In order for this to match ψkzˆ (r) of Eq. (15.40), only terms with m = 0 must enter in the expansion;
namely, the wave function must be independent of φ, so that
ψkzˆ (r, θ) =
∞
l=0
ukl(r)
r Pl(cos θ) , (15.54)
where we have absorbed the factor √
(2l + 1)/(4π) from Yl0 (θ) into ukl(r), which is permissible since
ukl(r) satisfies a homogenous equation. Given ukl(r) = akl sin(kr − lπ/2 + δkl), this matching yields
(see Problem 10)
akl = i

4π
k2 (2l + 1) , (15.60)
which is reached when (and if) δkl = nπ/2 with n a (positive or negative) odd integer. Further, while
in principle the sum in σk extends over all partial waves, in fact for a short-range potential we expect
only the lowest-l waves to contribute appreciably at a given energy. To see how this comes about,
suppose that v(r) vanishes for r  R. Reasoning classically for the time being, the magnitude of the
(conserved) angular momentum is given by L = |r×p| = bp, where p is the momentum of the particle
when it is at r 
 R and b = rsin θ is the impact parameter, the distance of closest approach to the
center of force. If b  R then the classical trajectory of the particle will be unaffected by the potential
and will continue as a straight line. This condition can be expressed as b/R = L/(R p)  1. Quantum
mechanically, we have L = 
√
l(l + 1) and p = k, and therefore the condition reads

l(l + 1)  kR . (15.61)
Therefore, for a given energy E = 2k2/(2μ), only partial waves with l  kR will be affected by
the potential. As the energy increases, partial waves of progressively higher order will contribute to
the cross section; conversely, as the energy decreases, the contribution of the l = 0 partial wave (the
s-wave) will become dominant. This conclusion could also have been inferred from the behavior
of the radial wave function for small r, ukl(r) ∝ rl+1. Clearly, for large l the wave function will be
suppressed at small r and will not feel the presence of the potential.
The procedure for obtaining the phase shifts and hence the differential cross section is straightfor￾ward. For a given energy E = 2k2/(2μ) > 0, we solve the radial equation (15.41) with the boundary
condition at the origin ukl(r) ∝ rl+1. Since v(r) is short range, there is an R such that v(r  R) is
negligible. For r  R we have a free particle, and therefore the radial wave function ψkl(r)= ukl(r)/r
reduces to a linear combination of the regular and irregular spherical Bessel functions, respectively
jl(kr) and nl(kr), which we write as
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press526 Scattering by a Potential
Akl jl(kr) − Bkl nl(kr) for r  R . (15.62)
In order to determine the constants Akl and Bkl (for fixed k and l), we “match” ψkl(r  R) to the
linear combination above, that is, we require that ψkl(r) and its first derivative are continuous at
some (arbitrary) R0 > R,
ψkl(R0) = Akl jl(x0) − Bkl nl(x0) , ψ
kl(R0) = Akl k j
l(x0) − Bkl k n
l(x0), (15.63)
where x0 = kR0. This leads to an inhomogeneous linear system in the unknowns Akl and Bkl, which is
easily solved to give
Akl = k n
l
(x0) ψkl(R0) − nl(x0) ψ

Having determined Akl and Bkl, the phase shift is easily obtained as
δkl = tan−1 (Bkl/Akl) . (15.65)
To see how this comes about, insert the asymptotic behavior of the spherical Bessel functions, to
obtain
lim
r→∞[Akl jl(kr) − Bkl nl(kr)] = Akl
sin(kr − lπ/2)
kr + Bkl
cos(kr − lπ/2)
kr = Ckl
sin(kr − lπ/2 + δkl)
kr ,
(15.66)
with
Ckl cos δkl = Akl , Ckl sin δkl = Bkl , (15.67)
and Eq. (15.66) shows that ψkl(r) has the expected asymptotic behavior of Eq. (15.43), except for the
normalization. By inserting the solutions for Akl and Bkl found earlier, we obtain the phase shift as
δkl = tan−1

where we have defined the logarithmic derivative
Δkl = ψ

ψkl(R0) . (15.69)
Now, all we need to determine the phase shift is the value of the logarithmic derivative of the radial
wave function at a point R > R0, where the potential is negligible. In order to match the normalization
constant in Eq. (15.55), we need to rescale ψkl(r) by the factor i

Problem 2 Born Approximation for Scattering in Yukawa and Coulomb Potentials
The central component of the nuclear potential between proton and neutron has the Yukawa form
VY(r) = V0 e−r/λ/r, where the parameter λ with the dimension of length is related to the pion mass
via λ = /(mπc) (here c is the speed of light; λ is known as the Compton wavelength of the pion).
Calculate the amplitude and differential cross section for scattering in the Born approximation (BA).
Noting that the attractive or repulsive Coulomb potential between particles of charges ±Z1e and ±Z2e
is proportional to VY(r) in the limit λ −→ ∞, obtain the BA amplitude and differential cross section
for Coulomb scattering.
Solution
The BA differential cross section is given by σBA
k (Ω) = | f BA
k (Ω)|

reads

2μE/2 (μ is the reduced mass). For a spherically symmetric potential,
as is the case here, the Fourier transform depends only on the magnitude of the momentum transfer
and is given by

It is independent of the azimuthal angle φ, as is always the case for a central potential, and decreases
as θ varies from the forward to the backward direction, or equivalently as the momentum transfer q
varies from 0 at θ = 0 to its maximum allowed value 2k at θ = π.
The Coulomb potential between two charged particles is given by VC(r) = ± Z1Z2e2/r, where the +
(−) sign corresponds to the particles having charges of the same (opposite) sign. The BA amplitude
and differential cross section can be obtained by setting V0 = ± Z1Z2e2 and by taking the limit
λ −→ ∞ in the Yukawa expressions. We find

It turns out that σC,k (Ω) is the exact result (the Rutherford differential cross section): an exact solution
of the Coulomb scattering problem leads to an amplitude that differs from the BA solution simply
by a phase factor; this phase factor becomes irrelevant when one is evaluating the differential cross
section (see Section 15.2).
Problem 3 Born Approximation for Scattering in a Gaussian Potential
Consider a particle of mass μ in the central potential V(r) = V0 e−r2/a2

Because of the spherical symmetry of the potential, the Fourier transform depends only on the

Problem 5 On the Validity of the Born Approximation
Determine under what conditions the Born approximation (BA) is valid in the low- and high-energy
limits, by considering the ratio of the first-order correction ψ(1)
k (r) and the leading-order term
ψ(0)
k (r) = eik·r in the scattering wave function. Assume that the potential V(r) is largest when the
particles are close to each, that is, when r ≈ 0.
Solution
The first-order correction ψ(1)
k (r) to the scattering wave function is given by
ψ(1)
k (r) = − 1

dr eik|r−r |

We expect the BA to be valid when |ψ(1)

k (r)|  1. When r is very large and therefore the
incident and target particles are far from each other, we have
ψ(1)
k (r) ≈ f BA(Ω)
eikr
r ,
and the ratio above always vanishes as | f BA(Ω)|/r −→ 0 in the limit r −→ ∞. By contrast, when r is
in the region where the potential is most effective, namely, when the incident and target particles are
close to each other, that is, r ≈ 0, then ψ(0)
k (0) = 1 and
ψ(1)

It turns out this is a sufficient but not a necessary condition. For example, in the case of the Coulomb

validity of the BA under the two different regimes, of low and high energy.

Problem 7 Integral Equation for Bound States

Because of the presence of the “short-range” potential v(r
), which is negligible for r  R, the r
integration is in practice confined to a finite sphere of radius R. In asymptotic region r 
 R, we can
therefore expand |r − r

Problem 8 Derivation of the Scattering and Bound-State Green’s Functions
Obtain the scattering and bound-state Green’s functions by solving the inhomogeneous partial

where the Laplacians act on the unprimed variables.
Hint: By translational invariance the Green’s functions can only be functions of x = r−r
. Introduce
the Fourier transforms of Gk (x) and δ(x) and solve the equation in wave-number space. Fourier￾transform back to configuration space by first shifting the singularity at k away from the real axis by
the replacement k −→ k + iη and then taking the limit η −→ 0.
Solution
Because of translational invariance, Gk (r, r
) depends only on the difference r−r rather than on r and
r separately. This can also be seen directly from the defining relation by introducing the variables
x = r − r
, so that ∇2
x = ∇2 by the chain rule and

 dq
(2π)3 eiq·x ,

Fig. 15.1 Contour integration.
Gk (q) is singular at q = k, and, as such, its Fourier transform is not well defined. To remove the
singularity, we shift the pole off the real axis by setting k −→ k + iη, so that
Gk (x) =

and the initial three-dimensional integral is now reduced to a one-dimensional integral over the whole
real axis. Standard contour integration can be employed, see Fig. 15.1. The integrand has simple
poles at q = ±(k + iη). Since x = |x| > 0, we must close the contour in the upper half plane, and
therefore we pick up the residue at the pole q = k + iη, that is
Gk (x) = − i

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press536 Scattering by a Potential
Before moving on, we should note that we could have chosen to shift the pole off the real axis by
setting k −→ k − iη (rather than k + iη). Proceeding along the same lines as above, we would have
found the Green’s function
G(−)
k (x) = e−ikx
4πx ,
which has an incoming rather than an outgoing spherical wave. Thus we are forced to select the first
option, in order for Eq. (15.15) to match the asymptotic behavior of Eq. (15.17).
In the case of the bound-state Green’s function, the inversion of the Fourier transform poses no
problem,
Gb (x) =
 dq
(2π)3 eiq·x 1
q2 + κ2

,
since the integrand has no singularity on the real axis. Following the manipulations above, we write
Gb (x) as
Gb (x) = − i
4π2x

−∞
dq q eiqx
q2 + κ2
b
.
By integrating over the upper half plane, we pick up the residue at the simple pole q = iκb, and hence
Gb (x) = e−κbx
4πx .
We could also have obtained this result directly from Gk (x) by the replacement k −→ iκb.
Problem 9 Perturbative Expansion of the Scattering Wave Function and Scattering Amplitude
Obtain a perturbative expansion for the scattering wave function ψk(r) and scattering amplitude
fk(Ω), starting from the integral equation satisfied by ψk(r). Devise a diagrammatic representation
of the terms in the expansion for fk(Ω).
Solution
The integral equation
ψk(r) = eik·r −

) v(r
) ψk(r
) , Gk (r, r
) = eik|r−r |

,
can be solved by iteration to obtain a perturbative expansion for ψk(r),
ψk(r) = ψ(0)
k (r) + ψ(1)
k (r) + ψ(2)
k (r) + ··· ,
where
ψ(0)
k (r) = eik·r ,

k (r) = −

and so on. The general term of order n has the form

eik·rn ,
and involves the nth power of the potential. If v(r) is sufficiently weak, an accurate expression
for ψk(r) can be obtained by only keeping the first few lowest-order corrections. The expansion
above suggests that the total wave at r results from the superposition of the incident plane wave
and an infinite number of waves coming from secondary sources and induced by the potential
(this interpretation recalls Huygens’ principle in wave optics). For example, the second-order term
represents the wave at r induced by a secondary wave generated at r1 by v(r1), which in turn was
induced by a secondary wave generated at r2 by v(r2).
Inserting the above expansion into the scattering amplitude
fk(Ω) = − 1
4π

dr e−ikrˆ·r

yields a corresponding expansion for fk(Ω),

A term of given order n in the expansion of fk(Ω) can be represented diagrammatically in the
following way: (i) draw n vertices labeled 1, ... , n and connect them by n – 1 line segments (say,
r1 to r2, r2 to r3, ..., rn−1 to rn), each segment representing the Green’s function (or propagator)
Gk (ri, rj); (ii) at each vertex i include the potential v(ri); (iii) the external line segment coming
into rn represents the incoming plane wave eik·rn , while the external line segment going out of
r1 represents the outgoing plane wave e−ik·r1 ; (iv) integrate over all vertices  dr1 ··· drn and
multiply the resulting expression by the factor (−1)n/(4π).

Problem 11 Low-Energy Behavior of the Phase Shifts
Starting from Eq. (15.68), establish the general behavior of the phase shifts δkl in the limit of low
energies. Note that this energy dependence enters via the spherical Bessel functions as well as the
logarithmic derivative of the wave function. The small −x behaviors of jl(x) and nl(x) are given by,
respectively,
jl(x) = xl

.
Solution
The energy dependence of the radial wave function, and hence of its logarithmic derivative, comes
in via the term k2 ukl(r) in the Schrodinger equation. However, as ¨ k2 −→ 0, this term is suppressed,
so that the logarithmic derivative becomes in practice independent of energy, Δkl −→ Δl. Thus we
find to leading order
tan δkl = klxl−1

which shows that the leading-order term in the low-energy expansion of tan δkl ≈ δkl is γ0k2l+1. As a
matter of fact, since Δkl depends on k2 through the Schrodinger equation, it can be thought of as a ¨
function of k2 and, as such, can be expanded in powers of k2. Then, given that x−l

Problem 12 Hard-Sphere Potential: Phase Shifts, Low- and

compare it with the free-particle wave function. Calculate the scattering amplitude at low energies,
and compare the corresponding total cross section with the classical result. Show that, in the high￾energy limit ka −→ ∞, the total cross section is given by 2πa2.

where fl(x) = jl(x) or nl(x).

r = Akl jl(kr) − Bkl nl(kr) .
The boundary condition at r = a requires
ψkl(a) = 0 = Akl jl(ka) − Bkl nl(ka) =⇒ Bkl/Akl = jl(ka)/nl(ka) ,

Using the small-x expansions for jl(x) and nl(x), we find that δkl in the limit of low energy (k −→ 0)
is proportional to k2l+1, as expected.
For the s-wave case, the phase shift is obtained as δk0 = −ka, since j0 (ka)/n0 (ka) = − tan(ka), and
the wave function reads

The last expression follows directly from the Schrodinger equation above for ¨ l = 0 and the boundary
condition at r = a. When compared with the free solution sin(kr), we see that uk0 (r) is “pushed out”
(since the potential is repulsive); indeed, while the nodes of the free-particle solution occur at nπ/k
with n = 1, 2, ... , those of the exact solution are shifted by an amount a, that is, they occur at
nπ/k + a.
The s-wave contribution to the total cross section can be read off from Eq. (15.60):
σk0 = (4π/k2) sin2 (ka). Because of the behavior of the higher l-phase shifts when k −→ 0, this
term dominates in the total cross section at low energy, σk ≈ 4πa2. In this limit, the differential cross
section is isotropic, namely, independent of the scattering angle, since

and therefore σk (θ) = | fk (θ)|
2 ≈ a2, in agreement with the result found above for the total cross
section in the same limit. It is interesting to note that the total cross section obtained classically is
πa2 – a factor 4 smaller than that obtained quantum mechanically; it corresponds to the area of the
disk seen by the incoming beam of particles (classically, only the particles with impact parameter
b ≤ a will be scattered by the hard-sphere potential).
From tan δl(k) = jl(ka)/nl(ka) and using the identity sin2 x = tan2 x/(1 + tan2 x), we have
sin2 δl(k) = j

We are interested in the limit x = ka −→ ∞ (with a fixed). In such a limit, the recursion relation
satisfied by the spherical Bessel functions gives
fl(x) = − fl−2 (x) =⇒ f 2
l (x) = f 2
l−2 (x) = f 2
l−4 (x) = ··· = f 2

Problem 13 Study of the Spherical Potential Well in S-Waves; Resonances
Consider a particle in a spherical potential well,
V(r) = −V0 r ≤ a , V(r) = 0 r > a ,
where V0 > 0. For simplicity, consider s-waves only. Define k2 = 2μE/2 and k2
0 = 2μV0/2.
1. Determine under what conditions there are at least n bound states.
2. Obtain the s-wave phase shift δk0 and its low- and high-energy limits.
3. For energies E ≥ 0, the radial wave function can be written as
uk0 (r) = Ak sin(Kr) r ≤ a , uk0 (r) = Bk sin(kr + δk0) r > a ,

2; what is, roughly speaking, its physical meaning?
Show that the ratio exhibits resonances (maxima) at certain energies. Determine these energies
and corresponding (s-wave) phase shifts and associated contributions to the total cross section.
4. Suppose that the depth of the potential is close to an odd multiple of π/2, that is, ak0 = ak∗
0 + η
where ak∗
0 =(2n − 1)π/2 and η  1. Consider the case η > 0, and determine approximately
the energy of the least (nth) bound state. Then consider η < 0, and show that this bound state
disappears, becoming a resonance. Determine its energy, and show that, for energies close to the
resonant energy ER, the phase shift as a function of energy is given by
tan δE0 = − Γ/2
E − ER
with Γ = 2 2kR
aμ .
Obtain the s-wave contribution to the total cross section at these energies.
5. Show that the asymptotic wave function in s-waves can be written as

Consider the wave packet

dk g(k) ψk0 (r) e−iEt/ , E = 2k2
2μ ,
where the profile function g(k) is strongly peaked at kR and vanishes outside a narrow range
centered at kR. Calculate the time delay τ in the scattered wave packet. Interpret your result for τ.

u0 (r) = 0 r ≤ a , u

The solution satisfies the boundary condition u0 (r) ∝ r as r −→ 0. Bound states (if they exist) have
energies in the range −V0 < E < 0 and satisfy the additional boundary condition u0 (r −→ ∞) = 0.
We set
k2 −→ −κ2 = −2μ|E|,

Thus the solution reads

where x = κ/k0 with x in the range 0 < x < 1. The equation can be solved graphically. First, it is clear
that, since the right-hand side is always negative, for a solution to exist the tangent of the left-hand
side must be negative, which requires
ak0 > π/2 =⇒ V0 >

μa2 .
Thus, if the well is not deep enough, there will be no bound states. On the other hand, it is easy to
see that if ak0 > (2n − 1)π/2 there will be n (s-wave) bound states.
Part 2
For energies E ≥ 0 (and hence k2 ≥ 0), the radial wave function uk0 (r) is given by
uk0 (r) = Ak sin(Kr) r ≤ a , uk0 (r) = Bk sin(kr + δk0) r > a ,
where δk0 is the phase shift and K=

k2
0 + k2. Matching at r = a leads to
Ak sin(Ka) = Bk sin(ka + δk0) , AkKcos(Ka) = Bkk cos(ka + δk0) ,
from which by taking the ratio of the first and the second relation above we obtain
δk0 = −ka + tan−1

=⇒ δk0 ≈ k a 
tan(k0a)

.
The phase shift, as expected, behaves linearly with k (for s-waves). It is interesting to note that as k0a
is close to (2n − 1)π/2, recalling that for n bound states to exist we must have k0a > (2n − 1)π/2, it
follows that | tan(k0a)| and hence |δk0 | become very large. By contrast, in the high-energy limit, we
have K −→ k and hence δk0 ≈ 0, which simply says that, in this limit, the particle does not undergo
any scattering.
Part 3

than outside:
|Ak |

When plotted as a function of k, this ratio exhibits resonances when Ka = (2n − 1)π/2, which

At these values of k2, |Ak/Bk |
2 = 1 and tan(Ka) −→ ∞. It follows from the expression for δk0 obtained
in part 2 that δk0 +ka must be an odd multiple of π/2. In particular, suppose that the depth of the well
is such that k2
0 ≈ k∗2
0 , and that the energy k2 is very small, with ka  1. Then we find that δk0, up
to the negligible contribution −ka, is an odd multiple of π/2, and hence the contribution of s-wave
scattering to the total cross section is essentially maximal,
σk0 ≈ 4π
k2 sin2 δk0 ≈ 4π
k2 .
Part 4
It is interesting to explore more systematically what happens when the depth of the well is very close
to an odd multiple of π/2,
k0a = k∗
0a + η with η  1 .
We now consider the two possibilities, in which η is either positive or negative. If η is positive, as
we have established above bound-state energies result from solving graphically
tan

with 0 < x < 1 ,
where x = κ/k0 with κ2 = 2μ|E|/2 and E < 0. Since for η > 0 we have k0 > k∗
0, there are n solutions
xk with k = 1, ... , n, corresponding to energies Ek = −2 (xkk0)2/(2μ). The least-bound state has
energy En close to zero (that is, xn is close to zero). We can determine xn, and hence the energy En,
by solving the above eigenvalue equation in this limit (x −→ 0), in which case we have5
tan(ak0) ≈ − 1
xn
=⇒ xn = − cot(ak∗
0 + η) ≈ η ,
and En ≈ −2 (ηk∗
0)2/(2μ) to leading order.
If η is negative, the potential can only support n − 1 bound states. However, the nth bound state
becomes a scattering resonance with an energy from k2 = k∗2

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press545 15.4 Problems
Thus, we see that if the depth of the well is gradually reduced (keeping a fixed), the bound states that
disappear when k0a passes through an odd multiple of π/2 produce low-energy scattering resonances.
To determine how the phase shift behaves for energies close to the resonant energy, we write the
expression for the phase shift derived in part 2 as
tan δk0 ≈ k

and the singularity is consistent with our previous result that at k = kR the phase shift goes through
an odd multiple of π/2. Rewriting the expression above in terms of the energy yields the expression
given in the text of the problem. The constant Γ has dimensions of energy. We can now obtain the
cross section in the resonance region (recall that we are dealing with s-wave scattering):
σk0 ≈ 4π
k2 sin2 δE0 ≈ 4π
k2
Γ2/4
(E − ER)2 + Γ2/4 ,
where we have used the trigonometric identity sin2 x = tan2 x/(1 + tan2 x). The equation above is
known as the Breit–Wigner formula and describes the characteristic “bell” shape of the cross section
in the resonance region; Γ gives the full width of the cross section at half maximum.
Part 5
We now investigate the behavior of the wave function in the resonance region. From Eqs. (15.53),
(15.54), and (15.56), considering only s-wave terms we see that the asymptotic wave function reads

that is, it consists of an incident spherical wave e−ikr and a scattered spherical wave eikr. The effect
of the potential is to introduce a phase shift in the latter. We now form the wave packet

with g(k) real and strongly peaked at kR.

This time delay is the time during which the particle “hangs around” the region where the potential is
present. Note that it is inversely proportional to Γ, so the narrower the resonance width, the longer the
time delay (as a matter of fact, in the limit of an infinitely narrow width the particle never leaves the
region of the potential). It is as if the particle is in an unstable bound state or, rather, the incident and
target particles form an unstable bound state, which has a lifetime of order /Γ. In order to clarify this
interpretation further, consider again the scattered wave packet but now more conveniently written
as a superposition in energy:
Ψs,0 (r, t) =

ei(kr+2δE0)

We are interested in studying its behavior for large times at a fixed r in a region outside the potential.
To this end, we first note that
e2iδE0 = eiδE0
e−iδE0
= cos δE0 + isin δE0
cos δE0 − isin δE0
= 1 + i tan δE0

≈ E − ER − iΓ/2
E − ER + iΓ/2 ,
which can also be written as
e2iδE0 = 1 − iΓ
E − ER + iΓ/2 .
Thus we see that the scattered wave packet near the resonance has the form
Ψs,0 (r, t) ≈

where in the first step we have taken the lower integration limit to −∞ by formally extending the
definition g(E), setting g(E) = 0 for E < 0, and in the second step (i) we have assumed that the
energy-dependent term g(E) eikr/(kr) varies smoothly near the resonance and (ii) we have dropped a
term proportional to a δ-function in time, that is, δ(t) (recall that we are in the regime t 
 0). The
time integral is easily found by contour integration, by closing the contour in the lower half of the

Therefore, the wave packet develops a time dependence given by e−iERt/ e−Γt/(2 )
. This indeed
supports the interpretation of the scattering process as proceeding through the formation of a quasi￾stable state of energy ER and with lifetime /Γ.
Problem 14 S-Wave Bound- and Scattering-State Problem
in an Attractive δ-Shell Potential
Consider a particle of mass μ under the influence of a central potential V(r) = −V0 δ(r − a) with
V0 > 0, the so-called δ-shell potential. Assume the particle is in an s-wave state.
1. Are there any bound states for E < 0? If so, under what conditions do these exist?
2. Take E > 0 and obtain an expression for the s-wave phase shift δk and determine its low- and
high-energy limits.
Solution
Part 1
We refer to the region 0 < r < a as I and to the region r > a as II. The reduced radial equation in
s-wave reads
u(r) + [ − v(r)]u(r) = 0 ,
where v(r) = 2μV(r)/2 and  = 2μE/2. Bound-state solutions possibly exist only for −v0 <  < 0.
Thus we have
u(r) = 
κ2 − v0 δ(r − a)

u(r) with κ = 

and, imposing the boundary conditions at the origin and ∞,
uI(r) = A sinh(κr) , uII(r) = B e−κr .
It remains to impose the conditions at r = a, which yields
A sinh(κa) = B e−κa , −B κ e−κa − Aκ cosh(κa) = −v0B e−κa ,
leading to
tanh(κa) = κ

where x = κa and x0 = v0a. Graphically this equation is found to have a single solution if x0 > 1 (just
consider the slopes at the origin of the left- and right-hand side functions).

u(r) = 0 ,
with solutions
uI(r) = A sin(kr) , uII(r) = B sin(kr + δk) ,
where δk is the (s-wave) phase shift. The boundary conditions at a require
A sin(ka) = B sin(ka + δk) , B k cos(ka + δk) − Ak cos(ka) = −v0A sin(ka) ,

In the low-energy limit, δk ≈ −ka since in that limit the argument of the inverse tangent vanishes
(recall that cot x −→ ∞ as x goes to zero). In the high-energy limit, however, δk vanishes as it is
obvious on neglecting the term v0/k in the inverse tangent argument.

phase shift resembles the hard-sphere result obtained in Problem 12.

is, cot δ0 (k) goes through zero from the positive side as k increases. Determine the energies of the
resonances approximately, keeping terms of order 1/v0.
4. Obtain the s-wave bound-state energies for a particle confined in a spherical region of radius R;
that is, a particle under the action of a potential V(r) = 0 if r < R and V(r) = ∞ if r > R. Compare
these energies with those obtained for the resonances in part 3.

Solution
Part 1
The s-wave radial equation reads
u(r) = 
v0 δ(r − R) − k2

u(r) .
We define region I for 0 ≤ r < R and region II for r > R. The boundary conditions satisfied by u(r)
are given by
uI(0) = 0 , uI(R) = uII(R) , u
II(R) − u
I(R) = v0uI(R) ,
where the condition on the first derivative is obtained in the usual way by integrating the radial
equation over a small interval containing the δ-function and then reducing this interval to zero. For
r  R the solutions in regions I and II are given by
uI(r) = AI sin(kr) , uII(r) = AII sin(kr + δ) ,
where we have already imposed the requirement that uI(r) vanishes at the origin. The remaining two
boundary conditions yield
sin(kR + δ) = AI
AII
sin(kR) , cos(kR + δ) − AI
AII
cos(kR) = AI
AII
v0
k sin(kR) ,
which lead to the following relation for δ(k);
tan[kR + δ(k)] = k/v0
1 + (k/v0) cot(kR) .
Part 2
In the limit k/v0  1 and assuming that kR  nπ with n = 1, 2, ... (at these points the cotangent is
divergent and (k/v0) cot(kR) may be finite), we have
tan[kR + δ(k)] ≈ k
v0

1 − k
v0
cot(kR)

,
which implies, to terms linear in k/v0 (tan−1 x ≈ x for small x),
δ(k) ≈ −kR +
k
v0
.
For the problem of hard-sphere scattering in an s-wave state, we found δ(k) = − kR, which
reproduces the leading-order term above.
Part 3
Using the addition formula for the tangent, we rewrite the relation obtained in part 1 as
tan[kR + δ(k)] = tan(kR) + tan δ(k)
1 − tan(kR) tan δ(k) = (k/v0) tan(kR)
tan(kR) + k/v0
,
which we solve for tan δ(k) to find
tan δ(k) = − tan2 (kR)
tan(kR) + (k/v0)(1 + tan2 (kR)) .

We assume
knR = nπ + η with |η|  1 ,
that is, knR is close to a multiple of π. For these kn, we obtain (recall that tan(nπ + η) = tan η ≈ η
for η  1)
tan δ(kn) = − η2
η + (kn/v0)(1 + η2) =⇒ cot δ(kn) = − 1
η − kn

Inserting the expression for kn on the right-hand side and recalling that Rv0

or

and we see that the cotangent vanishes, implying that the phase shift goes through π/2, if
η = ηn = −nπ/(Rv0); the wave number kR

Part 4
The s-wave radial equation for a particle confined in the region r ≤ R reads
u(r) = −k2
u(r) for 0 ≤ r ≤ R ,
with boundary conditions u(0) = u(R) = 0. We have
u(r) = A sin kr sin kR = 0 =⇒ kn = nπ

and the energies of the bound states are
EB
n ≈ (nπ)22

which differ from the resonance energies found above by a term of order 1/(Rv0)  1.

We see that the width of the resonance increases as n3 for fixed Rv0. The sharpest resonance, namely
the resonance with the smallest width, is that occurring for n = 1. As v0 increases, the width of the
resonances decreases as 1/v2
0.
In order to express the cotangent of the phase shift as function of energy, we note that, for η ≈ ηn,
keeping up to linear terms in η − ηn, we have

Problem 16 Integral Equation for Scattering in One Dimension
The integral equation for scattering in one dimension for a particle of mass m and energy E in a
potential V(x) reads
ψk (x) = eikx −

−∞
dx Gk (x, x

where the Green’s function Gk (x, x

Gk (x, x
) = −δ(x − x
) ,
v(x) = 2mV(x)/2, and k2 = 2mE/2. The particle is assumed to be traveling initially from left
to right.
1. Following the method illustrated in the construction of the scattering Green’s function in
Problem 8, that is, by Fourier-transforming both sides of the equation for Gk (x, x
) and removing
the singularity in Gk (q) at q = k by making the replacement k −→ k + iη (with η −→ 0), show that
Gk (x, x
) = i
2k eik|x−x | .
2. Show that the integral equation for ψk (x) can be written as
ψk (x) = eikx gk (x; R) + e−ikx gk (x; L) ,
and obtain expressions for gk (x; L) and gk (x; R).
3. Consider the wave function ψk (x) in the asymptotic regions at x −→ ±∞. Show that
lim
x→−∞ ψk (x) = eikx + fk (L) e−ikx , limx→+∞ ψk (x) = fk (R) eikx .
Obtain explicit expressions for the left and right scattering amplitudes fk (L) and fk (R).
4. In the rest of the problem, suppose that the particle is under the action of a δ-function potential
centered at the origin,
V(x) = −V0 δ(x) , V0 > 0 .
Solve the integral equation and obtain the wave function.
5. Obtain the left and right scattering scattering amplitudes and corresponding scattering cross
sections σk (L) = | fk (L)|
2 and σk (R) = | fk (R)|
2. Compare these results with the reflection and
transmission coefficients R(k) and T(k) obtained in Problem 5.1 with V0 replaced by −V0.
Solution
Part 1
Because of translational invariance, the Green’s function depends only on the difference z = x − x
rather than on x and x separately. We introduce the Fourier transforms

and so Gk (q) is singular at q = k, and therefore its Fourier transform is not well defined. To remove
the singularity, we shift the pole off the real axis by setting k −→ k + iη, so that
Gk (z) =

and take the limit η −→ 0 at the end. This integral can be easily performed by contour integration
in the complex-q plane. When z > 0, for convergence we must close the contour in the upper half
plane, picking up the residue at the pole q = k + iη:

picking up the residue at −k − iη. We obtain

Problem 20 Phase Shift as Integral over Radial Scattering
Solution of Schrödinger Equation
Consider two central potentials V(r) and V(r), both vanishing as r −→ ∞ faster than 1/r and neither
having a singularity as strong as 1/r2 at the origin. We are interested in the scattering solutions ukl(r)
and ukl(r) at the same energy E = 2k2/(2μ). The solutions ul(r; k) and ul(r; k) satisfy

where δl(k) and δl(k) are the phase shifts.
1. Multiply both sides of the first equation for ul(r; k) byul(r; k) and both sides of the second equation
forul(r; k) by ul(r; k); subtract the second relation thus obtained from the first. By integrating both

Since the solutions must vanish at the origin, we have
W = k sin[kr − lπ/2 + δl(k)] cos[kr − lπ/2 + δl(k)]
−k sin[kr − lπ/2 + δl(k)] cos[kr − lπ/2 + δl(k)] = −k sin[δl(k) − δl(k)] ,

Set v(r) = 0 and recall that that r jl(kr) is the solution of the free-particle radial equation, with
asymptotic behavior given by
lim
r→∞ r jl(kr) = 1
k sin(kr − lπ/2) .
Therefore, it is ul(r; k) −→ kr jl(kr) that has the asymptotic behavior of ul(r; k) corresponding to
δ(k) = 0. Thus, we arrive at
sin δl(k) = −
 ∞
0
dr r jl(kr) v(r) ul(r; k) .
This is consistent with what was found in Problem 19, as we will now show. In that problem we had
for the radial wave function ψl(r; k) the asymptotic behavior
lim
r→∞ ψl(r; k) = eiδl(k) [cos δl(k) jl(kr) − sin δl(k) nl(kr)] = eiδl(k)
kr sin[kr − lπ/2 + δl(k)] ,
so that r ψl(r; k) = eiδl(k) ul(r; k)/k, and ul(r; k) has the asymptotic behavior adopted in the present
problem. Using the expression for Sl(k), we find

Problem 21 Scattering in a Spin-Dependent Potential
Consider a proton and neutron (both spin-1/2 particles) interacting through a spin-dependent potential
given by
V = Vc (r) + Vσ (r) σ1 · σ2 ,
where Vc (r) is the central potential, r is the magnitude of the relative position operator and σ1 and
σ2 are the Pauli operators for the proton and neutron, respectively; recall that the spin operator S1 is
(/2)σ1 and similarly for the neutron.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press567 15.4 Problems
1. Introduce the operators P0 and P1, defined as
P0 = 1 − σ1 · σ2
4 , P1 = 3 + σ1 · σ2
4 ,
and show that they are projection operators onto states of pair-spin S = 0 and S = 1. Further, show
that the potential can be written as
V = V0 (r) P0 + V1 (r) P1 .
2. Show that a spinor eigenfunction of energy E of the proton–neutron pair’s (relative) Hamiltonian
has the general expansion
ψE(r) = c00 φ(0)
E (r) |00 +

1
M=−1
c1M φ(1)
E (r) |1M ,
where |SM are pair spin states with S = 0 or 1 and M = −S, ... , +S, and φ(S)
E (r) is the orbital wave
function corresponding to pair-spin S. Further, show that the Schrodinger equation for ¨ ψE(r)
decouples into an equation for φ(0)
E (r) and an equation for φ(1)
E (r).
3. Now consider a collision between these two particles occurring at center-of-mass energy
E = 2k2/(2μ), where μ is the proton–neutron reduced mass. Assume that before the collision
the proton is in spin state | ↑ and the neutron in spin state | ↓. Show that the scattering (spinor)
wave function is given by

where φ(0)
k (r) and φ(1)
k (r) are the scattering solutions in the central potentials V0 (r) and V1 (r),
respectively. Denoting by fk,0 (θ) and fk,1 (θ) the scattering amplitudes corresponding to the
potentials V0 (r) and V1 (r), obtain the differential cross section σk (θ) for the spin-exchange
collision ↑↓ −→ ↓↑; that is, a collision after which the proton spin state is | ↓ and the neutron
spin state is | ↑.
4. By expanding the scattering amplitudes in partial waves, show that the total spin-exchange cross
section is given by
σk = π

kl) ,
where δ0
kl and δ1
kl are the phase shifts of the l partial waves corresponding to fk,0 (θ) and fk,1 (θ),
respectively.
Solution
Part 1
The operators P0 and P1 are obviously hermitian. In order to show that they are projection operators,
we need to verify that P2
S = PS with S = 0 or 1. To this end, we note that
(σ1 · σ2)
2 = σ2 · σ2 + i σ1 · (σ2 × σ2) = 3 − 2 σ1 · σ2 ,
where we have used the Pauli identity
σ1 · A σ1 · B = A · B + i σ1 · (A × B) ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press568 Scattering by a Potential
with A =B= σ2, and the angular momentum property
S2 × S2 = i S2 =⇒ σ2 × σ2 = 2iσ2 .
We then find
P2
0 = 1 − 2 σ1 · σ2 + (σ1 · σ2)2
16 = 4 − 4 σ1 · σ2
16 = P0 ,
and similarly for P1. We also have
P0 + P1 = 1 .
Expressing σ1 · σ2 in terms of the pair-spin S = S1 + S2 as
σ1 · σ2 = 4
2 S1 · S2 = 2
2
	
S2 − 3
2
2


= 2
2 S2 − 3 ,
we can also write
P0 = 1 − 1
22 S2 , P1 = 1
22 S2 ,
which shows that for states |SM with pair-spin S = 0 or 1 we have
S2 |SM = S(S+1)2 |SM =⇒ P0 |00 = |00 and P1 |00 = 0 , P0 |1M = 0 and P1 |1M = |1M ,
and hence P0 and P1 are projection operators onto states with pair-spin 0 and 1, respectively. Lastly,
since P1 − 3P0 = σ1 · σ2, the potential V can be written as
V = Vc (r)(P0 + P1) + Vσ (r)(P1 − 3P0) = V0 (r) P0 + V1 (r) P1 ,
where we have defined
V0 (r) = Vc (r) − 3Vσ (r) , V1 (r) = Vc (r) + Vσ (r) .
Part 2
The center-of-mass Hamiltonian is given by
H = p2
2μ
+ Vc (r) + Vσ (r) σ1 · σ2 .
By making use of the properties of projection operators, H can also be written as
H = p2
2 μ
(P0 + P1) + V0 (r) P0 + V1 (r) P1 = H0P0 + H1 P1 ,
where
HS = p2
2μ
+ VS (r) , S = 0, 1 .
A general eigenstate of the Hamiltonian satisfies H|ψE = E |ψE. Such an eigenstate can be expanded
in the combined orbital + spin space as
|ψE =

1
S=0

S
M=−S
cSM|SM⊗|φ(S)
E  ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press569 15.4 Problems
where |φ(S)
E  is the orbital state. The latter is independent of M, since the Hamiltonian HS commutes
with S, given that σ1 · σ2 = (2/2)S2. Inserting the above expansion into the eigenstate equation and
using the property of the projection operator, we find

1
S=0

S

M=−S
cSM|SM⊗|φ(S)
E  ,
where H0 and H1 act only in the orbital space. Projecting both sides onto S
M
| and dropping the
irrelevant constant cSM (which appears on both the left- and right-hand sides), it follows that, for
S = 0 or 1,
H0 |φ(0)
E  = E |φ(0)
E  , H1 |φ(1)
E  = E |φ(1)
E 
and we see that the eigenvalue equation decouples for the two pair-spin states. In the coordinate
representation, the spinor wave function reads
ψE(r) = φr |ψE =

Part 3
Since the problem decouples, we can solve the scattering problem separately for S = 0 and S = 1. For
each case, we are dealing with scattering from a central potential. The asymptotic wave functions
have the form (with k =

2μE/2)
lim
r→∞ φ(S)
k (r) = eik·r + fk,S (θ)
eikr
r ,
where the first term (the plane wave) is the incident wave and the second term (the spherical wave)
is the scattered wave. Consider now the spinor wave function ψ↑↓

ψ↑↓
k (r) = 1
√
2
φ(0)
k (r) |00 +

so that in the asymptotic region

and we see that this spinor wave function has an incident wave in which particle 1 (the proton) has
spin up and particle 2 (the neutron) has spin down and scattered waves with particle 1 spin up and
particle 2 spin down, and vice versa. Note that the interaction can flip the spins of the individual
particles, since the Hamiltonian does not commute independently with S2
1 and S2
2. We can read off
the amplitude for the spin-exchange transition as [ fk,1 (θ) − fk,0 (θ)]/2, from which we obtain the
spin-exchange differential cross section:
σk (θ) = | fk,1 (θ) − fk,0 (θ)|

Problem 23 Effective Range Theory

derivation of the low-energy behavior of phase shifts)

a

2 k2 + ··· ,
where a is the scattering length and rs is the effective range. The goal of the present problem is
to derive an expression for rs in terms of zero-energy radial wave functions. It is assumed that
the potential is short range (it vanishes for r  R). Denote by u0 (r; k) the solution of the (radial)
Schrodinger equation for the s-wave state, ¨

k2 − v(r)

u0 (r; k) = 0 ,
where v(r) = 2μV(r)/2 and u0 (r; k) vanishes at the origin. In the asymptotic region, we normalize it
to behave as
u0 (r ≥ R; k) = sin[kr + δ0 (k)]
sin δ0 (k) = cot δ0 (k) sin(kr) + cos(kr) .
1. Define the radial function φ0 (r; k) by
φ0 (r; k) ≡ sin[kr + δ0 (k)]
sin δ0 (k) ,
and write down the equation satisfied by φ0 (r; k) for r ≥ 0. Using the expansion for cot δ0 (k)

Solution
Part 1
Clearly, φ0 (r; k) is the free-particle solution of the Schrodinger equation; it satisfies, for ¨ r ≥ 0,
φ
0 (r; k) + k2φ0 (r; k) = 0 ,
This solution can also be written as
φ0 (r; k) = k cot δ0 (k)
sin(kr)
k + cos(kr) ,
so that

Also note that the free-particle wave function, as defined above, is such that φ0 (0; k) = 1.
Part 2
Multiplying the equation for u0 (r; k1) by u0 (r; k2) and vice versa, we obtain
u0 (r; k2) u
0 (r; k1) = u0 (r; k2)

Identical manipulations for the free-particle Schrodinger equation lead to a similar relation but with ¨
u0 (r; k) replaced by φ0 (r; k) and the Wronskian W0 replaced by the corresponding Wf
0 .
Part 3
The boundary conditions satisfied by u(r; k) at the origin and in the asymptotic region, respectively,
u0 (0; k) = 0 and u0 (r ≥ R; k) = φ0 (r; k), give for the Wronskian W0
W0 = φ0 (R; k1) φ

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press574 Scattering by a Potential
so that the difference W0 − Wf
0 follows:
W0 − Wf
0 = φ0 (0; k1) φ
0 (0; k2) − φ
0 (0; k1) φ0 (0; k2) = φ
0 (0; k2) − φ
0 (0; k1) ,
where we have used φ0 (0; k) = 1. Now, we observe that
φ
0 (r; k) = k cos[kr + δ0 (k)]
sin δ0 (k) ,
and hence
W0 − Wf
0 = k2 cot δ0 (k2) − k1 cot δ0 (k1) .
We arrive at
k2 cot δ0 (k2) − k1 cot δ0 (k1) = 

dr

and the upper integration limit can be extended to ∞, since the integrand vanishes for r ≥ R. This is
the desired relation.

We take the limit k2 −→ 0, and find (with k1 −→ k)

We have made no approximations in obtaining the relation above; it is exact. In the limit k −→ 0, we
obtain

which is the desired relation. Note that the effective range parameter rs provides a measure of the
difference between the free-particle and full wave function in the interaction region r < R.
Problem 24 Phase Shift in the High-Energy Approximation
The goal of this problem is to derive an approximation for the phase shift at high energy.
1. The asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reduced radial equation is given in Eqs. (15.43)
and (15.55); factoring out i
l
(2l + 1), it can be written as namely
u(r) = eiδkl
k sin(kr − lπ/2 + δkl) .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press575 15.4 Problems
It can also be written as
u(r) = 1
2k

e2iδkl ei[kr−π(l+1)/2] + e−i[kr−π(l+1)/2]
.
Here we have dropped the subscript kl from u(r) for brevity.
2. Following the WKB method, write the two independent solutions of the reduced radial equation
as u = e±ikφ(r)
, and show that φ(r) satisfies the following differential equation:
±ikφ(r) − k2
[φ
(r)]
2 + k2 − v(r) − l(l + 1)
r2 = 0 ,
where the  indicates a derivative with respect to r.
3. Show that in the limit k −→ ∞ (the high-energy limit), the term proportional to φ(r) can be
neglected if

The requirement above is satisfied when
|v

k3  1 , |veff(r)|

Interpret these conditions.
4. Assume that the requirement above is satisfied. Show that φ(r) is then obtained as

5. Take r0 to be the classical inversion point at which Veff(r0) = E, or equivalently veff(r0) = k2. In the
high-energy limit that we are considering, this inversion point will be close to the origin. With the
requirement u(r0) = 0, show that
u(r) = a

eik[φ(r)−φ(r0)] − e−ik[φ(r)−φ(r0)]

,
where a is an overall normalization constant.
6. By comparing the solution above with that obtained in part 1 in terms of outgoing and ingoing
spherical waves, obtain the following expression for the phase shift:
δkl = l

.
7. In the absence of the potential, the phase shift should vanish. Show that the expression found
above does not satisfy this requirement (you may use tables of integrals). Show, however, that
the latter requirement can indeed be satisfied by the following ad hoc replacements: l(l + 1) −→
(l + 1/2)2 in veff(r) and lπ/2 −→ (l + 1/2)π/2, namely

|L| = prsin θ = pb =⇒ (l + 1/2) = kb or b = l + 1/2

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press16 Symmetry Transformations of States and Operators
In this chapter we consider symmetry transformations. A symmetry transformation on a system is
generally a transformation that does not change the laws of nature as they apply to that system. In
the specific context of quantum mechanics, the previous statement does not mean that the states and
operators of a physical system are invariant under a symmetry transformation, but rather that the new
states and new operators obey the same laws as the old states and operators. As an example, suppose
that Aˆ is an observable. Then, a rotation of the whole system will map Aˆ into a new observable Aˆ
.
The statement that this is a symmetry transformation entails that the observables Aˆ and Aˆ have the
same spectrum, namely, the same eigenvalues since these are the only results that can be measured
experimentally and that the eigenstates of each eigenvalue of Aˆ are transforms of the eigenstates
belonging to the same eigenvalue of Aˆ. In particular, the probability of measuring a given eigenvalue
a with the system in state |ψ is invariant, so that |ϕa |ψ|2 = |ϕ
a |ψ
|2, where |ϕ
a and |ψ
 are the
transforms of the eigenstate |ϕa and the state |ψ.
Symmetry transformations in quantum mechanics can be characterized generally as those trans￾formations that leave transition probabilities unchanged, specifically
|φ|ψ|2 = |φ
|ψ
|2 , (16.1)
for any two states |φ and |ψ. The mapping |ψ −→ |ψ
 can be thought of as being effected by an
operator Tˆ:
|ψ
 = Tˆ |ψ , (16.2)
and obviously Tˆ must be invertible. If Oˆ is a generic operator and |ϕ = Oˆ |ψ, then after a symmetry
transformation we must have |ϕ
 = Oˆ  |ψ
, which leads to the following transformation law for
operators:
Oˆ = Tˆ−1 Oˆ  Tˆ or Oˆ  = Tˆ Oˆ Tˆ−1 . (16.3)
Recalling that a unitary operator Uˆ is defined by the property that it preserves inner products, that is,
(U φ, U ψ) = (φ, ψ) for any two states |φ and |ψ, one would be tempted to conclude, erroneously,
that Tˆ must be a unitary operator, since this would ensure that the requirement of Eq. (16.1) is
automatically satisfied.
1 In fact, a theorem originally due to Wigner shows that Tˆ is either unitary or
anti-unitary – an anti-unitary operator Ωˆ is an invertible operator that satisfies (Ω φ, Ω ψ) = (φ, ψ)∗
(anti-unitary operators are discussed in Section 16.3.1); in either case, however, we have Tˆ−1 = Tˆ†.
Symmetry transformations that can be implemented starting from the identity transformation and
by varying continuously a parameter (or set of parameters) – that is, by a sequence of infinitesimal
transformations – are known as continuous transformations. Important examples are space and
time translations and rotations. In a space translation, the parameters are the components of the
displacement a by which we translate the whole system. In a rotation, the parameters are the angle ϕ
1 Incidentally, when the ket–bra notation is ambiguous, we will denote inner products as (φ, ψ), matrix elements as
(φ, A ψ), etc.

and direction nˆ of the axis about which we rotate the system by ϕ. These transformations are induced
by unitary operators. However, there are also transformations, known as discrete transformations, that
cannot be implemented via the continuous variation of a parameter (or set of parameters). Examples
of these are space inversion, or parity, and time reversal: the former is induced by a unitary operator
and the latter by an anti-unitary operator.
We begin by discussing continuous transformations; they form a group.
2 Let UˆT(λ) be the operator
representing a continuous symmetry transformation characterized by a (real) parameter λ. In the limit
in which λ is an infinitesimal, η, we expand UˆT(η) up to linear terms in η as follows:
UˆT(η) = 1ˆ − iη Tˆ + ··· , (16.4)
where the imaginary unit is introduced for later convenience and the operator Tˆ is independent of
η. Continuous transformations must necessarily be represented by unitary rather than anti-unitary
operators, since the identity is obviously a unitary operator. Therefore, it follows that
Uˆ†
T(η) UˆT(η) = 1ˆ , (16.5)
implying, up and including terms linear in η,

1ˆ + iη Tˆ† + ···  1ˆ − iη Tˆ + ···  = 1ˆ − iη

Tˆ − Tˆ†
+ ··· = 1ˆ , (16.6)
and so Tˆ must be hermitian (had the factor i not been included then Tˆ would have been found to
be anti-hermitian). Any finite (continuous) transformation can be implemented via a sequence of
infinitesimal transformations,
UˆT(λ) = lim
n→∞ UˆT(η) UˆT(η) ··· UˆT(η) = lim
n→∞

1ˆ − i(λ/n)Tˆ
 n
= e−iλTˆ
; (16.7)
see Problem 6 on Chapter 6 for a proof of the unitarity of e−iλTˆ
. The hermitian operator Tˆ is aptly
known as the generator of the symmetry. In principle, any hermitian operator is the generator
of some symmetry. However, among hermitian operators, the momentum, angular momentum,
and Hamiltonian are of particular relevance since they are the generators of the symmetries
under, respectively, space translations, rotations, and time translations. Under an infinitesimal
transformation, a generic operator Oˆ transforms as

16.1 Space and Time Translations
We consider a single particle and the basis consisting of eigenstates |φr of the position operator rˆ.
We suppose the particle to be localized at r0, that is, it is in the eigenstate |φr0  with wave function
given by φr |φr0  = δ(r−r0). After a translation by a, the particle will be localized at r0 +a, namely3
|φr0  −→ |φ
r0  = UˆT(a) |φr0  = |φr0+a , (16.10)
and UˆT(a) is the unitary operator inducing the translation with Uˆ†
T(a) = Uˆ−1
T (a) = UˆT(−a). Since we
know the effect of UˆT(a) on a basis, we can deduce its effect on any state |ψ; indeed, we have
|ψ −→ |ψ
 = UˆT(a)|ψ =⇒ ψ
(r) = (φr , ψ
) = (φr , UT(a) ψ) = (U†
T(a) φr , ψ) (16.11)
= (φr−a , ψ) = ψ(r − a) .
Note that the wave function on the right-hand side is evaluated, correctly, at r−a rather than at r+a;
for example, if the wave function is strongly peaked at the origin before the translation, after the
translation it will peak at a.
In order to determine UT(a) explicitly, we consider an infinitesimal translation along some
direction specified by the unit vector nˆ:
UˆT(η nˆ) = 1ˆ − i η Tˆ , (16.12)
which implies that
ψ
(r) = φr | 1ˆ − i η Tˆ |ψ = ψ(r − η nˆ) = ψ(r) − η nˆ · ∇ ψ(r) , (16.13)
where in the last step we expanded the wave function in a Taylor series and kept terms linear in η.
From the relation above, we infer that
φr | Tˆ |ψ = −i nˆ · ∇ ψ(r) =⇒ Tˆ = nˆ · pˆ/ , (16.14)
and the generator of the translation along nˆ is proportional to the component of the momentum
operator along this direction. For a finite translation, we simply exponentiate the generator to obtain
UT(a) = e−ia·pˆ/ . (16.15)
Any translation can be decomposed into independent translations along the unit vectors eˆ1, eˆ2, and
eˆ3 – an orthonormal set specifying a right-handed coordinate system – and therefore
UT(a) = e−ia·pˆ/ = e−i(a1pˆ1+a2pˆ2+a3pˆ3)/ = UˆT(a1) UˆT(a2) UˆT(a3) , (16.16)
and, since the generators commute among themselves, the order in which two (or more) translations
are executed is immaterial (as we will see, this commutativity property does not generally hold for
rotations, except for rotations about the same axis). Under a translation, the momentum and spin
operators of a particle are invariant,
pˆ −→ pˆ  = UˆT(a) pˆ Uˆ†
T(a) = pˆ , Sˆ −→ Sˆ  = UˆT(a) Sˆ Uˆ†
T(a) = Sˆ , (16.17)
3 The states |φ
r0  and |φr0+a can differ by a phase factor; here and in the sections that follow, unless otherwise specified we
set it equal to unity.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press585 16.2 Rotations
since both pˆ and Sˆ commute with UˆT(a) or, equivalently, with the generators pˆ/ of translations. On
the other hand, for the position operator we obtain (see Problem 1)
rˆ −→ rˆ = UˆT(a) rˆ Uˆ†
T(a) = rˆ − a . (16.18)
If more than one particle is present then the generator of translations is proportional to the total
momentum operator Pˆ,
Pˆ =

n
pˆ n , UˆT(a) = e−ia·Pˆ/ , (16.19)
and
rˆn −→ rˆ
n = UˆT(a) rˆn Uˆ†
T(a) = rˆn − a , (16.20)
with the pˆ n and Sˆ n left unchanged (the fundamental operators rˆ, pˆ, and Sˆ of different particles
commute and so, for example, [ ˆrm,i , ˆpn,j ] = i δmn δij). In particular, it follows that if a Hamiltonian is
invariant under translations then the total momentum is conserved. This is the case for two particles
interacting with each other through a potential which depends only on the relative position operator
rˆ1 − rˆ2; see Section 10.3.
In a time translation t −→ t
 = t + τ, we have
|ψ(t) −→ |ψ
(t) = Uˆ T (τ) |ψ(t) = |ψ(t − τ) , (16.21)
and |ψ
(t) corresponds to the state |ψ(t − τ) after a translation by τ. Taking τ to be infinitesimal,
the relation above implies

1ˆ − iη Tˆ

|ψ(t) = |ψ(t) − η
d
dt |ψ(t) = |ψ(t) + i
η

Hˆ |ψ(t) , (16.22)
where in the last step we have used the time-dependent Schrodinger equation to express the time ¨
derivative of the state, and have excluded the presence of time-dependent external fields, so that
the Hamiltonian is time independent (if such fields are present, the system will not generally be
invariant under time translations). We see that Tˆ = −Hˆ/ is the generator of time translations, and a
finite transformation results from
Uˆ T (τ) = eiHˆτ/ . (16.23)
If the time interval τ is taken as t − t0, we have
|ψ
(t) = Uˆ T (t − t0) |ψ(t) = eiHˆ(t−t0)/ e−iHˆ(t−t0)/ |ψ(t0)  |ψ(t)
= |ψ(t0) . (16.24)
and |ψ
(t) is constant in time. Referring to Eq. (7.26), we conclude that the Heisenberg picture
(H-picture) can be viewed as resulting from a translation in time. Operators transform as Aˆ −→ Aˆ =
Uˆ T (τ) Aˆ Uˆ†
T (τ), which for τ = t−t0 reduces to the transformation law for operators in the H-picture,
given in Eq. (7.27).
16.2 Rotations
Before discussing the transformation of quantum states and operators, it is useful to remind the reader
of a few facts about rotations. A rotation by ϕ about an axis specified by the unit vector nˆ can be
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press586 Symmetry Transformations of States and Operators
represented by a 3×3 orthogonal matrix R(ϕnˆ). In the special case of rotations about the unit vectors
eˆ1, eˆ2, and eˆ3 (the orthonormal set of a right-handed coordinate system), these matrices are given by
R(ϕeˆ1) = 

In the general case of a rotation about a direction nˆ = (nˆ1, ˆn2, ˆn3), where ˆni is the component of nˆ
along eˆi, the matrix R(ϕ nˆ) is obtained by exponentiation,
R(ϕnˆ) = eϕnˆ ·E , nˆ · E = nˆ1 E1 + nˆ2 E2 + nˆ3 E3 , (16.26)

These generators can be derived from Eq. (16.25) by noting that R(ηeˆi) = 1+η Ei in the limit η −→ 0.
They satisfy the commutation relations

that is, the same commutation relations as the angular momentum up to a factor i. Under an

and δv = ηnˆ × v represents the infinitesimal change in v.
In order to construct the unitary operator UˆR(ϕnˆ) that induces rotations of the states describing a
particle (spinless, for the time being), we consider, as in the case of translations, the particle to be
initially localized at r0, which is represented by the eigenstate |φr0  of the position operator. After
the rotation, the particle will be localized at R(ϕnˆ)r0, R r0 for short or, in terms of components,

j Rijr0,j,
|φr0  −→ |φ
r0  = UˆR(ϕnˆ) |φr0  = |φRr0  . (16.29)
We can evaluate the effect of UˆR(ϕnˆ) on a generic state |ψ by noting that
|ψ −→ |ψ

(r) = (φr , ψ

where we have used Uˆ†
R(ϕnˆ) |φr = Uˆ−1
R (ϕnˆ) |φr = |φR−1r. Note that the wave function on the
final right-hand side is evaluated, correctly, at R−1r rather than at R r, since it is the position R−1r that
corresponds to r after the rotation. In an infinitesimal rotation we have

where in the next-to-last step we used R−1 (ηnˆ)r = R(−ηnˆ)r = r − η nˆ × r, and in the last step we
expanded the wave function in a Taylor series and kept terms linear in η; hence,
φr | Tˆ |ψ = −i(nˆ × r) · ∇ ψ(r) = −inˆ · (r × ∇)ψ(r) =⇒ Tˆ = nˆ · ( rˆ × pˆ 
Lˆ
)/ , (16.32)
and so the generator of rotations about nˆ is proportional to the component of the orbital angular
momentum operator along this direction; for a finite rotation, we obtain
UˆR(ϕnˆ) = e−iϕnˆ ·Lˆ / . (16.33)
For the general case of a particle with spin, the generator of rotations is the total angular momentum
Jˆ =Lˆ + Sˆ, and the unitary operator that effects the transformation is then given by
UˆR(ϕnˆ) = e−iϕnˆ ·Jˆ/ = e−iϕnˆ ·Sˆ/

since the orbital angular momentum and spin commute with each other. Thus rotations in orbital and
spin space can be carried out independently (this is not the case in relativistic quantum mechanics).
To see how states transform under rotations in the orbital + spin space, we first consider the effect
of a rotation on the basis of eigenstates |φrσ = |φr⊗|σ of the position and spin operator (not
necessarily spin-1/2); we have
UˆR(ϕnˆ) |φrσ = |φRr ⊗ Uˆs
R(ϕnˆ) |σ . (16.35)
The spinor wave function of a generic state then transforms as

R(ϕnˆ)|ψ =

where in the last step we have inserted the completeness operator over the spin states, 
τ |ττ| =
1ˆ(s)
. It should be clear that if, say, two successive rotations are performed, then the order in which
these are carried out is important, since UˆR(ϕnˆ) and UˆR(ϕ
nˆ 
) do not commute (unless, of course,
nˆ = nˆ 
). Finally, in Problem 8 it is shown that for a particle with half-integer spin (or a system
containing an odd number of particles with half-integer spins) the operator inducing a rotation
by 2π is not equal to the identity; rather, it is UˆR(2πnˆ) = −1ˆ. Note, however, that for such a
particle (or system) we have UˆR(4πnˆ) = 1ˆ (an experimental verification of this property by a neutron
interferometry experiment is discussed in Problem 13 of Chapter 12).
Scalar operators commute with Jˆ and hence with the rotation operator: they are invariant under
rotations. By contrast, vector operators transform under rotations according to
vˆ −→ vˆ = UˆR(ϕnˆ) vˆ Uˆ†
R(ϕnˆ) = R−1 (ϕnˆ) vˆ , (16.37)
indeed, this is what we mean when we say that a triplet of operators ˆv1, ˆv2 and ˆv3 forms a vector
operator. Here, the notation 

16.3 Discrete Symmetries: Space Inversion and Time Reversal
In this section we consider the discrete symmetries of space inversion and time reversal. As noted
earlier, time reversal is the only symmetry transformation that is induced by an anti-unitary operator,
and the properties of anti-unitary operators are briefly reviewed below.
Space inversion transformations were introduced in Section 4.2. Here, we explore their properties
further. For a spinless particle, space inversion, when acting on the basis consisting of position
eigenstates, gives
|φr −→ |φ
r = UˆP|φr = |φ−r . (16.39)
Since Uˆ2
P|φr = |φr, we see that Uˆ2
P = 1ˆ, yielding UˆP = Uˆ−1
P = Uˆ†
P, where in the last step we used the
fact that UˆP is unitary (its unitarity can be verified directly from the definition of UˆP). Consequently
UˆP is also hermitian, and hence an observable with eigenvalues ±1. The action on a generic state |ψ
is obtained as follows:
|ψ −→ |ψ
 = UˆP|ψ =⇒ ψ
(r) = (φr , ψ
) = (φr , UPψ) = (U†
Pφr , ψ) = (φ−r , ψ) = ψ(−r) ,
(16.40)
in accordance with the result of Section 4.2. A particle in a central potential (for example, the electron
in the hydrogen atom) has a wave function of the form ψlm(r) = R(r) Ylm(θ, φ), and under space
inversion the transformation properties of ψlm(r) follow from those of the spherical harmonics, since
ψlm(−r) = R(r) Ylm(π − θ, φ + π) = (−1)
l
R(r) Ylm(θ, φ) = (−1)
l
ψlm(r) , (16.41)
and in spherical coordinates r = (r, θ, φ) −→ (r, π − θ, φ + π) = −r (see Problem 11 in Chapter 11
for a derivation of the transformation properties of spherical harmonics under parity).
The position and momentum operators transform as follows (since UˆP = Uˆ†
P):
rˆ −→ rˆ = UˆP rˆ UˆP = −rˆ , pˆ −→ pˆ  = UˆP pˆ UˆP = −pˆ , (16.42)
as can be easily verified; for the basis |φr, for example, we have that the matrix elements of pˆ are
(φr , pˆ φr ) = −i ∇ δ(r − r
), where the gradient acts on the r dependence, and hence
(φr , pˆ  φr ) = (φr , UP pˆ UP φr ) = (Up φr , pˆ UP φr ) = (φ−r , pˆ φ−r )
= + i ∇ δ(−r + r
) = −(φr , pˆ φr ) . (16.43)
As a consequence of Eq. (16.42), the orbital angular momentum Lˆ is invariant under space inversion
and hence commutes with UˆP. Consistency then requires that UˆP also commutes with Jˆ and, in
particular, Sˆ, the spin operator. If a particle has spin then the basis of eigenstates |φrσ of r, Sˆ 2, and
Sˆ
z (a complete set of commuting observables for a single particle) transforms under space inversion
as UˆP|φrσ = |φ−rσ, and UˆP|φrσ remains an eigenstate of Sˆ 2 and Sˆ
z with the same eigenvalues
as |φrσ.
16.3.1 Time Reversal; Properties of Anti-Unitary Operators
Classically, the equations of motion for a particle moving under the influence of a potential v(r)
are invariant under the time-reversal transformation r(t) −→ r(−t) and p(t) −→ −p(−t). As a
consequence, for any solution there corresponds one that retraces the original trajectory backwards.
More explicitly, suppose that the particle, moving along a given trajectory, reaches at time t0 the
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press589 16.3 Discrete Symmetries: Space Inversion and Time Reversal
position r0 = r(t0) with momentum p0 = p(t0). If the particle were to suddenly reverse its momentum,
that is, if p0 −→ −p0 when it reaches the position r0, it would retrace the trajectory it had followed
up to time t0.
To discuss time reversal in quantum mechanics, we make explicit the time dependence of the
position and momentum operators by adopting the Heisenberg picture (H-picture), that is,
rˆH(t) = eiHtˆ / rˆ e−iHtˆ / , pˆ H(t) = eiHtˆ / pˆ e−iHtˆ / , (16.44)
where rˆ = rˆH(0) = rˆS and similarly for pˆ. Note that at time t = 0 the Schrodinger-picture (S-picture) ¨
and H-picture representations of states and operators coincide. Under time reversal we require that
rˆ(t) −→ rˆ
H(t) = Ωˆ T rˆH(t) Ωˆ †
T = rˆH(−t) , pˆ(t) −→ pˆ 
H(t) = Ωˆ T pˆ H(t) Ωˆ †
T = −pˆ H(−t) ,
(16.45)
where Ωˆ T is the operator that induces the transformation. This then leads to the following
canonical (equal-time) commutation relations for the transformed operators

H,β (t)

T =⇒ Ωˆ T

i δαβ 
Ωˆ †
T = −i δαβ ,
(16.46)
and Ωˆ T must be anti-unitary, so that Ωˆ T c = c∗ Ωˆ T , where c is a complex number. Generally, an
anti-unitary operator Ωˆ is an invertible operator, such that
(Ωˆ φ, Ωˆ ψ) = (φ, ψ)
∗ . (16.47)
The product of a unitary and an anti-unitary operator is anti-unitary, while the product of two anti￾unitary operators is unitary; for example, let Ωˆ 1 and Ωˆ 2 be two anti-unitary operators; then Ωˆ 1 Ωˆ 2 is
unitary, since
(Ωˆ 1 Ωˆ 2 φ, Ωˆ 1 Ωˆ 2 ψ) = (Ωˆ 2 φ, Ωˆ 2 ψ)
∗ = 
(φ, ψ)
∗
 ∗
= (φ, ψ) . (16.48)
An anti-unitary operator is necessarily antilinear (see Problem 17), namely
Ωˆ (α|φ + β|ψ) = α∗ Ωˆ |φ + β∗ Ωˆ |ψ , (16.49)
and the adjoint of an antilinear operator is defined as
(φ, Ωˆ ψ) = (Ωˆ † φ, ψ)
∗ . (16.50)
If each of the operators Ωˆ 1, Ωˆ 2, ..., Ωˆ n is either linear or antilinear then the adjoint of the
product (Ωˆ 1 Ωˆ 2 ··· Ωˆ n)† is given by the product of the individual adjoint operators in reverse order.
For an anti-unitary operator it still holds true that Ωˆ † Ωˆ = 1ˆ, since for any two states we have
(φ, ψ)∗ = (Ωˆ φ, Ωˆ ψ) = (Ωˆ † Ωˆ φ, ψ)∗, yielding Ωˆ † Ωˆ = 1ˆ. Note that the transformation |φ −→ Ωˆ |φ
is not generally equivalent to a transformation of the operators that act on these states, in the sense that
(φ, A ψ) −→ (φ
, A ψ
) = (Ωˆ φ, Ωˆ A Ωˆ † Ωˆ ψ) = (Ωˆ φ, Ωˆ A ψ) = (φ, A ψ)
∗ . (16.51)
In the case of a hermitian operator, Eq. (16.51) implies that (φ
, A ψ
) = (ψ, A φ).
An example of an anti-unitary operator is the complex conjugation operator Kˆ. In the Hilbert space
of a single (spinless) particle, we have
(Kˆ φ, Kˆ ψ)=

dr

Kˆ φ(r)
 ∗ 
Kˆ ψ(r)

=

dr

φ∗ (r)

ψ∗ (r)=

dr φ(r) ψ∗ (r) = (φ, ψ)
∗ .
(16.52)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press590 Symmetry Transformations of States and Operators
Note that Kˆ 2 = 1ˆ, implying that Kˆ =Kˆ−1 =Kˆ †. As a matter of fact, any anti-unitary operator Ωˆ can
be written as the product of Kˆ and a unitary operator Uˆ, namely Ωˆ = Uˆ Kˆ: given an Ωˆ , the Uˆ that
effects this is simply Ωˆ Kˆ, since Uˆ Kˆ = Ωˆ Kˆ Kˆ = Ωˆ . In the specific case of the anti-unitary operator
Ωˆ T associated with time reversal, we express it as
Ωˆ T = Uˆ T Kˆ , (16.53)
where Uˆ T is not to be confused with the time translation operator defined in Section 16.1. It is useful
to dwell a little longer on the properties of these operators. Consider a basis |φm in the state space
of a system. The action of Kˆ on a member |φp of this basis is Kˆ |φp = |φp, the reason being that
in such a basis the “wave function” corresponding to |φp is given by the (real) column vector with
zeros in all its entries, except for the entry p which is a 1, and the complex conjugation of such a
vector yields the same vector. Now, suppose we choose a different basis |χm in the state space. In
such a basis, the state |φp is represented as
|φp =

m
c
(p)
m |χm , c
(p)
m = χm|φp , (16.54)
and the corresponding “wave function” is the generally complex column vector |φp −→
[c
(p)
1 , c
(p)
2 , ... , c
(p)
m , ...]
T, where the superscript T indicates the transpose. The action of Kˆ on
|φp is now given by
Kˆ |φp =

m
c
(p)∗ m Kˆ |χm =

m
c
(p)∗ m |χm . (16.55)
We conclude that the effect of Kˆ depends on the representation, that is, on the basis in which we
choose to represent states and operators. For a discussion of this point, see Problem 18.
16.3.2 Transformation of States and Operators under Time Reversal
Spinless particle: Let |φr be a basis of position eigenstates. Under time reversal, we posit that
Ωˆ T |φr = η|φr . (16.56)
In other words, up to a phase factor, the state of a particle localized at r is left unchanged by time
reversal. The relation (16.56) completely defines Ωˆ T ; in particular
Ωˆ T

Ωˆ T |φr
 = Ωˆ T

η |φr

= η∗ Ωˆ T |φr = η∗
η |φr = |φr , (16.57)
which yields
Ωˆ 2
T = 1ˆ for a spinless particle , (16.58)
and hence Ωˆ T = Ωˆ −1
T = Ωˆ †
T . The property Eq. (16.58) is independent of the phase factor η and only
holds for a spinless particle; as we will see below, for a spin-1/2 particle (or, more generally, a
particle with half-integer angular momentum) we have instead Ωˆ 2
T = −1ˆ. Here, we set the arbitrary
phase equal to 1, so that
Ωˆ T |φr = |φr = Ωˆ †
T |φr . (16.59)
A generic state transforms as |ψ −→ |ψ
 = Ωˆ T |ψ, which implies for the associated wave function
ψ
(r) = (φr , ψ
) = (φr , Ωˆ T ψ) = (Ωˆ T Ωˆ T φr , Ωˆ T ψ) = (Ωˆ T φr , ψ)
∗ = ψ∗ (r) . (16.60)
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press591 16.3 Discrete Symmetries: Space Inversion and Time Reversal
In particular, for the wave function of a momentum eigenstate |φp we obtain
(φr , φ
p) = φ
p(r) = φ∗
p(r) = 1
(2π)3/2 e−ip·r/ = (φr , φ−p) , (16.61)
from which we deduce that under time reversal the momentum eigenstates transform as
|φp −→ |φ
p = Ωˆ T |φp = |φ−p , (16.62)
which is what one would naively have expected. As a consequence, the momentum-space wave
function of a time-reversed state is not simply the complex conjugate of the original (momentum￾space) wave function, but rather ψ
(p) = ψ∗ (−p) holds; indeed, we have
(φp , ψ
) 
ψ(p)
= (φp , ΩT ψ) = (ΩT ΩT φp , ΩT ψ) = (ΩT φp , ψ)
∗ = (φ−p , ψ)
∗

ψ∗ (−p)
. (16.63)
Thus, the “time-reversed wave function” depends on the adopted representation: ψ
(r) = ψ∗ (r) in the
position representation and ψ
(p) =ψ∗ (−p) in the momentum representation.
The position and momentum operators transform according to
rˆ −→ rˆ = Ωˆ T rˆ Ωˆ †
T = rˆ , pˆ −→ pˆ  = Ωˆ T pˆ Ωˆ †
T = −pˆ . (16.64)
In the basis |φr, we have, for example,
(φr , p
φr ) = (φr , ΩT p Ω†
T φr ) = (ΩT ΩT φr , ΩT p ΩT φr ) = (ΩT φr , p ΩT φr )
∗
= (φr , p φr )
∗ = i∇ δ(r − r
) = −(φr , p φr ) , (16.65)
where we have used Eq. (16.58), the anti-unitarity of Ωˆ T , and Eq. (16.59). These transformation laws
are the same as those we had inferred in Eq. (16.45) from classical mechanics, and are independent
of the representation. As a consequence of Eq. (16.64), the orbital angular momentum Lˆ is odd
under Ωˆ T :
Lˆ −→ Lˆ  = Ωˆ T Lˆ Ωˆ †
T = −Lˆ . (16.66)
Since according to Eq. (16.60) the eigenfunctions of Lˆ 2 and Lˆz – the spherical harmonics – satisfy
(φrˆ , ψ
l,m) = Y
l,m(rˆ) = Y∗
l,m(rˆ) = (−1)
m Yl,−m(rˆ) = (−1)
m (φrˆ , ψl,−m) , (16.67)
it follows that the eigenstates |ψlm transform as follows:
|ψl,m −→ |ψ
l,m = Ωˆ T |ψl,m = (−1)
m |ψl,−m = i
2m |ψl,−m . (16.68)
It is easily verified that the transformation law above for the states |ψlm is consistent with that of the
angular momentum Lˆ , in the sense that
(ΩT ψl
,m , Li ΩT ψl,m)
∗ = (ψl
,m , L
iψl,m) = −(ψl
,m , Liψl,m) , Lˆ
i = Ωˆ T Li Ωˆ †
T . (16.69)
Spin-1/2 particle: Under time reversal we require, for consistency with the transformation property
of the orbital angular momentum Lˆ , that the spin operator is odd,
Sˆ −→ Sˆ  = Ωˆ T Sˆ Ωˆ †
T = −Sˆ , (16.70)
so that the total angular momentum Jˆ =Lˆ + Sˆ is odd overall. In order to construct Ωˆ T = Uˆ T Kˆ, we
select the basis of eigenstates |ψσ of Sˆ 2 and Sˆ
z with Sˆ
z |ψσ = σ|ψs and σ = ±1/2. In such a basis,
the matrices (ψσ , Sˆ
iψσ ) representing Sˆ
i are (/2) σi
, where σi are the standard Pauli matrices (see
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press592 Symmetry Transformations of States and Operators
Problem 2 of Chapter 11 for their explicit expressions). Recalling that Kˆ † =Kˆ−1 =Kˆ, and further that
Kˆ |ψσ = |ψσ and (a , Kb) = (Ka , b)∗, we find
(ψσ , K Si K†ψσ ) = (Kψσ , Si K†ψσ )
∗ = (ψσ , Siψσ )
∗ . (16.71)
Since the matrices S1 and S3 are real and the matrix S2 is imaginary, the relation above implies that
under Kˆ the operators Sˆ
i transform as follows:
Kˆ Sˆ
1 Kˆ † = Sˆ
1 , Kˆ Sˆ
2 Kˆ † = −Sˆ
2 , Kˆ Sˆ
3 Kˆ † = Sˆ
3 . (16.72)
We are left with the task of determining the unitary operator Uˆ T such that
Uˆ T Sˆ
1 Uˆ†
T = −Sˆ
1 , Uˆ T Sˆ
2 Uˆ†
T = Sˆ
2 , Uˆ T Sˆ
3 Uˆ†
T = −Sˆ
3 . (16.73)
Thus Uˆ T must commute with Sˆ
2 and anticommute with Sˆ
1 and Sˆ
3. Recalling that the Pauli matrices
anticommute with each other and that their square is the identity matrix, an operator Uˆ T that satisfies
these requirements is simply proportional to σ2; we choose
Uˆ T = −iησ2 , (16.74)
where η is a phase factor. In fact, up to the phase factor η, Uˆ T is just the unitary operator inducing a
rotation by π about the axis eˆ2. The time-reversal operator can then be written as4
Ωˆ T = η e−iπSˆ
2/ Kˆ . (16.75)

where the complex conjugation in the intermediate steps (although it has no effect here) comes from
the action of Kˆ. We conclude that Ωˆ T |ψσ = η (−1)1/2−σ |ψ−σ, that is, the time-reversal operator
flips the spin projection (up to a phase factor). The general state |ψ of a spin-1/2 particle can be
represented by the spinor wave function ψ(r) = ψ+(r)|ψ1/2+ψ−(r)|ψ−1/2, and under time reversal

We conclude this section with a comment on the phase convention of the angular momen￾tum eigenstates under time reversal. In our discussion of the orbital angular momentum eigen￾states, we found that with the usual phase convention for the spherical harmonics – that is,
Y∗
l,m(rˆ) = (−1)m Yl,−m(rˆ) – it was convenient to fix the phase of these states under time reversal as

that different authors adopt different phase conventions)

such as the translation above, the spectra of the original and transformed observables are the same,
and the eigenvalues of Hˆ are n = ω(n + 1/2) − b, where n is a non-negative integer. The eigenstates

Problem 3 Periodic Potential and Bloch Waves
Consider a particle in one dimension in a periodic potential such that V(x − L) = V(x), where
L is a fixed displacement. Using only symmetry arguments, show that the eigenfunctions of the
Hamiltonian have the form of Bloch waves, given by
ϕ(q)
m (x) = eiqx/ u(q)
m (x) , −π/L < q ≤ π/L ,
where u(q)
m (x) is a periodic function of period L.
Solution
The Hamiltonian describing this system,
Hˆ = pˆ
2
2m
+ Vˆ(xˆ) , Vˆ(xˆ − L) = Vˆ(xˆ) ,
is not invariant under a generic translation. However, it is invariant under a subgroup of translations,
namely translations by a multiple of L (an example of a discrete transformation), since
UˆT(L) Vˆ(xˆ) Uˆ†
T(L) = Vˆ(xˆ − L) = Vˆ(xˆ) =⇒ 
UˆT(L) , Hˆ  = 0 .
The last relation says that UˆT(L) and Hˆ can be diagonalized simultaneously. The eigenstates of the
unitary operator UˆT(L) are the same as those of the momentum operator ˆp; indeed, we have
UˆT(L)|ψq = e−iqL/ |ψq .
However, each eigenvalue e−iqL/ (which is a phase factor, since UˆT(L) is unitary) is infinitely
degenerate: the eigenstates |ψq+(2π/L)n with n = 0, ±1, ±2, ... all have the same eigenvalue e−iqL/,
UˆT(L)|ψq+(2π/L)n = e−i[q+(2π/L)n]L/ |ψq+(2π/L)n = e−iqL/ e−i2πn

|ψq+(2π/L)n .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press595 16.4 Problems
As a consequence, we can restrict q to values in an interval of length 2π/L, say −π/L < q ≤
π/L. Then, each eigenvalue e−iqL/ with q restricted to this range is infinitely degenerate, with
corresponding eigenstates given by
|ψq , |ψq±2π/L , |ψq±4π/L , ... = |ψq+2πn/L

Since the Hamiltonian commutes with UˆT(L), its matrix elements between eigenstates of UˆT(L)
belonging to different eigenvalues vanish,
ψk+2πm/L| H |ψq+2πn/L = 0 if k  q .
However, provided that k = q, there is no restriction on the m and n values, and the Hamiltonian will
generally have non-vanishing matrix elements in the degenerate subspace spanned by the eigenstates
belonging to a given eigenvalue e−iqL/ of UˆT(L). In other words, in the basis of eigenstates of UˆT(L),
Hˆ will be represented by a block matrix:

it is sufficient to diagonalize each block independently, setting det(H(qi) − E) = 0, in order to
determine the eigenvalues E(qi) m with m = 1, 2, ... in that block; some of these eigenvalues may be
degenerate. The corresponding eigenstates are |ϕ(qi) m  with the superscript qi specifying the block

and this function is periodic in L. Thus we have derived the interesting result that in a periodic
potential the eigenvalues are of the form E(q)
m , where q varies continuously in the range −π/L < q ≤
π/L and m varies over discrete values. For a fixed value of m, these eigenvalues occupy a band. The
corresponding eigenfunctions are given in the text of the problem, and are known as Bloch waves.
We emphasize that this result was derived solely from the invariance of Hˆ under translations by L.
The result above is relevant in solid-state physics. A crystal consists of a regular lattice of
atoms or molecules. Such a lattice is generally invariant under translations r −→ r − Lr, where
L1, L2, L3 are three independent displacement vectors. For example, a cubic lattice of side L
is invariant under translations by L xˆ and/or L yˆ and/or L zˆ. The Hamiltonian that describes the
interactions of an electron with the crystal lattice is therefore invariant under the translations
induced by the three unitary operators UT(Lr). As a consequence, it has eigenvalues E(q)
m and
eigenfunctions ϕ(q) m (r) = eiq·r/ u(q)
m (r), with u(q)
m (r) = u(q)
m (r − Lr) and q varying continuously in the
ranges |q ·Lr| ≤ π for r = 1, 2, and 3; in particular, for a cubic lattice, we have −π/L < qx ≤ π/L
and similarly for qy and qz.
Problem 4 Periodic Potential and Bloch Waves: An Alternative Treatment
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential V(x) with V(x + a) = V(x). In order to
preserve the physics under a translation by a, the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian must be such that
ρ(x + a) = ρ(x) and j(x + a) = j(x) ,
where ρ(x) and j(x) are, respectively, the probability density and probability current density.
1. Show that the two conditions above require
ψ(x + a) = eiφ ψ(x) , φ = constant .
2. Set the constant φ = qa and write the solution ψq (x) ≡ eiqx uq (x). By substituting into the relation
between ψq (x + a) and ψq (x) obtained above, show that the function uq (x) must be periodic in a,
namely uq (x + a) = uq (x).
3. Rather than assuming the crystal lattice to be of infinite length, let its length be L, that is, L =Na
with N, say, an even integer much greater than 2. Use periodic boundary conditions,
ψq (x + L) = ψq (x) ,
to show that the wave number q is restricted to the range −π ≤ qa < π with
qp = 2πp
Na , p = 0, ±1, ... , ±

Solution
Part 1
The condition on the probability density |ψ(x + a)|
2 = |ψ(x)|
2 implies that
ψ(x + a) = eiφ(x) ψ(x) , φ(x) a real function of x .
The probability current density at x + a then follows:
j(x + a)=

2 ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press597 16.4 Problems
and the last term must vanish, requiring φ(x) to be constant. This yields the required result, ψ(x+a) =
eiφ ψ(x).
Part 2
Defining ψq (x) ≡ eiqx uq (x) and using the relation ψq (x + a) = eiqa ψq (x) obtained above, we find
ψq (x + a) = eiq(x+a) uq (x + a) = eiqa ψq (x) = eiqa eiqx uq (x) =⇒ uq (x + a) = uq (x) ,
and so the function uq (x) is periodic with period a.
Part 3
Using the result in part 1 N times, we obtain
ψq (x + Na) = eiqa ψq[x + (N − 1)a] = ··· = eiqNa ψq (x) .
Imposing the periodic boundary condition ψq (x + Na) = ψq (x) yields
eiqNa = 1 =⇒ qk = 2πk
Na , k = 0, ±1, ... , ±
N − 1
2 , −N
2
and there are N distinct qk-values in the interval [−π/2, π/2[. Note that the shift k −→ k + N or
aqk −→ aqk + 2π does not lead to a new, linearly independent, solution.

Part 1
In region Rn the Schrodinger equation is given by ¨

n (x) + k2ψn (x) = 0 ,
which has the solution
ψn (x) = A
n eikx + B
n e−ikx = An eik(x−na) + Bn e−ik(x−na) .
Similarly, in region Rn+1 we have
ψn+1 (x) = An+1 eik[x−(n+1)a] + Bn+1 e−ik[x−(n+1)a] .
We now impose the boundary conditions at x = na, namely
ψn (na) = ψn+1 (na) , ψ
n+1 (na) − ψ
n (na) = λ
a ψn (na) ,
where the discontinuity of the derivative is due to the presence of the δ-function potential at na.

Use of the Bloch-wave condition between these wave functions in Rn and Rn+1 (if x is in region Rn
then x + a is in region Rn+1), namely
ψn+1 (x + a) = eiqa ψn (x) ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press599 16.4 Problems

An eik(x−na) + Bn e−ik(x−na)

requiring
An+1 = eiqa An , Bn+1 = eiqa Bn .

are gaps between the ξs belonging to different intervals. These gaps become smaller and smaller as

which has the solution ξ = qa = 2πp/N, in agreement with the result above.
By contrast, in the limit λ −→ ∞, the solutions of the eigenvalue equation are ξn = nπ and are
independent of p. In this limit, the intervals 1, 2, . . . shrink to points, which are the ξn exactly (a
glance at Fig. 16.1 above makes this obvious). At these values F(ξn) = (−1)n, independently of λ.
Thus, we see that in this “tight-binding limit” the energy eigenvalues reduce to those of a particle
confined in a segment of length a; namely, the particle is confined in one of the regions Rn.

Problem 7 Explicit Expression for the Rotation Operator in Spin Space
Show that the rotation operator in spin space is given by
Uˆs
R(ϕnˆ) = cos(ϕ/2) − i sin(ϕ/2) nˆ · σ .
Consider a particle in a state |+ along the z-direction. Suppose that it is subject to a (counterclock￾wise) rotation by ϕ about the x-direction. Show that the resulting state is an eigenstate of the Sˆ
component along the direction (0, − sin ϕ, cos ϕ) with eigenvalue /2.
Solution
In spin space, we have

resulting in the expression given in the text of the problem. In the specific case of rotation by ϕ about
the x-direction, namely nˆ = (1, 0, 0), we have
Uˆs
R(ϕ eˆx) = cos(ϕ/2) − i sin(ϕ/2) σ x =

,
so that
|+
 = Uˆs
R(ϕ eˆx)|+ = cos(ϕ/2) |+ − i sin(ϕ/2) |− .
The state |+ represents a particle polarized in the direction (0, − sin ϕ, cos ϕ) in the yz-plane, and
hence it must be an eigenstate of the spin operator along this direction with eigenvalue +/2,

where we have made use of the identities cos ϕ = 2 cos2 (ϕ/2) − 1 and sin ϕ = 2 sin(ϕ/2) cos(ϕ/2).
We also see that under a rotation by 2π the state |+ differs from |+ by the phase factor −1. This is
obvious from the relation Uˆs
R(2π nˆ) = −1ˆ. Finally, we note that the spin operator − sin ϕ Sˆ

Problem 8 Rotation by 2π
Consider a single particle and show that the rotation operator UR(2πnˆ) is ± 1ˆ, depending on whether
the particle has integer (+ sign) or half-integer (– sign) spin. Show that a 2π rotation of a system
containing an even or odd number of particles with half-integer spins (and any number of particles
with integer spins) is equal to plus or minus the identity operator.
Solution
Consider a generic state |ψ of a single particle and expand it in a basis of eigenstates |φαjm of Jˆ2
and nˆ · Jˆ and other observables commuting with them (in other words, Jˆ2 and nˆ · Jˆ along with the
other observables form a complete set of commuting observables); here α denotes collectively the
eigenvalues corresponding to these other observables. We have
|ψ =

αjm
cαjm|φαjm , cαjm = φαjm|ψ ,
and
UˆR(2πnˆ)|ψ =

αjm
cαjm UˆR(2πnˆ)|φαjm =

αjm
cαjm e−2πim |φαjm =

αjm
(−1)
2m cαjm|φαjm = ± |ψ ,
where we have used the eigenstate property nˆ · Jˆ |φαjm = m |φαjm. The phase (−1)2m is either +1
or −1 depending on whether j is either integer or half-integer. The last step in the equation above
follows because if the particle has integer spin, only integer j can occur in the sum over j and 2m is
always even whereas if the particle has half-integer spin, only half-integer j enter the sum and 2m is
always odd (if the particle has integer spin, the total angular momentum J =L + S assumes integer
values; conversely, if the particle has half-integer spin, the total angular momentum assumes half￾integer values). These conclusions also apply to the case in which |ψ represents the state of a system
consisting of any number of particles having integer spins and either an even or an odd number of
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press603 16.4 Problems
particles with half-integer spins. In the former case, the total angular momentum can only assume
integer values, while in the latter it can only assume half-integer values.
Problem 9 Consequences of Rotational Invariance
Show that a state |ψ is rotationally invariant iff Jˆ |ψ = 0. Let Aˆ be a scalar operator and |ψαjm a
basis of simultaneous eigenstates of a complete set of commuting observables, including Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z
(α denotes collectively the eigenvalues of the remaining observables). Derive selection rules for the
matrix elements ψαjm| Aˆ |ψαj
m and show, in particular, that these matrix elements are independent
of the azimuthal quantum numbers.
Solution
A state |ψ is invariant under rotations when |ψ −→ |ψ
 = UˆR(ϕnˆ)|ψ = |ψ for any choice of the
rotation axis nˆ. For an infinitesimal rotation, this condition leads to
|ψ
 = 
1ˆ − iη nˆ · Jˆ/

|ψ = |ψ =⇒ nˆ · Jˆ |ψ = 0 for any nˆ ,
which implies Jˆ |ψ = 0. The converse statement is obviously true: if Jˆ |ψ = 0 then the state is
rotationally invariant. For example, in the case of a spinless particle the state |ψ is rotationally
invariant when the corresponding wave function ψ(r) is a function only of the magnitude |r|, since
then ψ
(|r|) = ψ(|R−1r|) = ψ(|r|).
A necessary and sufficient condition for an operator Aˆ to be invariant under rotations – that is, to
be a scalar operator – is that it commutes with Jˆ (the generator of rotations), in which case Aˆ −→
Aˆ = UˆR(ϕnˆ) Aˆ Uˆ†
R(ϕnˆ) = Aˆ. Now, an operator that commutes with Jˆ also commutes with Jˆ2, and
hence matrix elements of Aˆ between eigenstates of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z belonging to different eigenvalues
vanish,
ψαjm| Aˆ |ψαj
m = 0 if j  j
 and/or m  m ;
generally, there are no restrictions on α and α
. Further, using
|ψαjm = 1


j(j + 1) − m(m − 1)
Jˆ
+ |ψαj,m−1 , |ψαj,m−1 = 1


j(j + 1) − m(m − 1)
Jˆ
− |ψαjm ,
and ψαjm| Jˆ
+ = (Jˆ
− |ψαjm)†, we conclude that the matrix elements are independent of m,
ψαjm| Aˆ |ψαjm = ψαjm| Aˆ Jˆ
+|ψαj,m−1


j(j + 1) − m(m − 1)
= (ψαjm|Jˆ
+) Aˆ|ψαj,m−1


j(j + 1) − m(m − 1)
= ψαj,m−1 | Aˆ |ψαj,m−1 .
Lastly, if the state |ψαjm happens to be also an eigenstate of Aˆ (because, for example, Aˆ is one of
the observables in the complete set) and Aˆ |ψαjm = a |ψαjm, then the eigenvalue a is (2j + 1)-fold
degenerate, since
Aˆ Jˆ
± |ψαjm  ∝ |ψαj(m±1)
= Jˆ
± Aˆ |ψαjm = aJˆ
± |ψαjm ,
and the 2j + 1 states |ψαj,−j, |ψαj,−(j−1), ... , |ψαj,+j each have the same eigenvalue a. Therefore,
the rotational invariance of the Hamiltonian implies, at least, the (2j + 1)-degeneracy of each of
its eigenvalues. Of course, if additional symmetries are present, as in the case of the Coulomb or
harmonic oscillator potentials, the degeneracy can be larger.

Problem 10 Matrix Elements of Vector Operators and Rotations
Let |lm be the basis of eigenstates of L2 and Lz, with eigenvalues l(l + 1)2 and m, respectively,
and let UR(ϕzˆ) be the unitary operator inducing a rotation by ϕ about the z-axis,
UR(ϕzˆ) = e−iϕLz/ .

expressions consistent with the transformation law under rotations of vector operators discussed
in Section 16.2?
3. Let V be a generic vector operator. Calculate the commutators [Vx ± iVy , Lz] and [Vz, Lz]. Show
that the states (Vx ±iVy)|lm and Vz|lm are eigenstates of Lz and calculate their eigenvalues. What
relation must exist between m and m for the matrix element l

m

Consider the same question for l

m
|Vz|lm.
4. By comparing the matrix elements of V

z with those of Vx ± iVy and Vz, calculate V
x,

z in terms of Vx, Vy, and Vz.
Solution
Part 1
Consider

l(l + 1) − m(m + 1) e−iϕLz/ |l(m + 1) = e−iϕ L+|lm ,

Problem 11 Transformation of a Spin-1/2 Angular Momentum Operator

Problem 13 Construction of a Spin State Polarized Along a Generic Direction nˆ
Given the spin-1/2 state |+ with Sˆ
z|+ = (/2)|+ (that is, the state is polarized along the zˆ-axis), we
want to construct the spin state |+ polarized along a direction
nˆ = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) ,
such that
nˆ · Sˆ |+

 .
1. Show that this can be accomplished by a sequence of two rotations, the first by θ about the yˆ-axis
and the second by φ about the zˆ-axis. Using this insight, construct the state |+ explicitly.
2. The state |+ can also be obtained by solving the above eigenvalue problem explicitly, namely
nˆ · Sˆ |+ = (/2) |+
. Do so and compare the result with that obtained in part 1.
Solution
Part 1

Problem 15 Consequences of Space Inversion Symmetry
Obtain the selection rules for an operator Aˆ that is either odd or even under space inversion.
Solution
Since UˆP is hermitian, it can be thought of as an observable, and, since its square is the identity
operator, its eigenvalues are ±1. Let |ψa and |ψb be eigenstates of UˆP with eigenvalues πa and πb,
respectively, and let Aˆ be an operator that is odd under space inversion, so that, UˆP Aˆ UˆP = −Aˆ. The
matrix element ψa | Aˆ |ψb vanishes unless πaπb = −1, namely the states have opposite parity, since
(ψa , Aˆ ψb) = −(ψa , UP A Uˆ P ψb) = −(UP ψa , A Uˆ P ψb) = −πa πb (ψa , Aˆ ψb) .
Similarly, an even operator, UˆP Aˆ UˆP = Aˆ, has non-vanishing matrix elements only between states of
the same parity.
Space inversion symmetry leads to selection rules in the most common radiative transitions
occurring in atoms. As we will see, in the approximation in which the wavelength of the emitted
(or absorbed) photon is much larger than the atomic radius, the transition rate is proportional to the
magnitude squared of the electric-dipole-operator matrix element; in hydrogen, for example, this
operator is simply given by Dˆ = −e rˆ and is odd under space inversion. It follows that the transition
must involve states of opposite parities. The parity of the states (in hydrogen) is simply (−1)l and
therefore we must have (−1)la+lb = −1; for instance, the transitions 2p  1s are allowed, while
3p  2p are not.

Problem 16 A Model for the Ammonia Molecule and Broken Parity Symmetry
In the ammonia molecule NH3, the three hydrogen atoms lie at the corners of an equilateral triangle
and the nitrogen atom moves along a line transverse to the plane of the triangle passing through its
center. Let x be the position of the N atom along this line. The N atom can be on either side of the
triangle. A simple model for the potential felt by the N atom is given by
V(|x| > b) = ∞ , V(a < |x| < b) = 0 , V(|x| < a) = V0 ,
where the barrier V0 > 0 represents the Coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the
hydrogen and nitrogen nuclei. Note that V(x) is invariant under space inversion, V(x) = V(−x).
1. Discuss the nature of the energy spectrum. What is the parity of the ground state? And that of the
first-excited state? Define, respectively, as I, II, and III the regions −b < x < −a, −a < x < a, and
a < x < b. Assume E < V0 and show that the eigenvalues of the even- and odd-parity solutions
result from
cot[k(b − a)] = −κ
k tanh(κa) , even parity ,
and
tan[k(b − a)] = − k
κ
tanh(κa) , odd parity ,
where (in the notation of Section 4.1)
k = √
 , κ = √
v0 −  .
2. Hereafter, assume that the energies of the ground state (of even parity) and first excited state (of
odd parity) are much less than V0, and show that these energies are given by
Ee ≈ (π)2
2m(b − a)2 (1 − 2ηe) , Eo ≈ (π)2
2m(b − a)2 (1 − 2ηo) ,
where ηe, ηo ( 1) are given by
ηe = coth(a
√v0)
(b − a)
√v0
, ηo = tanh(a
√v0)
(b − a)
√v0
.
Obtain the corresponding wave functions (up to overall normalization factors), and briefly
comment on them.
3. Consider the states
ψR(x) = 1

ψe
(x) + ψo (x)

, ψL(x) = 1
√
2


.
Are ψR(x) and ψL(x) eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian? Are they eigenfunctions of the parity
operator UP? Where are ψR(x) and ψL(x) mostly non-vanishing? At time t = 0 the N atom is in
the state represented by ψL(x), namely
Ψ(x, 0) = ψL(x) .
Obtain Ψ(x, t). Show that the N atom oscillates between the left- and right-hand potential well
with period T = h/ΔE, where the energy difference ΔE = Eo − Ee is given by
ΔE ≈ (π)2
m(b − a)2 (ηe − ηo) ≈ (2π)2
m(b − a)3√v0
e−2a
√v0 .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press613 16.4 Problems
The time T/2 necessary for the N atom to tunnel through the barrier and materialize in the right￾hand well will be very long. So, it happens that the broken symmetry wave function ψL(x),
which is not an eigenfunction of the parity operator but is very nearly an eigenfunction of
the Hamiltonian (for a very high barrier), represents the physical state realized in nature. This
phenomenon explains why certain molecules only exist in L or R states. These L and R states are
separated by very thick barriers. For such molecules the transition from one broken symmetry
state ψL(x) to the other ψR(x) takes so long as to be unobservable.
4. Now consider the case in which the barrier V0 is infinitely high. What happens to the energies of
the even and odd solutions ψe (x) and ψo (x)? Sketch these wave functions. Are ψL(x) and ψR(x)
eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian? Sketch ψL(x) and ψR(x). Are they eigenfunctions of the parity
operator? If the N atom is in the left-hand well can it ever be found in the right-hand well?
Solution
Part 1
Only bound states are possible. The states have alternating parities: even, odd, even, odd, and so on,
the ground and first excited states being even and odd, respectively. We have, for energies E < V0,
ψ
I = −k2ψI(x) , ψ
II = κ2ψII(x) , ψ
III = −k2ψIII(x) ,
where k = √
 and κ = √v0 − . We can solve for, say, x > 0, and then obtain the complete solution
in −b < x < b by exploiting the known parity of the state. In particular, the first derivatives of
even-parity solutions ψe (x) and the odd-parity solutions ψo (x) vanish at x = 0, namely
ψe 
(0) = 0 , ψo (0) = 0 .
For x > 0, we have
ψII(x) = A cosh(κx) , ψIII(x) = B sin[k(b − x)] , even parity ,
ψII(x) = C sinh(κx) , ψIII(x) = D sin[k(b − x)] , odd parity ,
where the boundary condition ψIII(b) = 0 has already been imposed. It should be noted that these
solutions also satisfy the requirements ψe 
(0) = 0 and ψo (0) = 0. The boundary conditions at x = a
yield
A cosh(κa) = B sin[k(b − a)] , κA sinh(κa) = −kB cos[k(b − a)] ,
C sinh(κa) = D sin[k(b − a)] , κC cosh(κa) = −kD cos[k(b − a)] ,
and the eigenvalues result from
tanh(κa) = − k
κ
cot[k(b − a)] , even parity , tanh(κa) = −κ
k tan[k(b − a)] , odd parity .
The complete even-parity solutions are then
ψe
I (x) = B sin[ke (b + x)] , ψe
II(x) = A cosh(κex) , ψe
III(x) = B sin[ke (b − x)] ,
and the odd-parity solutions are
ψo
I (x) = −D sin[ko (b + x)] , ψo
II(x) = C sinh(κox) , ψo
III(x) = D sin[ko (b − x)] ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press614 Symmetry Transformations of States and Operators
where, having determined the eigenvalues e and o, we can express A and C in terms of B and D:
A = sin[ke (b − a)]
cosh(κea)
B , C = sin[ko (b − a)]
sinh(κoa)
D ,
and |B| and |D| can be fixed by normalizing the states. Here, we have defined
ke = √e , κe = √
v0 − e ,
and similarly for ko and κo.
Part 2
In the limit v0 
 e and v0 
 o the eigenvalue equations for e and o read
cot[ke (b − a)] = −
√v0
ke
tanh(
√v0 a) , tan[ko (b − a)] = − ko √v0
tanh(
√v0 a) .
Note that the cotangent and tangent vanish for, respectively,
kn = π
b − a
2n − 1
2 , kn = π
b − a
n n = 1, 2, ... .
A plot of the cotangent shows that the first intersection of cot[ke (b − a)] with the function
−(
√v0/ke) tanh(
√v0 a) −→ −∞ occurs when the argument k(b − a) −→ π from below. The Taylor
expansion of tan x about π gives
tan x ≈ tan π +
1
cos2 π
(x − π) + ··· = x − π + ··· ,
and therefore cot x can be expanded as
cot x = 1
tan x ≈ 1
x − π ,
and
1
ke (b − a) − π ≈ −
√v0
ke
tanh(
√v0 a) ,
which can be solved for ke to give
ke ≈ π
b − a + coth(
√v0 a)/
√v0

b − a
1
1 + ηe
≈ π
b − a
(1 − ηe) ,
where we have defined η  1 as
ηe = coth(a
√v0)
(b − a)
√v0
.
For the odd solutions we note that the first intersection of the tangent with the function
−(ko/
√v0) tanh(
√v0 a) also occurs when the argument ko (b − a) −→ π from below, and hence
ko (b − a) − π ≈ − ko √v0
tanh(
√v0 a) ,
yielding
ko ≈ π
b − a + tanh(
√v0 a)/
√v0

where
ηo = tanh(a
√v0)
(b − a)
√v0
.
The energies are given by
Ee ≈ (π)2
2m(b − a)2 (1 − 2ηe) , Eo ≈ (π)2
2m(b − a)2 (1 − 2ηo) ,
and for the energy difference ΔE = Eo − Ee > 0 we have
ΔE ≈ (π)2
m(b − a)2 (ηe − ηo) ,
where
ηe − ηo = coth(
√v0 a) − tanh(
√v0 a)
(b − a)
√v0
≈ 4
(b − a)
√v0
e−2a
√v0 > 0 .
We have used the expansion
coth z − tanh z = ez + e−z
ez − e−z − ez − e−z
ez + e−z = 4
e2z − e−2z −→ 4 e−2z for z −→ ∞ .
In the same limit v0 
 , we find that, for the even solution,
A
B = sin[ke (b − a)]
cosh(κea) ≈ 2 e−a
√v0 sin(π − πηe) ≈ 2π e−a
√v0 ηe ≈ 2π
e−a
√v0
(b − a)
√v0
,
and similarly, for the odd solution,
C
D ≈ 2π
e−a
√v0
(b − a)
√v0
.
The complete ground-state (even-parity) solution then reads (up to the normalization constant B)
ψe
I (x) = sin[ke (b + x)] , ψe
II(x) = 2π
e−a
√v0
(b − a)
√v0
cosh(
√v0 x) , ψe
III(x) = sin[ke (b − x)] ,
and the odd-parity solutions are (up to the normalization constant D)
ψo
I (x)=− sin[ko (b + x)] , ψo
II(x)=2π
e−a
√v0
(b − a)
√v0
sinh(
√v0 x) , ψo
III(x)=sin[ko (b − x)];
the solutions in the classically forbidden region |x| < a are strongly suppressed. In the limit that
we are considering, we have ke = k0 up to exponentially small corrections, and the normalization
constants |B| and |D| are approximately the same.

and UPψL(x) = ψR(x), and so the parity operator transforms one wave function into the other. In
particular, we have that ψR(x) is non-vanishing primarily in the right-hand well a < x < b (region
III) and ψL(x) is non-vanishing primarily in the left-hand well −b < x < −a (region I); for example,

−B sin[ke (b + x)] − D sin[ko (b + x)] ≈ 0 up to terms ∝ e−2a

As time increases the particle will oscillate between the left- and right-hand wells with angular
frequency ω = ΔE/: at time π/ω it will be in the right-hand well, at time 2π/ω in the left-hand
well, at time 3π/ω back in the right-hand well, and so on. In essence, if the particle is initially in the
left-hand well then it penetrates the classically forbidden region and materializes on the other side of
the barrier, in the right-hand well, and then goes back to the left-hand well, and so on. The leaking
from one well to the other will occur in a time π/ω ∝ e2a
√v0 ; this time will be very long if the barrier
is very high, of course.
Part 4
In the limit v0 −→ ∞, we have left-hand and right-hand infinite wells, located symmetrically on
each side of the origin. The Hamiltonian H is still invariant under space inversion. The even and
odd wave functions now have the same energy; they are degenerate eigenfunctions of H. So are
the linear combinations ψL(x) and ψR(x). However, the latter are not eigenfunctions of the parity
operator. In particular, if the system is found in state ψL(x) then it will remain in that state forever,
since the tunneling probability vanishes in this case (the time required for the particle to materialize
on the other side becomes infinite). In the presence of degeneracy, the physically realized state is not
necessarily an eigenstate of the parity operator, even though H is invariant under parity. The double￾well problem provides a simple illustration of broken symmetry: we have an asymmetrical ground
state in spite of the fact that H is symmetric under space inversion.
Problem 17 Unitarity Implies Linearity and Anti-Unitarity Implies Antilinearity
Show that a unitary operator is necessarily linear and, conversely, that an anti-unitary operator is
necessarily antilinear.
Solution
A unitary operator Uˆ is defined by the property (Uφ, Uψ) = (φ, ψ) for any two states |φ and |ψ.
To show that it is also necessarily linear, consider the state
|ϕ = Uˆ(α|φ + β|ψ) − α Uˆ |φ − β Uˆ |ψ ,
where α and β are generally complex constants. Using only the unitarity condition, we obtain, for
the squared norm of |ϕ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press617 16.4 Problems
(ϕ, ϕ) = (Uˆ(αφ + βψ) − α Uˆφ − β Uˆψ , Uˆ(αφ + βψ) − α Uˆφ − β Uˆψ)
= (αφ + βψ , αφ + βψ) − α(αφ + βψ , φ) − β(αφ + βψ , ψ) − α∗ (φ , αφ + β ψ)
+|α|
2 (φ, φ) + α∗
β(φ, ψ) − β∗ (ψ , α φ + βψ) + αβ∗ (ψ, φ) + |β|
2 (ψ, ψ) = 0 ,
and so |ϕ is the null state, which in turn implies the linearity of Uˆ. A similar proof holds for an
anti-unitary operator Ωˆ .
Problem 18 The Unitary Operator Uˆ
T in Ωˆ T = Uˆ
T ˆ
K Depends on the Representation
In Section 16.3.1 we noted that the anti-unitary time-reversal operator Ωˆ T can be written as the
product of a unitary operator Uˆ T and the anti-unitary operator Kˆ for hermitian conjugation, namely
Ωˆ T = Uˆ T Kˆ. We also noted that the effect of Kˆ (and hence Uˆ T ) depends on the basis that we have
chosen to represent states and operators. Specifically, show that, in the basis of position eigenstates,
Uˆ T is the identity operator whereas in the basis of momentum eigenstates it is the parity operator UˆP.
Solution
Under time reversal, we have rˆ −→ r = r and pˆ −→ p = −p. Now, consider first the basis of
position eigenstates. Under Kˆ, these eigenstates transform as Kˆ |φr = |φr; furthermore, recalling
that Kˆ 2 = 1ˆ and Kˆ =Kˆ †, we find that the momentum operator transforms as
(φr , Kˆ pˆ Kˆ † φr ) = (Kˆ 2 φr , Kˆ pˆ Kˆ φr ) = (Kˆ φr , pˆ Kˆ φr )
∗ = (φr , pˆ φr )
∗
= [−i∇r δ(r − r
)]
∗ = (φr , −pˆ φr ) ,
or Kˆ pˆ Kˆ † = −pˆ; a similar proof shows that Kˆ rˆ Kˆ † = rˆ. We conclude that in the basis of position
eigenstates Uˆ T = 1ˆ, up to an arbitrary phase factor, which has been set to 1 as in Eq. (16.59), and
hence Ωˆ T =Kˆ.
Consider next the basis of momentum eigenstates |φp. Since Kˆ |φp = |φp, it follows that
(φp , Kˆ rˆ Kˆ † φp ) = (Kˆ 2 φp , Kˆ rˆ Kˆ φp ) = (Kˆ φp , rˆ Kˆ φp )
∗ = (φp , rˆ φp )
∗
= 
i ∇p δ(p − p
)
 ∗ = (φp , −rˆ φp ) .
In a similar fashion, we find that (φp , Kˆ pˆ Kˆ † φp ) = (φp , pˆ φp ), and in the basis of momentum
eigenstates Kˆ rˆ Kˆ † = −rˆ and Kˆ pˆ Kˆ † = pˆ. Therefore, in such a basis the unitary operator Uˆ T must satisfy
Uˆ T rˆ Uˆ†
T = −rˆ , Uˆ T pˆ Uˆ†
T = −pˆ ,
in order for Ωˆ T to induce the correct transformations of rˆ and pˆ. Since Uˆ T induces the same
transformations as the space inversion (unitary) operator UˆP, we conclude that, in the basis of
momentum eigenstates, Ωˆ T = UˆP Kˆ.
Problem 19 Time Evolution of a State and of Its Time-Reversed Partner
Let |ψ(0) be the state of a system at time t = 0 and |ψ
(0) = Ωˆ T |ψ(0) the corresponding time￾reversed state. Assume that the Hamiltonian describing this system is time-reversal invariant.
Establish the relation between the time-evolved states |ψ(t) and |ψ
(t).

(0) evolve in time independently according to
|ψ(t) = e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) , |ψ

(t) are related to each
other via
|ψ
(t) = e−iHtˆ / Ωˆ T |ψ(0) = Ωˆ T e+iHtˆ / |ψ(0) = Ωˆ T |ψ(−t) ,

Problem 20 On Eigenfunctions of Non-Degenerate Eigenvalues
of a Time-Reversal-Invariant Observable
Show that the eigenfunctions corresponding to non-degenerate eigenvalues of a time-reversal￾invariant observable Aˆ can be chosen to be real up to an overall phase factor.
Solution
Since the observable Aˆ is taken to be invariant under time reversal, it commutes with Ωˆ T . Hence,
if |ψ is an eigenstate of Aˆ, so is the state |ψ
 = Ωˆ T |ψ. By assumption, the eigenvalue is non￾degenerate and so |ψ
 = eiα |ψ (α real), that is, these two states can differ by at most a phase
factor. On the other hand, the time-reversed wave function ψ
(r) is simply ψ∗ (r). We conclude
that ψ∗ (r) = eiα ψ(r). Note that the assumption of non-degeneracy is crucial. For example, the
Hamiltonian of a free particle is time-reversal invariant; however, each eigenvalue Ep = p2/(2m) is
infinitely degenerate, and the corresponding eigenfunctions eipnˆ ·r//(2π)3/2 are complex; here, nˆ is
the arbitrary direction of the momentum p.
Problem 21 Transformation of States under Ωˆ 2
T ; Kramers’Degeneracy
Consider the action of Ωˆ 2
T on the spinor wave function of a single spin-1/2 particle and then
on a spinor wave function representing the state of N spin-1/2 particles; show that Ωˆ 2
T = (−1)N1ˆ.
Show further that this implies that the eigenstates |ψJM of the total angular momentum Jˆ2 and
component Jˆ
z of an N-spin-1/2-particle system must also be eigenstates of Ωˆ 2
T , with eigenvalues
(−1)2J
. Next, suppose that the Hamiltonian of such a system consisting of an odd number of particles
is time-reversal invariant: deduce that its eigenvalues are at least two-fold degenerate (Kramers’
degeneracy).
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press619 16.4 Problems

Consider a single spin-1/2 particle. Using Eq. (16.77), we find

and therefore Ωˆ 2
T = −1ˆ. For a system of N spin-1/2 particles (not necessarily identical), it follows
similarly that under the action of Ωˆ 2
T the spinor wave function ψ(r1, ... , rN), given by
ψ(r1, ... , rN) =

s1,...sN
ψs1,...,sN (r1, ... rN)|s1, ... ,sN ,
transforms as follows (Ωˆ 2
T acts on each individual particle, yielding a factor –1):
Ωˆ 2
T ψ(r1, ... , rN) = (−1)
Nψ(r1, ... , rn) =⇒ Ωˆ 2
T = (−1)
N 1ˆ ,
that is, Ωˆ 2
T is either plus or minus the identity, depending on whether N is even or odd. Suppose
we now expand this N-particle state in a basis |JM of eigenstates of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z, where J is the total
angular momentum. The latter is obtained by combining the angular momenta Ji =Li + Si of the N
particles, and J will be integer (half-integer) depending on whether N is even (odd), that is,
|ψ =

J=0,1,...

J
M=−J
cJM|ψJM if N even , |ψ =

J=1/2,3/2,...

J
M=−J
cJM|ψJM if N odd .
Consistency with the equation derived above, Ωˆ 2
T = (−1)N1ˆ, requires that
Ωˆ 2
T |ψJM = |ψJM if J integer , Ωˆ 2
T |ψJM = −|ψJM if J half-integer ,
which says that |ψJM are eigenstates of Ωˆ 2
T with eigenvalues (−1)2J
.
A consequence of invariance under time reversal is Kramers’ degeneracy. If |ψ is an eigenstate
of a time-reversal-invariant Hamiltonian Hˆ with eigenvalue E then Ωˆ T |ψ is also an eigenstate of Hˆ
corresponding to the same eigenvalue E. Suppose that the eigenvalue E is non-degenerate; then |ψ
and Ωˆ T |ψ can differ only by a phase factor, namely
Ωˆ T |ψ = eiα |ψ if E non-degenerate .
On the other hand, applying Ωˆ T to both sides of the relation above yields
Ωˆ 2
T |ψ = Ωˆ T

Ωˆ T |ψ
 = e−iα Ωˆ T |ψ = e−iα eiα |ψ = |ψ .
But this property is inconsistent with the property Ωˆ 2
T =−1ˆ that we have established for a system
containing an odd number of spin-1/2 particles. Therefore we conclude that for such a system |ψ
and Ωˆ T |ψ must be independent states, namely, there must be at least two-fold degeneracy.

where |ϕk and |ϕk are free-particle states, and the Tˆ operator is defined as follows:
Tˆ = Vˆ + Vˆ 1
Ek − Hˆ0 + iη
Vˆ + Vˆ 1
Ek − Hˆ0 + iη

Assume the interaction Vˆ is invariant under time reversal, Ωˆ T Vˆ Ωˆ †
T = Vˆ.
1. Show that
(ϕk, Tˆ ϕk) = (ϕ−k, Tˆ ϕ−k )
and hence, in terms of scattering amplitudes, the implication of time-reversal invariance is that
fk(k

that is, the amplitude for the transition k −→ k is the same as that for the transition −k −→ −k,
in which the initial and final states and associated momenta are inverted.
2. Suppose now that Vˆ is also invariant under space inversion,
UˆP Vˆ Uˆ†
P = Vˆ ,
and deduce that the combination of invariance under time reversal and under parity leads to
fk(k

In terms of scattering amplitudes, the implication of time-reversal invariance is that

Since Vˆ is also invariant under space inversion,

P = Tˆ ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press621 16.4 Problems
we deduce (using the unitarity of UˆP) that
(ϕ−k, Tˆ ϕ−k ) = (UˆP ϕ−k, UˆP Tˆ ϕ−k ) = (UˆP ϕ−k, Tˆ UˆP ϕ−k ) = (ϕk, Tˆ ϕk ) .

Rotation Matrices and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem;
Fine and Hyperfine Structure of Energy Levels in
Hydrogen-Like Atoms
In this chapter we discuss the matrix representation of the unitary operator that induces rotations,
introduce a general classification of operators in relation to their transformation properties under
rotations (that is, irreducible tensor operators), and obtain an important result (the Wigner–Eckart
theorem) regarding the matrix elements of irreducible tensor operators between given eigenstates
of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z. Applications of these results to the physically relevant cases of the fine and hyperfine
structure of the hydrogen atom, including the splitting of its energy levels in weak magnetic fields (the
Zeeman effect) and in strong magnetic fields (the Paschen-Back effect), are presented in a number of
problems.
One way to characterize a rotation is to specify the axis of rotation nˆ and the angle ϕ by which
we rotate the system counter-clockwise about this axis. The representation of the associated unitary
operator UˆR(ϕnˆ) = exp(−iϕnˆ ·Jˆ/) in terms of rotation matrices is introduced in Problem 17.1, where
derivations of some properties satisfied by these matrices are also provided. An alternative and useful
way to characterize a rotation, though, is in terms of the three Euler angles. An arbitrary rotation can
be performed as a sequence of three rotations: the first about the zˆ-axis by an angle α, the second
about the yˆ
-axis (that is, the yˆ-axis rotated by α about zˆ) by an angle β, and the third about the axis
zˆ (that is, the zˆ-axis rotated by β about yˆ
) by an angle γ. The angles α, β, and γ are taken to vary
over the ranges [0, 2π], [0, π], and [−π, π], respectively. The unitary operator inducing these three
rotations is given by the product
UˆR(α, β, γ) = e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ , (17.1)
where it should be noted that the β and γ rotations involve the components of Jˆ along the directions
yˆ and zˆ, respectively. It is convenient to express these components in terms of components relative
to the fixed axes xˆ, yˆ, and zˆ. To this end, using the general transformation properties of operators
under rotations, we have
yˆ · Jˆ = UˆR(αzˆ) yˆ · Jˆ Uˆ†
R(αzˆ) = e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ yˆ · Jˆ eiαzˆ·Jˆ/ , (17.2)
yielding (see Problem 3)
e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ = e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ eiαzˆ·Jˆ/ , (17.3)
where the right-hand side involves only components of Jˆ relative to the fixed axes. Similarly, we find
e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ = e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ eiβyˆ·Jˆ/ , (17.4)
and, using the above result,
e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ = e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ eiαzˆ·Jˆ/

where we have used the fact that e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ and e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ commute with each other (since they are
rotations about the same axis), and that eiαzˆ·Jˆ/ e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ = 1ˆ. Collecting results, we arrive at
UˆR(α, β, γ) = e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ eiβyˆ·Jˆ/ eiαzˆ·Jˆ/

and after simplifying terms we obtain
UˆR(α, β, γ) = e−iαzˆ·Jˆ/ e−iβyˆ·Jˆ/ e−iγzˆ·Jˆ/ , (17.7)
which looks like Eq. (17.1) with the order of the operators reversed, but with one crucial difference:
the components of angular momentum are now relative to the fixed axes. This facilitates the
evaluation of the D(j) matrices,
D(j)
m,m (α, β, γ) = ψjm| e−iαJˆz/ e−iβJˆy/ e−iγJˆz/ |ψjm = e−imα ψjm| e−iβJˆy/ |ψjm 

where in the basis of eigenstates |ψjm of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z it should be stressed that Jˆ
z refers to the component
of Jˆ along the fixed zˆ-axis. The problem is reduced to the evaluation of the matrices d(j)
(β). For the
case j = 1/2, this is especially simple since, for Jˆ
y =  σˆ y/2,
e−iβσˆ y/2 = cos(β/2) 1ˆ − i sin(β/2) σˆ y =⇒ d(1/2) =
	
cos(β/2) − sin(β/2)
sin(β/2) cos(β/2)


. (17.9)
The D(j)
(α, β, γ) are unitary matrices of dimensions (2j + 1) × (2j + 1) with determinant equal to 1,
and whose inverses are simply 

(−γ, −β, −α). Additional properties of these
matrices are discussed in Problems 12 and 13.
17.1 Irreducible Tensor Operators and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem
It is useful to classify operators according to the their commutation relations with the angular
momentum operator, the generator of rotations. As we will see, this allows us to deduce which matrix
elements of these operators are non-vanishing and derive useful selection rules. Suppose we have a
complete set of commuting observables consisting of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z and, possibly, additional observables
which we collectively indicate by the symbol Γˆ (for example, in the case of the hydrogen atom a
complete set of commuting observables consists of Lˆ 2, Lˆz, and Hˆ, if we ignore the electron and proton
spins). The common eigenstates are |ψγjm, where γ denotes the eigenvalues corresponding to Γˆ.
We begin by considering scalar operators, which we generically denote as Sˆ (not to be confused
with the spin angular momentum Sˆ). A scalar operator is characterized by the fact that it commutes
with all components of Jˆ,
scalar operator: 
Jˆ
i , Sˆ  = 0 . (17.10)
Examples of scalar operators are the kinetic energy and central potential operators and the spin–
orbit operator, defined as Vˆ(rˆ) Lˆ · Sˆ (note that this latter operator commutes with the total angular
momentum Jˆ but not with the orbital or spin angular momenta separately; it is a scalar in the
combined orbital + spin space). It immediately follows that the matrix elements of Sˆ in the basis
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.018 Published online by Cambridge University Press624 Rotation Matrices and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem; Fine and Hyperfine Structure of Energy Levels in Hydrogen-Like Atoms
|ψγjm vanish unless the left and right states have the same eigenvalues j and m; namely, we obtain
the selection rule
ψγjm| Sˆ |ψγj
m = Sγ, γ δj,j

and similarly for m  m by considering the vanishing commutator of Jˆ
z with Sˆ (the matrix element
is also independent of the azimuthal quantum number, see Problem 9 in Chapter 16).
We next consider vector operators, generically denoted as Vˆ (examples are the position and
momentum operators, the orbital, spin, and total angular momenta, Lˆ × Sˆ, etc.). A vector operator

The definition in Eq. (17.16) can be extended to the general case of tensor operators. Generally, a set
of 2k+1 operators Tˆ(k)
q with q = −k, −k+1, ... , k is said to form an irreducible tensor operator (ITO)
of rank k if its components satisfy the following commutation relations with the angular momentum:

Obviously this definition reproduces Eqs. (17.10) and (17.16) when k = 0 and 1, and so a scalar and
vector operator are ITOs of rank 0 and 1, respectively. The attentive reader will observe that these
relations are reminiscent of those of Jˆ
z and Jˆ
± acting on eigenstates |ψjm of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z.

(the conventional notation with the double vertical lines is meant to emphasize the independence
of q, m, and m
).1 Two consequences of this important result are: (i) the dependence of the matrix
element ψγj
m | Tˆ(k)
q |ψγjm on the azimuthal quantum numbers is made explicit – it is given by the
Clebsch–Gordan coefficient and (ii) the matrix element ψγj
m | Tˆ(k)
q |ψγjm vanishes if the following
two selection rules are not satisfied simultaneously:
|k − j| ≤ j
 ≤ k + j and m = q + m . (17.19)
These selection rules are accounted for by the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. To prove the Wigner–
Eckart theorem, we consider the state obtained by applying the ITO Tˆ(k)
q to the state |ψγjm,
|Ψkq;jm = Tˆ(k)
q |ψγjm . (17.20)
When acting with the angular momentum operators Jˆ


j(j + 1) − m(m ± 1)  |Ψkq;j,m±1 . (17.22)
Thus the action of Jˆ on |Ψkq;jm is the same as if |Ψkq;jm corresponded to a state of two particles, one
with angular momentum kq and the other with angular momentum jm; in other words, acting with
(Jˆ1 +Jˆ2)z,± on the state |Ψkq;jm, viewed as a state of two particles with angular momentum kq and jm
leads to the same states on the right-hand side of the relations derived above. We can therefore add
these two angular momenta to form the total angular momentum and expand |Ψkq;jm in the basis of
eigenstates of this total angular momentum, see Eqs. (13.29), (13.30), to obtain

17.2 Matrix Elements of Scalar and Vector Operators
Application of the Wigner–Eckart theorem to the matrix elements of a scalar operator Sˆ (an ITO
of rank 0) immediately leads, using C0j(0m; jm) = 1, to Eq. (17.11), derived earlier. In the case of a
vector operator Vˆμ (an ITO of rank 1, we have
ψγj
m | Vˆμ |ψγjm = C1j(μm; j

m
)ψγj
 || Vˆ ||ψγj , (17.26)
where the selection rules require
j
 = |j − 1|, j, j + 1 and m = μ + m . (17.27)
A straightforward consequence is that the matrix elements of vector operators between eigenstates
of angular momentum are proportional to each other. Given two vector operators Vˆ and Wˆ , we have
(assuming the RMEs to be both non-vanishing)
ψγj
m | Vˆμ |ψγjm
ψγj
 || Vˆ ||ψγj = C1j(μm; j

m
) = ψγj
m | Wˆ μ |ψγjm
ψγj
 || Wˆ ||ψγj , (17.28)
which can also be written, for the cartesian components of Vˆ and Wˆ ,
ψγj
m | Vˆ
i |ψγjm = ψγj
 || Vˆ ||ψγj
ψγj
 || Wˆ ||ψγj
ψγj
m | Wˆi |ψγjm and ψγj
 || Wˆ ||ψγj  0 .
(17.29)
The relation above has useful implications when Wˆ is the angular momentum itself. Firstly, matrix
elements of Jˆ
i are diagonal in γ and j, namely
ψγj
m | Jˆ
i |ψγjm = 0 if γ  γ and/or j  j
 , (17.30)
the reason being that Γˆ and Jˆ2 both commute with Jˆ, and matrix elements of Jˆ
i between eigenstates
belonging to different eigenvalues of Γˆ and Jˆ2 vanish. However, when γ = γ and j = j
 we have
ψγjm | Vˆ
i |ψγjm = ψγj|| Vˆ ||ψγj
ψγj|| Jˆ||ψγj  αγj
ψγjm | Jˆ
i |ψγjm . (17.31)
We emphasize that this does not mean that in general a vector operator has vanishing matrix elements
when γ  γ and/or j  j
 – in fact, the selection rules for such an operator are those given in Eq.
(17.27). Equation (17.30) only holds for the angular momentum operator. It is not in contradiction
with Eq. (17.29); that equation is only applicable when ψγj
 ||Jˆ||ψγj  0, which is not the case if
γ  γ and/or j  j

. After this cautionary note, consider the scalar operator Jˆ · Vˆ and its expectation

This relation is used in Problem 18 to obtain the splitting of atomic levels in a magnetic field.
17.3 Relativistic Corrections to Hydrogen-Like-Atom Hamiltonian
In this section, we consider the effects of relativistic corrections on the energy spectrum of hydrogen￾like atoms. These corrections emerge naturally in a non-relativistic expansion of the Dirac equation,
which describes the relativistic behavior of a charged spin-1/2 particle in an external electromagnetic
field. Here, we will provide a derivation that is not based on the Dirac equation but rather on a
physical interpretation of these corrections. Evaluation of their effect on the energy levels is carried
out using perturbation theory in a number of problems.
A non-relativistic expansion of the Dirac equation for an electron in the Coulomb field of a nucleus
of charge Ze fixed at the origin leads to the following Hamiltonian (we will simplify the notation here
and not include a caret on operators)

where VC(r) is the Coulomb potential, L and S are the orbital and spin angular momentum operators
of the electron, ge ≈ 2 is its gyromagnetic factor, and c is the speed of light. The terms labeled VK,
VSO, VDF represent relativistic corrections, known respectively as the kinetic energy, spin–orbit, and
Darwin–Foldy terms. We now proceed to provide a physical interpretation of these terms.
Kinetic energy term VK: This term has a straightforward interpretation. The relativistic expression for
the electron kinetic energy operator is given by K= c

p2 + m2
e c2 − mec2, where mec2 is the electron
rest-mass energy. In the limit x = p/(mec)  1, we expand K as follows:

estimate the order of magnitude of the correction VK in hydrogen by making the approximation

Spin-orbit term VSO: This term has an interesting physical origin and comes about because of two
distinct relativistic effects. We analyze them in turn. We introduce two frames, the external fixed
frame (the unprimed frame O) and the rest frame of the electron (the primed frame O
). In the fixed
frame the electron is subject only to the electric field generated by the nucleus, E = Ze r/r3. However,
in its rest frame the electron feels a magnetic field, which, to leading order in v/c, is given by3
B ≈ −v
c
× E , (17.40)
where v is the electron velocity in the fixed frame (note that to terms linear in v/c the electric field
in this frame is given by E ≈ E). This magnetic field couples to the spin magnetic moment of the
electron and leads to an interaction energy given by
U = −μs · B , (17.41)

Indeed, O is rotating relative to O. The origin of this rotation is due to the fact that the motion

the Thomas precession (see J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd edition, Wiley). A direct

The previous derivation was based on classical physics. In quantum mechanics, r, L, and S are
interpreted as vector operators. Because of the spherical symmetry of the Coulomb potential, the
orbital angular momentum commutes with dVC(r)/dr, and so the ordering of the various terms in
VSO is irrelevant. We can roughly estimate the order of magnitude of the spin–orbit correction in
hydrogen by setting 1/r3 ≈ 1/a3
0 (a0 is the Bohr radius) and |L · S| ≈ 2, so that
|VSO| ≈ e2

(/mec)2

≈ 7.2 × 10−4 eV , (17.51)
where e2/(2a0) ≈ 13.6 eV (the binding energy of the hydrogen atom).
Darwin–Foldy term VDF: As a consequence of the expansion of the Dirac equation in powers of v/c,
the interaction of the electron with the Coulomb potential of the nucleus, rather than being local,
turns out to be non-local. It can be modeled as
VC(r) =

dλ f (λ) VC(|r + λ|) , f (λ) = f (λ)
' 
dλ f (λ) , (17.52)
where the normalized function f (λ) vanishes when λ is of the order of, or larger than, the Compton
wavelength of the electron, /(mec). It is as if the electron felt a Coulomb interaction averaged over
a sphere of radius /(mec) centered at r rather than just VC(r). By expanding VC(|r + λ|) in a Taylor
series in powers of λi, we obtain

and the terms quadratic in λi λj are proportional to δi,j λ2/3 when integrated over λ because of the
spherical symmetry of f (λ); in the last line we have rescaled the integration variable λ = (/mec) x.
The first term in VC(r) is the leading-order Coulomb potential included in H0 and the second term
with  dx x2 f (x) = 3/4 is the required VDF correction.
Note that use of the Poisson equation of electrostatics – recall that generally VC(r) = −e U(r) and
the scalar potential U(r) is such that ∇2U(r) = −4πρN(r) – allows us to write
∇2
VC(r) = 4πeρN(r) , (17.55)
where ρN(r) is the nuclear charge distribution. In hydrogen and for a point-like proton, in which case
∇2VC(r) = 4πe2 δ(r), we can easily estimate the magnitude of VDF:

Problem 1 Some Properties of Rotation Matrices
Let |ψjm be the basis consisting of the common eigenstates of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z. Consider the matrix
elements
ψjm| UˆR(ϕnˆ) |ψj
m = ψjm| e−iϕnˆ ·Jˆ/ |ψj
m = δj,j
 D(j)
m,m (ϕnˆ) .
The (2j+1)×(2j+1) matrices D(j)
(ϕnˆ) are known as rotation matrices. Explain why they are diagonal
in j; show that [D(j)
(ϕnˆ)]
† is equal to D(j)
(−ϕnˆ) (the matrix representing the inverse rotation) and
that D(j)
(ϕnˆ) is therefore unitary.
Next, consider the basis |ψlm of eigenstates of Lˆ 2 and Lˆz, and the spherical harmonics
Ylm(rˆ) = φr |ψlm, where here rˆ denotes the unit vector specified by the angle θ and φ (rˆ
is not the position operator). Show that under a rotation by ϕ about the zˆ-axis we have
Y
lm(rˆ) = φr |ψ
lm = e−imϕ Ylm(r), and verify explicitly that Y
lm(rˆ) = Ylm(R−1rˆ).
Solution
Since UˆR(ϕnˆ) and Jˆ2 commute with each other, the matrix representation of UˆR(ϕnˆ) in the basis
|ψjm is diagonal in j. As a consequence, a state |ψjm under a rotation will transform into a linear
combination of states having the same j but different m-values,
UˆR(ϕnˆ) |ψjm =

and the matrix elements are generally complex numbers. The matrix D(j) has the property

D(j)† (ϕnˆ)

m,m =D(j)∗
m,m(ϕnˆ)=ψjm | e−iϕnˆ ·Jˆ/ |ψjm
∗ =ψjm| eiϕnˆ ·Jˆ/ |ψjm=D(j)
m,m (−ϕnˆ) ,
and D(j)† is the matrix representing the inverse rotation; namely, the matrix D(j) is unitary,

D(j)† (ϕnˆ) D(j)
(ϕnˆ)

m,m = δm,m .
Under a rotation the spherical harmonics transform as follows:
Y
lm(rˆ) = φr |ψ
lm = φr |UR(ϕnˆ)|ψlm =

m
φr |ψlmD(l)
m,m(ϕnˆ)
=

m
Ylm (rˆ) D(l)
m,m(ϕnˆ) = Ylm(R−1
rˆ) ,
where in the last step we used the transformation law of wave functions under rotations that we
established earlier. The matrix representing a rotation about zˆ is especially simple, since in this case
D(j)
(ϕzˆ) is diagonal with respect to m and is given by
D(j)
m,m (ϕzˆ) = ψjm| e−iϕJˆ
z/ |ψjm = e−imϕ δm,m =⇒ Y
lm(rˆ) = e−imϕ Ylm(rˆ) = Ylm(R−1
rˆ) .

= (cos ϕ ∓ i sin ϕ) rˆx ± i(cos ϕ ∓ i sin ϕ) rˆy = e∓iϕ rˆ± ,
and ˆr0 is left unchanged. Recalling that (for fixed l) the Ylm(rˆ) are homogenous polynomials of
order l in ˆr± and ˆr0 and using results obtained in Problem 5 of Chapter 9, we see that Ylm(R−1rˆ) =
e−imϕ Ylm(rˆ); as an example, for l = 1 we have Y1,±1 (rˆ) ∝ rˆ± and Y10 (rˆ) ∝ rˆ0, and so Y1,±1 (R−1rˆ) ∝
e∓iϕ rˆ± ∝ e∓iϕ Y1,±1 (rˆ) and Y10 (R−1rˆ) ∝ rˆ0 ∝ Y10 (rˆ).
Problem 2 Physical Interpretation of the Matrix Elements D
(j)
m,m(α, β, γ)
Provide a physical interpretation of the matrix elements of the rotation matrix.
Solution
Consider the state |ψ
jm, an eigenstate of Jˆ
z corresponding to the eigenvalue m, where
|ψ
jm = UˆR(α, β, γ)|ψjm , Jˆ
z = UˆR(α, β, γ) Jˆ
z Uˆ†
R(α, β, γ) .
Then, by expanding |ψ
jm in the basis of eigenstates |ψjm of Jˆ2 and Jˆ
z, we see that
|ψ
jm =

j
m=−j
|ψjm D(j)
m,m(α, β, γ) ,
and the probability that the state |ψ
jm has angular momentum with projection m
 relative to the
fixed zˆ-axis is given by
|ψjm |ψ
jm|2 = |D(j)
m,m(α, β, γ)|
2 .
In other words, D(j)
m,m(α, β, γ) represents the probability amplitude that a state with polarization
m along the axis whose direction is specified by the Euler angles α, β, γ is found in a state with
polarization m
 along the fixed zˆ-axis.
Problem 3 Explicit Calculation of the Transform of an Angular
Momentum Component under Rotation
Obtain by explicit calculation Jˆ

y under a rotation by α about the zˆ-axis. Show

Problem 4 Construction of the Rotation Matrix D(1)(α, β, γ)

Problem 6 Combining Two ITOs
Two irreducible tensor operators of ranks k1 and k2 can be combined in the following way:
Tˆ(k1)
q1 Tˆ(k2)
q2 =
k
1+k2
k=|k1−k2 |
Ck1k2 (q1q2; kq) Tˆ(k)
q ,
where Ck1k2 (q1q2; kq) are Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. Without doing any detailed calculations,
justify the expression above. Consider two vector operators Aˆ and Bˆ , and combine them into ITOs
of ranks 0, 1, and 2. To what do the ITOs of rank 0 and 1 correspond?

Solution
The formula is made plausible by noting that the state
|Ψk1q1;k2q2;jm = Tˆ(k1)
q1 Tˆ(k2)
q2 |ψγjm
behaves under the action of the angular momentum Jˆ as if it were a state of three particles with
angular momenta k1q1, k2q2, and jm (this assertion can be verified following the approach used in
proving the Wigner–Eckart theorem in Section 17.1). Thus we can combine the first two angular
momenta (k1q1 and k2q2) in the usual way to obtain the relation above. The formula above can be
“inverted” in the sense that
Tˆ(k)
q =

q1,q2
Ck1k2 (q1q2; kq) Tˆ(k1)
q1 Tˆ(k2)
q2 .
In the case of two vector operators Aˆ and Bˆ , we first construct the relative ITOs of rank 1, consisting
of the spherical components Aˆ

Problem 10 Transformation Law under Rotations of ITOs of Rank 1 (Vector Operators)

q with the
components of the angular momentum operator.

Problem 11 The Rotation Matrices as Polynomials of Order
2j in sin(β/2)and cos(β/2)
Show that

Hint: For the second part, insert the completeness of the angular momentum eigenstates, note
that twice the azimuthal quantum number is always an integer regardless of whether j is integer or
half-integer, and use the binomial expansion.

by ei(π/2)Jx (note the sign of the exponent) and hence
Jy = ei(π/2)Jx/ Jz e−i(π/2)Jx/ .

Problem 12 Some Properties of the Rotation Matrices
This problem deals with the derivation of properties satisfied by the d(j) matrices.
1. Knowing that d(j)
(β) is an orthogonal matrix, show that
d(j)
m,m(−β) = d(j)
m,m (β) .
2. Use the transformation properties of vector operators under rotations to show that
e−iπJy/ Jx eiπJy/ = −Jx , e−iπJy/ Jz eiπJy/ = −Jz , e−iπJy/ J± eiπJy/ = −J∓ .
Using these results, show that
|ψ
jm = e−iπJy/ |ψj,m = eiφj,m |ψj,−m ,
namely, it is an eigenstate of J2 and Jz with eigenvalues j(j + 1)2 and −m (here, φj,m is a real
phase factor).

2mcm cm−1 ··· c−m+1
e−iπJy/ (J−)

with known cm. Use these two relations to show that

Part 1
Since the d(j) matrix is orthogonal, we have

leads to the transformation laws given in the text of the problem. We then find that
Jz e−iπJy/ |ψj,m = −e−iπJy/ Jz |ψj,m = −m e−iπJy/ |ψj,m ,
where in the second step we have used the fact that Jz anticommutes with e−iπJy/; we also have
J2 e−iπJy/ |ψj,m = e−iπJy/ J2 |ψj,m = j(j + 1)2 e−iπJy/ |ψj,m .
We conclude that
e−iπJy/ |ψj,m = eiφj,m |ψj,−m ,
where the phase factor can depend on j and m; that is, the state e−iπJy/ |ψj,m is, up to a phase factor,
equal to the eigenstate |ψj,−m of Jz.
Part 3
In order to determine φj,m, we note that by applying twice a rotation by π about yˆ, we have (recalling
that for half-integer angular momentum a rotation by 2π is equal to minus the identity operator)

and hence
φj,m + φj,−m = 2πj .
Next, we write the state |ψj,−m as
|ψj,−m = 1
2mcm cm−1 ··· c−m+1

2m |ψj,m ,
where we define

2 |ψj,−m = 2
c−m+1 c−m+2 |ψj,−m+2 ,
and so on, and the coefficients cancel out. We conclude that
φj,m + φj,−m = 2πj and φj,−m = φj,m + 2πm =⇒ φj,m = π(j − m) ,
where it should be noted that j − m is always an integer (regardless of whether j is integer or half￾integer). We finally arrive at
e−iπJy/ |ψj,m = (−1)
j−m |ψj,−m ,
up to a further overall phase factor, which can depend only on j.

(if j is half integer then m and m are also half integers, and hence
2m and 2m are always odd; if j is integer, then m and m are also integers, and hence 2m and 2m are

Since pμ is an irreducible tensor operator of rank 1, we find
Pμm = C11 (μ, m; 0, 0) φ1s|| p ||φ2p ,

and the matrix elements Pμm vanish unless μ + m = 0. In order to obtain the reduced matrix element,

Problem 15 Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom
As we saw in Section 17.3, the relativistic terms in the Hamiltonian are expected to produce
corrections that are suppressed by α2 (where α is the fine-structure constant) relative to the
unperturbed energy levels in hydrogen-like atoms. In this problem, we will evaluate their effect
on the spectrum of these systems in first-order perturbation theory and determine their so-called
fine structure. Note that, since we must now include the spin of the electron, a complete set of
commuting observables consists of H0, L2, Lz, S2, and Sz with common eigenstates |φnlm,ms,
where |φnlm,ms = |φnlm⊗|ms and the principal quantum number is n = 1, 2, ... , ∞, the orbital
angular momentum number is l = 0, 1, ... , n − 1, the orbital angular momentum projection is

m = −l, −l+1, ... , +l, and the spin projection is ms = ±1/2. The spin quantum number s = 1/2 is fixed,
of course. The eigenvalues of H0 – referring to Eq. (17.34) – are known,
H0 |φnlm,ms = n |φnlm,ms , n = − (Zα)2
2n2 mec2 , gn = 2n2 ,
where, however, the degeneracy gn of a generic level n is now doubled because of the two possible
values for the spin azimuthal quantum number ms. As a consequence, for example, the ground state is
two-fold degenerate rather than being non-degenerate as when the electronic spin degrees of freedom
are not considered.
1. Calculate the first-order correction to the unperturbed energies n induced by the Darwin–Foldy
term (assume the nuclear charge distribution to be point-like; in other words, ignore nuclear finite￾size effects). Recall that the (squared) value of the wave function at the origin is given by

H0, L2, S2, J2, and Jz (a complete set of commuting observables); the transformation from the
basis |φnlm⊗|ms of eigenstates of L2, Lz and of S2, Sz to the new basis |φnl,jmj

Solution
Part 1
Since the finite size of the nuclear charge distribution is neglected, that is, VC(r) = −Ze2/r, the
Darwin–Foldy term is simply given by
VDF = 2
8m2
e c2 ∇2
VC(r) = 2
8m2
e c2 4πZe2δ(r) ,
where we have used ∇2 (1/r) =−4πδ(r). This term has spherical symmetry in orbital and spin space,
since it commutes with L and S separately. Thus VDF is a scalar operators (an ITO of rank 0), and
therefore the Wigner–Eckart theorem ensures that, in the degenerate subspace of dimension gn, the
matrix VDF is in fact diagonal, that is,
φnlm,m
s |VDF|φnlm,ms = δl,l
 δm,m δms,m
s φnlVDFφnl .
Since the reduced matrix element (RME) is independent of m and ms, we can compute it by simply
evaluating the expectation value for some m and ms, to find
φnlVDFφnl = φnlm,ms |VDF|φnlm,ms = φnlm|VDF|φnlm ms|ms  unity
,
where in the last step we have used the fact that VDF does not depend on the spin operator. The
presence of the δ-function makes the evaluation of this RME straightforward,
φnlVDFφnl =

dr VDF(r) |φnlm(r)|
2 = 4πZe2 2
8m2
e c2 |φnlm(0)|
2 = (Zα)4
2n3 mec2δl,0 δm,0 ,
and the correction is repulsive (positive) and only affects s-states.
Part 2
The term VK is also a scalar in the orbital and spin spaces separately, and hence
φnlm,m
s |VK|φnlm,ms = δl,l
 δm,m δms,m
s φnlVKφnl =⇒ φnl||VK||φnl = φnlm|VK|φnlm .
Inserting the expression for VK given in the text of the problem leads to

The correction due to VK is attractive (negative) for any level nl.
Part 3
Making use of the identity J2 =L2 + S2 + 2L · S allows one to write
VSO = 1
2 ξ(r)

J2 − L2 − S2

,
which makes it plain that VSO commutes with J. In the basis |φnl,jmj
 the allowed values of j are
j = 1/2 for l = 0 , j = l − 1/2 , l + 1/2 for l ≥ 1 ,
with mj = −j, −j + 1, ... , +j. The degenerate subspace of energy n is spanned by the states |φnl,jmj

with l = 0, ... , n − 1, j =|l − 1/2| and l + 1/2, and mj = −j, −j + 1, ... , j. For example, the subspace
with n = 1 has j = 1/2 and dimension 2; the subspace with n = 2 has j = 1/2 twice and j = 3/2 once, and
hence has dimension 8; the subspace with n = 3 has j = 1/2 twice, j = 3/2 twice, and j = 5/2 once, and
hence has dimension 18; and so on. The dimension of the degenerate subspace is gn = 2n2 (the same
as before, of course), as can be easily verified by noting that
gn =

l+2(n−1) = 2+2n(n−1) +2n−2 = 2n2 .
The Wigner–Eckart theorem ensures that, in the degenerate subspace, the matrix VSO is diagonal in j

Note that the prefactor is zero for l = 0 (and j = 1/2). By inserting the expansion for the states into the

s, and
the fact the matrix element of ξ(r), which commutes with L, vanishes for m  m
; that is, ξ(r) is an
ITO of rank 0 in orbital space. Further, by applying the Wigner–Eckart theorem to the matrix element
φnlm|ξ(r)|φnlm, we see that this matrix element is independent of m, and can therefore be pulled
out of the summation symbol. We arrive at

Solution
We need to calculate the matrix VSO in the degenerate subspace of level n (here, n = 1 or 2), where
(VSO)nα,nα = φnlm,m
s |ξ(r) L · S|φnlm,ms ,
l = 0, 1, ... , n − 1, m = −l, ... , l, and ms = ±1/2, and similarly for the primed quantities (we denote
these quantum numbers collectively by α and α
, respectively). It is convenient to express L · S in
terms of spherical components as
L · S =

μ=±1,0
(−1)
μ Lμ S−μ ,
where
L±1 = ∓
Lx ± i Ly
√
2 = ∓
1
√
2
L± , L0 = Lz ,
and similarly for Sμ; note that the spherical components L±1 and S±1 are proportional to the
corresponding raising and lowering operators L± and S±. Since L and S act in different spaces,
we have
(VSO)nα,nα =

μ=±1,0
(−1)
μ φnlm |ξ(r) Lμ|φnlm 1/2, m
s|S−μ|1/2, ms


m
) φnl ||ξ(r) L||φnlC1,1/2 (−μ, ms; 1/2, m
s) 1/2||S||1/2 ,
where we have made use of the Wigner–Eckart theorem in orbital space and spin space separately. In
the first line, we see that the states with l = l
 = 0 and those with either l = 0 or l
 = 0 cannot contribute,
since, for any μ,
Lμ |φn00 = 0 , φn00 |Lμ = 0 ,
because of the spherical symmetry of s-states. In the second line, the second Clebsch–Gordan
coefficient requires μ = ms − m
s, which yields
(VSO)nα,nα = (−)
ms−m
s C1,l(ms−m

, m
) C1,1/2 (m
s−ms, ms; 1/2, m
s) φnl ||ξ(r) L||φnl 1/2||S||1/2 .
The first Clebsch–Gordan coefficient requires
ms − m
s + m = m =⇒ m + ms = m + m
s .
We recall that the ground-state energy is two-fold degenerate with eigenstates |φ100,ms, where
ms = ± 1/2. In this subspace, the 2×2 matrix representing VSO is the null matrix, owing to the selection
rule on l. Similarly, the first excited state is eight-fold degenerate, with eigenstates |φ200,ms and
|φ21m,ms, and the 8 × 8 matrix representing VSO is given by
VSO =

Problem 17 Effects of Relativistic Corrections on 1s, 2s, and
2p Levels of the Hydrogen Atom
Calculate explicitly the kinetic energy (VK), spin-orbit (VSO), and Darwin–Foldy (VDF) relativistic
corrections for the 1s, 2s, and 2p levels of hydrogen-like atoms in the basis |φnl,jmj
 of eigenstates of
H0, L2, J2, and Jz (see Problem 15). Briefly comment on the results.
Solution
In Problem 15 the corrections due to VK and VDF were calculated using the basis |φnlm,ms of
eigenstates of H0, L2, Lz, and Sz. However, they can also be calculated straightforwardly in the basis
|φnl,jmj
 that diagonalizes VSO, since

and similarly for VDF. Hence, the kinetic energy and Darwin–Foldy corrections are independent of j
and also of mj since they commute with J (in addition to commuting with L). We finally arrive at

where the spin-orbit term vanishes for s-states, and hence l ≥ 1. The overall correction is obtained
by summing the individual corrections. We find (the notation is nlj):

The corrections are all negative and the energy levels are lowered by these relativistic corrections.
Each level has degeneracy 2j + 1 from spherical symmetry. More interesting is the fact that 2s1/2 and
2p1/2 remain degenerate to order (Zα)4. It turns out that they stay so to all orders of perturbation
theory, in the sense that the exact solution of the Dirac equation gives the same energy for these two
levels.
The degeneracy of the 2s1/2 and 2p1/2 levels is lifted by the interaction of the atom with the
fluctuating (and quantized) electromagnetic field. As a consequence of this interaction, the 2s1/2
level is raised relative to the 2p1/2 level by 1060 MHz in frequency units (the famous Lamb shift),
corresponding to an energy of 4.4 × 10−6 eV, about 10 times smaller than the fine-structure splitting
of 4.5 × 10−5 eV between the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 levels.
Problem 18 Hydrogen Atom in a Magnetic Field (Zeeman
and Paschen–Back Effects)
In this problem we consider the effect of a uniform magnetic field on the levels of hydrogen-like
atoms. The Hamiltonian, including relativistic corrections from the kinetic energy, spin–orbit, and
Darwin–Foldy terms (collectively indicated as VRC below), reads

where the two terms denoted as VMM represent the interaction of the orbital and spin magnetic
moments of the electron with the magnetic field, and the last term, quadratic in the magnetic field, is
known as the diamagnetic term.
1. Provide a rough estimate of the terms VMM and VDM as functions of the magnetic field, expressed
in teslas (1 tesla is 104 gauss). Show that, even for relatively strong fields, the magnitude of the
VDM term is much smaller than that of the VMM term. Hereafter, we ignore the diamagnetic term.

2. Consider the regime of a weak magnetic field (the Zeeman effect), in which |VMM||VRC|. Take
the unperturbed Hamiltonian to be H
0, with (approximate) eigenvalues and eigenstates given by
H
0 |φnl,jmj
 = Enlj |φnl,jmj
 , Enlj = n + E(1)
nlj ,
where E(1)
nlj represent the corrections induced by VRC, which were determined in Problem 15.
Making use of Eq. (17.33), obtain the Zeeman splittings of the energy levels Enlj to first order
in VMM. Show that these splittings are independent of mj and are given by gljμ0B, where
μ0 = e/(2mec) and glj is a factor depending on l and j, to be determined. We set ge ≈ 2 here
and in part 3.
3. Now, consider the regime of a strong magnetic field (the Paschen–Back effect), in which |VRC| 
|VMM|. Take the unperturbed Hamiltonian to be H0 with (exact) eigenvalues and eigenstates
given by
H0 |φnlm,ms = n |φnlm,ms ,
with degeneracy gn = 2n2. Obtain the splitting of these levels due to VMM. Is the degeneracy
completely resolved?
Solution
Part 1
The order of magnitude of the VMM corrections is
|VMM| ≈ μ0B ≈ B(T) × 5.8 × 10−5 eV ,
where μ0 = e/(2mec) and B(T) is the magnetic field strength expressed in teslas (T). The order of
magnitude of the VDM term, proportional to B2, is
|VDM| ≈ e2
12mec2
 a0
Z

B2 ≈ B2 (T)
4.1
Z2 × 10−11 eV ,
where we have approximated r2
⊥ as (2/3)(a0/Z)2 and a0/Z is the “Bohr radius” of hydrogen-like
atoms. We see that VDM is typically much smaller than VMM and VRC.
Part 2
When the magnetic field is weak, VMM can be viewed as a perturbation relative to H
0. In order
to evaluate its first-order correction, we need to diagonalize the matrix representing VMM in the
degenerate subspace of nlj,

,mj = μ0B
 φnl,jm
j
| Lz + geSz |φnl,jmj
 ,
where we have taken the magnetic field to be along the zˆ-axis. The evaluation of these matrix
elements is facilitated by using the relation in Eq. (17.33). In our case, we have V = L + geS and, by
considering the z-component, we find
φnl,jm
j
| Lz + geSz |φnl,jmj
 = φnl,jmj | J · (L + geS) |φnl,jmj

,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.018 Published online by Cambridge University Press661 17.4 Problems
and so the matrix V MM is diagonal. Further, we have
J · (L + geS) = (L + S) · (L + geS) = L2+ geS2 +(ge + 1)L · S = L2+ geS2+ ge + 1
2 (J2 − L2 − S2)
= ge + 1
2 J2 − ge − 1

L2 + ge − 1

and the expectation value is simply given by (setting ge ≈ 2)
φnl,jmj | J · (L + 2S) |φnl,jmj
 = 2
2 [3j(j + 1) − l(l + 1) + 3/4] .
We finally arrive at

V MM

mj δmj,m
j = gljmjμ0B δmj,m
j ,
where we have defined the so-called Lande factor, ´
glj = 1
2
3j(j + 1) − l(l + 1) + 3/4
j(j + 1) = 1 + j(j + 1) − l(l + 1) + 3/4
2j(j + 1) .
Thus we see that the magnetic field has completely removed the degeneracy in mj. The splitting
between Zeeman levels is given by gljμ0B, and is independent of mj.
Part 3
In this regime VMM can be considered as a small perturbation relative to H0, rather than to H
0 as
in the treatment of the Zeeman effect above. With B along the zˆ-axis, the perturbation commutes
with L2, Lz and Sz; indeed, the states |φnlm,ms are exact eigenstates of H0 + VMM, that is, (H0 +
VMM)|φnlm,ms = En,mms |φnlm,ms, where
En,mms = n + μ0B(m + 2ms) ,
with l = 0, 1, ... , n − 1 (and again ge ≈ 2). We see, for example, that the degeneracy of the ground￾state level is completely removed, E1,m=0,ms=±1/2 = 1±μ0B, while that of the first-excited-state level is
only partially removed since E2,m=0,ms=±1/2 = 2±μ0B with l = 0 or 1, and E21,m±1,ms=∓1/2 = 2; however,
the eigenenergies E2,m=±1,ms=±1/2 = 2 ± 2μ0B are non-degenerate.
Problem 19 Hyperfine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom
The proton, and generally any nucleus with a non-vanishing total angular momentum, has a magnetic
moment and induces a magnetic field that interacts with the electron’s orbital and spin degrees of
freedom. This interaction leads to the so-called hyperfine structure of the atom. The nuclear magnetic
moment is denoted by μN, and is written as
μN = gN
e
2mpc
SN
 ,
where mp is the proton mass and SN and gN are the nuclear spin (total angular momentum)
and g-factor, respectively; in particular, for a proton the spin is 1/2 and gp = 2 × (2.792847 ··· ).
The combination e/(2mpc) is known as the nuclear magneton, as opposed to the Bohr (atomic)
magneton e/(2mec); the magnetic moments of nucleons and nuclei are expressed in units of nuclear
magnetons. Because of the proton’s large mass, the associated magnetic moment is much smaller
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.018 Published online by Cambridge University Press662 Rotation Matrices and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem; Fine and Hyperfine Structure of Energy Levels in Hydrogen-Like Atoms
than for an electron. For this reason hyperfine-structure effects are expected to be much smaller than
fine-structure effects.
The current distribution responsible for producing μN in the nucleus is confined to a volume whose
radius is of the order of the nuclear charge’s radius, which is much smaller than the atomic radius.
A confined current distribution gives rise to a vector potential
AN(r) = μN × r
r3 ,
and the resulting magnetic field can be obtained by evaluating the curl of A(r). It reads
BN(r) = 3rˆ (μN · rˆ) − μN
r3 +
8π
3 μN δ(r) ,
where rˆ is the unit vector (rˆ = r/r). Due to the presence of these terms the Hamiltonian of the electron
(charge −e), including relativistic corrections but in the absence of external magnetic fields, is now
given by

,
where L is the electron’s orbital angular momentum.
Treat VHF as a small perturbation relative to H
0 and evaluate its effect on the ground-state
level of a hydrogen atom to first order. Note that, since VHF couples the electron’s orbital angular
momentum and spin to the proton’s spin, we must account explicitly for the proton’s spin degrees
of freedom. Therefore, the states in the combined electron orbital + spin and proton spin spaces are
written as |φnl,jmj,mp  = |φnl,jmj
⊗|mp, where |mp are the states corresponding to the two possible
spin projections for the proton, mp = ±1/2; they are simultaneous (approximate) eigenstates of the
commuting observables H
0, L2, S2, J2, and Jz, which act only on the electron degrees of freedom,
and of S2
p and Sp,z, which only act on the proton spin degrees of freedom; for example, we have
H
0 |φnl,jmj,mp  ≈ Enlj|φnl,jmj,mp . The eigenvalues of H
0 are Enlj and their degeneracy is now doubled,
since the Enlj are the same regardless of which spin state the proton is in. In particular, the ground￾state level E1s1/2 ,
E1s1/2 = 1s − α4

When the hyperfine splitting between the f = 0 and f = 1 states is compared with the shift of the
ground-state energy induced by relativistic corrections, we see that it is suppressed by a factor
(32/3)gp (me/mp) ≈ 3.2 × 10−2. The radiative transition between these hyperfine states gives rise
to the famous 21-cm line in the radio spectrum of hydrogen.
Problem 20 The Tensor Term in the Hyperfine Interaction
Consider, for the hydrogen atom, the following term – known as the tensor coupling – in the hyperfine
interaction;

and Se and Sp are the spins of the electron and proton, respectively, and ge and gp are the
corresponding gyromagnetic factors.

2. Define the total angular momentum J =L+F. Show that Tep (rˆ) is a scalar with respect to rotations

3. It turns out that Tep (rˆ) can be written in terms of a rank-2 irreducible tensor operator (ITO),
constructed from the rank-1 ITO ˆrμ, and a rank-2 ITO constructed from the rank-1 ITO Fμ (see

Recall that S = (/2) σ and that the electron and proton spin operators (and hence their associated
Pauli matrices) commute with each other, and so we find

where we have used the Pauli identity
(σe · rˆ)(σe · rˆ) = rˆ · rˆ + iσe · (rˆ × rˆ) = rˆ · rˆ = 1 , σe · σe = 3 ,
(a unit matrix is understood here) and similarly for σp.

since any component of F commutes with any component of r, and also r × F = −F × r. Thus, Tep (rˆ)
and hence the tensor interaction are scalar operators in the combined orbital space and spin space
(that is, the electron and proton spin space).
Part 3
Given two irreducible tensor operators (ITOs) of rank k1 and k2, we can combine them to form
irreducible tensor operators of rank k = |k1 − k2 |, ... , k1 + k2, according to

In the case of two generic ITOs of rank 1 (that is, two vector operators), Aμ and Bμ, after inserting
the relevant Clebsch–Gordan coefficients this formula gives the following expressions for the rank-2
tensor operators:

Since Tep (rˆ) is also a scalar operator, it must be proportional to S(0)

Tep (rˆ) = c S(0) ,
and the proportionality constant can be determined by considering, for example, the case in which
rˆ = zˆ, implying θ = 0. In such a case, we find that the only non-vanishing component of R(2)

Problem 21 ITOs and Time-Reversal Invariance
Let Aˆ be a linear hermitian operator that is either even or odd under time reversal, Ωˆ T Aˆ Ωˆ †
T = ± Aˆ;
that is, Aˆ commutes or anticommutes with Ωˆ T .
1. Consider the expectation value of Aˆ on the state |ψj,m, an eigenstate of the total angular
momentum transforming under Ωˆ T according to Ωˆ T |ψjm = i
2m|ψj,−m. What can you conclude
about this expectation value?
2. Next, consider the irreducible tensor operator (ITO) Tˆ(k)
0 , that is, the q = 0 component, and assume
that it is hermitian and either even or odd under time reversal. Show that
(ψj,m , Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,m) = ± (−1)
k (ψj,m, Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,m) ,
which implies the selection rule that k must be even or odd for an even or odd (under time reversal)
Tˆ(k)
0 , otherwise the matrix element vanishes. Explain why the above selection rule remains valid
for any of the q components of Tˆ(k)
q . How do these components transform under time reversal?
3. Use the results obtained in part 2 to show that the expectation value of rˆ on the hydrogen atom
spinor state (in spectroscopic notation) cns |ψns;1/2,m + cnp |ψnp;1/2,m, having j = 1/2, azimuthal
quantum number m, and real cns and cnp, vanishes.
Solution
Part 1
Time-reversal symmetry implies
(ψj,m , Aˆ ψj,m) = (Ωˆ T ψj,m , Ωˆ T Aˆ ψj,m)
∗ = (Ωˆ T ψj,m , Ωˆ T Aˆ Ωˆ †
T Ωˆ T ψj,m)
∗
= (i
2mψj,−m , ± i
2mAˆ ψj,−m)
∗ = ± (ψj,−m , Aˆ ψj,−m) ,
where we have used the fact that Aˆ is linear and hermitian along with the transformation properties
of angular momentum eigenstates.
Part 2
Using the result of part 1, we have
(ψj,m , Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,m) = ± (ψj,−m , Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,−m) .
However, the state ψj,−m can be obtained (possibly up to a phase factor) by executing a rotation by π
about the y-axis, namely |ψj,−m = UˆR(0, π, 0) |ψj,m, and hence
(ψj,−m , Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,−m) = (UˆRψj,m, Tˆ(k)
0 UˆRψj,m) = (ψj,m, Uˆ†
R Tˆ(k)
0 UˆRψj,m) .
We can now use the transformation properties under rotation of ITOs to obtain
Uˆ†
R(0, π, 0) Tˆ(k)
0 UˆR(0, π, 0) = UˆR(0, −π, 0) Tˆ(k)
0 Uˆ†
R(0, −π, 0) =

k
q=−k
Tˆ(k)
q Dq,0 (0, −π, 0) .
When the expansion above is inserted into (ψj,m, Uˆ†
R Tˆ(k)
0 UˆRψj,m), because of the selection rule on
the azimuthal quantum numbers (q + m = m =⇒ q = 0) from the Wigner–Eckart theorem, only
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.018 Published online by Cambridge University Press668 Rotation Matrices and the Wigner–Eckart Theorem; Fine and Hyperfine Structure of Energy Levels in Hydrogen-Like Atoms
the term with q = 0 contributes to the matrix element; using D(k)
0,0 (0, −π, 0) = Pk (cos π) = (−1)k then
leads to
(ψj,−m , Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,−m) = D(k)
0,0 (0, −π, 0) (ψj,m, Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,m) = (−1)
k (ψj,m, Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,m) ,
and hence to the relation provided in the text of the problem. This relation must hold for any
component of the ITO, since the Wigner–Eckart theorem gives
(ψj,m , Tˆ(k)
q ψj,m) = Ckj(qm; jm
) ψj||Tˆ(k)
||ψj = Ckj(qm; jm
)
Ckj(0m; jm) (ψj,m , Tˆ(k)
0 ψj,m) ,
and the order k of the ITO is in the range 0 ≤ k ≤ 2j; otherwise, (ψj,m , T(k)
q ψj,m) would vanish.
Finally, note that since Tˆ(k)
0 is even or odd under time reversal, this implies that

components q.
Part 3
The z-component of the position operator is an ITO of rank k = 1. Since ˆz is even under time reversal,
it follows that its expectation value, and hence that of rˆ, vanishes, namely ψjm| rˆ |ψjm = 0. Of course,
if |ψjm is a parity eigenstate, this result also follows from symmetry under space inversion. However,
it remains valid even when |ψjm is not a parity eigenstate, as is the case under consideration here.
Note that since cns and cnp are real, this ensures that under time reversal the liner combination with
j, m transforms into j, −m up to an overall phase factor i
2m.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.018 Published online by Cambridge University Press18 Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
So far, we have primarily dealt with isolated systems, which are described by time-independent
Hamiltonians. A major concern has been the (approximate) determination of the eigenvalues and
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of such a system, by time-independent perturbation theory or by
variational methods. In this chapter, we consider systems that are not isolated, but, rather, interact
with external time-dependent fields (an example is an atom under the influence of an electromagnetic
field). Since the Hamiltonian describing these systems is necessarily time dependent, there are
no longer stationary states – states of definite energy. Hence, our interest here is, typically, to
calculate the probability for a transition from one state to another. Only in the simplest cases can
this probability be calculated exactly. We therefore find it necessary to develop approximate methods
for dealing with this type of problem. One such method is time-dependent perturbation theory.
18.1 Perturbative Expansion for the Time Evolution Operator
We consider the Hamiltonian
Hˆ(t) = Hˆ0 + Vˆ(t) , (18.1)
where the eigenvalues and eigenstates of (the time-independent) Hˆ0 are assumed to be known (if
some of the eigenvalues are degenerate, then the corresponding eigenstates carry an additional
superscript; this superscript is to be understood below):
Hˆ0 |φn = En |φn . (18.2)
Suppose that the perturbation Vˆ(t) is turned on at time t = t0 and that the system is in eigenstate |φi
of Hˆ0 at this time,
|φi(t0) = |φi . (18.3)
The probability that at a later time t > t0 the system is in eigenstate |φf of Hˆ0 is given by
Pf i(t) = |φf |φi(t)|2 , |φi(t) = Uˆ(t, t0)|φi(t0) , (18.4)
where Uˆ(t, t0) is the time evolution operator corresponding to Hˆ(t),
i d
dtUˆ(t, t0) = Hˆ(t) Uˆ(t, t0) , Uˆ(t0, t0) = 1ˆ . (18.5)
If the perturbation were absent, the evolution operator would simply be
Uˆ0 (t, t0) = e−iHˆ0 (t−t0)/ . (18.6)
With the goal of developing a perturbative expansion in powers of Vˆ(t), we make the ansatz
Uˆ(t, t0) = Uˆ0 (t, t0) UˆI(t, t0) , (18.7)
669
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.019 Published online by Cambridge University Press670 Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
and, if the perturbation is weak, UˆI(t, t0) is close to the identity 1ˆ. Inserting this ansatz into Eq. (18.5)
for Uˆ(t, t0), we obtain

The time dependence is contained in the function

where we have defined τ = t − t0 and ω = ωf i. This function is such that
lim
ω→0 f (τ, ω) = τ2 ,
 ∞
−∞
dω f (τ, ω) = 2πτ . (18.22)
For large τ, the function is sharply peaked at ω = 0 and has width ≈ 2π/τ; the area under the curve
f (τ, ω) as a function of ω is 2πτ; indeed, in the limit τ −→ ∞ this function is a representation of
the δ-function,
lim
τ→∞ f (τ, ω) = 2πτ δ(ω) . (18.23)
Thus, for a given τ, the probability Pf i(t) is largest for states |φf whose energies are within the
interval Ei − π/τ and Ei + π/τ, that is, the transition i −→ f occurs preferentially toward states

|φf with energies in a band of width 2π/τ. Consequently, the unperturbed energy Ei is conserved
to within ± π/τ. The transition probability has a maximal value of (τ|Vf i|/)2, and therefore, for
the present perturbative treatment to be valid, we must have
τ 

|Vf i|
. (18.24)
There are situations in which this condition is not satisfied (for example, in the case of the time
evolution of a spin state in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field and a weak time￾dependent magnetic field, discussed in Problem 20 in Chapter 12), and in such situations a different
approximation must be used. However, assuming that the condition 0  τ  /|Vf i| is satisfied,
we have

 δ(Ei − Ef ). The formula for the transition rate Rf i is known as Fermi’s golden rule.

Vˆ(t) = Wˆ e−iωt + Wˆ † eiωt , (18.26)

Problem 1 Time Evolution in a Two-State System
A box containing a particle is divided into right and left compartments by a thin partition. If the
particle is known to be on the right side with certainty, the state is represented by the ket |R; similarly,
if it is known to be on the left side with certainty, the state is represented by the ket |L. The most
general state can then be written as
|φ = |RR|φ + |LL|φ .
The particle can tunnel through the partition. The Hamiltonian describing this system is given by
Hˆ = Δ (|LR| + |RL|) ,
where the parameter Δ is a real number with dimensions of energy.
1. Find the energy eigenvalues and corresponding normalized eigenstates.
2. Suppose that the system at time t = 0 is in state |φ, that is, |ψ(0) = |φ. Obtain the state |ψ(t)
by applying the time evolution operator to |ψ(0).
Hint: it is convenient to expand |φ in the basis of eigenstates of Hˆ.
3. Suppose that at t = 0 the particle is on the right side with certainty. What is the probability for
observing the particle on the left side as a function of time?
4. Expand the state |ψ(t) in the basis consisting of the states |R and |L and, using the time￾dependent Schrodinger equation satisfied by ¨ |ψ(t), obtain a set of coupled differential equations
satisfied by the (time-dependent) expansion coefficients. Show that the solutions of this set of
equations are just what would be expected from part 2.

and the eigenvalues follow from
det(H − E I) = E2 − Δ2 = 0 =⇒ E± = ± Δ .
We denote the corresponding eigenstates as
|ϕ± = c(±)
R |R + c(±)
L |L ,

The time-evolved state follows from
|ψ(t) = e−iHtˆ / |ψ(0) = c+(0) e−iE+t/ |ϕ+ + c−(0) e−iE−t/ |ϕ− ,

Part 3
If the particle is on the right side at t = 0 then cR(0) = 1 and cL(0) = 0, which leads to
|ψ(t) = cos(tΔ/) |R − i sin(tΔ/) |L ,
and the probability that the particle will be on the left side at time t follows from
PL(t) = |L|ψ(t)|2 = sin2 (tΔ/) ;
it is unity at times such that tΔn/ = (2n + 1)π/2 with n = 0, 1, 2, ... .
Part 4
Starting from the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the state ¨ |ψ(t),
i d
dt |ψ(t) = Hˆ |ψ(t) ,
we expand |ψ(t) in the basis |R and |L as
|ψ(t) = cR(t)|R + cL(t)|L ,
so that
i c˙R(t)|R + i c˙L(t)|L = cR(t) Hˆ |R + cL(t) Hˆ |L .
We now project out the above on the |R and |L states, namely R|l.h.s. = R|r.h.s. and similarly for
|L, to obtain a linear system of first-order differential equations
i c˙R(t) = Δ cL(t) , i c˙L(t) = Δ cR(t) ,
with initial conditions cR(0) and cL(0). To solve them, take the time derivative of, say, the first
equation:
c¨R(t) = −i
Δ
 c˙L(t) =⇒ c¨R(t) = −Δ2
2 cR(t) with ˙cR(0) = −i
Δ
 cL(0) .
We find
cR(t) = A cos(tΔ/) + B sin(tΔ/) =⇒ cR(t) = cR(0) cos(tΔ/) − icL(0) sin(tΔ/) ,
where the last expression follows from imposing the initial conditions A = cR(0) and B(Δ/) =
−i(Δ/)cL(0). We obtain cL(t) by noting that
cL(t) = i

Δ c˙R(t) = i

or
cL(t) = cL(0) cos(tΔ/)−icR(0) sin(tΔ/) .
These relations are of course in agreement with those derived in part 2.

Problem 3 Alternative Derivation of Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
Let Vˆ(t) be a time-dependent perturbation and |ψ(t) the state satisfying the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation corresponding to the Hamiltonian ¨ Hˆ0+Vˆ(t) with initial condition |ψ(t0) = |φk,
where |φk is the eigenstate of Hˆ0 of energy Ek. Expanding |ψ(t) (at time t) in the basis of Hˆ0
eigenstates as |ψ(t) = 
n cn (t) e−iEnt/ |φn (the factor e−iEnt/ is included for convenience), obtain a
perturbative expansion for the cn (t). Calculate the corrections up to second order in Vˆ(t), and show

Problem 4 Elastic Scattering Cross Section in Born Approximation
from Fermi’s Golden Rule
Use Fermi’s golden rule to derive the cross section for elastic scattering in the Born approximation.
Solution
The unperturbed Hamiltonian consists of the free-particle Hamiltonian Hˆ0 = pˆ 2/(2m). We are
interested in the transition induced by a (time-independent) interaction Vˆ from an initial free-particle
state |φpi
 of energy Ei = p2
i /(2m) to a final free-particle state |φpf  of energy Ef = p2
f /(2m); both are
eigenstates of Hˆ0 and their energies are infinitely degenerate. We assume here that these states have
the continuum normalization φp |φp = δ(p − p
). The transition rate according to Fermi’s golden
rule is given by
Rpf ,pi = 2π
 δ(Ef − Ei) |φpf | Vˆ |φpi
|2 with pi  pf ,
and we are excluding forward scattering (recall that in the derivation of Fermi’s golden rule we
assumed i  f ). We are dealing here with continuum states and therefore, rather than the rate into
a specific final state |φpf , we are interested in the rate into a set of states with momenta in a small
shell of volume Δpf centered at pf , namely

where we have used pf dpf = m dEf and have integrated out the δ-function enforcing |pf | = |pi| for
the momenta of the final states. The (differential) cross section σ(Ωf ) follows from

Problem 5 Positronium in Static and Oscillating Magnetic Fields
Consider positronium, a bound system consisting of an electron and a positron (the electron’s
antiparticle having the same mass and spin, but opposite charge). In the presence of a uniform and
static magnetic field B= B zˆ and ignoring orbital degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian describing this
system reads
H = α
2 S1 · S2
 H0
+ μB
 (S1z − S2z)
 V
,
where S1 and S2 are the electron and positron spin-1/2 operators, respectively, α is a constant with
dimensions of energy, and
μ = e
mc
;
−e (+e) and m are the charge and mass of the electron (positron). Of course, any component S1
commutes with any component of S2.
1. Define the total spin operator S = S1 + S2. Do S2 and Sz commute with H? Justify your answer by
evaluating the relevant commutators.
2. Work in the basis of eigenstates |SMS of S2 and Sz and obtain the exact energy eigenvalues of the
full Hamiltonian H by diagonalizing
H =

.
3. Regard H0 as the unperturbed Hamiltonian and V as the perturbation, and use time-independent
perturbation theory to obtain the leading (i.e., non-vanishing) corrections to the energies.
Hint: To evaluate second-order corrections in degenerate perturbation theory, one needs to
diagonalize the operator
Z =

kEn
V |φkφk |
n − k
V ,
where the sum over the eigenstates |φk of H0 (with eigenvalues k) excludes those eigenstates in
the degenerate subspace En.
4. Expand the results in part 2 in powers of μ0B/α, and show that they agree with those of part 3.
Therefore, up to and including first-order corrections, show that the approximate eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian H are the states |1 ± 1 with eigenenergy E0 = α/4, and also
|1 = |10 + μB

5. Suppose we introduce an oscillating magnetic field B0 cos(ωt) (in addition to the static field B zˆ)
with the intention of inducing a transition between the states |1 and |2 via stimulated emission
(so that |1 −→ |2) or absorption (so that |2 −→ |1). The electron and positron have magnetic
moments given by, respectively,
μ− = −μ
 S1 , μ+ = μ
 S2 ,
so that the interaction with the oscillating field reads
V(t) = μ

B0 · (S1 − S2) cos(ωt) .
To answer the following questions, use first-order time-dependent perturbation theory.
a. Should the oscillating field be directed along the xˆ-(or yˆ-)axis or along the zˆ-axis? Justify your
answer.
b. Assume B0 = B0zˆ. Obtain the transition rate for the absorption |2 −→ |1.

Part 3
The Hamiltonian H0 has a non-degenerate eigenvalue E0 = −(3/4)α with eigenstate |00 and a three￾fold degenerate eigenvalue E1 = α/4 with eigenstates |1MS. For the non-degenerate eigenvalue, the
first-order correction vanishes since 00|V|00 = 0. The second-order correction is given by
E(2)
0 =

|1MS |V|00|2
E0 − E1

E0 − E1

|10 .
In the degenerate subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue E1, the 3 × 3 matrix representing V
vanishes identically, and so these states remain degenerate in first order. However, in second order
we consider the 3 × 3 matrix Z with matrix elements

Recall that
Six = 1
2 (Si+ + Si−) ,
where Si± are the raising and lowering operators for particle i. When acting on the spin states of
particle i, they yield
S±|∓ =  |± and S±|± = 0 ,
and so, apart from the factor of /2, Six just flips the spin of particle i, that is,
Six |± = 
2 |∓ .
Now consider
(S1x − S2x)|00 = 1

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.019 Published online by Cambridge University Press686 Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
Similarly we find

We conclude that, since the state |2 is a linear combination of |10 and |00, it is orthogonal to both
|11 and 1−1, so that
2|S1x − S2x |1 = 0 .
Therefore, the transition cannot proceed if the B0 field is taken along the xˆ-axis (or in fact along the
yˆ-axis; by a similar argument, the operator Siy also flips the spin state of particle i, except that a phase
factor is included that is different depending on whether, before the flip, the spin is up or down).
By contrast, if B0 is taken along the zˆ-axis, we have (see the previous problem)
(S1z − S2z)|10 =  |00 and (S1z − S2z)|00 =  |10 ,
and hence
(S1z − S2z)|1 = |00 +

Problem 7 Hydrogen Atom in Time-Dependent EM Fields: Doppler
Effect and Recoil Energy
The Hamiltonian of a free hydrogen atom reads
H0 = P2
2M
+ p2
2μ − e2
r = Hcm + Hrel ,
where P is the center-of-mass momentum operator, r and p are the relative position and momentum
operators, and M and μ are the total and reduced masses of the e–p system, respectively. Spin￾dependent effects are neglected throughout. We are concerned here with the interaction of this system
with the electromagnetic fields induced by the vector potential
A(r, t) = A0 ˆ ei(k·r−ωt) + c.c. ,
where k and ω = ck are, respectively, the wave number and angular frequency, ˆ is the polarization
unit vector (perpendicular to k), and A0 is a constant.
1. Express the electromagnetic perturbation V(t), ignoring terms quadratic in A(r, t), in terms of the
center-of-mass and relative position and momentum operators. Show that, in the long-wavelength
approximation, in which the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is large relative to the atomic
dimensions, V(t) can be written as
V(t) = W e−iωt + W† e−iωt , W = −qA0
μc
eik·R ˆ · p ,
where R is the center-of-mass position operator.
2. Introduce the basis |φK; ψγ, consisting of the tensor product of eigenstates |φK of the center-of￾mass momentum operator and eigenstates |ψγ of the relative Hamiltonian (the quantum numbers
identifying the eigenstates of Hrel are denoted collectively by γ). Consider a transition from the
state |φK; ψγ of relative energy En to a state |φK; ψγ of relative energy En. Show that the
matrix element of W between the states |φK; ψγ and |φK; ψγ is different from zero only if
there exists a certain relation between K, k, and K
. Give a physical interpretation of this relation.
3. Show that, for an absorption process (En > En), resonance occurs when the photon energy ω
differs from the energy ω0 = En − En by a quantity δE consisting of the sum of two terms δE1
and δE2, where δE1 depends on the angle between K and k (the Doppler effect) and δE2 is
independent of K. What is the physical meaning of δE2? Show that for a typical atomic transition
δE2 is negligible relative to δE1.

Note that the condition ∇ · A(r, t) = 0 (the Coulomb gauge) ensures that pp and A(rp, t), and pe and
A(re, t), respectively commute with each other. Therefore, we define
H0 = p2

terms quadratic in the vector potential are ignored. The position and momentum operators of the

Under the assumption that the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is large compared with the
dimension of the bound two-particle system – the long-wavelength approximation (LWA) eik·r ≈ 1 –
we can ignore the dependence on the relative position in the vector potential, that is,
A[R + (μ/mp)r, t] −→ A(R, t) , A[R − (μ/me)r, t] −→ A(R, t) .

For the perturbation V(t) we obtain
Vf i(t) = δ(K − k − K) wf i e−iωt + δ(K + k − K) wf i eiωt ,
and therefore the matrix element vanishes unless K = K + k for absorption (negative-frequency
term) or K = K − k for emission (positive-frequency term). The δ-function enforces momentum
conservation (the photon has momentum k).

To leading order these corrections can be expressed as

by replacing ω with ω0. We see that the sign of δω1 – the Doppler shift – depends on the relative
orientation of the atom and photon momenta, while δω2 depends only on the resonance frequency.
Since ω0 = k0/c, δE2 represents the kinetic energy of the atom as it recoils after absorption of the
photon. The ratio of these corrections (assuming 2 |cos θ| ≈ 1) is

Problem 8 Two Spin-1/2 Particles of Opposite Charge in a
Time-Dependent Magnetic Field
Consider two spin-1/2 particles with opposite charges q and −q coupled to an external time￾dependent magnetic field zˆ B(t), which is adiabatically turned on and off as t goes from −∞ to ∞.
The Hamiltonian describing this system reads
H(t) = μB(t)
 (S1z − S2z) ,
where μ = gq/(2mc) is the magnetic moment (m, c, and g are the mass, speed of light, and
gyromagnetic factor, respectively). At time t = −∞, the system is in state |10, that is, in an eigenstate
of S2 and Sz, where S = S1 + S2, with eigenvalues 22 and 0, respectively.
1. Calculate exactly the state of the system at t = ∞. Without doing any detailed calculation, explain
why the probabilities for the transitions |10 −→ |1 ± 1 vanish identically. Calculate the
probability for the transition |10 −→ |00, showing that it depends only on the integral
 ∞
−∞
dt B(t) ,
assumed to be convergent.
2. Calculate the probability for the transition |10 −→ |00 in first-order perturbation theory. By
comparing with the exact result above, justify under what conditions this leading-order calculation
is valid.

The operator S1z −S2z commutes with Sz (but not with S2, see Problem 5); as a consequence, we have
SM|S1z − S2z|S
M
 = 0 if M  M ,
and hence transitions between states with different M and M cannot occur. Further, we note that
(S1z − S2z)|1 ± 1 = 0 , (S1z − S2z)|10 =  |00 , (S1z − S2z)|00 =  |10 ,
and the equations for cSM(t) decouple for SM = 11 or 1–1, yielding ˙c1±1 (t) = 0 or c1±1 (t) = c1±1 (t0),

In the present case, the initial state is |10 at t0 = −∞ and so c10 (−∞) = 1 with all remaining

Problem 9 Hydrogen Atom in a Time-Dependent Electric Field
A hydrogen atom in the 1s ground state (we will ignore spin degrees of freedom) is placed in a
uniform and weak electric field in the z-direction, zˆ E0 e−t/τ, which is turned on at time t = 0. The
associated perturbation reads
V(t) = eE0z e−t/τ ,
where −e and z are, respectively, the charge and z-component of the position operator of the electron.
1. State which transition (or transitions) to the first excited level of the hydrogen atom are allowed
by this perturbation, in first order.
2. Calculate the probability in first order that the hydrogen atom is excited to the 2p level at t 
 τ.
3. Can the transition 1s −→ 2s occur in second order? Justify your answer.
4. Carry out the calculation of the 1s −→ 2s transition to second order as far as you can. Ignore the
contribution of the eigenfunctions in the continuum.

Solution
Part 1
In principle, the possible transitions are 1s −→ 2s and 1s −→ 2pm with m = 0 and ±1, although, as we
will see, the first transition cannot occur in first-order perturbation theory. The first-order amplitude
reads
Af i = − i

 eE0

0
dt ei( f −i)t

/ e−t

/τφ2lm| z |φ100 .
Recalling that the eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian have parity (−1)l and the
position operator is odd under parity, we see that the matrix element between the 1s and 2s state
vanishes identically,
φ2s| z |φ1s = 0 .
Alternatively, the Wigner–Eckart theorem states that φ200 | z |φ100 =C10 (00; 00) φ20 || r ||φ10 = 0,
since C10 (00; 00) = 0. By contrast, the matrix element between the 1s and 2pm states is given by
φ21m| z |φ100 = C10 (00; 1m) φ21 || r ||φ10 = δm,0 φ21 || r ||φ10 .
Note that parity does not yield any additional selection rule in this case (the initial and final states
have opposite parity). Thus, the only allowed transition is 1s −→ 2p0.

to the states np0, since

Problem 10 Charged Harmonic Oscillator Subjected to an Electric Field Pulse
Suppose an electron (mass m and charge −e) is in the ground state of a one-dimensional Hamiltonian
with a harmonic oscillator potential of angular frequency ω0. An electric field of amplitude E0 is
suddenly turned on at time t = 0 and then off at time t = τ, that is, E(t) = E0 [θ(t) − θ(t − τ)], where
θ(u) is the step function, equal to 1 for u > 0 and equal to 0 for u < 0.
1. What is the leading-order probability P10 (t ≥ τ) that the electron will be found in the first-excited
state of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian at time t ≥ τ? Same question, but for P20 (t ≥ τ),
that is, the leading-order probability for a transition to the second excited state.
2. By making use of the properties of the translation operator, the probabilities P10 (t > τ) and
P20 (t > τ) can be calculated exactly. Show that the exact expressions reproduce the results
obtained above.

we arrive at
P(1)
10 (t ≥ τ) =
	
eE0


2 
2mω0
sin2 (ω0τ/2)
(ω0/2)2 .
We see that for fixed ω0 the first-order probability is proportional to sin2 (ω0τ/2), thus being largest
for τ equal to nπ/ω0 with n odd, and vanishing for τ equal to nπ/ω0 with n even.
We now turn to calculating the probability for a transition to the second excited state. Since x has
a vanishing matrix element between |0 and |2 (by explicit calculation or by parity selection rule),
the transition probability between these two states cannot occur in first-order perturbation theory. In
second order, we have
P(2)
20 (t ≥ τ) = |A(2)
20 (t ≥ τ)|

in the second line we have inserted the completeness relation. In the sum over states, only the state
|1 contributes, since m| x |n  0 iff m = n ± 1, and hence

since
UT(a0) x U†
T(a0) = x − a0 , UT(a0) p U†
T(a0) = p .
A symmetry transformation, such as the translation above, preserves the eigenvalues and therefore
H and H0 have the same eigenvalues, En = ω(n + 1/2), up to a constant shift (eE0)2/(2mω2
0 ). By
contrast, the eigenstates |n
 of H are related to the eigenstates |n of H0 via
|n

Now, at time t = 0− the system is in the state |0 of H0, and at time t = 0, when the electric field is
switched on, we can expand the state |0 in the basis of H eigenstates and then evolve it in time with
e−iHt/, namely,

Problem 11 A One-Dimensional Model for the Photoelectric Effect
Consider a particle of mass m and charge q in one dimension, subject to the potential V(x) = −α δ(x)
with α > 0. This potential admits a single bound state of energy E0 and corresponding wave function
given by
E0 = −mα2

For each positive energy E = 2k2/(2m), there are two independent stationary wave functions ϕk,+(x)
and ϕk,−(x), corresponding, respectively, to an incident particle coming from the left or from the
right. They can be shown to satisfy the continuum normalization (see Problem 9 in Chapter 7),

The particle also interacts with an oscillating electric field of angular frequency ω; the perturbation
is given by
V(t) = −qEx cos(ωt) ,
where E is the amplitude of the electric field. Assuming ω > −E0, calculate the transition
probability per unit time Γk0 to an arbitrary positive energy state, expressing it as a function of
λ = ω/|E0 |. How does Γk0 depend on λ? This problem provides a simple one-dimensional model
for photo-ionization (the photoelectric) effect.

Problem 12 Inelastic Scattering of a Projectile at a Target: A Simple Model
A heavy projectile of charge Ze travels by a heavy target in a straight (undeviated) trajectory (along
the zˆ-axis) described by rp (t) = b xˆ + vt zˆ. The projectile interacts with a particle of charge e in the
target via the Coulomb potential
V(t) = Ze2

where r is the position of the target particle. Assume that the Hamiltonian describing this target
particle can be modeled by the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian,

The target particle is initially in the ground state represented by the wave function φi(r) =

by the wave function φf (r) = φ1 (x) φ0 (y) φ0 (z) with one quantum of excitation in the transverse

where b0 =

/(mω0) and K1 (γ) is the modified Bessel function of order 1. Assume that |r||rp (t)|,
working in the dipole approximation to simplify the calculation.
Let F be the number of projectiles per unit time and per unit area incident on the target. The number
of projectiles per unit time traversing a ring of radius b and thickness db surrounding the target is
(2πb db)F and the number of transitions per unit time is then obtained as F(2πb db)Pf i(b, v) ≡
Fdσf i, yielding the (inelastic) differential cross section dσf i/db = 2πbPf i(b, v). Calculate the total
cross section under the assumption that b  b0 (that is, the projectile is “outside the target”). Note
that most of the contribution to the cross section comes from ω0b/v  1, where K1 (ω0b/v) ≈ v/(bω0).
Solution
The perturbation can be expanded as (suppressing the time dependence of rp for brevity)

Problem 13 Ionization of a Hydrogen Atom by an External Electromagnetic Field
In this problem, we will calculate the cross section for the ionization of a hydrogen atom by an
electromagnetic wave. The (real) vector potential A(r, t) inducing the electric and magnetic fields
associated with this wave is written as
A(r, t) = Ak

ei(k·r−ωt) + e−i(k·r−ωt)

, Ak = A ˆ k ,
where ˆ k is the unit vector specifying the polarization of the electromagnetic wave, and in the
Coulomb gauge (which we assume here) we have ∇ · A(r, t) = 0, implying k · ˆ k = 0.
1. Write down the Hamiltonian, including the coupling of the magnetic field B(r, t) = ∇ × A(r, t)
to the electron spin magnetic moment. The proton is assumed to be fixed at the origin. Justify
why in the long-wavelength approximation (LWA), where the wavelength λ associated with the
electromagnetic wave is much larger than the Bohr radius a0, the electron spin magnetic-moment
term can be neglected.
2. Hereafter, ignore the quadratic term in the vector potential, and show that the Hamiltonian consists
of the unperturbed term Hˆ0 (the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian) and a perturbation Vˆ(t) given by
Vˆ(t) = e
mec


Obtain the operator Wˆ.
3. Consider the transition, induced by Vˆ(t), from the initial ground state |φ1s = |φ100 of
energy Ei = E1s = −e2/(2a0) to a final unbound state (where the atom is ionized) of energy
Ef = Ep = p2/(2me). This final state should in principle be represented by a continuum solution
of Hˆ0 (a Coulomb wave function). However, if the energy with which the electron is emitted is
much larger than its binding energy e2/(2a0), then it is reasonable simply to approximate the final
state by a free-particle state |φp, an eigenstate of the momentum operator (but not of H0!). Under
these assumptions, namely
ka0  1 and Ep

calculate the rate Rp,1s for the transition 1s −→ p, and hence the rate ΔΓ(1s −→ p) summed over
a set of final electron states with momenta in a shell Δp , that is,

where α = e2/(c) is the fine-structure constant and pˆ is the unit vector specifying the the electron
momentum direction (note that here it is not the electron momentum operator); this direction
is relative to the incoming electromagnetic wave direction specified by kˆ. Lastly, show that the
conditions above for the validity of this result are not incompatible with each other.
4. Show that the energy density and energy flux (the Poynting vector), associated with the
electromagnetic wave and averaged over the period T = 2π/ω, are given by
uT = 1

Since the Poynting vector ST has dimension of energy per unit area and per unit time, a photon”
flux (that is, the number of photons per unit area and per unit time) can be defined:
3
photon flux = ST
ω = A2
2π
k .
Having determined the photon flux, obtain the photo-ionization cross section in hydrogen
corresponding to a given polarization k of the incident wave.
5. There are two independent (mutually orthogonal) polarizations, ˆ k,1 and ˆ k,2, each orthogonal
to k, such that ˆ k,1, ˆ k,2, and kˆ constitute a basis in three-dimensional space (that is, these
three unit vectors specify a right-handed coordinate system). The cross section obtained in part
4 corresponds to one of these polarizations ˆ k,i. Obtain the differential cross section averaged
over the polarizations of the electromagnetic wave and the corresponding total cross section by
integrating over the directions of the emitted electron.

3 At this stage, this definition is simply ad hoc, since the concept of photons has not emerged as a consequence of the
quantization of the electromagnetic field. However, the expressions for the cross section and, in fact, radiative transition
amplitudes that we will derive below and in Problems 13–15, when properly interpreted, remain correct, even when the
fields are quantized. This treatment is known as the semiclassical approach.

where only the first term contributes (the second δ-function can never be satisfied, since Ep > 0 and
E1s < 0). This term corresponds to the absorption of energy ω from the incident electromagnetic
wave (i.e., the absorption of a “photon” of energy ω), resulting in the emission of the electron. As
already noted, treating it as a free particle is justified if the energy Ep

.
In the LWA we can set the plane wave factor eik·r as approximately equal to unity.4 This is so because
the bound-state wave function (or, rather, its gradient) is exponentially small forr 
 a0, and therefore
the contribution to the integral is mostly coming from a spherical region of radius of order a0, where
|k · r|  1. Under these conditions the matrix element can be expressed as
φp| Wˆ |φ1s = Ak · φp| pˆ |φ1s = Ak · p φp|φ1s ,
where we have taken advantage of the fact that |φp is an eigenstate of the momentum operator.5
Note that the inner product φp|φ1s does not vanish here. In contrast with |φ1s, |φp is not in the
basis of Hˆ0 eigenstates; as a matter of fact, it is an exact eigenstate of the kinetic energy operator
alone, but not of Hˆ0. With the normalized ground-state wave function

4 Of course, we can evaluate the transition rate without relying on the LWA; however, in that case for a realistic treatment we
also need to account for spin-dependent interaction effects. 5 Had we used the exact continuum state |φEp  to describe the final electron then this property would not be satisfied,
since such a state would not be an eigenstate of the momentum operator. However, evaluation of the matrix element Ak ·
φEp | pˆ |φ1s in that case would be facilitated by the identity pˆ = −i(me/)[ rˆ , Hˆ0 ], yielding
φEp | Wˆ |φ1s = −i(me/)(E1s − Ep) Ak · φEp | rˆ |φ1s = imeω Ak · φEp | rˆ |φ1s ,
where in the last line we have used the conservation of energy as enforced by the δ-function.

Problem 14 Cross Sections for Stimulated Absorption and Emission in Hydrogen
Calculate the cross sections for stimulated absorption and emission in hydrogen induced by a
monochromatic electromagnetic wave of wave number k, resulting in a transition from an initial
bound state |φi to a final bound state |φf (for absorption, Ei < Ef while for emission Ei > Ef ).
Treat the cases in which the electromagnetic wave has polarization ˆ k or is unpolarized, and work
in the long-wavelength approximation (LWA), utilizing the semiclassical approach developed in
Problem 13, a prerequisite for the present problem. Comment the results.
Solution
As shown in Problem 13, in the LWA the coupling of the spin magnetic moment of the electron to the
magnetic field induced by the electromagnetic wave can be neglected, and the Hamiltonian is simply
taken as

where Hˆ0 is the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian (relativistic corrections in Hˆ0 due to kinetic energy,
Darwin–Foldy, and spin–orbit terms are ignored here for simplicity but could be accounted for
without incurring conceptual difficulties). We have also introduced the definitions of Problem 13,
Wˆ = Ak eik·rˆ ˆ k · pˆ , Wˆ † = Ak e−ik·rˆ ˆ k · pˆ ,
where ˆ k is the polarization vector of the electromagnetic wave. From Eq. (18.34), the transition rate

In the LWA (which amounts to setting eik·r ≈ 1), the matrix element is given by φf | Wˆ |φi = A ˆ k ·

we find

where the ± sign depends on whether we are dealing with absorption (+) or emission (−), and the
transition rate is then obtained as

A2 |φf | ˆ k · rˆ |φi|2 δ(Ef − Ei ∓ ω) ,
where in the δ-function the − sign is for absorption and the + sign is for emission (α is the
fine structure constant). The cross section for the discrete transition i −→ f induced by the
electromagnetic wave follows by dividing the rate by the incident “photon flux” (see Problem 13):
σab/em
f i (ω) = Rab/em
f i ω)
kA2/(2π) = 4π2α ω |φf | ˆ k · rˆ |φi|2 δ(Ef − Ei ∓ ω) ,
which removes the A2 factor. The cross section is proportional to the matrix element squared of the
electric dipole operator Dˆ = −e rˆ between the initial and final states, and it vanishes unless the energy
difference between these states matches the “photon energy” ω. Note that the calculation above
ignores the energy of the recoiling atom after the absorption or emission process (see Problem 7 for
a treatment of this effect). Lastly, in reality sharp δ-function peaks are not observed, but rather peaks
that are spread out by the natural line width (see Problem 17). As a consequence, what is actually
measured is the area under the curve, namely

 .
Of course, if the incoming electromagnetic wave is unpolarized, an average over polarizations must
be taken, resulting in the replacement |ˆ k · rf i|
2 −→ r2
f i − (kˆ · rf i)2 (see Problem 13).
6 We note that if relativistic corrections are retained in Hˆ0, this identity is no longer valid since the spin–orbit term does not
commute with rˆ and the relativistic kinetic energy term leads to a commutator [ rˆ , pˆ 4 ] that is proportional to pˆ 3. In such a
case, one needs to evaluate directly the matrix element of pˆ.

Problem 15 Spontaneous Emission: Selection Rules
The semiclassical approach introduced in Problem 13 allows one to describe not only stimulated
absorption and emission but also spontaneous emission, that is, the process i −→ f + γ. Consider an

as giving the probability per unit time for the emission of a photon of wave number k (and
hence momentum p = k), energy E = ω = c|k|, and polarization ˆ k, in the long-wavelength
approximation (LWA).
1. Assuming that the energy density of the electromagnetic field is due to the emitted photon enclosed
in the volume V, show that the factor A2 in Rem
f k,i is given by
A2 = 2πc2
Vω .
2. Consider the rate ΔΓem
i→f summed over a set of photon states with wave numbers in the shell Δk
with solid angle ΔΩ, namely
ΔΓem

3. What selection rules have to be satisfied for the spontaneous emission rate in hydrogen to be
non-vanishing?
Solution
Part 1
As shown in Problem 13, the energy density of the electromagnetic field averaged over the period
T = 2π/ω is given by
uT = 1
2π
ω2
c2 A2 ,
and, if this energy is assumed to be due to the photon, then it follows that
uT = ω
V =⇒ A2 = 2πc2
Vω .
Part 2
Substituting the expression for A2 obtained above, the rate for the emission of a photon of wave
number k and polarization ˆ k can be expressed as
Rem
f k,i = (2π)2αc ω
V |φf | ˆ k · rˆ |φi|2 δ(Ef − Ei + ω) ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.019 Published online by Cambridge University Press713 18.3 Problems

It is worthwhile pointing out here that the correct quantum treatment of the system consisting of an
atom + electromagnetic fields leads to this same expression (at this order).

rˆx ± irˆy

, ˆr0 = rˆz ,
with similar relations for the polarization vector. Using the fact that ˆrμ is an irreducible tensor
operator of rank 1, we have from the Wigner–Eckart theorem that
φnf lf mf | rˆμ |φnilimi
 = C1li(μmi; lf mf ) φnf lf || rˆ ||φnili
 ,
and hence the matrix element vanishes unless lf = 1, if li = 0, or unless lf = li − 1, li, li + 1 if li ≥ 1;
in either case, mf = μ + mi. Further, rˆ is an odd operator under parity and hence the matrix element
vanishes unless the initial and final states have opposite parity. Since the parity of the state |φnlm is
(−1)l
, we must have (−1)li+lf = −1; hence li and lf are, respectively, even and odd, or vice versa.
From these selection rules, we conclude that the matrix element vanishes if lf  |li − 1|, li + 1 and/or
mf  μ + mi.
Problem 16 The 2p −→ 1sTransition in Hydrogen
Calculate, in the long-wavelength approximation (LWA), the differential rate for the transition 2p −→
1s in hydrogen, averaged over the azimuthal quantum numbers of the initial 2p state and summed

solid angle corresponding to all directions of emission of the photon, and provide a numerical value

and the matrix element involves the spherical component m of the emitted photon’s polarization.
These components are relative to the coordinate system in which the z-axis defines the quantization
axis of the angular momentum component Lz. Since k · ˆ k = 0, the polarization vectors are in the
plane perpendicular to the photon wave number k. This means, for example, that if the photon is
emitted in the z-direction then its polarization vector is in the xy-plane and therefore the only non￾vanishing matrix elements are those involving transitions from the m = ±1 states, but not from the
m = 0 state.

We see that the average over m is independent of the photon polarization, thus resulting in an overall
factor of 2 when summing over the photon polarizations. The rate is isotropic, that is, independent of
the direction in which a photon is emitted. When integrated over all directions, this rate reads

and the lifetime of the 2p level in hydrogen is τ2p→1s = 1/Γ2p→1s ≈ 1.59 × 10−9 sec. Since the
state has a finite lifetime, the corresponding spectral line will have a width in energy of order

which equals 3.4 eV.
Problem 17 Theory of the Line Width
The derivation of the line width illustrated here is due to Wigner and Weisskopf (Problems 14 and
15 are prerequisite to the present problem). It proceeds through the following three steps.
1. Let |φn be a basis of H0 eigenstates with energies En, and let Vˆ be a perturbation. Consider the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation ¨

expansion coefficients;

2. A hydrogen-like atom in an excited state |φ1 decays to a lower energy state |φ0 by emission of
a single photon. Denote the initial state of the system atom + electromagnetic field as |φ1; 0 and
the final state as |φ0; kλ, where k and ˆ λ are the wave number and polarization of the photon
(here λ = 1, 2 specify the polarization in the plane transverse to k). In the state space of atom +
electromagnetic field, expand |ψ(t) as
|ψ(t) = c1,0 (t) e−iE1t/ |φ1; 0 +

atomic states other than |φ0 and |φ1). The initial conditions are c1,0 (0) = 1 and c0,kλ (0) = 0, that

The equation above is the starting point for the perturbative calculation of the cn (t) discussed in
Problem 3. However, below we do not expand in powers of the perturbation, but rather truncate the
state space by retaining only the states |φ1; 0 and |φ0; kλ.

Comment: We now justify the assumptions for the function I(ω, γ; t) with ω = ωk − ω10, made in

Here, the closed contour C is taken to consist of the following pieces: C1 is along the real axis and
runs from −ω to −η, then around the semicircle of radius η centered at the origin (to avoid the
singularity of f (z) at the origin), and back on the real axis from η to ω (with the understanding that
η −→ 0 and ω −→ ∞ at the end of the calucation); C2 is parallel to the imaginary axis and runs
from ω to ω +iγ/2; C3 is parallel to the real axis and runs from ω +iγ/2 to −ω +iγ/2; and C4 is
parallel to the imaginary axis and runs from −ω + iγ/2 back to the real axis at −ω. Apart from the
semicircle around the origin, the closed contour C=C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 is a rectangle. The integrand
is analytic inside C and hence 
C dz f (z) = 0, so that (schematically)

Problem 18 Formal Scattering Theory
This problem deals with formal developments in scattering theory for a system described by a
generally time-dependent Hamiltonian Hˆ(t) = Hˆ0 + Vˆ(t).
1. Introduce the interaction representation state |ψI(t) = eiHˆ0t/ |ψ(t) and obtain an integral equation
for the time evolution operator UˆI(t, t0) such that |ψI(t) = UˆI(t, t0)|ψI(t0) (see Problem 12 in
Chapter 7 – a prerequisite to the present problem – and also Section 18.1). Next, consider the
limits t0 −→ −∞ and t −→ ∞. In order to make the time integrals mathematically meaningful in
the expansion for UˆI(t, t0), multiply each Vˆ
I(t) by a damping factor e−η|t| with the understanding
that η −→ 0 at the end of the calculation (that is, the interaction is slowly turned on and then off
as t changes from −∞ to ∞), and define the Sˆ operator (the so-called S-matrix) as
Sˆ = lim
η→0
lim
t→+∞ lim
t0→−∞ Uˆ η
I (t, t0) , |ψI(∞) = Sˆ |ψI(−∞) .
Note that |ψI(−∞) is a free state and denote it by |φi, so that Hˆ0 |φi = Ei|φi (namely, |φi is
the initial state of the system before scattering has taken place). Obtain the probability that, after
scattering has occurred, the system is in a free state |φf of energy Ef in terms of the S-matrix.
2. Hereafter, assume that the perturbation is time independent (apart from the damping factor). Carry
out the time integrations, and show that the amplitude φf |Sˆ|φi can expressed as
φf | Sˆ |φi = δf i − 2πi δ(Ef − Ei) φf | Tˆ |φi , Tˆ = lim

where we have defined the Tˆ operator (the T-matrix). Show that

where |ψ(+)
i  satisfies the Lippmann–Schwinger equation introduced in Eq. (15.31). Verify that
|ψ(+)
i  is an eigenstate of the full Hamiltonian Hˆ = Hˆ0 + Vˆ with energy Ei.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.019 Published online by Cambridge University Press721 18.3 Problems
3. Obtain an expression for the probability amplitude Af i(t) = φf (t)|ψi(t) at time t, where |ψi(t)
is the state e−iHtˆ / |ψi(0), evolving in time according to the full Hamiltonian and |φf (t) is the
free state at time t, namely |φf (t) = e−iEf t/ |φf. To this end, first note that
|ψi(t) = e−iHtˆ / |ψi(0) = e−iHtˆ / |ψI,i(0) = e−iHtˆ / lim

Uˆ η
I (0, −∞) |ψI,i(−∞)

and then carry out the time integrations in Uˆ η
I (0, −∞) to arrive at
Af i(t) = φf | ei(Ef −Hˆ)t/ |ψ(+)
i  .
Show that the transition rate Rf i = d|Af i(t)|
2/dt can be expressed as
Rf i = 2

δf i Im (Tii) +
2π
 |Tf i|
2δ(Ei − Ef ) .
Hint: In calculating Rf i, the time derivative of Af i(t) is needed; first take the time derivative of
ei(Ef −Hˆ)t/ and then let ei(Ef −Hˆ)t/ act on |ψ(+)
i .
Solution
Part 1
In the interaction picture, the state vector |ψI(t) of the system is obtained from the Schrodinger- ¨
picture state vector |ψ(t) via the unitary transformation
|ψI(t) = eiHˆ0t/ |ψ(t) .
It satisfies the equation
i d
dt |ψI(t) = Vˆ
I(t) |ψI(t) , Vˆ
I(t) = eiHˆ0t/ Vˆ(t) e−iHˆ0t/ .
The state |ψI(t) can be written as |ψI(t) = UˆI(t, t0) |ψI(t0), where the (unitary) time-evolution
operator for the state in the interaction representation obeys

with the understanding that η −→ 0 at the end of the calculation; that is, the perturbation is very
slowly turned on and then off as t varies between −∞ and ∞. The trick is to make the integrals

and t0 −→ −∞ to obtain

which leads to the Sˆ operator defined in the text of the problem. Thus the probability for the transition
from the initial free state |φi = |ψI(−∞) to the final free state |φf, after scattering has taken place,
is given by
Pf i = |φf | Sˆ |φi|2 .

In this chapter we consider systems made up of identical particles. Identical particles have the same
properties (mass, spin, charge, etc.) and, as far as we know, cannot be distinguished from each other
by experiment. So every electron (or every proton, or He atom, or photon, . . . ) in the universe is
identical to every other electron (or proton, or He atom, or photon, . . . ). This fact leads to a difficulty –
known as exchange degeneracy – which must be resolved in order to avoid ambiguities in applying
the quantum mechanical postulates. To see how this difficulty comes about, consider two identical
spin-1/2 particles (we ignore other degrees of freedom, such as position or momentum, to keep things
simple). We number the particles arbitrarily as 1 and 2, and the corresponding spin operators as Sˆ 1
and Sˆ 2. Suppose one particle has spin up and the other has spin down along the zˆ-axis. Since the
particles are indistinguishable, the states |1, +; 2, − and |1, −; 2, +, where in the first ket particle 1
has spin up and particle 2 has spin down and in the second ket vice versa, represent the same physical
state. By the superposition principle, so does any linear combination of the form
α |1, +; 2, − + β |1, −; 2, + with |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1 .
We now ask what is the probability that particles 1 and 2 both have spin up along the xˆ-axis. This
state can be written as

.
This probability is given by |α + β|
2/4; it depends on the coefficients α and β, and consequently
cannot be determined unambiguously.
The exchange degeneracy is removed by the symmetrization postulate, which states that the
physical states of a system consisting of identical particles must be either symmetric or antisymmetric
with respect to the exchange of any two (identical) particles, that is, under such an exchange the
state is multiplied by +1 (symmetric case) or −1 (antisymmetric case). It turns out that the physical
states of particles whose spin is an integer, including 0 (for example, the pion and photon, which
have, respectively, spins 0 and 1) are symmetric, while those of particles with half-integer spin (for
example, the electron and quark, which have both spin 1/2) are antisymmetric. The former particles
are known as bosons, and the latter as fermions.1
The symmetrization postulate also holds for composite particles, such as, for example, the He
atom which consists of a nucleus – two protons and two neutrons bound together by the strong force
1 The symmetrization “postulate” can actually be derived in the context of relativistic quantum field theory on the basis of
very general assumptions. In this sense, it can be viewed as a consequence in quantum mechanics of special relativity.

(the proton and neutron, which are themselves composite particles, have spin 1/2 and are therefore
fermions) – and two electrons. When we exchange two He atoms in a state describing a system of He
atoms, we exchange all their constituents, so that is, the two protons, the two neutrons, and the two
electrons. Therefore, the state describing this system acquires an overall sign factor resulting from
the product of the sign factors associated with the exchanges of the individual constituents. Since in
the specific case of the He atom, the exchange involves six fermions and hence the product of six
minus signs, the overall sign factor is plus and the He atom is therefore a boson. We conclude that a
composite particle is either a boson or a fermion, depending only on whether the number of fermion
constituents is either even or odd2.
In the following, we consider the implications of the symmetrization postulate on the description
of systems consisting of identical fermions or bosons.
19.1 States of Identical Particles
To begin, let |ψγ be a basis in the state space of a single particle (this basis could be made up of the
simultaneous eigenstates of a complete set of commuting observables, collectively denoted by Γˆ, and
so Γˆ|ψγ = γ |ψγ). Next consider two particles, which we label as 1 and 2. A basis in the combined
space of these two particles is provided by the tensor product |ψγ1 (1)⊗|ψγ2 (2), which we denote
as |ψγ1,γ2 (1, 2) (particle 1 is in state |ψγ1  and particle 2 in state |ψγ2 ). Note that
|ψγ1,γ2 (1, 2) = |ψγ2,γ1 (2, 1) , (19.1)
since the order of the states – that is, |ψγ1 (1)⊗|ψγ2 (2) or |ψγ2 (2)⊗|ψγ1 (1) – is irrelevant
in the tensor product. The symmetrization postulate requires that the physical states (those realized
in nature) are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of particles 1 and 2,
depending on whether the two particles are bosons or fermions expressed as,

,
(19.3)
where in the kets on the left-hand sides of the equations |ψS/A
γ1,γ2 , we have removed the particle labels,
since all we need to know is that there are two particles, one of which is in the (single-particle) state
|ψγ1  and the other of which is in the (single-particle) state |ψγ2 ; in other words, we need to know
only which single-particle states are occupied. Comparing Eqs. (19.2) and (19.3) we see that we
can symmetrize or antisymmetrize the states |ψγ1,γ2 (1, 2) with respect to either the particles or the
quantum numbers.
An immediate consequence of the symmetrization postulate is Pauli’s exclusion principle, that is,
two fermions cannot occupy the same single-particle state, for then |ψA
γ,γ would vanish identically.
This restriction does not hold in the case of two bosons, indeed, for γ1 = γ2, we have
2 The rule we have established for the addition of angular momenta is in line with the spin-statistics rule of the symmetrization
postulate, in the sense that the addition of an even or odd number of half-integer spins results in a total spin which is either
integer or half-integer – a boson in the former case and a fermion in the latter.

given by |ψS
γ,γ = |ψγ,γ (1, 2). The states |ψS/A

To make this more concrete, consider a system of two identical and free particles of spin S; the
eigenvalue of S2 is 2S(S + 1). The wave function of a single particle of momentum p and spin
projection s with s = −S, −S + 1, ... , S reads
ψps(r) = 1

state, the determinant vanishes (corresponding to Pauli’s exclusion principle), while the permanent
gives ψS
ps,ps(r1, r2) =

in the corresponding single-particle states (see the previous case of two bosons). It is clear that the
state (19.11) obeys the symmetrization postulate: the determinant changes sign if either any two
rows are interchanged (corresponding to the exchange of two particles) or any two columns are
interchanged (corresponding to the exchange of two sets of quantum numbers). The determinant is
known as a Slater determinant. In the permanent case, no minus sign occurs under either interchange.

and the factor N! is needed to avoid overcounting.
These multi-particle states are adequate to describe systems for which the mutual interactions
among particles vanish or are weak. Note that the individual particles need not be free. For example,
the state of N bound electrons in the attractive Coulomb field of a nucleus can be written as in Eq.
(19.11), where γ, in the single-particle state |ψγ, denotes the quantum numbers n, l, m,s. However,
such an N-electron state would not be very realistic, since the Coulomb repulsion between electrons
cannot be ignored.

Problem 1 Energy Levels of Three Identical Fermions or Three Identical Bosons
Let the Hamiltonian of a single spin-1/2 fermion be given by h = (a/) Lz, where Lz is the z-component
of its orbital angular momentum and the constant a > 0 has the dimensions of energy. What are the
energies and degeneracies for a system of three such identical and non-interacting fermions? Assume
the fermions are all in p-wave orbitals (that is, they all have angular momentum L = 1). What are the
energies and degeneracies if the system consists, instead, of three identical and non-interacting spin-0
bosons?
Solution
In a p-wave state the single-particle energy levels are −a, 0, a (the eigenvalues of Lz are m with

describing the three (non-interacting) fermions is given by

Each of the three single-particle levels can accommodate at the most two fermions (one with spin up
and the other one with spin down). The possibilities are in Table 19.1, where, for example, (p−1)2, p0
means two of the fermions are in orbital state |p−1 and the remaining fermion is in orbital state |p0.
In the bosonic case, each level can accommodate one, two, or three bosons. The resulting energies
and degeneracies are given in Table 19.2.
Problem 2 When Can the Symmetrization Postulate Be Ignored?
The requirement that the wave functions of electrons (or, for that matter, any identical fermions) be
antisymmetric raises the question whether it is really necessary to antisymmetrize the wave functions
of all the electrons in the universe at the same time as we are trying to solve for the wave functions
of, say, the helium atom. We expect that particles at large distances from one another should be
independent and that it should only be necessary to consider the symmetry of particles which are
located within small distances from each other. A reasonable criterion can be established for whether
it is necessary to antisymmetrize, by considering the following example.
A system consists of two one-dimensional potential wells Vl(x) and Vr(x) with their centers located
a distance a apart. Assume initially that a is large. One particle is in the left-hand well, while the
other is in the right-hand well. The normalized states describing these particles are, respectively,
|ϕl(1) and |ϕr(2), where we assume that the single-particle states |ϕl and |ϕr are eigenstates of,
respectively, the left- and right-hand Hamiltonians, defined as
Hˆl = pˆ
2
2m
+ Vˆ
l , Hˆr = pˆ
2
2m
+ Vˆ
r .
1. Suppose the particles are distinguishable. Let |φx (i)φx (i)| be the projection operator onto the
state in which particle i is at position x. Calculate the number density n(x) that either particle is at
position x; that is, the expectation value of 
i |φx (i)φx (i)| on the two-particle state. What is the
normalization of n(x)?
2. Now, suppose the particles are fermions. Calculate the number density nA(x) in this case and the
difference nA(x) − n(x). Interpret the results in light of the comments made in the introduction to
the problem.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press731 19.2 Problems
3. Assume that the potentials are harmonic oscillator wells centered at x = ±a/2 and, further, that each
particle is in the ground state of its respective well. Calculate the overlap (inner product) ϕl|ϕr,
thus justifying the interpretation above.
Solution
Part 1
The unsymmetrized state and corresponding wave function for the pair of particles are given by
|ψ = |ϕl(1)⊗|ϕr(2) , ψ(x1, x2) = ϕl(x1) ϕr(x2) .
The number density that either particle is at x follows:
n(x) = ψ|φx (1)φx (1)|ψ + ψ|φx (2)φx (2)|ψ = 

and its normalization is just given by the total number of particles

where it should be noted that the single-particle states |ϕl and |ϕr are not orthogonal to each other,
since they are eigenstates of different Hamiltonians. Hence, the overlap ϕl|ϕr is strictly non-zero.
However, since the wave functions ϕl(x) and ϕr(x) fall off exponentially outside their respective
(left- and right-hand) potential wells, this overlap will be small if the two wells are separated by a
distance which is large compared with the “sizes” of the two wave functions. Of course, while this
argument holds strictly for bound states, it remains valid in the case of scattering states as long as the
associated wave packets do not have a significant overlap.

Part 3
The ground-state wave functions are
ϕl(x) = (b/π)
1/4e−b(x+a/2)
2/2 , ϕr(x) = (b/π)
1/4e−b(x−a/2)

Clearly, for large a it will be very small and the effect of antisymmetrization will also be very small. In
other words, antisymmetrization should be considered only in those cases where the overlap between
wave functions is significant.
Problem 3 Properties of the Exchange Operator
Define the exchange operator Pˆ21 as follows:
Pˆ21 |ψγ1,γ2 (1, 2) = |ψγ1,γ2 (2, 1) = |ψγ2,γ1 (1, 2) ,
so that Pˆ21 exchanges particle 1 with particle 2 or the corresponding quantum numbers. Since these
states form a basis, the operator Pˆ21 is uniquely defined in the full two-particle state space. Show
that the exchange operator is such that Pˆ 2
21 = 1ˆ, and that it is hermitian and unitary. Further, show
that under the exchange operator a generic operator Oˆ(1, 2) acting in the two-particle state space
transforms according to

Problem 4 Two Bosons or Two Fermions in a Central Potential
Consider a system of two identical particles interacting by a central potential depending only on the
magnitude of their relative position. Its Hamiltonian reads
H = p2
1
2m
+
p2
2
2m
+ V(|r1 − r2 |) .
1. Show that, in terms of the center-of-mass and relative variables, the above Hamiltonian simpli￾fies to

 Hrel
,
where P and p are the total and relative moment a operators and r is the relative position operator.
2. In the two-particle state space, a basis is provided by the position eigenstates |φr1,r2  = |φr1 (1) ⊗
|φr2 (2) of particles 1 and 2. Define the exchange operator P21 in such a way that its action on
this basis is as follows:
P21 |φr1,r2  = P21 |φr1 (1)⊗|φr2 (2) = |φr1 (2)⊗|φr2 (1) = |φr2,r1  .
Now, use the basis of position eigenstates |φR,r = |φR⊗|φr to show that in this basis P21 |φR,r =
|φR,−r. Further show that, if |ψP,Enlm denotes the basis of common eigenstates of the observables
P, Hrel, L2, and Lz, these states are represented in the basis |φR,r as follows:
|ψP,Enlm = 1
(2π)3/2 
dR eiP·R/

dr Rnl(r) Ylm(rˆ) |φR,r .
Hence
P21 |ψP,Enlm = (−1)
l
|ψP,Enlm .
3. Assume the two identical particles are bosons of spin 0. Are there any restrictions on the allowed
values of l? Next, assume that the two identical particles are fermions of spin 1/2, and denote by
|φR,rSM the basis of common eigenstates of R, r, S2, and Sz, where S is the total spin. Show that,
under the exchange operator, we have
P21|φR,rSM = (−1)
S+1 |φR,−rSM .
Show further that
P21|ψP,Enlm,SM = (−1)
l+S+1 |ψP,Enlm,SM ,
where |ψP,Enlm,SM is the basis of common eigenstates of P, Hrel, L2, Lz, S2, and Sz. What values
of l are allowed in, respectively, spin-singlet (S = 0) and spin-triplet (S = 1) states?

we have

Part 2
Consider the state |φR,r; it can be expanded as
|φR,r =

dr1 dr2 |φr1,r2 φr1,r2 |φR,r =

dr1 dr2 δ[(r1 + r2)/2 − R] δ(r1 − r2 − r) |φr1,r2  ,
and hence
P21 |φR,r =

dr1 dr2 δ[(r1 + r2)/2 − R] δ(r1 − r2 − r) P21 |φr1,r2   |φr2,r1

|φr1,r2  = |φR,−r ,
where in the second line we have made the exchange of integration variables r1  r2 (the Jacobian
of the transformation is unity), which then yields the desired result.
The basis of eigenstates |ψP,Enlm consists of the tensor product
|ψP,Enlm = |ψP⊗|ψEnlm ,
where |ψP and |ψEnlm are, respectively, in the center-of-mass and relative state spaces, so that, for
example,
H|ψP⊗|ψEnlm = 
Hcm|ψP

⊗ |ψEnlm + |ψP ⊗ Hrel |ψEnlm =

|ψP⊗|ψEnlm .
Thus, using the completeness relation for the basis |φR,r, we obtain

Part 3
If the particles are bosons, the state must be even under their exchange, and hence l must be even. If,
instead, the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, the state |φR,rSM consists of the tensor product |φR,r ⊗
|SM, where these states are in the orbital and spin state spaces, respectively. Now, recall that the spin
states can be written as
|11 = |1, +; 2, + , |10 = 1
√
2
(|1, +; 2, − + |1, −; 2, +) , |1−1 = |1, −; 2, − ,
and
|10 = 1
√
2
(|1, +; 2, − − |1, −; 2, +) ,
yielding
P21 |SM = (−1)
S+1 |SM , S = 0, 1 ;
the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states are, respectively, odd and even under the exchange. It follows
that
P21 |φR,rSM = (−1)
S+1 |φR,−rSM ,
which then leads, following the same steps as in part 2, to
P21 |ψP,Enlm,SM = (−1)
l+S+1 |ψP,Enlm,SM .
Since the two-fermion state must be odd under exchange, we must have (−1)l+S+1 = −1, so that l is
even for a spin singlet (S = 0) and odd for a spin triplet (S = 1).
Problem 5 Two-Particle Transition Amplitudes in a Central Potential
Two particles (1 and 2) with the same mass interact via a potential V(r) that depends only on the
distance r between them.
1. Show that the time evolution operator for such a system factorizes as follows:
U(t, t0) = Ucm(t, t0) Urel(t, t0) ,
where Ucm(t, t0) and Urel(t, t0) are the time evolution operators corresponding to the center-of￾mass and relative Hamiltonians, respectively. Show that these operators are scalars with respect
to independent rotations in the center-of-mass and relative state spaces.
2. Consider the two-particle free state |ψp1,p2  = |ψp1 ⊗|ψp2 , where |ψpi
 is the eigenstate of the
momentum operator of particle i with eigenvalue pi. Show that under a rotation in the combined
center-of-mass and relative orbital spaces it transforms as
|ψP,p −→ |ψP,p
 = |ψR P,R p ,
where P = p1 + p2 and p = (p1 − p2)/2 – the center-of-mass and relative momentum eigenvalues,
respectively – and R P and R p are shorthand notations for P
i = 
j RijPj and p
i = 
j Rijpj, where
R is the 3 × 3 (orthogonal) rotation matrix.
3. Assume that the two particles do not have spin and are distinguishable. At time t0 the system is in a
state |ψpzˆ,−pzˆ, where particles 1 and 2 are in momentum eigenstates with eigenvalues pzˆ and −pzˆ,
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press736 Systems of Identical Particles
respectively. Let U(t, t0) be the time evolution operator of the system. Show that the probability
amplitude of finding this system in a state |ψpnˆ,−pnˆ at time t1 > t0 is given by
A(nˆ) = ψpnˆ |Urel(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ ,
where |ψpnˆ is the eigenstate of the relative momentum operator with eigenvalue pnˆ and where the
direction nˆ is specified by the polar and azimuthal angles θ and φ. Show that the amplitude A(nˆ)
is independent of φ, that is, it is invariant under rotation about the zˆ-axis. Calculate the probability
of finding either of the two particles (without specifying which one) with momentum pnˆ and the
other one with momentum −pnˆ. What happens to this probability if θ is changed to π − θ?
4. In the same spin-independent potential, now consider two identical particles, one of which is
initially in the state |ψpzˆ,s and the other in the state |ψ−pzˆ,s with s  s
. Here, s and s refer to
the eigenvalues s and s
 of the spin component along the zˆ-axis. Express in terms of A(nˆ) the
probability of finding, at time t1, one particle with momentum pnˆ and spin s and the other one
with momentum −pnˆ and spin s
.
5. Now, treat the case s = s
. In particular, examine the θ = π/2 direction, distinguishing between two
possibilities: either the particles are bosons (integer spin) or fermions (half-integer spin). Show
that the scattering probability is the same in the θ and the π − θ directions.
Solution
Part 1
The time evolution operator is given by
U(t, t0) = e−iH(t−t0)/ = e−iHcm(t−t0)/

,
where P and p are the center-of-mass and relative momentum operators, and r is the relative position
operator (see Problem 4 for the definitions of these in terms of ri and pi). The time evolution operator
factorizes, since Hcm and Hrel commute with each other. The Hamiltonian, being a scalar, commutes
with the components of the total orbital angular momentum L=L1 +L2 =Lcm +Lrel with Lcm = R×P
and Lrel = r × p, and hence it also commutes with the rotation operator given by
UR(ϕnˆ) = e−iϕL·nˆ/ = e−iϕL1 ·nˆ/ e−iϕL2 ·nˆ/ = e−iϕLcm ·nˆ/ e−iϕLrel ·nˆ/ ,
where the intermediate steps hold since the components of L1 and L2 (Lcm and Lrel) commute with
each other. Thus, we have
[ UR(ϕnˆ) , H ] = 0 ,
which implies that
Hcm = Ucm†
R (ϕnˆ) Hcm Ucm

Part 2
Under a rotation the eigenstates |ψp1,p2  = |ψp1 ⊗|ψp2  of the momentum operators p1 and p2
transform as
|ψp1,p2  −→ |ψp1,p2 
 = UR(ϕnˆ) |ψp1,p2  = |ψR p1,Rp2  ,

= |ψR P,R p ,
where, for example, |ψR p1  is the eigenstate of the momentum operator p1 with eigenvalue p
1 = R p1.
This follows by noting that (see Section 16.2)
φr |ψp
 = φr |UR(ϕnˆ)|ψp = φR−1r |ψp = eip·(R−1r)
(2π)3/2 = ei(Rp)·r
(2π)3/2 = φr |ψRp ,
where we have used p · (R−1r) = (R−1R p) · (R−1r) = (R p) · r.
Part 3
Since the total momentum operator P commutes with H and hence with U(t, t0), it is conserved. In
the specific case under consideration and in terms of center-of-mass and relative variables, we have
the state |ψ0,pzˆ at t0 and the state |ψ0,pnˆ at t1 (both with vanishing total momentum eigenvalue), and
the transition amplitude reads
A(nˆ) = ψ0,pnˆ |U(t1, t0)|ψ0,pzˆ = ψpnˆ |Urel(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ = ψpnˆ |Urel†
R (ϕzˆ)Urel(t1, t0)Urel
R (ϕzˆ)|ψpzˆ
= ψRpnˆ |Urel(t1, t0)|ψRpzˆ ,
where we are considering here a rotation by ϕ about the zˆ-axis. Clearly, the initial state is invariant
under such a rotation and |ψRpzˆ = |ψpzˆ, while for the final state we have (p = pnˆ)

We conclude that A(θ, φ) = A(θ, φ+ϕ), that is, the transition amplitude is the same for any arbitrary
angle ϕ, and hence it must be independent of the azimuthal angle φ, so that p = pnˆ can be taken to
be in the xz-plane, that is, nˆ = (sin θ, 0, cos θ).
Since the particles are distinguishable, the probability of observing one of them with momentum
pnˆ and the other one with momentum −pnˆ (without specifying which is which) must be given by
Pdis = |A(nˆ)|
2 + |A(−nˆ)|
2 ,
where A(nˆ) and A(−nˆ) are the amplitudes for a transition to a final state in which particle 1 has
momentum pnˆ and particle 2 has momentum −pnˆ and vice versa, specifically
A(nˆ) = ψpnˆ,−pnˆ |U(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ,−pzˆ = ψpnˆ |Urel(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ ,
A(−nˆ) = ψ−pnˆ,pnˆ |U(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ,−pzˆ = ψ−pnˆ |Urel(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ .

The relative momentum −pnˆ has components p(− sin θ, 0, − cos θ), and under a rotation by π about
the zˆ-axis transforms as follows:
−pnˆ −→ pnˆ  , nˆ  = (sin θ, 0, − cos θ) ,
using the expression for Rp obtained above.
Since the amplitude is invariant under rotations about the zˆ-axis it follows that A(−nˆ) = A(nˆ 
),
so that
Pdis = |A(nˆ)|

which shows that this probability is invariant if θ −→ π − θ, since under such a transformation
(a reflection relative to the xy-plane) we have nˆ  nˆ 

The initial and final states need to be symmetrized or antisymmetrized depending on whether the

and similarly for the final state. Note that here |ψpzˆ,ss and |ψ−pzˆ,ss are defined as follows:

(2) , |ψ−pzˆ,ss = |ψ−pzˆ (1)⊗|s
(1)⊗|ψpzˆ (2)⊗|s(2) ,
where we have made explicit the particle labeling. The amplitude for the transition reads

transition ss −→ ss with s  s is given by
PS/A
ss = |A(nˆ)|
2 ,
and is independent of the statistics of the two particles (whether they are bosons or fermions).
Part 5
If the spin states of the two particles are the same (s = s

and similarly
ψpnˆ,ss|Urel(t1, t0)|ψ−pzˆ,ss = A(−nˆ) .
On the basis of the argument in parts 3 and 4, this can be further simplified as
S/Aψpnˆ,ss|Urel(t1, t0)|ψpzˆ,ss
S/A = A(nˆ) ± A(−nˆ) = A(nˆ) ± A(nˆ 

which shows that these probabilities are invariant under a reflection with respect to the xy-plane, since
nˆ  nˆ  under such a transformation. We also note that at θ = π/2 we have nˆ = nˆ  = xˆ, with xˆ = (1, 0, 0),
and hence the probability above vanishes for fermions and is equal to 4|A(xˆ)|
2 for bosons, which is
twice as large as the value Pdis obtained earlier.
Problem 6 Properties of Permutation Operators for Three Particles
A basis in the three-particle state space is obtained as
|ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (1, 2, 3) = |ψγ1 (1)⊗|ψγ2 (2)⊗|ψγ2 (3) ,
and the particular ordering of the single-particle states |ψγi(i) within the tensor product is
unimportant. There are 3! possible permutations of the particle labels 1, 2, 3 (or γ1, γ2, γ3):

where the first row gives the reference ordering (which we have arbitrarily chosen as 123; it could
be any permutation of 123) and the second row specifies the permutation actually being considered;
for example,
	
123
231

=⇒ 1 −→ 2, 2 −→ 3, 3 −→ 1 .
The ordering of the columns within the brackets is irrelevant, in the sense that
	
123
231

,
	
312
123

, ...
all represent the same permutation. The corresponding 3! exchange operators are denoted as Pˆ123,
Pˆ231, Pˆ312, Pˆ213, Pˆ321, and Pˆ132, and
Pˆmnp |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (1, 2, 3) = |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (m, n, p) ,
so that, for example,
Pˆ231 |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (1, 2, 3) = |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (2, 3, 1)  |ψγ1 (2)⊗|ψγ2 (3)⊗|ψγ3 (1)
= |ψγ3,γ1,γ2 (1, 2, 3) .
The set of 3! permutation operators forms a finite group, defined by the following properties:
(i) the product of two permutation operators is also a permutation operator; (ii) the permutation
operator Pˆ123 is the identity operator; and (iii) for every permutation operator there exists an
inverse permutation operator. Verify these facts by considering, as an example, the two permutation
operators Pˆ231 and Pˆ213: obtain the permutation operator corresponding to Pˆ231 Pˆ213 and determine
the inverse Pˆ−1
231. Permutation operators generally do not commute: verify this fact by showing that
Pˆ231 Pˆ213  Pˆ213 Pˆ231. Lastly, they are unitary but not hermitian (except in the case of two particles,
for which the exchange operator is both hermitian and unitary, see Problem 3). Note that all these
properties generalize to the case of N particles, and the set of N! permutation operators forms a group.
Solution
The product of permutation operators Pˆ231 Pˆ213 is seen to correspond to the permutation operator
Pˆ132. One way to verify this consists in applying Pˆ231 Pˆ213 to the basis |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (1, 2, 3) and showing
that the resulting state is Pˆ132 |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (1, 2, 3) = |ψγ1,γ2,γ3 (1, 3, 2) = |ψγ1,γ3,γ2 (1, 2, 3). Another
way is to write

where in the second step we have rearranged the columns of Pˆ213 so that the top line matches the
lower line of Pˆ231. To determine the inverse of a permutation operator we can proceed similarly. The
inverse Pˆ−1

Pˆ312 and Pˆ231 commute, as they must. As noted in the text of the problem, generally permutation

Problem 7 Symmetrizer and Antisymmetrizer and N-Particle States
Here, we consider permutation operators in an N-particle system. A permutation operator that only
involves two particles and leaves the remaining N−2 particles unaffected is known as a pair-exchange
or transposition operator. For example, in the three-particle case (see Problem 6), Pˆ213, Pˆ321, and Pˆ132
are transposition operators: the first involves the pair 12, the second involves the pair 13, and the third
involves the pair 23. Transpositions are hermitian and equal to their inverse, which also makes them
unitary (the proofs are similar to those for Pˆ21).
It turns out that any N-particle permutation operator can be decomposed into a product of pair￾exchange operators. This decomposition is not unique. For example, for the three-particle case and
Pˆ231, we have

However, the number p of pair-exchange operators into which a given N-particle permutation
operator can be factored is always either even or odd. So, the parity (−1)p of any N-particle
permutation operator is unique. Among the N! (necessarily an even number for N ≥ 2) permutation
operators, half of them have parity plus and the remaining half have parity minus, so in the three￾particle case, Pˆ123, Pˆ231, Pˆ312 have even parity and Pˆ213, Pˆ321, and Pˆ132 have odd parity. In particular,
the identity permutation operator has even parity, while the pair-exchange operators all have odd
parity.
1. Given a permutation operator Pˆ α, where α specifies a permutation of 12 ··· N, let α be its
parity, either + or −. Define the operators Sˆ and Aˆ, known respectively as a symmetrizer and

where the sum is over all N! permutations, and show that they are projection operators and that

2. Properly symmetrized multi-boson or multi-fermion states can be written in terms of a sym￾metrizer or antisymmetrizer as
|ψS/A
γ1,γ2,...,γN  = c Sˆ/Aˆ |ψγ1,γ2,...,γN (1, 2, ... ,N) ,
where |ψγ1,γ2,...,γN (1, 2, ... ,N) = |ψγ1 (1)⊗|ψγ2 (2)⊗···⊗ |ψγN (N), and c is a normalization
constant. How do these states change under a pair exchange? And under a generic permutation
Pα? Determine the normalization constant.
Solution
Part 1
The symmetrizer is a projection operator if Sˆ† = Sˆ and Sˆ2 = Sˆ; similarly, for the antisymmetrizer. To
verify the hermiticity (recall that the individual Pˆα are not generally hermitian), note that Pˆα is unitary
and hence Pˆ†
α = Pˆ−1
α and, since Pˆα Pˆ−1
α is the identity permutation, which has even parity, it follows
that Pˆ−1
α has the same parity as Pˆ α. From the group property we know that Pˆ−1
α corresponds to one
(and only one) of the N! permutation operators, and therefore 
α Pˆ−1
α is the same operator as 
α Pˆ α,

the only difference being that the N! terms are summed up in a different order.4 A similar argument
can be used to verify that Aˆ is hermitian.
To show that Sˆ2 = Sˆ and Aˆ2 = Aˆ, first note that
Pˆ β Sˆ = 1

Pˆ γ = Sˆ , Sˆ Pˆ β = 1

N!

γ
Pˆ γ = Sˆ ,
where we have used the group property that Pˆ β Pˆα corresponds to one (and only one) of the N!
permutation operators and that, as α cycles through all of them, the product Pˆ γ = Pˆ β Pˆα runs over all
N! individual permutation operators. For the antisymmetrizer we have
β Pˆ β Aˆ = 1
N!

α
β α Pˆ β Pˆα = 1
N!

γ
γ Pˆ γ = Aˆ ,
since the parity of the product is equal to the product of the parities. Because 2
β = 1, by multiplying
both side of the relation above by β we can write
Pˆ β Aˆ = β Aˆ ,
We also have
β Aˆ Pˆ β = Aˆ =⇒ Aˆ Pˆ β = β Aˆ .
With these properties in hand, we now see that
Sˆ2 = 1

and

β Pˆ β Sˆ = Sˆ 1

β = 0 ,
since half the permutation operators have even parity and the remaining half have odd parity; further,
the fact that Sˆ and Aˆ are hermitian ensures that Sˆ Aˆ = 0.
Part 2
It is easily verified that these states are either symmetric (S) or antisymmetric (A) under the action of
a generic pair-exchange operator Pˆ e (which has always odd parity), since Pˆ e Sˆ = Sˆ and Pˆ e Aˆ = −Aˆ.
Incidentally, this implies that if two or more fermions occupy the same single-particle state then

Problem 8 Expectation Value of a Totally Symmetric Operator on an N-Particle Antisymmetric
State
Consider a system of N identical fermions. Show that, in order to evaluate the expectation value of
a totally symmetric operator Oˆ(1, ... ,N) (that is, Oˆ commutes with any pair-exchange operator), it
suffices to antisymmetrize only the state immediately to the left or right of Oˆ. Consider the cases in
which Oˆ consists of the sum of one-body operators ˆo(i) and two-body operators ˆo(ij), specifically
Oˆ(1, ... ,N) =

N
i=1
oˆ(i) , Oˆ(1, ... ,N) = 1
2

N
i,j=1
oˆ(ij) .
Solution
In the notation of Problem 7, the normalized antisymmetric state reads |ψA
γ1 ···γN  =
√
N! Aˆ |ψγ1 (1) ···
ψγN (N), where Aˆ is the antisymmetrizer. The expectation value can then be expressed as
O = ψA
γ1 ···γN |Oˆ(1, ... ,N)|ψA
γ1 ···γN  = N! 
ψγ1 (1) ··· ψγN (N)| Aˆ†
Oˆ(1, ... ,N) Aˆ|ψγ1 (1) ··· ψγN (N) .
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press745 19.2 Problems
Since Aˆ is a projection operator (Aˆ† = Aˆ and Aˆ2 = Aˆ) and since it commutes with the totally symmetric
operator Oˆ, it follows that
O = N! ψγ1 (1) ··· ψγN (N)| Oˆ(1, ... ,N) Aˆ|ψγ1 (1) ··· ψγN (N)
= √
N!ψγ1 (1) ··· ψγN (N)| Oˆ(1, ... ,N) |ψA

and the only term that contributes in the sum over permutations is |ψPα γ1 (1) ... ψPα γN (N) =
|ψγ1 (1) ... ψγN (N) (that is, Pˆα is the identity permutation, of even parity), since any other
permutation involves the exchange of at least two γs and therefore vanishes by orthogonality. By
contrast, if Oˆ consists of the sum of two-body (2b) operators, the expectation value reads

Problem 9 The Fermi Gas
A simple example of a many-body system is a non-interacting gas of identical fermions, called a
Fermi gas. The Fermi gas has been used as a simple model to describe a variety of different systems,
including electrons in metals or protons and neutrons (nucleons) in nuclei.
1. Consider a single fermion of spin S (Sz|m = m|m with m =−S, ... , S), confined in a box of
volume V (and side V1/3). Imposing periodic boundary conditions, obtain the eigenvalues and
corresponding normalized eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press746 Systems of Identical Particles
2. Now, suppose that there are N non-interacting fermions confined in the box. Calculate the ground￾state energy E0 of such a system, expressing it in terms of N and the Fermi energy – the energy of
the highest occupied single-particle level. Work in the limit V −→ ∞. Knowing that the pressure
P0 is given by P0 = −∂E0/∂V (at zero temperature), obtain P0.
Solution
Part 1
The Hamiltonian is H = p2/(2m) and commutes with the momentum operator p. The simultaneous
eigenfunctions of H and p can be written as
ψk,m(r) = 1
V1/2 eik·r
|m , m = −S, −S + 1, ... , S ,
where k is the wave number (the corresponding momentum p is k) and m labels eigenstates of Sz.
The wave numbers k are quantized, with
k = 2π
V1/3 n , n = (nx, ny, nz) , ni = 0, ±1, ±2, ... ,
as required by the periodic boundary condition; indeed,
ψk,m(x + V1/3, y,z) = 1
V1/2 eikx (x+V1/3) ei(kyy+kzz)
|m = ei2πnx ψk,m(r) = ψk,m(r) ,

and are quantized. The state of the particle is uniquely determined by its wave number k and spin
projection m. The energy above is degenerate: the ground-state energy is 0 and is (2S + 1)-fold
degenerate, the first-excited-state energy is 2π22/(mL2) and is 6(2S+1)-fold degenerate, and so on.

Part 2
In accordance with Pauli’s exclusion principle, the ground state is the state in which the N lowest
single-particle states are occupied. Let us denote by EF the energy of the highest occupied single￾particle level,
EF = 2k2
F
2m ,
and EF is the Fermi energy. Since each state with wave number k can accommodate 2S + 1 fermions,
the total number N of fermions must equate
N = (2S + 1)

nz
θ(n2

where θ(u) is the step function, which is equal to 1 if u ≥ 0 and 0 if u < 0. This condition can also
be written as
N = (2S + 1)

k
θ(kF − |k|) = (2S + 1)

k≤kF
,
and the role of the step function is to enforce the constraint |k| ≤ kF. The ground-state energy E0 of
the fermion gas then follows from
E0 = (2S + 1)

k
2k2
2m
θ(kF − |k|) .
In the limit V −→ ∞ (the thermodynamic limit) the wave numbers k are densely distributed, and we
can describe their distribution with a function ρ(k). Since there is a single wave number in each cell
centered at k and volume (2π)3/V, the function ρ(k) must satisfy the condition
ρ(k) (2π)3
V = 1 =⇒ ρ(k) = V
(2π)3 .
As a result, we can convert a sum over k into an integral over ρ(k) dk via

k
−→ 
dk ρ(k) = V
(2π)3

dk .
In the large-volume limit, we then have
N = (2S + 1) V

dk θ(kF − k) , E0 = (2S + 1) V
(2π)3

dk
2k2

These integrations can easily be carried out to obtain

Note that as the volume of the box goes to infinity, both the number of particles and the ground-state
energy E0 become infinite, as should be expected since they are both extensive quantities. If we are
going to use the Fermi gas model to approximate physical systems, we need to take the infinite￾volume limit into account in such a way that some intensive quantity remains fixed. A reasonable
quantity to fix is the number density

The ground-state energy per particle can now be rewritten as

N = 3

EF with EF = 2

where EF is the Fermi energy, defined earlier. Note that the energy per particle increases as the volume
is reduced while keeping N fixed (that is, the density is increased). This means that the Fermi gas is
exerting a pressure on the walls of the box, the so-called degeneracy pressure given by
P0 = −∂E0

This result also follows from the thermodynamic relationship P = −∂F(V, T)/∂V, where F(V, T) is the
free energy and T is the temperature, by observing that at zero temperature the free energy reduces
to the system’s ground-state energy.
Problem 10 White Dwarf Stars
In stars like our sun, energy is generated by the “burning” of hydrogen into helium, namely by
converting, through a network of reactions known as the pp cycle, four protons into a helium nucleus
(
4He), a bound system of two protons and two neutrons (the binding is provided by the strong
interaction).5 White dwarfs are (small) stars that have exhausted their hydrogen supply, and consist
predominantly of 4He nuclei and electrons. Their brightness is due to the release of gravitational
energy by slow contraction. This contraction is counteracted by the Pauli pressure due to the electron
gas. Typical parameters of a white dwarf are
density ρ ≈ 107 g/cm3 , mass M ≈ 1033 g , central temperature T ≈ 107 K .
The thermal energy kBT corresponding to this temperature (kB is the Boltzmann constant) is ≈ 103
eV, and therefore the helium atoms are ionized. The electron number density N/V can be estimated
to be of the order 1030 cm−3 by noting that the mass M of the star is given by
M ≈ Nme +
N
2

2mp + 2mn

≈ 2Nmp ,
where we have ignored the binding energy of the 4He nucleus, and have taken its mass to be 2mp+2mn
with mp and mn the proton and neutron masses, respectively (in the last step we have also ignored the
p–n mass difference). We make the further simplifying assumption of neglecting interactions among
the electrons and between these and the 4He nuclei, and regard the electrons as a Fermi gas of free
spin-1/2 particles. We have for the Fermi energy (the energy of the highest occupied level)
EF = 2
2me
	
3π2 N
V

2/3
≈ 20 MeV , TF = EF
kB
≈ 1011 K .
Since the central temperature T  TF, we can consider the Fermi gas in the limit of zero temperature.
The zero-point pressure P0 is equilibrated by the gravitational attraction, due almost entirely to the
nuclei. The white dwarf model then consists of N electrons and N/2 motionless 4He nuclei (the star
is electrically neutral). It turns out there is a critical mass Mc such that for masses larger than Mc
5 More precisely, the pp sequence of reactions coverts 4p + 2e− into 4
He + 2νe + γ and releases energy Eγ = (4mp + 2me −
M)c2 − 2Eνe  ≈ 26.7 MeV, where M is the mass of the 4He nucleus.
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009473637.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press749 19.2 Problems
no white dwarf can exist, that is, the zero-point pressure from the electron gas is insufficient to
counteract the gravitational attraction. The aim of the problem is to estimate Mc.
1. The calculation of the ground-state energy E0 of the Fermi gas needs to be amended, since the
Fermi energy is much larger than the rest mass energy of the electron. Calculate E0, using the
relativistic expression for the single-particle energy, namely Ek = c

(k)2 + (mec)2 where c is the
speed of light, and show that it is can be expressed as

Obtain the zero-point pressure P0 and show that, in the two limits xF  1 (the non-relativistic
regime) and xF

neglected),

2. Express the zero-point pressure in the two regimes above as a function of the physical parameters
of the star, its mass M and radius R rather than as a function of the electron number density N/V
(the star can be assumed to be spherical).
3. Assume that the gravitational self-energy of the star is −γGM2/R, where G is the gravitational
constant and γ is a parameter of the order of unity. From the condition of equilibrium between
the (outward) zero-point pressure and (inward) gravitational attraction, establish a relationship
between the mass and radius of the star in the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic regimes.
Interpret the results and deduce the critical mass Mc.

Problem 11 The Thomas–Fermi Approximation for Many-Electron Atoms
Consider a many-electron atom and denote by n(r) the local electron number density at r (spherical
symmetry is assumed throughout). We assume that the “electron gas” is in hydrostatic equilibrium,
so that
∇P(r) = −en(r) E(rrˆ) ,
where P(r) is the pressure, −en(r) is the electron charge density (here e > 0), and E(rrˆ) is the radially
directed electric field. This field includes the contribution (Ze/r2) rˆ due to the nucleus as well as the
contribution due to the electrons.
1. Use the Fermi gas model to express the local pressure P(r) as function of the electron number
density n(r) (the so-called local density approximation) and obtain a relationship between the
electrostatic potential φ(r), recalling that E= −∇φ, and n(r), where n(r −→ ∞) = 0. Use this
relationship to derive the following non-linear equation satisfied by φ(r),
∇2φ(r) = κ φ3/2 (r) ,
where κ is a constant to be determined in terms of e, the Bohr radius a0 = 2/(m e2), and a
numerical coefficient. Note that in the limits r −→ 0 and r −→ ∞, the potential satisfies the
boundary conditions φ(r −→ 0) = Ze/r and φ(r −→ ∞) = 0, where Ze is the nuclear charge.

3. Evaluate the kinetic energy of the atomic electrons by assuming that the average kinetic energy per
electron is given by the Fermi-gas result (3/5)EF(r), where EF(r) is the Fermi energy in the local
density approximation. Evaluate the potential energy of the atomic electrons by observing that it
consists of an attractive contribution (electron–nucleus interactions) and a repulsive contribution
(electron–electron interactions). Obtain the total energy of the atom and show that it scales as Z7/3.

where we have introduced the Bohr radius a0. Note that the constant must be zero, since φ(r)
vanishes at infinity. The Poisson equation states that ∇2φ(r) = 4πen(r), and this equation can be
converted into one involving only φ(r) by replacing n(r) as indicated above,

Thomas–Fermi approximation predicts ground-state energies for high-Z atoms that are reasonably

approximately –19.0 eV as compared with the –20.9 eV of the Thomas–Fermi approximation.
