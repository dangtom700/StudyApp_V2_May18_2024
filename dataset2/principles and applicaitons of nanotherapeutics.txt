Introduction 
As a result of recent developments in the realm of nanotechnology, the study of nano￾therapeutics has become an extremely popular subject among researchers and phar￾maceutical industry professionals. When compared to more conventional approaches 
to medical care, nanotherapeutics have been shown to be superior in terms of per￾formance. Several benefts entice people to focus on fnding answers to public health 
issues. However, there is only a limited amount of information available regard￾ing nanotherapeutics and the developments in the feld. Because of this, additional 
advancements and developments in this sector have become more diffcult, and as a 
result, there may be a dearth of innovations in this subject as a direct consequence 
of this. 
Nanotherapeutics traced back to the ancient eras when colloidal gold was used 
as a medicine. Since then, nanotherapeutics has achieved many breakthroughs, 
and today, it is a goal of many scientists in the fght against new pandemic threats. 
Therefore, this information may help to spread the knowledge based on nanothera￾peutics among the population who is interested in this feld without barriers in access 
to the relevant information. 
This book provides a broad overview of information pertaining to nanothera￾peutics, including knowledge based on fundamentals, history and progress, appli￾cations, practical elements and examples, and the prospects of nanotherapeutics. 
Fundamentals of nanotherapeutics will explain the mechanisms and theories behind 
the phenomena. Moreover, future prospects of nanotherapeutics enable the research 
interests of young scientists toward nanotherapeutics and accelerate drug entities to 
resolve public health concerns that have become a serious threat globally. 
The book offers comprehensive coverage of the most essential topics: 
1. Provides a comprehensive knowledge on fundamentals, applications, cur￾rent situation and ongoing research, latest implementations and merits of 
nanotherapeutics to gain manufacturing advantages, medical benef ts, envi￾ronmental effects and economic issues, and risk assessment on humans. 
2. Highlights the practical aspects and prospects in order to enhance the use 
of nanotherapeutics in health f eld. 
3. Discusses in detail the signifcance of using nanotherapeutics in futuristic 
life with appropriate examples. 
4. Provides novel research ideas through the information to scientists in order 
to fnd sustainable resolutions to issues in public health matters.
 5. Fulf lls the timely need of an up-to-date book that covers emerging trends 
and all aspects of nanotherapeutics, including fundamentals, applications, 
implementations, practical examples (Failures and success), and future 
prospects.

 Introduction to 1 Nanotherapeutics 
1.1 DEFINITION OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanotechnology has infuenced healthcare tactics in the modern era and is 
expected to have a signif cant impact on the provision of better healthcare services. 
Nanotherapeutics have developed into a gold mine in the world of pharmaceuticals 
and medicine that is also owed to a number of achievements at the intersection of 
nanotechnology and medicine. Nanotherapeutics, which operate at the level of indi￾vidual molecules or molecular complexes at the “nano” scale of around 100 nm or 
less, offer new avenues in various medical diagnosis, monitoring, and treatments 
(Ventola, 2012). The use of engineered nanostructures and nanodevices to “monitor, 
repair, construct, and govern biological systems at the molecular levels of humans” 
represents what is meant by the term “nanotherapeutics” (Prasad et al., 2018). The 
use of nanoscale technology and applications in healthcare industry can be referred 
to as nanotherapeutics. It is basically utilized for better understanding of the funda￾mental disease mechanisms in addition to disease diagnosis, prevention, and treat￾ments (Freitas, 2005). 
The size of nanotherapeutics, which resembles biological macromolecules and 
makes them suitable for both in vitro and in vivo applications, is its most intriguing 
aspect. Nanotherapeutics is the discovery, modifcation, and manipulation of atomic 
or molecular structures of objects with a size of 1–100 nm (Bharali and Mousa, 
2010). The development of multifunctional nanotherapeutics holds great promise for 
f lling several gaps in the current therapeutic feld. The discipline of nanotherapeu￾tics is integrating the use of several biological tools and nanobiosensors, as well as a 
broad spectrum of techniques related to the nanotechnology. Researchers can benef t 
from these phenomena because quantum effects at the nanoscale affect biological, 
chemical, physical, optical, and mechanical aspects (Wagner et al., 2006). 
The driven forces of nanotherapeutics are biological macromolecules, their struc￾tures or chemical substances, that have a xenobiotic nature. As a result of combining 
nanotechnology with various biological materials, a number of diagnostic tools, ana￾lytical tools, monitoring tools, therapeutic agents, physiotherapy applications, and 
drug delivery agents have been developed. As a result, there is enormous potential 
for studying and developing nanotherapeutics. The nanotechnology-related drug or 
therapy acts more precisely and effciently than traditional medication procedures, 
with fewer side effects. As a result, nanotherapeutics offers distinct opportunities to 
improve the safety and effcacy of traditional therapeutic methods (Freitas, 2005). 
According to a recent analysis by Grand View Research, sales of nanothera￾peutics has surged up to $16 in 2018. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the 
nanomedicine sector, which is expected to reach $ 350.8 billion by 2025, will have

a signifcant impact on the global economy (Nanomedicine Market Analysis by 
Products, (Therapeutics, Regenerative Medicine, Diagnostics), by Application, 
(Clinical Oncology, Infectious diseases), By Nanomolecule (Gold, Silver, Iron 
Oxide, Alumina), & Segment Forecasts, 2013–2025, 2017 ). 
The healthcare industry is currently working to increase productivity, increase 
access, and provide higher-quality care at a lower cost. In treating chronic and dan￾gerous diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, HIV/AIDS, and 
various cardiac problems, healthcare practitioners have faced numerous challenges. 
Infectious diseases pose an additional challenge because the standard antimicrobial 
medications used to treat them may cause unfavorable side effects and multiple drug 
resistance (Freitas, 2005).
 Target specifcity is one of the most signifcant barriers to achieving therapeu￾tic effectiveness. Nanotherapeutics has amassed substantial evidence as a ratio￾nal and encouraging tool for the controlled and selective delivery of medicine. 
Nanotherapeutics plays a crucial role in addressing a variety of challenges in the 
feld of health, because nanotechnology-based formulations improve pharmaco￾kinetic characteristics, bioavailability, and drug targeting in numerous diseases. 
Nanotherapeutics, which use molecular recognition of human biological systems, 
have practical applications in drug discovery, diagnostics, monitoring therapy, drug 
delivery, surgery, orthopedics, and gene delivery, as well as the prevention and treat￾ment of various diseases (Farokhzad and Langer, 2006). Figure 1.1illustrates the 
major biological barriers that nanoparticles (NPs) could overcome and therapeutic 
applications that beneft from NP-based nanotherapeutics (Mitchell et al., 2021). 
With the aforementioned merits, explaining the prospects of nanotherapeutics 
can be focused on the synthesis and application of innovative nanomaterials and 
nanostructures, biomimetic nanostructures that mimic biological systems to create 
synthetic goods, nanosensors and nanodevices for diagnosing diseases and patho￾gens (such as PCR-coupled fuidic devices in micro- or nanostructures), as well 
as diagnostic tools for fnding new therapeutic targets, receptors, and ligands for 
imaging, screening, therapy, and diagnostics (e.g., for cancers, cardiac abnormali￾ties, neurogenerative diseases, etc.), nanotherapeutics for regenerative medicine and 
tissue engineering systems and equipment for screening and combinatorial medica￾tion delivery, and nanotheranostics for the development of multipurpose biological 
nanostructured materials, therapies that are physically targeted and stimuli-sensitive 
nanodevices, systems and nanofuidic tools that are more effciently capable of trans￾porting fuids to the delivery site (more effective site-specifc targeting of nano￾therapeutics decreases systemic adverse effects and improves patient compliance). 
Next-generation nanotherapeutics include nanodevices and implants with sensors on 
the same chip for closed-looped drug delivery, nanobots, molecular motors, or mini￾mally invasive surgical tools that can travel throughout the body to eliminate tumors 
or viruses or even carry out gene therapy (Bawa and Bawa, 2005). 
1.2 HISTORY OF THE USE OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanomaterials have a wide range of applications, which is nothing new. As early as 
2500 BC, natural asbestos was used to strengthen a ceramic blend for ornamentals.

When illuminated from within, the legendary Lycurgus cup, designed by the Romans 
in the fourth century AD, displayed many colors both during the day and at night. 
This was the frst concrete evidence of the production and consumption of gold col￾loids. Mesopotamians introduced ceramics with silver and copper glazes in the ninth 
century AD (Reibold et al., 2006). 
The word “nanotechnology” was not coined until exactly ten years after Feyn￾man’s famous remark that “there is plenty of room at the bottom” in 1959 thrust 6 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics FIGURE 1.2 Timeline of the discovery and research history of nanoparticles.

Introduction to Nanotherapeutics 7 
nanotechnology back into the spotlight of the current scientifc community (Feynman, 
1960). The use of nanoparticles in biomedicine has grown signifcantly over time, 
and the addition of inorganic and polymeric materials has strengthened their func￾tion in drug transport and prolonged drug release (Yamamoto et al., 2014). Important 
milestones in the development of nanotherapeutics, from their discovery or invention 
to various uses, are shown in Figure 1.2from nineteenth century to the present. 
It is acceptable to assert Prof. Peter P. Speiser’s labs at the ETH in Zurich, 
Switzerland, where everything originated. In 1965, when his research f rst began, 
he focused on intensive emulsifcation to convert emulsions from micrometer-sized 
droplets to ultrafne nanodroplets. He also worked on chemically altering surfactants 
and micelles before polymerizing these systems. Furthermore, Gerd Birrenbach, 
who was a Ph.D. student, has conducted his research work on development of sera 
and vaccinations with prolonged activity by their inclusion in nanosized structures. 
Birrenbach submitted his thesis based on polymerized micelles, possible inclusion 
complexes (nanocapsules), and their usage as adjuvants after nearly four years of 
in-depth research (Birrenbach, 1973). This was the frst time the term “nanocap￾sules” was used and medicinal polymeric nanoparticles were invented. Almost until 
his retirement in 1998, Professor Speiser worked hard on his nanoparticle research, 
culminating more than 25 years of productive work in the feld (Kreuter, 2007). The 
work of Professor Speiser sparked other initiatives in the study of nanoparticulate 
systems in general. The pharmaceutical industry enthusiastically adopted his ideas 
at the start of the 1980s, and research centers were established to take those ideas 
from the laboratory benchtop to the real world. 
A few years later, it became clear that nanotherapeutics are challenging and will 
take longer than anticipated to reach the market. It took a lot of fundamental aca￾demic research to prove that these systems were clinically effective. Nevertheless, 
liposomes were introduced to consumers with the frst goods in the 1990s. Therefore, 
it is important to note that all the newly synthesized nanotherapeutics cannot be 
undergone clinical use unless there is strong evidence of effectiveness and safety 
concerns. 
However, the number of pharmaceutical items is still lower than analysts pre￾dicted. In this case, the cost of technological advancements must be borne. Following 
the initial excitement for nanotherapeutics in the 1980s, more realistic assessments 
resulted in signifcant disillusionment. Around the turn of the millennium, nano￾therapeutics offered a solution for the development of pharmaceuticals with better 
effcacy or patient convenience. With problematic novel compounds like extremely 
weakly soluble medicines, conventional formulation strategies frequently missed the 
mark. Naturally, the success of nanotechnology in many other spheres of daily life 
also acted as a trigger for its comeback. In the year 2000, a novel nanoformulation 
was introduced to the market with the production of medicinal nanocrystals (product 
Emend). The innovative product Tricor became one of the most popular pharmaceuti￾cal nanoproducts, with annual US sales of more than $1 billion. Tricor can thus be 
exemplifed as a succeeded commercially available nanoformulation and it has been 
applied as a tool for management of the productive life cycle (Müller and Keck, 2010). 
Nanotherapeutics have long been used in various research felds, but their use 
in medicine is new. Nanotherapeutics are particularly suited for interactions at that  
8 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
scale of cellular organelles because of their minuscule sizes, which relate with the 
submicrometer elements of the biological world. Nanomaterials exhibit a wide range 
of unique physicochemical characteristics that set them apart from the analogous 
bulk materials. Their outstanding performance for numerous biological applica￾tions, including as drug delivery, gene delivery, screening, tissue engineering, bio￾microelectromechanical systems (bioMEMS), nanobots, biosensors, microf uidics, 
and diagnostic tools, is mostly dictated by their size-related features. Nanomaterial￾based delivery of drugs has become the predominant therapeutic use of nanotech￾nology due to the great possibility it represents. Nanotherapeutics help to improve 
medication absorption characteristics after administration, circulation time and bio￾distribution, solubility, intracellular delivery, metabolism, excretion, and bridging 
biological membranes in addition to increasing targeted drug delivery and control 
drug release. Traditionally, nanotherapeutics have only been employed for medica￾tion delivery purposes; nevertheless, novel nanoscale frameworks have been created 
that also have a diagnostic purpose. Researchers are increasingly focused on multi￾functional nanotherapeutics, which combine therapeutic, targeting, and monitoring 
capabilities for cutting-edge drug delivery systems (Krukemeyer et al., 2015). 
1.3 DIVERSITY OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanotherapeutics can be used in the medical feld as treatments to cure, prevention, 
and diagnostic and monitoring purposes of various diseases. Nanotherapeutics use 
as mono type of nanoparticles itself to gain the respective action or nanoparticles in 
combination as bi, tri, quadra or multiparticle systems. These nanoparticles are typi￾cally used to treat diseases, as diagnostic agents, and for preventive care. As a result, 
these nanoparticles function as nanotherapeutics. Besides consuming nanoparticles 
as nanotherapeutics, there are emerging nanotherapeutic agents which have improved 
with many technologies. They have been developed with the assistance of biosens￾ing, robotic, imaging, and miniaturized nanofuidic, photothermal, and photody￾namic technologies. These technologies, in conjunction with nanotechnology and 
medicine, have opened up new avenues for the advancement of the medical f eld by 
providing the opportunity to break through bottlenecks and overcome medical f eld 
obstacles. Nonetheless, these technological combinations result in a wide range of 
nanotherapeutics. 
1.3.1 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS DELIVERY AGENTS 
Nanotherapeutics are emerging delivery agents for drugs, genes, proteins, and pep￾tides, among other things. Nanotherapeutics have piqued the interest of researchers 
due to their ability to overcome issues related to drug absorption, distribution, poor 
solubility with body fuids, metabolism, bioavailability, excretion, and elimination. 
Nanotechnology used in drug delivery has the potential to completely trans￾form how various diseases, such as cancer, infections, diabetes, neurological dis￾eases, blood diseases, and orthopedic abnormalities, are treated. These strategies 
should ideally improve medication absorption, therapeutic concentration, and 
stability in order to allow more precise drug targeting. Other characteristics of  
 
 
 
Introduction to Nanotherapeutics 9 
nanotherapeutics-based drug delivery systems include reproducibility and long-term 
release of the medication within the target tissue. The creation of nano-platforms 
with certain shape, size, and surface characteristics that are essential for biological 
interactions and the therapeutic effects that follow results from the rational design 
of nanotherapeutics. Nanotechnology-based formulations have distinct physical and 
chemical properties that are responsible for a wide range of applications in the treat￾ment of various disorders (Bhaskar et al., 2010). 
Nanoformulations, as recently reported, are critical to the healthcare industry. 
While some nano-therapeutic products on the market are intended for oral adminis￾tration, the vast majority are available for parenteral administration. A large number 
of preclinical and clinical trials are expected to result in the development of emerg￾ing nanotherapeutics for non-parenteral distribution platforms such as pulmonary, 
ophthalmic, nasal, vaginal, and cutaneous. For drug delivery systems, the decision 
of the distribution route and the related obstacles to be overcome is of special sig￾nifcance (European Commission/ETP). Over time, a number of formulations based 
on nanoparticles, such as polymeric nanotherapeutics, nanobubbles, nanogels, nano￾sponges, dendrimers, nanocapsules, liposomes, nanoemulsions, and nanostructured 
lipid-based carriers, were designed to improve the drug delivery mechanisms (Joseph 
et al., 2023). Figure 1.3illustrates the intracellular application of NPs designed using 
different material composition based on the classes and functionality of NPs, shape, 
size, and targeting ligands leading to high maneuverability and target-specif c deliv￾ery of drugs. 
Proteins and peptides have numerous biological actions in practically every dis￾cipline of medicine, and they have shown signifcant promise for treating a variety 
of diseases when used as proteins and peptide delivery agents in nanotherapeutics 
(Chen and Guan, 2011). Additionally, these have a role in the diagnosis of a num￾ber of metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), and other 
illnesses, such as diabetes and cancer (Kaspar and Reichert, 2013). Proteins and 
peptides are delivered more effciently and with controlled release when they are 
delivered using dendrimers and nanoparticles. Furthermore, they have high local￾ization specifcity, as evidenced by the unique localization signal generated on pep￾tides (Minamihata et al., 2020). The design of effective, nontoxic, easily manipulated 
vehicles that can enclose and transport new genetic material into particular cell types 
is essential for the success of gene therapy. Because nanoparticles have a high sur￾face area-to-volume ratio, it is relatively easy to add different functional groups to 
their surfaces. Some tumor cells can be found and bound using these functional 
groups. More signifcantly, aggregation is hampered by the lower size of nanopar￾ticles (Wang, Langer and Farokhzad, 2012). The selection of the right substance is 
crucial for the delivery of genes. These substances release to the target after con￾jugating with genes or medications. Lipid-based, metal-based, and polymer-based 
nanoparticles are the three groups into which nanoparticles for gene therapy are 
divided (Herrero and Medarde, 2015). For gene therapy to be successful, the nucleic 
acid needs to be encased and shielded by a delivery formulation. The hope for suc￾cessful gene therapy is increased by the nanotherapeutics. Signifcant research has 
been conducted in the last ten years to develop nonviral delivery vehicles for gene 
therapy, particularly in the treatment of cancer (Ngoc et al., 2015).

Treatment of metastatic cancer is required for cancer gene therapy to be success￾ful. The wild-type p53 functions as a tumor suppressor and is crucial to understand￾ing the biology of cancer. It has been shown that wt p53 has been transduced into 
malignant cells via a virus-mediated gene delivery method. The low quantity of trans￾duced cells and the diagnosis of infected cells, however, hampered the eff cacy (Misra 
et al., 2014). Charge reversal polymers like polyethylenimine (PEI), polylysine (PLL), 
and nanogels may be used for gene delivery in cancer treatment therapy based on 
nanotechnology. Additionally, they transport substantial molecules like deoxyribose 
nucleic acid (DNA) straight into the nucleus, greatly enhancing their cellular absorp￾tion. Such cationic polymers have been shown to have nuclear localization features 
by Zhang et al. in 2014 ( Zhang et al., 2014). Recently, a number of charge-reversal 
carriers for drug delivery and effective cancer therapy were created. Nonviral (physi￾cal and chemical approaches)-based gene delivery techniques have been evaluated to

combat immunogenic issues. For better outcomes and prognosis, medication combi￾nations can be used in the delivery platform (Mujokoro et al., 2016). 
1.3.2 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS AGENTS IN THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING 
The primary goal of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), an intervention tech￾nique, is to determine the appropriate dosage for diff cult-to-administer medica￾tions in order to improve patient’s responses and reduce harmful drug reactions. 
Nanoelectromechanical systems were created as a way to apply nanotherapeutics to 
TDM that have crucial structural components smaller than 100 nm. Their impact is 
being examined for the active release of medications and sustaining their level in 
the patient’s body. With the aid of iron nanoparticles and gold nanoshells, the use of 
this technique could be crucial in the treatment of cancer. This has been shown to be 
quite helpful in people with insulin-dependent diabetic mellitus (IDDM) (Roorda, 
2001). Nanoelectromechanical systems allow for the maintenance of drug levels in 
the body while preventing drug toxicity or overdose (Cimalla et al., 2007). 
1.3.3 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS IMPLANTS 
Since a few years ago, there has been a persistent necessity for alternative and refor￾mative medications to treat organ damage or failure. Nanotherapeutics-based implan￾tations have been used to manage pathological diseases and regulate the release of 
therapeutic medications. Drug modifcations have been carried out at the nanogram to 
microgram scale. Recently, titanium implants using nanotechnology have been devel￾oped for controlled release of various antibacterial nanoparticles like ZnO (Wang 
et al., 2021). The titanium tube demonstrated improved binding capacity of osteoblast 
and was utilized to deliver hormones and medications simultaneously for rapid bone 
healing (Gulati et al., 2023). The idea of nano-engineered implants could be used 
for epidermal, dental brain, cochineal, and cardiovascular engineering in addition to 
bones. Figure 1.4 shows various nanoimplants that are recently developed.

osteogenesis, as antimicrobials and as anticorrosive agents. (c) Brain implants in nanoscale.

12 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
1.3.4 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY 
To eradicate skin cancer, photosensitive dyes are used in photodynamic therapy 
(PDT), also known as nontoxic pigment therapy (Figure 1.5). Nontoxic medicines 
such as photosensitizers (PS) and eosin pigment are combined with light and various 
nanomaterials to treat tumor cells. Additionally, PDT has been utilized as a non￾toxic medicine with visible red light, which extends new advancements of clinical 
study in gene therapy (Correia et al., 2021). Nanotherapeutics-based PDT is typi￾cally used to treat skin ailments like sunburn, acne, and other infections of the skin. 
These nanoparticles are injected on a specifc skin area or bloodstream and triggered 
with exposure to external light, based on which portion of the body is impacted. To 
restore the tissue architecture, these particles absorb a specifc wavelength of light. 
When these particles reach the excited state, they react with oxygen, which eventu￾ally leads to the creation of stronger free radicals (Correia  et al., 2021). 
Additionally, PDT destroys the blood arteries that typically supply blood to malig￾nant tissue. Graphene oxide (GO) combined with PDT was employed as a cancer 
treatment in a study conducted, as described by Tian et al. (2013). Moreover, they 
demonstrated successful applications of mild light-triggered PDT and GO (Tian 
et al., 2013). Due to its lower toxicity and its less adverse effects than other long-term 
complementary therapies, this treatment is rising to fame. Therapies like these have a 
special ability because they are less invasive than surgical operations. Typically, it is 
regarded as more cost-effective and target-specifc than standard neoplastic therapies. 
Targeting particular affected tissues, organs, and cancer cells, gold nanoparticles have 
demonstrated some specialized therapeutic approaches (Yao, Epstein and Akey, 2006). 
The basis of photodynamic cancer therapy is the potential cytotoxic laser-generated 
atomic oxygen that kills cancer cells. Typically, cancer cells consume a greater amount 
of special photosensitive dye than healthy cells. The atomic oxygen that is generated 
inside the cancer cells is the reason behind this phenomenon. From this point for￾ward, only the cancer cells may be eliminated by laser radiation in the photodynamic 
cancer therapy. However, the residual dye molecules, which may stay in the body up 
to certain weeks or longer, migrate to the skin tissues and eyes, where they induce 
irritation and sensitivity and make the patient more susceptible to sunlight. A hydro￾phobic form of compound was encapsulated inside a porous nanoparticle in order to 
prevent this undesirable impact of the dye. For an example, some dyes are encapsu￾lated in organically modifed silica (Ormosil) nanoparticles. The dye was then found 
to have remained inside the Ormosil nanoparticle rather than spreading to other areas 
in the body (Xu et al., 2021). On the contrary extreme, the capacity to produce oxy￾gen is unaltered, and oxygen can be readily expelled through pores with a diameter 
of around 1 nm in these Ormosil nanoparticles. Furthermore, patients undergoing 
this therapy could ingest fuids containing nanorobots that are programmed to target 
viruses and cancer cells while also rebuilding the molecular machinery and internal 
structures of the cells. This tactic diminishes the consequences of the residual dye 
molecules that are mentioned before. Moreover, in one technique, healthy cells might 
be surgically inserted to speed up the processes once cancer cells were discovered 
and destroyed. A whole branch of nanosurgery may also be developed in the future to 
support photodynamic therapy (Hong, Choi and Shim, 2016).

1.3.5 NANOTHERAPEUTICS-BASED NUTRACEUTICALS 
Nanotherapeutics could make it easier to add nutrients and increase their bioavailabil￾ity, allowing animals to grow more quickly. The nanoparticles can stabilize bioactive 
substances, increasing their cellular uptake. Because of their small size, they move 
quickly through the digestive tract and make it easier for nutrients to be delivered. 
Phenolic molecules are essential micronutrients in our diet that inhibit the progres￾sion of neuro- and degenerative diseases. They are rapidly degraded by environmental 
triggers and have poor bioavailability. These phenolics function well as a delivery 
mechanism when enclosed in nanoparticles. The nanocarriers are therefore the most 
useful for delivering and protecting phenolics (Esfanjani and Jafari, 2016). 
Nanotherapeutics has enhanced nutrient delivery systems, which has led to signif￾icant advancements in food science. These nanomaterials have the ability to prevent 
food from being digested in the stomach and the mouth. Encapsulation is one method 
for ensuring effective nutrient delivery, as such preferring nanomaterials as encap￾sulants to create edible nanoparticles requires careful consideration of each one’s 
unique physicochemical and physical properties along with the molecular interac￾tions with other molecules already present in the nanoparticles (Razavi et al., 2020). 
Pharmaceutical bioactive molecules such as nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins that 
are hydrophilic have been defned in certain works as being encapsulated (Smaoui 
et al., 2021). Regarding their utilization in the food industry, synthetic biopolymers’ 
level of toxicity must also be considered. As a result of this, sophisticated hydro￾philic biopolymer molecules have been thoroughly studied. One of the most widely 
utilized biopolymers for medication delivery and encapsulating bioactive compo￾nents is polylactic acid (PLA). For instance, chitosan and chitosan-grafted PLA were 
employed by Di Martino et al. (2015) as a matrix for the entrapment of bovine serum

albumin (BSA) in a nanoscale structure that was made using the polyelectrolyte 
complexation process and dextran sulfate (Valente  et al., 2013). 
1.3.6 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
Recent advances in biological imaging technology have transformed them into a 
powerful tool for pathological condition progression and diagnosis. It enables us to 
easily detect and quantify the cells that cause various types of disorders (Han and 
Zhou, 2016; Lee et al., 2016). The imaging system has undergone signif cant prog￾ress in recent years. When compared to conventional imaging techniques, the NPs 
coupled with radiolabeling produce effective results. To eliminate nonspecif c cell 
attachment, NPs must have a very precise nature to pinpoint the appropriate region 
for image-based diagnosis and treatments. 
Nanotherapeutics participate in a variety of imaging modalities, such as mag￾netic resonance imaging and ultrasonography, and are able to provide superior 
results than conventional imaging systems (Leng et al., 2015). Quantum dots 
(QDs), which possess the quantum energy to emit light, are one of the signif￾cant applications of NPs. They have excellent applicability in the f eld of more 
precise techniques to tumor elimination. In magnetic resonance imaging, QD 
was employed, and it was discovered that they are effective at exhibiting tumor￾affected regions (Su et al., 2017). Another study discovered that when exposed 
to UV light, selenide cadmium enhanced the illumination. These illumination 
properties facilitate the use of selenide cadmium as imaging agents ( Zhu et al., 
2017 ). 
Particles such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) have been recognized as excel￾lent polymers due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. According to one 
study, 5-ethylamino-9-diethylaminobenzo(a)henothiazinium (EtNBS) capsuled 
with PLGA exhibited reducing rates in side effects. Throughout this study, NPs 
entrapment was used to overcome the toxicity effects and minimal limitations. 
Surprisingly, they discovered that using EtNBS and poly(lactic-co -glycolic acid) 
as encapsulating materials signifcantly reduced toxicity. As a result, these methods 
aid in reducing the toxicity of cancer cell therapy (Hung et al., 2016; Klein et al., 
2012 ). 
1.3.7 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS BIOSENSORS 
A biosensor is an electrical device that combines a transducer and a bioconjugation 
component to evaluate or target various biological desires ( Baranwal et al., 2018; 
Mahato et al., 2018). Organs, antibodies, enzymes, receptors, and nucleic acids 
are only a few examples of the biological constituents that biosensor devices are 
responsive to as analytical targets (Holzinger, Goff and Cosnier, 2014). The use of 
biosensor devices is prevalent in the feld of medical diagnostics for rapid analy￾sis of various disorders and microbiological identifcations. With the adoption of 
conducting NPs such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), 
and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), which are recognized as appropriate substrates, 
material technology has developed and strengthened innovative biosensors (Martin  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Introduction to Nanotherapeutics 15 
et al., 2014). These are useful for biosensor equipment with fast dynamic response 
(Chen et al., 2011). Figure 1.6illustrates the various components of a nanobiosensor 
with their working principle. 
Systems for nucleic acid hybridization or biosensors based on gold nanoparticles 
are demonstrated to have greater sensitivity. Tiny magnetic nanoparticles (<100 
nm) have more surface area and silt at slower rates, which enhance tissue diffu￾sion. As a result, they continue to circulate through the capillaries of tissues and 
organs, preventing vascular embolism following injection. Both magnetic and gold 
nanoparticles are being used in several immunological chromatographic screenings 
and lateral circulation assays on the Ebola virus (Illescas et al., 2017). However, 
due to their highly charged contact area and decreased precipitation rate, NPs with 
magnetic characteristics and a size of <100 nm are having a signifcant impact on 
biosensors (Wang et al., 2010). According to Arruebo et al. (2007), these magnetic 
NPs-based nanotherapeutics are benefcial for tissue diffusion. 
Better biosensors can be designed using the magnetic NPs’ circulation phenom￾enon and capillary system. Researchers have reported on the use of magnetic and 
AuNPs in combination with immunological chromatography tests to detect the 
Ebola virus. Due to the use of sensitive colloidal gold strips, they discovered that 
this combination was far more effective than the standard traditional process (Saha 
et al., 2016). In parallel, other analytical investigations for the improvement of biosen￾sor technologies have made use of these NPs’ enzymatic characteristics to quantify 
real sample analysis to an exceptional degree and to ascertain their high sensitiv￾ity in comparison to conventional processes (Ganguly et al., 2017). Recent stud￾ies have shown the value of nanoport technology in the development of analytical 
detecting devices that convert nucleic acids into electric impulses and subsequently 
match those signals with traditional databases to enable speedy on-the-spot diagno￾sis ( Zheng et al., 2005). Additionally, leveraging these advancements, a variety of 
sensor chips have been created to identify biomarkers for diseases like cancer, HIV, 
Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s ( Zhang et al., 2017). A key factor in the development 
of contemporary diagnostic gadgets is the use of electrochemical processes based on 
nanobiosensors (Wang et al., 2013). 
A very sophisticated biosensor is using the enzymatic function of nanoparticles to 
achieve a high level of sensitivity. A cutting-edge technique called multicolor optical 
coding involves designing quantum dots of various sizes on tiny beads that can emit 
light at various frequencies that can be applied to microarray technology. For the 
examination of nucleic acids, nanopore technology turns the length of the nucleo￾tides through an electronic signature that can be quickly correlated with the signa￾ture already contained in the database. Utilizing only a drop of blood, a sensor chip 
test can identify disease-related biomarkers in a pathological condition like cancer. 
The use of nanotechnology and nanotherapeutics in instrumentation is noteworthy. 
A pencil-sized arthroscope that is utilized in minimally invasive surgical procedures 
is based on nanotechnology. The general rule in surgery is that the minimum the 
incision, the speedier and greater the recovery. 
A key area of nanodiagnostics that is still under development is nanoelectrochem￾ical based biosensors. Those sensors can be employed to create sophisticated devices 
and guarantee precise, digital outcomes. The electrochemical-based biosensor is 16 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics

Introduction to Nanotherapeutics 17 
most frequently used for the determination of blood glucose concentration. The best 
material for such a gadget is a multi-walled carbon nanotube since it uses less blood. 
Furthermore, using just a drop of peripheral blood over 5 minutes, nanowires can 
also be utilized to diagnose tumors. One specifc sort of targeted marker protein is 
primed to be detected by each nanowire (Kumar et al., 2019). The expenses for the 
diagnosis of tumors can be reduced and those remained funds can be allocated for 
other medical needs by facilitating such simple techniques to detect tumors with 
aid of the nanotherapeutic approaches. Moreover, the sensitivity is a 1,000-folds of 
magnitude better in comparison to other diagnostic procedures. 
Oncology treatment has become more personalized because of nanotherapeutic￾based approaches, enabling each patient to receive a specifc diagnosis and treatment 
plan. Different genetic tests that may be utilized for screening, recognizing, and 
diagnosing the target body part affected by cancer in an individual have been thor￾oughly studied (Kumar et al., 2019 Wang et al., 2015). 
1.3.8 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS BLOOD PURIFICATION AGENTS 
Blood is composed of a diverse range of cells, proteins, and biological components 
that can be separated using the traditional magnetic-driven cell separation approach 
(Kang et al., 2014). Previous studies have demonstrated the removal of several haz￾ardous elements from biological fuid, including microorganisms, toxins, and some 
pretentious material, with the aid of a circuit architecture resembling the dialysis 
system (Lunardi et al., 2009). Diffusion and ultrafltration via a semipermeable 
membrane are the basis of the dialysis technique (Lunardi et al., 2009). Additionally, 
covalently attaching various antibodies, protein-specifc substances, and synthetic 
chemicals to these nanoparticles over their exterior surfaces improved blood purif￾cation via a microfuidic device (Schumacher et al., 2013). The magnetically reactive 
NPs attached to distinct functional groups have the ability to bind with a particu￾lar item present in body fuids and secretions like the blood circulation. Thereafter, 
when this fuid was exposed to an external magnetic feld, NPs began to accumulate 
at the magnet’s pole, resulting in the way different blood components were sepa￾rated. In recent research, using magnetic NPs-based purifcation by focusing on a 
specifc molecule made the purifcation stage for blood easier (Lee et al., 2013). 
Magnetically triggered cell classifcation or Dynabeads can be used to separate 
the proteins and cells from a heterogeneous mixture like blood. These materials 
have been successfully shown to remove a variety of hazardous substances from 
blood, including toxins, infections, and specifc proteins with the aid of a circuit 
that is similar to the machinery used for the process of dialysis. The fundamental 
aspect of dialysis is the solute diffusion or ultrafltration through semipermeable 
membranes. Nevertheless, the purifcation method based on nanoparticles targets 
certain molecules. Iron oxide or carbon-coated metal nanoparticles that are f c￾titious are employed for this. Iron exhibits both ferromagnetic or supermagnetic 
properties. On their interfaces, such nanoparticles can be covalently coupled to 
various proteins, antibodies, antibiotics, or synthetic compounds. In the blood or 
another intricate body fuid, such functionalized magnetic nanoparticles link with 
the target substance. The fuid is subsequently exposed to an appropriate external  
 
 
 
 
18 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
magnetic feld, permitting all of the magnetic nanoparticles to accumulate close 
to the magnetic pole. Particles and impurities from blood or other heterogeneous 
bodily fuids can be easily isolated in this method. Nanoparticles have a higher 
loading capacity, are more accessible, have improved selectivity, and diffuse faster 
than hemoperfusion, a blood purifcation technology that requires far fewer dos￾age volumes. This is a unique pharmaceutical effort to treat systemic infections by 
directly eliminating the bacteria that cause them in conditions like sepsis. It could 
also drive the elimination of cytokines and endotoxins that promote inf ammation 
and aids in the simplifcation of laborious conventional procedures like dialysis. 
This technique is still being developed, despite having many advantages (Kumar 
 et al., 2019 ). 
1.3.9 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR TISSUE ENGINEERING 
Tissue engineering has shown to be a very effective application of nanotherapeu￾tics based on nanotechnology. It has the ability to fully upgrade current treatments, 
including organ transplants, grafts, and artifcial implants, among others. Fabrication 
of tissue engineering is based on nanoparticles (grapheme, carbon nanotubes, 
molybdenum disulf de, and tungsten disulf de). Additionally, it effectively enhances 
the compression and fexion of polymeric nanocomposites, which are essential fea￾tures of bones. As a result, these kinds of nanocomposites can be employed to cre￾ate incredibly thin bone implants. The “Flesh welder” method, which is based on 
nanotechnology, can be used to join the pieces of fesh together. By combining an 
infrared laser reaction with a suspension of gold-coated nanoshells, it was possible 
to combine two portions of chicken fesh into one (Gobin et al., 2005). In accident 
cases, this precise method can be used to cauterize the tissue and rejoin major veins 
that have been damaged during surgery. Nano-nephrology is a novel concept that has 
recently been used. This study focuses on the use of nanotechnology in the diagnosis 
and treatment of kidney disease. The ultimate goal of this branch is to develop a 
nanoscale artifcial kidney to avoid the problems associated with transplant rejection 
( Sinha et al ., 2022 ). 
1.3.10 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS NANOROBOTS 
The diseased state can be treated at the submicroscopic level using molecular 
mechanical assembly based on nanotherapeutics (Prasad et al., 2018). These mechan￾ical systems at the nanoscale are known as nanorobots. They can recognize and f x 
damage when they are introduced into the body. The feld of nanorobotics focuses on 
creating and building nanorobots made of silicon and carbon nanotubes with a size 
range of 0.1–10 m. The development of such robots will beneft from future develop￾ments in nanomedicine. K. Eric Drexler proposed a cell repair device that would 
stop cells from aging. However, Freitas conducted the initial scientifc and technical 
research of therapeutic nanorobots (Jones, 2005). The computer systems are able 
to communicate with the nervous system owing to the neuro-electronic interface 
clearance, including nanodevices. The computer systems will be able to link to and 
operate the nervous system using a refutable energy that is supplied by an external  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Introduction to Nanotherapeutics 19 
sonic, chemical, or magnetic source. Self-suffcient nanodevices have been created 
that run on biofuid glucose. The drawbacks of this technique include overheating, 
leakage, or electrostatic discharge from the source of electricity. Because electri￾cal circuits are located in the nervous system, their structure is of vital importance 
( Kumar et al ., 2019 ). 
Nanorobotic technology has effectively exploited the study of microorganisms 
as a launching pad for the early development of robotic capabilities. Nanorobots 
can be designed and functionalized for many diseases, however diff culties with 
delivery and propulsion restrict their usage within the bloodstream. Nanorobots 
can be propelled effectively when conjugated with magnetotactic bacteria like 
Magnetococcus, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, or Magnetospirillum mag￾neticum. Furthermore, nanorobots can also be employed in the medicinal f eld as 
phagocytic entities. “Nanobivores” is the term coined to these nanorobots. The outer 
walls of these robots might be assembled with a vast number of programmable 
receptors for antigens or diseases, ranging from HIV to Escherichia coli ( Saadeh 
and Vyas, 2014). 
Dentistry is one industry where nanorobots can be used both routinely and specif￾ically. Nanorobots have the potential to improve patient care by being used in almost 
every aspect of dental hygiene and therapy. Their numerous applications range from 
basic hygiene to hypersensitivity, cosmetological agents, dental bleaching, and even 
orthodontics. The preliminary analgesia is one application for nanorobots in dentistry, 
which a dentist might administer at the beginning of a consultation. Furthermore, 
the patient is given an oral suspension consisting of millions of nanorobots. These 
nanorobots are suffciently tiny to ft within the gingival sulcus and f nally pass via 
tooth tubules that are the dimension of micrometers to get to the pulp. They might be 
controlled from a central location, enabling the stimulation of bioactivity in targeted 
locations proximal to the dentist’s point of care (Saadeh and Vyas, 2014). 
1.3.11 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS NANOMOTORS 
Nanolocomotion, which can be described as the mechanism that allows a nanoscale 
item to move ahead through an anisotropic energy and is typically assisted by an 
asymmetric architecture, is how nanomotors demonstrate autonomous self-propulsion. 
Usually, catalysis, biosensing, and site-specifc administering medication can be 
accomplished with nanomotors. The incapability to accomplish motion at a nontoxic 
and neutral pH as well as the lack of biocompatibility seem to be the main issues 
with existing micro- and nanomotor platforms, which restrict their potential for use 
in biological applications (Munaweera et al., 2016). 
In this instance, mesoporous silica nanomotors in gold/palladium-coated mag￾nesium nanoparticles have been designed by Munaweera et al. to generate hydro￾gen gas and carry out nanolocomotion together in neutral pH environment. The 
outcomes of this research, which used aspirin as a standard medicine, demonstrate 
that the constructed nanomotor systems offer suitable delivery platforms for the 
conservation of fuel and payload. High biocompatibility capabilities are present 
in this concept, and it can store payloads or fuel wherever desired (Munaweera
 et al., 2016 ).

Nanotherapeutics—An 2 Emerging Topic in 
Health Sciences 
2.1 EVOLUTION AND CURRENT STATUS OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanotherapeutics have become the pillars of numerous successful interventions in 
the feld of health science. They have a few decades of history starting with scanning 
tunnel microscopes (STM) (Yamamoto et al., 2014). Although nanotherapeutics is 
a growing feld of study, it has already achieved a number of medical milestones. 
The frst nanotechnological approach in the 1950s by Richard P. Feynman, who was 
a Nobel laureate, is considered as the constitutive force to the establishment of the 
nanotherapeutics (Feynman, 1960). The book Unbounding the Future, by K. Eric 
Drexler, Chris Peterson, and Gayle Pergamit, discusses the potential applications of 
“nanobots” or “assemblers” in medicine. It was the frst time the interfaces of nano￾technology and medicine were combined. The word “nanomedicine” which is also 
related to nanotherapeutics was allegedly frst used in the book The Nanotechnology 
Revolution, which was released in 1991 (Drexler, Peterson and Pergamit, 1991). 
In addition, the book Nanomedicine by Robert A. Freitas, which was released in 
1999, has originated the word “Nanomedicine,” which has subsequently been used 
in technical literature. Feynman and Drexler’s visions were that nanoscale robots 
can patrol the body, neutralize disease foci, and detect and repair organs and cells 
with impaired function. Without this paradigm shift of vision, it is still decades 
away where nanomedicine is primarily focused on research into the potential for 
controlling and manipulating cell processes, such as by using genetically modif ed 
organisms (Freitas, 1999). 
Paul Ehrlich tried to create “magic bullets” at the start of the twentieth century 
that contained medications that could be used to target diseases and eliminate all 
pathogenic agents with just one treatment (Kreuter, 2007). He created Salvarsan, 
which is said to be the frst precisely acting treatment of its kind and the birth of che￾motherapy. The development of ever-more complex “magic bullets” was made fea￾sible by the information obtained over the course of the twentieth century about cells 
and their components, intra- and intercellular activities, and cell communication, as 
well as advancements in biochemistry and biotechnology. Peter Paul Speiser created 
the frst nanoparticles that can be used for targeted medicinal therapies at the end of 
the 1960s. The monoclonal antibodies were successfully produced by Georges Jean 
Franz Köhler and César Milstein in the 1970s (Köhler and Milstein, 1975). Since 
then, there had been a lot of investigation into the potential synthesis, applications, 
and physicochemical functionalization of a variety of nanotechnology-based carrier 
systems. Nanoparticles were originally modifed at the beginning of the 1990s to

26 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
carry DNA fragments and genes, and they were then sluiced into cells with the help 
of antibodies (Kateb and Heiss, 2014). 
In the late twentieth century, the term “nanotherapeutics” frst appeared; neverthe￾less, the f rst scientifc publications that used this term emerged in 2000, claims the 
Science Citation Index (Institute for Scientifc Information, Thompson, Philadelphia, 
PA). Since research programs, symposiums, and publications have been concentrat￾ing on nanotherapeutics for an array of years, it is apparent that this area of study is 
more than just a conceptual trend despite the diffculty in defning it precisely given 
its blurred borders encompassed by biotechnology and microsystems technological 
advances (Royal Society & Royal Academy of Engineering, 2004). 
The rise in “nanotherapeutics” research over the past ten years is being trans￾lated into signifcant commercialization activities on a global scale. Governmental 
organizations are proposing funding programs to assist this research in response to 
these changes, and several scientifc administrations have commissioned roadmaps 
and foresight studies to examine the marketable and technological aspects of this 
expanding industry. Based on a comparison of the amount of journal publications 
in nanomedicine and nanotechnology (approximately 34,300 papers during 2004), 
nanotherapeutics currently account for around 4% of all research on nanotechnol￾ogy carried out globally. According to a study of the geographical distribution 
of nanotherapeutics research, the largest research communities are in the Boston 
area, San Francisco, Tokyo, Berlin, and South-east England. Throughout the last 
ten years, the frst nanotherapeutic agents have entered the market. According to 
the active patenting activity of US scientists and enterprises, the United States 
has a more advanced commercialization status than other nations (Anselmo and 
Mitragotri, 2016). 
The majority of the time, nanotechnology in medicine serves as an enabler. However, 
its greatest power comes by its own adaptability. Numerous pharmaceutical products 
and medical equipment could beneft from the revolutionary features that nanotech￾nology might experience. Most of the time, it only serves as a useful element of a 
pharmaceutical agent. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the interest of 
pharmaceutical and medical device industries has gradually increased; the last few 
decades have seen an upsurge in patent activities in particular (Dullaart, Bock and 
Zweck, 2006). 
Anselmo and Mitragotri (2016 ) described the clinical landscape of nanothera￾peutics, which included more than 25 nanotechnological approaches approved 
by the FDA and 45 nanotherapeutic products that were undergoing clinical stud￾ies. Fifty nanotherapeutic formulations were available for patient care in 2019 
(Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2019). In addition, 90 clinical trials for nanomedicines 
used 15 new nanotechnologies (Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2019). In the context of 
the most recent achievement, the generation of lipid nanoparticles (NPs) for vac￾cine distribution in the aftermath of COVID-19 (Shin et al., 2020; Khurana et al., 
2021) has provided nanotherapeutics the boost they required to demonstrate their 
higher potential. 
The biggest barrier to commercialization of nanotherapeutics is the caution with 
which frms are still investing in the research of nanotherapeutics. The implemen￾tation of unique medical regulations tailored to nanotechnology that can add new  
 
 
Nanotherapeutics 27 
requirements to the licensing procedure for nanotherapeutics also hinders the com￾mercialization of these products. For businesses preparing to invest in nanotherapeu￾tics, an early resolution of this matter is crucial. Despite the commercial operations, 
nanotherapeutics are still a technological feld with unmet scientifc needs. Since the 
chemistry of nanosized molecules is still poorly understood, it is expensive to pro￾duce nanomaterials like dendrimers or pharmaceutical-grade liposomes. 
Hence there is an ongoing debate among regulators, industry, and scientists about 
whether or not new laws are required to take into consideration the unique phar￾macokinetic characteristics of nanotherapeutics. These qualitative discussions will 
enable the entry of nanotherapeutics from the benchtop of the laboratory to the real 
world (Dullaart, Bock and Zweck, 2006). 
2.2 FORMULATION OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanotechnology and nanotherapeutics have undergone an entire revolution 
recently. From 1980, there has occurred a signifcant growth in the number of 
authorized nano-based therapeutic formulations. These innovative nano-based 
platforms may function as therapeutic substances in their own proper capacity or 
serve as vehicles for delivering various active pharmacological drugs to specif c 
regions of the body. Nanocrystals, micelles, liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, 
nanoemulsions, PEGylated polymeric nanodrugs, bioconjugates, other polymers, 
dendrimers, protein-based nanoparticles, organic nanoparticles, and metal-based 
nanoparticles are currently commercialized nanoformulations. In order to develop 
these nanostructures, a number of obstacles must be dealt with. Some critical 
problems in developing of nanotherapeutics include ethical issues, market share, 
the likelihood of market abandonment, price, and commercialization. Only a few 
of the aforementioned nanoformulations received marketing approval following 
all ethical and biological tests and fulflling investors about future prof tability 
( Ahmed et al ., 2022 ). 
Despite the fact that different nanocarriers are utilized in the fabrication of antitu￾mor nano-therapeutics, the majority of these compounds depend on two basic funda￾mental principles. They include increasing tumor tissue concentration by exploiting 
the high penetrating ability of the tumor and retention impact (EPR) for enhanced 
effcacy; minimizing the clearance of nanotherapeutic agent by the reticuloendothe￾lial system in the human body; and improving the amount present in plasma, thus 
decreasing the intake of nanotherapeutic agent by regular tissues and decreasing 
adverse reactions, while strengthening nanotherapeutic agent has effcacy in tumor 
EPR to increase therapeutic effect. Despite the fact that these two concepts have 
been consistently validated in animal tumor models, the majority of antitumor nano￾therapeutic drugs did not increase effectiveness in clinical trials, leading to failure 
( Colombo et al ., 2018 ). 
Furthermore, nanotherapeutic formulations ought to be drug- and nanocarrier￾specifc in the design of formulation. To fully comprehend the unique effectiveness 
and security of nanotherapeutic agents, it is vital to thoroughly examine their phar￾macokinetic profles, which may boost the success percentage of clinical modif ca￾tion in preclinical laboratory animal models. Figure 2.1shows generalization of a

formulation model allows clustering of existing nanomedicine products by principle 
of action, where each group identifed by a limited number of critical quality attri￾butes (CQA) is related to the primary seminal invention principles (Colombo et al., 
2018 ). 
A number of researchers have offered novel suggestions or recommendations for the 
current research interests in nanotherapeutics formulation and design. Those sugges￾tions and recommendations can be summarized as follows: assess the special chemi￾cal and physical characteristics, pharmacokinetic profles, and possible drawbacks of 
each medication, and their associated effcacy and toxic characteristics, aim design￾ing of nanoformulations, investigate the properties of nanocarrier circulation in the 
human body along with how to adjust medications to target various tissues to establish 
safety and effectiveness. They have highlighted that the transport of nanotherapeutic 
drugs to infected target tissues is however not a suffcient prerequisite, and f nally 
to increase their curative impact. Moreover, nanotherapeutic agents must distribute 
medications to multiple targeted tissues in the pathological tissue microenvironment. 
2.3 PHARMACOKINETICS OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
The main aim of nanotherapeutics is the development of next-generation medicines 
with improved safety, bioavailability, pharmacological activity, biocompatibility, 
and biological adherence while reducing the dosage, clearance, and metabolism  
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics 29 
(Sahoo, Parveen and Panda, 2007). Advanced drug pharmacology engineering has 
been made possible by nanoscale formulations, which have improved release of ther￾apeutics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and duration of drug 
residence (Suk et al., 2016). PEGylation of nanotherapeutics to extend their duration 
of circulation and to postpone immune identifcation and metabolism has strongly 
mediated these advancements (Suk et al., 2016). 
Improved modeling and screening of nanotechnology platforms, targeting to 
intracellular compartments, sensor-based drug release, as well as the utilization of 
nanotechnology toward a wider range of therapeutic categories, along with drug 
release that are based on sensors and focusing to intracellular compartments are 
some of the nanotherapeutic advancements (Sindhwani and Chan, 2021). Current 
developments demonstrated the wide-ranging effects of nanomaterials on medica￾tion absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as the signif cance of 
regulatory frameworks ( Zolnik and Sadrieh, 2009). 
In order to change the pharmacology of the nanotherapeutics being transported, 
nanotherapeutics use the properties of various nanomaterials. This results in altera￾tions in the biological accumulation of nanotherapeutics (absorption, distribution, 
cellular uptake, metabolism, and elimination), and fnally, their pharmacological 
effect. It offers a chance to improve the pharmacological actions of nanotherapeu￾tics, especially which rely on hepatic activity. Future use of nanotherapeutics in 
humans will depend on the gathering of evidences regarding the clearance and safety 
of nanotherapeutics, which must be weighed against the toxicity of nanoparticles. 
2.3.1 PHARMACOKINETIC MECHANISMS OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
There are major mechanisms of pharmacokinetics which are responsible for the 
pharmacological action of the nanotherapeutics. They can be categorized as absorp￾tion, distribution, cellular uptake, clearance, and elimination (Figure 2.2). 
Absorption of Nanotherapeutics 
When taken orally, absorption takes place through the gastrointestinal tract and 
stomach. Therapeutics administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally are 
absorbed through the circulation, whereas those administered intravenously are 
injected directly into the systemic circulation. The percentage of a nanotherapeutic 
that reaches the systemic circulation is known as bioavailability; therefore, phar￾maceuticals administered intravenously will have a 100% bioavailability. When 
administered using various injection methods (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra￾peritoneal, intravenous, or intradermal), the kinetics of lipid NPs carrying mRNA 
(Pardi et al., 2015) resulted in quick systemic absorption and diffusion. One sig￾nifcant distinction was that intravenous injections had a Cmax (peak concentration) 
that was ten times higher than that of all other injection techniques, although Tmax 
(time to reach the peak concentration) occurred simultaneously for all delivery tech￾niques. The shortest half-life was seen with intravenous injections, which were two￾fold shorter than subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intramuscular injections and 
threefold shorter than intradermal and intramuscular injections (Pardi et al., 2015).

Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo techniques, the assessing of the absorption by 
the oral route of nanotherapeutics demonstrate the signifcance of using different 
techniques to estimate the bioavailability percentage throughout the early stages of 
nanotherapeutics research (Faria et al., 2018). Peyer’s patches or accumulated lym￾phoid nodules, M cells, and enterocytes all aid in the absorption of nanotherapeutics 
that are administered via the oral route into the gastrointestinal tract (Schimpel 
et al., 2014). Although lymphatic drainage patches have been investigated for 
immune modulation strategies and have been demonstrated to enhance the uptake of 
a variety of nanomaterials that are in different dimensions from 50 nm to 200 m, the 
absorption via lymphatics does not necessarily translate to enhanced bioavailabil￾ity (Borges et al., 2006). Intestinal enterocytes may uptake an additional restricted 
range of nanostructures (50–500 nm), along with uptake rising with decreases in NP 
dimensions (Yao, McClements and Xiao, 2015). 
In-depth analyses of enterocyte uptake for dendrimers ( Kitchens et al ., 2007 ), solid 
lipid nanoparticles (SLN), organics nanoparticles ( Behrens et al ., 2002 ; Coyuco 
et al ., 2011 ), metal nanoparticles all have been conducted using Caco-2 cells ( Chai et al.,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics 31 
2016 ). To observe and analyze the dynamics of NP transfer, Caco-2 cells and 
co-cultures of Caco-2/HT29-MTX (enterocyte, mucus-secreting goblet, and M cells) 
are used ( Schimpel et al ., 2014 ). The utilization of inhibitors of endocytosis have 
shown that the uptake of metal nanoparticles, dendrimers, and organics NPs can be 
occurred through various particular and nonspecifc methods, such as micropinocy￾tosis and clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis ( Kitchens et al ., 2007 ; Chai 
et al., 2016 ). 
These transcytosis and endocytosis routes are transport mechanisms that occur 
actively in the liver as well as in the GI tract, where they are used to remove sys￾temically circulating nanomaterials directly. Several researches have used explants 
in the small intestine to examine the taking up of NPs. Those explants are more 
analogous toward the in vivo environment than in vitro cell cultures, allowing for 
easier and more fexible uptake studies (Kothari and Rajagopalan, 2019). By employ￾ing explants, it revealed that inhibitors of macropinocytosis, clathrin- and caveolin￾mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis inhibited the nonspecifc uptake of 
metal quantum dots (QDs) into small intestine explants (Hunt et al., 2020). By cover￾ing the surfaces of QDs with different polymers, receptor-specifc endocytosis routes 
were made easier. The results of determination of the in vivo bioavailability of typi￾cal and polymer-coated QDs were consistent with those of the explant investigations 
( Hunt et al ., 2020 ). 
These investigations demonstrate that a variety of transporters actively take up 
nanoparticles rather than absorbing them passively. Usually, nanotherapeutics that 
are xenobiotic in their nature largely rely on active transport channels, especially the 
superfamilies of membrane transporters known as solute carriers (SLC) and solute 
carrier organic anions (SLCO). This pathway is not specifc to nanomaterials with 
medicines (Döring and Petzinger, 2014). 
It has been widely researched how to target certain nutrient-transporting vehicles 
(SLC5A6, SCL10A2, and SLC22A5) using surface coatings, selective dendrimers, 
and nanotherapeutic formulations to increase the oral bioavailability of distribution 
nanotherapeutic medication systems (Kou et al., 2018). The bioavailability of insu￾lins and heparin that are administered orally has been enhanced by using biotin, 
tetra DOCA, deoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, and l-carnitine (Lee et al., 2001; 
Lee et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006). Several studies have revealed that the medication 
and the nanomaterials both are quickly transported to the liver and processed after 
ingestion. This clearly illustrates how these nanotherapeutic drug delivery systems 
may be used to specifcally target hepatic drug receptors. 
Interest in the way that gut microbial fora effects on the metabolism of xenobiotic 
agents (including NPs) has recently grown. Through azo reduction, amide genera￾tion, hydrolysis, nitro reduction, acetylation, deamination, sulfoxide/oxide reduc￾tion, and thiazide ring formation, microbiota aid in metabolism of nanotherapeutics 
(Jourova, Anzenbacher and Anzenbacherova, 2016). AgNP degradation has been 
extensively studied and is infuenced by the microbiome and gastric pH (Bi et al., 
2020). Nanotherapeutics, the intestinal microbiota, and the mucus secreted by epithe￾lia all have intricated and multidirectional connections. NPs cause a rise in mucosal 
secretions, which restricts their ability to interact with cell membranes and prevents 
uptake. It has been reported that AgNPs may also have an immediate effect on the  
 
 
32 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
microbiome’s composition, reducing populations of the microorganisms: Firmicutes 
and Lactobacillus (Bi et al., 2020). Figure 2.3 exhibits the cellular mechanisms of the 
absorption of nanotherapeutics which is administered via parenteral route. 
Distribution of Nanotherapeutics 
Distribution is the ratio of the steady-state concentration of a nanotherapeutic agent 
in the region where the drug is activated to the concentration of the circulation or 
the accumulation inside peripheral compartments. After the impacts of absorption, 
bioavailability, and frst pass metabolism, the infuence of drug transportation via the 
circulatory system is typically observed (Doogue and Polasek, 2013). 
Nanotherapeutics usually face some issues with the distribution. Regardless of 
their composition, typical metal-based or uncoated nanoparticles exhibit extremely 
poor distribution and bioavailability since they are typically eliminated from the 
bloodstream after 10 minutes of systemic injection (Yoo, Chambers and Mitragotri, 
2010; Suk et al., 2016). The liver is the site of most of this rapid accumulation and 
uptake takes place which is caused by the liver’s extraordinary capacity for the f rst 
pass metabolism of xenobiotics, such as nanotherapeutics, and by the mononuclear 
phagocytic system (MPS). This absorption into the liver has been limited, and also 
MPS and frst pass metabolism have been bypassed. Although NP hepatic absorption

Nanotherapeutics 33 
and MPS are covered within the section on cellular uptake of nanotherapeutics, it 
is crucial to consider about the function of the cardiovascular system in supporting 
these clearance routes. 
The circulating proteins include serum albumin, glycoproteins, complement, lipo￾proteins, coagulants, and immunoglobulins which can be rapidly bound to NPs 
Madathiparambil Visalakshan et al. (2020). As soon as entering those nanotherapeu￾tics into body which are administered to the circulatory system, proteins bound to NPs 
and then soft and hard protein coronas made up of 10–1,000 proteins begin to form 
as a result of this phenomenon (Ke et al., 2017). Considering their constitutes, mor￾phologies, and surface chemistry, those proteins can bind to NPs in a wide variety of 
ways, with alterations in hard and soft protein coronas controlling the duration taken 
for the circulation along with a differential cellular uptake (García-Álvarez et al., 
2018; Richtering, Alberg and Zentel, 2020). A crucial tactic for targeted drug admin￾istration is to conceal NPs from protein corona formation (Oh et al., 2018; Alberg 
et al., 2020). One technique used to prevent MPS uptake is the prefabricated serum 
albumin attachment to NPs (Pitek et al., 2016). Several researches have focused their 
attention on reduction of MPS uptake in order to enhance the uptake of nanothera￾peutics in order to obtain an effective distribution of nanotherapeutics. 
Cellular Uptake of Nanotherapeutics 
Mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) plays a crucial role in cellular uptake of 
nanotherapeutics. Monocytes and macrophages from the spleen and lymph, as well 
as Kupffer cells (KCs) in the liver, make up the MPS. The scavenger endothelial 
cells located in the liver, or scavenger endothelial cells in the liver (LSECs), repre￾sent the second hurdle that NPs should get past to enter the circulatory system after 
encompassing the KCs (Poon et al., 2019). After optimization or attachment by the 
complement system, MPS cell types and LSECs are predominantly responsible for 
NP absorption; nevertheless, other passive and active transporting vehicles also con￾tribute to NP clearance. Through nanopores in the LSECs known as fenestrations 
(below 120 nm), NPs are passively cleared from the circulation. Once in the space 
of Disse, they can be picked up by hepatocytes and guided toward the bile (Cogger, 
Hunt and Le Couteur, 2020). 
Although KCs play a signifcant role in NP phagocytosis (Tsoi et al., 2016), 
those KCs also carry out a variety of other tasks, some of which may have an 
impact on nanotherapeutics. Through the inhibition of T regulatory cells and 
activation of IL-10 production, they contribute to the regulation of tolerogenic 
processes (Breous et al., 2009). Dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer cells, and 
natural killer T cells can all communicate with one another more easily, thanks 
to KCs (Nguyen-Lefebvre and Horuzsko, 2015). As a result of the C3 complement 
products’ high activation of KCs, phagocytosis is triggered and NP absorption is 
increased (Nguyen-Lefebvre and Horuzsko, 2015). On the other hand, NP absorp￾tion by macrophages, especially KCs, is decreased by CD47-mediated immune 
suppression (Yong et al., 2017).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
Protein coronas that encase NPs frequently contain the portions of C3a and C3b. 
The initial binding of immunoglobulin attaching to nanomaterials, especially IgG, 
is necessary for the binding of C3a and C3b to NPs. The epitope for NP attachment 
has not yet been found, however IgG served as a scaffold for C3b binding (Vu et al., 
2019). Not surprisingly, IgG is utilized as a control in fow cytometry for its inher￾ent ability to nonspecifcally bind to a variety of diseases, surfaces, antigens, and 
proteins (Vu et al., 2019) IgG can bind to liposomes, superparamagnetic iron oxide 
NPs (SPIONs), FeNPs, and AuNPs. The presence of f bronectin or Fc on NPs helps 
macrophages to identify them as well (Neuberger et al., 2005). Additionally, NP 
clearance is aided by the opsonin-independent scavenger receptors on macrophages 
(Walkey et al., 2012). LSECs also carry out this task. The LSEC receptors impli￾cated in NP consumption are still investigated, despite the fact that numerous recep￾tors are likely to contribute to intake with varying degrees of eff ciency. Stabilin-2 
is of particular relevance because it is known to endocytose liposome-based NPs in 
alternative animal model for laboratory animals—zebra fsh (Campbell et al., 2018). 
In order to properly understand scavenging and phagocytosis in the context of 
nanotherapeutics clearance, it is necessary to describe the function of the scavenger 
endothelium. Phagocytosis is a process carried out by KCs, dendritic cells (DCs), and 
mononuclear cells, whereas clathrin-mediated scavenging represents a combination of 
transcytosis/endocytosis and pinocytosis (cellular drinking) that promotes the intake 
of sub-200 nm materials that are soluble (Sørensen et al., 2012). This distinction plays 
a signifcant role because nanotherapeutics scavenged by clathrin-mediated endocy￾tosis are subjected to degrade, undergo exocytosis, and are cleared from this urine or 
bile within few days to a few weeks, whereas nanotherapeutics that remained within 
phagocytic cells have extended retention time duration (months to years) ( Zhang et al., 
2016; Hunt et al., 2020). This gives designers of nanotherapeutics a justif cation for 
choosing scavenging over phagocytosis as their preferred mode of targeting. 
Pits that have been coated with clathrin mediate the endothelial transcytosis 
and endocytosis. This complex had been internalized, moved through tubules and 
vesicles, and then exocytosed toward the Disse space, which is the region located 
between LSECs and hepatocytes. Either receptors are involved in transcytosis and 
endocytosis, or they are not. Independent transcytosis performs for solutes in the 
plasma and macromolecules (restricted to 70 nm by the dimensions of clathrin￾coated pits) like glycogen, dextran, and ferritin (Simionescu, Popov and Sima, 2009). 
The transportation of LDL, ceraloplasmin, transferrin, ceraloplasmin, insulin, and 
albumin (alb) is facilitated by clathrin-mediated transcytosis (Simionescu, Popov 
and Sima, 2009). Glycated proteins, as well as the chemokines CXCL10 and MCP-1, 
have recently been added to this list (Li et al., 2013; Shetty, Lalor and Adams, 2018). 
IL-1, p75 (death receptors), insulin, AGE, CP, Tf, Alb, EGF, HDL, and LDL recep￾tors, as well as other receptors for receptor-mediated transcytosis, are present in the 
clathrin-coated pits (Simionescu, Popov and Sima, 2009). 
Metabolism of Nanotherapeutics 
An active drug is typically rendered inactive and water soluble through drug metab￾olism, enabling excretion of the drug via urine or bile. Phase I mechanisms and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics 35 
routes (e.g., oxidation and reduction, hydrolysis) and phase II mechanisms and routes 
(conjugation with water-soluble constituents such as glutathione, acetate, sulfate, 
and glucuronide) are the two processes by which nanotherapeutics are metabolized 
(Klotz, 2009). Despite the fact that the liver is where the most metabolism takes place, 
CYP3A4 can also be found in the colon, kidneys, brain, lung, placenta, and lympho￾cytes. P450 enzymes CYP3A4 (52%), CYP2D6 (30%), and CYP2C9/10/19 (11%) 
account for the majority of hepatic metabolism (Anzenbacher and Anzenbacherová, 
2001). When it comes to metabolism, nanotherapeutics and NPs present a unique 
diffculty because of their quick cellular absorption by MPS (phagocytic cells) 
and LSECs, right after phagolysosome/lysosome-driven destruction. In this phase, 
enzyme metabolism also takes place, and nanotherapeutics are reduced and oxidized 
to increase their solubility for renal and biliary clearance. 
The opsonization aided by C3b or/and IgG, phagocytic cells (MPS) are encouraged 
to degrade nanotherapeutics. These opsonin proteins encourage phagocytosis in KCs, 
neutrophils, and macrophages via either complement receptor or Fc receptor (FcR) 
signaling. The two signaling cascades produce phagosomes in distinctly different 
ways. In contrast to FcR signaling, which stimulates the Src family of kinases—SFKs 
(non-receptor tyrosine kinases) cause the activation of PI3K, PKC, Rac, and ERK and 
complement receptor signaling that facilitates activation of Rho GTPase and Arp 2/3 
complexes (Uribe-Querol and Rosales, 2020). The actin cytoskeleton is altered by the 
phagosome to aid internalization. Once absorbed, the phagosome changes into a pha￾golysosome as lysozymes, myeloperoxidase, lipases, oxidase complexes of NADPH, 
and V-ATPase accumulate (Uribe-Querol and Rosales, 2020). V-ATPase supports an 
acidic surrounding (pH 4.5), and oxidase complexes generate reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and superoxide (O2 - ). Hydrogen peroxide is produced when oxygen dismutates, 
and it is based on coenzymes. O2 - dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can 
form additional radical ions (Cl-
) based on coenzymes (myeloperoxidase) (Nauseef, 
2014). In contrast to the phagolysosome, phagocytic cells also produce cytokines, 
ROS, secrete infammatory mediators, degranulate antimicrobial compounds, and 
generate infammatory mediators (Uribe-Querol and Rosales, 2020). 
There have been reports of many nanotherapeutics degrading via phagolyso￾somes. Myeloperoxidase-induced hypochlorite and peroxynitrite pathways mediate 
the degradation of carbon nanotubes (Ding et al., 2017). Complete decomposition of 
MnO2 NPs results in the formation of free Mn2+ ions, which are easily eliminated by 
the kidneys (Liu et al., 2017). Calcium-based nanotherapeutics breakdown at pH 5, 
but remain stable under neutral pH. Myeloperoxidases are produced when polysty￾rene- and TiO 2-based nanotherapeutics are added to the blend (Sanfns et al., 2018). 
Compared to other nanotherapeutics, AuNPs incorporated nanotherapeutics pose 
a diffculty for degradation because, while being chemically inert, Au was demon￾strated to stimulate a localized infammatory response (Oh and Park, 2014). By trying 
to break down AuNPs, the phagocytic cell triggers this infammatory reaction. The 
presence of coatings over the surface (such as PEGylation) or, with standard AuNPs, 
their prolonged retention within the phagocytic cell mediates the exocytosis of non￾degraded AuNPs from macrophages (Oh and Park, 2014). Clinically, ferric carboxy￾maltose, ferric dextran, and ferric sucrose are forms of FeNPs that are utilized as 
treatments for iron shortage and are destroyed by phagocytic cells (Lyseng-Williamson  
 
 
  
 
 
 
36 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
and Keating, 2009). Fe sucrose exhibits complement-mediated absorption; however, 
other compounds differ in how their cellular take-up into phagocytic cells is carried 
out (Faria et al., 2019). The aforementioned fndings emphasize the signifcance of the 
metal propensity of NPs-based nanotherapeutics to degrade. 
Due to their enormous endocytic capability, LSECs play a crucial part in the degra￾dation of nanotherapeutic agents (Poon et al., 2019). LSECs recognize and internalize 
immune complexes, such as small circulating IgG complexes, pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns, and cellular debris employing a number of receptors, includ￾ing the mannose receptor, stabilins 1/2 (SRH1/2), and the endocytic Fc2B receptor. 
For instance, LSEC remove gram quantities of denatured collagen and procollagen 
I N-terminal peptides resulting from bone turnover via the mannose receptor and 
stabilin-2/SRH-2, respectively (Mousavi et al., 2007). BK polyoma virus, bacterio￾phages, and adenoviruses are also eliminated by LSECs (Øie et al., 2020). The ability 
of LSECs to degrade endocytosed proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids depends on the 
availability of circulating lysosomal enzymes that are taken up by LSECs by man￾nose receptor-mediated endocytosis (Elvevold et al., 2008). It has demonstrated that 
Ag2S QDs coupled to a scavenger receptor binding ligand can be selectively degraded 
by LSECs in vivo (Hunt et al., 2020). In comparison to unconjugated Ag2S QDs, the 
endocytic absorption rate increased by fve times when this ligand was attached, but 
there were no variations in the volume or rate of excretion from the entire animal. 
Figure 2.4illustrates the pathways of hepatic clearance of nanotherapeutics. 
It is crucial to note that phagocytic cells and NPs-based nanotherapeutics that 
are broken down or saturated by LSECs result in soluble and excretable agent that 
can either be eliminated via the kidneys or carried to the bile by soluble carriers 
(SLCs and SLCOs). Problematically, the base of the nanotherapeutic can continue 
to be reactive and capable of causing cellular stress and harm even after it has been 
destroyed. The categorical sequence of metals that cause toxic effects highlights this 
effect, which is most obviously associated with metal nanoparticles-based nanother￾apeutics. For instance, compared to Ag- and carbon-based nanotherapeutics, CeSe/ 
ZnS induce high amounts of oxidative stress, cellular damage, and DNA damage 
(Malaviya, Shukal and Vasavada, 2019). 
Elimination of Nanotherapeutics 
Activated or passive mechanisms can cleanse the urine in order to eliminate the 
metabolized nanotherapeutics from the body. The solubility of the medicine or nano￾therapeutic size (hydrodynamic diameter which is lesser than 6 nm), and protein 
binding status (albumin or corona-coated materials are diffcult to eject) all affect 
passive clearance, which takes place via glomerular f ltration. Glomerular f ltration 
rate (GFR) which can be referred to as the plasma fow from the glomerulus toward 
the Bowman’s space determines passive clearance. 
Nanotherapeutics might even cross the renal proximal tubule cells and reach the 
renal tubules via active secretion, which is made possible by solute carriers (SLC) 
and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (Yin and Wang, 2016). Active urine 
secretion transporters and biliary excretion transporters have a lot in common. 
Waste is transported into the bile cannula through hepatic biliary transport, which is 
handled by several mediators (Jetter and Kullak-Ublick, 2020). Hepatic bile, which

FIGURE 2.4 Schematic of the hepatobiliary processing and clearance of nanoparticles. (1) 
Nanoparticles enter the liver via the portal vein. (2) Nanoparticles traverse the hepatic sinusoid 
and (3) may be taken up and sequestered in liver resident Kupffer cells. (4) Depending on their 
physicochemical properties, nanoparticles may flter out into the space of Disse and be endo￾cytosed by hepatocytes. (5) Nanoparticles transcytose through the hepatocytes and enter the 
bile duct via bile canaliculi. (6) Nanoparticles travel through the hepatic ducts. (7) Depending 
on digestive state and bile production, nanoparticles may frst collect inside the gallbladder 
or (8) nanoparticles may enter into the common bile duct. (9) Nanoparticles are excreted into 
the duodenum of the small intestines via the sphincter of Oddi. (10) Nanoparticles eventually 
traverse the entire gastrointestinal tract and are eliminated in feces.

is produced by the CYP450-mediated metabolism of cholesterol, bilirubin, and lip￾ids, is made up of water, bile cholic acid, salts, and chenodexycholic acid. 
The enzymatic decomposition that happens in an extensive spectrum of tissues 
causes an intersection across the two locations, with soluble blood-born solid wastes 
being eliminated from the body frequently. Collectively, these channels play a part 
toward the active excretion of drugs, xenobiotics, as well as nanotherapeutics. It has 
been demonstrated that AuNP-based nanotherapeutics cause size-dependent NP 
excretion via the urinary and biliary systems. AuNPs less than 6 nm are more easily 
excreted through the urine (Poon et al., 2019). The NPs with dimensions in the range 
of 7–8 nm have greater biliary clearance due to the fact that they contain reduced KC 
uptake and also perform passive fltration via the projected surface of the liver endo￾thelium. This is truly the case for NPs which have larger dimensions than this, which 
shows a size-dependent correlation with active excretion through biliary clearance 
( Tsoi et al ., 2016 ; Poon et al ., 2019 ). 
Many different NP subtypes have incredibly high biliary clearance. Mesoporous 
silica NPs coupled with indocyanine were used by Souris et al. (2010) to show excel￾lent biliary clearance. Last but not least, it has been shown that 7-nm Ag2S QDs 
administered orally have a high biliary clearance (Hunt et al., 2020).  
 
38 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
Active removal of xenobiotics and nanotherapeutics through various transporters 
has been demonstrated. The most prevalent xenobiotic transporter, P-gp, that is also 
known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or ABCB1, is found in the major￾ity of organs (Jetter and Kullak-Ublick, 2020). Additionally, some cancerous cells 
have signifcant P-gp expression. To avoid P-gp-facilitated clearance of nanothera￾peutics from specifc malignancies, different techniques have been developed (Niazi 
et al., 2016). These tactics’ lower long-term clearance and increased diffusion of the 
aforementioned NP-based nanotherapeutics could have unintended consequences. 
Compared to hepatocytes, P-gp is expressed seven times more in the GI tract as well 
as in the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Impaired P-gp clearance may be a factor in 
NP toxicity and protracted retention. Figure 2.5 shows elimination of nanoparticles 
through different organs according to their properties. 
FIGURE 2.5 Elimination of nanoparticles through different organs according to their proper￾ties. The kidney is the most traditional drainage system eliminating the particles <5 nm (a) and 
the particles <5 nm are easily eliminated from the blood. Although the lungs (b) are not a con￾ventional eliminatory system, they can help in fltering aerosolic nanoparticle elimination with 
sizes >100 nm. A second level of elimination is done through the liver (c) where particles of size 
20–100 nm can pass through. The larger particles (<200 nm) which are not eliminated through 
the kidney or liver are eventually eliminated by the RES, e.g., lymph node and spleen (d).

Nanotherapeutics 39 
The GI tract and liver have the highest concentrations of these active absorption 
routes, particularly the SLC channels. This widely accepted presence draws atten￾tion to a crucial problem with identifying and using these channels to promote bio￾availability because it shows a probably higher clearance with more exact targeting 
of those transporters. Nevertheless, if the nanotherapeutic agent can be discharged 
within a short period of time, drug administration may be facilitated during this quick 
clearance.

Nanotheranostics 3 
3.1 WHAT ARE NANOTHERANOSTICS? 
Nanotheranostics integrates diagnostic and therapeutic performance in a single sys￾tem with the recent advances of nanotechnology in nanotherapeutics. It has become 
the most exciting technological horizons in the treatment of various medical disor￾ders with the advancements of nanotheranostics. Current research aims at applying 
these technologies with many purposes, including multimodal imaging, targeting, 
and synergistic treatments, with the goal of developing nanocarriers with both diag￾nostic and therapeutic characteristics. Advanced nanotheranostics perform by acti￾vating their therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities only at the affected pathological 
site through the utilization of physical, chemical, and/or biological stimuli (Kim, Lee 
and Chen, 2013). 
The discipline of nanotheranostic advancement, which aims to combine therapeu￾tic and diagnostic capabilities in a single delivery platform, may represent the nano￾therapeutic industry’s utmost stage of technological progress (Wong et al., 2020). 
Nanotheranostics as one of the ultimate frontiers in personalized medicine, can be 
referred to as nanoparticles developed to offer factual information regarding drug 
distribution, release of various agents in the body, and focused treatment in vivo ( Jo 
et al., 2016). Complicated synthetic methods are typically used to synthesize nano￾theranostics in order to assign numerous functions to the same distribution platform. 
As a result, in some instances, the targeting of nanotheranostics relies solely on the 
passive accumulation of particle in the infected tissue via increased permeability 
and retention effect (EPR), which is typically accomplished with biological coating 
(such as albumin and peptides), or polyethylene glycol (PEG) interfacial modif ca￾tion (Silva et al., 2019). 
Nanodimensions, therapeutic impact, and diagnostic component are the three 
main characteristics of nanotheranostics. Additionally, due to their capacity to sense 
a variety of ailment markers and secrete a variety of therapeutic substances, addi￾tional biological systems, such as microorganisms and mammalian cells, can be 
engineered using nanotechnologies and have a signif cant potential to be utilized in 
the invention of novel nanotheranostic systems. Nano theranostics boost the solubi￾lization and discharge of cargoes to favor several functions into one particle and 
enhance the deposition of both contrast and therapeutic substances at the ailment site 
( Catalano, 2018 ). 
Nanotheranostics are also able to be utilized as a contrast media for photoacous￾tic tomography, fuorescence imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET) 
to provide prolonged, regulated, and targeted administration of therapeutic and 
diagnostic substances for greater theranostic benefts with minimal detrimental reac￾tions. Additionally, nanotheranostics can facilitate transport across the blood–brain

therapeutic agents and how it acts at the cellular and molecular levels.

barrier, siRNA co-delivery, stimuli-responsive release, oral delivery, multimodal￾ity therapies, and synergetic and combinatory therapy. Diseases associated with 
aging may also be treated using nanotheranostics. In order to diagnose and treat 
the ailment at the molecular and cell level, they can attain systemic circulation, 
elude host defenses, and distribute the therapeutic and diagnostic components at the 
targeted place. According to unique disease state of each patient, nanotheranostics 
allows accurate spatiotemporal regulation of the production and release of bioac￾tive molecules, optimizing the therapeutic beneft while reducing negative impacts 
(Funkhouser, 2002). Figure 3.1shows a general representation of a nanocarrier 
which includes both diagnostic and therapeutic agents and how it acts at the cellular 
and molecular levels. 
3.2 IMPORTANCE OF SUCCESSFUL DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES 
Nanotheranostics will be expanded in a larger perspective to enable therapy and 
diagnostics to coexist. In vitro diagnostics could be combined with particular medi￾cations to more precisely guide clinical decision. In this case, biomarkers play a 
crucial role as diagnostic agents of numerous pathological conditions, especially in 
detection of various cancers. A particular biomarker cannot serve as the only pre￾dictor addressing the cancer category, despite the fact that biomarkers are currently 
being associated with stages of the disease. The interaction of particular biomarkers 
can provide more insights about the disease status and, additionally, the responses 
to treatments. The growth of state-of-the-art molecular profling approaches will 
be necessary to better understand the relationship between various biomarkers and 
the ailment category. These biomarker discoveries will encourage multiplexing in 
diagnostic system design as well as effective therapy monitoring. It will be much 
easier to fnd, plan, and monitor therapies if several biomarkers are analyzed and  
 
 
Nanotheranostics 47 
their relationships to one another are determined. Substantial changes in policy may 
be necessary for such biomarker discovery and correlation advancements. To avoid 
a backlog of information, it would be necessary to correctly assemble and evaluate 
any genetic or such types of biomarker evidence gleaned from a patient (Liotta and 
Petricoin, 2000). 
Based on the above facts, it is essential to research different nanotheranos￾tics strategies. Targeted imaging and therapy, activable therapy, activable probes, 
and molecular and biomarker analysis are the drive shafts of this phenomenon. 
Any form of biomolecule, including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, 
enzymes, genes, and metabolites, can serve as a biomarker by indicating the pres￾ence or alteration of signifcant physiological states in the body. The most popular 
method of identifying gene biomarkers by DNA arrays and correlating them with 
various cancer types employing clustering algorithms is known as molecular pro￾fling. It really has allowed for the identifcation of distinct cancer signatures and 
the identifcation of classes of cancers to specifc patients. With the present under￾standing of the human genome, specifc details about a genotype of a patient and 
clinical information can be utilized to choose medicines, therapies, or preventative 
measures that are specifcally tailored to that patient during the time of therapy 
(Sadée and Dai, 2005). 
Antibodies, peptides, amino acids, and aptamers can target certain protein bio￾markers that have been discovered and verifed at the ailment region in addition to 
recognizing genes in a disease state. These biomarkers are primarily ligands that 
are typically expressed in numerous cells; however, they are overexpressed in patho￾logical conditions. For the purpose of choosing a biomarker, fow cytometry, immu￾nohistochemistry, and mRNA expression profles of tumor proteins are necessary. 
Once a biomarker is revealed, it could be tailored to distribute conjugated medicinal 
agents or imaging probes to treat and monitor the specif c site of the ailment or tar￾geted to be obstructed for inhibition (Sievers and Senter, 2013). 
Tackling more complicated targets of pathological conditions could pursue many 
mechanisms, including apoptosis, proliferation, hypoxia, angiogenesis, inf am￾matory reactions, and metastasis. In this case nanotherapeutics-based activatable 
probes achieve more in vitro diagnostics and identify major pathological conditions 
in vivo, whereas molecular beacons primarily identify oligonucleotides solely for 
in vitro applications (Tyagi and Kramer, 1996 ). Utilizing inorganic nanoparticles 
as fuorescence-activatable probes is another tactic. These particles, including gold, 
iron oxide, silica, QDs, and silica nanoparticles, have been widely used in the devel￾opment of multimodal molecular imaging probes, such as the iron oxide NPs used as 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (Swierczewska, Lee and Chen, 
2011). The in vivo capability of these metal nanoparticles-based activatable probes 
can be developed for activatable imaging and therapy when integrated with suitable 
biomolecules. 
Current therapeutical approaches for treatments consist of “activated” therapy, 
such as enzyme-cleavable prodrug, which is comparable to activatable probes 
that may diagnose and identify pathological conditions. Only when these medica￾tions gain a certain biomarker in the cellular level, they become therapeutically  
 
 
 
 
 
 
48 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
effective. The original form of drug is released at the site of the stimulus following 
conversion from an enzyme, a chemical, or an environmental stimulus. As a result, 
there are less hazardous side effects in the body’s healthy regions and the treatment 
can only function at the spot in which the altered biomarker is present (Huang
 et al., 2012 ). 
Targeted molecular imaging, which is a crucial component of a nanotheranostic 
framework, can target, noninvasively image, and trace biomarkers responsible for 
disease pathogenesis. Because it offers a complete physical examination of molecu￾lar activities in real time, this kind of information can be used for purposes other 
than only diagnosing a rare mutation. Clinical professionals can use targeted molec￾ular imaging to assess the extent to which specifc biomarkers are present in the 
body. This information is crucial for disease staging and treatment planning, includ￾ing drug dose and timing. In order to specif cally design imaging probes that target 
genes, nucleic acids, including mRNA, DNA, metabolites, proteins, amino acids, 
and protein–protein interactions, biomarkers in the initial stages of disease patho￾logical conditions must be identifed (Eckelman, Reba and Kelloff, 2008).
 Additionally, in vivo molecular imaging can be incorporated into diagnostic 
systems to upgrade them. Instead of selecting a small portion of a wide variety of 
tissues, targeted molecular imaging might provide additional information on the 
heterogeneity of the disorder. Activatable probes might improve the dispersion of 
tailored medication delivery as well as the spatial interpretation of biomarkers. The 
particular capabilities of nanotechnology will be crucial to the ability of diagnostic 
systems to increase sensitivity and multiplexity. 
There is great potential for nanotheranostics in medicine, despite the fact that 
these approaches remain far from being used in clinical settings and need more in￾depth analysis among biomarkers and the heterogeneity of malignancies in addition 
to various biomarkers. When designing nanotheranostic systems for the detection 
of diseases, it is important to understand and manage the type of targeted moiety, 
imaging modalities, therapy, and stimulation. Research is also required for advanced 
systems that incorporate nanohybrids for multiplexing and multifunctionality. The 
most crucial preclinical considerations for any prospects of nanotheranostics include 
pharmacokinetic tests, acute and long-term toxicity investigations, and quality con￾trol during production (Rai and Jamil, 2019). 
Besides the biomarkers, the “responsiveness” of the transporters to a particular 
external stimulus can contribute to the selection of nanotheranostic for the affected 
site (Sneider et al., 2017). This “activation trigger” is typically administered remotely 
and rapidly in the area of interest, which has the advantage of being noninvasive. 
According to Zhao et al. (2017 ), standard diagnostic or therapeutic vehicles are typi￾cally in the “on” state, and both detection and cargo release start as soon as they are 
administered. However, the formulation of vehicles with “off–on” theranostic capa￾bilities (Yu et al., 2018) can support a tailored evaluation of the quantity of medica￾tion that really reaches the diseased site. Due to this, sensitive nanotheranostics may 
provide new opportunities for adjusting and regulating the frequency and dose of 
treatment (Fan et al., 2016) in several therapies. Nanotheranostics, often known as 
“smart” nanotheranostics, that respond to stimuli typically rely on chemical linkers 
or functional molecules to arrange the nanoparticle systems.  
 
 
 
Nanotheranostics 49 
Various chemical synchronization primitives and pH-sensitive materials can 
be used to impart pH responsiveness, which will activate the therapeutic and/or 
imaging features. The sensitivity of their structure and composition to pH deter￾mines how responsive the majority of these technologies are. Furthermore, the pH￾responsiveness has the potential to improve radiation effectiveness or chemodynamic 
therapy (CDT) in hypoxic tumor circumstances by raising tumor oxygen supply. Last 
but not least, pH-sensitivity can be integrated with other responsiveness mechanisms 
that depend on external stimuli to enhance the carrier’s therapeutic and diagnostic 
characteristics. 
In preclinical drug screening, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
compounds yield satisfactory results in the feld of theranostics. They can be utilized 
as in vivo nanotheranostics to quantify ROS formation despite having theranostic fea￾tures. Current ultrasound diagnostic techniques can be improved by making use of 
the ability of particular material to respond to ROS by producing CO 2. Additionally, 
these approaches can be used to treat a variety of diseases because the formation of 
ROS is a trait of many pathological conditions. 
Theranostic enzyme responsiveness often relies on hydrolytic enzymes that 
promote the degradation of carrier or peptide synchronization primitives. The 
medicinal or diagnostic chemicals contained in the coatings of various particles, 
which stabilize them, can also be employed to take advantage of this phenome￾non. The overexpression of a few enzymes that can identify various clinical states 
is strictly necessary for the effective use of enzyme-responsive nanotheranos￾tics. They are produced by designing biological substrates, which are typically 
functionalized with other molecules (including targeting modif cations) (Karimi
 et al., 2016 ). 
Besides enzymes and ROS as diagnostic triggers, a reactive substance called 
glutathione (GSH) regulates the redox equilibrium within cells. This molecule is 
markedly expressed exclusively in cancer cells, suggesting that it could serve as 
a targetable trigger for the creation of sophisticated nanotheranostics (Liu et al., 
2017). The goal of many of these alterations of biomarkers and other parameters 
is to increase biocompatibility and biological interaction, which will open up new 
research avenues in the study of biologically inspired nanotherapeutics. 
3.3 EMERGING NANOTHERANOSTICS AS DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS 
To get around the constraints of routine therapy and diagnosis for much more proper 
governance of diverse pathological illnesses, the nanotheranostic framework is 
a promising strategy that is desperately required. Through the utilization of bio￾logically compatible nanoparticles that concurrently carry out both diagnostic and 
therapeutic tasks, nanotheranostic modalities offer a viable answer to the diagnos￾tic and therapeutic issues encountered in a number of disorders. Through the use 
of nanoparticles that can be made to recognize particular biomarkers of the tar￾get diseased region, enable real-time scanning or visual analytics of the target, and 
then distribute therapeutic methods of treatment with greater accuracy, this strategy 
may offer a more individualized and targeted strategy to many treatment options. 
Nanosensors and nanomedicine technologies have made signifcant strides in recent  
 
50 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
years, paving the way for prospective ways to integrate nanotheranostics in the man￾agement of numerous pathological conditions. 
Therefore, the objectives of nanotheranostics include not only improving detec￾tion of pathological conditions and treatment effectiveness but also limiting the cyto￾toxic effects related to this therapy (Muthu et al., 2014). In order to anticipate the next 
treatment or determine whether to continue the same therapeutic treatment, it may 
be possible to rapidly examine the results of a treatment in specifc patients owing to 
nanotheranostics (personalized medicine).

Nanotheranostics 51 
Figure 3.2depicted a schematic representation of liposomal nanotheranostics for 
multimode-targeted bioimaging and photo-triggered cancer therapy. Considering 
the major threats to health worldwide, cancers are the leading threat that surge day 
by day. Regarding the photothermal cancer therapy, the quantity of photoenergy that 
is delivered directly to the tumor location can be controlled to maximize the thera￾peutic effectiveness while minimizing harm to the neighboring normal tissues in a 
healthy state. Precious metal-based nanostructures have been well-synthesized and 
have shown strong near-infrared (NIR) laser-induced photothermal therapy (PTT) 
effcacy. Furthermore, because of the inherent toxicity and uncertain long-term tox￾icity of the aforementioned PTT drugs, their potential therapeutic applications were 
mainly constrained. In addition to using magnetic nanotherapeutics, modif ed mam￾malian cell-based nanotherapeutics and magnetic hyperthermal therapies based on 
nanotherapeutics all play a signifcant part in cancer therapies that are strengthened 
with nanotherapeutics (Prasad et al., 2020). 
One of the other major sources of the most important public health problem across 
the world is cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Different preclinical results with nano￾theranostic applications for CVD have been achieved, and they could be applied to 
prospective noninvasive real-time cardiovascular investigation and clinical transla￾tion strategies. At this time, there are no standardized test methods available to assess 
the effcacy of NP therapies in general or their use for CVD especially (Fitzgerald 
et al., 2011). Ultrasmall iron oxide particles (IOPs), one of the pioneering nanother￾anostics for atherosclerosis, were employed as a noninvasive imaging method based 
on NPs to assess the medication therapy in atherosclerosis patients (Tang et al., 2009). 
Targeted theranostic nano- and microbubbles are also a type of theranostics which 
can be employed for CVDs. They can be used to pinpoint the location of clot which 
is concentrated with fbrinolytic activity associated with the avoidance of throm￾bus and clogs in the bloodstreams because they attach to platelets and enable ultra￾sound molecular scanning of thrombi in vivo (Wang et al., 2016). The discovery of 
novel therapeutic approaches and the evaluation of the effcacy and safety of f brino￾lytic and thrombolytic therapy for CVDs can be both accelerated and improved by 
nanotheranostics. 
Diseases inherited to the central and peripheral nerve systems caused by injury, 
infection, or neurodegenerative conditions pose a serious problem in contempo￾rary cultures having numerous, concurrent needs and expectations. The disease’s 
progression cannot be even slowed down by current treatments, which cannot even 
address or lessen the symptoms of brain damage or neurodegeneration. Important 
advancements were made in the introduction of therapeutic or diagnostic contrast 
probes into the nervous system, such as in the case of glioblastoma, while preserv￾ing the capability to realize tailored delivery to particular brain or spinal cord sub￾regions (Alam et al., 2010). The use of nanotechnology-based methodologies and 
nanotheranostics as a resource to enhance the practical eff cacy of the scanning of 
central nervous system processes, explore severe pathological states, and promote 
neurosurgical practice has great development potential. The application that is most 
useful is bioimaging. MRI is the most crucial tool for diagnosing brain diseases. 
By employing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, it will not be long to 
track the progression of various nervous system problems and to better understand

the biology of Alzheimer’s disease. For this purpose, the use of radiolabeled amy￾loid ligands has been suggested (Jack et al., 2013). For scientists and medical pro￾fessionals in the feld, it is still diffcult to fully comprehend the processes and 
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative illnesses and to build synergy to identify 
neurological diseases at their earliest stages and before overt symptoms appear. 
Such clinical issues can be resolved more easily with the help of nanotherapeutics 
and nanotheranostics.

Nanotherapeutics in 4 Monitoring Therapies 
4.1 INTRODUCTION TO NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
IN MONITORING THERAPIES 
Nanotherapeutics are being used more frequently for imaging applications to moni￾tor drug delivery, release, and effcacy in addition to therapeutic applications of 
nanotherapeutic agents. The use of nanotherapeutics for evaluating and enhancing 
the characteristics of medication delivery platforms, as well as their capacity to be 
utilized for the purpose of patient pre-screening and facilitating personalized treat￾ment, is the (pre)clinically foremost signif cant implementation of nanotherapeutics 
for monitoring purposes ( Lammers et al ., 2011 ). 
The determination of concentration levels of drugs in biomaterials as a basis for 
drug therapy monitoring is defnitely a crucial tool for tailored dosing to each indi￾vidual patient as well as adjustment of doses within a wide range of therapeutics. Its 
function is constrained since it does not take into account pharmacodynamic and 
toxicodynamic interactions like those brought on by individualized and environmen￾tal factors. Nonetheless, those reactions continue to be crucial in the effectiveness and 
safety measurements of the medication treatments. As a result, there has been a rise in 
the favor of personalized medication treatment strategy recently, as evidenced by the 
advancement and utilization of molecular “biomarkers” which serve as either direct or 
proximate indicators of therapeutic properties in clinical settings (pharmacodynamic 
therapeutic drug monitoring, PD TDM). Additionally, the aforementioned approach 
is fueled through recent advancements in computational biology/pharmacology, data 
bases, and bioinformatics as well as apparatus with nanotechnology, including mass 
spectrometry, MRI, and array techniques (Shipkova and Christians, 2019). 
Real-time commentary on the pharmacokinetic profles, target site placement, as well 
as deposition of nanomedicines in healthy tissues (off-target) is offered by nanotherapeu￾tics used in monitoring purposes. There are numerous examples for this, including the fact 
that via noninvasively observing the degree of which the delivery substances are capable 
of delivering therapeutically active entities to the diseased location and the degree of those 
entities are capable of preventing those substances from depositing in typical tissues that 
are healthy. It facilitates obtaining crucial information for improving the fundamental 
characteristics of drug delivery platforms and for striking a better balance between the 
effectiveness and the toxic effects of the drug (Davis, Chen and Shin, 2008). 
Considering personalized medicine, it stands to reason that targeted therapy should 
be proceeded only in individuals who exhibit greater amounts of target location segre￾gation and who respond favorably to the initial few therapy sessions. Thus, alternative 
therapeutic strategies should be taken into account regarding this. Nanotherapeutics 
make it easier to monitor cell therapies in addition to the active moiety release from the

principal drug, drug delivery to the targeted site, and the effectiveness of the treatment. 
Organ and cell line transplants are a part of these cell therapies. By exposing promis￾ing strategies to overcome the problems in cell therapies, monitoring cell therapies 
improves the quality of life for patients who have received cell therapies and ensures 
the benefts of nanotherapeutics as monitoring agents (Davis, Chen and Shin, 2008). 
4.2 TYPES OF MONITORING THERAPIES 
The pharmacokinetics monitoring is undoubtedly a crucial step in adjusting doses to 
account for inter- and intra-patient pharmacokinetics variations, as well as monitoring 
the adherence of the patient to treatment and especially avoiding side effects associated 
with accidental overdose as well as drug–drug interactions. Thus, this is constrained by 
the point that it cannot represent pharmacodynamics and toxic and dynamic interplay 
including those due to individual and exterior surrounding-related inf uences, which 
are crucial in therapeutic success. These factors may include, but are not constrained 
to a sensitivity of a person to a specifc therapeutic agent and/or its undesired harmful 
reactions, the progression of tolerance, the possible impact of coexisting morbidity, the 
degree of immunological responsiveness, age, patient stature, nutritional and dietary 
habits, as well as general lifestyle habits (Dreesen and Gils, 2019). On a cellular scale, 
in vivo infuences like the number of cell surface receptors, the effciency of second 
messengers in signaling, stability, the regulatory aspects that regulate the translation of 
genetic materials and protein expression, and translational alterations affect drug reac￾tion and have an infuence on the interaction among drug kinetics and the respective 
pharmacodynamics or toxic and dynamic impacts. Considering the above-mentioned 
factors, it is crucial to monitor those facts to gain the maximum beneft from nano￾therapeutics through effective monitoring aspects (Dreesen and Gils, 2019). 
4.2.1 MONITORING THE RELEASE OF DRUGS 
In addition to building up at the diseased site, the medicine must also be released 
effectively for therapy to be effective. It is crucial to observe and evaluate drug release 
not only under semi-artif cial in vitro systems but also under physiologically suitable 
in vivo systems because drug release patterns differ signifcantly between formula￾tions. Also, signifcant differences in the liberation models of drugs are available. 
As examples liposomes, polymers, and micelles can be mentioned (Lammers et al., 
2005 ). In vivo drug liberation analysis is far more restricted than it is in vitro. As fact, 
after extracting the target tissue, the substance usually requires to be homogenized 
and the cellular material require being degraded in order to liberate the substances 
from particular intracellular compartments. Numerous types of carrier agents are 
disrupted during these procedures, particularly during cell lysis (using detergents). 
For instance, mostly in case of liposomes, they become harder to distinguish among 
the quantity of medication that was continued to be contained in the liposomes at the 
time of extraction and the quantity that had been discharged into the extracellular 
and intracellular surroundings (Lammers et al., 2010). 
Nanotherapeutic preparations, in which medications and imaging compounds are 
incorporated inside them as a single delivery platform, have been created to address 
this limitation as well as to facilitate noninvasive in vivo investigations on (the  
 
 
56 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
pharmacokinetics of) drug release. These imaging modalities are not appropriate 
for monitoring medication release since radionuclides provide comparable signals 
when bound or entrapped and when unbound or free. On the other hand, MR com￾pounds like gadolinium and manganese also rely on their interaction with molecules 
of water around them to produce a signal, and this interaction differs signif cantly 
depending on whether the materials are inside or outside of vesicles that are water￾impermeable like liposomes. For monitoring the release of medications, MR probes 
are a very valuable material (Terreno, Uggeri and Aime, 2012). 
The therapeutic dosage being released from nanotherapeutic systems at the tar￾get location is equally important to attaining optimal biodistribution and accumula￾tion in the target site. Cancer nanotherapeutics, in which imaging compounds and 
chemotherapeutic medications are incorporated within a single distribution system, 
have been created to allow noninvasive imaging and quantifcation of drug release. 
When an imaging compound is attached or trapped in a nanomaterial, it represents 
in unbound or liberated phase after discharge. Thus, it must produce a distinct signal. 
Because of this, probes relying on positron emission tomography (PET) and single 
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have become less appropriate for 
drug release monitoring. Figure 4.1shows the monitoring of drug release by QDs. 
Nevertheless, MRI-based contrast agents and optical mediators have properties that 
are appropriate for this application (Lv  et al., 2023). 
4.2.2 MONITORING DRUG RELEASE BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING 
Drug release monitoring techniques based on MRI are routinely used. Entrapped 
paramagnetic MR compound that is within a water-impermeable nanovehicle which 
carries drugs only provokes a minor T1 reduction, which is discharged into an aque￾ous media outcome in hyperintense impulses in T1-weighted MRI, representing as a 
marker for assessing drug discharge. This is because the image processing signal by 
MR contrast agent tends to depend on the contact with bulk water (Onuki et al., 2010). 
High spatial resolution provided by MRI enables the analysis of drug distribution 
within tumors following nanocarrier-triggered drug release. Using imaging to con￾trol locally initiated drug release also has the benef t of allowing the stimulus (such 
as heat) to be applied at the precise moments when nanocarrier aggregation at the 
target region is greatest. This may be accomplished, for instance, by combining two 
distinct MRI contrast compounds into a single nanovehicle. For instance, Onuki et al. 
used multiplexed MRI to monitor cancer and malignancies formation and drug lib￾eration while co-entrapping iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles, Gd-DTPA (diethylene￾triamine penta-acetic acid), and 5-fuorouracil (5-FU) inside polylactic-co -glycolic 
acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. The discharge of Gd-DTPA, which was utilized as a 
stand-in marker to see the liberation of 5-FU from the nanoparticles, was tracked 
through T1-weighted imaging after the intravenous administration of the encapsu￾lated IO nanoparticles to measure cancer cell accumulation (de Smet et al., 2011). 
4.2.3 MONITORING DRUG RELEASE BY OPTICAL IMAGING 
For monitoring drug release in addition to MRI, optical imaging techniques which 
is relied on quenching/de-quenching and FRET (fuorescence resonance energy Nanotherapeutics in Monitoring Therapies 57 FIGURE 4.1 Monitoring drug release by QDs.

transfer) have also been employed. These fndings demonstrate how MR and OI 
agents can be used for in vivo nanocarrier-drug attachment and dissociation, as well 
as for real-time monitoring and direction of stimulated drug liberation. These instru￾ments are useful for streamlining treatment regimens and thoroughly researching 
the stability, drug release, and therapeutic effcacy of nanotherapeutics (Mitra et al., 
2012 ; Zou et al ., 2013 ). 
4.3 MONITORING OF BIODISTRIBUTION OF THE DRUGS 
Imaging compounds have been encapsulated into or coupled to nanoparticle sys￾tems to enable noninvasive imaging approaches to study the circulatory behavior, 
distribution within the biological systems, and target location deposition of medi￾cines. In this regard, the biodistribution of medications and tumor growth have been 
monitored using imaging techniques, including optical imaging (OI) and radionu￾clide imaging, along with more recently adopted noninvasive imaging technologies 
( Lammers et al ., 2010 ). 
Radionuclides have typically been employed for these objectives. Over the years, 
a signifcant number of radionuclide-labeled nanomaterials have been the focus of 
biodistribution assessments in both animal models and human patients. It is now 
evident that these experiments have a signifcant impact on the processes of delivery 
systems and the ability to predict the therapeutic aspects of targeted nanotherapeu￾tics (Kunjachan et al., 2013). 
Anshuman and the research team have developed hybrid CT-FMT (computed 
tomography–fuorescence molecular tomography) for optical imaging in monitoring 
delivery of drugs into the targeted site. This technology enables CT-based evaluation 
of laboratory mouse and anatomy of organs along with FMT-based measurement of 
near-infrared fuorophore (NIRF) tagged polymeric nanovehicles relied on poly(N -(2 
hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (pHPMA). Also, they attempted scattering and 
absorption remodeling to take into account the various optical features of anatomical 
structures, which noted the signifcant light absorption in the heart, liver, kidney, and 
other organs with high blood fow being the main in vivo absorber of near-infrared 
radiation (Rawashdeh et al., 2017). This method has shown to be highly helpful in 
evaluating the biodistribution of medications in preclinical studies (Xie, Lee and 
Chen, 2010). Such insights highlight the signifcance of combining medications and 
imaging entities in a same formulation when aiming to achieve actually relevant out￾comes when it comes to the noninvasive evaluation of the distribution and the aimed 
location deposition of medicines. They are crucial for enhancing comprehension and 
prioritizing the effcacy of cutting-edge focused therapeutic techniques. Figure 4.2 
depicts noninvasive monitoring therapy for evaluating the drug delivery in a patient 
with a breast cancer (Harrington et al., 2001). 
In addition to the aforementioned recognized imaging modalities, novel noninva￾sive imaging techniques utilizing magnetic particle imaging (MPI), photoacoustic 
imaging (PAI), and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) are innovative 
as monitoring techniques in regard to nanotherapeutics. The contrast agents in sev￾eral of these novel modalities is nanoparticles. Even just a small number of research 
have conducted up-to-date systematically examined nanoparticle delivery and target Nanotherapeutics in Monitoring Therapies 59 FIGURE 4.2 Noninvasive imaging of drug delivery. (a–g) Gamma camera images showing the biodistribution of indium-111-labeled PEGylated liposomes at 72 hours after i.v. injection into a grade 3 squamous cell carcinoma (a–d) and a grade 4 ductal breast carcinoma (e–g) patient. (a–d) In the SCC patient, it can be seen that, even after three days, a substantial amount of liposomes is still present in the systemic circulation (i.e., in the cardiac blood pool; CP), while a signif cant amount has also already accumulated at the target site (i.e., in a tumor localized at the tongue base; Tu). Signif cant accumulation was also observed in organs of the reticulo-endothelial system, like liver (L) and spleen (Spl), which are known to be involved in the clear- ance of long-circulating nanomedicines. (e–g) In the DBC patient, besides localization to blood, tumor (Tu), liver (L), and spleen (Spl), accumulation in left axillary lymph node (LN) could also be clearly observed, indicative of metastasis and of effective drug targeting to this pathological site. (h and i) Besides, for assessing target site accumulation, theranostic nanomedicines are also highly useful for analyzing pharmacokinetics (h), as well as for prescreening patients and identifying tumor types (and sizes) amenable to EPR-mediated drug targeting (i).

site deposition. The use of MPI to investigate the distribution of superparamagnetic 
iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) and PAI and MSOT to assess the in vivo outcome 
of gold- and carbon-based nanomaterials and also nanomaterials containing hemo￾globin, melanin, and porphyrin is expected to increase in the future (Arami et al., 
2015 ; Poon et al ., 2015 ; Wang et al ., 2015 ). 
4.4 DRUG EFFICACY MONITORING 
Nanotherapeutic preparations are excellent for predicting and observing treatment 
responses in addition to noninvasively measuring drug distribution and drug release. 
These nanotherapeutic preparations may be capable, for example, of being tagged 
with radionuclides in order to gain several preliminary noninvasive data regarding 
target site deposition for the predicting of therapeutic reactions, as previously men￾tioned, throughout phase I and phase II clinical trials. The prospective eff cacy of 
novel therapeutic approaches based on nanotherapeutics might then be predicted 
logically on the basis of this. A radiolabeled form of the aforementioned inactively 
tumor-aimed prodrug which is polymeric in its nature might have been utilized 
for monitoring patients referred to PK1 in the initiation clinical trial—phase I for 
HPMA-copolymer-based doxorubicin (i.e., PK1). For example, to determine which 
tumors are susceptible to EPR-mediated targeted therapy and which are not, and 
thereby to anticipate which patients are susceptible to responding to PK1 therapy and 
which people with the disease are not (Lammers et al., 2011). 
Comparable to this, the integration of functional SPECT imaging and anatomical 
CT imaging may be employed in the clinical trials—phase I or phase II trying to 
focus on hepatic-targeted PK1 (i.e., PK2) to identify which hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) patients exhibit better tumor deposition and which do not, and to determine 
on the basic principle of this which individual patient PK2 therapies should pro￾ceed in. Additionally, by repetitively exposing individuals to anatomical CT imaging 
along with 2D scintigraphy or 3D PET and blending in smaller levels of nanoma￾terials that are radiolabeled with medical therapy, it could be feasible to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the treatment in real time and give crucial data for aiding in 
taking decisions regardless of the choice to continue treatments and whether or not 
to modify dosage of medications. Nanotherapeutics may help to attain the prospects 
of “personalized medicine,” or customized treatment for specifc patients, which is 
dependent on research into genetic polymorphisms and biomarkers, as well as the 
advancement of monitoring techniques for assessing and anticipating responses to 
treatment (Lammers et al., 2011). 
4.5 MONITORING CELL THERAPIES 
Exogenous transplant is a potential to transform medications by reviving function of 
anatomical structures by replacing or repairing damaged or defective cells. The site, 
distribution, and extended stability of transplanted cells should be assessed in order 
to create an effcient cell treatment. Imaging techniques based on nanoparticles (NP) 
have the potential to provide noninvasive cell tracking. The physicochemical charac￾teristics of the NPs-based nanotherapeutics must be accurately regulated throughout  
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Monitoring Therapies 61 
production to facilitate sensitive and specifc recognition with great spatial resolution 
in vivo. The biological processes of the transplanted cells should remain unaffected 
by the NPs and cell tagging process in order to clearly understand the complicated 
spatial-temporal dynamics of the cells. 
Fluorescence monitoring with QDs, MRI monitoring with magnetic NPs, and 
PET imaging with radioisotope-comprised NPs are all current methods for cell 
monitoring. The following generation of intelligent imaging agents should support 
a variety of imaging techniques and allow reporting on both location of the cellular 
materials and activity. It can be concluded that additional characterization is neces￾sary to understand and counteract compounds transfer, signal dilution, and a number 
of negative effects labeling chemicals may have on cells. The advancement of novel 
compounds and a deeper comprehension of the reactions between cells and labels 
would considerably increase the utility of NP-based tracking of cells and avoid over￾interpreting imaging (Xu et al., 2011). 
4.6 EMERGING NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR 
MONITORING THERAPIES 
Nanotherapeutics can be applied in a variety of ways in monitoring therapies. They 
enable the refnement of drug delivery platforms by permitting a noninvasive evalu￾ation of the pharmacokinetic profles, the distribution within the biological tissues, 
and the localization of target of coupled or enclosed pharmacologically active com￾pounds. Nanotherapeutics may also be utilized to anticipate treatment outcomes by 
fusing data on entire target site localization with imaging techniques insights on the 
local delivery of the drug and/or the vehicle which delivered material at the target 
location. 
Additionally, several fundamental characteristics of drug delivery platforms 
could be seen and examined by noninvasively monitoring drug liberation in vivo, 
and efforts could be taken to reconcile the in vitro qualities of transporting agents 
with their in vivo abilities. The effectiveness of triggerable drug delivery platforms 
can also be improved by employing contrast materials to track the liberation of drugs 
which are pharmacologically active from stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials, as demon￾strated by numerous research on thermosensitive liposomes. Moreover, nanothera￾peutics may be utilized to accelerate (pre-) clinical effectiveness analyses, to monitor 
individuals, as well as to harness the benefts of customized medications by offer￾ing real-time assessment on the effectiveness of focused therapeutic interventions 
( Dasgupta et al ., 2020 ).

Nanotherapeutics 5 in Drug Discovery 
and Development 
5.1 PROCESS OF DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT 
Drug discovery is an expensive process that typically takes ten years from discovery to 
commercialization. Importantly, the expense and approval time vary based on the ail￾ment being treated and the medicine being developed. In contrast to a treatment that is 
urgently required and would typically go through a prioritized review procedure, a drug 
that offers only modest enhancements over currently marketed treatments will have a 
signifcantly longer review process. Research across all therapeutic domains shows that it 
typically takes substantially longer than 12 years to produce a new drug, from target iden￾tifcation through clinical trials to marketing approval ( DiMasi et al., 2010). The expense 
of developing an entirely novel molecular entity (NME), which can be described as a 
tiny molecule compound, or a new biological entity (NBE), which can be exemplif ed as 
an antibody, gene, protein, drug molecule, etc., is unquestionably greater than $1 billion. 
On average, it has been approximated to be around $2.6 billion (DiMasi, Grabowski and 
Hansen, 2016). However, generating an orphan drug (a medication used to treat uncom￾mon and undertreated medical illnesses) is substantially less expensive altogether than 
developing a nonorphan medication. The drug development procedure is intended to “fail 
fast, fail early,” especially during the clinical development phase, in order to eliminate 
signifcant threats before making a costly late-stage expenditure (Cook et al., 2014; Owens 
et al., 2015). 
The key pin of a preclinical drug discovery project is to formulate one or many 
clinical drug candidate molecules where every single one of which demonstrates 
enough biological activity at an ailment-relevant target with suffcient safety and 
drug-like qualities that are intended to test in humans. Although numerous molecules 
do not proceed through the overall procedure due to issues with safety measurements, 
toxicity, pharmacokinetic profles, potency, intellectual property considerations, or 
other facts. Moreover, the majority of discovery programs aim to develop more than 
one candidate compound. The wide-ranging chemistry, biology, molecular sciences, 
toxicology, and collaborative effort of pharmacokinetic aspects are almost always 
the standard in advanced drug development initiatives. Thus, there is no easy solu￾tion for developing an effective clinical candidate chemical compound. New molecu￾lar drug discovery projects typically produce enormous quantities of information by 
utilizing high-throughput screening strategies that assess many molecules at many 
dose levels against several assay methods (Sams-Dodd, 2005). 
The advanced process of drug discovery generally entails the following steps: 
detecting the disorder to be treated as well as its unsolved medical requirement,

choosing a druggable molecular aim and validating it, developing in vitro assays, 
accompanied by high-throughput screening of molecules against the aim to recog￾nize hits, and hit optimization to produce lead compounds which possess satisfactory 
potency and selectivity against the targeted biomolecule in vitro and that exemplify 
effectiveness in an experimental animals. Before moving on with drug development, 
the lead compounds are then further refned to increase their effectiveness and phar￾macokinetics (Figure 5.1) (Sinha and Vohora, 2018). 
Preclinical and clinical stages of development could be distinguished in the 
procedure for drug development (Figure 5.2). Pharmacological safety and toxico￾logical investigations of the candidate are carried out during preclinical develop￾ment in the future desires of determining the optimized and secured dosages in 
laboratory animals and evaluate the potential for undesired harmful effects of the 
drug-in-development. Moreover, research is done to determine the most cost-effec￾tive manufacturing procedures needed for the particular medication as well as the 
ideal formulation. If the candidate demonstrates enough safety and effectiveness in 
preclinical testing, clearance from drug regulatory bodies is requested to begin the 
clinical development of those drugs, during which their safety and effectiveness are 
evaluated in pilot and pivotal trials. The number of cutting-edge medications getting 
marketing approval has been declining over time. This is a result of critical exami￾nation by regulatory bodies about the effciency and safety of new pharmaceuticals, 
which raises costs and extends development time frames (Sinha and Vohora, 2018).

Furthermore, the senior management of pharmaceutical frms strives to reduce 
the risks connected to medication development and discovery. Also, the burden on 
national health systems brought on by the price of medications has a negative effect 
on their pricing. However, the proftability of pharmaceutical industry and their sub￾sequent growth have decreased due to patent expirations and generic substitutes, 
which has led to less amounts of capital being invested in cutting-edge research. 
More mergers and acquisitions in the feld of medicines, with the initial goal of low￾ering R&D expenses and developing synergies, are a direct result of the depressing 
decline in productivity. It is doubtful that industry consolidation will enhance pro￾ductivity because post-mergers and acquisitions and pipeline developments spending 
in creative research have actually declined. Despite the decline in R&D productivity 
brought on by the aforementioned issues, there continues to be a signif cant unmet 
need in the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson, 
diabetes, etc. (Mohs and Greig, 2017). 
Additionally, there is an immediate necessity of novel medications due to the 
global upsurge of multidrug-resistant infectious diseases. Today, almost all phar￾maceutical companies use the same technical procedures to fnd new medications. 
They include the use of combinatorial chemistries, automated screening, nanotech￾nology-based techniques, and the cloning and expression of receptors and enzymes 
in arrangements that enable high-throughput. To overcome the above-mentioned 
bottlenecks, nanotechnology and nanotherapeutics can be implemented as success￾ful efforts in drug discovery and development (Matthews et al., 2012). 
5.2 ROLE OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN DRUG DISCOVERY 
The recent use of nanotechnology and nanotherapeutics in the process of drug 
discovery and development involves producing superior diagnostic procedures,  
 
 
66 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
improved medication formulations, and improved systems for delivering drugs 
for treating diseases. Innovating solutions are provided by the groundbreak￾ing design of nanotechnology-based nanotherapeutics, which increases analyti￾cal capabilities of research scientists, improves the quality of their data, and 
requires relatively small sample volume for the preservation and screening of 
molecular, cellular, and tissue banks. The original difficulties of inadequate 
throughput, inaccurate data, and several other problems are now starting to be 
overcome through nanotechnological advancements (Berdigaliyev and Aljofan, 
2020 ). 
Technology advancements over the past ten years have allowed the drug dis￾covery process to advance into a platform where innovative lead compounds could 
be discovered quickly toward novel and occasionally challenging aims. Despite 
the fact that techniques based on nanorobotics and automation advances toward 
miniaturization have considerably enhanced throughputs in drug formulation and 
screening, they have only just begun to scratch the surface. The method of dis￾covering new drugs has already undergone a revolution with the development of 
microarray analysis and lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology (Pradeep, Raveendran 
and Babu, 2022). 
These cutting-edge techniques reduce the amount of uncertainty required in 
choosing targets, leads, and therapeutic candidates by producing high-value infor￾mation quickly. However, nowadays, even more cutting-edge technologies, including 
nanotechnology, are poised to further automate, speed up, and improve the reliability 
of tests by functioning at scales which are far smaller than traditional microarrays 
( Govindarajan et al ., 2012 ). 
Cross-disciplinary scientists have the chance to design and create multifunctional 
nanoparticles which can target, detect, and treat disorders in this quickly expand￾ing feld of nanotherapeutics. The primary goals of nanotechnology in the f eld of 
drug discovery and development are to strengthen disease therapy through the devel￾opment of improved diagnostic procedures, therapeutic preparations, and delivery 
systems for drugs. For the purpose of creating novel utilizations to enhance human 
healthcare, the research arena is focusing drastically on the novel chemical and phys￾ical features of materials in nanodimensions. 
The atomic force microscope (AFM) was the f rst commercial nanotechnology 
utilized for therapeutic purposes (Butt, Cappella and Kappl, 2005). This method 
was frst utilized to map the topographical features of surfaces in atoms or mol￾ecules accuracy using a silicon-based needle with a sharpness at atomic scale. The 
sample is scanned by the incredibly thin tip, which produces a three-dimensional 
surface representation. With its ability to directly examine individual atoms or mol￾ecules and handle a numerous sample at the nanoscale scale, the AFM is quickly 
replacing other technologies as the main tool used by scientists and researchers. 
Although AFM is immensely valuable for visualizing particles that possess nanodi￾mensions in felds like life science, materials science, electrochemistry, polymer 
science, and biophysics, they have been used only very recently in methods to 
obtain better chemical complexities of the methods that cells response to stimuli, 
which might also conf rm specifcally important for drug discovery (Butt, Cappella 
and Kappl, 2005).  
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Drug Discovery and Development 67
Identifcation of various protein content in typical healthy and pathological tis￾sues, characterization of these proteins, and identifcation of the protein’s function in 
biochemical processes have been the main goals of proteomics investigations. Then, 
these proteins can be used as prospective therapeutic targets and diagnostic indica￾tors. Protein and DNA microarrays, which enable the greater selective capture and 
evaluation of numerous proteins expressed in distinct cell types subjected to specif c 
perturbations in a high-throughput manner, remain at the forefront of these devel￾oping and emerging advances. The complete suite of drug discovery applications 
cannot be utilized due to various restrictions in the currently available microarray 
techniques. Nanoarrays, an ultra-miniaturized variation that belongs to the conven￾tional microarray which enable monitor interactions among atoms and molecules 
below to nanometer resolutions, are the product of the next stage of evolution. Very 
small amounts of protein molecules can be successfully tested against a wide range 
of pharmacological targets using nanoarray technology. Moreover, nanoarrays may 
be used as sensors in dimensions that large microarrays cannot. Figure 5.3shows 2D 
protein nanoarray as a carrier of sensing elements for gold-based immunosensing 
systems ( Tang et al ., 2022 ).
 To fulfll the demand for improved specifcity in high-throughput screening, 
nanotherapeutics are being developed. Quantum dots, nanobars, nanodendrimers, 
or colloids that are nanoscale in size offer extremely stable, easily multiplexable 
molecular labels that are approximately comparable to the biomolecules of inter￾est. Nanomaterials are useful for bio tagging or labeling since nanoparticles can be 
found in the same size range as proteins. Nevertheless, a biological or molecular 
encapsulating or membrane acting as a bioinorganic interface should be linked to the 
nanoparticle in order to incorporate with a suitable target (Yamankurt et al., 2019).

68 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
The vast majority of the industrial nanoparticle implementations in medicinal 
f eld focus on the development and delivery of new drugs. In applications requiring 
great photo-stability and multiplexing properties, nanoparticles are gradually replac￾ing organic dyes. Nanobars, a different type of molecular tagging, are made of alter￾nating slabs of refective metals and may be optically scanned like real bar codes to 
distinguish various molecular species. These frameworks have several merits upon 
traditional labeling, including the ability to construct a wide variety of labels, the 
ability to multiplex, and the persistence of the signal (Bhirde et al., 2011). 
The emergence of new chemical compositions, the ability to regulate and track 
molecules on the nanoscale as a result of advancements in microscopy, upsurged 
government funding designated for nanotechnology, notable as well as future per￾spectives provided by the private investment community, and the explosive growth 
of nanotechnology start-up businesses are primary factors infuencing the expan￾sion of nanotherapeutic advancements in drug discovery. The whole marketplace for 
nanotechnology-related approaches in drug discovery was predicted to have earned 
lower than $700 million in revenues in 2005, despite a global expenditure of slightly 
over $8.5 billion. By 2012, the market was projected to increase by double digits and 
reach a startling $2.5 billion (The role of nanotechnology in drug discovery, 2006 ). 
Most of the prospects will be presented by nanoparticle solutions, nano-enabled 
pharmaceuticals, and many other nano-enabled devices like nanoarrays as well as 
nano-mass spectrometry. Financing for new technology has historically been a chal￾lenge to the industrial frm. Many industries that specialize in the area of nano￾therapeutic solutions have been established in response to the desire for fast drug 
development and enhanced drug treatments. Major microfuidics and LOC f rms 
are in the greatest position to proft from the shift toward nanotechnology-based 
approaches in drug development, despite the fact that the market now includes a 
large number of start-ups as a result of the emergence of nanotherapeutics. Aclara 
Biosciences, Agilent Technologies, Cepheid, Caliper Life Sciences, Eksigent 
Technologies, CombiMatrix Corporation, Nanogen, Gyros, and Nanostream are a 
few examples of such frms (Samuel Reich, 2011). The latter is a worldwide leader 
in semiconducting nanocrystal innovation and holds numerous signif cant interna￾tional patents. Its main technology, Qdots®, is utilized for high-throughput screen￾ing (Samuel Reich, 2011). 
It is worth noting that nanotherapeutic solutions are by no respects a “sure thing” 
since it remains a very high ladder to climb in order to obtain the Holy Grail. Thus, 
the bulk of drug discovery–based nanotherapeutic treatments remain in the initial 
research and development stages (R&D). Nanotherapeutics may need to function at 
greater precision levels and achieve higher levels of throughput when compared to 
conventional micro- or macroscale, automatic equipment in order to be considered 
for commercial implementation. 
It is undeniable that any brand-new, cutting-edge technology raises aspirations and 
expectations. While this may allow the company spend more money and resources, 
a lack of visible progress, commercial delays, or additional regulatory hurdles may 
crush the expectations and credibility. Similar to how high-throughput screening 
(HTS) was heralded as the solution for increasing drug discovery eff ciency decades 
ago, causing a surge in ultra-HTS (UHTS) and high-speed automation, which has

since begun to fall after failing to live up to its own expectations. The health science 
industrial feld is just recently starting to embrace micro-fabrication as a means of 
miniaturizing interdisciplinary (Fox, Filichkin and Mockler, 2009). 
In particular, nanoparticle-based nanotherapeutics utilized for drug discovery 
tasks can raise issues if they break down too rapidly or stay in the body compart￾ments for prolonged periods; as a result, they need to maintain the highest levels of 
stability. Although nanomaterials can interact with living organisms, there is risk 
that they will be harmful to both human and the environment. Despite the enormous 
advantages of nanotechnology, there are undoubtedly numerous obstacles to over￾come. Drug discovery strategies based on nanotechnology are starting to reveal sub￾stantial fresh insights toward how biological systems work, and they will also enable 
the development of totally new categories of micro- and nano-fabricated equipment 
and systems.

Nanotherapeutics 6 in Drug Delivery 
INTRODUCTION 
Nanotechnology claims to be the preferred drug delivery method, particularly for the 
more problematic traditional medications that are utilized in the care of many dis￾eases. Drug aiming and sustained release are the key primary elements required for 
tailoring an effective and optimized drug delivery system (DDS). The carrier element 
should arrive the region where the anticipated medicine would reach, and the other 
elements within the carrier pertain to do with the rate and duration of the drug release. 
Moreover, there are several kingpins in employing the targeting of distribution of 
shabbily water-soluble medicines to a specif c site to decrease the deposition of drug 
within normal tissues. They include assisting in maintaining half-life of the drug and 
optimized duration of activated drug which gives an effective treatment, extending the 
therapeutic action of the drug by acting as a shield to protect the drug from biological 
barriers, and enabling drug delivery throughout epithelial and anatomical barriers. 
These are considered as advantages of using nanotechnology-based nanotherapeutics 
in DDS (Patra et al., 2018). Figure 6.1shows a comprehensive description of different 
nanoformulations in DDS and their merit points (Rana and Sharma, 2019). 
6.1 LIPID-BASED NANOCARRIERS 
Lipid-based nanocarriers can be further divided to nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanopar￾ticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. Nanoemulsions are an intriguing approach 
of delivering various drugs as a colloidal solution that may be sterilized through 
fltering. These nanoemulsions which are formulated as nanoscale oil droplets within 
an aqueous base are heterogeneous in their nature, culminating in a combination of 
nanodroplets with a narrow particle distribution. The resulting nanoemulsions are 
homogeneous, opaque or transparent, and well-supported by surfactant. According 
to their formulation methods, three types of nanoemulsions exist: a nanoemulsion in 
which water is dispersed in oil, a nanoemulsion in which oil is dispersed in water, and 
a bicontinuous nanoemulsion (D’Souza et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2011). 
The ability of nanoemulsions to mask the unpleasant favor of greasy drug formu￾lations is their most important feature. Moreover, they extend the activity of medica￾tions and shield them from chemical reactions such as oxidation and hydrolysis. Thus, 
certain nanoformulations of nanoemulsions may be proven to be a highly bioavail￾able and effective delivery method. To lessen infammatory responses in vascular 
environment, Simion et al. developed P-selectin targeted dexamethasone-reinforced 
lipid nanoemulsions in 2016. Physicochemical evaluations on the produced formula￾tions were performed and the research revealed that the nano-formulation worked 
both in vitro as well as in vivo. It preferentially reduces endothelial activation and,

Nanotherapeutics in Drug Delivery 73 
as a corollary, monocyte infltration, which signifcantly reduces lung inf ammation 
in mice as the utilized laboratory animal model in the study (Simion et al., 2016). 
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are lipid nanoparticles that have been formu￾lated in a solid material. They are developed by employing a lipid in the solid state 
to create oil-in-water nanoemulsions. The initial prototypes of SLNs were devel￾oped around 1990. Inexpensive raw materials, formulating methods that are car￾ried in the absence of organic solvents, the utilization of biological lipids, simplicity 
of scaling up, compatible with biological materials, enhancement in bioavailability, 
shielding delicate moieties from environmental risks, and sustained drug-release are 
some benefts attributed with SLNs. Solid lipids are less suited for drug delivery sys￾tems due to their polymorphic transition, drug ejection problems, inconsistent gela￾tion propensity, and limited drug integration (Fang, Al-Suwayeh and Fang, 2013). 
Ciprofoxacin-loaded SLNs were recently developed with enhanced antimicrobial 
properties by employing melt-emulsifcation approach assisted with ultrasonic tech￾nique. With various lipids, release of ciprofoxacin displayed a sustained-release 
nature. Stearic acid-prepared ciprof oxacin SLNs (CIPSTE) demonstrated the high￾est burst effect, leading to quick drug release (Shazly, 2017). 
The second generation of drug delivery platforms of lipid nanosystems after the 
initial prototypes, known as nonstructured lipid carriers, is composed of lipids in the 
liquid state blended with solid lipids (Souto and Muller, 2007). In contrast to emul￾sions, these drug carriers in nanoscale strongly immobilize therapeutic medicines 
and inhibit particle agglomeration ( Zauner, Farrow and Haines, 2001). Moreover, 
compared to SLNs, their cargo capacity for drug molecules is higher owing to the oil 
droplets in the liquid phase incorporated in a solid matrix. Biodegradability, compa￾rably negligible toxicological effects, sustained release, drug stability, and organic 
solvents-free synthesis are benefts of NLCs against other nanomaterials. NLCs have 
been thoroughly studied over the past few decades for the delivery of both hydropho￾bic and hydrophilic medicines. The NLCs were designed with the goal of satisfying 
industry demands for certifcation and validation, uncomplicated technology, scal￾ability, and affordability (Shidhaye, Vaidya and Sutar, 2008). 
6.2 POLYMER-BASED NANOCARRIERS 
Polymer-based nanocarriers are further categorized into four subcategories: self￾assemble nanocarriers that include dendrimers and micelles, particulate nanocar￾riers that include polymeric nanoparticles, capsular and vesicular nanocarriers that 
include nanocapsules and nanobubbles, and fnally cyclodextrin-based nanocarriers 
that include nanosponges.
 Exceptional three-dimensional, spherical, densely branched nanopolymeric frame￾works are called dendrimers. They stand out from other nanosystems of drug delivery 
owing to interesting properties: aqueous solubility, nanoscale size, narrow polydis￾persity index, customizable structural properties in molecules, presence of niches in 
the interior, and numerous functional moieties at the exterior. The framework for 
conjugation and targeting of drugs is provided by terminal characteristics. These 
auxiliary functional moieties also provide them bespoke features, increasing their 
adaptability ( Patri, Majoros and Baker, 2002 ). The most extensively researched  
 
 
 
 
74 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
dendrimer for medication delivery is polyamidoamine. According to a study 
conducted recently, sonophoresis and terminated by arginine peptide dendrimers 
may be able to increase the transdermal permeability of ketoprofen ( Manikkath 
 et al ., 2017 ). 
Multicompartment micelles (MCMs) and associated block copolymer archi￾tectures with superior structural features have become a fascinating category of 
sophisticated self-assemblies belonging to soft-matter nanotechnology that enable 
a basic understanding of the bottom-up construction of solution-based hierarchies. 
They are an attractive type of responsive nanotherapeutics because they permit 
the concomitant delivery of multiple medications and combine much like proteins 
in various physical nanoenvironments in well-separated compartments (Gröschel
 et al., 2012 ). 
Polymers that are synthesized are utilized to create the most prominent poly￾meric nanoparticles. Polymers that have a natural inheritance have inconsistent 
purity and batch-to-batch uniformity, which cause poor reproducible and controlled 
release nature for the medicine that is being entrapped in them. The manner of drug 
release from polymeric nanoparticles can be altered owing to the availability of 
synthetic polymers with high batch-to-batch repeatability and purity (Panyam and 
Labhasetwar, 2003). Hydrophilic functionalities can be enclosed inside the polymer￾based nanoparticles that are synthetic using the double emulsion approach due to 
the challenge to retain their biological activity in the presence of organic solvents on 
volatile nature. 
Aliphatic polymers that have a tendency to biodegradation, such as polylactide 
(PLA), polylactide- co-glycolide copolymers (PLGA), and poly(-carpolactone), in 
addition to polymers that are nonbiodegradable such as polyacrylates and poly(methyl 
methacrylate), are often utilized as synthetic polymers described for drug delivery 
( Zhang et al., 2013). Polymeric nanoparticles might effciently shield drug moieties 
with an unstable nature from deterioration, reducing the likelihood that harmful 
medications will have side effects. 
A medication typically incorporated into drug molecules are usually encapsulated 
in solid or liquid nanocapsules before being enclosed by a special membrane made 
of synthetic or organic polymers. Most of the scientists who engage with research 
are mesmerized by pharmaceuticals related to nanocapsules that are available on the 
market due to their encapsulation, which shields the encapsulated substance from 
undesirable issues like breakdown in the fuid base and slows the release of moieties 
which govern the therapeutic action (Kothamasu et al., 2012). Colon cancer cells 
may be targeted by resveratrol-loaded lipid-core-nanocapsules (RSV-LNC), which 
have been developed and characterized recently (Feng, Zhong and Zhan, 2017). 
Nanobubbles are spherical and stabilized vesicular structures that contain gas 
in aqueous solutions with dimensions just under 1,000 nm. However, they are pri￾marily in the region of 100 nm when developed by the technique of hydrodynamic 
or acoustic cavitation. The vast majority of nanobubbles have a core structure in a 
shell, in which the core is the area of the nanobubble that contains the chosen gas 
and the outer shell can have a variety of constituents and topologies. A recent study 
proves that nanobubbles can be utilized to store O 2 and formulate oxygenated nano￾bubbles as a treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients who suffer from hypoxia.  
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Drug Delivery 75 
These oxygenated nanobubbles can be administered to the bloodstream to overcome 
the hypoxic states of COVID-19 patients (Afshari et al., 2021). 
Nanosponges can be loaded with both hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and lipophilic 
moieties. They have attracted the interest of experts who engage in pharmaceutical 
research for drug delivery. These nanosponges are incredibly small, consist low toxi￾cological profle, high porosity, scaffold, and colloidal structures with lots of voids 
where drug particles could be enclosed. The most often used ingredient in the forma￾tion of these nanocarriers is cyclodextrin. Both water and organic solvents are unable 
to dissolve in these complexes. They have a pH range of 2–11, and have an ability 
of self-sterilization and being stable up to 300°C. Employing a synthesis approach 
assisted with ultrasound, Trotta and colleagues developed cyclodextrin nanosponges 
and investigated their potential as anticancer therapeutics (Prasad et al., 2018). 
6.3 CROSS-LINKED NANOGELS 
It has been shown that nanogels are soluble in high degrees when employing as 
drug delivery vehicles. Nanogels are small, round, partially permeable polymer 
structures with internal voids that can incorporate drug molecules of varied sizes 
(Vinogradov and Senanayake, 2013). Nanogel expands when exposed to water. Thus, 
the drug can be introduced straight away, giving the possibility of materializing a 
rigid, dense nanocarrier which acts like a drug-carrying vehicle by reducing the vol￾ume of solvent. Due to its excellent structural qualities, enhanced biocompatibility, 
and dampness, it has an exceptional status in carrier-based drug delivery systems. 
Gels provide a vast surface area for bioconjugates and an inner environment for bio￾molecule incorporation when completing their structure formation. It possesses an 
effective self-property that facilitates drug release and facilitates the simple removal 
of any leftover nanogel formulation components (Oh et al., 2008). Core/shell nanogel 
formulations with N-isopropyl methacrylamide enable controlled release as cancer 
drugs (Peters et al., 2018). 
6.4 DRUG CONJUGATES 
Typically, drugs could be chemically bioconjugated or accumulated on the surface of 
a nanocarrier, either internally or externally. Normally, chemical conjugation occurs 
on the outermost layers of NPs. There are various methods for conjugating NPs with 
drug-like responses. When combined into a system of controlled medication release, 
NPs based on liposomes might be thought of as one of the most promising carriers 
(DDS). Spherical compartments known as liposomes are produced by suspending 
phospholipids inside a hydrophobic medium, which is then gradually replaced by 
a hydrophilic solution. The conjugation is carried out using a variety of chemical 
techniques and functional groups (Aguilar-Pérez et al., 2020); however ester bonds 
among a group of carboxylic acids and a group of hydroxyls, which may include the 
drug or the lipid, correspondingly, are the most popular. To overcome drawbacks 
such as multidrug resistance, nanoparticles have been conjugated to enhance the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of these bulk-carrying structures. 
Using liposomes as carriers of biomolecules, researchers were able to produce DDS

with anticancer potential by conjugating them with microbubbles, specif c proteins, 
or antibodies (Eras et al., 2022). 
6.5 ORGANIC NANOPARTICLES FOR DRUG DELIVERY 
A variety of organic components are used in the medication delivery methods. Chitosan 
is capable of performing function at the constrictive epithelial junctions since it has 
muco-adhesive qualities. In order to provide ongoing medication release systems for 
different kinds of epithelia, chitosan-based nanoparticles are commonly studied. In 
the interest of administering the antibiotic ceftazidime to the eye, Silva et al. pro￾duced and assessed the effectiveness of a 0.75% w/w isotonic solution of hydroxy￾propyl methylcellulose (HPMC) containing chitosan/sodium tripolyphosphate/ 
hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (Silva et al., 2017). 
Alginate is another organic substance, which is also referred to as a biopolymer, 
that has been utilized for medication delivery. As contrast to cationic and neutral 
polymers, such anionic mucoadhesive polymer, which has terminal carboxyl groups, 
exhibits better mucoadhesive intensity. Xanthan gum is a heteropolysaccharide that 
comprises a large molecular weight. It has strong bioadhesive qualities and is consid￾ered a polyanionic polysaccharide. Xanthan gum is commonly used as a pharmaceuti￾cal excipient because it has a low toxicological profle and is a relatively nonirritating 
polymer material. Cellulose and its derivatives are widely used, mostly to alter the 
dissolution and gelation of the medicines, which in turn controls their prof le for 
release of active moieties of the medicines (Sun et al., 2019). Repaglinide, an anti￾hyperglycemic drug which is used in diabetic patients, was studied by Elseoud et al. 
(Elseoud et al., 2018) using nanocrystals of cellulose and nanochitosan for release of 
the active moieties when administered orally. 
Natural biopolymers, which include various saccharides and proteins, are derived 
from biological sources, including plants, animals, microbes, and seaweed (Balaji et al., 
2017; Bassas-Galia et al., 2017). The majority of nanoparticles that have a protein basis 
may be broken down, metabolized, and easily functionalized for coupling to certain 
medicines and other targeted ligands. They are often made using a pair of distinct 
approaches such as insoluble proteins, including zein and gliadin, as well as water-sol￾uble counterparts, including bovine and human serum albumin. In an effort to improve 
and accelerate their targeting strategy, the protein-based nanoparticles are typically 
arranged chemically to incorporate targeting ligands that specifcally recognize spe￾cifc cells and tissues (Lohcharoenkal et al., 2014). Similar to monosaccharides, poly￾saccharides are made up of sugar molecules joined together by O -glycosidic linkages. 
These polysaccharides can acquire a variety of distinct physical–chemical characteris￾tics due to the nature of their monomers in addition to their biological source. 
6.6 INORGANIC NANOPARTICLES FOR DRUG DELIVERY 
The inorganic nanoparticles are becoming more and more signifcant as nanocarri￾ers in drug delivery systems. Endocytosis, a method which enables nanoparticles to 
enter cells, has been demonstrated to have evidences of the function. The biodistri￾bution is determined by its size and surface characteristics when these nanoparticles

have been administered. Hence, nucleic acids could also be delivered into living cells 
using nanoparticles. Several inorganic nanoparticles have been employed as drug 
carriers because of the very sophisticated chemical characteristics that nanoparticles 
now possess. Inorganic nanoparticles like mesoporous silica nanoparticles, calcium 
phosphate, carbon nanotubes, double hydroxides, gold, silver, iron oxide, quantum 
dots, magnesium phosphate, and strontium phosphate all have been explored for 
their ability to carry DNA (Paul and Sharma, 2020). 
Considering the recent inorganic nanotherapeutics for drug delivery, Munaweera 
et al. have synthesized innovative wrinkled structured periodic mesoporous organo￾silica (PMO) nanoparticles for the administration of hydrophobic anticancer drugs. 
These cutting-edge wrinkled PMOs contain pore diameters, hydrophobicity, and 
surface areas that can be adjusted to facilitating the delivery of hydrophobic drugs. 
In comparison to mesoporous silica (MS) nanoparticles, the hydrophobic anticancer 
agent, paclitaxel, was employed as a standard drug, and the PMO demonstrates a 
better drug-loading effciency for paclitaxel (Munaweera et al., 2015a). Moreover, 
Munaweera et al. formulated a new type of platinum drug loaded with holmium in 
wrinkled mesoporous silica nanoparticles coated with a lipid coating or uncoating. 
The infuence was recognized as an anticancer treatment after in vitro platinum drug 
liberation from both lipids coated and uncoated with chemoradiotherapeutic wrin￾kled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Munaweera et al., 2014). In another related 
study, wrinkle-structured, amine-modifed mesoporous silicon (AMS) nanoparticles 
that release nitric oxide (NO) and cisplatin have been synthesized as an anticancer 
therapy for treatment of NSCLC (Munaweera et al., 2015b). 
6.7 VIRAL NANOPARTICLES FOR DRUG DELIVERY 
Viruses are supramolecular entities that have organized architectures and have unique 
functions and characteristics. Botanical viruses are frequently used in biotechnology, 
and genetic modifcation produces particulate debris that resembles viruses. Both 
provide a material-based method for therapeutic molecule delivery and dispersion. 
Viruses, especially noninfective viral-like nanoparticles (VLPs), are associated with 
these desirable traits. Viral nanoparticles (VNPs) are nanostructures produced by 
mammalian cells, plant cells, and bacteriophage viruses. VNPs are accelerating as 
nanotherapeutics in drug delivery due to the use and development of VNPs and asso￾ciated with their genome-free counterparts (Aljabali et al., 2021). 
Several active components may be encapsulated in VLPs, which can then be 
chemically or genetically coupled. VLPs were created using expandable fermenta￾tion or molecular farming, and the materials used are both biocompatible and bio￾degradable. Thus, substantial ongoing research is required to get these medicines 
to the clinical use (Chung, Cai and Steinmetz, 2020). Figure 6.2shows schematic 
illustration of nanocarriers used in drug delivery (Sultana et al., 2022). 
6 .8 NANOROBOTICS 
In contrast to other forms of nanomaterials commonly used in targeted delivery of 
pharmaceuticals, nanorobots have the potential to deliver drugs to disease areas with

solid nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles,

a lot of effectiveness and reduce systemic side effects. The nanorobots for active 
delivery of various drugs have advanced from test tubes to the cellular level over 
the last ten years. Several of these tools have even been successfully tried on live 
animals, which is promising. Furthermore, newly developed transient robots such 
as Mg/ZnO, Mg/Si, and Zn/Fe Janus particles can disintegrate into their respective 
environments without causing harm (Luo et al., 2018). 
Nanomotors exhibit autonomous self-propulsion through a process known as 
nanolocomotion, which can be defned as the mechanism that enables a nanoscale 
object to move forward through an anisotropic energy and is frequently aided by 
an asymmetric construction. Typically, nanomotors can be used for catalysis, 
biosensing, and site-specif c medicine delivery. The fundamental problems with 
current micro- and nanomotor platforms, which limit their potential for use in 
biological applications, appear to be their inability to achieve motion at a non￾toxic and neutral pH as well as their lack of biocompatibility (Munaweera et al., 
2016 ). 
In this case, Munaweera et al. have developed mesoporous silica nanomotors in 
gold/palladium-coated magnesium nanoparticles to produce hydrogen gas and per￾form nanolocomotion simultaneously in a neutral pH environment. The f ndings of 
this study, which employed aspirin as a common medication, demonstrate that the 
built-in nanomotor systems provide acceptable delivery platforms for the preserva￾tion of fuel and payload. This concept has high biocompatibility capabilities and can 
store payloads or fuel wherever needed (Munaweera et al., 2016).

7 Nanotherapeutics 
in Surgery 
INTRODUCTION
The defnition of surgery allows addressing physiologically and technologically sur￾gical management of certain injuries, deformations, and ailments. From just being 
“no more science than butchery,” surgical procedures has grown into an extremely 
renowned science as well as artistry. However, delicate microsurgeons may encoun￾ter concerns when operating tissues at the nanoscale due to the lack of knowledge in 
nanotechnological advancements. In conventional surgery that is also called an open 
surgery, the internal organs that need surgical intervention may be exposed due to 
the cutting of healthy tissues. Hence, there has been a shift in favor of minimally 
invasive techniques over the last 20 years. Minimally invasive nanosurgery has sev￾eral advantages, including less tissue damage and thus less scarring, fewer side effects 
and comorbidities, less postoperative discomfort, and faster recovery. Nowadays, the 
prime motivator is to reduce the invasiveness of surgery. One might envision a surgeon 
becoming able to alter and monitor individual cells by developing novel tools on the 
nanoscale. Nanotechnology has recently been used to improve surgical tools. Thus, 
using these nanotherapeutics-based surgical tools, the internal and external factors of 
the patient and the surrounding environment are crucially regulated (Shrikant, 2013). 
7.1 NANOSURGICAL TOOLS 
The nanosurgical tools are categorized depending on their invasive limits and levels. 
Nanotherapeutics-based surgical tools have progressed from nano-scalpel blades and 
nanotweezers to sophisticated techniques such as femtosecond lasers, surgical nanoro￾bots, and so on. When it comes to surgical treatments, diamond-coated nanomaterials 
made of hard metal can signifcantly improve the effectiveness of surgical blades. The 
minimal physical adherence to substances or biological membranes, as well as chemi￾cal and biological inertness of diamond nanolayers, are signifcant advantages of this 
technique. Moreover, diamond possesses a relatively low friction coeffcient, which low￾ers the required piercing force. The development of new manufacturing has enabled the 
production of surgical blades with cutting-edge diameters ranging from 5 nm to 1 μm. 
The diamond scalpels with sharp edges that are only a few atoms thick (about 3 nm) have 
been developed for use in ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and minimally invasive surgery. 
Both crystalline and polycrystalline materials have been employed in the fabrica￾tion of surgical blades used for ophthalmic surgeries with edge radii ranging from 5 
to 500 nm (Shrikant, 2013). The surgical blades are made either crystalline or poly￾crystalline silicon by assembling them and cutting tunnels into the silicon wafers. 
Every necessary angle may be produced with this technique, and the fnal blade has 
a sharp edge that is comparable to a blade with a diamond edge. These blades can

Nanotherapeutics in Surgery 83 
be utilized in a variety of diffcult surgical procedures, including cataract surgery. 
Nevertheless, these blades have a tendency to bend when they come into contact 
with tissues, which causes surgeons to apply greater power when cutting, raising 
the risk of tissue injury. Trephines with nanostructured carbon coatings have been 
designed to produce cutting edges with greater stability and diamond-like character￾istics (Lingenfelder et al., 2005; Shrikant, 2013). 
Femtosecond lasers are additionally being employed to cut single actin stress 
fbers and chromosomes in cells to analyze the morphology changes in the cell over 
time. Furthermore, they have used to maintain cell growth and division while remov￾ing mitochondria from living cells. It demonstrates how specifc organelles can be 
removed using lasers for nanosurgical procedures without compromising long-term 
survival (Juhasz et al., 1999). As demonstrated in nerve cells (Yanik et al., 2004), 
ultrashort pulse laser is capable of performing exceedingly accurate surgery and 
slicing nanosized cellular components. Conventional lasers often frst preheat the 
desired location before cutting it, although this causes a risk of tissue injury. The 
beneft of “nanoscissors” is that they can serve cell organelles despite of damaging 
the heathy tissue around them. The method makes use of a succession of low-energy 
near-infrared laser pulses that last for a few femtoseconds (0–15 femtoseconds). 
The less energy and brief laser pulse may greatly limit mechanical impacts, such 
as propagation of plasma and shock waves, accumulation of the heat, and prolonged 
thermal injury to the external environment of the tissue with comparison to other 
laser-surgery approaches (Colombelli, Grill and Stelzer, 2004). The femtosecond 
laser axotomy method could be used to investigate the processes that inf uence nerve 
cell growth and regeneration. Femtosecond laser devices are also used in dermato￾logical plastic surgeries (Kumru et al., 2005) and ophthalmic surgery for corneal 
refractive surgery. Figure 7.1shows the process of capsulotomy by femtosecond laser 
in the left eye of a human (Yu, Zhang and Zhu, 2020). 
A potent method for noninvasive handling of tiny sized objects in micro- or 
nanoscale, such as individual living cells, cellular components, organs, and microbes 
for employment of biological molecules in nanoscale is the single-gradient optical 
trap. They are also known as optical tweezers. Whenever a consistent wave laser 
beam collides with them, forces resulting from the motion of the light on its own 
can accurately relocate items by guiding the laser beam. Surgical instruments called 
nanotweezers may be employed to capture and transport individual biological mate￾rials inside the cells. Carbon nanotubes, for example, were attached to electrode ter￾minals to create these nanotweezers. Following that, the nanotubes are manipulated 
using electric forces to gain the ability of bending inward and capture the compo￾nents. The frst nanotweezers had a diameter of 50 nm and began working at 8.5 V 
(Kim and Lieber, 1999). It is possible to use nanotweezers to operate on individual 
cells. Mechanical operations of DNA molecules were accomplished using silicon 
nanotweezers, including an initial tip distance of 20 nm. The method was used to 
investigate the viscoelastic behavior of DNA bundles, yielding static results with a 
resolution greater than 0.2 nm (Yamahata et al., 2008). 
An automatic device which acts autonomously within the human body can be 
referred to nanorobots in surgery. They act as on-site surgeons within the human 
body and most of the times they have been programmed for surgical procedures by

a human surgeon. An on-board computer might conduct a number of tasks, includ￾ing screening and diagnostic tools, reveal pathogenic states, and eradicate or repair 
the abrasion by nanomanipulation, all the while staying in touch with the directing 
surgeon through ultrasound signals that are coded. Nanorobots would be performing 
delicate intracellular surgery far beyond the scope of what the human hand is capable 
of. Scavengers for atherosclerotic plaque are an example of how nanorobots can be 
used in surgical procedures. Stents used to place in interior arteries will be replaced 
by minimally invasive nanorobots, allowing for laparoscopic renovations. The use 
of nanoparticles during surgery already makes malignancies visible, allowing phy￾sicians to entirely eradicate them or perhaps even visibly examine for metastases 
throughout the body (Manjunath and Kishore, 2014). 
Research is being carried out on nanorobots to employ in retinal surgery as well 
as artif cial fagella that are developed to emulate natural bacteria in morphology 
and their motion style. Nanorobot aims to challenge the fundamental paradigm of 
contemporary medicine by employing in-body sensors that look for and eradicate 
microbes before the patient experiences any infective effects (Poorva Manjunath,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Surgery 85 
2014). Dendrites of a single neuron have been entirely severed using a fast oscillating 
(100 Hz) micropipette with a 1 μm tip diameter, all without compromising cell sur￾vival. Roundworm neurons were axotomized using femtosecond laser surgery, and 
the axons later functionally recovered (Manjunath and Kishore, 2014). 
7.2 SUTURE NEEDLES AND SUTURES 
Surgical needles and suture needles that are made of nanoscale stainless steel crys￾tals are already available on the market as nanosurgical items. Suture needles with 
high ductility, durability, and resistance to corrosion are excellent to be utilized in 
cosmetic and ocular surgery (Wilkinson, 2004). Needles are constructed of stainless 
steel, and through the use of thermal aging processes, nanosized particles with a size 
range of 1–10 nm that are quasi-nanocrystals obtain the aforementioned properties. 
Silver nanocoating over silk sutures is an innovative strategy for preventing surgical 
infections. 
Nanoneedles made of silicon that are coupled toward an atomic force micro￾scope have the potential to distribute chemicals into the nuclei of biological 
systems as well as being utilized to perform cell surgery. Such nanoneedles are 
200–300 nm in diameter and 6–8 μm in length. Nanoneedles were shown to pierce 
through the cellular layers rather than impact the plasma membrane or nucleus. 
Cell manipulation requires the least amount of cell deformation possible even 
though unintended mechanical reactions could affect the outcome of the manipu￾lation. Different molecules, including DNA, proteins, or drugs, can be mounted 
onto a nanoneedle by altering its surface using conventional immobilization meth￾ods (Shrikant, 2013). 
Nanoneedle-based atomic force microscopy is indeed a sort of microscopy that 
involves contacting and indenting the cell using an extremely slender nanoneedle 
to investigate certain characteristics. The probe is then scanned throughout the 
specimen to be operated to gain information about its own surface. Such surgi￾cal procedures could be used to prepare healthy cells for functional cell trans￾plantation to a patient by inducing differentiation using stem cells (Shrikant, 
2013). Figure 7.2shows porous silicon nanoneedles that are used in nanosurgeries 
( Chiappini et al ., 2015 ). 
Surgical sutures that are developed with advanced sophisticated technologies are 
fabricated using cutting-edge technologies. They have adequate mechanical capabil￾ities and the ability to elute drugs. For the treatment of postoperative complications 
and pain management, electrospinning drug-eluting sutures either with or without 
bupivacaine have been designed. Antibiotic-eluting sutures minimize the likeli￾hood of infection while achieving appreciable healing properties. Multif lament 
suture components pose a greater danger of infection. During eye surgery, absorb￾able antibiotic-eluting sutures containing poly(l-lactide), PEG, and levof oxacin are 
utilized successfully (Kashiwabuchi et al., 2017). Additionally, there are surgical 
sutures treating infections at the surgical site (SSI) that are wrapped using curcumin￾loaded gold nanoparticles (Sunitha et al., 2017). Heparin-immobilized nanof ber is 
employed as a suture application that are employed in cardiovascular compartments 
for cardiovascular diseases (Mariappan, 2019).

7.3 NANOFABRICATED DRAINS 
Catheters are tiny tubes that are introduced into the cavities or entries within the 
human body in order to deliver medicine, discharge, or maintain the debris free 
channel. The development of thrombus upon the outside surfaces of catheters is a 
major concern of their problems. In order to improve the durability and adaptability 
of catheters utilized in minimally invasive surgery and lessen their thrombogenic 
impact, nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, were effectively incorporated. 
The nucleation mechanism of carbon nanotubes has presumably improved electro￾static characteristics as well as dense surface topology, which are attributed to the 
antithrombotic characteristic. Silver nanoparticles may additionally be employed to 
wrap catheters to offer them antibacterial characteristics and inhibit the development 
of surface bioflm (Roe et al., 2008). 
Recently, nanofabricated drains have been used for the management of glaucoma. 
The gradual deterioration of vision in glaucoma is brought on by the chronically high  
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Surgery 87 
intraocular pressure, which also causes irreversible destruction of the optic nerve. In 
a recent investigation, the researchers have reported on an entirely novel concept for 
treating glaucoma that uses a nano-drainage apparatus made with MEMS and nano￾fabrication technology. This entails restoring the trabecular meshwork, which serves 
as the pathological drainage conduit for water-based f uid outfow. The synthetic 
drainage implant will lower intraocular pressure and prevent the growth of glaucoma 
by improving f uid outfow (Pan, Brown and Ziaie, 2006). 
7.4 MINIMAL INVASIVE SURGERIES 
Chemotherapy and surgery are common examples of conventional treatment meth￾ods that have serious adverse reactions and extreme pain. The development of nano￾therapeutics and minimally invasive treatments (MITs) has provided an inspiration 
for those suffering from serious disorders. Particularly, minimally invasive nano￾medicines (MINs) that merge the benefts of nanotherapeutics and MITs are capable 
of successfully targeting malignant cells, tissues, anatomical structures, and organs 
to increase drug bioavailability, reduce adverse effects, and accomplish pain-free 
therapies with a tiny incision or without incision, thus obtaining excellent therapeutic 
benef ts. 
Moreover, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical 
systems (MEMS) technologies have been recognized as a signif cant advancement 
in nanosurgery. Instruments produced at the nano- and microscales are referred to 
as NEMS and MEMS accordingly. Actuators, nanobeams, biosensors in nanoscale, 
pumps for various biological activities, resonators, and nanomotors are a few of the 
sophisticated, miniature electrical and mechanical components that comprise such 
systems. The ability of NEMS and MEMS to assess mechanical physiological fac￾tors, including pressure differences in cranial areas, pulsatility of cerebral spinal 
fuid (CSF) fuid, weight stress, and strain, is particularly intriguing to the f eld of 
neurosurgery (Mattei and Rehman, 2015). 
Scientists have already designed arrays that employed microelectrodes and nanow￾ires that can monitor potentials of electrical feld while also allowing the assessment 
of such crucial mechanical characteristics. Many approaches, including the biopoly￾mers included in these products, are being explored to address the consequences of 
these nanosurgical tools (Mattei and Rehman, 2015). 
Advances in NEMS technology is also being exploited as a way of mechani￾cal manipulation at the cellular as well as molecular level, in addition to their pro￾spective function in physiological screening. In almost an in vivo mouse model, it 
has been shown that a newly established nanoknife can chop particular axons upon 
peripheral nerves (Jourabchi et al., 2014). The potential uses of this technique in 
several subdisciplines of neurosurgery are promising. For instance, it would be an 
intriguing instrument for epilepsy surgery, in which the potential to precisely and 
selectively disassociate particular white matter bundles could result in both a marked 
merits in surgical outcomes and a signifcant decrease in the percentages of morbid￾ity related to present surgical techniques (Mattei and Rehman, 2015). 
Furthermore, noninvasive method of employing high-frequency alternating 
magnetic felds for the noninvasive treatment of prosthetic joint infections have  
 
 
 
 
 
88 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
been demonstrated recently. It has revealed that this innovative noninvasive treat￾ment is capable of eradicating the bioflms through the generation of heat (Chopra
 et al., 2017 ). 
7.5 OPTICAL NANOSURGERIES 
In optical nanosurgery, optical tweezers, also referred to as single-beam gradient 
force traps, are an effective tool with intensely concentrated laser beams. In addition 
to individual living cells or compartments encircled by cells, viruses, microbes, and 
micrometer-sized materials in the range of piconewtons, are employed for nonintru￾sive handling (Ashkin, Dziedzic and Yamane, 1987; Ashkin and Dziedzic, 1987). 
They are perfect for manipulating biological systems and structures at the nanoscale, 
such as DNA. By introducing an integrated heat shock-responsive gene encoding in 
nematodes, near-infrared continuous wave laser light using optical tweezers induces 
stress (Leitz et al., 2002). Tracking their motion allows monitoring of drug metabo￾lism as well as dissemination. Dye-coated cells illuminate when stimulated by light 
beam of a specif c wavelength. 
Human corneas have been sliced and reshaped using femtosecond lasers that 
address vision impairment. The endothelial tissues upon that surface of the cor￾nea had their injuries removed using a femtosecond laser (Juhasz et al., 1999). 
Moreover, ophthalmic nanosurgery observation is done using “Nano cameras,” 
while nanosurgical tools are controlled with computers (Afarid, Mahmoodi and 
Baghban, 2022). 
7.6 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN WOUND HEALING 
Millions of individuals experience slow wound healing, which raises mortality per￾centages and related costs globally. The absence of a cellular environment suitable 
for cell migration, cellular proliferation, and the process of angiogenesis; microbial 
infection; and unpredictable and persistent inf ammation seem to be the three main 
consequences linked to wounds. Regrettably, these fundamental issues have not 
been fully resolved by current therapeutic approaches, and as a result, their level of 
medical success is insuff cient. Signifcant outcomes have been achieved throughout 
time by incorporating the amazing capabilities of nanomaterials into wound heal￾ing. Nanomaterials can activate a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms that 
promote the microsetting of wound and may even shift the setting from nonheal￾ing toward healing via antibacterial, anti-infammatory, antifungal, and angiogenic 
activities. 
There is a research and knowledge gap for both the clear information regard￾ing mechanisms and post–wound adaptations. The majority of the literature con￾centrates on the advancement of hemostasis, anti-infective activity, immunological 
regulation, and cell proliferation. Due to their unusual physicochemical and biologi￾cal characteristics, nanoparticles (NPs) with highly specialized surface areas also 
indicated potential use in wound dressings for the sustained delivery and libera￾tion of therapeutic medicines. Moreover, NPs for wound healing have the ability to 
absorb radiation and light and convert it into thermal impulses or reactive oxygen  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Surgery 89 
species ROS, which fnally causes the bacterial growth in the wounds to terminate. 
Moreover, NPs may cooperate to fabricate a keen dressing for wound management 
that is dependent on endogenous stimuli, including pH, chemicals, temperature, 
enzymes, and toxic materials released by the bacterium, to cure microbial infections. 
Latest researches on laboratory rats using topical AuNPs to treat cutaneal lesions 
have shown enhanced healing, as evidenced by increased re-epithelialization, granu￾lation tissue development, deposition of extra cellular matrix, and collagen f ber den￾sity (Kushwaha, Goswami and Kim, 2022). 
The ability of AuNPs to treat wounds was considerably improved when they were 
combined with polymeric materials or stem cells. The free radical scavenging capac￾ity of AuNP was multiplied by chitosan–AuNP conjugation, which also increased 
biocompatibility (Kushwaha, Goswami and Kim, 2022). Compared to using con￾ventional chitosan and a Tegaderm dressing alone, an experiment on a laboratory rat 
surgical wound model showed that chitosan–AuNPs dramatically improved hemo￾stasis, development of epithelia along with a great healing effciency, and wound 
closure (Kushwaha, Goswami and Kim, 2022). In a different study on rats, wounds 
caused by burns were treated using AuNPs that had been coupled with human cryo￾preserved fbroblasts. The wounds displayed a rapid rate of healing, less amount of 
infammation, and more collagen deposition (Rajendran et al., 2018).
 Electrospun nanofber membranes are an emerging dressing type for postopera￾tive wound healing as well as other lesions. To gain antimicrobial activity within 
the wounds, these membranes can be reinforced with a variety of nanoparticles and 
nanocomposites. They can be employed to accelerate tissue proliferation and cell 
regeneration in wounds, as well as drain the exudates of the wounds by acting as 
an absorbent due to their high porosity. These electrospun membranes minimize 
the painful procedures of wound management as a new hope for surgical dressings 
(Liu et al., 2021). Figure 7.3 shows an electrospun membrane which is fabricated and 
tested for wound healing (Liu et al., 2021). 
Many researchers have chosen to combine the two types of fbers due to the 
advantages of easy deterioration and great biocompatibility of natural polymers 
along with the controllability and dependable mechanical durability of synthetic 
polymers ( Zhu et al., 2019). In order to create a coaxial electrospun core-sheath 
nanof ber flm with the antibiotic minocycline as well as herbal extracts that serves 
as a multifunctional scaffold to aid in the healing of secondary burns, Ramalingam 
et al. (Ramalingam et al., 2021) reported employing PCL/gelatin as a polymer vehi￾cle. The core-sheath construction keeps the biologically active chemicals released 
consistently. It additionally exhibits potent antibacterial activity and also encour￾ages epithelial cell proliferation and diffusion. The skin of pig with a second-degree 
burn injury can be used as a model to demonstrate how collagen tissue has grown 
in this condition. 
Furthermore, the ability to add a range of biologically active substances to create 
functionalized materials is another signif cant beneft of electrospinning to fabricate 
nanofber membranes for wound dressings. Recently, antibiotics, herbal extracts, and 
phytochemical substances like curcumin, inorganic NPs (AgNP, ZnO, TiO 2, AuNP), 
organic materials (honey, essential oils, chitosan), as well as growth factors are all 
frequently utilized active substances for enhancing the wound healing. Yang et al.

produced Janus nanof bers with ciprof oxacin and AgNP as the polymer framework 
using side by side the electrospinning method and investigated the impacts on the 
healing of wounds. The antibacterial action offers a fresh perspective for creating 
novel antibacterial dressings for wounds (Yang et al., 2020). On the basis of PCL and 
gelatin, Jafari et al. developed a bilayer nanofber framework. Amoxicillin is present 
in the top level, and n-ZnO is present at the bottom surface to hasten wound healing. 
Amoxicillin released over time, according to an in vitro test (Jafari et al., 2020).

INTRODUCTION 
Gene therapy is employed to manage a monogenic hereditary as well as acquired dis￾order by introducing therapeutic genes via either integrative or nonintegrative vectors. 
Integrative vectors are secured and modifed viral carriers that allow the delivery of a 
therapeutic transgene toward the DNA of the target cell. The therapeutic transgene is 
just not persistently expressed in the specifc target cell while using nonintegrative vec￾tor models. The transgenes that will be expressed and also the delivering vectors which 
will be employed will determine how well the gene therapy works. Gene therapy can 
be categorized in accordance with the selected delivery vector. Vector materials can be 
viral (integrative or nonintegrative) or nonviral, as was previously mentioned. Typically, 
viral vectors serve as integrative vectors where adeno-associated viruses, gamma retrovi￾ruses, foamy viruses, and lentiviruses can be showed as exemplif cations. Adenoviruses, 
herpesviruses, poxviruses, and vaccinia viruses are examples of viruses that can be uti￾lized as nonviral vectors. Nonviral vectors, typically relied on lipid molecules, polymers 
that have a cationic nature, as well as nanocarriers can be helpful when signif cant or 
sustained transgene expression is not required as the goal is to stimulate an immune 
response against the malignancies. Viral vectors are particularly helpful when signif￾cant and prolonged expression is necessary even though they offer greater consistency 
and higher degrees of transgene expression, although they are nonintegrative ( Prosen 
et al ., 2013 ; Liu and Zhang, 2011 ). 
There are two crucial elements that are necessary for effective gene therapy. They 
consist of both in vitro and in vivo gene delivery that is effective and secure. The 
effciency of the transduction, viral density when utilizing viral gene therapy, and the 
effciency of transfection while employing nucleic acids are needed to accomplish this 
objective. The effcient use of imaging techniques that are noninvasive is extremely 
important for detecting manipulated cells or modifying materials. It will really make 
it possible to monitor the gene delivery and their expression ( Do et al ., 2019 ). 
The utilization of magnetic nanoparticles to transfer genetic materials, nucleic 
acids, and viral vectors has been reported by numerous research groups in recent 
years, sparking the development of novel techniques known as magnetofection. 
Employing superparamagnetic nanoparticles in the viral and nonviral techniques is 
described as magnetofection to enhance gene transport in the magnetic f eld that 
exists. Figure 8.1shows a schematic illustration of the magnetofection by using mag￾netic nanoparticles in gene therapy ( Jinturkar, Rathi and Misra, 2011 ). 
Tiny ferromagnetic as well as ferrimagnetic NPs exhibit superparamagnetism. The mag￾netism of these nanoparticles may spontaneously reverse the direction when temperature 
infuences them if their dimensions are suffciently small. The Néel relaxation time is the

interval among two fips ( Deissler et al ., 2013 ). The term “superparamagnetic state” refers 
to nanoparticles that appear to have zero average magnetization when their measured mag￾netization duration is substantially longer when compared with the Néel relaxation time and 
when there is also no evident external feld of magnetism ( Deissler et al ., 2013 ). 
Superparamagnetism of magnetic substances that exhibit dimensions in the 
nanoscale seems to be a notion which explains that nanoparticles could be comprised 
of magnetic substances with appropriate small particle sizes. Moreover, they might 
exhibit superparamagnetic characteristics. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be 
coated with a suitable coating to formulate a ferrofuid, which can then be dissemi￾nated inside an aqueous solution that can be remained consistent. These ferrof uids 
may be employed in both in vitro and in vivo biomedical applications, especially in 
gene therapies ( Enriquez-Navas and Garcia-Martin, 2012 ). 
In a recent study, Gal-PEI-SPIO nanomaterials were developed, and siRNA￾encapsulated Gal-PEI-SPIO properties were examined. The results exhibited that 
the particles transport therapeutic siRNA to the liver cancer in a targeted manner 
by virtue of the iron oxide nucleus that has been altered by galactose (Gal) and 
polyethylenimine (PEI), which serve as shells (Yang et al., 2018). Another related 
study has been demonstrated by the safe and effcient magnetofection of both cells 
and tumors in laboratory mice using surface-modifed superparamagnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles (SPIONs) combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyethylenimine 
(PEI). In comparison to commercially accessible SPIONs, SPIONs-PAA-PEI had 
a higher transfection effciency when used in magnetofect cells alongside plasmid

DNA encoding reporter genes. A strong anticancer impact was seen after magne￾tofection of murine mammary adenocarcinoma containing plasmid DNA encoding 
IL-12 employing SPIONs-PAA-PEI. This technique could be improved for cancer 
immuno-gene therapy (Prijic et al., 2012). 
8.1 VIRAL MAGNETOFECTION 
Viral vectors, which can be categorized as integrative and nonintegrative vectors, 
constitute one of the most popular methods for delivering genes during gene and cel￾lular treatment strategies. The application of nonintegrative viral vectors as delivery 
systems for gene therapy has several benefts. The potential of insertional muta￾genesis is decreased as well as the therapeutic gene is expressed shortly as a result 
of their inability to integrate into the genomic materials of the host cells. This is 
enormously benefcial in circumstances that demand for quick action, like suicide 
therapy or even the commencement of cascade events. Whenever long-term effort 
is required, for instance, in the management of long-term illnesses, it might be a 
drawback. Adenovirus (Ad), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and vaccinia virus are 
the most prevalent types of nonintegrative viral vectors (VV). Nonintegrative vec￾tors are essential for immediate gene expression. Undesirable consequences and side 
effects will be mitigated by the insuffcient integration. Integrative vectors, which, 
on the other hand, are perfect where long-term expression is required. 
The integrative type of viral vectors is well-suited for usage as gene therapy and 
gene delivery systems due to their numerous strengths. The expression of the thera￾peutic gene for a long term is ensured by their capacity to integrate into the genomes 
of the host cells. This is enormously benefcial when treating chronic illnesses is nec￾essary. Nevertheless, insertional mutagenesis and other dangers are connected with 
the utilization of integrative viral vectors. Adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, and 
retrovirus are the most prevalent integrative viral vectors (AAV) (Crespo-Barreda
 et al., 2016 ). 
In a recent study, researchers have revealed how to successfully conquer trans￾duction impedance in skeletal muscle cells by designing recombinant adenoviral 
vectors using suitable iron oxide MNPs into magneto-adenovectors (RAd-MNP) 
and then subjecting them to a gradient magnetic feld. While contrasted with trans￾duction alongside naked virus, the expression of green fuorescent protein and insu￾lin-like growth factor 1 substantially rose after magnetofection using RAd-MNPs 
complexes in C2C12 myotubes in vitro and mouse skeletal muscle in vivo ( Pereyra
 et al., 2016 ). 
Tresilwised et al. investigated at a trio core–shell-type IO magnetic NPs with 
different surface coatings, particle dimensions, and magnetic characteristics to 
determine if they could boost the adenovirus Ad520’s oncolytic potency and keep 
it stable against the impacts of serum as well as a neutralizing antibody. It was dis￾covered that physical and chemical properties of magnetic NPs play a crucial role in 
determining the characteristics that control the oncolytic productivities associated 
with their complexes with Ad520. Even though a neutralizing antibody or exces￾sive serum concentration throughout infection experienced a strong inhibitory effect 
on the ingestion or oncolytic productivity of the naked virus, an individual particle  
 
 
 
 
 
96 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
kind was found to confer signifcant protection toward both inhibitory aspects while 
boosting the oncolytic productivity of the internalized virus. Following intratumoral 
injection through the complex with Ad520 along with magnetic feld impact, this 
particle category, which has a silica coating as well as adsorbed polyethylenimine 
and exhibits a signif cant magnetic moment with elevated saturation magnetization, 
mediates a 50% reduction in tumor growth rate compared to control, whereas Ad520 
alone is ineffective (Tresilwised et al., 2012). 
8.2 NONVIRAL MAGNETOFECTION 
Even though viral vectors exhibit a higher transfection effciency, they might have 
a greater immunogenicity and require complicated formulations (Mukherjee and 
Thrasher, 2013). In the laboratory conditions, nonviral vectors are developed from 
biocompatible starting materials. They exhibit poor cytotoxicity as well as dimin￾ished immunogenic activities compared to viral vectors, and their exterior chemical 
environment can be infnitely customizable, which may be advantageous for large￾scale production (Yin et al., 2014). 
The exterior interfaces of nanoparticles are designed and synthesized with poly￾mers that are cationic in nature to enhance the nucleic acid association, making them 
promising agents for gene delivery. These are extremely viable options to viral vec￾tors; however, before they can be used in clinical settings, more in vivo research is 
required. Lin et al. were among the innovators who used magnetofection for in vitro 
applications by employing nanoscale magnets (Lin et al., 2008). There are several 
different types of magnetic nanoparticles that are cationic in their nature that can 
bind nucleotypic substances to their surfaces. With this technique, the impact of 
an external magnetic feld concentrates the magnetic nanoparticles mostly in target 
cells (EMF). As internalization often occurs through endocytosis or pinocytosis, the 
structural features of the membrane are retained. Compared to other mechanical 
transfection techniques, this has an added beneft. Additional benefts include the 
short incubation period necessary for attaining effciency of high transfection and 
the low dose of the vector required to obtain the saturation yield. Furthermore, mag￾netic nanoparticle-transfected cells may be employed to pinpoint the targeted area in 
vivo by applying an EMF (Hen et al., 2012). 
On the other hand, organic or inorganic materials are also employed in this strat￾egy. They are made to attach and shield DNA or RNA, achieving great eff cacy, 
sustained gene expression, and low toxicological effects all at once. Polymers, den￾drimers, cationic liposomes, and other organic vectors can be exemplifed in this 
category. Due to the unique characteristics of their nanoarchitecture, these nanoma￾terials have a better capacity to transport genetic materials. 
Silica, iron oxide, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are 
a few examples of inorganic materials that are employed in gene therapy. Inorganic 
nanovectors offer a straightforward, manageable, and scalable synthesis proce￾dures. They also have excellent dispersion, a high capacity for cargo loadings, low 
immunogenic reactions, and low cytotoxic effects. The inorganic nanovectors might 
bind to DNA and RNA by electro or chemical reactions. These interactions enable 
the inorganic nanomaterial as well as the nucleotidic sequence that combines into  
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Gene Therapy 97 
a complex. The complex boosts transfection effectiveness and safeguards genetic 
material against enzymatic deterioration. Even though endocytosis seems to be the 
primary pathway by which nanovectors enter cells, some components, including 
antibodies, may be linked to the surfaces of nanomaterials to facilitate interactions 
with compounds on cell surfaces. Gene transfection seems to be more precise and 
successful when receptor mediation is present (Sunshine, Bishop and Green, 2011). 
Figure 8.2shows some exemplifcations of different nanoparticle types that are used 
in gene therapy. 
There are various factors that have to be taken into account in every situation, 
including the ratio of nanoparticles to nucleotidic substance, the coverage of the sur￾face charge, or the hydrophobic nature of the material. The endosomal exodus is the 
most important aspect for a successful transfection. As aforementioned, it is believed 
that the “proton sponge” plays a signif cant part in this phenomenon. It is crucial to 
enhance the properties of the surface of the nanoparticles for this technique with 
cationic polymers like PEI or poly-l-Lysine (PLL) (Benjaminsen et al., 2013). 
FIGURE 8.2 Examples of inorganic nanoparticles. There are many types of inorganic 
nanoparticles. In this fgure, we show several examples of them. In general, they act as nucleic 
acid vectors for in vitro or in vivo transfections.

8.3 EMERGING NANOTHERAPEUTICS AND 
APPLICATIONS IN GENE THERAPY 
As aforementioned, magnetic nanoparticles-based viral and nonviral magnetofec￾tion is an emerging technique that is used to make the gene therapies fruitful. These 
techniques have overcome several bottlenecks that are arisen with conventional 
approaches of gene therapy. It is evident with a number of successful researches 
based on nanotherapeutics associated with viral and nonviral magnetofection 
approaches in gene therapies. 
Many researchers have utilized the potent biotin–streptavidin interaction inside 
the context of viruses. Novel hybrid envelope proteins with a biotin motif are able 
to create retroviral and lentiviral vectors ( Hughes et al., 2001; Kaikkonen et al., 
2009; Weber et al., 2009). A persistent complex that is capable of being separated 
emerges from the coupling of this novel protein to the streptavidin nanoparticles. 
The transduction effciency of adenoviruses and retroviruses can be improved by 
magnetofection, according to several research (Bhattarai et al., 2008; Kamei et al., 
2009 ). Specifcally, when paired with magnetite nanoparticles, transduction of lenti￾viral vectors accelerates signif cantly under the infuence of magnetic f elds (Haim, 
Steiner and Panet, 2005). Including cells that are receptor-positive and receptor￾negative, magnetofection might increase the effciency of transduction of the para￾myxovirus measles virus approximately 30–70 times (Morishita et al., 2005). 
Bioconjugation, which is a process of conjugate nanoparticles and biological mate￾rials, including genes, can be described as a possible and direct correlation among 
the two substances including the aforementioned nanoparticle and the respective bio￾logical substance. The proper ratio of gene vectors polyelectrolyte-coated magnetic 
nanoparticles in a media consisting salt may be adequate to create their relationship by 
salt-induced colloid agglomeration (Plank et al., 2003). The freshly formulated “mag￾netic vectors” are incorporated into the cells that are cultured on magnetic culture 
plates after a brief incubation period. Such plates could be purchased commercially or 
they can be manufactured in laboratory settings with regular culture plates and pow￾erful Nd-Fe-B magnets. Currently, it is feasible to accelerate direct DNA transfection, 
the uptake of viruses by cells, and delivery of siRNA in the vicinity of a magnetic 
feld owing to commercially accessible magnetic substances. In other instances, the 
virus enters into the cell by a variety of routes when the magnetic feld is present, 
permitting nonpermissive cells to be infected. Figure 8.3shows various functional 
magnetite nanoparticles that are employed in gene therapy (Ito and Kamihira, 2011). 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the biological distribution of baculovirus 
in vivo offers an intriguing demonstration of the utilization of magnetic nanopar￾ticles for the creation of a persistent nanobioconjugate when considering the gene 
therapy (Räty et al., 2006). Commercial nanoparticulate superparamagnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles were the materials used in this research. This covalent method 
required functionalizing both the viral capsid and the nanoparticle. This virus dis￾played a strong affnity for biotinylated substances because it was coupled to avidin 
proteins (Räty et al., 2006). 
In order to transduce HepG2 cell lines, these investigators used baculoviruses, 
which are effcient vectors for gene transfer in vertebrate cells (Airenne et al., 2000).

Characterization of the interaction among the virus and the respective nanoparticles 
was done using atomic force microscopy (Sinha Ray, 2013). The outcomes demon￾strated that, on average, one to two virions per nanoparticle of the expected dimen￾sion were attached to the surface of the virus. Along with virions, superparamagnetic 
iron oxide nanoparticles of 42–67 nm were found. 
A recent publication that employed a similar procedure (Huh et al., 2007) used an 
adenovirus and hybridization of magnetic nanoparticle to formulate one bioconjugate 
also with twin functionalities of aim MRI and gene delivery. As magnetic nanopar￾ticles, the researchers used a combination of manganese and magnetism-engineered 
iron oxide (MnMEIO). Although the addition of manganese may increase toxico￾logical effects, MnMEIO is especially appealing due to its exceptional magnetiza￾tion in high mass value of 110 (emu/g of magnetic atoms) and remarkable magnetic 
resonance contrast properties (Huh et al., 2007. 
Superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been used in gene theranostics investiga￾tions, according to several researchers (Bhattarai et al., 2008; Jin and Ye, 2007; 
Chorny et al., 2009). Ionic interaction among the virus and the respective nanoparti￾cle should be employed as the second phase in the production and purifying of nano￾bioconjugates as applications in gene theranostics. While it continues to undergo 
development, this sophisticated and adaptable strategy has several benef ts. 
Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have indeed been utilized for gene transfer and imag￾ing. Even though this technique has not been extensively explored in MRI, mostly 
because the nanoparticles require a second alteration to be operative. AuNPs are a 
proven nanomaterials used in the technique for medication and gene delivery which 
was studied by various researchers recently (Cho et al., 2006; Conde, de La Fuente 
and Baptista, 2010; Ghosh et al., 2008). A fascinating publication by Kamei et al. 
(Kamei et al., 2009) demonstrated an excellent explanation of how gene therapy is 
promoted with nanotherapeutics and also how gold nanoparticles help to enhance the 
potential of various imaging techniques. This publication was halfway among both

magnetofection and synthesis of nanobioconjugate. The technique provides a base of 
magnetic iron oxide (g-Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) containing tiny gold nanoparticles anchored 
on it (hydrodynamic diameter of 240 nm). 
Additional AuNP-based methods rely on the direct attachment of DNA or 
RNA toward the interface and their initiation by light to liberate them. This tech￾nique has been employed using 780 nm nanorods attached to thiolated DNA and 
nanorods encapsulated with phosphatidylcholine for such an ionic contact with DNA 
(Takahashi, Niidome and Yamada, 2005). 
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) have been researched as siRNA deliv￾ery vehicles. For instance, to boost the positive charge on the nanoparticle surface, 
Hom et al. treated MSNs with PEI. Contrasting the cytotoxicological effects of their 
PEI–MSNs to certain other transfection agents such as Lipofectamine 2000 and PEI/ 
siRNA complexes, they demonstrated that with less toxicity profles. Moreover, their 
PEI–MSNs had a signifcant impact on the capacity to silence EGFP, Akt, and K-ras 
(Hom et al., 2010). Zhu et al. who employed PLLNPSNs to attach and shield c-myc 
antisense oligonucleotides got similar outcomes. In HNE1 and HeLa cell lines, they 
discovered a considerable downregulation of c-myc mRNA ( Zhu et al., 2004). 
Graphene oxide as well as carbon nanotubes (CNT) represent intriguing pros￾pects for use in biomedical applications, including scaffolds and implantable 
devices. Carbon atoms are grouped in compressed atomic rings to form CNTs. 
They can indeed be arranged as either single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) 
or multiple concentric sheets that are rolled up to forming cylinders (MWNTs). A 
total of 107 CNTs can be functionalized to make them more soluble and to make 
nucleic acid binding easier (DNA, siRNA, etc.). The most noteworthy accomplish￾ment with binding nucleic acids was already achieved with MWNTs, where Siu 
et al. had been capable of binding siRNA to SWNTs for managing the treatments 
for melanoma, displaying a decline in the signifcant tumor development in a time 
interval of 25 days. All these types of CNTs were utilized to attach nucleic acids 
( Siu et al ., 2014 ). 
Quantum dots (QDs) can be described as semiconductor nanoparticles capable of 
being utilized as markers for bioimaging photoluminescence. These QDs are crys￾talline nanoparticles within 2 and 10 nm. The electronic characteristics of these 
nanomaterials fall in the range of discrete molecules as well as bulk semiconduc￾tors. Due to the liberation of cadmium into the cellular environments or organs, 
the fundamental issue with QD utilization in biomedical applications concerns their 
toxicity. However, their surface modifcation and functionalization may mitigate this 
issue and also enable the attachment of various biomolecules, especially genes and 
nucleic acids. 
The rupture of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the neuroinf ammation which 
arise in many disorders are caused by the matrix-degrading metalloproteinases 
(MMPs). With the purpose of suppressing the MMP-9 protein and preserving the 
integrity of the BBB, Bonoiu et al. employed QDs with MMP-9 siRNA. They suc￾cessfully suppressed about 80% of genes in microvascular endothelial cells of the 
brain using QD (BMVECs). The capacity of nanoplexes to integrate diagnostic and 
therapy offered them a signifcant advantage over all the other therapeutic approaches 
( Bonoiu et al ., 2010 ).

Nanotherapeutics in 9 Cancer Therapy 
INTRODUCTION
Despite signifcant technological advances in the feld of medicine, there are currently 
only a few effective cancer treatments available. Metastasis of cancers and recur￾rence play a signifcant role in morbidity and mortality, albeit the precise processes 
are still unclear. Gene mutations are typically thought to be the major cause of cancer. 
According to the recent census reports, 9.6 million people died due to cancers in 2018 
and it estimates 18.1 million of new cases per annum (Sung et al., 2021). The Global 
Cancer Observatory (GCO) predicts that 30 million people worldwide will die because 
of cancers annually by 2030 (Sung et al., 2021). Cancer has a high mortality rate, and it 
also imposes a heavy fnancial cost on civilization. The economic burden for the fami￾lies of the patients who suffer from cancers are also considerable. As a result of those 
impacts, attempts to avert, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for cancers are crucial. 
Surgical removal of the tumors, chemotherapy, radiation therapies, and biological 
therapy associated with various drug regimens are frequently employed as anticancer 
treatments (Xu et al., 2014). Malignant and substantial tumors can be successfully 
removed with surgery, especially when the cancer remains in its initial stages. Surgery, 
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can be combined together to enhance the therapeutic 
outcome and the quality of the life of patients (Pérez-Herrero and Fernández-Medarde, 
2015). Figure 9.1shows the timeline of nanotherapeutics up to date.
 Insuff cient specifcity, cytotoxic effects, short half-lives, solubility issues, the 
development of multidrug resistance, as well as the proliferation of stem-like cells are 
drawbacks with conventional chemotherapy. Nanotherapeutics-based chemotherapy, 
molecular therapy, targeted therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemodynamic 
therapy (CDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) all are 
employed in anticancer therapy in order to circumvent these drawbacks ( Obireddy 
and Lai, 2021). Furthermore, a signifcant number of researches have been conducted 
recently on a range of cancer alternative treatments, including molecular treatment, 
apoptosis modulation, immunological therapies, therapies regarding signal and 
responses modifcation, nucleic acid–associated therapy, and antiangiogenesis ther￾apy ( Maeda et al ., 2000 ; Zhao et al ., 2022 ). With the development of nanotechnology, 
nanotherapeutics reinforced in cancer treatment may lessen the detrimental effects of 
chemotherapy, and substantial research has been done in this arena. 
9.1 EMERGING TYPES OF CANCERS THAT ARE TREATED WITH 
NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanotherapeutics seem to possess the capacity to provide many more important 
advances in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment therapies of cancer with vast

and specialized research paths earmarked for the future as well as the possibilities 
of nanotherapeutic-based prevention for cancers. Considering the recent nanothera￾peutics-based anticancer researches, Munaweera et al. have synthesized innovative 
wrinkled structured periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) nanoparticles for the 
administration of hydrophobic anticancer drugs. These cutting-edge wrinkled PMOs 
contain pore diameters, hydrophobicity, and surface areas that can be adjusted to 
facilitating the delivery of hydrophobic drugs. In comparison to mesoporous silica 
(MS) nanoparticles, the hydrophobic anticancer agent, paclitaxel, was employed as 
a standard drug, and the PMO demonstrates a better drug loading eff ciency for 
paclitaxel (Munaweera et al., 2015a). Moreover, Munaweera et al. formulated a new 
type of platinum drug loaded with holmium in wrinkled mesoporous silica nanopar￾ticles with a lipid coating or without any coating. The infuence was recognized 
as an anticancer treatment after in vitro platinum drug liberation from both lipids 
coated and uncoated chemoradiotherapeutic wrinkled mesoporous silica nanopar￾ticles (Munaweera et al., 2014a). 
Furthermore, it is important to analyze the recent advancements in nanotherapeu￾tics for anticancer therapies according to the anatomical categorization of cancers. 
Brain cancer is one of the most lethal tumors affecting low- and middle-income econ￾omies. It accounts for 9–17% of all cancer cases globally. Glioblastoma multiforme, 
which accounts for 12–15% including all brain cancers that are observed in adults 
were reported, is an initial brain tumor that has metastasized. According to Leece 
et al. 16,050 fatalities and 23,770 incidence of brain cancer were recognized in  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
106 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
2016 (Leece et al., 2017). The anatomical position of the brain and its intracranial 
location make brain cancer complicated to address. The incapability of the anticancer 
drug to penetrate the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is the main obstacle and the reason 
for the low life expectancies for patients with brain cancer (Lin and Kleinberg, 2008). 
There are three potential mechanisms for localized medication delivery in anti￾cancer therapy, including passive and active targeting with nanoparticles and nanon￾theranostic agents. Because the nanomaterials induce the positive accumulation of 
the drug at the tumor locations, passive targeting seems to be the best way to admin￾ister nanopharmaceuticals to intracranial malignant tumors for effective transport 
across the BBB. Nanomaterials that are administered intravenously (i.v.) take advan￾tage of the increased penetration ability and retention to get close to the tumor cells. 
Carmustine-loaded PLGA nanoparticles with O6-benzylguanine preparation were 
administered intravenously and had a greater benefcial impact than when these two 
medications were administered separately in a nanoparticle form (Qian et al., 2013). 
Nanotheranostics are medications and diagnostic agents that are delivered by only 
one type of nanoparticle for the treatment of brain cancer (Meyers et al., 2013). 
Employing MRI and polymeric nanomaterials coated with iron oxide nanoparticles, 
photofrin encapsulation was used in PDT to accumulate surface-decorated malig￾nant tumor vasculature-targeting F3 peptide inside the intracranial tumor. Especially 
opposed to PDT or photofrin individually, this theranostic improved the rate of sur￾vival in the 9L glioma rat model during PDT (Reddy et al., 2006). 
For the administration of doxorubicin, that featured a low capacity of drug load￾ing and was diffcult to regulate the profle of drug release. Gulati et al. fabricated 
titanium wires to serve as nanotube clamps or nanocarriers as drug delivering agents. 
Titanium wires with a 0.75 mm its thickness and a 30 mm in length were anodized 
using an automated electrochemical process, resulting in arrays of titania nanotubes 
with a diameter of 170 nm that might load up to 1200 g of the chemotherapy drug 
doxorubicin. The developed nanoengineered wires demonstrated sustained drug lib￾eration for eight days, were mechanically stable for the loading capacity of doxorubi￾cin, and were proven to be biocompatible (Gulati, Aw and Losic, 2012). 
The most common cancer among women worldwide and the second greatest rea￾son of death among them is breast cancer. An incidence of 1.5 million for breast 
cancer are recorded annually, and the prevalence of this cancer has increased by up 
to 20% over the last ten years (Torre et al., 2017). Nanotherapeutics, in addition to 
a combination treatment strategy, aid in overcoming the problems associated with 
anticancer medication resistance. One of the worst cancers and one that can be chal￾lenging to cure if it spreads to other parts of the body is breast cancer. Important 
anatomical structures and organs like the liver, heart, lung, and bones are susceptible 
toward its progression and spreading. In the treatment of breast cancer, it is crucial 
that the nanoformulations be formulated and administered in a way that allows it to 
adequately reach the cancerous site without causing any adverse reactions. 
PLGA nanoparticles containing mannose and abraxane, correspondingly, engage 
the TAM and EPR in effcient distribution of the anticancer medicines, Paclitaxel 
and Doxorubicin (Cullis et al., 2017). Parallel to this study, the nanoformulation of 
CRLX101 (an experimental nanoparticle)–camptothecin combination was evaluated 
individually or in conjunction with bevacizumab (an antiangiogenic medication) by  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Cancer Therapy 107 
using a breast cancer–induced laboratory mouse model. This CRLX101 nanoformu￾lation improved susceptibility of cancers to bevacizumab, increased the perfusion 
of tumors, and lowered hypoxia through effectively inhibiting the hypoxia-inducible 
factor-1 (Pham et al., 2016). 
An incidence of 1.3 million cases of prostate cancer were identifed in 2018, 
indicating that it is the most prevalent cancer afficting males (Rawla, 2019). The 
prevalence of prostate-specifc antigen (PSA) detection in men is lacking evidence 
of prostate cancer that has caused age-related incidence (those older than 65) lev￾els of the disease to surge dramatically. A group of scientists have designed silver 
nanoparticles (100 nm) from an aqueous herbal extract of Alternanthera sessilis , and 
the generated nanoparticles exhibited remarkable action against PC3 prostate cells 
(Firdhouse and Lalitha, 2013). Corresponding to this, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) 
that are bound to glucose with increased toxicity and responsiveness to the DU-145 
prostate cancer cell type were developed. Moreover, another research revealed that 
the nanoparticles in 50 nm in size without a PEGylated surface demonstrated remark￾able cellular absorption of AuNPs in the PC3 prostate cell line 344 E. Furthermore, 
it was established that the docetaxel-encapsulated AuNPs antineoplastic medication 
exhibited promising outcomes (Arnida and Ghandehari, 2010). 
A majority of lung cancers, nearly 85%, are categorized as non-small cell (NSLCC), 
making it the most common reason for mortality rate of cancers in the United States 
(NSCLC). In a recent study, holmium-165 (Ho), which can be neutron-activated to gen￾erate the holmium-166 radionuclide, as well as a platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapeutic 
agent have been combined to form a garnet magnetic nanoparticle (HoIG-Pt) in order to 
obtain selective distribution to tumors utilizing an external magnet ( Munaweera et al ., 
2015 b). In another related study, wrinkle-structured, amine-modifed mesoporous sili￾con (AMS) nanoparticles that release nitric oxide (NO) and cisplatin have been syn￾thesized as an anticancer therapy for treatment of NSCLC ( Munaweera et al ., 2015 a). 
Another type of most common cancer globally is skin cancer. The most preva￾lent kinds of cancers found on the skin nowadays are melanoma and nonmelanoma, 
which have surpassed epidemic proportions. Due to the signifcant increase in skin 
cancer cases and the absence of effective drug distribution systems, scientists are 
conducting more studies to establish skin cancer treatment plans relying on nano￾therapeutics (Khan et al., 2022). According to recent research, the investigators 
have revealed that a bandage made of nonradioactive holmium-165 (165Ho) iron 
garnet nanoparticles can be placed on a tumor lesion after being neutron-activated to 
become 166Ho in skin cancers (Munaweera et al., 2014b). 
Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are also a signifcant type of cancer which affect the 
anatomical structures and major organs in the GI tract. Gastrointestinal malignan￾cies are aggressive tumors that have a high mortality rate as well as high morbidity. 
Iron oxide NPs are utilized in colorectal, liver, and gastric cancers in order to detect 
the specifc biomarkers and evaluate the anticancer therapy. QDs are also employed 
in the same types of cancers, especially for the targeting and imaging of the cancer 
cells. In colorectal and liver cancers, carbon nanotubes are used for tumor localiza￾tion. AuNPs are important in photothermal and hyperthermal destruction of tumor 
and cancer cells. Nanoshells, dendrimers, and polymeric NPs also exhibit same 
functions toward the cancer cells and tumors (Liang et al., 2022).  
 
 
 
 
108 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
The world cancer report of 2020 which is published by the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer (IARC) of World Health Organization (WHO), colorec￾tal, liver, gastric, and esophageal cancers are ranked third, sixth, ffth, and eighth, 
respectively, in regard to total cancer morbidity (Liang et al., 2022). Throughout the 
world, 0.94, 0.83, 0.77, 0.54, and 0.47 million people die from colorectal, liver, gas￾tric, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers, respectively (Liang et al., 2022). 
9.2 ANTICANCER MECHANISMS OF NANOMATERIALS 
Passive targeting mechanisms, active targeting mechanisms, and mechanisms based 
on triggered release are the prominent types of targeting used to deliver nanopar￾ticles to tumor tissues. 
9.2.1 PASSIVE TARGETING MECHANISMS 
Large pores that are located intracellularly, endothelial cells that are interrupted, 
leaky vasculatures, and high permeability all are evident in tumor cells as a result of 
the deformed walls of vascular endothelium of tumorous tissues, impaired cell-to-cell 
connections, and defective lymphatic drainage (Yang et al., 2017). Nanoparticles can 
concentrate or be accumulated in tumor cells owing to these distinguishing char￾acteristics of tumor cells. The improved permeability and retention phenomenon, 
FIGURE 9.2 Passive targeting mechanisms of nanotherapeutics in anticancer therapies.

of Chemistry.  
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Cancer Therapy 109 
usually known as EPR, is the mechanism behind passive targeting. This technique 
prevents damage to the healthy tissues located around the tumor tissue. As a result, 
the detrimental impacts of chemotherapy are decreased by allowing the cytotoxic 
medications transported by the nanoparticles to concentrate where they are necessary. 
Recent research revealed that such medications can be accumulated into tumor tissues 
using nanoparticles with a size range of 10–100 nm (Danhier, Feron and Préat, 2010). 
Other aspects include various kinds of tumor, tumor size, and heterogeneity of 
tumors that have an impact on the EPR mechanism. This results in variations in the 
biodistribution of various nanoparticles and a lack of consistency (Shi et al., 2017). 
Figure 9.2shows a schematic diagram of passive targeting mechanisms of nano￾therapeutics in anticancer therapies. 
9.2.2 ACTIVE TARGETING MECHANISMS 
This stratagem relies on the alteration of the nanoparticle and its surface by the 
application of particular ligand conjugation. Such changes enable selective binding 
to receptors present at the target region. The method distinguishes between cancer￾ous and normal cells based on a specifc chemical released on the surfaces of cancer￾ous cells and tumors. The cells are stimulated to take up the nanocarrier and induce 
FIGURE 9.3 Active targeting mechanisms of nanotherapeutics in anticancer therapies. 
 Source: Reproduced with permission from Nirmala et al., 2023. Furthermore, active targeting facilitates 
the distribution of particles like proteins and nucleic acids that are unable to pass through cellular mem￾branes on their own (Sykes et al., 2014). Besides, it reduces the multidrug resistance (MDR) because 
proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which promote resistance are unable to expel drug or the conjugate 
of drug and polymer nanoparticles that invaded the cell through endocytosis. Tumor cells tend to dis￾play one or more surface molecular structures and behaviors, providing locations for active targeting 
( Blagosklonny, 2003 ).  
 
 
 
110 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
the cell death when the altered ligands upon this nanoparticle surface attach to these 
particular receptors. The absorption of mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is 
reduced as a result of this mechanism, lengthening the duration that blood circulates. 
Figure 9.3shows a schematic diagram of active targeting mechanisms of nanothera￾peutics in anticancer therapies. 
9.2.3 MECHANISMS BASED ON STIMULI RESPONSIVE RELEASE 
Both internal and external triggers can cause nanocarriers to modify. Target tissues 
may experience a variety of internal triggers, including pH, ionic strength, redox 
potential, and stress—similar to how diverse external stimuli such as magnetic 
felds, electric felds, light, ultrasound and temperature can cause the medication to 
be released (Cai et al., 2008). 
9.3 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR EARLY CANCER DETECTION 
Many types of nanoparticles are recently employed for molecular imaging as a result 
of the recent surge in interest in the utilization of nanotherapeutics in detection and 
diagnosis of cancer and monitoring. They have become more popular in recent 
cancer research and detection of cancers because of their perks, including tiny size, 
strong biocompatibility, and high values of atomic number. Semiconductors, quan￾tum dots, iron oxide nanocrystals, gold nanoparticles, and related formulations are 
a few examples of nanotherapeutics-based materials utilized in cancer treatment. 
They impose structural, optical, or magnetic features that are uncommon in other 
molecules (Popescu, Fufă and Grumezescu, 2015). A variety of antitumor medica￾tions and biomolecules can be combined with nanoparticles to identify highly spe￾cifc tumors, which are helpful for early identifcation and screening of tumor cells 
(Singh, 2019). Nanotherapeutics-assisted screening of tumor tissue has allowed 
for the early detection of malignancy in cancer diagnosis. It is possible to identify 
metastases in lung cancer by creating immunological superparamagnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles (SPIONs) which may be employed in MRI imaging and have cancer 
cell lines as their target (Wan et al., 2016). Recent research has demonstrated that 
SPIONs have a high amount of selectivity and relatively low number of adverse 
effects, rendering them appropriate basic components for aerosols in MRI imaging 
of lung cancer (Sherry and Woods, 2008). Using tomographic imaging techniques, 
magnetic powder scanning has also demonstrated great resolution and sensitivity to 
tumor tissues (Jin et al., 2020). In experiments engaging laboratory animals, nebu￾lization of the lungs was already accomplished utilizing magnetic nanoparticles 
(MNPs) that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein, a protein 
that is frequently found in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
On the basis of amphiphilic dendritic molecules that are self-assembled, in vitro 
investigations employing nanosystem for positron emission tomography (PET) 
were additionally established. These dendritic molecules organize on their own to 
form regular supramolecular nanoparticles with hundreds of PET indicating units 
on the exterior surface. The dendritic nanoscale system successfully aggregates in 
tumors by utilizing dendritic multivalence as well as the increased penetration and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Cancer Therapy 111 
retention (EPR) impact. Moreover, it results in exceptionally sensitive and specif c 
monitoring of diverse malignancies while lowering treatment toxicities (Garrigue 
et al., 2018). 
According to recent studies, cancer detection at the cellular, tissue, and molecular 
stages can be validated by nanotechnology (Garrigue et al., 2018). This is facili￾tated by the capability of nanotechnology in its implementations to investigate the 
surroundings of the tumor. For example, the pH sensitivity to f uorescent nano￾probes is able to identify fbroblast-triggered protein-A on the cellular membranes 
of tumor-associated fbroblasts (Ji et al., 2013). Nanotechnology-related spatial and 
temporal approaches, such as nanoshells, near-infrared quantum dots, and colloidal 
gold nanoparticles, could enable identifying precisely the living cells and observing 
dynamic biological events in tumor environment. 
Cancer biomarkers are biochemical characteristics whose appearance indicates 
the presence or stage of a tumor. These indicators are employed to study the cel￾lular mechanisms, track or detect changes in cancer cells, and also the outcomes 
may eventually assist in comprehending malignancies. Proteins, amino acids, pro￾tein fragments, or DNA all can be used as biomarkers. Investigations are possible on 
tumor biomarkers, which are signs of a tumor to confrm the existence of particular 
malignancies. Nanoparticles interact with carrier proteins by virtue of their surface 
properties, including electric charge or active biomolecules. Mesoporous silica par￾ticles, hydrogel nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes presently possess these proper￾ties (Geho et al., 2005). 
Enhancing the sensitivity of mass spectrometry is another technique for improv￾ing screening with nanocarriers. The distinctive optical as well as thermal charac￾teristics of carbon nanotubes improve the ability of the analyte to transmit energy, 
leading to its absorption and ionization, and obviating the interference of native 
matrix ions (Najam-ul-Haq et al., 2007). Using nanotechnology to create lab-on-chip 
microfuidic devices which may be utilized for screening of immunological features 
and functions or to research the characteristics of tumor cells is another strategy. For 
instance, the lab-on-a-chip for excellent performance of multimodal protein iden￾tifcation by utilizing quantum dots has been investigated. It consists of cadmium 
selenide (CdSe) nucleus with a shell made of zinc sulfde (ZnS) and connected to 
antibodies. These antibodies are attached to carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer anti￾gen 125, and Her-2/Neu (Jokerst et al., 2009). This device exhibits potentialities as a 
device for anticancer therapies. 
9.4 NANOCARRIERS FOR TARGETED CANCER THERAPY 
The effectiveness of immunotherapy as an anticancer treatment has the capabil￾ity to be greatly enhanced by nanomaterials. Vaccines used for cancers and tumor 
microenvironment (TME) regulation are two components of cancer immunotherapy. 
Cancer vaccines are designed to deliver cancer antigen to DCs and stimulate a strong 
effector T-cell response; meanwhile TME manipulation seeks to increase the capac￾ity of cytotoxic T cells for the death of cancer cells. Additionally, certain cells can 
uptake nanoparticles that have been preloaded with targeted ligands (Melero et al., 
2014). It is noteworthy that recent research revealed the creation of a d-enantiomeric  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
112 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
supermolecule nanoparticle, which demonstrated p53-dependent antiproliferative 
effect and improved immunity in cell. The ability of nanoparticles to transport tumor 
antigens will aid immunotherapy, and owing to their unique properties, they can 
also control the immune reactions (Yan et al., 2020). It ought to be noted that the 
PC7A nanoparticles stimulated the mechanism for the modulator of interferon genes, 
which helped the antitumor immunotherapy work effectively (Luo et al., 2017). 
Liposomes, porous silica nanoparticles, micelles, nanoemulsions, polymeric nano￾materials, dendrimers,carbon nanotubes, carbon nanomaterials, extracellular vesicles, 
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) nanoparticles, quantum dots, metallic nanoparticles, 
organic and inorganic nanoparticles, lipid-based nanomaterials, nanogels, nanocap￾sules, and DNA nanococoons are some of the major nanocarriers that play a crucial 
role in drug and gene delivery treatments related to anticancer therapies (Oon and 
Chan, 1990). 
9.5 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR CANCER RADIOTHERAPY 
An essential component of anticancer treatment is radiotherapy. The advancement 
of the area was fueled by discoveries in physics, chemistry, engineering, and biol￾ogy. The continuing incorporation of innovations from other sectors will be essen￾tial for the development of radiation oncology. Nanotherapeutics is a recent branch 
of science that has the potential to infuence radiation oncology. Materials with 
unique features with the dimensions in nanoscale, including superparamagnetism, 
increased penetration, and retention effect are quite well-adapted to be employed 
in radiation oncology. According to Barcellos-Hoff et al., radiotherapy constitutes 
one of the most popular and effcient cancer treatment techniques (Barcellos-Hoff 
et al., 2005). Currently, 60% cancer victims undergo radiotherapy as part of their 
anticancer therapies (Schaue and McBride, 2015) that is delivered via a variety of 
modalities, such as brachytherapy (internal radioactive source) and exterior beam 
(photons, protons, and electrons). 
In order to increase the antitumor effectiveness of radioisotopes or radiosensitiz￾ers, nanomaterials can be employed to enhance their distribution and accumulation. 
Recent research on the impact of radiotherapy on microenvironments of cancerous 
tumors has also sparked curiosity about alternative radiotherapy adjuvant therapy, 
particularly those that combine radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiation therapy 
increases the exposure to and expression of tumor antigens that prompts the activa￾tion of cytokines and the mobilization of immune cells. 
It is commonly known that radioisotopes (radionuclides) are used in clinical set￾tings. DNA single-strand breaks are brought about by radioactive isotopes, which 
release energy out from nucleus and produce ionized atoms as well as free radicals. 
Beta-emitters, including 186Re, 188Re, 166Ho, 89Sr, 32P, and 90Y, as well as alpha-emit￾ters, including 225Ac, 211At, and 213Bi, are radioisotopes used in clinical oncology 
( Hamoudeh et al ., 2008 ). 
Nevertheless, radioisotopes can circumvent these biological removal processes by 
packing or combining the nanocarriers. For instance, while the physiological half-life 
of 89Sr is 50.5 days, its plasma clearance takes on average 47 hours. Given their dis￾tinctive pharmacokinetic features and the enhanced adverse effects, nanostructures  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Cancer Therapy 113 
like liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, or polymeric complexes are often larger than 
10 nm, which signifcantly reduces the renal clearance and extends their half-life in 
systemic environment (Kim, Rutka and Chan, 2010). 
The transport of radiosensitizers toward the intended location of tumor can be 
impacted by nanotherapeutics. For instance, wortmannin inhibits phosphatidylinosi￾tol 3′-kinases and kinases linked to phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinases, including DNA￾dependent protein kinases. Preclinical outcomes have demonstrated its potency as a 
radiosensitizer. However, due to solubility issues, instability, and high toxicological 
effects, its clinical applicability is constrained. These issues were resolved by cre￾ating wortmannin with nanoparticles, which has an PLGA polymer center and a 
DSPE-PEG lipid exterior. The nanoradiosensitizer was shown to be more eff cacious 
than 5-FU, and its MTD was many times higher than that of wortmannin in labora￾tory mice with KB cell xenografts (Karve et al., 2012). Nanoradiosensitizers proved 
its ability to destroy hypoxic tumor cells when combined with tirapazamine due to 
their synergistic effects (Liu et al., 2015). Research is being done on the possibility 
of additional inorganic nanoparticles, such as Y2O3 and ZnFe2O3, in radiotherapy 
( Meidanchi et al ., 2015 ). 
Negative consequences of radiological therapies may be reduced by reducing 
the dispersion of radiosensitizers or radioisotopes in healthy tissues and by limiting 
the discharge of these radiotherapeutic compounds (Win and Feng, 2005). Adverse 
effects of radiation therapy are frequently brought on by unanticipated damage to 
healthy tissue. In numerous physiological areas, including the epidermis, lungs, and 
heart, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to have decreased penetration into reg￾ular vasculature and capillaries (Eblan and Wang, 2013). As a result, longer exposure 
to the substances caused by the regulated and continuous liberation of nanomaterials 
into the tissue has been associated with benefcial effects and greater tolerance for 
healthy tissue. This was proven through the clinical application of Doxil with dif￾ferent nanoparticles, which signifcantly decreased the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin 
while maintaining its antitumor activity (Barenholz, 2012).

Nanotherapeutics in 10 Infl ammatory Diseases 
INTRODUCTION
Infammation that can be described as a defense mechanism occurs naturally in the 
human body. It is essential for defending tissues from injury and infection by promot￾ing tissue repair. It boosts the responsive reactions of immune cells and blood supply 
to injured areas. Hence, infammation is crucial to the recovery process and required 
for sustaining human life. However, it can develop inadvertently in the human body, 
leading to chronic infammatory illnesses or persisting even after the initial trigger of 
infammation has subsided (Goldstein, Snyderman and Gallin, 1992; Medzhitov, 2008).
 Infammation can be divided into two categories according to the duration that it lasts: 
acute infammation, which lasts just a short time, such as in allergic reactions. Other cat￾egory is chronic infammation, which lasts for several months or even years. Chronic 
infammation can be described as a serious illness that can seriously harm the organ or 
tissue that is afficted. According to WHO, chronic diseases constitute a danger to human 
wellness since they claim the lives of three individuals of every fve individuals globally 
(Jogpal et al., 2022). Chronic infammatory illnesses have grown in incidence and preva￾lence during the past few decades, particularly in Westernized nations (Jogpal et al., 2022). 
Nanotherapeutics are a novel kind of drug distribution system which might 
enhance therapeutic bioavailability and improve pharmacokinetics and pharmaco￾dynamics (PKPD) of the drugs. These features are enhanced with their signif cant 
capacity of drug-loading and potential for targeted selectivity for specif c cells 
and tissues. Phytochemical substances are also identifed as promising therapeutic 
agents for infammatory diseases. However, they have a great diff culty crossing 
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), endothelial lining of blood vessels, GI tract, and 
mucosal layer due to their size and polarity. They are tending to enzymatically 
digest in the GI tract. Nanoparticles or nanocrystals are used as emerging agents 
to encapsulate or conjugate these compounds in order to increase their organic 
potency because of their stability against enzymes in the GI tract, rapid absorp￾tion capacity, and dissemination (Jogpal et al., 2022). Moreover, nanoparticles are 
a key component in the management therapies of many inf ammatory diseases, 
including arthritis, gastritis, nephritis, hepatitis, ulcerative colitis, Alzheimer’s 
disease, atherosclerosis, allergic reactions (asthma, eczema), and autoimmune 
disorders. Recently, there are numerous medications that are commercially avail￾able which can manage infammations. The aim of contemporary research is on 
using nanotherapeutics to relieve severe illnesses both in vitro and in vivo. Most 
investigations on the application of nanotherapeutics to infammation have pro￾duced a number of extremely positive and encouraging results (Brusini, Varna 
and Couvreur, 2020).

118 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
10.1 PROGRESS OF INFLAMMATORY DISEASES 
As mentioned above, infammation can be categorized depending on the possibility 
of being brought on by an exogenous chemical or by an endogenous deviant response. 
According to the duration it lasts, infammation can either be acute or chronic (Xiao, 
2017). Symptoms and signs of subacute infammation can last between two and six 
weeks, while symptoms and signs of acute infammation frequently last for several 
weeks. The body produces twice as many leukocytes within the region of the injured tis￾sue during an acute infammatory response. The immunological cells that are engaged in 
infammatory responses include eosinophils, mononuclear cells such as monocytes and 
macrophages, neutrophils, serum proteins, cell receptors, including stimulation of Toll￾like receptors, interferon-gamma (IFN-g), granulocytes–monocyte colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF), and cells that liberate cytokines and biomarkers in inf ammatory 
reactions such as macrophages (Cronkite and Strutt, 2018). Leukocytes, which belong 
to the category of white blood cells, are attracted to the region to assist in the removal 
of debris (Shi et al., 2012). The goal of the infammation is to compensate for the harm 
and start the recovery pathway. Moreover, this is preceded by a variety of steps that 
persist to engage the immune system until the lesion or infection restores to equilibrium 
(Schauss, 2013). When the patient experiences none of the aforementioned symptoms or 
indicators, the infammation is said to be a “silent inf ammation.”
 Chronic infammation can be described as an infammation at a lower level that is 
characterized as persistent infammation. It can last a lifespan or only a few months. 
This type of infection manifests as persistent fatigue, mouth ulcers, joint pain, dis￾comfort in the stomach, redness, rash, and fever. On the contrary, a prolonged dura￾tion of the toxic by-products or pathogen being perceptible is the primary reason 
for persistent infection. Defense mechanisms are occasionally diffcult to manage, 
causing harm to the vasculature, neurological system, musculoskeletal system, and 
other vital organs (Pahwa, Goyal and Jialal, 2022). It causes bowel disease, malig￾nancy, sepsis, asthmatic conditions, obesity, diabetes, cardiac diseases, neurological 
diseases, and certain publications have documented Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid 
polyarthritis (Molinaro et al., 2016). The condition is connected with an array of 
several conditions, including autoimmune disorders (Abdulkhaleq et al., 2018). 
The ongoing generation of infammatory cytokines, such as IFN-g, IL series 
of cytokines, as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is 
the reason for oxidative stress including metabolic stress (hypoxia), represent the 
most potential culprits (Schauss, 2013). IL-1, IL-6, and TNF are examples of pro￾infammatory cytokines that have an impact on the pathophysiological basis of pain. 
Interleukin (IL-6) plays a crucial role inside the neural activity to microglia by 
activation of astrocytes, neurological damage, and the control of a neuropeptides 
in a neuronal phase. Two signifcant receptors on the cell surface called TNFR1 
and TNFR2 govern the activation of the NF-B, infammation, protein kinases acti￾vated by stress (SAPKs), and apoptotic cascades. Another inf ammatory cytokine 
is TNF that is essential for innate and adaptive immunity, pro-inf ammatory traits, 
proliferation and differentiation of cells, and infammatory and neuropathic hyper￾algesia (Tanaka, Narazaki and Kishimoto, 2014). The pathophysiological basis of 
infammation can be understood by the proteins released by specifc cells throughout

signals (1) (e.g., wound, pathogens) trigger sensors (2) on infammatory cells present in the

Mediators, including plasma proteases, chemokines, cytokines, and vascular modif cation 
factors, lead in turn to vascular modifcations, recruitment of blood platelets, and other 
infammatory cells such as phagocytic leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils) and act on effector cells 
(4) and tissues to resolve infammation. Adaptive immunity is also implicated in inf amma￾tion response, lymphocytes B and T are able to recognize and respond to antigens presented 
by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. Adaptive mechanisms may function either 
by direct cytotoxic effects or by secretion of antibodies interacting with elements of the innate 
infammatory response (complement proteins, phagocytic cells, etc.).

infammation (Zarrin et al., 2021). The aforementioned mechanisms and cellular 
components that play an important role in the infammatory diseases are the thera￾peutic targets for developing nanotherapeutic formulations. Figure 10.1 shows the 
schematic representation of the inf ammatory responses. 
10.2 APPROACHES OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASES 
Immunological organs, immunological cells, and immunological chemicals are the 
building blocks of immune system. Currently, nanotherapeutic formulations primar￾ily have an impact upon immune system by specifcally interacting with a number of 
immunological cells and molecules. The conceptual basis for nanotherapeutic-based 
therapy is that nanomaterials can be developed by addressing the molecular and cellular 
materials that rely on their own characteristics and exert precise regulating activities. 
Macrophages, a kingpin in the cellular components of the innate immunity sys￾tem, are crucial in infammatory responses. They play distinct functions in nearly 
every part of biological functions of an organism, including growth, homeostasis,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
120 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
tissue regeneration, and immunity (Wynn, Chawla and Pollard, 2013). They may 
be present in a variety of tissues and are incredibly diverse and changeable (Locati, 
Curtale and Mantovani, 2020). Several nanoparticle formulas have been developed 
to engage with monocytes and macrophages, which are major players in a number 
of pathogenic processes at the moment. Nanoparticles must be designed with vari￾ous ligands on the exterior interface Those ligands may be monoclonal antibodies, 
oligomers, peptides, mannose, etc. Therefore, they can attach to particular receptors 
which are overexpressed upon the exterior surface of macrophages as well as perform 
these simultaneous processes. The control of bone marrow stimulation, monocyte 
migration, and enlistment, as well as the augmentation of vasculature permeability 
and the modifcation of polarization are only a few of the impacts of nanoparticles on 
monocytes/macrophages. Moreover, nanoparticles can take advantage of the inher￾ent characteristics of monocytes and macrophages that improve their ability of tar￾geting specifc molecules while avoiding the clearance of the immunological system 
( Gaspar et al ., 2019 ). 
One of the main characteristics of infammatory illnesses is bone marrow stimu￾lation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would multiply during inf ammatory cir￾cumstances because of increased concentrations of pro-inf ammatory cytokines, 
Toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists, as well as noradrenaline. This excess generation 
and supply of infammatory monocytes would aggregate in ulcerations (Heidt et al., 
2014; Mendelson and Frenette, 2014). Moreover, techniques to improve nanoparticle 
deposition in bone marrow were developed. The focusing affnity of bisphospho￾nates (like alendronate) to hydroxyapatite, the main mineral constituent of bone, can 
be increased by conjugating them to various varieties of nanoparticles (Ordikhani 
et al., 2021). Synthetic compounds, such as the anionic amphiphilic N -(3-carboxy￾1-oxopropyl)-1,5-dihexadecyl ester of l-glutamic acid, can promote the aggregation 
of liposomes inside the bone marrow while concurrently inhibiting absorption in the 
liver (Sou et al., 2007). Furthermore, molecular imaging techniques may be utilized 
to evaluate the pharmacological impacts that nanoparticles have on the generation 
of monocytes in the bone marrow. For examples, 18F-3′-fuoro-3′-deoxy-l-thymidine￾PET (18F-FLT-PET) can be used to measure the multiplication of bone marrow 
monocytes and HSCs (Agool et al., 2011). 
Nanotherapeutic agents may potentially be developed to regulate the mobiliza￾tion and engagement of monocytes and macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages 
can be activated and recruited within the process of chronic infammation by a wide 
assortment of chemokines, such as CCL2 (also known as monocyte chemotactic 
protein 1 or MCP-1) and chemokine C–C motif ligand 7 (CCL7), and receptor mol￾ecules, such as angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors (Alaarg et al., 2017) which then con￾centrate in the location of infammation ( Qi et al., 2019 ). Inhibiting the migration and 
recruiting of infammatory monocytes and macrophages is one way that nanothera￾peutic agents designed to target such substances can act as an anti-inf ammatory 
agent (Kratof, Kubes and Deniset, 2017). 
Both local macrophage growth and recruitment of circulating monocytes have 
been shown to contribute to lesional infammation (Robbins et al., 2013). Several 
solutions including nanoparticles are developed to limit the growth of focal mac￾rophages or even to immediately deplete them in order to lessen the consequence

of local infammation. Since many years, clodronate liposomes have served as the 
preferred drug for depleting macrophages in a number of illness scenarios. In animal 
models of induced endometriosis, Bacci et al. used clodronate liposomes to deplete 
macrophages (Bacci et al., 2009). 
Macrophage polarization is crucial in the progression of inf ammation, particularly 
in the pathophysiology of several infammatory disorders. Nanostructured materials 
with a metallic nature have also been used to control the polarization of macrophages. 
Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) exhibit anti-infammatory properties in mice in addition 
to a number of benefcial biochemical features. Researchers used a laboratory mouse 
model induced with cecal ligation as well as puncture laboratory animal model of 
bacterial sepsis to administer AuNP as an additive to antibiotics. According to the 
outcomes, AuNP may enhance M2 macrophages (CD206+ve in F4/80+ve cells) and 
diminish M1 macrophages (CD86+ve in F4/80+ve cells) inside the spleens of labora￾tory mice induced with sepsis. These impacts were further demonstrated by in vitro 
tests (Taratummarat et al., 2018). 
Nanomaterials must get through the immune system, traverse the biological 
barriers in the human body, and then navigate their way to the designated tissues 
in order to be therapeutically effective [67], which calls for a variety of intricate 
processes. Nanoporous silicon nanoparticles covered with leukocyte-derived cel￾lular membranes were created by Parodi et al. (Parodi et al., 2013). These hybrid 
nanoparticles can deliver and discharge their payload throughout an inf amed 
reconstructed endothelium, escape opsonization and decrease phagocytosis, and 
interact with endothelial cells via receptor–ligand encounter, all of which suggest 
a prospects for their use in the treatment of infammatory diseases and tumors. 
Monitoring monocytes and macrophages is another method for spotting inf amma￾tory reactions. Iron oxide nanoparticles were produced to mark and detect mono￾cytes in patients with cutaneous infammation without impairing their viability or 
functionality (Richards et al., 2012). These particles have been shown to be secure 
for use in humans. 
Another subset of cells in the innate immune system, neutrophils, play an essential 
part in resistance to external pathogens during acute inf ammation despite having a 
low capacity for biosynthesis (Mantovani et al., 2011). Recent studies have examined 
using albumin nanoparticles coupled with piceatannol to administer therapeutics to 
neutrophils for acute lung damage. As infammation occurs, neutrophils can cling to 
endothelial layer in the vasculature and penetrate into lesioned area, which is a key 
factor in a number of infammatory conditions (Liew and Kubes, 2019 ). In laboratory 
mouse models induced with traumatic primary spinal cord injury (SCI), treatment 
with PLG NPs decrease fourfold the overall quantity of neutrophils within the site 
of injury and reduce threefold the scar ring of fbrosis, suggesting the development 
of a prodegenerative extracellular matrix that endorses regeneration and improved 
recovery in their function (Park et al., 2019). 
The development of infammatory ailments is signif cantly infuenced by the gen￾eration of neutrophils, which is a signifcant component of the acute immune response. 
The capacity to preferentially target and deplete active neutrophils has been described 
for one form of pH-responsive albumin nanomaterials coupled with doxorubicin (DOX) 
(Zhang et al., 2019). Neutrophils are additionally employed as carriers to distribute

therapeutic substances, much like the hitchhiking techniques connected to monocyte 
or macrophages. Denatured albumin protein nanoparticles (albumin NPs) have been 
found to be swallowed by neutrophils and may be utilized to distribute therapeutic 
medicines (Wang et al., 2014). 
Nanoparticles with neutrophil membrane coatings take on some characteris￾tics from normal neutrophils. They have the ability to target infected tissue, destroy 
pathological chemicals, evade immune monitoring, and more. Neutrophil-simulating 
NPs have been considered as prospective therapeutic portals for the management of 
FIGURE 10.2 Targeting neutrophils and macrophages using nanoparticles for immunother￾apies in infammatory disorders. (a) Albumin nanoparticles loaded with piceatannol inhibit the 
neutrophil adhesion to endothelium, thus blocking neutrophil infltration. (b) Nanoparticles 
inhibit the functions of activated neutrophils and macrophages to reduce pro-inf ammatory fac￾tors and NETs release. (c) Nanoparticles transform macrophages from the pro-inf ammatory

to anti-infammatory M2 phenotype (biomarkers of CD163 and CD206). (d) DOX-loaded 
nanoparticles induce neutrophil apoptosis to induce the resolution of inf ammation. (e) 
Nanoparticles activate neutrophil by upregulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
level and CXCR2 to restore neutrophil pathogen clearance. (f) Nanoparticles induce the tran￾sition of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages to immunoenhancement M1 macrophages to

infammatory disorders ( Zhang et al., 2018). Figure 10.2shows targeting neutrophils 
and macrophages using nanoparticles for immunotherapies in inf ammatory disorders. 
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) located in the skeletal system are considered 
as the prototypes of immune cells. The two types of initially differentiated cells of 
HSCs are typical lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and myeloid progenitor (CMP) cells. T 
and B lymphocytes seem to be the primary constituents and primary particle emit￾ters of adaptive immunity, whereas CMP cells represent the progenitors of granu￾locytes, megakaryocytes, macrophages, erythrocytes, etc. (Orkin and Zon, 2008). 
An important factor in the pathophysiology of numerous infammatory illnesses is 
the autoreactive immune mechanism. Scientists have used poly(lactide-co -glycolide) 
NPs with coated antigen [PLG(Ag)] to address T2-mediated allergic airway inf am￾mation. PLG(Ag) nanoparticles have been readily accepted and eff ciently reduced 
ovalbumin (OVA)-induced T2 reactions and airway infammation either prophylacti￾cally or in a therapeutic manner (Smarr et al., 2016). 
Rheumatism and acute infammation are two examples of inf ammatory disor￾ders that can be brought on by autoreactive T cells. In a laboratory mouse model 
of imiquimod-induced psoriasis, Özcan et al. revealed that gold nanoparticles 
coupled with MTX had greater anti-infammatory activity to MTX separately 
(Özcan et al., 2020). The adaptive immune system is carried out by B lympho￾cytes, which differentiate to plasma cells and secrete antibodies in response to B 
cell receptors (BCR) attaching to their corresponding antigens (Yang and Reth, 
2016). Another team demonstrated the potential to specifcally target and deprive 
autoreactive B cells for therapeutic strategies in rheumatoid arthritis using 
poly( dl -lactic-co glycolic acid) NPs embellished with synthetic citrullinated pep￾tide as well as complement-activating lytic peptide to signifcantly decrease the 
ACPA generation of B cells from peptide seropositive patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (Pozsgay et al., 2016). 
In addition to the cellular components in the immunological system, cytokines, 
receptors, enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other molecules play crucial 
roles in the process of infammation and are now being used as therapeutic targets in 
disorders that cause infammation. Moreover, studies have shown that nanoparticles 
can regulate the concentrations of a variety of cytokines while managing inf amma￾tory disorders. For instance, PLGA nanoparticles loaded with metformin hydrochlo￾ride might lower IL-1 and TNF levels (Pereira et al., 2018). 
In parallel to the interconnections among nanoparticles and the immune sys￾tem described above, nanoparticles can further infuence immunological responses 
through interacting with dendritic cells, regulating the activity of natural killer (NK) 
cells, and other ways. 
Many immunomodulatory nanodrugs have already received FDA approval, and 
more are undergoing preclinical research or clinical trials. In contrast to existing 
anti-infammatory substances, which are primarily palliative, nanoparticles are 
capable of dealing with the infective factors of infammatory ailments. This is due 
to their unique properties in their structure, plasticity, and consistency, which give 
them a tremendous potential to approach and accumulate inside the inf amed tissues 
( Liu et al ., 2022 ).

Nanotherapeutics in 11 Skin Diseases and 
Cosmetology 
INTRODUCTION 
The incorporation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into medication delivery 
systems in nanoscale is now being employed to encourage pharmaceutical innovation 
by designing nanotherapeutics. A variety of dermatological products currently exist on 
the marketplace for the medical management of wounds to the skin, including atopic 
dermatitis, carcinoma of the skin, burns on the skin, wound recovery, and shielding 
from ultraviolet (UV) radiations. These medications demonstrate the effectiveness of 
nanotherapeutics employed in delivering of APIs across the skin. The development 
of novel sunscreens with nanoproducts is an exemplifcation in this case. Consumer 
safety of these nanomaterials-incorporated products is reportedly enhanced, which 
reduces the adverse reactions of UV inorganic fltering materials like titanium dioxide 
(TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as well as chemical flters like benzophenone-3 (Barbosa 
et al., 2019; Osmond-McLeod et al., 2016). Additionally, it is being shown that intro￾ducing sunscreen to solid nanomaterials may possess a synergistic impact because 
nanoparticles can potentially shield sunlight. Various kinds of nanoparticles are being 
suggested in recent years for incorporating vitamins, antiaging agents, antiwrinkle 
agents, antioxidants, and sunscreens into skin care formulas (Antonio et al., 2014). 
The human skin has multiple layers. The following three methods are proposed 
for allowing the solvent to pass through the horny epidermal layer: the transfollicle 
permeation (via hair follicles) as well as sudoriparous hair ducts involved in mul￾tiple investigations have demonstrated the existence of transfollicle channel that is a 
highly important pathway for numerous substances to enter the body; The intercel￾lular permeation of the substances tortuously disperse throughout the horny cells, 
perpetually residing in the lipid matrices. Finally, the transcellular permeation of the 
substances move straight across the horny cells into the intercellular lipid matrices 
( Barry, 2001 ). The dimensions of the molecules in the medication are also important. 
Molecules greater than 200–350 Da have an extremely challenging time penetrat￾ing intact skin; 400 Da have been considered to represent the maximum molecular 
size. Whenever the layer of horny cells lacks, the majority of tiny, nonelectrolytic, 
molecules that are water soluble permeate to the circulatory system approximately a 
thousand times fast ( Cevc et al ., 1996 ). 
Researchers aim to remove this hurdle in order to increase substance movement; 
however, occasionally the follicular pathway can be signifcant. Skin responds as a 
mechanically nanoporous barrier that can be breached by numerous, semicircular tun￾nels or paths from a penetration perspective. According to the majority of reports, the

128 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
average diameter of these aforementioned hydrophilic “pores” is 0.4–36.0 nm. Different 
approaches have been suggested to enhance this pathway and alter the molecular design 
that comprises corneocytes and the numerous intercellular lipid sheets since the major￾ity of passive permeating molecules traverse the skin through those intercellular “micro￾channels.” Nanoparticles are directly involved in this phenomenon (Barry, 2001). 
Considering the cosmeceuticals, moisturizing lotions comprising liposomes were 
the initial cosmetics developed utilizing nanotechnology, and they were introduced four 
decades ago. Cosmeceuticals, and particularly nanocosmeceuticals, have experienced 
the fastest increase in the personal care goods sector over the past few decades. The regu￾lated release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), location-specifc targeting, and 
occlusive qualities with increased hydration are the key benefts of nanocosmeceuticals. 
Given some of these benefts, clinical trials and regulation of nanocosmeceuticals are 
essential steps to guaranteeing the safety of the public (Singhal, Khanna and Nasa, 2011). 
11.1 THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN SKIN 
The architecture of the skin, a multilayered organ made up of epidermis, dermis, and 
hypodermis, is shown schematically in Figure 11.1. Because it is made up of a strati￾fed, compact epithelium, the epidermis, regarded as the outermost superf cial layer, 
serves as the primary physical–chemical barrier against the penetration of bioactive 
substances. The epidermis is made up of keratinocytes which are constantly moving 
from lower to superfcial layers. These keratinocytes are attached to one another by 
desmosomes, adhesive junctions, and tight junctions that prevent chemicals from dif￾fusing into the dermis underneath. The four epidermis layers—the stratum corneum 
(SC), the stratum granulosum (SG), the stratum spinosum (SS), and the stratum basale 
(SB)—that run from the outermost layer downward to the underlying basement mem￾brane (BM) are various phases of keratin maturation (Salvioni et al., 2021). 
This has been described as a “brick and mortar” structure laden with desmo￾somes, in which nonaligned corneocytes (displacement 15–30%) are dispersed in 
a lipidic matrix. The SC constitutes a nonaligned “brick-and-mortar” architecture 
made up of enucleated deceased cells (corneocytes) that are enveloped by a lipidic 
matrix. The surface of the SC is entirely covered in many skin furrows that vary 
in depth. Although SC that constitutes the lipophilic stratum (approximately 15% 
water) is responsible for the vast majority of the preventive function governed by 
the epidermis, the remaining strata, which are combined for convenience into just 
a single multilayer termed viable epidermis (VE), have a more hydrophilic nature 
(75% water). Together with the hypodermis, the dermis offers the epidermis trophic 
as well as structural support. It primarily consists of fbroblasts and a reticulum 
of elastin and collagen fbers embedded in a proteoglycan-based framework. These 
more profound layers contain blood vessels (Salvioni et al., 2021). 
11.2 THE IMPACT OF THE SIZE OF ACTIVE MOLECULES 
IN DERMATOLOGICAL AGENTS 
Depending on physical and chemical characteristics of various layers of the skin, 
molecules may penetrate through the epidermal layer in a variety of ways. A 500 129 Nanotherapeutics in Skin Diseases and Cosmetology FIGURE 11.1 Schematic representation of the skin. (a) Epidermis and dermis have a thickness of 0.1–0.2 mm and 2.0–5.0 mm, respectively, while the thickness of the hypodermis varies greatly between individuals depending on the anatomical site. (b) Epidermis structure. Viable epidermis (50–150 μm) and the stratum corneum (10–20 μm) differ in hydrophilicity and pH, which ranges between 4.5 and 5.5 on mammalian SC surfaces and approaches neutrality at the SC–SG interface.

130 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
Da limit has been considered as the molecular weight (MW) threshold permitted for 
the penetration into the skin of compounds (Bos and Meinardi, 2000). The scientif c 
arena differs on the matter of NP penetration for a minimum of a pair of factors: 
frst, the toxicological consequences associated with nanotechnology, and second, 
the requirement to reveal the function of nanomaterials as transporters to improve 
the penetration regarding the bioactive substance. The SC is each ingredient’s initial 
and most signifcant barrier, as previously stated. Each of the three paths (transcel￾lular, intercellular, and appendageal route) used to explain the penetration of other 
compounds has been reported for nanoparticles in skin (Liang et al., 2013). The 
size of the nanoparticles is crucial in this phenomenon. According to a theoretical 
examination of the SC framework, nanomaterials that are smaller than 36 nm could 
potentially be able to infltrate through aqueous pores with a superfcial diameter of 
0.4–36 nm, while nanoparticles smaller than 5–7 nm seem more likely to accomplish 
so through the intercellular lipidic matrices (Baroli, 2010). 
In addition, nanoobjects that can be disseminated in perspiration and sebum can 
accumulate due to the vast follicular spacing (10–210 nm) (Mahmoud et al., 2017). 
Chemical–physical characteristics of the skin surface can affect the speed with which 
NPs penetrate (negatively charged NPs may penetrate the epidermis more easily 
than the positive charged NPs, for example) (Lee et al., 2013) or they can prolong the 
time that these systems are available in the SC (lipid coating, for example, improves 
retention in lipid-rich SC) (Jensen, Petersson and Nielsen, 2011). Figure 11.2shows 
the potential routes of the penetration of nanomaterials into the skin. There are cer￾tain general statements that may be offered to distinguish between insoluble and 
lipid- or surfactant-based nanoparticles, despite the fact that nanoparticles vary in 
their capacity to penetrate depending on their dimensions, composition, stability 
of the colloids, and carrier qualities (Larese Filon et al., 2015). The f rst category 
consists of polymeric nanocomplexes which remain bio-persistent following being 
applied to the human skin and inorganic NPs. The actions of these nanoparticles

Nanotherapeutics in Skin Diseases and Cosmetology 131 
have been the subject of numerous investigations. Since this experimental design is 
typically believed to be more trustworthy than alternative laboratory animal mod￾els, researchers are concentrating on the fndings obtained utilizing human skin 
herein (Roberts et al., 2017). The information provided indicates that bio-persistent 
nanoparticles primarily accumulate on the outermost layer of intact skin as well 
as in the more superfcial layers of the SC, considering the small size necessary 
for penetration. Zinc was identifed in the more profound layers of the dermis and 
epidermis as an outcome of NP dissolution because topically administered ZnO, 
the type of zinc employed most frequently in sunscreen, exhibited no substantial 
penetration into normal skin. Additionally, these fndings were confrmed on skin 
with impairment and in occlusive situations (Leite-Silva et al., 2016). Comparable to 
TiO2 NPs, another excellent mineral-based sunblock component, SC’s initial layers 
are impermeable to particles 20–100 nm in dimension (Lohani et al., 2014). These 
nanoparticles are not dispersing throughout the tissues that surround it, despite the 
fact that they appear to enter the follicular region more deeply (Lekki et al., 2007). 
11.3 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS SUNSCREEN AGENTS 
UV radiation is classifed as UVA (wavelength = 320–400 nm), UVB (wavelength = 
280–320 nm), and UVC (wavelength = 100–280 nm) and accounts for around 10% 
of the total radiation emissions. The only types of radiation that considerably perme￾ate the atmosphere as well as endanger human health are those featuring the longest 
wavelengths, such as UVA and UVB. UV fltration systems, which are typically 
categorized into two categories—inorganic or organic—can be used for photopro￾tection (D’Orazio et al., 2013). 
In the feld of cosmetics, the prevention of sunburn and long-exposure conse￾quences (such as skin aging and skin malignancies) depend heavily on a decrease of 
UV-induced damage to the skin, and the incorporation of flters have become com￾monplace in daily-use treatments in addition to sunscreens (Burke, 2018). Filter￾containing formulas are presently made to provide UVA and UVB protection. 
Although this type of radiation has higher energy, it plays an important role in the 
development of cancer: UVA permeates deeper into the epidermal layers, inhibiting 
immune function and causing precancerous alterations (Burke, 2018). Additionally, 
UVA upregulates the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases, which break down 
collagen and elastin, which is the main cause of skin elasticity decline (Battie 
et al., 2014). Inorganic flters frequently utilize insoluble TiO 2 and ZnO particles, 
particularly when they are nanosized in their dimensions (30–150 nm). The utiliza￾tion of TiO2 and ZnO-NPs, which refect just a tiny fraction of the incident light par￾ticles and produce a transparent impact, better satisfes consumer expectations than 
micrometer-sized particles. In addition, as opposed to organic flters, these f lters 
are more environment-friendly, safer, and photostable (Schneider and Lim, 2019). 
11.4 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS 
Because of the emergence of strains that are resistant and toxicities, frequently 
employed antimicrobic drugs have a limited potency and effectiveness (Singh, Young  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
132 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
and Silver, 2017). The antimicrobial activity of several metal-based nanoparticles, 
including Ag-, Au-, Co-, ZnO-, TiO2-, and Cu-based nanomaterials, has consequently 
been explored for a variety of applications (including the textile, nourishment, and 
cosmetics sectors). Numerous nanoparticles have the inherent capacity to enhance 
skin well-being, while this is not their primary application. This increases the sig￾nifcance of nanocosmetic products (Niska et al., 2018). 
11.5 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR ANTISEPSIS 
Another important application of nanoparticles is in antisepsis. In addition to provid￾ing an instant antibacterial impact due to rapid absorption through the capsule wall, 
chlorhexidine gluconate transported by nanoparticles (Nanochlorex®) also has a 
lasting effect owing to persistent liberation from the nucleus of the particle (Roberts 
et al., 2017). The effcacy of the particles in formulations is equivalent to 60% iso￾propanol, which renders them a good substitute for alcohol-based hand treatments, 
which might cause some harm to the skin after prolonged use (Holmes et al., 2020). 
Because of their photocatalytic activity, other nanoparticles, including bare TiO 2, 
exhibit antimicrobial characteristics. Uncovered TiO 2 works as a photocatalyst to 
encourage the peroxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipid present in the bacte￾rial lipid membrane after being exposed to UV light (Lohani et al., 2014). The most 
widely utilized antibacterial nanoformulation currently in use is nanosilver, which is 
employed not only as a bandage for wounds and burns but also as a disinfectant for 
water and an interior spray. Its antibacterial impact is most likely caused by its mito￾chondrial toxicity as a result of interactions with oxidative stress-causing moieties of 
internal membrane protein thiols (Lekki et al., 2007). 
11.6 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS MOISTURIZING AGENTS 
To improve skin hydration, moisturizing chemicals are applied. Traditional moistur￾izing methods use occlusive substances or humectants that trap and preserve water 
within the skin. Occlusive substances, such as petrolatum, beeswax, and fatty acids, 
prevent water evaporation by creating a flm on the human skin (Kim et al., 2018). 
For the purpose of providing a sustained liberation of the active component, chitosan 
was coated onto PLGA NPs that were encasing ceramides. This technique made use 
of chitosan’s adhesiveness and dispersion at an acidic pH. An experimental in vivo 
atopic dermatitis model data revealed that therapy with this formulation promoted skin 
regeneration with greater effcacy than the commercial medication (Jung et al., 2015). 
Unsaturated phospholipid-based liposomes have a tendency to separate after their 
application to the skin; as a result, their constituent parts might reach deep inside 
the SC and have a moisturizing impact there. This is a result of both phospholipids’ 
catabolism and internal hygroscopicity. Particularly, the activity of skin phospoli￾pases results in the formation of osmolytes (such as betaine), which inhibit the loss 
of water by maintaining the number of keratinocytes and boosting the expression of 
tight junctions (El-Chami et al., 2014). 
It was recently suggested that nanocrystals could boost the effectiveness of several 
kinds of bioactive substances employed in cosmetics in addition to their function as UV 
flters. Luscious, silky, and soft commodities are often well-received by consumers;  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Skin Diseases and Cosmetology 133 
however, plenty of molecules and extracts exhibiting benefcial impacts on skin health are 
pigmented and insoluble, which limits their effectiveness. Solubility issues of an active 
ingredient can impact the homogeneity of the product and restrict its absorption in addition 
to providing it an unpleasant aesthetic. The nanonization of bioactive substances has been 
suggested as an alternative to these problems; in fact, the vast surface area of nanocrystals 
enhances penetration kinetics and skin adhesion capability. The usage of nanocrystals for 
cosmetic purposes has been discussed in a number of publications. For example, f avo￾noids, ubiquinone, lutein, and resveratrol all are examples of fat-soluble antioxidants that 
have been the focus of research on bioactive substances (Salvioni et al., 2021). 
11.7 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS RHEOLOGY MODIFIERS 
OF DERMATOLOGICAL PRODUCTS 
Rheology modifers, frequently referred to as thickening agents, are added to cos￾metic compositions to increase viscosity, enhance sensory properties, and give the 
consumer a sense of quality. It has become quite common to use nanomaterials, 
primarily clay and silica NPs, as rheology moderators. Additionally, silica NPs are 
ideal for cosmetic uses due to their chemical inertness. The temporary NP aggrega￾tion to create a percolating matrix that has no impact on the product’s spreading as it 
disintegrates under mechanical pressure might be the cause of the thickness impact. 
In addition to thickening the product, silica nanoparticles give it an opaque appear￾ance and have been researched as skin defenders due to their capacity to absorb and 
neutralize harmful compounds (Bolzinger, Briançon and Chevalier, 2011). 
11.8 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS ANTIOXIDANTS 
IN DERMATOLOGY 
Retinol, a form of vitamin A, and retinoids, its analogues, are some of the most widely 
utilized active substances in cosmetics. They are capable to control sebum, boost the 
generation of extracellular matrix, and support the development, differentiation, and 
upkeep of epidermal cells, all of which help to lessen wrinkles and acne. Additionally, 
they are used for managing pigmentation and photoaging diseases due to their capac￾ity to induce cellular turnover, limit melanogenesis, and impede the transfer of 
melanin into epidermal cells. Antioxidants (AOs) shield DNA from oxidative stress 
brought on by the presence of ROS. ROS are produced as a result of numerous exter￾nal or internal triggers. By neutralizing ROS, preventing ROS-producing enzymes, 
and chelating transition metal particles, AOs are able to achieve this goal. The exces￾sive generation of ROS that UV radiation induces in the skin leads to aging (wrinkles 
and hyperpigmentation) as well as cancer. Van Tran et al. (Van Tran, Moon and Lee, 
2019) recently presented a thorough overview of the diffculties in employing lipo￾somes for the transportation of AOs. Other delivery methods besides liposomes have 
been used to increase the function of AOs (Sorg et al., 2006). 
11.9 NANOTHERAPEUTICS AS ANTIAGING AGENTS 
In youthful skin, hyaluronic acid (HA), which is an endogenous glycosaminogly￾can, is abundant; nevertheless, as skin ages, its levels inevitably decline. HA is  
 
 
 
134 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
frequently used as an emollient because of its capacity to hold onto water molecules. 
Furthermore, HA can be employed as an antiwrinkle agent because it is a physiologi￾cal component of the extracellular matrix of the human skin. Despite these advan￾tageous effects, HA’s huge molecular weight (>500 kDa) and high hydrophilicity 
lead to limited penetration, which severely restricts its potential. In addition to being 
utilized as a soft-tissue padding, HA may be integrated into a variety of cosmetic 
products as topical application. In this instance, intradermal microinjection is used 
to compensate for HA’s poor permeability (Bukhari et al., 2018). 
11.10 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN SEBACEOUS 
GLAND–RELATED DISEASES 
A crucial part of the pilosebaceous component is the sebaceous gland. Since the 
sebaceous duct enters the hair follicle canal, efforts for treating disorders that affect 
the hair follicle are especially helped by the follicular penetration of externally 
applied materials. Early studies by Schaefer et al. using adapalene fragments car￾ried by polymerized particles (PLA and PLGA) have demonstrated the usefulness 
of particle networks for drug delivery for intrafollicular medication delivery and for 
signifcantly improved success in addressing sebaceous gland problems like acne in 
addition to pilose sebaceous disorders (Van Tran, Moon and Lee, 2019). 
11.11 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR HAIR GROWTH PROBLEMS 
Particle delivery networks for medications are demonstrated to be a crucial com￾ponent in treating hair diseases as they promote the penetration of drugs within 
hair follicle apertures and serve as a deposition for continuous drug release. Thus, 
it is thought that nanoparticle-based products are better suited for treating illnesses 
like androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata than the solutions containing water and 
alcohol utilized until recently. In contrast to aqueous regulate solutions, particles 
encapsulating chemicals for hair growth demonstrated 2.0–2.5 times greater per￾manence inside hair follicle areas. In comparison to a simple solution of the exact 
same drug, hinokitiol encapsulated in identical particles signifcantly enhanced the 
transition of hair follicles during their telogen to anagen phase. Minoxidil’s longev￾ity in the hair follicle zone was increased by encapsulating it in polyethylene glycol 
nanostructures with a size of 40–130 nm (Wu et al., 2015). 
11.12 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN BURN WOUNDS 
Burn wound care has been investigated using a wide variety of NPs. These wounds 
can beneft from the use of nanotherapeutics by having an increased antibacte￾rial action, eliminating bacterial drug resistance, promoting cell proliferation, and 
reducing the frequency of drug administration. Nanotherapeutics’ ability to treat 
many different kinds and intensities of burns is being examined in a number of ani￾mal models. In people who have burn injuries, certain nanotherapeutics have effec￾tive therapeutic effects, which renders them ideal candidates for further research 
into their function in the treatment of these wounds—despite the fact that satisfying 
therapeutic results have been attained (Huang et al., 2021).  
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics in Skin Diseases and Cosmetology 135 
Because of their outstanding antibacterial properties and broad-spectrum antimi￾crobial actions against a number of microorganisms, AgNPs and Ag ions are remark￾able antimicrobial agents in burn wound management. Because of their greater 
penetration and retention properties, AgNPs in particular exhibit better antibacterial 
action than ionic silver. As a result, they are frequently employed for the management 
of burn wounds. Importantly, because Zn has semiconductor characteristics, ZnO￾NPs can enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration through GF-mediated 
routes. Consequently, because ZnO-NPs have antibacterial, anti-inf ammatory, and 
minimal cytotoxicity capabilities, they may also be employed as persistent sources 
of ionic Zn in the management of burn wounds (Huang et al., 2021). 
11.13 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR PSORIASIS 
An autoimmune etiology underlies the dermatological chronic skin disorder known 
as psoriasis. It signifcantly lowers the patients’ overall quality of life. Consequently, 
it served as an intriguing research focus over the years. Anti-inf ammatory drugs, 
immune suppressants, biological treatments, and phototherapy are among the tradi￾tional treatment choices. Nanotechnology has potential properties that make it pos￾sible to customize a drug carrier for cutaneous targeting, increased eff cacy, and 
reduced side effects. Polymeric, metallic, lipidic, and hybrid nanocarriers integrating 
various active agents are included in sophisticated systems. Over the years, all of 
the aforementioned drug delivery system variants have been researched for topical 
administration on psoriatic plaques. To increase effciency, security, and adherence 
for the treatment of psoriasis, researchers are making promising progress toward 
developing an optimal formula with a practical dosage form. As a result, it will pro￾vide patients with a higher quality of life. Figure 11.3shows psoriatic plaques with 
healthy normal skin (Fereig et al., 2020).

136 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
11.14 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN DESIGNING AND 
CHARACTERIZATION OF NANOPARTICLES 
IN DERMATOLOGICAL PRODUCTS 
A very broad topic is the creation and characterization of NPs in dermatological prod￾ucts. Once the nanoparticles have been synthesized, they need to be incorporated into 
a vehicle suited for cosmetic usage. In reality, aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles are 
frequently applied straight to the skin; thus, it is important to mix them in a suitable 
vehicle. The stability of NPs chemically and physically in skincare products is inf u￾enced by both the manner they are delivered and the chemical consistency of the media 
in which they are disseminated. The proper formulation ensures physical, chemical, and 
microbial stability and controls the end product’s effectiveness and safety. Additionally, 
the type of cosmetic product, such as a day or night lotion, body lotion, serum products, 
etc., determines its vehicle of choice. The type and strength of interactions between 
particles, the dispersion, the emulsifer, and the thickening will determine the physi￾cal stability of a cosmeceutical product comprising NPs. Chelating compounds, buf￾fers, and AOs all have been employed to give the fnished product chemical stability. 
Microorganisms cannot grow due to preservatives. In addition to improving the prod￾uct’s organoleptic qualities, dyes and perfumes can also increase customer’s appeal. 
The fundamental beneft of NPs is the fact that they liberate the active substance in the 
epidermis in signifcant amounts by releasing it in the outermost strata of the human 
skin. Cosmetics including liposomes have a strong substantivity that makes them dif￾fcult to remove with water. Particularly liposomes can raise the amount of lipids in the 
SC, which will improve moisturization and lessen skin dryness (Budai et al., 2013).

Nanotherapeutics 12 in Orthopedics 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the most vital organs within the body is bone tissue. It is comprised of approxi￾mately 60% of inorganic elements, 30% of organic materials, 10% of tissue cells, along 
with veins and arteries of the circulatory system. The inorganic elements are referred 
to as hydroxyapatite (HA) (Ca10(PO 4)6(OH)2), when the organic framework contains 
lipids, the protein collagen, along with proteoglycans (Shea and Miller, 2005; Chen 
et al., 2022). The skeleton has a variety of purposes in the body, including protect￾ing the organs that are located within the structure, supporting the framework of the 
body, serving as a repository for minerals, and aiding in the generation of blood cells 
(Florencio-Silva et al., 2015). A healthy structure of bones is continually being digested 
and reshaped by the highly specifc dynamic tissue during lifetime for these purposes. 
Bone disorders comprise a wide range of skeletal-related problems, such as abnormali￾ties that signifcantly impede human mobility and increase mortality. Additionally, there is 
an imperative necessity for developing novel medicines and drug delivery technologies for 
secure and effcient therapeutic treatments of a number of most prevalent skeleton diseases, 
such as osteoarthritis, osteosarcoma, osteoporosis, and metastatic cancer of the bone (Xue 
X. et al., 2021). Successful achievements are a constant concern in the advancement of 
medicines for bone malignancies and bone degenerative conditions with the equilibrium 
between adverse effects of the drug and curative therapy. A targeted delivery approach 
utilizing nanotechnology has frequently been suggested as a potential tactic to deal with 
these problems and improve the effectiveness of treatment. In regard to medicine, nanoma￾terials provide novel opportunities to study illnesses through imaging and diagnostic uses 
and, increasingly, they serve as delivery systems for medications or therapeutic substances 
to produce better and safer therapeutic results in orthopedics. Additionally, nanoparticles 
are transforming tissue engineering in healthcare by offering a fne architecture facilitating 
regeneration of tissue (Tasker, Sparey-Taylor and Nokes, 2007). 
Investigation on bone regeneration possesses a lengthy and varied history. Some of 
the most popular experimental techniques used to assess growth of the bone tissue are 
in vivo and in vitro exposed tests. In the frst instance, laboratory rodents are purposely 
induced bone fractures and deformities to evaluate various treatment options and materi￾als ( Luvizuto et al., 2011). The beneft of in vitro tests is that they give a more precise 
understanding of the manner in which a chemical act on cells, cellular components and 
tissues in an intended organ under certain circumstances. They involve studying the 
proliferation, morphological features, and intracellular biochemistry of cells linked to 
bone regeneration by exposing cells that have been cultured to a medication (Qiang et 
al., 2008) or cultivating cells on a substance ( Zhou et al., 2013). Numerous nanomateri￾als have been invented recently as possible constituents for bone regeneration therapy.

140 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
There are several ways to assess whether they are safe and effective as initial components 
(Zanello et al., 2006) or in the form of composite materials (Hill et al., 2019 ), even though 
the majority are employed as composite substances in bone regeneration scaffolds. 
The distribution of drugs might represent the most prominent prospect of nano￾therapeutics in orthopedics. Nanofabricated interfaces may enable targeted admin￾istration of therapeutic enzymes into tumor cells within nanotherapeutics utilized 
for targeting of bone tumors. Nanocapsules have been found to have a longer-lasting 
anti-infammatory impact than other forms of arthritis treatment. The development 
of wound dressings with nanofbrous membranes is an important milestone in lower￾ing postoperative infections and accelerating recovery. The employing of nanotech￾nology in orthopedic research, diagnosis, and treatment is relatively young. However, 
nanotherapeutics has been capable to transform both the science and the practice of 
orthopedic care in the brief period it has been investigated and used—as a result of 
the capability of nanotherapeutics for the treatment of the human body in manners 
that are more accurate, superior for bone formation, and theoretically better, at least 
in regard to the rate of infection and the need for repeat operations. Hence, many 
traditional treatments are being substituted (Pokkalath et al., 2021). 
Although it is still in the early stages, nanotechnology cannot solve all of the 
issues facing the discipline of orthopedic surgery. However, it appears that nanother￾apeutics is occupying a burgeoning niche in the discipline of orthopedic surgery with 
additional funding and research ( Pokkalath et al ., 2021 ). Figure 12.1depicts various 
nanotherapeutic-based approaches in orthopedics methods. 
12.1 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN OSTEOPOROSIS 
Decreased density of bones and aberrant bone tissue microscopic structure, which 
enhance the fragility of bones and fracture susceptibility, are characteristics of osteo￾porosis (OP). OP can be described as a systemic metabolic bone disorder (Seeman 
and Delmas, 2006). The aging among people in China is contributing to a spike in 
osteoporosis cases according to statistics, which also raises medical costs (Wang 
et al., 2009). The two varieties of OP are primary and secondary. This categorization 
is based on their etiologies, with primary being the more prevalent type and compris￾ing old age and postmenopause (Li et al., 2021). In the instance of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis, it is mostly caused by estrogen insuffciency. The decreased bone mass 
along with elevated conversion osteoporosis that arise from greater bone resorption 
over bone synthesis is also a major reason on this matter. Estrogen is frequently 
employed to keep the mineral density of bones intact. However, this treatment is 
linked to breast swelling and congestion. Moreover, it is linked signifcantly to higher 
incidences of malignancies of the breast with hyperplasia of the endometrium (Black 
and Rosen, 2016). Therefore, the use of bone-targeted treatments for osteoporosis is 
a signifcant research topic at present. This is because performing such research can 
lower the risk of the unwanted effects and enhance treatment outcomes. 
The utilization of gene therapy to the treatment of metabolic disorders is still 
being implemented into practical uses due to the dearth of appropriate targeted 
methods of delivery to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the treatment. In 
order to accomplish the targeted discharge of the osteogenic Plekho1 siRNA, Liang 141 Nanotherapeutics in Orthopedics FIGURE 12.1 Nanotherapeutics-based approaches in orthopedics. Source: Reproduced with permission from Pokkalath et al., 2021.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
142 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
et al. invented the frst aptamer-functionalized liposome nanosystem in 2015. They 
opted for the osteoblast-specifc aptamer CH6 by cell-SELEX, along with the ligand￾modifed PEGylated liposome, primarily via macropinocytosis. These foster sup￾pressing of the negative regulation of skeletal formation genes in osteoblasts and 
boost bone formation as demonstrated. Additionally, Cui et al. developed an exo￾some-loaded Shn3 gene siRNA delivery method called BT-Exo-siShn3. The peptide 
that is targeting the bone experienced hydrophobic interaction alteration is aimed to 
enable the exosomes to carry siRNA to osteoblasts. Furthermore, it was tethered to 
the exosome surface. Suppression of Shn3 genes decreased RANKL expression in 
osteoblasts, improved osteogenic differentiation, inhibited osteoclast activity, halted 
OVX-induced reduction in bone mass, and encouraged the development of H-type 
vessels and mineralization of bones (Cui et al., 2022). The previously described 
bone-targeting nanomaterials offer an intriguing concept for the investigation of 
siRNA delivery to cure osteoporosis. 
Supplements containing calcium are a therapeutically recommended medication 
for the frst-line treatment of osteoporosis. Although they often require large and 
repetitive dosages of administration, an absence of targeting results in subpar treat￾ment results. Tao et al. have described a carrier for in situ calcium supplementation 
that target the skeletal structures in the oral region and are responsive to OP micro￾environment (water/pH). A bone-targeted medication delivery platform (TMA/Sim) 
was developed using an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) framework as the main 
structural component, modulated with tetracycline (Tc), capped with monostearin 
(MS), and preloaded with simvastatin (Sim). Simvastatin might be administered to 
specifc areas of the body in combination with in situ supplementation of calcium to 
produce a potentially effective treatment plan (Tao et al., 2021). 
12.2 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN OSTEOARTHRITIS 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of chronic arthropathy that is usually found in elderly 
patients and is distinguished by osteophytes, subchondral bone sclerosis, localized 
infammation, as well as the degenerative breakdown of articular cartilage (Hunter 
and Bierma-Zeinstra, 2019; Hu et al., 2021). It is mainly triggered by a discrepancy 
between mechanical and biological processes that results in the normal degenera￾tion and development of articular cartilage, its extracellular matrix, and subchondral 
bones (Karsdal et al., 2014). Even though there have been a lot of scientif c clinical 
research and laboratory animal investigations, the pathophysiology and development 
of OA are still not fully understood. Therefore, the primary goals of OA treatment 
are symptom relief, functional improvement, and process of pathogenesis delaying 
(McAlindon and Bannuru, 2018). The unique avascular, thick, and occlusive tissue 
architecture in OA renders drug administration that has become a therapeutic prob￾lem (Bijlsma, Berenbaum and Lafeber, 2011). The application of nanoparticles to 
deliver medications for specifc treatments has helped to make a qualitative advance￾ment in improving the penetration of medicines and sustained liberation in OA, rely￾ing on the ongoing research and development of traditional pharmaceuticals. 
In recognition of the localized characteristics of osteoarthritis in particu￾lar joints, intraarticular (IA) injectables are a more effcient method of obtaining  
 
Nanotherapeutics in Orthopedics 143 
therapeutic doses with fewer adverse reactions on the entire joint than systemic deliv￾ery. A focused delivery technique may be more eff cient since the medicine may be 
promptly eliminated once it reaches the joint. Mangostemonin (FMN), a medication 
with exceptionally poor aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability, was used as 
a therapeutic substance. For the production of cartilage-targeting nanomicrospheres 
(PCFMN), FMN was PEGylated and then coupled with the cartilage-targeting pep￾tide (CollBP). When FMN was PEGylated, the medication was more soluble in it, 
and CollBP allowed more drug to accumulate at the joint region. After the therapy, a 
number of infammatory reactions–related factors were substantially reduced, which 
also improved the cartilage damage caused by ACLT and eventually resulted in an 
effective OA slowing effect (Xiong et al., 2021). 
FIGURE 12.2 Nanotubes, magnetic nanoparticles, and other nanotechnology-based drug 
and gene delivery systems may be used for targeting molecular pathways and pathogenic 
mechanisms involved in OA development. Nanocomposites are also being explored as poten￾tial tools for promoting cartilage repair. Nanotechnology platforms may be combined with 
cell, gene, and biological therapies for the development of a new generation of future OA 
therapeutics.

144 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
Figure 12.2shows various nanotherapeutics-based approaches in the disease 
management of osteoporosis. A type II collagen-targeting peptide was attached by 
Xue et al. to a metal organic framework (MOF)-modifed mesoporous polydopamine 
(MPDA) double drug delivery platform (RB@MPMW). Following the near-infra￾red (NIR) laser stimulated nanoparticles, bilirubin (Br) was liberated for immedi￾ate ROS scavenging, enabling the resulting discharge of rapamycin (Rap) increased 
autophagy initiation and chondrocyte preservation. In the ACLT laboratory rat 
model, cartilage degradation was effectively postponed by the targeted liberation of 
both medicines at cartilage locations (Xue et al., 2021). 
12.3 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN OSTEOSARCOMA 
The most common basic sarcoma in children and adolescents can be described as 
osteosarcoma (OS), a malignant skeletal tumor. It poses a major hazard to human 
health because of its aggressiveness, carcinogenicity, and poor prognosis (Kansara 
et al., 2014). The present therapeutic paradigm for OS is prior to surgery neoadju￾vant chemotherapy, surgical removal of the tumor, and adjuvant chemotherapy, and 
the overall survival rate after fve years of the disorder has increased from 20% to 
about 60% with medical advancements (Isakoff et al., 2015; Gill and Gorlick, 2021). 
However, the initial therapy of OS depends on amputation, which harms patients 
physically and psychologically. However, the current state of clinical practice 
indicates that the issues with tumor resistance, nontargeted distribution of drugs, 
high expenses, and adverse reactions of chemotherapy have not fundamentally 
enhanced the effcacy, particularly for those suffering from metastasis or recur￾rence (González-Fernández et al., 2017). The creation of personalized drug delivery 
platforms could prove to be a successful strategy to improve survival rates in the 
context of precision medicine (Jurek et al., 2017). Two nanoplatforms have been 
invented by Chen et al. for the specifc treatment of osteosarcoma. One example 
is CDDPHANG/DOX, which refers to cisplatin (CDDP)-cross-linked hyaluronic 
acid nanogels loaded with DOX. In addition to its anticancer properties, CDDP 
also functions as a cross-linking substance that prevent early drug release and con￾tribute to drug deposition within the tumor. The second method uses hyaluronic 
acid nanoparticles that have been cross-linked with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to 
administer DOX while also ensuring the long-term stability of those nanoparticles. 
Both nanoplatforms possess excellent biocompatibility, extended blood circulation 
times, and sensitivity toward the acidic microenvironment of tumors ( Zhang et al., 
2018a ; Zhang et al ., 2018b ). 
Alendronate (ALN) as well as hyaluronic acid (HA), the ligand from CD44, were 
coupled in a different study using bisphosphonates as focusing ligands. The modi￾fed lipid ALN-HA-SS-L was then attached to liposomes containing the anticancer 
medication DOX. A substantial growth hindering effect appeared in the in situ OS 
laboratory mouse model, and the survival rate of laboratory mice was developed. In 
vitro experiments confrmed that the receptive liposomes liberated the drug after 
disassembling in glutathione-comprised cancer cells, demonstrating signif cant 
cytotoxicity and an immediate cellular uptake rate toward human OS MG-63 cells

(Feng et al., 2019 ). In summary, the double-targeting redox-sensitive liposomes treat￾ing CD44 and bone were assembled together and it demonstrated a potential for OS. 
12.4 NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR BONE REGENERATION 
Scaffolds can be described as mechanical devices that serve as transporters 
of growth factors or cellular components. The most effective scaffolds are 
simultaneously biocompatible and biodegradable ensuring they can eventually 
be replaced with tissue that functions. The extracellular matrix that normally 
offers support and durability and acts as a lattice enabling cell adhesion, motil￾ity, and tissue ingrowth has been imitated by many scaffolds (Frisch, Schaller 
and Cieply, 2013). Primary biodegradable polymeric substances or ceramics are 
being researched as scaffolds for tissue engineering of bones. Scaffolds currently 
contain the popular cell adhesion ligand arginine–glycine–aspartate (RGD), 
which helps cells adhere more effectively. An ability of a scaffold to replicate the 
extracellular framework and direct the activity and growth of implanted cells is 
improved by the incorporation of the RGD ligand, particularly through the devel￾opment of polymer–RGD peptide hybrid compounds or via the surface modif ca￾tion of premade polymers (Shakesheff, Cannizzaro and Langer, 1998). In terms 
of bone engineering, this has been demonstrated that adding carbon nanotubes 
and micro-hydroxyapatite (HA) particles into PLA-based scaffolds to form nano￾composites improves MSC adhesion and osteoprogenitor development (Ciapetti 
et al., 2012). Additionally, it was discovered that adding a biomimetic HA sur￾face drastically changed the microenvironment of adhering preosteoblasts and 
encouraged cellular projecting survivability and expansion along irregular sur￾faces (Chou et al., 2005). 
It is therefore not shocking that mimicking apatite nanoparticles could increase 
the osteogenic ability of progenitor cells given that HA mimics the natural mineral 
framework of bone. In laboratory rat calvarial imperfections, HA-coated PLGA 
scaffolds discovered to help with bone regeneration, and more exposition of HA 
nanoparticles over the scaffold surface were observed to cause rapid bone deposi￾tion through local progenitors (Kim et al., 2007). Additionally, it is known that 
apatite-coated PLGA scaffolds encourage the development of seeded preosteo￾blasts. Chou et al. discovered that MC3T3-E1 cells grown on 3D apatite-coated 
PLGA displayed noticeably increased expression amounts for markers of bone 
development (Chou, Dunn and Wu, 2005). It has recently been demonstrated that 
protein adsorption layers control the way these cells respond to apatite nanopar￾ticles. The aforementioned protein layers may modify the surface potential or 
charge or infuence phase transformation of the compound calcium phosphate 
( Tsang et al ., 2011 ). 
Regarding bone tissue engineering, designed electrospun thermoplastic 
polyurethane(TPU)/hydroxyapatite scaffolds is an emerging solution. The research￾ers assessed the impact of scaffold physical characteristics and osteoblast-like cell 
functionality on the characteristics and particle dimensions of (micro and nano) HA 
polymer. Despite the assistance of a carrier polymer, Leszczak et al. (2014) designed  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
146 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
an electrospun as natural demineralized matrix of bones (DBM). DBM is referred 
to as an allograft bone that has the protein building blocks of bone but has had the 
inorganic material eliminated. These parts include crucial growth factors, including 
sticky ligands and osteoinductive impulses. Poologasundarampillai et al. (2014) have 
developed an electrospun of the calcium-incorporated SiO 2 fbers employing sol– 
gel remedies for bone regeneration in order to generate bioactive three-dimensional 
scaffolds containing a cotton-wool-like structure (Poologasundarampillai et al., 
2014). For the production of Si–O–Si linear chains, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) 
has been hydrolyzed and condensed beneath acid-catalyzed conditions (Khajavi, 
Abbasipour and Bahador, 2016). 
12.5 NANOTHERAPEUTICS IN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY 
Surgical implantable biomaterials have evolved into crucial elements of orthope￾dic surgery, partly as a result of their superior osteointegration and stimulation 
of healthy bone mechanisms when compared to traditional materials (Mazaheri 
et al., 2015). These critical advancements occur at a crucial moment when the 
aging population raises the requirement for orthopedic implants. As an example, it 
is projected that more than 600,000 joint implants are used annually in the United 
States and that number is rising (Christenson et al., 2007). Orthopedic implants are 
utilized in an assortment of methods across the human body in various parts; how￾ever, nanomaterials added to surgical implants improve their overall functionality 
and work effectively. Figure 12.3shows the nanotherapeutic approaches in bone 
repair in surgeries. 
Bone allografts as well as autografts, more traditional ways of treating bone 
abnormalities, continue to be used frequently. They are thought to make up close 
to 80% of bone defect procedures ( Pd, 2013 ). Potential risks associated with these 
methods, particularly for minor abnormalities, include infection, immune system 
rejection, and protracted repair time frames ( Pd, 2013 ). Nanomaterial implants have 
reduced many of these hazards, nonetheless they still occasionally fail. Nanomaterial￾based implants have not yet been able to restore full capability, and they frequently 
only last for several decades at most. Complete implant failure is a possibility and 
can be extremely diffcult, necessitating time-consuming and costly re-operations 
( Christenson et al ., 2007 ). 
However, the application of nanotechnology in surgical implants for orthopedics 
has been demonstrated to be immensely advantageous, enhancing the management 
of numerous bone abnormalities and orthopedic injuries. Numerous materials have 
been researched and employed, resulting in the utilization of a wide range of pro￾spective materials, each with their own special qualities and advantages. Gelatin, 
ceramics that have a bioactive nature, polymers that are biodegradable, and polysac￾charides like agarose are a few examples of materials. Since they may encourage 
cell proliferation and tissue regeneration owing to their physical characteristics and 
nanoscale capabilities, these nanomaterials can function well inside the human body. 
In order to replicate the functions of cells, which additionally possess nanometer￾scale dimensions and aggregate to create extracellular matrix structures, these 
nanomaterials must be able to mimic the environment inside of cells. Additionally, Nanotherapeutics in Orthopedics 147 FIGURE 12.3 Nanotechnologies in bone repair.

13 Nanotherapeutics for 
Global Health Challenges 
INTRODUCTION 
The term “global health” frst emerged in academic writing in the early 1940s ( Dunham, 
1945 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently adopted it as direction 
and foundational theory ( Kickbusch, 1986 ). It can be concluded that global health is 
a recently established feld of health sciences, emerging from the felds of medicine, 
public health, and worldwide health with major contributions provided by the WHO. 
It is based on studies that have been published in the international scientif c com￾munity and through the experiences in research, instruction, imparting, and practice. 
They are distinct from the global health initiative because it focuses solely on medi￾cal and healthcare challenges with a global effect ( Chen et al ., 2020 ). Its primary 
mission is searching for global remedies for problems with a global health effect; and 
( Kickbusch, 1999 ) its ultimate objective is to apply the strength of academic research 
and science to advance health for all else, increase health equity, and lessen dispari￾ties in healthcare ( Chen et al ., 2020 ). Therefore, even if global health research studies 
and practice are able to be carried out locally, global health focuses on populations 
in every nation and incorporates all sectors outside of the medical and health systems 
( Beaglehole and Bonita, 2010 ). 
The global health challenges comprise a number of communicable and noncom￾municable diseases. Infectious diseases including microbial infections are the king￾pins in the category of communicable diseases, and cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular 
diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, kidney diseases, genetic disorders, etc. are the 
kingpins in the category of the noncommunicable diseases. Additionally, sanitary 
issues such as menstruation health, personal hygiene, adult care, and their hygiene 
are important when taking into account the challenges facing global health. Seven 
objectives have been set forth by the Grand Challenges in Global Health (GCGH) 
program in an effort to address the current drawbacks of modern medicine (Singer 
et al., 2007). The GCGH’s improved vaccine program aims to reduce treatment 
costs, boost therapeutic effectiveness, and provide new methods of drug delivery to 
completely remove the possibility of reused needles. The therapeutic effectiveness of 
recently developed pharmacological substances can be directly impacted by a vari￾ety of factors, including their scalability, capability to regulate discharge rate, and 
targeted liberation (Charrois and Allen, 2004; Siepmann et al., 2004). Discovering 
safer alternatives to therapy is especially important because chemotherapy is cur￾rently known to have negative side effects that can last both long and short periods 
of time (Partridge, Burstein and Winer, 2001). Innovative solutions are required in 
light of these diffculties in order to enhance treatment for patient successes on an 
international basis.

152 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
Nanotherapeutics may soon be able to help with the resolution of some of the most 
pressing issues in global health. Numerous studies have previously shown that, as com￾pared to conventional procedures, utilizing nanotechnology may increase therapeutic 
effectiveness as well as security. Despite the fact that human clinical trials to evaluate 
the effectiveness and safety of drugs that utilize nanotherapeutics have begun to emerge 
(Hrkach et al., 2012), there are still numerous issues that need to be resolved before future 
commercialization, broad adoption, and clinical acceptability can take place. These 
obstacles encompass the necessity for long-term substance/therapeutic preservation, the 
accessibility of signifcant clinical trial fnancing, social and ethical concerns, poten￾tial negative effects on healthcare and ecosystems, regulatory constraints, and an intel￾lectual property framework that is always changing. Fortunately, novel approaches that 
have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration are paving the way for 
a wider application of nanotechnology in healthcare. Future collaborative initiatives in 
nanotherapeutics will have a benefcial effect on society. The prospective of global health 
appears to be bright as the biomedical research feld proceeds to accomplish important 
strides toward the discipline of nanotherapeutics (Miele, Spinelli and Miele, 2009). 
13.1 IMMUNOLOGICAL APPROACHES IN 
MICROBIAL INFECTIONS 
Bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites are among the pathogenic organisms causing 
infectious diseases, which continue to account for a large percentage of hospitaliza￾tions and fatalities globally. There are signifcant hurdles to overcome in the suc￾cessful management of infectious diseases, despite signifcant progress made with 
antibiotic agents (Kaufmann et al., 2018). The continual emergence of novel viruses 
and bacteria as a result of adaptation and other biological processes further renders it 
diffcult to regulate and prevent infectious diseases. Therefore, in addition to f nding 
novel antiviral drugs and antibiotics for preventing and controlling infection, creative 
methods must be devised to increase the effectiveness of currently available thera￾pies (Dickey et al., 2017). In fact, vaccination has signifcantly decreased the number 
of hospitalizations and mortality rates imposed by infectious diseases, rendering it 
one of the most simple and cost-effective measures. Unfortunately, there continues 
to be numerous cases of infectious diseases without vaccines, like Chlamydia and 
tuberculosis infections (Monno et al., 2001). In other instances, the use of vaccina￾tions that contain inactivated or attenuated live pathogenic organisms potentially 
raises safety concerns, whereas recently produced subunit vaccines typically exhibit 
poor immunogenicity. As a result, the development of vaccines and novel antibiotics 
urgently requires breakthrough technology (Pardi et al., 2018). Figure 13.1 shows the 
global status of infectious diseases (Kirtane et al., 2021). 
According to Singh et al. (2017 ), nanotechnology is a novel approach that can 
both mitigate the numerous drawbacks of antiviral medications and antibiotics and 
increase their therapeutic effects. In this regard, a wide range of nanoparticles have 
been investigated to increase drug dissolution rate/stability, extend circulation period 
of time, overcome biological obstacles, increase bioavailability, focus on infection 
locations, and modulate the way drugs release in accordance with biochemical sig￾nals associated with pathological alterations in order to enhance therapeutic eff cacy Nanotherapeutics for Global Health Challenges 153 FIGURE 13.1 Infectious diseases represent a chronic healthcare burden around the world and as such are high-priority targets for investigational drugs.

154 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
and reduce adverse effects during the management of infectious diseases (Xiong 
et al., 2014). Abed and Couvreur (2014), Forier et al. (2014), Han et al. (2017), and 
other studies have shown that nanoparticle-based approaches have an important 
opportunity to decrease the progression of resistance or completely shift acquired 
resistance (Kumar, Curtis and Hoskins, 2018), through encouraging intracellular 
uptake, altering the route of drug distribution in subcellular organelles, inf uencing 
drug–pathogen communications, and/or imposing an anti-biof lm effect. 
Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles are excellent 
at boosting cellular and humoral immunity, which in turn can increase the effective￾ness of adjuvants and antigens (Stewart and Keselowsky, 2017). Nanoparticles are 
capable of delivering antigens to specifc lymphoid tissues, cell types that present 
antigens, along with subcellular compartments that are intriguing while shielding 
them from proteolytic degradation (Al-Halifa et al., 2019). Based on these charac￾teristics, nanoparticles enable subunit vaccines to be administered at lower dosages 
while continuing to deliver desired immunological responses. They also signif￾cantly reduce nonspecif c immune activation carried on by systemic administration 
of soluble antigens (Lybaert et al., 2018). 
Additionally, antigens are capable of being given to mucosal surfaces with pinpoint 
accuracy, producing the anticipated mucosal immunity for defense against infec￾tions that spread through the mucosa (Narasimhan, Goodman and Vela Ramirez, 
2016). Additionally, cross-presentation can be signifcantly increased through 
nanoparticle-mediated intracellular administration of exogenous antigens, mak￾ing it highly favored for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines (Smith, Simon 
and Baker, 2013). In recent times, bioinspired nanoparticles alongside optimized 
surface bio-physicochemical characteristics have been produced using nanotech￾nology and biomimetic techniques for delivering medications and vaccine devel￾opment (Parodi et al., 2017). In order to create these biomimetic nanoparticles, 
which have a variety of benefts, the performance, complexity, and biological 
compatibility of biological substances are merged with the variation, tailorability, 
and repeatability of synthetic nanomaterials (Meyer, Sunshine and Green, 2015). 
Nature-inspired nanoparticles alone can serve as potent nanotherapies or nanovac￾cines toward infectious diseases because of their inherent activity. They may also 
perform as sophisticated nanocarriers that allow targeted delivery of medicines or 
vaccinations. 
Additionally, to deal with the molecular and cellular occurrences that predomi￾nate in vivo biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties of biomimetic 
nanotherapies that are being developed, mechanistic investigations should be car￾ried out. In context with recent developments in the medical and life sciences as 
well as the advancements in nanotechnology, it is imperative to keep expanding the 
kinds and uses of biomimetic nanoplatforms. Additional cutting-edge innovations 
can be incorporated, such as computational drug design, materials genome, and 
sophisticated artifcial intelligence, for the development of more effective and useful 
nanoparticles that use bioengineering methodologies. Given the noteworthy clinical 
effectiveness of bioinspired nanovaccines and nanomedicines, it is hoped that the 
biomimetic tactic-based nanotherapeutic area will soon offer innovative therapies 
over infectious diseases (Dong et al., 2019).

13.2 RESOLUTION FOR ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 
Despite notable effectiveness of antibiotics, there continue to be several obstacles 
that treatments for microbial infections must overcome, most notably propensity of 
bacteria to acquire antibiotic resistance. Due to the dwindling supply of potent medi￾cations, multidrug-resistant (MDR) germs appear to be a persistent worry. Bacterial 
infections are a severe global healthcare concern with dire repercussions. There is 
currently a battle between the development of therapies and the emergence of antibi￾otic resistance in microorganisms as a consequence of the swift growth of antibiotic 
resistance in microorganisms and the sluggish and decreasing development of novel 
antibiotics (Courtney et al., 2016). 
Figure 13.2shows the mechanisms for antibacterial activity of nanoparticles. 
Pathogens gain resistance against antibiotics by different mechanisms like alterations in 
membrane permeability, multidrug effux pumps development, deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) alterations, drug-degrading activity of enzymes, as well as longer intracellu￾lar residence durations, where therapeutic level of drugs cannot be easily achieved 
(Alekshun and Levy, 2007), consequently requiring higher doses and repeated admin￾istrations of drugs and eventually leading to toxicity or adverse side effects. This com￾plicates compliance and therefore increases the chances to acquire drug resistance. 
Focus of current research is to solve these problems as well as to enhance the anti￾microbial effcacy of available drugs by employing medication delivery systems that 
might be targeted in an accurate manner (Briones, Colino and Lanao, 2008).

156 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
Nanotechnology has advanced signifcantly over the last ten decades. It is 
expected that nanomaterials, especially as antibacterial substances, would even￾tually bridge the gaps left by repeated failures of conventional antibiotics. These 
materials seem to be extremely promising as they have received quite a lot of atten￾tion. The utilization of nanoparticles (NPs) has risen by over fourfold, and recent 
studies emphasizes the antibacterial potential of NPs, particularly against bacteria 
that are resistant to antibiotics (Qayyum and Khan, 2016). Additionally, using NPs 
as a medication carrier might promote and enhance the usage of conventional anti￾biotics. Regardless of the kind of drug and pathogen, metallic and organic NPs 
are being demonstrated to synergize the eradication effectiveness of antimicrobial 
drugs in combination with other treatments (Aditya et al., 2013). 
Additionally, the antibacterial potential of NPs is being thoroughly investigated, 
and it has been discovered that nanoscale components including inorganic ions and 
polymers have strong antibiotic action on their own. According to some concepts, 
the ability of NPs to function as antibacterial agents is triggered through three main 
mechanisms: oxidative stress, metal ion discharge, and nonoxidative stress. These 
three mechanisms must occur simultaneously in order for bacteria to acquire antibac￾terial resistance. As a result, bacterial cells discover it more challenging to develop 
resistance toward NP-mediated antibacterial therapy (Sirelkhatim et al., 2015). 
Drugs can be delivered specifcally using NPs as delivery mechanisms, and their 
prolonged, regulated release allows them to make it to the therapeutic intracellular 
depth. It is possible to prevent drug degradation before it reaches the target and unfa￾vorable drug interactions while also optimizing the physicochemical properties of 
the associated drug. Other benefts of NP delivery platforms include improved drug 
solubility, simultaneous administration of various medications, and longer systemic 
circulation, all of which have been supported by numerous studies (Davis, Chen 
and Shin, 2009). This has led to the endorsement of numerous NP-based therapies, 
including the use of NPs as vaccines for methods of administration to treat a wide 
range of infections that exhibit resistance for conventional therapies. Additionally, 
numerous therapies are presently going toward the preclinical and clinical testing 
phases (Chetoni et al., 2016). 
A variety of MDR clinical strains of bacteria, including MRSA , extended-spectrum￾lactamase-generating Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli, 
and Salmonella typhimurium, were reported to be destroyed by recently discovered 
photoexcited QDs. The redox potentials produced by photogenerated charge trans￾porters, which inhibit MDR bacteria via particular reactions that engage the cellu￾lar redox environment quantum dots, are completely in control of the lethal impact 
( Courtney et al ., 2016 ). AgNPs appear to exhibit antibacterial activity without distin￾guishing between susceptible and resistant strains, according to research involving 
these particles ( Qayyum and Khan, 2016 ). These NPs adhere to the cell membrane, 
impair it, and consequently render it more porous. Once within the cell, silver ions 
also produce free radicals and raise the quantity of ROS that impede respiratory 
enzymes and trigger infammatory reactions, fnally leading to apoptosis. In this 
method, it has been discovered that AgNPs have greater antibacterial action than 
drugs like gentamicin or vancomycin toward MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
(Saeb et al ., 2014 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics for Global Health Challenges 157 
Additional metallic NPs that were originally synthesized to combat antimicrobial 
resistance include Mn, Cu, Zn, Pt, Al, or Ti. These can be used as transporters or 
as naked NPs due to their antibacterial and magnetic properties, which enhance the 
therapeutic effect. ZnO-NPs, which have strong antibacterial action, were utilized 
against a variety of microorganisms. However, the restriction on aggregation renders 
them hazardous for mammalian cells (Kulshrestha et al., 2014). Although excessive 
accumulation of copper is harmful, like various other metals, copper nanoparticles 
are gaining popularity because of their antibacterial and antifungal capabilities. 
Contrary to silver or gold, the human body has copper-transporters responsible for 
regulating copper homeostasis (Usman et al., 2013). Others, such as calcium f uoride 
nanoparticles (CaF2-NPs), are discovered to have anticariogenic property against S. 
mutans. This is because CaF2-NPs stick to the surface of teeth and continuously dis￾charge fuoride ions that not only reduces virulence activities of S. mutans but also 
encourages remineralization (Kulshrestha et al., 2016). 
It is also vital to take into account the numerous processes involved in antibacte￾rial action. Pathogenic bacteria possess surfaces that are negatively charged beneath 
physiological conditions, which is capable of being used for effective bacterial target￾ing with cationic NPs (Sambhy, Peterson and Sen, 2008). Anionic NPs offer better 
targeting because HIV infection causes infected cells to express positively charged 
proteins (Gunaseelan et al., 2010). Active targeting is a different approach to com￾bating resistant strains of microorganisms. Active targeting relies on recognizing 
particular chemicals or ligands on infected cells. The following can be accomplished 
through altering the surface of NPs, which enables NP-based medicine delivery 
systems to target only the pathogenic areas. Receptors, temperatures, or magnetic 
characteristics all can be targeted with active targeting. A variety of NPs and bacte￾ricidal polymeric compounds and peptides have been used to target various bacterial 
species (Byrne, Betancourt and Brannon-Peppas, 2008). Additionally, antimicrobial 
peptides (AMPs) are brief (10–40 amino acid) cationic peptides which are frequently 
utilized for effcient cell targeting (Bahnsen et al., 2013). 
Integrating nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs) containing poly(4-
vinylpyridine) utilizing a bismaleimide as a bonding agent and loading chlorhexidine 
within allowed for controlled release of drugs through pH-sensitive platforms for delivery. 
Under physiological pH, the polymer acts as a gatekeeper by blocking pore openings to 
stop the liberation of cargo molecules. When the pH shifts to an acidic level, which typi￾cally happens during a bacterial infection, the polymeric strains protonate, the polymers 
straighten out owing to electrostatic repulsion, which opens the pores and then eventually 
the cargo is freed (Fullriede et al., 2016). By using these techniques, antibiotic-resistant 
microorganisms might be eliminated. Traditional antibiotics are unable to carry out such 
smart tasks. As a result, nanomaterials have a higher probability of overcoming the chal￾lenges caused by antimicrobial resistance ( Zaidi, Misba and Khan, 2017). 
13.3 SMART APPROACHES FOR NONCOMMUNICABLE 
DISEASES 
Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular diseases, obesity, 
dyslipidemia, cancer, chronic respiratory conditions, kidney diseases, and diabetes,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
158 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
are among the biggest fatalities worldwide and a growing threat to global health. 
Currently, NCDs cause more deaths than all other communicable diseases combined. 
On an annual basis, 41 million individuals globally die from NCDs, or more than 7 
out of 10 fatalities (About global NCDs, 2022). The NCD kills annually 15 million 
individuals prematurely, before they reach the age of 70. This has been exacerbated 
by changing economic, social, and structural conditions, including more people relo￾cating to cities, and the widespread adoption of lifestyle choices that are unhealthy 
(About global NCDs, 2022 ). 
A series of metabolic diseases known as diabetes mellitus are characterized by 
elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). Diabetes is becoming more prevalent 
nowadays. It is predicted that there will be more than 400 million adults globally who 
will be suffering from the disease by 2030 (Shaw, Sicree and Zimmet, 2010). The 
annual global expenses of treating diabetes and its consequences come to US$500 
billion without factoring in indirect expenses like lost productivity ( Zhang et al., 
2010). One intriguing instance concern superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 
(SPION)-containing bioengineered cells which have been discovered to release insu￾lin when hyperthermia is induced externally using alternating magnetic currents. The 
capacity of the cells to produce insulin required in vivo for controlling the amount 
of glucose in the blood has been demonstrated in this investigation. Nanoparticles 
have been synthesized to protect and distribute nucleic acids to specifc cells (Li and 
Mahato, 2011). For instance, in animal models for early diabetes, DNA encoding the 
cytokines interleukin-10 (IL 10) and interleukin-4 has been delivered to white blood 
cells to block the T cell response to residual innate islet cells, avoiding the occur￾rence of diabetes in 75% of utilized laboratory animals (Ko et al., 2001). 
In contrast, to increase the release of insulin and islet viability (Oh et al., 2003), 
a gene that produces glucagon-like peptide 1 is being given using nanoparticles. 
Magnetic nanoparticles covered with the proper peptide-major histocompatibility 
complexes (pMHC-NPs) have been demonstrated to develop a population of I min￾imal-avidity autoreactive CD8+ T cells toward memory-like autoregulatory cells, 
preventing and reversing type 1 diabetes in 75% of laboratory mice (Tsai et al., 2010). 
This was done by employing a nonobese diabetic induced laboratory mouse model. 
Figure 13.3shows the application of nanotechnology in the management of diabetes. 
The widespread type of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenera￾tive disease that frst manifests as memory loss and cognitive decline before causing 
harm to the physiological systems (Sonawane, Ahmad and Chinnathambi, 2019). 
Numerous studies have shown a correlation between the number of soluble masses 
of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and the level of dementia among Alzheimer’s dis￾ease (AD) patients (Fan et al., 2018). They aggregate together resulting in insoluble 
fbrils, and they eventually combine to generate recognizable plaques (Yang et al., 
2005). As a result, the majority of current investigations are focused on preventing 
their aggregation. 
Nanomaterials have been employed for this because of their extraordinary small 
dimensions and ability to traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB). An aggregation can 
be prevented by OX26 mAB-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and the phy￾tochemical agent-grape resveratrol that acts as a neuroprotective, anti-inf ammatory 
substance (Cartiera et al., 2010). The hydrophobic lipid nucleus of SLNs enables the

dispersion of the drug, enhancing bioavailability (Mathew et al., 2012). Additionally, 
they are quickly opsonized and cleared from the circulatory system, providing com￾pelling evidence that these SLN do not concentrate within the bloodstream inappro￾priately, reducing the risks that are associated with them (Misra et al., 2012). Similar 
to this, a mouse arteriole aggregate had been successfully identifed by a monoclonal 
antibody targeting fbrillary human amyloid 42, which was coupled with iron oxide 
NPs (Kundu et al., 2016). 
The second most frequently occurring neurodegenerative disorder is Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) (Esteves et al., 2015). The dopaminergic (DA) neurons within the sub￾stantia nigra pars compacta, which is located in the midbrain selectively perish and 
α-syn Lewy bodies begin growing in this pathological condition (Niu et al., 2017). 
It is discovered that six mutations, including SNCA, PINK 1, DJ-1, ATP13A2, par￾kin, and LRKK2, are responsible for familial PD (Vekrellis, Rideout and Stefanis, 
2004). In the meantime, the relationship between α-syn and the onset of PD has 
been confrmed, researchers are looking for novel approaches to block its expression 
(Desplats et al., 2012). In a current investigation, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) as well 
as an N-isopropylacrylamide derivative were immobilized on oleic acid and incor￾porated into magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). N -Isopropylacrylamide also 
received nerve growth factor addition. ShRNA is a potential treatment for PD since 
it successfully disrupted α-syn production (Ozansoy and Başak, 2013). 
Another neurodegenerative condition, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is 
characterized by damage to the motor neurons, motor cortex region, and the spi￾nal cord. Patients with ALS have abnormal levels of mutated superoxide dismutase 
(SOD). Misfolded SOD 1 has been proposed as the explanation for the orderly course 
of diseases. As a result, SOD level reduction is a major focus of research (Debnath  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
160 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
et al., 2017). Although antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) can successfully quiet 
the proteins, they are ineffective since they cannot cross the BBB. ASOs have been 
embedded onto lipid-covered calcium phosphate NPs to get over this issue. These are 
successfully introduced ASO toward a cell line that resembled neurons when they 
had a negative electrical charge (Bhatt et al., 2015). 
Anxiety, restless movements, and chorea are symptoms of Huntington’s disease 
(HD), that can be described as an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative condition. 
It has been demonstrated that oxidative stress and mitochondrial abnormalities can 
be identifed in biological samples taken from individuals who have neurodegenera￾tive illnesses like HD. Electron transport chains within HD brains are also dysfunc￾tional (Lin and Beal, 2006). Investigators are on the hunt for novel substances that 
might be able to suppress the formation of 3-nitroproponoic acid (3-NP), a neurotoxin 
that causes the development of ROS. Additionally, positive outcomes appeared when 
3-NO-induced mice were supplied with SLNs that were laden with rosmarinic acid 
(Robinson et al., 2018). It has also been shown that siRNA, that can silence or alter 
the expression of mutated HTT, is carried by β-cyclodextrin (CD) NPs. Although 
CDNPs partially exhibited toxicity and signifcantly reduced the total amount of 
mutated gene mRNA, the entire toxicity profle was satisfactory (Vij et al., 2010). 
The gene of cystic fbrosis transmembrane conductance (CFTR) has mutations in 
the life-threatening genetic condition known as cystic fbrosis. A variety of endothe￾lium cells of tissues exhibit aberrant transit patterns, which are its def ning features. 
As a result, the mucus becomes abnormally sticky and thickened, obstructing the 
organs. The lung is the main organ that is obstructed. This results in the develop￾ment of recurring bacterial infections that gradually erode the lung tissues. As a 
consequence, the pulmonary disease broadens to the point where it causes mortality 
(Chen et al., 2006). The CFTR gene repair appears to be an appealing approach for 
treating this condition. Another intriguing method used to treat CFTR infections 
involved ciprofoxacin complex-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs). This 
strategy was chosen to combat the infections that have become inherent to the illness 
itself. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the organism that these antibiotic-incorporated 
NPs were designed to eradicate. Following therapy, mucus was examined for results. 
The mucus reportedly became substantially less turbid, demonstrating a decrease in 
pathogenic bacteria, and the stability of colloidal particles was demonstrated (Sato 
 et al., 2012 ). 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a serious kidney condition characterized 
by a rapid reduction in renal function as well as signifcant morbidity, mortality, and 
medical expenses. Moreover, it additionally poses a high risk of developing chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) (Coca, Singanamala and Parikh, 2012). AKI represents one of 
the most dangerous and frequent consequences among hospitalized patients, causing 
around 2 million fatalities annually throughout the world (Luo et al., 2017). The most 
effective pharmacological therapy available at the moment is costly generalized sup￾portive care (Kellum et al., 2021). In addition to traditional medicines, f avonoids—a 
phytochemical agent—has a signifcance in AKI. However, the use of f avonoids 
for the management of AKI is very constrained due to their low solubility in water 
and permeation capabilities. The accessibility and effectiveness of f avonoids can 
be enhanced by nanocarriers (Córdoba-David et al., 2020). Employing polyvinyl

alcohol (PVA) and Eudragit E100, Zhang and colleagues developed water-soluble 
eupafolin nanoparticles that can overcome the physicochemical issues with the ini￾tial form eupafolin. It increases the water solubility through lowering the particle 
size and all without harming healthy renal cells. Eupafolin NPs have improved anti￾oxidant and anti-infammatory actions, which can reduce LPS-induced kidney injury 
( Zhang et al ., 2017 ). 
Obesity is a chronic and complicated condition, as defned by the International 
Classifcation of Diseases, that affects people all over the world and has a negative 
impact on quality of life (Sandoval-Vargas et al., 2021). Overweight and obesity are 
both defned by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the abnormal accumula￾tion of body fat that has adverse health implications. Dyslipidemia has been recog￾nized as an indicator of obesity and poses signifcant health concerns to those who 
are affected. Due to the existence of adipose tissue malfunction, obesity and dyslip￾idemia are regarded as the primary contributors to the metabolic syndrome. Zhang 
et al. (2018) examined two perspectives on recent developments in nanotherapeutics 
as a new technique for treating obesity. One perspective focused on the inhibition of 
ability to digest, and the other concentrated on the improvement of energy expen￾diture. Even though administered nanocarriers are an effective way to control body 
weight, researchers noted that a number of issues still need to be resolved. These 
include the understanding of the pathways involved in the maintenance of energy 
homeostasis, the reduction of adverse effects, the assessment of the biocompatibility 
in administration for a long time, and, obviously, the completion of effective clinical 
studies and further commercialization (Trandafr et al., 2022). 
Using a total of three distinct strategies, including (i) the repression of angio￾genesis within the white adipose tissues of the body (WATs), (ii) the conversion 
of WATs to brown adipose tissues (BATs), and (iii) the photothermal lipid break￾down of WATs, Sibuyi et al. explained nanotechnology-based therapies to be a 
possible alternative which can be utilized to address obesity and overwhelmed the 
drawbacks associated with standard therapies. The combined nanocarriers demon￾strated high tolerability, decreased adverse reactions, and improved effcacy in a 
repeatable manner, thereby demonstrating the viability of the theory that focused 
on nanotherapy can be used to treat obesity while minimizing its comorbidities 
( Sibuyi et al ., 2019 ). 
On a global scale, cardiovascular disease remains the most prevalent cause of 
death. The diffculties encountered in cardiovascular medicine are a result of poor 
target precision, low distribution effciency, and off-target action of current medi￾cines. Cardiovascular disease is another area where nanotechnology is expanding. 
Individuals with hypertriglyceridemia may beneft from fenof brate nanoformula￾tions that are currently available on the market for assistance with solubility and 
absorption issues. The anti-infammatory cytokine IL (interleukin)-10 was incor￾porated into nanoparticles in a different investigation employing a related type IV 
collagen-targeting method. IL-10 nanotherapy improved macrophage-mediated 
elimination of apoptotic debris and demonstrated comparable protective impacts on 
severe atherosclerosis in Ldlr- /- animals. This suggests that reducing local inf am￾mation may also have proefferocytic effects (Flores et al., 2019).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
162 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
13.4 APPROACHES IN GLOBAL SANITARY ISSUES 
Menstrual hygiene, geriatric hygiene, pediatric hygiene, and personal hygiene are 
all important aspects of global sanitation. Sanitary napkins, adult diapers, baby dia￾pers, undergarments, etc. are important in this case. Every woman should be con￾cerned about menstrual hygiene since it lowers her susceptibility to infections of the 
reproductive tract (RTIs). Commercially accessible feminine hygiene items include 
sanitary napkins, tampons, underpants shields, towels, wipes, and pads for removing 
cosmetics. The feminine sanitary pad or serviette is a crucial disposable absorbent 
hygiene item among these. Its purposes include absorbing and holding onto men￾strual f uid fow, isolating it from the skin, and ensuring comfort, avoiding odor, and 
remaining frmly anchored (Yadav et al., 2016). 
Adult diapers and underpant shields are among the items offered in the geriatric 
personal care marketplace’s absorbent category of products that are relevant to adult 
incontinence. The present product selection is wide-ranging and made to accom￾modate requirements of both sexes along with individuals of all ages (Ajmeri and 
Ajmeri, 2010). A common consumer item, disposable baby diapers, produce about 77 
million tons of solid waste that goes to landflls each year and degrade at least over 
500 years. Additionally, their use is expanding globally (Febo and Gagliardini, 2019). 
Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) along with various compounds have been used 
for a few decades to boost the ability of disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and 
other easily available sanitary items to absorb moisture. Unfortunately, it is typical 
that those sanitary napkins and diapers do not react well against moist circumstances 
due to the several chemical compounds present within them, particularly when used 
as feminine pads during menstruation, superabsorbent polymers, commonly known 
as regular pads, can produce rashes and even infammation. The average nappy 
materials can hold 30 times its own weight in human fuids, demonstrating how 
effective these supplies are at soaking multiple times their own individual weight 
in fuids However, the substance is not biodegradable; under ideal circumstances, a 
nappy may take 500 years to disintegrate (Yadav et al., 2016). 
Compared to superabsorbent polymers (ordinary pads), the nanof ber product 
is more pleasant to use and leaves less residues after use. The structure of the 
nanof ber material is additionally much smoother, leading to a thinner and softer 
item that does not require to be transformed as frequently as the conventional 
pads, thereby providing a more affordable choice, having a smaller environmental 
impact, and being safer for humans compared with the current superabsorbent 
polymer materials. Experiments with saline and synthetic urine supported this 
fnding, showing that the electrospun nanofber material was signif cantly more 
absorbent compared with commercially available items. Since the invention of 
nanotechnology, which promises to have a positive impact on both the environ￾ment and global health, hygiene products are now safer to ingest and dispose of 
( Yadav et al ., 2016 ). 
Electrospinning is a simple and inexpensive method for producing f bers with 
diameters ranging from 10 nm to 10 m. Electrospun fbers can be used in a variety of 
applications due to their signifcant surface-to-volume proportion, tunable porosity, 
and adaptable shape with controlled diameter. As previously stated, the main goal of  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nanotherapeutics for Global Health Challenges 163 
this study is to maximize the high absorption potential of electrospun nanof bers by 
making use of their huge surface area (Yadav et al., 2016). 
Engaging superabsorbent polymer (SAP) encapsulating strategies, S. Yadav et al. 
developed cellulose acetate electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) nanofbers that were 
characterized by their surface shape, comfort, and mechanical attributes. Different 
assessments, including free absorbency, equilibria absorbency, absorbency during 
high loadings, and percentage debris, were carried out in various mediums, including 
distilled water, a solution of saline, and artifcial urine, in order to prove their appli￾cability in female hygiene applications. The outcomes were then contrasted to certain 
well-known commercial feminine hygiene products. It is discovered that adding SAP 
as encapsulating agents of CA nanofbers reduced the porosity and area of the surface 
of (CA) nanofbers. Moreover, in addition to their ability to swell, it reduced their abil￾ity to absorb more fuids than using just CA nanofbers alone. This clearly indicates 
that in the event CA nanofbers are employed to produce the absorbent center in femi￾nine sanitary towels without affecting the absorption effectiveness, the consumption 
of superabsorbent polymers SAP (or in general SAPs) can be avoided. The potential to 
use these nanofbrous membranes in adult diapers and baby diapers is demonstrated 
by the previously mentioned electrospun membranes (Yadav et al., 2016). 
Moreover, a Japanese textile business, Seiren, claims that its Deoest® odor￾eliminating underpants fabricated with the aid of nanotechnology can miraculously 
absorb unpleasant scents (Onoghwarite and Ikechukwu, 2018). This inventive prod￾uct leads to higher demands in personal hygiene products. Furthermore, the com￾pany named Goldwin, which sells Speedo® swimsuits in Japan, emphasizes that 
its upgraded MXP® pants with nanotechnology can absorb the odor from 4 L of 
perspiration. The pants are made of a lightweight, odor-removing, sweat-absorbing, 
antibacterial, antistatic, and eucalyptus and nanotechnology packed fabric from 
Toray. Due to their minimal washing requirements, these odor-eliminating pants 
also conserves water (Onoghwarite and Ikechukwu, 2018). These innovations lead to 
merits in personal hygiene problems globally.

14 Opportunities 
and Challenges of 
Nanotherapeutics 
INTRODUCTION 
Nanotherapeutics, a branch of nanotechnology used in medicine, is still developing. It 
is projected to have a revolutionary impact in the feld of healthcare (Poirot-Mazères, 
2011). The development of nanotherapeutics-based research has tremendously ben￾efted from public investment and legislation (Bawa, 2011). The continuous advance￾ment of nanotherapeutics offers the promise to offer a number of advantages over 
conventional drugs, including increased effcacy, bioavailability, adjustments in dose 
and response, targeting capability, personalization of medicines, and safety (Sajja 
et al., 2009). The design and manufacturing of multifunctional nanoparticle (NP) 
composites that are capable of simultaneously transporting diagnostic and thera￾peutic substances to specifed areas might represent the most captivating idea in 
nanotherapeutics-based investigations (Seigneuric et al., 2010). These features are 
completely revolutionary and highlight signifcant advancements in patient diagno￾sis, care, and follow-up. Nevertheless, critical data about the pharmacokinetics pro￾fles, pharmacodynamics profles, and toxicological data of several nanomaterials 
remains unavailable when considering these potential advantages (Seigneuric et al., 
2010 ). 
Although recent research suggests that certain portions of these substances may 
reach the body of individuals and turn harmful at the level of cells in different body 
fuids, structures, and organs, the scientifc knowledge of the possibility of toxicity 
of nanomaterials remains inadequate at the moment. Due to communication and 
cultural barriers between the nanotechnology research community and the phar￾maceutical industry, collaborations have been hindered and the development of 
nanotherapeutics-based treatments in drug discovery has slowed. Other challenges 
include technical issues, a lack of standardization, unpredictability, public aware￾ness, and assets. Nanotechnology has become extremely multidisciplinary due of 
the wide range of felds involved. This broad range of disciplines could even make 
it diffcult to have meaningful talks and to fnd a shared language. The manufac￾turing sector must raise its level of awareness and its capacity to promote interac￾tions among nanotechnology alongside other communities for the purpose to get 
beyond these obstacles. Nanotechnology combines the expertise of chemists, biolo￾gists, genetic engineers, microbiologists, biotechnologists, and many more research￾ers in various disciplines. The complexity of merging specialties in nanotechnology 
is likely to result in a development of new frms through substantial collaboration 
(Metselaar and Lammers, 2020).

170 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
A number of medications that make use of nanotechnology have been developed 
and authorized and commercialized, and many more are currently being researched, 
despite the fact that nanotherapeutics continues to be in its early stages of develop￾ment. Potential benefts of nanotherapeutics include earlier diagnosis, better, safer, 
and increasingly individualized therapies, as well as lowered expenditures on health￾care. According to several experts, nanotherapeutics will lead to a paradigm shift 
that will alter the healthcare industry over the course of the next ten years (McGrady 
et al., 2010). However, considerably more effort is required to implement testing 
standards, evaluate effcacy, and compile safety data for diverse nanotherapeutic 
agents if substantial advancement is to be achieved toward this aim (Ventola, 2012). 
14.1 ADVANTAGES OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
OVER CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES 
The fundamental components of nanotherapeutic agents, nanoparticles (NPs), can 
change in a variety of ways that can alter function (Godin et al., 2010). NPs, by 
def nition, are small particles having a minimum of one dimension falling between 
the range of 1 and 100 nm. Several larger molecules or massive solids lack in unique 
structural, optical, and electronic features that NPs possess (Godin et al., 2010). 
They also possess increased solubility, making it possible to reexamine equivalents 
in bulk drugs that have been demonstrated to have low solubility (Seigneuric et al., 
2010). This characteristic would make it possible to turn insoluble or barely soluble 
medications into soluble aqueous solutions. The improved bioavailability along with 
duration of circulation brought on by the tiny dimensions of NPs is a further impor￾tant beneft. Regardless of any surface alterations, studies have demonstrated that 
particles less than 200 nm have prolonged circulation durations than larger particles 
( Ventola, 2012 ). 
One of the distinguishing physical properties of NPs is the large surface area 
compared to their size. As the size of the particles gets smaller, the total surface 
area increases exponentially. Increased surface area indicates that a greater propor￾tion of the atoms of the particles are located on their surface as opposed to their core. 
This phenomenon causes NPs to be more reactive than their bulk solid or typically 
larger molecule counterparts. The increased surface area of NPs also contributes to 
their better water solubility and bioavailability (Bawa, 2011). The substantial surface 
area of nanomaterials additionally renders it possible to construct them with a vari￾ety of surface properties, such as conjugation with proteins or electrostatic charges. 
Certain surface features are chosen on the basis of their strategic suitability for aim￾ing targets and other objectives (Ventola, 2012). 
NPs may be able to transport medications to locations that are typically inaccessi￾ble by conventional methods because of their small dimensions (Seigneuric et al., 2010). 
An enhanced permeability of NPs might enable it to penetrate through neovessel 
pores smaller than 1 μm in diameter and deliver cancer medications into tumors 
(Sajja et al., 2009). The enhanced permeation of NPs might allow nanoparticles to 
pass across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by utilizing various absorption pathways. 
NPs may be delivered locally or proactively targeted with the help of ligands that 
are cellular-specifc. Moreover, it is assisted by the features like magnetic localization,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opportunities and Challenges of Nanotherapeutics 171 
dimensions-based selectivity, and additional methods (Galvin et al., 2012). The exte￾rior placement of a static magnetic feld near the exact location of action can improve 
the prospective biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profles associated with these 
NPs. For instance, MRI results from one study showed that magnetic nanoparticles 
(NPs) had moved toward neodymium magnets (NdFeB) which had been positioned 
beyond the cavity of the peritoneum, above grafts of a cancer in human ovaries 
(Galvin et al., 2012). NPs can be developed to integrate a wide range of chemo￾therapeutic drugs that can be directed precisely and promptly to the tumor location 
for greater effcacy and safety. NPs can also be loaded with contrast materials for 
imaging reasons. Multifunctional NP combinations or NPs employed in imaging for 
diagnosis have an advantage over minuscule–molecule contrast agents due to the fact 
they have an enormous surface area which enables targeting by surface changes and 
the capacity to carry therapeutic medicines at the same time (Ventola, 2012). 
Various diagnostic or therapeutic substances can be coupled with nanopar￾ticle interfaces. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which improve intracellular 
transportation, fuorescent agents for imaging, including genetic treatment agents 
like minor inhibitory RNA (siRNA), represent a few suitable biomolecules for 
NP interface conjugation (Bhaskar et al., 2010). The delivery of imaging contrast 
compounds that offer improved sensitivity and specifcity aid in tumor identif ca￾tion. It can also be facilitated by surfaces of NPs attached with a specif c mol￾ecule which attaches to heavily expressed tumor cell receptors (Sajja et al., 2009). 
Additionally, pharmacological therapy may be conjugated to the interfaces of NPs. 
Surface conjugation can improve the eff ciency of NP drug-distribution platforms 
while drastically lowering the toxicity by using ligands which bind to the target 
area selectively (Ventola, 2012). 
An essential and potent principle is tunability underlying NP characteristics. 
NPs have a wide variety of tunable biological, physical, optical, magnetic, chemi￾cal, electric, and mechanical properties that are drastically different from the same 
compounds in larger forms given the altered quantum mechanics that occur at the 
nanoscale stage (Vaddiraju et al., 2010). Scientists can adjust a variety of various fea￾tures of nanoparticles by changing the diameters of NPs. For instance, by changing 
the size of an NP, it is possible to produce different fuorescence colors, enabling the 
use of color coding or labeling in diagnostic imaging applications (Ventola, 2012). 
Besides the aforementioned merits, nanotherapeutic agents have signif cant phar￾macokinetic features which may enhance their signifcance over conventional strate￾gies. Opsonins, which can be described as proteins in the immune system that activate 
the immunological complement pathway and identify the NPs for elimination by 
macrophages along with phagocytes, are often responsible for clearing NPs from 
bloodstream. Hydrophobic particles are removed from circulation more quickly than 
hydrophilic ones, while neutral NPs get minimally opsonized than particles that are 
charged. NPs might be made to be neutral or combined with hydrophilic polymers 
like polyethylene glycol (PEG) in order to increase the duration of circulation (Galvin 
et al., 2012) Modifying liposomal NPs by adding a PEG coating may additionally 
improve their bioavailability for the purpose of preventing uptake by the reticuloen￾dothelial system (RES). Consequently, functionalized liposomes are referred to as 
“stealth liposomes.” NPs are frequently coated with a PEG layer for the purpose of  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
172 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
reducing opsonization, decreasing RES absorption, improving biocompatibility, and 
lengthening circulation duration (Sajja et al., 2009). The coating of hydrophilic poly￾mers (like PEG or dextran) on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO 
NPs) may also make the nanoparticles water soluble. Alternatively, if they have been 
coated with substances that aid in the passage of DNA molecules inside cells, they 
are able to become either amphophilic or hydrophobic. Investigators are now using 
single-walled with multiwalled carbon nanotubes for nanoelectrodes due to their 
nanoscale size, electrocatalytic capabilities, and enormous surface area (Vaddiraju 
 et al., 2010 ). 
Nanotechnologies have already revolutionized genetic and biological assess￾ments through the use of equipment that look at molecular biomarkers. Because of in 
vitro and in vivo testing procedures, these investigations can be completed more rap￾idly, reliably, and inexpensively than traditional approaches. For instance, they might 
utilize nanochips or QDs (Poirot-Mazères, 2011). Additionally, nanotechnologies 
can provide diagnostic tools that tend to be more sensitive and capable of spotting 
early indications of metabolic abnormalities, helping to prevent various noncom￾municable diseases. Personalized medicine will become more common practice as 
long as nanotechnologies are used to provide more effcient and effective ways of 
recognizing molecular biomarkers (Poirot-Mazères, 2011). 
14.2 LIMITATIONS OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Although nanotherapeutics has many advantages, much more studies remain nec￾essary to assess the safe profles and toxicity correlated with various NPs (Galvin 
et al., 2012). Few studies have focused on the pharmacokinetic profles or toxicology 
of NPs, while the majority of nanomedical research has focused on drug delivery 
(Bhaskar et al., 2010). Assessing the impact of NPs on patient populations requires 
research into the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, as well 
as the potential chronic toxicity of NPs in vivo. Investigators and the FDA have a 
formidable challenge in evaluating any nanotherapeutic substance for safety and eff￾cacy, regardless of its classifcation as a medication, device, biological, or combined 
therapy. The FDA is currently working to develop testing guidelines and compile 
safety data ( Ventola, 2012). 
Additionally, research is required to evaluate the immunogenicity of NPs (Vaddiraju 
et al., 2010). Due to their higher reactivity when compared to their typical equiva￾lents, nanotherapeutics can display unexpected adverse consequences. A hyper￾sensitive reaction, which may be brought about by stimulation of the immune 
complement framework, is the side effect associated with nanotherapeutic injec￾tions that is most frequently documented. Finding the crucial dimensions whereby 
nanoparticles (NPs) start to signifcantly concentrate in the body might be aided 
by research on the dimensions and surface characteristics of NPs. NPs have a 
tendency to concentrate in tissues and cellular environment as a result of their 
improved capacity to penetrate biological barriers due to the small dimensions. 
Organs including the liver and spleen can turn into the primary sites of oxidative 
stress due to the apparent tissue accumulation, retention, and sluggish clearance 
of such conceivably free radical generating particles, in addition to the presence  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opportunities and Challenges of Nanotherapeutics 173 
of many phagocytes within the reticuloendothelial system (RES) Ventola, 2012; 
Ahadian and Radisic, 2017). 
Polymer NPs, where data on safety and effectiveness are already known, consti￾tute the mainstay of nanomedical research for a variety of reasons, including a lack 
of information on potential toxicity issues. As a matter of fact, the FDA has already 
given its approval to a number of nanotherapeutic agents that comprise polymer NPs. 
Lipid NPs are additionally believed to be biocompatible and acceptable, unlike other 
compounds that might turn detrimental in NP form ( Galvin et al., 2012). Therefore, it 
is much more preferable to use nanotherapeutic agents that are biodegradable, read￾ily soluble, free of toxic effects than it is to employ bio-persistent compounds, includ￾ing polymer compounds, liposomes, and iron oxide (IO) particles. It may be more 
diffcult to use NPs such as metallic nanocarriers, QDs, and carbon nanotubes which 
are not biodegradable. The attempts to f nd further biodegradable forms, materials, 
and surface modifcations should be strengthened by this trait rather than serving to 
hinder nanomedical research using these NPs (Ventola, 2012). 
Furthermore, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress are the 
four branches of nanotoxicity that can be further broken down. A change in the 
structure of biological organs caused by nanoparticles is referred to as cytotoxic￾ity. When nanotherapeutic compounds alter, modify, or cause abnormalities at the 
chromosomal level, this is referred to as genotoxicity. Oxidative stress results in the 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the disruption of cellular func￾tions, while apoptosis results in programmed cell death. Nanotherapeutics may exert 
harmful effects on host cells that are already alive (Djurišić et al., 2015; Sengul and 
Asmatulu, 2020). 
Figure 14.1 shows the most signifcant toxicity varieties of nanomaterials in the 
body (Aillon et al., 2009). These toxicity manifestations are brought on by various 
chemical pathways (Lanone and Boczkowski, 2006). It is believed that the genera￾tion of oxidative stress via the generation of free radicals is the primary molecular 
explanation for in vivo NP toxic effects. Usually present in high concentrations, free

174 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
radicals can oxidize lipids, proteins, DNA, and various other biological substances. 
Certain researchers believe that the aspect ratio and surface area of NPs, like their 
intrinsic features, can be pro-infammatory and pro-oxidant. However, in addition 
to NPs, other variables, which include the reactions of phagocytic cells to external 
material, a lack of antioxidants, the existence of transition metals, variables in the 
environment, along with other innate chemical or physical features, can also contrib￾ute to the generation of free radicals upon exposure to NPs (Ventola, 2012). 
Through the overexpression of reduction-sensitive transcription factors (such 
NF-B), kinases, as well as activator protein-1, oxidative stress can increase the 
infammatory response of the body (Rahman et al., 2005). Large quantities of these 
free radicals can oxidize and harm biological elements. Due to the poor clearance 
and accumulation of radicals that are free, as well as the predominance of high quan￾tities of phagocytes, particular organs, especially the spleen and liver, become the 
primary targets of oxidative stress. Nanotherapeutic agents can also have an impact 
on organs with a great deal of blood fow, especially the kidney and lung (Arora, 
Rajwade and Paknikar, 2012). Nanotoxicity can originate from interactions between 
nanomaterials and the mitochondria and also with the cell nucleus. Fullerenes, gold 
nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and block copolymer micelles are a few 
examples of nanomaterials that may locate to the mitochondria and cause the pro￾duction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing apoptosis (Unfried et al., 2007). 
Nanoparticles may potentially display additional toxicity pathways as a result of 
their extensive environmental exposure. Thrombosis and hemolysis can arise from 
the absorption of nanostructures into the bloodstream. Additionally, interactions 
between nanomaterials and the immune system raise the danger of immunotoxicity 
(Dobrovolskaia and McNeil, 2016). 
For instance, the resultant particles may be detrimental to living beings if metals 
like Se, Pb, or Cd are able to leach from nanoparticles and subsequently wind up in 
the environment. Additionally, it has been suggested that fullerene molecules that 
are readily soluble in water may cause damage to the brains of largemouth bass, a 
species of fsh that lives in freshwater (Oberdörster, 2004). Dendrimers have also 
been demonstrated to destroy cell membranes, stimulate the coagulation and com￾plement mechanisms, and induce osmotic damage. The effects of interacting with 
nanoparticles upon the human body vary based on their dimensions, chemical com￾position, architecture of the surface, the ability to dissolve, shape, and the extent to 
which they aggregate together. Typical exposure sites for nanoparticles comprise 
the gastrointestinal system, the epidermis, and respiratory organs. Nanoparticles 
possess the ability to alter the way that cells perform. A strategy of essential com￾ponents for toxicity assessment should comprise the physical and chemical evalua￾tion of nanotherapeutic agents, tissue and cellular analyses, and laboratory animal 
investigations in order to ensure maximum safety and minimize exposure (Ahadian 
and Radisic, 2017). 
Environmental consequences are also a cause of concern, while being less 
researched than human health, although there is currently a lot of focus on ecotoxi￾cology, the chemistry of the environment, actions, and destination ( Zhu, Zhu and Li, 
2008). The various ways that nanoparticles can reach the environment and humans 
are depicted in Figure 14.2.

According to Dhawan and Sharma (2010), there are three possible manners that 
nanotherapeutic agents may alter the ecology systems. The frst factor is direct inf u￾ence on invertebrates, microbial f ora, aquatic creatures, and a variety of other spe￾cies; the second factor is reaction with additional contaminants that could alter the 
bioavailability of toxic substances and nutrients; and the third factor is modif ca￾tions to nonliving ecological structures (Dhawan and Sharma, 2010). It is essential 
to comprehend the effects of nanomaterials upon the environment along with the 
well-being of humans for nanomaterials to be developed responsibly and to com￾pletely exploit the potential of its utilizations. As nanotechnology develops, concerns 
are being raised about whether its by-products or materials pose risks to the health 
of humans or the ecosystem, as well as whether its production generates additional 
risks or waste products. Regarding the responsible advancement of nanostructures 
and to completely capitalize on its possible uses, consideration of the effect of nano￾materials upon the ecosystem and human health is a critical stage (Yadav, Mungray 
and Mungray, 2014). 
Although nanotherapeutics exhibit excellent performance in a variety of patients, 
they may have undesired pharmacokinetic alterations in special groups of people 
like geriatric and pediatric population. The changes in their physiological condi￾tion and anatomical status are the hindered reason for these undesired pharmaco￾kinetic alterations. This may also lead to a challenge for nanotherapeutics. When 
considering the pharmacokinetic alterations of nanotherapeutic agents in geriatric  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
176 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
population, typically elderly people (60 years and older) are the most frequent users 
of pharmacological therapies (Martin et al., 2019). Elderly patients rarely participate 
in clinical trials, which is a concern for many medication therapies and is thought to 
reduce the effcacy after it is transferred to the clinic (Shenoy and Harugeri, 2015). 
Considering two-thirds of people over 60 consuming four or more medications 
(Elliott, 2006) and 85% of those over 60 years old consuming at least one medi￾cine, it seems clear that therapies, including nanotherapeutics, will predominantly 
be delivered to this older age group. In a drug-dependent manner, aging encourages 
alterations to the pharmacokinetic profles and pharmacodynamic profles of almost 
all drugs (Khan and Roberts, 2018). This could hinder the benefts that a nanothera￾peutic agents could provide on the accumulation of a therapeutic drug in the instance 
of nanotherapeutics. On the other hand, age-associated pharmacokinetic alterations 
that can reduce the effectiveness of a drug in elderly patients may be overcome using 
nanotherapeutics. 
In terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME), aging 
is linked to decreased oral medication absorption and modifcations to their pharma￾cokinetic profle (Vinarov et al., 2021). Numerous reasons infuence the prolonged 
absorption of medications and metabolites seen in aged people; however, the main 
cause is reduced blood fow to the majority of organs, especially the mesenteric 
system. Importantly, for injectable substances, elderly individuals have comparable 
pharmacodynamic reactions to them as younger patients (e.g., rapid acting insulin), 
indicating there are minimal age-related alterations in injectable absorption (Heise 
et al., 2017). Age is correlated with a reduction in muscle mass, higher fat mass, 
and increasing bodily water and organ mass. Frailty is frequently connected with a 
decline in fat mass at extremely advanced ages (>85 years) (Hilmer, Wu and Zhang, 
2019). Beyond the age of 50, body fuid levels fall and body fat levels rise by 1% of 
years (Hilmer, 2008). This results in a reduction in the amount of hydrophilic medi￾cation distributed and a spike in the passage of lipophilic medications (Mclean and 
Le Couteur, 2004). This might have an impact on the transportation of hydrophilic 
and lipophilic NPs within aging animals, although this has not been studied as yet. 
According to Payne and Bearden (2006 ), tissue perfusion declines with age, espe￾cially in muscular and splanchnic tissues (Payne and Bearden, 2006). A schematic 
comparison of the hepatic clearance of nanotherapeutics in a healthy liver and an 
aging liver is shown in Figure 14.3. 
According to Mclean and Le Couteur (2004), aging is related with a 20–50% 
decline in hepatic blood fow, which affects the ability of the liver to eliminate f ow￾dependent substrates from the body and perform frst pass metabolism. Defenestration 
of scavenger endothelial system in the liver (LSECs), thickening of the endothelial 
tissues, and accumulation of collagen are collectively known as pseudocapillariza￾tion which affects the passive transport from the bloodstream to hepatocytes (Le 
Couteur et al., 2008). The hepatic clearance of stream-limited substrates is simi￾larly decreased by these aging changes. Aging has an impact on the mononuclear 
phagocyte system (MPS), LSECs, immunoglobin G (IgG), and complement systems’ 
phagocytic cells. The generation of cytokines, particularly IL-6, is rising in KCs and 
macrophages; however, phagocytosis capacity has decreased (Hunt et al., 2019). The 
metabolism of nanotherapeutic agents in aging animal models and older individuals

FIGURE 14.3 Hepatic nanomaterial clearance pathways (left) are impaired in the aging 
liver (right). Aging decreases circulating albumin and IgG with increased complement activa￾tion. Increased activated immune cells promote phagocytosis of nanomaterials by modif ed 
complement pathways. Degraded nanomaterials are actively cleared across the liver endothe￾lium with passive transport inhibited by loss of fenestrations and collagen deposits. Hepatic 
and bile uptake of nanomaterials are limited due to reduced soluble transporters and impaired 
hepatic metabolism.

may be impacted by a variety of circumstances. Given the decline in phagocytosis 
by phagocytic cells as well as the passive and active clearance via LSECs, it is pos￾sible that aging will result in extended duration in circulation of nanotherapeutics. 
According to Mclean and Le Couteur (2004), the glomerular fltration rate (GFR) 
(passive f ltration of ultra-particles from the plasma) declines by 15–40% with age. 
Due to rising renal vascular resistance, the f ow of plasma through the kidneys also 
declines with aging more quickly than GFR (Fliser et al., 2005 ). When determining 
the medication dosage given to elderly patients, age-related alterations to renal func￾tion constitute a crucial factor to take into account. 
The absence of accurate PK data in pediatrics continues to be a serious issue 
advances in nanotechnology for better drug delivery. It is challenging to design 
nanoparticle formulations for the pediatric population due to the diversity and dis￾tinctions between the patient community and adults. Neonatal, babies, toddlers, as 
well as children are some of the subgroups among the population that can be dis￾tinguished based on age. Pediatric patients differ from adults in terms of their pre￾ferred methods of administration, the toxicity of medications, and the bioactivity of  
 
 
178 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
both the active substance and formulation excipients. The diffculties with dosing are 
made worse by rapid growth of children and development, when the doses of some 
formulations might change by 100 times. Due to the dearth of formulations that are 
age-appropriate, medical practitioners are forced to utilize medications outside of 
the recommended dosage range, which increases the risk of toxic effects or subthera￾peutic dose. This problem is exacerbated by the paucity of pharmacokinetics (PK) 
data in pediatrics (Yellepeddi, Joseph and Nance, 2019). 
14.3 IMPLEMENTATION OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Nanotherapeutic compounds modify the effcacy and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in 
a manner similar to linkers, antibodies, peptides, and viral vectors. This is impor￾tant because nanomaterial may be able to compensate for the effcacy and toxicity 
issues with novel pharmaceutical formulations that were unsuccessful in phase 2 
or 3 clinical studies (Harrison, 2016). The diffculties of completing this endeavor 
is further highlighted by the restricted translation of nanotherapeutics (He et al., 
2019). Irrespective of how nanotechnology is thought to be inert or active in their 
functions within the human body, nanotherapeutics have been categorized as drugs 
to handle regulatory diff culties with nanotechnology. According to Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) recommendations, early phase in vivo investigations for all 
formulations of drugs should include hematology, clinical chemistry, gross pathol￾ogy, immune response, tissue measurements, and histological analysis. The practical 
application of nanotherapeutics that are intended to have an extended circulation 
and become resistant toward metabolism and clearance could prove challenging 
given the current regulations. Decreased biodegradability and probable accumula￾tion in organs other than the intended target may be major obstacles to approval 
from regulators. Additionally, using nanomaterials with extremely reactive surface 
chemistry could encourage the production of ROS, especially when combined with 
heavy metals (Malaviya, Shukal and Vasavada, 2019). Due to the fact that nanopar￾ticles are essentially medications in and of themselves featuring a wide spectrum 
of adverse reactions, regulatory assessments of these materials are extremely chal￾lenging. Therefore, it is crucial that nanomaterial qualities be taken into account 
in different regulatory mechanisms that are particularly created with nanomaterial 
absorption, distribution, cellular uptake, metabolism, therapeutic action, and elimi￾nation in mind. 
With the aforementioned considerations, nanotechnology should be seen as an 
enabling technological framework with a variety of possible applications in biotech￾nology, healthcare, information technology, and cognitive technology. In the past, 
regulatory systems were dispersed, decentralized, and prone to gaps and problems 
(Allan et al., 2021; Devasahayam, 2019). However, according to Devasahayam’s 
analysis from 2019, the global legislative metronomy currently in effect at the 
time is suffcient for adapting to the measurements needed for nanotechnology 
(nanometrometry). 
The legal structure and technical methodologies necessary for the safety and quality 
monitoring of nanotherapeutics were discussed by Halamoda-Kenzaoui et al . (2021 ) in 
a recent study. The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements

for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines for medical 
products and CEN—European Committee for Standardization/ISO—International 
Organization for Standardization—are just a couple of the guidelines that have been 
published by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the FDA, respectively. 
Additional evaluations are needed due to the complexity and tendency to interact with 
biological networks. Humanized biodistribution and ADME issues for in silico remain 
crucial topics to overcome. There will be further changes in ADME in older individuals 
as well as pediatric patients that are not foretold by young laboratory animal models. 
Finally, to support current physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK) 
models for the implementation of nanotherapeutics, novel investigations must to be 
carried out in young and aging animal models. Patients with weak immune systems 
and other comorbidities must be taken into account as well. Therefore, consideration 
should be given to each of these crucial areas in order to use nanotherapeutics as a 
promising perspective to usher in an era of innovation in healthcare ( Hunt et al ., 2022 ).

15 Future Prospects of 
Nanotherapeutics 
INTRODUCTION 
Despite gaining traction in the clinical setting, nanotherapeutics continue to focus 
on novel drugs and their disease implications. Aside from observing from a rela￾tively safe academic vantage point, the nanotherapeutics research community should 
make a concerted effort to envision clinical practice application in each research 
project it undertakes (Bregoli et al., 2016). It is anticipated that by raising end-user 
awareness, beginning with the formulation design and bench trial stages, a more 
precise understanding of the entire effort and investments required will emerge. It 
is possible to make wise decisions regarding the preclinical testing setup, manufac￾turing requirements, and even production methods after carefully considering the 
market opportunity, therapeutic positioning, and the clinical study design, like its 
therapeutic endpoints. Investigative nanotherapeutics have to adhere to this method 
of rigorous strategy development and navigation via clinical translation in order to 
eventually fulfll their promise of greater benefcial effects for patients (Moghimi, 
Hunter and Murray, 2005). 
In the last three decades, nanotechnology has contributed to great strides in the 
medical sector. The development of a signifcant amount of nanotherapeutics has 
proven their promise in the identifcation and management of diseases (Choi and 
Han, 2018). Furthermore, it is predicted that they will eventually replace current 
diagnostic and therapeutic methods. The current status of nanotherapeutics in pre￾clinical and clinical trials is vital to examine further, as is how it will develop in the 
future to treat life-threatening diseases, enhance quality of life, and collaborate with 
the most recent technological breakthroughs. According to Shi et al. (2022), future 
nanotherapeutics should have three crucial characteristics. They are multifunction￾ality (by combining features like diagnosis, visualization, and therapy), intelligence 
(by using artifcial intelligence to guide the design of nanostructures and the utiliza￾tion of nanorobots), and precision and personalization (by including patient classif￾cation and specifcally chosen regimen selection) (Shi et al., 2022).
 Signifcant contributions have been particularly successful at encouraging sci￾entists to engage in biomedical research and fostering relationships with biologi￾cal researchers. However, there has been noticeably ineffcient use of these assets 
frequently as a result of inadequate conceptualization and communication, which 
resulted in misplaced programs (Bawa and Johnson, 2007). Accelerated “trans￾lation” of nanotechnologies, or the transfer of scientifc discoveries from the lab 
bench to the clinical setting, has been emphasized from the beginning. While this 
is an admirable objective, it minimizes the fact that considerable basic study is 
still required to understand how nanomaterials interact with biological things.

Future Prospects of Nanotherapeutics 183 
The protracted debate regarding whether carbon nanotubes are harmful or not 
(Aschberger et al., 2010) is just one illustration of the extent to which important 
fundamental knowledge exists. 
It could be dangerous to attempt to translate concepts to the clinic before fully 
understanding the basic ways that nanomaterials connect to biological systems. A 
signifcant portion of the employees produced by these massive initiatives involves 
the development of new technology (Armarego, 2022). This is undoubtedly crucial; 
as already mentioned, a lack of communication among nanotechnologists and bio￾medical scientists frequently leads to “seeking the solution of a problem” as opposed 
to technologies that effectively deal with clinical issues. As a result, the literature 
on nanotherapeutics is replete with articles that detail ingenious, elegant advance￾ments in nanotechnology along with predictions of its potential clinical or diagnostic 
application (Sakamoto et al., 2010). However, many of these technologies stagnate 
instead of developing into useful applications. It is a reason to wonder if massive 
and well-managed programs are the best approach to advance nanotherapeutics at a 
time when the National Institutes of Health are facing severe f nancial constraints. 
A more productive solution might be giving smaller funds to individual researchers 
who are connected to a system of multi-institutional core centers in order to gain 
the maximum performance of nanotherapeutic research (Nordmann and Rip, 2009). 
15.1 SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIONS OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
Comparing nanotherapeutics to traditional small-molecule medications, these latter 
show distinct advantages regarding clinical performance. In-depth research in the 
feld of nanotherapeutics over the last three decades has resulted in a substantial 
amount of nanotherapeutic agents being commercialized globally along with a pipe￾line of candidates becoming translated. According to a recent study by Zhang et al. 
(2020), a bibliometric study of the Web of Science Core Collection reveals that nano￾medical studies have surged in recent years and that, from 2000 to 2019, the total 
amount of annual publications increased by over tenfold (Figure 15.1 (a)) ( Zhang et 
al., 2020). The study of the delivery of medications and drugs or therapies comprises 
up to 76% of all nanomedical investigations, and it represents one of the main study 
felds in nanotherapeutics, contributing to 49% of publications throughout the last 
two decades (Figure 15.1 (b)) ( Zhang et al., 2020). With 26% of all published stud￾ies in this area during the last two decades, the United States continues to be the 
dominant nation in nanotherapeutic research, closely followed by China with 22% 
(Figure 15.1 (c)). More than 16% of articles come from Europe; Japan and India each 
contributes 5% and 6%, respectively ( Zhang et al., 2020). 
According to shifts in the geographical location of nanotherapeutic investiga￾tions, Asia is an area for nanotherapeutic research that is developing more quickly 
than the United States or Europe. It may eventually become the most powerful busi￾ness marketplace for nanotherapeutics. Nevertheless, the West continues to lead the 
way in clinical nanotherapeutics translation; other nations and regions should pri￾oritize clinical nanotherapeutics translation as well as fundamental nanotherapeutic 
research. The global commercialization of nanotherapeutics is expanding (Malviya 
 et al., 2021 ). 184 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics FIGURE 15.1 Bibliometric analysis of research in nanomedicine, from the Web of Science Core Collection.

Future Prospects of Nanotherapeutics 185 
North America and Europe presently hold a majority of the global market for 
nanotherapeutics because of the benefts involved in the sheer number of patented 
nanotherapeutics as well as their advantageous regulatory systems. Nevertheless, 
nanotechnology-based healthcare industry in Asia is expanding quickly due to a 
recent surge in funds for nanotherapeutic research and a boom in demand for bet￾ter disease remedies. Numerous nanotherapeutics have been given the receive￾ahead for entering into commercial production or are now undergoing clinical 
testing ( Zhang et al., 2020). 
The total number of journal publications on the topic of nanotherapeutics is con￾tinuously increasing, and the felds of “Drug Carriers” along with “Drug Delivery 
Platforms” are growing especially quickly, in accordance with an analysis performed 
by Shi et al. (2022). In their research, they have made some signif cant discoveries. 
Those conclusions include that the Department of Health and Human Services (NIH 
and others) has provided more fnancing for indications besides cancer than it has 
for cancer, there has been a lot of funding for HIV/AIDS-related applications, and 
the majority of cancers are being affected, although there are many clinical studies 
for non-cancer symptoms like pain and infections, the majority of them are concen￾trated on breast, cutaneous, metastatic, and ovarian cancers. Since the majority of the 
clinical trials of nanotherapeutics are currently in phases I and II, it may take some 
time before they have a signifcant impact on patients. Moreover, Shi et al. (2022) 
revealed that the bulk of current trials are testing nab-paclitaxel/Abraxane and lipo￾somes, which are two well-known nanotherapeutic formulations, along with other 
treatments. However, since 2009, there have been more clinical trials using various 
nanotherapeutic formulations. Only a small percentage of the experiments involve 
dendrimers or micelles. Taken as a whole, the report presents an impression of nano￾therapeutics that continue to receive signifcant funding and study, however with few 
recent advances. It remains uncertain whether nanotherapeutics will ever offer the 
“silver bullet” for the treatment of cancer or other disorders ( Zhang et al., 2020). 
Furthermore, nanoparticles or nanostructures have been detected in many medi￾cines or diagnostic tools under development or already available. Technologies 
for tissue engineering, systems for delivering drugs for diagnosis or therapy, tests 
for sensing, drug evaluation, and different kinds of assays are among them. Some 
products, like sunscreen, skincare items, and dietary additives, are OTC (over-the￾counter). Doxil and Abraxane are two examples of nano-based medications that have 
been approved by governments (such as the Food and Drug Administration in the 
United States), while many others are through various levels of clinical and preclini￾cal testing (Juliano, 2012; Zhang et al., 2020). 
15.2 FUTURE OF NANOTHERAPEUTICS 
The therapeutic eff cacy of conventional medications may be increased by integrat￾ing nanotechnology. Nevertheless, since several nanotherapeutics do not particularly 
target lesions, techniques cannot prevent their toxic effects toward healthy tissues. 
The development of precise, highly effective medications that concentrate in lesions 
instead of accumulating in healthy nontargeted regions is one of the top priorities for 
the upcoming generation of nanotherapeutics.  
 
 
186 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
The development of intelligent medication delivery devices with active targeted 
delivery and stimulus responsiveness has been a crucial requirement in the advance￾ment of nanotherapeutics. These intelligent systems for delivering drugs offer both 
an excellent chance and an important hurdle for the forthcoming development of 
nanotherapeutics in terms of their potential to destroy pathological tissues while 
safeguarding normal tissues. A number of excellent research papers have just been 
released that list the nanotherapeutic formulations that have been granted approval 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or additional regulatory agencies 
worldwide, or at least those that are undergoing clinical trials (McGoron, 2020). 
Figure 15.2 illustrates the challenges that must be solved for clinical transla￾tion of nanotherapeutic medicines beyond the laboratory benchtop (Metselaar and 
Lammers, 2020). Most of the evaluations focus on cancer specifcally, while oth￾ers provide more general assessments of nanotherapeutics. It was anticipated that 
novel formulations of doxorubicin (Doxil) would appear soon after the introduc￾tion of the liposomal dosage form formulation in 1995 (Barenholz, 2012). A year 
later, daunorubicin liposomal drug (DaunoXome) received approval. A perspective 
posed by Venkatraman mentioned that “has nanomedicine lived up to its poten￾tial?” (Venkatraman, 2014). Five novel nanomedicine formulations have been autho￾rized since that article was published. Nanomedicines will increasingly fulf ll their

Practical and clinical development feasibilities come frst, followed by preclinical and phar￾maceutical aspects of nanomedicine research and development. This way of route planning 
allows one to identify—right from the start—where and which specifc issues can be encoun￾tered along the way.

Future Prospects of Nanotherapeutics 187 
promises to patients over the next two decades, according to van der Meel, who 
wrote “Cancer Nanomedicine: Oversold or Underappreciated?” (Van Der Meel, 
Lammers and Hennink, 2017). Sarmento has raised the question, “Has medication 
research and development using nanomedicines advanced as much as we’d hoped?” 
and responds, “Nanomedicines have not yet had a signifcant impact on clinical prac￾tice” (Sarmento, 2019). 
The term “advanced impact” is signifcant because nanotherapeutics has had an 
effect, even if it may not have yet delivered the “silver bullet” that Richard Feynman 
(who was a Nobel Laureate in Physics in 1965) anticipated in his well-known 1959 
American Physical Society speech, “There is plenty of room at the bottom.” The 
results seem uneven, particularly when it comes to cancer. The majority of licensed 
nanotherapeutics do not exist for combating cancer, despite the enormous number 
of papers in journals and studies that receive funding in the feld that are related to 
nanomedicine (McGoron, 2020). 
The investigation of human clinical studies intended to assess nanotherapeutic 
formulations provides another glimpse at the intriguing possibilities of the feld. In a 
recent investigation, Shi et al. (2022) searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database with 
the help of keywords. For the purpose of this evaluation, the research type “inves￾tigational (clinical trials)” was used to flter the search. Using the initial keyword 
search, the user can locate criteria connected to the outcomes of the search by 
analyzing the “topics” of the f ndings and identifying those that appear frequently 
to further narrow down the search. According to the results, the “Search Details” 
page shows how many times specifc keywords and synonyms have been searched. 
The data was processed using additional keywords alongside the base keywords. 
Although liposomes and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) are the subjects of the largest 
number of clinical trials investigating nanotherapeutics, many other nanoparticle 
medication formulations have recently come under study. Many of the studies are 
focused on, and the majority of them are for, oncology indications. The majority are 
in phase I or phase II. Considering liposome technological advances and nab-pacli￾taxel are widely established, leaving them out offers insight into additional novel 
nanotherapeutic uses ( Zhang et al., 2020). 
Prior to starting clinical investigations, researchers must submit an investigational 
new drug (IND) application to the FDA taking into account the clinical trials. A study 
by D’Mello et al. was done on FDA-internal data from 1974 to 2015. It demonstrates 
that between 1994 and 2015, submissions to the Centre for Drug Evaluation and 
Research (CDER) regarding nanomaterial substances fuctuated between 10 and 25 
per year, growing sporadically throughout the 1980s and peaking in 2006 (D’Mello 
et al., 2017). Throughout the same time period, the number of new products utilizing 
nanomaterials that were approved annually ranged from 1 to 7. Liposomes comprised 
the vast majority of the nanomaterials employed in pharmaceuticals between 2010 
and 2015, the bulk of cancer-related indications (40%), and the bulk of intravenous 
delivery techniques (63%) (D’Mello et al., 2017). The fndings of the researchers state 
that more medication products with nanomaterials are anticipated to be submitted in 
the near future. The form and complexity of nanotherapeutic formulations are also 
expected to rise, according to the scientists. It is obvious that the revolutionary nano￾therapeutic formulations are still in the early stages of evaluation, and it is anticipated  
 
 
 
188 Principles and Applications of Nanotherapeutics 
that very few of them will progress to phase III clinical trials and access market￾places. This, however, is not unique to nanotherapeutics because it is a widespread 
issue in the development of drugs in general. However, the evidence suggests that 
there is still interest in using nanotechnology in medicine, and in particular, in devel￾oping medications based on nanotherapeutics (McGoron, 2020). 
15.3 CONCLUSIONS 
Nanotechnology offers extraordinary advantages when used in medicines, medical 
devices, and innovative drug discovery. Additionally, the patent cliff and expirations 
have made it possible for pharmaceutical corporations to implement fresh venture 
plans. Although many popular medications are losing their patent protection, the 
development of nanotherapeutics has completely changed the pharmaceutical sector. 
The total number of patent applications has risen considerably as nanopharmaceuti￾cal enterprises have developed. Pharmaceutical corporations have created innovative 
approaches and strategies to modify medications that are close to losing their patent 
protection using nanotechnology. The potential for revenue growth for nanothera￾peutics is very promising. The information provided above offers a thorough analysis 
of the market for nanotherapeutic medicines, taking into account a variety of inf u￾encing factors such as current trends, regulatory laws, and technological advance￾ments in the sector (Foulkes et al., 2020). 
The “drug transport type,” “uses,” “distribution channel,” and “specifc areas” are 
the market segments that nanotherapeutics have been established. The facts that have 
been discussed before provide a way to gain thorough understanding of the mar￾ket and aid in the development of strategic judgments that are well-informed. Some 
important factors that need to be considered before combining the industries are 
revealed by the current investigation. In 2017, the market for nanotherapeutic drugs 
was estimated at $40.37 billion, and by 2026, it is anticipated to grow to $79.29 
billion (Global Nanopharmaceutical Drugs Market: Focus on nanodrugs and its 
application in therapeutics, competitive landscape, and country—analysis and 
forecast (2018–2026)). Government and corporate funding to promote the advance￾ment of regenerative medicines, an upsurge in the frequency of chronic illnesses and 
genetic abnormalities, an expansion in the cost of healthcare globally, and the grow￾ing aging of people worldwide are the main factors propelling the expansion of this 
industry. The market for nanotherapeutic pharmaceuticals is also being driven by 
the expanding coverage of insurance and compensation laws in developed markets, 
including the United States, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. 
Additionally, the anticancer therapeutic feld dominated the worldwide nanother￾apeutic marketplace in 2017 among the other therapeutic felds. The use of nanopar￾ticles presents a chance to change cancer research in general. Numerous medication 
candidates are undergoing clinical testing and could soon enter the market. The most 
promising nanotherapeutics should adhere to the regulatory approval process, have 
an adaptable structure that is simple to scale up for cGMP production, and be able to 
keep for a long time before being administered to individuals. The FDA as well as 
the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory collaborate to develop and evalu￾ate the nanotherapeutics platform (Bansal et al., 2020).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Future Prospects of Nanotherapeutics 189 
The worldwide nanotherapeutics marketplace is divided into four geographical 
segments based on geography: North America, Asia-Pacifc, Europe, and Rest of 
the World (RoW). The market for nanotherapeutic medicines is the largest in the 
world, with North America accounting for 51.78% of the sales in the market in 2017. 
However, during the time frame expected, revenue in Europe and Asia-Pacif c is 
anticipated to expand at a considerable CAGR of 5% and 7%, respectively (Global 
Nanopharmaceutical Drugs Market: Focus on nanodrugs and its application in 
therapeutics, competitive landscape, and country—analysis and forecast (2018– 
2026)). Although there are many prospects, nanotherapeutics confront more dif￾fculties than conventional medicines. Although traditional medications continue 
to rule the market, they are increasingly using nanotechnologies to lessen adverse 
effects and boost effectiveness. An essential route for modernizing conventional 
medications is represented by nanotherapeutics. The investment has grown expo￾nentially on its own, and the majority of its consequences are likely not yet fully 
felt. However, entrepreneurs must take the initiative to shepherd the discoveries 
to clinical settings if nanotherapeutics are expected to make an actual impression 
(Thapa and Kim, 2023).
