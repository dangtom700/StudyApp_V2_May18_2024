Precast Prestressed Concrete 
for Building Structures
This guide to precast prestressed concrete (PSC) introduces and applies principles for the 
design of PSC slabs, thermal slabs, beam and block flooring and main beams, including 
(where appropriate) cantilevers, and composite and continuous construction.
This book provides numerous worked examples for a wide range of PSC elements and 
covers the innovative use of PSC on several projects in the UK over the past 10 years, draw￾ing on the authorsʼ first-hand experience in the design and manufacture of special products. 
The contents are in line with the latest revisions of the Eurocodes and European Product 
Standards.
Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures is ideal for consulting structural 
engineers, clients, PSC manufacturers, and advanced undergraduate and graduate students, 
both as a guide and a textbook.

Since the publication of my last book Precast Concrete Structures in 2018 we have lost 
two people who helped to influence and shape my career in the analysis and design 
of precast/prestressed concrete structures. Mr Arnold van Acker was Chairman 
of FIP Commission on Prefabrication when he asked me to join the Commission 
in 1992. He was Technical Director at Partek & Partek Ergon in Belgium and 
received the Gold Medal for his contributions to FIP/FIB. He taught me to see the 
prefabrication of concrete structures in a holistic way, as a concept and entity, which 
should not be treated any differently from other forms of concrete construction. 
Dr Howard Taylor was Technical Director at Dowmac (later Costain-Dowmac 
and Tarmac Precast). During his term as President of The Institution of Structural 
Engineers he presented me with the Institution’s Henry Adams Award for the 
best pair of research papers published in The Structural Engineer in 1992, on the 
subject of horizontal diaphragm action in precast concrete floor units without a 
structural topping. Having spent many years fending off consulting engineers who 
insisted on adding a structural topping, he summarised my papers and said, “You 
see, that’s all there is to it”. I dedicate this book to the memory of these truly 
exceptional gentlemen.vii

Foreword by Seamus McKeague
I congratulate the co-authors of this book, Kim S Elliott (KSE) and Mark Magill (MM) for 
their dedication in capturing the essence of precast prestressed concrete and presenting it in 
a comprehensive and accessible manner. I first came to know KSE 30 years ago when he was 
Lecturer of Civil Engineering at The University of Nottingham. We met at a British Precast 
event when he was explaining and promoting the use of precast concrete for high-rise build￾ings. We at Creagh Concrete Ltd. (Creagh) were in the early stage of creating and growing 
our business to become a specialist precast manufacturer of prestressed hollow core floors 
and structural precast elements. We engaged KSE to become an advisor and mentor to our 
young team of engineer and designers. MM was a young enthusiastic (Creagh) engineer, and 
he benefited from the help and knowledge provided by KSE who is a highly respected inter￾national precast concrete expert with great practical experience and an inspiring academic 
career. It is very pleasing that by their friendship and partnership developed over the years, 
and they are now combining their efforts in compiling this knowledge, which will undoubt￾edly inspire and educate readers, spurring further innovation and pushing the boundaries 
of what can be achieved.
This book is a comprehensive exploration of precast and prestressed concrete. It is a testa￾ment to its transformative power and immense value in the realms of construction. It delves 
deep into its innovative applications and advanced techniques that have elevated it to the 
forefront of the construction industry.
One of the key strengths of precast and prestressed concrete lies in its ability to embrace 
both tradition and innovation. With each passing year, new advancements in materials, 
design techniques and production processes pushed the boundaries of what is possible. This 
book serves as a guide to these cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, highlighting 
the incredible strides made in the field and demonstrating how they have revolutionised 
the concrete industry. It showcases the myriad of benefits utilising precast concrete such as 
enhanced quality control, reduced construction time, cost-effectiveness and sustainability; 
advantages that sets it apart from conventional construction methods.
Within these pages, you will find a wealth of knowledge, insights and practical guidance 
from experts who have dedicated their lives to the advancement and application of precast 
and prestressed concrete. Their experience and passion are evident in the depth of informa￾tion shared, making this book an invaluable resource for engineers, architects, students and 
anyone fascinated by the transformative potential of precast.
Finally, I invite you, the reader, to immerse yourself in the world of precast and pre￾stressed concrete. A world where vision becomes reality, where tradition meets innovation xviii Foreword by Seamus McKeague
and where the future of construction is shaped. May this book serve as a guiding light, 
empowering you to contribute to the creation of a built environment that is both awe￾inspiring and sustainable.

Preface
When Kim Elliott used to lecture to students and run workshops to professional structural 
engineers on the ‘Design of precast concrete structures’ he’d break the sessions with a num￾ber of 15 minute videos, short case studies mainly. At the beginning of one such case study 
filmed in 1990 by Costain-Dowmac of ‘The Shires’ retail development in Leicester, UK, 
narrator Hugh Laurie quips with alacrity “I know what you’re thinking, precast concrete, 
ha!, it’s only good for railway sleepers and bridge beams ...”. The same is true of prestressed 
concrete, where many structural engineers have expressed surprise that the beams used in 
beam and block flooring for example are prestressed, and why prestressed hollow core floor 
units do not have transverse reinforcement or shear links. In fact the majority of text books 
on prestressed concrete focus on the generic design of prestressed elements, without any 
particular use in mind, or bridge-beam type beams. This is probably because the authors do 
not come from a precast/prefabrication background, preferring to leave the design of typical 
prestressed concrete elements found in multi-storey buildings to in-house design teams, at 
the producer’s control.
This book aims to redress this imbalance towards the use of prestressed concrete in build￾ings such as offices, retail/shopping, houses/apartments, hotels, and parking garages. Its 
main objective is to fill the gap where prestressed concrete is considered from not only the 
actual design, i.e. calculating bending and shear capacities, but also from the manufac￾turer’s production angle, quality control, testing and on-site erection methods, all of which 
play a major role in the final products. At the end of said video the narrator concludes “Well 
who said that precast concrete was only good for bridge beams and railway sleepers. It just 
goes to show that the right blend of design, manufacture and erection skills can achieve 
some outstanding results!” The authors of this book hope that the reader will agree, and 
think along the same lines.
However, most structural design engineers and civil engineering contractors still think 
of prestressed concrete as ‘just another technique of squeezing more out of the concrete’, 
which of course it is; refer to Freyssinet, or more importantly for long-line prestressing refer 
to Hoyer[1]. Unlike reinforced concrete, where the concrete is in compression in simply sup￾ported spans only in the top of the beam (and close to the bearing supports), prestressed 
concrete is in compression almost everywhere, see Figure 1, as well as making considerable 
contributions to the shear capacity and reducing deflections by preventing the beam from 
loosing stiffness by cracking. Prestress is to concrete what lead crystal is to a wine glass.
Highly tuned and working efficiently in this way, some designers do not realize that there 
are a number of prestressed concrete elements that do not comply with the basic rules afforded 
to reinforced concrete. It was surprising to learn that during an expert investigation involving 
prestressed hollow core floor units (hcu), Figure 2*, the consultant could not understand why 
hcu did not have (i) shear stirrups for the ultimate limit state, (ii) links surrounding the main xx Preface
Figure 1 Compressive stress contours in one-half of a simply supported prestressed concrete (top) and 
reinforced concrete beam subjected to uniform loading.
Figure 2 Prestressed concrete hollow core floor unit (*not the unit under investigation).Preface xxi
tendons, (iii) transverse bars (across the width of the hcu), (iv) transverse ties between indi￾vidual units, (vi) a proper bend or hook where the tendons were cut and exposed at the ends 
of the hcu, and (v) the hcu’s were able to distribute point or line loads transversely between 
units. Hollow core slabs and wall panels, as we know them today, were born c.1950 in the 
factory, not in the design office. Recently the floor area of prestressed hcu supplied in Europe 
passed one billion sq.m. (equivalent to 125,000 football pitches)!
But being ‘just another technique of squeezing more out of the concrete’ explains why 
prestressed concrete is not taught widely at undergraduate level, certainly in the UK. You 
can hear course directors: “It’s too specialized, in any case in-house production designers 
do that”. This is not the case in Scandinavia or the Benelux, or many Schools in North 
America, where prestressed concrete is not thought of as just another technique. The result 
of this is evident in Figure 3 from The Netherlands.
The global trend for de-carbonisation has reignited interest in the benefits of prestressed 
concrete elements. In particular, prestressed hollow core slabs are being specified at early 
design stage due to the minimisation of the use of materials within the product itself and 
the overall reduction in loading applied to the superstructure and substructure. Prestressed 
design can offer a competitive advantage due to production efficiency and reduced costs 
but specifiers and customers are now looking to source products and use forms of con￾struction that also provide a sustainable solution. Offsite manufacturing can contribute to 
social sustainability by ensuring for example that prestressed factories are safe, controlled 
environments to work in. Precast concrete manufacturing uses cement, which receives con￾siderable attention regarding the amount of energy consumed to produce it. To address this, 
manufacturers are looking at cement replacement products and carbon capture technology 
to strengthen their credentials in the environmental aspect of sustainability. The building 
shown in Figure 4 makes use of the benefits of prestressed hcu to provide a sustainable 
design solution in the fully precast structure.

This book aims to fill many of these shortcomings. It is based on the Eurocodes (EC2 
mainly but with passing references to EC0 and EC1 for basic principles and loads/fac￾tors) and where relevant the EC Product Standards, e.g. pull-in of tendons and splitting 
stresses in hcu in EN 1168, sequences for deflections in beam and block flooring. Finding 
the relevant clauses in Eurocode EC2 is a tedious exercise; e.g. (i) the service loading and 
permissible service stress in prestressed concrete in tension for internal exposure XC1 
(so clearly given in the former British code BS 8110) requires clauses 7.3.2.(4), 7.3.2(2) 
and Table 3.1, and (ii) 26 clauses and/or equations are needed in Chapters 3, 5 and 10 
and Appendix B to determine losses of prestress. This book pieces everything together, 
both strategically throughout the chapters and logically in the text and via the design 
examples.
The author’s are aware that the structural Eurocodes are being revised. Kim Elliott 
was commissioned by British Precast to identify all clauses in pr EN 1992-1-1:2018 ver￾sion D3 relating to precast and prestressed concrete, preparing model calculations and 
worked examples for key elements, and so is familiar with many of the proposed changes. 
However, it is unlikely that the revised code will be made available to BSI before 2024, 
in preparation for the UK National Annex, and that coexistence of the present and new 
codes may last until 2028. For this reason it was decided to continue with the present code 
BS EN 1992:2004+A1:2014.
This book has been made possible because the authors have had different back￾grounds in their professional careers – Kim Elliott, formerly of Trent Concrete Ltd. and 
Nottingham University, is known throughout the world for his text books and work￾shops and contributions to bulletins attributed to FIB Commission 6 on Prefabrication, 
and Mark Magill, in the front line of the design of millions of pounds worth of precast 
and prestressed concrete buildings at Creagh Concrete Ltd. This is Elliott’s sixth book, 
e.g.[2,3], in which the work draws on R&D, analysis and the loop that binds the manu￾facture-design-construction of precast elements in building frames. Magill leads a design 
team responsible for the design of precast and prestressed elements and entire structures 
for the residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors. This includes build￾ings such as the 18 storey fully precast concrete student accommodation scheme shown 
in Figure 5.Preface xxiii

Commercial use of precast and

1.1 COMMON PRECAST PRODUCT TYPES
1.1.1 Benefits of precast concrete construction
All of the typical structural components that make up a building, such as piles, pile caps, 
ground beams, walls, lift shafts, slabs, stairs, balconies, columns and beams, can be manu￾factured as precast concrete units. This range of products allows for the entire structure of 
a building to be constructed using precast units, and the architectural intent for the façade 
can be accommodated using precast cladding and sandwich panels. Figure 1.1 shows a clas￾sical precast skeletal frame for use in a multi-storey car park. Figure 1.2 shows the extraor￾dinary potential for architectural precast concrete.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003319450-1
Figure 1.1 Car park constructed with a precast concrete beam and column frame and long-span prestressed 
hollow core slabs, Blackpool, UK.2 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
One of the major benefits of constructing a fully precast building, both structurally and 
architecturally, is that there are minimal interfaces between other forms of construction to 
be designed and coordinated.
A fully precast superstructure rising off an insitu concrete substructure is a very com￾mon method of construction, detailed coordination between the design teams and the sub￾contractors occurs at the level where the insitu and precast meet. Once the first level of 
precast is installed, the precast-to-precast construction sequence is simplified and designed 
to be repetitive, which yields fast build times and rapid progress on site. The building can be 
made weathertight as it is erected, with windows fitted offsite into the precast cladding and/
or sandwich panels prior to delivery.
Precast balcony units can be installed with the balustrade fixed in position, as shown in 
Figure 1.3. The balustrade contractor carries out this work at a set-down area on site rather 
than in the precast yard due to the practical limitations of transporting balconies with bal￾ustrades already fixed onto them. Prefixing of the balustrade to the balcony units at ground 
level on site prior to erection improves health and safety by reducing the exposure to work 
at height for the sub-contractor and generally speeds up the overall process as well.
A common feature in fully precast structures is the use of bathroom pods; their delivery 
is scheduled in line with the precast delivery and erection programme. The pods are lifted 
into their approximate position at each level prior to installing the next level of precast 
flooring. Final positioning and leveling are carried out by the sub-contractor responsible 
for this package of works. The position of the pods is added to the precast sub-contractors’ 
temporary works drawings so they can be avoided when setting out the push-pull propping 
used for the precast walls.
Figure 1.2 Precast single skin cladding with brick slip finish fixed to steel framed carpark with precast stabil￾ity cores, Manchester, UK.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 3
For multi-storey buildings, the waterproofing of the floors in the form of tanking can be 
carried out by the main contractor at selected levels. This waterproofing strategy allows 
follow-on fit-out trades to commence very early in the overall build programme, usually 
working a minimum of three levels below the precast erection team.
The benefits of a fully precast building include
• improved Health & Safety on site
• excellent fire resistance
• extremely durable with a long design life
• excellent acoustic performance due to the density of the floors and walls
• greater security
• robust structure
• inherent thermal mass
• reduced heating and maintenance costs
• reduced site coordination as many trades are no longer required
• reduced preliminary costs due to reduced programme times
1.1.2 Precast columns and beams
Precast columns and beams are classified as ‘linear structural elements’ according to the 
product standard BS EN 13225 (BS EN 13225, 2013). They are used to form the struc￾tural frame for many types of building – worldwide they are most commonly used in 
car parks, industrial buildings, educational buildings, offices and retail developments. 
Columns and beams work well in conjunction with other precast concrete products such 
as prestressed hollow core units (hcu) and wall panels. This gives an option to use a fully 
precast solution for the building. Table 1.1 presents a sample of some recent precast frame 
projects in the UK.
Precast transfer structures can also be formed using a column and beam arrangement. 
These are typically required when apartment or hotel structures are built over car parks or 
open plan office/commercial spaces. The term ‘transfer’ literally means to transfer from one 
structural layout to another.
Figure 1.3 Precast balcony with balustrade pre-installed.4 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Concrete strength of C50/60, i.e. characteristic compressive cylinder strength fck =50 
N/mm2 and cube strength fck,cube=60 N/mm2 according to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.1 (BS EN 
1992-1-1, 2004) is readily available when manufacturing precast columns and beams. This 
gives the designer the potential to reduce column and beam section sizes and reinforcement 
quantities when compared with insitu concrete structures. Improved control of cover in the 
factory environment allows the available effective depth in section sizes to be maximised 
in design and also helps to ensure that the requirements for durability are met. A very 
important feature of precast concrete frames is the inherent fire resistance and long design 
life – these characteristics are particularly useful in car parks: for example, the precast col￾umns, beams, floors, walls and stairs used to build a fully precast car park can all be readily 
designed to achieve a design life in excess of 50years in an XC3/4 exposure class (see Table 
5.4), and they can also be designed to provide 120 minutes fire resistance (see Table 5.11) 
with no additional protection works necessary.
Multi-storey precast columns can be cast to improve the speed of erection on site, two 
or three storeys are the most common sizes but a greater number of storeys could be cast if 
this was beneficial to the project. Alternatively, single-storey columns are used, often with 
multispan precast beams. Columns with cast-in steel base plates give a detail that is prac￾tical on site and allows for quick erection without the need for temporary propping. The 
base plates are connected to the foundations using holding down bolts, the column can be 
plumbed and aligned by adjusting the holding down bolts. Columns can be cast with corbels 
or proprietary hidden connections to support incoming beams; these support methods work 
equally well with precast beams and steel beams. These details are extensively dealt with by 
the FIB (FIB, 2008, 2014), Elliott & Jolly (Elliott and Jolly, 2013) and Elliott (Elliott, 2017).
Precast columns also work very well in hybrid construction schemes, with the precast 
columns often being used in conjunction with an insitu concrete reinforced flat slab or an 
insitu post-tensioned slab.
Precast beams are usually cast in the form of an inverted T or an L profile, the downstand 
that is formed in these profiles supports the floor slabs or other secondary beams. If the 
downstand on precast beams causes an issue with head height or complicates the routing of 
M&E, one alternative detail that can be used to remove a downstand completely, or at least 
reduce its depth, is the addition of RSA’s bolted to the sides of rectangular profiled beams. 
This detail usually requires the beam to be made wider, and deflection limits tend to govern 
the feasibility of its use.

A very well-proven and practical solution for car park structures that gives fast coverage 
of large floor areas is the use of long-span hcu with a structural topping. Typically 15–16m 
slab spans onto an 8m grid of precast columns and beams. This is a very efficient structure 
and provides large open spaces for the car park layout. A useful feature on precast car parks 
is that the beams around the perimeter can be designed and cast with an upstand wall on 
them to act as the barrier for accidental impact loads. The precast stair core walls can also be 
designed for accidental impact loading. This additional function of the precast elements can 
be utilised to remove the need for steel or other types of vehicle impact barriers on the project.
1.1.3 Crosswalls
Crosswall construction is a term used to describe a form of construction where the load￾bearing walls of the structure are arranged perpendicular to the building axes, the crosswalls 
transfer the gravity and lateral loads to foundation or transfer slab level. Their design is accord￾ing to the product standard BS EN 14992 (BS EN 14992, 2007). All of the internal partitions 
can be used as crosswalls; they are designed to support the gravity loads from the floors and 
roof and act as shear walls to provide horizontal stability against wind and EHF loads. EHFs 
are ‘notional lateral loads’ applied to the structure to account for global imperfections such 
as lack of verticality or plumbness. They must be applied in all Eurocode load combinations. 
Figure 1.4 is an illustration of a crosswall frame comprising crosswalls and prestressed solid or 
hcu flooring. Crosswall construction can be used with precast external cladding and precast 
sandwich panels or lightweight cladding alternatives to provide a variety of elevation styles 
and finishes. Table 1.2 presents a sample of some recent precast crosswall projects in the UK.
When used with precast sandwich panels, the structural load-bearing leaf of the sandwich 
panels can also be included as shear walls in the lateral stability system. Further efficiency in 
design can be achieved when using precast crosswall and sandwich panels with the utilisa￾tion of vertical shear connection between walls. Connecting perpendicular walls, for exam￾ple where crosswalls and sandwich panels meet on the façade line, will create a T-shaped 
structural element. These T-shaped elements, in combination with C-shaped or box-shaped 
lift shafts and stair cores, can be modelled using analysis software to create a very efficient, 
economical and robust structure. The vertical shear transfer through the joints between 
each of the individual elements that form these composite shapes must be checked and veri￾fied to ensure the structure behaves as modelled.
Figure 1.4 Fully precast structure comprising crosswalls, prestressed hcu and sandwich panels.6 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Crosswall is an inherently stable, efficient and economical form of construction. Utilising 
most, if not all, of the load-bearing walls available within the stability system maximises 
the potential to distribute lateral loads from wind and EHF. This avoids, as much as pos￾sible, highly concentrated loading being applied to particular walls within the structure. 
Distributing the loading in this way assists in minimising wall thickness required and can 
also make for a more efficient and economical transfer slab or foundation design. Precast 
prestressed solid or hcu floor slabs can be used to provide a rigid diaphragm without the 
need for a structural topping. Peripheral and internal ties are contained within the depth of 
the hcu slab; the ties are designed and detailed to ensure the transfer of all lateral loads at 
each level into the shear wall stability system.
Using the total frame solution construction speed is greater than alternative systems. 
Units are manufactured off site with a high standard of finish, walls are mist coated and 
delivered to site suitable for direct application of paint. M&E services can be incorporated 
into the production process; back boxes, conduits, ducting, builders’ works openings, etc.
Crosswall frames are the ideal solution for the residential market, student accommoda￾tion and hotels as well as commercial offices, schools and prisons. This form of construction 
has been used worldwide for the design of fully precast buildings up to 30 storeys.
A common arrangement for apartment buildings is to use internal load-bearing crosswalls 
at a maximum spacing of 10m. This allows 250mm deep prestressed hcu to support the typ￾ical loading specified and span between supporting walls. The minimised number of inter￾nal load-bearing walls required provides increased set-out flexibility for apartments and 
the room layouts within apartments. Using solid or ordinary reinforced slabs will require 
greater slab depths than 250mm to achieve a 10m span; alternatively, there will need to be 
an increased number of internal walls provided to reduce the span to a dimension that can 
be accommodated by the 250mm depth slab.
Crosswalls can be readily manufactured using C50/60 concrete to minimise reinforce￾ment and/or wall thickness. This gives a benefit when used on multistorey projects, as the 
additional cement cost can be offset by the savings in reinforcement. However, it should be 
noted that wall thickness is also influenced by the fire resistance and acoustic performance 
required, it is often the case that the load-bearing capacity is only critical at the bottom

levels of medium to high rise multistorey buildings. In fact, in low-rise structures where 
reinforcement content in walls is often at a minimum and load-bearing capacity is not criti￾cal the use of higher strength concrete is not economical or a benefit.
Precast crosswalls provide an excellent barrier to sound transmission, see example Rw
calculation below for a t=200mm thickness element
Average density (conservative); ρcon =2350kg/m3;
Mass of wall; w=ρcon t=470 kg/m2
Weighted sound reduction index; Rw =37.5 log(w/1 kg/m2)−42=58.2dB.
Table 5.4 of BS EN 1992-1-2 (BS EN 1992-1-2, 2004) sets out the thickness and axis distance 
required to satisfy the fire resistance for load-bearing walls exposed on one side and exposed 
on two sides. Care needs to be taken when determining the exposure each crosswall needs to 
be designed for. For example, the fire strategy for an apartment building states a requirement of 
REI 120 for load-bearing walls. A crosswall containing a door opening forms the dividing wall 
between an apartment and the corridor. If the apartment door does not provide 120 minutes of 
fire resistance, then this crosswall may be exposed to fire on two sides during a fire, i.e. the fire 
inside the apartment breaks through the door and into the corridor, exposing the wall to fire 
on both sides simultaneously. The utilisation factor of crosswalls can be checked to see if the 
wall thickness and cover provided satisfy the fire resistance requirements. Interpolation can be 
applied to the tabulated data in Table 5.4 of BS EN 1992-1-2. If tabulated data does not provide 
adequate fire resistance for the proposed wall details, further detailed design can be carried out 
in accordance with the simplified or general calculation methods given in BS EN 1992-1-2 to 
determine if the wall details will satisfy the fire resistance specified in the fire strategy.
1.1.4 Precast stair cores and lift shafts
Precast stair cores and lift shafts are a useful form of construction that can be readily used in 
conjunction with all other forms of construction and as part of a fully precast structure. Their 
design is according to the product standard for walls BS EN 14992 (BS EN 14992, 2007). It is 
common to have precast cores and lift shafts where the main building structure is constructed 
using timber frame, steel frame, insitu concrete frame or masonry. The precast core and lift 
structures can be designed to provide stability to the main building structure or to be stand￾alone and self-supporting only. Figure 1.5 shows such a stability core with cast-in break-out 
bars for connection to the floor slab and cast-in steel plates for connection to the steel frame.
Precast cores and lift shafts are typically built at full height in one continuous visit. This 
helps to minimise costs as the precast contractor is on site for as short a period as possible, 
and it also provides immediate access and egress to the main building structure as each of 
the floor levels is constructed.
When the design intent is for the precast cores and/or lift shaft to provide stability to 
the main building structure, there are a number of typical connection details and ways 
to robustly tie the structures together. Steel frames are generally connected to the precast 
structure using cast-in plates within the precast walls. The cast-in plates are detailed and 
fabricated to allow a bolted connection to be made between the steel beam and the wall. 
Insitu concrete frames are generally connected using breakout reinforcement bars; these 
bars are cast into the precast walls in preformed cassettes. The cassettes are available from 
several manufacturers and can be purchased in standard forms or with bespoke reinforce￾ment arrangements to suit particular project details. The bars within the cassettes are bent 
out on site to tie into the reinforcement cages of the insitu concrete. Breakout bar connec￾tion details also work with metal deck flooring and all of the precast floor slab types when 
combined with an insitu structural topping.8 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
1.1.5 Precast concrete cladding
Precast concrete single skin cladding, with or without integral insulation, can be designed 
and manufactured as the façade finish for insitu structures, steel-framed structures and of 
course, precast structures. Cladding panels are designed according to BS 8297 (BS 8297, 
2017). Precast cladding can be manufactured with a very wide range of finishes, e.g. brick 
and/or stone, coloured concrete, etched, polished, patterned or a combination of different 
finishes, with examples as shown in Figures 1.2 and 1.6. The cladding can be designed to 
be stacked from foundation level or supported on the building structure at each level. The 
typical support arrangement for cladding supported at each level consists of steel brackets or 
corbels projecting from the cladding at its base; these supports carry the vertical loading and 
provide horizontal restraint, with additional fixings positioned at the head of the cladding 
to provide horizontal restraint only.
The window and door systems for the project can be installed and sealed in the cladding 
panels off-site at the precast yard. The completed assembly is then transported and craned 
into position on site. Typically, a double mastic seal is applied to the vertical and horizontal 
joints between precast units on site to provide a fully weathertight façade.
1.1.6 Precast concrete sandwich panels
A popular and extremely versatile element of precast construction is the use of the sandwich 
panel system. Their design is according to the product standard for walls BS EN 14992 
Figure 1.5 Stability core with cast-in break-out bars for connection to the floor slabs and cast-in steel plates 
for connection to the steel frame, Warrington, UK.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 9
(BS EN 14992, 2007). These panels consist of an inner load-bearing structural leaf, an insu￾lation layer and an outer non-load-bearing façade leaf. No external scaffolding is required. 
The sandwich panel is manufactured using a proprietary system that connects the outer leaf 
and insulation to the inner load-bearing leaf. These connections are usually manufactured 
from a fibre composite material or stainless steel. The sandwich panel façade leaf can also 
have the same finish as for cladding panels.
Windows and doors can be installed and sealed in the panels off-site at the precast yard. 
The completed assembly is then transported and craned into position on site. Figure 1.7. 
Typically, a double mastic seal is applied to the vertical and horizontal joints between pre￾cast units on site to provide a fully weathertight façade.
Balcony support assemblies, usually in the form of cast-in plates or stubs, can be cast into 
the panels during production to allow the connection of precast or metal balconies on site. 
The structural leaf of the panels can be designed to support the loading from the balcony 
units. Alternatively, the balcony connection can be taken into the floor slab although this 
generally requires additional site works and insitu concrete stitching. Depending on the 
details of the support and the connection method used, the precast balconies may need to 
be erected in sequence along with the panels. Typically metal balconies are fixed to project￾ing stubs at the outer face of the non-load-bearing façade leaf and can be erected in any 
sequence independent of the panels.
The structural connections between sandwich panels are formed using proprietary loop 
boxes in the vertical joints; the panels are connected to each other across the horizontal 
joint using vertical tie bars in grouted sleeves or bolted connections; and horizontal ties are 
provided between the panels and the precast hcu or solid floor slabs. All joints are filled with 
high-strength grout or structural mortar to provide a robust construction that will satisfy 
the requirements of fire compartmentation and acoustic performance.
Figure 1.6 Precast brick-faced cladding on a steel-framed office building, Coventry, UK.10 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
A very high standard of finish is achieved by power floating the internal face of the struc￾tural leaf. The internal face is given a light mist coating of paint to highlight any blemishes, 
and cosmetic finishing of the surface is carried out in the factory prior to being placed in the 
stockyard. The sandwich panels are delivered to the site suitable for the direct application 
of paint to the internal face.
The most common insulation used in precast sandwich panels for buildings greater than 
18m in height is Class A1 mineral wool. The cavity is fully filled as part of the production 
process. Sandwich panels can be readily designed to achieve the typical 120-minute fire 
resistance required (REI 120) for structures in the Building Regulations and Table 5.4 of BS 
EN 1992-1-2.
Generally, minimum wall thicknesses for sandwich panels are 150mm structural inner 
leaf and 80mm non-structural outer leaf. These values satisfy the minimum dimensional 
requirements shown in Diagram 9.2 of ADB Volume 2 (Building Regulations 2010) for the 
exclusion of a cavity barrier. Should a cavity barrier be a specific requirement, the mineral 
wool insulation used in the sandwich panel system complies with the requirements of 9.14(c) 
of ADB Volume 2 as the insulation is placed under compression due to the production pro￾cess, i.e. the concrete forming the structural leaf is poured onto and compresses the insula￾tion during production.
Provision for mechanical & electrical (M&E) services can be cast into sandwich panels 
in the form of back boxes, conduits and ducts, and builders’ work openings can also be 
formed in both leaves of the panel. Figure 1.8. It is also possible to provide a cast-in conduit 
and access detail specifically for the installation and connection of lightning protection 
tapes. It is very important to have early input at the design stage from the Architect and 
Figure 1.7 Sandwich panel loaded on to a trailer in a precast yard ready for delivery to site with windows 
and aluminium cladding installed.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 11
M&E Consultant to allow coordination of the position of any M&E with reinforcement 
details and other cast-in items such as lifting anchors, grout sleeves, propping sockets, etc. 
A common problem that occurs is clashing between the vertical conduits and the horizontal 
reinforcement. This can be resolved by using back box extension pieces or conduit elbows 
to move the position of the vertical conduit further into the panel.
1.1.7 Precast retaining walls
The product standard BS EN 15258 (BS EN 15258, 2008) for precast retaining wall ele￾ments focuses mainly on vertical cantilever walls retaining soil and granular materials. 
There are numerous other methods of utilising precast walls to retain various solid and 
liquid materials. Design guidance that is applicable to generic retaining wall arrangements 
can also be found in the standards BS EN 13369 (BS EN 13369, 2018) ‘common rules’ and 
BS EN 14992 ‘wall elements’.
Precast vertical cantilever walls can be designed and manufactured to be prestressed and 
reinforced. A common construction method is the use of precast walls with an insitu con￾crete base. The precast wall is cast with holes at the required centres along its width for 
reinforcement bars to be fitted through on site. These bars are tied into the main reinforce￾ment cage for the base and provide a connection between the precast and insitu sections. 
The main design checks for this form of construction are overturning, sliding and ground￾bearing pressure. The base and the wall stem are both checked for bending and shear capac￾ity. The vertical joints between the individual units are formed with a tongue and groove 
Figure 1.8 Backboxes and conduit for electrical services within a wall panel.12 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
detail so that the wall panels interlock with each other when installed and concreted into 
the base. Once constructed, the face of the wall and base on the retaining side can be tanked 
to provide a watertight structure. Figure 1.9 shows an example of a prestressed wall for 
retaining soil.
Another use for vertical precast cantilever walls with an insitu base that is cost-effective 
and rapid on site is the construction of boundary walls. The height of the wall can be 
manufactured to suit the project requirements, and all of the finishes described in the sec￾tion above can be provided on the wall faces. The walls may have a retaining function, and 
this can be accounted for in the design, but generally the main loading is from wind. Prison 
walls and other tall security-sensitive boundary walls are particularly well suited to precast 
vertical cantilever construction. On these projects, the minimum wall height is generally 
5.2m, which is readily manufactured in modular sections. This size of wall panel can be 
transported and installed with standard haulage and site craneage.
Rather than cast an integral insitu concrete base with the wall panels, fully precast retain￾ing walls can be manufactured as an L shape. These L-wall units can be freestanding for 
low retained loads and are useful for temporary storage and as a moveable storage option, 
for higher loading the L-walls can be manufactured with pockets in the base leg of the L so 
that they can be bolted down to a foundation or slab. The L-walls can also be manufactured 
with projecting reinforcement from the base leg of the L, this reinforcement is normally tied 
into the main cage of an insitu slab that forms the floor of the storage structure. L-walls are 
available in various lengths and in heights up to 6m.
An alternative to the L-wall profile is the precast rocket wall. These are designed to be 
bolted down to an existing foundation or slab and have the benefit of being suitable for use 
as a dividing wall that can be loaded on either side.
Figure 1.9 Prestressed concrete vertical cantilever wall panels and insitu base constructed as a soil retaining 
wall.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 13
Horizontal spanning precast walls can be used to retain material when supported by pre￾cast, steel or insitu concrete frames. Storage of products as diverse as grain, wood pellets, 
vegetables, aggregates, and silage are just some examples of the use of this form of construc￾tion. Prestressed solid and hcu wall panels are particularly suited to support the high pres￾sures generated by retained materials in storage buildings. Figure 1.10 shows a large wood 
pellet store constructed with a steel frame and horizontally spanning prestressed solid wall 
panels. The walls spanned 6m, were 400mm thick and supported the pressure from 16m of 
heaped material. The wall panels are designed with a tongue and groove or shear key joint 
between adjacent panels; this joint is designed to transfer load laterally between panels. This 
capacity to transfer load allowed the most heavily loaded bottom panels to share load with 
the panels above and give a more economic design for the wall thicknesses and the amount 
of prestressing strand required. Another feature of the design for some storage buildings is 
impact loading. The use of very heavy-duty shovel machines in the storage facility requires 
the precast to be designed for relatively high impact loading, which generally removes the 
possibility of using prestressed hcu wall panels at the levels where impact could occur.
1.2 HORIZONTAL ELEMENTS – SLABS, TERRACES AND STAIRS
1.2.1 Solid and hollow core units for floor and roof slabs
Hollow core units (hcu) are now one of the primary solutions selected by engineers, con￾tractors and increasingly by developers themselves to meet the demands of fast-track site 
programmes.
Figure 1.10 400mm thick prestressed solid retaining walls, spanning 6m, this thickness was required at the 
base of a 16m high storage facility for wood pellets.14 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The units can be reinforced or prestressed, solid or hcu; but by far the most common slab 
type is prestressed hcu, due to efficiencies in the manufacturing process as well as load/span 
performance as shown in Sections 2.2.3–2.2.6. The product standard BS EN 1168 (BS EN 
1168, 2005) also applies to solid slabs that are manufactured using the same methods as hcu 
slabs. The structural efficiency of hcu precast slabs facilitates a very cost-effective floor that 
is suitable for use in all types of buildings. The design flexibility and load-carrying capacity 
provided by the range of slab depths available see this precast element being used as a versa￾tile flooring solution in residential, commercial and industrial projects.
Hcu slabs are manufactured within a factory environment to a very strict quality process, 
which gives the control required over prestressing and concrete mix. Figure 1.11 shows a 
typical production plant containing 13 no. steel beds up to 227m long. The longest bed 
extends beyond the internal envelope of the factory by 80m, the typical internal beds are 
120–150m long.
The steel bed gives a smooth-formed finish to the soffit that can be left exposed in car 
parks, for example. The soffit of the hcu slab is also suitable to receive a painted finish. 
Typical 28days concrete strength is fck =40 to 50 N/mm2 and cube strength fck,cube=50–60 
N/mm2. The strength of the concrete at detensioning at about 20hours is fck(t)=25–30 
N/mm2, obtained by crushing cubes cured adjacent to the production beds.
Automated plotters can be used to mark up the slabs with cut lines, open cores, notches, 
holes, etc. These details are preformed in the factory prior to dispatch to site. Hcu can also 
be manufactured with integral heating and cooling pipes cast in; this requires the bottom 
flange of the section profile to be thickened so that it can accommodate the pipework.
Common prestressed solid slab depths range from 100 to 150mm, hcu slab depths typi￾cally range from 150 to 500mm in 50mm increments. Figure 1.12 shows three such units, 
pretensioned using helical strands shown in Figure  1.13. The most common standard 
Figure 1.11 Prestressed hollow core factory showing long line production beds.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 15
Figure 1.12 Prestressed precast hollow core floor units of nominally 1200mm width and 200, 300 and 
400mm depth produced by the Echo slipformer.
Figure 1.13 Close up of cross section of 12.5mm diameter seven-wire helical strand.16 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
slab width is 1200mm although some manufacturers produce slabs up to 2400mm wide. 
Narrow width units can be cut from full width units with some restrictions to the dimen￾sions of the widths available due to the hcu geometry.
Some adjustment of the machines used in the manufacturing process is possible; this 
allows bespoke depths to be manufactured. For example, a 260mm depth unit can be 
formed using a 250mm hcu profile by making an adjustment to the machine and increasing 
the depth of the top flange by 10mm. The majority of prestressed hcu are manufactured on 
long line beds of over 100m, this means that a full bed of each hcu depth needs to be cast, 
and this can have an influence on costs for bespoke units.
Using the values given in Table 5.8 of BS EN 1992-1-2 and noting the clause regarding 
axis distance in clause 5.2 (5), a fire resistance of REI 90 can be achieved for units 100mm 
thick or greater; it is possible for slabs of 150mm thick or greater to achieve REI 120 with 
no requirement to provide any additional fire protection to the unit. If the units do not 
satisfy the criteria given in Table 5.8 of BS EN 1992-1-2 a more in-depth approach can be 
undertaken, which involves the calculation of the moment and shear capacity in the fire situ￾ation and can result in an improved fire resistance period being demonstrated. See Section 
5.5 for further details.
Prestressed hcu can be designed and manufactured for very long spans. See Sections 
2.2.2–2.2.6. This gives excellent flexibility to create structures with large open spaces 
that can be divided up using lightweight partitions in numerous configurations. The 
prestressing of the concrete enhances deflection performance and the hcu section mini￾mises the self-weight of the slab. These are two very important factors in providing a slab 
solution that can be used in spans of 17 m and greater depending on the specific loading 
requirements of the project. Hcu can also be designed as composite slabs with the appli￾cation of an insitu concrete structural topping once installed on site. See Section 12.3. 
This can further enhance the load-carrying capacity and increase the spans that can be 
achieved.
The minimised self-weight of hcu (typically 60% of that of a solid slab) reduces the load￾ing that needs to be supported by beams, columns, walls, etc., and taken down to the 
substructure of the building. This reduction in overall loading can provide cost savings on 
the other structural elements and parts of the building. The efficient section profile of hcu 
reduces material usage and contributes to sustainability and reduction in the carbon foot￾print of the building.
Hcu can be used to provide diaphragm action and transfer horizontal forces into the sta￾bility system. The diaphragm can be designed using the tie reinforcement provided as part 
of the robustness details, and a structural topping is not required. The peripheral, internal 
and horizontal ties are all provided within the depth of the hcu, as shown in Figure 1.14. 
These ties are anchored with insitu concrete into open cores and pockets formed in the slabs 
during production. The quantity of tie reinforcement provided is checked to ensure that it 
satisfies the requirements of the diaphragm and robustness in accordance with BS EN 1992-
1-1, whichever forces are greater will govern the reinforcement details provided.
Precast hcu can be erected very quickly on site; this gives a significant reduction to site 
durations and the construction programme can be shortened. There are a number of com￾mon methods used to install these units; they can be fitted using lifting anchors that are cast 
into the slabs during the production process, fitted using clamps or fitted using chains as 
shown in Figure 1.15. Lifting anchor pins are most often used as they provide a very quick 
method to install slabs directly to their final position. The use of clamps requires manual 
adjustment of the slabs into their final positions, while the use of chains can cause aesthetic 
damage to the slab edges and soffit and also requires the manual adjustment of the slabs into 
their final positions.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 17
On the majority of projects, hcu do not require any temporary propping works on site; the 
exception to this is the occasional requirement for a composite slab to be touch propped at 
mid-span (or two props at ⅓ span) prior to pouring the structural topping. Propping is not 
common though, unless there is a limitation on the depth of the composite slab, as the need 
Figure 1.15 Lifting hollow core units on site with chains and cast-in lifting pins.
Figure 1.14 Horizontal and vertical tie details on a fully precast structure. (a) Peripheral and vertical ties. 
(b) Internal and vertical ties.18 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
for temporary propping is usually designed out by increasing the depth of the hcu, the uplift 
in cost for a thicker slab is usually much less than the cost of the props and the time lost 
installing and removing the temporary works. Once installed onto the supporting structure, 
the slabs immediately create a safe working platform, the tie steel required for the design 
is fixed, and the insitu concreting works to the longitudinal joints between units and at the 
ends are carried out. When the insitu concrete has gained adequate strength access to the 
floor can be given to follow on trades, normally a 72-hour period is programmed, but this 
can be reduced by using specific insitu concrete mixes and taking cubes to confirm the con￾crete strength has reached the value required. Design for temporary loading from MEWPS, 
scissor lifts, etc. can be carried out if this is a requirement of the construction process. The 
number of square metres fitted in a day will vary depending on the specific details of the 
project and any site constraints, but an average of 40 lifts per day for 8m long 200mm depth 
hcu would be typical. This rate of fitting gives an installation area of approximately 400m2
per day.
The apartment building shown in Figure 1.16 is a fully precast structure using 250mm 
deep hcu, supported on precast crosswalls and sandwich panels. The hcu spanned up to 10m 
which allows (i) the number of internal load-bearing walls to be minimised, (ii) flexibility in 
the apartment configuration and room layouts and (iii) rapid construction of each level.
1.2.2 Plate flooring
Prestressed and standard reinforced plate flooring consists of a thin precast section, typi￾cally 50–100mm thick, with longitudinal steel girder cast into it at regular spacing across 
Figure 1.16 Fully precast apartment buildings under construction utilising prestressed hollow core slabs, 
Glasgow, UK.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 19
the width of the unit. Their design is according to the product standard BS EN 13747 (BS 
EN 13747, 2005). The girders’ primary function is to deal with handling stresses in the thin 
precast section, the loading applied at installation and the following construction process. 
In virtually all projects, the girder is used when lifting the plate flooring, and chains are 
hooked on at designated points along the span. For long-span units, a lifting frame is used 
to ensure the slab is not cracked during handling. Figure 1.17 shows an example of a 12m 
span floor plate, with lifting girders.
Plate flooring receives an insitu topping on site; the permanent works design is based on 
the composite section and the main reinforcement cast within the precast section; top steel 
can be added over supports to create a continuous spanning slab. The temporary works 
design focuses mainly on the steel girder capacity; generally, the limiting factor for prop 
spacing is the buckling of the top bar in the girder. The temporary works design must con￾sider loading from the concrete, site fixed reinforcement, any other project-specific ‘dead’ 
loading and an agreed ‘live’ load allowance for construction traffic. Propping is typically 
provided at 2.5m centres for standard reinforced plate flooring but longer spans are achiev￾able depending on girder details and overall slab depth. Prestressed plate flooring typically 
spans up to 4m before propping needs to be introduced. It is essential that care is taken 
when pouring the insitu concrete topping, and the method adopted ensures that concrete 
is not heaped anywhere on the floor. On floors with large section depths, the use of poly￾styrene void formers within the instiu topping becomes practical, and this can significantly 
reduce the self-weight of the floor.
Figure 1.17 Installing a 12m span precast floor plate with a lifting frame, polystyrene void formers used to 
reduce the self-weight of the completed composite floor, heating and cooling pipes were cast 
into the precast elements.20 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Heating and cooling pipework can be cast into the plate flooring during the manufactur￾ing process. The pipework is pressure tested before and after casting to ensure no damage or 
leakage occurs. Pipework ’tails’ are left projecting from the precast so the M&E contractor 
can complete the pipework connections on site once the floors are installed. Backboxes and 
conduits for light fixings, smoke alarms, thermostats, etc. can also be cast into the precast 
units during manufacture.
Due to the cost of this floor type compared to other forms of construction, plate floor￾ing is typically used in buildings that require a very high-quality finish to the slab soffit. It 
tends to be specified for universities, public buildings such as libraries, and office develop￾ments where the design intent is to have the concrete surfaces exposed to view, as shown in 
Figure 1.18.
1.2.3 Precast ribbed floor slabs
Although they are sometimes thought of and referred to as beams in many countries, one 
of the most commonly used ribbed floor slab forms is prestressed double-tee (as shown in 
Figure 1.19) and triple-tee ‘beams’. See also Section 2.2.7. These slabs are an efficient way 
of building car park decks. Their design is according to the product standard BS EN 13747 
(BS EN 13224, 2011). Long-span units up to 16m are commonly used. The double-tee and 
triple-tee units are typically 2.4 and 3.6m wide, respectively; this allows for coverage of 
large floor areas in very short programme durations. One major advantage is that these 
floor units do not require a finish screed. Typical overall structural depth for prestressed 
composite ribbed floor units at 16m span would be 575mm for standard imposed car park 
loading in an XC3/4 exposure class environment. See Figure 2.22. It is worth noting that the 
Figure 1.18 Precast plate flooring manufactured with rebated soffit profiles.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 21
top level of a car park often has a layer of finishes for waterproofing and this additional dead 
load can require an increase in the overall structural depth of the floor unit. Double-tee and 
triple-tee units are most often used on steel and precast-framed car parks. The connection 
details between the floor slabs and frames of steel, precast or insitu concrete are virtually 
identical making for a simple build methodology that can be easily adapted to suit the form 
of construction used for the main structure.
A specific form of ribbed slabs, termed as minor floor elements in the product standard, is 
designed for use at ground floor and can be manufactured with integral insulation, as shown 
in Figure 1.20. The rib sections can be designed as reinforced or prestressed. This floor slab, 
when produced as a 375mm deep unit of concrete and EPS insulation, can achieve U-values 
as low as 0.11 W/m2K based on the exposed perimeter length (m) divided by the floor area 
(m2) of 0.4. Typical Psi values of 0.11 W/mK can be achieved at junctions between elements 
such as floors and walls. The Psi value is a measure of the heat loss at a thermal bridge. 
Note that U-values and Psi values are dependent on the details of the wall configuration and 
construction materials.
The exceptional overall thermal performance and speed of installation sets this type of 
flooring apart from traditional beam and block and insitu concrete ground floor slabs. This 
product is particularly suited to residential and commercial ground floors; site labour is 
radically reduced, service penetrations are preformed during manufacture, 80–100m2 of 
flooring can be installed in 90 minutes using a lorry-mounted crane (often called a Hiab, 
although this is actually a brand name), building of walls can commence 3hours after instal￾lation of the floor is completed. For reinforced concrete slabs, a 25mm self-levelling screed 
can be applied as a finish, but for prestressed slabs with upward camber a much deeper fin￾ish screed will normally be required.
Figure 1.19 Prestressed double-tee floor units.22 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The thickness of the top section of the slab spanning between the ribs is generally 50mm 
for 1200mm wide floor units. This top section of the slab can be designed and manufac￾tured with a light reinforcement mesh or macro synthetic fibres depending on the project 
specification. Load span tables are available from manufacturers. The use of a prestressed 
slab gives greater spans and load-carrying capacity, but the additional depth of finishes 
required to deal with camber needs to be considered.
1.2.4 Terracing – sports stadiums and entertainment venues
Precast terracing is an excellent solution for constructing sports stadiums and entertain￾ment venues such as arenas and cinemas. Figure 1.21. Sometimes known as ‘bleachers’, 
the terraces are typically manufactured as single L-shaped units spanning between bear￾ing points on a supporting structure. An alternative, but less common approach, that 
reduces the number of pieces and therefore installation time on site is to manufacture the 
units as multiple L-shaped units with two or three terraces cast as one unit. The support￾ing structure for the precast terrace units can be constructed in precast, insitu concrete, 
steel or in smaller projects masonry can be used. The terrace units are typically designed 
as two separate reinforced elements, a beam section and a horizontal slab section. The 
natural frequency of the units is checked to ensure the calculated value is in accordance 
with the requirements of the specification. This check relates to the vibration or perceived 
motion that can be felt by people sitting or standing on the terracing. Note that the mini￾mum natural frequency required will occasionally govern the design of the terrace units 
beam section size and reinforcement content. A typical arrangement of supporting struc￾ture will have terrace unit spans of 7.5 m; terrace beam depth of 475 mm × 150 mm thick, 
Figure 1.20 Ground floor insulated ribbed slab.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 23
slab section depth is usually a minimum of 100 mm (note for external stadiums the slab 
thickness varies as it is generally cast with a fall of 1:40), the slab span is normally in the 
region of 800 mm. The typical geometry described in the preceding sentence will provide 
a terrace unit with a minimum natural frequency in excess of 6 Hz for a typical loading 
arrangement.
The presence of step blocks also needs to be considered in the design; these step blocks 
will be supported by the terrace units and may be positioned anywhere along the span 
depending on the seating and access arrangement.
Allowance for thermal movement is particularly important in outdoor terracing; this can 
be accommodated by movement joints in the supporting structure at the necessary spacing 
and a sliding connection between the terrace unit and its support. Waterproofing of the 
joints between units is normally in the form of a mastic sealant with a secondary protection 
layer beyond this seal to the details provided in the project specification.
1.2.5 Precast concrete stairs
Precast stairs and landings are some of the most common precast products. Their popular￾ity is driven by the fact that on site insitu works are complicated and skill intensive. Precast 
stairs are used in all types of buildings and forms of construction; masonry, steel frames, 
insitu concrete and precast frames. Figure 1.22 shows a precast stair flight being lifted by 
the crane for installation into position on a steel-framed structure. Their design is accord￾ing to product standard BS EN 14843 (BS EN 14843, 2007). Straight stair flights are the 
most common shape, winders and curved flights are also possible, and many very impres￾sive bespoke stair flight shapes can be manufactured. Depending on the support options 
Figure 1.21 Precast concrete terrace units spanning up to 10.3m installed onto a steel frame.24 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
available and the design intent, separate landing slabs or stair flights cast with top and/or 
bottom landings are provided.
The stair core shown in Figure 1.23 and noted in Table 1.3 was manufactured as indi￾vidual precast walls, landings, stair flights and capping slabs. The walls that formed each 
box were bolted together in the precast yard with a landing or half landing also fixed within 
the box. Each assembled box was delivered to the site on wide loads and craned into posi￾tion, followed by the stair flights and finally the capping slabs. This allowed a very rapid 
build programme on site.
In some buildings where a staircase is designed to be an architectural feature, the pre￾cast stairs can be manufactured, for example, using coloured concrete, textured finishes, 
upstands and many other details.
Typical waist thicknesses are 150, 175 and 200mm. From a structural perspective the 
thickness of the waist is governed by the span, the loading, the fire performance and the 
durability requirements.
Risers can be cast square or at a raked angle, nosings can be cast into the stair or recesses 
can be formed during casting for post-fixed nosings. Sockets and proprietary systems can be 
cast into the stairs for connection of the balustrade. Commonly a 175mm waist is used to 
allow space between the main top and bottom reinforcement for side fixing of balustrades 
using concrete screws or other post fixings.
A proprietary temporary edge protection system can be clamped to the stairs and landings 
at ground level on site prior to installation. It is also possible to fix the permanent balustrade 
to the stair at ground level on site, this balustrade needs protection during construction but 
Figure 1.22 Stair flight being lifted for installation.Commercial use of precast and prestressed concrete in buildings 25
has the health and safety benefit of reducing work at height, and gives time and cost saving 
due to the removal of the need for temporary edge protection installation and removal.
A typical standard detail for supporting precast stairs is the use of cast-in sockets and 
rolled steel angle(s) (RSA) bolted onto the flights. The RSAs are detailed with a hole in 
the horizontal leg so that they can also be used to fix the stair to its support and satisfy 
the robustness requirements. Where separate precast landing slabs are used, there are two 
very common standard details for support in precast and insitu concrete structures. A RSA 
is bolted to the precast or insitu concrete wall and the landing slab bears onto it. Notches 
in the precast landing slab and shear studs welded to the RSA are designed to satisfy the 
robustness tie requirement.

An alternative to RSA supports is provided by proprietary hidden connections; these are 
cast within the precast landing slabs and a corresponding pocket is cast in the precast or 
insitu concrete wall. Robustness can be satisfied by the use of a connection pin between the 
cast-in unit and the supporting wall or an arrangement of the connections.

Why precast, why prestressed?
2.1 USE OF PRESTRESSED CONCRETE IN BUILDINGS
Precast prestressed concrete (psc) is used extensively in buildings and structural frames, 
particularly floor slabs on load-bearing masonry for housing and apartments, and in multi￾storey precast concrete, steelwork and timber frames for offices, retail, hotels, car parking, 
and other residential buildings. In about 50% of projects, psc floor units are designed and 
constructed compositely with a cast insitu reinforced concrete topping (known as a ‘struc￾tural topping’ to distinguish it from a non-structural ‘finishing screed’). The UK market for 
psc floors in 2022 is around £250 million, or 2,240,000 sq.m. area per year. At present, this 
represents about 40% of the UK’s suspended flooring market (excluding cast insitu ground 
floors). These floors are manufactured by around 12 companies in the UK. One of the most 
common types is the hollow core unit (hcu) for floors, roofs and even walls. Figure 1.12 
shows some typical prestressed hcu. The units are produced by approximately 125 com￾panies in Europe. The International Prestressed Hollowcore Association (IPHA) [https://
hollowcore.org] was formed in 1969 to bring the hcu industry together and drive it forward 
with R&D and innovation. It has 57 member companies worldwide that produce the major￾ity of hcu. Figure 2.1 shows a 16m long×400mm depth unit destined for a multi-storey 
car park (commonly known as parking structures). These units are pretensioned longitu￾dinally using tendons such as seven-wire helical strand, shown in Figures 1.13 and 2.2, or 
individual plain or indented circular wire, shown in Figure 2.3, placed in the lower quarter 
of the depth. Note the (approximately) 40mm upward camber due to eccentric prestress in 
Figure 2.1. These units may be designed compositely using a structural topping. Figure 2.4 
shows the preparation for such a topping. Elsewhere the units may receive a non-composite 
finishing screed, such as in offices and housing, or a raised access floor lattice with floor tiles 
in offices or retail buildings.
Prestressed concrete beams are designed in two major types:
• small beams of inverted-tee shape, 150, 180 to 225mm deep, used in beam and block 
flooring for housing (residential, congregation, garages) as shown in Figure 2.5.
• main beams, typically 300 to 600mm wide×300 to 1000mm deep, used to support 
floor slabs or terraces over medium to large spans, of rectangular, inverted-tee or I 
shape, as shown in Figures 2.6 and 2.7.
So-called ‘house beams’ form suspended floors together with infill blocks, either of solid con￾crete (density≈1950kg/m3), aerated concrete (density≈1350kg/m3) or expanded polystyrene 
foam (EPS, density≈20kg/m3) for thermally insulated ground floors (Figure 2.5c). The beams 
are prestressed simply to overcome the problems of large deflections for such shallow depths

having a span/depth ratio up to about 40:1. Today the UK market is around 9,500,000 linear 
m, yielding 4,800,000 sq.m. floor area, approximately 40% of the housing market.
Figure 2.7 shows why inverted-tee beams are the most popular form of main beam -
i. the floor slab is recessed into the top of the beam, reducing the overall depth of con￾struction compared to a rectangular beam where the depth of slab adds to the depth 
of the beam
ii. the beam is highly pretensioned to increase clear span
iii. the floor slab, with or without a structural topping, may act compositely with the 
beam, further increasing capacity or reducing beam depth.
Note that the sides of the upstand have been scabbled to remove surface laitance in order to 
enhance the interface shear resistance between the beam and floor units.
Bate and Bennett (Bate and Bennett, 1976) commence their book on the design of psc as:
Prestressing is a technique whereby the performance of a structure is improved by the 
introduction of a permanent stress (prestress) so as to cancel out some of the stress produce 
by the dead and imposed loading. Concrete, with its inherent weakness in tension, is a 
particularly suitable material for prestressing since a compressive prestress can be used to 
reduce the tensile stress to an acceptably low value or, if desired, to eliminate it altogether.

Figure 2.8 shows the key features of prestressing – to pre-compress the concrete in the ten￾sion face, in this case the soffit (but is equally applicable to the top face in a cantilever) in 
order to partially or totally nullify internal tension due to imposed loads with the aim of 
controlling or eliminating cracking. The final stresses in the top and bottom surfaces (often 
called top and bottom ‘fibres’), which are due to the addition of prestress and bending loads, 
are limited by values given in national Codes of Practice – in this book, the values are based 
on the Eurocode EC2, namely BS EN 1992, Part 1-1 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004). Design pro￾cedures for stress analysis are given in Chapters 6 and 7.

Bate and Bennett add interesting notes of the history of the development of a Code of 
Practice for psc:
Prestressed concrete became a practical possibility in the 1930’s when the phenom￾ena of creep and shrinkage began to be understood, and it was realized that the early 
failures with mild steel tendons could be avoided by the use of high tensile steel. After 
the war, development in Europe, and a little later in America, was rapid and the first 
attempt in the UK to codify a design procedure was made in 1951 when the Institution 
of Structural Engineers published its First Report on Prestressed Concrete (Institution of 
Structural Engineers, 1951). The Report formed the basis of the British Standard Code 
of Practice CP 115 (CP 115, 1959). …supervised by the unified Code CP 110 (CP 110, 
1972) … The main difference in concept between design to CP 115 and that to CP 110 
is the introduction of the limit state approach in the latter Code. The changes in proce￾dure between the two Codes were however small and produced none of the difficulties 
experienced with changes in procedure required for reinforced concrete in adopting 
limit state design. The reason for this was that by its very nature, prestressed concrete 
require separate consideration of the behaviour under normal conditions of loading of 
service from its performance under exceptional conditions such as over loading … and 
hence CP 115 anticipated the need to consider serviceability and ultimate limit states, 
which were later to become an inherent part of limit state design philosophy.
Statically reinforced concrete, known simply as ‘reinforced concrete’ (rc), contains steel 
rebars and shear stirrups to resist internal tensile forces, and together with the compressive 
resistance of the concrete, it provides flexural (bending) and shear strength for beams and 
slabs. However, in practical designs with acceptable load-span capabilities, static rebars 
cannot prevent cracking or a loss of flexural stiffness, leading to increased deflections. 
Prestressed concrete satisfies both strength and stiffness by pre-compressing the concrete 
in the otherwise tensile zone using high-strength steel tendons, such as individual wires or 
helical strands composed of seven wires (three wire strands are available but not common), 
as shown in Figures 1.13 and 2.2, that are first stretched or elongated by about 0.6% of their 
original length (about 1360mm for the 227m long pretensioning bed shown in Figure 1.11). 
After the concrete is cast and hardened, typically after 18hours, the tendons are either cut 
or otherwise released to transfer their pretensioning force to the concrete by bond. This is 
known as the ‘transfer’ stage (sometimes known as the ‘detensioning’ stage). In this way, the 
reinforcement is dynamic rather than static.
The compressive strength of the concrete must be greater than that used in rc (which is 
typically fck =30–35 N/mm2 cylinder strength) for two reasons:
1. if the transfer strength fck(t) is around 25–30 N/mm2 after 18hours (t means time not 
transfer) then the 28days characteristic strength will inevitably be fck =40–55 N/mm2
2. in order to create a fairly well balanced section at the ultimate limit state, with the 
depth to the neutral axis X being about 0.5 times the effective depth to the tendons 
in the tension zone, the strength must also be around fck =45–50 N/mm2. As a simple 
example (the details of which will be given in later chapters), a 300×600mm deep psc 
beam is pretensioned using 12 no. strands (area Ap =93mm2 of characteristic strength 
fpk =1770 N/mm2). Aiming for X=0.5×500=250mm gives fck ≥12×93×0.87×1770/
(0.8×0.567×300×250)=50.6 N/mm2.
If the flexural tension due to external loads at the serviceability limit state does not exceed 
the pre-compression plus an allowance for the flexural tensile strength of the concrete, 34 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
known in Eurocode EC2, Part 1-1 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004) as fctm, the section remains 
uncracked, retaining its full cross-sectional stiffness to resist a much greater imposed load 
than a comparable reinforced concrete section.
The complete flexural, shear and deflection analyses of psc slabs and beams are given in 
Chapters 7–9, 10 and 11, respectively.
Prestressing therefore reduces the net cross section of members, and/or gives longer spans 
for the same imposed loads compared with rc. Figure 2.9 shows the differences in the sim￾ply supported span-to-depth requirements for psc hcu and rc ribbed floor units (with 3 
ribs×150mm wide and a top flange of 60mm depth), both 1200mm wide and of similar 
self-weight, subjected to an imposed dead load of 2 kN/m2 and live loads of 1.5, 5.0 and 
10.0 kN/m2. The hcu design satisfies service and ultimate moments of resistance and ‘active’ 
deflection limit of span/500 after construction (relevant to 1.5 kN/m2 load only). The rc 
ribbed slab satisfies the ultimate moment of resistance and span/depth ratio according to 
BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 7.16a or 7.16b, simultaneously. Taking, for example, a clear span of 
10.0m with the live load=5 kN/m2 the required depth of hcu is 238mm, which would be 
rounded to the nearest commercially available unit of 250mm depth (fck =40 N/mm2, self￾weight=3.27 kN/m2 with 11 no. 12.5mm helical strands of 1023mm2 area at 40mm cover), 
but the required depth of the rc unit is 435mm (fck =30 N/mm2, self-weight=5.03 kN/m2
with 9 no. H16 rebars of 1809mm2 area at 30mm cover). In both cases, the exposure is 
‘internal’, class XC1 to BS 8500-1 (BS 8500-1, 2023), and floor type is for ‘offices’ using an 
ultimate load combination factor ψ0 =0.7 (as explained in Chapters 3 and 5 and in Tables 
3.1 and 5.4). To make a more accurate comparison, because the actual limiting span of the 
250mm deep hcu is 10.23m, the depth of the rc ribbed units at this same span would be 
448mm, with self-weight of 5.16 kN/m2. The reduction in the depth of the slab would be 
45%, or almost 200mm, and a reduction in self-weight of 37%.

Figure 2.10 shows the same differences, this time for the mass of strands in the hcu and 
rebars in the rc ribbed unit (including mesh in the top flange) expressed in kg/m2. The sud￾den increases in mass of rebars are due to the diameter of the main bars jumping to the 
next available size of rebar, e.g. from 16 to 20 mm diameter, and where the graph levels 
are due to the same size of rebars being required over a range of span, e.g. from 10.0 to 
11.5 m. Nevertheless, the greater amount of rebars than strands, typically three times, is 
obviously a consequence of the much greater design stress in strands at the ultimate limit 
state (fpd ≈ 1370 to 1400 N/mm2) than of rebar (fyd = 435 N/mm2), together with the action 
of prestress. Further, there are additional U bars at the supports and A98 mesh (5 mm 
diameter bars at 200 mm spacing gives 98 mm2/m) in the top flange of the rc ribbed units, 
not present in hcu. The economic implications of the data in Figures 2.9 and 2.10 are as 
follows:
The budget cost for hcu and ribbed slabs is built up from direct material costs, produc￾tion costs, transportation and installation costs. The ground floor of a residential building 
could be constructed with prestressed hcu or reinforced concrete ribbed floor slabs: a typical 
example being a clear span of 5.9m, domestic imposed loading of 1.5 kN/m2, 1 kN/m2 for 
lightweight partitions and 1.3 kN/m2 for finishes, services, etc. A prestressed hcu is com￾pared to thermal ribbed units in terms of concrete and steel material usage in Table 2.1. The 
typical cost, at time of writing, of prestressing strand is £1030 per tonne and reinforcement 
bars £750 per tonne. The concrete mixes for both slab types would be similar in cost except 
for the addition of polypropylene fibres in the top flanges of thermal ribbed units. The size 
of the project, location and site logistics has an impact on the overall costs of these products 
when supplied and fitted. The limiting design criteria for the hcu is moment capacity which 
is at approximately 90% for both service and ultimate, the limiting design criteria for the 
ribbed slab is deflection, which is at 93% of capacity,

Rapid changes in weight of bars in rc ribbed

diameter, e.g. from 16 to 20 mm.

concrete hollow core floor units and reinforced concrete ribbed floor units.36 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Prestressed members may also contain static rebars, in the form of shear stirrups, to cater 
for ultimate shear forces that are greater than the shear capacity of the prestressed section. 
Prestressed beams may also contain confinement and strut-and-tie rebars at the supports, 
particularly where recessed half-joints are used, but these rebars are not influenced by pre￾stress. Floor slabs such as hcu (Figure 1.12) and house beams (Figure 2.5) do not contain 
shear reinforcement for production reasons. Their ultimate shear capacity VRd,c is limited 
by the ultimate design tensile strength of concrete fctd acting in the diagonal shear plane, as 
shown in Figure 2.11. The mode of shear failure is often sudden and brittle; therefore, design 
capacity equations contain several hefty factors of safety. In most cases, e.g. uniformly 
distributed load, the shear capacity of these units is rarely critical in favour of the limiting 
flexural tension fctm, so there is no incentive to disrupt production by adding shear stirrups.
Longitudinal statical rebars may also be added to supplement pretensioned tendons in 
so-called ‘partially prestressed members’. The total ultimate moment capacity is the addi￾tion, considering the strain compatibility, of the strength of the tendons plus the statical 
rebars. This has a particular advantage where, in the case of a totally prestressed member 
without additional rebars, the transfer stresses would be much greater than allowed, even 
causing considerable cracking close to the ends of the member where the imposed flexural 
stresses are small. As an alternative to reducing the amount of prestress, at the detriment

of flexural strength, statical reinforcement is added in the regions of maximum imposed 
bending moments. The design of partially prestressed members is extensively dealt with by 
Gilbert et al. (Gilbert et al., 2017) and is therefore not covered in this book.
Prestressed concrete ‘thermal’ slabs, shown in Figure 2.12, are variations on standard 
psc units, but the principles and design methods are the same. These members may have 
wide and shallow flanges, which have to be carefully considered when working alongside 
highly prestressed webs, usually by adding lateral rebars where the two sections meet, but 
the requirements are usually catered for by adding steel mesh, such as A142 (6mm diameter 
bars at 200mm spacing gives 142mm2/m), at the interface.
This book concerns precast prestressed concrete units, pretensioned in a factory (although 
units are manufactured under a weather shield outdoor facility in many countries and nearly 
all tropical countries) to form predominantly floor slabs (solid, voided, ribbed, thermally 
insulated units), main beams, floor beams and terraces/bleachers, but lesser production of 
stair flights, landings, columns and wall panels. This book does not deal with post-tensioned 
prestressed concrete, a subject covered in other text books on prestressed concrete design 
(e.g. Gilbert et al., 2017).
2.2 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND LOAD 
V SPAN TABLES & GRAPHS
2.2.1 Introduction
This section introduces the major precast prestressed concrete floor slab and beam ele￾ments used in buildings. The main objective is to achieve longer spans or shallower depths, 
for the same loading arrangement, compared to comparable rc designs, and to utilise the 
Figure 2.12 Thermal ribbed ground floor units (these were manufactured as reinforced not prestressed 
concrete, although the cross section is the same).38 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
innovations made over the past 70years to produce elements in the controlled environment 
of a factory that cannot be achieved on site. The extruded or slip-formed hcu (Figures 1.12 
and 2.1) is the perfect example. In terms of load carrying capacity and span/depth ratio, 
these one-way spanning units can often rival post-tensioned flat slabs, particularly if they 
are supported on the shallow bottom flanges of inverted-tee beams or steel box section 
beams, and are designed continuously over internal beams and/or columns (see Chapter 13). 
For example, using office loading (2 kN/m2 dead plus 5 kN/m2 live load) floor bay areas of 
10×6m can be achieved within a 300mm structural depth (200mm for 10m span hcu plus 
100mm for the bottom flange of a psc beam) giving a bay area/depth ratio of 200m2/m.
The psc slabs and beams discussed below, together with a range of load v span tables and 
graphs, include
• Solid plank floor units
• Dry-cast, slip-formed or extruded hcu
• Wet-cast voided units
• Double-tee units
• Thermal ground floor units
• Beam and block flooring
• Main beams – chiefly inverted-tee beams
2.2.2 Composite slabs and beams
The structural capacity of psc units may be increased by adding a layer of structurally rein￾forced concrete to the top of the unit. Providing that the topping concrete is fully anchored 
and bonded to the precast unit the two concretes – precast and cast insitu, may be designed as 
monolithic. The section properties of the precast unit plus the topping are used to determine 
the structural performance of the composite floor. A composite floor may be made using any 
of the floor units mentioned above. The minimum thickness of the topping is given in some 
texts as 40mm, but in the author’s design and site experience, this should not be less than 
50–75mm depending on the span of the floor. There is no limit to the maximum thickness, 
although 100mm is a practical limit. Longer term problems due to the movement of the bot￾tom of psc units relative to their support have been reported where the thickness of topping is 
around 150mm. Toppings are reinforced using steel mesh reinforcement such as A98 or A142.
Composite floor design is carried out in two stages, before and after the insitu topping hard￾ens and becomes structural. The precast unit carries its own weight plus the self-weight of the 
wet insitu concrete (plus a construction traffic allowance of 1.5 kN/m2 typically). The com￾posite floor carries imposed dead and live loads. Propping the floor unit prior to casting the 
topping increases ‘performance’ in one of two ways: either increased span or reduced depth. In 
the final analysis, the stresses and forces resulting from the two cases (minus the construction 
traffic allowance, which is temporary) are additive. Chapter 12 gives the full analysis.
Composite beams are likewise designed to either increase the span of the beam or, more 
commonly, reduce the overall construction depth, where the ends of hcu may be recessed 
into the top of inverted-tee beams and designed compositely using small quantities of cast 
insitu infill or a structural topping. Composite beam design is also carried out in two (or 
even three) stages, before and after the insitu infill and/or the topping become structural. 
The precast unit carries its own weight plus the self-weight of the floor units and wet insitu
concrete (plus a construction traffic allowance). The composite beam carries the imposed 
loads. Propping the beam prior to placement of the floor slab can increase capacity consider￾ably for shallow beams with deeper floor units.Why precast, why prestressed? 39
2.2.3 Non-composite solid and hollow core floor units
2.2.3.1 Product development
The hollow cores in the earliest hcu’s were circular rubber tubes filled with small stones, 
around which wet-cast concrete was poured and vibrated into a 4 feet wide mould, prob￾ably 6, 8 and 10 inches deep. When the concrete had hardened sufficiently to resist its own 
weight in bending, the unit was tilted upwards allowing the stones to fall out! In other 
developments, circular pneumatic tubes were pressurised and later deflated to form circular 
cores. Although circular cores certainly reduced the self-weight of the unit, giving a void 
ratio (void-to-total cross-sectional area) of around 50%, to improve on this, the webs and 
top and bottom flanges were too thin. This led to the oval or ‘tunnel’ (inverted ‘pear’ nar￾row at the bottom)-shaped voids when the present generation of hcu was developed in the 
1950s, when the dual techniques of long line prestressing and concrete production through 
machines using semi-dry concrete (you can squeeze the concrete into a ball in your hand) 
were developed by companies such as Spiroll in the USA and Roth in Europe. Chapter 4 
describes the manufacturing methods.
The following references give wider information on the development and design on the 
range of hcu currently available: The Association of Manufacturers of Prestressed Hollow 
Core Floors (ASSAP, 2002), FIB Bulletins (FIB, 2000), FIP recommendations (FIP, 1988), 
Elliott (Elliott & Jolly 2013, Elliott 2017), Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI, 1991) and 
Walraven (Walraven & Mercx, 1983).
Deeper hcus, such as the recently developed 750 and 1000 mm deep units, have void 
ratios nearer to 70%. These units may require steel mesh to stabilise the slender edge 
webs. They have a limited market in buildings, more suited to civil engineering works 
such as cut and cover tunnels. The most common depths range from 150 to 400 mm. 
Most units are 1200 mm wide; Figure 1.12 shows three very efficient profiles compris￾ing 6 or 11 cores. The ‘tunnel’ shape 6 core unit has the benefit of 32 × 32 mm triangular 
fillets giving additional cover to individuals or groups of strands. Hcu are reinforced 
only by longitudinal strands or wires, and, in contravention of standard rc or psc Code 
requirements, do not contain transverse reinforcement, shear or torsion stirrups, U bars 
in the sides or ends, or end hooks or bends for shear-tension anchorage failures. Instead 
they are designed and type-tested according to national product standards, such as BS 
EN 1168 (BS EN 1168, 2005).
Table 2.2 lists a range of hcu from 100 to 500mm depth based on units containing a 
range of larger cores, e.g. 4 to 6 no. per 1200mm width, or smaller (narrower) oval-shaped 
cores, e.g. 9 to 11 per 1200mm width, together with the same service MsR and ultimate MRd
moments of resistance and ultimate shear capacity VRd,c (without shear links).
The height of voids should not exceed h −50mm, where h is the overall depth of the unit. 
The diameter of circular voids is usually h −75mm. The minimum flange thickness depends 
on the overall depth of the unit h, given by 1.6 h, e.g. 25.3mm for h=250mm would be 
considered too thin to manufacture. Because of cover requirements, it is usually necessary 
for the bottom flange to be at least 30mm thick. The minimum width of a web should not 
be less than 30mm. There is other guidance on the shape of the top flange above cores in FIP 
(FIP, 1988). The edge profile, typically 40–60mm in height×10–15mm depth, provides an 
important shear key, which enables the hcu to transfer shear forces, and effectively bending 
moments, between adjacent units to form a pseudo two-way spanning slab, i.e. the hcu do 
not physically span in two directions but lateral load spreading gives the same structural 
effect. See BS EN 1168, Annex C and Elliott (Elliott, 2017) for a wider discussion and 
analysis on this.40 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
2.2.3.2 Load v span tables
Prestressed solid units are typically in the range from 75 to 150mm in depth, although 
depths of less than 100mm are rarely used alone. Hcu’s range from 150 to 500mm in depth, 
although the maximum depth for some manufacturers is 250 or 400mm. The width of units 
is commonly 1200mm, with 600 and 2400mm wide units available for special situations. 
And 1500mm width is (uncommonly) used in some countries in Eastern Europe.
The derived data in the load v span graph shown in Figure 2.13 are based on the following. 
Units are pretensioned using 9.3 and/or 12.5mm diameter 7-wire helical strand comprising of 
7 no. 3 and 4mm diameter clustered wires, respectively. Cover to the soffit is 35mm. In units 
of high prestress top wires are added to control tensile cracking at transfer and upward camber 
prior to installation – top wires comprise 2 or 4 no. 5 or 7mm diameter wires at 30mm top 
cover. The characteristic tensile strength of strands and 5mm wires is fpk =1770 N/mm2, and 
1670 N/mm2 for 7mm wires, pretensioned to 70% fpk. Concrete strength is fck =45 N/mm2 at 
28days and fck(t)=30 N/mm2 at transfer. For hcu, the maximum prestress at transfer in the bot￾tom of the unit is limited to σb(t)≤15 N/mm2, about 0.5 fck(t), but σb(t)≤11 N/mm2 for the solid 
units, while at the same time the stress in the top is limited σt
(t)≥−2.5 N/mm2 at transfer. No 
debonding or deflecting of tendons is allowed, so these are the limiting criteria. Although the 
clear span is mostly limited by the permissible tension in the soffit fctm at the serviceability limit 
state for exposure class XC1, for longer spans the criteria may be limiting active deflection after 
construction of effective span/500, using a quasi-permanent factor ψ2 =0.3.
As a guide for consultants and architects, ‘load v span’ tables are published by hcu manufac￾turers in terms of the limiting clear span against the imposed live load, typically for 1.5 (domes￾tic), 2.5 (car parks), 3.0 (congregation), 5.0 (offices), 7.5 and 10.0 (general storage of 3 to 4m 
in height) kN/m2. The data already include an allowance for finishes of 1.5 kN/m2, although 
they should really include a further 0.5 kN/m2 for services and ceilings, etc. Note that, in these 
tables, the quasi-permanent live load factor for domestic and offices is ψ2 =0.3, for storage it 
is ψ2 =0.8, and otherwise it is ψ2 =0.6. The ultimate combination live load factor for storage 
ψ0 =1.0, otherwise is ψ0 =0.7. Some manufacturers limit the clear span to the criteria that the 
natural frequency of the floor unit is at least fn ≥4Hz, although this may be unconservative in 
special cases where fn ≥7Hz. fn <4Hz may be critical for live loads up to 2.5 kN/m2. Exposure 
is internal class XC1 (although for car parking it should be external class XC3 (See Table 5.4)).

graph in Figure 2.13, but note that, as given above, ψ0 and ψ2 may be different in the table.
2.2.4 Composite solid and hollow core floor slabs
2.2.4.1 Load v span tables
Composite slabs comprise a psc solid or hcu unit together with a cast insitu reinforced 
(usually steel mesh) structural topping. The derived data in the load v span graph shown in 
Figure 2.14 are based on the same solid and hcu’s as above, together with a 75mm (at the 
crown of the span) deep reinforced structural topping. The average self-weight of the topping 
depends on an allowance for the upward camber at installation, typically span/500, and is 
therefore between 1.85 and 2.0 kN/m2. The insitu concrete topping strength is fckT=25 N/mm2. 
Table 2.4 gives an example for the same composite slabs used to generate Figure 2.14.
The precast unit is unpropped during casting of the topping. If the units are propped, 
using 2 no. props at one-third span, the increase in clear span would be between 1.09 and 
1.14 for the 100mm deep solid unit, between 1.02 and 1.06 for the 200mm deep hcu, but 
only 1.01 for the 500mm deep hcu, where the negative propping moment has little effect 
on the service moment of resistance. See Section 12.3.3 for further details about propping.
2.2.5 Wet-cast voided units

Not all hcu are manufactured using ‘dry cast’ long line extrusion or slip forming meth￾ods with water/cement ratios w/c≈0.4, described above, and in more detail in Chapter 4.

concrete is manually placed into moulds around void formers, either psc or reinforced. In 
this book, they are referred to as ‘voided’ units to distinguish from hcu, but are commer￾cially known as wet-cast hollow core slabs.
The structural ‘voids’ are formed using prismatic blocks of high-density polystyrene 
(approx 20kg/m3) in lengths of about 2m, with short solid sections of 300mm length 
between the ends. The ends of the units are solid for a distance of about 500mm and par￾tially solid by reducing the number of voids to accommodate lifting devices for 1200mm.

cover both to the soffit and infill block
ii. placing the infill blocks to form the voids, typically 150 to 300mm wide
iii. second casting of the webs, 50 to 70mm wide and top flange 35 to 50mm depth.
The time delay between (i) and (iii) should not be more than about 45 minutes (depending 
on the consistency of the mix) as it is important to achieve coarse aggregate penetration 
between the two layers. The development of prestress through the flange-web interface must 
be assured.
The introduction of self-compacting concrete (SCC, see Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3) has 
made the operational task of using such delicate materials easier; however, the casting joint 
after stage (i) can be smooth due to the thixotropic nature of SCC, the absence of bleeding 
and the tendency of coarse aggregate to settle beneath the surface. Consequent horizon￾tal cracks may be seen along the casting line at the ends of the unit, where bond stress in

the transmission zone and vertical splitting stresses are greatest. Voided units manufac￾tured using SCC should therefore be tested for shear flow across the casting line at transfer, 
and tested in shear. However, there is a tendency for the buoyancy of the polystyrene to 
cause problems in maintaining the thickness of the top flange. Straps across the top of the 
moulds are used to support the blocks. Tying the blocks to the bottom tendons should not 
be practiced.
The UK market for wet-cast voided units is small, around 5% of the precast flooring mar￾ket, but up to 40% of the North European market for domestic hcu is psc (or rc) wet-cast 
into moulds of fixed dimensions (length and width) and stockpiled for building contractors 
to purchase as the need arises.
Section properties and moment and shear capacities are comparable with the dry cast 
units and self-weights are lower in the deeper units. The big advantage of the wet-cast 
method is that additional reinforcement may be added to standard cages for any special 
requirement, e.g. point loads, large holes or notches, high shear, cantilevers, etc.
Wet-cast voided units are typically in the range from 150 to 300mm in depth. The stan￾dard mould width in the UK is 1200mm, but by virtue of the casting process, block-outs 
may be placed to create any reasonable width, although it is preferred if the moulded edge 
which is flat without a shear key coincides with the edge of a web. To meet sound attenu￾ation values, a higher density unit of 150mm depth is produced with fewer (or narrower) 
void formers to obtain a surface mass of 300 kg/m2 (compared to the standard surface mass 
of 250 kg/m2).

concrete has been used to cast the bottom flange prior to fixing void formers. Units may be

2.2.5.2 Load v span tables
The derived data in the load v span graph shown in Figure 2.17 are based on the follow￾ing. Units are pretensioned using 9.3mm diameter 7-wire helical strand. Cover to the soffit 
is controlled by the axis distance of 30mm, and if required in a second row placed in the 
webs at 50mm. The pretensioning is arranged so that no top wires/strands are required. The 
characteristic tensile strength of strands and 5mm wires is fpk =1770 N/mm2 pretensioned 
to 70% fpk. Concrete strength is fck =45 N/mm2 at 28days and fck(t)=30 N/mm2 at trans￾fer. The maximum prestress at transfer in the bottom of the unit is limited to σb(t)≤13–15 
N/mm2, up to 0.5 fck(t), while at the same time the stress in the top σt(t)≥−2.7 N/mm2 at 
transfer. No debonding of tendons is carried out (this could be a commercial option for 
greater spans with heavier loads) so these are the limiting criteria. Although the clear span is 
mostly limited by the permissible tension fctm in the soffit at the serviceability limit state for 
exposure class XC1, for longer spans with imposed live loads <3 kN/m2 the criteria may be 
limiting active deflection after construction of effective span/500, using a quasi-permanent 
factor ψ2 =0.3. For these conditions, the age of the unit at installation is taken as 28days 
(reducing this to 7days will reduce the limiting clear span by 2%). The usual maximum han￾dling length-to-depth ratio is 55, which may be limiting for the longer spans and/or shallow 
depths (e.g. 150mm).
As a guide for consultants and architects, ‘load v span’ tables are published by wet-cast 
manufacturers on the same basis as hcu, with the same values for ψ2 and ψ0. The data 
already include an allowance for finishes of 1.5 kN/m2. Some manufacturers limit the clear 
span to the criteria that the natural frequency of the floor unit is at least fn ≥4Hz. fn <4Hz 
may be critical for live loads up to 3.0 kN/m2. Table 2.5 gives an example of this table for 
the same units used to generate the load v span graph in Figure 2.17.

The data in Table 2.5 are for internal exposure class XC1 (although for car parking it 
should be external class XC3 (See Table 5.4)). For external exposure class XC3 the effect 
on the final clear span for the range of cases given would be from −11% to +5% as follows. 
The ratio of the clear span for classes XC3/XC1 for the 150mm deep voided unit is from 
1.00 to 1.02. The latter is for an imposed live load>5 kN/m2 where the greater load, being 
multiplied by ψ2 =0.3, has a beneficial effect compensating for the allowable zero tension in 
the soffit. The ratio for the 300mm deep voided unit is from 0.97 to 1.00. Here the latter is 
for live loads>5 kN/m2 where the slab is critical at the ultimate moment of resistance, not 
affected by the limiting tensile stress nor ψ2.
2.2.6 Composite wet-cast voided slabs
2.2.6.1 Load v span tables
Composite slabs comprise a psc wet-cast voided unit together with a cast insitu reinforced 
(usually steel mesh) structural topping. The derived data in the load v span graph shown in 
Figure 2.18 are based on the same wet-cast units as above, together with a 75mm (at the 
crown of the span) deep reinforced structural topping. The average self-weight of the top￾ping depends on an allowance for the upward camber at installation, typically span/500, 
and is therefore between 1.9 and 2.0 kN/m2. The insitu concrete topping strength is 
fckT =25 N/mm2. Table 2.6 gives an example for the same composite slabs used to generate 
Figure 2.18.
The data in Table 2.6 are for internal exposure class XC1. For external exposure class 
XC3 the effect on the final clear span for the range of cases given would be from −11% to 
+5% as follows. The ratio of the clear span for classes XC3/XC1 for the 225mm deep slab 
is from 0.98 to 1.05. The latter is for an imposed live load of 10 kN/m2 for the same reasons 
as for the non-composite units above. The ratio for the 375mm deep slab is from 0.89 to 
1.00. Here the latter is also for the greater live loads for the same reasons as above for the 
non-composite units.
The precast unit is unpropped during the casting of the topping. If the units are propped, 
using one prop at mid-span, the increase in clear span would be between 1.05 and 1.08 for 
the 150mm deep unit, but only 1.01 to 1.06 for the 300mm deep unit, where the negative 
propping moment has a smaller effect on the service moment of resistance.

2.2.7 Composite double-tee floor slabs
2.2.7.1 Product development for double-tee units
Precast psc double-tee floor units evolved from a single-tee T section beam where the deep 
web, 400–1200 mm depth (and sometimes 2000 mm depth where transport permits, e.g. 
USA) is reinforced with helical strands. The top flange, typically 1200 mm wide (from 
the old 4 feet modular width) × 75 to 150 mm depth, depending on the total depth, and 
whether there is a structural topping to cater for transverse bending between the webs. As 
shown in Figures 2.19 and 2.20, the sides of the webs are tapered, typically 40–50 mm,

VRd,c, as shear reinforcement in the form of vertical stirrups is provided for a distance 
from the supports where VEd > VRd,c (see Section 10.2). Some stirrups, or more correctly 
termed ‘links’, are provided close to the support irrespective of the shear capacity, to cater 
for localised end-bearing effects, particularly at half-joints as shown at the ends of the 
units in Figure 2.19.
The axis distance to the first row of strands is 40–50mm, depending on durability 
requirements and the manufacturer’s preference, i.e. cover to links beneath the strands and 
avoidance of localised splitting cracks along the line of the strands. The vertical distance 
between subsequent rows is at least 3×diameters of strand, typically 40–50mm, and the 
horizontal axis distance is 60–100mm depending on the width of the web. Due to the taper 
of the webs the width of the soffit increases as block-outs are added within the full depth 
mould. To avoid stress concentrations at the top of the web a small 40–50mm triangular or 
circular fillet is added.
The next stage in the development was to double the width to 2400mm and add a second 
web (or even third), giving the units immediate stability on site, at 1200mm spacing with 
600mm wide overhangs at each edge, and name the unit a ‘double-tee floor slab’ (or ‘triple￾tee’). The equivalent void ratio (i.e. 1- area of section/area of enveloping rectangle) is about 
0.65–0.75 for 400 and 900mm deep units, respectively, allowing the unit to span over lon￾ger spans and with less weight per floor area than hcu. Mechanical connectors at the edge 
of the outer flange (usually welded plates) enabled the top flange to be designed transversely 
between the webs and between units, as well as providing floor diaphragm action together 
with a structural topping.
Double-tee units achieved even greater spans and reduced mass compared with hcu. 
However, there are two major drawbacks with double-tees
i not being able to provide sufficient pretensioning force to satisfy the available section 
as strands can only be placed in pairs at the bottom of the webs, forcing more strands 
to be positioned higher in the web thereby reducing eccentricity
ii the centroidal axis is high in the section, typically yb =0.7h×depth from the bottom, 
resulting in a low value of the elastic modulus at the bottom Zb relative to the cross￾sectional area, e.g. Zb/Ac h≈0.12 to 0.16 compared with 0.22 to 0.25 for hcu. This 
offers the potential for composite action with a structural topping.
Debonded (or less commonly deflected) tendons are used in some cases to overcome transfer 
stress problems in long span units. To optimise the transfer prestress more accurately about 
1/6 of the total number of strands present at mid-span are debonded at a distance of about 
span/4, and half this number at about span/5.
Figure 2.21 shows a variation of the traditional double-tee unit where the keyed end sec￾tion is made solid to facilitate continuous and composite action between spans, the splayed 
end is reinforced to resist large negative bending moments on either side of the interior main 
beam(s). These units may also be found as triple-tee, up to 2.4m wide.
2.2.7.2 Load v span tables for composite double-tee slabs
Prestressed double-tee units are typically in the range from 300 to 900mm in depth, and 
2400mm in width, comprising a 75–100mm depth top flange and two tapered webs (or 
ribs) of mean width of 200–240mm. The width of the web varies as the depth of the 
unit decreases, typically by 6–8mm per 100mm depth. The width of units is commonly 
2400mm, although if transportation and site access allow, up to 3600mm with three webs 
(triple-tee) are possible.50 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The derived data in the load v span graph shown in Figure 2.22 are based on the follow￾ing. Top flange depth=75mm, and the mean width of each web=220mm. Units are preten￾sioned using pairs of 12.5mm diameter 7-wire helical strand in each of two webs, with axis 
distance from the bottom of the webs at 50, 100, 150, 200mm, etc. using as many strands 
as necessary to satisfy two conditions
i using full prestress, the serviceability limit state for the final composite stress, after 
losses, for the limiting tension in the soffit of fctm, or active deflection after construc￾tion of span/500. Ultimate flexural strength is not critical.
ii using debonded strands, typically net transfer stress at the bottom of the webs due to 
compressive prestress and tensile self-weight alone≤0.6 fck(t), where fck(t)=32 N/mm2
based on a 28days characteristic strength fck =50 N/mm2.
In units of high prestress top strands, say 2 no. 9.3mm diameter, are added to control ten￾sile cracking at transfer and upward camber prior to installation at 40mm top cover. The 
characteristic tensile strength of strands is fpk =1770 N/mm2 pretensioned to 70% fpk (top 
strands are often stressed to 40% fpk).
Table  2.7 gives an example for the same composite double-tee slabs used to gener￾ate Figure 2.22. Compared with composite hcu, taking for example 400 mm deep units 
and an imposed live load of 5.0 kN/m2 the limiting clear span for the double-tee and 
hcu are 11.45 and 15.05 m, respectively, a difference of 31%. One reason for this is 
that the radius of gyration of the composite second moment of area/cross-sectional area 
rc = √(Ic,c/Ac,c) = 122 and 161 mm, respectively, also a difference of 31%. rc is a measure
of the flexural efficiency of a section. Further, the ratio of composite section modulus at 
Figure 2.21 So-called ‘multi-rib’ double-tee floor units with special end details for continuous spans.Why precast, why prestressed? 51
the bottom fibre to area k = Zb,c/Ac,c, often termed the ‘kernel’ (the central or important 
part of something) of the section that controls flexural stress, is 46 and 100 mm, respec￾tively, more than double, due in part to the much greater height to the centroidal axis of 
328 mm for the double-tee compared with 258 mm for the hcu. However, the self-weight 
of the composite double-tee is 5.26 kN/m2 compared with 7.03 kN/m2 for the composite 
hcu, 33% heavier.

The precast unit is unpropped during the casting of the topping. If the units are propped, 
using 2 no. props at one-third span, the increase in clear span would be between 1.02 and 
1.09 for the 300mm deep unit (the greater figure for the smallest live load), between 1.01 
and 1.04 for the 500mm deep unit, but only 1.01 for the 900mm deep double tee, where the 
negative propping moment has little effect on the service moment of resistance.
2.2.8 Non-composite thermal ground floor units
2.2.8.1 Product development
Thermally insulated, wide floor slabs for domestic and residential use, and possibly cer￾tain offices with limited spans (span/depth ratio around 27 compared with 43–47 for non￾composite hcu), are a recent development to compete in the housing market for ground slabs. 
Based on achieving a reference U value of 0.13 W/m2K by virtue of the preformed polystyrene 
thermal coat, the psc (or reinforced concrete) units are structurally similar to double-tee 
units, i.e. a shallow top flange, typically 50–60mm deep and reinforced with either steel 
mesh (A142) or steel or polypropylene fibres, spanning transversely between two webs of 
200–300mm depth. Figure 2.23 shows a cross section for a typical unit. The chamfered 
profile at the edges (50–60mm depth×10–12mm recess) is grouted to form a longitudinal 
joint acting as a shear key. In some other variations, the profile of the soffit of the top flange is 
curved, with a depth of 50mm at mid-width and 70–75mm at the intersection with the webs.

respectively. The 600 mm wide units have greater capacity as they have a greater number 
of prestressed webs per unit width, i.e. 3⅓ per m width. Top flange depth = 50 mm, and 
the mean width of each web = 113 mm (measured at the top of the slope minus the shear 
key). Units are pretensioned using three single 9.3 and/or 12.5 mm diameter 7-wire helical 
strands in each of two webs, with cover to the bottom of the webs 35, 75 and 115 mm, 
plus 2 no. 5 mm diameter wires at 30 mm top cover. The characteristic tensile strength of 
strands and 5 mm wires is fpk = 1770 N/mm2, pretensioned to 70% fpk. Concrete strength 
is fck = 45 N/mm2 at 28 days and fck(t) = 30 N/mm2 at transfer. The maximum prestress at 
transfer in the bottom of the unit is limited in the same way as for hcu. No debonding 
or deflecting of tendons is carried out. The durability criteria is for external ground floor 
exposure, class XC3. For information, the differences in the spans for exposure classes 
XC1 and XC3 are only about 2%. The clear span is always limited by zero tension in the 
soffit at the serviceability limit state. Limiting tensile stress, rather than active deflection, 
is critical due mainly to the larger height to the centroidal axis (0.7 × depth) in these (and 
double-tee) units, compared to hcu (roughly 0.5 × depth), so the flexural stress in the soffit 
is that much greater.
As a guide for consultants and architects, ‘load v span’ tables are published by manufac￾turers in terms of the limiting clear span against the imposed live load, typically 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 
5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 kN/m2. The data already include an allowance for finishes of 1.5 kN/m2. 
The quasi-permanent live load factor for domestic rooms is set as ψ2 =0.3. The ultimate 
combination live load factor is ψ0 =0.7. Some manufacturers limit the clear span to the crite￾ria that the natural frequency of the floor unit is at least fn ≥4Hz, which may be critical for 
live loads up to 2.5 kN/m2. Table 2.8 gives an example of this table for the same units used 
to generate the load v span graph in Figure 2.24.

2.2.9 Composite thermal ground floor slabs
2.2.9.1 Load v span tables
Composite thermal ground slabs comprise a psc unit together with a cast insitu reinforced 
(usually steel mesh, although steel fibres are a popular option) structural topping, as shown in 
Figure 2.25. The derived data in the load v span graph shown in Figure 2.26 are based on the 
same data as for the non-composite units above, together with a 75mm (at the crown of the 
span) deep reinforced structural topping. The average self-weight of the topping depends on an 
allowance for the upward camber at installation, typically span/500, and is therefore between 
1.85 and 2.0 kN/m2. The insitu concrete topping strength is fckT =25 N/mm2. Table 2.9 gives 
an example for the same composite slabs used to generate Figure 2.26. The precast unit is 
unpropped during the casting of the topping unless the ground floor slab is sufficiently elevated.

spans for composite/non-composite unit 1200mm wide×250mm deep is in the range of 
1.13–0.86 for imposed live loads of 10.0–1.0 kN/m2, respectively. For 600×250mm unit, 
the ratio is in the range 1.12–0.89.

2.2.10 T beams (‘house beams’) for beam and block floors
2.2.10.1 Product development
The concept of using structural members spaced apart with concrete infill blocks spanning 
transversely between them has been used in buildings since the 1930s. Victorian rail bridges 
used steel RSJs 18 inches apart with concrete or clay blocks between them. The current 
generation of beam and block flooring, known originally as ‘beam and pot’, because the 
block was hollow and may have resembled a pot, used X-shaped beams (with semi-circular 
webs) of 7 and 9 inches depth. Today the structural members are prestressed (less frequently 
reinforced using lattice cages) inverted T beams, typically 150–225mm in depth in order 
to course with brickwork, and 92–140mm wide at the bottom, respectively. A slip-formed 
version of the T beam, with a good strength/mass ratio, is 155mm depth×115mm wide, 
pretensioned using 3 no. 7mm wires. Wider beams of 225mm width are also used. (The 
beams are known as T beams to distinguish them from the main inverted tee beams.)
T beams, for beam and block flooring, are specified and designed according to the prod￾uct standard BS EN 15037, Part 1: Beams (BS EN 15037-1, 2008), in particular the clear 
spacing between the pretensioning wires, cover to wires for durability and fire resistance 
(see Sections 5.2.2 and 5.5.4). Structural design is carried out according to BS EN 1992-1-1.
The beams are most commonly manufactured by moulding, in inverted moulds as shown 
in Figure 2.27, but may also be slip-formed by machines, as shown in Figure 2.28. In resi￾dential buildings, the beams are positioned with a direct bearing onto load-bearing block￾work, typically with 100mm bearing length, as shown in Figure 2.5b. Bearing pads are 
not used. BS EN 15037-1, clause D.2.1 allows a minimum bearing length of lb =60mm, but 
this cannot be justified according to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 10.9.5.2 for isolated bearings, 
which gives lb ≥95mm on masonry, lb ≥85, 80 and 75mm on insitu concrete, precast, and 
steelwork, respectively. A non-structural screed of between 65 and 75mm thickness is cast 
on to the beams and blocks. At ground floors, a damp proof membrane is laid on to the 
beams prior to casting the screed, as shown in Figure 2.29.
Figure 2.27 Long line wet casting of T beams by moulding.Why precast, why prestressed? 57
Depending on the structural requirements of imposed loads and span, floors are designed 
using single or double beams, as shown in Figure  2.30a, or even triple or quadruple 
beams if necessary. Infill concrete blocks, 440 or 215mm wide, or alternate 440/215mm

(also lightweight blocks 540 or 360mm wide), are placed on the beam’s bearing ledge 
and grouted. As these blocks are classed as ‘resisting blocks’ the floor is completed using 
a typically 65mm depth (non-structural) finishing (or floating) screed, or a wooden floor. 
Concrete blocks are specified according to BS EN 15037, Part 2: Concrete blocks (BS EN 
15037-2, 2009).
Thermally insulated ground floors are provided with 540 or 270mm wide expanded poly￾styrene (EPS) blocks, as shown in Figures 2.5c, 2.30b and 2.31. The first substitution of 
concrete blocks by EPS occurred in Europe, particularly France and Holland in the mid￾1980s, and in the UK in the early 1990s. These insulating blocks passed beneath the beams, 
but later, c.2013, projected above the beam with a stiffer rail to transfer loads directly to 
the top of the beam. See Figure 2.30b. If the EPS rail, or an EPS over-sheet, is used the 
long-term creep strength and deformation of the EPS is checked. EPS blocks are specified 
according to BS EN 15037, Part 4: Expanded polystyrene blocks (BS EN 15037-4, 2010). 
EPS blocks are ‘non-resisting’ and therefore require a structural topping to span transversely 
between beams, typically 70–75mm thickness, reinforced using steel mesh or steel or poly￾propylene fibres.
Lateral distribution of isolated point loads and/or longitudinal wall loads (parallel to 
span) is carried out over several T beams in beam and block flooring, i.e. a point load act￾ing on top of a screeded floor with solid blocks may be distributed over 3 single T beams, 
or up to 6 double beams (See Section 7.1.3 for the results of full scale testing). If the blocks 
are EPS, the numbers are 2 and 4, respectively. For longitudinal wall loads the load spread 
width is limited to about 700mm and therefore the number of beams is also 2 and 4, respec￾tively. Note that lateral distribution is not permitted beyond an edge beam where the load is 
positioned between the first and second beams from the edge.
The beams are defined in BS EN 15037-1 as ‘self-bearing beams - which provide the final 
strength of the floor system independently of any other constituent part of the floor system’, 
i.e. the beams do not require additional structural topping or reinforcements at the supports.

Figure 2.32 Imposed uniformly distributed live load vs clear floor span for prestressed ‘house beam and 
block flooring’. The data include for a 65mm deep screed of self-weight 1.495 kN/m2. Check 
with manufacturers for maximum handling lengths. ‘Single’ etc. refers to the number of beams 
supporting the infill blocks, e.g. ‘double’ has two beams concreted on site side-by-side support￾ing either 440 or 215mm width concrete blocks of 1950 kg/m3 density. The dashed lines are in 
the same sequence as the solid lines. ‘All beams’ are concreted solid on site without blocks.
The beams are therefore designed as non-composite, but composite beams are possible using 
a structural topping which is adequately keyed into the gaps between the beams and blocks, 
as shown in Figure 2.30c.
2.2.10.2 Load v span tables
The derived data in the load v span graph shown in Figures 2.32 and 2.33 are based on 
the following. 150 and 225 mm depth T beams are pretensioned using 5 mm diameter 
wires (less commonly 7 mm wires) with up to 4 wires in 150 mm deep beams, and up to 
8 wires in 225 mm deep beams. Cover to the soffit is 20 and 30 mm, respectively. Top 
wires are not added because the highest wire is at about ⅔ depth from the bottom. The 
characteristic tensile strength fpk = 1770 N/mm2 (1670 N/mm2 for 7 mm wires), preten￾sioned to 70%–75% fpk. Concrete strength is fck = 50–55 N/mm2 at 28 days and fck(t) = 25 
to 32 N/mm2 at transfer. The maximum prestress in the bottom of the unit is limited to 
σb(t) ≤ 18.5 N/mm2 at transfer, about 0.6 fck(t). The stress in the top σt(t) ≥ −0.2 N/mm2 at 
transfer, which is not governing. The durability criteria are for internal exposure, class 
XC1. Although the clear span is mostly limited by the permissible tension fctm in the soffit 
at the serviceability limit state, only 150 mm beams with spans greater than 5.2 m with 
the live load = 1.5 kN/m2 are limited by the active deflection after construction of effective 
span/350 based on non-brittle finishes, using a quasi-permanent factor ψ2 = 0.3.
The type of blocks specified in the load v span graph in Figure 2.32 are 440 or 215mm 
wide x 100mm depth concrete blocks of density 1950kg/m3. These would be used in upper, 
internal floor spaces with a 65mm depth finishing screed (not a structural topping).Why precast, why prestressed? 61
Comparing the load v span performance of single ‘wide’ beams shown in Figure  2.5a (215mm 
width×150mm depth) with the data for narrow beams (92mm width) in Figure  2.30, for 
single beams with 440mm wide blocks limiting clear spans for ‘wide’ beams are 1.24 to 1.28 
times greater for imposed live load of 1.5 and 5.0 kN/m2, respectively. Although the self￾weight of the floor is only 9% greater, the ‘wide’ beam is 2.9 times heavier than the narrow 
beam, so site handling may be an important factor. Unsurprisingly, the limiting clear spans 
for single ‘wide’ beams are almost the same as for double narrow beams, the ratios being 
0.97–0.99, respectively, and the self-weight of beams and blocks is identical (2.38 kN/m2). 
However, ‘wide beams’ use 9 no. wires compared with 8 no. for double narrow beams.
The blocks in the load v span graph in Figure 2.33 are 540 or 270mm wide×180mm 
depth expanded polystyrene (EPS) blocks of grade 80kPa (i.e. 0.08 N/mm2 compressive 
strength) with a density of 20kg/m3. These would be used for thermally insulated ground 
floors with a 75mm depth structural reinforced (steel mesh or fibres) topping laid on top of 
the EPS blocks, designed to span transversely between the beams.
As a guide for consultants and architects, ‘load v span’ tables are published by manufac￾turers in terms of the limiting clear span against an imposed live load of 1.5 and 3.0 kN/m2
for residential and congregation use. The data for floors with concrete blocks include an 
allowance of 1.5 kN/m2 for a 65mm depth screed, and data with EPS blocks an allow￾ance of 1.725 kN/m2 for a 75mm screed. The factors are ψ2 =0.3 and 0.6 for domestic and 
congregation use, and ψ0 =0.7. Single, double and triple beams are given here, but alternate 
single-double beams, quadruple beams or even solid beams (no concrete blocks) are pos￾sible. Some manufacturers limit the clear span to the criteria that the natural frequency 
of the floor unit is at least fn ≥4Hz, which may be critical for live loads up to 2.5 kN/m2. 
Table 2.10a and b gives an example of this table for the same units used to generate the load 
v span graph in Figures 2.32 and 2.33 for concrete blocks and EPS blocks, respectively.

Figure 2.33 Imposed uniformly distributed live load vs clear floor span for prestressed insulated ground 
floor ‘house beam and block flooring’. The data include for a 75mm deep screed of self-weight 
1.725 kN/m2. Beams support either 540 or 270mm width polystyrene (EPS) blocks of 20kg/m3
density. All other information is as per Figure 2.32.62 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The reduction in the clear span by specifying ‘congregation’ floor use (where ψ2 =0.6) 
for a live load of 3 kN/m2 compared with ‘domestic’ use (where ψ2 =0.3) occurs only for 
150mm beams where active deflection is limiting in some cases. This does not occur with 
225mm deep beams. The reduction for double beams is 3% to 8%, and for triple beams is 
6% to 10% – the latter value is for narrower blocks. The values are roughly the same for 
both concrete and EPS blocks.

be used as external beams, but reinforced L-shape or deep spandrel beams supporting slabs 
and the external façade are preferred. It is possible for slabs to be supported perpendicular 
to the span of the beam on one side and run parallel to the beam on the other side, where a 
notional load-bearing span of 1.0m is taken on this side. In this case, beams are subjected to 
bending moments, shear forces and torsional moments (see Section 10.6). Main beams are 
specified and designed as linear elements according to the product standard BS EN 13225 
(BS EN 13225, 2013). Structural design is carried out to BS EN 1992-1-1.
There are three main types of psc main beams, shown in Figure 2.34
1. rectangular cross section – the simplest beam to design and structurally efficient, 
although the total construction depth is the sum of the depth of the beam and slab.
2. inverted-tee beams – where the slab is recessed into the top of the beam such that the 
total construction depth is the depth of the beam alone, and maybe the thickness of 
a structural topping on the slab. To achieve this, the width is typically 500–600mm, 
although shallower and wider beams of up to 1200mm have been used.
3. I beams, comprising a wide bottom flange (600–1000mm width), a narrow web (200–
300mm width) and either a wide or narrow top flange (similar to ‘M-type’ bridge 
beams) depending on whether the beam is designed non-compositely or compositely, 
respectively. Here they resemble the top part of inverted-tee beams, such that the mini￾mum depth of the beam is about 900mm. For this reason, I beams are not commonly 
used in most commercial or parking structures, where head-room is at a premium. 
Flanges may have tapered inside faces; typically 30mm slope, to assist with demould￾ing, or may be curved with a radius to blend with the vertical face of the web.
As an example of the structural efficiency of the three types of beams, Table 2.11 gives the 
service MsR and ultimate MRd moments of resistance for beams of 900mm depth. The char￾acteristic tensile strength of strands is fpk =1770 N/mm2, pretensioned to 70% fpk. Concrete 
strength is fck =45 N/mm2 at 28days and fck(t)=30 N/mm2 at transfer.
Although the inverted-tee beam (self-weight 12.25 kN/m) has the greatest value of MsR the 
number of strands to achieve this is N=42, such that MsR/N=35.1 kNm/strand. The rectan￾gular beam (self-weight 7.88 kN/m) has MsR 51% lower, but MsR/N=37.7 kNm/strand. The 
I beam (self-weight 8.53 kN/m) has MsR 21% lower, but MsR/N=42.1 kNm/strand. If these 
ratios are expressed in terms of the self-weight of the beams, the reader will see that both the 
rectangular and I beam outperform the inverted-tee beam by a factor of about 1.65. In spite 
of this, the inverted-tee beam is the easiest beam to design, reinforce and manufacture. For 
this reason, the inverted-tee beam is presented in the load v span graphs.
2.2.11.2 Load v span graph
The load v span graph shown in Figure 2.35 for non-composite inverted-tee beams is pre￾sented in terms of the total imposed ultimate dead and live UDL wEd (excluding the self￾weight of the beam). It is presented as the ultimate load, rather than the service load, due 
to the large number of permutations for dead and live floor loads. However, in order to 
obtain the data for the most typical combination, the imposed dead load is set as gk =30 
kN/m, based on a 200mm deep hcu (say 3 kN/m2, plus finishes and services of 2 kN/m2
acting over spans of 6.0m on either side of the beam). The service live load qk is obtained 
from the total ultimate using BS EN 1990 (BS EN 1990, 2002) Exp. 6.10b 1.25 gk +1.5 qk. 
See Section 3.1.3. Note that Exp. 6.10b gives the critical service load qk as low as wEd ≈45 
kN/m, whence qk is only about 5 kN/m. Should gk differ from 30 kN/m, by say ±20%, the 
clear spans are still valid to ±0.7% as the live load qk compensates for the change in gk, as 
qk =(wEd −1.25 gk)/1.5.64 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

It is not usual for manufacturers to publish load v span tables for beams due to the large 
permutations in beam sizes, slab depths, range of dead and live loads, etc.
The derived data in the load v span graph shown in Figure 2.35 are based on the follow￾ing. The total width of beams is 600mm, with a 350mm wide×200mm deep upstand in 
order to recess 200mm deep floor units (assumed to be hcu). The net bearing length for Why precast, why prestressed? 65
the beam to column or wall support is taken as 140mm. Beams are pretensioned using 
12.5mm diameter 7-wire helical strands, with axis distance from the bottom at 50, 100, 
150, 200mm, etc. using as many strands as necessary to satisfy two conditions.
i. Using full prestress, the serviceability limit state for the final stress, after losses of 0.45 
fck in the top of the beam (and not fctm in the soffit, often the situation with inverted￾tee sections). The active deflection after construction of span/500, or ultimate flexural 
strength are critical.
ii. Using debonded strands, typically net transfer stress at the bottom of the webs due to 
compressive prestress and tensile self-weight alone≤0.6 fck(t), where fck(t).=30 N/mm2.
The strands are debonded at ¼ and ¾ of the effective span. There are 8 no. strands in the 
bottom row (9 no. for 800 mm depth beam) of which 4 are debonded, and 4 or 6 no. in 
the second row of which 2 are debonded. There are 2 no. strands at the top of the boot

and 2 no. at the top of the upstand, all at axis distances of 50mm from edges. Note that, 
in generating the load v span data for different beam depths and ultimate loads, it is not 
possible for the final net prestress at the point of debonding to be exactly the same in all 
cases because the strands are positioned at 50mm increments, so there is a small scatter in 
the results.
The characteristic tensile strength of strands is fpk =1770 N/mm2, pretensioned to 70% 
fpk. Concrete strength is fck =45 N/mm2 at 28days and fck(t)=30 N/mm2 at transfer. For 
maximum prestress at transfer in the bottom of the unit is limited to σb(t)≤15 N/mm2, 
about 0.5 fck(t), while at the same time the stress in the top is limited σt(t)≥−2.7 N/mm2 at 
transfer. The clear span (between column or wall faces) is limited by the permissible tension 
in the soffit fctm at the serviceability limit state for exposure class XC1. Due to the deep and 
large cross section of the beam the criteria of active deflection after construction of effective 
span/500 is not critical, using ψ2 =0.3 for domestic floor use. Even if ψ2 =0.8 for storage the 
active deflection is less than 0.8 times its limiting value.
2.2.12 Composite inverted-tee main beams
2.2.12.1 Load v span graphs
Composite beams comprise a psc inverted-tee beam together with precast floor slabs, either 
hcu or solid (but not double-tee or other ribbed units), with cast insitu infill at the ends of the 
floor units. For hcu the infill is placed in opened cores for a distance of 500–600mm depend￾ing on tying requirements for tie steel rebars. Composite action may further be increased 
using a reinforced structural topping on the floor units; however, the data in Figures 2.36 
and 2.37 are for beams with the hcu alone without topping. The insitu concrete topping 
strength is fckT =25 N/mm2. It is difficult to form composite action using solid units without 
the use of a structural topping.
Unlike the non-composite beam which is critical in the top fibres, the serviceability limit 
state for the final stress of composite beams is fctm in the bottom of the beam, due to the 
increase in the height of the composite centroidal axis, from about 0.41 to 0.62×depth of 
beam.
The derived data in the load v span graphs shown in Figures 2.36 and 2.37 are based on 
the same non-composite beams, but designed compositely with 200 and 300mm depth hcu, 
respectively, cast solid at their ends using insitu concrete fcki=25 N/mm2. Data include the 
self-weight of the beam as indicated in the graph. The service dead load is Gk =30 and 36 
kN/m, comprising 18 and 24 kN/m for the self-weight of the 200 and 300mm depth hcu, 
respectively, plus 12 kN/m for finishes & services. The service live load Qk is obtained from 
the ultimate load based on BS EN 1990, Exp. 6.10b, i.e. Qk =(Total ultimate load in graph 
−1.25 Gk)/1.5.
The increases in span, due to composite action are summarised in Table 2.12 (referred to 
as ‘C’) for the 400 and 800mm deep beams.
The precast beam is unpropped during the placement of the floor units and casting of 
the infill. The flexural stresses resulting from removing the props, applied finishes/services, 
etc. and live loads are carried by the composite section. If the beams are propped, using 2 
no. props at one-third span, these are also summarised in Table 2.12 (referred to as ‘CP’) 
for the 400 and 800mm deep beams. Note that for the reasons mentioned above (viz. small 
scatter in results due to strands positioned at 50mm increments) the trends over the range 
of imposed loads may vary a little. However, it is clear that for the deeper beam, the ratio 
of the increases in clear span is almost independent of the imposed ultimate load, whereas 
for the shallower beam, composite action (and propping) is more beneficial for the greater Why precast, why prestressed? 67

increased further for the 300mm depth hcu. The maximum ratio for the 400mm depth 
beam is 1.60, justifying the placement of small quantities of cast insitu infill at the ends of 
the hcu, and, if commercially viable, i.e. additional time and resources, the use of propping.
2.3 COMPARISON OF THE DESIGN OF A PRECAST PRESTRESSED 
FLOOR SLAB AND CAST INSITU FLAT SLAB
To conclude this chapter a comparison of the design of a rectangular floor bay, 6.0 m×9.6m 
floor span, as part of the building layout in a multi-storey building shown in Figure 2.38 
(grid 1–2,C-D) is carried out using reinforced and prestressed concrete beams and pre￾stressed hcu slab solution and a cast insitu flat slab. These were designed by, and published 
in Worked Examples to Eurocode 2, Section 3.4, Flat slab (The Concrete Centre, 2012). 
The loading used for the design was self-weight, 1.0 kN/m2 for finishes, 4.0 kN/m2 for 
imposed live load, and 10 kN/m perimeter dead load. The precast hcu floors also had an 
additional 1.2 kN/m2 for a levelling screed, included in the values for the weight of concrete 
in Table 2.13. The weight of steel for the flat slab solution was calculated from the informa￾tion given in Figure 2.39 where some assumptions had to be made regarding exact reinforce￾ment bar lengths for the flat slab, but these are not overly conservative and are based on 
typical detailing methods.68 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

The reinforcement and concrete weights are based on the material that falls within 
the 6.0×9.6m footprint on plan, i.e. half of the internal beam is considered in the totals. 
Concrete density taken as 2450kg/m3. The typical cost, at time of writing, of prestressing 
strand is £1030 per tonne and reinforcement bars £750 per tonne.
The concrete weight can be reduced by approx 27% when using a prestressed option 
instead of the insitu flat slab. The reduction in steel usage is greatest using the fully pre￾stressed option as the weight of steel is reduced by approximately 68% compared to the 
flat slab. The design of the flat slab is slightly conservative, so the design could be value￾engineered to reduce material usage in this solution. Even with some savings on the flat slab, 
this exercise demonstrates the potential that prestressed concrete has to deliver benefits in 
terms of reduced material usage, reduction in loading to superstructures and substructures 
and the positive contribution to the sustainability of a building.

3.1 BASIS FOR DESIGN
3.1.1 Basis for the design of precast buildings
The basis for the design of precast concrete buildings and prestressed elements is no different 
from that for the design of any other form of concrete construction, except perhaps for par￾ticular aspects of the design for temporary stability and the quality control exercised in the 
controlled environment of the factory, assuming, of course, that the factory is in a temperature￾and humidity-controlled environment.
Precast concrete buildings are characterised in the vast majority of projects by simply sup￾ported spans, most often by prestressed floor slabs spanning perpendicular to prestressed 
beams, producing a two-dimensional grid of discrete one-way spanning elements. Figure 1.1 
shows a typical example of prestressed floor slabs and beams. Beams are either simply sup￾ported at pinned joints at the faces of multi-storey columns, or on top of single-storey col￾umns, or are designed and constructed as continuous elements at moment-resisting joints. In 
the former, stability is achieved using shear walls, cores or cross-bracing (depending on the 
height of the building), and in the latter, by frame action, where the moment of resistance 
of prestressed beams is usually made composite by the contribution from prestressed floor 
slabs with or without a cast insitu structural topping. This is a key factor in the preliminary 
design. Unlike simply supported prestressed beams, continuous and cantilever prestressed 
beams must be carefully analysed and designed to cater for the negative bending moment 
in a section that is already eccentrically prestressed (see Chapter 13). The fib handbook 
Bulletin 74 (FIB, 2014) is an important publication for the planning and preliminary design 
of precast concrete structures.
The principles and requirements for safety, serviceability and durability are given in 
Eurocode EC0 (BS EN 1990, 2002) where Section 2, Clause 2.1 establishes the basis for 
design – that building structures shall be designed to have structural resistance, service￾ability and durability, fire resistance for the required period of time, and not be damaged 
by explosion, impact and human errors that are disproportionate to the original cause. The 
latter is commonly known as ‘structural integrity’. Clause 2.1(5) is particularly relevant to 
precast buildings and individual prestressed elements, i.e. ‘selecting a structural form and 
design that can survive adequately the accidental removal of an individual member, or lim￾ited part of the structure, or the occurrence of acceptable localized damage’ … ‘tying the 
structural members together’. The fib Bulletin 63 (FIB, 2012) devotes an entire publication 
of 72 pages to this topic.
In prestressed concrete, the term ‘serviceability’ has dual meaning, in that it also implies 
that due to the presence of pretensioning forces giving rise to upward camber, certain stresses 
may not be exceeded under the characteristic service load.

BS EN 1990 clauses 3.1 to 3.5 establish the principles of limit state design outlined here 
in Sections 3.1.2–3.1.5. Clause 4.1 establishes the variables for actions, e.g. permanent 
(dead loads), variable (live loads) and accidental loads, and Clause 4.2 deals with materials. 
Clauses 6.3 to 6.5 define the design values of actions and resistance, and the values for ulti￾mate and serviceability limit states. Annex A.1 (for buildings) provides the substance to the 
above with regard to the load combinations given here in Sections 3.1.2–3.1.5) and ψ factors 
in Table 3.1. Finally, Informative Annexes B, C and D expand on structural reliability, reli￾ability factors, e.g. expressions to determine ψ0 factors for two variable actions, and for the 
design assisted by testing, respectively.
National Annexes, e.g. the UK National Annex for Eurocode 0 (NA to BS EN 1990, 
2002) provide nationally determined parameters; those relevant to precast buildings are
i. design working life, i.e. 50years for buildings and other common structures (Table 
NA.2.1.)
ii. ψ factors for the characteristic, frequent and quasi-permanent load combinations for 
buildings (Table NA.A1.1) are reproduced here in Table 3.1.
iii. partial safety factors γ for equilibrium and over-turning of structures or elements 
(Table NA.A1.2 (A))
iv. γ partial safety factors for structural actions, i.e. loads (Table NA.A1.2 (B))
v. design values for accidental combinations of actions (Table NA.A1.3). Seismic actions 
are not dealt with in this book.
vi. for the function of and damage to elements, the characteristic combination of loads is 
used for the serviceability limit state (clause NA.2.2.6, and Table A1.4), i.e. the full 
leading live load with the characteristic value ψ0 for accompanying live loads.
vii. guidance on the use of Informative Annexes B, C and D on structural reliability, reli￾ability factors, e.g. obtaining ψ0 factors, and design assisted by testing is generally 
accepted (clause NA.3.1 for buildings).
3.1.2 Partial safety factors for serviceability limit states
The principles and requirements for safety given in BS EN 1990 include related aspects of struc￾tural reliability in defining the so-called ‘Consequences classes’ for examples of buildings and 
civil engineering works given in Table B.1 of BS EN 1990. For residential and office buildings, 
this is defined as CC2. The lower consequences class CC1 is for agricultural buildings and is

structural members is defined in Table C.2 as an irreversible serviceability limit state. Thus, the 
combination of actions for the serviceability limit state of stress is given in BS EN 1990, clause 
6.5.3, Exp. 6.14 as the ‘characteristic’ combination.

ψ0.i is the live load factor given in the UK National Annex (NA to BS EN 1990. 2002) 
Table NA.A1.1, reproduced here in Table 3.1.
Qk.i are accompanying live loads
For imposed loads in all uses of buildings ψ0 =0.7, except that for storage ψ0 =1.0. The origin 
of the statistical combination of variable loads may be traced back to Turkstra’s rule (Turkstra 
1970). For the combination of two independent time variant loads, the maximum effect of the 
combination is when the leading action takes its maximum value during the reference period 
and the other, an accompanying action, is at an arbitrary point-in-time value. Figure 3.1.
A single value is used for Gk if its coefficient of variability is small, between 0.05 and 0.1. 
This is certainly the case for precast prestressed concrete where the mass of elements (viz. 
cross-sectional area) is controlled to be less than ±0.03 of the design value for slabs and less 
than ±0.01 for beams. Otherwise, two values of Gk are specified: an upper value Gk,sup and 
lower value Gk,inf. Variations in cast insitu structural toppings may be up to ±0.05 of the 
design value due to both thickness and concrete density, even though allowances for the 
change in thickness due to upward camber of prestressed slabs, possibly 20mm in a 6–8m 
span, are included in the design value.

Each characteristic live load Qk is considered in turn as the leading action when calculat￾ing service bending moments. The exception is stair landings where Qk for the flight and 
landing are both leading, and this also applies to ultimate combinations. The greatest value 
for each permutation is taken as the maximum design value. In continuous spans, the mini￾mum load ∑Gk,j+P is considered in alternate spans to obtain the greatest bending moments, 
or in every third span to obtain the greatest shear force. In cantilevers, the minimum load is 
considered in both the cantilever and main span to obtain the greatest bending moments and 
shear forces, but not applied for the greatest support reaction at the start of the cantilever. 
The above cases are summarised in Figure 3.2.
The characteristic combination is used in the calculation of limiting tensile service stresses, 
after all losses of prestress, according to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.3.2 (4) (BS EN 1992-1-1, 
2004) as not greater than σcp. This is defined in clause 7.3.2 (2) as σcp =fct,eff=fctm, where fctm is 
the mean axial tensile strength defined in Table 3.1. This is the basis of the design procedure 
used in Section 7.2.
Some designers ignore the term ∑ψ0.i Qk,i in Eq. 3.1 on the grounds that if ψ0.should 
increase due to a change of use of the floor the design is unaffected. The characteristic ser￾vice load is then simply the sum of all dead and all live loads.

The combination of actions used for the calculation of crack width, defined in BS EN 
1992-1-1, Table 7.1N and the UK National Annex to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table NA.4 (NA to 
BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004) is known as the ‘frequent’ combination. It is distinguished from the 
characteristic combination as a ‘reversible’ limit state; Eurocode BS EN 1990 explains this 
as ‘there are no consequences of actions exceeding the specified service requirements will 
remain when the actions are removed’.
Thus, the combination of actions for the serviceability limit state of cracking is given in 
clause 6.5.3, Exp. 6.15 as the ‘frequent’ combination
∑G P k j, + +ψ ψ 1.1Q Q k.1 + ∑ 2.i k i, (3.2)
where
ψ1.1 is the frequent live load factor for leading actions
ψ2.i is the quasi-permanent live load factor for accompanying actions also given in Table 
NA.A1.1.
For imposed loads in all uses of buildings ψ1 =0.5–0.7, except for storage it is ψ1 =0.9. For 
imposed loads in all uses of buildings ψ2 =0.3–0.6 for all uses of buildings, except for stor￾age it is ψ1 =0.8. Some designers ignore the term ∑ψ2.i Qk,i in Eq. 3.2 for the same reasons 
as above.
Each live load is considered in turn as the leading action when calculating the frequent 
value for service bending moments used to calculate crack widths. The greatest value for 
each permutation is taken as the design value.
For exposure class XC1 the limiting crack width is wmax =0.2mm, according to Table 
NA.4 of the NA to BS EN 1992-1-1. The limiting tensile stress is defined above as fctm. This 
is also summarised in Table 11.2 for the maximum crack width for prestressed concrete ele￾ments with bonded tendons.
However, for exposure classes XC2, XC3 and XC4, the limiting crack width is also 
wmax =0.2mm, but the section is also checked for ‘decompression’, i.e. zero tensile stress 
is allowed, or fctm → 0, under quasi-permanent loads. Thus, the combination of actions for 
the serviceability limit state is given in BS EN 1990, clause 6.5.3, Exp. 6.16 as the ‘quasi￾permanent’ combination.
∑G P k j, + + ∑ψ 2.iQk i, (3.3)
where
ψ2.i is the quasi-permanent live load factor for all actions
Note that the limiting tensile stress of fctm is also checked under the characteristic load, so 
two calculations are necessary. The characteristic combination may be critical for ‘large’ live 
loads, say 7.5 kN/m2 or more, where ψ2 =0.3, although it is likely that for such live loads ψ2
will be 0.6 and is less critical.
For exposure classes XD and XS, the limiting crack width is also wmax =0.2mm, but the 
section is also checked for ‘decompression’ under frequent loads, defined in Eq. 3.2. The 
Code also specifies that for the decompression limit, all parts of tendons should lie at least 
25mm within concrete in compression, i.e., a nominal cover from the surface of ≥25mm. 
This is satisfied for exposure classes greater than XC1 according to BS 8500-1 (BS 8500-1, 
2023), Table A.4, summarised here in Table 3.2.78 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Compressive stresses due to characteristic (i.e. full) service loads and prestress are 
limited according to BS EN 1992-1-1, clauses 7.2 (2) and 7.2 (3) to guard against longi￾tudinal horizontal splitting or spalling. Clause 7.2 (2) only specifies a limiting compres￾sive stress of 0.6 fck for exposure classes XD and XS, not XC. However, it is common 
practice to limit compression to 0.6 fck for exposure XC, although it is rarely critical 
against the unfavourable situation in tension, except for some inverted-tee sections with 
relatively deep bottom flanges. Clause 7.2 (3) specifies a limiting compressive stress of 
0.45 fck for all exposure classes under quasi-permanent loads in order to avoid non￾linear creep. However, it will be shown in Section 7.2.1 that the presence of non-linear 
creep is avoided if all other limitations mentioned above are satisfied. Checking the 
compressive stress of 0.45 fck under quasi-permanent loads is rarely critical for exposure 
XC1, unless the imposed live load is very small and self-weight and dead loads domi￾nate. In design, it is often, but not always, convenient to limit the compressive stress to 
0.45 fck for all situations.
The above combinations of actions, limiting stresses and crack widths are summarised in 
Table 3.3 for prestressed concrete members with bonded tendons. Note that this book does 
not address unbonded tendons.

3.1.3 Partial safety factors for ultimate limit state
BS EN 1990, clause 6.4.1 (1)P defines the following ultimate limit states (relevant to this 
book) as
• STR: internal failure or excessive deformation of the structure or structural members 
where the strength of construction materials governs, i.e. structural strength such as 
flexural, shear, bearing or compressive strength
• EQU: loss of static equilibrium of the structure or any part of it, i.e. overturning, uplift
Load combinations are less complicated than the serviceability limit state. Fundamental (as 
distinct from accidental) combinations for STR are given in clause 6.4.3.2 as either Exp. 6.10
∑ γ + G j, G P k j, γ + p Qγ + ,1Q Q k.1 ∑ γ Q i, 0 ψ .i k i, (3.4)
or the greater of Exp 6.10a or 6.10b
∑ γ + G j, G P k j, γ + p Qγ + ,1ψ ψ 0.iQ Q k.1 ∑ γ Q i, 0.i k i, (3.5a)
∑ ξγ G j, G P k j, + γ p Q + γ ,1Q Q k.1 + ∑ γ Q i, k i, (3.5b)
where ξ is a reduction factor for dead loads. The value of this in the UK NA to BS EN 1990, 
Table NA.A1.2(B) is ξ=0.925. (Note that in EN 1990 it is ξ=0.85).
There is no obvious reason to use Exp. 6.10 except for the same reason as mentioned for 
service loads – that if ψ0.increases due to a change in use of the floor the design is unaffected.
The partial safety factors for dead and live loads are given in Table NA.A1.2 (B) as
• γG,j=1.35 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=1.5 for unfavourable situations, i.e. maximum load
• γG,j=1.0 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=0 for favourable situations, i.e. minimum load
Simplified, and using ψ0 =0.7 for offices and residential buildings, the maximum loads are
Exp 6.10a is 1.35 Gk +1.05 Qk (3.6a)
Exp 6.10b is 1.25 Gk +1.5 Qk (3.6b)
and the minimum load is 1.0 Gk (3.6c)

Exp. 6.10b governs if the ratio between the dead and live load is Gk/Qk <4.5, a common 
situation. Floor loads for a typically 6m span prestressed hollow core floor slab for office 
loading are (say) Gk =4.6 kN/m2 and Qk =5.0 kN/m2 (including partitions), then wEd (Exp. 
6.10a)=11.46 kN/m2 and wEd (Exp. 6.10b)=13.25 kN/m2. The global factor of safety being 
γF =13.25/9.6=1.38.
Figure 3.3 shows service and ultimate floor loads as a function of the simply supported 
clear spans of typical prestressed hollow core slabs (except 100mm deep solid slab), where 
the service dead and live UDL are 2.0 and 5.0 kN/m2, respectively. It shows that Exp. 6.10b 
governs, where wEd (Exp. 6.10b)≈1.13 wEd (Exp. 6.10a). The criteria for the limiting spans 
at the serviceability limit state is the tensile stress fctm up to a span of 10.3m, thereafter the 
span is controlled by the natural frequency of the completed floor being taken as ≤4Hz, for 
office conditions.
The partial safety factor for prestressing γP is not applied to the ultimate limit state for 
flexure, but for the ultimate shear capacity a factor of γP =0.9 is applied to the axial prestress 
(see Section 10.2.2).
3.1.4 Partial safety factors for equilibrium

∑ γ + G,jG Q k j, γ + Q,1 k.1 ∑ γ Q,i i ψ0. Qk i, (3.7)
The partial safety factors are given in Table NA.A1.2 (A) as (called here Set 1)
• γG,j=1.1 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=1.5 for unfavourable situations, i.e. maximum load
• γG,j=0.9 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=0 for favourable situations, i.e. minimum load

floor slabs.Basis for the design of prestressed concrete elements 81
The clause also states that if the verification of equilibrium also involves the resistance of struc￾tural members, i.e. in a cantilever where the moment of resistance at the start of the cantilever 
is also critical, a combined verification should be adopted as follows (called here Sets 2 and 3)
• γG,j=1.35 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=1.5 for unfavourable situations
• γG,j=1.15 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=0 for favourable situations
As well as γG,j=1.0 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=1.5 for unfavourable situations
• γG,j=1.0 and γQ,1 =γQ,i=0 for favourable situations
There is a problem here, as Set 1 may be more critical than Set 2. Consider a cantilever floor 
if span Lʹ subjected to the same characteristic loads as in the previous example where the 
main span L=6.0m. Equilibrium is checked for the unfavourable cantilever load w2 and 
favourable main span w1.
• Set 1. wʹ=1.1×4.6+1.5×5.0=12.56 kN/m2. w=0.9×4.6=4.14 kN/m2. The critical 
span Lʹ is given when the reaction at the remote end of the main span is zero, i.e. 
−12.56 Lʹ 2/2/6.0+4.14×6/2≥0. Then Lʹ≤3.44m.
• Set 2. wʹ=1.35×4.6+1.5×5.0=13.71 kN/m2. w=1.15×4.6=5.29 kN/m2. Then −13.71 
Lʹ 2/2/6.0+5.29×6/2≥0. Then Lʹ≤3.73 m
• Set 3. wʹ=1.0×4.6+1.5×5.0=12.1 kN/m2. w=1.0×4.6=4.6 kN/m2. Then −12.1 
Lʹ 2/2/6.0+4.6×6/2≥0. Then Lʹ≤3.70m
For this reason, Set 1 is more often considered to give the critical case. A point load, due to a 
balustrade or wall, at the end of the cantilever may change these relative values. Furthermore, 
the critical span of the cantilever slab is found to be 3.44m, much greater than commonly 
used in practice.
If there are two cantilevers, one at each end of the main span, then the favourable load is 
also used in the second cantilever in turn.
3.1.5 Partial safety factors for accidental actions, 
including exposure to fire
Accidents are unintended actions, such as loss of bearing, impact, or explosions, and may be 
of short duration, and a low probability of occurrence. Accidents generally occur when the 
full characteristic live load is not present, and so the fundamental combination of the lead￾ing live load Qk.1 is multiplied by the frequent factor ψ1 <1, and the accompanying live loads 
Qk,i, each considered in turn, are multiplied by the quasi-permanent factor ψ2 <1.
Accidental combinations are given in Table NA.A1.3 (Exp. 6.11 is not used) as the fun￾damental combination
∑G A k j, + + d k ψ ψ 1.1Q Q .1 + ∑ 2.i k i, (3.8)
where Ad is the leading accidental action, such as tie forces when a support fails and slabs 
and beams sag in a catenary model, indirect thermal action due to fire, or the impact force.
There are no partial safety factors, effectively all γ=1.00.
The frequent factor ψ1.1 is also given in the National Annex to BS EN 1991-1-2 (NA BS 
EN 1991-1-2, 2002) clause 4.3.1 (2). Note that EN 1992-1-2 recommends the factor as 
quasi-permanent ψ2.1.82 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
For prestressed concrete slabs and beams in multi-storey concrete, precast concrete or 
steel frames, the preferred design method to resist accidental floor loads is the use of cat￾enary ties. Refer to Elliott (Elliott, 2017) Chapters 11 and 12.
3.2 PARTIAL FACTORS FOR MATERIALS
The partial safety factor at the ultimate limit state for concrete γc=1.5 and steel rebars and 
prestressing tendons γs=1.15 are given in BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.1N. The factors at service 
and for accidental actions are all 1.0. The UK National Annex uses the same values.
A further factor is applied to concrete in axial and/or flexural compression of αcc=0.85, 
but not to other phenomena (shear, anchorage, bearing, etc.) according to the UK NA to BS 
EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.6.1(P). Therefore, the design strength of concrete in axial and/or 
flexural compression is
f f cd = αcc ck γ =c 0.567fck (3.9a)
otherwise
f f cd = γ ck c = 0.667fck (3.9b)
In passing, it is interesting to note that the use of αcc=0.85 brings it into line with the design 
strength of 0.45 fcu in BS 8110-1 (BS 8110-1 1997), e.g. for grade C40/50 concrete fcd to EC2 
is 0.567×40=22.7 N/mm2 and to BS8110 is 0.45×50=22.5 N/mm2.
The design strength of rebars and prestressing tendons is
f f yd = γ yk s = 0.87fyk (3.10a)
f f pd = γ pk s = 0.87fpk (3.10b)
3.3 LOAD CASES AND ARRANGEMENTS
3.3.1 Ultimate and service loads for cantilevers 
and continuous spans
The purpose of load arrangements is to arrange the unfavourable (maximum) and favour￾able (minimum) loads on different parts of a structure in order to establish critical design 
conditions at all sections. These include bending moments, shear forces, support reac￾tions, and deflections (although this will be the same arrangement as for moments). In 
this book, this applies to cantilever and continuous beams and slabs, rather than 2-D 
frames.
Guidance on load arrangements is given in the UK NA to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 5.1.3 
1(P). Accepting that the prestressing action γp P is present in all spans, the following 
ultimate load arrangements should be considered, as summarised in Figure 3.4. The ser￾viceability load arrangements are the same without the γ factors. The load arrangements 
commonly known as ‘max-max-max’, ‘max-min-max’, ‘min-max-min’, ‘max-max-min’, 
etc. are for stage 2 imposed dead and live loads after the prestressed slab has been posi￾tioned in stage 1. Stage 2 imposed dead loads include finishes, services, ceilings, etc. but 
do not include structural toppings. The authors have added load combination (c) as this Basis for the design of prestressed concrete elements 83
Figure 3.4 Load arrangements for self-weight (stage 1) and imposed dead and live loads (stage 2) in continu￾ous spans are necessary to establish maximum bending moments and shear forces.84 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
gives a slightly greater maximum hogging moment at that support between the maxi￾mum loaded spans (see the worked Example 13.7 for three-span continuous floor slab).
a. all spans carrying stage 2 design permanent and variable loads
∑ γ + G,jG Q k j, γ + Q,1 k k .1 ∑ γ Q,i 0 ψ .iQ ,i
b. alternate spans carrying ∑γG,j Gk,j+γQ,1 Qk.1 +∑γQ,i ψ0.i Qk,I with other spans carrying 
the dead load only ∑γG,j Gk,j with the same γG,j used for all spans.
c. any two adjacent spans carrying ∑γG,j Gk,j+γQ,1 Qk.1 +∑γQ,i ψ0.i Qk,I with other spans 
carrying the dead load only ∑γG,j Gk,j. Note if the outer two spans carry the maximum, 
the third and fifth spans are minimum and the fourth span is maximum, and so on.
The terms are given for Exp. 6.10, but they are also applicable to the greater of Exp. 6.10a 
or 6.10b, e.g. if γG,j=1.25 in Exp. 6.10b is used for the maximum load it should also be used 
for the minimum load.
Figure 3.4 shows that for five equal spans, with the ratio of imposed live/dead=1.25, 
the maximum sagging moment +MEd is, as expected, due to alternate spans Case 2, and 
the maximum hogging moment −MEd is at the first interior support due to Case 4. The 
maximum shear force VEd and support reaction FEd are both at the first interior support. 
Surprisingly, Case 1 (all spans loaded) is not critical, although −MEd, VEd and FEd are only 
8%, 1% and 4% lower, respectively. Case 5 is not critical at all, but of course if the spans 
differ, then Case 5 may become critical. If the ratio of imposed live/dead is increased to 2.5, 
the critical locations are the same.
Further simplifications are given for slabs to use the ‘all spans’ arrangement described 
in (a) if
i. in a one-way spanning slab the area of each bay, defined as the full width of the build￾ing bounded on the other sides by lines of supports, is at least 30m2
ii. the ratio Qk/Gk ≤1.25
iii. Qk ≤5 kN/m2, excluding partitions
It is not common for stage 2 loads to satisfy (ii) for office loading, e.g. Qk =5 kN/m2, Gk ≈2 to 
3 kN/m2, except for residential loading where Qk =1.5 kN/m2, Gk ≈2 kN/m2. If this option 
is used 20% moment redistribution is allowed at internal supports, excluding cantilevers.
At first sight, this UK National Annex option (it is not in BS EN 1992-1-1) appears to be 
at odds with common sense for two-stage precast/prestressed floor slabs, in that
• alternate span arrangement is not used to establish the maximum sagging moments, or 
the two adjacent spans to establish the maximum hogging moment at supports
• why it is only applicable for a floor bay area>30m2, which is not a particularly large 
area, e.g. 8m span×4 no. 1.2m wide units
• it is applicable for relatively low live loads Qk ≤1.25 Gk,stage2
However, consider stage 2 imposed loads as Gk =2 kN/m2 and Qk =2.5 kN/m2, using Exp. 
6.10b (γG =1.25, γQ =1.5) for the ultimate loads, in five continuous spans of 6.0m between 
centres of supports, the two arrangements (a) and (b) give reasonably close ratios of 0.97 
and 0.94, particularly for the exterior span that has the critical bending moment, to within 
3% of each other, as shown in Table 3.4a. This arrangement has a ratio Qk/Gk =1.25. For 
residential loading, if Qk/Gk =0.75 the ratios are 0.99 and 0.98. If Exp 6.10 is used (γG =1.35 Basis for the design of prestressed concrete elements 85
with Qk/Gk =1.25) the moments are around 5% greater but ratios are almost the same as for 
Exp. 6.10b, i.e. 0.97 and 0.95.
For service loads, there is no moment redistribution. Using elastic moments, the results for 
stage 2 loads of Gk =2.0 kN/m2 and Qk =2.5 kN/m2 are given in Table 3.4a. There are differ￾ences of up to 16% using load arrangements (a, without redistribution) and (b). Clearly, ‘all 
spans’ cannot be used to establish service moments; alternate spans should be used with γ=1.
Regarding ultimate negative moments at the first interior support, the two options are 
(a) and (c) for stage 2 loads alone (there are no stage 1 moments at supports). Following 
the same example as above the results are given in Table 3.4b. The critical location is at the 
first interior support. These results show that the ‘all spans’ option (a) does not establish the 
obviously greater support negative moment obtained from the ‘two-external-span’ (max￾max-min-max-min) option (c). However, there is no reason why load arrangement (c) can￾not also benefit from 20% redistribution, such that MEd =0.8×−25.6=−20.5 kNm/m width, 
just 8% less than arrangement (a). Designers will often apply 20% moment redistribution at 
supports, whichever load arrangement is used.
Furthermore, where a beam or slab is continuous over a support that offers no resistance 
to rotation, BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 5.3.2.2 (4) allows a reduction in the design ultimate 
support moment at the cusp of the support according to Exp. 5.9 of
∆ = M F Ed Ed,supt / 8 (3.11)
where
FEd,sup =the design ultimate support reaction
t=width of the support, such as the width of the top of a beam, typically 300–600mm, 
or wall

This should not be carried out before end reactions, shear forces and the span moments are 
calculated, but at the end of the analysis.
Collecting data from load arrangements (b) and (c) Figure 3.5 shows the bending moment 
envelope in a five-span continuous slab for the maximum moments due to stage 2 loads 
(solid line) and the total moment (dashed line) including the stage 1 moment due to the self￾weight of the slab. The left half of the diagram includes for 20% moment redistribution of 
stage 2 moments, together with the reduction ∆MEd based on a beam width t=400mm. The 
right half of the diagram is for the elastic moments.
Figure 3.5 shows that the effect of 20% moment redistribution at the supports from load 
combination (c), i.e. support moments reduced by 20% with a consequential increase in 
span moments, hardly makes any difference in the outer spans because load combination 
(b) is dominant. The positive moments before and after redistribution are 33.4 and 34.9 
kNm, 4% more. The corresponding moments in the interior spans are 28.8 and 31.3 kNm, 
8% more. For this reason, and the explanation about moment redistribution for the positive 
sagging moments in psc elements given in Section 13.5.3.2, redistribution is not carried out 
in psc elements.
3.3.2 Service loads for deflections of spans with 
cantilevers and continuous spans
The purpose of load arrangements is to arrange the unfavourable (maximum) and favour￾able (minimum) loads on different parts of a structure in order to establish maximum deflec￾tions in the main span of slabs with cantilevers, and in continuous spans. The prestressing 
action P plays a major role, due to the instantaneous upward camber caused by eccentric 
prestress, and the long-term viscoelastic camber due to creep, where, for hollow core slabs,

the creep factor from transfer at 1day to installation (at say 28days) is ψ1 =0.72 and after 
installation is ψ28 =1.20 (see Section 11.2.1).
The load arrangements for both slabs with cantilevers and continuous spans, commonly 
known as ‘max-min-max’, are for stage 2 imposed dead and live loads after the prestressed 
slab has been positioned in stage 1.
Alternate spans carry ∑Gk,j+P+∑ψ2 Qk,j with other spans carrying the dead load only 
∑Gk,j+P.
In slabs with a cantilever(s), the prestressing effect causes upward camber
δ1 = −P t( ) z Lcp (1+ ψ) / 8E I cm c co 2 , (3.12)
where
P(t)=prestressing force at the time (t) at which deflections are calculated
zcp =eccentricity from the centroid of the concrete section to the centroid of the force
L=effective span of the main span
ψ=creep factor at time t
Ecm =Young’s modulus of concrete at 28days, or at time t<28days
Ic,co =compound second moment of area of the section (including transformed area of 
tendons). See Section 6.2.4 for the calculation of Ic,co.
The camber has a major effect on the deflection of the cantilever itself due to the end rota￾tion as
θ = + P t( ) z Lcp (1 ψ) / 2E I cm c c, o (3.13)
If the length of the cantilever is Lʹ the downward deflection at the end of the cantilever due 
to rigid body rotation is
δ = +θ ′ L (3.14)
The final deflections are due to the addition of those due to gravity loads ∑Gk,j+∑ψ2 Qk,j or 
∑Gk,j as given above.
For a typical hollow core slab, say 150 mm deep × span of 6.0 m, subjected to 
Gk = 2.6 + 2 = 4.6 kN/m2 and Qk = 5 kN/m2 (on both main and cantilever spans) the long￾term deflection (with ψ2 = 0.3 for office loading) of the simply supported slab alone is 
δ = 4.5 mm. The long-term upward camber for this example is δ1 = −27.2 mm, virtually 
eliminating the effects of gravity loads. If the slab includes a cantilever of length Lʹ = 1.0 m, 
the deflection reduces to δ = 3.1 mm. The limiting deflection is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, 
clause 7.4.1 (4) as L/250 = 24.0 mm.
Similarly, the so-called ‘active’ deflection (sometimes called ‘movement’ δ2) after con￾struction of finishes and partitions, is the greater of (i) ψ28 times the dead loads+∑(1+ψ28) 
ψ2 Qk,j+visco-elastic increase in camber after construction, or (ii) ∑(1+ψ28) ψ2 Qk,j alone. 
This is usually greater than the final long-term deflection because they do not include the 
instantaneous camber. In the same example δ2 =7.3 and 6.5mm without and with the 
cantilever. The limiting active deflection is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.4.1 (5) as 
L/500=12.0mm, although other limits such as L/350 are used for non-brittle finishes or 
ceilings. This example shows that deflections in slabs containing cantilevers are not usually 
critical, at the expense of limiting tension at serviceability, at least up to span/depth ratios of 
around 40 (at which point the natural frequency fn <4Hz may be critical).88 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
In continuous spans, the end moments due to the continuity of adjacent spans subjected to 
stage 2 dead loads considerably reduce main span deflections. For example, in the example 
for a five span×6.0m continuous slab, the simply supported active deflection of one span 
alone (L=5.7m) when subjected to Gk =4.6 kN/m2 and Qk =ψ2 Qk =0.3×5=1.5 kN/m2 is 
δ2 =5.1mm. The final stage 2 end moments due to dead and live loads at the first support are 
MG =−9.1 kNm and MQ =–3.4 kNm per 1.2m wide floor unit, respectively (where Gk =2 kN/
m2 and ψ2 Qk =1.5 kN/m2). In this case the less favourable negative deflection is due to the 
live load alone δ2 =−M L2 (1+ψ)/16 Ecm Ic,co =−1.4mm giving a net active deflection δ2 =3.7 
mm<limit of span/500=12.0mm. This example also shows that deflections in continuous 
slabs are not usually critical, at the expense of limiting tension at serviceability, up to span/
depth ratios of around 65, much greater than is possible to manufacture.

Pretensioning and casting methods
4.1 PRETENSIONING AND CASTING METHODS
There are two commonly used methods to manufacture precast prestressed concrete ele￾ments (i) wet-cast into moulds for beams, wall panels and floor slabs and (ii) semi-dry slip￾forming and extrusion of floor slabs, wall panels, T-beams (for beam and block flooring) 
and ground beams. Figure 4.1 shows a prestressed beam mould with the strand tensioned 
and ready for the concrete to be poured, these units are classified as wet-cast. Figure 4.2 
shows steel moulds for casting prestressed T beams for beam and block flooring, 12 abreast 
and typically 80m long. Figure 4.3 shows a wet-cast floor slab during the production pro￾cess. The wet-cast concrete has been poured into the steel mould and the top surface is 
being levelled off and floated. Additional details regarding wet-cast production are given in 
Section 4.2.3.

The prestressing forces need to be anchored to a bulkhead capable of dealing with the 
very high tension loading, but the moulds themselves can be constructed from steel, timber, 
cardboard, and in some cases, the base of the mould is formed with concrete.
Long line production uses a semi-dry mix, and the methods are often classified as dry￾cast. This method is suitable for linear products such as slabs, walls and T beams. Figure 4.4 
shows the long beds that are used to cast the product in a prestressed hcu factory. Additional 
details on dry-cast production are given in Section 4.2.1.
In precast prestressed production, there are two widely used methods of applying tension 
to the steel strands before casting the concrete. These will be described in the following two 
sections.
4.1.1 Method 1 – individual strand tensioning
The first method for pretensioning is the use of hand-operated hydraulic stressing jacks 
where each strand is tensioned individually to the required load, as shown in Figure 4.5. 
The strands are anchored through a bulk head at each end, one end being the jacking point.
The stressing jack can be connected to a calibrated control unit with a digital display to 
show the load applied to the strand during pretensioning. Alternatively, the strand is lightly 
tensioned to engage the barrel and wedges, a line is marked on the strand close to the end 
at the jacking point and the strand is then extended by a calculated length to provide the 
desired pretension force. Figure 4.5 shows a hydraulic stressing jack in use tensioning indi￾vidual strands for hollow core unit (hcu) production. This jack is connected to a calibrated 
unit, so the operator applies the required tension to each strand by reading off the digital 
display. The display is mounted out of shot behind the hydraulic jack. The tension required 
for each strand type used in design is specified for the production bed. The prestressed 
Figure 4.4 Prestressed hollow core production facility.92 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
hollow core factory shown has 13 production beds of lengths up to 227m, each bed can be 
set up with a bespoke strand pattern using a variety of quantities and diameters of wire and/
or strand. Slabs and walls of different thicknesses can be manufactured on each bed.
Figure 4.6 shows the barrel and wedge connectors that anchor each individual strand 
at the bulkhead during pretensioning. These are critical safety features in prestressed pro￾duction, and they are used widely in virtually every factory that manufactures prestressed 
concrete elements.
4.1.2 Method 2 – simultaneous strand tensioning
The second method for pretensioning uses a sliding bulkhead and hydraulic rams, where all 
of the strands are anchored through the bulkhead and the rams are extended to tension all 
strands simultaneously.
The required extension of the rams is calculated, and the subsequent movement of the 
sliding bulkhead applies the desired pretension force to the strands. For slabs and wall pan￾els, typical sliding bulkhead and ram prestressing systems can operate at total pretension 
forces of up to 325 tonnes. It is also possible to use stressing jacks on individual stands in 
conjunction with a sliding bulkhead.
In both of the pretensioning methods, care must be taken not to overload the capacity of 
the bulkhead or casting bed when calculating ram extensions and/or using stressing jacks.
The bulkhead shown at the end of the prestressed concrete mould in Figure 4.7 has holes 
drilled through it to provide the capacity to receive 2 rows of 24 no. 9.3mm diameter strand, 
with each strand stressed to an average of 60 kN giving a total pretension force of 2880 kN 
or approximately 294 tonnes. This bed, bulkhead and rams are rated to carry a total of load 
up to 300 tonnes. The bed is 85m long, can cast units at a maximum width of 2400mm and 
is used to produce solid prestressed slabs and wall panels.
Figure 4.5 Hydraulic stressing jack.Pretensioning and casting methods 93
Figure 4.6 Strand anchored through fixed bulkhead using barrel and wedges.
Figure 4.7 Sliding bulkhead at end of the casting bed.
The bulkhead is moved using hydraulic rams positioned at the outer left and right sides 
of the mould. The required load is applied by calculating the extension required in the 
strand based on the overall length of the mould. At the opposite end of the mould, there 
is a fixed bulkhead with the same hole arrangement through it. Figures 4.8 and 4.9 show 94 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

one of the hydraulic rams and the steel frame structure that it is mounted within on the 
side of the mould.
In theory, any length of mould is possible – when using rams the limit for mould length is 
governed by the maximum extension of the hydraulic rams and the movement of the sliding 
bulkhead as this will limit the amount of prestress that can be applied. Of course, factory 
size and production requirements also influence the length of mould required, and a number 
of mould manufacturers provide a modular system to allow variance in mould length to suit 
the changing requirements of production.
4.1.3 Pretensioning strand based on extension
The following example shows how to calculate the extension required to pretension the steel 
strand or wire in relation to the length of the mould or bed used for production.
The amount of prestress in the concrete is calculated for the slab, wall, beam or other 
unit that is being designed. The strand pattern necessary to provide the required prestress 
is defined based on a percentage of the strands breaking load, known as the characteristic 
ultimate tensile strength fpk (see Section 5.1.1 and Table 5.8), and this is generally restricted 
to a maximum of 70%. Some manufacturers of T beams pretension 5mm and 7mm diam￾eter wires to 75% fpk.
For example, a 1.2m wide slab requires 10 no. 9.3mm diameter strands stressed to give a 
total prestress force of 620 kN, therefore 62kN per strand. The mould is 85m long.
Young’s modulus=stress/strain
Stress=Load in strand (kN)/strand area (mm2)
Strain=extension of strand/mould length
Young’s modulus of strand Ep =195000 N/mm2
Area of 9.3mm diameter, 7 wire strand Ap =52mm2
Yield strength fpk =1860 N/mm2
Length of mould L=85000mm
Pretension required per strand Fp =62 kN
Strand breaking load Fpk =Ap fpk =96.7 kN
Percentage of tension capacity η=Fp/Fpk =64%<70% OK
Extension required=[(Fp/Ap)/Ep] L=520mm
Note that the type of stressing jack used with the strand has an influence on the amount of 
extension and needs to be considered. A keyed jack prevents the strand from rotating, so it 
behaves as a solid wire. If a jack with no key is used the strand can rotate during stressing 
which will result in up to 5% greater extensions being required.
4.1.4 Anchorage of strand and wire during pretensioning
In both of the methods described above, the strands are restrained at the fixed or sliding 
bulkhead using barrel and wedge anchors. Figure 4.10. The safe anchorage of pretensioned 
steel strand is a very important consideration in the manufacturing process, and subse￾quently, strict control procedures must be adhered to when cleaning, inspecting and using 
barrel and wedge anchors. These two components are used to grip and hold the strand 
during and after tensioning. The barrel is fitted over the strand and has a tapered internal 
profile to receive the wedge. The wedge is fitted over the strand and has an external taper in 
the same profile as the barrel, but internally it has serrations to grip the strand. As the ten￾sion force is applied to the strand, the wedge is drawn into the barrel and compressed due to 96 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
the tapered profile. An increase in tension will increase the grip on the strand and prevent 
slippage as the wedge locks tighter in relation to the applied force. The specific type of bar￾rel and wedge used depends on the type and diameter of the strand or wire being tensioned.
The most common types of strand used in prestressed manufacture in the UK and Ireland 
are the seven wire profile with diameters of 9.3mm, 12.5 and 15.7mm, the most common 
types of wire used are those with diameters 5mm and 7mm. Some European countries 
favour 9.6 and 12.9mm diameter strands. Three wire strand of 8mm diameter is some￾times used in South America. Seven wire strands comprise a central straight wire with six 
outer wires twisted into a spiral (with a pitch of 200mm) to help increase bond stress as 
the cement paste fills the crevices between the outer wires. Hence, the name ‘helical strand’. 
Table 4.1 presents some commercial literature supplied by manufacturers (see also Table 
5.8). Wire is available with a smooth or indented surface profile, the profile affects the bond 
characteristic of the wire and therefore the amount of pretension that can be applied.
4.2 MANUFACTURE OF PRESTRESSED CONCRETE ELEMENTS
The manufacture of prestressed precast units can be categorised into two separate method￾ologies based on the properties of the concrete mix used – the methods are described in the 
industry as dry-cast and wet-cast. The concrete mix type dictates the casting method that 
can be used. A dry mix is used for the production of long line products such as hcu and solid 
planks. A wet mix is used to cast for example solid slabs, walls, beams and lintels.
4.2.1 Dry-cast concrete – S1 slump class
In simple terms, the wetter the concrete, the higher the slump will be. The slump range is 
often associated with water content, but it is more accurately defined as a measurement of 
Figure 4.10 Barrels and wedges.Pretensioning and casting methods 97
the concretes consistence. The workability or consistency of the concrete is given by the 
slump class, an S1 mix is a dry mix with a slump range of 10–40mm, further information 
is given in BS 8500-1:2023.
A long line bed is used where the casting machine moves along the full length of the bed 
and the concrete is delivered from the batching plant into a hopper on the continuously 
moving casting machine. Figure 4.4. The geometry of the unit is governed by the set-up and 
shape of the casting machine, e.g. 200mm depth, 1200mm wide, 11 no. hollow cores in a 
hcu. These are manufactured as one unit the entire length of the bed, typically 120–150m. 
Individual units are then cut from the continuous unit once the concrete has cured suf￾ficiently. There are limitations on what shapes can be cast, essentially a continuous basic 
rectangular profile is formed, and any details such as notches, holes, splays and narrow 
width units need to be formed or cut post-casting. The beds are typically constructed on 
the ground and sheeted with steel. Heating pipework is installed under the beds to aid rapid 
curing so that the precast elements can be removed in as short a time period as possible.

Fp0.1 is the 0.1% proof load, see Section 5.3.1 and Figure 5.22.
Fpk is the characteristic ultimate tensile load.98 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Curing times for hcu vary depending on the geometry of the unit, the type of machine used 
to produce it and the ambient conditions. Typically, 16–20hours are sufficient to achieve 
adequate strength for transfer of prestress to the concrete. Note that there are manufactur￾ers of extrusion machines that suggest workable mixes can be used with their machines 
that will give curing time to adequate transfer strength in under 6hours. Prestressed fac￾tories have testing facilities and cubes are crushed prior to detensioning, concrete strength 
at transfer, fck(t), for typical levels of pretressing is between C25/30 and C30/40. The cast 
units can also be covered by hessian sheeting while on the beds during curing to retain heat 
and assist rapid curing times. The most common bed widths are 1200 and 2400mm. These 
widths fit conveniently onto the trailer of a lorry making for straightforward and efficient 
transportation to site. Lifting pins can be installed during the manufacturing process, and 
slabs can be lifted from the production bed using the cast-in lifting pins or with the use of 
clamps. The main advantage of this form of manufacturing is the efficiency of production 
with minimal waste and low labour costs.
Top wire or strand can be placed in the slabs to assist with handling stresses during the 
lifting and installation of slabs. These may be pretensioned to 70% fpk but, as this may 
reduce the flexural bending strength of the unit, they are often pretensioned to 40% fpk. 
Another feature of using a top strand is that it can be designed to act as the cantilever 
reinforcement in slabs. Also the units can be manufactured with the same strand pattern 
at the top and bottom of the section, for example wall panels that are used as retaining 
walls that will be subjected to loading on both sides. The use of the same strand pattern 
at the top and bottom of the section is not that common in dry-cast manufacture, most 
often units that require this detail as part of the design are manufactured using a wet-cast 
method.
It is possible to manufacture units with pipework cast into the bottom flange in long line 
dry-cast production; this pipework can be used as part of the heating and cooling system for 
the completed building. The height of the hollow core profiles and their position vertically 
on the slab section are adjusted to give a thicker bottom flange that can accommodate the 
pipework during the production process. A hcu has a 35mm bottom flange thickness, but 
a bespoke profile was manufactured as shown in Figure 4.11 where the bottom flange was 
increased to 90mm to accommodate the pipework.
Two main machine types in long line hollow core slab production are slipformers and 
extruders. Slipforming machines first place the concrete to form the bottom flange of the 
slab and then the cores ‘slip’ over the concrete to compact it around the bottom strand and 
form the lower section of the ribs. Concrete is then placed over the cores to form the upper 
section of the ribs and the top flange of the slab. A vibrating plate compacts the rib and top 
flange concrete. Extruder machines use augers or screws to force the concrete through a 
profile former to produce a compacted full-depth section.
Figure 4.11 Hollow core unit cross section containing heating and cooling pipes.Pretensioning and casting methods 99
The choice between slipformer and extrusion machines can be influenced by a number of 
factors. Both types of machines can produce slabs and walls of various profiles and thick￾nesses with the slipfomer machine being the least expensive to purchase. The cost of the 
main components used by each machine also varies, so the profile range that the manufac￾turer wants to produce will have an effect on set-up cost. For example, the cores used to 
form each profile on a slipformer machine are less expensive than the augers used in extru￾sion machines. Operationally, slipformer machines are quick to set up for different slab or 
wall profiles, therefore reducing downtime on the production line. A useful advantage of 
slipformer machines is the relative ease of modifying the cores to create a bespoke slab pro￾file, extruder machines will require a bespoke set of augers if there is a requirement to create 
a modified profile. Maintenance and running costs for extrusion machines are higher than 
for slipformer machines due to the cost associated with the components. Increased opera￾tional costs for extrusion machines are caused by wear on the augers due to the coarse dry 
mix used to produce hcu. There are also positive points associated with extrusion machines; 
the finish of hcu is generally much more aesthetically pleasing than that of a slipformed ele￾ment. Extruded elements are typically more dimensionally accurate with a consistent uni￾form compaction of the concrete throughout the full depth of the section. The development 
of hydraulic extrusion machines has resolved issues such as wear on the augers and slow 
machine change over to different slab or wall profiles, the different extrusion methods used 
in these machines has helped to reduce the operational costs.
Both types of machine run continuously along the bed on side rails and are fitted with 
a hopper to receive concrete from the batching plant. Once the concrete has reached the 
required strength, the strands are detensioned by cutting or relaxing the bulkhead and the 
prestress is ‘transferred’ into the concrete. This transfer of stress occurs as each individual 
unit is cut in turn from the continuous unit that has been cast on the long line bed.
The key equipment that makes up a prestressed dry-casting factory is
1. Long line heated steel sheeted beds
2. Batching plant and concrete delivery system
3. Rail-mounted casting machine – slipformer or extruder
4. Rail-mounted bed cleaning and oiling machine
5. Stressing jacks or rams and fixing bulkheads at each end of the bed
6. Rail-mounted concrete saws
7. Vacuum aspirator
8. Bed plotter
9. Crane for transferring precast units to trailers
The first step in the process for the manufacture of prestressed long line units is to prepare 
the bed. The bed is cleaned with a rotating brush to remove any residue or debris from the 
previous production run, and a rubber blade follows the brush sliding over the surface to 
remove water from the bed. Release oil is then applied using rear-mounted spray nozzles to 
evenly coat the bed. The same machine is used to pull the strands down the bed ready for 
anchoring and pretensioning. Figure 4.12 shows a typical rail-mounted machine used to 
prepare the casting bed.
The unit depth and section profile required are set up in the casting machine and once the 
strand has been pretensioned the casting machine is craned into position on the rails. Figure 
4.13 shows an 11-core cassette for a slipforming machine; various shapes, sizes and numbers 
of cores are used to create the profiles that are available from the different manufacturers 
of the casting machines. In extrusion machines, the slipformers shown in Figure 4.13 are 
replaced by rotating augers and circular core formers connected to the ends of the augers, 100 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

as shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Adjacent augers rotate in opposite directions to increase 
the compaction of concrete, which has a greater density and quality of finish compared with 
slipformers.Pretensioning and casting methods 101

Figure 4.15 Extrusion machine core formers, note that the machine is raised up and supported on a steel frame.102 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Solid slabs and walls can also be manufactured using long line casting machines. The 
concrete is delivered to the hopper on the casting machine as it moves continuously along 
the bed, as shown in Figure 4.16.
Once the production bed has been cast, or while it is being cast, a laser-guided rail￾mounted plotter moves along the bed and marks up details on the surface of the concrete, 
as shown in Figure 4.17. This includes lines to indicate the cutting position for slab length, 
narrow width cuts, splayed ends, holes, notches, open cores, lifting pin positions, solid 
ends, chamfered ends and any other details that are required on the slab. Solid ends are 
formed by infilling the cores at the end of the slab by the specified distance required on the 
project. The infill concrete is typically added manually while the slabs are on the produc￾tion bed. Chamfered ends are formed in the uncured concrete while the slabs are on the 
production bed; this is done using either an angled steel plate mounted on a machine or 
manually. The dimensions for the chamfer can be a bespoke arrangement if agreed upon 
with the precast manufacturer, but they are typically a reduction of approx. 75 mm over 
a length of 250 mm.
An example of the lines drawn by the plotter can be seen in Figure 4.18. The cut line 
for the slab length can be seen running across the width of the slab, this is also a nar￾row width slab so a longitudinal line is visible. The position of the cast in lifting pins 
is marked, although the marks are not visible as the vacuum aspirator has removed the 
top flange concrete from four locations and is removing it at the fifth one. The spherical 
head lifting pins are installed manually into the slabs by operatives following a strictly 
controlled process to ensure adequate anchorage within the concrete. These pins can be 
used to lift the slabs off the production bed, handle them in the stockyard and also fit the 
slabs on site. Figure 4.19 shows the finished lifting pin installation in a hcu; typically 4 
no. pins are installed in a standard width unit at approximately one metre from the end 
of the unit.

Figure 4.19 Lifting pins installed in hollow core unit.
Holes and notches are formed in the slabs or walls after casting using a vacuum aspirator 
to remove the concrete. Any strand that is exposed is burnt out with a gas torch, for large 
openings the strand is often left intact and removed on site once the unit is installed. This 
helps prevent cracking at the opening during handling and transportation. Typically, open￾ings with a length and width between 150 and 300mm can be formed in the factory during 
production. See Figures 7.14–7.17. Larger openings up to 400mm in size are normally cored 
on site, but it is important to ensure that all holes are accounted for in the design. The slab 
drawings for a project must show all hole sizes and positions that will affect the structural 
performance of the slab. For small holes, it is normal practice to agree on a safe drilling 
zone within the slab that ensures no strands are cut or damaged and the effect on the slab’s 
performance is negligible.
Top open cores (often known as slots) are a very common detail in hcus. These are used to 
locate horizontal tie reinforcement bars on site that form part of the robustness method in 
precast construction. Another purpose is to allow the placement of transverse reinforcement 
required in composite steel beam design. The top flange of the hcu is removed during pro￾duction, the two outside cores are not usually opened as the web will be vulnerable to dam￾age. It is possible to open every other core on a unit, for example an 11 core unit could have 
5 cores opened making it particularly well suited for use in composite steel beam design. A 6 
core unit could have 2 cores opened as shown in Figure 4.20. If required, additional adjacent 
cores could be cut on site although this is rarely required.
The chamfered end detail is useful when installing precast slabs on the bottom flange of 
steel beams. Figure 4.21 shows the chamfered end slab installed on site; in this case, the 
200mm depth slab bears onto the bottom flange of a structural steelwork 203×203mm 
serial size Universal column. The beam can have holes drilled through its web to allow Pretensioning and casting methods 105

horizontal reinforcement bars to pass through the beam and provide the necessary robust￾ness ties. The bars are positioned in the open cores of the slabs, which are co-ordinated 
with the steel beam fabrication and hole positions. This detail can avoid the requirement for 
a steel plate to be welded to the bottom of the beam. The slab length is detailed to ensure 
adequate bearing can be achieved, and the slab can be fitted into position between two 
beams if required.
With all holes, notches, top opened cores, chamfers, etc. formed according to the lines 
made by the plotter, the full length casting is cut to the lengths required by shop drawings. 
Figure 4.22 shows a rail-mounted transverse saw used to cut units to length on the produc￾tion bed. The accuracy of the length of individual units is typically ±25mm, but this toler￾ance can be reduced subject to agreement with the manufacturer. Occasionally, there are 
issues when saw cutting hcu to length on the production bed, in units manufactured with a 
high level of pretension the camber induced in the slab during the cutting process can cause 
the saw blade to become jammed. This can cause cracking to occur in the slab as well as 
being a potential health and safety risk. To prevent this problem from occurring, weight 
packs can be loaded onto the slabs during cutting. This reduces the camber during the cut￾ting process and prevents the top flanges of the slab from pinching together to jam the saw.
In situations where the supporting structure of beams or walls is not on a rectangular 
grid, the end of the unit is cut at an angle. Known as splayed end units, as shown in Figure 
4.23. The limitation in the angle of the cut is between 30° and 90° to the longitudinal axis 
of the unit.
4.2.2 Narrow width units in long line dry-cast production
There are limitations on the width of units that can be cut from the standard width hcu. 
Non-standard widths are commonly termed ‘rip units’ by precast manufacturers. They can 
be cut while the slab is on the production bed, as shown in Figure 4.24 before the concrete 
Figure 4.22 Rail-mounted saw used to cut slabs to length on the production bed.Pretensioning and casting methods 107

Figure 4.24 Rail-mounted saw cutting rip units on the production bed.
has cured or afterwards in the stockyard once cured prior to delivery to site. The core profile 
dictates what rip unit width can be provided. Figure 4.25 shows the typical widths available 
for 11 core and 6 core slab profiles. The limitation for solid planks is the rip line should not 
be closer than 1.5 × the diameter of the pretensioned strand or wire when the centre-to￾centre distance of adjacent strands is greater than 3 × the strand diameter. This limitation 
also applies to hcu. Clause 4.3.1.2.2 of BS EN 1168 gives further details regarding minimum 
cover dependent on spacing and strand diameter. If the minimum cover requirements are not 
satisfied, the strand can be discounted when assessing the capacity of the slab at the design 
stage to ensure there are no issues.108 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Figure 4.25 Permissible cutting positions for rip units for a standard width hollow core unit.
Rip units should be used such that waste is minimised. It is important to remember that 
when a rip is specified, a corresponding rip of the same length is produced on the other side 
of the bed, e.g. for a standard 1200mm width unit if a 700mm rip is detailed a 500mm rip 
is left on the other side of the bed. It follows that if a number of 700mm rips are required 
on a particular contract, a number of 500mm rips are potentially wasted unless they can be 
utilised elsewhere or on another project.
Finally, the units are lifted from the casting bed using clamps, as shown in Figure 4.26. 
The sideways pressure exerted on the outer web is another reason why top opened cores are 
not formed in the external cores.

4.2.3 Wet-cast concrete – S3 to S4 slump class
An S3 slump class is a wet mix with high flowability and a slump range of 100–150mm, S4 
is a wet mix with very high flowability and has a high slump range of 160–210mm, further 
information is given in BS 8500-1:2023.
The more common and familiar wet-cast mix is used for casting into moulds. The moulds 
are constructed to retain the wet concrete and form the geometry of the unit. Greater flex￾ibility of geometry is possible with this method although some limitations exist due to the 
practicalities of stressing the strand in a straight line between bulk heads. Slabs (solid and 
voided), walls, T beams (for beam & block flooring), main beams, inverted T-beams and 
lintels are common prestressed products manufactured using a wet mix. The strands are 
fixed and tensioned along the length of the bed or mould. Holes and notches can be formed 
during casting by adding formwork, or frequently polystyrene block-outs (held in place 
against buoyancy). Cast in lifting anchors, sockets, channels, etc. can also be cast in using 
this method for production. The units can be cast as one long unit similar to the dry mix 
method but it is more common for stop ends to be used to cast the units to the desired length. 
The strand is cut or burnt out between stop ends once the concrete has cured. Beds can be 
vibrated and/or concrete pokered to ensure satisfactory compaction and flow throughout 
the mould extents. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) can be used in the production of precast 
elements. This is a flowing concrete mix that does not require the use of vibration to ensure 
compaction and release of air. The slump flow rate is typically 750mm. The mix contains 
superplasticisers, stabilisers and a high binder content. The costs associated with the mate￾rials used in the mix can be offset by the reduction in labour for vibration/pokering and 
finshing works.
The moulds can be constructed at ground level, in the same manner as the dry mix long 
line method, or constructed at a raised level from steel frames that are sheeted and installed 110 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

into factories at the length required, as shown in Figure 4.27. This gives the advantage of 
being able to disassemble and move the casting beds to different factories or sites.
Steel is typically used to form stop ends, as shown in Figures 4.28 and 4.29. Once the con￾crete has reached the required strength, the strands are cut at each stop end, which transfers 
the pretensioning force into the concrete sections.
Box-outs for holes and notches are typically formed using timber. Steel formers are used 
for these details only if there is very high repetition due to the cost of this type of formwork. 
The use of mixes with a relatively high slump aids the concrete flow around box outs and 
other details with minimal vibration required.
Narrow width slabs and walls can be formed by placing formwork to suit, but it should 
be noted that this can be wasteful as the strand pattern will run the full length and width 
of the bed or mould.
Wet-cast manufacturers can also easily accommodate additional standard reinforcement 
bars if required, such as shear stirrups, and bars close to supports. The bars can be tied in 
and set in the mould with the strand prior to casting the concrete.
A feature of wet-cast production that is not practical in dry-cast production is the capability 
to debond (or less frequently to deflect) a number of strands at the ends of the units by sheath￾ing them with polymer pipe for the required length, as shown in Figure 4.30. Debonding deals 
with the high stresses at the transfer of prestress into the concrete and prevents splitting failure 
into units that have a relatively concentrated strand pattern within the section. This is com￾mon practice in the design and manufacture of prestressed double-tee floor units and main 
beams. The length of the debonding ensures all of the strand will have full anchorage for the 
extent required to provide the necessary moment capacity and deflection and crack control. 
Any issues caused by reduction in section capacity due to debonding are normally resolved by 
fixing standard reinforcement in the affected zones.Pretensioning and casting methods 111

Cantilevered units
Cantilevers are unsupported ends of units, such as the slab examples shown in Figure 
4.31. The negative hogging moment over the support creates stress at the top of the con￾crete section. To deal with this stress some form of reinforcement is required at the top of 
the units.
Prestressed units can be designed and manufactured with reinforcement on the top sur￾face using two common methods.Pretensioning and casting methods 113
Figure 4.31 Cantilevered prestressed hollow core slabs.
Figure 4.32 Cantilever reinforcement bars added to dry-cast hollow core units during manufacture.
The first method is specifically used for dry-cast hcu. In this method, cores are manually 
opened in the factory immediately following casting, and reinforcement bars are placed in 
the opened cores and concreted into place. See Figure 4.32 showing the arrangement. An 
11-core hcu is very well suited to this method as it allows reinforcing bars to be placed at 
200mm centres in 5 no. opened cores. The reinforcing bars need to extend into the back￾span for the distance required to deal with the hogging moment, usually at least 2 × the 114 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
cantilever but must be checked during design. This method is used if only a small number 
of units are required and for relatively short cantilevers typically up to 1200mm long for 
150–200mm deep units. A major drawback of this method is the increase in self-weight due 
to the infilling of the cores.
If a large number of cantilever units are required and the cantilever span is greater than 
about 1200 mm, the units are designed and manufactured with the top strand. This is 
much more economical for hcu as no manual work is required and the design is more effi￾cient due to the self-weight of the unit being unaffected. The strand pattern in the slab is 
designed for the cantilever moment and the back-span sagging moment, shear and deflec￾tion. The strands required in the top and bottom flanges of the unit are tensioned to the 
required prestressing forces prior to casting the concrete. This method is suitable for dry￾cast and wet-cast production. Figure 4.31 shows a 6-core prestressed cantilever hollow 
core slab, which was dry-cast using a slipforming machine. The effective cantilever span is 
3.45 m, using a bespoke 285 mm depth unit. Refer to Chapter 13 for further information 
on cantilever slabs.DOI: 10.1201/9781003319450-5 115

5.1 MATERIAL PROPERTIES FOR PRESTRESSED 
CONCRETE ELEMENTS
5.1.1 Introduction to concrete and tendons 
used in prestressed concrete
Prestressed concrete (psc) is high-strength concrete, inherently so because of the compressive 
strength required at ‘transfer’, the point of detensioning the tendons when the pretensioning 
force in transferred to the concrete by the action of bond. It is also high-performance con￾crete in terms of its resistance to the passage of moisture, low porosity and surface hardness 
in the soffit and sides of elements owing to the use of steel moulds or timber moulds with 
medium density overlay, such as WISA®-Form.
High strength is particularly important near to the ends of members where there is a 
rapid increase in stress transfer in the transmission zone. Compressive strength is usually 
obtained from 100mm cubes (rather than 150×300mm long cylinders) for convenience, 
where the cube strength from three to six samples fck,cube(t) is obtained daily, depending 
on the volume of production. Note that (t) refers to time, less than 28days, rather than to 
transfer. Typically, at an age of 20hours, fcm,cube=35–45 N/mm2 for corresponding 28days 
design cylinder strengths of fck =40–55 N/mm2 (or fck,cube=50–65 N/mm2). In some product 
standards, such as BS EN 15037-1 ((BS EN 15037-1, 2008) for beam and block flooring, the 
first specimen compressive strength prior to release fc1 should be 5 N/mm2 greater than the 
required, called fmin,p; otherwise, a waiting period is required until the second fc2 ≥fmin,p +5, 
and so on. The margin of 5 N/mm2 represents the anticipated standard deviation (sd) when 
testing several specimens, viz. fck(t)=fmin,p -1.64 sd. If cubes are used fck,cube(t) is converted to 
fck(t) using the range of values given in BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.1 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004). 
For the range of strengths used in psc elements, the conversion of cube to cylinder strength 
is approximately fck/fck,cube=0.83 for higher strengths (fck >45); otherwise, it is 0.78–0.80. 
Although BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.1 states that the characteristic value fck =mean strength 
fcm −8 N/mm2, this is not respected for the transfer strength.
The behaviour of psc elements, throughout their full life cycle, depends on more than just 
the compressive strength of the concrete. It is surprising how much of the deformation char￾acteristics of psc slabs and beams, as well as reinforced concrete columns and walls, etc., rely 
on the humble ‘cube strength’. Only in research (and by a manufacturer when a new product 
is introduced, e.g. high strength or self-compacting concrete) is the true uni-axial compres￾sive cylinder strength, tensile strength, bond strength, splitting strength, Young’s modulus 
of elasticity, shrinkage, creep coefficient, flow, and so on, truly measured. In design, the 
ultimate strength of elements in bending, compression, tension, shear and torsion, as well as 
checks for serviceability stresses, short-term and time-dependent long-term deflections and 116 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
crack widths, fatigue, etc., are all required. The long-term effects are particularly important 
to psc where losses of prestress, due to elastic shortening, creep and shrinkage, (as well as 
relaxation of the steel tendons, see below) are required to predict the stresses, deflections 
and cracking at the serviceability limit state.
Similarly, the ultimate and service strength of steel reinforcement and pretensioned ten￾dons (wires, strands and bars), as well as their modulus of elasticity, relaxation of preten￾sioning force, ductility and fatigue behaviour, together with compatibility of strains when 
bonded to concrete, are all required to determine the structural behaviour of psc. Relaxation 
of tendons is quoted at 1000hours after tensioning at a mean temperature of 20°C as ρ1000. 
Here the characteristic ultimate tensile strength fpk is the basis for specifications and design, 
although BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.3.2 (1) states tendons should be classified according to 
the characteristic 0.1% proof stress in axial tension fp0.1k and the ratio of fpk/fp0.1k, together 
with the elongation strain at maximum load εuk. Values quoted in BS EN 1992-1-1 give fpk/
fp0.1k =1.1, εuk =0.0222 and ρ1000 =2.5% for the vast majority of tendons used in elements in 
buildings. Again only in research are these strengths, modulus of elasticity, relaxation and 
ductility, etc. fully measured.
Table 5.1 lists typical mean concrete strengths fcm (usually obtained from 2 or 3 cubes) for 
precast production at 20hours (detensioning prestress or stripping moulds), 7 and 28days, 
and the characteristic values for cement cubes fcu according to BS EN 197 Part 1 (BS EN 197-
1, 2011). The table shows that, even allowing for fcu =fcm −4 N/mm2, concrete at 20hours 
just about exceeds the requirements for cement strength at 2days.
5.1.2 Strength and quality control of concrete
Using materials that have passed strict quality control procedures, rapid hardening cement 
type CEM I class 42.5R or 52.5R according to BS EN 197 Part 1 (BS EN 197-1, 2011) is 
mixed with excellent quality aggregates of known source and purity, in computer-controlled 
batching and mixing plant, to produce concrete of specified workability and strength. Even 
the introduction of small quantities of uncontaminated recycled concrete, usually from the 
factory’s own waste production, superplasticisers and pozzolanic materials (such as pul￾verised fuel ash) has not reduced this standard. To quote standard deviations of less than 2 
N/mm2 on concrete of 28days compressive cube strength of between fck,cube=50–65 N/mm2
would not be an exaggeration. Figure 5.1 shows variations in the mean mx and standard 
deviation sx for the production of prestressed hollow core floor units (hcu) where the target 
characteristic cube strength was 60 N/mm2. The author has chosen to show mx and sx based 
on samples taken from the last 6 days’ production; in fact, the trends are not very different 
based on the last 8 or 10 days’ production. The mean characteristic strength is fck =60.1 N/
mm2, and the average sx =3.1 N/mm2.

Table 5.2 lists typical characteristic strength fck at 28days, mean concrete strengths fcm,cube
at 20hours transfer, design strength for compression and bending ηfcd, design mean tensile 
strength fctm, and modulli of elasticity Ecm at 28days and at transfer. The factor η is defined 
in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.7 (3). See Section 5.1.4 for modulus of elasticity.
Concrete is specified according to BS EN 206 (BS EN 206, 2013). The design strength 
for normal weight concrete (>2000kg/m3) is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.2 (1) by 
strength classes (commonly known as ‘grade’) given in BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.1 as the 
characteristic (5% failures) compressive cylinder strength fck and the cube strength fck,cube
in accordance with BS EN 206, e.g. grade C35/45 means fck =35 N/mm2 and fck,cube=45 N/
mm2. The additional strength of the cube is due to the lateral confinement of the loading 
platens during a compression test, and the small height-to-width shape of a cube, both of 
which contribute to an artificially higher strength of around 20%–25%.
The strength class used in design is the cylinder strength fck up to a maximum of 90 N/
mm2 (105 cube strength) with a minimum 20 N/mm2 for structural grades. The true stress

vs. strain (σc vs. εc) relationship for concrete of normal and higher mean strength fcm is 
shown in Figure 5.2a, based on BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 3.2. Note the reduced ductility after 
the peak stress of ‘higher’ strength, defined as greater C50/60, where the design concrete 
crushing strain reduces from εcu3 =0.0035 to 0.0026. In prestressed design, this has a small 
effect on the ultimate moment of resistance, typically 0.3%, unlike in reinforced concrete 
where this has a much greater effect on the balanced section, i.e. the point at which compres￾sion reinforcement is required.
The constitutive stress-strain relationship is idealised as a parabola-rectangle in Figure 
5.2b where the design strength fcd =fck/γm, where γm is the material partial safety factor of 
1.5 at the ultimate limit state and 1.2 for accidental situations based on the UK National 
Annex to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 2.1N (NA to BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004). Figure 5.2c shows 
the idealised rectangular stress block used in design, where the distance x to the centroid of 
the areas beneath the curves in Figure 5.2b and c due to the design strength ηfcd are estab￾lished by national codes to be as close as possible. BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 3.19–3.22 gives
η=1 for fck ≤50 N/mm2
η=1−(fck −50)/200 for fck ≤90 N/mm2 (5.1)
e.g. for fck =90 N/mm2 then fcd loses 20%.
In Figure 5.2c if the x-axis represents the depth to the neutral axis x, then the design rect￾angular stress block has a depth λx, where
λ=0.8 for fck ≤50 N/mm2
λ=0.8−(fck −50)/400 for 50<fck ≤90 N/mm2 (5.2)
i.e. 0.8 reduces to 0.7 at fck =90 N/mm2

for normal and high strengths, (b) parabola-rectangle idealisation, and (c) idealised rectangular

e.g. the ultimate force in a concrete beam of width b is Fc=design stress×area=η fck b 
λx=0.8 fck bx for fck =50 N/mm2 reducing to 0.56 fck bx for fck =90 N/mm2. Coupled with 
the reduced depth at the balanced section, the total force at the balanced section is Fc=24.68 
bd and 27.47 bd for fck =50 and 90 N/mm2, respectively, i.e. only 11% greater for 80% 
increase in fck!
The strength of concrete fck(t) between 3 and 28days can be determined either by testing 
cubes or cylinders, or estimated using semi-empirical equation for an average temperature of 
20°C and standard curing conditions, given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.2 (6) as follows:
f t cm fcm s t ( ) = − √ e (1 28/ ) (5.3)
where
f t cm f t ck 8 N/mm2 ( ) = + ( ) (5.4)
and fcm =fck +8 N/mm2 (representing a margin of 1.64 sd (standard deviations) of strength 
for 5% characteristic values). Precast production quality measures achieve early strength 
sd≈2–3 N/mm2, making the above conservative.
s=0.20, 0.25 and 0.38 for cement Class R, N and S
e.g. if fck =40 N/mm2 at 28days using CEM 52.5N (Class R), at say t=3days fcm(t)=48 
e0.2(1−√28/3)=48×0.663=31.8 N/mm2 and fck(t)=23.8 N/mm2. If the margin at 3days is taken 
as 3 N/mm2, then for the same example fck(t)=28.8 N/mm2, giving a better estimate of more 
than ⅔ at 3days.
When precasting in a modern factory, it is vital to achieve the dual requirements of good 
workability and early strength. For wet-cast work, the workability of the concrete is still 
specified according to slump value, e.g. 25–100mm in factory production, except in the case 
of concrete provided for slip forming or extrusion which has no workability requirements 
(zero slump). Concrete is often transported automatically from an automatic batching plant 
to the mould leaving no opportunity for workability tests. It is unlikely that such tests are 
required thanks to the experience of batching staff.
As explained in Section 4.2.3, a huge impact on precast production methods has been 
the use of self-compacting concrete (SCC), which, as the name suggests, will flow and com￾pact without external vibration. SCC admixtures conform to BS EN 206 Part 9 (BS EN 
206-9, 2010). After the problems of low early strength gain were resolved, this has been 
widespread in wet-cast voided units (Figures 2.15 and 2.16), double-tee floor units (Figure 
2.19) and beams. Figure 5.3 shows SCC flowing up to 1.5m in an outdoor steel mould on 
quite a cold day in the UK (around 7°C), achieving 18hours of detensioning cube strength of 
fck,cube=25–30 N/mm2. The workability of SCC is measured using a flow table in which the 
diameter of flow, as shown in Figure 5.4 is usually 600–700mm, neglecting the small ring 
of cement slurry at the edges. The precast industry has exploited the advancements made in 
concrete technology more than in any other part of the construction industry.
For the production of standard elements such as beams, concrete is cast into clean steel 
or timber (sometimes concrete) moulds, accurate to±3mm, or less, in cross section. Figure 
5.5 shows an adjustable steel mould of around 100m in length for casting rectangular and 
inverted-tee beams, or for casting double-tee slabs of fixed width (usually 2.4m) and vari￾able length and depth as shown in Figure 5.6. The use of clamped vibrators tuned to the 
correct oscillations for the size and weight of the filled mould ensures correct compaction 
to a density of around 2400kg/m3 (excluding reinforcement). The resulting surface finish 120 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

results in minimum porosity for maximum durability. Concrete strengths are made to match 
the optimum performance of each prestressed element, such that hcu, wet-cast voided units, 
double-tee floor units and beams are produced using fck =40–45 N/mm2, while T beams for 
beam and block flooring use fck =50–55 N/mm2.
5.1.3 Concrete for prestressed floor units
Precast floor units are manufactured using either ‘wet cast’ (semi-wet with less than 50mm 
slump, or wet-cast with 75mm slump) or ‘dry cast’ (‘semi-dry’ with zero slump and 5–10 
seconds V-B time). Steel moulds are used in the production of prestressed voided units, as 
shown in Figure 5.7. The concrete is fcm,cube=40 N/mm2 or fck(t)=25 N/mm2 at 20hours and 
hence achieves at least fck =45 N/mm2.
Machine extruded concrete is not, by definition, cast and compacted. It is instead forced 
through rotating augers to pass out through steel formers as shown in Figures 4.14 and 
4.15. An alternative method is for the moving steel bed to pass beneath a fixed position 
extruder, as shown in Figure 5.8. Good quality hcu are also manufactured using slip-formed 
concrete, produced through a machine that compacts concrete by rows of small hammers. 
Today slip-formers are less popular than extruders, due mainly to the better compaction 
and surface finish of the latter, but they are generally cheaper to purchase and maintain. To 
enable both of these processes to happen, the concrete is ‘earth-dry’, having a water-cement 
(or water-cementitious material) ratio of around 0.35–0.4. Aggregates are carefully selected, 
especially the sand grading and content, and the shape and size of the coarse aggregates, 
typically 14mm down. Because prestressed concrete benefits from additional strength in 
flexural compression, it is advantageous to use fck =40–45, although for certain geometry 
Figure 5.7 Casting wet-cast voided floor units.Materials, durability and fire resistance 123
and in order to balance the limiting compressive stress (0.45 fck) and tensile stress (fctm) the 
common grade is C45/55. For internal exposure, XC1, BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.3.2 (4) lim￾its the service condition to the mean axial tensile stress fctm given in Table 3.1 as
f f ctm 0.3 ck2/3 = (5.5a)
for concrete grade≤C50/60, otherwise
f f ctm = + 2.12 ln 1 8 ( ) ck + / 10 n( ) atural log to base e  
 (5.5b)
For exposure>XC1, BS EN 1992-1-1 Table 7.1 (superceded by the NA in Table A.4) requires 
that the service condition is ‘decompression’, i.e. zero tension. (See Section 7.2.1 for full analysis.)
Each producer will modify their mix according to variations in local supplies. The grad￾ing of fine aggregate is often the most critical mix parameter, especially in the dry mixes 
used in slip-formed and extruded concrete. Figure 5.9 shows typical grading curves for fine 
aggregate used in machine cast units; note the high percentage passing the 0.5mm sieve size 
for the extrusion machine.
5.1.4 Modulus of elasticity and modular ratios
The static value for the modulus of elasticity is calculated according to BS EN 1992-1-1, 
clause 3.1.3, and given in Table 3.1 as
E f cm 22 ck 8 / 10 0.3

for siliceous gravel aggregate. For limestone and sandstone aggregates, the value should be 
reduced by 10% and 30% respectively. For basalt aggregates, the value should be increased 
by 20%. Table 5.3 gives the relevant information for prestressed elements and the modular 
ratio when designed compositely with insitu concrete.
The tangent modulus Ec is measured at zero stress, i.e. it is the tangent of the stress v 
strain curve at zero stress. BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.4 (2) gives this as Ec=1.05 Ecm. Ec
is also known as the dynamic modulus Ed because it may be determined experimentally 
by dynamic vibration or pulse velocity methods when the concrete is unstressed. In the 
author’s experience of testing Ed and Ecm (at an applied stress of 0.33 fck,cube using Trent 
Valley gravel), the relationship in clause 3.1.4 (2) under estimates Ed, (the relationship given 
by Neville (Neville, 1995) Ed =(Ecm +19)/1.25 (N/mm2 units) is reliable) although the expres￾sion for Ecm in Eq. 5.6 tends to over estimate by about 10%.
Where insitu concrete of strength fcki is added to psc slabs and beams to form composite 
behaviour (see Chapter 12) the relative strengths (fck) and stiffness (Ecm) of the two mate￾rials must be considered using the modular ratio method. The most common combina￾tion of insitu-to-precast strengths is fcki/fck =25/45. This leads to the modular ratio m=Ecmi/
Ecm =(3.3/5.3)0.3 =0.87.
5.1.5 Shrinkage and creep
Shrinkage and creep are time-dependent properties of concrete. They depend on the ambient 
humidity in service (RHs %); the notional depth or thickness of element=twice the cross￾sectional area/exposed perimeter, ho =2Ac/u; concrete composition (water/cement ratio (w/c),

are stored; age (to) when load is first applied; and the duration and magnitude of the loading.
BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 2.3.2.2 notes: Shrinkage and creep effects should generally be 
taken into account for the verification of serviceability limit states. The effects should be 
considered at ultimate limit states only where their effects are significant, for example in 
the verification of ultimate limit states of stability where second-order effects are of impor￾tance. In other cases, these effects need not be considered for ultimate limit states, provided 
that ductility and rotation capacity of the elements are sufficient. Creep effects should be 
evaluated under the quasi-permanent combination of actions irrespective of the design 
situation considered, i.e. persistent, transient or accidental. In most cases, the effects of 
creep may be evaluated under permanent loads and the mean value of prestress. In other 
words, creep is considered for changes in secondary moments at supports in continuous 
slabs and beams, but otherwise is used only in the determination of long-term deformations 
of deflection and crack width.
In prestressed elements, some of the creep and shrinkage deformations take place prior to 
installation, something that is not considered in the Code’s equations, and therefore these 
effects are calculated at the time of installation (typically 7–28days) and in the long term of 
500,000hours (20833days, or 57years).
5.1.5.1 Shrinkage strains
Shrinkage causes shortening of concrete, around 400×10−6 (μm)≈4mm in 10m length, and 
is considered mainly in the long-term, although in composite design the short-term shrink￾age of the prestressed element is determined so that the effects of the relative shrinkage of 
the insitu to the precast can be determined for shrinkage-induced curvature. First intro￾duced in BS EN 1992-1-1 as clause 2.3.2.2, shrinkage actions are evaluated in clause 3.1.4 
and Appendix B as follows. The shrinkage strain εcs at time t (20833days for long-term) 
after removal from mould or detensioning at time ts=typically 1day is (Code clauses are 
listed in the left-hand column)

5.1.5.2 Creep strains
Concrete is a visco-elastic material, i.e. undergoes an increase in strain (and) when it is 
subjected to constant stress. It is mainly due to the deformability of the cement paste, which 
increases rapidly over the first few months after loading, and slows after 2years to around 
10% of that at 3months. In addition to the environmental and mix design parameters that 
affect creep strains, e.g. lower water-to-cement ratio and higher aggregate proportions 
reduce creep, a major factor is the age when the concrete is loaded, and loading history 
during unloading and reloading. For this reason, creep deflections due to imposed transient 
live loads are modified by the quasi-permanent factor as explained in Chapter 3, Section 
3.1.1. The development of creep strains is shown in Figure 5.11, and the influence of age 
at loading is shown in Figure 5.12. This is important when calculating creep deflections in 
prestressed slabs and beams where imposed dead and live loads are applied at different ages, 
and particularly so in composite construction where there are different concrete strengths in 
the precast and insitu concretes.
Creep causes changes in the modulus of elasticity from the immediate tangent value (as 
above) Ec to Ec/(1+φ(t,t0)) where φ(t,t0)=creep coefficient from time t0 to t. Similarly, the 
long-term Ecm is Ecm/(1+φ(t,t0)). This means that φ(t,t0) may be calculated for any time 
interval as

The short-term creep is known to have a logarithmic relationship with time, and the 
above results suggest that φ(t,t0) is a function of K loget x (by curve fitting the above the 
standard deviation of the differences is found to be minimum when x=1.3, from which 
the K=0.163 is then found) as follows:
At t=28days, 0.163×(loge 28)1.3 =0.78 (cf. 0.78)
At t=56days, 0.163×(loge 56)1.3 =1.00 (cf. 1.00)
At t=90days, 0.163×(loge 90)1.3 =1.15 (cf. 1.15), and so on.
BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 3.1 presents a graphical route to φ(t,t0) as reproduced in Figure 
5.13. The additional (dashed) line gives the solution to the long-term value above as 
φ(t,t0)≈2.2, in reasonable agreement with their equations in Appendix B.

β(t0)=1/(0.1+7.650.2)=0.624 as in Example 5.3.
Calculated creep coefficients φ(t,t0) are shown in Figure 5.15a for the long-term to 
20833days, and in Figure 5.15b up to 1year. For the self-weight of the hcu φ(t,t0) is first 
calculated using fck(t), RHs=70% and the notional depth ho =126mm (for full perimeter 
exposed, hollow cores are ignored), but at 28days the parameters change to fck, RHs=50% 
and ho =321mm (for the soffit perimeter only as the hcu is grouted to adjacent units and fin￾ishing screed is applied). Using the former φ(t,t0)=0.91, but the latter produces lower creep 
deflections and so the ‘effective’ creep coefficient is modified to allow for this to φ(t,t0)=0.75. 
The long-term effective value of φ(t,t0)=1.96. The creep coefficient for dead loads, applied at 
28days, is φ(t,t0)=1.74, and for imposed live load, applied at 84days, is φ(t,t0)=1.41. (These 
values may be compared with the effective creep factors for deflections of prestressed ele￾ments in Section 11.2.1).
The quasi-permanent compressive stress in the top of the slab at mid-span is 0.16 fcm, and 
the prestress at transfer is 0.22 fcm(t). Although these are about half the value where Ecm is 
measured (i.e. at 0.4 fcm, Figure 5.2a) deflections are calculated using Ecm and not Ec – the 
difference would only be a factor of about 1.025. The following deflections may also be 
compared with those in Section 11.2.1.
Calculated instantaneous and creep deflections are shown in Figure 5.16a for the long￾term to 20833days, and the same data in Figure 5.16b up to 1year. The data also include 
the instantaneous and creep camber due to prestress (using 6 no. 12.5mm strands at an 
axis height of 50mm). The creep coefficient for camber at installation is φ(t,t0)=0.91 using 
Ecm(t) at 20hours increasing gradually to Ecm at 28days. In the same period, the pretension￾ing force reduces by 2% (note that relaxation and elastic shortening have already taken 
place immediately after transfer). The final creep coefficient for camber is φ(t,t0)=2.23, an 
additional coefficient of 1.32, but note that the pretensioning force reduces by a further 
15% in the long term due to creep, shrinkage and relaxation of strands. When camber 
and self-weight deflections are added together, the conflicting parameters cancel out and 
the long-term deflection of the slab remains virtually the same, as shown in Figure 5.16a. 
Surprisingly, because camber is a function of span2 and self-weight deflection a function of 
span4 the result is the same for 6 and 10m spans.
Deflections for imposed live loads are subjected to the quasi-permanent factor ψ2, in 
this case ψ2 =0.3. The maximum long-term deflection of 8.3mm is well below the limit of 
span/250=32mm. The active deflection after installation of finishes of 7.6mm is below the 
limit of span/500=16mm (for brittle partitions or finishes).

Calculated shrinkage strains are shown in Figure 5.17 for up to 3years; beyond this age, the 
shrinkage curve is almost linear attaining a long-term value of εcs=0.00044. Note that the rate 
of strain during time in the stockyard prior to installation at 28days is roughly 5.2×10−6 per 
day, but within 2years the rate is 0.3×10−6 per day. The loss of prestress due to shrinkage ∆p,s
has also been calculated, but not presented as the increase of ∆p,s is almost an exact image of εcs. 
It is interesting to note that the ratio ∆p,s/εcs is constant (within 3 percentage points)≈185000 N/
mm2 per unit strain, close to the modulus of elasticity of strands (Ep =195000 N/mm2).
5.2 MIX DESIGN
5.2.1 Exposure, cover to tendons and concrete strength
The producer specifies the mix design according to BS EN 206 and the quantities of cement, 
aggregates (coarse and fine), water and admixtures & additives. The producer will specify 
the early strength gain expected. The quantity of mixing water, including the use of super￾plasticisers and self-compacting admixtures, is the minimum required to ensure the correct 
workability and strength intended for purpose. If a new family of concrete mixes is speci￾fied, trial mixes will be carried out to the satisfaction of the producer to demonstrate early 
handling and 28-day strengths.
Unlike previous British codes, environmental exposure is directly linked to concrete 
strength and vice versa, in addition to the usual mix design parameters of water/cement ratio 
(w/c) and cement type and content, and nominal cover (Cnom) to reinforcement. Exposure 
classes are for reinforcement corrosion induced by
• carbonation (XC1 to XC4)
• chlorides (XD1 to XD3)

• BS EN 1992-1-1 with the UK National Annex to BS EN 1992-1-1, Tables NA2 and NA3.
Note that in Table 5.4 only the grade of concrete is specified for exposure classes XC1-4, and 
although it is noted that the minimum cement content CEM I is 200 kg/m3. Conversely in 
Table 5.5 the grade of concrete is not specified for exposure classes XD and XS further to a 
note stating that the resistance to chloride ingress is mainly dependent on the type of cement 
and w/c ratio. The recommended grade of concrete for normal weight concrete is C20/25, 
except where shown for XD3.
Referring to BS EN 1992-1-1, clauses 4.4.1.1 (1) and 4.4.1.3 (3), nominal cover Cnom = 
Cmin + Cdev . Where cover is regulated by quality control in the factory Cdev may be taken as 
5 mm. \Cnom = Cmin + 5 mm. Tables 5.4 and 5.5 give Cnom according to exposure class for 
grade of concrete, or maximum w/c ratio and minimum cement content, respectively. Table 
5.6 combines the information in these tables showing the requirements for w/c ratio and 
cement content for grades of concrete from C20/25 to C45/55, which is also based on data 
by the UK Concrete Centre (Concrete Centre, 2024) for exposure up to XD3.
5.2.2 Exposure, cover and strength for T beams 
in beam and block flooring
The recommendations given in the product standard BS EN 15037-1 (BS EN 15037-1, 2008) 
are slightly different to the above. BS EN 15037-1, clause 4.3.7 states ‘Alternative conditions 
described in Annex A of BS EN 13369 (BS EN 13369, 2004) may apply’, i.e. cover to the 
lower face may comply with the values given for slabs in Table A.2 of the common rules for 
precast concrete BS EN 13369.
For internal exposure XC1, Table A.1 refers to Environmental Condition B. For external 
moderate exposure XC3, Table A.1 refers to Condition C.

prestressed concrete using cement CEM I according to BS 8500-1:2023, Table A.4a for 50 years

Resistance to chloride ingress is mainly dependent upon the type of cement and water/cement (w/c) ratio. The recom￾mended grade of concrete for normal weight concrete is C20/25, except where shown for XD3. Adjustment to 
cement content for different size of aggregate is given in BS 8500-1, Table A.7.

However, BS EN 13369, clause A.2 states that for the alternative conditions to be applied 
(i) concrete class ≥ C40/50 and (ii) characteristic value of water absorption is less than 
6.0%, and the concrete cover given in Table A.2 may be reduced by 5 mm. Under pri￾vate arrangements, using an independent testing house in the UK, characteristic values of 
water absorption from two sets of six samples were found to be 4.05% and 2.52%, both 
well below 6%, together with mean compressive cube strengths of 77 and 61 N/mm2, 
respectively. Cover may therefore be reduced by 5 mm such that Cnom = 25 − 5 = 20 mm for 
exposure XC3. The reduction of Cnom to 15 mm for exposure XC1 is not considered nec￾essary as 20 mm is the smallest cover used in practice. Values of Cnom for other exposure 
conditions up to XD1 are given in Table 5.7.
5.2.3 Mortar
Mortar, a sand-cement semi-dry mix, is used during the construction of prestressed con￾crete elements for wet bedding of wide slab units and but infrequently for double-tee slabs 
and beams, as these are usually erected onto elastomeric (or felt) pads due to high concen￾trated bearing forces. Mortar is also used for completing the infill in the longitudinal joints 
between floor units (hcu, voided and double-tee), although it may be termed infill ‘concrete’ 
as it contains small sizes of gravel (typically 6mm) rather than sand (up to 4mm). In both 
cases of bearings and infill, the mortar is therefore structural. Mortar is also brushed into 
the joints between T beams and concrete blocks (not EPS blocks) in beam and block flooring 
in order to stabilise the elements. In this context, it is a non-structural mortar.
Mix design is according to BS EN 206 as quantities of cement, fine aggregates, water 
and admixtures & additives. The sand is typically graded at 0/4mm, but may include 6mm 
pea gravel for joints wider than 50mm. BS EN 13139 (BS EN 13139, 2002) lists the pre￾ferred sizes of aggregates for mortar as: (min/max) 0/2mm, 0/4mm, 2/4mm and 2/8mm. 
Sieve sizes and other information are according to PD 6682 Part 3 (PD 6682-3, 2003). The 
strength of mortar in compression is generally not less than the parent material at the joint,

but in other cases such as longitudinal joints between slabs may be C25/30. The workability 
of mortar is classed as ‘very low’ with no slump.
Dry pack mortar may be used where it is not possible to pour; it has w/c≈0.25−0.30 and 
is therefore mouldable in the hand. It may be placed by hand and trowel and hammered into 
position, which removes free air. It may be either ‘structural’ or ‘non-structural’ as above, 
but it is not possible to make control cubes.
5.2.4 Aggregates
EN 206 clause 5.1.3 states that normal weight coarse aggregates from natural land 
sources conform to BS EN 12620 (BS EN 12620, 2002). Sea dredge aggregates are not 
used. Moisture content is measured according to BS EN 1097 Part 6 (BS EN 1097-6, 
2000). Samples should not be taken from the base of the stock pile. BS EN 206 clause 
5.5.2 states that normal weight aggregates should have an oven-dry density between 
2000 and 2600 kg/m3. BS EN 206 clause 5.2.7 states that aggregate chloride content is 
≤0.2% by mass of cement. Chloride content is certified by the aggregate supplier, both 
in bulk or in bags.
Annex E of BS EN 13139 prescribes minimum test frequencies for the various properties 
and the appropriate test methods. Aggregates are checked for reactive silica content, which 
may cause alkali-silica reactions with cement, so they remain below a threshold value that 
has to be carefully experimentally assessed by the aggregate producer. If this is not satisfied 
low alkali cement with less than 0.75% alkalis may be used such that the total alkali content 
of the concrete is less than 3kg/m3.
5.2.5 Substitute materials
Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) may be used as a substitute for natural aggregates 
up to a maximum replacement of 20% by weight of coarse aggregate not passing a 4 mm 
sieve. Waste hcu, Figure 5.18, produce a well-graded coarse RCCA but a very fine RCFA, 
too fine to be reintroduced in machine cast units. RCCA is stockpiled as shown in Figure 
5.19; note that the angle of repose shows that this is as well graded and shaped as natural 
aggregate. RCFA can be used in wet-casting if not passing a 1 mm sieve. Recycled fines 
as dust is not used. The water absorption of all RCA is determined according to BS EN 
1097 Part 6 (BS EN 1097-6, 2000) in the surface saturated dry condition. The chloride 
content of all RCA is determined according to BS EN 1744 Part 1 (BS EN 1744-1, 2009), 
clause 7, and is not greater than 0.2% CaCl content by weight. Recycled crushed brick and 
mortar, or any other crushed material of unknown parentage, is not used as replacement 
aggregate.
5.2.6 Admixtures
Admixtures comply with BS EN 934 Parts 1 to 3 (BS EN 934-1, 2008, BS EN 934-2, 2009, 
BS EN 934-3, 2009). Dosages are permitted not to be within the range given in proprietary 
data sheets providing that the performance of the concrete is verified by the manufacturer 
or, ready-mix supplier. Calcium chloride is not used as an admixture.
EN 206 clause 5.1.5 states that air entrainment agents and superplasticisers, excluding 
SCC, may be used to comply with BS EN 934-2, clause 4.2 as a water-reducing agent where 
total air content<6%. Superplasticisers should comply with the testing standard BS EN 480 
Part 1 (BS EN 480-1, 2006).Materials, durability and fire resistance 139

and shaped as natural aggregate (courtesy Bison Precast Ltd., UK).

5.2.7 Water
Mixing water conforms to BS EN 1008, clause 3.1 (BS EN 1008, 2002) and should be pota￾ble from land sources. Sea water is not permitted. Water reclaimed from cement slurry must 
be filtered and the cement content is calculated and known from the specific gravity of the 
filtered slurry. Crushed ice may be used to replace 50% of the mixing water, or according 
to the manufacturer’s specification. The maximum particle size for crushed ice is not more 
than about 20mm. No particles of crushed ice are visible in the final mix.
5.3 STEEL REINFORCEMENT FOR PRESTRESSED CONCRETE
5.3.1 Pretensioning tendons
Two main types of steel tendons are used for pretensioning – (i) plain or indented (or 
crimped) wire, and (ii) 7-wire helical strand. Although 3-wire helical strand is used in 
some countries prestressing bars, such as ‘Macalloy’, are not common in precast facto￾ries. Figure 2.2 shows an array of 12.5 mm diameter 7-wire strand in a prestressed beam, 
and Figure 5.20 shows the same cross section in a hcu. Note the excellent compaction of 
concrete around the strand, particularly in the crevices between the outer wires. This is 
vital for the good transfer of stress to the concrete. Prestressing tendons conform to BS EN 
10138 Parts 1 to 3 (BS EN 10138-1, 2015, BS EN 10138-2, 2015, BS EN 10138-3, 2015) 
(Parts 1 and 3 are under ‘technical review’). Standard 7-wire helical strand of 9.3, 10.9, 
12.5 and 15.7 mm diameter; standard 3-wire helical strand of 6.5 mm diameter, and super 
strand (Dyform) of 9.6, 12.9 and 15.2 mm diameter, may be used. Section properties are 
listed in Table 5.8.
Figure 5.20 Cross section of 7-wire helical strand in a hollow core unit.Materials, durability and fire resistance 141
The 5% characteristic tensile strength is taken as fpk =1770 N/mm2, except for 7mm wire 
where fpk =1670 N/mm2. Super-stress strand is also available with fpk =1770 to 1860 N/mm2, 
with reported strengths of up to 2100 N/mm2, and relaxation at 1000hours ρ1000 =2.5%. 
The modulus of elasticity Ep is taken as 195 kN/mm2 for helical strand, and 205 kN/mm2
for indented wire. The elongation at the breaking load (obtained from BS 5896, 1980*) is 
taken as 3.5% or εuk =35×10−3 >0.0222 used in BS EN 1992-1-1 as shown in the idealised 
stress v strain relationship in Figure 5.21b (Figure 5.21a shows the same for rebars for com￾parison). For hcu, the maximum diameter of strand is 16mm and wire 11mm according to 
BS EN 1168 (BS EN 1168, 2005), clause 4.1.1.1. The diameter of wires used in T beams for 
beam and block is 5mm and less commonly 7mm. (*Although this standard is being super￾ceded by BS EN 10138 the material properties of strand supplied by the manufacturers still 
conform to Tables 4–6 of this standard.)
The choice of tendon is often a matter of the arrangement of tendons and the correct 
distribution of pretensioning force in a section. Large tendons should not be placed in thin 
wall sections; to avoid localised splitting and bond failure, the edge cover to tendons is at

least twice the diameter. For this reason, helical strand is preferred in larger units or where 
the level of prestress is high.
Helical strand comprising of 3 or 7 hot rolled wires, and individual hot rolled plain or 
Belgian indented wire, is used according to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.3.2 (4) as low relax￾ation Class 2. There are immediate and long-term losses of force called ‘relaxation’ due 
to the stress-relieving heat treatment process. Class 2 tendons have 2.5% low relaxation, 
meaning that the residual stress after 1000hours of relaxation is 97.5% of the original, 
although manufacturers may quote characteristic relaxation as low as 1.6% at 1000hours. 
Class 1 relaxation is greater but is rarely used today. When calculating relaxation losses, 
BS EN 1992-1-1 splits the losses into immediate and long term as discussed in Chapter 7, 
Section 7.2.4. Plain and indented wire is of 5 and 7mm diameter, and ribbed wire of 9mm 
diameter may be used. Table 5.8 lists the range of strength fpk, modulus of elasticity Ep and 
area Ap of tendons used in prestressed elements.
The actual and idealised stress vs. strain relationships for tendons are given in BS EN 1992-
1-1, Figs. 3.9 and 3.10. Figure 5.22 shows real tensile force vs. elongation for 7-helical strand 
of 12.5mm diameter carried out by the manufacturer using grade 1860 strand. The measured 
cross-sectional area is 92.04mm2 (1.04% less than 93mm2 nominal). The mean ultimate tensile 
strength fpu in 9 such tests is 1970 N/mm2, with a standard deviation sd=8.5 N/mm2, giving a 
characteristic fpk =1956 N/mm2, 5.2% greater than nominal. The mean tensile strength at 1% 
elongation fp0.1 is 1856 N/mm2, with sd=9.5 N/mm2 and fp0.1k =1840 N/mm2. The mean ratio in 
the tests fp0.1k/fpk =0.94 is in reasonable agreement, yet conservative, with the idealised value of 
0.9 given in BS EN 1992-1-1. Interestingly, the characteristic elastic modulus in the tests Ep =206 
kN/mm2 is 6% greater than the nominal 195 N/mm2 for strand. Paradoxically the greater 
Ep increases elastic and creep losses of prestress, although this is only by 0.8% in the worked 
Example 7.1 in Chapter 7, giving a reduction of 0.4% in the service moment of resistance.
Referring to Figure 5.21b, the design value is fpk/γs, where γs=1.15 for ultimate and 1.00 for 
accidental limit states from NA to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 2.1N. Adequate ductility in tension 
may be assumed if fpk/fp0,1k ≥k=1.1 from clause 3.3.6 (7) and the UK National Annex, then 
Figure 5.22 Real tensile load vs. elongation curves for 12.5mm diameter 7-wire pretensioning strand. Axial 
load of 171 kN is equivalent to the design ultimate strength of 1860 N/mm2.Materials, durability and fire resistance 143
fp0,1k =0.9 fpk. The design strength at the limit of proportionality (LOP) is therefore fpd =0.9 fpk/γs. 
The inclined branch is used for prestressing tendons as the additional strength between fpd and 
fpk/γs is worthwhile, even if the strain is limited to 0.02. Figure 5.23 shows the design values 
for strand for example fpk =1770 N/mm2. Then fpd =0.9 fpk/1.15=1385 N/mm2 and fpk/γs=1539 
N/mm2, an increase of stress of 154 N/mm2 for an increase in a strain εuk - εLOP =(0.0222–
1385/195000)=0.0151. This gives fp,max =1517 N/mm2, an additional 132 N/mm2 or 10% 
extra. The design may also be based on the actual stress vs. strain relationship, if this is known, 
with stress above the elastic limit reduced analogously with BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 3.10.
The example shown in Figure 5.23 shows the final ultimate limit state design point at fp
about half-way between fpd and fp,max – a typical situation for elements with rows of tendons 
at the bottom of the section, such as hcu, voided units, thermal slabs, where the final strain 
εp ≈0.014. However in T beams for beam and block flooring, due to the narrow upstand and 
wires at a relatively higher position (than say hcu) the final strain εp ≈0.007 is close to the 
LOP, i.e. the wires remain almost elastic at the ultimate limit state.
5.3.2 Rebars
Prestressed concrete elements may contain high tensile hot rolled ribbed bar (HT rebar), for 
example as shear stirrups, top steel for lifting purposes, as confinement or strut-and-tie rein￾forcement or links at supports, and steel mesh in top flanges of double-tee or ribbed thermal 
units. They may also contain main rebars in partially prestressed elements, but these are not 
considered in this book, as they are dealt with extensively by Gilbert et al. (2017).
Rebars designated ‘H’ are used in 95% of cases, even in shear links where mild steel 
would be suitable. The small cost difference compared to the additional strength, viz. 500 
vs. 250 N/mm2, and the need for consistency of habit when assembling cages, makes it

more economical. High tensile steel bars conform to BS EN 10080 (BS EN 10080, 2005) 
as B500A, B500B and B500C (some designers specify the bars as ‘B’ rather than ‘H’). The 
technical specification according to the UK National Annex gives values of
• Re=yield strength=500 N/mm2 (note that strengths of 600 N/mm2 are available in 
some countries)
• Rm/Re=ratio of tensile strength/yield strength (also known as k=ftk/fyk)=1.05, 1.08 
and 1.15 to 1.35 for classes A, B and C in BS EN 1992-1-1, Annex C.
• Agt=percentage total elongation at maximum force=2.5% (εuk =25×10−3), 5.0% and 
7.5%, respectively.
The standard also gives fatigue strength, bend performance, weldability, bond strength, 
shear and weld strength for use in welded fabric, tolerances and dimensions. B500 6mm 
diameter reinforcing steel does not comply with BS EN 1992-1-1 with respect to ductility. 
Reinforcement shape codes are according to BS 8666 (BS 8666, 2005) and details according 
to ISO 3766 (BS EN ISO 3766, 2003).
The actual and idealised stress vs. strain relationships for reinforcing bars are given in BS 
EN 1992-1-1, Figs. 3.7 and 3.8. Typically k=ftk/fyk =1.08. The design value for bars fyk/γs, 
where γs=1.15 and 1.00 as before. Then at ultimate fyd =0.87 fyk =435 N/mm2 for H500 
rebar. The bi-linear idealised and design curves are shown here in Figure 5.21a. There are 
two design options known as the ‘inclined’ or ‘horizontal’ branches. The horizontal branch 
(having a constant value fyd =435 N/mm2 for H500 rebar) is more convenient for the design 
of reinforced concrete sections and has no limitation of strain in under-reinforced sections. 
The drawback with the inclined branch is that even if the strain in the bars at ultimate is say 
0.01 the design stress fyd =449 N/mm2, i.e. only 14 N/mm2 greater than 435 N/mm2. Second, 
the strain is limited to εud =0.02.
Mild steel is now less frequently used for projecting loops etc. even though it is easier to 
hand bend on site. Bar diameters commonly used are 8 and 10mm for column links, 10 and 
12mm for beam stirrups and other distribution or anti-crack bars, and 16, 20, 25, 32 and 
40mm for main flexural bars. Plain round mild steel bar of yield strength 250 N/mm2 does 
not conform to BS EN 10080 and BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.2.2 (3).
5.3.3 Mesh
Welded fabric, or ‘mesh’, is used in the top flanges of double-tee and thermal units. It is also 
used to reinforce structural toppings to floor slabs on site. The popular mesh sizes are A98, 
A142 or A193 (5, 6 or 7mm bars at 200mm centres in both directions). A rectangular (so 
called ‘long’) mesh C283 (6mm at 100mm centres×5mm at 400mm centres) is often used in 
one way spanning units such as the flanges of double tee slabs. For rebar and mesh, the char￾acteristic strength fyk =500 N/mm2. The design strength fyd =fyk/γs=500/1.15=438 N/mm2. 
Young’s modulus is taken as 200 kN/mm2. There is no European standard for welded mesh; 
it still conforms to BS 4483 (BS 4483, 2005).
5.4 STRUCTURAL STEEL, WELDING, INSERTS AND BOLTS
5.4.1 Structural steelwork
Structural steelwork sections are used in end connections of prestressed beams, particu￾larly in highly stressed half joints where the strut-and-tie resistance of the concrete and 
rebars is structurally or practically inadequate. Steel plates, rolled angles, channels and Materials, durability and fire resistance 145
small rectangular and square hollow sections (RHS, SHS) may be used and anchored into 
the beams by welded rebars, loops, etc. Solid steel billets may be required to complete end 
connections, but as these are required in columns and walls they are beyond the scope of 
this book. See Elliott and Jolly (Elliott and Jolly, 2013) and Elliott (Elliott, 2017) for further 
information.
Structural steelwork conforms to BS EN 10025 Part 1 (BS EN 10025-1, 2004) and is 
designed according to BS EN 1993 Part 1-1 (BS EN 1993-1-1, 2005). The grade of hot￾rolled structural steel is S275 (fy/fu = yield/ultimate = 275/430 N/mm2), S355 (355/510) 
or S450 (440/550) according to BS EN 10025 Part 2 (BS EN 10025-2, 2004). (These 
used to be known as grade 43, 51 and 55, respectively.) The grade of rectangular hol￾low sections is S275H (275/430) or S355H (355/510) according to BS EN 10210-1 (BS 
EN 10210-1, 1994). Its specification includes product analysis, carbon equivalent, yield 
strength, tensile strength, stress v strain data, and elongation. Steel strength is according 
to Table 5.9.
5.4.2 Welding
Rolled steel sections and flat steel plates are welded to form steel connectors in many highly 
stressed support situations where direct contact between concrete surfaces is to be avoided. 
Permitted procedures for lap or butt welding of rebars and spot welding of cruciform rebars 
to produce mesh is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.2.5. This limiting ratio of diameters 
of 0.57 is not contravened for rectangular mesh.
Welding conforms to BS EN 1011, Part 1 (BS EN 1011-1, 2009). Welding equipment con￾forms to BS EN 60974, Part 1 (BS EN 60974-1, 2005) and may use proprietary plant such 
as Murex, Thermadyne, Rand, Migatronic, Cebora, etc. This BS was published in January 
2006, but is currently being revised.
Welding electrodes conform to BS EN 1011 Parts 2 and 3 (BS EN 1011-2, 2001, BS EN 
1011-3, 2000). Rod sizes should vary between 2.5 and 6mm. Welded electrodes are mostly 
grade E275. When used to join grade S275 steel (previously known as grade 43) this gives the 
yield strength of the weld as fyw =275 N/mm2 and ultimate tensile strength fuw =430 N/mm2. 
When used in combination with grade S355 steel grade E355 electrodes gives fyw and 
fuw =355 and 510 N/mm2. The values are divided by γM2 =1.25, so that the design strengths 
are pywd =220 and 284 N/mm2, respectively. Intermittent fillet welds are rarely used as weld 
lengths tend to be short. Weld strength is according to Table 5.10.
Welding of ferrous reinforcing bars uses either metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal 
active gas (MAG) welding. The welding electrode rod for high tensile bar is a low hydro￾gen type to cover a wide range of applications for welding carbon manganese and low 
alloy steels.

Welding of reinforcing steel bars to structural steel in load-bearing joints is in accordance 
with BS EN ISO 17660 Part 1 (BS EN ISO 17660-1, 2006). The processes used are shielded 
metal arc, gas metal arc. The welding electrode rods for B500 rebar is low hydrogen type 
electrodes to cover a wide range of applications for welding carbon manganese and low 
alloy steels. Spot welding of non-load-bearing bars is according to BS EN ISO 17660 Part 2 
(BS EN ISO 17660-2, 2006).
Butt and fillet welds are fully fused fillet welds to make lap joints, corner joints, and T 
joints, having a convex profile, and may be either continuous or intermittent. Rebar T-joints, 
i.e. bars of equal diameter crossing at right angles, are a flared V groove weld. Butt welds 
may be used along a single edge in a single plane. The throat thickness of the weld, run-out 
lengths, under cutting, cracks, and inaccuracies of position are inspected for compliance, 
recorded and if necessary rejected. When thicker materials are welded, the edges are bevelled 
to form a single or double V-groove. No backup weld or backing strip is used. Preheating 
is not required, and post-weld heat treatment is normally not required unless specified on 
the production drawings. Site welding is carried out using an intermediate reinforcing bar 
provided in V-grooved butting joints. The diameter of the bar is equal to 0.7×the depth of 
V groove.
5.4.3 Cast-in fixings and lifting devices
Cast-in fixings, such as threaded sockets, lifting loops and sockets, spherical head anchors, 
rotating anchors, flat steel and tail anchors, etc. are used according to manufacturers’ 
instructions, including edge distances, depth of embedment, anchorage reinforcement, con￾crete strengths, etc.
Lifting systems are designed according to their intended use and the mode of lifting, num￾ber of lifters and angle of lifting chains, concrete strength, element dimensions, type of lifting 
equipment, speed of lifting, and ground conditions. Spherical head lifting anchor and plate 
anchors are available in steel minimum grade S355 or stainless steel 304 or hot dip spun 
galvanised. Anchors are manufactured, batch-checked and tested by an independent testing 
house. Lifting loops are manufactured using galvanised steel wire minimum grade S500, and 
supplied with anchorages. All galvanised work is according to BS EN ISO 1461 (BS EN ISO 
1461, 2022). Polypropylene loops may be used where steel is not appropriate. Care is taken 
not to pass these loops over sharp edges. Anchors have a minimum factor of safety of 3. 
The factor of safety against concrete failure is taken as 2.5. Bespoke lifting devices cast into 
concrete may be designed and manufactured by a manufacturer or frame erector. Load tests 
can carried out according to BS 5080 Part 1 (BS 5080-1, 1993) and evaluated according to 
BS EN 1990 (BS EN 1990, 2002).

5.4.4 Bolting
Bolting in prestressed concrete elements is uncommon. Making a fixing to a cast-in socket 
is the usual situation, but rarely to floor units. Metric bolts, set screws and nuts conform 
to BS 3692 (BS 3692, 2001). These are current documents with no BS EN. The minimum 
diameter for a structural bolt or threaded rod is 12mm. Clearance holes should not be more 
than 2mm greater than the nominal bolt or rod diameter. Holes should not be enlarged.
Strength grades for carbon steel are preferably limited to grades 4.6 and 8.8. The code, e.g. 
4.6: 4 means ultimate strength fub =400 N/mm2; 6 means yield strength fybk =0.6×400=240 
N/mm2. The design strength is pybd =fybk/γM2 where γM2 =1.25. Grade strength of nuts is 6 and 
8, respectively. Black bolts are grade 4:6 (pybk =240 N/mm2 in tension and pq =0.6×240=144 
N/mm2 in shear) and grade 8:8 (pybk =480 N/mm2 and pq =0.6×480=288 N/mm2).
High strength friction grip bolts (HSFG) are used in special circumstances where the 
integrity and safety (both temporary and permanent) of connections made with ordinary 
bolts in clearance holes cannot be guaranteed. HSFG bolts conform to the UK National 
Annex to BS EN 1993 Part 1–8 (NA to BS EN 1993-1-8, 2005) using grades 8.8, 10.9 and 
12.9. Preloading of HSFG bolts conforms to BS EN 14399 Part 1 (BS EN 14399-1, 2005). 
HSFG bolts are tightened using power tools showing specified torque or be tightened by 
hand using spanners according to the load indicating washer.
5.5 FIRE RESISTANCE OF PRESTRESSED ELEMENTS
5.5.1 Fire resistance and axis distance to rebars and tendons
This section deals with the relationship of fire resistance with the cover, or more precisely 
the mean axis distance, to the centroid of tendons contributing to the bending strength of 
prestressed slabs and beams. In the Eurocodes, fire is classed as an ‘accidental situation of 
fire exposure’, where the assessment of fire and its consequential conformity is according 
to BS EN 1992, Part 1–2 (BS EN 1992-1-2, 2004) and the UK National Annex (NA to BS 
EN 1992-1-2, 2004) ‘General rules - Structural fire design’. The fire resistance of certain 
precast products is covered in product standards such as BS EN 13369 for the ‘Common 
Rules’, BS EN 1168 for hollow core and voided slabs and BS EN 15037-1 for T beams for 
beam and block flooring. Double-tee units and thermal units are classed as ribbed slabs and, 
apart from some thermal contours in the tapered ribs given in BS EN 13224 (BS EN 13224, 
2004), are covered in BS EN 1992-1-2 as ‘beams’ (for the ribs) and ‘slabs’ for the top flanges. 
It is important to note that product standards are intended to be used for the product itself 
(beams, floor units) and not for the design of the completed building or floor slab.
The fire resistance of structural elements has three components
1. R: fire resistance class for the load-bearing criterion – the capacity of an element to 
resist loads in the fire limit state, such as bending moments MEd,fi ≤MRd,fi where the fire 
load is taken as dead load plus the frequent fraction of the live load, Gk +ψ1Qk (see 
Chapter 3, Section 3.1.2). The fire load ratio is given in BS EN 1992-1-2, Exp. 2.4 as 
ηfi =Ed,fi/Ed. Then MEd,fi =ηfi MEd. The resistance MRd,fi is based on the reduced strength 
of steel and concrete at elevated temperature.
2. E: fire resistance class for the integrity criterion – otherwise known as the separating 
criterion based on the wall thickness or slab depth of fire-resisting compartments, 
including plastering, screeds, finishes or other non-combustible layers, e.g. a 150mm 148 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
deep concrete slab with 50mm insulating layer plus a 75mm sand/cement screed would 
have an equivalent fire thickness of 225mm.
3. I: fire resistance class for the insulation criterion – this is also a separating criterion 
where the average temperature rise over the whole of the non-exposed surface is lim￾ited to 140°C, and the maximum temperature rise at any point of that surface does not 
exceed 180°C.
Fire resistance is measured by the ability of a structure or elements to satisfy the above for 
30, 60, 90, 120, 180 or 240 minutes in standard fire exposure. Therefore if an element 
achieves MEd,fi =MRd,fi after say 100 minutes of fire exposure its fire class is R 90. If the ele￾ment also has sufficient thickness/depth to satisfy that requirement after say 75 minutes fire 
exposure its fire class is E 60, and is able to satisfy a separating criterion for 120 minutes its 
fire class is I 120. The element’s combined class is then REI 60.
The design for fire resistance can be satisfied either by
i. member analysis in BS EN 1992-1-2, Sections 2 to 4, in which the criterion for the 
fire action EEd,fi ≤ fire resistance ERd,fi where E represents shear, bending, bearing, 
buckling, etc.
ii. indirectly by the use of tables in BS EN 1992-1-2, Section 5 giving the requirements 
for member thickness or depth heff, width of beam bmin, width of webs bw and centroi￾dal cover distance (called ‘axis’ distance a) to steel bars/tendons, satisfying fire class 
R and E
iii. specific precast floors are covered in EC Product Standards
For (i) BS EN 1992-1-2, Section 4.2 member capacity is based on the reduced compressive 
strength of concrete factor kc(θ) (Fig. 4.1), for rebars ks(θ) (Fig. 4.2), and for prestressing ten￾dons kp(θ) (Fig. 4.3) at elevated temperature. BS EN 1992-1-2 Annexes B.1 and B.2 provide 
a systematic approach to spalling breadths as well as the calculation model for reinforced 
concrete MRd,fi in Fig. B.2. Note that the strength of concrete in a fire situation fcd,fi(20) is in 
fact the strength of concrete at normal temperature fck/γc,fi because γc,fi =1.0, so kc(θ) is not 
used. Values for λ and η are the same as in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.7 even though the 
stress-strain profile at elevated temperature given in BS EN 1992-1-2, Fig. 3.1 is quite dif￾ferent to BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 3.3. The net width of concrete in compression subjected to 
fire bfi, i.e. sides of beams but not the top of slabs, is given in Fig. B.1 at the position of the 
500°C isotherm. The calculation for MRd,fi according to Fig. B.2 can be written for a singly 
reinforced section as
MRd,fi = θ A k s p, rov s( )f z yk fi (5.26a)
where As,prov means the area of rebar ‘provided’
zfi = − d x 0.4 0 fi ≤ .95d (5.27)
x A fi = θ s s k f ( ) yk / 0( ) .8b ffi ck (5.28)

But BS EN 1992-1-2, clause 4.2.1 (3) states that Annex E also provides a simplified calcula￾tion for the design of beams and slabs, subjected to predominantly UDL and linear analysis, 
i.e. the traditional methods used in BS 1992-1-1. Exp. E.3 is
MRd,fi = γ s s k A ( ) θ ( ) s p, , rov s A M req Ed (5.29)
where As,req means the area of bar ‘required’ at ultimate
Note that As,prov, As,req and MEd are for ambient temperature design.
A good approximation is that As,prov/As,req ≈MRd/MEd. In fact for the hcu analysed in 
Section 5.5.4, at almost full capacity MRd/MEd =1.088 and As,prov/As,req =1.095, a difference 
of 0.6%. If the hcu is say 30% under designed where MRd/MEd =1.42 then As,prov/As,req =1.45, 
a difference of 2.1%.
Substituting MEd,fi =ηfi MEd ≤MRd,fi Eq. 5.29 may be simplified even further as
MEd M k Rd s s fi / ( ≤ γ θ η ) / (5.30)
A worked example is given in Section 5.5.4.
As BS EN 1992-1-2, Section 4.2 refers also to prestressing tendons it may be assumed that 
Exp. E.3 is also applicable to prestressed concrete as follows
Now
A M s req = γ Ed ( ) z fyk / , s (5.31)
then
z = γ M A Ed s s,reqfyk (5.32)
If it is assumed, as suggested in BS EN 1168 for hcu, that the lever arm zfi =z, which for most 
wide slabs is z=0.95d, then
MRd,fi = θ A k s p, rov s( )f z yk ( ) as 5.26a above
Substituting MRd,fi = θ A k s p, , rov s( )f Myk Ed γ s s / A f req yk
or
MRd,fi = γ s s k A ( ) θ ( ) s p, , rov s / a A M req Ed ( ) s 5.29 above
is the same as Exp. E.3.
For prestressed concrete Eqs. 5.26 and 5.29 are not exactly the same because there 
is a limiting value to the maximum stress in tendons which is lower than pyk/γs, e.g. for 
pyk =1770 N/mm2 it is 1516 N/mm2 <1770/1.15=1539 N/mm2. See Figure 5.23. This means 
that γp =1770/1516≈1.17. However, the simplified design methods given by either BS EN 
1992-1-2, Fig. B.2 or Exp. E.3 may be used.
For (ii), tabulated data for heff, bmin, bw and a are given in BS EN 1992-1-2 Section 5 for 
beams and slabs as shown in Figure 5.24. Axis distance a=cover plus link diameter, neglect￾ing the 2Φ radius bend at the corners of the links which often causes the main bars to rise 
up the section. For (iii), the fire resistance of prestressed hcu is obtained from BS EN 1168, 
Annex G, and for T beams and the completed beam and block floor is obtained indirectly 
from tables in BS EN 15037-1.150 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
5.5.2 Axis distances to pretensioned tendons
The axis distance to tendons a is according to BS EN 1992-1-2, Table 5.8 for one-way 
spanning slabs, e.g. for R 90 a=30mm, meaning that cover to larger strands may be 
30-12.5/2=23.75mm, which is rather close to the soffit to avoid splitting cracks beneath the 
strands at transfer. Therefore a=40mm is more commonly used.
The axis distance a is according to BS EN 1992-1-2, Table 5.5 for simply supported beams, 
together with a minimum width bmin, e.g. for R 90 and a width of 400mm a=35mm, the 
smallest allowable.
Note that a is the mean axis distance to centroid of tendons according to area (not pre￾stressing force) in the tension zone, i.e. at depths below h−xfi, where xfi is depth to neutral 
axis for fire moment MEd,fi =ηfi MEd (See Section 5.5.1). Then xfi =(d−zfi)/0.4, where zfi = d
min{0.95; [0.5+√(0.25−Kfi/1.134)]}, where Kfi =MEd,fi/fck b d2. BS EN 1992-1-2, clause 5.2 
(14) states that a is a nominal value – allowance for tolerance need not be added.
For prestressed elements Tables 5.5, 5.6 and 5.8 state that a should be increased accord￾ing to clause 5.2 (5) as follows: For prestressing tendons the critical temperature for bars is 
assumed to be 400°C and for strands and wires to be 350°C. This assumption corresponds 
approximately to Ed,fi=0.7 Ed, fp0,1k/fpk=0.9 and γs=1.15 (stress level σs, fi
/fp0,1k=0.55). If 
no special check according to clause 5.2 (7) is made in prestressed tensile members, beams 
and slabs the required axis distance a should be increased by
• 10mm for prestressing bars, corresponding to θcr=400°C
• 15mm for prestressing wires and strands, corresponding to θcr=350°C
BS EN 1992-1-2, Fig. 5.1, shows the relationship between the reduction factor kp(θcr) and 
critical temperature θcr for prestressing tendons. (Do not confuse this with kp(θ) from Fig. 
4.3.) Clause 5.2 (6 to 8) and Exps. 5.2 and 5.3 together with clause 2.4.2 allows the axis 
distance a to be increased by ∆a (instead of 15mm for wires and strands) if θcr is greater than 
350°C and less than 500°C as
∆ = a 0.1 ( ) 500 − θcr mm (5.33)

e.g. if θcr=500°C, ∆a=0mm therefore a is not increased. But if θcr=400°C, ∆a=10mm a
should be increased by only 10mm.
The critical temperature in the tendons θcr is obtained from BS EN 1992-1-2, Fig. 5.1, or

The fire load ratio ηfi =Ed,fi/Ed is given in BS EN 1992-1-2, clause 2.4.2, is the least of Code’s 
Expressions 2.5a or 2.5b for the following load combinations.

Exp. 2.5a        η = fi ( ) G Q k k + ψ1 G ( ) ζγ G Q k k + γ Q (5.37b)
where γG =1.35, ζγG =1.25 and γQ =1.5. Refer to Table 3.1 for values of ψ0 and ψ1.
BS EN 1992-1-2, clause 2.4.2 (4) states that as only thermal deformations across the cross 
section need be considered, and axial and in-plane expansions are ignored, ηfi may be taken 
as MEd,fi/MEd.
For example, if the fire load ratio in a beam is Ed,fi/Ed =0.60, and the area ratio Ap,req/
Ap,prov=1.00, kp(θcr)=0.6×1/1.15=0.522, θcr=594.4–444.4×0.522=362°C and ∆a=13.7mm. 
Therefore for R 90 fire rating axis distance needs to be a≥35+13.7=48.7mm. For a greatly 
under-designed beam (greater area of tendons have been provided than required), the area 
ratio might be say 0.70, then kp(θcr)=0.365, θcr=432oC, ∆a=6.8mm, and a≥41.8mm.
Note that clause 5.2 (7) states that the ∆a method is not applicable to simply supported 
floor slabs, Table 5.8 is excluded. However it is known that MRd,fi calculated using the fire￾moment method given in BS EN 1992-1-2, clause 4.2 and Figure B.2 gives similar (or better) 
results. Therefore the ∆a method may be used to achieve the same result.
Note that BS EN 1992-1-2, clause E.2 (2) states that the simplified calculations given by 
Eq. 5.26 or 5.29 provide an extension to the use of Tables 5.5–5.11. The calculations deter￾mine bending resistance for situations where the axis distance a to bottom reinforcement is 
less than required from the tables, and Exp. 5.2 (5) for ∆a.
5.5.3 Floor slabs
The fire resistance of solid, ribbed, one-way spanning slabs, etc. is given in BS EN 1992-1-2, 
Section 5.7. Common Rules for Precast Elements BS EN 13369 clause 4.4.4.2 states tabu￾lated data can be found in EN 1992-1-2, but when applicable complementary rules may be 
given in product standards.152 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Floor slabs are required to meet the criterion REI in terms of hs given in BS EN 1992-
1-2, Fig. 5.7 and Table 5.8 to ensure an adequate separating function (Criterion E and I). 
If a load-bearing function (Criterion R) is required alone the necessary slab thickness h1, 
assumed for design to BS EN 1992-1-1, may be taken. Values for hs and axis distance a are 
according to Table 5.11 for simply supported one-way spanning slabs and for the top flanges 
of double-tee units (based on BS EN 1992-1-2, Table 5.8).
5.5.4 Solid plank and hollow core units
The fire resistance of prestressed concrete hcu is a function of depth h and mean axis dis￾tance a. Depth h corresponds with the minimum solid floor thickness given in Table 5.8 of 
BS EN 1992-1-2, and has been calculated using a conversion equation for hcu as te=h√ζ
where h=actual depth and ζ=ratio of solid material (including filled joints) to the whole. 
This explains the differences of depth required for solid units and hcu in Table 5.11, e.g. 
a certain 150mm depth hcu has a fire rating of R 60 compared with a solid slab of R 180. 
This is because the voids occupy 40% of the gross cross-sectional area and therefore ζ=0.6. 
A solid slab of equivalent depth √0.6×150=116mm would have a rating of R 90. Note that 
the data in BS EN 1168, Table G.1 are for siliceous gravel aggregates: granite, sandstone, 
greywacke perform no worse. If calcareous or dolomitic limestone is used the dimensions h
and a may be increased by 10%. For example, a 150mm deep hcu made of limestone aggre￾gate with h=1.1×150=165mm has a rating of R 90. The data given in BS EN 1992-1-2 and 
BS EN 1168 are therefore still appropriate to isolated simply supported units with no inher￾ent longitudinal or transverse boundary conditions representative of floor panels tied into 
internal or peripheral beams.
Over the past 20years, there has been a huge effort to establish the behaviour of pre￾stressed hcu, both as isolated units and in floor panels, exposed to fire, culminating in a 
European research project led by BIBM (Bureau International du Beton Manufacture) and 
IPHA (International Prestressed Hollow Core Association), known as ‘Holcofire’. The proj￾ect leader Wim Jansze (of Consolis and IPHA) presented and coordinated the report (BIBM/
IPHA, 2014), which included
i. a state-of-the-art review, database and analysis of 162 laboratory fire tests carried out 
between 1966 and 2010
ii. the results from fire tests to validate the shear and anchorage capacity of hcu (i) under 
restrained conditions (i.e. with longitudinal and/or transversal steel tie bars), and (ii)

Rotterdam in 2007 (Efectis Nederland 2007, TNO Bouw en Onderground 2008)
iv. the shear capacity of hcu on flexible supports, such as shallow steel beams, but the 
conclusions were similar to hcu on rigid supports
v. a simulation model for buckling and horizontal web cracking
Figure 5.25 shows a photograph of the soffit of a prestressed hcu subjected to a standard 
ISO 834 fire (ISO 834-1 1999), with a soffit temperature of 1050°C after 122 minutes, 
which was later tested to shear failure as part of the Holcofire project. The original colour 
photograph shows a slight discolouration (pinking) of parts of the soffit and a tiny patch of 
exposed aggregate.
The most significant findings of the state-of-the-art review are summarised in Figure 
5.26, showing the relationship between the calculated shear capacity VRd,c,fi (y axis) accord￾ing to BS EN 1168, Annex G.1.3 and the failure shear capacity in 42 fire tests. Data lying 
above the 1:1 line are considered to be unsafe, of which there are 20 in number. However, 
12 of these had been carried out using ‘double-web’ hcu, i.e. units split along the line of two 
cores. Although the side webs were insulated from fire there was no two-dimensional system 
effect that is present in full 1.2m wide units, or full floor panels arresting deformation by 
horizontal blocking.
Tests from 31 no. single slabs (i.e. 1200mm wide hcu) and 102 no. tests on floor systems 
(I.e. hcu bearing onto supporting beams, similar to those shown in Figure 5.27) all lie below 
Figure 5.25 The soffit of a prestressed hcu and supporting beam after 122 minutes of a standard ISO fire 
(courtesy BIBM/IPHA).154 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
the 1:1 line in the safe zone. It is not surprising to find that ‘double-web’ hcu have so-called 
‘unsafe’ shear failures:- a significant observation made in all hollow core fire tests is the pres￾ence of vertical splitting cracks in the webs in a region of high shear force. These are due to 
a thru-thickness non-linear temperature gradient causing differential expansion, resulting in 
compression in the top and bottom flanges and compatibility tension in the webs, reducing 
Figure 5.26 Relationship between calculated shear capacity according to BS EN 1168, Annex G and shear 
load in fire tests reported by BIBM/IPHA (Fig. 2.12 in BIBM/IPHA, 2014) (courtesy BIBM/IPHA).
Figure 5.27 Arrangement of hollow core floor slabs in two (out of 6) fire tests under shear load with trans￾verse tie beams reported by BIBM (Fig. 3.4 in BIBM/IPHA, 2014) (courtesy BIBM/IPHA).Materials, durability and fire resistance 155
the principal tensile capacity of the concrete in the webs (Van Acker, 2010). Double-web 
units would therefore be susceptible to such splitting cracks as deformation would not be 
arrested by horizontal blocking in these test specimens.
Figure 5.27 shows two of the seven floor system fire test arrangements as part of the 
‘Holcofire’ project. Five tests have longitudinal steel tie bars, representing either gable edge 
tie beams or the presence of adjacent units, and transverse support beams. Two tests have 
50mm structural topping reinforced using A142mesh. The floors were 3.9m in length, 
2.4m width and h=265mm depth. Shear loads were activated in the furnace for at least 120 
minutes at a distance of 2.5h from the support. Test G6 is not structurally connected to the 
support beam; however, the hcu are tied at their ends using 2 no. 12mm diameter hairpin 
bars cast insitu into the longitudinal joint. G7 therefore represents a typical floor system. 
One test had hairpin bars cast into 4 no. top opened cores.
Prior to the fire tests 10 no. hcu were tested under ambient conditions (referred to as ‘cold’ 
in BS EN 1168, Annex G) returning an average test shear capacity of Vu,cold =218.3 kN/m 
width. The design value according to BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 6.4 is VRd,c,cold =97.3 kN/m 
width. Thus the ratio Vu,cold/VRd,c,cold =2.24 is not unexpected for hcu of this depth. The 
maximum shear reaction measured in the fire tests ranged from Vu,fi =82.5–134.7 kN/m 
width, such that Vu,fi/VRd,c,cold =0.78–1.38 with an average of 1.09. As the design data for 
the ratio VRd,c,fi/VRd,c,cold given in Annex C, Table G.2 for this slab at 120 minutes is 0.55 
is a characteristic value, then the test ratio should also be characteristic – but this is not 
possible due to the test parameters all being different. Note that the ratios in Table G.2 
include for an area of longitudinal tie steel of 188mm2/m (based on 2 no H12 bars per 
unit), whereas the tie steel in the tests was less than this. However, it is unlikely that the 
characteristic value associated with the lowest test ratio of 0.78 would not be less than 0.55. 
Therefore it is concluded that Table G.2 is conservative, at least for the depth of hcu and 
fire period in these tests, and using the formula will result in a more optimal design. Finally, 
the calculated shear capacity in fire, according to Annex G.1.3 at 120 minutes, varied from 
VRd,c,fi =40.7–63.7 kN/m width, such that Vu,fi/VRd,c,fi =1.58–2.66 with an average of 2.09. 
The results show considerable reserve of shear strength compared with VRd,c,fi. Table 5.12 
summarises the data in Annex G, Table G.2. To conclude, the Holcofire project confirmed 
the shear capacity according to BS EN 1168.
The UK BRE carried out two fire tests in 2001 on floor assemblies comprising 5 
no. × 6.0 m span × 200 mm depth hcu (self-weight 2.67 kN/m2) with a 50 mm structural 
topping in Test 1 and 500 mm long hooked end rebars in the longitudinal joints Test 2 
(Lennon, 2003). Axis distance to 9.3 mm diameter strands was based on 40 mm cover for 
2 hours fire resistance according to BS 8110, Part 2 (BS 8110, 1985), then a = 44.6 mm. 
Subjecting the slabs to at least 60 minutes exposure, under an imposed UDL of 3.66 kN/
m2, there was no loss of bearing capacity, minimal spalling to the soffit, and the results 
of temperature profiles were in agreement with BS EN 1992-1-2, Annex A for compart￾ment temperature. Using load factors with ψ1 = 1 and ultimate design based on Eurocodes

for R 120 minutes the author has calculated: MEd,fi = 28.5 kNm/m <MRd,fi = 34.5 kNm/m; 
VEd,fi = 18.1 kN/m width < VRd,c,fi = 0.6 × 62.3 = 37.4 kNm/m; confirming that the slabs 
should not have failed in bending or shear.
Example 5.4
Calculate the shear capacity VRd,c,fi and moment of resistance MRd,fi in a fire situation for 
the 1200×265mm depth prestressed hcu shown in cross section in Figure 5.14 exposed 
to 120 minutes fire. The hcu is similar to that in the ‘Holcofire’ tests and is pretensioned 
using 6 no. 12.5mm diameter strands (area Ap =93mm2) stressed to 70%×1770 N/
mm2 =1239 N/mm2 at 50mm axis distance from the soffit. Use fck =40 N/mm2, siliceous 
gravel aggregates, 70mm bearing length, height to centroid yb =126mm. Assume that 
the final loss of prestress is 20%. Ep for strands is 195000 N/mm2. The ultimate moment 
of resistance MRd =168.7 kNm. Self-weight of hcu including infilled joints=3.93 kN/m2. 
The floor has an effective span of 8.0m and is subjected to imposed dead and live UDL of 
3.0 and 5.0 kN/m2, respectively. Use office loading with ψ1 =0.5.
Note that the axis distance of 50mm suggests that ∆a=10mm, i.e. from Table 5.8 
a=40mm, therefore ∆a=50−40=10mm. However, the results from the fire tests and the 
fire moment calculation show that this is adequate.
Solution
Service UDL ws=(3.93+3.0)+5.0=11.93 kN/m2
Ultimate UDL (Exp. 6.10b of BS EN 1990) wEd =1.25×6.93+1.5×5.0=16.15 kN/m2
Ultimate moment MEd =1.2×16.15×8.02/8=155.0 kNm per unit.
Shear span=8.0–2×(0.07/2+0.126)=7.678m
Ultimate shear force VEd =1.2×16.15×7.678/2=74.4 kN.
Shear capacity check
BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 6.4 gives VRd,c,cold =121.3 kN. Table 5.12 gives VRd,c,fi =0.55 
VRd,c,cold =66.7 kN. The ultimate shear force in a fire situation VEd,fi =ηfi VEd, where the 
reduction factor ηfi is according to BS EN 1992-1-2, Exp. 2.5b as
ηfi = + G Q k k ψ ξ 1 G ( ) γ + G Q k k γ Q (5.37b)
i.e. ηfi =frequent load/ultimate load
η = ( ) ++× ( )  
 fi 3.93 3.0 0.5 5.0 /16.15 = = 9.43 /16.15 0.584
VEd,fi =0.584×74.4=43.4 kN<66.7 kN. OK
Ultimate moment of resistance check
The first check is whether the bottom zone of the hcu may be classed as a solid section 
as defined in BS EN 1168, Fig. G.1. If the tendons are located in a zone of depth a50%, 
i.e. the height at which the sum of the widths of the cores is 50% of the total width of 
the slab (50%×1200=600mm, or 120m per core) the temperature around the strands 
may be assumed to be equal to that of a solid section. The profile of the hcu used in the 
‘Holcofire’ tests gives this height as a50% ≈70 mm>50mm axis distance to strands is 
satisfactory.
Method 1
The moment of resistance in a fire situation MEd,fi is calculated using BS EN 1992-1-2, 
Section 4.2 and Annex B. The ultimate moment of resistance MRd,fi for a prestressed 
section is approached in the same way as a reinforced section, i.e. the final pre-strain Materials, durability and fire resistance 157
after losses in the strands is not additive to the compatibility strain. The ultimate design 
moment MEd =155.0 kNm per unit. Then MEd,fi =0.584×155.0=90.5 kNm.
BS EN 1992-1-2, Fig. A.2 gives the temperature at the level of the tendons at a=50mm 
for R120 minutes as θs=385°C. The temperature of the concrete at the top of the slab is 
taken as θc=160°C, based on BS EN 1168, Annex G.1.2.
BS EN 1992-1-2, Fig. 4.1 gives the concrete strength reduction factor
kc ( ) θ = 0.97 for θ =c 160°C
Then fck( ) θ = 0.97 × = 40 38.8 N/mm2
(Note that the result of the calculation is the same if kc(θ) is ignored.)
BS EN 1992-1-2, Fig. 4.3, curve 1a gives the Class A tendon strength reduction factor
θs = ° 385 C
kp( ) θ = 0.524
Then fp( ) θ = 0.524 × = 1770 926.7 N/mm2

MRd,fi =Fp(θ) z(θ)=517100×204.3/106 =105.6 kNm>90.5 kNm. OK.
Note that in order to achieve MRd,fi =MEd,fi =90.5 kNm, the axis distance may be reduced 
to a=44.8mm, i.e. ∆a=4.8mm. For this situation θs=431oC, kp(θ)=0.438, fp(θ)=775.2

Method 2
Using BS EN 1992-1-2, Annex E, Exp. E.3
Eq. 5.29 MRd,fi =γp kp(θ) (Ap,prov/Ap,req) MEd
The area of strands Ap,req to satisfy MEd =MRd =155.0 kNm can be achieved in one of 2 
ways (i) by trial and error inputting Ap,req (but as shown in Chapter 9, Section 9.4.1 it is 
too complex to back-calculate Ap,req from MRd) or (ii) approximation using traditional 
bending design and assuming a value for the limiting strength of strands.
By (i) it is found that Ap,req =511mm2
By (ii)
K=155.0×106/(40×1200×2152)=0.070
z=215 min{0.95; (0.5+√(0.25−0.070/1.134))}=200.8mm
x=(215−200.8)/0.4=35.5mm (level with the top flange=35mm)158 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

Total εp =0.222780, but>eud =0.02
fp =1517 N/mm2
 Then Ap,req =155.0×106/200.8×1517=509mm2. Remarkably close to 511mm2. Then 
588 / 509 = 1.15 < 1.3.
 Eq. 5.29 MRd,fi =1.15×0.524×(588/509)×155.0=102.4 kNm>90.5 kNm (compared 
with 105.6 kNm in Method 1)
Then 588 / 509 = 1.15 < 1.3.
The condition may also be checked using Eq. 5.30, MEd/MRd ≤γs kp(θ)/ηf
MEd MRd = = 155.0 /168.7 0.918
γ θ s f kp( ) / 1 η = .15 0 × = .524 / 0.584 1.032. OK
It is interesting to note that in the ‘Holcofire’ tests without a structural topping the 
maximum bending moment (beneath the applied load) was 102 kNm per unit, in good 
agreement with the predicted MRd,fi =105.6 or 102.4 kNm above. No bending failure was 
reported in the tests.
Finally, for θ=160°C and siliceous gravel aggregates, the strain in the concrete at the 
top of the hcu is given in BE EN 1992-1-2, Table 3.1 as εc1,θ=0.0049.
The compatibility strain in the strands is εpu,θ=εc1,θ (d−X(θ))/X(θ). But note that to 
achieve a lever arm z(θ)=0.95d the depth to the neutral axis is
X d ( ) θ = ( ) 1 0 − = .95 / 0.4 0.125d.
Therefore
X( ) θ = 0.125 × = 215 26.9 mm n( ) ot13.9 mm from above .

5.5.5 T beams in beam and block flooring
5.5.5.1 General considerations
The fire resistance of beam and block flooring, REI, is a function of the behaviour of both 
prestressed concrete beams and the infill blocks, and in certain cases whether a reinforced 
screed is present. Solid concrete blocks, known as semi-resisting (SR), contribute to the 
structural system, give fire protection to the narrow upstand of beams, and therefore the 
width of beams in BS EN 1992-1-2, Table 5.5 is based on the width at the soffit, or for 
beams with tapered sides at the top of the flange, e.g. single 150mm beams with a soffit 
width of 92mm or 88mm at the top of the flange; double beams, grouted together, having a 
soffit width of 184mm or 180mm at the top of the flange, and so on. Figure 5.28 shows the 
equivalent profile of the exposed soffit of a double beam and fire-resistant blocks.Materials, durability and fire resistance 159
Polystyrene (EPS) blocks do not offer fire protection to the narrow upstand of beams and 
therefore the mean width of the upstand, e.g. 45mm for 150mm deep beams, is limiting 
with zero fire resistance. However, there are special recommendations in BS EN 15037-1, 
Annex K, for both of these situations. Clause K4.1 refers to the calculation in BS EN 1992-
1-2 for bending resistance (shear resistance is not necessary). Clause K.5 and Table K.1 pro￾vide tabulated data based on tests of floor systems. The integrity criteria I require a screed 
reinforced with steel mesh.
In BS EN 1992-1-2 T beams are classed as beams and critical nominal axis distance a
and minimum width bmin are given in Table 5.5. Clause 5.2 (5) states that 15mm should 
be added to a and clause 5.2 (7) states that 15mm may be replaced using ∆a in the Code’s 
Exp. 5.3 (see Section 5.5.2, Eqs. 5.33 to 5.35). As before, a=mean axis distance to centroid 
of tendons according to area (not prestressing force) in the tension zone. The beams are 
pretensioned with more than one row of wires (typically 3 or 4) so the additional side axis 
distance asd is not applicable.
Web thickness class is given in the NA to BS EN 1992-1-2 as WA in clause 5.6.1 (1). 
If fire-resistant blocks are specified the web thickness is replaced by the width of bottom 
flange. The required a and bmin may be reduced by 10% for calcareous aggregates, accord￾ing to clause 5.1 (2). For multiple layers of wires, amin ≥half the average a according to clause 
5.2 (17), e.g. if cover to 5mm diameter wires=20mm, amin =22.5mm and therefore average 
a≤45mm (see Example 5.5).
The examples below are based on single or alternate single/double beams of 150mm 
depth. For double, triple or quad beams, multiply the widths by 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 
Multiple beams should be touching and grouted between the webs
• For 30 minutes with bmin =88mm at top of the bottom flange, a≥25+15*=40mm or 
40/1.1≥36mm for limestone, with amin ≥20 or 18mm. Web width (upstand)≥80mm 
(or 73mm using limestone) unless protected by fire-resistant solid blocks where bot￾tom flange width is used.
• For 60 minutes beams with bmin =88mm do not comply (<100mm required). Double 
beams with grout between the beams bmin =2×88+4=180 mm>100mm, do comply.
Tables 5.13a and 5.13b give a summary of the fire resistance for combinations of beams, 
blocks and allowable spans for siliceous gravel and limestone aggregates, respectively. 
Note there are situations where the maximum span is governed by deflection, a function 
of Ecm, and as this is reduced by 10% for limestone the maximum spans may be reduced 
in Table 5.13b.

Beams with polystyrene blocks are governed by the average web width bw (in Table 
5.5)=45mm and 83mm for 150 and 225mm deep beams, respectively. 150mm deep single 
beams do not comply as bw <80mm. 225mm deep single beams comply with R 30 minutes. 
Some 150mm deep double beams are grouted in the 47mm wide gap between the beams 
where bw =45+92=137mm and comply with R 60 minutes, but still have to be checked for 
axis distance.
5.5.5.2 Fire resistance based on BS EN 15037-1
For beam and semi-resisting block floors with a cast insitu structural topping, the fire-resis￾tance in BS EN 15037-1, clause K.5 and Table K.1, and clause B2.3 is satisfied if (i) beam 
centres are less than 700mm, (ii) topping is 40mm minimum thickness, (iii) reinforced with

and clear span≤6.0m. Toppings of less than 50mm are not used in practice. The mechanical

Block types Resistance (mins)
Polystyrene (over crawl spaces only) 30
Hollow concrete or clay 30
Solid concrete or clay 60
The data for non-solid blocks conflicts with BS EN 1992-1-2 for beams having less than 
80 mm width of web, which have zero fire rating, irrespective of the positions of wires. 
This applies to 150 deep beams used singly.
Example 5.5
Determine the fire resistance for single and double 150 mm deep beams with 440 mm 
fire-resistant concrete infill blocks of 1950 kg/m3 density. The cross section of the 
beam and the positions of wires are shown in Figure 5.29. Due to 4 mm taper of 
the bottom flange bmin at the top of the flange is 88 mm. At the ultimate limit state 
the area of three tendons in the tension zone Ap = 58.9 mm2 at a centroidal height of 
(2 × 22.5 + 40)/3 = 28.3 mm from the soffit, stressed to 75% of pyk = 1770 N/mm2. Use 
fck = 55 N/mm2 and siliceous gravel aggregates. The floor is subjected to dead UDL 
gk = 1.50 kN/m2 and live UDL qk = 1.50 kN/m2 over a simply supported span of 4.0 m. 
Use residential loading with ψ1 = 0.5 and ψ0 = 0.7. Average beam spacing is 488 and 
290 mm, and the self-weight of beam and blocks is 2.173 and 2.385 kN/m2 for single 
and double beams, respectively.

Single 150mm beams. Double beams in brackets.

Frequent live load=0.5×1.50=0.75 kN/m2
Fire UDL wd,fi =3.673+0.75=4.423 kN/m2. (4.635)
Ultimate UDL wEd =1.25×3.673+1.5×1.5=6.841 kN/m2. (7.101)
Fire load ratio ηfi =4.423/6.841=0.647. (0.653)
MEd,cold =0.488×6.841×4.02/8=6.67 kNm per beam. (4.12)
d=150−28.3=121.7mm
Kcold =6.67×106/(55×42×121.72)=0.195. (0.120)
z=93.8mm and x=70.8mm. (106.5; 38.5)
Total strain εp =0.006964 from which fp =1387 N/mm2. (0.011474; 1432)
Ap,req =6.67×106/(93.8×1387)=51.3mm2. (27.0)
Ap,req/Ap,prov=51.3/58.9=0.871. (0.458)
kp(θcr)=0.647×0.871/1.15=0.49. (0.26)
θcr=594.4–444.4×0.49=377°C. (478°C)
∆a=0.1 (500-377)=12.3mm. (2.1)
For MEd,fi =0.647×6.67=4.32 kNm, Kfi =0.126 and xfi =40.7mm from the top of the beam 
or 109.3mm from the soffit, allowing four wires to contribute to the fire axis distance.
Average axis distance to four wires beneath the neutral axis in a fire situation 
amean =(2×22.5+40+75)/4=40mm.
Axis height amin =22.5>amean /2=40/2=20mm. OK
Therefore, net axis distance a=amean −∆a=40−12.3=27.7mm (37.9)
Single beam
Check whether a=27.7mm is adequate according to BS EN 1992-1-2, Table 5.5. The 
effective width of beam is at the top of the bottom flange bmin =88mm because the 
upstand is protected by the blocks.
For R 30, bmin ≥80mm, a≥25mm. OK
For R 60, bmin ≥120mm, a≥40mm. Fails on both criteria.
Final resistance=R 30.
To achieve R 60 according to BS EN 15037-1, Annex K, 40mm minimum thickness rein￾forced screed with steel mesh or fibres is required.

If the temperatures in rows 2 and 3 were taken as 400°C, rather than extrapolating 
below 400oC, then MRd,fi =4.74 kNm still>4.32 kNm.
Double beam
Check whether a=37.9mm is adequate, bmin =(2×92) – 4=180mm (the joint between 
beams is grouted)
For R 30, bmin ≥160mm, a≥15mm. OK
For R 60, bmin ≥160mm, a≥35mm. OK
For R 90, bmin ≥150mm, a≥55mm. Fails on axis distance.
Final resistance=R 60.
It is not possible to calculate MRd,fi for R 60 as accurately as R 30 above as there are no 
temperature profiles for beams with a 50mm deep bottom flange. However, if the con￾crete blocks offer a lower, but nonetheless active fire resistance, Fig. A.4 may be used for 
a 300×160mm deep beam. The R 60 contours are used for the first and second rows of 
wires at a=22.5 and 40mm, and the third row at a=75mm is estimated. Note that for 
double beams the side axis distance for one of the wires in row 1 is asd =90−23=67mm.

5.5.6 Main beams
The fire resistance of reinforced and prestressed beams are required to meet the struc￾tural criterion R (only) in terms of minimum width of beam bmin, width of web bw and 
mean axis distance amean according to BS EN 1992-1-2, Section 5.6. For non-rectangular 
beams, such as tapered or I section beams, beam width is defined in BS EN 1992-1-2, 
Fig. 5.4. To avoid spalling of shallow bottom flanges the effective height deff ≥ d1 + 0.5 
d2 ≥ bmin where bmin is according to Table 5.14. There are some other modifications nec￾essary to a for narrow webs and for shallow bottom flanges given in BS EN 1992-1-2, 
Exp. 5.10. The calculation for multiple bars amean = am = Σ Asi ai/ Σ Asi (1–4) and at the 
side asd,m = Σ Asi ai/Σ Asi (5–8) is as illustrated in Figure 5.30. The rebar in the middle of 
the bottom row may be included in asd,m although technically its influence is less than the 
outer bars and it is shared with asd,m from the other side. When reinforcement consists 
of rebars and tendons with different characteristic strength Asi should be replaced by Asi
fyki (or Asi fpki).
There is a major division of data between simply supported and continuous beams. 
Options for the least values of bmin in combination with amean and are summarised in Table 
5.14 for simply supported beams (BS EN 1992-1-2, Table 5.5). The axis distance a to pre￾stressing tendons given in Table 5.14 should be increased according to BS EN 1992-1-2, 
clause 5.2 (5).

The ‘special’ check according to clause 5.2 (7) allows the increase in a, known as ∆a, to be 
reduced according to the ratio of the fire load Ed,fi to the ultimate load Ed and the ratio of the 
area of reinforcement required/provided, e.g. if MEd,fi =80 kNm and MEd =125 kNm, and if the 
designed area of strands Ap,req =280mm2 and 6 no. 9.3mm strands Ap,prov=6×52=312mm2
are provided, then the stress used to evaluate the critical temperature of reinforcement 
σp(θ)=(1770/1.15)×(80/125)×(280/312)=884 N/mm2. Then kp(θ)=0.50, θcr=372°C and 
∆a=12.8mm, a reduction of 2.2mm from the maximum.
The axis distance to the side of beam for the corner bars (or tendon or wire) of beams with 
only one layer of reinforcement is asd =a+10mm. No increase is required for values of bmin
greater than those in the third column of options (from the left) in Table 5.14, e.g. for R 60 
if bmin =200mm then asd =30+10=40mm, but if bmin =250mm then asd =30mm.
Example 5.6
Determine the mean axis distance a required for a 300mm wide prestressed con￾crete beam having R 120 minutes fire resistance. The beam is subjected to dead UDL 
Gk =40 kN/m and live UDL Qk =30 kN/m. The area of tendons required is known to be 
Ap,req =1000mm2. Use 12.5mm diameter strands of 94mm2 per strand with pyk =1770 N/
mm2. Use office loading with ψ1 =0.5 and ψ0 =0.7.
Solution
Ap,req =1000mm2. Number of strands required>1000/94=10.6
Use 11 no. Ap,prov=11×94=1034mm2
Ap,required/Ap, provided =1000/1034=0.967
wEd,fi =40+0.5×30=55.0 kN/m
wEd =max{1.35×40+0.7×1.5×30; 1.25×40+1.5×30}={85.5; 95.0}=95.0 kN/m
ηfi =55.0/95.0=0.579
σp(θ)=0.579×(1770/1.15)×0.967=862 N/mm2.
kp(θcr)=862/1770=0.487 (note this can be reached by 0.579×0.967/1.15=0.487)
Then if kp(θcr)=0.1 to 0.55, θcr=594.4−444.4 kp(θcr)=594.4−444.4×0.487=378°C
∆a=0.1 (500 −378)=12.2mm
From Table 5.14 for R 120, use bmin =300mm, a=55+12.2=67.2mm
The first row of strands (5 no.) could be placed at a=40mm, second and third rows (3 
each) at 80 and 120mm giving a=(5×40+3×80+3×120)/11=72 mm>67.2mm.
Check amin =40 mm>a/2=72/2=36mm. OK.

Chapter 6
Prestressing and detensioning stresses
6.1 CHOICE OF INITIAL PRESTRESS
Prestressing aims to induce a flexural compressive stress in those parts of precast concrete 
elements where tension would otherwise exist due to external loads and, in some instances, 
internal effects such as thermal restraint and/or shrinkage. If a slab or beam is simply sup￾ported and subjected to gravity loads, then compressive stress is induced into the bottom 
of the section, and vice versa for a cantilever that is at the top of the section. Figure 6.1 
shows the basic principles. Prestressing to induce axial compressive stress is also possible, 
but less common, for example, in lintels containing a single strand or a couple of wires, by 
positioning the tendons at the centroid of the concrete section, theoretically of course, but 
as close as is practically possible. Figure 6.2 shows the basic principles. Prestressing induces 
compressive stress in order to
i. reduce or nullify tensile stress, or the flexural tensile stress ft
 if the section is subjected 
to bending, or combined bending and axial tension.
ii. increase the flexural stiffness of the section by preventing cracking when ft
 exceeds the 
mean value of the flexural tensile strength of concrete, defined in BS EN 1992, Part 
1-1 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004), clause 3.1.6 as fctm,fl. However, this value is seldom used 
in design in favour of the mean axial tensile strength defined in clauses 3.1.2 (9) and 
Table 3.1 as fctm. Preventing cracking allows deflections to be calculated using the flex￾urally uncracked cross section, which is the major advantage of prestressed concrete 
over reinforced concrete.
iii. reduce downward deflections by inducing an upward deflection, known as camber, 
to nullify deflections due to gravity loads. In perfect conditions, the final deflection 
is about span/1000, although this changes over the lifetime of an element because of 
creep and other changes in the elastic modulus of concrete. Inducing compressive stress 
on the top of a cantilever has the same effect, just reversed.
iv. increase the shear capacity of a section that is flexurally uncracked due to (ii) to a point 
where shear reinforcement, in the form of designed shear stirrups or less commonly 
bent-up rebars, may not be required. The term may means that links may be provided 
even though they are not required in design, e.g. at the ends of beams and at bearings 
where localised tensile and/or splitting forces are present.
v. increase the torsional capacity of a section likewise, although the savings in closed 
torsional stirrups may be small.
vi. improve the handling and lifting of long slender sections, such as tall columns or thin 
panels, by preventing cracking as in (ii) using axial prestress.Prestressing and detensioning stresses 169

In tests, fctm is obtained by splitting a cylinder across its diagonal (so-called Brazilian test). 
The tensile stress is (almost) uniform over the diameter of the cylinder and is able to find 
points of weakness anywhere in its path. However, fctm,fl is obtained by subjecting a pris￾matic section (usually 500mm long×150mm square) to four-point bending (two point loads 
and two supports) under hydraulic load until the prism cracks suddenly at a peak load. The 
concrete is only fully in tension at the bottom fibre, reducing rapidly to zero at the centroid 
of the prism and thereafter it is in compression. The resulting strength is greater than fctm
because there are fewer points of weakness at the bottom of the prism and in the mid-span 
region where failure occurs. For this reason, the ratio of fctm,fl/fctm is typically 1.4–1.5, reduc￾ing as the prism is deeper and the tensile stress gradient shallower.
The aim of prestressing is also to satisfy the dual requirements of
a. limiting concrete compressive and tensile stresses when the pretensioning forces in the 
tendons are first released into the concrete, typically at the age of 12–24hours when 
the concrete has a compressive strength fck(t). See Chapter 4 for the techniques used. 
Known as ‘detensioning’ or ‘transfer’, BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 8.10 refers to ‘transfer 
of prestress’ and sets out guidance for its success, e.g. clear distances between ten￾dons, anchorage of tendons, avoidance of tensile stress causing cracking or splitting, 
as shown in Figures 6.3 and 6.4. Transfer stresses are calculated at the ends of the 
elements where bending stresses due to self-weight are zero. However, because the 
build-up of prestress from zero at the end of the element to a maximum at a point at 
the end of the transmission zone, when the element lifts off the casting bed opposing 
stresses due to self-weight reduce the transfer stresses a little and may, if the designer 
wishes (particularly in longer elements) be used. The ‘point’ in question is at the ‘basic’ 
transmission length lpt (see also Section 10.2.2 for the derivation). See Example 6.1. lpt
is typically 400–650mm depending on the diameter of the tendons.
b. limiting the final (in service) compressive and tensile stresses in the section due to the 
addition, or combined effects of prestress and imposed bending stresses, as well as 
satisfying the ultimate limit state of bending and shear (and maybe torsion) due to 
ultimate loads.

Point (b) provides an internal couple with a magnitude MP =P zcp at least equal to, and often 
greater than, the externally imposed serviceability bending moment Ms at a particular cross 
section of the element, as shown in Figure 6.5. Here P is the force in the tendons at any 
time after casting. Of course, the MP is much greater than that which is required closer to 
the supports (in a simply supported span) and has to be checked when the concrete is at an 
early age, e.g. at transfer. The buildup of MP from the end of the slab is known to be roughly 
parabolic, although BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 8.17 shows it as linear. Defining and measuring 
the transmission length and build-up of stress is difficult and variable, as reflected in the 
widely different values given in international codes. It has been the subject of extensive stud￾ies, most of which are summarised by Kong (Kong, 1993).
To satisfy (a) and (b) simultaneously, for given spans, loads, concrete strength at transfer 
and in service, the positions of the tendons in the cross section may not be the same for (a) 
and (b). This means two different arrangements of tendons are required, achieved either 
by deflecting tendons, as shown in Figure 6.6, or by debonding tendons, using sheathes or 
similar to break the bond with concrete, as shown in Figure 6.6. Although debonded ten￾dons still have the same position in the cross section their ‘effective’ position, i.e. centroid 
of pretensioning force, is different. The distance to the debond/deflect point depends on the 
service bending moment distribution, and the relative strengths fck and fck(t), but for the case 
of uniformly distributed loading and say fck(t)=⅔fck the distance is about ¼ span. The exact 
distance can be back-calculated from the bending moments at transfer and in service, or 
the designer may choose to debond/deflect at ¼ span and arrange the tendons to suit. The

length of the sheath should be one transmission length lpt before the theoretical debonding 
point to allow the prestress to develop. This procedure is explained in Section 8.1 by using 
the Magnel diagram. Debonding may also take place at two points from the ends (as shown 
in Figure 6.6) to further optimise the moments of resistance with the service moments. 
Deflecting tendons may also be carried out at two points, but this is not common as two 
anchorage devices are required.
Debonding is often the preferred method as it is relatively cheap to provide, whereas 
deflected tendons require anchorages for holding down restraint and other tendons (above 
the deflected tendons) may be in the way. If (a) and (b) cannot be satisfied simultaneously, 
even by increasing fck(t), the imposed bending stresses must be reduced, i.e. the design ser￾vice moment of resistance MsR is less than above. The ultimate moment of resistance MRd
and shear capacity VRd,c (flexurally uncracked section) do not control the positions of the 
tendons – their values are calculated per se, and are not usually the limiting criteria (see 
Chapters 9 and 10).
This is the case with hollow core floor units (hcu) (Figure 2.1) or T beams for beam and 
block flooring (Figure 2.5) where deflecting or debonding tendons is either not possible (e.g. slip 
formed or extruded hcu) or not practised by the manufacturer (e.g. T beams). However, double￾tee floor units (Figure 2.19) may have deflected or debonded tendons readily incorporated to 
increase MsR in these less efficient units compared with hcu of similar depth.
The positions of the tendons, e.g. strands or wires in hcu, are first determined by the 
manufacturer to satisfy (a) at transfer and then to back-calculate the maximum possible 
in-service values of MsR and MRd. This gives what is defined as the ‘highest strand pattern’ 
where both transfer stresses (top and bottom of the section) are at the permitted levels. Also, 
the balance between the limiting concrete stresses at transfer and in service is dictated by the 
maturity of the concrete and the need to de-tension the reinforcement within 12–24hours 
after casting.
The minimum clear spacing s between tendons is given in BS EN 1992-1, Figure 8.14. 
Vertically sv≥dg or 2Φ, and horizontally sh ≥dg+5mm, 2Φ or 20mm, where dg=maximum 
size of coarse aggregate, typically 10 or 14mm in precast elements, and Φ=tendon diameter. 
Therefore, typical centre-centre distances for 12.5mm strands are s≥3Φ=37.5mm, and 
s≥28mm for 9.3mm strands.
The transfer stress, expressed in the usual manner as the characteristic strength fck(t) 
(where (t) symbolises early strength <28days) either as a function of the final concrete 
strength fck according to clause 3.1.2 (5) and (6) or is measured by the manufacturer convert￾ing cube strength to fck(t) according to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.1. The limiting compressive 
strength at the bottom fibre at transfer is according to clause 5.10.2.2 (5)≤0.6 fck(t), and 
more importantly at the top fibre by the tensile strength fctm(t), where defined by clause 3.1.2 
(6) and (9) as
f t ctm c ( ) = f f tm   / cm ( )t fcm (6.1)
For example, fck =45 N/mm2, fcm =45+8=53 N/mm2, fctm =0.3 fck
2/3 =0.3×452/3 =3.80 
N/mm2, fck(t)=30 N/mm2, fcm =30+8=38 N/mm2, then fctm(t)=3.80×38/53=2.72 N/mm2. 
Note that fctm(t) is a lower strength than where fctm is determined for the same strength 
at 28days, i.e. fctm =0.3×302/3 =2.90 N/mm2, 7% greater than fctm(t). This is because in 
maturing concrete at say 20hours, the products of hydration have not developed sufficiently 
to establish the same tensile resistance as concrete at 28days of age. For fck =45 N/mm2
(the typical strength in prestressed elements) fck(t) should be about 28–30 N/mm2 (35–40 
N/mm2 cube strength). Table 4.1 shows the actual relationships between fck(t) and fck at UK 
producers.174 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
6.2 PRETENSIONING AND LOSS OF PRESTRESS
6.2.1 Initial prestress
A typical hollow core slab production factory is shown in Figure 4.4. Steel reinforcement, 
‘tendons’ such as wire or helical strand of total area Ap, is stretched between jacking equip￾ment at either end of long steel beds, about 100–150m long, after which concrete is cast 
around the tendons. The tendons are positioned eccentrically relative to the centroid of the 
section to produce the desired pretensioning stresses shown in Figure 6.1c. The initial pre￾stress σpi (which is set by the manufacturer) is around 70%–75% of the ultimate strength 
fpk =1670 to 1770 N/mm2 for wire and fpk =1750–1860 N/mm2 for strand. The many dif￾ferent types of tendons available (See Table 5.8) simplify to 9.3 and 12.5mm (occasionally 
10.9mm) diameter 7-wire helical strand, or 5 and 7mm diameter plain or indented wire.
6.2.2 Loss of prestress at transfer and in service
The tendons cannot sustain the initial stress for the following reasons:
i. During tensioning, the tendons immediately relax; about 0.5% to 1% of the initial stress 
is lost; some of this may be due to slight slippage of the tendons in the grips. Over the long 
term, the tendons lose a further 2%. The relaxation classification is given as ρ1000 =2.5% for 
relaxation class 2 according to BS EN 1992-1-1, clauses 3.3.2 (6) and (7). The 1000hours 
relaxation test value is provided by the manufacturer or as given in BS 5896 (BS 5896 
2012). The initial relaxation loss at the time of transfer is according to Code Exp. 3.28 to 
3.30. The initial relaxation loss is about 0.5% and is subtracted from the initial prestress 
before further losses are calculated. The final relaxation loss is about 2%.
ii. After the concrete has hardened around the reinforcement and the bars are released 
from the jacking equipment, the force in the bars is transferred to the concrete by 
bond. The concrete shortens elastically – this may be calculated knowing the elastic 
modulus of the concrete at this point in time at transfer. This is called ‘elastic shorten￾ing’ because the reinforcement is obliged to shorten by the same amount as the con￾crete. The stress in the concrete reduces too, by about 4%–6% depending on the total 
prestressing force. Losses (i) and (ii) are called ‘transfer losses’.
iii. Desiccation of the concrete follows, causing a long-term shrinkage loss. This is the product 
of the shrinkage per unit length (about 400×10−6 for indoor and 250×10−6 for outdoor 
exposure) and modulus of elasticity of the tendons Ep =195 kN/mm2 (strand) and 205 kN/
mm2 (wire). This gives a shrinkage loss of between 55 and 70 N/mm2, about 4.0%–5.5%.
iv. Finally, creep strains are allowed for using a specific creep strain (i.e. creep per unit 
length per unit of stress) of about 2.0 for indoor curing and loading at 90days in the 
U.K. Creep affects the tendons in the same manner as elastic shortening because its 
effect is measured at the centroid of the bars, but is also influenced by the shape of the 
element, called notional dimension (or depth or thickness) ho (area-to-perimeter ratio) 
and fck. Hence, the creep loss is about 1.5 times the elastic shortening loss, 7%–9%.
Total losses range from about η=18% to 25% for minimum to maximum levels of prestress. 
There are five stages of prestress
i. initial prestress=σpi
ii. after immediate relaxation of tendons before the tendons are cut or released σr
iii. after initial relaxation and elastic shortening losses=σpm0Prestressing and detensioning stresses 175
iv. after short-term losses at installation=σpmi
v. design effective prestress after all losses=σpo
Note BS EN 1992-1-1 uses σp∞ for the final prestress, and some texts use f for these stresses. 
The final force in the tendons Ppo =Ap σpo.
Table 6.1 gives a range of maximum strand or wire patterns for 1200mm wide hcu, 
2400mm wide composite double-tee slabs and 92–136mm wide T beams (in beam and block 
flooring). Data show the ratio of bottom σb(t) and top σt(t) stresses at transfer divided by 
their respective limiting stresses as σc=0.6 fck(t)=18.0 N/mm2 and σct=fctm(t)=−2.72 N/mm2
(−2.54 N/mm2 for T beams for the reasons explained above), respectively. Stresses at trans￾fer are calculated at a distance lpt from the end of the elements, where the self-weight is 
for a span of 30×depth. They include immediate relaxation and elastic shortening losses 
as calculated in Section 6.2.3. Concrete strength is fck =45 (55 for T beams) N/mm2 and 
fck(t)=30 N/mm2. The initial prestressing force for strand is η=0.7, and 0.75 for T beams 
using 5mm wire, of the characteristic strength pyk =1770 N/mm2. Modulus of elasticity for 
strand is 195 kN/mm2, and for wire, it is 205 kN/mm2.
The results show that transfer stresses are controlled by the limiting stress at the bottom of 
elements, where the average ratio for σb(t)/σc is 0.86 (excluding the 150mm depth hcu in which 
the number of strands is controlled by the number of webs in the section, i.e. 12×9.3mm 
diameter). Apart from two of the hcus the ratio σt
(t)/σct at the top is low, in six cases σt
(t) being 
compressive, thanks to the effect of self-weight at a distance from the support of lt
. The low 
stress in the top is an advantage where the elements may be subjected to vibration and impact 
during transportation, particularly in longer, more highly stressed elements where bearers are 
positioned at some distance from their ends. Note that the strands in the double-tee slabs are 
debonded at ¼ span such that the number of strands at mid-span is greater, e.g. 28 strands in 
the 500mm depth unit. Tendons in hcu and T beams are not debonded.

Note if σb(t)>0.45 fck(t) is considered for the calculation of camber up to the date where 
σb(t)=0.45 fck, which is approximately 3days, and also just at the ends of the unit where ten￾sile stress due to self-weight is small. In these circumstances non-linear creep is negligible.

The positive (compression) stress due to the self-weight of the slab at the end of the basic 
transmission zone may be deducted from the above stress, unless of course the slab is held 
down during transfer by weight packs, thereby nullifying the self-weight stress as the unit 
cambers upwards. Without the weight pack, Eqs. 6.6a and 6.7a become

The basic transmission length is lpt={0.19 (strand) or 0.25 (wire)} σpm0 Φ/fbpt, where the bond 
strength fbpt={3.2 (strand) or 2.7 (wire)}×0.7 fctm(t)/γc. Note that the prestress in the tendons 
σpm0 has to be calculated first to determine lpt. See Section 10.2.2 for full details.
6.2.4 Immediate upward camber due to prestress at transfer
The prestress is assumed to give constant curvature over the full length of the element. This 
is not strictly true where tendons are debonded or deflected, but the differences are small. 
Note that as follows δ1 is based on the actual length of the element whereas δ2 is for the 
effective span, i.e. actual – ½ bearing lengths, but the differences are small, e.g. for the 10m 
hcu in Example 6.1 the difference is 0.5mm or 2% of camber at transfer.
Immediate camber
δ1 0 = − P z pm cpL E / 8 cm ( )t Ic co 2 , (6.8a)
Strictly, the camber should allow for the development of prestress within the basic transmis￾sion length lpt at each end of the unit, then

For typical values of lpt and L, say lpt=500mm and L=6000mm, the reduction in δ1 is 
0.93%, about 0.15–0.3mm in most cases, and is therefore ignored given that variations in 
Ecm(t) can be of the order of ±25% of calculated values.

Note that the second moment of area Ic may take the compound value Ic,co using the trans￾formed area of tendons based on a modular ratio, without creep effects, m=Ep/Ecm. Some 
designers ignore this; the difference is typically 2%–3% reduction in deflection.

The effects of creep and an increase in Ecm, between transfer and installation (at say 
28days), will cause this to increase, as shown in Section 11.2.1.
6.3 PRETENSIONING FORCE AND TENDON ECCENTRICITY IN BEAMS
6.3.1 Types of prestressed beams
The design of prestressed beams is more versatile than for floor slabs because several rows of 
tendons may be used, typically between 4 and 10 (in beams of depth 400–800mm, respec￾tively), although the tendon’s positions are restricted to a predetermined pattern by an array 
of holes in the jacking heads, which is usually a permanent fixture at a precasting work. 
Figure 6.8 shows the end template for an inverted-tee beam with quite a large eccentricity 
from the centre on the tendons to the centroid of the section, resulting in an upward camber 
as shown in Figure 2.7. Upward camber is often controlled by adding two tendons (which 
need not be fully stressed) at the top of the beams. Top tendons also help to avoid cracking 
during transportation and handling.
Rectangular section beams are more efficient in terms of capacity per cross-sectional area, 
but inverted-tee and I beams hold the advantage of allowing the floor slab to be recessed in 
the upper part of the beam.
Figure 6.9a shows a full array of possible tendon positions in an inverted-tee beam and 
an example of a typical tendon layout. Note the symmetry. The tendons are placed at 
all the corners; a 40–50 mm centroidal cover distance is used in most cases. If debonded 
tendons are required to satisfy the transfer conditions and the service or ultimate design 
moments simultaneously, the procedure for calculating the required pretensioning forces 
and eccentricities at positions along the span is as follows. In theory, there may be several Prestressing and detensioning stresses 181
Figure 6.8 Preparation of mould and rebars for prestressed concrete inverted-tee beam.
positions along the span where checks are required, but it is usually to satisfy transfer 
conditions at the support and at ¼ or ⅓ span, and the design moments at mid-span and 
at ¼ or ⅓ span minus the transmission length (or ultimate anchorage length). Figure 6.9b 
shows a typical arrangement of tendons, together with the necessary tendons to anchor 
the shear stirrups (in the upstand) and boot links (in the boot). Note how the tendons 
are staggered in the successive rows to avoid local concentrations of prestress (see also 
Figure 6.20).
6.3.2 Calculation for pretensioning force and eccentricity
It is desirable that the permissible stress at transfer fctm(t) after the initial losses (due to 
elastic shortening) is made equal (or as close as possible) to 0.45 fck after all losses. In 
most beam designs the initial and final losses are about 8% and 25%, respectively, mean￾ing that the ratio fck(t)/fck should be at least 0.55. The transfer strength for fck = 50 is often 
at about 35 N/mm2, and therefore transfer stresses will (nearly) always govern for paral￾lel, unbonded tendons. To overcome this problem some tendons are debonded, starting 
with 2 no. and increasing in multiples of two until transfer and service conditions are 
satisfied. It is also wise to restrict the top fibre stress to something less than fctm(t) say ½
to ⅔ of this value, while accepting that there will be a small loss in moment capacity. This 
factor of safety is based on the experience gained from transporting and handling long 
and/or highly stressed prestressed beams, and the need to avoid flexural cracking at the 
sides of the beams for the sake of durability. During transportation, beams are supported 182 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

on bearers at about 500–750 mm from the ends, and the negative bending moment due to 
self-weight of the cantilevered ends causes tension in the top in addition to the negative 
prestress.
The pretensioning force that takes place at the moment of detensioning includes the 
immediate relaxation ∆σpr of the tendons plus most of the elastic shortening loss ∆σel. The 
loss ratio at transfer is defined here as ξ=(∆σpr+∆σel)/σpi calculated according to Section 
6.2.3, where σpi=η fpk =Ppi/Ap. The loss ratio ∆σpr/σpi for Class 2 strand stressed to 70% and 
detensioned after 20hours, is fixed as 0.66×2.5×e9.1×0.7 ×(20/1000)0.75×(1−0.7)×10−5 =0.004. 
The total loss ratio is first estimated – a figure of 0.07 is a good starting point. The force at 
transfer is therefore Ppi (1−ξ) and the bottom and top fibre stresses are
σ = b ( )t Ppi(1− ξ) 1( ) / / A z c c + < p Z f b c + 0.6 k ( )t (6.10)
σ = t ( )t Ppi(1− ξ) 1( ) / / A z c c − > p c Z f t −0.5 * tm ( )t (6.11)
*it is the designer’s choice to limit the tensile stress to −0.5 fctm(t).
Manipulation of the simultaneous equations Eqs. 6.10 and 6.11 will give optimum values

6.4 BURSTING, SPALLING AND SPLITTING STRESSES
6.4.1 Types of tensile stresses and cracking
The phenomenon of horizontal cracking immediately after transfer, or sometimes shortly after￾wards, either along the line of pretensioned tendons or in narrow webs above the line of tendons, 
is known as bursting, spalling and splitting. Examples of this are shown in Figures 6.4 and 6.11, 
for the case of spalling in the narrow webs of hcu, and a T beam just above the top row of two 
rows of 3 no. wires. In the latter, the cracks were not reported until the beams had been delivered 
to site, i.e. the cracks did not form at the time of transfer of prestress, the usual point in time.
The three types of cracks, i.e. bursting, spalling and splitting, are generally referred to 
as ‘splitting’, the latter two colloquially known as ‘crocodile cracks’ (with reference to its 
mouth!). However, they are individually caused by different phenomena due to the trans￾fer of prestress from the line of the pretensioning tendons to the body of the section, where 
the gradient of the vector, the rapid build-up of prestress within the transmission length 
(actual lt, not the design value lpt2) and the change in cross section above the tendons are 
the most important parameters. Bursting and spalling are related to the distribution of 
prestressing forces over the cross section. Splitting is due to bond action and the Hoyer 
effect due to a change in the diameter of tendons over the transmission length.
Localised compressive stresses develop in the concrete close to the point of transfer, 
spreading out to cause vertical and lateral tensile stresses σsp in a linear stress distribution, 
somewhere just beyond the end of the transmission zone. Where σsp exceeds the tensile 
strength of the concrete fct, sometimes less than 16hours of age, a horizontal crack propa￾gates rapidly, usually from the end of the element. fct is an actual axial tensile strength, not 
a design value, recommended to be on the basis of tests. A figure of about 1.2 fctm is a good 
estimate, i.e. 3.5 N/mm2 for fck(t)=30 N/mm2.Prestressing and detensioning stresses 187

The immediate upward camber of elements such as hcu or slip-formed T beams, pre￾tensioned with large eccentric forces, is thought to contribute to the severity of the cracks, 
particularly where the circular saw used to cut the concrete and tendons induces an upward 
reaction as the curvature of the element snags on the saw. Figure 6.12 illustrates the effect. 
To eliminate this weight packs may be placed close to the ends of the elements to nullify the 
camber and end curvature. See Section 4.21.
Bart Hendrikx (Hendrikx, 2011) summarised the above in a presentation at the IPHA 
(International Prestressed Hollowcore Association) Technical Seminar, in which the three 
forms of cracking were identified and discussed. Figures 6.13–6.18 are adopted from this 
presentation and show 2-d regions of internal compression and tension in a wide element, 
where the lateral stresses between tendons tend to cancel each out or do not have the space 
to develop due to proximity of other tendons. Although the stress field in a T beam may be 
3-d, lateral splitting only occurs in wide beams where the prestress is concentrated at one of 
two positions across the width.
The presentation also referred to the calculation to estimate the spalling stress given in BS 
EN 1168 (BS EN 1168, 2005) clause 4.3.3.2.1, based on the earlier work of Den Uijl (Den 
Uijl, 1985) as well as the information presented in the CEB-FIB Model Code 90 (CEB-FIB, 
1990). See Section 6.4.5.188 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

6.4.2 Bursting stresses
Bursting stresses are shown in Figure 6.15 due to the spreading of prestress causing curved 
compressive stress trajectories which generate lateral tensile stress. The same effect is found 
under partially loaded areas such as bearing plates, as shown in BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 6.29 
using a slope of trajectory of 2:1. Exp. 6.58 and 6.59 are used to determine the ratio of the 
lateral bursting force to normal force, typically about 0.2 for small bearing areas. Directly 
beneath the loaded area, the concrete is confined, and for the same reason, Figure 6.16 
shows that the maximum tensile stress occurs some distance from the end of the element. A 
possible crack pattern occurs along the line of the tendons, developing first at transfer but 
increasing in length over a short time.
6.4.3 Spalling stresses
‘Spalling’ is the term used in BS EN 1168 to describe horizontal cracks due to a similar 
mechanism as bursting cracks due to the spreading of prestress into the section – except 
spalling cracks occur higher up the section and are most severe in narrow webs. Here ‘spall￾ing’ should not be confused with the term ‘spalling’ to describe the surface spalling near 
corroding rebars or flaking due to expansive forces such as sulfates, etc. Spalling stresses 
are shown in Figure 6.17 due to the spreading of eccentric prestressing forces, which causes 
additional curving of the compressive stress trajectories, with the largest gradient being 190 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
above the line of the pretensioning force. These stresses can also be increased due to internal 
thermal gradients during the hydration of cement in curing, particularly in the outer webs. 
Spalling stresses are greater than bursting stresses and occur at the end of the element, 
which is less confined than in the latter. The cracks are also wider than the latter. Spalling 
is therefore the most common of the three types, as shown in Figure 6.4, particularly in hcu 
with circular cores where cracking is at mid-depth, or with deep parallel sided cores where 
cracking occurs at about ¼ of the depth, particularly if the minimum width of the webs is 
less than 35mm. It can also be a problem in highly stressed hcu of depth 400–500mm. A 
calculation model is given in Section 6.4.5.
6.4.4 Splitting stresses
Splitting forces and stresses are shown in Figure 6.18. Unlike bursting and spalling these are 
related to the bond and dilation of tendons, particularly around helical strands where short 
transmission lengths (thanks to the cement matrix engaging in the tiny crevices between the 
six outer spiral wires) increase the gradient of the dilation. The change in diameter of the 
tendon due to pretensioning, known as ‘Hoyer’ effect, together with circumferential bond 
stresses, cause radial tensile stress around the tendon. Splitting cracks initiate at the ends 
of the elements along the line of the tendons, but are difficult to distinguish from bursting 
cracks as the two effects are taking place at the same time. The two main parameters con￾trolling splitting are concrete cover and transmission length.
A calculation model is given by the FIP Recommendations (FIP, 1988) to check the radial 
tensile stress around tendons as a function of cover. Cover relates to any free edge, including 
the internal hollow cores, as shown in Figure 6.19. A frictional bond mechanism is used. 
Bursting stresses, which are smaller than splitting and typically 1 N/mm2, are combined 
with splitting stresses of about 3 N/mm2 using a lower and conservative coefficient of fric￾tion of μ=0.32 (Walraven’s research, T. U. Delft) instead of 0.37 used elsewhere for bond 
analysis. See Figure 6.20a.

Example 6.3
Determine the minimum cover to satisfy splitting stress criteria for a 12.5mm helical 
strand, of area Ap =93mm2, stressed to 70% with fpu =1770 N/mm2. Allow 5% losses at 
transfer with a characteristic cylinder strength fck(t)=28 N/mm2. The factory target cube 
strength would be fc(t)=35+5=40 N/mm2.
Solution
For grade C28/35 concrete fcu(t)=35 N/mm2
Eq. 6.18 σpo =0.7×1770=1239 N/mm2
Eq. 6.19 Po =0.95×1239×93=109.5 kN
Eq. 6.21 lt=10×12.5 √(1239/35)=743mm
Eq. 6.20 τ=109.5×103/π×12.5×743=3.75 N/mm2
Eq. 6.22 σr=3.75/0.32=11.72 N/mm2
Eq. 6.26 fct=0.87 (0.05×35+1)=2.39 N/mm2
Eq. 6.25 Then C≥11.72×12.5/(2×2.39)=30.7mm
This is the design value for the cover to all surfaces. The typical cover to the soffit used 
for 12.5mm strands is 35–40mm.

C≥12.86×12.5/(2×2.76)=29.1mm
It may be possible that the strands close to the bottom of the hollow cores would have 
this amount of cover. To check whether splitting stresses would actually be violated, 
using factory measured values for fc(t)=40 N/mm2 and the realistic empirical value for 
fct=0.7√fc(t).
Eq. 6.21 lt=10×12.5 √(1239/40)=696mm
Eq. 6.20 τ=109.5×103/π×12.5×696=4.00 N/mm2
Eq. 6.22 σr=4.00/0.32=12.50 N/mm2
Eq. 6.26 fct=0.7×√40=4.42 N/mm2
Eq. 6.25 C≥12.50×12.5/(2×4.42)=17.6mm
It is therefore possible that splitting stresses would not occur where the cover is at least 
18mm.
6.4.5 MODEL CALCULATIONS FOR SPALLING STRESS 
IN HOLLOW CORE FLOOR UNITS
Although splitting and spalling can occur in all types of prestressed slabs and beams that 
have particularly narrow webs in relation to the overall width and magnitude of prestress in 
the bottom flange, the most comprehensive body of work relates to hcu, pioneered by Den 
Uijl at T. U. Delft (Den Uijl, 1985).
Spalling may be avoided by following some fairly comprehensive design rules adopted in 
BS EN 1168, clause 4.3.3.2.1 from the work of Den Uijl. The research was applicable to hcu 
less than 400mm deep, but this is not mentioned in BS EN 1168. Extensive research has been 
carried out on the transmission of prestress in hcu. Adopting approximations using strut￾and-tie or truss models and more detailed finite element models, BS EN 1168 published the 
following expression for the maximum vertical spalling stress σsp in the web of an I section. 
The I section is transformed to have the same area and second moment of area as close as pos￾sible to the actual profile of the hcu. Hendrikx (Hendrikx, 2011) mentions that the expres￾sion for σsp is also applicable to rectangular sections, provided that the relative eccentricity 
αe and web width bw are the same, where the equivalent depth of a rectangle def is given as

The figure of 1/6 is based on Zb/Ac=def/6 for a rectangular section (and is checked in Example 6.4).

Figure 6.21 Spalling stresses according to BS EN 1168.194 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
to do a lot of work to determine σsp, it does show the dependency of lpt1 on the final result – a 
small error in something that is quite difficult to predict can lead to large variations in (the 
y-axis) σsp/(Ppm0/bw eo).
Designers of hcu sections show that the resulting value of σsp is less than the tensile strength 
of concrete at transfer fct on the basis of tests. As an initial estimate, a typical value for fct is 
about 3.5 N/mm2 when fck(t)=30 N/mm2. Spalling is not easily predicted by simply calculat￾ing σsp. It is significantly affected by mix design (cement type, fine aggregates), detensioning 
rate, prestress level (when prestress at the bottom fibre is greater than about 14 N/mm2), 
bond slip and transmission length, and the environmental conditions during curing.
The effect of changes in transmission length is dramatic. For example, if the partial safety 
factor (γc=1.5) for bond stress is omitted, on the grounds that spalling is not an ultimate limit 
state, then lpt1/eo decreases by 1.5. For the case of the 400mm depth hcu with 6 cores and 
bw =40mm, using the prestress active in an individual web σsp (derived from Eq. 6.29)=2.4 
N/mm2, but if γc is omitted σsp increases to 3.4 N/mm2, by a factor of 1.42. Taking fct≈3.5 
N/mm2 the results show that splitting may only be a problem in deeper units.
Example 6.4
Calculate the spalling stress σsp according to BS EN 1168 for the webs in the 250mm 
depth hcu shown in cross section in Figure 6.7 based on (i) the full width hcu and (ii) one 
web. Use the section properties, material data, area of strands Ap =911mm2 and prestress 
after transfer as σpm0 =1158.8 N/mm2 from Example 6.1. Assume the release of prestress 
is gradual, and bond conditions are good (see BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 8.10.2.2).
Solution
i. for the full width hcu
Zb =1270×106/123=10.325×106mm3
Eq. 6.28 k=10.325×106/168000=61.5mm
Height to centroid of strands ys=40.8mm
eo =123.0–40.8=82.2mm
Eq. 6.30 αe=(82.2–61.5)/250=0.083
fctm =0.3×452/3 =3.80 N/mm2
fctm(t)=3.80×(30+8)/(45+8)=2.72 N/mm2
fbpt=3.2×0.7×2.72/1.5=4.06 N/mm2
Average diameter of strands=(7×12.5+5×9.3)/12=11.17mm
Eq. 6.31 lpt1 =0.8×0.19×1158.8×11.17/4.06=484mm
Then lpt1/eo =5.89
For the full width unit Ppm0=1158.8×911=1055654N
bw =5×40+2×51=302mm
Ppm0/bw eo =1055654/302×82.2=42.52 N/mm2Prestressing and detensioning stresses 195
Eq. 6.29 σsp =42.52×(15×0.0832.3 +0.07)/[1+{5.891.5 ×(1.3×0.083+0.1)}]=1.

ii. determine the maximum σsp in 1 no. bw =40mm web, due to the prestress of 1 no. 
12.5 and 1 no. 9.3mm diameter strands. Average diameter=10.9mm.
For the I section with one core k=62.5mm
ys=40.4mm, eo =82.6mm and αe=(82.6–62.5)/250=0.0804
Ppm0 (for 2 strands)=1158.8×(93+52)=168026N
Ppm0/bw eo =168026/40×82.6=50.85
lpt1 =0.8×0.19×1158.8×10.9/4.06=472mm, then lpt1/eo =5.72
σsp =50.85×(15×0.08042.3 +0.07)/[1+{5.721.5 ×(1.3×0.0804+0.1)}]=1.55 
N/mm2
This is 1.22 times greater than the average for the full width unit. It is unknown 
whether spalling would occur in an individual web at a higher stress than in all the 
webs or how much the prestress spreads across the unit at transfer.
If the equivalent depth def of a rectangular section is substituted for the I section, 
then
Eq. 6.27 def=(82.6 (0.0804 +1/6)=334mm
k =1/6 ×334=55.7mm
Eq. 6.30 αe=(82.6–55.7)/334=0.0805 compared with 0.0804 for the 
I section.

7.1 FLEXURAL BEHAVIOUR OF PRESTRESSED ELEMENTS
7.1.1 Flexural tests on prestressed hollow core floor units
The flexural behaviour of precast prestressed concrete elements, such as slabs and beams 
in bending, is quite predictable, at least up to the cracking moment of resistance and less 
so at the ultimate capacity. Figure 7.1 shows the results of mid-span bending moment 
vs. mid-span deflection on six full scale tests carried out on a 1200 mm width × 200 mm 
depth prestressed hollow core floor units (hcu) subjected to six-point bending (four point 
loads at 1/5th span spacing to produce constant bending moment near to mid-span) over 
a simply supported span of 5.0 m. Figure 7.2. To compare the experimental results with

iii. the second moment of area Ic, height to the centroid the cross section yb and eccen￾tricity to the centre of the group of strands are calculated from the average measure￾ments of the hcu at its ends, with the assumption that the measurements at mid-span 
will not differ too much, and with certain assumptions regarding the shape of the

iv. the prestress at mid-span is calculated from factory information regarding the initial 
pretensioning force and losses of prestress at the date of testing due to strand relax￾ation and elastic shortening only (no creep loss).
v. the self-weight of the hcu was measured using a balancing load cell.
Using the above, Table 7.1 shows that the average ratio between the imposed bending 
moment at the elastic limit in the tests Ms,test and the net calculated cracking moment of 
resistance Mcr,calc (excluding the self-weight of the hcu and the loading equipment accounting 
for≈12 kNm) is 1.07. The range is from 1.02 to 1.16, with Tests 2 and 3 under-predicting 
the onset of cracking. The ratios are for an assumed tensile cracking strength of fct=1.5 
fctm =5.88 N/mm2. To provide parity, then fct≈1.79 fctm. This is not that much greater than 
the value of 1.65 fctm proposed in Precast Eurocode 2: Worked Examples (Narayanan, 2008) 
for the cracking resistance in double-tee units.
Table 7.2 shows that the average ratio between the measured and predicted flexural stiff￾ness, expressed here as mid-span bending moment/deflection was only 1%, at least up to the 
elastic limit identified from the graphs in Figure 7.1, and up to Mcr,calc=(σb +fct) Zb,co, where 
Zb,co =Ic,co/yb,co (derived in Section 6.2.4). This fortuitous result has ratios varying from 0.90 
to 1.12 with a standard deviation of 0.09. However, the overall picture is that the flexural 
behaviour of these units, and the serviceability limit state of bending and deflection (at least 
without creep effects) can be confidently predicted. The ultimate behaviour of these tests to 
failure is shown and discussed in Chapter 9.
7.1.2 Flexural tests on T beams
Similar flexural tests have also been carried out by the authors on prestressed T beams 
used in beam and block flooring. The test involved a pair of 92 mm wide × 150 mm depth 
beams, infilled with 440 mm wide concrete blocks, as shown in Figure 7.3a, simply

to uniform loading using concrete blocks giving a mid-span bending moment of 9.66 kNm per

supported over an effective span of 4.4 m. The beams are usually critical at the design 
service load, and therefore the test bending moment, based on BS 8110, Part 2, Section 
9 (BS 8110-2, 1985), is Mtest = 1.125 MsR, where MsR is calculated for the same concrete 
strength fck = 53.5 N/mm2 as measured by the average of 6 cubes at the date of testing. 
Then MsR = 1.125 × 4.92 = 5.54 kNm, equating to a UDL= 8 × 5.54/4.402 = 2.29 kN/m. The 
test results were compared with
i. MsR =(σb +fctm) Zb,co using losses calculated at the date of testing (12days after casting) 
as 13% and the measured cross section of the beam and cover to wires
ii. cracking moment of resistance Mcr=(σb +fct) Zb,co, where fct is taken as 1.5 fctm
iii. ultimate MRd (based on the equilibrium of forces and compatibility of prestrain and 
ultimate strain as defined in Section 9.3.1)
iv. flexural stiffness of the beam K=M/δtest, where M is the imposed mid-span moment 
and δtest the measured mid-span deflection at the same load.
The test was carried out in two loading and unloading cycles to Mtest=5.54 kNm, followed 
by monotonic loading to failure. The bending moment due to the self-weight of the two 
beams and row of infill blocks is 1.51 kNm per beam.
Figure 7.3b shows the loading arrangement where up to 166 no. 18.2kg concrete blocks 
were used as kentledge. Dial gauges were used to measure the mid-span deflection, and 
Figure 7.4 shows the mid-span bending moment vs. deflection up to the onset of cracking, 
shown in Figure 7.5, together with deflections during unloading, and the average predicted 
deflections (note the plot for Beam 2 is displaced on the graph for clarity).
Table 7.3 shows that the average ratio between the bending moment at Ms,test and the 
predicted (calculated) cracking moment of resistance Mcr is 1.015. Therefore, the assumed 
tensile cracking strength of fct=1.5 fctm =1.5×4.17=6.25 N/mm2 is valid. The average ratio 
between Ms,test and MsR is 1.13, showing that the calculated prestress σb =14.74 N/mm2 and 
fctm =4.17 N/mm2 are both reliable values. The ratio based on the design MsR, including 
long-term losses and using the design fck =55 N/mm2, is 1.20, giving greater confidence to 
the results. Ultimate moments are discussed in Section 9.1.200 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

Figure 7.5 Initial flexural cracking at an applied load of 16.0 kN in the soffit in the mid-span region of pre￾stressed T beams, giving a mid-span bending moment of 5.93 kNm per beam, equal to 1.12 times 
the calculated service moment of resistance. Further cracking to a height of 80mm when the bend￾ing moment was 9.07 kNm is drawn onto this photograph. (With permission by Litecast Ltd. UK.)
Table 7.4 shows that the average ratio between the measured and predicted flexural stiff￾ness, expressed here as mid-span bending moment/deflection (predicted K=∂M/∂δ=0.32 
kNm/mm) was only 84% in the first load cycle, at least up to the elastic limit identified from 
the graphs in Figure 7.4, and 91% in the second and third load cycles. There are no creep 
effects in these results, which may otherwise reduce K, but in the author’s experience, the 
value for Ecm (37.95 kN/mm2 in these tests) given in BS 1992-1-1 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004) 
is higher than found in compression tests, and greater than those given by Neville (Neville, 
1999) and in BS 8110, Part 2 (BS 8110-2, 1985) by at least 10%.Flexural design in service 201
To make the predicted deflections agree with the experimental deflections, the value of 
Ecm may be reduced by 10% to 34.5 kN/mm2. Now the flexural stiffness for beam 1 is 
K=0.287 kNm/mm, and overall the ratio of predicted/experimental K=0.975.
An alternative theory to the differences in flexural stiffness is that it is thought that hair￾line cracks in the top of the beams during the handling stage at transfer (where beams are 
cast upside down) may have reduced K in the first load cycle. For example, consider 5 no. 
cracks of 0.1mm crack width. The additional deflection due to crack closure is determined 
from beam curvature (1/r) equal to the strain gradient through the depth of the beam ε/h=
(0.5/4400)/150=0.76×10−6/mm. The deflection due to this curvature is due to crack closure 
δcc=0.76×10−6 ×44002/8≈1.8mm. The difference between the actual deflection at the test 
load and the predicted deflection in the two beams is 2.12 and 2.60mm, so the additional 
1.8mm could in part account for the lower K values in the first load cycle.
Finally, BS 8110, Part 2, clause 9.5.4 states that the recovery of deflections after the sec￾ond load cycle should be at least equal to that after the first loading and be at least 85% 
for ‘Class 2’ prestressed concrete, i.e. allowing permitted tensile stress in the soffit. The test 
values are 87.7% and 86.2% for Beam 1, and 89.6% and 88.5% for Beam 2. All values are 
greater than 85% and close enough in the two load cycles to be considered satisfactory. As 
with the hcu in Section 7.1.1, the overall picture is that bending moments and deflections (at 
least without creep effects) can be confidently predicted.

7.1.3 Lateral distribution and flexural tests on T beam floor slab
Section 2.2.10 introduced the concept of lateral load distribution of isolated point loads 
and/or longitudinal wall loads (parallel to span) between several T beams in beam and 
block flooring, i.e. a point load acting on top of a screeded floor may be distributed between 
several T beams. Full scale tests were carried out by the authors, as shown in Figures 7.6 
and 7.7, comprising 5 no. 150mm depth beams and 4 rows of 440mm wide infill blocks, 
to determine lateral load spread and compare mid-span deflections with calculated values. 
225mm depth beams were used in another test but are not discussed in detail here. The 
screed is 50mm thickness insitu concrete structural topping with fckT =32 N/mm2 contain￾ing A142mesh (6mm bars at 200mm spacing). A sheet of 0.3mm thickness polythene was 
placed between the beams and topping to prevent direct composite action with the beams. 
In reality, the topping may or may not have a membrane, but is likely to contribute to the 
flexural strength and stiffness of the beams, as shown in the moment v deflection results. 
Figure 7.7 shows the completed floor and arrangement for the centralised point load.
The main application is for a domestic garage floor subjected to a service point load of 10 
kN with a footprint 150×150mm. Two tests were carried out for each depth of beam for (i) 
a centralised point load positioned above the central Beam 3 and (ii) offset point load above 
the intermediate Beam 2. The effective span of the beams was 3.50m. The tests were carried 
out 56days after casting when the beams had characteristic compressive cube strength of 90 
N/mm2, converted to fck =75 N/mm2, i.e. 36% greater than the design strength. However, 
the increase in Ecm =41500 N/mm2 (9% greater than the design value) may account in part 
Figure 7.6 General arrangement of beam and infill block flooring in lateral point load tests prior to casting 
the insitu topping. Beam 1 is at the edges, Beam 3 is central (beneath the point load) and Beam 2 
in between. (With permission by Litecast Ltd. UK.)Flexural design in service 203

for the increased flexural stiffness, but would not affect the proportion of the point load 
carried by each of the 5 beams.
The results given here are for 150mm depth beams that were pretensioned using 4 no. 
5mm wires with a service MsR =5.55 kNm and cracking Mcr=6.14 kNm (using the same 
calculation as in Section 7.1.2).
The test was carried out in one loading and unloading cycle to a point load of 10 kN, 
equivalent to Mtest=4.02 kNm, followed by monotonic loading to failure. The bending 
moment due to the self-weight of the beams, infill blocks and topping is 2.10 kNm per inte￾rior beam and 1.23 kNm for the edge beams.
Figure 7.8 shows the total mid-span bending moment vs. deflection for the central Beam 3, 
intermediate Beam 2 and edge Beam 1. The ratio between the measured and predicted flex￾ural stiffness, expressed as mid-span bending moment/deflection (predicted K=∂M/∂δ=0.83 
kNm/mm) was 141% in the first load cycle and 111% in the second loading. The increased 
stiffness is thought to be due to increased Ecm and composite action with the topping. The 
recovery of deflection after the first load cycle was 88% and 83% in Beams 2 and 3, respec￾tively. The floor slab was also tested for failure under centralised point load of 41 kN. 
This gave a bending moment in Beam 3 of 16.1 kNm, 1.94 times the calculated MRd. The 
high moment of resistance is also thought to be due to composite action as the composite 
MRd =13.4 kNm, assuming full interaction.
The deflections of the beams and their calculated flexural stiffness as measured for each 
beam enable the proportion of the total imposed load β to be determined for each beam. 
Variations in β up to the service load are shown in Figure 7.9. Values of β obtained from 
a theoretical analysis of the flexural and torsion stiffness of the beams and topping are 204 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

β=0.215–0.225 for Beams 2 and 3, but for the offset point load β=0.28–0.27 for Beams 1 
and 2, suggesting that the point load may be distributed over 1/0.28=3.6 beams. The rec￾ommendation is that point loads may be distributed over three beams.Flexural design in service 205
Further tests were also carried out by moving the position of the point load close to the 
support, at 440mm from the support (approx lpt from the end of the beam, see Section 
10.2.2 for the derivation of lpt). Here the load distribution factors β were close to 0.4. The 
recommendation is that point loads close to the support may be distributed over two beams.
7.2 FLEXURAL CAPACITY
7.2.1 Combined prestress and imposed bending stresses
The flexural capacity of precast prestressed concrete is no different from any other type of 
prestressed concrete. The quality control of factory cast concrete helps to explain the excel￾lent correlation between test results and theory found in precast units, shown for example in 
Figures 7.1 and 7.4. The major difference in behaviour found in precast units is due more to 
the complex geometry found in voided units such as hcu, which may have rapidly reducing 
web thickness near the neutral axis, or double-tee units in which the stresses in the narrow 
webs dominate both the service and ultimate moments of resistance.
Subjected to compressive prestress σb and a service bending moment Ms the net concrete 
stress in the tension face should not exceed the mean tensile strength of concrete fctm, defined 
in Eq. 5.5. Referring to Figures 6.1c and 7.10, where the pretensioning force is applied close 
to the bottom of a simply supported element, if the pretensioning force after all four major 
losses, defined in Section 6.2.2 as tendon relation, elastic shortening, creep and shrinkage, 
is Ppo, then the axial stress=force/cross-sectional area Ppo/Ac and the flexural stress=Mp/Zb, 
where Mp is the internal couple Ppo zcp, and Zb is the section modulus at the tension face. The 
total prestress at the bottom of the section is
σ = b P A po / / c p + P zo cp Zb (7.1)
and at the top is
σ =t P A po / / c p − P zo cp t Z (7.2)
When subjected to a characteristic service moment Ms, at the bottom fibre (taking compres￾sion as positive) the resulting stresses are

Note that the compound section modulus Zb,co (see Section 6.2.4) may be used, although 
most designers ignore the small benefit from this.
The limit of fctm is based on a requirement in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.3.2 (4) to prevent 
sudden rupture under the characteristic combination of loads, thereby restricting the tensile 
stress to σct,p =fctm in clause 7.3.2 (2). Some publications, e.g. Precast Eurocode 2: Worked 
Examples (Narayanan, 2008) refer to a ‘minimum steel requirement’ rather than limiting 
the stress to fctm. However, it is now shown that the minimum area of tendons Ap,min accord￾ing to clause 7.3.2 (2) & (3) and Exp. 7.1 is not practical, as follows:
ξ ∆ 1 , A k p min σ = p c c k f tmAct (7.4)
This is a long and tedious calculation, but for the 250mm depth hollow core unit used in 
Example 6.1, with strands at a mean distance of 40.8mm from the soffit, the values are: 
kc=0.58 (with k1 =⅔ for tension in the strands), k=1, fctm =3.80 N/mm2, Act≈70850mm2
(approximate because the height hc,ef =2.5×40.8=102mm is inside the cores) and (from BS 
EN 1992-1-1, Table 6.2) ξ1 =√0.6=0.775 for strands. The dominant variable is ∆σp, which 
is defined (Clause 7.3.2 (3)) as the ‘stress variation in tendons from the state of zero strain 
of the concrete at the same level’, which is understood to be the increase in tensile stress 
in the tendons after the strain in the concrete there was zero at the serviceability limit, i.e. 
(MsR/Zz−σcp −0) Ep/(Ecm/(1+φ(t,t0)), where σcp =stress in concrete at level of tendons after all Flexural design in service 207
losses=10.19 N/mm2. MsR/Zz=11.35 N/mm2. See Example 7.1 for the derivation of the long￾term creep coefficient φ(t,t0). Then ∆σp =(11.35−10.19−0)×195000/[36283/(1+2.065)]=19 
N/mm2. Thus Ap,min =kc k fctm Act/ξ1 ∆σp =0.58×1×3.80×70850/0.775×19≈10600mm2
!
The area of strands in this example is 911mm2. Repeating this exercise for a 150mm depth T 
beam (for beam and block flooring) kc=1.02, therefore use 1.0. Ap,min =1.0×1×4.21×6517/
0.837×80≈408mm2
! The area of strands in the tension zone is 59mm2.
Other publications (e.g. Gilbert et al. (2017)) limit the tension at the bottom to 0.5 fctm, 
although this is used to demonstrate the procedures to calculate the upper limit of prestress 
rather than a design recommendation. Gilbert et al. also noted that if cracking is allowed 
under the characteristic (i.e. full) service load, then this limit is not specified at all, although 
limiting values at transfer are enforced to control the upper limit of prestress. Elements that 
are designed to crack under the full service load are proportioned so that no tension exists 
in the concrete under the sustained (dead) load. In this case, the flexurally cracked second 
moment of area is used in deflection calculations. It is not usual for designers of precast 
prestressed elements in the UK to take this option.
The limitation of fctm is appropriate only for durability exposure class XC1 (internal expo￾sure low humidity or permanently wet) according to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table 7.1N (super￾ceded by Table A.4 in the National Annex) when Ms is the characteristic combination of 
loading gk +qk. Some designers have mistakenly interpreted the definition of service loading 
as a reversible ‘frequent’ design load gk +ψ1qk based on definitions given in BS EN 1990 (BS 
EN 1990, 2002). The frequent load is defined as a load that is exceeded for 1% of the ‘ref￾erence period’ of a building structure, whereas the quasi-permanent load will exceed itself 
for 50% of that period. The reference period is defined as the period of time for assessing 
statically variable actions; in other words, it may be for 1year for a temporary structure or 
50years for the life of a concrete building.
For durability exposure classes XC2 to XC4 the limiting tension is zero (called ‘decom￾pression’ in Table 7.1N) and Ms,qp is for the quasi-permanent load gk +ψ2 qk. Then
+σ − b M Z s q, p / 0 b c, o ≥ (7.3b)
For durability XD1/XS1 or greater, the limiting tension is also zero and Ms is for the fre￾quent load gk +ψ1 qk. Then
+σ − b M Z s f, , req b / 0 co ≥ (7.3c)
The crack width wk for prestressed concrete is limited wmax ≤0.2mm (see calculation in 
Section 11.3.1).
The loading, tensile stress and crack width limitations are summarised in Table 3.3. Note 
that for durability exposure class>XC1, the characteristic combination is checked (Eq. 7.3a) 
as well as decompression (Eq. 7.3b or 7.3c), so two calculations are required. This is dealt 
with in Examples 7.1 and 7.4.
After cracking, tension stiffening of the concrete (due to the elasticity of the reinforce￾ment) allows reduced tensile stress in this region, but when the tensile stress reaches the nar￾row part of the web, cracks extend rapidly through the section and the flexural stiffness of 
the section reduces to a far greater extent than in a rectangular section. Figure 7.1 shows this 
behaviour in a flexural test carried out on a 200mm depth hcu. The serviceability limiting 
state must be checked to prevent this type of behaviour, hence the need for clause 7.3.2 (4).
A second reason why the service condition is calculated in this manner is that the ratio 
of the ultimate moment of resistance MRd to the serviceability moment of resistance MsR is 
usually about 1.5–1.8. Thus, with the use of the partial load factors (γG =1.25 or 1.35 and 208 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
γQ =1.50 or 1.5 ψ0), the serviceability condition will always be critical, provided the amount 
of prestress is sufficient. Finally, the problem of cracking in unreinforced zones is particu￾larly important with regard to the uncracked shear resistance. It is therefore necessary to 
ensure that tensile stresses are not exceeded.
At the top fibre, the final stresses are
+σ +t M Z s t / 0 ,co ≤ .45fck (7.5)
Note that+σt
 is most likely to be negative in the vast majority of prestressed elements.
Compressive stresses due to service loads and prestress are limited according to BS EN 
1992-1-1, clauses 7.2 (2) and 7.2 (3) as discussed in Section 3.1.2 for different exposure 
classes. Clause 7.2 (3) specifies a limiting compressive stress of 0.45 fck under quasi￾permanent loads to avoid non-linear creep in the calculation of prestress losses and 
deflections according to clause 3.1.4 (4).
Non-linear creep coefficient is given as
ϕ ∞ = ϕ ∞ > ϕ ∞ σ ( ) t t e t fcm t
k( , 0 0 ) ( , ) ( , ) [1.5 ( / –0.45)]
0 c 0 (7.6)
where σc is the compressive stress, i.e. σt+Ms/Zt,co
φ(∞,t0) is the long-term creep coefficient
For non-linear creep to exist, the term [σc/fcm(t0)−0.45] must be positive. Then σc≤0.45 
fcm(t0). For example if fck =45 N/mm2, σc≤0.45×(45+8)=23.85 N/mm2, or 0.53 fck. If fck =55 
N/mm2, σc≤0.515 fck, and so on.
For a wide range of solid units of depths ranging from 80 to 150mm, and hcu from 150 
to 500mm, when the design of the element is limited by the tensile stress fctm, the stress in 
compression under the characteristic service load is between σc=0.18 and 0.39 fck, with the 
greatest value being recorded for depths of 200–300mm in hcu with the highest strand 
pattern. For double-tee units of depths from 300 to 900mm σc=0.15–0.22 fck, with values 
increasing for greater depths and for the highest strand patterns. For thermal slabs of widths 
400–1200mm and depth 250mm σc=0.04–0.31 fck. For T beams (in beam and block floor￾ing) of depth 150 and 225mm σc=0.52 fck and 0.38 fck, respectively. Therefore, the presence 
of non-linear creep is avoided if all other limitations mentioned above are satisfied.
The marked difference in σc/fck between T beams (viz. 0.52) and all other elements is due 
to the shape of the beams and the much smaller ratio of Zb,co/Zt,co =0.68 and 0.78, respec￾tively, compared with 0.95 for hcu, 2.00–2.44 for double-tees (although the cross section 
is designed with composite action in mind), and 1.22–2.22 for thermal slabs (notionally 
similar in cross section to double-tees).
Checking the compressive stress of 0.45 fck under quasi-permanent loads is rarely critical 
for exposure XC1, unless the imposed load is very small and self-weight and dead loads 
dominate. In design, it is often, but not always, convenient to limit the compressive stress to 
0.45 fck for all situations. If necessary, in the case of certain T beams of depth 150mm, the 
compressive stress need only be limited to 0.51 fck, as shown in Example 7.5, where non￾linear creep is not activated.
7.2.2 Serviceability limit state of flexure
MsR is calculated by limiting the flexural compressive and tensile stresses in the concrete 
both in the factory transfer and handling conditions and in service. Figures 6.1 and 7.10 
show the stress conditions at these stages for applied sagging moments – the diagrams may 
be inverted for cantilever units subject to hogging moments.Flexural design in service 209
To optimise the design the limiting stresses at transfer should be equally critical as those at 
the limiting serviceability state of stress, and that the top and bottom surface stresses should 
attain maximum values simultaneously, i.e. manipulating Eqs. 7.3 and 7.5, then (0.45 fck −σt
) 
Zt,co =(σb +fctm) Zb,co. In practice, this is impossible in a (nearly) symmetrical rectangular 
section such as a hcu, but can be better achieved in T beams or composite double-tee slabs.
7.2.3 Serviceability limit state of flexure – calculation model
The full analysis is as follows (BS EN 1992-1-1 clause references are at left-hand side of the 
page)
Compound values Ac,co, yb,co, Ic,co, Zb,co and Zt,co are given in Section 6.2.4.

7.2.4.1 Short-term losses
Short-term losses can be calculated from transfer at time to to installation at time ti
 using 
relative humidity RH=70% with all faces exposed, and to the long-term 500000hours 
(57years) using service RHs=50% (indoor) or 70% (outdoor) with the exposed sides only 
exposed (other sides protected by finishes, grouting, etc.)
5.10.6(1a) Loss due to creep to installation. See BS EN 1992-1-1, Annex B.1. Although 
the strength of concrete at 1day will be the transfer strength fck(t) N/mm2, after a few 
days it will reach the 28days strength fck N/mm2, and so the mean strength fcm is taken 
for the strength factors in this calculation.
Notional depth during this period is for all faces exposed (ignoring the perimeter of cores 
in hcu)

rinf=1.0 (whilst EN 1992-1-1 gives rinf=0.95). Some texts (e.g. Bhatt, 2011) apply γinf=0.95 
from EN 1992-1-1 to Ppo.

7.2.4.5 Service moment of resistance MsR
To calculate MsR, the section is considered uncracked and the net cross-sectional area Ac
and second moment of area Ic are used to compute maximum fibre stresses σb and σt
 at the 
bottom and top of the section. MsR is given by the lesser of
MsR,b =(σb +fctm) Zb,co (for exposure class XC1) (7.37a)
and MsR,b =σb Zb,co (for exposure class>XC1) (7.37b)
or MsR,t=(0.45 fck − σt
) Zt,co (7.38a)
and MsR,t=(0.60 fck − σt
) Zt,co (7.38b)
At the bottom fibre MsR,b in Eq. 7.37a is the capacity to be checked against the characteristic 
service load gk +qk. MsR,b in Eq. 7.37b is checked against the quasi-permanent load gk +ψ2qkFlexural design in service 213
for exposure classes XC2 to XC4, and the frequent load gk +ψ1qk for XD and XS. At the 
top fibre MsR,t in Eq. 7.38a is checked against the quasi-permanent load for all classes of 
durability to avoid non-linear creep as discussed above. However, quasi-permanent loads 
and non-linear creep are for long-term conditions, and therefore the short-term conditions 
for exposure class XC should also be checked using MsR,t Eq. 7.38b for characteristic loads. 
This situation is not specified in BS EN 1992-1, clause 7.2 (2), but is adopted and proposed 
in Precast Eurocode 2: Worked Examples (Narayanan, 2008) for exposure XC1. Finally, if 
the top surface is exposed to long-term to classes XD, XF or XS MsR,t Eq. 7.38b is checked 
against the characteristic service load (clause 7.2 (2)). Other publications (e.g. Gilbert et al. 
(2017)) limit the compression in this situation to 0.5 fck.
Double tee slabs present a special case. Because of its cross section, the centroid of the unit 
lies close to the top flange, and therefore the section modulus Zt
 to the top fibre is very large, 
typically 2 to 3 times Zb. Consequently, as the top fibre does not give a limiting value to MsR
the influence of fck is very small, as given in Eq. 7.38. As the controlling influence in Eq. 7.37 
is σb, the stress at transfer becomes very important. It is therefore necessary with double tee 
units to try to achieve the maximum possible transfer strength, say about fck(t)=35 N/mm2, 
or to debond or deflect tendons in order to reduce the demand on fck(t).
Example 7.1
Continue Example 6.1 to calculate MsR at the support and mid-span for the 250mm 
depth prestressed hollow core unit shown in cross section in Figure 6.7. Exposure class 
is XC1. The effective span of hcu=9.8m. Self-weight of grouted unit=3.63 kN/m2, floor 
screed=1.80 kN/m2, finishes=1.50 kN/m2 and services & ceiling=0.50 kN/m2. Imposed 
live load=5.0 kN/m2. Geometric and material data given by the manufacturer are as 
follows:
Ac=168×103mm2; Ic=1270×106mm4; yb =123mm; fck =45 N/mm2; fck(t)=30 N/mm2; 
fpk =1770 N/mm2; Ep =195 kN/mm2; Ap =93 and 52mm2 per 12.5 and 9.3mm dia. strand; 
cover to strand=35mm. Concrete density=24.5 kN/m3. Gravel aggregates. Cement CEM 
I grade 52.5R. Area of longitudinal infilled joints between hcu=9970mm2. Compound 
section properties (from Example 6.1) are Zb,co =10.701×106mm3; Zt,co =10.056×106mm3; 
Zz,co =15.766×106mm3.
Is the critical fibre stress at the top or bottom of the unit? Check MsR against the char￾acteristic combination of the design service moment Ms. Plot graphs of bending moment 
distributions for MsR and Ms, taking the transmission length for the build-up of prestress 
(from Example 6.1) as lpt=605mm.
Solution

(slightly greater due to smaller initial losses)
Final prestress
 Eq. 7.35 σpo = 1158.8 − 115.2 − 73.5 − 25.8 = 944.3 N/mm2. At mid-span σpo = 1020.7 
N/mm2
Ppo =944.3×911=860218N. At mid-span=929835N
The reduction in elastic shortening and creep losses at mid-span increases the prestress 
there by 8.1%
Rs=944.3/1239=0.762. At mid-span ratio Rs=0.824
The loss of prestress at transfer at the support is 100−(100×944.3/1239)=23.8% (this is 
carried forward to Example 11.1).
Final prestress at mid-span

N/mm2 <0.45×45=20.25 N/mm2216 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
 Eq. 7.2 σt=(929835/168000)−(929835×82.2/10.000×106)=−2.11 N/mm2 >−3.80 N/mm2
MsR at mid-span is the lesser of
Eq. 7.37 At the bottom fibre. MsR,b =(12.94+3.80)×10.701=179.12 kNm
Eq. 7.38 At the top fibre. MsR,t=(20.25−2.11)×10.056=224.84 kNm>179.12 kNm
Clause 7.2 (3). MsR,t at the top need only be checked against quasi-permanent service load.
Final prestress at support
σb =0.925×12.94=11.97 N/mm2
σt=0.925×−2.11=−1.95 N/mm2
MsR at the support is the lesser of
MsR,b =(11.97+3.80)×10.701=168.75 kNm
MsR,t=(20.25−1.95)×10.056=223.25 kNm>168.75 kNm
The bottom fibre is critical in both cases.
The distribution of MsR between support and mid-span is taken as parabolic to mimic 
the parabolic distribution of bending stress due to self-weight and dead loads.
MsR,b at the ends of the unit, where the prestress σb is zero is MsR,b =fctm
Zb,co =3.80×10.701=40.63 kNm
Between the end of the span and distance x=lpt, the increase in σb,x is linear, as
σb,x =(x/lpt) σb (7.39)
where σpo is the prestress based on the parabolic distribution between the support and 
mid-span. At x=lpt, σb,x =12.19 N/mm2
Then MsR,x =(σb,x +fctm) Zb,co (7.40)
At x=lpt, MsR,x =171.9 kNm
The characteristic combination of the design service UDL and moment per 1.20m wide 
unit is
ws=[4.12+0.24+1.2×(1.80+1.50+0.50+5.00)]=14.92 kN/m
Ms=14.92×9.82/8=179.1 kNm=MsR at mid-span exactly!
Figure 7.11 shows the complete bending moment diagrams for the characteristic design 
moment Ms and MsR. The design is completed for ultimate moments, shear forces and 
deflections in Examples 9.1, 10.1 and 11.1.Flexural design in service 217
Example 7.2
Find the required compressive fck in Example 7.1 that would equate the service moment 
based on the top and bottom limiting service stress conditions, thus optimising the 
strength of concrete.
Solution
Solving MsR =(σb +fctm) Zb,co =(0.45 fck −σt
) Zt,co
Then (12.94+fctm) 10.701×106 =(0.45 fck −2.11) 10.056×106
Then 138.47+10.701×0.3 fck2/3 =4.527 fck +21.22
117.25=4.527 fck −3.21 fck2/3
Hence fck =33.2 N/mm2
and MsR,b =(12.94+0.3×33.22/3)×10.701=171.5 kNm.
The result for fck is just greater than the transfer strength (fck(t)=30) suggesting an imprac￾tical solution. (This result further demonstrates that increasing fck to say 50 N/mm2 would 
have little effect on the value of MsR, adding 2.3%.) It is therefore necessary to modify the 
section properties Zb,co and Zt,co to obtain comparability, as follows.

Example 7.3
Find the required values of Zb,co and Zt,co in Example 7.1 necessary to equate the value of 
MsR,b and MsR,t obtained from limiting stresses. Calculate the new value of MsR. Study the 
cross section and check whether the new values of Zb,co and Zt,co can be achieved practi￾cally. From Example 6.1 yb,co =121.1mm and Ic,co =1296×106mm4.
Solution
Solving MsR =(σb +fctm) Zb,co =(0.45 fck −σt
) Zt,co
Then (12.94+3.80) Zb,co =(20.25−2.11) Zt,co
Then Zb,co/Zt,co =22.36/16.74=1.336, i.e. yt/yb =1.336
also yb +yt=250mm
Solving yb =107mm and yt=143mm
Then Zb,co =1296×106/107=12.112×106mm3 and Zt,co =9.063×106mm3
and MsR =(12.94+3.80)×12.112=202.75 kNm>179.12 kNm in Example 7.1.
To achieve this condition, the geometric centroid must be lowered by 121.1 – 107=14mm. 
To achieve this, the voids must be repositioned or modified in shape. It is not possible to 
raise the position of the voids by at least twice this distance (the core area is about 44% 
of the gross) by making the thickness of the top flange over the top of the cores too shal￾low hft=40−28=12mm.
Example 7.4
Repeat Example 7.1 for the durability exposure class XC3, and check whether the char￾acteristic or quasi-permanent design service moment is critical. The floor slab is to be for 
offices. MsR from Example 7.1 is 179.12 kNm.
Solution
MsR,b =(12.94+0)×10.701=138.47 kNm
MsR,t=(20.25− 2.11)×10.056=224.84 kNm>134.6 kNm

Ms,qp =[4.12+0.24+1.2×(1.8+1.5+0.5+0.3×5.0)]×9.82/8=128.69 kNm
<138.47 kNm by a ratio 0.93, therefore the quasi-permanent combination is not critical.
Example 7.5
a. Complete the calculation for MsR for the 150mm depth T beams shown in cross 
section in Figure 7.12 where previous in-house calculations (following the proce￾dures in Example 7.1) found the long-term loss of prestress at mid-span as 22.3%. 
The initial prestressing force is η=0.75 of characteristic strength of indented wire

ceiling=0.5 kN/m2. Imposed live load=1.5 kN/m2. Self-weight of infill insitu con￾crete between beams and between beam and blocks=0.117 kN/m.Flexural design in service 219
c. Using the limiting stress at the top fibre according to BS EN 1992-1, clause 7.2 (3) 
calculate the maximum allowable simply supported effective span for the same 
beams as (b). The flooring is to be used for domestic purposes.
Geometric and material data given by the manufacturer are as follows:
Ac=90×103mm2; Ic=17.03×106mm4; yb =61.9mm; Compound Ic,co =17.34×106mm4;

Final Ppo =0.777×104262=81011N
and σpo =0.777×1327.5=1031.5 N/mm2
*Note that the calculation for loss of prestress at mid-span (i.e. 22.3%) requires prior 
knowledge of the effective span in order to subtract the elastic shortening and creep losses 
due to self-weight and dead loads from those at the support. In this example, the second 
part of the question, i.e. the effective span, had previously been determined.
Solution to (a). Final prestress at mid-span
σb =(81011/9000)+(81011×21.9/0.275×106)=15.45 N/mm2 <0.45×55=24.75 N/mm2
σt=(81011/9000)−(81011×21.9/0.193×106)=−0.19 N/mm2 >−4.214 N/mm2
MsR at mid-span is the lesser of
At the bottom fibre. MsR,b =(15.45+4.21)×0.284=5.58 kNm
If the limiting compressive is taken as σc=0.6 fck =33.0 N/mm2, then non-linear creep will 
be activated as σc/fcm =33.0/63=0.52>0.45. To avoid this limit σc to 0.45 fcm =28.35 N/mm2.
At the top fibre. MsR,t=(28.35−0.19)×0.195=5.56 kNm<5.58 kNm.
This is a good example of the optimisation of this beam at the serviceability limit state.
Solution to (b). Maximum allowable effective span
Characteristic combination of the design service UDL
Self-weight of beam, blocks and infill per beam=0.212+0.420+0.059=0.691 kN/m
Width of two beams and infill block (see Figure 7.12)=440+48+92=580mm. Average 
spacing of beams=580/2 beams=290mm
Self-weight of screed, imposed dead and live loads=0.290×(1.50+1.00+0.50+1.50)=
1.305 kN/m
Total UDL per beam ws=0.691+1.305=1.996 kN/m
Then effective span L=√(8 MsR/ws)=√(8×5.56/1.996)=4.721m
Solution to (c). Maximum allowable effective span at 
the top fibre for quasi-permanent load
Limiting stress 0.45 fck =0.45×55=24.75 N/mm2

Quasi-permanent imposed UDL per beam ws,qp =0.691+[0.290×(1.50+1.00+0.50+

Then effective span Lqp =√(8 MsR/ws,qp)=√(8×4.86/1.692)=4.795 m>4.721m. Lqp is 
not critical.
Example 7.6
Repeat Example 7.5 for the addition of an internal partition wall positioned over one of the 
pairs of beams over the full span of the beams. The wall, including two coats of plaster is 
130mm thickness and has a characteristic dead load of 3.0 kN/m. It may be assumed that, 
because the wall is built onto the screed, the wall load may be distributed over four beams. Flexural design in service 221
Previous in-house calculations found the long-term loss of prestress at mid-span, including 
for the effect of the wall dead load on the loss of prestress due to creep, as 22.0%.
Solution to (a). Final prestress at mid-span
At mid-span Rs=(1−0.22)=0.780 (a difference of 0.4% in Example 7.5); therefore, use 
the same prestress using Rs=0.777 and MsR =5.56 kNm.
Solution to (b). Maximum allowable effective span
The wall displaces floor finishes and live loads over a width of 130mm, giving an equiva￾lent wall load=3.0−0.13×(1.0+1.5)=2.675 kN/m. It is optional whether designers take 
advantage of this*. However, continuing with the equivalent load distributed over four 
beams
Wall load per beam=2.675/4=0.669 kN/m
Total UDL per beam ws=1.996+0.669=2.665 kN/m
L=√(8 MsR/ws)=√(8×5.56/2.665)=4.085m
*Taking 3 kN/m for the wall load, L=4.024m
Solution to (c). Maximum allowable effective span at the top fibre for 
quasi-permanent load
From Example 7.5. MsR,t=4.86 kNm.
Equivalent quasi-permanent wall load=3.0−0.13×(1.0+0.3×1.5)=2.812 kN/m/4 no. 
beams=0.702 kN/m per beam
Quasi-permanent imposed UDL per beam ws,qp =1.692+0.702=2.395 kN/m
Lqp =√(8 MsR/ws,qp)=√(8×4.86/2.395)=4.029 m<4.085m. Lqp is critical by a difference 
of 1.3% showing that the differences between the two conditions for limiting stresses at 
the top of the beam are not significant. *Taking 3 kN/m for the wall load the difference 
is 0.8%.
Example 7.7
Repeat Example 7.6 replacing the internal partition as a cross wall, perpendicular to and at 
mid-span. Previous in-house calculations found the long-term loss of prestress at mid-span, 
including for the effect of the wall dead load on the loss of prestress due to creep, as 23.0%.
Solution to (a). Final prestress at mid-span
At mid-span Rs=(1−0.23)=0.770 (a difference of 0.9% in Example 7.5) therefore use the 
same prestress using Rs=0.777 and MsR =5.56 kNm.
Solution to (b). Maximum allowable effective span
Equivalent cross wall load=2.675 kN/m
Point load per beam=0.290×2.675=0.776 kN
Maximum bending moment per beam Ms=1.996L2/8+0.776 L/4≤5.56 kNm
Solving the quadratic gives L=4.345m
Solution to (c). Maximum allowable effective span at the top fibre for 
quasi-permanent load
From Example 7.5. MsR,t=4.86 kNm.
From Example 7.6. Equivalent quasi-permanent cross wall load=2.812 kN/m
Point load per beam=0.290×2.812=0.815 kN
Ms,qp =1.692L2/8+0.815 L/4≤4.86 kNm
Solving the quadratic gives Lqp =4.335 m≈4.345m due to the relatively small point load.222 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
7.3 FLEXURAL CAPACITY AT HOLES AND NOTCHES IN SLABS
Holes and notches are permitted in wide flooring units, such as solid units and hcu, voided 
units, double tees and thermal slabs, although in the latter two, they are only formed through 
the top flange (not in webs). In this respect, the voids reduce MsR by about 5%–10% due to 
changes in cross-sectional properties, as the number of tendons is not reduced. For the case of 
a 1200mm wide×250mm depth thermal slab (Figure 7.13) containing a 500×500mm square 
hole in the top flange MsR reduces by 7.5% – in fact with the dispersion of prestress being 
uniform over a greater distance than the length of the hole, it is possible that the hole may 
have no effect on the moment of resistance, although this would not be the same for longer 
holes. Example 7.9 shows this in more detail. The design of the top flange has to be carefully 
checked, particularly for large holes up to ½ the width of the flange at the ultimate limit state.
This is not the case in solid and hcu, where both the cross-sectional properties and the 
pretensioning forces are reduced. Figures 7.14 and 7.15 show examples of holes and notches 
in some hcu. Figure 7.16 shows a corner notch being formed using a vacuum pump (holes 
mare formed likewise), but may also be formed manually using a trowel.
Figure 7.17 shows the positions and maximum recommended dimensions of voids in hcu 
produced by the Partek Company in Belgium. Table 7.6 shows the limits on geometry appli￾cable to Figure 7.17. Surprisingly, the design of hcu at voids is not included in BS EN 1168 
(BS EN 1168, 2005) but is included in the forthcoming FIB Manual on prestressed hcu, 
which also includes information of very wide holes.
Holes in the floor are dealt with in one of two ways depending on size. Small holes of less 
than about 600mm in size may be formed in the precast unit (except in 600mm wide hcu 
where the maximum size is 300mm) during the manufacturing stage and before the concrete 
has hardened. The rough edges are beneficial to the shear key with insitu concrete infill.
The maximum size of hole which may be formed in the units depends on the size of 
the voids in the slab and how many tendons may be removed without jeopardising the 
strength of the unit. For example, in a certain 200mm depth extruded hcu (e.g. Spiroll
type) the diameter of the void is 150mm and therefore a hole formed through the void 
may be of equal size. In a 200mm depth slip-formed hcu (e.g. Roth type) the diameter of 
a hole is limited to the width of the void which is only 100 mm. Small holes, up to about 
150mm diameter, can be core-drilled on site. The holes should pass through the hollow 
core, and the designers must be consulted if tendons are accidentally removed. This can 
impose quite severe restrictions on the M&E services, but a way of increasing freedom is to 
provide additional tendons in the units and to specify permitted ‘zones’ in which a limited

number of holes at a predetermined spacing and size may be site-drilled. Some manufac￾turers impose a maximum length of narrow voids (without further reference to the design 
office) as 2.0m.
Larger voids that are wider than the width of the precast units are ‘trimmed’ using trans￾verse supports such as steel angles (i.e. perpendicular to the span of the floor) as shown 
in Figure 7.18. A typical minimum section size for the steel trimmer is 100×100×8mm 
equal angle. The angles carry point loads to the edges of the adjacent units. The maximum 
practical size of hole is about 2.4 m×2.4m for normal office loading, but is less for superim￾posed floor loads greater than about 7.5 kN/m2. There is some additional margin of safety Flexural design in service 225

in the design of trimmer angles because the grouted longitudinal joints between the slabs 
will transfer some of the superimposed loading to adjacent slabs. The steel angles must be 
properly fire-protected either by precasting concrete to the soffit and sides of the angle or by 
spraying them with a fire-protective coating.
To calculate the prestress and moment of resistance (and shear capacity in Section 10.2.4) 
for units containing one or two holes in the span of the unit, and/or a notch removed from 
one or both ends of the basic (i.e. full width) unit, the reduction in cross-sectional properties 
are calculated based on the ratio of the width of the void wv to the average width of the unit 
(bave=(1197+1154)/2=1176mm), i.e. pro-rata wv/bave. Although this sounds like a crude 
approximation, the results are very close to a detailed calculation of the gross area and area 
of hollow cores removed at the void. The dimensions are specified from the effective sup￾port, i.e. centre of bearing, not the end of the unit. Some manufacturers imposed ‘cutting 
zones’, i.e. dimensions from the edges of units where cuts can be made, usually at the edges 
of the hollow cores, trying to avoid cutting through the centres of hollow cores, and at least

20mm from the edges of tendons. In double-tee or thermal slabs, the limitations are only 
between points about 50mm from the edges of the webs.
For example, in the hcu used in Example 7.1 (see Figures 6.7 and 7.19), the cutting 
positions are set at 20mm clear from the edge of the tendons, thus the width A to B 
wv=45+2×20=85mm minimum. The preferred width of holes in the body of the hcu is 
from A to C wv=85+180=265mm, which would involve a design where 4 no. strands are 
removed. It may be possible to increase the hole to wv=265+180−85=360mm, also with 
4 no. strands removed. Edge holes and notches are taken down from flooring layouts and 
measured from the nominal width of the hcu at point O (not at the actual edge). Thus the 
first edge hole from O to A is wv=(1200−4×180−85)/2=198mm (say 200mm). O to B is 
wv=285mm, and so on. The hcu shown in Figure 7.20 have 11 no. hollow cores at 100mm 
spacing is much more versatile as the cutting positions may be at the edges or several cores, 
at least up to the permitted width of the void.

the ratio wv/bave=265/1176=0.225, i.e. the remaining ratio is 1−0.225=0.775. Thus the 
remaining cross-sectional properties are Ac=0.775×168000=130200mm2, Ic=0.775×
1270×106 =984.25×106mm4, etc. The section properties, prestress and moments of resis￾tance are listed in Table 7.7 together with values derived using detailed calculation of the 
cross section. Note that the important parameters Ic,co and Zb,co differ by less than 0.86% 
and MsR by only 0.2%, showing that the pro-rata assumption is applicable. The ultimate 
moment of resistance MRd is not affected by the pro-rata assumption (see Section 9.3.4). Any 
local stress concentrations at corners are ignored.
If the centre of this hole is located at a distance x=6.0m from the left end support and 
has a length of 600mm, Table 7.7 gives MsR =125.63 kNm at the centre of the hole. The 
MsR at a distance of lpt from the ends of the hole, i.e. x=6.0−0.6/2−0.605=5.095m and 
6.905m are the same values as in the bending moment graph in Figure 7.11, i.e. MsR =179 
kNm to 157 kNm, respectively. Therefore, the hcu fails by at least 31 kNm – if the hcu was 
a single unit acting alone. However, in service the units are grouted together after installa￾tion, known as a ‘slab panel’, and due to the lateral distribution of section properties over 
adjacent units, provided that there are no holes in the adjacent units, the net prestress may 
be averaged over the width of 3 no. units, or 2 no. units if the hcu is at a free edge. After 
subtracting the bending stress due to self-weight σs,0 =Ms,0/Zb,co for each of the three units, 
the net prestress is
σb,net=[2 (σb −σs,0) (full unit)+(σb −σs,0) (with hole)]/3 (7.41)
The section modulus Zb,co may also be averaged over three units, as228 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Zb,co,net=[2 Zb,co (full)+Zb,co (with hole)]/3 (7.42)
Then MsR,net=Ms,0 +(σb,net+fctm) Zb,co,net (7.43a)
or MsR,net=Ms,0 +σb,net Zb,co,net for exposure class>XC1 (7.43b)
The basis for this is that if point and line loads can be laterally distributed between adjacent 
units in the floor panel, and a hole is considered structurally as a ‘dead weight’, then the 
dead weight may be distributed too.
Figure 7.21 summarises the positions where design capacities are calculated near holes 
and notches. For service moments the full MsR is at a one basic transmission length lpt
from the edge of the voids, and for ultimate moments the full MRd (Chapter 9) is at a

equal to the height of the centroid yb from the edge of the void. Note that Figure 7.21 
is reversible, such that the left end notch is considered in the same manner, and if 
the hole is closer to the left end of the span, the conditions are checked at that end. Figure 
7.22 shows the development of prestress and MsR at and between end notches and holes.
Example 7.8
The hcu shown in Figure 6.7 contains a hole of width wv=265mm between planes A and 
C as shown in Figure 7.19. The hole is located at a distance x=6.0m from the left end 
support, and has a length of 600mm. This hcu is grouted between two adjacent units at 
installation. Using the information given in Table 7.7 for the section properties and pre￾stress of the three hcu, calculate the net MsR,net for the units and check the design moment 
Ms at the centre of the hole using the UDL given in Example 7.1.
Solution
The design moment due to self-weight (including infilled joints) at x=6.0m from the sup￾port is Ms,0 =ws,0L x/2−ws,0 x2/2 where (from Example 7.1) ws0 =1.2×3.633=4.36 kN/m.
Then Ms,0 =4.36×9.8×6.0/2–4.36×6.02/2=49.70 kNm
In the hcu with the hole, σs,0 =49.70/8.256=6.02 N/mm2
In the basic units, σs,0 =49.70/10.705=4.64 N/mm2
From Table 7.7, Eq. 7.41. Prestress at the bottom σb,net=[2×(12.94−4.64)+(11.42−
6.02)]/3=7.333 N/mm2
From Table 7.7, Eq. 7.42. Zb,co,net=(2×10.325+7.998)/3=9.889×106mm3
MsR,net=49.70+[(7.333+3.80)×9.889]=159.80 kNm
The design UDL (from Example 7.1) ws=1.2×(3.633+1.8+1.5+0.5+5.0)=14.92 kN/m.
Ms=14.92×9.8×6.0/2–14.92×6.02/2=170.09 kNm>159.80 kNm, the slab panel fails 
by 10.3 kNm. In fact at the start of the hole, where x=5.7m from the support Ms is 
slightly greater, the panel fails by 14.1 kNm, or by 8.7%.
Figure 7.23 shows the complete bending moment diagrams for the characteristic design 
moment Ms and MsR.
The hcu in Figure 7.19 also contains an end notch from O to B of width wv=285mm and 
600mm length, in which 2 no. webs and 3 no. tendons are removed. The section proper￾ties and prestress at end notches are not laterally distributed between adjacent units. The 
resulting MsR at the notch is MsR =125.7 kNm at x=0.6m, increasing to MsR =171.1 kNm 
at x+lpt=1.205m. These values are also shown in Figure 7.23.
If there are two corner notches, their width is totalled as one notch width, and the 
greater length is considered, i.e. two notches 50 wide×100mm long and 75×75mm 
equates to a single notch 125mm wide×100 long. The single notch does not have to be 
located at corners, it may be cut anywhere within the width. If two holes are present, they 
are considered individually, even if they are side by side – their collective reductions in 
capacity are subtracted from the basic unit. Holes cut exclusively through the hollow core 230 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
are not considered in the structural appraisal. The reduction in self-weight due to the hole 
and notches is generally ignored in design. The reduced flexural stiffness at holes is not 
considered in the calculation of camber and deflection.
An alternative method to the design of slabs containing holes, as practised by some 
design engineers, is to consider the width of the hole as an effective ‘dead weight’ acting 
on a full width unit. Here the self-weight and imposed dead and live loads acting over 
the width of the hole are added to the loads acting on the full width unit based on the 
section properties of the full width unit. This is effectively reverse logic to the above 
where the net section properties are used. The procedure can only be used for UDL’s, 
not point or line loads, and only where the tendons are uniformly distributed across the 
width of the unit such that the loss of resistance at the hole is roughly proportional to the 
width of the hole. To check this solution, consider that, for the 265mm width of hole in 
Example 7.8, the self-weight and imposed dead and live loads are 3.633 and 8.80 kN/m2, 
respectively. After grouting, the imposed load is distributed over the width of three 
units such that the equivalent width of the hole is 265/3=88mm. The equivalent ‘dead 
weight’ is 3.633 (1.2+0.265)+8.80 (1.2+0.088)=16.66 kN/m and equivalent Ms=194.6 
kNm>MsR =178.9 kNm at the start of the hole for the full width unit by 8.8%. For this 
particular example, this is almost exactly the same as shown at the end of Example 7.8.
Example 7.9
The 1200mm width×250mm depth thermal slab shown in Figure 7.13 contains a hole 
of 500mm width in the top flange. The hole is located at mid-span of a simply supported 
span of 6.0m. This thermal slab is grouted between two adjacent slabs at installation. 
Using the information given in Table 7.8 for the section properties and prestress of the 
three slabs, calculate the net MsR,net for the slabs. The self-weight of the thermal slab 
(including infilled joints) is 2.75 kN/m. The slab is to be used at the ground floor using 
exposure class XC3.

Solution
The design moment at the hole due to self-weight Ms,0 =2.75×6.02/8=12.375 kNm
In the slab with the hole, σs,0 =12.375/2.659=4.65 N/mm2
In the basic slabs, σs,0 =12.375/2.953=4.19 N/mm2

6.44 N/mm2
From Table 7.7, Eq. 7.42. Zb,co,net=(2×2.953+2.659)/3=2.855×106mm3
MsR,net=Ms,0 +[(σb,net+fctm)×Zb,co,net] where fctm =0 for exposure XC3
MsR,net=12.375+[(6.44+0)×2.855]=30.75 kNm a reduction of only 2.4% from the 
basic slab MsR =31.50 kNm.
7.4 FLEXURAL DESIGN OF PRESTRESSED MAIN BEAMS
The design procedure is identical to the design of prestressed floor units given in Section 
7.2 with the additional consideration of satisfying transfer, as well as working, stress con￾ditions. This is because strands can be either deflected or debonded. There is much more 
freedom in selecting the strand pattern than in floor units as the design of the beam can 
be optimised (= economy of strands) by choosing a pattern that will simultaneously satisfy 
transfer at the ends of the beam and working loads at the point of maximum imposed 
bending moment.
Tables 9.9 and 9.10 give the minimum value of MsR for a range of typical sizes for 
prestressed inverted-tee beams using fck =45 and 50 N/mm2, respectively. The different

strengths are used to demonstrate the potential increases in MsR. Note that the transfer 
strength in both cases remains fck(t)=30 N/mm2. In compiling the tables, the tendons were 
arranged for case so that the prestress at transfer was in the range σb(t)=14.5 to 15.0 N/mm2, 
values that included a reduction for the self-weight at transfer. Figure 2.35 gives an ulti￾mate beam load vs. clear span for a range of 600mm wide inverted-tee beams using fck =45 
N/mm2. The tendons were arranged so that σb(t)=14.2 to 14.8 N/mm2, also including the 
top and bottom fibre stresses due to self-weight at transfer. For a typical arrangement of a 
6m span floor slab and internal beam for office loading, the imposed ultimate beam load 
is about 80 kN/m. Therefore, according to Figure 2.35 the clear span/beam depth ratio is 
about 14 irrespective of depth.
Example 7.10
Complete the design of the inverted-tee beam in Example 6.2, as shown in Figure 6.10 
to determine the critical service moment of resistance. Exposure class is XC1. The 
flooring is to be used for offices. The beam is simply supported between 300 mm wide 
columns at 9.0 m centres, and is supported on to 200 mm length corbels. The self-weight 
of floor slab = 18.0 kN/m, other dead loads = 10.0 kN/m and imposed live load = 30.0 
kN/m. Geometric and material data given by the manufacturer are as follows:

The reduction in elastic shortening and creep losses at mid-span increased the prestress 
there by 3.8%. Note that this is much less than 8.1% in Example 7.1 for the hcu, due

69×8.502/8=403.59 kNm <<544.28 kNm, clearly not critical.
Therefore, as per the discussion regarding non-linear creep in Eq. 7.6 and illustrated in 
Example 7.5, the limiting compressive stress is 0.45 fcm(t0)=0.45×(45+8)=23.85 N/mm2.
Then MsR,t=(23.85−1.22)×25.351=635.55 kNm>599.74 kNm. Therefore, the criti￾cal MsR =599.74 kNm
The characteristic design load ws=(7.688+18.0+10.0+30.0)=65.69 kN/m.
Then Ms=65.69×8.502/8=593.24 kNm<599.74 kNm

σt=((2304984/307500)+(2304984×92.86/24685)=−1.17 N/mm2 >−3.80 N/mm2
MsR at the support is the lesser of
MsR,b (bottom stress)=(14.58+3.80)×31.683=582.2 kNm
MsR,t (top stress)=(23.85−1.17)×25.351=634.4 kNm
The distribution of MsR between support and mid-span is taken as parabolic to mimic the 
parabolic distribution of bending stress due to self-weight and dead loads.
MsR at the ends of the unit MsR,b =fctm Zb,co =3.80×31.683=120.4 kNm
Between the end of the span and x=lpt the increase in σb,x is per Eq. 7.39. At 
x=lpt=0.680m (see Section 10.2.2 for the derivation of lpt) σb,x =14.57 N/mm2. From Eq. 
7.40, MsR,x =(σb,x +fctm) Zb,co =581.9 kNm.
Figure 7.24 shows the complete bending moment diagrams for the characteristic design 
moment Ms and MsR. The design is completed for ultimate moment, shear forces and 
deflections in Examples 9.5, 10.6 and 11.2.
If the exposure class is XC3, MsR,b =(15.13+0)×31.683=479.48 kNm and, as before, 
MsR,t=544.28 kNm>479.48 kNm. MsR is also greater than Ms,qp =403.59 kNm by a mar￾gin of 1.19, clearly not critical compared with exposure class XC1.
Example 7.11
Repeat Example 7.10 by using debonded strands up to a distance of ¼ span to determine 
the maximum moment of resistance for the beam.Flexural design in service 235
Solution
The allowable prestress at the bottom of the beam at the point where the strands are 
debonded is 0.6 fck(t)=18.00 N/mm2.
The bending stress due to the self-weight of the beam at x=¼ span σs0,x =Ms0,x/Zb,co, where 
Ms0,x =0.75* x mid-span moment of 69.43=52.07 kNm. Then σs0,x =52.07/31.683=1.64 
N/mm2. (Zb,co is from Example 7.10.) *For UDL only the bending moment at ¼ span is ¾
of the moment at mid-span.
Therefore, the maximum permitted prestress in the bottom of the beam=18.00+1.64=
19.64 N/mm2.
Due to complex relationships between initial prestress, losses and eccentricity, it is not 
possible to back calculate the required arrangement of strand, and therefore the final 
solution is a forward calculation based on the above assumptions.

Design for bending moments 
using the Magnel diagrams
8.1 BACKGROUND TO THE MAGNEL DIAGRAMS
In the design of prestressed elements, chiefly beams and slabs, the limiting stresses in the top 
and bottom fibres of the section are checked against prestress at transfer and in-service plus 
the bending stresses due to the minimum Ms,min and maximum Ms,max service moments at 
critical sections along the span of the element. In Chapter 6, Figure 6.1c shows the require￾ments at transfer at section A, where it is explained in Section 6.1 that this plane is critical 
at the end of the basic transmission length lpt (measured from the end of the element). Figures 
6.1c and 7.10 show the requirements in service at section B, i.e. at the point of maximum ser￾vice moment. In the worked examples in Chapters 6 and 7, the prestressing data are given, 
and the task was to determine the service moment of resistance MsR based on the top and 
bottom fibre stresses σt
 and σb, and to check the prestress at transfer σt(t) and σb(t). Thus, 
there are four fibre stresses to determine.
This is generally the approach of in-house precast concrete manufacturers who hold a 
database of predetermined arrays of tendons for a range of prestressed beams and slabs, 
typically in incremental steps of 50mm for depth and/or width. In other cases, the design 
procedure is carried out in reverse, in which σt
 and σb etc. are determined from the given 
values of Ms,min and Ms,max and the limiting stresses shown in Figure 6.1c. The goal of this 
procedure is to determine the initial pretensioning force Ppi=σpi Ap (Eq. 6.2) and eccentricity 
zcp of the tendons at critical sections along the span.
If a single value for Ppi and zcp is found at planes A and B, the number of tendons is 
constant along the length of the element, as found in Example 7.10, and no debonding or 
deflecting of tendons is required. However, Example 7.11 was devised to show where differ￾ent values for Ppi and zcp are required at the positions of Ms,max and Ms,min, with the change￾over (end of debonding) taking place at ¼ span. In this case, there are eight fibre stresses to 
determine – four at transfer at lpt and ¼ span, and four in service at ¼ span and mid-span (or 
at the position of Ms,max). It is not always desirable to use the ¼ span position, although this 
is most commonly used, as it can also be at about 1/5 span.
Calladine (2006) introduces this subject as follows
The engineer normally assumes that the concrete material is linear-elastic and initially 
stress free; and thus at every cross-section the longitudinal component of stress always 
varies linearly with depth in the beam. Consequently, the extreme stresses within a 
cross-section at any given time can occur only at the top and bottom surfaces of the 
beam. The stress limits at the extreme bending moments therefore yield in principle 
four inequalities that must be satisfied at every cross-section: two at the top and two 
at the bottom. If the shape of the cross-section has been (tentatively) decided upon, 
these four inequalities involve two variables which the engineer must eventually fix: the

prestressing force and the eccentricity of the resultant prestress force within the cross￾section. As is well known, G. Magnel (Magnel 1948) devised a two-dimensional plot 
or diagram on which these four inequalities could be displayed simultaneously as four 
straight lines.
Gustaaf Magnel (1889–1955) was a professor at Ghent University in Belgium, known for 
his expertise in reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete. Known as the ‘Magnel’ dia￾gram, the equalities of top and bottom fibre stresses shown in Figure 6.1c may be plotted 
as straight lines in terms of 1/Ppi and zcp (keeping the notation of Eurocodes, although most 
texts show these as 1/P0 and e. In some texts the axes are switched with 1/P0 as the abscissa.) 
Adapting and re-arranging Eqs. 5.6, 5.7a and 5.7b at transfer, and Eqs. 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3a,b,c 
in service, leads to the four equations as 1/Ppi=C+m zcp, where C is a constant and gives 
the intersection of the straight line where zcp =0, and m is the gradient of the straight line. 
Figure 8.1 shows the construction of a typical Magnel diagram, in which the arrows on the 
straight lines give the permissible zone where the critical values of 1/Ppi and zcp are found. 
(Arrows pointing upwards means that 1/Ppi should be greater than the equation of the 
straight line.) The shaded trapezoidal zone is therefore the ‘design zone’. If one zone satis￾fies the stresses at Ms,max and Ms,min then one set of values for Ppi and zcp is required, and all 
tendons may run uninterrupted along the entire span.
In Figure 8.1, point A gives the lowest value of Ppi (and hence the cheapest solution with 
the least number of tendons) but the greatest eccentricity zcp, which may not be achiev￾able in certain beams and slabs, particularly where splitting and spalling stresses are a 
problem. Point B gives the greatest Ppi and lowest zcp. The best solution may be somewhere 
between the two, particularly as the final eccentricity cannot be guaranteed to be exactly 
at the chosen point as tendons (in beams) are typically positioned in an array of 50 mm 
increments.
The Magnel diagram may also contain a vertical straight line indicating the maximum 
achievable value for zcp,max. This is found by some prior knowledge of the total number 
of tendons required, and where the tendons can or must be positioned within the cross 
section. For example, in beams, most of the tendons will be positioned in the bottom 2 
or 3 rows at 50mm apart, with 2 no. tendons at the top of the beam. For example in a 
600×600mm wide beam, 11 no. tendons will be positioned at 50mm from the bottom, 11 
no. at 100mm and 2 no. at 550mm. Then the centroid ys=114.6mm and zcp,max =300−114.
6=185.4mm. This vertical straight line may/not cut across the design zone.

Figure 8.2 shows a possible situation where there is no single design zone. In this case, 
Ms,max is greater and this drags down the dashed line representing the stresses at the bottom 
of the section to below the solid line for the stresses at transfer. In this case, an intermediate 
design point is required, at say ¼ span.
The Magnel diagrams look easy to construct, but care has to be taken when setting up 
the equations of equalities as will be shown in the worked examples, especially when deal￾ing with the units of 1/Ppi. It is also not easy to visualise the various states of stress at the 
sections, particularly as the y-axis is 1/Ppi rather than Ppi itself, and it is difficult to visualise 
where an intermediate point (e.g. ¼ span) is introduced. For these reasons, the author prefers 
the alternative version of the diagram, described in Section 8.4, in which the required pre￾stress σt
 and σb are established as a set of stress ‘boxes’ at Ms,min, Ms,qt at ¼ span and Ms,max. 
This method is also much easier to teach to students.

Note when calculating bending stresses, the compound section modulus Zt,co is used (see 
Section 6.2.4). Because this is not known at the start of the calculation, the basic section 
modulus may be multiplied by 1.05.
Then Rtr Ppi (1/Ac−zcp/Zt

)/( −fctm(t)−Msw/Zt,co) (8.4)
However, note that the denominator (−fctm(t)−Msw/Zt,co) will be negative, then the equality 
1/Ppi≤changes to 1/Ppi ≥.

Z=8.40×106mm3. Maximum eccentricity is based on 5 no. tendons at 50mm and 5 no. at 
100mm from the soffit, giving zcp,max =200−75=125mm.
Eq. 8.5 Denominator (−fctm(t)−Msw/Zt,co)=−2.72−(4.86/8.40)=−3.30 N/mm2.

Completing Example 8.1
Eq. 8.17 Denominator -fctm +Ms,max/Zb,co =−3.80+(157.5/8.40)=14.95 N/mm2.
C=[0.80 (1/120×103)]/14.95=0.4458×10−6
m=[0.80/8.00×106]/14.95=0.00669×10−6
Then 1/Ppi≤0.4458×10−6 +0.00669×10−6 zcp (units in 1/N)244 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Converting to kN and expressing as 1/Ppi×103

where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =−0.4458/0.00669=−66.7mm
where zcp,max =125mm, 1/Ppi≥0.4458+0.00669×125=1.282×10−3 kN−1
The straight lines for Exp. 4t and 4b are shown in Figure 8.4. The (shaded) design 
zone is bound by the four lines, limited chiefly by the service stress at the bottom 
fibre at mid-span (line 4b) and the transfer stress (lines 1t and 1b). The least value 
of Ppi, and hence the least number of tendons, is at point B where zcp =97.9mm 
and Ppi=908.7 kN. If the initial pretensioning force per 9.3mm diameter strand is 
0.7×1770×52×10−3 =64.4 kN, the number of strands is N≥14.1. Rounding up to 
N=15 gives zcp =88.1mm and Ppi=966.4 kN. Using an array of tendons at 50mm 
increments, this is best achieved using 5, 4, 4 and 2 strands at 50, 100, 150 and 200mm 
above the soffit, giving zcp =90.0mm. This final ‘design point’ is shown in Figure 8.4, 
and also shown in Figure 8.3 satisfying transfer stresses close to the intersection of lines 
1t and 1b at point A.
The calculation to check the losses of prestress at transfer and in service, viz. Rtr and 
Rs, and the assumption that Zb,co =1.05 Zb, etc. together with the final stress inequalities, 
may be carried out as per the design procedures given in Chapters 6 and 7. For this beam, 
it is found that Rtr=0.936 (0.93 assumed), Rs=0.787 (0.80), Zb,co/Zb =1.04 (1.05) and 
Zt,co/Zt=1.02 (1.05). Inserting these values into the Magnel diagram point B reduces zcp
by 0.9mm and increases Ppi by 3% to 941 kN, or N=14.6 strands, the major contribu￾tor to this difference being Rs (accounting for 2% of the increase). It may therefore be 
prudent to slightly overestimate the losses in service. However, none of these corrections 
changed the final design input data in this example.

8.3 CALLADINE’S IMPROVEMENT OF THE MAGNEL DIAGRAM
8.3.1 Background to Calladine’s work
One of the main problems in using the traditional Magnel diagram, shown in Figures 8.2 
and 8.4, is the very narrow design zone (shaded area) due to the similar gradient of lines 1b 
(transfer) and 4b (service), particularly in rectangular beams where Zb =Zt.
Calladine (Calladine, 2006) proposed an improvement by defining a ‘new’ dimensionless 
ordinate Ppi zcp/Zt σmax (previously 1/Ppi), where σmax is the maximum compressive stress 
allowed, i.e. 0.6 fck(t) at transfer and 0.45 fcm in service, and defining a ‘new’ dimension￾less abscissa p=Ppi/A σmax (previously zcp). In this book, the dimensionless ordinate is given 
as y=Ppi zcp/Zt σmax. Although the arithmetic required to derive the four inequalities is 
quite tedious, the final equations are simple, but not particularly easy to understand. In 
Calladine’s paper, the allowable tensile stresses fctm and fctm(t) were both set to zero, and the 
transfer condition was not included, making the equations appear even more simple. Note 
that in deriving Ppi from the new diagram, Calladine did not use the residual prestress ratios 
Rtr and Rs, nor the compound section modulus Zt,co, which gives a small, but sometimes not 
insignificant, reduction in Ppi. However, the result, shown in Figure 8.5, gives a design zone 
from which it is easy to find a design point. The derivation of the four equalities is as fol￾lows, given in the same sequence as before. This is followed by Example 8.2, a new version 
but a repeat of the beam in Example 8.1.
In Figure 8.5 point A gives the lowest value of Ppi but the greatest eccentricity zcp, which 
may not be achievable in certain beams and slabs. The limiting maximum eccentricity zcp,max
may or may not be critical, usually it is not. Point B gives the greatest Ppi and lowest zcp.
Calladine’s dimensionless notations are

p=Ppi/A σmax at transfer (8.20a)
p=Ppi/A σmax in service (8.20b)
To use Calladine’s method, a single value of σmax has to be chosen to satisfy the four inequal￾ities at the same time. In the following analysis, this is chosen as the maximum compression 
at the top of the section, i.e. σmax =0.45 fcm. Also Q=Zb,co/Zt,co because both compound val￾ues are assumed to be factored by the same amount, in this case 1.05.
8.3.2 Transfer inequalities
8.3.2.1 Transfer stress at the top fibre
Referring to Figure 6.1c and Eqs. 5.7a and 5.7b, and from Eq. 8.1a
Rtr Ppi/Ac−Rtr Ppi zcp/Zt+Mmin/Zt,co ≥−fctm(t) (8.1b)
where Mmin is the moment Msw at the end of the transfer length
Then, dividing through by 0.45 fcm
Rtr p−Rtr y≥−m- −fctm(t)/0.45 fcm (8.21)
Finally y≤(m-+fctm(t)/0.45 fcm)/Rtr+p (8.22)
The gradient of the line in Callendine’s diagram is +1 and the intercept with the y-axis is 
(m+ +fctm(t)/0.45 fcm)/Rtr. Using the same notation as in Figure 8.4, the line is called 1t (1 for 
near to support and t for the top of the section).
8.3.2.2 Transfer stress at the bottom fibre
Referring to Figure 6.1c and Eq. 6.6
Rtr Ppi/Ac+Rtr Ppi zcp/Zb −Msw/Zb,co ≤0.6 fck(t) (8.6)
Then, multiplying through by Q/0.45 fcm
Rtr Q p+Rtr y – m–≤Q 0.6 fck(t)/0.45 fcm (8.23)
where m–=Mmin/Zt,co σmax
Multiplying by Q converts Zb to Zt
 and converts Zb,co to Zt,co
Finally y≤(m-+Q 0.6 fck(t)/0.45 fcm)/Rtr−Q p (8.24)
The gradient of the line 1b is -Q and the intercept with the y-axis is (m+ +Q 0.6 fck(t)/0.45 
fcm)/Rtr.
8.3.3 Service inequalities
8.3.3.1 Service stress at the top fibre
Referring to Figure 6.1c and Eqs. 5.7a and 5.7bDesign for bending moments using the Magnel diagrams 247
Rs Ppi/Ac−Rs Ppi zcp/Zt+Ms,max/Zt,co ≤0.45 fcm (8.10)
Then, dividing through by 0.45 fcm
Rs p−Rs y+m+ ≤1 (8.25)
where p=Ppi/Ac σmax
and y=Ppi zcp/Zt σmax
and m+ =Mmax/Zt,co σmax
x by −1 and rearrange
Rs y≥(m+ −1)+Rs p (8.26)
Finally y≥(m+ −1)/Rs+p (8.27)
The gradient of the line is +1 and the intercept with the y-axis is (m+ −1)/Rs. Using the same 
notation as in Figure 8.4, the line is called 4t (4 for mid-span and t for top of section).
8.3.3.2 Service stress at the bottom fibre
Referring to Figure 6.1c and Eq. 6.6
Rs Ppi/Ac+Rs Ppi zcp/Zb −Ms,max/Zb,co ≥−fctm (8.14)
Then, multiplying through by Q/0.45 fcm
Rs Q p+Rs y−m+ ≥− Q fctm/0.45 fcm (8.28)
where m+ =Mmax/Zt,co σmax
Finally y≥(m+ −Q fctm/0.45 fcm)/Rs−Q p (8.29)
The gradient of the line 4b is −Q and the intercept with the y-axis is (m+ −Q fctm/0.45 fcm)/Rs.
Of course the common denominator σmax can take any value because it is present in all 
four equations. If it is omitted or set equal to unity, then y and p take the form of prestresses 
Ppi zcp/Zt
 and Ppi/Ac, respectively, and the Magnel diagram shown in Figure 8.6 will take the 
same form, but with larger scales.
The gradient of Calladine’s diagram is zcp Ac/Zt. Therefore, if the maximum eccentricity 
zcp,max is known a straight line may be plotted with the gradient of zcp,max Ac/Zt
 below which 
lies the permissible design zone.

Figure 8.6 Straight lines 1t, 1b, 4t and 4b in Calladine’s version of the Magnel diagram for Example 8.2.Design for bending moments using the Magnel diagrams 249
The four straight lines and the plot for zcp,max for are shown in Figure 8.6. The (shaded) 
design zone is bound by the four lines, limited chiefly by the service stress at the bottom 
fibre at mid-span (line 4b) and the transfer stress (lines 1t and 1b). The least value of 
Ppi, and hence the least number of tendons, is at point B. Then from Exp. 1t=Exp. 4b, 
0.1488+p=0.7838- p. Hence p=0.3175 and Ppi=0.3175×120000×23.85/103=908.7 kN 
(same as in Example 8.1). This gives 14.1 strands, which is rounded to 15 no. From Exp. 
1t, y=0.1488+0.3175=0.4663. Then zcp =0.4663×8.0×106 ×23.85/908700=97.9mm 
(same as in Example 8.1). For the same reasons that were given in Example 8.1, the final 
design point shown in Figure 8.6 has a slightly greater Ppi for 15 no. strands and lower 
zcp =90.0mm.
Example 8.3
Draw the traditional Magnel diagram (i.e. 1/Ppi vs zcp) for the 600×600mm wide inverted 
tee beam shown in Figure 8.9. The loads, span, and materials are the same as in Examples 
6.2 and 7.11, except that here the minimum bending moment due to self-weight is taken at 
the end of the transmission length, assumed as 600mm. Then Msw =7.688×8.50×0.60/2–
7.688×0.602/2=18.22 kNm.
Solution
First consider the transfer condition and construct lines 1t and 1b near to the support 
and lines 2t and 2b at ¼ span. Using Rtr=0.93, fck(t)=30 N/mm2, fctm(t)=2.72 N/mm2, 
Msw =18.22 kNm near to the support, and Msw,qt=52.07 kNm at ¼ span. Section 
properties are: Ac=307.5×103mm2, Zb =30.215×106mm3, Zt=24.685×106mm3, 
Zb,co =31.726×106mm3 and Zt,co =25.920×106mm3. Maximum eccentricity is based on 
11 no. tendons at 50mm and 11 no. at 100mm from the soffit and 2 no. at 50mm from 
the top, giving zcp,max =155.2mm.
Construct line 1t at the top at transfer near to the support
Eq. 8.5 Denominator (−fctm(t)−Msw/Zt,co)=−2.72−(18.22/25.920)=−3.424 N/mm2.
C=[0.93 (1/307.5×103)]/ −3.424=−0.8832×10−6
m=−[0.93/24.685×106]/ −3.424=0.0110×10−6
Then 1/Ppi≥−0.8832×10−6 +0.0110×10−6 zcp (units in 1/N)
Converting to kN and expressing as 1/Ppi×103
103/Ppi≥−0.8832+0.0110 zcp …(1t)
where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =+0.8832/0.0110=80.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥−0.8832+0.0110×155.2=0.824×10−3 kN−1
Construct line 2t at the top at transfer at ¼ span
Eq. 8.5 Denominator (-fctm(t)−Msw,qt/Zt,co)=−2.72−(52.07/25.920)=−4.730 N/mm2.
Then following the procedure above, and converting to kN and expressing as 1/Ppi×103
103/Ppi≥−0.6394+0.00796 zcp …(2t)
where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =+0.6394/0.00796=80.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥−0.6394+0.00796×155.2=0.597×10−3 kN−1
Construct line 1b at the bottom at transfer near to the support
Eq. 8.9 Denominator (0.6 fck(t)+Msw/Zb,co)=(18.00+18.22/31.726)=18.574 N/mm2.
Then 103/Ppi≥0.1628+0.00166 zcp …(1b)
where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =−0.1628/0.00166=−98.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.1628+0.00166×155.2=0.420×10−3 kN−1
Note where zcp =0, 1/Ppi≥0.1628×10−3 kN−1
−0.8832+0.0110 zcp =0.1628+0.00166 zcp250 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Construct line 2b at the bottom at transfer at ¼ span
Eq. 8.9 Denominator (0.6 fck(t)+Msw,qt/Zb,co)=18.00+(52.07/31.726)=19.641 N/mm2.
Then 103/Ppi≥0.1540+0.00157 zcp …(2b)
where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =−0.1540/0.00157=−98.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.1540+0.00157×155.2=0.397×10−3 kN−1
Note that the transfer condition at mid-span is not critical as Ms/Zb,co =−69.4×106/31.7
25×106 =−2.19 N/mm2 which is greater than fctm(t)=−2.72 N//mm2 so the prestressing 
requirement is zero.
The straight lines for Exp. 1t, 1b, 2t and 2b are shown in Figure 8.7. As expected the 
critical point A is near to the support where lines 1t and 1b intersect. Then from Exp. 
1t=Exp. 1b, −0.8832+0.0110 zcp =0.1628+0.00166 zcp. Hence zcp =111.9mm and 103/
Ppi≥0.1628+0.00166×111.9=0.3483, hence Ppi≤2871.0 kN. If the initial pretension￾ing force per 12.5mm diameter strand is 0.7×1770×93×10−3 =115.23 kN, the num￾ber of strands is N≤24.92. Keeping symmetry and rounding down to N=24 no. gives 
Ppi=2765.4 kN and zcp =113.1mm. The final arrangement of strands is given after the 
service requirements are determined.
Comparing with the results from Example 6.2, where the transfer condition was calcu￾lated at the support so that Msw =0, and the limiting tensile stress at transfer was limited 
to 50%×fctm(t)=1.36 N/mm2, using the Magnel diagram, the number of strands required 
is 26.67 (the same as in Example 6.2) and the eccentricity for 26 strands is zcp =92mm 
(the same as in Example 6.2).
At the service condition construct lines 3t and 3b at ¼ span and lines 4t and 4b at mid￾span. Use Rs=0.80, fck =45 N/mm2, fcm =53 N/mm2, fctm =3.80 N/mm2, Ms,qt=481.30 kNm 
at ¼ span and Ms,max =641.73 kNm at mid-span. Exposure classification XC1, then 
fctm =3.80 N/mm2 (note Example 8.4 checks the same beam for exposure XC3).
Construct line 3t at the top in service at ¼ span
Eq. 8.13 Denominator 0.45 fcm −Ms,qt/Zt,co =23.85−(481.30/25.920)=+5.281 N/mm2.

where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥−2.8631+0.03567×155.2=2.672×10−3 kN−1

Eq. 8.17 Denominator -fctm +Ms,max/Zb,co =−3.80+(641.73/31.726)=16.432 N/mm2.
Then 103/Ppi≤0.1583+0.00161 zcp …(4b)
where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =−0.1583/0.00161=−98.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.1583+0.00161×155.2=0.408×10−3 kN−1
The straight lines for Exp. 3t, 3b, 4t and 4b are shown in Figure 8.8. The ¼ span position 
is not critical, and considering the mid-span position alone, the design zone extends from 
point A where, by the equality Exp. 4t =Exp. 4b, zcp = 88.7 mm up to zcp,max = 155.2 mm 
where Ppi is the smallest but no doubt impractical value. However, the transfer condi￾tion at top fibre and at ¼ span, given by line 2t, limits the design zone at point B where 
by the equality Exp. 2t =Exp. 4b, −0.6394 + 0.00796 zcp = 0.1583 + 0.00161 zcp Hence 
zcp = 125.6 mm and 103/Ppi ≤ 0.1583 + 0.00161 × 125.6 = 0.361, hence Ppi ≥ 2772.9 kN 
requiring N ≥ 24.1 strands. The eccentricity of 125.6 mm is rather too large to achieve 
for a reasonable distribution of strands (it can be achieved by placing 20 no. strands in 
the bottom three rows, but this may lead to problems with splitting or in controlling 
camber), therefore try N = 27 no. strands giving Ppi = 3111.1 kN and zcp ≥ 101.2 mm.
To achieve the number of strands and eccentricity, having established N=27 no. strands 
at zcp ≥101.2mm, the strands are arranged in the beam as shown in Figure 8.9 as follows:

Figure 8.9 Final arrangement of strands in the inverted tee beam in Example 8.3.Design for bending moments using the Magnel diagrams 253
The actual eccentricity zcp =yb −ys=269.78−166.7=103.1mm, closest possible to 
101.2mm in the available array of tendon positions.
At the support zcp =yb −ys=269.78−4100/24=99.0mm.
The design points are shown in Figures 8.7 and 8.8.
The final prestress and bending stresses are
At transfer σt(t)+Msw/Zt,co =−1.95+0.70=−1.24>−2.72 N/mm2
σb(t)−Msw/Zb,co =+16.79−0.57=+16.22<+18.00 N/mm2
In service σt+Ms,max/Zt,co =−2.30+24.76=+22.46<+23.85 N/mm2
σb −Ms,max/Zb,co =+16.59−20.23=−3.64>−3.80 N/mm2
A full analysis of the beam in service, based on the procedures given in Chapter 7, give 
Rs=0.790, and hence σb −Ms,max/Zb,co =+16.38−20.23=−3.85<−3.80 N/mm2 (not OK). 
However, the compound Zb,co =31.822×106mm3 is such that the actual moment of resis￾tance MsR =(16.38+3.80)×31.822=641.94≈641.73 kNm. The actual MsR based on the 
top fibre stresses is 663 kNm and clearly not critical.
Example 8.4
Repeat Example 8.3 for the service condition only for exposure classification XC3 and a 
quasi-permanent factor ψ2 =0.6 (e.g. congregation). Use Rs=0.80, fck =45 N/mm2, fcm =53 
N/mm2, fctm =3.80 N/mm2, Ms,qt=385.47 kNm at ¼ span and Ms,max =513.96 kNm at 
mid-span, i.e. 80.1% of the moments in Example 8.3. For XC3 fctm =zero.
Solution

where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.2896−0.00361×155.2=−0.270×10−3 kN−1
Construct line 3b at the bottom in service at ¼ span

where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.2141+0.00218×155.2=0.552×10−3 kN−1
Construct line 4t at the top in service at mid-span
Eq. 8.13 Denominator 0.45 fcm −Ms,max/Zt,co =23.85- (513.96/25.920)=4.021 N/mm2.

where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =−0.6470/−0.00806=80.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.6470−0.00806×155.2=−0.604×10−3 kN−1
Construct line 4b at the bottom in service at mid-span
Eq. 8.17 Denominator -fctm +Ms,max/Zb,co =0+(513.96/31.726)=16.200 N/mm2.
103/Ppi≤0.1606+0.00163 zcp …(4b)
where 103/Ppi=0, zcp =−0.1606/0.00163=−98.3mm
where zcp,max =155.2mm, 1/Ppi≥0.1606+0.00163×155.2=0.414×10−3 kN−1
The straight lines for Exp. 3t, 3b, 4t and 4b are shown in Figure 8.10. There is a huge shift in 
the position of lines 3t and 4t due to the reductions in Ms, but hardly any change in the posi￾tion of the important lines 3b and 4b. Compared with Example 8.3, the equations for 1/Ppi in 
Exp. 4t changes by only 1.4% due to the compensating effects of fctm=3.80 N/mm2 to zero, 
and Ms reducing by 20%. Of course, there is no change in the transfer lines 2t and 2b, so the 
resulting design is the same in this example as in Example 8.3. In fact, the ratio of the final Ms/
MsR=0.98. However, if the quasi-permanent factor ψ2=1.0 the beam fails with Ms/MsR=1.23.254 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
8.4 ALTERNATIVE MAGNEL DIAGRAM USING 
TOP AND BOTTOM FIBRE STRESSES
8.4.1 Background to the Magnel diagram
An alternative and very popular alternative to the traditional Magnel diagram is shown in 
Figure 8.11. Here the requirements for the initial prestress (before losses) σti at the top fibre 
and σbi at the bottom fibre are plotted as a set of rectangles for the transfer and mid-span 
service conditions. If the rectangles overlap, there is a common pretensioning requirement 
for both transfer and service, highlighted as the ‘overlapping zone’ in Figure 8.11. So-called 
‘N-lines’, actually Ppi lines with N=Ppi/η fpk Ap per tendon are then drawn through the over￾lapping zone for a selected number of tendons (say 20 to 30 no. for the beams studied in 
Example 8.3, or fewer in number of hollow core units, etc.) and the critical point is found in 
the bottom left-hand corner of the overlapping zone. So-called ‘e-lines’ for the eccentricity 
may also be drawn as shown in Figure 8.11 for chosen values of zcp. e-lines are not so impor￾tant as zcp may easily be calculated. The popularity of this method is because the user can 
see the required top and bottom fibre stresses, as the rectangular stress zones move across 
the diagram with increasing bending moments or reducing limiting stresses.
If there is no common overlapping zone between the transfer and service conditions, a 
third rectangle is constructed at say ¼ span, as shown in Figure 8.12. Now there are two 
overlapping zones for (i) near to support to ¼ span, and (ii) ¼ span to mid-span. Note that 
the N-lines are common to both zones and need only be constructed once.
The four inequalities are based on the same equations 5.6, 5.7a and 5.7b, and the trans￾fer and service conditions shown in Figures 8.11–8.14 are as follows. The limiting stress 
requirements are shown in Figure 8.15. Let σti and σbi now be the initial prestress required 
in order to find the initial prestressing force Ppi and eccentricity zcp

At lpt from the support, these straight lines at the top fibre are termed…(1t)
At ¼ span from the support ditto…(2t)
It is interesting to check the transfer conditions at mid-span, where the moment due to self￾weight is Msw,max. Intuitively, this is not critical as the flexural stresses due to the greater 
bending moment are counter-active to the prestress, but the differences can be quite small.

8.4.3 Service inequalities
For completeness, Figure 8.13 shows the limiting stresses for the service condition near to 
the support, but this is clearly not a critical condition as shown in Figure 8.15. The focus is 
therefore on mid-span as follows:
8.4.3.1 Service stress at the top fibre
Eq. 8.10 Rs Ppi (1/Ac−zcp/Zt
)+Ms,max/Zt,co ≤0.45 fcm
Fig. 8.14 Rs σti≤0.45 fcm −Ms,max/Zt,co
σti≤(0.45 fcm −Ms,max/Zt,co)/Rs … (3t) (8.38)
A further limit exists where Rs σti≥−fctm −Ms,max/Zt,co (8.39)
At ¼ span and mid-span, these are termed…(3t) and (4t), respectively.
8.4.3.2 Service stress at the bottom fibre
Eq. 8.14 Rs Ppi (1/Ac+zcp/Zb)−Ms,max/Zb,co ≥-fctm
Fig. 8.14 Rs σbi≥−fctm +Ms,max/Zb,co
σbi≥(-fctm +Ms,max/Zb,co)/Rs … (3b) (8.40)
A further limit exists where Rs σbi≤0.45 fcm +Ms,max/Zb,co (8.41)
At ¼ span and mid-span, this is termed…(3b) and (4b), respectively.
8.4.3.3 Critical design zone and stresses
The limiting stresses are plotted in the Magnel diagram as shown in Figure 8.15, where a 
critical overlapping zone, i.e. the design zone, is bounded by the transfer stresses near to the 
support and service stresses at mid-span, viz. lines 1t, 1b, 4t and 4b. If these lines do not 
overlap lines 2t and 2b, and 3t and 3b are added for the transfer and service conditions at ¼
span (or wherever the designer so chooses, such as 1/5 span for example.
The optimum design point, with the lowest number of tendons, is shown by the graphical 
solution of using P-lines in Section 8.5 to occur at the bottom left corner of the overlapping 
design zone, point A. Anywhere in the design zone is permitted. Point A gives the least val￾ues for σbi and σti, from which the lowest value of the initial prestress Ppi and the eccentricity 
zcp may be determined by solving the following two equations derived from Eq. 6.6 and 6.7a.
At bottom σbi=Ppi/Ac+Ppi zcp/Zb (8.42)
At top σti=Ppi/Ac−Ppi zcp/Zt (8.43)
From Eq. 8.42 zcp =σbi Zb/Ppi−Zb/Ac (8.44)258 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Substituting Eq. 8.44 into Eq. 8.43
σti=Ppi/Ac (1+1/α)−σbi/α (8.45)
ThenPpi=Ac (σti+σbi/α)/(1+1/α) (8.46)
where α=Zt/Zb
8.5 CONSTRUCTION OF ‘P-LINES’ AND ‘E-LINES’
8.5.1 Construction of ‘P-lines’
A graphical solution to the above is both visual and informative and gives a good impres￾sion of the relationships between Ppi and the limiting stresses. The overlapping design zone 
is extracted from Figure 8.15 into Figure 8.16. The critical design point lies within this zone 
and is found by constructing so-called ‘P-lines’, i.e. plots of surface stresses σti and σbi for 
values of Ppi based on an increasing integer number of tendons N. Referring to Exp. 6.2, 
Ppi=N η fpk Api where Api is the area of one tendon, for example for 10 no. 12.5mm diameter 
strands Ppi=10×0.7×1770×93×10−3 =1152.3 kN. (The term ‘N-line’ is sometimes used as 
Ppi is directly proportional to N.) The equation of the P-line is found by elimination zcp from 
the same Eqs. 8.42 and 8.43.
From Eq. 8.53 zcp =Zt/Ac−σti Zt/Ppi (8.47)
Setting Eq. 8.44=Eq. 8.47 gives the equation of the P-line
σti=Ppi (1+1/α)/Ac−(1/α) σbi (8.48)
where α=Zt/Zb

This is a sloping line of the form y=C−mx. For example, in the inverted tee beam in 
Example 8.3, α=24.685/30.215=0.817. If Ppi/Ac=3111.1×103/307.5×103 =10.12 N/mm2, 
the equation of the P-line for 27 no. strands is σti=22.51−1.224 σbi (N/mm2 units). This 
P-line intersects the x-axis at σbi=22.51/1.224=18.39 N/mm2.
When plotting P-lines the gradient of the line (−1/α) is constant, but the intersection with 
the y-axis increases with increasing number of tendons, e.g. the equation for 28 no. strands 
is simply σti=(28/27)×22.51−1.224 σbi=23.34−1.224 σbi and so on. The user therefore uses 
trial and error to find the lowest number of tendons that enable its P-line to pass through the 
overlapping zone, shown as A-B in Figure 8.16. The lowest number of tendons is therefore 
found at the bottom left corner of the overlapping design zone, in fact at the intersection of 
lines 4b (service, mid-span) and 1t (transfer, support) as is the case with all other variations 
of Magnel diagrams. A design point is usually selected mid-way along the P-line within the 
overlapping zone(s) giving the designer some leeway to arrange the tendons to suit.
8.5.2 Construction of ‘e-lines’
A graphical illustration of the relationship between the eccentricity zcp and the limiting 
stresses is the use of so-called ‘e-lines’, as shown in Figure 8.16. There is a linear relationship 
between σti and σbi as follows.
From Eq. 8.42 Ppi=σbi/(1/Ac+zcp/Zb) (8.44)
From Eq. 8.43 Ppi=σti/(1/Ac−zcp/Zt
) (8.49)
Setting Eq. 8.44=Eq. 8.49 gives the equation of the e-line
σti=σbi (1/Ac−zcp/Zt
)/(1/Ac+zcp/Zb) (8.50)
This is a sloping line of the form y=mx. For example in the inverted tee beam in Example 
8.3, Zt=24.685×106, Zb =30.215×106, Ac=307.5×103, trialling zcp =100mm, the equation 
of the e-line is σti=σbi (−0.799×10−6)/(6.561×10−6)=−0.122 σbi.

Example 8.1. Use Msw =4.86 kNm, Msw,max =13.50 kNm (for transfer), Ms,min =56.70 kNm 
and Ms,max =157.5 kNm (for service).

The mid-span limiting stresses are shown as dashed lines in Figure 8.17.
As expected, Figure 8.17 shows that the critical limiting transfer stresses are at the 
position near to the support, and the critical service stresses are at mid-span. Out of 12 
conditions checked, only four are critical, and these are transferred to the overlapping 
design zone in Figure 8.18.
As discussed above, the optimum design point is point A where σbi=+18.69 N/mm2 and 
σti=−3.55 N/mm2. The necessary initial pretensioning force Ppi is
Eq. 8.46 Ppi=Ac (σti+σbi/α)/(1+1/α)
where α = Zt/Zb =8.0/8.0 =1.0
Ppi=120×103 (−3.55+18.69/1.0)/(1+1/1.0)/103 =908.7 kN
This of course exactly the same as in Example 8.1. If the initial pretensioning force 
per 9.3mm diameter strand is 0.7×1770×52×10−3 =64.4 kN, the number of strands is 
N≥14.1. Rounding up to N=15 no. gives Ppi=966.4 kN. The corresponding eccentricity is
Eq. 8.44 zcp =(18.69×8.0×106/966.4×103)−(8.0×106/120×103)=88.1mm and is exactly 
the same as in Example 8.1.
Using the same array of tendons as in Example 8.1 gives zcp =90.0mm. The final initial 
prestress values are +18.69<σbi=+18.93<+19.98 N/mm2, and −3.55<σti=−2.82<+6.38 
N/mm2. This ‘design point’ is shown in Figure 8.18.

Solution
Only the critical limiting stresses identified in Example 8.5 will be calculated.

Now σbi≥+20.54 N/mm2 at mid-span is greater than σbi≤+19.97 N/mm2 at transfer, so 
there is no single solution. Quarter-span limiting stresses are therefore required – transfer

stresses at ¼ span must overlap with service stresses at mid-span, and service stresses at

This is greater than σbi≥+20.54 N/mm2 at mid-span, therefore OK.

Eq. 8.40 σbi≥(-fctm +Ms,qt/Zb,co)/Rs
σbi≥(−3.80+481.30/31.726)/0.80=+14.21 N/mm2
This is less than σbi≤+19.97 N/mm2 at lpt from the support, therefore OK.
The limiting stresses between (i) the support and ¼ span and (ii) ¼ span and mid￾span are shown in Figure 8.19, each with its own overlapping design zone. The optimum 
design point for (ii) is determined first at point A where σbi=+20.54 N/mm2 and σti=−5.09 
N/mm2. The necessary initial pretensioning force Ppi is
Eq. 8.46 Ppi=Ac (σti+σbi/α)/(1+1/α)
where α=Zt/Zb =24.685/30.215=0.817.
Ppi=307.5×103 (−5.09+20.54/0.817)/(1+1/0.817)/103 =2772.9 kN
This is of course exactly the same as in Example 8.3. If Ppi per strand is 115.23 kN, 
the number of strands is N≥24.1. As explained in Example 8.3 the eccentricity is too 
large so that N=27 no. strands are used giving Ppi=3111.1 kN. Using the same array 
of tendons as in Example 8.3 gives zcp =101.3mm. The final initial prestress values are 
+20.54<σbi=+20.74<+21.12 N/mm2, and −5.09<σti=−2.88<−1.14 N/mm2. This ‘design 
point’ is shown in Figure 8.19.
Between the support and ¼ span, the next lowest number of strands is at point B 
where σbi=+19.97 N/mm2 and σti=−3.68 N/mm2. The necessary initial pretension￾ing force Ppi=2871.0 kN requiring N=24.9 strands so that N=24 no. strands are 
used giving Ppi=2765.4 kN. Using the same array of tendons as in Example 8.3 gives 
zcp =99.0mm. The final initial prestress values are +14.21<σbi=+18.05<+19.97 N/mm2, 
and −3.68<σti=−2.09<+6.60 N/mm2. This ‘design point’ is shown in Figure 8.19.

Ultimate bending strength
9.1 ULTIMATE FLEXURAL STRENGTH OF 
PRESTRESSED CONCRETE ELEMENTS
9.1.1 Ultimate flexural tests on prestressed 
concrete hollow core floor units
The ultimate strength of precast prestressed concrete (psc) elements, such as slabs and beams 
in bending, is generally under predicted, by as much as 15% in the greater pretensioned units 
to 25% in the least pretensioned units. Compared with design values, MRd, where the major 
factor of safety γs=1.15 is for the tendons, there is considerable reserve flexural strength in 
the elements more than calculations predict. The factor of safety for concrete γc=1.5 has a 
greater influence in shallower slabs, rather than deeper beams, due to the smaller depth to 
the neutral axis and hence greater lever arm.
Figure 9.1 shows the latter stages of a long span bending test on a 1200mm width×320mm 
depth hollow core unit (hcu) where the upward camber has been nullified and the net mid￾span deflection (below a straight line drawn between the top of the supports, and not includ￾ing camber) is about 40mm, or span/275. The hcu could not be taken to total failure due to 
testing limitations, where the net deflection was expected to be about 60mm.
Figure 9.2 shows the ultimate failure at mid-span in a 1200 mm wide × 200 mm depth 
hcu subjected to a central transverse line load at mid-span. The prestress in the bottom 
of the hcu was ‘medium’, i.e. around 12 N/mm2, and there was considerable flexural 
cracking, developing into diagonal flexural-shear cracks, and deflection prior to local 
compressive failure in the top flange. The ultimate failure moment and design moment is 
not known.
Figure 9.3 shows the ultimate behaviour of the same tests shown (up to service loads) in 
Figure 7.1 and described in Section 7.1. To compare the experimental results with predicted 
ultimate values, given in Table 9.1, the following are assumed
i. The prestrain after losses is based on the assumptions relating to loss of prestress in 
Chapter 7, Section 7.1.1
ii. The depth to the neutral axis X is first based on the full width of the unit. If 0.8 X>hf
(depth of top flange) it is recalculated based on a T section where the width of the rib is 
equal to the total width of the webs, i.e. no account is taken of the real circular profile 
of the top of the hollow core, however the effect on the final moment of resistance is 
known to be small
iii. The ultimate strain in the wires is limited to 0.02 even though the strain in the tests 
may exceed this. It is thought that this was not critical as calculated strains were in the 
region 0.015<0.02, and the ratio between test/calculated moments averaged 1.09.Ultimate bending strength 265
Figure 9.1 Flexural testing of a hollow core floor unit.
The main conclusions from the test was that the experimental test moment Mu ranged from 
176 to 201 kNm, compared with a design value based on the nominal section and mate￾rial properties of the hcu of MRd =151.9 kNm, an average ratio of 1.24. This ratio should 
have been even greater because the average height to the centroid of the wires was 57.0mm 
Figure 9.2 Ultimate failure in a hollow core floor unit (not the same unit as in Figure 9.1).266 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
compared with the design value of 45.5mm. If the wires in the nominal unit are raised to 
57.0mm the above ratio increases to 1.31.
The calculated moments of resistance MRd,calc varied from 166 to 186 kNm, with the 
lowest values calculated for the hcu with the highest position of wires, i.e. Tests 5 and 
6 where ys = 61 and 62 mm, respectively. However this effect was reflected in Mu, which 
had the lowest values of 176.0 and 177.7 for Tests 5 and 6. Therefore the average ratio of

that, in spite of the variations in section properties and height of wires, the set of results 
show good consistency, with a confident prediction.
9.1.2 Ultimate flexural tests on T beams
Similar flexural tests have also been carried out by the authors on psc T beams used in beam 
and block flooring as described in Section 7.1.2. The beams have a narrow upstand, 42mm 
wide at the top increasing to 48mm width at the bottom of the upstand. The upstand is 
restrained laterally by the grouted infill blocks and can therefore generate its full compres￾sive capacity. However, the compressive strength of the upstand is limited due to its narrow 
width and under large curvature and ultimate strains may fail by crushing and/or lateral 
spalling over a length of about 150mm, as shown in Figure 9.4.
Figure 9.5 shows the ultimate and failure stages of a bending test carried out on the same 
beams shown in Figure 7.3a giving the ultimate failure shown in Figure 7.3b. Unlike the 
tests carried out on hcu where hydraulic loading was used, 18kg blocks kentledge was added 
to the beam, such that the mode of failure was uncontrolled and sudden, preceded only by 
flexural cracking (vertical cracks) in the mid-span region. The horizontal splitting cracks 
in the upstand did not occur until the beam failed. Spalling extended to the bottom of the 
upstand, 100mm from the top of the beam, even though the depth to the neutral axis was 
calculated as 63mm.
Figure 9.5 shows the beams exhibited excellent ductility, where the mid-span deflection 
at failure was more than 4.2 times the deflection at the onset of cracking. To compare the 
experimental results with predicted ultimate values, given in Table 9.2, the same assump￾tions are used as given in Section 9.1.1.
The main conclusions from the test was that the experimental test moment Mu in beams 
1 and 2 was 9.51 and 9.66 kNm, respectively, compared with a design value based on the 
nominal section and material properties of the beam of MRd =6.89 kNm, an average ratio of 
1.39. As the height to the centroid of the wires in the test beams was ±1mm of the nominal 
values, there is no effect of the position of the wires.
The calculated moments of resistance MRd,calc in beams 1 and 2 was 8.61 and 8.55 
kNm, respectively. The ratio for the two beams was Mu/MRd,calc = 1.10 and 1.13, showing 
good consistency. The average value of 1.117 is close to that for the hcu of 1.09. Overall 
Figure 9.4 Ultimate failure, by compressive crushing, splitting and spalling in the 42mm width upstand of a 
150mm depth prestressed T beam.268 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
the results show good consistency, with confident predictions of the ultimate moment 
of resistance.
Deflections of flexurally cracked beams, where the total moment Mk > Mcr, may be 
calculated based on the partially cracked section properties. Mk is the total bending 
moment at a particular loading station, for example in Figure 9.5 where Mk = 8.0 kNm 
the average measured deflection for the two beams is δ = 38.1 mm. Mcr is the calculated 
cracking moment defined in Section 7.1.1, i.e. using 1.5 fctm for the allowable tension 
prior to cracking. The average cracking moment of resistance for the two beams is 
Mcr = 5.84 kNm.

The modified value of Ecm from Section 7.1.2, to bring the calculated deflections in line with 
the experimental deflections, is Ecm =34500 N/mm2. The mean value of Ic,co for the two

9.2 ULTIMATE LIMIT STATE OF FLEXURAL STRENGTH
9.2.1 Background to ultimate moment of 
resistance and design moments
In calculating the ultimate moment of resistance of a psc section MRd, the same procedure 
as for statically reinforced concrete is used, with one important exception – the ultimate 
strength of the tendons varies depending on the level of prestress and the effective depth to 
the tendons. To calculate MRd three relationships are combined
i. compatibility of thru-depth strains
ii. equilibrium of forces in the concrete versus the tendons
iii. constitutive σ v ε relationship of the tendons
to determine the ultimate stress in the tendons fp and the lever arm z from the cen￾troid of the concrete in compression to the tendons in tension. Then, moment of resis￾tance=stress×area×lever arm
MRd = f Ap pz (9.7)
where Ap is the total area of tendons in the tensile zone of the section, i.e. discounting ten￾dons in the top of the section an any that lie about 0.4d from the top.
The material partial safety factors to be applied as per usual: γs=1.15 for steel tendons 
and γc=1.5 for concrete in flexure. When using bonded tendons (as opposed to unbounded 
in post-tensioned concrete design) MRd is limited by one the following

between these two expressions for beams than such as hcu due to the additional self 
weight of the beam, which may about 15%–20% to the dead loads. Point loads in beams 
are usually due to wall loads for example transferred from floor slabs – they are not con￾sidered as short line loads due to lateral distribution of wall loads over the width of three 
(or four for composite slabs) units. Line loads on beams derive from localised cross-walls 
acting on floor slabs.
In solid slabs or beams it is not usual for MRd to be critical at the expense of the service 
moment of resistance MsR where the area of tendons Ap is relatively small, say less than 0.2% 
of the cross-sectional area of concrete. This is because MsR is a function of the prestress σb
plus the tensile strength fctm, so even for small area of tendons MsR is already fctm Zb,co even 
where σb is relatively small, say 8 N/mm2. By contrast MRd =fp Ap z, so a low Ap leads to a 
low MRd, which becomes critical.
For hcu, thanks to 70years of evolution leading to the efficient design of the cross-section 
by manufacturers, the balance between MsR and MRd is much closer. Where the exposure 
category is more severe than XC1 and fctm =0, the balance between MsR and MRd is the 
opposite because imposed live loads are considerably reduced as they are multiplied by the 
quasi-permanent factor ψ2 typically 0.3, or the frequent factor ψ1 typically 0.5, as explained 
in Section 3.1.2.
9.2.2 Ratio of ultimate to service moments of resistance, 
and the critical limit state for hollow core units
Taking for example the hcu in Figure 6.7 used in Example 7.1 for exposure XC1, Table 9.4 
shows how MsR and MRd increase with increasing area Ap. In this exercise the effective span 
is adjusted for strand patterns that are different to that used in Example 7.1, i.e. 9.80m. For 
the hcu the least number possible is 7 no.×9.3mm diameter strands (having 6 no. cores) and 
this leads to a ratio MRd/MsR =1.14. This is lower than the mean load factor for ultimate/
service loads, which is wEd/ws=20.15/14.92=1.35 in Example 7.1. Therefore the ultimate 
limit state of strength is reached before the serviceability limit state of stress, in this case 
fctm at the bottom fibre. Note that wEd/ws is never less than 1.30 in this example. For the 
maximum strand pattern of 7 no.×9.3mm plus 7 no. 12.5mm diameter strands the ratio 
MRd/MsR =1.36>1.35 so the unit is critical at the serviceability limit state. Cross-over occurs 
where ρ=Ap/Ac=0.39% area of strands where MRd/MsR =wEd/ws.

Exposure category=XC1. fctm =3.80 N/mm2.272 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
It is expected that the rate of increase in MRd should mirror the rate of increase in Ap over 
the range, and this is true for ρ<0.45%. Above this value the depth to the neutral axis (as 
explained in Section 9.3.1) is below the top flange and lies between the webs, making the 
moment of resistance less efficient – a 3% to 4% drop off in MRd is found.
For a notionally identical 400mm depth hcu this exercise was carried out using the same 
strand patterns as before (except 2 no. 7mm wires in the top of the hcu are added). As before 
MRd is critical up to 0.43% area of strands, with the ratio MRd/MsR =1.03 to 1.36, virtually 
the same result as in Table 9.4 for 250mm depth hcu.
Continuing with the 250 mm depth hcu, Table 9.5 shows how MsR and MRd increase for 
exposure XC3, where the situation is reversed due to the lower values of MsR (because 
fctm = 0) and the much larger load ratio wEd/ws = 1.88 (because the imposed live load is 
multiplied by ψ2 = 0.3). For the lowest area of strands MRd/MsR = 1.92 > 1.88, and service 
governs. For the highest area of strands MRd/MsR = 1.73 < 1.88, and the ultimate limit state 
governs. For external exposure it is important that serviceability governs the long-term 
design condition.
The results are summarised by plotting graphs of the normalised ratio η=MRd/MsR versus 
wEd/ws in Figure 9.6. The service moment is critical where η≥1. It is shown that this occurs 
around ρ≥0.4% for hcu’s for exposure XC1, where there is little difference for depths of 250 
and 400mm. By coincidence this also occurs at ρ≤0.4% for hcu’s for exposure XC3, except 
that the trend is reversed with the ultimate moment being critical for ρ≥0.4%.
Service and ultimate moments of resistance, together with ultimate shear capacity, are 
also summarised for a wide range of hcu in Table 9.1, from 150 to 500mm depth.
9.2.3 Ratio of ultimate to service moments of resistance, and 
the critical limit state for solid floor units and beams
Taking for example a 1200mm width×250mm depth solid slab, having the same cross 
section as the hcu in Figure 6.7 without the cores, for exposure XC1, Table 9.6 shows 
how MsR and MRd increase with increasing area Ap. For the lowest number of strands 8 
no. 9.3mm diameter strands the ratio MRd/MsR =1.19. This is lower than the mean load 
factor for ultimate/service loads, which is wEd/ws=1.33 such that ultimate limit state is 
reached before the service stress fctm. For the maximum strand pattern of 12 no.×9.3mm 
plus 4 no. 12.5mm diameter strands (with 4 no. 7mm diameter wires in the top) the ratio

MRd/MsR =1.48>1.33 so the unit is critical at the serviceability limit state of stress. Cross￾over occurs at ρ=0.20% – note that is half the value for hcu, as the service moment of 
resistance is much less efficient than for hcu. A key factor here is that the ratio of MRd to 
Ap is almost the same for the 250mm depth solid unit as for the 250mm depth hcu – the 
ratio varies from 0.30 to 0.23 kNm per mm2 strands, with the averages for the solid and 
hcu being 0.28 and 0.29 kNm per mm2, respectively.
Figure 9.6 also shows plots of η vs ρ for solid units, where the service moment for expo￾sure XC1 is critical for ρ≥0.20%, and is always critical for exposure XC3. This is because

the effect of using fctm =0 in a solid unit has a much greater influence on MsR than in a hcu 
because the prestress in the bottom fibre is smaller due to its larger cross-sectional area, in 
fact 1.72 times that of a hcu.
9.3 DESIGN PROCEDURES FOR ULTIMATE LIMIT 
STATE OF FLEXURAL STRENGTH
9.3.1 Ultimate force equilibrium and strain compatibility
As shown in Section 9.1 the ultimate failure of psc beams and slabs is considerably 
ductile, but in spite of sections being under reinforced flexurally due to the small areas 
of reinforcement (compared to comparable r.c. sections) the final mode of failure is sud￾den and often governed by compressive failure of the concrete as shown in Figures 9.2 
and 9.5. It should be noted that the cross-line load in Figure 9.2 is not representative of 
uniformly distributed loading, and will have contributed to the localised compressive 
failure.
The depth of the (strain responsive) neutral axis X is obtained by considering the equilib￾rium of the section. If we think back to a statically reinforced section, where the σs v εs curve 
for rebar is a flat plateau, then referring to Figure 9.7 the ultimate forces in the concrete Fc
and steel bars Fs are
F f c = 0.567 ckb X 0.8 (9.8)
F A s = σs s (9.9)
Then
X = σ ( ) A f s / 0.453 ckb s (9.10)
Considering the linear strain distribution in Figure 9.7

Figure 9.7 Force equilibrium and compatibility of strains in reinforced concrete flexural design.Ultimate bending strength 275
For known values of fck, b, d, As and εcu3, σs is inversely proportional to εs, and the design 
point is where this curve intersects the plateau of the constitutive σs v εs plot for the rebars. Of 
course we know that σs=0.87 fyk, and therefore it is not necessary to carry out this operation, 
but it serves as an introduction for the procedures required for pretensioned tendons where the 
constitutive σp v εp plot is not a plateau, but a strain hardening slope as shown in Figure 9.8.
The ultimate tensile strength of the tendons depends on the final prestress σpo in the ten￾dons after all losses and initial prestress levels have been considered. See Eq. 7.35. In 
most hcu production (and sections where the tendons are all near to the bottom) the ratio 
σpo/fpk =0.53 to 0.6, depending on the area of tendons. For double tee units where most of 
the tendons are positioned further from the bottom σpo/fpk =0.45 to 0.5. The stress history for 
pretensioned tendons is shown in Figure 9.9 where the effect of prestrain after losses εpo (A),

at each stage.
Referring to Figure 9.10, values for X and fp may be obtained from three considerations
i. force equilibrium Fp =Fc where
F f p p = ApT (9.13)
F f c = cd 0.8b X (9.14)
Then
f Ap pT = f bcd 0.8X (9.15)
where fcd =0.85 fck/γc and b=width of compression zone, which for a hcu is the actual 
width of the unit plus the insitu infill in the longitudinal joints=1200mm. Note that 
although the strength of the infill may be less than the precast, say fcki=25 N/mm2 com￾pared with fck =45 N/mm2, the infill is confined, and as the infill is typically only 50mm 
wide (compared with 1150mm for the unit) the effective width is taken as 1200mm.
BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.7. For 50<fck ≤90 N/mm2, the stress block depth factor 
reduces from 0.8 to λ=0.8−(fck −50)/400, and the design strength factor from 1 to 
η=1.0−(fck −50)/200.
ii. strain compatibility of the ultimate strain in the concrete εcu3 and the strain εp in the 
tendons. Referring to Figure 9.11, after the final losses in service, the ultimate compat￾ibility strain εp’ is given as
εp c ε = u3 ( ) d X− /   X
or
εp c ε = u3 ( ) d X/ 1 − (9.16)

Solving the quadratic gives X/d, dn =0.4 X, fp/fpk from which MRd is determined.
If the final strain εp =εpo +εcu3 (d/X−1)>εLOP Eq. 9.32 is not valid and Ep is replaced by the 
functions in Eq. 9.21. The results for fp/fpk and X/d are given in Table 9.7 in terms of three 
values of final prestress fpo/fpk =0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. To check whether εp ≤εLOP ratios of εp/εLOP
are given in Table 9.8, with elastic values in italics being in the minority. Finally MRd/fck bd2
is given for all cases.
For example, for the hcu used in Example 6.1 and shown in cross-section in Figure 6.7, 
fpk ApT/fck bd=1770×911/45×1200×209.2=0.143 and fpo/fpk =1020.7/1770=0.576.
By linear interpolation fp/fpk = 0.831, then fp = 1470 N/mm2; X/d = 0.259, then 
X = 0.259 × 209.2 = 54 mm, and 0.8X = 43 mm which is just below the bottom of the 
top flange of hft = 40 mm, therefore the section may be taken as ‘rectangular’. Lever 
arm z = 209.2 − 0.4 × 54 = 187.6 mm. Then MRd = 1470 × 911 × 187.6 × 10−6 = 251 2 kNm. 
Alternatively MRd/fck bd2 =0.1056, then MRd =0.1056×45×1200×209.22 ×10−6 =250.5 kNm. 
Rigorous analysis in Example 9.1 shows that MRd = 247.3 kNm, a difference of 1.2% 
which appears to be due to the compressive block in the rigorous analysis being T-shape 
(as 0.8X > hft) rather than ‘rectangular’.

MEd per unit=1.20×16.79×9.802/8=241.8 kNm<247.3 kNm
Figure 9.14 shows the bending moment distributions for ultimate moments MEd and 
moments of resistance MRd. Close to the supports where the bond strength between the 
tendons and concrete is developing over an ultimate anchorage length lbpd (see Section 
9.5) the value of MRd is increasing bi-linearly from zero at the support (as shown in BS 
EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 8.17). In fact the bi-linear profile is about 95%–98% of being a linear 
distribution as the gradient of the development profile reduces by only 9% at x=lpt2.
Referring to clause 8.10.2.3 (4) the anchorage length lbpd to full MRd = 726 +
0.19 × 11.2 × (1449 − 944.3)/2.13 = 1230 mm, where lpt2 = 726 mm (see Example 10.1),

length begins at the cut end of the hcu, e.g. at 50 mm behind the centre of support for 
a 100 mm bearing length.
To check whether the unit is critical at ultimate, the ratio MRd/MsR =247.3/179.1=1.38. 
This ratio is greater than the ratio of the MEd to Ms using γG =1.25 and γQ =1.5 where, in this 
example MEd/Ms=241.8/179.1=1.35. Thus the hcu is not critical at the ultimate limit state.
9.3.3 Iterative trial and error method
MRd may be calculated using an iterative trial and error method by first trialing a value for 
fp, called fp1 and substituting into Eqs. 9.15 and 9.17 to obtain values for X and εp and finally 
into Eq. 9.20 to obtain a new value for fp, known as fp2. If fp2 is within±5 N/mm2 of fp1 con￾vergence is assumed. Then MRd =fp2 AsT z, where z=d -0.4X. Otherwise iteration is required 
repeating the above and starting with fp2, and so on. A good starting point is fp1 =1400 
N/mm2, roughly in the middle of the inclined branch of Figure 9.13. Eq. 9.20 for the inclined 
branch in Figure 9.13 is fp =1385+[154×(εp −0.007104)/0.015118] N/mm2. It is also reached 
using the stiffness of the inclined branch as fp =1313+10186 εp.
Example 9.2
Calculate MRd using an iterative trial and error method for the hcu in Example 9.1, start￾ing with fp1 =1400 N/mm2.
Solution
Eq. 9.15 X1 =1400×911/25.5×0.8×1200=52.1mm
Eq. 9.17 εp1 =0.005234+0.0035×(209.2/52.1−1)=0.015789
Eq. 9.20 fp2 =1385+154×[(0.015789−0.007104)/0.015118]=1473.8 N/mm2
or fp2 =1313+10186×0.015789=1473.8 N/mm2
Repeat with fp2 =1473.8 N/mm2. Then X2 =54.8mm, εp2 =0.015085 and fp3 =1466.6 N/mm2
 Repeat with fp3 =1466.6 N/mm2. Then X3 =54.6mm, εp3 =0.015150 and fp4 =1467.3 N/mm2. 
Converges. Then z=209.2−0.4×54.6=187.4mm
Eq. 9.28 MRd =1467.3×911×187.4×10−6 =250.5 kNm
9.3.4 Ultimate flexural design at holes and notches
The formation and design for holes and notches in slabs is given in Section 7.4. The positions 
of holes and notches and limiting sizes for ultimate design are the same as those shown in 
Figures 6.16–6.20.
MRd for voids is calculated using the procedure in Section 9.3.1 using the residual width 
of the top flange after the void has been removed, and the remaining area of tendons after 
those at the void have been cut. The effective depth d of the tendons is recalculated based 
on the remaining area of tendons and their individual effective depths, unless of course the 
tendons are all at the same level in which case d does not change. See Example 9.3. MRd is 
calculated and is constant for the length of the void. Either end of the void MRd increases bi￾linearly to MRd for the full capacity of the unit over a distance equal to the ultimate anchor￾age length lbpd. Voids formed entirely through hollow cores are ignored.
Lateral distribution of ultimate strains, and hence MRd, at holes in floor slabs is carried 
out in the same manner as in service (Section 7.4) after the units have been grouted together Ultimate bending strength 283
after installation, known as a ‘slab panel’, provided that there are no holes in the adjacent 
units. The net area of tendons ApT,net may be averaged over the width of 3 no. units, or 2 no.

Using the information given in Example 9.1 for ApT for the two adjacent units without

If εp >0.007104, then fp =1385+[154×(εp −0.007104)/(0.0222−0.007104)] Eq. 3
Combining Eqs. 1–3 gives: 287.9 X2–16358 X -91750=0
Then X=61.9mm, but as 0.8 X=49.6>hft=40mm the compression block enters 
the zone of the webs and the stress block is a ‘T-shape’, where the total width of the 
cores bc=840−140−45=655mm and the width of the webs=935−655=280mm (or 
360−2×40=280mm).
The equations 1–3 now give: 86.2 X2 −6273 X−91750=0
Then X=85.2mm, dn =25.9mm and z=209.2−25.9=183.2mm
From Eq. 1. εp =0.010342
From Eq. 3. fp =1418 N/mm2 <limit 1516 N/mm2
Eq. 9.28 For unit with hole MRd =1418×814×183.2×10−6 =211.6 kNm
Without load spreading, for the unit with the hole MRd =175.0 kNm.
The ultimate design moment at x=6.0m from the support is MEd =wEd L x/2−wEd x2/2 
where wEd =1.2×16.78=20.14 kN/m.
Then MEd =20.14×9.8×6.0/2−20.14×6.02/2=229.6 kNm>211.6 kNm, the slab panel 
fails by 18.0 kNm. In fact, by plotting MEd and MRd,net at 50 intervals along the span the 
greatest difference, at x=5.68m from the left support, is 23.5 kNm.
Figure 9.15 shows the bending moment distributions for ultimate moments MEd and 
moments of resistance MRd at the hole and end notch.284 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The hcu in Figure 9.15 also contains an end notch from O to B of width wv=285mm 
and 600mm length, where ApT =673mm2. MRd at end notches are not laterally distributed 
between adjacent units. The resulting MRd at the end of the notch is MRd =96.8 kNm at 
x=0.6m, increasing to MsR =247.3 kNm at x+lbpd =1.753m.
9.3.5 Ultimate capacity for concentrated loads
Concentrated point and line loads, anywhere on the floor slab, are according to BS EN 1168, 
clause 4.3.3.2.5 (BS EN 1168, 2005). The first decision is whether the hcus are grouted to 
form a complete floor. If this is not the case (isolated units) the limiting tension is fctk,0.05
(= 0.7 fctm) and the capacities are at the serviceability limit state qk and Fk. If the units are 
grouted to permit transverse load distribution the limiting tension ft=fctd (= 0.7 fctm/1.5) and 
the capacities are at the ultimate limit state qd and Fd.
BS EN 1168 does not explain how to deal with multiple loads in close proximity, nor 
diagonally crossing loads, but these should be resolved into loads parallel with the longitu￾dinal span as far as the load is covering a width of one core plus one web. For multiple loads 
in close proximity, the shear force diagram may be drawn such that the design shear force 
should not exceed the capacities in Eqs. 9.34–9.42.
Guidance is given in BS EN 1168:2005 for the capacity of concentrated loads in psc hcu 
and completed slabs, such as
i. linear line loads q acting parallel with the span of the floor units not on an edge of a 
floor area
ii. linear line load q ditto on an edge of a floor area
iii. point loads F anywhere in the floor area.

Figure 9.15 Ultimate bending moment distribution for hcu with hole and notch in Example 9.3.Ultimate bending strength 285
The design is based on the resistance of the floor units to transverse bending, and as the 
units have no transverse reinforcement the tensile stresses caused by the bending moment 
are limited by the service tensile strength fctk,0.05 =0.7 fctm or the ultimate strength fctd depend￾ing on the whether the loads are distributed laterally across several units, or not, respec￾tively. Lateral load distribution of concentrated loads is not included in this book as it does 
not affect the behaviour of psc elements, but is covered by Elliott (Elliott, 2017) based on 
the guidance in BS EN 1168, Annex C.
BS EN 1168 clause 4.4.3.2.5 states ‘If the elements are designed assuming no load distri￾bution, which means that all loads acting on an element should be resisted by that element, 
the limiting value of the tensile stress is fctk,0.05 in the serviceability limit state. In this case 
for elements without topping, in the serviceability limit state, the capacities for concentrated 
loads qk and Fk are calculated in the absence of particular justifications as follows’, i.e. in 
Sections 9.3.4.1–9.3.4.3. This means if lateral load spreading cannot be carried out, for 
example at a trimmer angle around a large void, there is no moment redistribution between 
adjacent units and the service stress and loads govern. The clause does not state whether 
the ‘topping’ is a structural topping or not, but it is implied that it is as the topping would 
permit moment redistribution.
Further
If the elements are designed by assuming load distribution according to the elastic the￾ory, which means that a part of the loads acting on one element are distributed to adja￾cent elements, the limiting value of the tensile stress is fctd in the ultimate limit state. The 
capacities for concentrated loads in this case, in the ultimate limit state, may be derived 
for the same equation, but in which qk, Fk and fctk,0.05 shall be replaced by (ultimate 
values) qd, Fd and fctd.
In this book the notation is qEd and FEd. Punching shear capacity for point loads and hcu 
with three supported edges are given in Chapter 10.
It is therefore obvious, that because fctd =fctk,0.05/1.5, that unless there is a special situation, 
such as a concentrated load next to a trimmer angle, the service load is not critical. This is 
shown in Example 9.4. There is a paradox here – greater concentrated load capacities are 
therefore achieved when the loads are not laterally distributed between adjacent units?
The ultimate design concentrated load is the greater of Exp. 6.10a or 6.10b in BS EN 1990 
(BS EN 1990, 2002), see Section 3.1.3. If two separate loads are present, and they overlap by 
a distance less than the depth of unit, the reactions are combined, or are otherwise consid￾ered individually. Line loads of length l are spread across the width b of the units at 45° as 
shown in Figure 9.16. If the start of the load x<b the spreading length is reduced as shown 
in Figure 9.16.
9.3.5.1 Linear line loads not on an edge of the floor area
When the load is not at an edge the bending resistance is a function of the section modulus 
at the bottom of the unit. For the design of single units without lateral load distribution, the 
service line load capacity is
qk l = + 20W f b ctk,0.05 / 2 ( ) l b ( ) N/mm units (9.34)
For the design of units with lateral load distribution, the ultimate line load resistance is
qd l = + 20W f b ctd / 2 ( ) l b ( ) N/mm units (9.35)286 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
where
W I lb = zz / m yb ( ) m /mm run 3 (9.36)
is section modulus at bottom in transverse direction per unit length.

(9.37)
l=length of the line load
b=width of unit
The section modulus W is calculated from the second moment of area taking a longi￾tudinal cut through the unit, and considering the top and bottom flanges as rectangles 
1mm wide. For example, if h=250mm and the top and bottom flanges have thick￾ness hft=40mm, hfb =35mm (See Figure 6.7), then Il=856430mm4/mm length of unit, 
Wlb =856430/123.0=6963mm3/mm and Wlt=856430/127.0=6744mm3/mm, then the 
minimum Wl=6744mm3/mm. If fctk,0.05 =0.7×3.80=2.66 N/mm2, length of line load 
l=1000mm and b=1200mm, then for an innermost line load the service capacity is
 Eq. 9.34 qk =20×6393×2.66/3400≤108.8 N/mm, or 108.8 kN/m service load for an 
isolated unit.
If the start of the line load is less than b from the end of the unit, the load spread term (l+2b) 
is reduced, e.g. if the same line load starts at 600mm from the end of the span, (l+2b)=600
+1000+1200=2800mm, and qk =132 kN/m. This is greater than above because some of 
the line load is distributed directly into the closest support. If the floor slab is grouted, part 
of the load will be distributed across the longitudinal joints and the ultimate capacity is now
Eq. 9.35 qd =20×6963×1.77/3400=72.5 kN/m
If this is a dead load the service capacity qk =72.5/1.35=53.7 kN/m. Line load capacities at 
the edge of a floor area, given later in Eqs. 9.38 and 9.39, are half of the above.
9.3.5.2 Linear line loads on an edge of the floor area
When the load is at an edge the bending resistance is a function of the section modulus at 
the top of the unit. The load capacity is as Section 9.3.4.1 with the following expressions

9.3.5.3 Service and ultimate capacities of point load 
anywhere in a hollow core floor area
Global capacity to point loads anywhere on a floor area are given in Eqs. 9.41 and 9.42. 
The size of the footprint is not given, but at least 300mm is prudent. This is not the same 
as a punching shear capacity, but is derived in the manner in which full-scale test behaviour 
shows longitudinal splitting running through the entire span. For the design of single hcu 
without lateral load distribution, the total service point load Fk is applied to one unit. The 
service capacity is
F W k l = 3 N fctk,0.05 ( ) units (9.41)
The ultimate resistance is
F W Rd = 3 N l cf td ( ) units (9.42)
where Wl=minimum of Wlb or Wlt (mm3/mm run)
Example 9.4
Calculate the ultimate capacity for a linear line load qEd and point load FEd for the hcu 
shown in Figure 6.7 where all loads are distributed over adjacent units and (i) is not at the 
edge of a floor area, (ii) as (i) but is present at the edge of a floor area, and (iii) FEd. The 
line load is from x=2.0 to 4.0m from the centre of the support.
For completeness calculate the service load capacities without lateral load distribution.

9.4 ULTIMATE FLEXURAL DESIGN OF PRESTRESSED BEAMS
9.4.1 Inverted-tee beams
The ultimate limit state for the flexural design of psc beams follows the procedures adopted 
for psc floor units given in Section 9.3, but with one major addition. Because the position of 
many of the tendons in beams is nearer to the neutral axis than is the case in floor units, the 
strains in each of the tendons should be calculated to determine whether they attain their 
maximum value shown in the fp vs εp diagram in Figure 9.8 and Figure 9.13 for the case of 
fpk =1770 N/mm2. These diagrams are based on the constitutive relationship given in BS EN 
1992-1-1, Fig. 3.10 where at the LOP (limit of proportionality) εLOP =0.782 fpk/Ep and so for 
fp ≤0.782 fpk
f E p p = εp (9.43)
For 0.782 fpk <fp ≤fp,max where at the limiting strain εud =0.02
f f p m, ax = + 0.782 pk { } ( ) 0.02 − εLOP L ( ) 0.0222 − ε OP 0.087fpk (9.44)
= +′ ′ f f p p E ep p (9.45)
where the intercept ′ fp =0.782 fpk − ′ Ep 0.782 fpk/Ep
= − ( ) ′ ′ f f p 0.782 pk 1 / E E p p (9.46)
where the inclined branch Young’s modulus
= − ( ) ′ E f p 0.087 pk 0.0222 0.782f E pk / p (9.47)
For the case of fpk = 1770 N/mm2, ′ Ep = 154/(0.022222 − 0.007104) = 10186 N/mm2, 
fLOP = 0.782 × 1770 = 1385 N/mm2, ′ fp = 1385 (1 − 10186/195000) = 1313 N/mm2 and 
therefore
Eq. 9.45 fp =1313+10186 εp ≤fp,max
Eq. 9.44 fp,max =1385+{(0.02−0.007104)/(0.0222−0.007104)} 154=1516 N/mm2.
In some cases (in shallow beams) it is possible that no tendon will attain its yield value 
and therefore the assumption that fp = fp,max is not valid at all. In other cases (deeper 
beams and composite beams with a wide top flange) some of the tendons will attain 
fp,max. Because of having to satisfy the fairly stringent serviceability stress limits, most 
psc rectangular and inverted-tee beams are over reinforced at ultimate – this is why com￾posite psc beams are efficient in enabling most of the tendons to attain yield value, see 
Section 12.5.4. The basic analytical procedure is given below where it is assumed that 
the stress distribution (after losses) and a strand pattern to satisfy the service condition 
are known.
Firstly, the tendons in the top of the beam and at the top of the boot of inverted-tee beams 
are ignored. This leaves the number of tendons as NT of total area ApT. A good starting 
point for the first estimate of the neutral axis depth X and the ultimate stress fp is to take all Ultimate bending strength 289
remaining tendons stressed to about 0.7 fpk. Then, from the equilibrium of concrete Fc and 
steel Fp forces, knowing X the strain in the tendons in the bottom row is found, at the next 
row up and so on until the next row down from the top of the boot is reached. If the upstand 
is particularly tall, say equal to half the total depth of the beam, the tendons in the top of 
the boot may contribute a little to the total force Fp. Referring to Figure 9.11, if the distance 
from the top of the beam to the tendons is d, the ultimate strain in the tendon at d is given by
εp p = ε o c + ε u3 ( ) d X/ 1 − (9.48)
where the pre-strain εpo =fpo/Ep is the final stress in the tendon after losses. The small strain 
due to the decompression of concrete fg may be added to εpo, but the effect is small. Referring 
to Figures 9.8 and 9.11 the stress in the tendon from Eq. 9.47 is fp = ′ fp + ′ Ep εp
Knowing the values of fp in each row of tendons the force equilibrium gives
F f c = 0.567 ckb X 0.8 in the concrete (9.49)
F f p p = Σ ApT for each row of tendons below the top of the boot (9.50)
Hence X is found and re-substituted into Eq. 9.48 for iteration. The analysis is clearly long 
and tedious and involves having to calculate εp and fp at each level, although a simple spread￾sheet soon delivers the solution after about three (intelligent) iterations. An approximate 
method is to consider that the average strain exists at the centroid of the tendons in the ten￾sion zone, i.e. d=dT where dT is the effective depth to these tendons. Eqs. 9.48–9.50 are still 
valid. The ultimate moment of resistance MRd is given as
MRd = Σf Ap pT T ( ) d X − 0.4 (9.51a)
Note that in inverted-tee beams the compression zone comprises the upstand, of width bw
and depth hs, plus the part of the boot of width b. Eq. 9.39 is modified to
F f c = + 0.567 ckb hw s 0.567f bck ( ) 0.8X h − s (9.52a)
Alternatively
F f c = − 0.567 ck ( ) b X 0.8 ( ) b b − w s h (9.52b)
MRd = Σf Ap pT T ( ) d d − n (9.51b)
where dn is the centroid of the inverted-T shape compressive zone.
Tables 9.9 and 9.10 give the minimum value of MRd for a range of typical sizes for psc 
inverted-tee beams.
Example 9.5
Calculate MRd for the beam shown in Figure 9.17 with the chosen strand pattern from 
Example 7.10. Draw the ultimate bending moment distributions along the span, including 
the effects of bond anchorage at the supports. The self weight of the beam=7.688 kN/m, 
the floor slab=18.0 kN/m, other dead loads=10.0 kN/m and imposed live load=30.0 kN/m. 
Use of beam is for offices, where ψ0 =0.7.

in Example 7.10. The four strands in the top of the beam (open symbols) are excluded in the design.292 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Figure 9.18 shows the bending moment distributions for ultimate moments MEd
and moments of resistance MRd. Close to the supports where the bond strength 
between the tendons and concrete is developing over an ultimate anchorage length 
lbpd = 1.180 m (see Section 9.5) the value of MRd is increasing bi-linearly from zero at 
the support.
The ultimate design load wEd =max{1.35×(7.688+18.0+10.0)+1.05×30.0; 1.25*×
(7.688+18.0+10.0)+1.5×30.0}=89.56 kN/m. MEd =89.56×8.52/8=808.9 kNm. (*Note 
this factor is actually 0.925×1.35=1.24875, hence the slight difference in the answer 
89.56 kN/m.)
To check whether the unit is critical at ultimate, the ratio MRd/MsR =891.5/599.7=1.49. 
This ratio is greater than the ratio of the MEd to Ms using γG =1.25 and γQ =1.5 where, in 
this example MEd/Ms=808.9/593.2=1.36. Thus the beam is not critical at the ultimate 
limit state.

9.4.2 T beams in beam and block flooring
The same procedure is used as for inverted-tee beams, for example in Example 9.5. The 
number of wires used in 150mm depth beams is generally 4 to 9 no. for the narrow (bot￾tom width 92mm) and wide beams (bottom width 165mm), respectively. Of these 3 to 7 
no. wires will be used in the MRd calculations. The neglected wires are usually present to 
control cracking and camber at transfer. The number of wires used in 225mm depth beams 
is generally 7 or 8 no., of which 6 no. will be used in the MRd calculations.
The upstand of beams is usually tapered, becoming narrower at the top of the beam, 
at a slope of 6/100=0.06, such that the compressive stress block is trapezoidal. When the 
depth to the neutral axis is known the actual width of the stress block may be determined, 
as shown in the following example. In such shallow beams the strain in the second row of 
wires may fluctuate about the limit of proportionality, i.e. εp is close to εLOP, and it is impos￾sible to escape the iterative loop as the calculation progresses. Of course contains a partial 
safety factor γs=1.15, so this may not be happening in reality. It does mean that the wire in 
row 2 is notionally still elastic at the ultimate limit state, which should not be allowed, but 
as the test results in Section 9.1.2 show, it is likely this wire will also be close to yielding 
when ultimate failure occurs.
Table 9.12 gives values of MRd for a range of typical sizes for psc T beams. The bending 
stress ratio K=MRd/fck b d2 varies from 0.15 to 0.22, the greater values being for the shal￾lower beams, but showing a well balanced design with X/d=0.39 to 0.63, respectively.
Example 9.6
Calculate MRd for the 150mm depth T beams shown in cross-section in Figure 7.12 (and 
Figure 5.29), where from Example 7.5 σpo =1031.5 N/mm2. The width of the trapezoidal 
upstand is 42mm with a slope of 6/100=0.06. Note that for wire Ep =205 kN/mm2.
Solution
Note that for concrete fck =55 N/mm2, BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.7 states
i. stress block factor is λ=0.8−(fck -50)/400=0.8−(55−50)/400=0.7875
ii. design strength factor is η=1.0−(fck −50)/200=1.0−(55−50)/200=0.975

First estimate of X is found by considering NT =4 no. wires, ApT =4×19.63=78.5mm2
stressed to 75%×1770=1327.5 N/mm2. Fp =78.4×1327.5×10−3 =104.2 kN. Assume first

0.7875=103.7 mm>d3 =75mm to the wire in row 3. Therefore repeat the above using 
NT =3 no. wires, ApT =58.9mm2, Fp =78.2 kN, and X=77.8mm. The depth of the com￾pression block is 0.7875 X=61.3mm. As the upstand is trapezoidal the average width of 
the stress block is 42+(0.06×61.3/2)=43.8mm, rounded to b=44mm.
Carrying out iterations to determine fp in each row of wires, the fp v εp relationships 
for fpk =1770 N/mm2 are

Fp2 =1297×19.63=25458N
Total Fp =79961N and a new X=76.0mm

If partial safety factors γc=1.5 and γs=1.15 are removed from the iterative calculations 
in Example 9.6, the depth to the neutral axis reduces to X=60.0mm (as γc=1.5 has been 
removed). Then εp1 =0.008542 (20% greater than in design), εp2 =0.007651 (19% greater),

10.1 ULTIMATE SHEAR CAPACITY OF PRESTRESSED ELEMENTS
10.1.1 Ultimate shear tests on prestressed 
hollow core and solid units
In this book, the resistance to shear is known as shear ‘capacity’ to distinguish it from 
moments of ‘resistance’.
The ultimate shear capacity of prestressed concrete (psc) elements, particularly those 
without shear reinforcement such as hollow core units (hcu) and solid units, is less predict￾able than for moments of resistance (Sections 7.1.1. and 9.1.1). In many cases, the experi￾mental shear capacity Vu for a set of three nominally identical units can vary by as much 
as ±25%, particularly for hcu where the widths of individual webs may vary and lead to 
differing failure loads and cracking patterns. A much more reliable method is to cut the 
hcu into strips and test individual webs. The other issue is the interaction between bending 
and shear, where the distance from the centre of support to the applied load in a shear test, 
typically 2.5h, where h is the depth of the unit, has a major influence on behaviour. It is not 
surprising that a huge effort has been given to testing and analyzing the shear behaviour of 
psc elements compared with flexural behaviour, which is known to be predictable.
A further reason for the variations in Vu is that without shear reinforcement the mode 
of failure is brittle and sudden, and in the vast majority of elements, the load at the first 
major onset of cracking is also the failure load. Examples of shear failures in hcu are shown 
in Figures 10.1–10.3. Shear-tension failures initiate a short distance from the edge of the 
bearing and propagate through the webs, where the total width of the webs is typically 
0.25–0.35 times the width of the unit, at an angle of 35°–40° to the horizontal, usually 
travelling towards the position of the applied load.
If shear tests are conducted using hydraulic loading jacks, the failure is more controlled 
than under kentledge due to the sudden reduction in hydraulic pressure as deformation takes 
place. Therefore, as shown in the experimental data in Figures 10.4 and 10.5 it is possible 
to control the unloading stages. This does not happen in reality. As such shear failures lack 
ductility, and for this reason, the design capacity VRd,c contains several partial safety factors. 
Compared with design values, VRd,c, there is considerable reserve of shear capacity in the 
elements, but not that much more than calculations may predict.
The tests were carried out by the author according to Annex J of European Product 
Standard BS EN 1168:2005 +A3:2011 (BS EN 1168, 2005). The test specimens involved 
1200 mm wide×150 to 400 mm depth hcu and 100 and 150 mm depth solid units. Concrete 
strength was around fck =47 N/mm2 and fck,cube=60 N/mm2 (compared with design grade 
C45/55) and flexural test strength fctm,fl =5.5 N/mm2. The distance from the centre of sup￾port to the applied cross-line load was 2.5h and 1.5h for the hcu and solid units, respectively,

over a span of 4.0 m. Loading was carried out in two cycles up to a shear reaction of 0.7 
VRd,c, as shown in Figure 10.6, where the recovery of deflection was at least 94%.
The main conclusion from the tests was that the behaviour of the hcu was different from 
that of the solid units because of the relatively low moment of resistance of the solid units 
compared with their shear capacity. The experimental test shear capacity Vu of the hcu 
ranged from 198 to 528 kN, for 150 to 400 mm depth, compared with design values based 
on the nominal section and material properties of the hcu of VRd,c=99 to 239 kN, respec￾tively, an average ratio of 2.06 to 1.92, respectively. Corresponding ratios Vu/VRd,c for 100 
and 150 mm depth solid units were 1.12 and 1.06.

The calculated shear capacities VRd,calc of the hcu ranged from 187 to 469 kN, for 150 to 
400 mm depth. The average ratio Vu/VRd,calc was 1.13–1.03, respectively, although this ratio 
was as high as 1.17 in some 250 and 300 mm depth hcu. Figure 10.7 presents the ratios 
Vu/VRd,calc in all tests. According to BS EN 1168, Annex J, the ratio of the failure test value to 
the respective calculated value is ≥0.95 per tests, and ≥1.0 for the mean of three specimens. 
The results show that all tests (except one at a ratio of 0.94) achieved these criteria.

The 100 and 150 mm depth solid units did not achieve the predicted shear capacity VRd,calc
due to prior flexural cracking as shown in Figure 10.8, although both flexural and shear 
cracking were observed. For this reason, the solid units are compared with their cracking 
moments of resistance Mcr,calc at the position of the applied load, also shown in Figure 10.7 
(grey symbols). The ratio of Mu/Mcr,calc was in the range 1.36–1.60 for 100 mm depth units 
(due to higher prestress in the latter) and 1.06 for 150 mm depth units.

10.1.2 Ultimate shear tests on prestressed T 
beams in beam and block flooring
T beams (Figure 2.5) in beam and block flooring are mostly structurally isolated from other 
beams in the flooring system, i.e. known as ‘singles’ they support infill blocks on both sides 
(Figure 2.30) and therefore the shear capacity Vu of this single beam is the statically deter￾minate capacity. Where two or three beams, or ‘doubles’ or ‘triples’ are used, there is some 
possibility of shear redistribution thanks to the insitu infill grout placed between the beams, 
and more than 2 (or 3) times Vu. However, the shear capacity VRd,c of the single beam is 
used in design.
Shear tests were carried out by the author on 150 × 92 mm and 225 × 136 mm depth ×width 
beams. The tests were carried out using a single point load positioned at a distance of 1.5 times 
the depth of the beam, or about 2.0 and 1.9 times the effective depth d to the pretensioning 
wires in the bottom of the 150 and 225 mm depth beams, respectively, over nominal effec￾tive span of 4.0 m. See Figures 10.9 and 10.10. Concrete strength was around fck = 54 N/mm2
and fck,cube = 77 N/mm2 (compared with design grade C55/67) and flexural test strength 
fctm,fl = 5.87 N/mm2. The transfer strength at 20 hours was not measured and is reliably 
assumed to be fck(t) = 30 N/mm2, with fctm(t) = 2.63 N/mm2. Loading was carried out in 
two cycles up to a shear reaction of 0.7 VRd,c, as shown in Figure 10.11a and b, where 
the recovery of deflection averaged 86% and 83% for 150 and 225 mm depth beams, 
respectively.
The failure of the 150 mm depth beams was by shear-tension at the bottom of the 48 
mm width upstand, where the applied load at the first major diagonal crack or cracks 
was also the failure load, as shown in Figure 10.9. Flexural cracks did not develop into 
shear cracks, probably because the ratio of the bending stress to the bending resistance at 
this point was about 0.91. The experimental test shear capacity Vu ranged from 42.8 to 
49.6 kN (a variation of ±9%) compared with design values based on the nominal section, 
design material properties and a bearing distance from the end of the beam of 150 mm, 
of VRd,c = 14.0 kN; an average ratio of 3.34. The calculated shear capacities VRd,calc ranged 
from 25.3 to 26.0 kN. The average ratio Vu/VRd,calc was 1.83, clearly ≥ 1.0 for the mean of 
three specimens.
Figure 10.9 Shear-tension failure in 150 mm depth T beam. (With permission by Litecast Ltd., UK.)302 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The failure of the 225 mm depth beams was caused by shear-tension initiated by flexural 
cracking at the bottom of the beam, probably because the ratio of the bending stress to the 
bending resistance at this point was about 1.13. The first flexural crack developed into a 
shear crack. Therefore, the first major diagonal crack or cracks were not necessarily at the 
failure load, as shown in Figure 10.10. Shear failure then occurred at the bottom of the 
upstand, where σcp is not only due to prestress but also by a contribution from a compressive 
bending stress. The experimental Vu ranged from 119.4 to 122.0 kN (a variation of ±1%) 
compared with VRd,c=35.1 kN; an average ratio of 3.45. VRd,calc ranged from 62.8 to 63.8 
kN. The average ratio Vu/VRd,calc was 1.92. If the contribution from the bending stress at 
the bottom of the upstand, which averaged +5.6 N/mm2 in the three tests, is added into the 
calculation the average ratio Vu/VRd,calc decreases to 1.46.
The ratios Vu/VRd,calc = 1.83 and 1.46 are considerably greater than would be expected 
from such shear tests; typically 1.1 to 1.3. This may in part be explained by the close clear 
shear distance av, from the edge of the bearing to the edge of the loading platen, as shown 
in BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 6.4 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004) ‘loads near supports’, being only 
1.13d and 1.31d for the 150 and 225 mm depth beams, respectively. The ultimate load 
reduction factor β = av/2d, given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.2.2 (6), may now be inverted 
to give an increased shear capacity VRd,calc for loads near to supports. As the β factor in 
clause 6.2.2 (6) is not entirely appropriate to the calculation of psc VRd,calc, as it does not 
affect the axial prestress, it may be applied to the principal tensile strength of concrete in 
the plane of cracking.
Therefore increasing the tensile strength of the concrete for the 150 mm depth beams 
by 1/β = 2d/av = 1.78 has the effect of reducing the ratio Vu/VRd,calc to 1.20. Similarly for 
225 mm depth beams the factor 1/β = 1.53 reduces the ratio Vu/VRd,calc to 1.12. Both are 
now within the anticipated range and give confidence to the shear behaviour of these 
beams.

combined with the precompression σcp due to prestress acting at the centroidal axis of the 
section. The critical design point is where an inclined plane, taken as 45° from the edge of 
bearing as shown in Figure 10.12, meets the intersection of the centroidal axis, providing 
that localised forces and stresses at end connections are dealt with and do not interrupt 
the distribution of shear. Shear capacity is determined only at the ultimate state – unlike in 
flexure there are no limiting service conditions for shear. However, there is a paradox here 
because some of the design equations derive from an elastic analysis.
Ultimate shear capacity is the sum of the various actions of the concrete (= aggregate 
interlock), prestress (= precompression), longitudinal tendons (= dowel action) and shear 
reinforcement (= stirrup action). However, many psc elements, such as extruded/slipformed 
hcu and solid units, have no shear reinforcement due to their manufacturing methods, with 
the only reinforcement being longitudinal pretensioning strands or wires. The shear capac￾ity of these units therefore depends on the shear resistance of the concrete in combination 
with precompression and dowel action of the tendons alone.
The calculation of shear capacity carries numerous partial safety factors
i. tensile strength γc=1.5, then fctd =0.7 fctm/1.5
ii. precompression γp,fav=0.9
iii. strength due to aggregate interlock CRd,c/1.5
iv. transmission length 1.2, then lpt2 =1.2 lpt
v. bond strength γc=1.5
There are good reasons for this, as shown by the sudden failures due to a single crack in 
Figures 10.1–10.3. The position and inclination of this crack, typically 35°–40° (depend￾ing on the position of the shear load) has a major influence of the ultimate shear capacity.
Shear capacity in prestressed sections is calculated for two conditions: the flexurally 
uncracked section and the flexurally cracked section in flexure, defined in Figure 10.13.
The uncracked ultimate shear resistance VRd,c (BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.2.2, Exp. 6.4) is 
greater than the ultimate cracked value VRd,cr (BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 6.2) because the full 
section properties are considered and a small amount of diagonal tension in the concrete 
is permitted. (Note that the Code’s notation is VRd,c for both - this book uses VRd,cr for the 
flexurally cracked capacity.)
The ratio of VRd,c/VRd,cr to BS EN 1992-1-1 is typically 1.3 to 2.0 (the latter being for max￾imum prestress). This is advantageous because the maximum design shear force VEd, which

usually occurs where the flexural moments are small may be equated with VRd,c – the greater 
shear capacity. The position of the cracked section depends on the loading conditions, but 
for uniformly distributed loads, it is usually far enough into the span so as to render a check 
against VRd,cr as unwarranted – however VRd,cr should always be checked.
Two modes of shear failure are possible: flexural shear and shear tension. The occurrence 
of each is not merely a function of the shear span ratio, av/d where av is the distance to the 
primary shear force and d is the effective depth to the tendons in the shear plane, although 
the latter do usually occur when av/d<2 to 3.
Flexural shear occurs if a flexural crack develops into a shear crack, as shown in the 
failure of the solid unit in Figure 10.8. It is usually the first (or second) flexural crack which 
causes the shear failure. Failure occurs when the shear force exceeds the shear compression 
capacity and a single flexural crack initiates shear failure.
Shear tension failures are also possible where diagonal cracks are found close to the 
ends of the units propagating through the unprestressed and unreinforced regions of the 
slab (see Figures 10.1–10.3). Figure 6.14 shows the development of prestress in a simple 
rectangular section. According to BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 8.16 the length over which pre￾stress gradually disperses to become a linear distribution across the depth of the section is 
given by ldisp = √(lpt2 + d2). For the 250 mm depth hcu used in Example 10.1 ldisp = 640 mm, 
or 3.1d. Stresses in hcu are further complicated by the cross-sectional shape of the unit. 
It is further assumed that the extremity of the support bearing pressure spreads at an 
angle of about 45° from the inner bearing point. Walraven and Mercx (Walraven and 
Mercx, 1983) studied the bearing capacity (i.e. VRd,c) of hcu in considerable detail and 
suggested that an increment equal to half the depth of the slab is required for a shear 
tension crack to develop. The direct transmission of forces, by strut and tie action, does 
not occur in psc members which rely on the development of bond to satisfy the truss 
analogy.

10.2.2 Shear capacity in the flexurally uncracked region, VRd,c
The term ‘uncracked’ refers to flexural cracking, and where this exists VRd,c must not be 
used. The ultimate shear capacity is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause as 6.2.2 (1) as
Exp. 6.4 VRd,c=(Ic bw/S) √(fctd2 +αl γp,fav σcp fctd) (10.1a)
For a solid rectangular section, this may be replaced by
VRd,c=⅔ bw h √(fctd2 +αl γp,fav σcp fctd) (10.1b)
3.1.6.2 (P) fctd =0.7 fctm/1.5
6.2.2 (2) αl=lx/lpt2 (See Eq. 10.4) (10.2)
6.2.2 (2) σcp =Ppo/Ac=compressive stress at the centroidal axis 
due to prestress after all losses (10.3)
2.4.2.2 (1) γp,fav=0.9 as this is a favourable effect
For flanged sections bw is taken as the web width (= narrower part). In flanged sections 
where the centroidal axis is in the flange Eq. 10.1 should be applied at the junction of the 
web-flange, i.e. σcp is calculated there. For cross sections where the width varies over the 
height, the maximum principal stress may occur on an axis other than the centroidal axis. 
In such a case, the minimum value of the shear resistance should be found by calculating 
VRd,c at various axes in the cross section. This is particularly relevant to I beams and some 
types of hcu with tall oval shape cores, where the principal shear tension stress occurs below 
the centroidal axis. See Section 10.2.5.
The critical shear plane may occur in the prestress development zone where σcp is not 
fully developed. It is known that prestressing forces develop somewhere between linearly 
and parabolically, although BS EN 1992-1-1, Figs. 8.16 and 8.17 (combined here in Figure 
10.14) adopt a linear development of stress in service and bi-linear at ultimate. Therefore, a 
reduced value αl σcp is used up to lpt2, where αl=lx/lpt2. Known as the ‘critical distance’ to the 
shear point lx is measured from the very end of the unit (not the centre or edge of bearing) 
to a shear plane drawn at 45° from the inner edge of the bearing, then lx =lb +yb. lpt2 is the 
transmission length as follows
Exp. 8.18 Design transmission length lpt2 =1.2 lpt (10.4)
Exp. 8.16 Basic transmission length lpt=α1 α2 σpm0 Φ /fbpt (10.5)
Transmission length coefficients are
α1 =1.0 for gradual release
α2 =0.25 for indented wire, α2 =0.19 for 3-wire and 7-wire strand
Φ= diameter of strand or wire, or averaged if different diameters are used of the same 
type and same fpk
The coefficient of α2 = 0.25 for wire comes from the basic bond length equation given 
in BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 8.3 for a circular cross section. The coefficient of α2 = 0.19 for 
strand derives from the ratio of the actual cross-sectional area of the strand to the appar￾ent area based on the nominal diameter, e.g. for 12.5 mm diameter strand the ratio is Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 307
93/(π 12.52/4) = 0.758. Then α2 = 0.758 × 0.25 = 0.189. For 9.3 mm strands it is 52/(π
9.32/4) = 0.765, and α2 = 0.765 × 0.25 = 0.191.
Exp. 8.15 Bond strength fbpt=η1 η2 fctd(t) (10.6)
where η1 =1.0 for gradual release
η2 =2.7 for indented wires, and 3.2 for 3-wire and 7-wire helical strand
The coefficient η2 =2.7 comes from the same coefficient as for high tensile ribbed bars of 
2.25 (BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp 8.2) but multiplied by 1.2, i.e. 1.2×2.25=2.7. This gives a 
reduced value for the basic transmission length lpt which is then compensated by the same 
factor 1.2 in Exp. 8.18. The coefficient for strand η2 =3.2 reflects the beneficial profile of 
helical strand composed of individual wires.
8.10.2.2. Design tensile strength at transfer fctd(t)=0.7 fctm(t)/1.5
3.1 & 3.4 fctm(t)=fctm fcm(t)/fcm
Tests (Elliott, 2014) have shown that the Code’s value for αl
 in Exp. 6.4 may be multiplied 
by 1.5 for hcu manufactured using the long line manufacturing method in which the units 
are cut to length, rather than cast from a bare end. This comes from the results of full scale 
shear tests together with measurements of lpt in hcu pretensioned using 5 and 7 mm wire. No 
results are available for strand. However, a new bond-slip relationship for the determination 
of transfer length lpt in psc beams using strain gauges on strand has been proposed by Park 
and Cho (Park and Cho, 2014) followed by a finite element analysis by Oh et al. (Oh et al., 
2014). The results indicate that fck, σpm0 and Φ as well as concrete cover (not included in the

is lpt in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 8.10.2.2. Typical values for lpt are 40–80 diameters, and so 70 
diameters are frequently used in design for strand, and 100 for plain or indented wire. BS EN 
1992-1-1 imposes an upper bound lpt2 =1.2 lpt for ultimate design, e.g. for VRd,c. When checking 
service stress limits, such as for slippage or bursting stresses, a lower bound is used lpt1 =0.8 lpt.
Elliott and Jolly, Section 5.2.11 (Elliott and Jolly, 2013) showed comparisons of trans￾mission length to diameter ratio between BS EN 1992-1-1 and previous research data that 
are nearly all below the requirements in the code. The discrepancies are even greater when 
the 1.2 lpt factor is added. Results from experimental measurements of transmission length 
showed that there is scope to considerably reduce lpt in hcu, by about 30% if their unique 
manufacturing procedure of cutting units from long-line extruded or slip-formed castings is 
understood. Code values for lpt are based on the development of prestress from a cast end, 
rather than interrupting the bond by cutting the tendons.
Table 10.1 gives the ultimate shear capacity VRd,c for a wide range of hcu, from 150 to 
500 mm depth. The data show that, for the same generic type of hollow cores, in this case 
6 no. per 1200 mm width unit VRd,c is roughly proportional to depth, typically VRd,c=550h
to 600h (h in metres).
Example 10.1
Calculate the uncracked shear capacity VRd,c at the face of the support for the 250 mm 
depth prestressed hcu shown in Figure 6.7 and in Examples 6.1 and 7.1. Nominal bearing 
length lb =100 mm. Effective span of hcu=9.8 m. Self-weight of grouted unit=3.63 kN/
m2, floor screed=1.80 kN/m2, finishes=1.50 kN/m2 and services & ceiling=0.50 kN/m2. 
Imposed live load=5.0 kN/m2. The relevant section properties are Ic=1270×106 mm4, 
width of webs (ignoring the infill between hcu) bw =302 mm, and first moment of area 
Sc=6.783×106 mm3. Repeat the calculation for VRd,c at a distance from the support 
greater than the transmission length, i.e. where αl≥1. Check the ultimate shear force VEd
at the face of the support using the loads given above. Draw the shear force diagrams for 
the ultimate design shear force VEd and capacities VRd,c and VRd,cr.

The shear capacity VRd,c extends to a point where the service moment Ms<cracking moment 
Mc=(σb +fctk,0.05/γc) Zb,co according to clause 6.2.2 (2). See Figure 10.13. In the flexurally 
cracked region, shear resistance is a function of both the concrete and dowel action, as in 
reinforced concrete, plus a contribution of the level of compressive stress 0.15 σcp causing 
shear friction in the compressive zone. VRd,cr is calculated using the following (semi-empiri￾cal) equations

The critical value for VRd,cr is the greater of Eqs. 10.7 and 10.10.

Figure 10.15 shows the complete shear force diagrams for the ultimate design shear force 
VEd and capacities VRd,c and VRd,cr. Note that the shear force diagram VEd is curtailed 
close to the support where x<lb/2+yb.
10.2.4 Ultimate shear capacity at holes and notches
The formation, sizes and positions of holes and notches in slabs are the same as those given 
in Section 7.4 and in Figures 7.20 and 7.21.Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 311
VRd,c and VRd,cr for voids are calculated using the procedure in Sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 
using the residual width of the webs, and first and second moments of area after the void 
has been removed, and the remaining area of tendons after those at the void have been cut. 
The capacities are calculated as constant for the length of the void, and at either end of 
the void, they increase linearly to VRd,c and/or VRd,cr for the full capacity of the unit over a 
distance equal to the height to the centroid yb (Figure 7.21). Voids formed entirely through 
hollow cores are ignored. Lateral distribution of ultimate shear capacities at holes in slabs is 
not carried out as the shear forces are carried by the webs in each unit individually. There is 
certainly no lateral distribution of section properties at notches at the supports.
Example 10.3
Repeat Examples 10.1 and 10.2 and calculate the appropriate value for VRd,c or VRd,cr
for the hcu with a hole and end notch as defined in Example 7.8. Check the ultimate 
shear force VEd at the hole and face of the support using the loads given in Example 
10.1. The final pretensioning force at the hole and notch is Ppo = 597.8 and 638.0 kN, 
respectively.
Solution at the hole
Figure 10.15 shows that the hole, at 6.0 m from the left support, is in the region of flexur￾ally cracked shear.

10.2.5 Shear capacity of hollow core units due 
to combined stress in the webs
The calculation for VRd,c has always been carried out on a 45° shear plane at the centroidal axis, 
where it is understood that shear cracks will first propagate. This may not be the case in par￾allel-sided webs, e.g. oval or pear-shaped cores as in Figures 2.1 and 6.7, where the combined 
effects of the transfer of prestress and the principal shear stress may cause the shear failure to 
initiate at a point below the centroidal axis. BS EN 1992-1-1 recognises this in clause 6.2.2 (2)
For cross-sections where the (web) width varies over the height, the maximum prin￾cipal stress may occur on an axis other than the centroidal axis. In such a case the 
minimum value of the shear resistance should be found by calculating VRd,c at various 
axes in the cross-section.
BS EN 1168, clause 4.3.3.2.2.1 presents Eqs. 10.12–10.15 to calculate VRd,c at various points 
up the web along a 35° shear plane as shown in Figure 10.17. Then VRd,c(y) at distance lx
from the end of the unit and height y from the bottom of the section, where lx≥lb +0.5h, is

As an alternative to Eq. 10.12 the shear capacity at the centroidal axis may be according to 
Eq. 10.15, but factored as follows according to clause BS EN 1168, 4.3.3.2.2.3

where 0.9 is a reduction factor referred to the transmission length. BS EN 1168 states that 
VRd,c(y) need not be checked at points less than 0.5h from the edge of the support, lx<lb +0.5h.
This clause effectively rules out checking VRd,c at the bottom of the webs, where the greatest 
principal stresses actually occur. For example in a 250 mm depth hcu with a 35 mm bottom 
flange, 100 mm bearing length, lb +0.5h=225 mm, whereas lx =100+35/tan 35°=150 mm. 
In other words VRd,c is not checked until the height y=(225−100) tan 35°=87.5 mm, which 
is only about 35 mm below the centroidal axis. (For further information for other depths of 
hcu see Elliott and Jolly, 2013).
Although this expression is derived using a rectangular section and not the actual flanged 
section appropriate to hcu, the difference is accepted as being small. The familiar term

0.67bwh is replaced in BS EN 1992-1-1 by Icbw/S. Safety factors are built into the equations 
for VRd,c because γp,fav=0.9 (as a favourable effect) of the compressive stress σcp at the cen￾troidal axis is used. The value for fctd is also conservative.
Lin Yang (Yang, 1994) has proposed a design method to calculate the shear web capacity. 
The equation allows for changes in cross section, material properties and prestress levels. 
Web shear is critical at a point at the narrowest part of the web between the voids on a 
diagonal line inclined at 35° to the horizontal from the edge of the support. This is typically 
0.72h from the support, where h is the depth of the slab. Comparisons with 118 tests at VTT 
in Finland found that a 95% confidence limit could be used in this equation if the value so 
obtained is decreased by (approximately) 50 kN.
Test results, starting with Yang, have shown that where hcu have narrow webs just above 
the top of the strands, the maximum shear stress occurs there, and there is a reduction in 
VRd,c of between 0.7 and 1.0, depending on the shape of the web. The ratio of the minimum 
value of VRd,c to ‘VRd,c at the centroid’ is about 0.95 in circular cores, where the web is nar￾row on the centroidal axis.
The vast majority of shear tests have been carried out on hcu up to 250 mm deep, where 
the correlation of the ultimate shear capacity VRd,c has generally been within about 10%.
Referring to the 250 mm depth hollow core unit designed in Example 10.1, VRd,c(y) has 
been recalculated according to Eqs. 10.12–10.14. The results are shown in Figure 10.18, in 
which VRd,c=136.2 kN at the centroid, and minimum VRd,c(y)=98.6 kN, a huge reduction 
of 28%. The value of τcp(y) at the centroid is +0.42 N/mm2. The steps in the results occur at 
changes in (i) width of webs, i.e. bw at the centroidal axis and in the lower core are 302 and 
662 mm, respectively, as shown in the dashed line in Figure 10.18, and (ii) at the level of the 
tendons (where CPt(y) changes from 0 to −1 and causes τcp to become negative) at y=40.8 mm.

cross section, section properties and prestress used in Exercise 10.1.Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 315
Applying the same analysis to units of similar profile but of other depths and limiting 
spans, and keeping bw =302 mm and the axial prestress σcp ≈5.2 N/mm2, gave the following. 
For h=150 mm the reduction is 9%, for h=200 mm it is 20%, for h=300 mm it is 38%, and 
for h=350 mm it is 45%. The minimum value of VRd,c(y) always occurred at the bottom of 
the parallel-sided part of the webs.
The reduction in shear capacity becomes marked when h≥300 mm. In perfectly parallel￾sided webs, the reductions have been shown by IPHA to be as low as 0.61, although this 
may have been at the very bottom of the webs and violated the lx<lb +0.5h rule. However, 
there is a clear message than in deeper units VRd,c(y) will surely be less than VRd,c(c.g.). ACI￾318 (ACI, 2008) stated that hcu greater than 320 mm deep should have shear reinforcement 
when the ultimate shear force Vu >0.5 Vcw, i.e. without using shear reinforcement, which is 
impractical in production, Vcw is halved!
Example 10.4
Calculate VRd,c at y=65 mm from the bottom of the unit where the total web width is 
302 mm for the hcu in Example 10.1 as shown in cross section in Figure 6.7. Section 
analysis has found that at this height y: Ac(y)=103600 mm2, Sy=5.735×106 mm3, 
Ic=1270×106 mm4, Yc=123 mm and zcp =82.2 mm. The shear span at this point from 
Example 10.1 is 9800−100−2×65=9570 mm. The design shear force at this point is 
VEd =20.14×9.57/2=96.4 kN.
Solution
lx at y=65 mm=100+65 cot 35°=193 mm
Pt(lx)=860.2×193/726=228.5 kN
∂Pt(lx)/∂x=Pt/lpt2 =860.2×103/726=1185 N/mm
Yc−yPt=zcp =82.2 mm
CPt(y)=0 because Yc>yPt=40.8 mm
Eq. 10.14 τcp(y)=1185×(103600/168000−5.735×82.2/1270)/302=0.96 N/mm2
MEd at ×=193−100/2=143 mm from centre of bearing=wEdLx/2
−wEdx2/2=20.14×9.8×0.143/2−20.14×0.1432/2=13.9 kNm
Yc−y=123−65=58.0 mm
Eq. 10.13 σcp(y)=228500 (1/168000+58×82.2/1270×106)=+2.22 N/mm2 minus the 
bending stress 13.9×106 ×58/1270×106 =−0.63 N/mm2 is +1.59 N/mm2
Eq. 10.12 VRd,c(y)=(1270×302/5.735)×[√(1.772 +1.59×1.77)−0.96]×10−3 =98.9 kN
Using the simplified Eq. 10.15 and the value of VRd,c from Example 10.1 gives 
VRd,c=0.8×134.3=107.4 kN, some 9% greater than the minimum VRd,c(y)=98.6 kN.
10.2.6 Shear capacity of hollow core units with filled cores
It is not possible to provide shear reinforcement in hcu, and therefore the prestressed con￾crete must do the work. (There are some production systems that enable a light mesh to be 
cast in the webs of very deep units, e.g. 500–750 mm, but this is not common.) A note of 
caution must be added here; it is not economical to increase the number of prestressing wires 
merely to satisfy shear. For example, increasing the area of prestressing reinforcement by a 
factor of 4 increases the flexural capacity by about 2.5 times and the shear capacity by only 
1.2 times. The most economical method of increasing the shear capacity is to make the ends 
of the units solid by opening the tops of the cores and filling them with structural grade 
concrete, often using self-compacting concrete. A less popular alternative is to increase the 
depth of the slab.316 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The additional shear capacity with a number n (at least 2) of filled cores is according to 
BS EN 1168, Annex F, clause F.3 as
VRd,t=⅔ n bc dc fctdi (10.16)
where bc=width of core (mean if cores are of different width)
dc=depth of core (although BS EN 1168, Fig. F.1 shows this as the effective depth to the 
tendons)
fctdi=design tensile strength for the infill of strength fcki
The ⅔ term is derived from experimental data where filled cores do not achieve their full 
shear capacity prior to shear failure in the surrounding webs in the psc unit.
It is important to note that because the volume of concrete above the core is already uti￾lised in the calculation of VRd,c this may not be used twice and therefore unlike Fig. F.1 the 
actual depth of the core is used in Eq. 10.16. If the top opened cores are wide, and option is 
to calculate the section properties Ic and Sc used in VRd,c based on the removal of the concrete 
above those cores.
Some hcu have a greater shear capacity, with all things being equal, than others. The 
slip-formed type floor with a large number of webs has a shear capacity about 30%–40% 
greater than its extruded counterpart.
For example, the basic hcu designed in Example 10.1 has VRd,c=134.3 kN. Referring to 
Figure 6.7, with 6 no. filled cores using fcki=25 N/mm2, VRd,t=⅔×6×140×(250−40−35)×
1.197×10−3 =117.3 kN, where=0.7×0.3×252/3/1.5=1.197 N/mm2. Then the total VRd,c+t=13
4.3+117.3=251.6 kN. By comparison, the ultimate shear capacity of a 1200 mm width×250 
mm depth solid unit, having the same material properties but with the prestress reduced by 
30% in order to control transfer stresses is VRd,c=389 kN. A slipformed hcu with 11 no.×60 
mm wide oval cores and total width of webs of 474 mm, having the same material properties 
and prestress as the hcu in Example 10.1, has VRd,c=203.7 kN (51% greater), VRd,t=113.2 kN 
and VRd,c+t=316.9 kN (26% greater).
10.2.7 Shear capacity of hollow core units with 
sloping or top notched ends
Sloping or top notched ends are often used to assist in the fixing of hcu or solid slabs onto 
steel, or similar, shelf angles, as shown in Figures 7.16 and 10.19. The precast unit is slewed 
towards one end support at an angle of about 5° to the horizontal, and the gap created by 
the slope or notch enables it to be positioned. The unit is pushed up against the inner face of 
the bearing enabling the remote end to be lowered into position.
The length of the splay is typically x=400 mm and the depth y=75–120 mm, depend￾ing on the depth of the unit, as defined in Figure 10.19. There is clearly a reduction in VRd,c
which is now based on the residual prestress in the shear plane x-x, obtained from striking a 
45° line from the edge of the bearing. The effective depth at the shear plane=ds. The critical 
depth of the section at the shear plane is hs. If the section is cast solid at the time of manufac￾ture, the total cross section is prestressed. The net width of the reduced section bs=bt
 minus 
width of any vertical notch(s) or holes.
The following analysis is applicable only to non-composite units as composite units are 
completely filled using insitu concrete inclusive of the topping.Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 317

(h−hs
)/y=(x−hs−lb)/x
Then hs=(hx−yx+ylb)/(x−y) (10.17)
For example, if h=250 mm, x=400 mm, y=120 mm and lb =100 mm, then hs=229 mm
If length of splay x<lb +h, then hs=h and VRd,c,splay=VRd,c
If VRd,c,splay<VRd,c, then VRd,c,splay replaces VRd,c as the critical shear capacity.
If top notched is recessed (not sloping) hs=h−y
Then, following Eq. 10.1

where Ic, S, bw and σcp are based on the section of bottom flange and webs bw (inclusive of 
vertical notches and holes) of height hs.
If the section is solid, it is effectively a rectangular section such that
, , , = √ 0.67 ( ) + α γ σ p,fav cp 2 V b Rd c solid splay s s h fctd c l f td (10.19)
where σcp is based on the section bs hs.
Example 10.5
Calculate VRd,c if the basic hcu designed in Example 10.1 and shown in the cross section 
in Figure 6.7 contains sloping ends of length 600 mm and depth 100 mm, i.e. the bottom 
of the lope is level with the top of the parallel-sided webs. Also calculate VRd,c+t if the 
remainder of the hollow cores are filled using insitu concrete fcki=25 N/mm2. The bearing 
length onto a steel angle is 100 mm.
Solution
Sloping end dimensions x=600 mm, y=100 mm

10.3 SHEAR IN PRESTRESSED BEAMS
10.3.1 Shear capacity in the flexurally uncracked region, VRd,c
Ultimate shear design of psc beams follows the procedures adopted for floor units given in 
Section 10.2 in which the uncracked VRd,c and the flexurally cracked VRd,cr shear resistances 
are calculated. In many cases, designed shear reinforcement is often quite small, and the 
nominal area of stirrups suffices due to the high degree of prestress in main beams and the 
large spans over which they operate. However, shear reinforcement, in the form of inclined 
bars or vertical stirrups, is required at the ends of the beam in the vicinity of the connections, 
and, although the design does not require it shear reinforcement is added at progressively 
greater spacing. The design for shear reinforcement is given in Section 10.3.3. Figure 10.20 
shows an example of where shear stirrups placed in the end cage are progressively spaced 
further apart until the nominal area of stirrups is reached. This is not applicable to T beams 
for beam and block flooring, which do not have shear stirrups.
Figure 10.21 shows shear stirrups in a psc inverted-tee beam. The shape code for the stir￾rups in the upstand of the beam is not entirely typical, as the vertical leg of the stirrup is 
bent down (rather than continuous across the top of the cage) to permit the hand placement 
of longitudinal reinforcement on site to form a composite beam. The shear reinforcement in 
the bottom, or boot of the beam, will not contribute to the shear capacity and are therefore 
known as ‘links’ to resist the horizontal reaction of the floor units placed over them. See 
Elliott, Section 5.2.6 (Elliott, 2017) for further details and design procedures.

Figure 10.22 shows shear stirrups in the web of a psc double-tee floor unit. The preten￾sioning tendons have yet to be installed. The black box forms a halving joint at the end of 
the webs. Because the amount of prestress above the box is limited, the nib at the end of 
the web is designed on the basis of a static strut-and-tie. See Elliott and Jolly, Section 4.3.8 
(Elliott and Jolly, 2013) and Elliott, Section 10.3 (Elliott, 2017) for further details and 
design procedures.
Note that because VRd,c is dependent on αl=lx/lpt2, where the distance lx =lb +y, (Section 
10.2.2) and y=height to the point of shear (which may or may not be at the centroidal 
height yb from the bottom of the beam), the lowest value of VRd,c,min may occur just above 
the centroidal axis. In rectangular sections (applies also to solid slabs) where the bearing 
length lb =0.3h (h=height of beam) VRd,c,min occurs at y/h=0.58 where the ratio VRd,c,min/
VRd,c=0.982. For example, in a certain beam with b=300 mm, h=600 mm, fck =45 N/mm2, 
lpt2 =780 mm, σcp =8.74 N/mm2 (at centroidal height) and lb =200 mm, the variation in VRd,c
over the height of the beam is shown in Figure 10.23. At yb =300 mm VRd,c=415.6 kN but 
at y=350 mm VRd,c,min =408.1 kN. It is a small difference, but one which gets worse if the 
beam narrows above the centroidal axis, as in the case of inverted-tee beams.
In the calculation for VRd,c inverted-tee beams, the shear should be considered at both the 
centroidal axis and at the intersection of the upstand and boot. No general guidance can be 
given as to which of the two positions is critical because VRd,c is a function of prestress αl σcp
and geometry in the form of the shape function Ic bw/Sc. Figure 10.23 also shows the varia￾tion in VRd,c for the inverted-tee beam designed in Example 9.5 and shown in cross section 
in Figure 9.17, with b=h=600 mm, upstand bw =350 mm & hs=200 mm, fck =45 N/mm2, 
Figure 10.22 Shear reinforcement in the end of the webs in a prestressed double-tee floor unit.Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 321
lpt2 =812 mm, σcp =7.37 N/mm2 (at c.g.) and lb =200 mm. At yb =269.8 mm VRd,c=727.2 kN 
but at the intersection of the boot/upstand where y=400 mm VRd,c,min =496.3 kN, this time 
32% difference.
If the bending stress (introduced in Eq. 10.13) −MEd (Yc−y)/Ic is included in the expression 
for VRd,c the shear capacity at the intersection of the web and boot increases to 605.2 kN (an 
increase of 106.3 kN). In this example, the MEd is calculated from the centre of bearing at 
x=200/2+400=500 mm, where MEd =179.2 kNm and the additional stress due to bending 
is +2.86 N/mm2. The additional shear capacity due to bending is usually ignored in design.
10.3.2 Shear capacity in the flexurally cracked region VRd,cr
Ultimate shear design of psc beams follows the procedures adopted for prestressed floor 
units given in Section 10.2 in which the flexurally cracked VRd,cr shear capacity is calculated. 
The section is considered as flexurally cracked where Ms>Mc, where Mc=(σb +fctd) Zb,co.
Shear reinforcement in the flexurally cracked region is rarely necessary because the ulti￾mate shear resistance is a function of the ultimate flexural requirements. The shear span 
(MEd/VEd) for most beams in precast structures is span/4. Thus the shear force at the posi￾tion of flexural decompression rarely exceeds 0.5VRd,c, for example in Example 10.6 the 
shear at the point of decompression is 137 kN about 0.28 VRd,c. As with floor units (Section 
10.2.3) a minimum value of VRd,cr is calculated.
Example 10.6
Calculate VRd,c and VRd,cr for the inverted-tee beam in Examples 7.10 and 9.5. The bear￾ing length may be taken as 200 mm. Check VRd,c at (i) centroidal axis and (ii) intersection 
of the upstand and boot. Draw the shear force and shear capacity diagrams, showing

Mcr=ws Lx/2−ws x2/2
Giving the quadratic ws/2 x2 −ws L/2 x+Mcr=0
From which x=2.74 m from the centre of supports
Figure 10.24 shows the complete shear force diagrams for the ultimate design shear 
VEd and the capacities VRd,c and VRd,cr. The increase in VRd,c is linear within the transmis￾sion length lpt2. Quite often VRd,c at the end of the transmission length is not calculated as 
it is never critical, but is shown here for completeness.
10.3.3 Prestressed beams with shear reinforcement
The design for shear follows the normal procedures for reinforced concrete sections – that is 
the ultimate shear capacity is the sum of the concrete resistance (= aggregate interlock+dowel 
action but with the additional effect of prestress) plus the ultimate (= yield stress) capacity 
of the shear stirrups. The approach in EN 1992-1-1 is that these variables are combined in a 
single function known as the variable strut inclination (VSI) method. The inclination of the 
shear plane may vary from θ=21.8° to 45°, or cot θ=1.0 to 2.5, depending on the relationship 
between web width and the strength of the concrete strut. This is shown in the truss model in 
BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 6.5. Note the assumption that the lever arm between the top and bottom 
truss is z=0.9d, which is a reasonable assumption where the bending moment is small in the 
presence of shear, but not, for example in cantilevers where shear and bending are both large.

In main inverted-tee beams, the effective width of the web bw used in shear calculations 
depends on whether the centroid of the gross, flexurally uncracked, section occurs in the 
upstand or in the boot of the beam as shown in Figure 10.25. Where this in the upstand 
then bw =upstand width. However, where it lies in the boot the critical section may lie either 
at (i) the centroid or (ii) at the intersection of the upstand and the boot (i.e. bottom of the 
upstand), and both cases must be considered as shown in Figure 10.25b.
It would be very unusual not to use shear reinforcement in beams, although some minor 
elements where shear failure is neither likely nor critical may rely on dowel action of the 
main bars fully anchored at the support, and some psc wet-cast floor slabs do not have shear 
reinforcement.
If VEd>VRd,c designed shear reinforcement must be placed in the appropriate section. 
Shear stirrups will be placed in the upstand of the beam as shown in Figure 10.21. Links 
must also be provided in the boot of the beam to carry the bearing ledge forces, see Elliott, 
Section 5.2.6 (Elliott, 2017) for further details and design procedures. In the latter shear 
stirrups must be provided in the upstand or in the boot depending on where bw is taken. 
Designed shear stirrups must be additional to those required for torsion and the minimum 
shear stirrups for the bearing ledge reactions (see Example 10.7).
Referring to Figure 10.26 and to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.2.3, the number of stirrups 
crossing the shear plane=z cot θ/s. The ultimate force in each stirrup=area×stress=Asw 0.87 
fywk, then the ultimate resistance of the stirrups is
VRd,s=z 0.87 fywk cot θ (Asw/s) (10.20)
Note there is no VRd,c in this analysis, and VRd,c is not added to VRd,s.
Therefore the area of designed shear reinforcement Asw/s (mm2/mm run along the beam) 
is given by
Exp. 6.8 Asw/s≥VRd,s/z 0.87 fywk cot θ (10.21)
In the limit VEd =VRd,s. Then, if the diameter and hence area of the stirrups is chosen, typi￾cally in practice, then the spacing of the stirrups is given by
s=Asw z 0.87 fywk cot θ/VEd (10.22)
The area of shear reinforcement must be appropriate to the critical shear section; in this 
case, it is assumed this is at the top of the boot. Clearly, the VSI cot θ has a big influence on 
Asw/s; it can alter it by 250%! The expression for cot θ derives from the compressive strut, 
shown in Figure 10.26 and the Code’s Fig. 6.5, equal to the compressive stress σc acting

but 1.0≤cot θ≤2.5
For example let VEd =700 kN, b=300 mm, σcp =0.2 fcd, z=0.9×500=450 mm, fck =32 N/
mm2 and fywk =500 N/mm2. Then αcw =1.20, θ=0.5 sin−1 (700×103/(0.5×1.20×300×450×

mm=850 mm2/m per leg (if the single stirrup has two legs, or 425 mm2/m per leg for double 
stirrups with four legs). Use single H10 at 90 mm spacing (872 provided).
The minimum area of links is some function of concrete tensile strength √fck and b (or bv
in a web or upstand) as
Exp. 9.5N Asw,min/s≥0.08 √fck b/fywk (10.27)
The maximum area of links is given when the concrete stress reaches 0.5 fcd, as
Exp. 6.12 Asw,max/s≤0.5 αcw b z v1 fcd/0.87 fywk (10.28)
But is rarely critical even in narrow web beams.
The minimum spacing of stirrups is not specified in codes, but practically is about 50 mm 
for small links (8–10 mm dia.) or about 70 mm (12 mm dia.). The maximum spacing is as 
always 0.75d to avoid a 45° shear plane passing between two links as
9.2.2 (6) s≤0.75d (10.29)
Example 10.7
Calculate the requirement for shear stirrups in the prestressed inverted-tee beam shown 
in cross section in Figure 9.17 and designed in Example 10.6, but where the effective span 
is reduced to 5.50 m, the ultimate load carried by the beam is increased to 180.0 kN/m 
and there are dead and live point loads of 100 kN each at 1.0 m from the centre of bear￾ing. These are chosen to ensure that the moments of resistance calculated in Examples 
7.10 and 9.5 are not exceeded. Use H10 stirrups with Asw =157 mm2 per two-leg stirrup. 
Use fywk =500 N/mm2. Having determined the maximum requirement check if stirrups of 
greater spacing may be specified. Use the end cover to the start of the stirrups as 30 mm.
Also check the minimum shear stirrups if the ultimate load (excluding self-weight of 
beam) from the floor slab acting on the bearing ledge is 170.5 kN/m.
Solution
Lv=5500−2×(100+269.8)=4.760 m.
VEd =180.0×4.76/2=428.4 kN due to UDL.
PEd =1.25×100+0.7×1.5×100=230 kN for point loads
VEd =180.0×4.76/2+230×(5.50−1.00)/5.50=428.4+188.2=616.6 kN>498.9 kN from 
Example 10.6. Shear stirrups are required.

required.Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 327

z=0.9×480.8=432.7 mm
v1 fcd =0.6 (1−45/250)×(45/1.5)=14.76 N/mm2
Eq. 10.26 θ=0.5 sin−1 (616.6×103/(0.5×350×432.7×14.76)=16.74°
cot 16.74°=3.32<2.5. Use cot θ=2.5
Eq. 10.21 Asw/s=616.6×103/(432.7×0.87×500×2.5)=1.31 mm2/mm=655 mm2/m per 
leg. Spacing required is H10 at 119.8 mm spacing. Use H10 at 115 c/c (682 provided). For 
2 legs Asw/s=157/115=1.365 mm2/mm.
Eq. 10.20 VRd,s=432.7×0.87×500×2.5×1.365×10−3 =642.4 kN
Increase the spacing to 125 mm whence Asw/s=157/125=1.256 mm2/mm.
Eq. 10.20 VRd,s=432.7×0.87×500×2.5×1.256×10−3 =591.0 kN
The gradient of the shear force diagram is 180 kN/m. The shear force at the centre of 
bearing is VEd =180.0×5.50/2+188.2=683.2 kN. The distance to stirrups of 125 mm 
spacing is (683.2−591.0)×103/180=512 mm, plus half the bearing length (Lb/2=100 
mm)=612 mm from the end of the beam. Therefore, use 6 no. H10 at 115 mm from the 
end of the beam for a distance of 5×115+35=610 mm.
The distance from the centre of bearing where VEd <VRd,c=549.6 kN (from Example 
10.6 at the end of the transmission length) is x=(683.2−549.6)×103/180=742 mm. This 
is 742−512=230 mm beyond the end of the stirrups at 115 mm, therefore 2 no. H10 at 
125 mm.
The minimum area of stirrups (these could technically be called links as they do not 
contribute to the shear capacity).
Eq. 10.27 Asw,min/s≥0.08 √45×350/500=0.375 mm2/mm=188 mm2/m per leg.
Vertical reaction from the floor load acting on the bearing ledges at the top of the 
boot=170.5 kN/m. Then Asw =0.5×170.5×103/0.87×500=196 mm2/m per leg>188 
mm2/m per leg.
The requirement is H10 at 401 mm spacing. The maximum spacing is 0.75×480.8=360 mm. 
In practice, the maximum spacing of links is, depending on the designer’s preference, 
typically 300–400 mm. Use H10 at 360 c/c (218 mm2/m provided).
Eq. 10.28 Asw,max/s≤0.5×1.12×350×14.76/0.87×500=6.65 mm2/mm, not critical.
Figure 10.27 shows the complete shear force diagrams for the ultimate design shear VEd
and the prestressed concrete capacities VRd,c and VRd,cr and with shear stirrups VRd,cr.
10.3.4 Prestressed T beams in beam and block flooring
T beams are designed and manufactured without shear reinforcement. The procedures fol￾low those for floor units given in Section 10.2 in which the uncracked VRd,c and the flexur￾ally cracked VRd,cr shear resistances are calculated. Some beams have a narrow and tapered 
upstand, typically 42 mm width increasing to 48 mm at the intersection with the bottom 
flange, and therefore the shear capacity is based on an average web width bw =45 mm. As 
the centroidal axis is also just inside the upstand VRd,c will be critical here, as shown in the 
shear tests in Figure 10.9.328 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Example 10.8
Calculate VRd,c and VRd,cr for the 150 mm depth T beam used in beam and block floor￾ing in Examples 7.5 and 9.6. The bearing length may be taken as 100 mm. Check VRd,c
at (i) centroidal axis and, if necessary at (ii) intersection of the upstand and boot. Use 
fck = 55 N/mm2 and fck(t) = 32 N/mm2. Area of 4 wires for prestress Ap = 78.5 mm, and 
at for 3 wires at ultimate ApT = 58.9 mm2. Prior in-house analysis has found the pre￾stress after initial losses is σpm0 = 1229.3 N/mm2 and the final prestress is σp0 = 967.5 
N/mm2.
Solution
Material properties
fcm =55+8=63 N/mm2
fctm (for fck >50 N/mm2)=2.12 loge (1+63/10)=4.214 N/mm2
fcm(t)=32+8=40 N/mm2
fctm(t)=(40/63)×4.214=2.676 N/mm2
fctd(t)=0.7×2.676/1.5=1.249 N/mm2
fbpt=2.7×1.249=3.37 N/mm2
fctd =0.7×4.214/1.5=1.967 N/mm2
Flexurally uncracked capacity VRd,c
From Example 7.5 yb =61.9 mm>depth of bottom flange of 50 mm, therefore the width in 
shear is taken as the mean width (42+48)/2=45 mm (Figure 7.12) and VRd,c is calculated 
at the centroidal axis only. VRd,c is not required at the intersection of the upstand with the 
bottom flange, but is carried out here for interest.

αl=161.9/547=0.296
VRd,c=4507×√(1.9672 +0.296×7.60×1.967)×10−3 =12.98 kN
(ii) At the intersection of the upstand with the bottom flange, σcp =8.64 N/mm2 (greater 
than 7.60 N/mm2 because it is lower in the section), lx =100+50=150 mm, 
αl=150/547=0.274, bw =48 mm and S=166656 mm3.
Then VRd,c=(17.03×106 ×48/166656)×√(1.9672 +0.274×8.64×1.967)×10−3
=13.43 kN

From Example 9.6, d=121.7 mm and ApT =58.9 mm2
k=1+√(200/121.7)=2.28 therefore use 2.0
vmin =0.035×2.01.5 √55=0.73 N/mm2
As/bw d=58.9/(45×121.7)=0.01076
σcp =7.60 N/mm2
VRd,cr=[(0.12×2.0×(100×0.01076×55)1/3)+0.15×7.60]×45×121.7×10−3 =11.36 kN
VRd,cr minimum=(0.73+0.15×7.60)×45×121.7×10−3 =10.26 kN<11.36 kN therefore 
use VRd,cr=11.36 kN.
It noticed that the ratio VRd,cr/VRd,c=11.36/12.98=0.87 is much greater than the cor￾responding ratio of 0.44 for the main beam in Example 10.6. The influence of the con￾tribution from prestress 0.15 σcp in the term CRd,c k (100 ρ1 fck)
1/3 +0.15 σcp is a major 
factor in the T beam σcp is 7.60 N/mm2 compared with 3.67 N/mm2 in the main beam, 
the former being more highly stressed overall. It is unlikely that VRd,cr in T beams would 
ever be mobilised.
10.4 DESIGN FOR CONCENTRATED LOADS IN FLOOR UNITS
This section considers the design for concentrated loads, such as punching shear from point 
loads and the capacity of floor units supported on three edges, where shear and torsion com￾bine. The capacity of line loads either at the edges or within the width of psc floor elements 
is given in Sections 9.3.4. Whilst the design for concentrated loads in solid psc units can 
be found in BS EN 1992-1-1, a particular case worthy of the development of unique semi￾empirical equations is prestressed hcu. These are found in BS EN 1168 clauses 4.3.3.2.4 to 
4.3.3.2.6.
10.4.1 Punching shear in hollow core units
Trying to initiate a classical punching shear failure in hollow core floor units is very dif￾ficult, and the author has not been successful in several tests carried out on 200 mm depth 
units with 100 mm width cores, and 300 and 400 mm depth units with 140 mm width 
cores (similar to the profile in Figure 6.7). The failure mode is always by longitudinal 330 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
cracking along the line of the cores, as shown in Figures 10.28 and 10.29, even though the 
footprint of the load (150 mm square), positioned at mid-width of the units, was just wider 
than the width of the cores. A footprint as little as w=50 to 100 mm square (e.g. as speci￾fied for computer room cabinet bearings for which unscreeded units would be inappropri￾ate) is required to punch through the top flange directly over the core.
The mean cube strength of the hcu was measured as 57.5 N/mm2, converted to 
fck =0.8×57.5=46 N//mm2, almost the same as the design strength fck =45 N//mm2. The 
mean flexural strength was fctm =4.37 N/mm2 (compared with a design value of 3.80 
N/mm2). The mean axial prestress σcp (from three test units) was 3.90, 4.95, 4.94 and 5.05 
N/mm2 for the 200 (low prestress), 200 (high prestress), 300 and 400 mm depth units, 
respectively. Using Eq. 10.30 the design punching strength VRd was calculated on the basis 
of design parameters, and the predicted strength VRd,calc was based on measured parameters 
without partial safety factors. The effective width of the webs (see Figure 10.30) was beff=80 
mm (2 no. webs) and 45 mm (1 no. web) for the 200 mm, and 300 and 400 mm depth units, 
respectively. The failure shear force Vu (i.e. point load/2) varied from 75.2 to 128.7 kN. 
When normalised with respect to VRd and VRd,calc for each test in turn, the average ratio of 
Vu/VRd =1.66, 1.82, 3.04 and 2.20 for the 200 (low), 200 (high), 300 and 400 mm depth 
units, respectively. The corresponding average ratio of Vu/VRd,calc=1.10, 1.07, 2.21 and 1.59. 
The larger ratio for the 300 mm compared with 400 mm depth units was due to Vu being 
almost the same for the two sets of tests, as the failure mode was governed by longitudinal 
splitting of the top flange, which is the same 35 mm thickness in both profiles, but a lower 
value of VRd (by a factor of 1.35 reflecting the shallower depth).

In spite of this evidence, BS EN 1168, clause 4.3.3.2.4 gives an expression for punching 
shear capacity VRd in untopped hcu as

h=depth of unit
αl=lx/lbpd ≤1 if the point load is within a distance less than the total anchorage length 
(defined in Section 9.5) from the centre of support.
By rearranging Eq. 10.30, VRd is equal to the shear-tension capacity of the webs (beff h fctd) 
plus 0.3 times the effective prestress in the webs (0.3 αl
 σcp beff h), similar to historic values. 
VRd is heavily influenced by the width of the footprint relative to the width of the cores, 
particularly if w<½ core width, e.g. in some deeper slip formed units core width=150–250 
mm. Clause 4.3.3.2.4 states that if w<½ core width, h in Eq. 10.30 is replaced by hf
 (top 
flange depth) and beff=w. There are several complications at free edges in the outermost web 
for which the best solution is to open and insitu infill the first core. Clause 4.3.3.2.4 states 
that if more than 50% of the load is acting on the outermost web (i.e. only 2 webs active) Eq. 
10.30 is applicable, provided that one tendon is in that web and transverse reinforcement is 
present, i.e. in reality a structural topping with As=FEd/0.87 fyk locally. The topping could 
be localised over the edge unit if it is possible for this unit to be (say) 50 mm shallower than 
the rest of the units in the floor field. If one or both of these is not satisfied, then use 0.5 VRd.
Consider a point dead load of 50 kN acting over a footprint 300 mm square at 1.0 m from 
the centre of support of a 6.0 m simply supported 250 mm depth hcu, shown in cross section 
in Figure 6.7. The unit is grouted in and the load is not at a free edge. The hcu contains 140 
mm wide cores and 40 mm webs. Concrete fck =45 N/mm2, fctd =1.77 N/mm2, axial prestress 
γp,fav σcp =4.61 N/mm2, the unit contains 9.3 and 12.5 mm strands such that lbpd =1230 mm. 
If the bearing length is 100 mm, αl=(1000+100/2)/1230=0.854. A 300 mm wide footprint, 
centred over one of the cores, will be resisted by only 2 no. webs, then beff=80 mm.
Eq. 10.30 VRd =80×250×1.77 (1+0.3×0.854×4.61/1.77)×10−3 =59.0 kN
Maximum reaction from the load VEd =1.35×50×(6.0−1.0)/6.0=56.3 kN<59.0 kN.
10.4.2 Load capacity of hollow core units 
supported on three edges
This section has considered the local load capacities of hcu in a one-way spanning floor 
slab. If the edge unit is supported along one edge by a gable wall or beam, the unit is classed 
as supported on ‘three edges’ and is subjected to shear, bending and torsion. BS EN 1168, 
clause 4.3.3.2.6 provides semi-empirical data for the imposed service load capacity in units 
of kN/m2 (excludes self-weight) of such units as
qk =Wt
 fctk,0.05/0.06 l2 (10.31)
where Wt=elastic torsional section modulus=min{2t (h−hf)(b−bw); 
b2h/(3+1.8b/h)} (10.32)
bw =width of outermost web
t=min {hf; bw}
hf
 is the smaller of hft and hfb
However, in the general equations for torsional moments of resistance (h−hf) actually con￾siders the actual distance between the centres of the flanges, i.e. (h−hft/2−hfb/2).
Continuing the same example, with l=6.0 m and bw =51 mm outermost web, Wt=2×
35×(250−40/2−35/2)×(1200−51)=17.09×106 mm3 (note that b2h/(3+1.8b/h)=30.9×106Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 333
mm3 and is difficult to see how it applies to a hollow section). Then qk =17.09×106 ×2.66/
(0.06×60002)=21.05 kN/m2. This imposed load would not exceed the service moment of 
resistance of the hcu considered (in Figure 6.7), and is therefore shown to be critical should 
the hcu happen to be supported on ‘three edges’.
10.5 SLIPPAGE OF PRETENSIONED TENDONS
Although Elliott and Jolly (2013) provide an extensive discussion of this topic, it is appropri￾ate to include a summary here.
Slippage (sometimes called ‘pull-in’) ΔLo is the shortening of tendons after transfer of 
prestress. It is the cumulative effect of movement of tendons relative to the concrete due to 
bond slip within the basic transmission length lpt. It appears at the ends of prestressed ele￾ments, as shown in Figure 10.31, and gives an indication that prestress has developed cor￾rectly, particularly in the transmission zone, but is not a definitive measurement of prestress.
The subject is comprehensively reviewed, and the relationship between ΔLo and Lt
 anal￾ysed in a thesis by Paul Kong (Kong, 1993). Referring to Figure 10.32

Ep =modulus of elasticity of tendons
BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 8.10.2.1 specifies a linear increase in prestress, such that
ΔLo =σpm0 lpt/2 Ep (10.35)
For a parabolic increase, the denominator is 3, i.e. ΔLo =σpm0 lpt/3 Ep. If it is linear-parabolic 
increase in prestress, the denominator is 3, i.e. ΔLo =σpm0 lpt/2.5 Ep and it takes the familiar 
form given in BS EN 13369, clause 4.3.2.3.4 (BS EN 13369, 2018)
ΔLo =0.4 lpt2 σpm0/Ep (10.36)
Note the transmission length is increased to lpt2 even though this is not a design issue. 
Slippage is routinely observed and often measured by manufacturers. In typical produc￾tion, slippage is about 1–2 mm. Theoretically, it cannot be zero, but often appears to be 
so. Slippage of wire tends to be more consistent than with strand, particularly if there is a 
concentration of large diameter strands in a small area, and is quite common if a group of 3 
strands are positioned in a line, rather than in a triangular formation.
The limit for slippage is a manufacturing issue, rather than a design issue, and as such 
is not given in BS EN 1992-1-1. However, BS EN 13369, clause 4.2.3.2.4 states that mean 
slippage in an element (both ends) should not exceed
ΔLo =0.4 lpt2 σpm0/Ep (10.37)
and for an individual tendon not more than 1.3 ΔLo
For example of strand, if σpm0 =0.7×1770×0.95 (5% loss), and lpt2 =(say) 600 mm, ΔLo =
0.4×1177×600/195000=1.45 mm, and 1.3 ΔLo =1.88 mm. These are reasonable limits 
to work to, but this clause does not explain how, or if, the capacity of a psc element may 
be reassessed if is ΔLo exceeded. This is also known as ‘slippage’ δs and therefore to avoid 
confusion ΔLo is sometimes known as ‘pull-in’.
If δs>ΔLo by 2 or 3 mm in a couple of tendons, the effect on lpt and mechanical strength 
will be small, but if δs=5 or 6 mm in all tendons, re-analysis for residual prestress, or rejec￾tion of the unit, are possible courses of action.
The FIP Manual ‘Quality assurance of hollow core slab floors’, clause 3.5.3. (FIP 1992) 
gives a production limit based on an upper bound value for transmission length lpt=13 Φ √
σpm0/fcu(t) and slippage ΔLo =0.5 εpm0 lt. For example, consider a hcu with fcu(t)=35 N/mm2, 
with 12.5 mm strands stressed to 70%×1770 N/mm2 and 5% losses at transfer, lpt=13×12.5
×√1177/35=942 mm, and ΔLo,limit=0.5×0.00604×942=2.85 mm. This is multiplied by 1.5 
for an individual tendon ΔLo,limit=4.3 mm, and this would be an acceptable limit.
For the relationship between slippage and residual prestress, some designers take the FIP 
limit to be non-contributory and re-calculate the capacity on a reduced number of tendons. Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 335
Others use a linear scale to determine residual prestress, taking the ratio of prestress with/
without slippage from 1.0 where δs=ΔLo to zero where δfree=free elastic shortening over half 
the length of the unit for the tendons having δs>ΔLo. Then δfree=0.5 L σpm0/Ep.
Continuing the example above, let slippage δs,mean =4.0 mm occur in half the number 
of tendons in a hcu of 6.0 m length. Now δfree=1177×3000/195000=18.1 mm. The pre￾stress in tendons with slippage is given pro-rata as [(δfree−δs,mean)/ δfree] σpm0 =[(18.1−4.0)/
18.1]×1177=917 N/mm2. The mean effective prestress σpm0,eff=(0.5×917+0.5×1177)=1
047 N/mm2, and this is used to calculate losses due to elastic shortening, creep and relax￾ation, leading to a reduced value of Msr. Comparison with the research by Evans (Evans and 
Robinson, 1955) who measured the loss of strain at end of the transmission zone as 0.14 
δmean/lpt=0.14×2.7/600=0.00063, where δmean =(0.5×4.0+0.5×1.45)=2.7 mm. Residual 
strain=(1177/195000)−0.00063=0.00541, and residual stress=0.00541×195000=1055 
N/mm2 (giving reasonable agreement with 1047 N/mm2).
The increase in lpt2 for strands with slippage is given as lpt2’=δs Ep/0.4 σpm0 =4.0×195000
/0.4×1177=1656 mm. The mean length by superposition lpt2’,mean =0.5×1656+0.5×600=1
128 mm. This is used to recalculate the reduced shear capacity VRd,c.
Slippage will cause a reduction in camber according to the effective prestress. Changes 
in lpt2 have no influence on flexural stiffness when calculating deflections due to live loads, 
but would nevertheless result in greater long-term positive deflections due to reduced visco￾elastic negative camber.
The results of shear tests carried out on 305, 407 and 508 mm depth prestressed hcu with 
strand slippage of up to 2.9 mm by Palmer and Schultz (2011) are reviewed and discussed 
by Elliott and Jolly, Section 5.2.10.1 (Elliott and Jolly, 2013). Comparisons with BS EN 
1992-1-1 are mostly unconservative, with only six out of 24 tests having Vu/VRd,c>1. Tests 
with the largest slippage (UMN A 16) have a mean Vu/VRd,c≈0.75. However, comparisons 
with Yang, on which Eq. 10.12 is based, are all conservative, with Vobs/VEC2 =1.0 to 2.0. The 
results indicate that whilst BS EN 1992-1-1 is largely unconservative for deep units, Yang’s 
approach has tipped the balance too far.
10.6 TORSION IN BEAMS AND SLABS
10.6.1 Equilibrium and compatibility torsion
Torsion, or a twisting bending moment, is best visualised by twisting a cardboard Smartie 
tube and observing the separation of the joints in the spiral. Pure torsion, without the pres￾ence of prestress, shear or bending actions, induces a spiral of tensile stresses τt
 at 45° to the 
longitudinal axis. To maintain equilibrium, compressive struts develop perpendicular to the 
tensile stress leading to maximum shear stresses τt
 in outside of webs and flanges of slabs or 
beams, as shown in the truss analogy in Figure 10.33. In the presence of shear stress v, the 
total vertical shear stress is the sum of τ=τt+v. When τ or τt>fctm, torsion cracking occurs as 
shown in the top of a prestressed hcu in Figure 10.34. In this photograph, the crack spiralled 
around the sides of the hcu but was arrested by the compressive prestress in the bottom of 
the hcu, therefore resulting in just one crack rather than a series of spiral cracks. This is 
known as ‘equilibrium’ torsion – the internal resistance of individual elements in which the 
cracking TRd,c and ultimate TRd,max torsional moments of resistance are calculated against 
the ultimate design torque TEd. Equilibrium torsion is the result of eccentric forces acting 
on slabs and beams, for example due to edge balconies connected by steelwork brackets to 
the sides of solid prestressed units (not hcu), as shown in Figure 10.35, or a secondary beam 
connected to the side of a primary beam as shown in Figure 10.36. Torsion may also be 
due to unequal floor loads acting on psc inverted-tee beams, for example where a long hcu 
is bearing on one side of the beam, but is spanning parallel to the beam on the other side. 336 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Gilbert et al. (2017) gave extensive account of both types of torsion and the truss analogy 
used for equilibrium torsion.
This section deals only with equilibrium torsion, i.e. the calculation of TEd from eccentric 
slab or beam loads, the resistances TRd,c and ultimate TRd,max. Where structural elements, 
such as edge beams and floor slabs, are connected to each other, and the stability of the 
frame is provided by the torsional stiffness and strength of the connection between the 
two elements, this is known as ‘compatibility’ torsion. This form of torsion is required to

maintain compatibility of deformations between elements in the frame and is dealt with by 
Elliott and Jolly, Section 4.3.6 (Elliott and Jolly, 2013) for the particular case of the compat￾ibility between L-shape edge beams and hcu. The applied pure torque at cracking was 30 
kNm, which, using the sand-heap theory, gave a torsional stress in the boot of the beam of 
1.8 N/mm2. Calculating the same stress according to BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 6.26 (see Eq. 
10.39 later) gave τt,i=2.1 N/mm2, about 0.6 fctm for the test beam. Based on the results of 
Figure 10.36 Secondary beam attached to the side of a primary beam causes torsion, shear and bending in the

these limited tests, torsional cracking occurs at a stress lower than the mean axial tensile 
strength. At this point it is worth noting that the inclination of the torsion cracks in the 
tests was close to 45°, such that cot θ≈1. BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.3.2 (2) assumes the same 
value for θ for torsion as well as shear, and it is more than likely that in most beams, with 
the exception of I beams with narrow webs, for shear cot θ will be in the region of 2.0–2.5. 
This means that the subsequent equations for torsional reinforcement will be conservative 
as cot θ=2.5 will be applied to the effects of torsion.
10.6.2 Torsional stress
The torsional stiffness of a psc element is based on elastic theory up to the cracking moment 
of resistance, TRd,c. The reinforcement is ignored. Torsion produces diagonal compressive 
struts between inclined ties – the equilibrium between compressive struts and the longitudi￾nal and transverse ties is shown in the truss analogy in Figure 10.37a. The maximum com￾pressive stress is assumed to be located close to the outer surface of the element. According 
to BS EN 1992-1-1, clauses 6.3.1 (3) and 6.3.2 (1) the torsional resistance of solid section 
may be modelled and calculated on the basis of a thin-walled closed section in which equi￾librium is satisfied by closed shear flow as shown in BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 6.11, and sim￾plified in Figure 10.37b. It is well known that the shear stress τ in a prismatic thin-walled 
section subjected to a pure torsional moment T is given as

where VEd,i=design ultimate shear in the wall i

Equating Eqs. 10.39 and 10.40 gives the shear force in each of the walls as
VEd,i=TEd zi
/2 Ak (10.41)
For example in a rectangular beam b=400 mm×h=600 mm, with main bars axis dis￾tance=50 mm, and subject to TEd =50 kNm, tef=240000/2000=120 mm>2×50=100 mm. 
Ak =280×480=134400 mm2. z=600−2×50=500 mm. In the vertical walls VEd,i=50×106 ×500/
(2×134400×103)=93.0 kN.
Gilbert et al. (2017) state that the test shows that prestress increases the torsional stiff￾ness significantly by delaying the onset of torsional cracking, but does not greatly affect 
the strength. After cracking the contribution of the concrete to ultimate strength is only 
marginally increased by prestress, and the contribution of the stirrups is unchanged by pre￾stress. On the contrary, Kong and Evans (1987) claim that the torsional resistance of psc is 
significantly higher than for a corresponding reinforced element, but also that BS 8110, Part 
2 (BS 8110-2, 1985) recommends that the procedures used for reinforced concrete should 
be used for prestressed.
10.6.3 Design for torsion in prestressed beams
Torsion is considered for (i) temporary loads during construction, to cater for all floor slab 
dead load on one side of the beam, and (ii) floor and beam loads at the ultimate limit state. 
See Figure 10.38. BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.3.2 (2) states that the concrete section should 
be checked for torsional capacity combined with shear. Stresses due to bending moments 
are not explicitly mentioned, probably because they are small where the torsion and shear 
is greatest, and are also small close to the centroidal axis, but should be considered in 340 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
cantilevers and continuous beams where negative bending moments near to supports add 
tensile stress to the torsion stress in the top fibre. However, in most beams, the top of the 
beam is cast monolithic with the floor slab where the torsion is virtually eliminated, but 
there may be exceptions.
The design ultimate torsional moment, known as ‘torque’ TEd is the greater of BS EN 
1990, Exp. 6.10a or 6.10b as {1.35 TG +1.5 ψ0 TQ; 1.25 TG +1.5 TQ} where TG and TQ is the 
service torque due to dead and live loads, respectively. Note that at the construction stage 
TEd,0 =1.35 TG only (Figure 10.38a).
The service torque considers the imbalanced ultimate reactions Pmax and Pmin from floor 
slabs, or from otherwise eccentric loads, on either side of the beam, as shown in Figure 10.38b. 
At the construction stage (suffix 0) it may be possible that floor slabs are first positioned on 
one side of the beam only, in which
TEd,0 =Pmax,0 emax (10.42a)
or if the depth, span and self-weight of slabs on either side of the beam are different, then
TEd,0 =Pmax,0 emax −Pmin,0 emin (10.42b)
Fixing tolerances are allowed for by adding 15 mm to the eccentricity of Pmax,0, and sub￾tracting 15 mm from the eccentricity of Pmin,0. This is a notional allowance adopted by 
industry, but is in line with the deviations Δa2 plus Δa3 in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 10.9.5.2. 
For example, in the 600 mm width inverted-tee beam shown in cross section in Figure 6.10, 
supporting floor units with a nominal bearing length of 100 mm, the nominal eccentricity 
is enom =600/2−100/2=250 mm. After fixing allowances emax =265 mm and emin =235 mm. 
Given that the self-weight of the floor units one either side of the beam is, say 12 kN/m, and 
the shear span of the beam (from Example 10.6) at 370 mm from the centres of support is 
7.76 m, then TEd,0,max =1.35×12×0.265×7.76/2=16.66 kNm.

In service, with floor slabs present on both sides of the beam,
TEd =Pmax emax −Pmin emin (10.43)
Given that the service dead and live loads on one side of the beam are wG +wQ =18.67+20.0 
kN/m, and on the other side are wG =9.33 kN/m, and that ultimate load combination Exp. 
6.10b is critical, then Pmax =1.25×18.67+1.5×20=53.33 kN/m, and Pmin =11.67 kN. Then 
TEd =(53.33×0.265−11.67×0.235)×7.76/2=44.2 kNm.
The design shear force VEd is determined as per Example 10.6. based on the same shear span.
Torque for imposed dead and live loads may be small due to the connection of the slab 
(and topping) to the beam. Here the effective bearing shifts closer to the shear centre of the 
beam, and twisting of the beam is resisted by the horizontal diaphragm reaction in the slab. 
This is particularly found in edge beams.
The first step is to ensure that beams are torsionally under-reinforced, i.e. that the longi￾tudinal bars and stirrups reach their yield strength before the ultimate torsional strength is 
reached. The effects of torsion and shear may be superimposed, assuming the same angle 
of inclination of the compressive strut θ, with 1≤cot θ≤2.5. To avoid crushing the concrete 
struts, for a beam in combined torsion and shear, the following interaction ratio according 
to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.3.2 (4) is given as
Exp. 6.29 TEd/TRd,max+VEd/VRd,max ≤1.0 (10.44)
Exp. 6.30 TRd,max =2 v αcw fcd Ak tef/(cot θ+tan θ) (10.45)
Exp. 6.9 VRd,max =v αcw fcd bw 0.9d/(cot θ+tan θ) (see note below for I beams) (10.46)
6.2.2.6 v=0.6 (1−fck/250)
bw =width of web at centroidal axis or at the intersection of the boot and upstand if the 
centroidal axis is in the boot
d=effective depth to tension reinforcement
For prestressed concrete αcw =(1+σcpx/fcd) for σcpx/fcd ≤0.25, 1.25 for σcpx/fcd ≤0.5 and 2.5 
(1−σcpx/fcd) for σcpx/fcd ≤1.0.
BS EN 1992-1-1 clause 6.3.2 (4) does not specify where is σcp taken, but it is assumed to 
be at the mid-height of the section in the first inclined strut, i.e. at x=0.5 h cot θ. This point 
may lie within the transmission length such that σcpx =σcp lx/lpt2 (see Eq. 10.2). The concrete 
design strength is fcd =fck/1.5.
If Eq. 10.44 is violated, the cross section of the member must be increased – adding more 
stirrups etc. is not the solution.
10.6.4 Proportion of torque per sub-section
In flanged, T, I or inverted tee beams the total torsional moment is proportioned into each of 
the component rectangles (sub-sections) of the cross section according to the compatibility 
of the angle of twist θ at the intersection of flanges/boot and webs. The full derivation is 
given by Kong and Evans, Section 6.8 (Kong and Evans, 1987). As the angle of twist θ at all 
intersections is equal, and θ is given by the general equation
θ=T/G K (10.47)342 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
where K is known as St. Venant’s torsional constant, and has the values given in Table 10.2.
G=shear modulus for concrete=Ecm/(1+2ν)
ν=Poisson’s ratio taken as 0.2 (BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 3.1.3 (4))
the proportion of T in each sub-section is proportional to K. This is defined in BS EN 
1992-1-1, clause 6.3.1 (4) where the ultimate torque TEd is proportioned according to the 
uncracked torsional stiffness K of each sub-section. This is based on an elastic analysis, and 
therefore K is
K=k h b3 where h≥b (10.48)
where k=torsional constant for rectangular areas
Thus, for sub-section i, TEdi=TEd (k h b3)i
/Σ k h b3 (10.49)
Triangular sections are simplified into rectangles of mean depth, e.g. 150 mm depth bot￾tom flange plus 50 mm sloping flange, equates to 175 mm. Different depths of upstands 
and boot depths are averaged. Sub-sections are idealised where Σk h b3 is a maximum, 
generally achieved if the widest rectangle is made as deep as possible. Inverted-tee beams 
are obviously divided into the upstand and boot, and I beams into top and bottom flanges 
and the web.
The torsional constant k for rectangular areas can be obtained by curve-fitting numerical 
data from Table 10.2 by Hearn (Hearn, 1977).
For h/b≤6, k=−0.0002(h/b)4 +0.0047(h/b)3 −0.0438(h/b)2 +0.1824(h/b) +0.0023
For h/b>6, k=0.28+0.0035(h/b)
e.g. for h/b=2, k=0.226 (but is actually 0.229 directly from the table).
The proportioning of TEd into the upstand and boot of the inverted-tee beam in Figure 
6.10 (excluding the 50×50 mm chamfers at the bottom corners) is as follows:
Boot width=600 mm×depth 400 mm. Maximum side h=600 mm and minimum side 
b=400 mm (note that the notation for width and depth have been reversed. Then h/b=1.5 
and k=0.196. Then K=k h b3 =0.196×600×4003 =7526.4×106 mm4. Similarly in the 
upstand h/b=1.75 and k=0.214. K=0.196×350×2003 =599.2×106 mm4. The proportion of 
TEd into the boot of the beam is therefore 7526.4/(7526.4+599.2)=0.926.
The fully plastic torque resisted by each section is given by Kong and Evans, Section 6.8 
(Kong and Evans, 1987) as TEdi=TEd (h b2)i
/Σh b2. In the case of the inverted-tee beam, the 
proportion of TEd into the boot is now 96.0/(96.0+14.0)=0.873. Although this is ignored in 
design, it suggests some redistribution of torque away from the boot after cracking.

For I beams the term VEd/VRd,max is for the full depth and width of the web. VEd in the 
top and bottom flanges is based on the summation of the horizontal shear stress τ×area 
of flange as VEd,fl =0.67 (VEd A yʹ/Ixx bf) bf
 hfl, where 0.67 is the average stress in parabolic 
distribution, A=bhf
, y’=distance from centroid to centre of area A, and Ixx =second moment 
of area.
For the bottom flange 0.67 / 2 / , 2 V V Ed fl = − Edb hf fl b ( ) y hfl I. VRd,fl,max =v αcw fcd bfl 0.9 (hfl −50 
mm)/(cot θ+tan θ). Note that both VEd,fl and VRd,fl,max are based on the full width bf
 and so 
the ratio VEd,fl/VRd,max,fl is not affected. If the flanges are shallow relative to the depth of the 
beam, e.g. say 1/5th, it is unlikely compressive struts will develop in the presence of deep 
webs.
10.6.5 Torsion reinforcement
Torsion causes deformation in two directions – perpendicular and parallel with the beam as 
shown in Figure 10.37a. Therefore, torsional reinforcement is required, simultaneously in 
both directions in the form of vertical stirrups and longitudinal bars, which are calculated 
separately. BS EN 1992-1-1 is vague in this as clause 6.3.2 (5) only refers to the minimum 
reinforcement in clause 9.2.1.1 for longitudinal reinforcement, and not the minimum shear 
links (which is in clause 9.2.3). However, it may be implied that if designed longitudinal bars 
are required, then so too are designed stirrups as torsion cracks cut across both sets of bars. 
The traditional approach has been to provide torsion stirrups when the minimum concrete 
torsion strength, typically 0.4 N/mm2, is exceeded.
BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.3.2 does not specify at what magnitude of TEd designed torsion 
stirrups are required and does not provide an expression for the area of stirrups, although 
this may be derived later. However, clause 9.2.3 (1) shows examples of shapes of closed tor￾sional links and clause 9.2.3 (2) states that Exp. 9.5N for minimum shear links is generally 
sufficient to provide minimum torsion links, see Eq. 10.27.

10.6.5.1 Additional longitudinal bars due to torsion
BS EN 1992-1-1 is vague in this respect, as clause 6.3.2 (5) states that for ‘approximately 
rectangular solid sections’ only minimum reinforcement is required according to clause 
9.2.1.1, i.e. longitudinal tension reinforcement As,min =max{0.26 fctm bt
 d/fyk; 0.0013 bt
 d), 
provided that the interaction formula satisfies
TEd/TRd,c+VEd/VRd,c≤1.0 (10.50)
where TEd and VEd are the design ultimate torque and shear force at a section
TRd,c is the torsional cracking moment of resistance from Eq. 10.39 letting τti=fctd.
Then TRd,c=2 Ak tef fctd (10.51)
Eq. 10.50 should be used with care and consideration because, if the ratio VEd/VRd,c is 
close to 1.0, or even VEd/VRd,c>1.0 such that shear stirrups are provided, a small amount of 
torsion will violate Eq. 10.50 and additional longitudinal bars (and closed torsion stirrups 
(Section 10.6.5.2)) are immediately required.
Gilbert et al. (2017) include the beneficial effect of prestress to replace fctd with fctd √(1+10 
σcp/fck), where is the average prestress over the beam or sub-section. Gilbert also replaces 2 
Ak tef with the torsional constant J=0.33 b2 h (where b<h) for solid sections.
Then TRd,c=J fctd √(1+10 σcp/fck) (10.52)
Figure 10 does not multiply σcp tenfold, but derives from the denominator actually being 
the tensile strength of concrete, approximately fck/10. The result of this will be tested in 
Example 10.9.
The clause states that ‘VRd,c follows from Expression 6.2’, i.e. the flexurally cracked shear 
capacity VRd,cr (Eq. 10.7 or 10.10). However, in a psc beam where TEd is calculated near to 
the support the critical shear capacity is VRd,c (Eq. 10.1). Therefore, the calculation for tor￾sion should also be made where VRd,cr is critical, typically at about ¼ to ⅓ span (or not at 
all in some designs) where the torque will be about ½ the value at the supports (for UDL).
The clause does not elaborate on what an ‘approximately rectangular solid section’ is, viz. 
is the boot of the inverted-tee beam in Figure 6.10 so dominant in the total cross section that 
behaves as a rectangular section, or if the component parts of this beam qualify as rectan￾gular sections? The authors consider this to be the case, but it would not apply to I beams 
with tapered or curved top and bottom flanges.
The clause does not explain how TEd,i and TRd,c,i in the sub-sections of beams such as inverted￾tee or I beams are apportioned, as this clause is only intended for rectangular sections where this 
does not apply. The obvious approach is to proportion both TEd,i and TRd,c,i in each sub-section. 
The same logic applies to VEd,i and VRd,c,i in each sub-section, in order to be able to combine 
the terms in Eq. 10.50. Proportioning VEd into the upstand (up) and boot of an inverted-tee 
beam requires the shear stress in the upstand to be calculated from τup =VEd S/Ixx bw, and thus 
VEd,up =0.67 τup bw hup. For example, in the inverted-tee beam in Figure 6.10 and Example 10.6 
is subject to VEd =347.5 kN, with Ixx bw/S=177040 mm2, then τup =347.5×103/177040=1.96 N/
mm2, and VEd,up =0.67×1.96×350×200×10−3 =91.6 kN. The remainder of the shear force car￾ried by the boot is VEd,boot=347.5−91.6=255.9 kN. Although this calculation will not influence 
the designed area of torsion stirrups nor longitudinal bars (as they are both a function of TEd,i) it 
may tip the requirement for minimum rather than designed reinforcements.
The requirements for longitudinal reinforcement Asl due to torsion (additional to the flex￾ural requirement of top and bottom tendons) are given in clause 6.3.2 (3) as
Exp. 6.28 Asl=TEd uk cot θ/2 Ak 0.87 fyk (10.53)Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 345
where cot θ is the same as in the shear calculations at the same cross section in the span.
As the area Asl is based on the strength of rebars (fyk = 500 N/mm2), if the reinforcement 
is to use some of the spare capacity of the pretensioning tendons (fpk = 1770 N/mm2) near 
to the support their effective area is Asl × 500/1770. If rebars are used the area is of course 
Asl.
The bars should be arranged so that there is at least one bar in each corner of each 
sub-section, with the remainder spread around the inner perimeter of the links, with spac￾ing≤350 mm (see clause 9.2.3 (4)). The minimum number of bars is 4 (one in each corner). If 
the dimension of the sub-section is greater than 450 mm (i.e. 350+2×50 edge axis distance), 
then 1 no. extra bar is required in each mid-side. If greater than 800 mm (2×350+2×50) 
then 2 no. extra bars are required in each mid-side.
In compression zones, the bars may be reduced in proportion to the available compressive 
force. If the ultimate bending moment is MEd at the point where TEd is calculated, i.e. 0.5 d
cot θ from the support, and the lever arm z between the compression zone and bottom bars 
is known, the compressive force Fc=MEd/z may be used to reduce the area of top bars in Asl. 
(See Example 10.9).
In tension zones, the bars should be added to, or replace the spare capacity of, other flex￾ural reinforcement. Gilbert’s approach (Gilbert et al., 2017, Example 7.2) is to determine Fc
in the compressive zone above the neutral axis and to calculate Asl in the bottom bars based 
on the remainder of the axial force in the tension zone. Alternatively, the stress in the preten￾sioned tendons around the torsional perimeter is small near to the supports and their spare 
capacity may be used to contribute to Asl. Note that the tendons are already pretensioned 
to σp0, typically to about 60% of 0.87 fpk, such that their remaining capacity is about 40%.
10.6.5.2 Additional stirrups due to torsion
Although BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.3.2 does not specify at what magnitude of TEd torsion 
stirrups are required, it is implied from clause 6.3.2 (5) that they are required when Eq. 
10.50 is violated. Note that the calculated area of a torsion link is for one leg only.
The equation for area of links is not given in BS EN 1992-1-1, but may be derived from 
Eqs. 10.39, 10.40 and 10.20 as
τt,i=VEd,i/tef,i zi =TEd/2 Ak tef,i
Then VEd,=TEd tef, z/2 Ak tef, =TEd z/2 Ak
Eq. 10.20 Asw/s≥VEd/z 0.87 fywk cot θ
Then Asw/s≥TEd/2 Ak 0.87 fywk cot θ (10.54)
Generally, the diameter and area of the stirrup is decided upon, and so the spacing is
s=Asw (1 leg) 2 Ak 0.87 fywk cot θ/TEd (10.55)
cot θ is the same as in shear design
9.2.3 (3) s≤min{u/8, b*; 0.75d} *the lesser dimension of the section
The shape of the closed links is shown in BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 9.6. The minimum diameter 
is the same as for shear links. If shear requirements are small, and torsion requirements are 
large, then the diameter of torsion links may be increased with greater spacing to give the 
same Asw/s.346 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Example 10.9
Calculate the torsional strength TRd,c and the requirements for torsion stirrups and addi￾tional longitudinal reinforcement for the inverted-tee beam in Example 10.6. Let the 
maximum ultimate torque at the end of the beam TEd =50 kNm and VEd =347.5 (Example 
10.6) kN. The edge distance to the centre of the strands is 50 mm.
Solution
Material properties
fcd =45/1.5=30 N/mm2
v=0.6 (1−45/250)=0.492
fctd =0.7×0.3×452/3/1.5=1.77 N/mm2
fyd =500/1.15=435 N/mm2
The proportioning of TEd into the upstand and boot is given in Section 10.6.4, respec￾tively, as
TEd,up =0.074×50=3.70 kNm
TEd,boot=0.926×50=46.30 kNm
Dimensions and effective torsional section properties for the boot are: b (lesser dimen￾sion)=400 mm, h=600 mm, A=240000 mm2, u=2000 mm, tef=max{120; 2×50}=120 
mm, Ak =(400−120)×(600−120)=134400 mm2, and uk =2×(280+480)=1520 mm.
Eq. 10.51 TRd,c=2×134400×120×1.77×10−6 =57.13 kNm
Using the equations per Gilbert et al. taking advantage of the prestress in the boot
Eq. 10.52 TRd,c=(0.33×4002 ×600)×1.77×√(1+10×4.34/45)×10−6 =78.63 kNm is 
38% greater than Eq. 10.51.
where σcp in the boot=0.579×(6.746/0.9)=4.34 N/mm2 (from Example 10.6)
From Examples 10.6 and 10.7 by inspection cot θ=2.5, then cot θ+tan θ=2.5+1/2.5=2.9
Eq. 10.45 TRd,max =2×0.492×1.14×30×134400×120×10−6/2.9=187.9 kNm
where αcw =1+(4.34/30)=1.14
VEd =255.9 kN (proportioned into the boot in Section 10.6.5.1)
VRd,c=731.3 kN (from Example 10.6)
Eq. 10.46 VRd,max =1.14×600×(0.9×480.8)×0.492×30×10−3/2.9=1512.3 kN
Eq. 10.50 TEd/TRd,c + VEd/VRd,c = 46.30/57.13 + 255.9/731.3 = 0.810 + 0.350 = 1.160 > 1, 
then torsion stirrups and additional longitudinal bars are required.
Using TRd,c calculated from Eq. 10.52 after Gilbert et al., TEd/TRd,c+VEd/VRd,c=46.30/
78.63+0.350=0.94<1, then no torsion links are required, with clear scope for discussion.
Eq. 10.44 TEd/TRd,max +VEd/VRd,max =46.30/187.9+255.9/1512.3=0.246+0.169=0.415
<1, therefore the concrete section is adequate.
Corresponding values for the upstand are
Eq. 10.50 TEd/TRd,c+VEd/VRd,c=3.70/8.86+91.6/498.8=0.418+0.184=0.602<1Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 347
It is unlikely for the upstand to fail independently from the boot. Torsion stirrups are not 
required, but the same area and spacing of stirrups used in the boot will be provided for 
the continuity of strength.
Eq. 10.44 TEd/TRd,max +VEd/VRd,max =3.70/28.00+91.6/848.2=0.132+0.108=0.240<1.
Torsion stirrups in the boot.
Choose H10 stirrups (to match the shear stirrups in Example 10.7) with Asw =78.5 
mm2 per leg.
Eq. 10.55 s=78.5×2×134400×435×2.5/46.30×106 =496 mm
Minimum spacing per clause 9.2.3 (3). s≤min{2000/8, 400, 0.75×480.8}=250 mm. Use 
H10 closed stirrups at 250 mm spacing, detailed according to BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 9.6.
Additional longitudinal reinforcement.
Eq. 10.53 Asl=46.30×106 ×1520×2.5/(2×134400×435)=1505 mm2
This is clearly a conservative calculation as the angle of the compressive struts for torsion 
will be closer to cot θ=1.
The equivalent area of strands is 1505×500/1770=425 mm2
If, for example, 10 bars are notionally placed around the perimeter of the beam - two in 
each bottom corner, two in the top of the boot, two in the upstand, and two in the mid￾width of the bottom (see Figure 6.10), the area required per strand is 42 mm2. The area of 
a 12.5 mm strand is 93 mm2. However, the strands are already prestressed to σpo =953.3 
N/mm2 (Example 7.10), which is 953.3/0.87×1770=62% of available capacity, leaving 
38% of the area spare for the torsional requirement=0.38×93=35 mm2. Although this is 
less than 42 mm2 required it is acceptable, given the assumption above and the complex￾ity of the calculation.
Further analysis of the beam is required to find the distance from the support where 
Eq. 10.50 is violated, which is 960 mm from the centre of the support. Therefore, 5 no. 
torsion stirrups at 250 mm spacing are required, with the first stirrup at 50 mm from the 
end of the beam. Beyond these, use minimum links H10 at 360 mm spacing.
10.6.6 Design for torsion in prestressed hollow core units
10.6.6.1 Torsion cracking in hollow core units
Torsion cracks may occur at the corners of hcu, typically at 45° in plan view from a point 
about ⅓ of the width of the unit, and where the unit is supported along its longitudinal edge, 
or in floors with large openings, skew or uneven floor supports, etc. Figure 10.34 shows a 
torsion crack due to unequal level bearings. Equilibrium torsion may also be induced due to 
eccentric loads from trimmer angles at voids or linear line loads or point loads acting at the 
edges of the units which cannot be transversely distributed into the slab field because of the 
presence of large voids in the floor as shown in Figure 10.40. TEd is due to the eccentric load 
of the trimmer angles and the walls surrounding the void.
The torsional resistance may be calculated using an idealised cross section comprising of 
the upper and lower flanges and the outermost webs of the units, as shown in Figure 10.41. 
An extensive research program and carried out at VTT in Finland, known as ‘Holcotors’ 
(European Commission, 2004), found that for hcu of less than 250 mm depth that the two 
outermost webs contribute to the resistance; otherwise, it is one outermost web. Figures 10.42 
and 10.43 show an individual hcu subjected to two point loads at opposite corners of a hcu 
producing pure torsion, and five hcu placed in a floor system subject to point loads that would 
otherwise be used to calculate torsion in an individual unit. Ludgren et al. (Lundgren et al., 348 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
2004) summarised the project and concluded that ‘hollow core units can carry higher amounts 
of the shear and torsion when placed in a floor system, and not only due to the transfer to the 
neighbouring elements … the boundaries with adjacent units seem to yield a more favourable 
stress state, or better possibilities for redistribution within the unit.’ Finite element modeling 
found that shear-torsion interaction follows the circular plots shown in Figure 10.44 (for the 
units shown in Figure 10.45), rather than the linear interaction according to BS EN 1168, 
clause 4.3.3.2.2.4. See Section 10.6.6.5.

is constant and the largest shear stress is in the wall with minimum thickness. For hcu, the 
torsional stiffness and resistance is very similar to a tubular thin-walled box section as ide￾alised in Figure 10.41. Referring to this diagram Wt
 may be calculated as
Wt=2 [h−0.5 (ht+hb)] (by−bw,o) t (10.57)
where t is the thickness of the thin-walled part for which the shear stress is calculated, i.e. 
for the web t=bw,o.
ht
 and hb are the depth of the top and bottom flanges
by=total width at centroidal axis, typically 1150–1160 mm
bw,o =width of the outermost web
For different thin-walled parts, the resistance due to torsion is based on
Wt,top =Wt(ht
) (10.58a)
Wt ,web=Wt(bw,o) (10.58b)
Wt ,bottom =Wt(hb) (10.58c)
For hollow core cross sections wall thickness should be limited by
bw,o≤0.265 h when using Wt,web
hf≤0.175 h when using WT, top or WT,bottom
For hcu subjected to torsion and normal stresses due to prestressing and imposed loading, 
the torsional moment of resistance TRd,c is found when the principal stress reaches the con￾crete design tensile strength fctd. The principal stress for the top flange, where the axial stress 
due to prestress σct is the least, and likely to be in tension, can be expressed as (Mohr’s circle 
approach)
= σ + √ ( ) σ +  
 ct / 2 ct / 2 2 2 f t ctm t (10.59)
where σct is the axial concrete tensile stress (positive) in the top flange due to prestress and 
flexural stress due to bending moments at the end of the transmission length.
Re-arranging Eq. 10.59 gives the shear stress in the top flange τt,top
τt,top =fctm √[1−(σct/fctm)] (10.60)
The torsional moment of resistance TRd,c is calculated as
TRd,c,top =Wt,top fctd √[1−(σct/fctd)] (10.61)
Example 10.10
Calculate the ultimate torsion moment of resistance TRd,c for the webs and flanges in the 
250 mm depth hcu shown in cross section in Figure 6.7, and material and section properties 
from Examples 7.1 and 10.1. The width at the centroidal axis by may be taken as 1154 mm.
Solution
Width of external web bw,o =51 mm, by−bw,o =1154−51=1103 mm352 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Note that bw,o =(51/250) h=0.204 h<0.265 h, and only the outermost webs are used 
in this example.
Depth of flanges ht=40 mm and hb =35 mm. h−0.5 (ht+hb)=250−0.5×75=212.5 mm
Eq. 10.58a Wt,web =2×212.5×1103×51=23.91×106 mm3
Eq. 10.58b Wt,top =2×212.5×1103×40=18.75×106 mm3
Eq. 10.58c Wt,bottom =2×212.5×1103×35=16.41×106 mm3
At the end of the transmission length and after losses of prestress from Example 7.1 
σc,t=1.95 N/mm2 (tension)
The stress due to the self-weight in the top of the hcu at the end of the transmission 
length lpt2 from the centre of bearing is required. This is at x=726−100/2=676 mm. 
Then Ms,x =4.12×9.8×0.676/2−4.12×0.6762/2=12.7 kNm. Zt,co =10.056×106 mm3. 
σt,x =12.7/10.056=1.26 N/mm2 (compression). Calculating the stress due to self-weight 
gives the minimum value for TRd,c.
σc,t=1.95−1.26=0.69 N/mm2
fctd =1.77 N/mm2
Eq. 10.60 τt,top ≤1.77×√(1−0.69/1.77)=1.38 N/mm2
Eq. 10.61 TRd,c,top =18.75×1.38=25.9 kNm
In the webs, σc,t at the height of the centroid of the hcu is -5.12 N/mm2 (compression), and 
the stress due to self-weight is zero. Then τt,web ≤1.77×√(1 – 5.12/1.77)=3.49 N/mm2 and 
TRd,c,web =23.91×3.49=83.4 kNm, clearly not critical. Even adding the shear stress due to 
vertical self-weight shear, v=0.36 N/mm2 will not change the outcome.
10.6.6.3 Comparison of torsion moment of resistance with Holcotors
The following compares the calculated values of TRd,c using the above procedures with 
the results from the pure torsion tests in the Holcotors project for 200 mm and 400 mm 
depth hcu shown in Figures 10.43–10.45. The test results were reported by Pajari at VTT in 
Finland (Pajari, 2003). Table 10.3 gives the theoretical prediction of the torsional cracking 
stresses and moment using Eqs. 10.59–10.61, but with fctd replaced by the measured tensile 
strength fct, and the actual material properties and measured dimensions from the tests. The 
ratio of the predicted TRd to the experimental torsion moment Tu in the tests 0.86 and 0.97 
for the 200 and 400 mm depth units, respectively.
Although there are several assumptions in the calculations in Table 10.3, such as the 
losses in pretensioning force at the time of the test, assumed as 6 weeks after transfer, is 
15%, the critical parameter in the calculations is the tensile strength fct in the top flange. If 
this varies by more than ±5%, the agreement with Tu changes by about 7 percentage points 
(i.e. the ratio 0.97 changes to 1.05 and 0.90), but is still within acceptable limits.
10.6.6.4 Shear and torsion interaction
Torsion loading on a hcu produces shear forces around the perimeter of the cross section, 
as shown in Figure 10.46. In units of greater depth with fewer cores, e.g. 400 mm with 4 
cores, torsional shear stress exists also in the first interior web, as illustrated in Figure 10.46, 
the magnitude dependent on depth. These shear forces act upwards in one and downwards Ultimate shear strength and torsion, and transmission length 353
in the other of the outermost webs of the unit. The calculation method given in Section 
10.6.6.2 assumes a theoretical addition of torsion and shear stress in the webs. In reality, 
there will be a redistribution of the stresses over the whole section due to deformations and 
compatibility within the units, the softening behaviour of cracked concrete, and possible 
restraints at the boundaries of the units.
The forthcoming FIB Manual on prestressed hcu establishes the shear and torsion inter￾action relationship based on the results of the ‘Holcotors’ project (European Commission, 
2004) using finite element analysis with nonlinear material properties. The manual also 
gives a simplified method to establish the interaction diagram using some key values for 
shear force and torsion moment alone.
10.6.6.5 Shear-torsion interaction formula according to BS EN 1168
BS EN 1168, clause 4.3.3.2.2.4 and Fig. 4 (adapted here in Figure 10.47) gives a calculation 
method taking into account the interaction between shear and torsion to determine the net 
shear capacity of hcu. Essentially, the net shear capacity VRd,n after the shear force VEd,t due 
to the torsional shear flow in the webs is subtracted and is determined as follows. Generally, 
from Eq. 10.41, VEd,i=TEd z/2 Ak. The shear force in the outer webs VEd,out of width bw,o is
VEd,out=TEd z/2 Ak
But in the vertical webs z=h−0.5 (hf+hfb)

width of webs is 302 mm. The overall width at the centroidal axis may be taken as 1154 
mm.
Solution
Eq. 10.63 VEd,t=10×106 ×302×10−3/[102×(1154−51)]=26.9 kN
(This may be conservative as more than the outside webs are contributing to TRd)
Example 10.1. VRd,c=134.3 kN
Eq. 10.64 VRd,n =134.3−26.9=107.4 kN
Check the result using Eqs. 10.56 and 10.58 and data in Examples 10.1 and 10.10
Eq. 10.58a Wt,web =23.91×106 mm3 (from Example 10.10)
Eq. 10.56 τt=10.0/23.91=0.42 N/mm2
Shear stress in webs (from Example 10.1) τv=VRdn S/Ixx bw =107.4×103 ×6.783×106/
(1270×106 ×302)=1.90 N/mm2
Total stress in webs=0.42+1.90=2.32 N/mm2
Maximum principal stress in concrete (from Example 10.1) is √(1.772 +0.307×4.61×
1.77)=2.37 N/mm2
The discrepancy derives because Wt,web is calculated for the outside web alone, 
whereas v is an average stress in all webs. If Wt,web is recalculated for the average width 
of the webs, 43.1 mm, then τt=0.42×51/43.1=0.49 N/mm2 and the total stress in 
webs=0.49+1.90=2.39 N/mm2 ≈2.37 N/mm2.

11.1 DEFLECTIONS IN PRESTRESSED 
CONCRETE SLABS AND BEAMS
11.1.1 Background to deflection calculations 
in prestressed concrete
Previous UK Codes of Practice, such as CP 110 (CP 110, 1972), BS 8110 Part 1 
(BS 8110-1, 1997) and BS 8110 Part 2 (BS 8110-2, 1985), had a rather casual approach 
to the calculation of deflections in prestressed concrete (psc) elements, such as ‘where it 
is considered necessary to calculate deflections …’, and ‘the serviceability requirements 
for deflection are given … but no numerical limits are set’. This approach no doubt stems 
from the major influence of eccentric prestress causing upward camber which continues 
to increase due to the effects of creep, in fact historically the authors recall in-house limit 
for the final (long-term) downward deflection of simply supported prestressed slabs as 
span/1000. Long-term deflections have always been considered to be controlled by limit￾ing the serviceability tensile stress to fctm, or similar values such as 0.45√fcu in earlier codes. 
Elastic analysis based on the gross (or compound) concrete cross-section may be used for 
instantaneous and long-term deflections if the tensile stress is so limited.
BS EN 1992-1-1 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004) does not distinguish between reinforced con￾crete and psc, but states a Principle in clause 7.4.1 (1)P ‘The deformation of a member or 
structure shall not be such that it adversely affects its proper functioning or appearance.’ 
and the limits that have been traditionally set for reinforced concrete members, such as lim￾iting the final (long-term) deflection of span/250, are also applicable to prestressed concrete 
(psc). This is rarely critical in the vast majority of designs, apart from lightly loaded long 
span elements where self-weight and dead loads are greater than imposed live loads, where 
the tensile stress is limited to fctm. For example in the hollow core unit (hcu) shown in cross￾section in Figure 6.7 and subjected to the gravity loads in Example 7.1, with ψ2 =0.3, it will 
be shown later in this chapter that the final deflection is 9.2 mm<span/250=9800/250=3
9.2mm. For the deflection to exceed span/250, the span must be increased to 12.2m and 
the imposed live load decreased from 5.0 to 0.9 kN/m2, i.e. lightly loaded. If the durability 
exposure>XC1 and limiting tensile stress fctm =zero, it is impossible for the final deflection 
to be critical.
Calculations for the upward camber, instantaneous and long-term deflections are given in 
Section 11.2.2, together with the limits in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.4.1 (4) & (5). Figure 11.1 
shows an illustration of the imposed service bending moment vs mid-span deflection for a 
simply supported psc element. The deflections are linear until flexural cracking occurs, and 
thereafter a function of the uncracked and cracked flexural stiffness according to BS EN 
1992-1-1, clause 7.4.3 (3), see Section 11.2.4. Note that the ‘artificial jump’ in the long-term 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003319450-11358 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
deflections is due to a factor β=0.5 applied to the cracked stiffness in BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 
7.19 where Mk >Mcr. Of course if the tensile stress is limited to fctm the deflection is de facto
linear. Note that the characteristic service moment is denoted as Mk, rather than Ms, to 
distinguish it from flexural design. The service cracking moment is also denoted Mcr=Zb,co
(σb +fctm) to distinguish it from the cracking moment Mc used in ultimate shear design (see 
Section 10.2.3). The long-term value of Mcr is less, typically 10%, than the instantaneous 
value because of prestress losses.
Although there is no specified limit to upward camber, which has a major influence on 
the depth of level screeds near to supports, the industry standard is typically span/300, 
although this may vary by ±50% due to differences in curing and storage conditions, e.g. the 
camber of a hcu stored on top of a stack on a cold sunny day may be up to 25% greater than 
those beneath it. BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.4.1 (4) suggests a limit of span/250 for upward 
camber incorporated into formwork, which is not quite the same camber due to prestress, 
but may be adopted as a check.
11.1.2 Normalised moment vs deflections in bending 
tests of hollow core units and T beams
Figures 7.1 and 7.4 show plots of applied bending moments vs mid-span deflections for a 
range of psc hcu and T beams (in beam and block flooring), respectively, up to the bending 
moments at the occurrence of flexural cracking. Figures 9.3 and 9.5 show the same data, 
but up to the ultimate moment of resistance and beyond to the end of the tests at failure. 
These diagrams also show the moments of resistance for each hcu or T beam, but they do 
not show where the deflections exceed the usual limit of span/250 for psc units at the ser￾viceability limit state. Figures 11.2 and 11.3 show the same data, but these are normalised 
with respect to the mid-span deflection δ divided by the limiting deflection of the measured 
effective span/250. Similarly, these figures show the normalised mid-span bending moment 
M divided by the design service moment of resistance MsR for each hcu or T beam. Where 
the axis of the graphs cross at M/MsR =1.0 and δ/span/250=1.0 is effectively the criterion 
for design. Of course, the deflections do not include long-term creep, nor the proportion of 
δ due to self-weight, imposed dead and imposed quasi-permanent live loading – long-term

bending tests would be required for this – but (as shown in Section 11.2.2) given that the 
quasi-permanent factor ψ2 for residential and offices is 0.3, and the long-term creep coef￾ficient for imposed loading is ψ∞ =1.5–2.0, the effects of 1/ψ2 and (1+ψ∞) virtually cancel 
out. Therefore M/MsR vs δ/span/250 plots in Figures 11.2 and 11.3 give a reasonable indi￾cation of the behaviour relative to the design point. Note that the normalised plots are for 
span/depth of 5000/200=25.0 and 4400/150=29.3 for the hcu and T beams, respectively. 
Different span/depth ratios would inevitably lead to different results.
The important information in Figure 11.2 is that, in the first load cycle, at M/MsR =1.0 then 
δ/span/250=0.5–0.7, i.e. deflection would not be critical. It is interesting to note that for the 
same hcu (span, section properties, materials and pretensioning) subjected to the same load￾ing to give Ms=MsR, the mid-span deflection (excluding self-weight of hcu) for long-term 
office loading with ψ2 =0.3 is 12.1mm, i.e. δ/span/250=12.1/20=0.61, a result that lies 
in the centre of the experimental range. At the limiting deflection, where δ=span/250, the 
imposed bending moment in the tests exceeded MsR by between 1.25 and 1.40. Therefore a 
comparison with the design example cannot be made because the deflections after cracking 
were non-linear. The ductility factor of structural elements is the ratio of ultimate defor￾mation, in this case, mid-span deflections may be used, to the deformation at the limit of 
proportionality. In these tests, the ductility factor averaged 6.0.
The important information in Figure 11.3 is that, in the first load cycle, at M/MsR =1.0 
then δ/span/250=0.7–0.8. For the same T beams subjected to the same loading to give 
Ms=MsR, the mid-span deflection for long-term domestic loading with ψ2 =0.3 (excluding 
self-weight of beam) is 13.9mm, i.e. δ/span/250=13.9/17.6=0.79, a result that lies within 
the experimental range. At the limiting deflection, where δ=span/250, Ms exceeded MsR by 
between 1.18 and 1.20. In the design example, this ratio is 1.26, close to 1.20 because the 
deflections were just inside the linear range. In these tests, the ductility factor averaged 5.2.

The conclusion to the tests is that the normalised M/MsR and δ/span/250 plots are simi￾lar and consistent for both hcu and T beams, e.g. at δ/span/250=2.0 then M/MsR ≈1.6. 
Although limited in terms of their span/depth range, short-term loading gives a reasonably 
reliable prediction of the long-term behaviour, but only where the quasi-permanent factor 
is ψ2 =0.3 for the reasons explained above. These tests would not predict deflections for 
example for storage where ψ2 =0.8.
11.2 CALCULATION OF DEFLECTIONS
11.2.1 Deflections up to the cracking moment of resistance
Deflection calculations are always carried out for psc elements – it is not sufficient to check 
span-effective depth ratios as in a reinforced section. This is because the strength-to-stiff￾ness ratio of a psc section is considerably greater than in a reinforced section. The effects of 
tendon relaxation, creep, etc. have greater effects as the degree of prestress increases. The 
general method of curvature-area may be adopted in psc design. For non-deflected tendons 
the curvature diagram for prestress is rectangular. For debonded tendons, the curvature 
diagram comprises three rectangles, with a slope between them at the point of debonding, 
although the slope may be ignored and replaced by a step.
Net deflection is found by the superposition of upward cambers due to prestress and 
downward deflection due to gravity loads. In a cantilever the upward camber in the main 
span causes downward deflection in the cantilever span, see Figure 13.16a. To avoid this 
tendons may either be debonded or (less favourably) deflected to the top of the section.
Calculations are based on a flexurally uncracked stiffness Ecm Ic,co, using Ecm(t) at transfer 
for initial camber due to prestress and the final value Ecm and appropriate creep coefficients

for (i) long-term total deflections and (ii) deflections due to imposed dead and live loads after 
finishes are applied. In this book (ii) is hereby referred to as ‘movement’ to differentiate from 
total deflections. The compound value Ic,co may be used, although many designers ignore the 
transformed section and use Ic, making a difference of about 2%–3% compared to Ic.
Young’s modulus, called the ‘modulus of elasticity’, is according to BS EN 1992-1-1, 
Table 3.1, Ecm =22 [(fck +8) /10)]0.3 (kN/mm2) for gravel aggregates. This is reduced by 10% 
for limestone aggregates. The same equation may be used for the transfer strength. When 
considering the gain in the modulus of elasticity over time between the age at transfer (typi￾cally 16–20hours) and at installation, typically 28days, a factor may be used represent￾ing the approximate integration of Ecm over that period, i.e. Ecm(t)/[0.5 (Ecm(t)+Ecm)]. For 
example if fck =45 N/mm2 and fck(t)=30 N/mm2, using gravel aggregates Ecm =36.283 kN/
mm2 and Ecm(t)=32.837 kN/mm2. The factor is 32.837/34.56=0.950. This factor may be 
used to adjust the short-term creep coefficients when calculating deflections at installation.
Precamber deflection comprises of four parts
a. immediate upward camber (defined as negative) after detensioning (and cutting of 
machine formed solid or hcu slabs) due to the immediate prestressing force Ppm0 after 
the initial relaxation and elastic shortening of tendons
b. short-term value due to Ppmi after Ppm0 plus short-term creep losses
c. long-term value due to Ppo after all losses
d. self-weight deflection (downward, positive).
In-service long-term deflections are calculated in the usual manner taking into consideration 
the support conditions, loading arrangement and creep. Dead plus quasi-permanent live 
loads Gk +ψ2Qk are used. Final deflection, including upward camber, is limited according 
to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.4.1 (4) to effective span/250. Movement, or the deflection after 
finishes are applied, is limited to span/500 where masonry partitions and/or brittle finishes 
are to be applied, or span/350 for non-brittle finishes. Architects may also impose a limit of 
20mm where span/350 or span/500 limit for longer spans may lead to damage of finishes.
Deflections are determined for the immediate elastic deformation, plus the visco-elastic 
effects of creep, which is reflected in the changing values of pretension force and the modu￾lus of elasticity with time. The creep coefficients, with notation ψ, are obtained from the 
Italian Concrete Association ASSAP Manual (ASSAP, 2002) used in recent fib publications, 
and the Eurocode design guide by the Precast Concrete Federation (British Precast, 2008). 
Because the stress conditions in the top and bottom of the unit are different, the values 
for ψ determined for the effect of dead and imposed loads are not the same as the inter￾nal strain-related creep coefficients φ(t,t0) (long-term), φ(ti
,t0) (up to installation) and φ(t,ti
) 
(after installation) used for calculating losses in prestress (hence the different notation).
Long-term deformations are based on a single long-term creep coefficient ψ∞ =2.5 together 
with a concrete ageing coefficient, which allows for stress increments after initial loads, of 
Χ=0.8. Creep coefficients applied over an interval of time are determined by multiplying 
a ‘coefficient of development’ ψʹ by Χψ∞. Over time intervals from ti=1day (at transfer) to 
12months these are as follows (ASSAP, 2002)
Coefficient of development ψʹ at
transfer = 0.1 15days = 0.3
28days = 0.4 2months = 0.5
3months = 0.6 6months = 0.7
12months = 0.8 ∞ = 1.0362 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Intermediate values may be linearly interpolated up to 15days, e.g. for 7days 
ψʹ=0.0857+ti
/70=0.186, thereafter curve fitting the data gives ψʹ=0.1579 loge ti
 – 0.126.
For example the creep coefficient from transfer at 1day to installation at say 28days is 
ψ1 =(0.4−0.1)×2.5=0.75 multiplied by the factor Ecm(t)/[0.5 (Ecm(t)+Ecm)]. In the previous 
example ψ1 =0.75×0.950=0.713. From 28days to the long-term ψ28 =(1.0−0.4)×0.8×2.5=
1.20, and so on.
Short-term and long-term deflections, and deflections after the application of finishes 
(known here as ‘movement’ to distinguish from the aforementioned deflections) are calcu￾lated at different periods of time and situations. These are summarised in Table 11.1.
11.2.2 Calculation of deflections
Let L=effective span (assume this is the same as the actual length of an element for calculat￾ing camber at transfer), Ppm0 =prestressing force at transfer, Ppmi=prestressing force at instal￾lation, Ppo =final prestressing force, zcp =eccentricity, Ecm and Ecm(t)=modulus of elasticity 
at 28days and at transfer, Ic,co =second moment of area of compound section, ψ1 =creep 
coefficient from transfer to installation, ψ28 =creep coefficient from installation (assume 
28days) to long-term, and ψ∞ =creep coefficient at long-term, w0, w1, w2 and w3 =uniformly 
distributed loads due to self-weight of unit, self-weight of slab after grouting (or self-weight 
on infill blocks and infill concrete (for T beams), dead loads and imposed live loads, respec￾tively, ψ2 =quasi-permanent live load factor.
The general term for the upward camber (often called ‘pre-camber’) at the mid-length 
(taken as mid-span for convenience) of an element is δ=−P zcp L2/8 EI, where P and E are the 
prevailing pretensioning forces and modulus of elasticity where the camber is to be calcu￾lated. The general term for downward deflection due to uniformly distributed gravity loads 
at the mid-span is δ=5w L4/384 EI, where w is the prevailing load.

d. Long-term deflection, or movement, after installation of finishes
Long-term movement due to visco-elastic self-weight and dead load deflections 
after finishes are applied is due to the post-installation creep coefficient ψ28, static and 
visco-elastic live load deflections due to 1+ψ28 (not 1+0.8ψ∞), and changes in camber 
after installation. It appears from some experimental data on composite hollow core 
slabs (Elliott and Ibrahim, 2006, Ibrahim and Elliott, 2009) that changes in deflection 
due to imposed loads applied after about 28days are closer to the effect of 1+ψ28 than 
1+0.8ψ∞. Movement is the greater of δ13 or δ14

Example 11.1
Calculate the long-term deflection and the deflection after applying finishes for the 
250mm depth prestressed hcu shown in cross-section in Figure 6.7 and designed for 
serviceability in Example 7.1. The slab is subjected to imposed dead and live loads of 
3.80 and 5.0 kN/m2, respectively over a simply supported span of L=9.80m. The self￾weight of the precast unit alone is 4.12 kN/m run. After the joints are grouted on site the 
self-weight of the precast floor is 3.63 kN/m2, or 4.36 kN/m. The floor slab is for use in 
offices. Check the Code’s limits if the floor finishes are brittle.
Solution
From Example 7.1, considering the prestress at the support (not mid-span) the initial loss 
at transfer is 6.47% and final losses are 23.8%. Also (but not included in Example 7.1) 
the losses at installation at 28days after transfer are 10.5%.

Figure 11.4 shows distributions of camber, long-term deflections and movement 
along the span, together with the appropriate limits. It is usual for movement after 
installation to be critical, rather than long-term deflections. In this example the 
ratios of δ14/span/500=0.77 and δ10/span/250=0.24.
Example 11.2
Calculate the long-term deflection and the deflection after applying finishes for the 
inverted-tee beam shown in cross-section in Figure 6.10 and designed for serviceability 
in Example 7.10. The self-weight of the beam is 7.688 kN/m. The self-weight of floor 
slab=18.0 kN/m, other imposed dead loads=10.0 kN/m and imposed live load=30.0 
kN/m. The effective simply supported span is L=8.5m. The beam is for use in offices. 
Check the Code’s limits if the floor finishes are brittle.
Solution
From Example 7.10, considering the prestress at the support (not mid-span) the initial 
loss at transfer is 6.56% and final losses are 23.06%. Also (but not included in Example

It is usual for movement after installation to be critical, rather than long-term-deflec￾tions. In this example the ratios of δ14/span/500=0.37 and δ10/span/250=0.09.
It is noticeable that the deflections are much less for this beam compared with those 
for the hcu in Example 11.1, for example the movement after installation is 6.2mm com￾pared with 15.1mm, a ratio of 0.41. The main reasons for this are: Ic,co for the beam is 
6.5 times that of the hcu; the ratio of spans2 is 0.75; and the loading ratio is 37.0/10.72 
kN/m=3.45. Multiplying these ratios gives 3.45×0.75/6.5=0.40≈0.41.
Example 11.3
Calculate the long-term deflection and the deflection after applying finishes for the pairs 
of 150mm depth T beams shown in cross-section in Figure 7.12 (and Figure 5.29) for the 
designs in Examples 7.5 and 7.7. From Example 7.5, the self-weight (beam, blocks and 
infill), and the imposed dead and live loads are 0.691, 0.870 and 0.435 kN/m per beam. 
From Example 7.7 the point dead load for the cross-wall, built onto the screed, is 0.776 
kN per beam. The self-weight of the beam is 0.212 kN/m. The effective simply supported 
span is L=4.345m. The beam is for use in residential housing. Check the Code’s limits if 
the floor finishes are not brittle.
Solution
From Example 7.5, considering the prestress at the support (not mid-span) the initial loss 
at transfer is 7.40% and final losses are 27.12%. Also (but not included in Example 7.5)

11.2.3 Short-term deflections
11.2.3.1 Total short-term deflections
Short-term deflections, typically ti=28–90days, or when the full design imposed dead and 
live loads are applied, should also be calculated. The procedures in Section 11.2 are followed, Serviceability limit state for deflections and cracking 369
but the creep development coefficient ψʹ=0.4 to 0.6 replaces Χψ∞ =2.0, and the quasi-per￾manent factor ψ2 is either removed (i.e. ψ2 =1) or increased, depending on ti
, although there 
is no information in BS EN 1990 (BS EN 1990, 2002) on what ψ2 might be after say 90days. 
The maximum value in BS EN 1990, Table NA.A1.1 (NA to BS EN 1990, 2002) is ψ2 =0.8 
for storage areas, and this seems an appropriate value for any type of short-term loading. Of 
course at ti=28days ψ2t=1.0.
The deflection at installation is still from Eqs. 11.1 to 11.5 as δ3 +δ4
The effective creep coefficient after installation at 28days up to say 90days is
ψ = ψ( ) − ψ ψ = ( ) − × × = ′ ′ 28t t 28 X 0 ∞ .6 0.4 0.8 2.5 0.40 (11.15)
Short-term camber is as per Eq. 11.7, but to time ti
. The small difference in Ppmi between 
installation and ti
 may be ignored
δ16 = δ3 − ψ P z pmi cp c L E8 m c I co 2 28t , (11.16)
Short-term deflections δ17 and δ18 due to self-weight and dead loads, w1 and w2 is the same 
as Eqs. 11.8 and 11.9 but using ψ28t. Deflection due to the quasi-permanent live load ψ2t w3
is similar to Eq. 11.10 but using ψ28t and ψ2t
δ19 = +( ) 1 5 + ψ ψ w L3 384E I cm c co 4 28t 2t , (11.17)
The total short-term downward deflection is δ20 =δ4 +δ17 +δ18 +δ19 and the final short-term 
deflection δ21 =δ20 +δ16
11.2.3.2 Short-term movement after installation
Short-term movement for self-weight and dead loads is due to ψ28t, quasi-permanent static 
and visco-elastic live load deflections due to 1+ψ28t, and changes in camber after installa￾tion. Movement is the greater of δ22 or δ23

11.2.4 Deflections in partially cracked sections
11.2.4.1 Calculation of deflections
Although psc elements designed with the flexural tension limited to fctm are not flexurally 
cracked, it is informative to look at the behaviour of the elements when the service moment 
exceeds the cracking moment of resistance, Mcr which is also MsR where the exposure clas￾sification is XC1. Deflections beyond Mcr are illustrated in Figure 11.1 and test data are 
shown in Figures 9.3 and 9.5 and the normalised data in Figures 11.2 and 11.3 for hcu and 
T beams, respectively.
The design procedure is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.4.3 (3) and Exp. 7.18 & 7.19. 
The design is based on the rigidity of a partially cracked section, mid-way between flexur￾ally uncracked and fully cracked. The flexurally uncracked rigidity is Ec,eff Ic,co, where Ic,co
is the compound value used in Section 11.2.2. Ec,eff is defined in BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 7.20 
as Ec,eff=Ecm/(1+φ(∞,t0)), where φ(∞,t0) is the appropriate creep factor, but as explained in 
Section 11.2.2 creep coefficients ψ=ψʹ Χψ∞, for defined time intervals in the loading history 
of psc elements, are used instead. This is because several creep coefficients are appropriate, 
as shown in Eqs. 11.1 to 11.10 ψ1, ψ28 and Χψ∞ are used, such that an overall creep coef￾ficient is required. Taking the calculation of deflections for the hcu in Example 11.1, the 
final long-term deflection due to gravity loads is δ9 =72.6mm, but as shown in Example 
11.5 a single calculation using the quasi-permanent UDL gives an equivalent deflection, 
without creep effects, of δeq =27.4mm. Therefore the equivalent creep coefficient is ψeq =δ9/
δeq =(72.6/27.4)−1=1.65, a reasonable outcome given that the short-term and long-term 
creep coefficients are 0.71 & 1.20, and 2.0, respectively. The same calculation can be made 
for camber, based on the final prestress with around 20% losses, but without creep effects, 
which gives ψeq =2.50. The two values of (1+ψeq) may then be used as constants to calculate 
deflections for the partially cracked section, between Mcr and MRd.
The fully cracked rigidity is Ec,eff Icr, where Icr is the second moment of area of the cracked 
section, using the transformed area of the tendons mAp, where m=Ep/Ec,eff, where Ec,eff=Ecm
/(1+ψeq) and Ap is the area of tendons, including tendons in the top of the section.
The effective flexural rigidity is given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.4.3 (3) as
Exp. 7.18       ( α = ςαll + −1 )ς αl (11.20)
where α is a deformation parameter which may be considered for curvature, or rotation, 
but in this case may be taken as the flexural rigidity of the element for the purpose of 
deflections.
ζ is a tension stiffening coefficient, recognising that the section does not become instantly 
fully cracked, given as
Exp. 7.19 ζ=1−β (Mcr/Mk)2 (11.21)Serviceability limit state for deflections and cracking 371
αl
 and αll are the uncracked and fully cracked flexural rigidities which are renamed K1 and 
K2, respectively
β=a coefficient for the duration of the load, as
β=1.0 for short-term loading
β=0.5 for long-term, sustained or repeated loading
Mk =service bending moment
Mcr = σ Z f b c, o ( ) b + ctm (11.22)
Zb,co =uncracked compound section modulus (see Section 6.2.4)
Eqs. 11.20 and 11.21 are more easily understood if they are rearranged as
= + ( ) − β( ) 
 
 K K eff 2 1 K K2 M Mcr k ≤ K 2

i.e. Keff is equal to the fully cracked rigidity K2 plus a portion of the difference K1 −K2
where uncracked flexural rigidity K1=Ec,eff Ic,co
fully cracked flexural rigidity K2=Ec,eff Icr
The long-term camber, where Mk >Mcr is also a function of Keff assuming that, after differ￾ent creep effects, Ec,eff may not have the same value for the concrete in the bottom of the 
element which is under compression due to prestress.
The increased camber, due to the final pretensioning force Ppo is
δ17 = −P z po cpL K8 eff 2 (11.24)
The deflection due to the quasi-permanent gravity UDL wqp is
δ18 = +5w Lqp 384Keff 4 (11.25)
The final net deflection is δ19 = δ17 + δ18 (11.26)
11.2.4.2 Calculation of flexurally cracked second moment of area
For the fully flexurally cracked section, the calculation of the second moment of area Icr
requires the transformed area of tendons=mAp and the width of the section=b.
Referring to Figure 11.5, the depth to centroidal axis xc is given as the 1st moment of area 
about the top of the section bxc
2/2+mApd, divided by the area of the section bxc+mAp as
x b c c = + x m / 2 A dp c /( ) bx + mAp 2 (11.27)
Giving the quadratic equation 0.5b xc p + − mA x m c p A d = 0 2 (11.28)
If xc is within the top flange, i.e. xc≤hf
 the second moment of area about the centroidal 
axis is
I b cr = + x m c p A d( ) − xc / 3 3 2 (11.29)
Otherwise if xc>hf
 restart the calculation by splitting the section into the webs bwxc and 
remainder of the top flange (b−bw) hf
 as shown in Figure 11.6372 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
x b c w = + x b c w / 2 ( ) − + b hf / 2 mAp w d b /( ) x b c w + − ( ) b hf + mAp 2 2 (11.30)

Then K1 =13670×1296×106 =17.72×1012 Nmm2
and K2 =13670×373.4×106 =5.105×1012 Nmm2
Where the imposed service moment Mk >Mcr the effective rigidity is
Eq. 11.23 Keff=5.105×1012 +0.5×12.615×1012 ×(179.1/Mk)2
Let Mk =179.1 kNm, then Keff=[5.105+(6.307×1.0002)]×1012 =11.412×1012 Nmm2
The deflection due to the quasi-permanent gravity load is
Eq. 11.25δ18 =5×10.72×98004/384×11.412×1012 =+112.8mm,
The effect of β and Keff on camber has to be considered as follows

δeq =860.2×103 ×82.2×98002/(8×36283×1296×106)=−18.1mm.
ψeq =(63.2/18.1)−1=2.50
Note that ψeq is greater than expected for creep factors alone, that are 1.71×1.20=2.05, 
because of the 23% loss of prestress.
Ec,eff=36283/(1+2.50)=10354 N/mm2
and Keff=(10354/13670)×11.412=8.643×1012 Nmm2
Eq. 11.24 δ17 =−860.2×103 ×82.2×98002/8×8.643×1012 =−98.2mm
Eq. 11.26 δ19 =112.8−98.2=14.6mm
an increase of 5.2mm, or 1.55 times the deflection in the uncracked section. Of course, 
this does not happen in reality, as shown in Figure 9.3 for 200mm depth hcu and is due 
entirely to the β factor.374 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Let Mk =MRd =247.3 kNm, then Mcr/Mk =0.724
Keff=[5.105+(6.307×0.7242)]×1012 =8.413×1012 Nmm2
The UDL for a moment of 247.3 kNm is ws=8×247.3/9.82 =20.60 kN/m, of which 
8.92 kN/m is dead load.
Then wqp =8.92+[0.3×(20.60−8.92)]=12.42 kN/m
Eq. 11.25 δ18 =5×12.42×98004/384×8.413×1012 =+177.4mm
For camber, Keff=(10354/13670)×8.413=6.372×1012 Nmm2
Eq. 11.24 δ17 =−860.2×103 ×82.2×98002/8×6.372×1012 =−133.2mm
Eq. 11.26 δ19 =177.4−133.2=44.2mm
11.2.4.3 Discussion of deflections and deflection profiles
Figure  11.7 shows the results from the deflection calculations in Example 11.1, up to 
δ10 =+9.4mm, and from Example 11.5 from 9.4mm to δ19 =44.2mm. The gradient of the 
graph from 14.6 to 44.2mm is slightly parabolic, due to the term β (Mcr/Mk)2, but not as 
much as is seen in Figure 9.3 from full scale tests, although this was short-term loading 
without changes in camber. Figure  11.7 therefore suggests a probable curved profile for 
‘actual’ post-cracking deflections. Interestingly if β =1 and (Mcr/Mk)3 the calculated deflec￾tions follow the curved profile accurately, suggesting that for hcu, where cracking propa￾gates through the region of the narrow webs much quicker than for a solid rectangular 
section, the power term in BS EN 1992-1-1, Exp. 7.19 might be revised to 3 for hcu.

11.3 CRACK WIDTHS
11.3.1 Calculation of crack width
Prestressed concrete elements designed with the limiting tensile stress zero or fctm should 
not, by definition, require a check for crack width, and this has been the practice for many 
years. Unacceptable cracking may be avoided if the level of prestress does not exceed 0.75 fpk
in service, typically 1330 N/mm2, which is uncommon and means that the initial prestress 
needs to be as high as 0.85 fpk.
BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 7.1 (2) states that for the purpose of calculating crack widths, ser￾vice stresses should be for the flexurally uncracked section and the flexural tensile stress≤fctm. 
Further, clause 7.3.2 (4) states that where crack control is necessary no minimum reinforce￾ment is required providing that, under characteristic loading, the tensile stress is less than 
fctm. This is always the case as the only time characteristic loading is not used, the limiting 
tensile stress is zero for exposure classes greater than XC1, according to BS EN 1992-1-1, 
Table 7.1N, replaced by the UK National Annex to BS EN 1992-1-1, Table NA.4 (NA to BS 
EN 1992-1-1, 2004). Table 11.2 shows the part of Table 7.1N applicable to psc with bonded 
tendons. Note that Table 7.1N has not been accepted in all European countries, particularly 
for zero tension for exposure classes XC2 to XC4 where a limiting tensile stress of fctm/1.2 is 
used for example. Although Table 7.1N suggests that crack widths are required by calcula￾tion, and should be ≤0.2mm under the frequent load combination, it is not common practice 
to calculate crack widths. Two alternatives are therefore possible
1. under the frequent combination of load, the tensile stress is maintained as ≤1.65 fctm. 
This is proposed in Technical Report 43 (Concrete Society, 2005) albeit on post￾tensioned concrete slabs. It is also used in the Eurocode design guide by the Precast 
Concrete Federation (British Precast, 2008) for replacing crack width calculations for 
the frequent load.
2. crack spacing and crack width calculations are undertaken according to BS EN 1992-
1-1, clause 7.3.4.
The design crack width wk is the product of crack spacing sr,max and effective tensile strain 
between the steel bars εsm and the concrete εcm, allowing for tension stiffening, as

Note that in calculating εsm only the additional strain, not the total strain, beyond the state 
of zero strain in the concrete, i.e. for psc this means after decompression.
The net strain is given as

 k ft ct eff e eff eff E E p p ≥ σ (11.34a)
For psc, the steel stress σs may be replaced by ∆σp, the stress variation in the tendons from 
the state of zero strain in the concrete at the level of tendons nearest to soffit (Figure 11.8).
7.3.2 (2) fct,eff=fctm or lower fctm(t) if cracking is expected within 28days. For long￾term loading where kt=0.4 Exp. 7.9 is rewritten as

 f E ctm p ≥ ∆σp p E (11.34b)
If the limiting stress in the bottom of the section is fctm, then de facto the applied bending 
moment is Ms. ∆σp is calculated from Figure 11.8 as

For the majority of prestressed sections that are critical where Msr is based on fctm, x is very 
close to the bottom of the section, and if the bending stress was calculated using the frequent 
load decompression would not be attained and hence ∆σp would be zero.

so calculate the crack width. Cover=35mm to average diameter of tendons=11.17mm. 
Use ψ1 =0.5 for office loading.
Solution

Final prestress in top (from Example 7.1) is σt=−2.11 N/mm2.

But at least εsm −εcm =0.6×3.39/195000=10.41×10−6
Eq. 11.38 Distance between strands=180 mm<5×(35+11.17/2)
Eq. 11.37s=3.4×35+(1.6×0.5×0.425×11.17/0.0469)=200mm
Eq. 11.33wk =10.41×10−6 ×200=0.002 mm<0.2mm
As expected these equations are trying to say that wk is zero as the tensile stress is 
limited to fctm.

Composite slabs and beams
12.1 BACKGROUND TO THE USE OF 
COMPOSITE SLABS AND BEAMS
12.1.1 Composite floor slabs
Non-composite precast prestressed concrete (psc) floor units, such as hollow core units (hcu) 
and solid plank have very efficient structural properties, in terms of moment of resistance 
per unit area of tendons, easily twice as efficient as reinforcing bars (although the rela￾tive cost of strands vs rebars has to be taken into account as shown in Section 2.1, Figure 
2.10) and greater span/depth ratios where deflections are critical, at least 1.3–1.6 times 
greater than a corresponding statically reinforced slab with the same material properties 
and quantities. The units can also be tied together with tie steel, for example long lengths 
of unstressed 7 wire helical strand(s), and site bars cast into to the top of broken out hollow 
cores, to facilitate robustness in the event of accidental loading – this design and construc￾tion is given in the FIB Bulletin 63 (FIB, 2012) and covered by Elliott’s Chapter 11 (Elliott, 
2017). However, in many countries, particularly South East Asia and in earthquake-affected 
zones, the preferred choice is to design and construct all precast reinforced and psc floors as 
composite slabs, i.e. a prestressed unit made to behave as a monolithic slab by the addition 
of a reinforced structural topping. (Note the terminology ‘topping’ is different to a ‘screed’ 
which is considered as a non-composite concrete layer.) Figure 2.4 shows the preparation 
for a structural topping on precast hcu – a steel mesh, typically A142 (6 mm rebars at 200 
mm spacing in two directions) is positioned at mid-depth of the topping, with loose tie bars 
between the sheets and around the edges, then the precast surface is dampened, not pon￾ded, prior to pouring insitu concrete Topping, typically fckT =20 to 30 N/mm2, with fckT =25 
N/mm2 the most common. Figure 12.1 shows power floating the structural topping in the 
same project – the extra effort over tamping the surface may eliminate the need for addi￾tional finishes, saving costs as well as about 1.5–1.8 kN/m2 in self-weight.
The main benefit from composite action is to increase the bending resistance and flexural 
rigidity – shear and bearing resistance is barely increased. There are however a number of 
other reasons why a structural topping may be specified, such as
i. to improve vibration, thermal and acoustic performance of the floor
ii. to provide horizontal diaphragm action
iii. to provide horizontal stability ties in the form of steel mesh and rebars, or steel fibre 
reinforcement, across floors
iv. to provide a continuous and monolithic floor finish (e.g. where brittle finishes are applied)380 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Solid slabs and hcu may be used with or without a structural topping because the individual 
floor units are keyed together over the full surface area of their edges to form a floor ‘slab’. This 
may not be the case with all the other types of floor units, such as double-tee (Figure 2.19) or 
multi-rib units (Figure 2.21) where a structural topping (i.e. containing adequate reinforce￾ment) must be used either for horizontal load transfer, flexural and shear strength, or simply to 
complete the construction.
Precast concrete units are designed compositely with a structural topping of at least 50 
mm depth at the ‘crown’ – the highest point at mid-span in a pre-cambered unit, up to 100 
mm depth. There is some debate about whether depths of up to 150 mm are suitable, due to 
the large restraint to thermal gradients particularly at the roof level. Toppings of more than 
100 mm are counterproductive to the service moment of resistance as the additional self￾weight is consumed by the larger bending stresses because the rising centroidal axis causes 
a reduction in Zb,c,co, the composite compound section modulus at the bottom fibre (see 
Section 12.3.2.1). Double tee and thermal units are designed compositely with a structural 
topping, in which case the top flange depth is 50–75 mm. Solid psc units, often known as 
‘planks’ of depths 75–200 mm and spanning 3–8 m, as shown in Figure 12.2, are popular 
in South East Asia where the structural topping provides wet room facilities with embedded 
water and/or service pipes. The common name for these is ‘half-slab’. T beams (in beam 
and block flooring) are not generally designed compositely, although Figure 2.30c shows a 
successful detail in spite of the absence of a mechanical connection (e.g. dowels post-fixed 
into the top of the beams) should the interface at the top of the beam fail in horizontal shear.
12.2 FLEXURAL AND SHEAR BEHAVIOUR OF 
COMPOSITE PRESTRESSED SOLID SLABS
12.2.1 Flexural tests on composite prestressed slabs
Six full scale flexural tests were carried out on 1200 mm width×150 mm depth composite 
psc solid slabs. The tests aimed to demonstrate that the failure of the composite slab is not

due to bond failure at the interface between the precast unit and the topping, i.e. failure is 
by ultimate bending or large deflections.
Figure 12.3a and b shows the results of the applied bending moment vs. mid-span deflec￾tion. The composite slabs comprised 100 and 75 mm depth psc solid units with nominally 
50 and 75 mm insitu concrete structural topping, respectively. The average cube strength 
of the topping was 57.5 N/mm2, which converts to fckT=46 N/mm2. The topping was rein￾forced using A142 steel mesh at 25 mm cover. The slabs were subjected to four point loads 
at ¼ span spacing to produce constant bending moment near to mid-span over simply sup￾ported spans of 5.0 and 3.75 m, respectively. The precast units were pretensioned using 
33 and 28×5 mm wires, respectively to produce prestress in the bottom fibre of σb ≈9.5 
N/mm2. The top surface of the precast units was left as slipformed, i.e. not roughened, and was 
dampened 30 minutes before casting the insitu topping using 2.5–3.0 L of water per sq. m.
The results show, as with the non-composite hcu tests in Figures 7.1 and 9.3, the behav￾iour of composite psc slabs in bending is predictable and consistent. The calculated (i.e. 
predicted) ultimate MRd,c,calc (note suffix c for composite) and cracking Mcr,c,calc moments of 
resistance are compared with the corresponding experimental values Mu,c and Mc,c in Table 
12.1, together with the design MRd,c based on nominal dimensions and material properties. 
The ratio of Mu,c/MRd,c,calc varies from 1.18 to 1.35 with a mean value of 1.25, a result that 
is about 15% greater than for the non-composite hcu (Table 9.1) most probably because at 
failure the top flange is solid and uninterrupted by the hollow cores. The ratio at first crack￾ing Mc,c/Mcr,c,calc varies depending on the depth of the topping – the average for the 100+50 
mm slabs was 1.24 compared with 1.52 for the 75+75 mm slabs. Mc,c in the tests varies only 
by ±5%, whereas Mcr,c,calc for the 75+75 mm slab was 20% lower because of the much larger 
self-weight stress acting on the shallower precast unit. The average ratio of the test/design 
Mu,c/MRd,c is 1.77, greater than the maximum possible load factor γf
 of 1.5, showing how 
much the composite slabs have in reserve.382 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

Figure 12.4 shows an important feature for the position and direction of flexural cracks, 
which pass through the interface at mid-depth and develop into compressive-splitting cracks 
with no interface shear failure.

at first cracking, agrees with calculated values for the 100+50 mm slabs, where the mean Composite slabs and beams 383
experimental and calculated values are 4.15 vs 4.30 kNm/mm, respectively, but less so 
for the 75+75 mm slabs of 5.60 vs 7.50 kNm/mm, respectively. It is not known why the 
experimental stiffness of the latter is 26% lower than predicted, as the span/depth ratio of 
3750/150=25 in not particularly small. The horizontal interface deformation between the 
precast unit and the topping at the ends of the slab ∆s is less than 0.2 mm at the first crack￾ing load, compared with ∆s<0.12 mm for the 100+50 mm slab, but in all cases, there was 
no slippage at the cracking load.
Overall the results show good consistency, with the one exception as above, with confi￾dent predictions of the cracking and ultimate moments of resistance.

12.2.2 Shear tests on composite prestressed slabs
Seven shear tests were also carried out on similar specimens (4 no. 100 mm precast plus 50 
mm topping, and 3 no. 75 plus 75 mm) in an attempt to produce horizontal interface shear 
failure (see Section 12.4). The average cube strength of the topping was 60.7 N/mm2, which 
converts to fckT =50.5 N/mm2. The slabs were subjected to a single transverse point load at a 
distance of 2.5h=375 mm, where h is the total depth of the composite slab. In all tests the slabs 
failed in flexure beneath the point load, and not in shear. As shown in Figure 12.5 horizontal 
interface shear failure occurred in two out of three 75+75 mm slabs, where the average total 
bending moment (inclusive of self-weight) of Mu,c=79.3 kNm is combined with the average 
applied shear force of Vu,c=203.5 kN (does not include the self-weight of the composite slab). 
There was no interface failure in the 100+50 mm slabs where averages for Mu,c=74.0 kNm 
and Vu,c=187.7 kN. It is expected that the interface shear stress will be greater in the 75+75 
mm depth slabs as the interface is at the mid-depth and centroid of the composite section and 
the forces in the 75 mm depth topping will be greater.
Figure 12.5 also shows the calculated values for the flexurally cracked composite shear 
capacity VRd,cr,c,calc where the ratio of the experimental total shear force (inclusive of self￾weight) to VRd,cr,c,calc is 0.96 and 1.00 for the 75+75 mm and 100+50 mm depth slabs, 
respectively. Although these ratios should be greater than unity, say 1.1–1.2, the complexity 
of testing and calculating the flexurally cracked shear capacity is recognised in the results.

that the depth of the nominally 50 and 75 mm topping averaged 60 and 81 mm, respectively.

respectively, all greater than vRdi,calc=c 0.7fctm =0.583 and 0.565 N/mm2, respectively, by an 
average ratio of 2.35. This ratio is in general agreement with the figure of 2.86 based on 
similar work by Ibrahim (Ibrahim et al., 2016) in Section 12.4. Table 12.2 also gives the 
horizontal interface slippage ∆s just prior to failure at the maximum experimental shear 
force. The average for the tests is ∆s=0.08 mm. After interface failure in the three 75+75 
mm slabs then ∆s≈0.7, 30 and 32 mm, i.e. uncontrolled failure in the latter.
12.3 DESIGN OF COMPOSITE FLOORS
12.3.1 Precast floors with composite toppings
The structural capacity of precast psc floor units may be increased by adding a layer of 
structural reinforced concrete to the top of the unit. Providing that the topping concrete is 
fully anchored and bonded to the precast unit the two concretes, precast and cast insitu, 
may be designed as monolithic. The section properties of the precast unit plus the top￾ping are used to determine the structural performance of the composite floor. A composite 
floor may be made using any type of precast unit, but clearly, there is more to be gained 
from using voided psc units, such as hcu or double-tee, which are lightweight and therefore 
cheaper to transport and erect than solid psc units. Figure 12.6 shows the details for the 
most common types of composite floors.
The minimum depth of the topping should not be less than 50 mm. When calculating 
the average depth of the screed allowances for camber should be made – span/300 will suf￾fice. The grade of insitu concrete is usually C25 or C30, but there is no reason why higher 
strength cannot be used except that the increased strength of the composite floor resulting 
from the higher grade will not justify the additional costs of materials and quality con￾trol. See Tables 4.2 and 4.3 for the concrete data. The topping must be reinforced, but, as 
explained later, interface shear reinforcement between the precast and insitu topping is only 
required if the design dictates, although some designers specify minimum loops or dowels

such as H12 at 1200 mm spacing. Mesh reinforcement of minimum area 0.13% or 0.26 
fctm/fyk ×concrete area is the preferred choice, e.g. 75 mm minimum depth topping, having a 
maximum depth due to camber of say 90 mm, requires 0.0013×1000×90=117 mm2/m, use 
a square mesh A142 (142 mm2/m).
Composite floor design is carried out in two stages, before and after the insitu topping 
becomes structural. The transfer stress condition in the psc unit must have previously been 
satisfied. Therefore, the precast unit must carry its own weight plus the self-weight of the 
wet insitu concrete (plus a construction traffic allowance typically 1.5 kN/m2). The com￾posite floor (= precast+hardened topping) carries imposed dead and live loads. In the final 
analysis, the stresses and forces resulting from the two cases (minus the construction traffic 
allowance which is temporary) are additive. Relative shrinkage stresses between the insitu
topping and precast unit should be added, see Section 12.3.2.2.
Figures 2.14, 2.18, 2.22 and 2.26 show the load capacity for solid and hcu slabs, wet-cast 
voided floor slabs, double-tee floors and thermally insulated floor slabs, all achieved using 
a 75 mm thick structural topping. The precast units are all unpropped during the construc￾tion of the topping – see Section 12.3.3 to discuss the effect of propping. The benefit from 
the topping decreases as (i) the span increases because the self-weight of insitu topping nul￾lifies the additional capacity and (ii) the unit depth increases because the section modulus 
of the composite section is proportionately less. The following design procedures are used.

12.3.2 Flexural analysis for composite 
prestressed concrete elements
12.3.2.1 Serviceability state of stress
Permissible service stresses are checked at two stages of loading – Stages 1 and 2 before and 
after hardening of the insitu topping as follows:
1. Stage 1: for the self-weight of the precast slab w0 plus the self-weight of insitu Topping 
wT, plus an allowance for temporary construction traffic wc of up to 1.5 kN/m2. The 
section properties of the precast unit alone are Zb and Zt
 for stress analysis and Zb,co
and Zt,co for moment of resistance.
2. Stage 2: for imposed dead load w2 and superimposed live load w3. The section proper￾ties of the composite compound section Zb,c,co and Zt,c,co for stresses. The temporary 
construction load is removed.
Stage 1. Referring to Figure 12.7, a precast psc unit has the final prestress after losses of 
σb and σt
 according to Eqs. 6.1 and 6.2. (It is likely that σt
 will be negative=tension.) 
Let Ms1 be the maximum service bending moment due to the stage 1 load. The flexural 
stresses in the bottom and top of the precast unit must first satisfy
fb1 =+ σb −Ms1/Zb,co ≤+0.45 fck and≥−fctm (12.1)
ft1 =+ σt+Ms1/Zt,co ≥- fctm and≤+0.45 fck (12.2)
(the most likely condition in bold) where Zb,co and Zt,co are the stage 1 section 
compound modulii for the precast unit alone defined in Section 6.2.4. The transfer 
stress condition in the precast unit must have previously been satisfied.
Stage 2. Let Ms2 be the maximum service bending moment due to the stage 2 load. The 
flexural stresses in the bottom and top of the precast unit and at the top of the com￾posite floor are derived from the composite section as

To calculate these values, the second moment of area Ic,c,co of the composite section must be 
determined using the modular ratio approach for fckT and EcmT of the insitu topping. This is 
to allow for the different elastic modulii of the precast and insitu concrete, typically (from 
Eq. 4.6) [(25+8)/(45+8)]0.3 =0.87. Referring to Figure 12.8, the width of the insitu topping 
is reduced in proportion to Ecm such that the effective width of the topping is
beff=b EcmT/Ecm (12.6)
where EcmT is the elastic modulus for the Topping
Note that in this case b=full width of the precast unit, e.g. 1200 mm, not the manufac￾tured top width, e.g. 1154 mm.

where, in Eq. 12.14, Ms2 is the quasi-permanent load and is therefore rarely critical. Equation 
12.15 is rarely critical and does not affect the design of the precast unit.
As with non-composite design in Section 7.2.1, the limit −fctm in Eq. 12.13a only applies to 
durability exposure class XC1. For XC2 to XC4 and XD1/XS1, the limiting tension is zero 
and Ms2 is replaced by Ms2,qp and Ms2,freq is for the quasi-permanent and frequent imposed 
loads, respectively. Then
fb =σb −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2,qp/Zb,c,co ≥0 (12.13b)
fb =σb −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2,freq/Zb,c,co ≥0 (12.13c)
The critical situation nearly always occurs at the bottom of the slab because the new position 
of the centroidal axis is often close to the top of the precast unit, as shown in Figure 12.8. 
Equation 12.13a can be written as
MsR2 =Ms2 ≥(fctm +σb) Zb,c,co −[Ms1 (Zb,c,co/Zb,co)] (12.16)
with the same replacement of fctm with zero for exposure>XC1.
As the situation at the top of the precast unit should also be checked for completeness, Eq. 
12.14 can be written as
MsR2 =Ms2 ≥(0.45 fck −σt
) Zt,c,co −[Ms1 (Zt,c,co/Zt,co)] (12.17)
Total MsR,c=Minimum MsR2 +Ms1 (12.18)
However, as explained in Section 7.2.1 under certain conditions in order to avoid non-linear 
creep the final compressive stress in the top may be limited to +0.45 fcm. Then Eq. 12.14 may 
be written as
ft=σt+Ms1/Zt,co +Ms2/Zt,c,co ≤0.45 fcm (12.19)390 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The construction traffic loading needs only be considered as part of Ms1 when checking 
that the service stresses do not exceed 0.45 fck and −fctm. It does not have to be included in 
the final calculation in Eq. 12.17 because it is not a permanent load. (Nor does if affect the 
ultimate limit state.)
It is not possible to prepare in advance standard calculation for composite floor slabs. This is 
because the final stresses in Eqs.12.16 and 12.17 depend on the respective magnitudes of stage 
1 and stage 2 loads and moments, i.e. the same precast concrete unit may have different load￾bearing capacity when used in different conditions. The following examples will show this.
Example 12.1
Calculate the stage 2 service bending moment MsR2 that is available if the 250 mm depth 
prestressed concrete hollow core unit (hcu) shown in cross section in Figure 12.9 and in 
Example 7.1 has a 75 mm minimum depth of structural topping. The top surface of the 
topping is power floated (as shown in Figure 12.1) such that the screed may be eliminated 
and floor finishes can be laid directly. Therefore, floor finishes, ceiling and services may be 
taken as 2.0 kN/m2. The floor is simply supported over an effective span of 9.8 m. The pre￾camber of the hcu at installation may be taken from Example 11.1 as −21 mm. Use fck =45 
N/mm2 and fckT for the insitu concrete topping=25 N/mm2. Self-weight of topping (including 
mesh)=25 kN/m3. Exposure class is XC1. Calculate the maximum imposed service load.
Before commencing the solution, a technical note that the creep loss is smaller because 
the tensile bending stress due to self-weight {−Mself/Zz} in Eq. 6.16, which serves to reduce 
the compressive strain causing creep, now includes the self-weight of the topping. As a 
result, σb after losses increases slightly from the value in Example 7.1 from 12.94 to 12.98 
N/mm2. The final σt
 after losses is −2.116 N/mm2.

Top ft=−2.116+8.27+2.75=+8.90 N/mm2 <0.45 fck =20.25 N/mm2
The additional moment capacity available, due to the additional stress at the bottom 
of fb −fctm =−0.98−(−3.80)=+2.82 N/mm2, is MsR,c−M2 =2.82×16.295×106 ×10−6 =45.9 
kNm.

For completeness at the top, due to an additional stress of 0.45 fctm −ft=20.25–
8.90=+11.35 N/mm2, is MsR,c - M2 =11.35×36.645×106 ×10–6 =415.9 kNm, clearly not 
critical
The allowable imposed load=8×(100.8+45.9)/9.82 =12.22 kN/m=12.22/1.2=10.18 
kN/m2 >7.0 kN/m2
Note that MsR,c=229.9>179.1 kNm is 28% greater than for the non-composite unit 
in Example 7.1, but the volume of concrete used in the composite slab is 59% more, 
although not having a 75 mm depth screed brings this down to 9%. Therefore, providing 
the structural topping replaces the screed the composite slab is more efficient in terms of 
capacity vs. mass of concrete.
Alternative ways of looking at the additional structural benefits of a composite slab 
are: (i) using the original design loading the maximum effective span for this composite 
slab could be increased from 9.80 to 10.82 m, or (ii) using the original effective span the 
imposed live load could be increased from 5.00 to 8.20 kN/m2. In both cases, serviceabil￾ity would always be critical over the ultimate limit states of bending and shear.392 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Figure 12.10 shows the service design moments and the moments of resistance for 
Example 12.1. Note the reduction in MsR,c as the stage 1 stresses increase towards mid￾span. At the supports, where Ms=0, MsR,c is due to fctm and the compound section modu￾lus Zb,c,co. Then MsR,c=3.80×16.295=61.9 kNm. From there to x=lpt2, the end of the 
transmission length, MsR,c increases linearly.
12.3.2.2 Relative shrinkage between insitu topping to precast unit
In calculating service stress and deflections, the effects of the relative shrinkage of the top￾ping to that of the precast unit should be added to those resulting from loads and prestress￾ing. For the ultimate limit state BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 2.2.2 (2) states that shrinkage (and 
creep) should ‘generally’ be taken into account in the serviceability limit state and should 
only be considered at ultimate where their effects are significant, for example in the verifi￾cation of ultimate limit states of stability where second order effects are important, which 
rules out floor slabs and beams. If the topping is cast in bays, possibly a few days apart, the 
shrinkage effect will be considerably reduced due to the localised curvatures beneath each 
section of the pour. The effect of relative movement between precast and insitu concrete is 
well documented in text books and FIB documents (e.g. Bhatt, 2011, FIP Recommendations, 
1982) and may be summarised as follows
Refer to Figure 12.11. Relative horizontal shrinkage (suffix sh) between the insitu topping 
and precast unit is
εsh =εcsT −εcs (12.20)
where εscT is the nominal unrestrained, or ‘free’, shrinkage of the topping according to BS 
EN 1992-1-1, Table 3.2 and Exp. 3.11. This term may include the axial restraint due to steel

the long-term modular ratio of the rebars to insitu concrete usually taken as 15. For example 
using A142 mesh in 75 mm topping (1+mρ)=1+(15×142/1000×75)=1.03.
εcs is for the precast unit as determined in Section 7.2.4.3. This term may include the

Lever arm from centroid of topping (depth t) and the centroid of the composite section is
a=h+0.5t−yb,c,co (12.23)
Restoring stress in the precast slab are σsh,b in the bottom (compression positive) and σsh,t in 
the top
σsh,b =+Fsh/Ac,c,co −Fsh a/Zb,c,co (12.24)
σsh,t=+Fsh/Ac,c,co +Fsh a/Zt,c,co (12.25)
For example, assuming that the topping is cast in a single pour, and subjecting the composite 
slab in Example 12.1 to a relative shrinkage strain of εsh =528−432=96×10−6, where from 
Example 7.1, εcs=432×10−6, and for 50% relative humidity and fck =25 N/mm2 εcsT =(εcd +εca)/
(1+mρ)={506×10−6 +[1.00×2.5×(25−10)×10−6]}/1.03=528×10−6. This is roughly in line 
with the recognised value between insitu toppings and precast elements as εsh =100×10−6. 
Continuing with εsh =100×10−6
The restoring force Fsh =σsh AcT =3.148×75×1200×10−3 =283.3 kN
where σsh =εsh EcmT =100×10–6 ×31476=3.148 N/mm2
a=287.5−173.0=114.5 mm
σsh,b =283.3×103 ×[(1/250060)−(114.5/16.295×106)]=+1.13−1.99=−0.86 N/mm2
In effect, the shrinkage-induced stress reduces the short-term MsR,c by 0.86×16.295×106 ×
10−6 =14.0 kNm. In the long term, the stress reduces due to the exponential creep growth fac￾tor Ψ=1−e−φ, e.g. if φ=2.0, then Ψ=0.86. Then MsR,c reduces by 0.86×14.0=12.0 kNm. This 
may be reduced further by the end restraints and/or continuity at the end of slabs and beams.

12.3.2.3 Ultimate limit state of bending
The design at ultimate limit state is also a two-stage process, with the flexural stresses result￾ing from the self-weight of the precast element plus the wet insitu concrete being carried by 
the precast unit alone. The lever arm in stage 1 is the same as in a non-composite design, but 
is now known as d1. The method used is to calculate the area of steel Ap1 required in stage 1 
and to add the area Ap2 required in stage 2 using an increased lever arm. See Figure 12.12a. 
The effect of the structural topping is to increase the lever arm to the steel reinforcement 
by an amount equal to the depth of the screed t, proving the depth to the neutral axis is less 
than t. See Figure 12.12b. In stage 2, the effective ultimate width of the topping is
bef=b×fckT (insitu topping)/fck (precast) (12.26)
where b is the full width of the precast unit, e.g. 1200 mm, not the manufactured width. 
(Note that beff is used for the elastic effective width in service.)
Some design engineers choose not to separate the design into two stages, using the compos￾ite section properties alone. This was a satisfactory approach in the past where the plateau in 
the stress-strain relationship meant that the ultimate stress fp was not dependent on the design 
strain εp. However, the inclined branch of BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 3.10 (Figure 9.8) means that 
fp is still increasing with εp. Adopting a two-stage approach, Figure 12.12a equilibrium in the 
section due to stage 1 moment MEd1 is determined first, followed by the compatibility and 
equilibrium due to stage 2 moment MEd2 as follows.
Stage 1. MEd1 =due to self-weight, topping, propping (and any trimmer angle dead loads 
acting as a point load, see Figure 10.40).

The composite MRd,c2 is calculated according to Section 9.3.1 but using Ap2 instead of Ap
Total MRd,c=MRd,c2 +MEd1 (12.36)
There is a problem in calculating standard values for MRd for specific units because the stage 
1 moments and area of steel must be first known. As these are span-dependant, the superim￾posed moment capacity MRd,c2 is a function of span and stage 1 loads.
Example 12.2
Calculate the ultimate bending moment of resistance MRd,c for the 250 mm depth hcu 
with a 75 mm depth topping shown in cross section in Figure 12.9 and designed in 
Example 12.1. In this example ONLY let the age at installation=7 days. What is the 
maximum ultimate imposed load. Is the composite slab critical at service or at ultimate?
Solution
Effective depth in the hcu d1 =209.2 mm and b1 =1154 mm
Effective depth in composite section d2 =209.2+75=284.2 mm
Consider stage 1 moment acting on precast alone at installation at ti=7 days
Eq. 12.28 fck(ti

MEd1 =1.25×83.2=104.0 kNm where γG =1.25 from Exp 6.10b396 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Eq. 12.28 K1 =104.0×106/(35.4×1154×209.22)=0.058
Eq. 12.29 z1 ={0.5+√[0.25−(0.058/1.134)]}×209.2=197.9 mm<0.95d1
Ultimate stress fp is not known until the stage 2 MRd is found, therefore taking the limit￾ing strain as 0.02 then fp1 =1516 N/mm2 (this assumption is checked at the end of this 
calculation).
Ap1 =104.0×106/(197.9×1516)=346 mm2

From eq. 1 εp =0.001343+0.995/61.9=0.017413

MRd,c=fp Ap2 z2 +MEd1 =1491×565×259.4×10−6 +104.0=322.5 kNm
The design ultimate UDL is wEd =20.65 kNm. Then MEd =20.65×9.82/8=247.9 
kNm<322.5 kNm
Stage 2 MRd,c2 =322.5−104.0=218.5 kNm
Ultimate imposed load wEd =8×218.5/9.82 =18.2 kN/m=15.1 kN/m2 >7.0 kN/m2
Note that MRd,c=322.5>247.3 kNm is 30% greater than for the non-composite unit in 
Example 9.1, almost the same percentage increase (28%) as for the serviceability moments.
Referring to Example 12.1, the ratio of ultimate/service resistance=322.5/229.9=1.40. 
As this value is less than γQ =1.5 and greater than γG =1.25 the composite slab may be criti￾cal under either limit states. In this loading case γ=1.35<1.40, therefore the composite slab 
is critical at service. Using the original design loading the maximum effective span for this 
composite slab could be increased from 9.80 to 11.08 m, but now MsR,c fails by 6%, or 
using the original effective span the imposed live load could be increased from 5.00 to 8.44 
kN/m2 but now MsR,c fails by 2%. Therefore, in both cases, the service limit is first critical.
The assumption is that the ultimate stress at stage 1 fp1 =1516 N/mm2 is not too far from 
the final stress fp =1491 N/mm2. If iteration is carried out by say letting fp1 =1491 N/mm2
then fp increases slightly to 1492 N/mm2 and MRd,c reduces by 1.6 kNm to 320.9 kNm.
Figure 12.10 shows the ultimate design moments and the moments of resistance for 
Example 12.2.Composite slabs and beams 397
12.3.2.4 Ultimate shear capacity of composite sections
The design for ultimate shear capacity for composite hcu slabs is defined in BS EN 1168 (BS 
EN 1168, 2005) as a two-stage design, but is not mentioned as such in BS EN 1992-1-1. It is 
technically correct to deduct the elastic shear stress consumed in stage 1 before the topping 
hardens as
vEd1 =VEd1 Sc/bw Ic (12.37)
Clearly, this approach may be used for solid slabs, double-tee, thermal units, etc., but it 
again highlights the paradox that VRd,c,c is an ultimate strength based on an elastic analysis. 
However, there is some ductility if the shear-tension failure mode is critical (as is the case of 
UDL) even in hcu with narrow webs, and so adopting this method is valid. Referring to BS 
EN 1168, Annex F, clause F2.2, the stage 2 shear capacity is
VRd,c,c2 =Ic,c bw/Sc,c [√(fctd2 +αl σcp fctd)−vEd1] (12.38)
For hcu, where shear cracking commences in the narrowest part of the webs, the same value 
for αl=lx/lpt2 as for the non-composite design is used for the composite design (Eq. 9.2). 
Similarly the same applies to σcp calculated at the centroid of the precast hcu. This rule does 
not apply to solid slabs where the shear plane moves up to yb,c, then αl=(Lb/2+yb,c)/lpt2 and 
σcp is calculated at the same level.
The total composite shear capacity now includes VEd1 as
VRd,c,c=VRd,c,c2 +VEd1 (12.39)
where VEd1 =ultimate dead load acting on the unit, including self-weight of wet insitu topping
Sc Ic=first and second moment of area of the non-composite section
Sc,c=first moment of area for the composite section above the centroidal axis of the com￾posite section
Sc,c=beff t (h+0.5t−yb,c)+b(h−yb,c)2/2 (12.40a)
where beff is the elastic effective width (not the ultimate bef)
If centroidal axis is below top flange yb,c<h−hft, subtract the area for the hollow cores
Sc,c=beff t (h+0.5t−yb,c)+b(h−yb,c)2/2−(b−bw)(h−hft−yb,c)2/2 (12.40b)
Note that due to camber, the depth of the structural topping at the supports, where VRd,c,c is 
calculated, may be 10–20 mm more than t, provided the topping is floated level (not following 
the profile of camber, which may imply variable thickness screed is being used). For example, in 
the present design of the 250 mm depth hcu, the camber at installation is 21 mm, such that the 
depth of the topping is 75+21=96 mm. This is usually ignored in design as it may not be known 
whether the topping is to be floated level, or will follow the camber with a uniform depth t.
6.2.2 (2) Use VRd,c,c where Ms=Ms1+Ms2 <composite cracking moment Mcr,c for two￾stage loading as follows.
The composite section is flexurally cracked at ultimate when
σb −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2/Zb,c,co ≥−fctk,0.05/γc=−fctd398 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Ms2 =(σb −Ms1/Zb,co +fctd) Zb,c,co
Mcr,c=Ms1 +(σb −Ms1/Zb,co +fctd) Zb,c,co
Mcr,c=(σb +fctd) Zb,c,co −Ms1 [(Zb,c,co/Zb,co)−1)] (12.41)
i.e. Mcr,c varies along the span according to stage 1 service moment, including the effects of 
propping. Where Ms1 =0, Mcr,c=(σb +fctd) Zb,c,co.
For the ultimate cracked shear capacity VRd,cr,c
Using BS EN 1168, clause F4, the same equations as non-composite units apply except that 
the composite effective depth d2 =d+t replaces d. There is no two-stage design for VRd,cr,c as Eq. 
9.7 is based on the dowel action of the tendons provided, irrespective of the state of stress at 
stage 2, and the term 0.15 σcp is not affected by the negative bending stress due to stage 1 loads. 
Similarly, Eq. 10.10 is based on the shear strength of concrete using design concrete data.
Example 12.3
Calculate the ultimate shear capacity VRd,c,c and VRd,cr,c for the 250 mm depth hcu with 
a 75 mm depth topping shown in cross section in Figure 12.9 and designed in Example 
12.1. Derive an expression from Eq. 12.41 where the section becomes flexurally cracked 
in the span and the shear capacity reduces to VRd,cr,c.
To remind the reader, for the non-composite section in Example 10.1 VRd,c=(1270×106
×302/6.783×106)×[√(1.772 +0.307×4.61×1.77)]×10−3 =134.3 kN, and the shear span 
lv1 =9.454 m. The prestress at the support from Example 7.1 is σb =11.97 N/mm2. The 
stage 1 load from Example 12.1 is 6.93 kN/m per unit width.
Solution

this point is 12.1 kN, clearly not critical.
12.3.3 Propping
12.3.3.1 Flexural stresses in propped composite slabs
Propping is a technique that is used to increase the service moment capacity by reversing 
the stage 1 stresses, particularly at mid-span. This is achieved by placing a rigidly founded 
support, load-bearing props, such as Peri or similar, in the desired place whilst the insitu
concrete topping is hardening. See Figures 12.13 and 12.14. To ensure that the props are 
always effective, many contractors prefer to use two props rather than one – just in case 
Figure 12.13 Propping of prestressed floor slab. (Courtesy Bison Precast Ltd., UK.)400 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
the foundation to one of the props is ‘soft’. However, the following analysis will consider a 
single mid-span propped floor slab. The reader can easily extend the same analysis to twin 
props at ⅓ and ⅔ span.
The benefit derives from the fact that the stage 1 moments due to the self-weight of the wet 
concrete screed are determined over a continuous double span, each of L/2. When the props 
are removed, the prop reaction R creates a new moment which is carried by the composite 
section. Finally, the superimposed loads are added as shown in Figure 12.14.
When rigidly secured at mid-span, the single prop nullifies the deflection due to the self￾weight wT of the wet insitu topping (allowing for precamber of the slab) of an effective span 
L, which would otherwise be 5 wT L4/384 Ecm Ic,co. The virtual upward deflection due to a 
prop reaction R is R L3/48 Ecm Ic,co. When these deflections are equal 5 wT L4/384=R L3/48, 
and hence R=240 wT L/384=0.625 wT L. Prop reactions for single and twin props are 
shown in Figure 12.15.
The negative moment at mid-span due to the prop M=−0.625 wT L2/4=−5 wT L2/32. The 
stage 1 moment is now Ms1 =w0 L2/8+wT L2/8−5 wT L2/32=w0 L2/8−wT L2/32, where w0 is 
the self-weight of the precast unit. The additional Stage 2 moment following the removal of 
the prop is Ms2 =+5 wT L2/32.

Eq. 12.16 is therefore modified as
MsR2 =(fctm +σb) Zb,c,co −[Ms1 (Zb,c,co/Zb,co)]−5 wT L2/32 (12.42a)
For 2 props positioned at ⅓ and ⅔ span
MsR2 =(fctm +σb) Zb,c,co −[Ms1 (Zb,c,co/Zb,co)]−11 wT L2/90 (12.42b)
with the same replacement of fctm with zero for exposure>XC1.
When the prop(s) is removed Ms2 =+5 wT L2/32 or +11 wT L2/90, respectively, plus all 
imposed dead and live loads.
Finally, the total MsR,c from Eq. 12.8 is
MsR,c=MsR2 +Ms1 (12.43)
but where in Eq. 12.43 Ms1 =(w0 +wT) L2/8, i.e. the negative moment due to the prop is not 
included twice.

the propped construction traffic of say wc=1.5 kN/m2, note that the maximum bending 
moment is not at mid-span. If the end reaction F due to self-weight and construction is 
(w0 +wT +wc) L/2, and due to the prop reaction is−0.625 (wT +wc) L/2, then
R=[0.5 (w0 +wT +wc)−0.3125 (wT +wc)] L (12.44)
The distance to zero shear force, and hence the position of Ms1,max is at a=F/(w0 +wT +wc), 
then
a=[0.5−0.3125 (wT +wc)/(w0 +wT +wc)] L (12.45)
and
Ms1,max =Fa−(w0 +wT +wc) a2/2 (see Example 12.4) (12.46)
The service moment of resistance in the temporary situation is calculated in the usual man￾ner, i.e. (σb +fctm) Zb,co. (Note that in the temporary situation, fctm is used also for exposure 
classification greater than XC1.) The prestress σb may, if the designer wishes, be calculated 
at the time of installation, not the long-term value – the difference is usually about 10%.
The economical and practical benefits of propping wide slabs such as hcu and double-tees 
should be carefully considered. Propping can be quite expensive and may slow down site 
erection rates. Refer to Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1 on the subject of propping from a manufac￾turer’s point of view.
Example 12.4
Repeat Example 12.1 with the hcu propped at mid-span. The effective span is now 
increased to 11.2 m to reflect the increased service moment capacity due to propping. The 
increased length of slab has reduced creep losses such that σb =13.28 N/mm2 and σt= −2.17 
N/mm2. The camber at installation has reduced from 21.1 to 19.6 mm, due to the compen￾sating effect of self-weight. The self-weight of the topping in now wT =2.54 kN/m.
Check the service moment of resistance in the temporary stage, due to the self-weight 
of the hcu, propped topping and a construction allowance of 1.5 kN/m2. It is known that 
the prestress at installation at 28 days is σb =14.53 N/mm2 (this is greater than the long￾term value due to smaller losses of prestress at installation).
Solution
Separating the bending stresses into stages 1 and 2
Stage 1

Ms1 =6.90×11.22/8=108.25 kNm minus moment (due to propping)

Ms1 =108.25−49.85=58.40 kNm
fb1 =58.40/10.701=−5.45 N/mm2
ft1 =58.40/10.056=+5.81 N/mm2Composite slabs and beams 403
Stage 2. Prop removed
Ms2 =49.85+1.2×7.0×11.22/8=49.85+131.71=181.56 kNm
fb2 =181.56/16.295=−11.14 N/mm2
ft2 =181.56/36.645=+4.95 N/mm2
Final stresses
fb =13.28+−5.45+−11.14=−3.32 N/mm2 >−3.80 N/mm2
ft=-2.17+5.81+4.95=+8.60 N/mm2 <<+20.25 N/mm2
Additional moment of resistance due to propping MsR −Ms=(3.80−3.32)×16.295×106 ×
10−6 =7.82 kNm
MsR,c=58.40+181.56+7.82=247.8 kNm
Ms2 =131.71+7.82=139.5 kNm
The maximum imposed service load in stage 2, ws2 =8×139.5/11.22 =8.90 kN/m=7.41 
kN/m2 >7.0 kN/m2 design imposed load.
Alternatively, using Eqs. 12.42a and 12.43 directly
MsR2 =(3.80+13.28)×16.295−(58.40×16.295/10.701)−49.85=139.5 kNm
MsR,c=MsR2 +Ms1 =139.5+101.25=247.8 kNm
This is the situation at mid-span. However, the negative bending moment due to propping 
(as shown in Figure 12.14) causes a shift in the position of critical stress from mid-span 
x/L=0.50 to about 0.48 (the shift increases for greater topping depth). At this point 
ws2 =7.38 kN/m2 a reduction of only 0.5% compared to the mid-span calculation, but as 
the depth of the topping increases relative to the depth of the precast unit, this difference 
is greater, e.g. if the topping depth increases to 150 mm the critical stress is at x/L=0.43 
and difference in ws2 is 3.5%. It should be noted that although propping increases MsR,c
it does not increase MRd,c (except for a small increase due to lower MEd1) nor VRd,c,c, and 
as MRd,c becomes critical the full extent of propping is not advantageous. For exam￾ple, in this same example, the ultimate limit state is critical, i.e. MEd =323.3 kNm and 
MRd,c=323.5 kNm, so that L=11.2 m is in fact the critical span.
Figure 12.16 shows the service and ultimate design moments and the moments of resis￾tance for Example 12.4. Note the reduction in MsR,c as the stage 1 stresses increase is 
nullified by propping.
It was noted in Example 12.1 that, under the same design loading, the maximum effec￾tive span in the unpropped composite slab was 10.82 m. The maximum effective span 
in the propped slab is 11.20 m – the designer and contractor have therefore to assess the 
benefit of propping, viz, additional span against the cost of propping.
Temporary condition after casting topping
The distance a to the maximum bending moment Ms1,max in stage 1 is as follows:
Self-weight of precast, topping and construction load w0 +wT +wc=4.36+2.54+(1.2×
1.5)=8.70 kN/m
Self-weight of topping and construction w0 +wT +wc=4.34 kN/m404 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Eq. 12.44 End reaction F=(0.5×8.70−0.3125×4.34)×11.2=33.53 kN
Eq. 12.45 a=33.53/8.70=3.85 m, i.e. x=0.344 L
Eq. 12.46 Ms1,max =33.53×3.85−8.70×3.852/2=64.6 kNm.
Note that at mid-span Ms1 =51.3 kNm
Service moment of resistance for the hcu alone MsR =(14.53+3.80)×10.701=196.1 
kNm>64.6 kNm. If the long-term value for σb were used, then MsR =182 kNm.
12.3.4 Deflections in composite slabs
The calculation of deflections in composite slabs differs from non-composite units in the 
following ways
i. second moment of area after the topping has hardened is the transformed composite 
compound value Ic,c,co
ii. creep coefficients for visco-elastic movement are taken after the topping has hardened
iii. if relevant, the effect of propping is to eliminate stage 1 deflection due to the topping 
(zero deflection at the actual position of the prop and small deflections between the 
props and the supports).
Transfer deflections δ1 and δ2, and deflections at installation due to camber and self-weight 
δ3 and δ4 are as for the non-composite unit using Eqs. 10.1–10.5. After installation the static 
deflection due to the self-weight of topping wT
δ5 =+5 wT L4/384 Ecm Ic,co (12.47)
where Ic,co is for the precast unit alone.

The equivalent upward deflection due to single propping at mid-span of the wet insitu
topping is due to the prop reaction force is 0.625 wT L, then
δ6 =−0.625 wT L4/48 Ecm Ic,co (12.48)

δ6 =−wT L4/76.84 Ecm Ic,co (12.49)
Resultant deflection at installation if propped=δ3 +δ4 +δ5 +δ6
In the long-term, imposed dead loads are taken as being applied immediately after instal￾lation at ti
 days). The creep coefficient for the insitu concrete topping is 0.8ψ∞ =2.0 (because 
insitu concrete is fresh at installation). This controls the long-term deflection for imposed 
dead and live loads after the topping has hardened. Note that Ecm for the precast is used, not 
EcmT because Ic,c,co is the transformed section based on Ecm.
Long-term camber is due to camber at installation, plus further visco elastic movement 
based on Ic,c,co minus a reduction due to the reduction in pretensioning force from installa￾tion Ppmi to the long-term Ppo
δ7 =δ3 −[ψ28 Ppmi−(Ppmi−Ppo)] zcp L2/8 Ecm Ic,c,co (12.50)
The long-term deflection δ8 due to the self-weight and infill of the slab w0 is due to the 
previous deflection δ4 plus further visco elastic movement, and the static and visco elastic 
deflections due to topping wT, using a net creep factor ψ∞,t=0.8ψ∞ −ψ1 after installation at 
time t. But, because the former is a function of Ic,c,co and the latter a function of Ic,co before 
hardening of the topping and then Ic,c,co afterwards, this particular creep coefficient is mul￾tiplied by the ratio of the respective second moments of area Ic,co/Ic,c,co
ψ∞,t=(0.8ψ∞ −ψ1) Ic,co/Ic,c,co (12.51)
δ8 =δ4 +5 (ψ∞,t w0 +(1+ψ∞,t) wT) L4/384 Ecm Ic,co (12.52)
The creep coefficients ψ1 and ψ28 are based on the same data used in Section 11.2.1 based on 
the ASSAP Manual (ASSAP 2002).
The deflection δ9 due to imposed dead w2 and quasi-permanent live load ψ2 w3 is
δ9 =+ 5 [(1+ψ28) w2 +(1+0.8ψ∞) ψ2 w3] L4/384 Ecm Ic,c,co (12.53)
There is no effect of creep due to the removal of the prop, i.e. instantaneous downward 
deflection, acting on the composite section is
δ10 =+0.625 wT L4/48 Ecm Ic,c,co for a single prop (12.54a)
δ10 =+wT L4/76.84 Ecm Ic,c,co for twin props (12.54b)
The final deflection δ11 =δ7 +δ8 +δ9 +(δ6 +δ10) (12.55)
The long-term deflection after installation of finishes, otherwise known as ‘movement’, is 
due to imposed live load using 1+ψ28, viscoelastic self-weight and topping using ψ∞,t and 
viscoelastic imposed dead loads using ψ28, and changes in camber. Movement is the greater 
of δ12 or δ13
δ12 =5 [(1+ψ28) ψ2 w3] L4/384 Ecm Ic,c,co (12.56)406 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

The visco-elastic live load deflection due to 1+ψ28 is as explained in Section 11.2.2 and 
based on the composite slab tests by Ibrahim (Elliott and Ibrahim 2006, Ibrahim and Elliott 
2009).
Example 12.5
Calculate the long-term deflection and movement after installation for the 250 mm depth 
hcu with a 75 mm depth topping shown in cross section in Figure 12.9 and designed in 
Example 12.1. The slab is subjected to imposed dead and live loads of 2.0 kN/m2 and 5.0 
kN/m2, respectively. Check the Code’s limits if the floor finishes are brittle.

Figure 12.17 shows the final deflections and movement after installation of finishes for 
Example 12.5.
It is usual for movement after installation to be critical, rather than long-term deflec￾tions. In this example, the ratios of δ13/span/500=0.43 and δ11/span/250=−0.04. The 
major influence is the increased second moment of area Ic,c,co/Ic,co =1.43, reducing the 
deflections after installation or after the topping has hardened from 72.6 mm (non-com￾posite hcu in Example 11.1) to 49.3 mm in this example, in all 23.3 mm. Meanwhile, the 
camber only reduced from −63.2 to −51.0=12.2 mm, a swing of 11.1 mm, such that the 
final deflection reduced by the same amount to −1.7 mm. Note the large influence of the 
camber at installation of −40.9 mm affects both cases.
Example 12.6
Calculate the long-term deflection and movement after installation for the 250 mm depth 
hcu with a 75 mm Vdepth topping shown in cross section in Figure 12.9 and designed 
in Example 12.4, propped at mid-span. Effective span L=11200 mm. Self-weight of top￾ping=2.54 kN/m.
Solution
Ratio of effective span in this example to that in Example 12.5=11.2/9.8=1.143. Then 
for camber is increased by 1.1432 =1.306, and gravity load deflections by 1.1434 =1.706

It is usual for movement after installation to be critical, rather than long-term deflec￾tions. In this example, the ratios of δ13/span/500=0.82 and δ11/span/250=0.26. The for￾mer is 1.9 times that of the unpropped slab in Example 12.5, mainly due to the ratio of 
span4 =1.706 but also that the ratio span2 for camber=1.306, so the visco elastic increase 
in camber is relatively small.
12.3.5 Dual propping of slabs over two storeys
Dual propping of slabs is occasionally carried out, where props are positioned in vertical 
alignment over two floors, as shown in Figure 12.18. Instead of the upper floor prop being 
supported through to a rigid support at the foundation, it is supported on the composite 
slab below. The main reason for doing this is to free up space at the ground floor to allow 
following trades to progress unhindered by the props. Because the composite slab below is 
flexible, the reaction in the upper prop will be smaller than if it were rigidly founded. The 
sequence is as follows:
The prop is erected at the first floor and the insitu topping, of self-weight wT1, is added (Figure 
12.18a). The prop is erected to the soffit of the floor unit at the second floor (Figure 12.18b). 
After about 7 days the insitu topping wT2 is added at the second floor (Figure 12.18c). When 
the topping has hardened the first floor slab is acting compositely (Figure 12.18c). After 
the prop has been removed at the first floor the reaction from the second floor prop R2 is Composite slabs and beams 409
temporarily carried by the composite slab at the first floor (Figure 12.18d). Given that the 
prop foundation at the first floor is flexible (not rigid as at the foundation) and will deflect ∆1
under R2, the reaction in the second floor prop R2 will decrease. This is because the deflection 
of the second floor unit due to the topping alone will be much greater than ∆1.
Assuming initially that the first floor slab is ‘fully rigid’, the reaction from the second floor 
prop R2 =0.625 wT2 L causes a mid-span deflection in the first floor composite slab (general 
term RL3/48EI) of
∆1 =R2 L3/48 Ecm Ic,c,co,1
Then∆1 =0.625 wT2 L L3/48 Ecm Ic,c,co,1 (12.58a)
where Ic,c,co,1 is the transformed, compound second moment of area of the composite slab at 
first floor
The reduction in R2, due to the flexibility in Eq. 12.58a, is re-calculated from the equali￾sation of deflections due to the topping wT2 and the upward reaction R2 plus the shortfall in 
deflection ∆1 as
(5 wT2 L4/384 Ecm Ic,co,2)=(R2 L3/48 Ecm Ic,co,2)+∆1 (12.59)
where Ic,co,2 is the compound second moment of area of the precast unit at second floor
Then R2 =0.625 wT2 L−48 ∆1 Ecm Ic,co,2/L3 (12.60a)
Substituting Eq. 12.58a into Eq. 12.60a gives
Then R2 =0.625 wT2 L [1−(Ic,co,2/Ic,c,co,1)]

Then R2 =0.625 wT2 L (1−α) (12.61a)
This reduced prop force causes a reduced deflection ∆1 requiring iteration of R2 until the 
changes in ∆1 are small, as follows
New ∆1 =[0.625 wT2 L (1−α)] L3/48 Ecm Ic,c,co,1 (12.58b)
Substituting Eq. 12.58b into Eq. 12.60a gives
New R2 =0.625 wT2 L (1−α+α2) (12.61b)
… and so on until the final prop reaction is the common power series
R2 =0.625 wT2 L (1−α+α2 −α3 +α4 −α5 …) (12.61c)
This is calculated in the following example.
The reaction R2 may cause a greater bending moment in the first floor composite slab than 
under service loads, and should be checked, particularly for cracking at the serviceability 
stress. Because the limiting value for permissible tension is limited to fctm for the purpose of 
controlling long-term cracking and deflections, some designers choose to check the tempo￾rary condition using fctm,fl, typically 1.3–1.4 fctm. This applies to all conditions of exposure.
Deeper slabs, and/or reduced spans, at second floor level should be avoided as these will 
reduce the stiffness ratio α and lead to lower prop reactions R2, as shown in the following 
example.
Let the propped composite hcu slab in Example 12.6 be dual-propped over two storeys. 
Using non-composite Ic,co,2 =1296×106 mm4 and composite Ic,c,co,1 =2819.9×106 mm4, the 
stiffness ratio α=1296/2819.9=0.4596 (assuming Ecm is the same for both floors). The prop 
reaction R1 =0.625×2.54×11.2=17.78 kN. After iteration, R2 is given as
Eq. 12.61c. R2 =17.78 (1−0.4596+0.2112−0.0971+0.0446 …)=17.78×0.685=12.18 kN
The mid-span deflection at the first floor due to R2 is ∆1 =12.18×103 ×112003/48×36283
×2819.9×106 =3.5 mm. As the virtual upward deflection of the precast unit at the second 
floor due to the reaction in the prop would have been ∆2 =17.78×103 ×112003/48×36283×
1296×106 =11.1 mm>3.5 mm, the prop reaction R2 decreases. Thus the ratio of the short￾fall in the upward deflection is (11.1−3.5)/11.1=0.685, confirming the calculation for R2. 
The shortfall in the mid-span hogging bending moment due to the second floor prop is 
(17.78−12.18)×11.2/4=15.7 kNm.
The effect of a precast floor unit of greater depth at the second floor is a reduction in 
the prop reaction R2 because the virtual deflection of the precast unit due to the self-weight 
of the topping (assumed to be the same as in the above example) is reduced. For example 
replace the 250 mm depth hcu at second floor with a generically similar 300 mm depth unit, 
where Ic,co,2 =2123×106 mm4. Then α=2123/2819.9=0.753. After iteration using Eq. 12.61c, 
R2 =17.78×0.571=10.14 kN, a reduction of 25% compared with the rigid prop reaction.
12.4 INTERFACE SHEAR STRESS IN COMPOSITE SLABS
12.4.1 Horizontal interface shear stresses
Under the action of vertical flexural shear, the horizontal interface between the precast unit 
and insitu topping will be subjected to an ultimate horizontal shear stress vEdi, as shown in Composite slabs and beams 411
Figures 12.19 and 12.20. Often termed ‘shear flow’, because it is measured in force per linear 
length, this shear derives from the equilibrium of the vertical shear at a section. It is the result 
of imposed, stage 2, loads present only after the insitu concrete topping has hardened. The 
distribution of interface shear is identical to the imposed shear force distribution and must 
therefore be checked at all critical sections. Interface shear need only be checked for the ulti￾mate limit state. The design method is based on partly experimental evidence for the empirical 
terms in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.2.5 (1) and Exp. 6.25, and will ensure that serviceability 
conditions are satisfied. BS EN 1168, Annex F2.3 for hcu refers to this clause.
The texture and surface moisture condition of the precast unit just before receiving con￾crete topping may affect the overall strength of the composite slabs, in particular the inter￾face shear resistance. Ibrahim et al. (Ibrahim et al., 2016) carried out an experimental study 
on the shear-flexure behaviour of 24 no. composite slabs using nominally 1200×150 mm 
depth hcu with 75 mm depth topping. The hcu had different surface roughness (smooth and

rough, as defined in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 6.2.5 (2)) and surface moisture conditions (dry, 
optimum wet and ponded) Figure 12.21. Four tests were carried out for each permutation.
The smooth surface was the original extruded hcu surface while the roughened surface was 
obtained by scraping using a steel brush. The dry surface condition was obtained by leaving 
the hcu in the ambient temperature. The optimum wet, which is the preferred condition as 
mentioned in the FIP document (FIP Recommendations, 1982), was obtained by spraying the 
precast surface with 4.5 L/sq.m. of water and leaving it to dry under ambient temperature until 
the surface colour turned to a lighter dark grey with no excess surface water. The ponded con￾dition was obtained by pouring water until the excess water was left on the surface with a depth 
of approximately 1.8 mm. The surface moisture content was recorded as 12%–13% for the dry 
condition, 26%–28% for optimum wet condition and 41%–43% for ponding condition.
The composite slabs were tested using a single point load at 2.5 hs, about 562 mm where 
hs is the total depth of the slab. The results for the experimental shear capacity Vu at the fail￾ure of the interface are given in Table 12.3, showing the influence of the surface conditions. 
The ratio for Vu for dry/optimum wet condition is 0.91 and 0.71 for the smooth and rough 
surface, respectively. Table 12.3 also shows the calculated interface shear stress, based on 
the equation vui=Vu/bi
 z, where bi
 is the width of the interface (in this case the measured 
width of the hcu, on average 1184 mm) and z is the lever arm between the tendons in the 
bottom of the hcu and the centre of the compression depth in the topping, on average 193 
mm. For the optimum wet condition, vui is 0.75 N/mm2 for the smooth, extruded surface 
profile. This may be compared with the value for vRdi=c fctdT given in BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 
6.2.5 (2). For an as-cast surface profile the cohesion factor c=0.2, and for fckT =25 N/mm2, 
vRdi=0.2×1.20=0.24 N/mm2, or 3 times less than vui in the tests. Figure 12.22a plots the 
values for vui for rough and smooth profiles, where the benefit of the optimum wet condition 
may be seen. The graph also shows design values for vRdi using fckT =20–40 N/mm2.
The same data are normalised in Figure 12.22b with respect to fctdT obtained from the 
measured cube strength of the topping, by calculating the experimental cohesion factor

c=vui/fctdT, for example in the optimally wet smooth surface where fckT =26.2 N/mm2, 
then c=0.75/1.235=0.61. Allowing for scatter in the results the characteristic value for 
c=0.57>0.2 by a factor of 2.85. However, for the optimally wet rough surface where 
fckT =33.0 N/mm2, then c=1.05/1.436=0.73 and the characteristic value c=0.66>0.4 by a 
factor of only 1.65. In all the 24 experimental values for c were greater than the design 
values for the smooth and rough surfaces by a ratio of 2.86 and 1.64, respectively, show￾ing that the figure of c=0.2 for smooth is very conservative, and c=0.4, when allowing for 
experimental scatter and a factor of safety on the experimental results, is satisfactory. Note 
that the original version of clause 6.2.5 published in 2004 has c=0.35, in which case the 
above ratio would be 1.63, roughly as expected?
Providing that the insitu topping is fully bonded to the precast unit, full interaction is 
assumed, i.e. there is no relative slippage between the two concretes. The horizontal shear 
force Fc,T at the interface is equal to the total force in the insitu topping due to stage 2 
imposed loads. It is therefore necessary to have carried out a calculation for the ultimate 
limit state in flexure and to have determined the depth to the neutral axis Xc before this 
is attempted. (This is a benefit from having carried out a two-stage approach to ultimate 
flexure.)
The section is flexurally uncracked at the support where the interface shear is a maxi￾mum. Therefore, only stage 2 loads, after hardening of the topping, contribute to vEdi. Let 
MEd2 =maximum ultimate moment due to stage 2 loads, including dead and live point and 
line loads. Then
FcT =0.567 fckT bi

Fc,T only acts at the point of maximum bending moment – elsewhere it is less than this and 
may even change sign in continuous elements. Therefore, the distance over which this force 
is distributed along the span of the floor is taken as the distance from the maximum to the 
zero or minimum moment.

the time of erection, the preferred sequence, and the structural topping is cast at a later date. 
As this sequence is often unknown at the design stage it is wiser to use the actual width, 
rather than the nominal width.
vEdi is then distributed in accordance with the magnitude of the vertical shear VEd at any 
section.

and 45° legs, the parallel component is (0.6 × 0.707 + 0.6 × 0.707 + 0.707) As = 1.55 As, as 
opposed to 2.0 As for a 90° loop.
Exp. 6.25 is at odds with Annex C2 because the leg leaning away from the direction of 
the interface force has the component cos α, where in Annex C2 it does not, but the above 
calculation gives the same result if there was the cos αʹ term in Exp. 6.25 and it is ignored.
The distribution of As should respond to the distribution of VEd as shown in BS EN 1992-

but not less than As,min = 0.13% or 0.26 fctmT/fyk of the thru-depth contact area as the bars 
are required for confinement. The horizontal contact area is not used as this leads to a 
huge area, e.g. for 1200 mm wide units As,min = 0.13%× 1200 × 1000 = 1560 mm2/m requir￾ing H12 loops at 145 mm spacing! The reinforcement should be adequately anchored on 
both sides of the interface. If loops are used, as shown in Figure 12.24, the clear space 
beneath the bend should be at least 5 mm + size of aggregate. The spacing of links should 
not be too large, 1.20–1.50 m being typical for hcu. If vEdi < vRdi no interface shear rein￾forcement is required, although some contractors choose to place H10 or H12 loops (as 
shown in Figure 12.24) at about 1200 mm spacing anyway. The loops should pass over 
the top of the bars in the structural topping and be concreted into the joints between the 
precast units.

12.5 COMPOSITE BEAMS
12.5.1 Internal beams
Internal beams are usually symmetrically loaded, i.e. floor slabs are on both sides of the 
beam, and therefore the beam is symmetrical in cross section as shown in Figures 2.7 and 
6.9. The limiting design criterion is often minimum depth in order to maximise headroom 
and reduce the drop beam, or ‘downstand’ depth defined in Figure 6.9. For this reason, 
internal beams are often pretensioned to maximise their structural performance. To mini￾mise the downstand, part of the beam may be recessed within the depth of the floor slab, 
giving rise to the so-called ‘inverted-tee’ beam. Internal beams may be designed compositely, 
with the floor slab acting as a compression flange.
There is great potential for designing composite beams as continuous, as shown in 
Figure 12.25 where the negative moment of resistance is achieved by passing rebars 
through slots in columns, or as shown in Figure 12.26 placing the bars in the gap between 
single-story columns.Composite slabs and beams 419

12.5.2 Composite prestressed concrete beam design
Composite action in psc beams is achieved in exactly the same manner as described in 
Section 12.2 for psc slabs. However, there is potential for greater enhancement in the 
flexural capacity of composite beams than with composite slabs because of the greatly 
increased section modulus at the top of the beam. This is because the neutral axis in the 
composite section is near to the top of the beam, and as seen in Example 12.8 the need 
to render the beam flexurally ‘balanced’ or ‘under reinforced’ is important. Shear design 
is not carried out using the composite properties where hcu alone are used, particularly 
at edge columns where, unlike flexural behaviour, the composite section may not be fully 
effective at the face of the support, although the term for Ic,c bw/Sc,c in Eq. 12.38 may be 
calculated from the width of the beam and total composite depth of construction, par￾ticularly in rectangular beams. Another reason for this is where floor slabs are notched 
around columns and the insitu infill is not active with the precast unit. However, com￾posite design may be used at internal columns where hcu are continuous at the face of the 
support (see Example 12.10).
The composite section will be effective where precast-insitu half-slab is used. A two-stage 
approach is used, similar to Eq. 12.37, where the shear stress due to stage 1 vEd1 =VEd1 Sc/
bw Ic is subtracted from the principal stress in stage 2 according to Section 12.3.2.4 and Eq. 
12.38. Deflections are significantly reduced in composite beams due to the greater Ic,c values 
in the composite section.
Composite action in beams is not considered where double-tee floor slabs or thermal slabs 
are used, or where solid psc slabs are used without a structural topping. If hcu are used 
without a structural topping the top flange is formed by placing tie steel into a number of 
top opened hollow cores, known as ‘slots’, typically 3–5 per 1200 mm wide (depending on 
the number of cores in the hcu)×500 to 600 mm in length (depending on the diameter of the 
tie bars, 10 or 12 mm, respectively). For example in a 11 core unit, 5 slots could be filled, 
that would effectively form a continuous flange even though 6 cores were blocked off at their 
ends. Similarly for 6 cores 3 slots could be filled.
Figure 12.27 shows a composite beam test being carried out on an inverted-tee beam and 
hcu. It was found that the effective width of the floor was at least 1.0 m wide in spite of the 
fact that the floor section includes many empty hollow cores. The resulting span-to-depth 
ratio for this type of construction varies from about 15:1 to 22:1 for typical floor loads (15 
kN/m2 ultimate) and floor spans (6–10 m). Figure 2.36 shows load v span graphs for 600 
mm wide inverted tee beams made composite with 200 mm depth hcu and 1 m wide insitu
infill in the cores.
The precast-insitu interface must be reinforced. If the interface is horizontal (e.g. above a 
rectangular or I beam) the options for projecting loops or dowels are as shown in Figure 
12.28. If the interface is vertical (e.g. inverted-tee beam) the options are shown in Figure 
12.29. Factory cast projecting bars are bent upwards for transportation and fixing and later 
bent down on site into the opened cores of the hcu, Figure 12.29a, or site placed through 
holes in the upstand, Figure 12.19b. For shallow upstands, or deeper slabs, projecting links 
or additional loops may project into the insitu infill above the beam, which should have a 
roughened surface profile, as shown in Figure 12.29c, where the depth of the insitu infill 
should be at least 75–100 mm (depending on the size of the beam, etc.) as it is not possible 
to generate the necessary compressive force in the small quantity of insitu concrete in this 
region.Composite slabs and beams 421

12.5.3 Serviceability limit state of composite beams
As with composite slab design, Section 12.2, service and ultimate stresses are checked at two 
stages of loading (or three if a structural topping is added to the floor) and superimposed elas￾tically. Figure 12.30 shows either a two-stage or three-stage design: (i) precast beam alone, 
(ii) precast beam with insitu infill into the top opened cores of hcu, and (iii) stage 2 plus insitu
structural topping. If a structural topping is used the loading conditions are as follows
Stage Loading Section properties based on
1 Self-weight of beam and dry floor slab Precast beam only
2 As stage 1 plus self-weight of topping As stage 1 plus insitu infill near the beam
3 Superimposed dead and live As stage 2 plus topping
Stage I stresses exist in the precast beam only, Figure 12.30a. These are the result of prestress, 
elastic shortening and short-term relaxation, self-weight of the beam, precast floor units and 
wet concrete. Stage 2 stresses exist in the precast beam and insitu infill, Figure 12.30b, and 
are due to the self-weight of the topping, Figure 12.30c. Stage 3 stresses in the composite 
beam, Figure 12.30d are in addition to that mentioned earlier and are the result of superim￾posed, services and partition loading, differential shrinkage and the total creep relaxation 422 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

after hardening of the insitu concrete. Eqs. 12.1, 12.2 and 12.13–12.15 are appropriate, 
except that if a structural topping is included Eqs. 12.13 and 12.14 are modified to
fb =σb −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2/Zb,c,co −Ms3/Zb,c3,co >−fctm (12.73a)
ft=σt+Ms1/Zt,co +Ms2/Zt,c,co +Ms3/Zt,c3,co <0.45 fck (12.74)
where Ms3 and Zb,c3,co and Zt,c3,co are the design moment and section moduli for stage 3.
As before the limit −fctm in Eq. 12.13a only applies to XC1. For XC2 to XC4 and XD1/
XS1 the limiting tension is zero and Ms3 is replaced by Ms3,qp and Ms3,freq is for the quasi￾permanent and frequent imposed loads, respectively. Then
fb =σb −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2/Zb,c,co −Ms3,qp/Zb,c3,co >0 (12.73b)
fb =σb −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2/Zb,c,co −Ms3,freq/Zb,c3,co >0 (12.73c)
For 2 stages MsR,c=[(σb +fctm −Ms1/Zb,co) Zb,c,co]+Ms1 (12.75)
For 3 stages MsR,c=[(σb +fctm −Ms1/Zb,co −Ms2/Zb,c,co) Zb,c3,co]+Ms1 +Ms2 (12.76)

The effective width of the top flange beff for the insitu topping or for half-slab (precast 
unit with structural topping) is calculated as Eq. 12.6, but b (on either side of the top of the 
beam of width bw) is determined from BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 5.3.2.1 (3), Figs. 5.2 and 5.3, 
and Exp. 5.7, 5.7a and 5.7b as
Exp. 5.7a b=0.2 b1 +0.1 lo ≤0.2 lo (12.77)
where for simply supported beams lo =effective span L, and b1 is the clear spacing between 
beams.
For example for a rectangular beam of 400 mm width at 6.0 m column centres, and 
with a span L=8.0 m, on either side of the beam b=0.2×5600+0.1×8000=1920 
mm≤0.2×8000=1600 mm. If floor slabs are on both sides total b=400+2×1600=3600 
mm. The rule of thumb used to be ¼ span on either side of the beam, then b=4000 mm.
Note that for two-stage precast design, if the upstand of the beam (e.g. inverted-tee beams) 
extends level with the topping, bw is discounted as the beam is already in compression from 
stage 1 loads.
For hcu with top opened cores, known as ‘slots’ b is equal to the total length of the slots, plus 
any infill between the ends of the hcu, as shown in Figures 12.28 and 12.29. For example for 
a rectangular beam of 400 mm width supporting hcu with 100 mm bearing length and with 
600 mm length slots, b=400–2×100+2×600=1400 mm. If fckT =25 N/mm2 and fck =45 
N/mm2, beff=1400×31476/36283=1214 mm (an alternative is beff=1400×(33/53)0.3 =1214 
mm). The depth of the top flange is equal to the depth of the insitu filled hollow cores, typi￾cally h -30 to 40 mm, where h is the depth of the hcu.
12.5.4 Ultimate limit state of flexure in composite beams
The ultimate moment of resistance MRd,c is calculated as per Section 9.4.1, i.e. by using itera￾tion of the strains, stresses and forces in the tendons in each row in the beam, until the depth 
to the neutral axis converges with the initial assumption. Because the compression is in the 
top flange of either the topping or the infill in top opened cores in hcu, Eq. 8.49 is modified to
Fc=0.567 fckT beff 0.8X in the topping (12.78a)
Fc=0.567 fcki beff 0.8X in the infilled cores (12.78b)
It is also calculated in a two-stage design as per Section 12.3.2.3, except that if a structural 
topping is included the moment if resistance due to stages 2 and 3 are combined (the dif￾ference compared with separate calculation for the two stages is negligible), such that the 
subscripts 2 become 2,3 (= stages 2 and 3 combined). To calculate the total MRd,c in a beam 
with multiple rows of tendons it is not possible to simply subtract Ap1 from ApT because the 
final strains, stresses and forces are summated for each row of tendons. It is therefore neces￾sary to calculate the equivalent area of each tendon to be subtracted, as follows
Let MEd1 =stage 1 ultimate design moment
K1 =MEd1/fck b1 d1
2 (12.79)
where b1 =width of precast unit, d1 =effective depth from top of precast unit
z1 =[0.5+√(0.25−K1/1.134)] d1 ≤0.95 d1 (12.80)
X1 =(d1 −z1)/0.4 (12.81)
If 0.8X1 ≤hft the depth of the top flange426 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
then Ap1 =MEd1/z1 fp1 (12.82)
Fig 3.10 where fp1 =stress in tendons at strain εs=0.02
The equivalent area subtracted from each tendon is Ap’=Ap1/N, where N is the total number of 
tendons contributing to ApT. The net area per row is required in the analysis because the final 
compatibility strains and stresses are required per row (see Example 12.9 and Table 12.4b).
The final ultimate stress in the tendons fp is calculated from the net area ApT2=ApT −Ap1
Referring to Figure 12.31, the effective depth to the tendons is d2 =d1 +hs+t, where hs and t
are the depths of slab and topping, respectively. Then without topping, e.g. hcu with filled 
top opened cores
MRd,c=fp ApT2 (d2 −dn2)+MEd1 (12.83a)
where MRd,c is the total moment of resistance for stage 2 added to the stage 1 MEd1.
If a topping is added to the infill in the slabs, then
MRd,c=fp ApT2 (d2 −dn2,3)+MEd1 (12.83b)
where MRd,c is for stages 2 and 3 added to MEd1.
The effective width of the flange bef is based on the full depth of the insitu topping or the 
full depth of the hcu if slots in top opened cores are used. If the two-stage design is carried out 
bef does not include the width of the beam, which is consumed in stage 1 (see Example 12.9).
The width of the beam can be made as wide as possible, in some cases 1200 mm as shown 
in Figure 12.32 where the precast beam in this photograph is acting essentially as a per￾manent shuttering to hcu. The rebar girder acts as a bending truss to carry the self-weight 
of the beam and floor slabs until insitu concrete is placed over the top of the beam to form 
a composite section. To further increase the moment capacity of the beam and reduce the 
mid-span sagging moment, continuity reinforcement is placed in the top of the rebar girder, 
and passes through the column, thus producing a hogging moment of resistance equal to the 
sagging moment. In cases such as these the columns are usually discontinuous at the floor 
level, which leaves space for the continuity reinforcement.

The infill is fcki=25 N/mm2. Exposure class is XC1. Draw the service bending moment

The effective span of the beam is 8.50 m. The self-weight of the beam=7.688 kN/m, 
floor slab=18.0 kN/m, other dead loads=10.0 kN/m and imposed live load=45.0 kN/m 
(increased from 30 kN/m in the non-composite beam). Geometric and material data given 
by the manufacturer and/or derived in Example 7.10 are as follows

Zt,co =25.351×106 mm3, fck =45 N/mm2, Ecm =36283 N/mm2, Ap =26×93=2418 mm2 and 
zcp =92.86 mm. For the insitu infill fcki=25 N/mm2 and Ecmi=31476 N/mm2.
Use the same pretensioning data as in Example 7.10, where the final prestress at mid￾span is σb =15.13 N/mm2 and σt=-1.22 N/mm2.

Top ft=−1.22+9.15+7.17=+15.10 N/mm2 <0.45 fck =20.25 N/mm2
The additional moment capacity available, due to the additional stress at the bottom 
of fb −fctm =−3.21−(−3.80)=+0.59 N/mm2, is MsR,2 −Ms2 =0.59×45.076×106 ×10−6 =26.6 
kNm. By inspection the top stress is not critical as MsR,c=1085 kNm.
Eq. 12.18 MsR,c=496.7+26.6+232.0=755.3 kNm>Ms=232.0+496.7=728.7 kNm.
Note that MsR,c=755.3>599.7 kNm is 26% greater than for the non-composite beam 
in Example 7.10. The additional volume of insitu concrete used in the slots in the hcu is 
effectively free of charge because the infill and tie steel is required for other purposes, e.g. 
horizontal diaphragm action and stability ties for robustness.
Figure 12.34 shows the service design moments Ms and the service moments of resis￾tance MsR,c for Example 12.8. Note the reduction in MsR,c as the stage 1 stresses increase 
towards mid-span. At the supports, where Ms=0, MsR,c is due to fctm and the compound 
composite section modulus Zb,c,co. Then MsR,c=3.80×45.076=171.3 kNm. From there to 
x=lpt2, the end of the transmission length, MsR,c increases linearly.Composite slabs and beams 429

including the effects of bond anchorage at the supports.
Solution
In the non-composite beam in Example 9.5 the number of strands contributing to the 
tension force is 22, i.e. the 2 strands in the top of the beam and 2 strands in the top of the 
boot do not contribute as X=319 mm. For the composite beam the neutral axis will be 
higher and it is likely that X will be about half this value≈160 mm as beff is found to be 
2 times greater but the forces in the active strands will be about 25% greater. Therefore, 
the first estimate of X is found by considering an extra 2 strands (in the top of the boot) 
giving NT =24 strands. The axis distance to these strands is ys=145 mm.
For the two-stage design, stage 1 MEd1 =1.25*×232.0=290.0 kN (from Example 12.8). 
*γG =1.25 is used as it is later shown that Exp. 610(b) in BS EN 1990 (BS EN 1990) is 
critical.

The average equivalent area is ′ Ap =460/24=19.2 mm2
The net area per strand=93−19.2=73.8 mm2
Then ′ ApT =24×73.8=1771.2 mm2
Taking an initial stress of 70%×1770 N/mm2, Fp =1771.2×1239×10−3 =2196 kN.
The effective width in stage 2 is bef=(25/45)×1300=722 mm
Assume first the neutral axis (NA) depth is in the top flange, X=2196×103/0.567×45×
722×0.8=149.0 mm<200 mm, then NA is in the top flange as follows
Prestrain at mid-span εpo =989.5/195000=0.005074
Considering strands in bottom row 1 at d=550 mm, εp1 =0.005074+0.0035×[(550/14
9.0)−1]=0.014498
fp1 =1313+10186×0.014498=1461 N/mm2
Table 12.4a completes the calculation of the initial strains, stresses and forces using 
X=149.0 mm for 6 rows of strands that are below the neutral axis.
The total force in 24 strands is now Fp =2548 kN
X=2548×103/0.567×45×722×0.8=172.8 mm such that εp1 =0.012712 and fp1 =1442

Table 12.4b completes the calculation of the final strains, stresses and forces. Finally

MRd,c=1418×1771.2×388.2×10−6 +290.0=1265.4kNm
The ultimate design load wEd =max{1.35×(7.688+18.0+10.0)+1.05×45.0; 1.25×(7.688+
18.0+10.0)+1.5×45.0}=112.1 kN/m
MEd =112.1×8.52/8=1012.1 kNm<1265.4 kNm.
The ratio MEd/MRd,c=0.80, compared with the service ratio Ms/MsR =0.96, so clearly the 
serviceability state of stress is critical, a feature common with composite beams, particu￾larly in shallower beams with fewer tendons.
Not included in this example but worthy of comment, the situation at the support, 
where MEd1 =0, provides some information required for the horizontal interface shear 
reinforcements between the upstand of the beam and insitu infill in the slots. Here 
beff=722+350=1072 mm, ApT =24×93=2322 mm2, εpo =0.004889, and following the 
same equations for equilibrium and compatibility of strains, the final results is d=456 mm, 
X=146 mm, z=397 mm, fp =1437 N/mm2 and MRd,c=1273.9 kNm. It is not overlooked 
that the difference between MRd,c at the support and mid-span is only 8.5 kNm, less than 
would be expected based on the design of composite floor slabs, but it appears that the 
greater effective depth of strands in beams makes this particular calculation more robust.
Figure 12.34 shows the ultimate design moments MEd and the ultimate moments of 
resistance MRd,c for Example 12.9. Close to the supports where the bond strength between 
the tendons and concrete is developing over an ultimate anchorage length lbpd =1.375 m 
(see Section 9.5) the value of MRd is increasing bi-linearly from zero at the support.
12.5.5 Ultimate limit state of shear in composite beams
The ultimate shear capacities VRd,c,c and VRd,cr,c for composite beams are calculated as per 
Sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 for the basic equations for capacity, together with the two-stage 
design given in Section 12.3.2.4 for composite slab construction. Shear capacity is checked 
at two positions in the beam – at the centroidal axis of the composite beam and, in the case 
of inverted-tee beams, at the intersection (known as the ‘intersection’) of the upstand and 
boot. For I beams the critical section is in the narrow webs. Then
Eq. 12.37 vEd1 =VEd1 Sc/bw Ic (12.37)
where VEd1 =ultimate dead load acting on the beam, including self-weight of the precast unit 
and insitu infill
Sc=first moment of area at the narrowest point in the webs, taken as the centroidal axis 
of the composite beam at height yb,c (not at the centroid of the precast beam yb because 
stage 2 shear stress is to be added at yb,c, or at the intersection of the upstand and boot 
about the composite beam at height yb,c
Eq. 12.38 VRd,c,c2 =Ic,c bw/Sc,c [√(fctd2 +αl σcp fctd)−vEd1] (12.38)
Eq. 12.39 VRd,c,c=VRd,c,c2 +VEd1 (12.39)
where Sc,c=first moment of area at the centroidal axis of the composite beam at yb,c, or at 
the intersection
σcp =prestress at the centroidal axis of the composite beam, or at the intersection
All other terms as per Section 12.3.2.4.432 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
For the flexurally cracked section VRd,cr,c the equations are as per Section 10.3.2 except 
that the composite effective depth, or with a topping d+t, replaces d. Use VRd,cr,c where 
Ms>cracking moment of resistance Mcr,c as
Eq. 12.41 Mcr,c=(σb +fctd) Zb,c,co −Ms1 [(Zb,c,co/Zb,co)−1)] (12.41)
Example 12.10
Calculate VRd,c,c and VRd,cr,c for the composite inverted-tee beam in Example 12.8 and 
using beam section properties from Example 10.6. The floor slab comprises hcu that are 
continuous across the face of the support of the beam, with insitu infill in slots in top 
opened cores. The bearing length may be taken as 200 mm. Check the capacity at (i) 
centroidal axis and (ii) intersection of the upstand and boot.

clearly not critical.434 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
12.5.6 Interface shear in composite beams
The integrity of composite construction relies on the long-term continuity between the pre￾cast and insitu concrete. Composite beams are designed with interface shear links, dowel 
bars or other similar mechanical fasteners. Shear friction alone is not recommended for 
beams. The ultimate interface shear stress vEdi is checked for the uncracked section against 
vRdi values in BS EN 1992-1-1, clauses 6.2.5 (1) and (2).
Exp. 6.24 vEdi=(Fc,T/Fc) VEd2/z2 bi (12.84)
Exp. 6.25 vRdi=c fctd +μ As fyd/Aj≤0.5 ν fcd (12.85)
where Fc,T =compression in slab or slab & topping due to ultimate stage 2 loading
Fc=total compression in slab and precast beam due to ultimate stage 2 loading
VEd2 =stage 2 ultimate vertical shear force at the support (not on shear plane)
z2 =lever arm from tendons to the centroid of the compression zone due to stage 2 loads
bi=interface contact length=horizontal gap width between ends of slabs for rectangular 
beams or I beams with no upstand, or 2 x upstand depth for inverted tee beams, see 
Figure 12.29
As=area interface shear reinforcement
Aj=area of interface joint
c and μ are defined in Section 12.4.1
Note that for inverted-tee or I beams having an upstand, for smooth and rough surfaces 
where the interface plane is in the vertical sides of the upstand in flexural conditions, the 
term c fctd is ignored because the end of the slab is subjected to end rotation, causing cracks 
in at least in the upper part of the interface. This does not apply to an indented surface 
(Figure 12.23) where the depth of the shear key is at least 5 mm. Neither is it the case for 
rectangular beams where the interface plane is horizontal.
Further, Eq. 12.85 does not include the contribution from the shear friction of the floor 
units acting on the bearing ledges of the beams, and in this respect it is conservative (see 
Example 12.10) even though shear friction is generally ignored in the interface between 
beams and slabs.
Nominal interface shear bars should always be provided. The minimum area is the greater 
of As,min/Aj=0.13% or 0.26 fctmi/fyk of the contact area, or, if the depth of slab is greater than 
the upstand As,min/Aj=0.13% or 0.26 fctmi/fyk of the slab area, where fctmi is for the insitu
infill. If vEdi>vRdi typically about 0.3–0.5 N/mm2, horizontal bars are provided projecting 
from the upstand, or U loops or links projecting from the top of the upstand and lapped to 
horizontal bars projecting into the infill in floor units or the topping. See Figure 12.29. The 
area of dowels links or loops that are perpendicular to the interface is
As=vEdi bi
/μ 0.87 fyk (mm2/mm) (12.86)
Horizontal bars act in dowel action serving to restrain lateral tensile strains. The distribu￾tion of the bars may be stepped, as shown in BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 6.10, usually in not more 
than one step between the designed and minimum areas of As,min. If the designed spacing is 
more than about 600 mm it is not worth the possible confusion of changing the spacing, and 
certainly the opposite ends of the same beam should not be different (without good cause). 
The spacing of the bars into hcu should not be more than 300 mm and preferably in alter￾nate opened cores, e.g. 5 no. for 11 cores per 1.2 m width (try to avoid opening the first and 
last edge cores), 4 no. for 7 to 9 cores, and all cores opened for 6 cores.Composite slabs and beams 435
Example 12.11
Calculate the interface shear reinforcement necessary to satisfy the ultimate horizontal 
shear force at the precast – insitu interface for the inverted-tee beam shown in cross sec￾tion in Figure 12.33 and designed in Example 12.9. Use fcki=25 N/mm2 for the insitu
infill and fyk =500 N/mm2 for the interface shear reinforcement. The upstand of the beam 
has vertical shear keys conforming to Figure 12.23.
Solution
Stage 1 MEd1 =290 kNm (from Example 12.9)
Stage 2 MEd2 =1012.1–290.0=722.1 kNm
The actual width of the insitu infill b=1300 mm and d2 =455.7 mm
K2 =722.1×106/(25×1300×4562)=0.107; then z2 =406.7 mm
X2 =120 mm; 0.8 X2 <200 mm, then FcT/Fc=1.0
VEd2 =80.0×8.5/2=340.0 kN
The interface ‘width’ is now the depth of the upstand on both sides of the beam, 
b=2×200=400 mm
Eq. 12.69 vEdi=1.00×340.0×103/400×406.7=2.09 N/mm2 >0.60 N/mm2
where for an indented profile c=0.5 and μ=0.9
Eq. 12.70 vRdi=0.5×1.20=0.60 N/mm2 but<4.50 N/mm2, use interface bars (not loops)
Minimum area is the greater of 0.13%×1000×200=260 mm2/m or 0.26×2.56×1000×
200/500=266 mm2/m in each side of the upstand
Eq. 12.72As=1000×(2.09-0.6)×200/(0.9×0.87×500)=760 mm2/m run in each side of 
the upstand. The area required per 1200 mm width hcu is 1.2×760=912 mm2. Trialing 
H12 bars (113 mm2 per bar) the number of bars required is n=912/113=8.1. The project￾ing length of the bar is notionally 40 diameters=480 mm which fits comfortably into a 
600 mm long slot without the need for an end hook.
The spacing of the slots in the top opened cores depends on the generic type of hcu 
used, i.e. for 11 cores the spacing is a multiple of 100 mm, for 9 cores it is about 120 mm 
and for 6 cores it is about 180 mm. For 11 and 9 cores, typically 60 to 90 mm wide, only 
one bar is provided per core. For 6 cores, typically 140 mm wide two bars per core are 
provided.
Therefore a 6 core hcu would require 9 bars with 1 or 2 bars in each alternate slot 
(about 80 mm spacing where 2 bars are provided). An 11 core hcu would require 9 bars 
in all the interior slots.
The minimum number of bars per unit is n=1.2×266/113=2.8. Therefore, provide 3 
no. bars at a distance along the span from the support where
Eq. 12.85 vEdi=(0.5×1.20)+[0.9×266×0.87×500/(200×1000)]=1.12 N/mm2, 
Eq. 12.84 VEd2 =1.12×406.7×200×10−3 =91.1 kN
As the gradient of the stage 2 shear force is 80.0 kN/m, this occurs at 91.1/80.0=1.14 m 
from mid-span, or x=8.5/2−1.14=3.11 m from the support.
In between at x=1.56 m from the support VEd2 =(340.0+91.1)/2=215.6 kN, vEdi=1.32 
N/mm2 and As=370 mm2/m in each side of the upstand. Then n=1.2×370/113=3.9. 
Therefore, provide 4 no. bars per hcu from 1.56 to 3.11 m from the support.436 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
12.5.7 Propping of composite beams
The basic concept for propping composite sections before the insitu concrete is added is as 
given in Section 12.3.3 for floors. The potential for structural enhancement is much greater 
for psc beams than in floors because the stresses due to the self-weight of the floor slab, 
insitu infill and topping are reduced by the use of 2 or 3 props. The props are added after 
the beam is positioned, before the slabs are installed, and therefore the stresses due to the 
self-weight of the beam are calculated for the unpropped span.
It is worthwhile propping beams of over 6 m to 10 m span with 2 or 3 props, respectively, 
particularly if a structural screed is being used and the ratio of the composite properties to 
the basic section properties exceeds 1.50. Propping increases beam erection time by about 
15% to 25%, and so the delicate balance between material saving and time lost on site has 
to be considered. Only the precast manufacturer can give exact information on this.
Let w0 =self-weight of beam, w1 =self-weight of precast floor units plus wet concrete infill 
and (if present) structural topping, and w2 =imposed loads (all beam loads, e.g. kN/m). For 
a single prop at mid-span the reaction R=0.625 w1 L. The negative moment=−0.625 w1
L2/4=−0.15625 w1 L2. The various service moments at mid-span are
Msw =+0.125 w0 L2 (12.87)
Ms1 =(0.125−0.15625) w1 L2 =−0.03125 w1 L2 (12.88)
Ms2 =+0.15625 w1 L2 +0.125 w2 L2 (12.89)
Alternatively, the serviceability moment of resistance MsR2 at the bottom and top fibres may 
be calculated in the same manner as in Section 12.3.3.1, Eqs. 12.42 and 12.43 for a single 
prop at mid-span as
MsR2 =(fctm +σb) Zb,c,co −[(Msw +Ms1) (Zb,c,co/Zb,co)]−0.15625 w1 L2 (12.90)
MsR2 =(0.45 fck −σt
) Zt,c,co −[(Msw +Ms1) (Zt,c,co/Zt,co)]−0.15625 w1 L2 (12.91)
Total MsR,c=Minimum MsR2 +(Msw +Ms1) (12.92)
but where in Eq. 12.92 Msw +Ms1 =(w0 +w1) L2/8, i.e. the negative moment due to the prop 
is not included twice.
If the prop is first erected beneath the beam and takes the full reaction from the self￾weight, then Ms0 is zero and
Ms1 =−0.03125 (w0 +w1) L2 (12.93)
Ms2 =+ 0.15625 (w0 +w1) L2 +0.125 w2 L2 (12.94)
However, if the prop is set level with the supports, and the beam is cambered upwards due to 
the net effect of eccentric prestress and self-weight, that part of the self-weight which brings 
the beam down to a horizontal level (until the beam becomes flat with zero camber) will 
not be resisted by the prop, and so Eq. 12.91 will not include the full w0. Let the proportion 
of w0 needed to cause zero deflection equal β w0. Then, if the prestress (causing negative 
deflection) and creep coefficient at installation is Ppmi and φ(ti
,t0) and the prop is at mid-span
−Ppmi zcp L2 φ(ti
,to)/8 Ecm Ic,co +5 β w0 L4 φ(ti
,t0)/384 Ecm Ic,co =0Composite slabs and beams 437
Then β w0 =9.6 Ppmi zcp/L2 (12.95)
The resulting prestress requirements are
σb =(Msw +Ms1)/Zb,co −Ms2/Zb,c,co −fctm (at bottom) (12.96)
σt=0.45 fck −(Msw +Ms1)/Zt,co +Ms2/Zt,c,co (at top) (12.97)
However, due to the sagging moment either side of the prop the critical position in the span 
is usually at about x=0.45 L, as shown in Example 12.12. The effect is obviously more 
noticeable for shallower beams with deeper slabs, and/or deeper topping, resulting in a 
greater prop force.
Example 12.12
Calculate the serviceability moment of resistance MsR,c for the composite inverted tee 
beam in Example 12.8, as shown in cross section in Figure 6.10 (without debonded 
strands) and Figure 12.33 using a prop at mid-span. The beam is propped during install￾ing the precast floor units and casting the infill in slots in top opened cores. Calculate the 
increased imposed live load made possible by propping. Draw the final bending moment 
and show where the critical stress for the effect of the prop is located.
Solution
Stage 1
Service load due to self-weight of precast beam plus wet insitu infill slab=7.69 and 18.0 
kN/m. Stage 1 mid-span service moment is from Eqs. 12.87 and 12.88
Msw +Ms1 =0.125×7.69×8.52-0.03125×18.0×8.52 =28.8 kNm
Note that the maximum stage 1 moment occurs at x=2.38 m (x/L=0.28) from the sup￾port and is Ms1 =73.28 kNm. However, this point is not critical when stage 2 loads are 
added.
Stage 2. Prop removed
Eq. 12.90 MsR2 =(3.80+15.13)×45.076−28.8×45.076/31.683−203.3=609.1 kNm
Eq. 12.91 MsR2 = (20.25 − −1.22) × 69.278 − 28.8 × 69.278/25.351 − 203.3 = 1205.3 
kNm>609.1 kNm
The stage 1 moment due to self-weight loads (without prop force)=25.69×8.52/8=232.0 
kNm,
Eq. 12.92 MsR,c=609.1+232.0=841.1 kNm
The allowable imposed load=8 MsR2/L2 =8×609.1/8.52 =67.4 kN/m, and the imposed live 
load 67.4−10.0=57.4 kN/m>45.0 kNm in Example 12.8. Note that MsR,c=841.1>755.3 
kNm is 11% greater than for the unpropped composite beam in Example 12.8.
Alternatively, using the previous service loading the effective span may be increased to 
9.12 m, an extra 0.62 m for the cost of installing a single prop.
Many contractors prefer to use two props, each at ⅓ span, giving greater assurance in 
case the foundation for a single prop is not completely rigid. As there is a small sagging 438 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
moment between the two props MsR,c will be less than for a single prop. If two props were 
used in Example 12.12 then MsR,c=822.4 kNm<841.1 kNm, 2% less.
Figure 12.35 shows the service design moments and the moments of resistance for 
Example 12.12. Note the reduction in MsR,c towards mid-span, seen in Figure 12.34 for 
the unpropped beam, is eliminated by propping, in fact MsR,c at mid-span is now greater 
than near to the support.
It is just possible to discern from the graphs of Ms and MsR,c that the critical position 
is a short distance from mid-span, in this example at x=4.08 m from the support, where 
MsR,c=837.8 kNm, or 3.3 kNm less than at mid-span. To obtain this accurate figure this 
point in the span must be known in advance, which is impossible, or else the calculation 
is adjusted afterwards. In this example the author calculated MsR,c at intervals of L/50 
(0.17 m) either side of mid-span.
The position of the critical value for MsR,c varies depending on the relative magnitudes 
of the stage 1 prop reaction, where for heavier slabs and greater spans the position of the 
critical value for MsR,c drifts further from mid-span.
Example 12.13
Repeat Example 12.12 by reducing the number of strands necessary to maintain the 
original mid-span service moment of 728.2 kNm in Example 12.8, i.e. imposed live load 
of 45 kN/m. Determine a suitable arrangement of strands.
Solution
The previous example has shown that the critical stresses are in the bottom fibre, and 
therefore σt
 at the top fibre is not required.

Cantilevers and continuous 
slabs and beams
13.1 INTRODUCTION TO CANTILEVERS AND BALCONIES
Although prestressed concrete (psc) floor slabs with cantilevers represent a small percentage 
of the flooring market, used mainly internally in buildings because of the need to provide 
a thermal bridge in external situations or in car parks, their use to provide the restraint for 
separate balconies has increased considerably over the past 20years in multi-storey residen￾tial buildings, for example as shown in Figures 13.1 and 16.19. The main function is as a 
residential balcony. Both solid and hollow core units (hcu) are used, often with a structural 
topping to cope with the negative cantilevering bending moment in the main span, known 
as the ‘back-span’. For a typical 1.5m span balcony, carrying imposed dead and live loads 
of about 1.0 and 3.0 kN/m2, together with a balustrade, the typical back-span is 6–8m for 
a 200mm depth composite solid plank or hcu.
Figure 13.1 Steel balconies connected to the perimeter of a precast structure using solid precast floor slabs 
as the back-spans.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 441
Balcony units are separate reinforced precast concrete or steel units with timber decking 
that typically have a steel member acting as the cantilever. Figure 13.2 shows a flooring 
layout comprising mainly of psc hollow core units (hcu) but also solid precast units provid￾ing the back-span to the cantilever balcony. To satisfy building regulations and avoid cold 
bridges, a thermal break is provided within the cavity zone as shown in Figures 13.3 and 
16.18. There are many proprietary types depending on capacity and function. A continuous 
prestressed slab crossing the cavity would not satisfy these thermal requirements.
Recently, it has become popular to attach a structural steelwork balcony to the side of psc 
solid units, as shown in Figure 13.4. The balconies are typically 2.5–4.0m in length (paral￾lel with the side of the precast unit) and 1.5m from the edge of the precast unit, which is 
formed with a square edge (not a profiled/keyed edge). The depth of the precast unit is at 
least 200mm in most cases. A 75mm thickness structural topping may be added to either 
(i) increase the main span of the floor unit supporting the balcony or (ii) increase the shear 
and torsion capacity of the unit supporting the balcony. Sturdy moment resisting brackets 
are bolted to the side of the precast unit at say 1.3–1.5m centres, and the bay of steel beams, 
cross beams, bracing and steel/glass balustrade cantilevers from the side of the precast floor. 
The tie back is formed by one steel strap per bracket, typically 200mm width×12mm thick￾ness, anchored and grouted through the thickness of the precast unit using threaded bolts or 
Figure 13.2 Precast hollow core flooring layout, also showing solid composite precast slabs providing the 
back-span for balconies in a residential building.442 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
dowels. Concrete screed, typically 75mm thickness completes the construction (if no topping 
is used). The back-span, this time perpendicular to the span of the floor, is achieved by struc￾turally grouting two precast units together, making it at least 2.3m. A third precast unit, 
usually a hcu of equal depth, may be used to increase the back-span if necessary. Therefore, 
the precast unit at the edge of the balcony is subjected to torsion, in addition to shear at the 
supports, and bending further from the supports, together with a line reaction in the grouted 
joint between the edge and adjacent unit. Figure 13.5 shows the completed solution.
Figure 13.6 shows cantilevered prestressed hcu providing a balcony to a residential build￾ing in Australia. Details of the thermal bridge are unknown. However, cantilevering slabs

may be used if the thermal insulation is provided and supported at the end of the cantilever, 
for example by thermally insulated cladding or similar façade. Figure 13.7 shows a more 
flamboyant use of hcu cantilevers as a roof canopy at a supermarket in Malaysia – suffice to 
say that the imposed dead and live loads on this roof are quite small. Details of the struc￾tural ties to the supporting beam, if any, are not known.
13.2 STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF CANTILEVERS USING 
SOLID AND HOLLOW CORE UNITS
13.2.1 Definition of spans and loading cases
Cantilever slabs are designed as statically determinate units with a simple support (usually at 
one end but as shown in Figure 13.7 could be at both ends) and a continuous support over a 
wall or primary rectangular or I beam. These supports provide no restraint to rotation at the 
ends of the main span. No moments are distributed unless one end is continuous as shown in 
Section 13.5. There is no moment redistribution at a cantilever support. The maximum length, 
or effective span, of the cantilever is limited by
i. moment of resistance at the cantilever support, usually the ultimate MRd
′ governs as 
static rebars are placed in the top of the precast unit or mesh and some rebars in the 
structural topping
ii. overturning of the main span, i.e. the reaction at the simple support becomes negative, 
allowing of course for appropriate factors of safety
Figure 13.7 Roof canopy to a supermarket in Malaysia formed by cantilevered prestressed hollow core 
units.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 445
iii. restrictions placed on the long-term deflection, and/or deflection after finishes, at the 
end of the cantilever
iv. The manufacturer/designer’s in-house limitation, often in the order of effective span 
to depth of precast unit or total depth including topping of 7–10. A common limiting 
ratio is 7½.
To cater for all conditions, maximum and minimum imposed dead and live loads are placed 
on the main span and cantilever as shown in Figure 13.8, resulting in critical bending 
moments and shear forces, as follows:
• Loading Case I. Maximum load in the main span with minimum load (self-weight and 
imposed dead loads) in the cantilever. This establishes the greatest sagging (positive) 
moment in the main span. It also gives the maximum shear force at the simple support 
as the upward reaction from the cantilever moment is the least.
• Loading Case II. Maximum load in the cantilever with minimum load in the main 
span. This establishes the greatest negative moment at the cantilever support, and the 
critical distance into the back-span for negative top reinforcement.
• Loading Case III. Maximum load in both the cantilever and main span. This estab￾lishes the greatest shear force in the main span at the face of the cantilever support 
(with the main span bending moments being less than in Case I).
It is usual to combine load cases I and II in bending moment diagrams, for both service￾ability and ultimate limit states, as shown later by the kinks in the graphs in Figures 13.33 
and 13.34.
Load case II is also used to check the stability, i.e. over-turning criteria, of the unit, 
including an allowance for construction traffic in the cantilever, typically 1.5 kN/m2. See 
Section 13.2.5.
Service and ultimate bending moments, and ultimate shear forces are calculated in the 
usual manner for the three load cases. Let L=effective main span, Lʹ=effective cantilever 
span, calculated according to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 5.3.2.2 (1) (BS EN 1992, 2004) as
Fig. 5.4 e( )       c L l ′ = lear span n′ + min 0{ } .5l h b ; 0.5 (13.1)
where lb =cantilever bearing length and h=depth of cantilever. The latter may be critical 
where the bearing is a beam of say 300mm width.
Referring to Figure 13.8:

main span, and ws

zero shear force, known as the ‘shear span’ of length a as
a=F/ws (13.3)
and

If dead point loads Pʹ at the end of the cantilever are included Eq. 13.2 is modified 
to F w= − s s L w / 2 ( ) ′ ′ 1L P / 2 + ′L L ′ / 2 . If there are point and line loads in the main 
span, then Eqs. 13.3 and 13.4 are not applicable and are modified to suit.
For Case II loading, let ws1 =self-weight and dead UDL in the main span and ws
′ =total 
dead and imposed UDLs in the cantilever.
The maximum negative moment Ms
′
 in the cantilever
Ms s ′ = −w L′ ′ / 2 2 (13.5)
For the ultimate limit state replace ws and ws
′ with appropriate wEd and wEd′ for load 
combinations Exp. 6.10a or 6.10b from BS EN 1990 (BS EN 1990, 2002). For Case 
I loading, the support reaction is now FEd, shear span aEd and maximum positive 
moment MEd. For Case II loading, the maximum design negative moment in the 
cantilever is MEd′ . The back-span calculation for aEd is only required to determine 
the position of zero bending moment in the main span, i.e. for the purpose of calcu￾lating the point of curtailment in the top reinforcement. Let x=distance from simple 
support to point of zero ultimate moment, then
MEd =FEd x−wEd x2/2=0
Then wEd x2/2=FEd x
hence x=2 FEd/wEd, but as aEd =FEd/wEd, then x=2 aEd
x=2 FEd/wEd (13.6)
The logic behind this is that the shape of the bending moment diagram is symmetri￾cal about x=aEd.
For composite cantilever slabs, the same equations Eqs. 13.2–13.6 are used except that the 
UDLs are separated into stage 1 and stage 2 loads, before and after the structural topping 
has hardened. Strictly, the effective span of the cantilever, according to Eq. 13.1, may be 
slightly different for stage 1 where hs<lb, then for stage 2 where it might be that h>lb, but 
this is generally ignored and stage 2 value is used.
Stage 1 and 2 service moments are separated only for the determination of the maximum 
compressive stress in the soffit of the psc unit as given in Section 13.2.3, and to check 
whether the cantilever is flexurally cracked or uncracked for the calculation of VRd c ′ , or ft m′
, ax, 
respectively, as given in Section 13.2.6.
Stage 1 and 2 ultimate moments are separated for the design of top rebars in the precast 
unit in stage 1 – these may be in excess of the moment of resistance provided by top tendons 
if present. Stage 2 ultimate moments are for the design of the steel mesh and other loose 
rebars in the structural topping. See Section 13.2.4.
The maximum design shear force in the cantilever is for Case II loading at the start of the 
shear span MEd′ =Lʹ−lb/2− yb as
V w Ed′ = Ed′ ′lv (13.7)
This is the case for hcu, where it is assumed that the design point is at the non-composite 
centroid height yb. For solid composite slabs, the point is at the composite height yb,c – the 
difference is insignificant as the shear capacity of solid slabs is huge.448 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
In the main span, maximum VEd is at the face of the cantilever support for Case III load￾ing. The reaction in the main span at the cantilever support is
F w Ed = + EdL w / 2 ( ) Ed′ ′ L L / 2 / 2 (13.8)
VEd =FEd −wEd (lb/2−yb) (13.9)
Loads for balustrades at the end of the cantilever, and sometimes at the edge of the canti￾lever, are specified in kN/m according to their construction. There is nothing written in BS 
EN 1991 for balustrade loads, although the UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-1-1 (NA 
to BS EN 1991-1-1, 2002) requires a minimum point load of 2.7 kN in office areas to be 
considered, but this is not a balustrade load. For 20mm toughened glass balustrades with 
galvanised steel posts for example the self-weight is typically 1.0 kN/m. The horizontal 
reaction of 0.74 kN/m (or 1.5 kN/m for congregation areas) is taken from NA to BS EN 
1991-1-1, Table NA.8 for parapet walls. The typical height to this load is 0.75m, generating 
a constant moment in the cantilever of 0.56–1.12 kNm/m.
It is not possible to produce load vs. span charts for cantilever slabs as the effective span 
vs. imposed load in the main span depends on the effective span of the cantilever. However, 
as the main span reduces, so do the requirements for prestress leading to much smaller end 
rotations due to camber, which in turn reduces deflection at the end of the cantilever. For 
example, for an effective span of 1.5m, it is shown in Example 13.4 that when the main 
span is 9.8m the long-term deflection at the end of the cantilever is 15mm, but if the main 
span is reduced to 7.0m and the prestress is halved the deflection there reduces to 7mm. The 
limiting deflections in cantilevers are discussed and given in Section 13.3.3.
Figure 13.8 shows an example of the loading cases that includes the self-weight of filled 
cores w0c, suggesting that there are no tendons at the top of the unit, and there is no rein￾forced structural topping. Figures 4.32, 13.9, 13.10, and 13.14 show examples of hcu and 
solid units that include top rebars in opened cores or slots.
This leads to two possible conditions for the design of cantilever slabs
1. Referring to Figure 13.11, a psc unit alone with either
i. pretensioned tendons in the top sufficient to carry the ultimate moment at cantile￾ver support
ii. no top tendons, or small area of tendons, with top opened cores and factory placed 
rebars in the top of filled cores
2. Referring to Figure 13.12, a composite psc unit with topping, with either
i. pretensioned tendons in the top of the unit sufficient to carry stage 1 ultimate 
moment at the cantilever support due to self-weight and topping, plus a construc￾tion traffic allowance of 1.5 kN/m2. Stage 2 loads, after hardening of the topping, 
are resisted by a steel mesh (with loose rebars as necessary) in the topping
ii. no top tendons, or a small area of tendons, with top opened cores and factory 
placed rebars in the top of filled cores to carry stage 1 moment and stage 2 loads in 
the same manner.
Wet cast solid or hollow core (Figure 2.16) units are suitable for cantilevered slabs, either 
non-composite or composite, because the bottom tendons can be debonded in the region of 
the cantilever, unlike dry-cast extruded or slipformed units that cannot. Top tendons, for 
example small strands (9.3mm diameter) or wires (5 or 7mm diameter) may be positioned Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 449

at the top of the unit and debonded in the region of the main span, thus maximising MsR
in the main span. This method also has the structural advantage of greater negative MsR′
compared with dry cast units in addition to upward camber in the cantilever. Distances to 
the point of debonding are calculated in a similar manner to the curtailment distances for 
rebars in the top opened cores in Section 13.2.2, except that the anchorage length for pre￾stressing tendons is lbpd (not lbd).

Note that due to strain compatibility of loose rebars and top tendons, the relative 
yield strength of tendons pyk =1770 N/mm2 to rebars fyk =500 N/mm2 is not consid￾ered, i.e. the strength of tendons is also limited to 0.87 fyk.
The number of top opened cores should be at least 2, and not more than 2 less 
than the number of cores. The number of bars in narrow cores, of say 60–80mm 
in width, should be 1, but in wider cores, such as 100–150mm in width, could be 
1 or 2.
The curtailment and anchorage length of rebars in the top opened cores, beyond 
point of zero MEd in the main span (Eq. 13.6) is given as
Let fcki=strength of concrete in filled cores
Although fcki could be as low as 25 N/mm2 most manufacturers prefer to use 
higher strength concrete, often equal to the precast fck, but not more than fcki=45 
N/mm2. This improves the bond strength at the interface of the interior of the cores, 
which can be quite smooth for extruded units, but less so for slipformed units where 
the fluctuating piston action of the machine causes small crests at about 200mm 
spacing on the inside of the cores.

13.2.3 Service stress due to prestress plus negative flexural stress
The bottom fibre of the cantilever is checked for the combined service stress due to prestress 
and the maximum cantilever moment Ms
′. As given in Section 7.2.1: ‘For non-linear creep to 
exist the term [σc/fcm(t0)−0.45] must be positive. Then σc≤0.45 fcm(t0).’ Therefore, the com￾bined compressive stress is

13.2.4 Composite cantilever slabs
13.2.4.1 Ultimate design for stage 1 and 2 bending moments
The design of reinforcement in the structural topping, and if necessary in the top opened 
filled cores (Section 13.2.2) is a two-stage design at the ultimate limit state. The serviceabil￾ity limit state is also checked for combined compressive prestress plus flexural stress (similar 
to Eq. 13.25), but the remainder of the design is at the ultimate limit state.

where wEd′ 1 is the self-weight of the precast unit plus the self-weight of the wet structural 
topping. For a depth of topping t the self-weight is taken as 25 (t+5) (kN/m2) allowing for 
the slope of the psc unit due to camber, typically 10mm for Lʹ=1.5m. The self-weight may 
be adjusted after stage 1 calculation is completed if necessary.
The ultimate load combination used for wEd′ 1 is the same as that used for the total loads 
based on Exp. 6.10a or 6.10b of BS EN 1990. Therefore, referring to Section 3.1.3, if it is 
found that for the total loads γG =1.25 and γQ =1.5, these values are also used for wEd′ 1. If 
γG =1.35, because wEd′ 1 is a dead load, an anomaly in the total ultimate load will accrue.
If top tendons Ap′ are present, Eqs. 13.11–13.13 determine whether top bars are required 
at stage 1. If not the precast is then checked for the combined service stresses in the top fibre 
according to Eq. 13.26, and top bars are then specified or not.
The top bars are considered to be at their design ultimate strength 0.87 fyk, even if the area 
provided A A s p′ rov s > ′req, and therefore do not contribute further to stage 2.

Let the strength of the topping=fckT
d2′ =effective depth to the top bars in the topping, usually a A142 or A193 steel mesh 
placed at mid-depth of the topping giving top cover C'≈30mm.
It is not known how the sheets of mesh will be nested, and whether the mesh bars parallel 
to the span of the cantilever will be nearest to the top surface or further down. Therefore, 
in deeper toppings, such as t=100mm, the parallel bars may possibly be at a depth from the 
top surface of 30+say 12+radius 6=48mm.

the parallel mesh bars particularly if the size of the mesh becomes large, e.g. A393, as it may 
only be required for a short distance in the main span. Therefore a better option would be 
to use A142mesh plus H8mm bars at 200mm spacing. The minimum area of mesh is the 
usual requirement of 0.13% or 0.26 fctm/fyk ×concrete area.
If cantilever span Lʹ<anchorage length lbd for the mesh, fyk is modified by the ratio of 
Lʹ/lbd, but not greater than 1. Alternatively As
′2 is modified by the ratio of lbd/Lʹ.

13.2.4.3 Propped cantilevers in composite cantilever slabs
Propping the end of a cantilever while the insitu concrete topping is placed is fraught with 
danger. Let wT =self-weight of the topping per unit width. The problem is that positive 
deflections and negative end rotations θ at the cantilever support in the main span due to 
wT will cause uplift at the end of the cantilever. (Rotations are defined as positive clockwise 
if the cantilever is viewed at the right-hand end of the span.) Therefore the reaction in a 
previously rigidly founded prop will reduce, in turn reducing the effectiveness of the prop to 
nullify stage 1 stresses due to wT. For example due to wT in the main span θ=−wT L3/24 Ecm
Ic,co and due to the moment wT Lʹ
2/2 in the cantilever θʹ=+(wT Lʹ
2/2) L/3 Ecm Ic,co. If the main 
span L is considerably greater than Lʹ, which is often 4 to 5 times, the deflection at the end 
of the cantilever will be negative upwards δʹ=(θ+θʹ) Lʹ+wT Lʹ
4/8 Ecm Ic,co (the free deflection 
of the cantilever, usually small).
For example, for the model 1200×250mm prestressed hcu used in the worked examples 
in this chapter, let Ecm Ic=36283×1296×106 =47.0×1012 Nmm2. Let L=9.8m and Lʹ=1.5m. 
Assume a 75mm depth topping of average depth 80mm, then wT =1.2×0.08×25=2.4 kN/m 
(or 2.4 N/mm) per unit. Then due to the main span θ=-2.4×98003/24×47.0×1012 =−0.002000 
radians. Due to the cantilever moment θʹ=+(2.4×15002/2)×9800/3×47.0×1012 =+0.000187
rad. Then δʹ=(-0.002000 +0.000187)×1500=−2.72mm plus the free deflection +2.4×
15004/8×47.0×1012 =0.03mm δʹ=−2.7mm. To nullify this deflection, the prop reaction Rʹ at 
the end of the cantilever must have a downward axial force Rʹ=3 Ecm Ic δʹ/(Lʹ
3 +Lʹ
2L)=−14.95 
kN. In other words, the initial precompression in the prop will reduce by an equivalent 
amount of 14.95 kN* due to curvature when the cantilever slab is loaded by the insitu top￾ping. The reaction in the prop is therefore unknown. The actual reaction Rʹ will be lower 
than this because creep effects will have taken place between transfer and installation of 
the topping, say ψ1 =0.5, and this will reduce Rʹ to≈−14.95/(1+0.5)=−10 kN. Furthermore 
site tolerances and variations in slab properties Ecm Ic,co will lead to other variations, but the 
effect remains that, unless the precompression in the prop is known, the net prop reaction 
is unknown. *The same result is found by carrying out Hardy-Cross moment distribution 
or using stiffness matrix for a two-span beam of 9.8 and 1.5m subjected to a UDL of 2.4 
kN/m; −14.92 kN in this case.
To eliminate this effect, the ratio L/Lʹ has to be approximately 2.3, clearly an impractical 
solution, e.g. a 2.0m cantilever requires a main span not greater than 4.6m, theoretically 
although the precompression in the prop will allow this ratio to increase.
Propping the main span at mid-span has a dramatic effect on the action of the cantilever 
prop because θ and θʹ are reduced by factors of around 4. Repeating the above calculation 
for Rʹ by adding a prop at mid-span gives a reaction after creep effects Rʹ=−0.2 kN, effec￾tively zero. Therefore the prop is not active and the stage 1 moment due to topping MsT′ =wT
Lʹ
2/2 remains at 2.7 kNm. To eliminate this moment the prop reaction needs to be Rʹ=+1.8 
kN. When the topping has hardened and the prop is removed the reverse moment MsT′ acts 
on the composite section.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 455

13.2.5 Instability, or over-turning, criteria for cantilever slabs
The instability of a cantilever slab is essentially a check for over-turning to ensure that, with the 
appropriate factors of safety obtained from the NA to BS EN 1990, Table NA.A1.2 (A) (NA 
to BS EN 1990, 2002) for ‘equilibrium’, the reaction R at the simple support is not negative.
The loading is Case II, defined in Figure 13.13a, where the maximum cantilever 
moment MEq′ is checked against the reactions in the back-span L. The suffix Eq means 
ultimate-equilibrium.
The design values for actions (EQU) given in Table NA.A1.2 (A) are given in Figure 
13.13b and are essentially γGkj,inf=0.9 for the (inferior) dead load in the back-span, and 
γGkj,sup =1.1 and γQ =1.5 for the (superior) dead and live loads in the cantilever, respectively. 
The factor for an accompanying live load is γQ =ψ0 1.5, with each live load(s) considered as 
the accompanying load in turn.
The design values for actions (EQU) given in Table NA.A1.2 (B) are essentially based on 
the ultimate combination Eq. 6.10 in BS EN 1990. These are shown in Figure 13.13c as 
γGkj,inf=1.15 in the back-span, and γGkj,inf=1.35 and γQ =1.5 (and γQ =ψ0 1.5) in the cantile￾ver, respectively.
Consider the latter from Table NA.A1.2 (B) for UDL both in the cantilever and back￾span. In the cantilever

and the UDLs for the self-weight, filled cores and imposed dead loads are wG,sup =3.63+1.24
5+3.80=8.675 kN/m2, wG,inf=3.63 kN/m2 (neglecting the small extent of filled cores in the 
back-span) and wQ =5.0 kN/m2.

Given that a separate calculation is required Table NA.A1.2 (A) (EQU) may as well be 
adopted.
Example 13.1
Calculate MsR at the simple support, mid-span and at the cantilevered support for the 
250 mm depth psc hollow core unit shown in cross section in Figure 6.7. The section 
properties, material data and prestress are as given in Example 7.1. Exposure class to 
the bottom and top surfaces is XC1. The effective span of the main span L = 9.8 m and 
the cantilever span Lʹ = 1.5 m, as shown in Figure 13.14. As there are no tendons in the Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 457
top of the hcu the negative moment of resistance of the cantilever is to be provided 
by placing rebars of strength fyk = 500 N/mm2 into the top of 140 mm wide opened 
cores. The slots are filled with insitu concrete of the same strength as the precast unit 
fcki = 45 N/mm2 and known density 24.5 kN/m3. The distance to the curtailment of 
rebars in the main span (point A) is determined in Example 13.2 (ultimate design). 
Use self-weight of grouted unit = 3.63 kN/m2, imposed dead loads = 3.30 kN/m2, 
ceiling 0.5 kN/m2 and imposed live load both in the main span and cantilever = 5.0 
kN/m2.
Using the two load combinations Case I and II, given in Figure 13.8, check MsR against 
the characteristic combination of the design service moment Ms. Plot graphs of bending 
moment distributions for MsR and Ms, taking lpt=605mm (from Example 6.1).
Solution
At simple support
MsR is the same as in Example 7.1, MsR =168.75 kNm
At mid-span
MsR is calculated according to Example 7.1 except that the bending moments due to self￾weight and imposed dead loads now include the cantilever, inclusive of the self-weight of 
the filled cores.
It is therefore necessary at this early stage to decide on the number of filled cores. This 
depends on the number and diameter of rebars, but for a 6-core unit should be 2 or 3.

Manufacturing data give the cross-sectional area of one core as 20330mm2, therefore 
taking 3 no. cores the self-weight is 3×20330×24.5×10−6/1.2=1.245 kN/m2.
It is shown later in Example 13.2 that the ultimate cantilever moment MEd′ =−24.76 kNm. 
If the lever arm zʹ to 12mm diameter top bars is taken as say 0.9 dʹ, where dʹ=250−25 
cover – say 6=219mm, zʹ=197mm and As
′ =24.76×106/(197×0.87×500)≈289mm2, or 
96mm2 per core. Therefore use 3 no. H12 top bars (339mm2). Two filled cores would 
require 147mm2 per bar, so 2 no. H16 could be used (402mm2), but the 3 bars give a bet￾ter distribution of resistance across the width of the unit and less reliance on the interface 
shear strength inside the hollow cores.
The cantilever dead load w0′ =1.2×(3.63+1.245+3.30)=9.81 kN/m, and MS′0 =−9.81×
1.52/2=−11.04 kNm. At mid-span, the moment is 99.88−11.04/2=94.36 kNm. Now, 
following the procedures in Example 7.1
Due to MS′0 σcp0 =−94.36/15.766=−5.98 N/mm2
Then at mid-span σcp =(1072607/1055654)×11.90−5.98=6.11 N/mm2
Loss of prestress due to creep ∆σp,c=59.13 N/mm2, shrinkage ∆σp,s=73.51 N/mm2 and 
relaxation ∆σp,r=27.47 N/mm2
Final prestress. At transfer, at the mid-span position of the main span (not at mid-span 
of the overall length of unit of 11.3m) and discounting the cantilever which does not 
exist, the prestress after initial losses is σpm0 =1177.4 N/mm2
σpo =1177.4−59.13−73.51−27.47=1017.3 N/mm2 (compared with 1020.7 N/mm2
without the cantilever).
Final prestress at mid-span. σb =12.89 N/mm2 and σt=−2.10 N/mm2
MsR at mid-span is the lesser of
MsR,b =(12.89+3.80)×10.701=178.66 kNm
MsR,t=(20.25−2.10)×10.056=224.76 kNm>178.66 kNm
At cantilever support
MsR is calculated as above except that the negative bending moments due to self-weight 
and imposed dead loads are for the cantilever alone, adding compression to the concrete 
stress at the centroid of the tendons, increasing creep losses.
The cantilever MS′0 =−9.81×1.52/2=−11.04 kNm
Due to MS′0 σcp0 =−11.04/15.766=+0.70 N/mm2
σcp =(1072607/1055654)×11.90+0.70=12.79 N/mm2
Loss of prestress ∆σp,c=123.85 N/mm2, ∆σp,s=73.51 N/mm2 and ∆σp,r=27.03 N/mm2
After initial losses close to the end of the span σpm0 =1158.8 N/mm2
σpo =1158.8−123.85−73.51−27.03=934.4 N/mm2
Final prestress at the cantilever. σb =11.84 N/mm2 and σt=−1.93 N/mm2
MsR,b =(11.84+3.80)×10.701=167.42 kNm and MsR,t=223.04 kNm>167.42 kNm
Therefore the reduction is MsR between mid-span and the cantilever is 11.24 kNm, or 
6.3%, not a huge amount and which is in fact not critical, but it is worth carrying out the 
exercise to see the differences.
This above value of MsR,b does not take into account the mass of the reinforced filled 
cores. Manufacturer’s data for this hcu with three empty cores gives Ic=1395×106mm4
(increased from 1270×106mm4 for 6 no. cores).
There is a small increase to allow for the transformed area of the tendons and rebars in 
the top of the cores such that, allowing for the manufacturing operations of opening the Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 459
tops of cores, the best approximation is Ic,co ≈1497×106mm4 and Zb,co ≈12.38×106mm3
(14% increase). Then MsR,b ≈(11.84+3.80)×12.38=193.6 kNm. This higher value may 
be ignored.
MsR at the ends of the unit is the same as in Example 7.1. MsR,b =40.63 kNm
Design moments Ms and M's in the cantilever
Case I. Maximum loads in the main span and minimum (dead) loads in the cantilever.
Main span ws=1.2×(3.63+3.80+5.0)=14.92 kN/m
Cantilever dead load w0 =1.2×(3.63+1.245+3.80)=10.41 kN/m, and Ms
′=−11.71 
kNm.
Eq. 13.2 Reaction at simple support F=14.92×9.8/2−11.71/9.8=71.91 kN
Eq. 13.3 Shear span a=71.91/14.92=4.820m from simple support
Eq. 13.4 Ms=F a−ws a2/2=71.91×4.820−14.92×4.8202/2=173.3 kNm<178.66 kNm
Strictly the self-weight of the filled cores should be added to ws in the main span, but 
only over the length they are filled. This is not known until the ultimate moment 
analysis, i.e. distance to zero MEd plus the anchorage length, is completed in 
Example 13.2, which is found to be 0.90m from the cantilever support. Therefore 
F is increased by (1.2×1.245×0.902/2)/9.8=0.06 kN to 71.97 kN. The new shear 
span a=71.97/14.92=4.824m and Ms=71.97×4.824−14.92×4.8242/2=173.6 
kNm<178.66 kNm.
Case II. Maximum loads in the cantilever and minimum in the main span.
Main span ws=1.2×(3.63+3.80)=8.92 kN/m
Cantilever dead load w0 =10.41+1.2×5.00=16.41 kN/m, and Ms
′=−18.46 kNm.
F=8.92×9.8/2−18.46/9.8=41.82 kN
a=41.82/8.92=4.689m
Ms=41.82×4.689−8.92×4.6892/2=98.2 kNm clearly not critical.
However, these data give the distance to the point of zero moment at
Eq. 13.6 x=2a=9.378m from the simple support, or 0.422m from the cantilever sup￾port, as shown in Figure 13.15.
For interest only at this stage in the analysis, MsR,t at the top of the section is based on 
prestress σt=−1.93 N/mm2. The remaining tension in the top is −3.80−−1.93=−1.87 
N/mm2. MsR,t≈1.87×10.056=18.81 kNm>18.46 kNm, therefore the section 
remains uncracked for the purpose of calculating shear capacities at either side of 
the cantilever support.
Also, check the total compression in the bottom fibre due to prestress and flexural 
compression. The total compressive stress is σb +Ms

3.56 N/mm2 <0.45 fcm =0.45×(45+8)=23.85 N/mm2.
Figure 13.15 shows the complete bending moment diagrams for the characteristic 
design moments Ms and MsR. The design is completed for ultimate moments, shear 
forces, deflections in Examples 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4.

At mid-span
MRd is the same, within 0.01% as in Example 9.1, MRd =247.3 kNm (the tiny difference is 
due to the final prestress σpo =1017.3 vs 1020.7 N/mm2.
At cantilever support
MRd for the precast unit alone is calculated as above except that the bending stress due to 
self-weight and imposed dead loads is for the cantilever is subtracted to give σpo =934.4 
N/mm2. Hence MRd =246.8 kNm
MRd′ for the transformed section with filled cores is based on the following stati￾cally reinforced design. For exposure class XC1 top cover Cʹ≥20mm (see Table 5.4). 
However, for manufacturing purposes use Cʹ=25mm. Assuming 12mm diameter 
bars dʹ=250−25−6=219mm. The compression width is the actual width of the hcu 
bʹ=1197mm (ignoring the 8×8mm fillets in the bottom corners)
For Case II load combination, the ultimate cantilever load is the maximum of Exp. 
6.10a and 6.10b of BS EN 1990. The cantilever dead UDL is 1.20×(3.63+1.245+3.80)=
10.41 kN/m and live UDL=1.20×5.00=6.00 kN/m. Then

Note that the critical load case is from Exp. 6.10b and therefore γG =1.25 will also be

Curtailment length beyond zero MEd′ is lbd +dʹ=222+219=441mm
Calculation to the point of zero MEd′ actually requires prior knowledge of this point to 
take account of the self-weight of the filled cores in the main span, but this is found to be 
insignificant, i.e. changes the curtailment point by only 10mm.
The curtailment length at the end of the cantilever is taken as the minimum anchorage 
10Φ plus dʹ, as 120+219=339mm.
Calculation to the point of zero MEd′ is as follows
Case II main span wEd =1.25×8.92=11.15 kN/m
Simple support reaction FEd =11.15×9.8/2−24.76/9.8=52.11 kN
Shear span aEd =52.11/11.15=4.674m
Point to zero MEd′ x=2aEd =9.347m
Curtailment point x=9.347−0.441=8.906m, rounded to 8.90m, or 0.90m from the 
cantilever support (this information is carried to Example 13.1).
For Case I load combination, the cantilever dead UDL wEd′ =1.25×10.41=13.01 kN/m
MEd′ = × 13.01 1.5 / 2 = −14.64 kNm 2
In the main span wEd =1.25×8.92+1.5×6.00=20.145 kNm
Plus the filled cores wEdt=1.25×1.2×1.245=1.87 kNm for a distance of 0.90m from 
the cantilever support
Simple support reaction FEd =20.145×9.8/2+(1.87×0.902/2)/9.8−14.64/9.8=98.71+0.0
8−1.49=97.30 kN

13.2.6 Shear capacity of cantilever floor units
Refer to Section 10.2.6. After production of the hcu, and after detensioning, the cores are 
filled using factory placed concrete fcki. The additional shear capacity of plain-filled cores, 
i.e. without rebars in the tension zone to act in dowel action against shear forces is
Eq. 10.16 VRd,t=⅔ n bc dc fctdi
The total shear capacity VRd,c+t=VRd,c+VRd,t
Example 13.3
Calculate the additional shear capacity VRd,t to the basic capacities VRd,c and VRd,cr, 
respectively for the reinforced concrete filled top opened cores for the 250mm depth 
prestressed hcu shown in Figures 6.7 and 13.14 and designed in Examples 10.1, 13.1 and 
13.2. Check the ultimate shear force VEd at the cantilever supports both in the main span 
and in the cantilever using the ultimate loads given in Example 13.2. The nominal bear￾ing length at the cantilever support lb =200mm.
Solution
At the face of the cantilever support, which is beyond the end of the transmission zone 
where αl≥1, the shear capacity from Example 10.1 is VRd,c=190.0 kN.
Similarly, the flexurally cracked capacity in the basic unit (without filled cores) from 
Example 10.2 is VRd,cr=109.3 kN
At the cantilever support in the main span
The filled cores are designed as plain concrete. The breadth of the core is 140mm and 
depth of the core dc=250−40−35=175mm.
Using fcki=45 N/mm2, fctdi=0.7×0.3×452/3/1.5=1.77 N/mm2
Eq. 10.16 VRd,t=⅔×3×140×175×1.77×10−3 =86.7 kN
VRd,c+t=190.0+86.7=276.7 kN
At the cantilever support in the cantilever
If the cantilever section at the support is flexurally uncracked, as was shown to be the 
case in Example 13.1, the ultimate shear capacity remains as VRd,c=190.0 kN. The filled 
cores are similarly designed as plain concrete VRd,t=86.7 kN. Then VRd,c+t=276.7 kN.
At the end of the cantilever (from Example 10.1) VRd,c=134.3 kN. Then VRd,c+t reduces 
to 134.3+86.7=221.0 kN.
If the cantilever section at the support is flexurally cracked VRd,cr is based on the area

Design shear forces at the cantilever support
The critical loading is Case III with the maximum load in both the main span and canti￾lever. This gives the maximum downward reaction at the cantilever support in the main 
span.
Maximum ultimate UDL where filled notches wEd =wEd′ =22.01 kN/m over a dis￾tance of 0.9+1.5=2.4m. Distance from the simple support to the centre of this load is 
11.3−2.4/2=10.1mCantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 463
The same applies where no filled notches wEd =22.145 kN/m for a distance of 
9.8−0.9=8.9m from the simple support
Taking moments about the simple support, the total reaction at the cantilever support is
FEd =(20.145×8.92/2+22.01×2.4×10.1)/9.8=135.9 kN
Reaction at cantilever support in cantilever=22.01×1.5=33.0 kN
Net reaction at cantilever support in main span=135.9−33.0=102.9 kN
Shear force VEd is calculated at lb/2+yb from the centre of 
support=200/2+123.0=223mm. Then VEd =102.9−0.223×22.01=98.0 kN<276.7 kN
In the cantilever VEd =33.0−0.223×22.01=28.1 kN<176.6 kN
13.3 DEFLECTIONS DUE TO END ROTATION 
AND NEGATIVE MOMENTS
13.3.1 Deflection in main span in non-composite units
These are calculated in the same manner as for simply supported spans, as given in Section 
11.2.1, at least in terms of the use of creep factors ψ1, ψ28 and 0.8 ψ∞. The main difference 
is that the end rotation due to the cantilever moment Ms
′, based on self-weight and imposed 
dead loads, reduces the mid-span deflection in the main span. In fact, the distance to the 
point of maximum negative moment is at x=0.5774L from the simple support, but the dif￾ference between this and the deflection at mid-span is only 2%.
To remind the reader, upward camber in the main span, Eq. 11.1 is δ1 =−Ppm0 zcp L2/8 
Ecm(t) Ic,co and deflection due to self-weight, Eq. 11.2 is δ2 =+ 5 w0L4/384 Ecm(t) Ic,co.
Then at transfer, the upward deflection at mid-span due to the self-weight of the cantilever is
δ2a=−w0L2 Lʹ
2/32 Ecm(t) Ic,co (13.39a)
or        δ = 2a − ′0 / 16 ( ) 2 M L s c E t m c I ,co (13.39b)
where wo is the self-weight of the unit and Ms
′0 =w0 Lʹ
2/2 is the negative moment at the can￾tilever support.
Then δ2a is added to δ1 +δ2 in Section 11.2.2.
Strictly one could argue that deflections at transfer should be based on the full length of 
the unit L+Lʹ, particularly when the short-term creep effects are considered, and that the 
above deflections do not occur until the units are installed, at which point in time the above 
deflections are now valid.
Similarly at installation the upward deflection due to self-weight is
δ4a=+ (1+ψ1) δ2a (13.40)
with an additional static deflection due to the self-weight of filled cores.
Then δ4a is added to δ3 +δ4 in Section 11.2.2.
The long-term negative deflection at mid-span due to the cantilever moment Ms
′1 is due 
to the visco-elastic part of the self-weight (and filled cores if present) w1 and static plus the 
visco-elastic part of Ms
′2 due to imposed dead loads w2.

and δ6a is added to δ5 +δ6 +δ7 in Section 11.2.2.464 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The term ‘visco-elastic’ means the deflection takes place due to creep only over time after 
the instantaneous static deflection has taken place.

δ14a = −[ ] ψ28 ′1 2 + + (1 ψ 8 2 ) / ′ 16 2 M M s s L EcmIc c, o (13.42)

Note that the increased second moment of area due to top bars in filled cores is ignored 
in the main span deflections.
13.3.2 Deflection in main span in composite slabs
For composite cantilevers, refer to Section 12.3.4 for deflections in composite elements. The 
reduction in deflection at mid-span at installation due to the moment MsT′ =wTLʹ
2/2 due to 
the self-weight of topping wT is
δ5a = − ′ / 16 2 M L sT E I cm c c, o (13.43)
Then δ5a is added to δ5 in Section 12.3.4.

Then δ8a+δ9a is added to δ8 +δ9 in Section 12.3.4.
The reduction at mid-span in the long-term deflection after finishes, or ‘movement’, is due 
to imposed live load using 1+ψ28, visco-elastic self-weight and topping using ψ∞,t and visco￾elastic imposed dead loads using ψ28, and changes in camber.

Then δ13a is added to δ13 in Section 12.3.4.
13.3.3 Deflection at the end of the cantilever 
in non-composite units
Cantilever deflections are calculated at transfer, installation of precast unit, for total long￾term deflection, and movement after installation of finishes. They are due to
i. (a) effects of prestress in the upward camber and end rotation in the main span and (b) 
small deflections due to the internal prestressing moment in the cantilever span
ii. gravity loads (a) due to end rotation in the main span at the cantilever support, (b) 
upward deflection due to (iia), and (c) ‘free’ deflection of the cantilever from an encas￾tre support, such as wLʹ
4/8 EI or PLʹ
3/3 EI for UDL and point load, respectively.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 465
Note that +ve is a clockwise rotation if the simple support is viewed at the left end.
Table 13.1 gives a summary of rotations and deflections, showing the progression from 
transfer to installation, and from installation to long-term. Note that the critical loading 
is Case II with only dead loads in the main span causing end rotations θ2, θ4 and θ6 at 
the cantilever support, whereas the cantilever is fully loaded causing end rotations θ2a, 
θ4a and θ6a. The internal moment due to prestress in the main span causes end rotations 
θ1, θ3 and θ5 at the cantilever support. The internal prestress in the cantilever does not 
cause rotation (as there is no external reaction). The term ‘free’ is the deflection in the 
cantilever from an encastre support, and is added to the deflection due to θLʹ. Note that, 
for clarity, Table 13.1 does not include the small changes in prestress included in the 
equations for δ3 and δ5.
a. At transfer
Rotation at the cantilever support θ1 is due to prestress, and θ2 is due to self-weight 
of the unit (without infill) in the main span and θ2a is due to self-weight in the cantilever

If reinforced top opened cores are required (Section 13.2.2, Eq. 13.12) after the 
concrete has hardened the deflections due to prestress and self-weight in the cantilever 
are now based on a greater second moment of area, which, after the transformed areas 
of the top bars are added, is Ic c ′, o. Let the ratio α=I I c c ′, , o c / co.
Referring to Figure 13.16b, the camber is equal to θ3 Lʹ, minus the change due to

Final deflection δ7 =δ5 +δ6 ≤limit as follows
As the limit for the long-term deflection of a cantilever is not given in BS EN 1992-
1-1, clause 7.4.1 (4), nor the limit for live load deflections or movement after finishes 
in clause 7.4.1 (5), it is hereby suggested that the Code’s limits may be based on an 
apparent effective span of the cantilever Lef′ of twice the distance from the end of the 
cantilever to the point maximum negative deflection in the main span, at x’ from the 
simple support. (See later Figure 13.17 in Example 13.4). Then Lef′ =2 [Lʹ+(L−xʹ)] and 
the deflection limit is therefore Lef′ /250. Similarly for live deflections or movement 
after finishes the limit is Lef′ /500, or Lef′ /350 for non-brittle finishes or partitions.
d. Long-term movement due to live load only
This is due to the component of live load in the rotation θ6a plus the component of 
live load in the deflection δ6. For case II loading there is no contribution from the live 
load in θ6 in the main span. Then

These are due to a point load P at distance a from the cantilever support, and a line load w
extending to a from the cantilever support. The following are all multiplied by the appro￾priate ψ28 or 0.8ψ∞ creep factors, and all divided by Ecm and the appropriate Ic,co in Section

13.3.5 Calculations of deflections in partially 
cracked sections in the cantilever
The value of Ic c ′, o depends whether the top cantilever section is reinforced using top opened 
cores and rebars and whether the section is flexurally cracked or not. For continuous top 
strands or wires in which case the section is, by definition in Section 13.2.4.2, uncracked, 
use Ic c ′, o. Otherwise, the flexurally cracked section is based on the partially cracked section 
as given in Section 11.2.4 and Eqs. 11.20–11.32. The only differences are that
i. Mcr and Mk refer to the cantilever values Mcr′ and Mk′
ii. section modulus also refers to the top fibre W I t u = ′ / ( ) h x − u′ in the cantilever
iii. As refers to the area of top bars or tendons As
′
iv. d is to the top bars dʹ
v. b is the soffit width bʹ.
Note that in checking the top fibre stress the prestress σ′
t, which may be tensile and negative, 
is adjusted for the ratio of the cantilever span to the transmission length of tendons in the 
cantilever, i.e. σ′
t =σt Lʹ/lpt2 ≤1.
Example 13.4
Calculate the long-term deflection and the deflection after applying finishes at the end 
of the cantilever for the 250mm depth prestressed hcu shown in cross section in Figures 
6.7 and 13.14 and designed for serviceability in Examples 11.1 and 13.1. The loading is 
Case II for maximum cantilever and minimum main span loads. The floor slab is for use 
in offices. Check the Code’s limits if the floor finishes are brittle.
Solution
From Example 11.1 at the simple support Ppm0 =1055.6 kN, Ppmi=1010.2 kN and Ppo =860.2 
kN. From Example 13.1 at the cantilever support is slightly less, i.e. Ppo =934.4×911×10−3 =
851.2 kN, but it is only localised in the region of the cantilever support and may be ignored.
To calculate deflections in the cantilever it is necessary to determine the end rotation in 
the main span θ due to prevailing prestress and/or gravity loads, from which δ=θLʹ plus 
the free cantilever deflections.
Although the prestress is released over the full length of the unit, L+Lʹ=9.8+1.3=11.3m, 
this cannot be used to calculate rotation at installation because deflections and end rota￾tions will revert back to those determined for the main span and cantilever individually. 
Referring to Figure 13.16a the rotations at transfer are as follows

Figure 13.17 shows distributions of camber, long-term deflections and movement 
along the span, together with the appropriate limits. Note that the deflections in 
the main span are for Case I loading (‘max-min’) and the deflections in the cantile￾ver are for Case II loading (‘min-max’). This explains why there is a discontinuity 
in the profile of the deflections.
Example 13.5
Repeat the calculations in Example 13.4 for the long-term deflection at the end of the 
cantilever only in a composite hcu slab, but replacing the dead load of the screed with a 
75mm nominal depth structural topping. Calculate whether reinforced concrete-filled 
cores are required for stage 1 loads, including an allowance of 1.5 kN/m2 for construction 
traffic, and calculate the requirements for steel rebars in the topping. Use fckT =25 N/mm2
for the topping. Cover to bars in the topping is 30mm.
The section properties for the composite hcu slab, without top bars in filled cores 
and without the steel mesh in the topping, may be taken from Example 12.1 as 
Ic,c,co =2819.9×106mm4, and for the precast unit alone as Ic,co =1296×106mm4.

13.4 CANTILEVER BEAMS
13.4.1 Use of prestressed concrete cantilever beams
Prestressed concrete (psc) cantilever beams are used less frequently than precast reinforced 
cantilever beams, and often as an ‘add-on’ cantilever to the design of the main beam. Figures 
13.18 and 13.19 show examples of psc cantilevered rectangular or inverted-tee beams sup￾porting solid units or hcu. Prestressed cantilever beams have the advantage that some of 
the top and bottom tendons may be debonded in the region of negative bending moments, 
enabling greater tensile stress in the top and greater compressive stress in the soffit unhin￾dered by prestress, which might be in the order of σt≈−2 N/mm2 and σb ≈+15 N/mm2 with￾out debonding, or 50% of this if debonded. A minimum number of tendons are required in 
the bottom of the cantilever to control cracking and deflections. The top of the cantilever Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 475

Figure 13.19 Cantilevered precast beams with half-joint connections give the same structural behaviour as 
a continuous beam supporting prestressed hollow core units.476 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
may contain pretensioned tendons in order to control camber in the main span and control 
maximum prestress σb and σt, but they may be debonded just short of the cantilever support. 
See Figure 13.20.
In this case, the top of the beam may be statically reinforced using up to 4 no. H16 to 
H25 giving a moment of resistance in the order of MRd′ ≈100–400 kNm, more than enough 
to cater for 2–3m long cantilevers in 300–500mm depth beams. Composite beams with 
additional rebars, such as 2 no. H16 stability tie bars, placed in the cast insitu infill above 
rectangular beams or to either side of the upstand in inverted-tee beams will increase the 
negative moment capacity. Steel mesh in a structural topping will increase moment capacity 
further, but by then the design of the cantilever will most probably be limited by long-term 
deflection.
The design of psc cantilever beams follows the procedures in Section 13.2 for
i. load cases I to III
ii. calculation of maximum service and ultimate bending moments
iii. limiting stresses in the top and bottom of the prestressed section

13.4.2 Effect of moment resisting connection 
at the cantilever support
End rotations of the main span at the cantilever support, e.g. long-term rotations θ5, θ6 and 
θ6a in Eqs. 13.59–13.61 may be reduced owing to the flexural stiffness of a supporting col￾umn or wall, as shown in Figure 13.20. The effect may be small, as the rotations at instal￾lation are not affected, but it is worth looking at the analysis, particularly if deflections are 
large and the moment resisting connection is substantial.
Consider the end rotation θ6 due to the gravity UDL in the main span, w, if the column￾to-beam connection is fully rigid and the flexibility of the beam is Ibeam/L, and the flexibility

of the a column beneath the beam of height h is Icolumn/h. Then according to rigid frame 
formulae (ref. Kleinlogel, 1952) the end rotation of the beam reduces from wL3/24 to 
(wL3/24−3wL3/64β), all divided by Ecm Ibeam where β=(Ibeam h/Icolumn L)+1.
For example if the beam in Example 13.6 is rigidly attached to a 300×300mm column 
(of equal strength of concrete) of height say 3.5m, pin-ended at its base, and, as given 
in Example 13.6, Ibeam =8449×106mm4, L=8500mm, Icolumn =675×106mm4, L=3500mm, 
then β=8449×3500/675×8500+1=4.15+1=5.15. Cancelling through by w L3/Ecm Ibeam
the end rotation θ6 reduces by a factor from 1/24 to (1/24−3/64β)=0.04167 to 0.03256, 
i.e. a ratio of 0.78 or a reduction of 22%. If the bottom of the column is encastre, then 
β=3×4.15+4=16.45 and θ6 reduces by a factor from 1/24 to (1/24−3/16β)=0.04167–
0.03027, i.e. a ratio of 0.73. Likewise θ6a, due to the cantilever moment acting at the cantile￾ver support at the top of the column, θ6a reduces by a ratio 1/3 to (β−4)/3 β=0.333–0.252, 
i.e. a ratio of 0.76, almost the same as for θ6.
Of course, the opposing end rotations due to camber and cantilever moments will be 
reduced by similar amounts, but it shows that a rigid connection to a stiff column has an 
effect on θ6 and hence the deflection at the end of the cantilever, especially as θ6 is subject 
to long-term creep effects. As the beam-to-column connection will not be fully rigid, but 
semi-rigid as shown by the work on precast connections reported by Elliott (Elliott 2017), 
consider a typical semi-rigid factor of around 70% (i.e. 0.7 of the fully rigid end moment at 
the same rotation), the reduction ratios for θ6 and θ6a when supported by an encastre column 
will still be about 0.83. The implication of this is shown in Example 13.6.
13.4.3 Design of prestressed concrete cantilever beams
Th design involves checking the main span for the maximum service and bending moments 
Ms and MEd for case I loading (minimum cantilever load) and the maximum shear force in 
the shear plane at the cantilever support for case III loading. Given that a typical minimum 
service moment in the cantilever is 60–80 kNm, Ms will be about 30–40 kNm less than in 
a simply supported beam, and given that Ms per strand (near the bottom of a 600mm depth 
beam) is in the order of 15 to 25 kNm per strand, it may be possible to use 2 or 4 fewer 
strands. Depending on the balance between dead and live loads Ms is usually critical over 
MEd for exposure class XC1, but well matched for exposure XC3.
The cantilever is designed using class II loading (in the same manner as for slabs with top 
tendons) for Ms
′, MEd′ and VEd′ at the cantilever support, checking Eqs. 13.25 and 13.26 for 
combined prestress (especially at the top fibre) and bending stress.
Eq. 13.25        f M b m′, , ax = σb + s
′ / 0 Z f b co ≤ .45 cm
Eq. 13.26        f M t m′
, , ax = σt − s t ′ / Z f co ≥ − ctm
If either of these is violated a number of strands in the central regions of the beam are 
debonded – preferably rather than deflecting, in order to decrease σb and/or increase σt. The 
latter may be critical if σt
 is in the order of −2 to −3 N/mm2. After debonding the moments 
of resistance reduce to MsR,d and MRd,d (suffix d for debond). A back-calculation is carried 
out to check the theoretical distance xd from the simple support where Ms=Ms,d in the main 
span, given as
F xd − = w xs d s / 2 M R d 2 , (13.73)
The actual point for debonding is xd −lpt, where lpt is the basic transmission length, typically 
55 diameters for strand.478 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Similarly the distance xEd,d for the ultimate moment where MEd =MEd,d in the main span, 
given as
F x Ed Ed, , d E − = w xd Ed d / 2 MRd d 2 , (13.74)
The actual point for debonding is xEd,d −lbpd, where lbpd is the ultimate anchorage length, 
typically 100 diameters for strand.
The former service condition is usually the shortest and hence critical distance from the 
simple support. Finally, VRd,c,d is calculated for the reduced number of tendons, and a check 
is made for VRd,cr,d should Ms
′ exceed the cracking moment of resistance
Mcr′ , , d c = σ( ) b + f Z td b co
The ultimate moment of resistance of the cantilever MRd′ is based on the inverted section 
analysis of the beam, where there are NT’ tendons in the tension zone, measured from the 
bottom of the beam. As the width of the soffit of a beam bʹ (particularly inverted-tee and I 
beams) may be much greater than at the top of the beam, the height to the neutral axis Xʹ
will be less than in a sagging mode and therefore the tendons will be stressed to a higher 
level, say around 1500 N/mm2, which is a good starting point for the calculation of strains, 
as explained in Section 9.4.1.
Deflections are calculated using the same procedures as in Sections 13.3.2 and 13.3.3 
and Figure 13.16. End rotations and camber in the main span are calculated using the 
total number of tendons, even though several tendons may be debonded near the canti￾lever support (the error in this assumption is tiny). The free deflections due to prestress 
in the cantilever δ3 and δ5 (Eqs. 13.57 and 13.62) are based on the reduced number of 
tendons after debonding.
Example 13.6
Carry out the design of the inverted-tee beam in Examples 7.10 and 9.5, as shown 
in Figure 6.10 (without the debonded strands) using the main span effective length 
L= 8.5 m and cantilever Lʹ = 2.0 m. The self-weight of the beam is 7.688 kN/m, floor 
slab = 18.0 kN/m, other dead loads = 10.0 kN/m and imposed live load = 30.0 kN/m. 
Check the requirement for reduced strands in the main span, and for the combined 
stresses due to prestress and cantilever bending at the cantilever support. The bearing 
length at the cantilever is 300 mm. Calculate the long-term deflection and movement 
after finishes at the end of the cantilever. Also consider the implications of the canti￾lever support being a semi-rigid connection to the 300 × 300 mm column discussed in 
the text, where its effect on long-term end rotations is to reduce these by a factor of 
0.83 (see Section 13.4.2.).
Solution
Maximum UDL ws=7.688+18.0+10.0+30.0=65.69 kN/m, wEd =89.56 kN/m
Minimum UDL ws,min =7.688+18.0+10.0=35.69 kN/m, wEd,min =44.56 kN/m
Maximum serviceability bending moment in the main span is based on load case I, 
where in the cantilever Ms
′min =35.69×2.02/2=71.38 kNm
Reaction at simple support
F=65.69×8.5/2−71.38/8.5=270.78 kN
Shear span a=270.78/65.69=4.122m from simple support
Ms=270.78×4.122−65.69×4.1222/2=558.1 kNm<599.7 kNm from Example 7.10 
using 26 strands.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 479
The number of strands may be reduced by 4 no. from row 5 at ys=250mm from the bot￾tom, giving MsR =562 kNm and MRd =860 kNm. Using 22 no. strands with an eccentric￾ity zcp =106.2mm gives σb =13.38 N/mm2 in the soffit and σt=-2.07 N/mm2 in the top at 
the cantilever support.
The maximum ultimate bending moment in the main span is based on load case I as 
follows:
MEd′ min =44.56×2.02/2=89.12 kNm
FEd =89.56×8.5/2−89.12/8.5=370.1 kN
a=370.1/89.56=4.133m.
MEd =370.1×4.133−89.56×4.1332/2=764.8 kNm<860 kNm using 22 no. strands (in 
fact only 20 no. strands are required for MEd)
Check the maximum compressive stress in the bottom and top of the beam at the canti￾lever support from Eqs. 13.25 and 13.26

Therefore the limiting stress σt
 should be≥−3.80−−5.18=+1.38 N/mm2 by debonding. 
Due to the large number of permutations for the 22 no. strands a method of trial and 
error is used. The best procedure is to start at row 1 by debonding 4 no. strands, which 
increases σt
 to −0.04 N/mm2, then debonding 4 no. strands from row 2 gives σt=+1.36 N/
mm2. The final number of strands is 14, i.e. 4, 0, 4, 2 in the bottom rows, 2 no. at the top 
of the boot and 2 no. at the top of the beam. Attempting to debond top strands instantly 
reduces σt
 to −1.45 N/mm2 of course.
Using 14 no. strands as so Zb,co =30.98×106mm3, σb =+6.88 N/mm2 and MsR,d =330 
kNm. The distance xd from the simple support is given by
Eq. 13.73        270.78 − = 65.69 / 2 330 kNm 2 x x d d
Hence xd =6.73m, or 1.77m from the cantilever support
The transmission length for 12.5mm diameter strands is lpt=700mm, therefore 
debonding the sheaths starts at 6.73−0.700=6.03m from the simple support.
Using 14 no. strands as so MRd,d =583 kNm.
The distance xEd,d is given by the quadratic in
Eq. 13.74 as 370.1 − = 89.56 / 2 583 kNm 2 x x d d
Hence xEd,d =6.15m.
The ultimate anchorage length is lbpd =1296mm, therefore the debonding sheaths com￾mence at 6.15−1.296=4.85m from the simple support.
This is less critical than for the service condition and therefore the sheaths commence 
at 6.03m from the simple support and continue to the end of the cantilever.
The ultimate moment of resistance of the cantilever MRd′ is based on the inverted sec￾tion analysis of the beam, where there are NT′ =6 no. strands in the tension zone, i.e. 2 
no. strands at 550, 350 and 200mm from the bottom of the beam. As the breadth of the 
beam is quite large, bʹ=600mm, it is likely that the height to the neutral axis X will be 
small and the strands will be stressed to a higher level, say around 1500 N/mm2.480 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Referring to Section 9.4.1, the first estimate of X is found by considering NT′ =6 no.

In row 2, ε′

where MEd max ′ =89.56×2.02/2=179.1 kNm
To complete the ultimate design the maximum shear force at the end of the main span 
at the cantilever support MEd max ′ is given for load case III (maximum in main span and 
cantilever) as MEd max ′ =179.1 kNm. Then
FEd =89.56×8.5/2+179.1/8.5=401.7 kN
VEd is calculated at lb/2+boot depth 400mm from the centre of support
VEd =401.7−89.56×(0.3/2+0.4)=352.4 kN
At the intersection of the upstand and boot, with αl=1.0 because the critical shear plane 
is 2000 mm>lpt2 from the end of the cantilever, then VRd,c,d =508.1 kN>352.4 kN.
Check the requirement for VRd,cr,d. The cracking moment of resistance is given as
Eq. 13.75Mcr,d’=(6.88+1.77)×30.98=268.1 kNm>Ms
′=131.38 kNm, therefore the

these rotations are marked as*

In comparison with floor slabs, it is seen in Examples 13.6 and 13.4 that the 
long-term cantilever deflection/span ratio is much smaller for the beam, i.e. 
12.3/2000=1 in 163, than the slab, i.e. 15.5/1500=1 in 97. Of course, the span/
depth ratios are different, 3.3 and 6.0 for the beam and slab, respectively, due to the 482 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
greater beam loads, but the serviceability moment ratios are just below 1.0 for both 
beam and slab. However, if the cantilever span in the slab is increased to 2000mm, 
the deflection/span is greater still, i.e. 25.1/2000=1 in 80. Furthermore, the ratio 
of long-term deflection to the limiting deflection is 0.51 for the beam but 0.84 for 
the slab. It may therefore be concluded that deflections in beams are generally less 
critical than their moments of resistance.
13.5 CONTINUOUS SPANS
13.5.1 Continuous spans in floor slabs
In the past 30years, practical experience has been gathered in making the simply supported 
ends of psc solid units and hcu flexurally continuous at interior supports, both with and 
without structural toppings. Less attention has been given to psc beams in favour of rein￾forced beams, particularly where the continuity of negative bending moments over walls 
and columns is semi-rigid. See Elliott, Section 9.7.5 (Elliott, 2017). Figures 13.21 and 13.22 
show examples of how continuity may be achieved in precast beams over column supports, 
using continuity top reinforcement in cast insitu joints or topping.
Continuity of floor slabs is common is seismic countries where the action is used more 
for structural integrity than for increased moment capacity. Continuous solid slabs, known 
as half-slab (Figure 12.2), are designed with a structural topping to create wet areas in resi￾dential buildings. The psc unit is 75–100mm depth together with a 75–100mm structural 
topping, depending on span. This construction is also common in short-span car parks,

concrete frame.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 483
where psc solid slabs, typically 3.6–4.8m in length span between long-span (typically 16m)

Whist double-tee floor units are not suitable for continuous construction, the so-called 
‘multi-rib’ double-tee (or triple-tee) floor units have been specially developed with solid 
end details for continuous spans, as shown in Figure 2.21. The keyed sloping end face is 
designed to resist the compression from large negative bending moments at supports, work￾ing together with steel mesh and rebars in the topping. The negative restraint moment capac￾ity MsR′ and MRd′ must be considered at both the serviceability and ultimate limiting states, 
together with the ultimate shear capacity VRd c ′ , in the presence of negative moments (using 
the same procedures as for shear at cantilever supports in Section 13.2.6).
Continuous hcu have been used in stadia design, for example Figure 13.23 shows a typi￾cal detail where site placed reinforcement of maximum diameter 6+h/25 (h=depth of hcu 
in mm) is cast insitu (concrete fcki=40 N/mm2 minimum) into top opened cores, sometimes 
overlapping (but not physically touching) with factory placed prestressing tendons in the top 
of the hcu. The length of the rebars should be 2×bond length, or to the point of contraflex￾ure under imposed live load only. At least three cores in a 1.2m wide unit (four if the span is 
greater than 6m) should be filled. Design procedures for restrained composite supports for 
hcu are published by FIB (FIB, 2000). The negative moment of resistance is relevant only to 
the imposed loads and is provided by an appropriate area of reinforcement calculated in the 
normal manner. Continuity leads to an increase in the span-to-depth ratio, typically from 
30 to 35, with a small reduction (about 5%) in the required area of prestressing tendons. 
Due to the negative moment, shear capacity may be governed by the flexurally cracked 
capacity VRd cr ′ , .

hollow core floor units.484 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Although multi-spans, more than five continuous spans, may be used in short span units, 
as mentioned above for car parks, for longer span hcu of between 6 and 12m span it is more 
common to limit the design to three continuous spans. In this case, the outer spans are more 
critical in the sagging mode, due to the simple support at the remote end, but the interior 
span is critical in the hogging mode and for the design of the area and curtailment of top 
steel over the supports.
The major benefit from continuous spans is summarised in the load vs. span graphs in 
Figure 13.24 for simply supported and continuous spans, both non-composite and com￾posite. The data for continuous spans are based on the interior span of three continuous 
spans. The range of floor units chosen covers the practical range, i.e. 100 mm depth 
solid units with a 75 mm thickness structural topping, and 200 and 400 mm depth hcu 
with or without a 75 mm thickness structural topping. The greatest advantage in terms 
of span vs. imposed load is for the 200 mm depth unit at the greatest load (15 kN/m2) 
where the fixed end moments are the greatest – the ratio of the continuous/simply sup￾ported span is from 1.17 to 1.23. For the 400 mm depth unit, the ratio is from 1.12 to 
1.17. In the deeper units with larger cores, the self-weight of filled cores increases the 
mid-span moment and therefore reduces the advantage gained over simply supported 
units. For example for the 400 mm depth hcu spanning 14 m with 3 no. filled cores the 
moment due to the self-weight of the filled cores (2.44 kN/m2) is 55 kNm out of a total 
Ms = 404 kNm.
Continuous composite slabs are more favourable than non-composite units because the 
latter require reinforced top opened cores, which for greater imposed loads may extend 
far into the main span, in some cases extending over the entire span, although the number 
of top opened cores may be reduced further from the supports. The number and diameter 
of rebars close to internal supports may also be large. Design and construction details are 
Figure 13.23 Continuity of prestressed hollow core floor units over reinforced concrete beams, note the 
1.5m length of the slots in the top opened cores.Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 485
simplified for composite slabs as top opened cores are not necessary and the area of rein￾forcement in the topping is reduced thanks to the greater effective depth.
Referring to Figure 13.24 for the 200+75mm depth composite slab, the ratio of the 
continuous/simply supported span is from 1.14 to 1.21, or 2 percentage points lower than 
the non-composite ratio because there are no fixed end moments due to the self-weight of 
the structural screed (but there are for finishes in the non-composite unit). Similarly, for the 
400+75mm depth composite slab, the ratio is from 1.10 to 1.19. For the solid 100+75mm 
depth slab, the ratio is 1.09–1.14. Note that in Figure 13.24, the clear span for the con￾tinuous spans is 300mm less than the centres of bearing, but only 100mm less for simply 
supported spans. Therefore, 200mm could be added to the continuous spans for a ‘fair’ 
comparison, adding 2–3 percentage points to the above ratios.
To cater for all loading conditions, Figure 3.4 shows five different loading conditions for 
five-span continuous design, and Figure 13.25 shows four conditions for three-span contin￾uous design, with maximum and minimum imposed dead and live loads placed on the inte￾rior and exterior spans, resulting in critical bending moments and shear forces as follows:
Loading Case I. Maximum load in the interior span with minimum load (self-weight and 
imposed dead loads) on the exterior spans. This establishes the greatest sagging (posi￾tive) moment in the interior span. It also gives the maximum shear force at the simple 
support as the upward reaction from the negative moments is the least.
Loading Case II. Maximum load in the exterior spans with minimum load in the inte￾rior span. This establishes the critical distance into the interior span for negative top 
reinforcement.
Loading Case III. Maximum load in one exterior and the interior spans with minimum 
load in the other exterior span. If the exterior spans are of different length, Cases IIIa

and IIIb are for the maximum load in each exterior span in turn. This establishes the 
critical negative bending moment at the supports, and the greatest shear force in the 
interior span (due to the different fixed end moments).
Loading Case IV. Maximum load in all spans. This establishes the greatest support 
reaction.
It is usual to combine all load cases in bending moment diagrams, particularly when three 
effective spans are different, for both serviceability and ultimate limit states, as shown later 
in Figures 13.33 and 13.34 from Examples 13.7 and 13.8.
Section 3.3.1 introduced the load arrangements and partial safety factors for ultimate 
loads in continuous spans, commonly known as ‘max-max-max’, ‘max-min-max’, ‘min￾max-min’, ‘max-max-min’, etc. for stage 2 imposed dead and live loads after the psc unit 
has been positioned in stage 1. For UDL loading for three continuous spans, these are sum￾marised as
a. all spans carrying stage 2 design dead plus live loads γG Gk,+γQ Qk, i.e. max{Exp. 
6.10a; 6.10b}=max{1.35 Gk,j+ψ0 1.5 Qk; 1.25 Gk,j+1.5 Qk}
b. alternate spans carrying γG Gk +γQ Qk with other spans carrying the dead load only γG
Gk with the same γG used for all spans, i.e. 1.35 Gk if Exp. 6.10a is maximum, other￾wise 1.25 Gk.
c. two adjacent spans carrying γG Gk +γQ Qk with other span carrying the dead load only 
γG Gk.
Fixed end moments due to the continuity of stage 2 bending moments are subjected to the 
same load factors.
13.5.2 Design of continuous spans in floor slabs
The precast floor units are simply supported in stage 1, known as the temporary stage. 
The moment capacity of the unit is checked for self-weight, a construction allowance typi￾cally 1.5 kN/m2 (or any other construction plant, e.g. mobile elevated working platforms 
(MEWP) imposing point loads of up to 30 kN), plus the self-weight of the cast insitu struc￾tural topping (allowing for camber). This check is more critical than ordinary simply sup￾ported slabs because the requirements for the final prestress in a continuous design will be 
much less than in the simply supported case. For example comparing the worked Examples 
7.1 and 13.7 (for the same 250mm depth hcu, span and loading) the area of strands required 
in the simply supported span is 911mm2 compared with 539mm2 in the continuous spans.
For non-composite design rebars are site placed at the factory into top opened cores as 
shown in Figures 13.14, 13.23 and 13.26. The length of the opened cores is calculated from 
loading case III, shown in Figure 13.25, by adding the anchorage bond length lbd plus the 
shift al
 if necessary due to shear forces (BS EN 1992-1-1, Fig. 9.2) to the theoretical cut-off 
point. For hcu with a small number of cores, e.g. 6 no.×140mm width where it is desired 
to open and fill say 3 no. cores, it may be necessary to use 2 no. rebars per core to resist 
the maximum hogging moment MEd′ . The 2 no. rebars may be curtailed to 1 no. at their 
theoretical curtailment point, and reduced to zero at al
 beyond the point where MEd′ =0. 
In narrower cores, e.g. 11 no.×60mm width, where only 1 no. rebar is used, the number of 
filled cores is reduced just once as explained above, or half of them curtailed to achieve a 
staggered (rather than sudden) reduction in capacity. Top cover to the rebars should satisfy 
the durability requirements, but as this is nearly always XC1 for the reason that finishes are 488 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
applied, the minimum cover of 20mm is usually increased to allow for site tolerances, typi￾cally 25mm. It is not recommended to place site rebars in the (often narrow) longitudinal 
gaps between adjacent units.
For composite design, rebars in the top opened cores are not required as stage 2 hogging 
moments are resisted by the steel mesh plus (if necessary) additional loose rebars placed on 
top of the mesh, as shown in Figure 13.27. The diameter of the additional bars should not, 
if possible, be greater than 12mm in order to avoid complications with the top and bottom 
cover to the mesh, particularly if the depth of the topping is 75mm. There is a construction 
difficulty here – if possible the mesh should be placed so that the bars are orientated with 
mesh bars parallel to the span. However, as the sheets of mesh may be lapped by upturning 
the sheets to nestle together, the bars will sit on top of the transverse mesh bars. For this 
reason, the top cover to the mesh should be about 35–40mm to allow for H10–H12 bars 
with 25mm cover. Interface loops are positioned as necessary (Figure 12.19) and designed 
as per Section 12.4. The requirements may be greater than for simply supported composite 
slabs due to the greater load-bearing capacity of continuous spans.

13.5.3 Design calculations for continuous floor slabs
13.5.3.1 Non-composite floor units
Stage 1. Let w1 =self-weight of precast floor unit, per unit width, w0c=self-weight of wet 
insitu concrete in filled cores of length L0c from the end of the span, and wc=construction 
allowance, typically 1.5 kN/m2.
The effective span L of the precast unit is taken to the centre of bearing=clear 
span+min{0.5h; 0.5 lb}. Referring to Figure 13.28a
Ms1 = + ( ) w w 1 c c L w / 8 + ≤ L M c s / 2 R 2 0 02 (13.75)
After site rebars have been placed and the infill concrete in the top opened cores, in the lon￾gitudinal joints and between the ends of the precast units has hardened, the effective span 
for the continuous slab Lc is between the centres of supports=clear span+width of beam (or 
wall). For example, if supporting inverted-tee beams have a width of 600mm, and lb for the 
precast unit is 100mm, L=clear span+100mm and Lc=clear span+600mm, the difference 
Lc−L=500mm.
Stage 2 floor loads for the continuous spans are w2 = imposed dead loads, w3 = imposed 
live loads, per unit width. Referring to Figure 13.28b for the three spans AB, BC and 
CD of the composite slab, the final elastically distributed negative continuity moments 
in span BC are calculated as MB and MC. If MB and MC happen to be of equal negative 
magnitude then
Ms c 2 2 = + ( ) w w3 L M / 8 − B 2 (13.76)
When Ms1 and Ms2 are added together the construction allowance wc is removed such that
Ms c = + w L1 / 8 w L c s / 2 + ≤ M MsR 2 0 02 2 (13.77)

If MB and MC are unequal, the likely situation thanks to load cases IIIa or IIIb, Ms2,max is not 
at mid-span, then the reaction at support B is
FB2 =(w2 +w3) Lc/2−(MB −MC)/Lc (13.78)
Shear span a2 =FB2/(w2 +w3) (13.79)
Ms m2, ax = − F a B B 2 2   / ( ) w w 2 3 + + a M 2 2 2 (13.80)
Note that in some texts Mc is +ve according to global notation where clockwise moments 
are +ve.
For example, let (w2 +w3)=9.0 kN/m, Lc=10.0m, MB=−80 kNm and Mc=−50 kNm. FB2 =45.
0−(−80−−50)/10.0=48.0 kN, a=48.0/9.0=5.33m, Ms2,max =48.0×5.33−9.0×5.332/2−80=48.
0 kNm. A quick check on the arithmetic is that at mid-span Ms2 =9.0×10.02/8−65=47.5 kNm.
Of course the final position and magnitude of Ms,max also depends on w1, w0c, L and L0c, 
a rather complex expression if the length of top opened cores is different at either end. A 
simple spreadsheet may be used to calculate Ms at say intervals of span/50, particularly if 
line loads and point loads are involved.
Ultimate bending moments MEd1 and MEd2 are calculated in the same manner using the 
appropriate load factors given in Section 13.5.1.
13.5.3.2 Calculation of fixed end moments and final 
negative moments in continuous spans
Fixed end bending moments (FEM) are first calculated according to the flexural stiffness of 
each span of the slabs, using the compound value for the second moment of area, i.e. 4 Ecm
Ic,co/Lc for continuous spans and 3 Ecm Ic,co/Lc for a continuous span with a simply supported 
span with a pinned end. [The reader is reminded that the end rotation θ of any continuous 
element of stiffness EI and span L subjected to a bending moment M is given as θ=M/(4 
EI/L). For a pinned-ended element is θ=M/(3 EI/L). Also if M is acting at the remote end of 
the element then θ=M/(2 EI/L).]
Referring to Figure 13.28 for the three spans, the maximum service moment in the inte￾rior span BC is calculated for load case I, i.e. dead load only on the exterior spans AB and 
CD, with the full dead and live loads in the interior span. Load case III is used to calculate 
the maximum negative moment at the interior supports, and to check whether the section is 
negatively flexurally cracked, which will nearly always be the case, for the purpose of calcu￾lating the shear capacity VRd,cr. Load case II is not required for service moments.
Ultimate loads are applied using the same load cases as service loads. Load cases II and III are 
also used for calculating the minimum interior span moments and maximum support moments 
for the purpose of extending top rebars into the top opened cores into the interior span.
Referring to Figure 13.29a, the initial FEMs (clockwise is +ve) at interior supports are
At B   FEM / BA = +( ) w w 2 3 + Lc A, B 8 2 (13.81)
At B   FEM / BC = −( ) w w 2 3 + Lc B, C 12 2 (13.82)
At C   FEMCB = +( ) w w 2 3 + − L2
c B, C / 12 o( ) r FEMBC (13.83)
At C   FEMCD = −( ) w w 2 3 + Lc C, D / 8 2 (13.84)Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 491
The denominator of the FEM at the interior support B of the exterior span is 8 (not 12) 
because when the fixed end moment −Lc A, B / 12 2 at the exterior support A is released to 
become a pinned end 50% carry-over moment + , / 24 2 Lc AB is distributed to B. Then 
FEM / BA = +L L c A, B c 12 + = AB / 24 3 + = L L c AB c / 24 / + AB 8 2 ,
2 ,
2 ,
2 . Similarly for FEMCD.
The ‘out of balance’ or restoring moments M1 and M2 at supports B and C, respectively, 
are
M1 =− (FEMBA +FEMBC) (13.85)
M2 =− (FEMCB +FEMCD) (13.86)
(Note that suffixes 1 and 2 are used for supports B and C in the following analysis.)
For example, using the same loads and spans as in the previous exemplar, 
FEMBA =9.0×10.02/8=+112.5 kNm, FEMBC =9.0×10.02/12=−75.0 kNm. Then M1 =−
(+112.5−75.0)=−37.5 kNm. M2 =− (+75.0−112.5)=+37.5 kNm.
The stiffness terms for the rotation θ1 and θ2 of the supports at B and C due to out￾of-balance moments M1 and M2 are as follows. Assuming Ecm and Ic,co are the same for 
all spans, and letting shorthand EI =Ecm Ic,co, the rotational stiffness of support B due 
to M1 acting on the pin-ended span BA is k11 =M1/θ1 = 3 EI/LBA. Similarly, the rotational 
stiffness of support B due to M1 acting on the continuous span BC is k11 =M1/θ1 = 4 EI/
LBC. Then
k11 =3 EI/LBA +4 EI/LBC (13.87)
The rotational stiffness of support C due to M1 acting on the continuous span BC is k12 =M1/
θ2 =2 EI/LBC. Then
k12 =2 EI/LBC (13.88)
k21 =2 EI/LBC (13.89)
k22 =3 EI/LCD +4 EI/LBC (13.90)

The final distributed moments are equal to the sum of the rotations times flexural stiffness 
at each end of the span, plus the original fixed end moment, which is still present. Referring 
to Figure 13.29b, for support B, or end 1, MB is equal to rotation θ1 at that end of span BC 
times the stiffness there, i.e. M=4EI θ1/L, plus the rotation θ2 of the remote end times the 
stiffness there, i.e. M=2EI θ2/L, and finally plus the original FEMBC, as
MB =4EI θ1/LBC +2EI θ2/LBC +FEMBC (−ve, anticlockwise) (13.94)
MC =4EI θ2/LBC +2EI θ1/LBC +FEMBC (+ve, clockwise) (13.95)
The ultimate support moments MEd,B etc. are calculated using the same procedures using 
ultimate load factors according to BS EN 1990, Exp. 6.10a or 6.10b.
Referring to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 5.3.2.2 (4) where a beam or slab is continuous over a 
support which provides no restraint to rotation, the moment at the support may be reduced 
due to a local restraint at the cusp of the support by an amount ∆MEd where
Exp. 5.9 ∆MEd =FEd,sup t/8 (13.96)
where FEd,sup =ultimate design support reaction (from both sides of the support)
t=width of the support, e.g. thickness of wall, width of beam
Continuing the exemplar. MB =(4×47×1012 ×−0.001596/10000)+(2×47×1012 ×0.00159
6/10000)−75.0=−30.0+15.0−75.0=−90.0 kNm, anti-clockwise causing an anti-clockwise 
rotation at B, leading to a sagging moment in the exterior span AB. By inspection MC =+90 
kNm. Note that the initial FEMs were 112.5 and 75.0 kNm, so the final negative moment 
is roughly their average, to be expected for equal spans.
To reader may note that in this example the k and θ terms and MB and MC moments all contain 
the common factor EI/L, which may be eliminated from the calculation. Thus k11 =k22 =3+4=7 
and k12 =k21 =2. EI θ1/L=+37.5-3.5×-37.5v(2−3.5×7)=168.75/−22.5=−7.5. MB =4×−7.5+
2×7.5−75.0=−30.0+15.0−75.0=−90.0 kNm.
End reactions due to distributed moments
FB =(MB −MC)/LBC (13.97)
FC =−VB (13.98)Cantilevers and continuous slabs and beams 493
These moments and shear forces are added to the free Stage 2 values. In the example, the 
sagging moment in the interior span is Ms2 =112.5−90.0=+22.5 kNm, i.e. only 25% of the 
negative moment at the support.
The negative support moments are not redistributed in psc elements, owing to the lack of 
ductility when the tendons in the tension zone of a psc element are already stressed close to 
fp,max, about 1516 N/mm2. The UK NA to BS EN 1992-1-1, clause 5.1.3 (1)P (NA to BS EN 
1992-1-1, 2004) states that for case IV loading (all spans fully loaded) the support moments 
should be reduced by 20% with a consequential increase in span moments. In the above exam￾ple the moment redistribution is 0.2×90=18.0 kNm, increasing Ms2 =22.5+18.0=+40.5 
kNm. However, if the loading arrangement in this example is case I, and the dead loads 
acting on the exterior spans is say 4.5 kN/m (50% of the total) the support moments reduce 
to MB =−67.5 kNm and Ms2 =112.5−67.5=+45.0 kNm, almost the same result. If load case 
III is used (maximum in 2 adjacent spans) MB =−97.5 kNm and MC =+60.0 kNm, then 
Ms2 =+34.3 kNm, and is not critical.
13.5.3.3 Distributed secondary moments due to relaxation 
and creep in prestressed elements
Known as ‘secondary’, or parasitic bending moments, and relevant only to psc elements, 
positive bending moments develop at the support due to creep deformations and long-term 
relaxation of tendons. The effect is manifest in the upward camber of long span, lightly 
loaded floor or roof slabs, exacerbated by high temperatures or differential temperatures 
on the top and bottom surfaces. The ends of the psc elements attempt to rotate negatively 
(in the same direction as camber, but opposing gravity loads), thus breaking the bond with 
the cast insitu infill over the supports, possibly within several months (or one hot summer) 
after construction. It is therefore necessary to provide rebars near the bottom of the precast 
units spanning across the infill joint. This is a feature common in psc bridge beam design.
The following expressions are for the growth effects of creep, which have a much greater 
effect than for long-term relaxation, by a factor of 3–4. Referring to Figure 13.30, second￾ary fixed end bending moments develop at supports B and C in the exterior spans as
FEMBA =−FEMCD =−1.5×[Ψ Ppmi−(Ppmi−Ppo)] zcp (13.99)
and at supports B and C in the interior span as
FEMBC =−FEMCB =[Ψ Ppmi−(Ppmi−Ppo)] zcp (13.100)
where
Ψ=1−e-ψ28 (13.101)
is the visco-elastic creep growth coefficient after installation and hardening of cast insitu
infill at the ends of the precast units, and ψ28 is the creep coefficient over this interval of 
time. As explained in Section 11.2.1 this is typically ψ28 =1.20, then Ψ=1−e−1.2 =0.70.

For the same loading case fixed end gravity moments are due to imposed dead loads only. 
These moments are distributed as above, resulting in moments and shear forces of opposite sign. 
The final moments are restrained using rebars placed about 20mm above the bottom of top 
opened cores, typically 2 or 3 no. H10 to H16 bars per unit×about 600–800mm embedment in 
each side of the support, or at the bottom of the longitudinal joint between solid planks units.

13.6 DESIGN OF REINFORCEMENT IN OPENED CORES OR TOPPING

and/or with top pretensioned tendons
See Section 13.2.2 and Eqs. 13.10–13.24.

Mesh reinforcement is provided to cater for minimum area As,min

For example, let t=75mm, fckT =25 N/mm2, fctmT =2.56 N/mm2, fyk =500 N/mm2
As,min =max{0.0013×1000×75; 0.26×2.56×1000×75/500}=100mm2/m, use A142mesh.
Additional reinforcement in the form of loose rebars is provided to cater for the ultimate 
negative moment MEd′ . Bars are typically placed at 200mm spacing to align with the longi￾tudinally orientated bars in the mesh

The procedure is the same as in Section 13.3.2, except that the distance to the curtailment 
point=distance to the point of zero moment plus the anchorage length plus the shift d″ due 
to shear. The factor α2 =1 is to allow for the possibility that the infill concrete may not be 
homogeneous between the bars and the inside surface of the core.
13.6.4 Service stress due to prestress plus negative flexural stress
For non-composite units, see Section 13.2.3 and Eqs. 13.25 and 13.26.
For composite slabs, see Section 13.2.4.2 and Eqs. 13.32 and 13.33.
The flexural stresses Ms
′/Zb,co and Ms
′/Zt,co are calculated at the end of the transmission 
zone lpt plus the gap between the end of the unit and centre of support, where the negative 
moment reduces to Ms lpt ′, .
In both cases, the combined stress at the top of the unit is likely to be critical, particu￾larly in long spans where the negative moment is much greater than the positive mid-span 
moment.
All section properties are based on the uncracked section modulus. If the tension at the 
top is exceeded, the shear capacity is based on the cracked section VRd,cr or VRd,crc according 
to Section 13.2.6, plus the shear capacity of filled cores VRd,t.
Example 13.7
Calculate MsR at the supports and mid-span for the interior slab in a three-span continu￾ous 250 mm depth prestressed hcu shown in cross section and elevation in Figure 13.31. 
The section properties, material data and prestress are as given in Example 7.1. Exposure 
class to the bottom and top surfaces is XC1. The effective span of the hcu is L= 9.8 m. 
After insitu concrete at the ends of the hcu has hardened the centre-centre span of the 
slabs is Lc = 10.0 m. As there are no tendons in the top of the hcu the negative moment 
of resistance due to continuity is to be provided by placing rebars of strength fyk = 500 
N/mm2 into the top of 140 mm wide opened cores. The slots are filled with insitu
concrete of the same strength as the precast unit fcki = 45 N/mm2 and known den￾sity 24.5 kN/m3. The distance to the curtailment of these bars in the interior span 
(point E) is determined in Example 13.8 (ultimate design). Use self-weight of grouted 
unit = 3.63 kN/m2, imposed dead loads = 3.30 kN/m2, ceiling 0.5 kN/m2 and imposed 
live load = 7.5 kN/m2.
Using the four load combinations Case I to IV, given in Figure 13.25, check MsR against 
the characteristic combination of the positive (sagging) design service moment Ms and the 
negative hogging Ms
′. Plot graphs of bending moment distributions for MsR and the criti￾cal Ms, taking lpt=605mm (from Example 6.1).
Calculate the requirement for secondary positive reinforcement allowing for creep of 
prestress at the ends of the psc unit.
Given that the results in Table 13.2 are from further analysis of the same hcu used in 
Example 13.7 in both three-span and five-span continuous floor slabs, discuss the differ￾ences in mid-span and support moments for the two arrangements.
Solution
At supports
MsR is calculated according to Example 7.1 except that the negative bending moments 
due to continuity will increase creep losses. As the critical load case for the positive Ms
is case I, the negative support moment Ms
′ is required for imposed dead loads (excluding 
services), of 1.2×3.30=3.96 kN/m.496 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

MsR is critical at the bottom fibre, then
MsR =(11.66+3.80)×10.701=165.44 kNm
At mid-span
MsR is calculated according to Example 7.1 except that the negative bending moments due 
to continuity will also reduce the bending stress and increase creep losses at mid-span. 
The positive moment is based on a continuous span Lc=10.0m, as 8.32×10.02/8=104.0

MsR is critical at the bottom fibre, then
MsR =(12.66+3.80)×10.701=176.18 kNm
Calculation of positive service moments Ms1 and Ms2 in the interior span BC
It is necessary at this stage to decide on the number of filled cores. Based on the experi￾ence in Example 13.1 this is taken as 3, giving the same self-weight 1.245 kN/m2.
It is shown later in Example 13.8 that the ultimate negative moment MEd′ =−214 
kNm. Taking the lever arm zʹ=197mm from Example 13.1 A′
s =214×106/
(197×0.87×500)≈2500mm2. Therefore use 6 no. H25 top bars (2946mm2), 2 no. in 
each core. The 6 no. bars may be curtailed to 3 no. at the appropriate curtailment point. 
Also from Example 13.8, the length of the top opened cores in the interior span is 3.82m.
Therefore the mid-span service moment Ms1 =1.2×3.63×9.82/8+1.2×1.245×3.822/2
=52.3+10.9=63.2 kNm498 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Stage 2 calculations are carried out using Eqs. 13.76–13.95 for load cases I, II, III and 
IV, and are summarised in Table 13.3.
From load case I, Ms,max =142.4 kNm<MsR =176.18 kNm
From load case III, the negative moment ′ Ms m, ax =−150.6 kNm
Combined prestress plus flexural bending stress is calculated at the end of the transmis￾sion length lpt plus half the gap between the ends of the precast units. As the combined 
stresses in the top of the section will certainly exceed fctm, this check is carried out first, 
after which the flexurally cracked section properties, including the transformed area of 
top bars in opened cores, are calculated.
The negative bending moment ′ Ms l, pt is at lpt=0.605m plus half the gap between the ends 
of the hcu=0.1m, i.e. at 0.705m from the centre of support B.
Total reaction at support B, FB =75.3 (from Table 13.3)+4.56×9.8/2+1.49×3.8=
102.3 kN. The total UDL=4.56+1.49+13.56=19.41 kN/m
Then ′ Ms l, pt =102.3×0.705−19.41×0.7052/2−150.6=+67.3−150.6=−83.3 kNm
At the top fibre the combined tensile stress=prestress+flexural stress, where (from 
above) σt=−1.90 N/mm2
Eq. 13.26 ′ ft m, ax =−1.90−83.3/10.060=−10.18 N/mm2 <<−3.80 N/mm2, therefore the 
section is flexurally cracked and the shear capacity is based on ′ VRd,cr.

If the long-term values are used, where the transformed area of top bars includes the 
creep factor 1 +ψ28 of 2.20, the effective value for ′ Zb c, , o ef is now 9.77 × 106mm3, and is less 
critical. The compressive flexural stress at the end of the hcu is 150.6/9.77 = 15.41 N/mm2. 
In fact, the limit could be taken as 0.567 fcki = 25.5 N/mm2 as the prestress is not 
active.
Finally, the effective value for ′ Zb c, , o ef in the 1200×250mm solid section between 
the ends of the hcu is 8.06×106mm3, giving a stress=150.6/8.06=18.68 N/mm2 <25.5

Discussion - on the service bending moments at mid-span and at the supports of inte￾rior and exterior floor spans in three-span and five-span continuous slab arrangement 
given in Table 13.2. All mid-span moments include Ms1 =+63.5 kNm for the simply sup￾ported self-weight of the hcu and (wet insitu concrete) filled cores.
Starting with a single interior span with encastre supports for maximum UDL 
the support fixed-end moment (FEM) = −113.0 kNm and the mid-span moment 
= / 24 M 2 s c wL +Ms1 = 56.5 + 63.5 = +120.0 kNm. The flexibility of continuity at supports 
in the three-span decreases the support moment to -90.6 kNm (a difference of 22.4 
kNm) such that Ms increases to +120.0 + 22.4 = +142.4 kNm (Figure 13.25, Case I). 
In the exterior span, where one end is simply supported with zero support moment 
Ms increases to approximately +142.4 + 0.5 × 90.6 = +187.7 kNm, but because the maxi￾mum moment is not a mid-span then Ms = +189.9 kNm (Figure 13.25, Case II). This 
would be the critical design value to be checked against MsR. The maximum support 
moment of −150.6 kNm is for the load case III in Figure 13.25. This is 1.33 times the 
FEM, a ratio that is simply a function of the maximum and minimum UDL’s in the 
three spans. Note that the maximum possible ratio of final moment/FEM is 1.50 for a 
two-span slab with the maximum UDL in both spans, i.e. −wL2/12 increases to −wL2/8 
after moment distribution.
In the five-span slab, moment distribution in the central interior span is now affected by 
the flexibility of the first and second interior supports, so one would expect a reduction in 
support moments. Indeed, this decreases the support moment to −71.5 kNm (a difference 
of 41.5 kNm) such that Ms increases to +120.0+41.5=+161.5 kNm. See Figure 3.4, case 
2. By the same procedure as above (for three-span) Ms In the exterior span increases to 
+187.8 kNm, almost the same value as above (+189.9 kNm, as found in standard moment 
distribution texts). The maximum support moment of −155.7 kNm is for load case 4 
in Figure 3.4. This is 1.38 times the FEM, a ratio that is again a function of the maxi￾mum and minimum UDL’s in the five spans. As expected, the maximum interior support 
moment of −136.1 kNm is not critical. It is informative to note that if all five spans are 
subjected to the maximum UDL (Figure 3.4, case 1 plus stage 1) the maxima are −142.7 
kNm and +166.9 kNm, both 10% less than the maximum moments in Table 13.2.

MRd is calculated according to Example 9.1 except that the prestrain is 
εpo =999/195000=0.005123 (0.005234 in Example 9.1) and therefore MRd =247.2 kNm

13.7 NEGATIVE MOMENTS AND TOP REINFORCEMENT 
FOR FIRE RESISTANCE ≥ R90
Referring to BS EN 1992-1-2, clause 5.7.3 (BS EN 1992-1-2, 2004), for continuous solid 
slabs, excluding cantilevers, the area and curtailment distances of the top reinforcement for 
fire resistance≥R90 (90 minutes) should extend for a distance x≤0.3 Lc. Refer to the Code’s 
clause 5.6.3 (3) and Fig. 5.6 (reproduced in Figure 13.34). There is no requirement for R60 
resistance. Although the clause does not specifically refer to hcu, the filled cores and area of 
topping in composite slabs raise the proportion of solid material close to that of solid units, 
and therefore the following is recommended.
The area of top reinforcement required at distance x from the support is
A x s s ( ) A x ( ) Lc Exp. 5.11         ′ = ′ at the support 1 × − 2.5 / (13.105)
At x=0.3 Lc, A x s ( )′ =0.25 As
′ at the support
Lc is the greater effective length of the main or adjacent span.
Subtract the area of mesh per 1.2m wide unit in composite slabs.
In two-span continuous slabs where no restraint to bending at the end supports is 
provided either by design or inadvertently in construction, such as tie bars in the ends 
of hcu lapped to torsionally stiff edge beams, the minimum area of top reinforcement 
should be As

13.8 DEFLECTIONS IN CONTINUOUS SLABS DUE TO 
GRAVITY LOADS AND NEGATIVE MOMENTS
13.8.1 Deflection in main span in non-composite units
These are calculated in the same manner as for simply supported spans, as given in Section 
11.2.1, at least in terms of the use of creep factors ψ1, ψ28 and 0.8 ψ∞, with the addition 
of negative (upward) deflections due to stage 2 fixed end moments. For the latter load case 
I is used, with maximum loads in the interior span and minimum imposed dead loads in 
the exterior spans. For multiple spans, e.g. five spans, the alternate loading pattern is used. 
The camber and deflection due to self-weight of the psc unit, and any wet insitu topping, is 
based on the effective span L. All other long-term deflections and movement after finishes 
are based on the centres of supports, i.e. continuity span Lc.
As expected from the magnitude of negative continuity moments, deflections in continu￾ous spans are rarely critical, as the design of interior span is clearly limited by the magnitude 
of the support moments. Even where the exterior spans are relatively shorter than the inte￾rior, say ½ of the interior span, deflections are not critical. For example in the continuous 
slab design in Example 13.7 the upward immediate (no creep or quasi-permanent ψ2 factors) 504 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
deflection due to support moments of −90.6 kNm is −ML2/8 EI=−90.6×106 ×100002/8×36
283×1296×106 =−24mm. This is about ⅔ of the downward deflection due to gravity loads 
5wL4/384 EI=5×13.56×100004/384×36283×1296×106 =+37mm, so the net deflection is 
only +13mm.
Another difference compared with simply supported spans is that the visco-elastic 
increase in upward camber after installation is reduced by the positive continuity restraint 
based on the creep growth function Ψ in Eqs. 13.99–13.101. The restraint is not an external 
moment, but a virtual restraint of the internal moment [Ψ Ppmi−(Ppmi−Ppo)] zcp. The fixed 
end moments that develop due to this force, given by Eqs. 13.100 and 13.101 are distributed 
to give virtual positive support moments MB and MC that have the equivalent effect of reduc￾ing the increase in camber by +MB Lc
2/16 Ecm Ic.co plus +MC Lc
2/16 Ecm Ic.co. For example in 
the continuous slab design in Example 13.7 MB =−MC =+54.9 kNm, and so the restraining 
deflection is +54.9×106 ×100002/8×36283×1296×106 =+14mm.
Long-term deflections after the insitu concrete in the top opened cores has hardened are 
based on the second moment of area Ic,co, which should include the section properties of the 
reinforced filled cores, at least to the end of the filled cores. For example in Example 13.7 
with 3 no. filled cores the gross second moment of area Ic,co =1602×106mm4, an increase of 
23% over the basic hcu section over a length of 0.38×span.

Calculations for the long-term camber are from Eqs. 11.6 and 11.7, minus the restraint 
by the creep growth function Ψ for the internal moment [Ψ Ppmi−(Ppmi−Ppo)] zcp in Eqs.

Long-term deflection due to self-weight, infill in joints and top opened cores, imposed 
dead and live loads are from Eqs. 11.8 to 11.10 minus the restraint from end moments -MB
and -MC which have to be calculated individually for self-weight (including filled cores) 
-MB1, dead -MB2 and quasi-permanent live loads ψ2-MB3. All deflections are based on the 
centres of bearing continuity span Lc.

Calculate the long-term deflection and the deflection after applying finishes for the 250mm 
depth prestressed hcu shown in cross section and elevation in Figure 13.31. The section 
properties, material data, prestress, spans and loads are from Example 13.7. The net deflec￾tions at transfer and at installation of the precast unit are from Example 11.1. The floor slab 
is for use in offices. Check the Code’s limits if the floor finishes are brittle.
Solution
From Example 13.7, considering the prestress at the support the final pretensioning force 
is Ppo =838.1 kN. Then Ppmi−Ppo =172.1 kN
From Example 11.1, the net deflection at transfer=−12.9mm, and net (upward) deflec￾tion at installation=−40.9+19.8=−21.1mm.

Solution
To determine the number and length of top opened cores, first calculate the positive sec￾ondary bending moment due to creep and design the bottom rebars. From Example 13.7, 
Eq. 13.98 FEMBA =−FEMCD =−1.5×(0.70×1010.2−172.1)×82.2×10−3 =−66.0 kNm.
The imposed dead load=1.2×2.0=2.4 kN/m. Then the net FEMBA =−FEMCD =−66.0
+2.40×10.02/8=−36.0 kNm
Eq. 13.99FEMBC =−FEMCB =+44.0−20.0=+24.0 kNm
After distribution the final service and ultimate support moments are MB =+28.7 kNm 
and MEdB =1.25×28.7=+35.9 kNm
Effective depth to bottom rebars (with 20mm cover from the bottom of the cores) is d″
=250+75−35−20−8=262mm, then

The self-weight of 2 top opened cores=0.83 kN/m2, or ultimate self-weight=1.24 
kN/m per unit width.
The total ultimate dead load=1.25×1.2×(3.63+2.14+2.00)=11.65 kN/m.
The distance to zero moment xʹ from the support is by solving the quadratic 
58.25 xʹ−11.65 xʹ

Precast prestressed concrete walls
14.1 APPLICATIONS OF PRESTRESSED CONCRETE WALLS
Precast prestressed concrete walls are used in a variety of applications and building 
types. For example: retaining walls, boundary walls, fire walls, blast walls and external 
envelope walls. The wall panels can be used with steel, insitu or precast framed struc￾tures, most commonly in industrial and agricultural buildings. Prestressed walls are 
often an economic solution due to the reduction in reinforcement quantities, reduction 
in concrete usage when hollow core walls (hcw*) are used and the efficient long line pro￾duction methods available. The walls can be designed as horizontal spanning, vertical 
spanning and as cantilevers. Precast tanks can also be constructed above and/or below 
ground for liquid storage using prestressed wall panels – this is a common applica￾tion for slurry storage in the agricultural industry. This chapter focuses on prestressed 
design for soil and grain retaining walls, boundary walls and non-loadbearing walls in 
buildings.
*the abbreviation hcw for hollow core walls is used to distinguish between these and hol￾low core units (hcu) used in floors and roofs.
14.2 RETAINING WALLS
Prestressed wall panels are widely used to retain soil, grain, aggregates and many other 
materials. When designing walls to retain materials, it is very important to note the effect 
that heaped material has on the pressure applied to the walls. The intention to store heaped 
material needs to be clarified and the level of overfill above the top of wall was agreed upon 
during the early design stage.
The wall panels require a medium/high axial prestress with a relatively small eccentricity 
to control sideways camber at installation in the absence of an opposing deflection due to 
self-weight. To avoid any tensile stress, the eccentricity zcp should lie within the middle third 
of the thickness h of the section, i.e. zcp ≤h /6.
14.2.1 Vertical spanning retaining wall
In the following Example 14.1 a solid prestressed wall was used to retain the backfill mate￾rial at one level of an underground car park. The wall spanned vertically from an insitu
capping beam to the ground floor level hollow core floor slab. Figure 14.1 shows the loca￾tion of the walls within the structure. The corbel at the top of the wall was added with a 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003319450-14Precast prestressed concrete walls 513
secondary pour onto the fill face. The corbel reinforcement was tied into the mould with 
the prestressed strand but also projected above the fill level of the mould. The concrete for 
the main body of the wall was poured, then a shutter was set onto the filled mould and the 
corbel was poured. In some locations, the hcu spanned onto this corbel for support. The 
eccentricity of this load and the moment generated were ignored in the design as it provides 
a beneficial effect by, very slightly, reducing the moment on the wall stem when under load 
from the retained material (Figures 14.2 and 14.3).
The wall was designed as simply supported and restrained at its top and bottom by the 
floor diaphragm which was constructed from a 250mm depth hollow core units (hcu) with 
a 75mm depth structural topping. The horizontal loading applied to the retaining walls was 
transferred through the floor diaphragm into the shear wall stability system for the main 
structure. The effective span was taken as 3.50m, with no reduction taken for the bearing 
length when calculating the shear forces and moments.

Referring to the established procedures for the serviceability and ultimate moments of resis￾tance, and the ultimate shear capacity given in Sections 6.2.2, 6.2.3, 7.2.4, 9.3.1, 10.2.2 and 
10.2.3, the resistance provided by the prestressed wall panel is as follows.

Calculate the serviceability and ultimate moments of resistance MsR and MRd for the 
200mm thickness prestressed solid wall panel shown in elevation in Figure 14.1 and in

Table 14.2 shows the design moments, the moments of resistance and the ultilisation 
ratio (i.e. design/resistance). As expected, for solid units under exposure conditions 
of XC3, the wall panel is clearly critical at the serviceability limit state.
Anchorage bond length to full MRd =651+0.19×9.3×(1497−1055.9)/1.96=1048mm,

lb =250+75=325mm. The width of panel at the centroidal axis is 2377mm (ignoring the 
infill between panels). Check the cracking moment of resistance to determine whether the 
flexurally crack shear capacity VRd,cr is required.

Table 14.2 shows the design shear forces, shear capacity and the ultilisation ratio (i.e. 
design/capacity), clearly not critical. The cracking moment of resistance at the inside face 
Mc=16.291×(5.71+1.64)=119.7 kNm>Ms=81.8 kNm, therefore the section is not flex￾urally cracked and VRd,cr is not required.
Calculations for the ultimate bearing capacity of wall panel at the edges of the com￾posite hollow core slab, where fckT =30 N/mm2, are found to be in the order of 1800 kN, 
and therefore not critical.
Similarly, the long-term sideways camber of the wall panel is found to be approxi￾mately 3.2mm, which is completely negated by the soil and surcharge pressures, and 
therefore not critical.
14.2.2 Horizontal spanning retaining wall
Figures 14.5 and 14.6 show a typical steel-framed grain store with precast prestressed wall 
panels. The panels span horizontally between the main steel columns. The panel at the base 
of the wall is subjected to the highest pressure from the retained material and in some cases 
this panel is cast with projecting bars along its bottom edge to tie into the insitu floor slab. 
The panels are stacked on a foundation to the design height required.
Figure 14.7 shows a section and elevation of a grain store constructed using 250mm thick 
prestressed hcw, the units were manufactured with a 9-core profile.
Table  14.3 shows the strand pattern and applied prestress forces. The eccentricity 
zcp =28.0mm is within the kern of the unit, i.e. zcp <ZT/Ac=51mm and therefore no tension 
exists at the outside surface (top, as cast) at transfer.
Two cores were removed from the slip-forming machine to create a solid zone in the 
panel, this solid zone was used to post-fix the restraint clips to the wall panels using concrete 
screws. A typical restraint clip detail can be seen in Figure 14.8 and they are also visible in 
service on Figure 14.6. The clips are cranked to suit the thickness of the column flange and 
fixed to the wall panel using a post-fixed anchor such as a concrete screw or alternatively a 
cast-in fixing such as a socket or channel.
The clips are designed to restrain the wall panels against wind loading during construction 
and when the grain store is empty. During installation, the horizontal joint between the wall 
panels is bedded with structural mortar to make the building weather-tight and also to pro￾vide a shear key. The vertical joint between panel ends is typically finished with a mastic seal.
The following calculation determines the pressure applied to the retaining walls in a grain 
store that is designed for level fill material, i.e. no heaped material is permitted.520 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

Referring to Figure 14.9
Maximum horizontal pressure pm =ka γ h=23.4 kN/m2

Ultimate moment MEd =1.35 Ms=104.2 kNm
Ultimate shear VEd =1.35 pa b le/2=85.1 kN (ditto for trapezoidal load 87.7 kN)
The capacity of the prestressed panel is calculated in the same way as in Examples 14.1 and 
14.2 and compared against the design shear and moments from the analysis.
Table 14.4 shows the design moments and shear forces, the moments of resistance, shear 
capacity and the ultilisation ratio (i.e. design/resistance). As expected, the hcw panel is critical 
at the serviceability limit state. The cracking moment of resistance at the inside face Mc=99.1 
kNm>Ms=77.2 kNm, therefore the section is not flexurally cracked and VRd,cr is not required.
Transverse load distribution is possible by transferring load through the shear keys 
between adjacent walls. The capacity of the shear key is checked in accordance with BS EN 
1168:2005+A3:2011 Clause 4.3.3.2.3. The following calculation checks the 250mm hcw 
in the example

the peak loading on the bottom panel is treated as a line load.

Horizontal pressure at bottom of panel p1 =ka γ h2 =19.5 kN/m2

Equivalent line load, second panel weq2 =pa2 b=21.0 kN/m
Peak line load to distribute wd =weq −weq2 =4.7 kN/m
This value is less than the calculated value of vRdj=30.7 kN/m, by inspection no issues dis￾tributing the line load through the shear key.

directly loaded panel=45%. This load is multiplied by 1.25 in accordance with Clause C.4d)
Service load on bottom panel ws,ls=weq2 +(0.45 wd)=23.1 kN/m

Design output with no distribution
Service moment MsR =77.2 kNm

With transverse distribution, the service load case can be reduced by approximately 10% 
and the ultimate load cases reduced by approximately 8%. This distribution of loading 
may allow a reduction in the thickness of the wall and/or a reduction in the number of pre￾stressed strands required in the design.
14.3 BOUNDARY AND SECURITY WALLS
Precast prestressed wall panels used in conjunction with an insitu base are an efficient and 
common solution for the boundary walls of prisons and other secure facilities. The walls are 
manufactured with holes through the section to allow fixing of the site reinforcement for the 
insitu base. Figure 14.10 shows a wall and base section, the wall is 175mm thick and 5.2m 
in height above ground level, the base is 2.5m wide and 600mm deep. The geometry shown 
is a fairly typical arrangement for this type of construction although the base geometry will 
be governed by the wind loading and any ground-bearing pressure limitations specific to the 
site. The calculation of the bearing pressures and the design of the insitu base is outside the 
scope of this book.Precast prestressed concrete walls 525
Wind load design is in accordance with BS EN 1991, Part 1-4 (BS EN 1991-1-4, 2005) 
and NA to BS EN 1991, Part 1-4 (NA to BS EN 1991-1-4, 2005).
The following calculation for the wind load considers the worst case at a free edge using 
Zone A and B coefficients from Table 7.9 of BS EN 1991-1-4. During the design process, the 
wind load is calculated at the different zones along the length of the wall, with the loading 
being reduced as you move away from a free edge. The detailed design process can allow a 
reduction in the strand pattern in the walls and a reduction in the width of the insitu base. 
Normally the wall thickness and base depth are kept consistent. Note that the wall and 
base need to be checked for the temporary wind load case during construction, the erec￾tion sequence may result in sections of wall being subjected to free edge conditions. The 
Figure 14.10 Section through boundary wall and base.526 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
temporary wind loading can be reduced with the seasonal factor and the probability factor 
being adjusted in accordance with the time of year the erection is taking place and the return 
period respectively. Both of these values are 1.0 in the calculation for the permanent wind 
load case. The directional factor can be used to reduce the wind loading in the permanent 
and the temporary case if there is certainty regarding the orientation of the walls, a conser￾vative approach is to use 1.0.

of 50years which will result in a probability factor of 1.0.

Table  14.5 shows the strand pattern and applied prestress forces. The eccentricity

Table 14.6 shows the design moments and shear forces, the moments of resistance, shear

Mc=72.7 kNm>Ms=53.4 kNm, therefore the section is not flexurally cracked and VRd,cr is 
not required.
Figure  14.11 shows the reinforcement cage for the insitu base installed and ready for 
the prestressed wall panels to be erected. Figure 14.12 shows the wall panels in position, 
propped off kentledge blocks and ready for the insitu base to be poured.
14.4 NON-LOAD-BEARING WALLS IN BUILDINGS
Prestressed wall panels provide a robust solution for internal partitions and external enve￾lopes. They are typically manufactured in thicknesses from 100mm to 250mm with an 
interlocking tongue and groove side profile.
14.4.1 Fire walls
Prestressed wall panels can be used as fire walls to provide compartmentation in buildings 
with fire resistance of up to 240 minutes achievable for non-load-bearing and load-bearing 
walls. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 in BS EN 1992, Part 1-2 (BS EN 1992-1-2, 2004) provide details 
on the criteria that satisfy the EI and REI requirements. Figure 14.13 shows a fire wall in a 
whiskey distillery constructed from prestressed wall panels. In this building, the wall panels 
were installed inside the flanges of the steel columns. The fire resistance of the panels was 
EI 120. The horizontal joints were bedded with a structural mortar and the geometry of the

BS EN 1992-1-2. Fire resistance mastic was used to seal the vertical interface between the 
steel column and the precast wall. Table 14.7 gives the fire resistance EI provided by wall 
thickness.
Figure 14.14 shows a paper mill that was constructed using prestressed hcw attached 
to a steel frame. The walls were typically stacked from foundation level on top of each 
other and restrained back to the steel structure using two connection types. The standard 
detail used for the majority of walls is shown in Figure 14.15. This consisted of a folded 
steel plate and an L-bolt that was located into an RSA welded to the steel column. The 
folded plate restrained the wall panels and also acted as a shutter for the thixotropic 
grout that was used to fill the vertical joint between the ends of the wall panels. The grout 
infill was a requirement in the fire strategy for the bottom 7 m of the building, above the 
7 m level the vertical joint was infilled with mineral wool. Figure 14.16 shows the parapet 
level restraint details. The wall panels were manufactured with preformed holes to allow

The walls were lifted using bespoke steel brackets with a lifting pin running through 
preformed holes in the wall, the design of the brackets meant that the walls could be deliv￾ered to site flat on the trailer, pitched to the vertical position using the brackets and lifted 
into position in one operation. Figure 14.17 shows a wall being lifted into position on the 
building.

Off-site benefits and temporary works
15.1 BENEFITS OF PRECAST CONSTRUCTION
15.1.1 Off-site benefits
The terms off-site manufacture and modern methods of construction are often used to 
describe the process and systems employed to design, manufacture and erect precast ele￾ments and structures on site. The construction industry uses precast concrete in its many 
and varied forms in a wide range of applications and building types. Developers, building 
contractors, engineers, architects and the end users can all benefit from the advantages 
provided by precast and prestressed concrete elements and the structures created using this 
form of construction. These benefits range from improved Health & Safety, factory environ￾ment quality control, construction programme reduction and compliance with the demands 
of statutory regulations such as fire resistance and energy performance.
A full understanding of the benefits of precast concrete requires a holistic approach to be 
taken by designers and specifiers – this will allow the true value and impact of using precast 
to be assessed.
A number of the benefits of precast structures can be seen in Figure 15.1. This shows an 
inner city site, no scaffolding is required, edge protection is visible on the top of the walls, 
windows and aluminium cladding have been installed off site and the building footprint is 
extremely close to the site boundary maximising the available area.
15.1.2 Health & safety
Traditional build construction is labour intensive with a high number of site-based opera￾tives and a considerable amount of equipment and materials required on site. The use of 
precast in buildings reduces the number of operatives on site with only a small fitting crew 
required to erect the precast elements; the operatives, equipment and materials that would 
be used on the construction site are essentially used at the factory production site. A rela￾tively small amount of concrete, grout and reinforcement materials are required on site to 
connect the precast elements. The site operatives that are based on site are there for less time 
when building with precast therefore reducing risk.
Any residual Health & Safety risks associated with casting concrete are moved from the 
site environment to a factory environment, which allows for any risks to be managed in a 
much more controlled and effective manner.
A precast structure can be constructed without the need for scaffolding and this mini￾mises the number of operatives working at height and also minimises the time that opera￾tives spend working at height. Precast elements such as walls, floors and stairs can have

edge protection systems mounted to them at ground level prior to being erected therefore 
providing a very safe system of work.
The installation of windows and doors in precast cladding and sandwich panels allows 
the installation of these items to be carried out at ground level, removing the need for this 
trade to work at height.
The casting of mechanical and electrical (M&E) services into precast elements removes 
the need for tracking of walls on site, which reduces manual work with power tools and the 
production of dust and noise (tracking is the term used to describe the process of cutting 
tracks into walls to receive post installed conduits typically for electrical services).
Temporary works required on precast structures are usually very simple to design and 
easy to erect and control on site. Walls and columns for example are propped using propri￾etary push-pull props (props with both compression and tension capacity) designed using 
simple methods. Precast floors, on the rare occasion that they need to be propped, typically 
use ‘acrow’ type touch props at midspan.
15.1.3 Quality control
Precast concrete manufacturers may acquire, among others, certification to ISO9001 
Quality Management System, ISO14001 Environmental Management System, ISO45001 
Occupational Health & Safety Management and BES6001 Responsible Sourcing of 
Construction Products. These certificates are issued by the auditing body once the pre￾scribed standards are met. Each certificate is valid for a certain duration after which the 
precast company must go through the recertification process.
Figure 15.1 Student accommodation precast structure in Leeds.Off-site benefits and temporary works 535
The concrete used for the precast products must be sourced from an accredited batch￾ing plant, where third-party accreditation of the batching plant can be provided by British 
Standard Institute (BSI) or Quality Scheme for Ready Mixed Concrete (QSRMC).
When precast products have a Eurocode product standard they can be CE marked by 
certified auditors to demonstrate compliance with the design and manufacturing standards 
set out for that product. For example, BS EN 1168 is the product standard for Hollow core 
slabs that takes precedence over other related codes; this standard contains design, tolerance 
and other specific requirements that are not provided in the guidance in other Eurocodes 
such as BS EN 1992 and BS EN 13369.
All reinforcement used in the precast products is sourced from companies that are certi￾fied by the Certification Authority for Reinforcing Steels (CARES). CARES is an interna￾tional provider of assured certification for reinforcement bars and prestressing strand.
15.1.4 Sustainability
Precast concrete is manufactured from aggregates that are available in almost every country in 
the world and precast manufacturing facilities are often situated in close proximity to the mar￾ket they supply into. The use of locally available aggregates reduces transportation distances 
and subsequently reduces energy usage. There is also the option to use recycled aggregates in 
some products. A tonne of precast product uses 218kg of secondary materials and by-products 
and produces only 6kg of waste that goes to landfill (The Concrete Centre, 2010).
Water recycling is a well-established process at precast manufacturing sites, with 85% 
of water being reused at production facilities. Figures 15.2 and 15.3 show a solid-liquid 
Figure 15.2 Recycled water filtration system from cement slurry by Jungdo Company Ltd., Korea.536 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
separation unit using a filter press to produce re-useable mixing water from cement slurry. 
As the filter pressure increases solids form within the chambers forming a cake, which is 
removed allowing the mixing water to be released.
Durability and long design life of precast concrete are assured due to the combination 
of the enhanced tolerances for cover achieved in a quality-controlled factory environment 
and a range of workable concrete mixes of grade C40/50 and above. With typical reinforce￾ment design and details, for XC1 internal environments a 120years design life can be easily 
achieved for precast elements and for XC3 external environments a 60years design life can be 
easily achieved. Precast concrete insulated sandwich panels illustrate how precast can provide 
an extremely durable solution for both the inside and the outside walls of the building.
When used in an XC1 internal environment, precast prestressed hollow core units (hcu) 
can provide a design life of 120years. These units are versatile with excellent load span 
capacities, making them suitable for use in residential, commercial and industrial building 
structures. The hollow core section profile reduces material usage and helps to reduce load￾ing into the supporting superstructure and substructure, this makes the floor a key compo￾nent in creating a sustainable and structurally efficient building. Hcu have a relatively low 
self-weight and can achieve a very high span/depth ratio. Long spans allow flexibility in 
room layouts and a reduction in the supporting structure for such as columns and beams. 
The large open plan space created gives excellent future proofing should the room layouts 
or the use of the building change.
The thermal mass of concrete can play a role in the heating and cooling of a building. 
In simple terms, the concrete absorbs heat during the day to cool the building and releases 
Figure 15.3 Recycled slurry separation unit by Jungdo Company Ltd., Korea.Off-site benefits and temporary works 537
stored heat at night to warm the building. This natural process reduces the need for energy￾consuming heating and cooling systems. The very high standard of aesthetic finish that can 
be produced with precast concrete means it is particularly suited to being exposed to view, 
this exposure maximises the effectiveness of the concrete to contribute thermally and help 
to control the internal temperature of the building.
Precast concrete structures can provide an extremely air-tight construction when ade￾quate sealing is provided at junctions with other elements such as windows and doors. Low 
air permeability test results can help as part of the energy performance assessment to dem￾onstrate compliance with the UK Building Regulations, Part L (The Building Regulations, 
2010a) or the design specification requirements.
Precast elements can have proprietary bee, bird and bat boxes cast into them to provide 
an integrated wildlife habitat.
15.1.5 Fire resistance
Concrete as a material is classified as A1 according to EN 13501-1 (BS EN 13501-1, 2018). 
This means it is completely non-combustible. It does not burn and does contribute to fire. 
Precast concrete elements provide an excellent means of satisfying the fire resistance require￾ments of UK Building Regulations, Part B (The Building Regulations, 2010b). A typical 
fire strategy in a multi-storey building will require a compartmentation of 120 minutes to 
prevent fire spread. A structure built with a hcu floor and precast walls can provide fire resis￾tance REI120 without the need for any testing or additional fireproofing materials. Criteria 
R E and I are all covered by the guidance for design given in BS EN 1992, Part 1-2 (BS EN 
1992-1-2, 2004) and the UK National Annex (NA to BS EN 1992-1-2, 2004). See Chapter 5, 
Section 5.5 for further details.
15.1.6 Acoustic performance
Precast concrete dividing floors and walls provide an effective means of preventing the pas￾sage of airbourne sound to adjacent rooms. External façades constructed of precast clad￾ding or sandwich panels provide effective resistance to the passage of external airbourne 
sound to the internal areas of the building. Robust Details (Robust Details Ltd, 2021), pro￾vide guidance on effective forms of construction using precast concrete elements with other 
building materials and forms of construction to achieve the necessary acoustic performance 
required in the Building Regulations without the need for acoustic testing.
15.1.7 BIM (Building Information Modelling)
Precast concrete elements and structures are very well suited to take advantage of the bene￾fits provided by a collaborative BIM approach in the design process. The precast is modelled 
using the latest 3D software, typically the model is built up from the architectural intent 
for the building using the project architect’s model and drawings. The precast model can 
be combined with other models to check for clashes and as a means of design development 
in a project; typically the 3D models from the architect, the insitu substructure designer, 
the Mechanical Electrical Plumbing (MEP) subcontractor and the steel fabricator are used 
together in an Industry Foundation Class (IFC) model, the IFC contains the combined 3D 
model information from each of the design team members.
Once the model is complete the General Arrangements (GA) and all other drawings are 
generated from it for approval by the client and design team. The precast model is used to 538 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
extract the information required to create the production drawings, ensuring that the geom￾etry and cast-in items, etc. exactly match the source model. Quantities for procurement can 
also be extracted from the model to populate material order sheets. The model can also be 
used as a project management tool to produce the delivery & erection sequence for site and 
subsequently create the production planning programme to meet the required site date for 
each individual piece of precast.
It is possible to cast embedded services such as electrical conduits, lightning protection, 
ducting and plumbing pipework into precast elements such as walls, hcu, columns and 
beams. The details for all cast-in assemblies required by other trades are added to the model 
and scheduled on the production drawings.
Windows and doors are not added to the model but a reference and dimensions for the 
opening will be shown on the elevations so it is clear what window or door is to be fitted. 
The geometrical details required at the cill or threshold, jambs and header are modelled to 
ensure the interface with the window is correct. The details and dimensions required for 
restraints, fixings, EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer is a synthetic rubber used as 
a waterproofing membrane around window and door frames), etc. are typically provided as 
2D information from the window supplier and this sets out the geometry in the 3D precast 
model.
The precast wall panel shown in Figure 15.4 is an extract from the 3D model. All the 
components required to manufacture the panel are included in the model. This panel con￾tains the reinforcement, the M&E backboxes (metal or plastic boxes that house switches, 
etc.) and conduits, the lifting anchors, grout sleeves and couplers for on site connections and 
the temporary works propping sockets. The volume of concrete required to manufacture the 
panel can also be extracted from the model, this will remove the volume from voids created 
by grout sleeves.

15.1.8 Programme duration and site logistics
Precast concrete is often associated with speed of construction and reduced on site time 
and costs. There are always a number of points and options to consider in order to ensure 
that these benefits are realised, in particular when more than one form of construction is 
being used to build the structure. Taking a carpark as an example – the foundations are 
insitu concrete, lifts and stair cores are precast, the frame is steel and the floors are hcu. 
Typically, design workshops are held by the main contractor and sub-contractors to ensure 
all interfaces are reviewed and construction details are suitable to build the structure in 
the sequence and durations in the contract programme. Adequate planning is critical at 
all stages of a project to ensure a successful outcome with respect to programme. Prior to 
starting on site, there needs to be an understanding of every task, each interface, handover 
between sub-contractors, access to craneage, site logistics and any other factors that will 
affect the build programme. The precast build speed gives an advantage but the overall fit 
out and follow on trades also need to be thought through to really make the most of the 
programme savings that are possible.
The choice of the particular type of precast elements used on a scheme will be governed 
by the specific requirements, for example precast and prestressed slabs have a high speed 
of erection and can cover large areas each day. Site durations can be significantly reduced 
compared to all other floor types and forms of construction. Temporary propping is rarely 
required for prestressed slabs so access to the floor and follow-on site operations can pro￾ceed without delay or obstruction. Once the longitudinal joints and ends of the slabs have 
been concreted and cured adequately, typically 72hours is allowed but this can be reduced 
depending on concrete mix used, the floor can be handed over to the main contractor and 
used as a working platform for follow on trades with the use of MEWPS, scissors lifts, etc. 
possible dependent on their self-weight and the slab capacity.
The soffit of hcu is formed on steel beds so provides a high quality, smooth, durable 
surface that is suitable for direct application of a painted finish or it can left untreated and 
exposed to view when used for example as a carpark floor. This reduces the cost and time 
required to apply finishes to the soffit and also has the benefit of maximising the use of the 
concretes thermal mass potential.
Brownfield sites, in particular city and town centre sites with little space for materials, 
are very well suited to precast construction, and in some cases, it is easily the most viable 
option. The precast is brought to site on timed deliveries and lifted from the lorry directly 
into its final position on site, minimising the need for storing material on site.
On sites where the building line is at or very close to the site boundary, the use of precast 
construction can completely remove the need for external scaffolding.
Integration with other trades and pre-fabrication systems helps to maximise the reduction 
in overall site duration. For example, bathroom pods and flat pack kitchen systems can be 
programmed for delivery to site and craned into position as each level of precast structure is 
erected to help reduce the overall build programme.
Precast is compatible with other forms of construction and can be readily integrated with 
steel frames, insitu concrete structures, masonry and timber frame buildings. Stair cores 
and lift shafts are regularly used with the aforementioned types of construction to provide 
a rapid build solution that can be used as part or all of the stability system for the build￾ing. The precast cores will also provide immediate access and egress to the building during 
the construction phase. Quite often precast provides an economic and effective means of 
satisfying the requirement for firefighting cores or lift shafts when used in conjunction with 
lightweight forms of construction.540 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
15.2 ERECTION OF PRECAST ELEMENTS AND STRUCTURES
15.2.1 Temporary works
Most people think of temporary works as the propping that is often seen on building sites 
where concrete structures are being erected. In fact, this on site propping is generally the 
final stage in the temporary works design process for precast elements and structures.
Temporary work design must be considered carefully for all stages of the process: prop￾ping and bracing of mouldage, lifting anchors for demoulding, lifting and spreader beams, 
lifting anchors for handling/turning in the yard, stillages for storage of the precast in the 
yard, toast racks and A-frames for transportation of the precast to site on lorries, lifting 
anchors for site erection, temporary edge protection, abseiling anchor points, on site prop￾ping during erection and any other requirements for the project that are of a temporary 
nature.
The following sections will discuss the design of lifting anchors and the design and con￾trol of onsite propping. These two forms of temporary works are high risk and must be 
adequately assessed. The design and the design-checking processes must be documented and 
carried out by suitably qualified and experienced people. A failure of a lifting anchor or an 
onsite prop could result in serious injury or a fatality.
15.2.2 Lifting anchors
There is a wide range of proprietary lifting anchors for precast concrete available on the 
market. The variety of lifter types can be bewildering but the principles of their design and 
use can be put into two basic categories
1. Lifting anchors in unreinforced concrete
2. Lifting anchors in concrete with specific reinforcement details for the stressed applied 
during lifting operations
It is critically important that engineers who are specifying lifting anchors understand the 
principles of how the anchor works and the limitations and suitability of each type of anchor 
for the specific lifting operation. The manufacturers and suppliers of proprietary lifting 
anchors provide technical data for the safe use of their products but be aware that the use 
of this information requires the engineer responsible for the temporary works design to be 
fully aware of all the details surrounding the lifting operation.
15.2.3 Load applied to each anchor
The way in which a unit is lifted will influence the load that is applied to the lifting anchors, 
each lifting load case must be considered for the precast element to ensure all lifting opera￾tions are safe to perform.
Some lifting arrangements are statically indeterminate, and in these situations, it must 
be assumed that the lifters are not equally loaded. Figure 15.5 shows a slab being lifted 
with 4 no. lifting anchors cast into it. These anchors need to be designed to consider that 
only 2 no. anchors are supporting the load; this is common practice on stair flights and 
landings unless a compensating chain rig is used. Lifting beams with pulleys and compen￾sating chain rigs are two common methods of providing a statically determinate lifting 
system.Off-site benefits and temporary works 541
15.2.4 Chain angle
The angle of the chains is governed by the length of the chain to the crane hook and the 
position of the lifting anchors on the precast element. The appointed person writes the lift 
plan and determines the length of the chains required to satisfy the chain angle used in the 
design of the lifting anchors. It is important for the designer of the anchors to communicate 
the requirements for the chain angle; the lift plan will be based on this value, and it is good 
practice for the angle to be noted on the GA drawings used for site erection. Figure 15.6 
gives coefficients to be used with the calculated chain angles. The chain angle affects the 
tension force applied to the lifting equipment; as the angle increases away from vertical, the 
tension force increases proportionally.
15.2.5 Dynamic factors
When lifting precast elements, a dynamic action is applied to the lifting anchors based on 
the type of crane or machine used. The magnitude of this effect is determined by the length 
and type of cable or chain used and the hoisting speed. Typical values are provided in 
Table 15.1. If there are any doubts regarding the factor to be used, the supplier of the lifting 
anchors should be contacted for further guidance.

rig. (Courtesy of Construction Fixing Systems, UK.)

15.2.6 Adhesion to formwork
Additional forces can be applied to the lifting anchors when demoulding due to adhesion 
to the formwork. The type of formwork used and the release oil will affect the value of the 
force that needs to be considered. Typical values are provided in Table 15.2 for flat surfaces, 
profiled surfaces can have greater adhesion forces and the demoulding process may need to 
take this into account. Occasionally, additional lifters specifically for breaking the adhesion 
to the formwork are cast into the element.
15.2.7 Lifting methodology
The simplest way to lift precast elements is by using two equally loaded lifting anchors, 
the placement of the lifters symmetrically about the centre of gravity (CofG) ensures equal 
loading. All 3D software packages can provide the position of the CofG for any type and 
shape of precast element. Note that 2D software, spreadsheets or hand calcs can provide 
the CofG for wall panels like the example in Figure 15.7. If it is not possible to position the 
lifting anchors such that the load is distributed equally between them, the alternative is to 
calculate the worst case loading on the anchors and select the lifter type and capacity based 
on this value. The same lifting anchor is used throughout the precast element. Different 
anchor capacities are to be avoided in the same element as this creates the risk of the wrong 
anchor being placed during manufacture at the location with the worst case loading.
It is not always possible to use only two lifting anchors; when it is necessary to lift with 
three or more anchors the lifting equipment needs to be arranged to ensure the loading 
applied to each anchor is within its capacity. The use of compensating chain rigs, pulleys, 
lifting beams and block and tackle equipment are some of the methods to control the load￾ing onto each lifting anchor. This is quite a complicated topic and outside the scope of this 
book, but the main point is that designers need to have an awareness regarding the practi￾calities of using multiple lifting anchors and seek out guidance from experienced personnel 
when this situation arises.
Once all of the relevant points have been considered the selection of the lifter is actually 
quite simple, but it is essential that the lifting of the precast element is considered carefully 
at each stage, i.e. demoulding, handling in the yard, transportation, and erection on site.

These different stages may all use the same lifting anchors but any one of them could apply 
the maximum stress to the lifters, the concrete or the reinforcement.
The wall panel shown in Figure 15.7 and all precast elements require a number of points 
to be considered when designing the lifting anchors and the elements reinforcement. An 
example of a checklist is given below.
1. How is the precast element manufactured and demoulded?
2. What is the concrete strength at demoulding?
3. What is the adhesion coefficient at demoulding?
4. If the element is pitched from horizontal to vertical what reinforcement quantity is 
required for pitching, this may occur at low concrete strengths
5. Does the element need to be turned or rotated in the factory as part of the finishing 
process?
6. How will the element be transported to site?
7. How will the element be erected on site?
8. What is the chain angle coefficient at each stage?
9. What is the dynamic factor for the craneage being used at each stage?
Specific points relating to the wall panel shown in Figure 15.7 are
10. The CofG needs to be accurately determined due to the irregular geometry and the 
door opening in the panel
11. There are a considerable number of M&E backboxes on the right-hand side that will 
limit where lifting anchor can be positioned
12. The door header has two penetrations through it to allow for the routing of M&E 
ducting, the reinforcement design and details in the header will need to account for 
these holes and deal with the handling stresses during lifting.
15.2.8 Lifting anchor design
The wall panel shown in Figure 15.7 is manufactured on a tilting table with oiled steel form￾work. The demoulding cube strength is 15 N/mm2, mould adhesion is 1 kN/m2, the panel 
is not pitched and does not require turning in the yard, panel is sent to site upright on an

A-frame, panel is erected on site directly from the A-frame. Chain angle α in the factory is 
maximum 90°, dynamic factor in the factory is 1.1. Chain angle α on site is maximum 60°, 
dynamic factor on site is 1.3.

The first operation is to break the adhesion to the mould surface, this can be carried out 
while the panel is in the as cast horizontal position on the mould prior to tilting or once 
the mould has been tilted and the panel is almost vertical. In this example, the panel is 
manufactured on a tilting table, and therefore the majority of the self-weight will be sup￾ported on the mould – a simple conservative approach is to use 25% of the self-weight in 
the calculation. In the worst-case situation when the panel is horizontal the self-weight 
load applied to the lifters must be calculated, for example in some cases the panel may 
have deep headers over door openings that will lead to a greater percentage of load on the 
lifting anchors.

15.2.9 Design and control of onsite temporary works
When designing temporary works, Health & Safety is always the first and most important 
consideration. The control over temporary works on site is an integral part of the design 
process, and thought needs to be given to how best to communicate with the site team to 
mitigate any residual risk. For precast temporary works, using wall panels as an example, 
the use of props and other restraint fixings occurs as each wall is installed by the crane. 
The type of prop, the number of props, their position and connections are all given on the 
temporary works drawings.
The people involved in each stage of the temporary work process must be qualified and 
have adequate experience to perform the role assigned to them. It is the responsibility of the 
Designated Individual within the company to appoint the following personnel in writing.
a. Temporary Works Designer (TWD) – e.g. Company engineer
b. Temporary Works Design Checker (TWDC) – e.g. Company engineer or independent 
engineer
c. Temporary Works Co-ordinator (TWC) – e.g. Project Manager
d. Temporary Works Supervisor (TWS) – e.g. Site Manager
The following is a general example of a procedure for control of temporary works.
15.2.10 Temporary works procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure design, installation, maintenance and disman￾tling of temporary site propping is carried out in a safe and controlled manner. Primarily, 
this is achieved by moving from site-based control to a permit to release system controlled 
by the TWD. Figure 15.10 shows a typical permit to unload, with the required information 
provided on it to safely control the removal of propping. This ensures that site pressures 
do not affect the control of temporary works and props are released using a safe and engi￾neered process.
Only the TWD may specify and authorise the removal of propping.
The structure is to be erected in accordance with delivery and erection sequence.
It is the responsibility of Site Manager/TWS to implement the use of prop permits and 
follow the delivery and erection sequence.
All temporary works designated individuals are appointed by the designated individual.
Selection is based on criteria as required in BS 5975 (BS 5975, 2019).
It is a requirement that all individuals must have attended and passed, Safety in the

15.2.10.5 Unplanned propping requirements
As is the case with even the most well-designed construction activities circumstances can 
arise when temporary propping may be required that has not formed part of the pre-proj￾ect design and planning. In this situation, all the conditions noted in the above procedure 
apply.
Propping must be specified by TWD and not from site. It is the responsibility of the TWS 
to get the relevant information to the TWD for an engineering solution and then to input 
requirements on site.
Any elements that cannot be installed must be placed back on the ground until a prop￾ping drawing or sketch is received from the TWD. Elements must not be left in position on 
temporary props or suspended from the crane while awaiting the engineer’s solution.550 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
15.2.11 Temporary works design in accordance with BS 5975
Design of propping for precast elements is carried out using the guidance given in BS 5975. 
Loading onto props and their connections comes from a number of sources. These are 
typically wind pressure, an allowance for verticality deviation and the placement of other 
elements onto the propped element. The latter two cases are covered by guidance in Clauses 
19.2.4 and 17.4.3.4 of BS 5975, respectively.
A load case for the working condition is given in Clause 17.5.1.9. It is unrealistic for the 
loads from Clause 17.4.3.4 to be applied at the same time as the peak wind loading, which 
is based on the maximum for the return period. A minimum working wind load of 0.2 kN/
m2 is recommended for use when for example installing precast slabs onto propped precast 
walls.
The following is an example of a design statement and calculation for simple push-pull 
propping. The statement prior to the calculation provides information on the design check 
category and key points for the site team to incorporate into the Method Statement.

used on stair core wall panels

Category 1.
Independence of checker – in house by company engineer.
2. Design Engineer Site Visit Requirements.
No specific requirements.
3. Erection Hold Points.
At each level, all vertical and horizontal joints between walls must be grouted before 
the next level of walls is erected.
Landing slabs and walls cannot support props until the grouted connections 
have reached a minimum cube strength of 20 N/mm2, typically at 1 day for ‘Parex 
GP’ grout or similar approved and 2 hours for ‘Parex Speedsure S’ grout or similar 
approved.
No props or temporary supports may be released without written permission from 
TWD in accordance with the temporary works procedure.
4. Checking of props to ensure they are tight.
No checks are required once vertical wall joints are grouted and horizontal slab 
joints are concreted. A daily check is required until grouting and concrete works are 
completed at each level.

Care must be taken to ensure props are positioned on the wall panel so they are equally 
loaded. To ensure equal loading the spacing of the props should be checked based on the 
tributary area they support. This principle may also be applied when using more than two 
props. If it is not possible to avoid one of the props supporting a greater load than the 
others, this worst case is used in the design and all props and connections are sized for 
this load.
15.2.13.2 Prop connection to slab
Figure 15.11 shows the wall and prop geometry showing the connection position of the 
prop head on the wall and the prop base on the floor slab. These two critical dimensions are 
provided on the temporary works drawings so the site team install the props at the correct 
angle. Continuing the example above:
Horizontal distance from wall; ah =2000mm;
Height to prop position on panel; b=2530mm;
Angle of prop to horizontal; αp =tan−1(b / ah)=52°;
Prop angle<60° OK

Referring to Figure  15.12, Number 3 push-pull prop compression capacity at 3225mm 
extension is at least 20 kN. Note that Figure 15.12 shows a typical push-pull capacity graph, 
although each prop manufacturer provides capacity data for their products.552 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Note that this example prop and connection design does not take into account the addi￾tional moment from the self-weight of the panel due to verticality deviation according to 
BS5975, Clause 19.2.4.
When designing the temporary works for precast sandwich panels, it is very important to 
consider the additional moment applied to the structural leaf due to the eccentricity of the 
suspended outer façade leaf. This can be a significant additional moment due to the project￾ing geometry of some architectural facades.

Consider a M16 solid rod socket – tension and shear capacity safe working loads for the 
cast-in fixings are based on a 120mm edge distance, minimum grade of concrete is C35/45. 
A reinforcement U-bar is present around the socket.

A similar check is carried out for the connection at the base of the prop. This may be a dif￾ferent type of cast-in or post-fixed detail dependent on the type of floor or member that is 
supporting the prop base.
A typical fully precast apartment structure is shown in Figure  15.14 where push-pull 
props supporting the crosswalls and sandwich panels can be seen prior to the installation of 
the next level of hcu. Bathroom pods have been lifted into place and positioned at approxi￾mately their final location. The propping drawings will include the bathroom pods drawn in 
their location so that the props can be positioned and designed to avoid clashes. Figure 15.14 
illustrates one of the major benefits of precast concrete construction – minimal and very 
simple propping is required to erect a precast structure.
15.2.14 Build sequence and temporary works
The design of temporary works to ensure an efficient build methodology on site is essen￾tial to maximise programme savings. The following example demonstrates a way to con￾struct the lift shafts and stair core area of an apartment scheme in a safe and practical 
manner.
The lift shaft in this project is manufactured as separate walls that are bolted together in 
the precast yard and the propping is installed prior to dispatch to site. The F-shape formed 
is stable when erected without the need for any additional site fixed props or other tem￾porary works. The props shown are used to brace the walls during lifting to prevent any 
movement that would cause a fitting or alignment issue with the F-shape assemblies above 
and/or below. Figure 15.15 shows the F shape assembly as it looks in the BIM model. The 
brackets visible on the headers of the door walls are provided to support the temporary steel 
Figure 15.14 Precast apartment structure during construction.Off-site benefits and temporary works 555
mesh floor that is placed within lift shafts to allow finishing works to be carried out on the 
internal vertical and horizontal joints between the precast elements.
The bars cast into the walls that cross the door opening can serve two functions – edge 
protection barriers for the lift shaft doors are fixed to these bars and, if required as part 
of the design, the bars will brace the vertical pier sections on each side of the door during 
demoulding and handling.
The erection sequence allows for 18 no. pieces to be fitted without the need to prop off any 
hcu. All propping and restraint plates are designed and detailed to be either wall to wall or 
wall to solid precast slabs. This ensures the crane is kept working and installation does not 
have to stop to allow insitu concrete works associated with the hcu to cure.
Using ‘Speedsure’ grout, or a similar approved rapid curing grout, in the connections 
between wall-to-wall and wall-to-landing slabs it is possible to build this area in 2days.
The temporary platforms can be seen as grills at the top of the lift shafts in Figure 15.17. 
Similar temporary platforms (not shown on this snapshot) were used to cover each of the 
large openings visible in the floors. The hcu are not shown in Figure 15.16, they are hidden 
from view, when installed they form the floor in front of the lifts and in the small room at 
the top right corner.
Referring to Figure 15.17, the erection sequence for the walls is as follows
1. F-shape lift shaft wall assembly, walls C3, C7 and C8
2. Wall C4 – 1 no. restraint plate to wall C7, 1 no. restraint plate to wall C8 1 no. prop 
wall to slab L1
3. Wall C5 – 1 no. restraint plate to wall C4, 1 no. prop wall to slab L1

to wall C5
5. Wall C6 – 1 no. prop wall to slab RC1, 1 no. prop wall to wall C3
6. Wall C1 – 1 no. restraint plate to wall C3, 1 no. restraint plate to wall C4
7. Sandwich panel N3 – 1 no. restraint plate to wall C2, 1 no. restraint plate to wall C5, 
1 no. prop wall to slab L1
8. Sandwich panel N2 – 1 no. restraint plate to panel N3, 1 no. restraint plate to wall C1, 
1 no. prop wall to wall C1
9. Install next level of slab L1
10. Install next level of slab RC1
11. Install next level of slab RC2
12. Install stair flight SF1
13. Install stair flight SF2
14. Install corridor beam CB1
The 4 no. hcu can now be installed in front of the lift shafts and the small room in the top 
right corner of the snapshot to complete this section of the building. Figure 15.17 shows the 
plan view of the area with element references used for the erection sequence and the location 
of the prop and restraint plates.
The restraint plates used for temporary support are typically manufactured from 10 to 
12mm thick steel plate and the top of the walls are recessed where they are located. These 
recesses prevent the plates and the head of the bolts used to fix them from clashing with the 
next level of walls and slabs when they are erected.

15.3 HOLLOW CORE UNITS (HCU) INSTALLATION
The fitting of hcu can be carried out using lorry-mounted off-loaders like the one shown 
in Figure 1.20. This is a suitable and cost-effective method for slabs at ground and first 
floors on sites that allow close access to the building. The slab in the photo is a ribbed slab 
but hcu is fitted in the same manner. Figure 1.20 also shows a clamp being used to lift the 
slabs, clamps are usually restricted to low-level fitting such as the building in the photo. The 
most common method of fitting hcu is by tower crane or mobile crane. Figure 15.18 shows 
hcu being installed onto a steel frame. The slabs are being fitted using lifting anchors cast 
in during production, see Figure 4.19. The slab also has safety chains wrapped around it at 
each end to act as a secondary means of supporting the slab in the unlikely event of an issue 
with the lifting pins. The slab is landed onto its bearing as shown in Figure 15.19, the safety 
chains are removed and the slab is moved into its final position butted up to the adjacent 
slab. Slings and chains can be wrapped around the hcu to lift them but neither of these are 
preferred methods, the chain causes damage to the sides and soffit of the slabs and both 
methods require the slab to be moved into its final position using a crowbar to manually 
slide it on its bearing into its final position bitted up to the adjacent slab. Another method is 
the use of lifting hooks placed into the ends of the hollow cores, this is no longer a common 
method in the UK and Ireland and it is rarely if ever used on sites now.
The installation works shown in Figure 15.18 uses netting fixed to the underside of the 
steel frame to prevent falls from height, Figure 15.19 shows installers wearing harnesses 
and connected to fall arrest lanyards to prevent falls from height. The edge protection is 
provided by a proprietary barrier system and scaffolding.
When installing long span hcu, the sequence of installation and/or temporary works 
may need to be considered due to the torsion applied to supporting beams and their 
Figure 15.18 Mobile crane fitting hcu onto steel frame.Off-site benefits and temporary works 559
connections. For edge beams, temporary propping can be installed to prevent excessive 
torsion forces causing a problem, the props are released once the hcu have their ends con￾creted and are connected to the beams. For internal beams the sequence of the installation 
may be arranged to load each side of the supporting beams one hcu at a time to prevent 
excessive torsion, this is not always practical on site so it is more common to provide 
temporary bracing or propping to internal beams so that each bay of hcu can be fully 
installed.
Where a structural topping is being poured to create a composite hcu, temporary prop￾ping of the hcu is sometimes required to maximise the load-carrying capacity of the avail￾able structural slab depth. Typically this will be a single line of props at midspan. It is 
common practice to concrete the longitudinal joints and slab ends of the hcu prior to casting 
the structural topping.
Figure 15.20 shows a hcu layout drawing for an apartment block. The main supporting 
structure is constructed from precast crosswalls, with steel beams supporting Slab Marks 5, 
6, 13, 14 and 15. The production detail drawing for Slab Mark 1 is shown in Figure 15.21, 
the details for open cores, solid ends, holes, notches, lifting pins and strand patterns are all 
given on these drawings. The drawings are used by the production team to create the specific 
details required for each hcu. The notches in the ends of the hcu allow vertical tie bar rein￾forcement to be installed on site. Figure 15.22 shows the bearing details in Section 4-4 and 
6-6 on the hcu layout drawing, the correct bearing length at installation is very important 
to ensure the hcu are safely supported in the temporary state. If the noted bearing cannot be 
achieved the amount of bearing that can be achieved is measured and the slab is returned to 
ground level, the engineer responsible for the design is consulted to determine if the amount 
of bearing that can be achieved is satisfactory. If the bearing is not adequate, temporary

Figure 15.20 Plan drawing of hcu layout for an apartment building.Off-site benefits and temporary works 561
works can be designed to support the hcu and the permanent works design is checked to 
ensure that once the insitu concrete inf﻿ill to longitudinal joints and the ties at the slab ends 
are in place the bearing is adequate.
The maximum number of planned lifts per day for hcu is usually 40. This would gener￾ally be the target for slabs of 150–250mm deep with spans of approximately 6–10m. For 
example, 40 no. 150mm deep, 1.2m wide slabs at 6.5m long would cover 312m2 per day; 
40 no. 250mm deep, 1.2m wide slabs at 10m long would cover 480m2. These values will

Figure 15.21 Production detail drawing for hcu, slab mark 1 on Figure 15.22.562 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
vary depending on the site and obviously longer slabs will cover larger areas with the same 
number of lifts. However, the logistics of deliveries via lorries to site also has to be factored 
in, for example a 450mm deep, 1.2m wide slab at 13.5m long weighs approximately 8.6 
tonnes, this means there will only be 3 slabs on a standard load, for 150mm deep slabs 
at 6.5m, 13 slabs could be delivered on a standard load. The number of loads that can be 
delivered to site will vary depending on location, access and other logistic factors but the 
average would be seven loads per day. The height of the building has an effect on installation 
but as the lifting speeds for hcu on tower cranes can comfortably be 45 m/min or more the 
additional time for fitting onto medium rise buildings is not that significant, the fitting of 
hcu down through fully erected steel frames tends to be a much slower process than lifting 
up onto tall structures.

Case studies
16.1 INTRODUCTION TO CASE STUDIES
The market for precast concrete structures has been expanding, developing and changing 
over the last 30years in the UK and Ireland. Precast concrete has an increasing share of the 
market in virtually every type of building being constructed. Precast elements are widely 
used in various functions for structures that are built for a huge range of uses: residential, 
office, retail, hospitals, schools, car parks, stadia, agricultural and industrial to name a 
few. These buildings can also consist of various forms of construction such as steel frame, 
masonry, timber frame and insitu frame, but they all have an area or part of the structure 
that benefits from the inclusion of precast concrete. The use of precast can be a benefit to 
Health & Safety, sustainability, programme, cost and many other possible advantages.
The size of the market for fully precast structures has grown steadily in the last 10–15years 
so that a noticeable trend has started to develop within the construction industry. More 
multi-storey buildings in the residential, hotel and student accommodation sectors are being 
planned and delivered as fully precast structures each year. The use of precast in the custo￾dial sector has been commonplace for many years. The possibly unsurpassed suitability of 
precast design, manufacture and erection methods to the repetitive modular form of prisons 
makes for a very natural fit.
A range of structural types can be built using precast concrete. The most common types 
are beam and column frames such as offices and car parks, crosswall frames such as apart￾ments, boxes such as lift shafts, and wall frames such as stair cores. Sandwich panels and 
cladding are also commonly used with steel and insitu frames as well as precast frames. 
Tables 1.1–1.3 in Chapter 1 give data related to the type of precast structures recently 
erected in the UK and Ireland. The case studies will expand on this data.
16.2 PRECAST CAR PARK STRUCTURES
16.2.1 Benefits of precast car park construction
Precast prestressed concrete is particularly well suited for car park construction, with ben￾efits such as a long design life of 50years or greater, and inherent fire resistance with periods 
up to 2hours being achievable with standard product details. Architectural concrete can 
fulfill a structural role as well as provide a durable and aesthetic external façade. Long-span 
prestressed hcu give clear open areas ideal for car park layouts and traffic circulation. The 
snapshot from the 3D model in Figure 16.1 shows the columns, beams and stability cores 
with precast prestressed hollow core units (hcu) hidden from view. This illustrates the large 
open plan arrangement possible when using precast and prestressed concrete.

16.2.2 Design statement
The following design statement describes the typical details for the precast concrete-framed 
car park shown in Figure 16.1. The particular feature of this building is the curved span￾drel beams at one of the corners. The erection programme for the precast structure was 
18weeks, equating to approximately 1230 sq.m per week using a team of 8 specialist fixers 
and 14 labourers, working with 2 cranes.
The design statement
• General – the structure consists of six storeys. The building footprint comprises eleven 
bays of 7.2m length and three perpendicular bays of 15.7m each. The building foot￾print is approximately 79.2 m×47.1m, there is a slight reduction in net area due to one 
corner having a curved perimeter. There is a single access ramp positioned close to the 
centre of the building, a movement joint alongside the ramp subdivides the car park 
into two independent structures. There are two stair cores in the building, one at each 
end of the independent structures. The total number of car parking spaces is 1120.
• Columns – these are manufactured as three-storey precast concrete elements with cor￾bels on all faces for internal columns and corbels on three faces of perimeter columns. 
Columns are designed to be braced and tied to the floor slabs at each level. Ground￾level columns were cast with a steel base plate; the holding down bolt connection and 
the base plate were designed to remove the need for any propping on site. Figure 16.2 
shows the three-storey columns with two of the internal beams erected.
Figure 16.1 3 model extract of precast car park frame structure at Blackpool Hospital, UK.Case studies 565
• Walls – manufactured as single-storey precast elements and designed as reinforced 
concrete shear walls within the braced structure. Precast walls form the two stair 
cores, lift shafts and ramp structure.
• Main deck beams – typically inverted T-beams that span simply supported between 
columns. They are designed as a wholly precast reinforced section to minimise the 
need for temporary propping during construction.
• Spandrel beams (loadbearing) – manufactured with a continuous projecting nib to 
support the floor slabs and designed as simply supported spanning between columns 
or walls. To avoid the development of torsional stresses in the beams, the ends of the 
hcu slabs are anchored to the spandrels via couplers concreted into the ends of open 
cores in the slabs. The spandrels have to be temporarily propped prior to installing 
the hcu and the props remain in place until the slab end anchorage is completed and 
adequately cured. The top section of the spandrel also acts as a vehicle impact barrier 
around the car park perimeter.
• Spandrel beams (non-loadbearing) – these span parallel to the hcu units, simply sup￾ported spanning between columns or walls. They do not require temporary propping 
as there are minimal torsional effects. They are tied to the structural topping using 
projecting reinforcement break out bars. The top section of the spandrel also acts as a 
vehicle impact barrier around the car park perimeter. The non-loadbearing spandrels 
are up to 15.7m long. Figure 16.3 shows the installation of a white concrete spandrel 
beam, designed to be lifted with slings using a spreader beam.
• Deck slabs – typically 400mm precast prestressed concrete hcu spanning between 
main deck beams and/or perimeter spandrel beams. The units are tied to both beams 
at their ends. The hcu are designed to act as composite slabs with a 100mm structural 
topping. Maximum clear span is 15.17m.

• Stairs & landings – flights span simply supported between landings and are tied at 
their ends to the landings. The landings span perpendicular to the flights and are sup￾ported by rolled steel angles (RSA) bolted to the precast walls. Landings are tied to the 
supporting walls.
• Lateral stability – the structure is designed to withstand the wind forces and equiva￾lent horizontal forces due to geometric imperfections given in BS EN 1992, Part 1, 
clause 5.2 (BS EN 1992-1-1, 2004). All lateral loads are resisted by vertical cantilever 
shear walls forming the stair cores, the lift shafts and the access ramp structure. The 
horizontal forces are transferred to the shear walls via the diaphragm action of the car 
park deck slabs. The car park is designed for stability as two separate structures on 
each side of the movement joint. Consideration is given to stability for both temporary 
and permanent conditions.
• Robustness – disproportionate collapse is mitigated by the use of horizontal and verti￾cal ties. Where a tied solution is not practical or possible the precast units are designed 
as key elements as defined in BS EN 1991, Part 1-7 (BS EN 1991-1-7, 2006).
16.2.3 Design of curved spandrel
The design of the curved spandrel beam and its connections to the hcu was one of the 
specific engineering challenges on this project. The beam had an outside radius of 11.5m 
and spanned 12m between supports. The torsion applied at the connections between the 
spandrel ends and its supports created a structural problem that could not be resolved by 
the typical methods of connecting precast elements. The solution adopted to resolve this 
Figure 16.3 Lifting of a 15.7m long white concrete spandrel beam for the car park shown in Figure 16.1.Case studies 567
problem was the back propping of all spandrels to ground level. The car park structure 
was built to full height, with the spandrel and floor slabs bearing onto props as shown in 
Figure 16.4.
To remove the excessive torsion from the spandrel, it was necessary to make a rigid con￾nection into the hcu and the structural topping. Reinforcement bars were anchored into the 
hollow cores close to the bottom of the spandrel and into the structural topping to form a 
moment connection between the spandrels and the composite slabs. Figure 16.5 shows the 
connection details between beam and slab.
The back propping solution was chosen as follows:
1. It resolved the problem created due to torsion
2. It was simple and quick to erect on site
3. It allowed the erection of the precast to proceed without delay
4. It satisfied the practicalities of pouring the structural topping
Note for point 4, the preference is to pour structural toppings from the top level down in car 
park construction for the practical reason that this prevents any concrete spillages or grout 
leakage from ruining a finished surface below it. Figure 16.5 shows the curved spandrels 
under construction viewed from outside the building with temporary propping in place. 
Figure 16.6 is a view from inside the building, the insitu toppings have been poured, the 
curved spandrels are fully connected to the floor slab at each level, the back propping has 
been removed (note the remaining props that can be seen are non-structural and are there 
to support temporary edge protection).

16.3 DESIGN OF PRECAST STRUCTURES USING FEM SOFTWARE
The use of finite element method (FEM) software to analyse a precast structure’s behaviour 
can produce a very efficient and economic design. The stiffness of all of the elements can 
be utilized and lateral loading can be distributed to minimize concentration of compressive 
axial loads and tension or uplift forces. Hand calculation or simple analysis methods can 
sometimes be overly conservative, which can result in problematic concentrated loads and 
in particular excessive tension or uplift in stability walls. The high compressive forces can 
cause a requirement for increased wall thicknesses and high tension forces require impracti￾cal numbers of starter bars.
There are numerous FEM software packages available on the market. Users can model 
virtually any type of element or structure with different material properties and shapes. 
This software is a very powerful tool for engineers, but it needs to be used carefully. The 
output from an analysis model can be altered significantly by how it has been set up or built, 
for example: a change in support definition, assigning different boundary conditions to the 
members at a multiple joint interface, modifying the stiffness of a wall with a large open￾ing and numerous other inputs can all be edited by the user. This amount of freedom needs 
to be controlled by experience, a thorough understanding of expected results and a results 
verification process. The following is a brief overview of a number of the key points when 
using FEM software to design precast structures.
16.3.1 FEM model set up
Support conditions for the precast structure must be properly defined. For example, if a 
precast structure is modelled as being supported on a rigid support instead of a flexible sup￾port, the load distribution will change. This is important when working with insitu concrete 
transfer structures and in particular with cantilever transfer structures. In such cases, the 
degree of flexibility of the insitu structure needs to be determined and provided by the insitu
concrete designer; alternatively, the insitu structure can be modelled by the precast designer 
within their modelling software. The importance of this design co-ordination should not 
be underestimated as it adds accuracy to how the insitu transfer structure will deflect and 
redistribute the forces in the analysis model in a more realistic way. Figure 16.7 shows the 
analysis model for a precast structure erected on top of an insitu cantilever transfer structure. 
The supports can be seen at the base of the model; in this example, the insitu structure was 
not modelled with the same software as the precast model. The stiffness of the supports was 
provided by the insitu designer from their model, and these were used in the precast model.
Modelling of a precast structure can be subdivided into two general types – the first is 
framed structures with columns and beams and the second is shear wall type structures. 
Framed structures are typically modelled with member elements while shear wall type struc￾tures would be modelled using panel members, different software packages may use differ￾ent terminology.
Floors are usually modelled as a rigid or semi-rigid diaphragm. The design of the dia￾phragm is generally undertaken separately and justified using hand calculations or simple 
methods of analysis. The internal forces transferred through the floor diaphragm into col￾umns, beams and walls are extracted from the model. The interface between each element 
is checked to ensure the design shear does not exceed the shear capacity at any of the con￾nections. It is important to note that hcu are typically modelled as a one way spanning slab, 
and it is critical to properly define the correct span and any release or boundary conditions.570 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
Horizontal wall-to-wall joints are almost always modelled as pinned about the minor 
axis. Precast walls are typically of a width that permits only a single central row of connec￾tions across the horizontal joint thus limiting the fixity that can be achieved. Columns are 
typically modelled as pinned at the column-to-column connections. Multi-storey columns 
are pinned where they connect to foundation and/or other columns.
Vertical wall-to-wall joints can be modelled as rigid if the walls are interconnected and 
there is sufficient vertical shear capacity in the joint. In cases where the joint does not have 
sufficient vertical shear capacity it needs to be modelled as released. The design of the joints 
between walls and other elements is critical, the behaviour of the structure will be affected 
by these details, and there is the potential to change the load distribution and subsequently 
the internal forces in the structural members.
Figure 16.8 shows the results from a precast shear wall stability system modelled with 
three of the walls interconnected as a C-shape and Figure 16.9 shows the same layout with 
all of the walls released vertically. The load distribution changes considerably based on the 
releases used, the peak reactions are reduced by approx 20% by modelling the three walls 
as a connected C-shape. This will affect the axial load on the walls and the connections to 
the foundation and/or transfer structure.
16.3.2 Horizontal joints
The axial compression forces from the model are used to check the capacity and design the 
horizontal joint interfaces between insitu, precast, steel, etc. The axial load outputs are 
used to check the capacity of the element and design the reinforcement content for the wall 
Figure 16.7 Analysis model for precast structure.Case studies 571
or column in question. Any tension force or uplift is typically dealt with by connecting the 
walls to the foundations using starter bars in grout sleeves or proprietary wall shoes. These 
connections can also provide the necessary vertical ties for robustness.
16.3.3 Vertical joints
These are the most critical joints when using FEM software to analyse precast structures, 
the performance of the vertical joint has the greatest influence on the load distribution and 
therefore requires considerable focus and care when modelling.
Once the forces in the vertical joints have been extracted from the analysis model, each 
joint is checked to ensure the connections can be designed to withstand the applied forces. 
Proprietary connection systems such as loop boxes are available from a number of suppliers. 
The manufacturers of these systems provide technical data stating the capacity available for 
specific geometry details, concrete strengths and other relevant conditions. If proprietary 
systems do not provide the capacity required, enhancement of the shear capacity at the 
vertical interfaces between walls is possible with a bolted connection. If a situation arises 
where the forces extracted from the analysis model exceed the capacity at some of the joint 
connections, an alternative panelisation of the walls needs to be modelled so the vertical 
joints that are a problem are moved to a position where the forces are reduced. Alternatively, 
if it is practical, multiple elements can be cast as one single element; common examples of 
this are lift cores cast as box shapes and also walls cast as L and T-shapes. A further option 
exists, although not preferred due to the additional site works and aesthetic implications; 
the precast walls are designed to have a section of insitu concrete cast between them. The 
walls are manufactured with the required projecting reinforcement or cast in couplers and 
the infill section between them is shuttered and concreted on site to provide a monolithic 
connection between walls.
Figure 16.9 Released wall structure.
Figure 16.8 Connected wall structure.572 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures
The methods above will alter the distribution of the loads and can provide a solution 
when vertical shear capacity in joints is causing a problem or a limitation in the design of a 
precast structure.
Figure 16.10 shows an extract from the analysis model of a precast apartment building. 
The elements selected are part of the stability system for the structure, and the displayed 
forces are the shear forces at the vertical interface between two wall panels. The building 
is 32 storeys in height and there are large shear forces developed in the joint that require 
high capacity connections at the lower levels. Moving up the building the forces reduce 
to the point where their magnitude allows the use of proprietary loop box connections. 
Figure 16.11 shows the design principle used for loop boxes.
Table 16.1 gives typical capacities for loop box connections, using size 140 loop boxes at 
250mm vertical spacing with grade C40/50 wall/grout strength would give a vertical shear 
capacity of 44.2 kN×(1000/250mm)=176.8 kN/m. Any vertical joints that have VEd in 
excess of the loop box capacity will need to be connected using bolted connections or one of 
the other methods described above.
An example of a bolted connection detail is shown in Figure 16.12. This method uses a 
coupler, grout sleeve, threaded rod, plate washer and nut. The vertical joint, grout sleeve and 
recess pocket are filled with a high strength, non-shrink, pourable grout.
16.3.4 Multiple layer elements
When dealing with multiple layer elements, such as sandwich panels where typically only 
the inner leaf is load bearing, it is important to consider how best to account for the effect on 
gravity loading when setting up the analysis model. There are several methods to efficiently 
model these walls. One method is to model the geometry of the inner leaf of the sandwich

panel as it is and modify its material properties, manually inputting a denser material that 
accounts for the self-weight of the non-structural leaf and the self-weight of any windows, 
doors or cladding within the panel. This works very well for sandwich panels that have a 
repetitive profile but care must be taken to identify any changes to the profile geometry and 
thickness of the non-structural leaf as this can significantly alter the total self-weight of 
the panel. Another method, of course, is to simply use the commands and functions within 
the software package and apply the self-weight loading from the non-structural outer leaf, 
windows, doors, etc. to the structural load-bearing leaf. The decision on what method to 
use for setting up the model generally comes down to the speed or level of accuracy required 
when modelling.
16.3.5 Model verification
As part of the design process, it is crucial to verify the model outputs. The checks below 
are a minimum and each project should be reviewed for any unusual details, geometry or 
applied loading. Specific checks need to be identified on a project-by-project basis.
General checks in the model must be undertaken to ensure no obvious anomalies have 
occurred such as very large deflections or unexpected high concentration of forces.
The first check is typically to ensure all gravity loads have been applied to the structure 
by checking overall reactions in a hand check against software results.
The lateral distribution of forces must also be checked. In simple terms, the software will cal￾culate the position of the applied loads and the centre of rigidity of the structure in order to dis￾tribute the loads. As previously stated, the modelling of walls being connected or released plays 
a key role in this load distribution. It is imperative to carry out hand checks to ensure that any 
connected wall arrangements are justified as behaving monolithically and also that the construc￾tion details will allow walls that are assumed to be released to behave as independent panels.
16.4 PRECAST RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES
16.4.1 Multi-storey apartment buildings
The residential multi-storey project at Arena Central in Birmingham, UK, was a fully pre￾cast crosswall structure erected on top of an insitu concrete transfer structure. Figure 16.13 
shows the general arrangement plan for the building, comprising two blocks A and B. 
Figure 16.14 shows the featured balconies at the corner of Block B.
The two levels of insitu structure under the transfer slab were clad with single skin archi￾tectural precast concrete cladding to match the finish of the precast structure above. The 
superstructure was built entirely from precast elements, namely: crosswalls, sandwich pan￾els, hcu, stairs and landings, parapets and balconies.
The 250mm depth hcu forming the rigid floor diaphragm had a maximum clear span of 
9.95m and were designed without the need for a structural topping. The balconies and their 
design were a feature of the project and will be discussed in this chapter. The following is an 
extract from the basis of design for the project.

16.4.3 Balcony design
The balconies were an important architectural feature and an engineering design challenge 
on the project. The corner balconies and the straight balconies used two different methods 
for support and restraint back to the main structure.
16.4.4 Corner balconies
The corner balconies were supported on the outer leaf of the sandwich panels; this required 
both the inner and outer leaf of the sandwich panels at these locations to be designed as 
load bearing. To support the loading and satisfy the fire performance requirements, the 
outer leaf was increased in thickness to 160mm. Restraint was provided by using a bolted 
connection between the outer load-bearing leaf and the inner load-bearing leaf as shown 
in Figure 16.15, the inner leaf is tied back into the hcu and floor diaphragm through the 
horizontal tie reinforcement details.Case studies 579
A steel beam cast within the balcony to cantilever in one direction at the corner, and a 
reinforced concrete beam was formed within the beam to cantilever in the other direction. 
Although the balcony slab was cast as one unit with the integral beams, it makes it easy to 
understand how the design works by thinking of them as separate beams providing the sup￾port for balcony slabs spanning as shown in Figure 16.16. The inside edge of the balcony 
is supported on the outer leaf, shown hatched in Figure 16.16, the circles on the walls indi￾cate the position of vertical ties on the inner and outer leaves and also bolted connections 
between the balcony and the outer leaf. The back-spans for the cantilever beams within the 
balcony slab run along the top of the hatched outer leaf.
The upstand walls visible in Figure 16.17 were cast onto the balcony slabs in a second 
stage of manufacture prior to being sent to site. The glass balustrades were installed on site 
at ground level prior to lifting the balconies into position.
16.4.5 Straight balconies
The straight balconies were supported on the inner leaf of the sandwich panels and restrained 
back to the hcu and floor diaphragm using steel plates. The balconies were manufactured 
with steel beams cast into them at approximately 1000mm centres along their length. The 
beams then projected from the balconies across the width of the cavity on the sandwich 
panels. Each steel beam was fabricated with a welded end plate designed to make the con￾nection to the sandwich panel. The balconies were installed onto the building by landing 
the end plates onto RSA’s cast into the sandwich panels. The RSA supported the vertical 
load. The endplates were manufactured with oversize holes that fitted over threaded rods 
projecting from the sandwich panel. A plate washer was used to complete the bolted con￾nection between the endplate and the sandwich panel. The threaded rods were cast into 
the sandwich panel, and this anchorage detail was designed and reinforced to deal with the 
tension forces generated by the cantilever balcony. Figure 16.18 illustrates the details of the 
connection method. The end plate was isolated from the RSA by a structural thermal break 
to ensure the Psi value for this junction satisfied the thermal performance requirements. The 
Psi value is a measure of heat lost through a junction such as the connection of an external 
balcony to an internal structural wall.

The top of the sandwich panel was tied to the hcu using steel plates and bolted con￾nections. A cast-in wavy tail anchor was used to make the bolted connection to the wall. 
A threaded rod with nuts and a plate washer was used to form the connection to the 
slab. During the production process, the hcu had side pockets pre-formed along their 
lengths to align with the connection points in the wall. The peripheral tie strand was 
positioned as shown in Figure 16.18. All plates and bolted connections were installed, 
and the side pockets and the joint between the wall and slab were infilled with insitu
concrete. Figure 16.19 shows the straight balconies and corner balconies on one eleva￾tion of Block A with a number of the corner balconies on Block B visible on the left of 
the photograph.
16.5 PRECAST EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS
16.5.1 Manchester Metropolitan University, Birley Fields, UK
The project consisted of an almost fully precast structure with insitu concrete toppings to 
the precast prestressed floor units. The only structural members not manufactured from 
concrete were two steel box girder transfer beams at second floor level and five steel trusses 
supporting the sports hall roof.
The architectural intent was for the concrete columns, beams and slab soffits to be 
exposed to view throughout the building; this required an extremely high quality of finish. 
The exposed concrete surfaces also ensured the benefits of the thermal mass of the struc￾ture could be utilized. The precast plate flooring units had heating and cooling pipework 
cast into them during manufacture. The exposed concrete soffits were a necessity to maxi￾mise the efficiency of this method for internal temperature control. Figure 16.20 shows the

and a 17m high circular column. The Spanish Steps were a communal seating and congrega￾tion space in the entrance foyer that resembles large terrace units.
16.5.2 Build statistics
The precast structure consisted of hcu, plate flooring, beams, columns, walls, Spanish Steps 
terrace units, stairs and landings The total weight of the precast elements supplied to the 
project was 26,170 tonnes. The heaviest single piece weighed 28.7 tonnes. There were 5936 
tonnes of insitu concrete poured to complete the construction of the floor slabs. Quantities 
for each of the 2240 precast product type are as follows: 327 no. columns, 546 no. beams, 
325 no. wall panels, 55 no. stair flights, 64 no. ‘landing’ slabs, 36 no. terrace units, 753 no. 
plate flooring units, and 134 no. hollow core units giving a total floor area of 16,333m2. 
The erection phase was competed in a 20-week site programme. This included the erection 
of the steel box girders and trusses.
16.5.3 Precast connections
The stability of the structure was provided by the four stair cores. These were positioned 
symmetrically on the rectangular footprint of the building close to each corner. The precast 
walls forming the cores were designed as vertical cantilever shear walls. The walls were pan￾elised to span vertically from floor to floor, being pinned and restrained at each floor level.
16.5.4 Connections at horizontal joints
The precast walls were connected to the insitu foundation with starter bars and spirol 
tube grout sleeves cast vertically into the walls. Spirol tube grout sleeves are helical 
ribbed metal formers used to provide an idented key inside the precast unit suitable for 
anchoring reinforcement bars. Figure 16.21 shows a wall on the back of a trailer with 
Figure 16.21 Grout sleeves in wall at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK.584 Precast Prestressed Concrete for Building Structures

the grout sleeves visible at its base. Figure 16.22 shows the starter bars projecting from 
the insitu foundation level, the walls are lowered into position over the top of the starter 
bars which align with the grout sleeves. The connection is completed by filling the grout 
sleeves with a high flow non-shrink grout. This connection is designed to resist the ten￾sion forces generated from the lateral loading applied to the shear walls through the floor 
diaphragm. Figure 16.23 shows the walls installed and propped off precast kentledge 
blocks.
At first floor level and above, the connection at the horizontal joint was formed using 
a proprietary wall shoe. Figure 16.24 shows the alternative principles that can be used

when designing this connection. Figures 16.25 and 16.26 show the projecting threaded 
rod and box out details, respectively. The threaded rod is cast in or screwed into a female 
thread in the top of the wall below the horizontal joint. A boxed-out steel anchorage 
assembly is cast into the bottom of the wall above the horizontal joint. On site a plate 
washer and nut are used to mechanically fix the walls together. The boxed out section is 
then infilled with grout to compete the connection. The manufacturers of these wall shoe 
systems provide technical data on tension capacity, reinforcement details, minimum wall 
dimensions, etc.
16.5.4 Connections at vertical joints
The vertical connection between panels is provided by loop boxes. The loop boxes transfer 
load across the vertical joints to allow the wall panels to be designed as a monolithic shear 
wall rather than individual sections. The shear forces are checked as discussed in Section 
16.3 to ensure the loop boxes have adequate capacity. Figure 16.27 shows loop boxes pro￾jecting from the edge of the wall. The wall that is installed adjacent to this wall will have 
corresponding load boxes cast in along its height.
On site, a continuous vertical reinforcement bar, as shown in Figure 16.28, is fixed between 
the loop boxes and the joints are filled with a pourable non-shrink grout. Figure  16.29 
shows the completed stair core with the individual precast walls connected together using 
loop boxes in the vertical joints and wall shoes in the horizontal joints at the levels above 
foundation.
