Preface
This book has been written after more than two decades of teaching experience
in chemical reactor engineering. During these years, I have been collecting prob￾lems posed to undergraduate and master’s students, which are now compiled here
along with their solutions. This is not a basic chemical reactor engineering (CRE)
book; instead, it covers the design of nonideal, catalytic, multiphase, and biochemi￾cal reactors.
Following the publication of my book Chemical Reactor Design: Mathematical
Modeling and Applications in 2019, this book addresses aspects not covered in basic
textbooks dedicated to reactor design. The concepts introduced in my earlier book
are further developed here through solved examples. This approach aims to help
the reader gain a deeper understanding of reactor design procedures, especially in
the context of nonideal and heterogeneous reactors.
This collection of solved problems in advanced chemical reactor engineering pro￾vides in-depth coverage of complex reactor design issues, such as the design of cat￾alytic or biochemical reactors. It is not a basic book covering simple concepts.
The book is accompanied by electronic materials, including spreadsheets and
Matlab® programs, which can be downloaded from the Wiley website at http://
www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115.
The tools used in this book are not complex, and the solutions are presented in a
simplified manner. I primarily use spreadsheets and occasionally incorporate Mat￾lab. Importantly, the programs are designed to be highly understandable.

Σ(C(t)dt) = 771 tm = 10.98 s 𝜎2 = 46.88 s2
We can calculate time increment as the difference between time in two
experimental data; in the third column, concentration and time increment are
multiplied. For a better calculation, instead of calculating C(t)⋅Δt for each time
directly, we can use the average value of C(t) between two consecutive data.
This is called Simpson’s rule for evaluating areas graphically. The sum of the
values in this column would give the area of the C(t) curve, so in the fourth
column, the following relationship is applied to calculate E(t):
E(t) = C(t)
∫ ∞
0 C(t) ⋅ dt
= C(t)
7718 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization
In the next columns, the average value of E(t) between two consecutive data is
multiplied by time, by time increment, and the sum would represent mean time,
as we have:
tm = ∫
∞

t ⋅ E(t)dt = ∑
all points
t ⋅ E(t) ⋅ Δt = 10.98 s
In a similar way, variance is calculated:
𝜎2 = ∑
all points
(t − tm)
2 ⋅ E(t) ⋅ Δt = 46.88 s2
Finally, we can calculate F(t) and I(t) according to their definitions:
F(t) = ∑
all points at time<t
E(t) ⋅ Δt
I(t) = 1 − F(t)

𝜎2 = 10.982
46.88 = 2.57 tanks
For the dispersion model to be applied, first we should assume Bo<0.01, and
then:
𝜎2 = 2 ⋅ Bo
We obtain Bo = 11.24 ≫ 0.01, so this assumption is not valid.
Assuming now Bo>0.01 and closed–closed recipient:
( 𝜎
tm
)2
= 2 ⋅ Bo − 2 ⋅ Bo2 ⋅
[
1 − exp (

)]
From that:
46.88
10.982 = 2 ⋅ Bo − 2 ⋅ Bo2 ⋅
[
1 − exp (

Bo
)]
and we obtain Bo = 0.2413, and Pe = 1/Bo = 4.14.
On the other hand, if an o–o recipient is assumed:
( 𝜎
tm
)2
= 2 ⋅ Bo + 8 ⋅ Bo2
Obtaining Bo = 0.127 and Pe = 7.85.
For checking which one of the conditions is fulfilled, data about average time
in the recipient is needed in order to test if the equation tm = t ⋅ (1 + 2 ⋅ Bo) is
satisfied.
t = Length
Linear velocity = 274 cm
35.70 cm
s
= 7.67 s10 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization
So, we have that:
10.98 = 7.67 (1 + 2Bo)
Obtaining Bo = 0.215. This difference between tm and t indicates that probably
the recipient is open.
Problem 1.2 An experiment to characterize a tubular reactor was conducted using
a technique in which a tracer is continuously fed into the system. At a specific time,
the tracer supply is halted. From this point onward, the exit signal is recorded, resem￾bling what can be termed a “decreasing step input” (or negative step). In this exper￾iment, the following data were obtained:
t (min) 0 1 2 4 6 7 8 10
C (g/l) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.1 0 0 0
(a) Calculate the RTD of this reactor.
(b) What fraction of the fluid spends more than 3 minutes in the reactor? Make a
plot of the procedure.
(c) What fraction of the fluid spends between 3 and 4 minutes in the reactor?
Solution to Problem 1.2
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) Following this procedure, the exit signal will be related to the cumulative RTD
of the system, F(t), but the actual function obtained is the internal age function,
I(t). In the spreadsheet, we can do the following calculation:
t (min) C (g/l) C/Cmax I(t) F(t) E(t) = 𝚫F/𝚫t

(b) For calculating the fraction of fluid that spends a time in the reactor, we use the
definition of E(t):
Fluid passing more than 3 minutes = f>3 = ∫
∞

E(t)dt
This integration can be done numerically, in increments:
f>3 = E(3) ⋅ Δt + E(4) ⋅ Δt + E(5) ⋅ Δt + E(6) ⋅ Δt + E(7) ⋅ Δt
where Δt is obviously 1 minute. Graphically, the approximation of the integral
would be the following:

using smaller time increments, but this is not possible with the obtained data.12 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization

Problem 1.4
CSTR PFR V1
V2
PFR V1 CSTR
V2
In the given reactor configurations, where the total volume is represented as
V = V1 + V2, and the ratio V1/V2 is imposed, we need to determine the ratio of
the volumes V1/V2 in the second configuration in order to achieve the same exit
conversion, XA2, for both a first-order reaction and a second-order reaction.
Solution to Problem 1.4
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
In the first case:
PFR V1 CSTR
V2
CA0
CA1
CA2
We can write:
XA1 = 1 − exp (
−k ⋅
V1
Q0
)16 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization
and in the CSTR:
Q0CA1 = (−rA)V2 + Q0CA2
Q0CA0(1 − XA1) = (k ⋅ CA0(1 − XA2)) ⋅ V2 + Q0CA0(1 − XA2)
(1 − XA1) = (k ⋅ (1 − XA2)) ⋅
V2
Q0
+ (1 − XA2)
And solving for XA2:
(1 − XA2) = (1 − XA1)
1 + k ⋅ V2
Q0
=
exp (
−k ⋅ V1
Q0
)
1 + k ⋅ V2
Q0
In the second configuration:
CSTR PFR V1
V2
CA0
CA1 CA2
we have, in the CSTR: Q0CA0 = (−rA)V2 + Q0CA1
So: XA1 = 1 − 1
1+k⋅
V2
Q0
. Then, in the PFR:
∫

that is:
ln (1 − XA1

1 − XA2 = (1 − XA1) ⋅ exp (

1 + k ⋅ V2
Q0
We can check that both configurations give the same final conversion.
In the case where a second-order reaction took place, the procedure is similar. In
that case, for the first configuration, in the PFR:
dnA = Q0 ⋅ dCA = (rA) ⋅ dV = −k ⋅ C2
A ⋅ dV
−Q0 ⋅ CA0 ⋅ dXA = −k ⋅ C2
A0 ⋅ (1 − XA)
2 ⋅ dVSummary of Residence Time Distribution Properties and Most Important Models 17

Q0
and in the CSTR:
Q0CA0(1 − XA1) = k ⋅ C2
A0(1 − XA2)
2V2 + Q0CA0(1 − XA2)
So finally:
Q0CA0
1
1 + k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ V1
Q0
= k ⋅ C2
A0(1 − XA2)
2
V2 + Q0CA0(1 − XA2)
k ⋅ CA0(1 − XA2)
2 V2
Q0
+ (1 − XA2) − (1 − XA1) = 0
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2 ⋅ (1 − XA2)
2 + (1 − XA2) − (1 − XA1) = 0
This expression is a second-order equation. It is quite complicated to solve the final
conversion, but finally, for the first configuration:
(1 − XA2) = −1 + (1 + 4 ⋅ k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2 ⋅ (1 − XA1))0.5
2 ⋅ k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2
Obviously, the other solution with minus sign does not make sense.
In the second configuration, following the same procedure:
Q0CA0 = k ⋅ C2
A0(1 − XA1)
2
V2 + Q0CA0(1 − XA1)
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2 ⋅ (1 − XA1)
2 + (1 − XA1) − 1 = 0
(1 − XA1) = −1 + (1 + 4 ⋅ k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2)
0.5
2 ⋅ k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2
and finally, in the PFR:
(1 − XA2) =
1 − XA1
1 + k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ t2 + (1 − XA1)
We can check the form of the solution by assuming values of the constants. For
example, k⋅CA0 =0.1 mol/l⋅s, Q0 =1 l/s, V =100 l, and the following graphs can be
calculated. As we can check, in any case, the first configuration (PFR+CSTR) gives
a higher conversion than the second configuration (CSTR+PFR). In all cases, V1
refers to the volume of the PFR and V2 to that of CSTR.18 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization

The first thing to do is to calculate E(t) by using the data from F(t). This is done
by numerical derivation, i.e.,
E(t) = ΔF(t)
Δt = Ft+1 − Ft
Δt
Once E(t) is known, both tm and 𝜎2 (whose equations are shown in the header of
the table) can be calculated.
When we already have the values of both tm and 𝜎2, we can calculate the required
values.
The first model that is studied is the TIS. The parameter of such a model is nt:
nt = t
2
m
𝜎2 = 6.14 tanks
In order to be able to compare the E(t) obtained by the model with the E(t)
obtained experimentally, it is also necessary to calculate t = 42.29∕6.14 = 2.62 s.
On the other hand, to determine the deviation between the points obtained experi￾mentally and with the method, the sum of the squared differences between all the
points has been calculated:
Deviation = ∑
all data
(E(t)calculated − E(t)measured)
2
E(t)
t (s)
Since the deviation is of the order of 2.36⋅10−3, it can be concluded that the method
can well predict the experimental E(t) values.
For the dispersion model, the first thing to calculate is the Bo number. In this case,
the operation that has been done is: 𝜎2 =2Bo, so Bo = 21.14.
Since Bo is greater than 0.01, a closed–closed system or an o–o system must be
chosen. In this exercise, we will use the o–o assumption. The first thing that is done
is to calculate the Bo with the equations that govern this o–o dispersion model:
tm = t ⋅ (1 + 2 ⋅ Bo)
( 𝜎
tm
)2
= 2 ⋅ Bo + 8 ⋅ Bo224 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization
Obtaining Bo = 0.074. The next step is to calculate E(t) with the closed–closed
dispersion model. To do this, the following equation is used:
E = 1

In view of the results, it is clear that the E(t) obtained with the model differs
greatly from the E(t) obtained experimentally. Therefore, it can be concluded that
this model will not correctly predict this example. On the other hand, when Bo is
greater than 0.01 (as in this case), the impulse response is wide, and this gives an
asymmetric E(t).
Problem 1.8 Consider a continuous reactor fed with a flow Q0 with a composition
CA0. Both operating variables are held constant. The (total) volume of the reactor
is VR and the space time, 𝜏, is defined based on this volume. The kinetics obeys
the expression (−rA) = kCa
A, and there are no secondary reactions. The reactor is
modeled as three identical continuous reactors, perfectly stirred, but it is considered
that there is also a certain current “mixed” between the three cameras, which is
equal to 𝛼⋅Q0. To visualize this, analyze the following diagram:

The value of E(t) is calculated by using a numerical method for deriving the F(t)
values read in the graph. In this way:
Et = Ft−1 − Ft
Δt
The value of tm is calculated by integrating (i.e. sum) of the values of (t⋅E(t)⋅Δt).
As we can see, in this system t ≠ tm. In fact, t > tm,so we would expect to get the E(t)
signal later. This is probably due to the fact that flow rate is not measured correctly,
or that there is a dead volume not contributing to the total residence time in the
reactor. In any case, we first try to find the Bo number for applying the dispersion
model. Assuming that Bo<0.01, we can do 𝜎2 = 2 ⋅ Bo, and we find that Bo ≫ 0.01,
so the assumption is not correct. For Bo>0.01 and assuming o–o conditions:
( 𝜎

)2
= 2 ⋅ Bo + 8 ⋅ Bo2
finding that Bo = 0.3113 that is actually quite a high value (Bo>0.2). We can assume
that the reactor would be similar to a CSTR. Indeed, if we apply the TIS model, we

Do a mass balance in this system for a tracer pulse input and determine the resi￾dence time distribution function in the case where tank 1 is very small compared to
tank 2 and the transfer speed between the reactors is very small.
Solution to Problem 1.14
If we propose a molar balance on the tracer, with a pulse injected at t = 0 for each of
the tanks, we obtain:
Accumulation = Input − Output (there is no tracer generation)
V1
dCT1
dt = Q1CT2 − (Q0CT1 + Q1CT1) (in the first tank)
V2
dCT2
dt = Q1CT1 − Q1CT2 (in the second tank)
where CT1 and CT2 are, respectively, tracer concentrations in both reactors. These
two differential equations are coupled and should be solved simultaneously.
In this model, the two adjustable parameters are the flow rate exchanged (Q1) and
the volume of the most agitated region (V1). Remember that the measured volume
(V) is the sum of V1 and V2. We will call 𝛽 the fraction of the total flow that is trans￾ferred between both reactors:
Q1 = 𝛽 ⋅ Q0
and 𝛼 to the fraction of the total volume that corresponds to the most agitated area:
V1 = 𝛼 ⋅ V → V2 = (1 − 𝛼) ⋅ V
On the other hand, the average time (t) is given by the quotient V/Q0.
The initial conditions (t =0) for this model are: (i) CT1 = (CT1)0, and (ii) (CT2)0 = 0.

Previous equation shows that, if tank 1 is small compared to 2 (𝛼 small), and the
transfer speed between both reactors is small (𝛽 small), the second exponential term
tends to 1 during the first part of the response to an impulse injection. During the
second part, the first exponential term tends to 0. If we represent the logarithm of
the tracer concentration versus time, the response curve will tend to a straight line
at both ends of the curve, and the parameters will be obtained from the slopes (m1
for t → ∞ and m2 for t → 0) and the cut points of both lines (for t → ∞, the cut point
is −{𝛼m2 + 𝛽 +1}/𝛼{m1 − m2}).

Problem 1.18 A reaction system is described by the following model:
Vm = α·V Q Q
Vd = (1–α)·V
β·Q
At a given moment, the system presents values of 𝛼 =0.1 and 𝛽 =0.9. A series of
reforms are carried out in the system, and it is achieved that 𝛼 =0.9 and 𝛽 =0.1.
(a) Qualitatively draw the response of the system to a tracer impulse, comparing the
two situations.
(b) Also, draw the corresponding F(t) curves for both situations.
(c) Indicate what reforms had to be made to achieve this change.
Solution to Problem 1.18
(a) In this system, the residence time compared to that expected is:
tactual = Vm
Qreactor
= 𝛼V
(1 − 𝛽)Q = 𝛼
(1 − 𝛽)
texpected
As we have that 𝛼 =0.1 and 𝛽 =0.9 at the beginning:
tactual = 0.1
(1 − 0.9)
texpected = texpected
In the second case:
tactual = 0.9
(1 − 0.1)
texpected = texpected
So it will be very difficult to observe these changes. Nevertheless, the bypass pro￾duces a very important peak at time equal to zero in both situations, but the amount
of tracer passing through the bypass is much higher in the first case. We can have
something similar to:Summary of Residence Time Distribution Properties and Most Important Models 43

Problem 1.21 A common issue encountered in the development of gas and liquid
phase chromatographic analysis methods is the phenomenon of “tailing.” Tailing
makes it challenging to characterize the retention time of a specific species due to
the prolonged tail associated with the peak. An approximate representation of tailing48 1 Non-ideal Flow and Reactor Characterization
can be described by the time dependence of the effluent concentration of the species
as follows:
CA = 0 for 0 < t < 8.5 min
CA = 105 e−2t for t > 8.5 min
for CA in pmol/ml. The curve is generated by injecting a pulse of a sample containing
species A into a solvent flowing through the chromatographic column at a constant
flow rate.
(a) Determine the mathematical form of the F(t) curve corresponding to the
response of the pulse test.
(b) Use the F(t) curve to calculate the average residence time of species A in the
column.

Problem 2.1 For the E(t) distribution and modeling of Problem 1.3, calculate the
reactor conversion for a given reaction of first-order with a constant (k) of 0.1 min−1
for the following models: the TIS model, segregation model, dispersion model, plug
flow, and completely stirred tank reactor.
Solution to Problem 2.1
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115

t = tm = 10.12 s
𝜎2 = 80.99 s2
nt = t
2
m
𝜎2 = 10.122
80.99 = 1.26 tanks
Using the dispersion model, as it occurs in Problem 1.1, we do not know if the
recipient is closed or open. Assuming closed–closed condition, we obtain Bo = 1.33
and Pe = 0.75.
For calculating the different conversions, we use the corresponding mass balances.
In the TIS model, we have:

XA = ∑

XA(t)E(t)Δt = 0.524

1 − XA =

− (1 − a)2 ⋅ exp (

with
a = [1 + 4(t ⋅ k) ⋅ Bo]

With the data of this problem:
a = [1 + 4(10.12 ⋅ 0.1) ⋅ 1.33]
1∕2 = 2.529
obtaining: XA = 0.5291.
If the system is a simple FPR, a mass balance would give:
dnA = Q0 ⋅ dCA = (rA) ⋅ dV = −k ⋅ CA ⋅ dV
Using the relationships CA = CA0(1−XA) and dCA = CA0 ⋅(−dXA) we can obtain:

so:

In a CSTR:
Q0CA0 = rA ⋅ V + Q0 ⋅ CA
that gives:
XA = 1 − 1

Problem 2.2 A 5000-l packed reactor is used to dimerize A following the second￾order reaction 2A → B. The constant for the rate, referred to as mole of reaction,
is 8.7 × 10−3 l/mol ⋅s. Feed consists of 15 l/s of a 0.8 M solution of A. The reactor
has an internal diameter of 88 cm, and the axial dispersion coefficient is 500 cm2/s.
The packed bed porosity is 0.45, and the density of the packed catalyst is 0.8 g/cm3.
Density cm3 refers to packed bed volume.
(a) Obtain the homogeneous expression of the reaction rate and calculate the con￾version fraction at the outlet of an ideal plug flow reactor (PFR).
(b) Compare the result with the conversion that would be obtained considering the

(b) The data we have are the following:
• dt = 88 cm
• D = 500 cm2/s
• 𝜀 = 0.45
• 𝜌 = 0.8 g/cm3
The parameter we should know for calculating conversion with the dispersion
model is Bo, i.e., the dispersion number, which for a packed bed is:
Bo = 𝜀D
dp ⋅ u
Value of superficial velocity is u = Q0
(π⋅d2
t)⋅𝜀 = 5.48 cm
s and particle diameter, dp,
can be estimated using the correlation:
𝜀 = 0.4 + 0.05 (dp

obtaining dp = 0.25 m and Bo = 1.59.
With value of kCA0t = 2.32 and Bo = 1.59, we can check with the corresponding
equation or graphically that conversion is XA = 0.60:

If a TIS model is assumed:

𝜎2 = 64
This means that this reactor is more similar to a PFR than to a CSTR (high value

resulting Bo = 0.022. Now, using the equation or the figures corresponding
to the dispersion model (shown in the initial part of this chapter), with Da =

and in the second one:
kC2
A2t + CA2 − CA1 = 0
We can check CA1 = 0.442 M and CA2 = 0.181 M, so the conversion is

Problem 2.7 A first-order reaction occurs in a tubular-geometry reactor. The dis￾tribution of residence times is given by:
E(t) = 0.04t for 0< t <5 min
E(t) = 0.4–0.04t if 5< t <10 min
E(t) = 0 if t >10 min
At 50 ∘C, the reaction rate constant referred to as mole of reactant is 0.1833 min−1.
The activation energy for the reaction being produced is 25 cal/mol.
(a) Calculate the conversion fraction at the actual reactor outlet if it is operated at
50 ∘C.
On the other hand, the possibility of carrying out the conversion in an ideal PFR
that has the same residence time is being studied. Calculate:
(b) The conversion fraction at the output.
(c) The uncertainty in that conversion fraction if there is an uncertainty of ±1 ∘C in
the operating temperature.70 2 Chemical Reaction in Non-ideal Reactors
The goal of this problem is to raise concern about whether deviations from ideality
in flow patterns are worth considering when there are significant uncertainties in
other parameters.

So t = tm = 5 min and the conversion calculated using segregation model is

k = k0 exp (

0.1833 = k0 exp (

and k0 = 1.54 ⋅ 1016 min−1.
Now:
k49 ∘C = 0.162 min−1
k51 ∘C = 0.206 min−1
Doing a similar calculation to that shown previously:
XA,49 ∘C = 1 − exp(−k49 ∘Ct) = 0.556
XA,51 ∘C = 1 − exp(−k51 ∘Ct) = 0.644
Problem 2.8 To decompose a contaminant A, a photoreactor is used . For simplic￾ity, let us consider that the reactor is tubular and is made of transparent glass at the
wavelength necessary to excite the photocatalyst. This tube that forms the reactor
has a length of 8 m and an internal diameter of 2.21 cm. The outside of the glass
tube is uniformly illuminated by an ultraviolet light source. The reaction occurs in
the presence of UV light and can be schematized as:
A + 1/2B → Safe products
where B is an oxidizing agent. The reaction rate in homogeneous units is given by:

where the catalyst concentration and light intensity are included within the rate con￾stant. The suspended catalyst is very fine particles of TiO2, whose volume must be
assumed to be negligible for calculation purposes. The feed consists of an aqueous
solution diluted with 0.05 M of A and 0 03 M of B. Determine the conversion fraction
achieved if the volumetric flow fed is: (a) 7.5 l/min and (b) 1.5 l/min.
Solution to Problem 2.8

In the PFR:
dnA = Q0 ⋅ dCA = rA ⋅ dV
rA = −k ⋅ CA ⋅ C0.8

So:
Q0 ⋅ dCA = −k ⋅ CA ⋅ C0.8
B ⋅ dV
And:
nB = nB0 + nA0 ⋅ (−1∕2) ⋅ XA
With:
XA = (nA0 − nA)∕nA0
i.e.,
nB = nB0 − 1∕2 ⋅ (nA0 − nA)
As we are treating a liquid, flow rate is constant, and:
CB = CB0 − 1∕2 ⋅ CA0 + 1∕2 ⋅ CA

Problem 2.9 A continuous reactor can be modeled as eight stirred tank reac￾tors connected in series. The reaction kinetics can be considered first-order with
a rate constant, referred to as mole of reactant, of 0.25 min−1. 625 l/min are fed, and
the reactor volume is 1.275 l. Calculate the output conversion fraction and analyze
which ideal continuous reactors performance is closest.

8 = 0.255 min
And the conversion is:
XA = 1 − 1
(1 + 0.255 ⋅ 0.25)8 = 0.390
If it were a PFR:
XA = 1 − exp(−kt) = 1 − exp (
−0.25 ⋅ 1275
625
)
= 0.399
If, on the contrary, the reactor were a single CSTR:
XA = kt
1 + kt

So, undoubtedly, the reactor is more like a PFR.
Problem 2.10 A 2000-l tubular reactor is fed with 20 mol/s of which 0.2 mol/s is
A and the rest is an inert I. The operating conditions are 200 ∘C and 2 atm. The
reaction order is unity, and the rate constant referred to as mole of A is 0.2 s−1.
The internal diameter of the reactor is 20 cm. If the axial dispersion is 50 m2/s, cal￾culate the output conversion and compare it with that which would be estimated
based on the ideal plug flow model.

The value of residence time is:

and the “a” value is 1.12, finally giving a conversion of XA = 0.6226.
If the reactor were a PFR, the conversion would be:
XA = 1 − exp(−kt) = 0.6434
Problem 2.11 The decomposition of a compound that is produced with the fol￾lowing reaction is being studied:

In the case of continuous reactors, spatial time is analyzed, while for batch
reactors, it is necessary to calculate the precise time to achieve the complete

In the batch reactor:
NA = NA0(1 − XA) (mol)
NB = NB0 + 3NA0XA = 3NA0XA (mol)
Ntotal = NA + NB = NA0(1 + 2XA)
The expansion factor in this reaction is 𝜀exp = 2, so the volume expands as follows:
V = V0 P0
P
T
T0 (1 + 2XA) = V0
(1 + 2XA)
where the superscript “0” indicates the beginning of the reaction, and the effect of
pressure and temperature is eliminated by isothermal and isochore operations. The
concentration of the reactant then follows:
CA = NA
V = NA0(1 − XA)
V0(1 + 2XA) = CA0

In a CSTR:
rA = nA − nA0
V = −k
We find that:
CA = CA0 − k ⋅ t
So again, the answer is 30 seconds.76 2 Chemical Reaction in Non-ideal Reactors

the conversion is 2/3 in an ideal CSTR.

Note that tm for XA = 0.667 (with CA0 = 6 kmol/m3) is lower than that necessary
for XA = 0.6 (with CA0 = 5 kmol/m3). This is only possible if kinetics is not
first-order.
Problem 2.13 In a laboratory-scale isothermal ideal CSTR, substance A under￾goes conversion into substance B. Each mole of A results in the formation of
one mole of B. The CSTR is supplied with a stream of pure A, which has previ￾ously experienced partial conversion into B. The feed composition is as follows:
CA,feed = 10 kmol/m3 and CB,feed/CA,feed = 10/990. The following table illustrates the
observed correlation between space time and feed conversion:

(a) In this situation, we have:
CSTR Q0, CA0
βQ0, CA
Q0 (1 + β) Q , CA 0, CAfeed
CBfeed
Let us try to find the kinetic expression. We will assume, as a first guess, a
second-order kinetics:
(−rA) = kCACB
A balance of “A” in the reactor would be:
nA,feed + (rA)V = nA
(1 + 𝛽)Q0CA,feed − kCACBV = (1 + 𝛽)Q0CASummary of Most Important Models 79
Let the quotient V
Q0
be the space time in the reactor (t):
CA,feed − kCACB
t
(1 + 𝛽) = CA
With:
CA = CA,feed(1 − XA)
CB = CB,feed + CA,feedXA
So:
CA,feed − kCA,feed(1 − XA)(CB,feed + CA,feedXA) t
(1 + 𝛽) = CA,feed(1 − XA)
Solving for the kinetic constant:
k = −CA,feed(1 − XA) + CA,feed
CA,feed(1 − XA)(CB,feed + CA,feedXA) t
(1+𝛽)
= CA,feedXA
CA,feed(1 − XA)(CB,feed + CA,feedXA) t
(1+𝛽)
Let us try to check if all the data in the reactor give the same value of kinetic
constant:
Time (min) XA CA CB k (l/min ⋅ mol) rA (mol/min ⋅ l)
0 0.01 9.9 0.1
0.03 0.2 8 2 4.006 64.096
0.041 0.4 6 4 4.005 96.110
0.049 0.5 5 5 4.041 101.021
0.062 0.6 4 6 4.005 96.124
0.124 0.8 2 8 4.022 64.349
As we can check, the “k” value is the same in the different runs, so probably the
kinetic law is second-order.
(b) In the previous table, it was also indicated that the value of (−rA) = kCACB,
reaching a maximum at 0.049 min.
Problem 2.14 The transformation of substance A into substance B, following the
reaction A → B, occurs across three series-connected ideal CSTRs. These CSTRs pos￾sess volumes of 4, 10, and 20 l, respectively. The feed comprises a flow of pure A at a
rate of 100 l/min, featuring a concentration of CA = 10 mol/l.
The reaction rate equation is defined as (−rA) = kC2
A, where k = 2 l/mol ⋅ min.
(a) Our initial task involves determining the exit concentrations of the first, second,
and third tanks.
(b) Subsequently, we will construct a graph of 1/(−rA) versus CA, delineating the
regions corresponding to the volumes of the first, second, and third tanks.80 2 Chemical Reaction in Non-ideal Reactors
(c) Within the graph from part (b), we will demarcate the region representing the
volume of a PFR necessary to achieve an equivalent conversion to the three
CSTRs in series.
(d) Estimation of the PFR volume from part (c) will be conducted using area ratios
and the specified tank volumes. We will then juxtapose this estimated volume
with the volume of a PFR derived from the molar balance for conversion in a
PFR from CA0 to CA3 (the concentration of A in the third CSTR).

Problem 2.15 Species B is derived from species A through a first-order irreversible
reaction A → B. The system configuration involves two parallel CSTRs, as depicted
in the accompanying figure. The volumes of the CSTRs are labeled as V1 and V2,
with V1 being greater than V2.82 2 Chemical Reaction in Non-ideal Reactors
(a) In order to achieve an identical level of conversion XA,out as XA1 = XA2, we need
to determine the volume of a CSTR capable of converting the molar flow Q0 ⋅ CA0.
(b) To maximize conversion when the CSTRs are connected in series, it is necessary
to determine the optimal sequence of the two reactors, V1 or V2, to be placed
first.
(c) Assuming the total volume of the two CSTRs remains constant while allowing
flexibility in choosing the volume of each individual CSTR, we can compute the
optimal V1/V2 ratio. This ratio will facilitate achieving the highest possible con￾version when the two CSTRs are arranged in series.

Solution to Problem 2.15
(a) A balance in the mix point is:
Q1XA1 + Q2XA2 = Q0XAout
If XA1 = XA2:
(Q1 + Q2)XA1 = Q0XAout
(Q0)XA1 = Q0XAout
XA1 = XAout
So, in this way, V = V1 + V2.
(b) With two CSTRs connected in series:
XAout = 1 − 1
(1 + t1 ⋅ k)(1 + t2 ⋅ k)
As we have that t = t1 + t2, the combined conversion is not dependent on the
volume of each reactor.
(c) We have that:
XAout = 1 − 1

Equaling to zero:

(Vtotal − 2V1) = 0
So the maximum is found at Vtotal = 2V1, so the solution is V1 = V2.

Problem 2.17 In a commercial setup, the manufacturing of product R from sub￾stance A proceeds via a first-order irreversible liquid-phase reaction: A → R. The
reactor utilized in this procedure demonstrates non-ideal characteristics. Based on
experimental findings, the age distribution of volume elements exiting the reactor
can be characterized by the equation:
E(t) = E(0) − 0.1t
We need to determine:
(a) The value of E(0), represents the initial age distribution in the reactor.
(b) The conversion attained in the commercial reactor is such that an ideal CSTR
with an equivalent average residence time distribution achieves a 60% conver￾sion rate.
(c) Furthermore, in the scenario where the reaction A → R is not a first-order reac￾tion but rather a second-order reaction, we are tasked with drawing conclusions
solely based on the residence time distribution. Specifically, we need to deter￾mine whether the conversion will be lower, equal to, or higher than the observed
conversion in reality. The justification for the answer should be provided.
Solution to Problem 2.17
(a) The cuts with axis are:
t = 0 → E(t) = E(0)
E(t) = 0 → tf = E(0)/0.1
As we know, all distributions ∫ ∞
0 E(t)dt = 1
The area under E(t) is in this case: Area = E(0)
0.1 ⋅ E(0)
2 = 1, so E(0) = √
0.2 =
0.447 s−1
The value of time where the distribution is zero is tf = E(0)/0.1 = 4.47 s
From this distribution, we can also calculate:
tm = ∫
4.47

t ⋅ (0.447 − 0.1t)dt = 1.48 s
(b) We can use the segregation model:

With:
XA = 1 − exp(−kt)
XA = ∫
4.47

(1 − exp(−kt))(0.447 − 0.1t)dt
We know that in a CSTR with t = 1.48 s the conversion is 0.6, so:
0.6 = k ⋅ 1.48
1 + k ⋅ 1.48
Obtaining k = 1.01 s−1. Then:
XA = ∫
4.47
0
(1 − exp(−1.01t))(0.447 − 0.1t)dt = 0.654
(c) In the case of a second-order reaction:
XA = kCA0t
1 + kCA0t
And, using the segregation model:
XA = ∫
4.47
0
( kCA0t
1 + kCA0t
)
(0.447 − 0.1t)dt
Taking kCA0 = 1.01 s−1, we have XA =0.518.
Problem 2.18 In a continuous reaction system, the process of suspension poly￾merization unfolds. This intricate system involves suspending small monomer
droplets within oil with a volume flow rate of 1 m3/min. Besides, the system’s design
may influence factors like temperature control, initiator concentration, and mixing
efficiency, which play pivotal roles in the reaction kinetics. The reaction rate of the
monomer is governed by the following equation:
(−rmonomer) = 0.1C2
monomer …
( kmol
m3 ⋅ min
)
The system is considered to be fully segregated. Initially, the concentration of the
monomer in the droplets is 1 kmol/m3. Based on the analysis of residence time distri￾bution measurements, it is determined that within the reaction system operating at
a flow rate of 1 m3/min, no volume elements remain within the system for durations
exceeding 10 minutes. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that, for time intervals less than
10 minutes, the age distribution E(t) remains uniform. However, this observation
may overlook potential variations in temperature, pressure, and the presence of cat￾alysts, all of which can significantly influence reaction kinetics and product yields.
We need to calculate:
(a) The level of conversion achieved at the reactor outlet.
(b) The reactor’s volume.

Problem 2.19 During the investigation of the first-order irreversible reaction
A → P within an ideal CSTR, it was found that a conversion of 40% is achieved
within an average residence time t.
Subsequently, the same reaction is conducted in a non-ideal PFR under identical
average residence time and temperature conditions. In this non-ideal PFR, injecting
a marker pulse at t = 0 at the reactor inlet results in the following concentration

(b) Calculate the residence time t used for the non-ideal PFR, which should be the
same as in the ideal CSTR investigation, as stated in the problem.
(c) The conversion obtained with the non-ideal PFR can be determined by compar￾ing the concentration of A at the inlet and outlet of the reactor based on the
concentration profile obtained from the pulse test. The conversion can be calcu￾lated using the appropriate formula.

For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) For calculating conversion in the actual reactor, with its residence time distri￾bution, we need either to model the reactor using one of the known models for
non-ideal flow or propose a combination of ideal reactors giving the correspond￾ing E(t). Let us check how this distribution is in the reactor. By giving values to

At first sight, this distribution can be modeled using the dispersion model. Let
us calculate the corresponding parameters. Using the procedure explained in
Problems 1.1 and 1.2, we can calculate:
tm = 11.96 min
𝜎2 = 35.59 min2
And using the relationship:
( 𝜎

= 2 ⋅ Bo − 2 ⋅ Bo2 ⋅

We can estimate Bo = 0.125.
But in this problem, since two independent reactions are involved and an
analytical solution is apparently not possible, at least in a simple way, then
let us think of a numerical solution. We begin by stating the reaction ratesSummary of Most Important Models 89
for two independent species (A and B) and apply the design equations for a
liquid-phase batch reactor:
dCA
dt = −2k1C2
A + 2k′
1CB
dCB
dt = k1C2
A − k′
1CB − 2k2CB
Since the probability that a fluid element spends more than 30 min in the reactor
is zero, the integration is carried out up to this time. Using the finite differences
method, integration of CA can be done by:

The concentrations of species A and B at the outlet of the system correspond to
the average concentrations resulting from integrating the previous equations for
up to 30 minutes. In the figure, we can check that:
CA = 0.582 M
CB = 0.440 M
We must be aware that the “profiles” for CA and CB lack practical utility and that
we are only interested in the final results of the integration. Both profiles are
shown flat for 25< t <30 min; this is because the probability that fed elements
come out in this period is low and there is a very little contribution to the average
value.
Note that the following procedure is equivalent to applying the segregation
model:
CA = ∫
∞
0
CA(t)E(t)dt
but values of CA(t) are known numerically instead as a definite mathematical
function.
Finally, the conversion of species A at the exit of the reactor is:
XA = 1 − CA
CA0
= CA0 − CA
CA0
= 0.657
And the selectivity is:
SB = 2CB
CA0 − CA
= 0.788
(b) Data do not include reactor volume or feed volumetric flow rate; therefore, the
space time, which because it is about liquids is equal to the residence time,
must be estimated based on the distribution of residence times. As we have
already mentioned, tm = 11.96 min. From the data used to generate former
figures, we obtain that for a time of approximately 12 min, CA = 0.3448 M
and CB = 0.2202 M. We can use these results because, for a PFR, the design
equations would be the same, with the only difference being that instead of dt
we would have dt. In this way:

Inspection of the shape of E(t), in particular by comparing the curve for E(t) with
those shown for the ideal reactors, reveals that the real reactor does not have a
clear behavior tending toward any of the ideal continuous reactors. The selectiv￾ity of this real reactor is much higher than that for a PFR, while its conversion
is in the middle of the values for ideal reactors. The wording of the exercise does
not specify whether it is a tubular reactor or a stirred tank reactor. The evidence
presented indicates that it may be a tubular reactor with considerable mixing or
a stirred tank with poor mixing.
Problem 2.21 A restaurant intends to install a continuous electric fryer for the

of fresh oil and raw fries, with the outgoing oil and cooked fries being separated
by a conveyor belt equipped with perforations. The configuration is depicted in the
accompanying figure.

(b) Determine the average degree of browning for the continuous fryer, assuming
that the residence time distributions of oil and fries in the fryer are the same.
Solution to Problem 2.21
From the figure, we have:
C(t) = 0.05 5 ≤ t ≤ 0
The area of this square is 0.25 mol ⋅ min/l, and so:
E(t) = 0.05

In the ideal reactor:

We can also use the segregation model and the dispersion model to obtain the

Problem 2.23 A novel reactor has been installed to streamline the production of
B via a first-order irreversible reaction, 2A → B. Suspicions arise regarding the ideal
behavior of the reactor, prompting an investigation into its non-ideal characteristics
using a pulse marker. The concentrations of the marker observed at the reactor’s exit,
following its introduction at t = 0 at the reactor’s inlet, are outlined below:

Drawing upon these measurements, we can extrapolate the conversion anticipated

Problem 2.26 In an ideal CSTR equipped with three blades, B is generated from A

k = 9 min−1). The CSTR possesses a volume of 10 m3, and the feed rate is 5 m3/min,
with CA = 1 kmol/m3.
During the CSTR’s operation, the middle blades of the stirrer break off. Experi￾mental findings reveal that the tank no longer behaves as an ideal CSTR but can be
treated as two ideal CSTRs in series, each with a volume of 5 m3.

Solution to Problem 2.30
(a) First of all, let us calculate the value of E(t) = a not included in the graph. We
know that the total area of an E(t) curve should be unity, so from the plot:
1 = a ⋅ (3 − 2) + a ⋅ (8 − 5) = 4a → a = 0.25
Let us consider two different compartments. In this sense, the area under the first
square is A1 = 0.25 and A2 = 0.75. In a system with these two compartments in
parallel, the area would represent the ratio of flow rate flowing through each of the
compartments, i.e., Q1 = 0.25Q0 and Q2 = 0.75Q0. As we know that Q0 = 0.5 m3/min,
we find: Q1 = 0.125 and Q2 = 0.375 m3/min.
From the data in the plot, we can estimate the average residence time in both
systems and in the complete reactor:

(CA0) of 5 kmol/m3. The constant of the rate equation for the process is 1.5 min−1.
(a) To begin, let us calculate the concentration CAout assuming an ideal CSTR.
Upon examining the flow profile within the glass reactor, it becomes evident that
the reactor’s configuration can also be likened to that of two parallel PFRs, each
possessing the volumes as indicated (see figure).

(b) Assuming both PFRs are ideal, we need to determine the ratio Q1/Q0 in order to
achieve the same concentration CAout as that assumed for the ideal CSTR.
(c) Now, consider the scenario of a reaction with an order different from unity.
Please provide an explanation of your answer(s) regarding the ratio Q1/Q0 in
this case.

In the first one:
XA1 = 1 − exp(−kt1) = 1 − exp (

)
= 1 − exp (

And, in the second one:
XA2 = 1 − exp (

(
1 − Q1
1.5) (
1 − exp (

= 0.75
We can solve and find that Q1 = 1.05 m3/min, so Q1/Q0 = 0.7.

Problem 2.32 According to our calculations, a PFR would obtain 99.99% conver￾sion of a reagent in aqueous solution. However, the DTR shown in the figure was
obtained. If CA0 = 1000 mol/m3, calculate the concentration that can be obtained in
the reactor if the reaction is first-order.106 2 Chemical Reaction in Non-ideal Reactors

Solution to Problem 2.32
In a PFR, we obtain a 0.9999 conversion for the reactant. In the DTR, we can check
that the residence time for the vessel is tm = 10min = t and then:
XA = 1 − exp(−kt)
0.9999 = 1 − exp(−k ⋅ 10)
k = 0.921 min−1
In a dispersed flow reactor, we know that:

By trial and error: Bo = 0.017 22
And for a first-order reaction in the dispersed flow:

a = [1 + 4(10 ⋅ 0.921) ⋅ 0.017 22]
1∕2 = 1.27
1 − XA = … = 0.0004
So, the expected conversion is XA = 0.996.

Problem 2.33 The second-order aqueous phase reaction A +B → R+S is carried
out in a large tank reactor (V =3 m3) and with a feed mixture (CA0 =CB0); the conver￾sion of the reactants is 90%. Unfortunately, the agitation in the tank is quite defective,
and the tracer tests indicate that the reactor follows a model like the one schema￾tized in the figure, with 𝛼 = 0.3 and R = 0.5 (Vd is dead volume and Vm well-mixed

As we have 𝛼 = 0.3 and R = 0.5, tactual = 0.2 texpected, i.e., the residence time is much
smaller than that expected.

In the real reactor, the mass balance is:

Problem 2.34 In a tubular reactor, a first-order reaction is carried out, in which
k = 2 s−1. For a feed of 2 l/s, a conversion of 90% is expected to be obtained, but the
reactor does not work quite well, and a conversion of 75% is obtained. After a char￾acterization experiment, it is concluded that the reactor can be modeled as follows:
Reactor 1:

The fraction “a” is estimated to be 0.5. Calculate the fraction of flow that would

Solution to Problem 2.34
In the ideal reactor:
CA = CA0 ⋅ exp(−kt)
And equally:
XA = 1 − exp(−kt)Summary of Most Important Models 109
we obtain a conversion of 0.9, so:

And the volume is: V = 2.3 l, and so V1 = V2 = 1.15 l.

RCTA110 2 Chemical Reaction in Non-ideal Reactors
Solution to Problem 2.35
The reaction rate is:
−rA = k ⋅ CA ⋅ CB
In any moment, we have that:
CA = CA0 ⋅ (1 − XA)
CB = CB0 + CA0 ⋅
( −1
−(−1)
)
XA = CB0 − CA0 ⋅ XA = CA0
2 − CA0 ⋅ XA
= CA0 ⋅
(1
2 − XA
)
In a CSTR with flow rate Q and XA conversion at the exit:
Q ⋅ CA0 + rA ⋅ V = Q ⋅ CA
In this case:
Q ⋅ CA0 − k ⋅ CA0(1 − XA) ⋅ CA0 ⋅
(1
2 − XA
)
⋅ V = Q ⋅ CA0 ⋅ (1 − XA)
Dividing by (Q ⋅ CA0):
1 − k ⋅ (1 − XA) ⋅ CA0 ⋅
(1
2 − XA
)
⋅ V
Q = (1 − XA)
From this equation:
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ V
Q = XA
(1 − XA) ⋅
(1
2 − XA
)
Note that in this reactor, the conversion cannot be greater than 0.5 since we would
lack reagent “B.” Now, in the REAL reactor, with recirculation, the flow rate inside
the reactor is 2/3 ⋅ Q0, and the conversion at the outlet is:
X′
A ⋅ Q0 =
(2
3 ⋅ Q0
)
⋅ XA +
(Q0
3
)
⋅ 0
So, taking into account that X′
A = 0.7, we have:
0.7 =
(2
3
)
⋅ XA
And we obtain XA = 1.05, which indicates that either the recirculation flow or the
conversion is incorrect. The configuration that gives us the problem is not possible.
Assuming a conversion of X′
A = 0.3, we would have XA = 0.45, and:
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ V
Q = XA
(1 − XA) ⋅
(1
2 − XA
) = 16.36
As in the reactor, the flow is 2/3 of the total, and the volume is 30 m3:
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅ 30
2
3 ⋅ Q0
= 16.36Summary of Most Important Models 111
And so:
k ⋅ CA0
Q0
= 0.363
In the IDEAL reactor, it is also true that:
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅
VCSTR
QCSTR
= XA
(1 − XA) ⋅
(1

But now:
k ⋅ CA0 ⋅
VCSTR
Q0
= 0.3
(1 − 0.3) ⋅
(1
2 − 0.3) = 2.14
And:
0.363 ⋅ VCSTR = 2.14
Finally, oh surprise:
VCSTR = 5.89 m3
which is logically much smaller than the REAL reactor.
Problem 2.36 Researchers undertook experiments to investigate the residence

𝜎2 = 54.532

So the reactor is similar to a lot of CSTRs connected in series.
Note that the segregation model is hardly applicable to the situation, as the RTD
indicated that the mixing is quite important.
(c) Considering a temperature of 145 ∘C, the repetition of the former calculations
gives:
k = 2.16 min−1
XA (segregation model) = 0.855
XA (PFR) = 0.860
Now, a temperature of 155 ∘C gives:
k = 3.87 min−1
XA (segregation model) = 0.971
XA (PFR) = 0.97
As we can see, the conversion is very unsensitive both to the temperature and
the RTD being held in different situations. This can be the reason why the exper￾imental conversion is quite low compared to that expected.

Problem 2.38 In a CSTR, the reaction between organic oxide and calcium carbon￾ate (1 mol/l at the inlet) takes place:
R2O + CaCO3 → R2CO3 + CaO
It is known that the reaction is second-order or first-order with respect to each
reactant. The rate constant is k = 25 l/mol ⋅ min, and the average residence time is
10 min.
(a) What concentration of R2O in the reactor causes the CaCO3 conversion to be
0.9?Summary of Most Important Models 117
(b) If there are no excess reactants, what is the concentration of R2O at the inlet?
(c) If the reactor were PFR, under the same input conditions, what conversion
would be obtained?
Solution to Problem 2.38
Calling “A” to the carbonate and “B” to the oxide, we have that:
−rA = kCACB
k = 25 mol
l ⋅ min
t = 10 min
As the fluid is not compressible, with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry, the following is fulfilled
in any case:
CA = CA0(1 − XA)
CB = CB0 − CA0XA
(a) In the CSTR, a balance of “A” gives:
nA0 + rAV = nA
CA0 + rAt = CA
CA0 − kCACBt = CA
With the data XA = 0.9, we have that CA = 0.1 ⋅ CA0, and:
CA0 − k(0.1CA0)CBt = 0.1CA0
The value of CA0 is known (1 mol/l), giving: CB = 0.036 mol/l.
(b) We can write:
CB = CB0 − CA0XA
0.036 = CB0 − 1 ⋅ 0.9
So:
CB0 = 0.936 mol
l
(c) In a PFR, a mass balance of “A” gives:
dnA = rA ⋅ dV
CA0 ⋅ Q ⋅ dXA = −k(CA0(1 − XA))(CB0 − CA0XA)dV
That, rearranging:
∫
CA
CA0
dCA
CB0 − CA0 + CA
= −kt
Solving the integral and using the limits:
CA = CB0 ⋅ exp(−kt) + CA0 − CB0
CA = 0.065 mol

XA = 1 − CA
CA0

Problem 2.39 In a batch reactor, the dehydration of organic alcohols occurs at
room temperature, following the typical equation:
CH3 − CH2 − OH → CH2 = CH2 + H2 O

Problem 2.41 In a tubular reactor with a section of 0.1 m2, it is desired to obtain
two products with different conversions of a reactant A that follows the kinetics
−rA = kCA, with an estimated k value of 0.12 s−1. The reagent flow rate is 0.1 m3/s,
and conversion products of 0.5 and 0.9 are desired. Estimate the distance at which
the first product must be collected and the total length of the reactor, if:
(a) The reactor is ideal.
(b) The reactor behaves following the dispersed flow model, in a closed container,
and is characterized by a pulse tracer obtaining tm = 2 s and 𝜎2 = 3 s2.
Solution to Problem 2.41
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) In the PFR: XA = 1 − exp(−k ⋅ t)
For XA = 0.5 → t1 = 5.77 s → V1 = t1 ⋅ Q = 0.57 m3 → L1 = V1
S = 5.7 m
For XA = 0.9 → t2 = 19.18 s → V2 = t2 ⋅ Q = 1.92 m3→ L2 = V2
S = 19.2 m
(b) If the system were not ideal, following dispersed flow closed–closed container,
we have that:
( 𝜎
tm
)2
= 2 ⋅ Bo − 2 ⋅ Bo2 ⋅
[
1 − exp (
− 1
Bo
)]
So, using the data given in the pulse test, tm = 2 s and 𝜎2 = 3 s2, we found
that Bo = 1.02. This is a dimensionless number, valid for the specific reactor
being tested in any condition. Now, we know the kinetics and the conversion as
follows:
1 − XA =
4a ⋅ exp ( 1
2
)
(1 + a)2 ⋅ exp (a
2
)
− (1 − a)2 ⋅ exp (
−a
2
)
a = [1 + 4 ⋅ 0.12 ⋅ t]
1∕2
We should solve by iterations or use a graphical tool. In both cases, residence
times for the two needed conversion values should be calculated.Summary of Most Important Models 121
Using optimization method, in the spreadsheet we will assume a value of resi￾dence time for the first value of conversion. Then we will calculate the conver￾sion obtained by using previous equation, and a comparison of both values is
done, by defining an objective function:
(Objective function) = ∑(XAcalculated − XAdesired )
2
For optimizing the value of residence time, we can do a trial and error procedure,
observing the values of the objective function. Also, we can use the “Solver” tool
in Excel (and similar spreadsheet software) that allows us to define a function
to minimize by changing one or more values of assumed parameters.
In any way we can check that:
For XA = 0.5 → t1 = 7.42 s → V1 = t1 ⋅ Q = 0.742 m3 → L1 = V1
S = 7.42 m
For XA = 0.9 → t2 = 41.15 s → L2 = 41.15 m123

Being CX the tracer concentration after the recirculation, entering both Reactor 1
and Reactor 2. We can say that:

Problem 3.3 The curve representing the input to a CSTR has the equation:

C(t) = 0.06(10 − t) 5 ≤ t < 10}
Calculate the outlet concentration over time if the mean residence time in the
reactor is one second.
Solution to Problem 3.3
This problem can be solved in many ways. One of them is using the Laplace trans￾form for calculating the response. The input is in the Laplace space:
{ C(s) = 0.06∕s2 0 ≤ t < 5
C(s) = (0.6s − 0.06)∕s2 5 ≤ t < 10}
In the CSTR we have for a non-reacting species:

In the interval 0≤t ≤5:
t

where CX represents the tracer concentration after point X. At point X, we can do:
Q0C0 + RQ0C4 = (1 + R)Q0CXSummary of the Equations and Concepts 129
So:
CX = C0 + RC4
(1 + R) = C0 + RE4C3
(1 + R)
And, in point Y:
(1 + R)Q0C2 + (1 − bR)Q0C3 = Q0C5
With all these equations, we should operate until we obtain an expression just by
defining the parameters of the system and the Eglobal. For example:
C5 = (1 + R)C2 + (1 − bR)C3 = (1 + R)E2C1 + (1 − bR)E3C0
= (1 + R)E2E1CX + (1 − bR)E3C0
C5 = (1 + R)E2E1
C0 + RE4C3
(1 + R) + (1 − bR)E3C0
= E2E1(C0 + RE4E3C0) + (1 − bR)E3C0
So, finally:
Eglobal = E2E1(1 + RE4E3) + (1 − bR)E3

(1 − p)E1C0 + p(1 − 𝛾)E3C0

deficiencies in their behavior, so that they could be modeled with the following
scheme:
Reactor 1:
CSTR
V1 = a·V
Reactor 2:
PFR
V2 = b·V
Reactor 3:
PFR
V3 = c·V
Q0
p·Q0
(1–p–·γ)·Q0

(1–p)·Q0
Reactor 4: PFR
V4 = (1–a–b–c)·V
Taking into account the transfer function in the CSTR and RFP, find the transfer
function of the proposed reactor network.

E3 = C3
C0
E4 = C4
CX
where CX represents the tracer concentration after point X. At point X, we can do:
pQ0C3 + 𝛾Q0C2 = (p + 𝛾)Q0CX
So:
CX = pC3 + 𝛾C2
(p + 𝛾) = pE3C0 + 𝛾E2C1
(p + 𝛾) = pE3C0 + 𝛾E2E1C0
(p + 𝛾)
And, at point Y:
(1 − p − 𝛾)Q0C2 + (p + 𝛾)Q0C4 = Q0C5
And then:
(1 − p − 𝛾)Q0E1E2C0 + (p + 𝛾)Q0E4CX = Q0C5
With all these equations, we should operate until we obtain an expression just with
the parameters of the system and defining the Eglobal. For example:
C5 = (1 − p − 𝛾)E1E2C0 + (p + 𝛾)E4CX
C5 = (1 − p − 𝛾)E1E2C0 + (p + 𝛾)E4
p E3C0 + 𝛾E2E1C0
(p + 𝛾)
So, finally:
Eglobal = (1 − p − 𝛾)E1E2 + E4(p E3 + 𝛾E2E1)

Convolution and Deconvolution of Signals in Chemical
Reactor Engineering
Summary of Equations and Methods
In a chemical reactor:
Cout = E ⊗ Cin
For functions of a discrete variable “x” (i.e. arrays of numbers), the definition of
the convolution operation is:
C(u) = ∑∞
u=−∞
f(x) ⋅ g(u − x)
It is not possible to calculate the convolution of two given functions if both are
given at points with different Δx.
Convolution
Assume that f(x) is a vector of “n” values, i.e., f(x) = [f 1,f 2,f 3,…f n] and g(x) has “m”
values so that g(x) = [g1,g2,g3,…,gm].
As an example, if n =5 and m =4, for the convolution operation, the desired
result is:
C1 = f1 ⋅ g1
C2 = f2 ⋅ g1 + f1 ⋅ g2
C3 = f3 ⋅ g1 + f2 ⋅ g2 + f1 ⋅ g3
C4 = f4 ⋅ g1 + f3 ⋅ g2 + f2 ⋅ g3 + f1 ⋅ g4

Or:
C = A ⋅ g
Being A the “matrix convolution,” with values of f(x) in the form of columns. For
a general case, when vectors of n and m values are combined, the resulting matrix
convolution is a (n + m −1) × m matrix, and the resulting C is a vector of (n + m −1)
values:
C(n+m−1×1) = [A(n+m−1×m) ⋅ g(m×1)]
Let us call “v” the number of rows of the C vector, i.e., v =(n + m −1). Let us apply
these equations to the convolution of a residence time distribution (RTD) curve, E,
and the signal input to a reactor, Cin. As mentioned before, we will need to convolute
both signals, in such a way that:
Cout = E ⊗ Cin
If Cin has “m” values and E has “n” values, the convolution is given by:

This is:
Cout(v×1) = Cout(n+m−1×1) = [A(n+m−1×m) ⋅ Cin(m×1)]
To calculate the time vector associated with Cout, we would need the correspond￾ing times associated with Cin and E. In general, let us assume that the first and last
elements of Cin correspond to times t0,Cin , and tm,Cin , while the first and last elements
of the E vector are t0,E, and tn,E. The convolution can be done (as mentioned before),
only if time increments in both vectors (Δt) are equal, i.e.,
Δt = tm,Cin − t0,Cin
m − 1 = tn,E − t0,E
n − 1
t0,convolution = t0,Cin + t0,E (initial time is the sum of the initial times)
tv,convolution = tm,Cin + tn,E (final time is the sum of the final times)
Δtconvolution = tv,convolution − t0,convolution
m + n − 2
Applying former equations, we can also see that the following is true:
Δtconvolution = (m − 1) ⋅ Δt + (n − 1) ⋅ Δt
m + n − 2 =
(m + n − 2
m + n − 2
)
⋅ Δt = Δt
Deconvolution
This is a very common problem because the calculation of E from an impulse input
signal (Cin = Dirac delta function) or a step function is not always possible or easy.
Assuming the dimension of vectors is “m” for Cin and “v” for Cout (as used above),
we have that Cout = E ⊗ Cin and:
Cout(v×1) = [A(v×m) ⋅ Cin(m×1)]
Note that the dimensions of convolution matrix A are (v × m), from that, we will
calculate (n = v – m +1) values of the vector E curve. From this equation, it is not
possible to directly calculate matrix A. For the calculation of n values of vector E,
we have (n + m −1) equations, so it is an overdetermined system of equations. This
means that there are many solutions for the system, and we need to choose, in any
way, the best solution. In this way, for the resolution of the deconvolution of two
given signals (Cin and a Cout), it is necessary to pose an optimization by least squared
residuals of the components of matrix A.
For calculating the E curve, the easiest way to do the optimization is to minimize
an objective function (O.F.) in the form of the sum of squared residuals between the
Cout curve (known) and the product [A⋅Cin]:
O.F. = [Cout(v×1) − A(v×m) ⋅ Cin(m×1)]
2
For that purpose, an initial value of the vector E is taken, and the use of an opti￾mization method is necessary.144 4 Convolution and Deconvolution of Signals in Chemical Reactor Engineering
For the calculation of the corresponding time vector for E distribution (deconvo￾luted signal), we have:
t0,E = t0,Cout − t0,Cin (initial time of the convolution is the sum of the initial times)
tv,E = tv,Cout − tm,Cin (final time of the convolution is the sum of the final times)
Δtdeconvolution = tv,E − t0,E
v − 1 = Δt

Problem 4.1 In an experimental reactor, a tracer is injected with the following
distribution:
t (s) 0 1 2 3 4
C (mol/l) 0 8 4 6 0
In the reactor, the RTD is given by:
t (s) 2 3 4 5 6
E 0 0.05 0.50 0.35 0
Calculate the evolution of the output signal with time.
Solution to Problem 4.1
We must calculate both the concentration and the time vectors. The time vector is
easy to calculate. We have m =5 points and n =5 points, so the resulting vector will
have 9 points (m + n −1). The first value of time is (0+2) = 2 and the last one is
(6+4) = 10. The corresponding Δtconvolution is (10−2)/(m + n −2) = 8/8 = 1, so:
tconvolution (s) = [2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
To calculate the concentration:
Cconvolution1 = Cin1 ⋅ E1
Cconvolution2 = Cin2 ⋅ E1 + Cin1 ⋅ E2
Cconvolution3 = Cin3 ⋅ E1 + Cin2 ⋅ E2 + Cin1 ⋅ E3
Cconvolution4 = Cin4 ⋅ E1 + Cin3 ⋅ E2 + Cin2 ⋅ E3 + Cin1 ⋅ E4
Cconvolution5 = Cin5 ⋅ E1 + Cin4 ⋅ E2 + Cin3 ⋅ E3 + Cin2 ⋅ E4 + Cin1 ⋅ E5
Cconvolution6 = Cin5 ⋅ E2 + Cin4 ⋅ E3 + Cin3 ⋅ E4 + Cin2 ⋅ E5
Cconvolution7 = Cin5 ⋅ E3 + Cin4 ⋅ E4 + Cin3 ⋅ E5
Cconvolution8 = Cin5 ⋅ E4 + Cin5 ⋅ E5
Cconvolution9 = Cin5 ⋅ E5Summary of Equations and Methods 145
Tanking the values of Cin =tracer input and E =RTD of the reactor, we can easily
calculate:
Cconvolution1 = 0 ⋅ 0
Cconvolution2 = 8 ⋅ 0 + 0 ⋅ 0.05
Cconvolution3 = 4 ⋅ 0 + 8 ⋅ 0.05 + 0 ⋅ 0.5
Cconvolution4 = 6 ⋅ 0 + 4 ⋅ 0.05 + 8 ⋅ 0.5 + 0 ⋅ 0.35
Cconvolution5 = 0 ⋅ 0 + 6 ⋅ 0.05 + 4 ⋅ 0.5 + 8 ⋅ 0.35 + 0 ⋅ 0
Cconvolution6 = 0 ⋅ 0.05 + 6 ⋅ 0.5 + 4 ⋅ 0.35 + 8 ⋅ 0
Cconvolution7 = 0 ⋅ 0.5 + 6 ⋅ 0.35 + 4 ⋅ 0
Cconvolution8 = 0 ⋅ 0.35 + 6 ⋅ 0
Cconvolution9 = 0 ⋅ 0
And finally:
Cconvolution (mol/l) = [0 0 0.4 4.2 5.2 4.4 2.1 0 0]
Problem 4.2 In an experiment to determine the E(t) of a certain reactor, the tracer
is introduced into the reactor following the equationCin =t ⋅ exp(−t/2). The response
of the non-ideal tank reactor is given in the following table:
tout (min) 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Cout (mg/l) 0.9 1.8 2.1 5.2 3.6 4.5 1.7 0.8 0.7 0.5
Calculate the E(t) of the reactor, together with the time vector associated with
the E(t).
Solution to Problem 4.2
For doing this deconvolution, the easiest is to calculate discrete values of Cin and
then deconvolute. We can choose the number of points we use for the calculation
(with limits), and also the time values, but the time increment should be the same
as the Cout signal (i.e. one minute), and the Cin cannot be zero at all points. Another
restriction is that we will need enough data for Cin. We have v =10 points on the
convoluted curve (Cout). For example, if we use m =10 points to calculate Cin, as we
have v =10 values of Cout, we can only calculate n = v – m +1 = 1 point of the RTD.
If we use m =9 points in Cin, we will be able to calculate two values of E(t). Let us
choose to use m =5 points in Cin, so we will calculate six points in E(t). Choosing
t0,in =0, then:
tin (min) T 0 1 2 3 4
Cin (mg/l) t⋅exp(−t/2) 0 0.61 0.74 0.67 0.54146 4 Convolution and Deconvolution of Signals in Chemical Reactor Engineering
Following the reasoning presented before, the deconvoluted signal will have
(10−5+1) = 6 points. The time vector of these points is easy to calculate, as
tE,0 = tout,0 − tin,0 and the time increment is one minute, so:
tE (min) 4 5 6 7 8 9

As we can see, we have 6 unknowns and 10 equations, so the system is overde￾termined. An optimization is needed. This can be done by optimizing the objective
function:
O.F. = [Cout(v×1) − A(v×m) ⋅ Cin(m×1)]

Solution to Problem 4.3
We must calculate both the concentration and the time vectors. First, we must
choose a number of points in the plots that would make a good curve. For example,
we can choose m =5 (from the Cin curve) and n =4 (from the E curve), so we will
have v = m + n – 1 = 8 points in the calculated Cout. Hence:
tin 1 2 3 4 5
Cin 0 8 4 6 0
tE 6 7 8 9
E 0.05 0.5 0.3 0.1
Note that we should choose points with the same time interval in both curves. The
time vector is easy to calculate. The first value of time is (1+6) = 7, and the last one
is (5+9) = 14. The corresponding Δtconvolution is 1, so:

Problem 5.1 Acetic anhydride undergoes hydrolysis in a continuous stirred tank
reactor (CSTR) at a temperature of 40 ∘C. Initially, the reactor contains 0.57 m3 of an
aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.487 kmol/m3 of anhydride. The reactor
is rapidly heated to 350 K, and at that point, a feed solution with a concentration
of 0.985 kmol/m3 of anhydride is introduced into the reactor at a rate of 9.55 l/s.
Simultaneously, the product pump is activated, and the product is withdrawn from
the reactor at the same rate of 9.55 l/s. The reaction follows first-order kinetics with
a rate constant of 6.35⋅10−3 s−1.
(a) Perform an unsteady state balance and solve to obtain the transient behavior
during startup in terms of the concentrations of anhydride and acid in the
product stream.
(b) Determine the concentrations of anhydride and acid in the product stream after
120 seconds.
Solution to Problem 5.1
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
CSTR
Initially V = 0.57 m3
CAin = 0.487 kmol/m3
CA0 = 0.985 kmol/m3
Q0 = 9.55·10–3 m3/s
CA = ??
Q0 = 9.55·10–3 m3/s
The reaction is: A + H2O → B
In this problem, we have a CSTR working in a non-steady state. A mass balance
in the reactor would be:

equal or, in other cases, different, as in the present one. We can now simulate the

Problem 5.2 The mass transfer of substance A between solvent I and solvent II,
which will be considered totally immiscible, is being studied. It is further assumed
that the concentration of A is small enough that Fick’s second law can be used to
describe the diffusion in both regions. It is desired to solve the diffusion equations:

Problem 5.3 Perform a mass balance in a dispersed plug flow reactor (PFR) in
which a first-order reaction occurs. We will assume open and closed boundary
conditions at both ends and steady state regime. Apply the FDM and indicate the
equations that result in the calculation of the reactant concentration. Indicate the
stability conditions and how to consider the boundary conditions of this problem.
Solution to Problem 5.3
As pointed out previously, the mass balance in the PFR system can be expressed as:
nA + rA ⋅ dV = (nA + dnA)164 5 Partial Differential Equations in Chemical Reactor Engineering
The accumulation is zero because the problem works in a steady state.
But in this case:
Q ⋅ dCA ≠ dnA
As:
nA = Q ⋅ CA − De ⋅ S ⋅
dCA
dz
In the previous equation, two terms are present, the first one corresponding to
the convection (general movement of the flow) and the second one corresponding
to the diffusion by Fick’s law. Deriving and doing Q =(u⋅S), then:
dnA
dz = u ⋅ S ⋅
dCA
dz − De ⋅ S ⋅

And introducing the mole balance:

If we assume first-order kinetics: rA = −k ⋅ CA
And then:
De ⋅

dz − k ⋅ CA = 0
For a closed–closed system, boundary conditions are given by the Danckwerts
boundary conditions, so:
At z =0 → u ⋅ CA|
|z=0 − De ⋅ dCA
dz
|
|
|
|z=0
= u ⋅ CA0
At z = L → dCA
dz
|
|
|
|z=L

On the other hand, if the system is open:
At z =0 → CA|z = 0 = CA0
At z = L → dCA
dz
|
|
|
|z=L
= 0
As we can check, the balance equation is not dependent on time (steady state),
only on distance, but the derivative is second-order. In this situation, a change in
variables is needed. Let us name C′
A as a new variable:
C′
A = dCA

dz
The mass balance can be written as follows:
De ⋅

And the boundary conditions are, for a closed system:

|z=0 − De ⋅ C′
A
|
|
|z=0 = u ⋅ CA0
At z = L → C′
A
|
|
|z=L = 0
If the system were open:
At z =0 → CA|z = 0 = CA0
At z = L → C′

Problem 5.4 A reactor for cracking ethylbenzene (gas) behaves like a CSTR. It is
submerged in a bath of molten KCl salts in order to keep the external temperature
constant and equal to Text =770 ∘C. The evolution with time of the temperature in
the reactor wall can be calculated by solving the heat balance in a non-steady state,
which leads to the following expression:

where 𝜌 Cp is the product of the density of the wall and its heat capacity, k is its
thermal conductivity, T is the temperature of the wall, “t” the time, and “x” the
distance measured on the reactor wall of total width “L.”
It is intended to simulate the heating of the wall of this reactor, which starts from
a temperature T0 at t =0. The boundary conditions of the problem indicate that
outside (x =0), the temperature of the wall is the same as that of the molten salt,
while inside there is heat transfer, such that:

Solution to Problem 5.5
Let’s consider the interior point of the catalyst. Since all the values at time “t” are
assumed to be known, the spatial derivatives can be approximated using central
differences:
𝜕CA

Ai+1 − Ct

𝜕x2 = Ct

However, the first-order time derivative can be approximated by the forward dif￾ference:
𝜕CA
𝜕t = Ct+1
Ai − Ct

Δt
The resolution procedure consists of substituting these approximations in the
differential equation that governs the problem and solving explicitly for Ct+1
Ai . This
equation will contain, on the right side, only terms of Ct
A. The boundary conditions
will be used to calculate the limit points, and the problem can be solved forward in
time. As a consideration, we must point out that the error in the resolution of this
problem is proportional to (Δt + Δx2).
Applying the procedure to the previous example and using the indices “i” for the
position and “t” for the time:
Ct+1
Ai − Ct

Δt = DAB

With the above equation, we can obtain the values of the concentration in the
nodes in time (t + Δt) depending on the value at time “t”, which, together with
the initial and boundary conditions, allows us to solve the problem.
For the problem, a valid initial condition is:
t =0 → CA =0, for all points but the one contacting the other phase, where CA = CAs
These initial conditions can be written as:
t =0; CA =0; for ∀x ≠0
t =0; CA = CAS; for ∀x =0
The boundary conditions are:
At the interface (x =0): CA = CAs (known and constant value), ∀t
At the center of the particle (x = L), by symmetry: 𝜕CA
𝜕x = 0Summary 169
The boundary condition at the center of the catalyst, x = L, is similar to other
conditions used in chemical engineering and reflects the fact that, in the present
example, the derivative in the center is zero because it represents a minimum in the
concentration of the species reacting.
CA = CAs; for x = 0

Note that the derivative in the last point must be done in the form of a rear deriva￾tive, i.e., using the points “i −1” and “i”. If central or front differences are tried to be
used, the information in the point “N +1” is needed, and the system is not solvable.
We can also use a second-order approximation of the first derivative, and in this
case, for the last node (rear differences), we will have:

with N being the last point of the mesh. There are no stability conditions.
The issue at hand stems from having known conditions for the equations at
different points (0 and L), which makes numerical integration unfeasible without
additional steps. To resolve this, an optimization process is required to determine
the value of the derivative T′
at x =0 in a way that ensures the derivative at x = L

This equation relates the temperature at one point to the temperatures at the
two points preceding it. We must consider that the initial condition only gives
us a temperature (at x =0), so the problem cannot be solved without assuming a
derivative value in the first increment.
In the spreadsheet corresponding to this problem, it has been applied to a partic￾ular case, where we assume the following values:
Tamb (K) 298

k (W/m⋅K) 100
h (W/m2⋅K) 10
A (m2) 0.0001
P (m) 0.01

First, temperature in x =0 is fixed at T = T0. Then, a value of T′ at the first interval
is assumed, calculating the corresponding temperature in the second interval:
Ti=2 = Ti=1 + T′
i=1 ⋅ Δx
The remaining values of T are calculated using the equation relating Ti to Ti−1
and Ti−2. The derivative at the point x = L (i = N) is calculated and compared to the
expected value. An optimization of the initial value of the derivative is needed. In
this sense, a value of the derivative at x =0 is chosen, and the corresponding value
at x = L is calculated (T′
x=L). An objective function is defined based on the expected
value of derivative at this point:
O.F. =

Problem 5.8 In a one-meter-long reactor, a mixture of two substances, A and B,
is introduced through one of its ends. The concentration at the inlet end for each of
the substances is given by the following expression:
(Ci

ti
⋅ exp (

0.2 )
with tA = 0.2 and with tB = 0.4 and where t =time (min); Ci =concentration
(mol/m3) of species A or B.
In the reactor, dispersion of each of the two substances occurs, as well as a reaction
of order 1 with respect to each of the reactants (global order 2).
Determine the differential equations that describe the concentration of each
species with distance if the reactor operates in a non-steady state with the feed.
Specify the boundary conditions. Apply the method of finite differences to solve the
system and study its stability.

solving the ODEs starting from any initial condition. For example, starting from:

Let us consider the flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through the space
between two coaxial cylinders, as indicated in the figure. As the outer cylinder
rotates, the cylindrical fluid layers rub against the adjacent fluid layers, resulting in
heat production. In other words, mechanical energy is invariably degraded into heat
energy. The heat source per unit volume resulting from this “viscous dissipation”
will be designated by Sv. This magnitude depends on the local velocity gradient:
the faster a fluid layer moves relative to an adjacent one, the greater the heating
produced by viscous dissipation. The internal and external surfaces of the fluid are
maintained, respectively, at temperatures T = T0 and T = Tb. Obviously, T will be
an exclusive function of “r”.
If the thickness b of the slit is small compared to the radius R of the outer cylinder,
the problem can be approximately solved using the simplified system indicated in
the second part of the figure.
A heat energy balance applied to an envelope of thickness Δx, width W, and length
L in a steady state leads to:

A fluid flows through a circular tube, like the one shown in the figure, at a tem￾perature T0. Through the walls of the tube, there is a flow of heat whose density can
be considered constant. Determine the expression for the heat balance that allows
the calculation of the temperature profiles that will occur in this system in both the

The heat balance can be done in the circular ring shown in the figure, in such a
way that:
Input of energy through “r” by conduction qr]r ⋅ 2πrΔz
Output of energy through “r + Δr” by
conduction
qr]r + Δr ⋅ 2π(r + Δr)Δz
Input of energy through “z” by conduction qz]z ⋅ 2πrΔz

𝜌Cpvz(T −T0)]z ⋅ 2πrΔz
Output of energy through “z + Δz” due to
the flow of fluid
𝜌Cpvz(T −T0)]z + Δz ⋅ 2πrΔz
By equating the energy inputs and outputs, the energy balance applied to the cir￾cular ring is established, which will be:

Generally, the conduction of heat in the z-direction (the term containing the sec￾ond derivative) is small compared to the convective transmission (the term contain￾ing 𝜕T

cannot be done is the slow flow of substances that have high heat conductivity, such
as liquid metals. When the conductive term in the z-direction can be removed, it
finally remains:

Problem 5.17 A cylindrical tank capable of holding 28 m3 of liquid is provided
with a sufficiently powerful agitator to maintain the liquid at a uniform temperature
(see figure). Heat is transmitted to the liquid through a coil arranged in such a way
that the area available for heat transfer is proportional to the amount of liquid in the
tank. The heating coil consists of 10 turns of 125 cm in diameter, built with a tube of
2.5 cm in external diameter. The tank is fed continuously with 10 kg/min of water at200 5 Partial Differential Equations in Chemical Reactor Engineering
200 ∘C, starting with the tank empty at time t =0. Water vapor at 105 ∘C is introduced
inside the tube, and the global transmission coefficient of heat is 500 kcal/h⋅m2⋅K.

These types of problems are best solved by using symbols and entering the numer￾ical values at the end. For this, the following notation is used:
A0 =total area available for heat transfer
A(t) = heat transfer area at an instant
V0 =volume of liquid in the full tank
V(t) = volume of liquid in the tank at an instant
T =temperature of the liquid at an instant
T1 =temperature of the liquid at the inlet
Ts =temperature of the water vapor
U0 =overall heat transfer coefficient
t =time elapsed from the moment when water is turned on
Q =flow velocity of the water entering the tank
𝜌 =density of the liquidSummary 201
For the problem statement, the following assumptions are made:
* The temperature of the steam in the coil is constant.
* The density and specific heat of water do not vary much with temperature.
* Since the fluid is approximately incompressible, Cp = Cv.
* The stirrer keeps the temperature even throughout the mass.
* The heat transmission coefficient is independent of position and time.
* The walls of the tank are adiabatic.
The fluid contained in the tank is taken as the system. For the system we are
considering:
𝜌Cp
d
dt
V(T − T1) = U0A (Ts − T)
The area and volume in an instant are:
V(t) = Qt∕𝜌
A(t) = QtA0∕(𝜌V0)

Problem 5.18 It is desired to derive an equation for the speed at which a liquid
A evaporates within a vapor B in a tube of infinite length (see figure). The liquid
level is maintained at all times at position z =0. The entire system is at constant
temperature and pressure, and vapors A and B are assumed to form an ideal gas
mixture; therefore, the molar density c is constant throughout the gas phase. Finally,
it is assumed that B is insoluble in A.
In the system, DAB =10−4 m2/s, and the equilibrium molar fraction of A is
XA0 =0.1. Let us simulate the system for ztotal =0.3 m.

that NB0 =0. For the same position, the flux density of A is obtained:

Problem 5.19 Repeat Problem 5.7, but consider a non-steady state approximation.
In the non-steady regime, the fin is started at room temperature (Tamb), and there is
a temperature increase inside the reactor up to T0. The energy balance in the system206 5 Partial Differential Equations in Chemical Reactor Engineering
takes into account the heat transmitted by conduction and lost by convection to the
medium. This balance is given by:
Heat input = (qx ⋅ A)x
Heat exit = (qx ⋅ A)x+dx + qconv ⋅ ΔS
Heat accumulation = A ⋅ 𝜌Cp ⋅ dT
dt
With:
qx = −k ⋅ dT
dx (conduction of heat within the fin)
qconv = h(T −T∞) (heat loss by convection on the surface of the fin).
This gives:
k ⋅ A ⋅ d2
T
dx2 − h ⋅ P ⋅ (T − Tamb) = 𝜌Cp ⋅ A ⋅ dT
dt
where Tamb is the temperature of the fluid surrounding the reactor, “A” is the cross
section, “S” is the surface area of the fin, and “P” is its perimeter.
The boundary conditions of this problem generally consider that at one end the
temperature is constant, and the heat loss that reaches the end of the fin (of length
“L”) is zero, so:
{T = T0 in x = 0
−k ⋅ A ⋅ dT
dx = 0 in x = L
Applying the finite difference method, indicate the equations that result in the
calculation of the temperature along the fin. Indicates the stability conditions and
how to take into account the boundary conditions of this problem.

Problem 5.20 A reactive spherical particle of diameter D =0.1 m with a tempera￾ture (T0) of 90 ∘C, initially equal in all its points, is placed in a reactor maintained at
20 ∘C (Tr).
(a) Performing a global analysis, that is, assuming that all points on the sphere are

(b) Performing a local analysis, that is, if it is not accepted that the temperature of

For a first-order kinetics: (−rA)without diffusion effects = k ⋅ CAs with concentration cor￾responding to the surface. In this case: (−rA) = k ⋅ CAs ⋅ 𝜂.
In previous equations, L is the generalized length:

usually m/s. In this way, units of k′′′ should be m3

way that “m” is in units of inverse of length and “mL” is dimensionless.

Combination of Resistances
In the general case, all steps in the chemical reaction process can affect the reac￾tion rate, so the flow of reactant through the external layer could be expressed using
(kmol/s⋅m2):
(−rA) = − gA
Sext
= kC ⋅ (CAg − CAs)
In the common case, CAs does not equal zero. At the same time, the diffusion
through the pores and chemical reaction rate are given by:
(−rA) = kCAs𝜂
Obviously, there is no accumulation of reactant species A on the external surface,
so these two rates must be equal, so:
(−rA) = kC ⋅ (CAg − CAs) = kCAs𝜂
Note that the previous equality is absolutely always true, regardless of the most
important resistance to the process. If one of the resistances is very small, for
example, when kC is very large, the difference (CAg −CAs) will be very small so
that the concentration profiles in the film will be very small. From the previous
equation, doing the combination of resistances, we get:
(−rA) =

Problem 6.1 The reaction A +B → products takes place in an isothermal,
constant-density fluid in a continuous fluidized bed reactor with a well-mixed solid
catalyst. The rate law for the reaction is as follows:
−rA = k CA CB (mol∕kg − cat∕s)
where the reaction mechanism is unknown. Two catalyst varieties, Catalyst 1 and
Catalyst 2, are available, with identical physical and chemical properties except
that Catalyst 2 has double the density of active sites compared to Catalyst 1.
Steady-state data from the experiments are provided:
W (kg) Q0 (l/s) CA0 (mol/l) CB0 (mol/l) XA
Catalyst 1 150 100 0.10 0.10 0.450
Catalyst 2 100 200 0.15 0.20 0.667
(a) Determine the apparent rate constants k for each run, using appropriate units.
(b) Based on your answer to part (a) and knowledge of the two catalysts, propose a
plausible mechanism for how the active sites of the catalyst facilitate the reac￾tion. If you cannot fully answer part (a), explain how the answer to part (a) would
address this question.
Solution to Problem 6.1
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) In a fluidized bed, the solid phase behaves as a CSTR, and the fluid phase has
a particular bubble behavior that is between a plug flow and a perfectly mixed220 6 Reaction Rate in Catalytic Processes
flow. Usually, one of these two extremes is assumed for the gas phase. Let us
assume CSTR for both the solid and gas. A mass balance in the gas phase is:
nA0 − nA = (−k′
CACB) ⋅ W
With the kinetic constant k
′
expressed in the units of mass of catalyst. From this:
Q0CA0 − Q0CA0(1 − XA) = (−k′
CA0(1 − XA)(CB0 − CA0XA)) ⋅ W
Solving for the constant:
Q0CA0XA
(CA0(1 − XA)(CB0 − CA0XA)) ⋅ W = k′
For both catalysts:
Catalyst 1: k
′
=9.917 l2/mol⋅kg⋅s
Catalyst 2: k
′
=40.080 l2/mol⋅kg⋅s
(b) The difference between both constants could be due to the chemical reaction
step: Catalyst 2 has double the number of active sites, but the k
′
value is almost
four times that of Catalyst 1. This could indicate that chemical reaction is the
controlling step. External diffusion (from the gas to the catalyst surface) is prob￾ably not affecting the reaction.
Problem 6.2 The first-order reaction A → products is conducted in an isothermal
liquid using a solid catalyst in a packed-bed, tubular reactor. The fluid flow past
each particle is in the turbulent regime, characterized by a Reynolds number (Re) of
104. Steady-state experiments are performed with different average particle diame￾ters (dp) and the following data are obtained:
dp (cm) W (kg) Q0 (l/s) XA
0.10 100 100 0.92
0.15 80 100 0.73
(a) Based on the provided data, assess the apparent influence of intraparticle diffu￾sion resistance on the observed kinetics.
(b) Is it necessary to consider the impact of external mass transfer resistance?
Provide a quantitative explanation.
Solution to Problem 6.2
(a) We will calculate reaction rate in each run based on the weight of the catalyst.

For both cases, we found (−r′

(−r′
A)2
= 0.92CA0
0.9125CA0
= 1.008
As we see, there are not many differences between these two cases, so probably
the internal diffusion is not interfering with the reaction rate.
(b) In the turbulent regime (Re>4⋅103), mass transfer in the film is usually very fast
and is not necessary to be considered in the calculation of the reaction rate.
Problem 6.3 The gas-phase reaction A → products is conducted at a constant tem￾perature in a well-mixed, constant-volume batch reactor containing a solid catalyst.
The reactor has a fluid volume of V =10 l and a catalyst weight of W =5 kg, with a
density of 2.0 kg/l. The catalyst particles have a slab geometry, with a mean thickness
of 0.4 cm (l = 0.2 cm). For the encountered concentrations of A, the reaction follows
zero-order kinetics.
It can be demonstrated that the slab geometry with zero-order kinetics is unique
in the following manner: as the Thiele modulus (mL) increases, the effectiveness
factor transitions directly from 1 to 1/mL, without an intermediate region of pore
diffusion resistance.
The concentration of A is measured at 2-minute intervals, resulting in the follow￾ing data:

(b) Estimate the value of De, the effective diffusion coefficient of A, in cm2/s.

2Summary of Equations for the Catalytic Reactor Design 223
It is clear that for mL<1, previous equation yields C >0 at X =0, and the effec￾tiveness factor, defined as the ratio of observed rate to intrinsic rate, is equal
to 1 because everywhere in the catalyst the observed rate is k
′′′ , unaffected by
reactant concentration, which is diminishing yet remaining positive toward the
center. This trend would hold true until mL = 1, when the reactant concentra￾tion becomes zero at the center. In this sense, this equation holds as long as the
concentration does not become zero in the slab. In the case that C =0 before
reaching the center of the particle, what corresponds to the case that mL>1.
As we observe in the calculation in (a), the apparent kinetic constant (k′
ap = k′
⋅𝜂)
changes with time, in such a way that we can estimate the effectiveness factor
as the ratio k′ (at time t)/k′ (at time zero). The values are shown:

As we can check, k′ equals 0.002 mol/kg/min. Multiplying by the density of the
solid catalyst:
k′′′ = 0.002 mol
kg ⋅ min ⋅ 2 ⋅ 10−3 kg
cm3 = 4 ⋅ 10−6 mol

From these data, we can calculate the diffusivity bearing in mind 𝜂 =1/mL. From
the data at times between 8 and 12, we have that:

Problem 6.4 At a point inside a packed-bed reactor, the partial pressures of A

In different books (e.g. Levenspiel (1999)), we can find the relation between
effective diffusivity (De) and Knudsen diffusivity (DKA), as well as the equation to

Problem 6.5 A cylindrical catalytic converter measures 1/8 in. in diameter, 1/4 in.
in length, and weighs 0.0551 g. It has a surface area of 12.9 m2, and its average pore
radius is 32 Å. Estimate the effective diffusivity, in cm2/s, at 250 ∘C for a component
whose molecular weight is 78.
Solution to Problem 6.5
To calculate the effective diffusivity, one must first know which mechanism is
the predominant. In this case, where there is a pore size of 3.2 nm (between 2
and 100 nm), the Knudsen diffusivity will predominate. Therefore, the effective
diffusivity of the component whose molecular weight is 78 can be calculated as:
De = 𝜀DK∕𝜏
where:
𝜀 is the porosity of the catalyst
DK is the Knudsen diffusivity
𝜏 is the tortuosity of the pore
Since there are no values to calculate the tortuosity, a good approximation is to
assume that 𝜏 =1/𝜀 so that the expression for De becomes:
De = 𝜀2DK
The porosity of the catalyst is calculated assuming that the pores are cylindrical,
we have:
r =
( 2𝜀
𝜌s ⋅ SS
)226 6 Reaction Rate in Catalytic Processes
where r is the average pore radius, 𝜀 is the porosity of the catalyst, 𝜌s is the bulk
density of the catalyst (mass of solid/total volume including pores), and SS is the
internal specific surface.

On the other hand, the Knudsen diffusivity can be calculated as:

where K is a constant that is 9.7⋅10−5, r is the average pore radius in angstroms, T is
the temperature in K, and MA is the molecular weight of the compound diffusing

Problem 6.6 A first-order heterogeneous irreversible reaction takes place within
a spherical granule of catalyst that is uniformly impregnated with platinum:
A → B. For a position just midway along the radius of the granule (r =0.5R), the
concentration of the reactant is equal to one-tenth of its concentration on the outer
surface of the catalyst. The concentration of A at the outer surface of the catalyst is
0.001 M. The particle diameter is 0.002 cm, and the effective diffusion coefficient is
0.1 cm2/s.
(a) What is the concentration of A at a distance of 0.0003 cm from the outer surface
of the catalyst?
(b) If the effectiveness factor is desired to be equal to or greater than 0.8, to what
size should the diameter of the catalyst be reduced?

We can check that for 𝜂 >0.8 we obtain mL<1.25 and so L <1.39⋅10−4 cm, and
this corresponds to R <4.17⋅10−4 cm.
Problem 6.7 A tubular reactor is completely covered inside by a film of a porous
catalyst with a thickness of 1 mm. Its thickness can be considered insignificant in
relation to the radius of the reactor. The density of the catalytic layer is 1.3 g/cm3,
and its effective diffusivity is 0.006 cm2/s. At a point inside this reactor, we have
0.015 for the mole fraction of A at 1.1 atm and 250 ∘C. At the operating condi￾tions: (kCa) = 0.023 l/s⋅gcat. The catalytic intrinsic rate for the overall reaction

Note that the flow of reactants “A” and “B” occurs in the opposite direction to

So, we can calculate k′

transfer coefficients, with the three equations, we can find the desired concen￾trations. This can be done by numerical methods preferably. Once we have the
values of the concentrations at the surface, we can simply calculate r1 and r2.
(b) Given that: CAS = 0.0051 M, CBS = 0.0063 M, CCS = 0.0047 M, and
CDS = 0.00050 M;

Problem 6.12 A series of experiments were performed using various sizes of
crushed catalysts to determine the importance of pore diffusion. The reaction may
be assumed to be first-order and irreversible. The surface concentration of reactant
was 2 × 10−4 mol/cm3.
Data:
Diameter of sphere (cm): 0.25 0.075 0.025 0.0075
r observed (mol/h cm3): 0.22 0.70 1.60 2.40
(a) Determine the “true” rate constant k and the effective diffusivity De from the
above data.
(b) Predict the effectiveness factor and the expected rate of reaction for a commercial
cylindrical catalyst pellet if dimensions are 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm.
Solution to Problem 6.12
(a) In order to find the rate constant, we need to find the efficiency factor. It can
initially be assumed that for the smallest diameter of the spheres, there is no
resistance to diffusion in the pores, so 𝜂 =1. The assumption that is made can be
verified with the Thiele module, since if it is less than 0.4, the internal diffusion
is considered negligible. You have to:

The Thiele modulus is used to calculate the effective diffusivity. Values of De
have to be assumed until the values of 𝜂 match. We calculate the 𝜂 with the data
in the table.

When obtaining a value of mL<0.4 for the smallest particle, the initial assump￾tion is considered valid.

As diffusion control, mL>4 is required, considering the diffusion in the impor￾tant pores. So, the following is approximated:

obs =0.090 mol/gcat⋅h
For dp =0.3 cm, r′
obs =0.162 mol/gcat⋅h
In both cases, strong diffusional limitations were observed. Determine the true

So, the internal diffusion is not very important in the case where the particle diam￾eter is 0.1 cm.
Problem 6.14 A second-order gas-phase reaction, A → R, occurs in a catalyst pel￾let and has a rate coefficient k =3.86 m3/kmol⋅s. The reactant pressure is 1 bar, the
temperature is 600 K, the molecular diffusivity is DA =0.10 cm2/s, and the reactant
molecular weight is 60 g/mol. The catalyst pellets have the following properties:
Radius of sphere R =9 mm
Pellet density = 12 g/cm3
Internal surface area = 100 m2/g
Internal void fraction = 0.60
(a) Estimate the effective diffusivity.
(b) Determine if there may be pore diffusion limitations and what might be done to
eliminate them, if present.

And then:

mL = 0.9133
We can conclude that some limitations are present, but the effectiveness factor
is quite close to unity. If we want to eliminate the possible effects and increase
reaction rate, we can increase the pressure (increasingCAs), decrease the temper￾ature (also increasingCAs), and, obviously, decrease the diameter of the particles.
Problem 6.15 The production rate of a heterogeneously catalyzed, first-order
reaction in a 0.75 cm diameter spherical pellet is 3.25 × 10−3 mol/cm3⋅s when the
catalyst is exposed to pure, gaseous A at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of
525 K. This reaction’s activation energy is E =18.600 cal/mol. Further, the effective
diffusivity of A in the pellet is De =0.009 cm2/s at 525 K and that diffusion is in the238 6 Reaction Rate in Catalytic Processes
regime of Knudsen flow. The bulk fluid and the external surface concentrations
can be assumed to be the same. Find the production rate if the catalyst is changed
to a cylindrical pellet that is 0.5 cm in diameter and 1.0 cm in length, and the
temperature is increased to 600 K.

Problem 6.17 The heterogeneously catalyzed first-order surface reaction A → P is
being studied in an ideal plug flow reactor (PFR) with an empty volume of 250 ml.
The reactor has been completely filled with 200 g of porous, spherical catalyst. The
catalyst data are as follows:
Internal surface area: 200 m2/g
Apparent density of a catalyst particle: 1600 kg/m3
Porosity of the catalyst bed: 0.5
Diameter of a catalyst particle: 4 mm
Effective diffusion coefficient in catalyst particle: 0.3 × 10−11 m2/s
Kinetics: (−rA) = kCA, with k = k0⋅exp(−E/RgT), and T in K.
The reactor is fed with a stream of pure A at a flow rate of Q0 =500 ml/min and
an initial concentration of CA0 =0.01 mol/l. In the first experiment, the temperature
in the reactor was 400 K, and a degree of conversion of 0.6321 was achieved. In the
second experiment, the temperature is 500 K, and a degree of conversion of 0.8647
is achieved.
Your task is to determine the value of E/Rg for the following two extremes:
(a) In both experiments, the concentration of A in the porous catalyst hardly
depends on the distance to the external surface of the particle.
(b) In both experiments, the concentration of A in the porous catalyst strongly
depends on the distance to the external surface of the particle.
Assume that the densities of A, P, and their mixtures, as well as the diffusion
coefficient, are independent of temperature and composition. Additionally, neglect
concentration gradients in the film surrounding the catalyst particles.242 6 Reaction Rate in Catalytic Processes

Problem 6.19 In a fixed-bed reactor, the oxidation reaction of SO2 to SO3 with air
has been studied. The purpose of the study is to determine if the effect of external
mass transfer is significant under operating conditions. The catalyst consists of
0.3 cm diameter spherical Pt/Al2O3 particles, with the Pt deposited only on its
outer surface. The specific external area of the particles is 1.05 m2/kg, and the
void fraction of the bed is 0.43. The pressure in the reactor is 790 mmHg, and the
gases circulate with a velocity of 0.41 m/s. The temperature of the pellets is 480 ∘C,Summary of Equations for the Catalytic Reactor Design 245
and the feed stream contains 6.42% SO2 and 93.58% air (molar percent). Using the
correlation:
jD = 0.725
(Re)0.41 − 0.15
Estimate the mass transfer coefficient between the fluid and the surface of the
solid and the difference in partial pressure found in the film.
Data: Assume that the properties of the mixture are those of air. For air, at 480 ∘C,
we have:
Viscosity = 3.72⋅10−5 kg/m⋅s
Average molecular weight = 28.9 g/mol
SO2 diffusivity in air = 6.3 10−5 m2/s
SO3 diffusivity in air = 5.6 10−5 m2/s
Diffusivity of O2 in N2 =9.6 10−5 m2/s

catalyst is 800 m2/g and its density is 1220 g/cm3. The reactor will be a fixed bed,
and the catalyst will be arranged so that it occupies 0.3 m3 of catalyst/m3 bed. The
diffusivities of A and B are, respectively, 4⋅10−4 and 8⋅10−3 m2/s. At the entrance to
the bed, CA =100 mol/m3 and CB =10 mol/m3. Calculate:
(a) The efficiency factor for “A”
(b) The efficiency factor for “B”
(c) The reaction rate.
Data: Consider that the external diffusion step is very fast.
Solution to Problem 6.20
(a) and (b) The chemical step is represented by:
(−rA) = kCACB
To calculate the effectiveness factors, we need to know the L =generalized

And then L =1/0.916 = 1.024 m.
When working with Thiele modulus, the reaction rate should be nth order with
respect to the reactant being considered, so for the reactant “A,” the kinetic law
should be expressed as:
(−rA) = (kCB)CA𝜂A = kpsACA𝜂A
where kpsA represents a pseudo-first-order rate constant. Using the Thiele mod￾ulus:

Problem 6.21 The elimination of SO2 by reduction is a significant process in
industrial systems. It has been observed that the reaction follows first-order kinetics,
given as r = k⋅CSO2
, using a 5% V2O5/TiO2 catalyst. At a temperature of 500 K, the
kinetic constant (k) is determined to be 0.566 cm3/gcat⋅s, and the activation energy
is found to be 110 kJ/mol.
Now, we need to calculate the effectiveness factor and reaction rate at the inlet of a
commercial unit that contains an extruded cellular monolith made of 5% V2O5/TiO2.
This monolith has a channel wall thickness of 1.35 mm and an open frontal area
of 64%. We will consider typical commercial operating inlet conditions of 400 ppm
of SO2, 350 ∘C, and 1 atm. For our calculations, we can assume that the catalyst in
the square monolith walls can be treated as a flat plate. Furthermore, we will neglect
the films mass transfer resistance.
Additional data provided include the catalyst density of 1.48 g/cm3 and an effective
diffusion coefficient (De) of 0.07 cm2/s.

Volume = πR2 ⋅ Length

Problem 6.24 The cumene cracking reaction has been extensively researched by
various investigators due to its clean nature and its utility in comparing the activ￾ities of different cracking catalysts. Integral flow reactors have been employed to
gather data on this reaction. In such reactors, the conversion variation with reac￾tor space time remains relatively unaffected by changes in the form of the reaction
rate expression, particularly at high degrees of conversion that are far from equilib￾rium. Therefore, it is common to report data for these systems using a simplified
first-order reaction rate constant, assuming negligible volume changes during the
reaction. A commonly used expression to calculate this constant is:
−nA0XA = −k′
CA0(1 − XA)𝜂Wcat
nA0XA
CA0(1 − XA)𝜂Wcat
= k′
where Wcat is the weight of catalyst employed and the reaction rate constant is
expressed per unit weight of catalyst. If data published are expressed in these terms,
the apparent rate constant at 510 ∘C is approximately 0.716 cm3/gcatalyst⋅s. If the
catalyst employed in this study has the properties enumerated below, determine
the effectiveness factor for the catalyst. The value of the combined diffusivity can
be estimated at 6.19⋅10−3 cm2/s.

Problem 7.2 A reaction is being conducted in a continuous, well-mixed flu￾idized bed reactor with a catalyst load of 10 kg. The feed stream, which has a
constant density, contains 1.0 M reactant (A) and is supplied at a rate of 0.10 l/s.
Under these operating conditions, the concentration of A leaving the reactor at
steady state is measured to be 0.20 M, corresponding to an 80% conversion.
The catalyst particles in the reactor are well characterized and have a density of
2.0 kg/l. The effective diffusion coefficient of A within the catalyst particles is deter￾mined to be 1⋅10−6 cm2/s, and the mean Vp/Ap ratio is 0.015 cm.
Note: The reaction order (n) is uncertain, but you are confident that it falls between
0 and 2.7 Catalytic Reactor Design 255
(a) Determine whether the reaction is operating with minimal, intermediate, or
strong pore diffusion resistance.
When the flow rate is increased to 0.25 l/s, the steady-state concentration of A
in the exit stream is found to be 0.33 M, corresponding to a 67% conversion.
(b) Determine the rate law for the reaction in the form of −rA = kCn
A (specify n
and k). This rate law represents the behavior that would be observed if there
were no pore diffusion resistance.

Problem 7.3 A small reactor that can be considered “differential” and contains
eight granules of a spherical catalyst of 0.32 cm in diameter, each granule weighs
approximately 0.020 g. The reactor is 1 cm long and has an internal diameter of
0.58 cm. At a given total temperature and pressure, the concentrations of A at the
inlet and outlet are 0.0325 and 0.0308 mol/l, respectively, while the volumetric flow
rate of the feed is 250 cm3/s. The reaction is first-order and occurs in the gas phase.
The porosity of the catalyst particle is 0.35, the tortuosity of its pores is 5, and the
combined diffusivity of A at operating conditions is 0.022 cm2/s.256 7 Catalytic Reactor Design
Calculate the intrinsic rate constant for the catalytic consumption of A if there are
no temperature profiles within the catalyst. In addition, consider that the effects of
changing the number of moles are negligible and that there is no external resistance
to mass transfer because the rate of linearity is high in the packed bed.

Problem 7.4 The process of cracking cumene into benzene and propylene took
place in a fixed bed of zeolite particles under atmospheric pressure and at a temper￾ature of 262 ∘C. Nitrogen was present in large excess. At a specific location within
the reactor, where the partial pressure of cumene was measured to be 0.0689 atm, an
observed reaction rate of 0.153 kmol/kgcat⋅h was recorded.7 Catalytic Reactor Design 257
We need to demonstrate that, given these operating conditions, the partial pressure
drop and temperature drop across the external film surrounding the particles can be
considered negligible.

Solution to Problem 7.4
External temperature gradient between the medium and the particle surface occurs
when there is a temperature difference between the catalyst surface and the external
fluid (Conesa and Font Montesinos 2002). The heat transferred to the fluid must be
equal to that generated at the catalyst surface:
Heat transferred = h ⋅ Scat ⋅ (Tg − Ts)
Heat generated = (−rA) ⋅ ΔHr ⋅ Vcat
where heat is given in J/s, (−rA) in kmol A/s m3 cat, (ΔHr) is the enthalpy of reaction
in J/kmol, Vcat is the volume of the catalyst pellets, and Scat is the outer surface of the
pellet. Ts is the temperature of the surface of the particle, Tg is the temperature of
the fluid surrounding the particle, and h is the individual heat transport coefficient
(J/s m2 ∘C). Equating these two expressions, we can arrive at:
(Tg − Ts) = (−rA) ⋅ ΔHr ⋅ Vcat
h ⋅ Scat
= (−rA) ⋅ ΔHr ⋅ L
h
where L is the characteristic length.
The value of h can be calculated in some cases by introducing the parameter jH:
jH =

(Pr)

where (u⋅𝜌) is the mass flow rate, Pr is the Prandt number (Pr = Cp𝜇/Kterm), Cp is
the specific heat of the fluid, and Kterm is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.
In different books (e.g. Conesa and Font Montesinos (2002); Levenspiel (1999)).
We can find correlations of this parameter with Reynolds number. In the present
case, Re = 0.052 and jH =0.052. With this, the value of “h” (heat transfer coefficient)
can be estimated.258 7 Catalytic Reactor Design

We can check that the maximum conversion that can be obtained in this reactor
is 0.36. In that situation, a longer reactor will produce a lower conversion due to
the chemical equilibrium among the species.
Taking XA =0.36, the amount of catalyst needed is 3.047 kg. The length of the
reactor can be calculated using:

Using the properties of the bed, the total length is 10.6 m. It is not possible to
reach a conversion higher than 0.36.
(b) Suppose the reaction is carried out under the same conditions in a multitubular
reactor. The tubes length is 3 m. The total feed per tube is 4 kmol/h. An annual
production of 20 000 metric tons of product is required. The molecular weight
of the product is 44. One year on stream is equivalent to 8000 hours. Determine
the number of tubes required to meet the production.

Problem 7.6 Let us suppose that we are setting out front first principles to inves￾tigate the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, which is a well-established process for
manufacturing styrene:
C6 H5 ⋅ CH2 ⋅ CH3 ←−→ C6H5 ⋅ CH = CH2 + H2
There is available a catalyst that will give a suitable rate of reaction at
560 ∘C. At this temperature, the equilibrium constant for the reaction above is
KP =100 mbar = 104 N/m2.7 Catalytic Reactor Design 261
(a) If a feed of pure ethylbenzene is used at 1 bar pressure, determine the fractional
conversion at equilibrium.
(b) If the feed to the process consists of ethylbenzene diluted with steam in the ratio
15 mol steam: 1 mol ethylbenzene, determine the new fractional conversion at
equilibrium.
Solution to Problem 7.6
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) P (bar) = 1 pressure at which the reaction occurs, in bar.
P (Pa) = 100 000 pressure at which the reaction occurs, in Pa.
Subscript EB will be used to refer to ethylbenzene, W to refer to water vapor, S
to refer to styrene, and H to refer to hydrogen.
No inlet flow data are given, so a calculation basis is assumed.
nEB0 (mol∕s) = 100
nW0 (mol∕s) = 0
nS0 (mol∕s) = 0
nH0 (mol∕s) = 0
n0 = nEB0 + nW0 + nS0 + nH0
n0 (mol∕s) = 100
The moles of each component at the outlet of the reactor are calculated as fol￾lows:
nEB = nEB0(1 − XEB)
nW = nW0
nS = nS0 + nEB0XEB
nH = nH0 + nEB0XEB
The total moles that will exist once equilibrium occurs are therefore:
n = nEB + nW + nS + nH = nEB0 − nEB0XEB + nW0 + nS0 + nEB0XEB + nH0 + nEB0XEB
n = n0 + nEB0XEB
So the mole fractions of each component at equilibrium will be
yEB = nEB∕n = (nEB0(1 − XEB))∕(n0 + nEB0XEB)
yW = nW∕n = nW0∕(n0 + nEB0XEB)
yS = nS∕n = (nS0 + nEB0XEB)∕(n0 + nEB0XEB)
yH = nH∕n = (nH0 + nEB0XEB)∕(n0 + nEB0XEB)262 7 Catalytic Reactor Design
The partial pressures can be calculated using Dalton’s law as follows:
PEB = PyEB
PW = PyW
PS = PyS
PH = PyH
Then, in equilibrium, it holds that:
KP = PS,outPH,out∕PEB,out
Therefore, substituting in the values of the partial pressures and clearing the
value of XEB, it is obtained that:
(nEB02 ⋅ (KP + P)) ⋅ XEB2 + (nEB0 ⋅ (KP ⋅ (n0 − nEB0) + P ⋅ (nS0 + nH0))) ⋅ XEB
+ (P ⋅ nS0 ⋅ nH0 − KP ⋅ nEB0 ⋅ n0) = 0
That can be solved and gives: XEB =0.301.
(b) The above process is repeated with the same conditions, except that at the inlet
there is a steam flow rate of 15 mol steam for each mole of ethylbenzene fed:
nEB0 (mol∕s) = 100
nW0 (mol∕s) = 1500
nS0 (mol∕s) = 0
nH0 (mol∕s) = 0
n0 = nEB0 + nW0 + nS0 + nH0
and gives: XEB =0.735.
Problem 7.7 The following second-order liquid-phase catalytic reaction is con￾ducted in an isothermal fixed-bed reactor:
A → B r = k ⋅ CA
2
The intrinsic rate constant is 161 l/mol⋅s. The feed is 0.8 l/s of a solution of A with
the concentration of A at 4 mol/l. Spherical catalyst pellets of radius 0.12 cm are used
to pack the reactor. The catalyst has a pellet density of 0.88 g/cm3, and the reactor
bed density is 0.5 g/cm3. The effective diffusivity of A inside the catalyst pellet is
3.14⋅10−3 cm2/s. You wish to achieve 99.9% conversion of A.
(a) First, neglect both diffusional resistance and mass transfer resistance. What is
the mass of catalyst required to achieve the desired conversion?
(b) Next, consider diffusional resistance, but neglect mass transfer resistance. What
are the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor at the entrance of the reactor?7 Catalytic Reactor Design 263
What are the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor at the exit of the reactor?
Given these two effectiveness factors, compute an upper bound and a lower
bound on the mass of catalyst required to achieve the desired conversion.
(c) Next, consider both diffusional resistance and mass transfer resistance. Assume
that we have estimated the mass transfer coefficient to be kC =0.35 cm/s. Find
the effectiveness factor at the entrance of the reactor. Find the effectiveness fac￾tor at the exit of the reactor.
Given these two effectiveness factors, compute an upper bound and a lower
bound on the mass of catalyst required to achieve the desired conversion.

So, the lower and upper limits for the weight of catalyst needed are 6345 and
43 662 g, respectively.
(c) Now we have that:
(−rA) = kC2
As𝜂 = kC(CAg − CAs)
We know the values of CAg (in the bulk gas), k, and kC. We will assume a value
for the concentration in the surface (CAs), calculate the Thiele modulus (mL),

Problem 7.8 You have been asked to design a packed-bed reactor to carry out the
following reaction in the gas phase: 2A → B. It is required to achieve a conversion
fraction of 0.9 for 5 m3/s of feed containing 50% (molar basis) A and 50% of an inert I.
The operating conditions are 28 ∘C and 1.1 atm; the pressure drop is considered neg￾ligible. The diameter of the catalyst is 1.28 cm, and its particle and packed-bed den￾sities are 1.2 and 0.66 g/cm3, respectively. Assume negligible external resistance to

Problem 7.9 The gas-phase catalytic reaction A + 1/2B → C is conducted in an
isothermal tubular reactor. The feed consists of 1 m3/min with 98% A and 2% B at
1 atm and 373 K. The mass transfer coefficient of B (kCa)B, is 0.15 l/s⋅g. Suppose that
for A, we can neglect its external resistance to mass transfer. Also, ignore the effect
of the change in number of moles on the mole fraction because the associated error
would be less than 1%. The catalytic rate (including internal effects) is given by:

(a) Estimate the amount of catalyst needed to react half of the reactant B fed.
(b) Compare the amount of catalyst needed in case of neglecting the resistance to

Solution to Problem 7.9
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115

Note that pB in the intrinsic reaction rate is estimated at the surface of the cata￾lyst (pBs) that is related to its concentration by:

At the input, we have:

pB0 = 0.02 atm
At the exit, nB = 0.5nB0 = 0.327 mol/min, CB = 3.27 ⋅ 10−4 mol/l, nA = nA0 −
2nB0XB = 31.382 mol/min and pA = 31.382
31.382+0.327 ⋅ Ptotal = 0.9896 atm and
pB = 0.0103 atm
Using the first equation, we can calculate CBs, being CBs =5.80⋅10−4 mol/l at the
input and CBs =2.85⋅10−4 mol/l.
These values give reaction rates of 1.11⋅10−5 mol B/s/g at the input and
0.636⋅10−5 mol B/s/g at the exit. We can estimate that the reaction rate is more
or less constant with a value of 8.71⋅10−6 mol B/s⋅g.
As the total amount of B converted is 0.327 mol/min = 0.005 45 mol/s, we have:
W = 0.005 45
8.71 ⋅ 10−6 = 626 g of catalyst268 7 Catalytic Reactor Design

an average of 9.64⋅10−6 mol/s/g, the amount of catalyst needed is 565 g.
Problem 7.10 Two materials, mole sieve 5A and γ-Al2O3, can be used for drying a
gas stream flowing at a rate of 100 ml/min at a temperature of 27 ∘C and a pressure of
1 bar. The gas stream contains 1 vol% water. The adsorption of water on these mate￾rials can be described as a surface reaction with the kinetics given by (−rA) = k⋅CA.
(a) Your goal is to determine which drying material will result in the lowest water
content when the gas stream is fed to an ideal plug flow reactor (PFR) with an
empty volume of 250 ml, filled with one of the drying materials.
(b) Additionally, you need to calculate the water content that can be achieved using
the chosen drying material.

Similarly, (mL)2 =0.065 and 𝜂2 =0.999. With this data, we cannot already say
that the second material is better because the kinetic constant is much lower.
Let us calculate the water content at the exit.7 Catalytic Reactor Design 269
In a PFR with a first-order reaction:
XA = 1 − exp (

Doing the calculations, XA1 =0.763 and XA2 =0.047, so the first material is much
better.
(b) The water content will be reduced by 76.3% with the first material (XA1 =0.763)
and by 4.7% with the second one.
Problem 7.11 A small vessel with a volume of 50 ml is partially filled with a
packed bed of solid, spherical catalyst KX, behaving like an ideal PFR. The decom￾position of a gas stream pure of A, flowing through this reactor, is determined by
first-order reaction kinetics: (−rA) = kCA, where:
(−rA) = decomposition rate of A per unit catalyst surface
k = reaction rate constant = 2⋅10−6 m3/m2⋅s
CA = concentration of A at the catalyst surface (mol/m3)
Data for catalyst KX:

Sv = specific internal surface area = 4.0⋅108 m2/m3
Sg = specific internal surface area = 400 m2/g
De = effective diffusion coefficient of A in catalyst = 2.0⋅10−6 m2/s
In the first experiment, the reactor is filled with particles with a diameter of 3 mm,
which are loosely packed, resulting in a bed porosity of 0.60. In this situation, a
conversion of A of 38.1% is obtained.
Determine the following:
(a) Flow rate Q0 through the reactor in the first experiment.
(b) The catalyst bed is then “tapped” resulting in a close-packed bed with a
decreased porosity of 0.52. No additional catalyst has been added to the bed.
Determine the conversion of A obtained in the new steady state.
(c) After this experiment, the catalyst particles of 3 mm are replaced by an equal
mass of particles with a diameter of 0.03 mm, which are also tapped. The porosity
of the bed remains at 0.52. Determine the steady-state conversion of A in this
situation.

Problem 7.12 A particular porous catalyst is available as spheres of seven different

one of these conversion levels is incorrect, while the other six are correct.
(a) Determine which conversion level is incorrect and what its correct value
should be.
Using the same catalyst, two similar series of spherical particles with different
diameters are available. However, these catalysts have been used in an indus￾trial reactor for years, resulting in 50% poisoning of the active surface. In the
first series, homogeneous poisoning has occurred, affecting the exterior and the
center of the catalyst to the same extent.
(b) Determine the conversion in the smallest and the largest spheres of this series
under the standard conditions mentioned in part (a).
In the catalyst particles of the second series, poisoning progressed from the exte￾rior, resulting in two distinct zones within the spheres:
● A poisoned outer shell of the catalyst particle that is completely inactive.
● A non-poisoned center with the original activity.
Here are some additional notes to consider:
● The reaction is first-order in A.7 Catalytic Reactor Design 271
● All parameters not mentioned may be assumed to be the same within a series and
between series.
● Use the porous-sphere model in your calculations.

(a) In the PFR with a first-order reaction:
W = −Q0 ln(1 − XA)
k′𝜂
and the effectiveness factor can be calculated from De and k, besides the values of
particle diameter.
The higher conversion would correspond to the smallest particles, as the diffusion
into them is much more favorable and the effectiveness factor will be higher.
Let us assume values for the constants that will make the problem much easier.
For example, we will take values of 10−6 m2/s for De, 0.02 mol/kg⋅s for k′
, density of
the catalyst 1600 kg/m3, and W =1 kg. With this, for the smallest particles:
Q0 = − k′
W𝜂
ln(1 − XA) = − 0.02 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 1
ln(1 − 0.8647) = 0.009 987 m3
s
With all these values, we will calculate the effectiveness factors and conversions
of all other particle diameters:
D (m) R (m) mL 𝜼 ln(1 − XA) XA

As we can see, the value of conversion that was wrong is 0.8115, and the previous
table shows the ordered values. If we had assumed other values of the constants, the
resulting Q0 would have been different, but not the values of effectiveness factor and
conversions.
(b) If the spheres are 50% poisoned, the conversion will change, since there will be
half the active surface. In the definition of “L”:
L = Volume of the particles
External surface available for entry and difussion of the reagent272 7 Catalytic Reactor Design
the external surface will be half, so L is double. With this:

With the smallest particles, the effectiveness factor would be the same and so the
conversion, but not with bigger particles.
Problem 7.13 Air containing 2 vol% ammonia is to be passed through a column
at a rate of 5000 m3/h. The column is packed with 25 mm Raschig rings (interfacial
area 74 m2/m3) and is operating at 20 ∘C and 1 atm. The aim is to remove 98% of
the ammonia by absorption into water. Assuming a superficial air velocity of 1 m/s
and a water flow rate of approximately twice the minimum required, calculate the
required column diameter and packed height. The solubility of ammonia in water
at 20 ∘C is given by:
HA =
Cg ( kg

The absorption of ammonia into water is a typical case where gas-phase resistance
controls the mass transfer rates. The value of kG can be assumed to be 164 m/h.
Solution to Problem 7.13
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
The concentrations of ammonia in the gas at the bottom and top of column are:
CAg0 = pA0

CAg exit = (1 − 0.98) ⋅ CAg0 = 1.63 ⋅ 10−5 mol

The amount of ammonia to be removed is 8.18⋅10−4⋅5000⋅0.98 = 4010 mol/h.

column is:

m3 = 0.198 53 mol

For a superficial gas velocity of ug =1 m/s, the required sectional area of the
column is 5000/3600 = 1.388 m2, and the column is 1.33 m in diameter. In this
situation, the superficial water rate is:

The input molar ratio in the gas is:
Y0 = y0
1 − y0

1 − 0.1 = 0.111
And the liquid enters with no SO2, so X0 =0. As we know that enters 340 m3/h of

The exit molar ratio will be:

Problem 7.15 The absorption of ammonia in air into water at 20 ∘C is being inves￾tigated. The process involves a liquid film mass transfer coefficient of 2.70⋅10−5 m/s

kL =0.34 m/h, respectively. We need to estimate the value of the overall mass transfer

Problem 7.19 A reactor with a volume of 50 ml is completely filled with spherical
catalyst particles of 3 mm diameter. The bed porosity is 0.6, and the reactor can be
considered an ideal plug flow system. The decomposition of pure A in the reactor
follows first-order kinetics, given by the equation:
rS = kS ⋅ CA
where rS is the reaction rate per unit catalyst surface area (mol/s⋅m2
cat), CA
is the concentration of A (mol/m3), and kS is the rate constant of the reaction
(2⋅10−6 m3/s⋅m2

For the catalyst, the following data are provided:
𝜌PARTICLES = 1000 kg/m3
Specific surface area “a” = 400 m2/g
De,A = 2⋅10−6 m2/s
Now, ‘let us address the different parts of the problem:
(a) Give the expression to calculate the efficiency factor and the design equation for
an isothermal PFR with a given amount of this catalyst.
(b) In the above situation, the conversion of A in the reactor is 0.4. Calculate the
efficiency factor of the catalyst and the volumetric flow rate through the reactor.
(c) The reaction tube is subjected to a vibration system, causing the density of the
bed to increase, decreasing the porosity to 0.52. Calculate the conversion that
will result.

a diameter of 0.03 mm. The porosity of this bed is also 0.52. What is the new

Usually, for spheres, L = dp/6, as the external area coincides with 4πR2 and the
volume is 4/3πR3. Nevertheless, for porous particles, we should account for the
surface of the pores, so the best form to calculate the characteristic length in this
case is:

Problem 7.20 A recycle reactor containing 101 g of catalyst is used in an
experimental study. The catalyst is packed into a segment of the reactor having
a volume of 125 cm3. The recycle lines and pump have an additional volume
of 150 cm3. The particle density of the catalyst is 1.12 g/cm3, its internal void
fraction is 0.505, and its surface area is 400 m2/g. A gas mixture is fed to the
system at 150 cm3/s. The inlet concentration of reactant A is 1.6 mol/m3. The outlet
concentration of reactant A is 0.4 mol/m3.
(a) Determine the intrinsic pseudo-homogeneous reaction rate, the rate per unit
mass of catalyst, and the rate per unit surface area of catalyst. The reaction is
A → P.7 Catalytic Reactor Design 283
(b) Suppose that the reaction is first-order. Determine the pseudo-homogeneous
rate constant, the rate constant based on catalyst mass, and the rate constant
based on catalyst surface area.
(c) The piping in the recycle reactor has been revised to lower the recycle line and
pump volume to 100 cm3. What effect will this have on the exit concentration of
component A if all other conditions are held constant?
Solution to Problem 7.20
(a) The volume of the gas phase is the entire reactor except for the volume taken up
by the mechanical parts and by the skeleton of the catalyst particles:
Vgas = 125 + 150 − 101
1.12 (1 − 0.505) = 230 cm3
For this:
𝜀total = 230
275 = 0.836

The intrinsic pseudo-homogeneous rate, as determined using the CSTR is:

(b) Since the reaction rate is rA = −k

just divided by the appropriate exit concentration to obtain the values of k. The
ordinary concentration is used for the rA (mol/m2 ⋅s):
k′′′ = 0.783

(c) The catalyst charge is unchanged. If the reaction is truly heterogeneous and
there are no mass transfer resistances, the rate of reaction of the component
should be unchanged. More specifically, the pseudo-homogeneous rate for the
CSTR will change since the gas phase volume and residence time change, but
the heterogeneous rate should be the same:
Vgas = 125 + 100 − 101
1.12 (1 − 0.505) = 180 cm3
For this:
𝜀total = 180

Problem 7.21 The reaction (CH3)2C=CH2 + H2O → (CH3)3C–OH with excess
water is conducted in a fixed-bed reactor using a spherical catalyst. The catalyst
has a radius of 0.213 cm and a density of 2 g/cm3. The reaction is carried out
under isothermal conditions at 100 ∘C and 1 atm. It is a reversible reaction, and
the final conversion achieved is 80% of the equilibrium conversion. At 100 ∘C, the
equilibrium constant is measured to be 16.6. The reaction rate is 1.1⋅10−5 mol/s gcat,
and the external concentration of the limiting reactant is 1.65⋅10−5 mol/cm3. The
mean effective diffusivity of the reactants in the catalyst is 2⋅10−2 cm2/s. The task is
to determine the effectiveness factor of the catalyst for this reaction.

being k1 the kinetic constant of the forward reaction, k2 the kinetic constant of the

rate is zero, so:

The equilibrium conversion would be XAeq =0.94, and XA =0.8⋅XAeq =0.75.

Problem 7.22 In the previous problem, a new experiment was conducted using
a different catalyst consisting of spherical particles with a diameter of 0.13 cm. The
observed rate of the reaction was measured to be 0.8⋅10−5 mol/s gcat. All other val￾ues remain the same as in the previous problem. The objective is to determine the

Problem 7.23 An irreversible reaction is carried out in a PFR using catalyst par￾ticles with a diameter of 3 mm. Pure reactant A is fed into the reactor at a flow rate

The desired conversion at the outlet of the reactor is 80%. The task is to calculate
the mass of catalyst required to fill the reactor. The following additional data are
provided for the calculation:

Problem 7.26 Partial oxidation of n-butane (B) to maleic anhydride (MA) is car￾ried out at 1 atm in a commercial reactor, the packed tubes of which contain a VPO
catalyst (1.2 gcat/cm3
bed) and are cooled by alkali metal nitrate. The inlet and outlet
temperatures are 390 and 410 ∘C; desired B conversion and selectivity to MA are 80%
and 60%, respectively.
An applicable rate equation for conversion of B to MA is:

Given a feed of 1.8% butane in air and a gas-feed rate of 1500 m3 (STP)/h, deter￾mine:
(a) How much kg per hour of MA is produced?
(b) How many reactor tubes of 3 cm diameter and 12 m length will be needed?
Solution to Problem 7.26
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) The concentration of the gas at the inlet, assuming an isothermal bed at
400 ∘C, is:
CT0 = P
RT = 1
0.082 ⋅ 673 = 0.018 12 mol
l
Only 1.8% of this gas is B, so:
CB0 = 1.8 ⋅
CT0

The concentration of oxygen (21% of the air) will be:
CO = CT0 (

l
At the exit:
CB = CB0(1 − XB) = 3.26 ⋅ 10−4

l
and:
CMA = (CB0XB)SMA = 3.26 ⋅ 10−4 ⋅ 0.8 ⋅ 0.6 = 1.57 ⋅ 10−4 mol

So the production of MA is:
MA exit = CMA ⋅ G = 1.57 ⋅ 10−4 ⋅ 1500 ⋅ 1000 = 235 mol

Each tube has a volume of 8.48⋅10−3 m3, i.e., 8.48 l, which using the bed density
gives a total of 10 178 gcat/tube, so a total of 4147 tubes are necessary. This
calculation is made assuming that the conditions of the bed are those with
butane totally converted, i.e., a CSTR assumption. If, on the contrary, we use
the conditions of the gases at the input condition:
r′
B0 = k ⋅ KB ⋅ CB0 ⋅ C0.23
O
1 + KBCB0

gcat ⋅ s
And the weight of catalyst needed:
W = 9.01 ⋅ 106 gcat = 9.01 ⋅ 103 kgcat
This is a total of 885 tubes. A good approximation to the real conditions is to use
a log mean of the concentration:
CBmean = CB0 − CBexit
ln ( CB0
CBexit ) = 1.62 ⋅ 10−4 mol

This gives a mean reaction rate of 1.54 ⋅ 10−8 mol

will be 1710.

of 2.3 kg/l (when coated on a monolith support) and a slurry-bed density of 0.4 kg/l
is available. Assume isothermal operation at 300 ∘C and 300 atm of H2 with a liquid
feed consisting of 15 kmol/h of fatty ester. A rate equation determined from a

expressed in kmol/kgcat⋅h. The desired conversion of ester is 85%. Assume the stoi￾chiometry is 1 : 1.
Can either of these reactors be used by themselves with the available catalyst to
meet the conversion requirements? Or will it be necessary to use both reactors con￾nected to each other in a series? If so, which reactor should be positioned first?
Explain and document your answers where possible with calculations.

As we can check, the final conversion in this bed is 0.67, so it does not reach the
desired conversion.
In the slurry reactor, we will assume a CSTR behavior, so:
Exit − Input = Generation

Using the data in the problem, we have that k′
W
nE0
= 2.67 and XE =0.622, so this
reactor neither reaches the 0.85 conversion.
Let us try to combine both reactors. As a first thought, surely, we should place bed
reactor first and later the slurry reactor. In this situation, the conversion in the first
reactor is exactly the same as in the previous case, i.e., 0.67. The exit of this reactor is:
nE (exit of the PFR) = nE0(1 − XE) = 4.95 kmol
h
that will enter the slurry reactor, so:
k′
W
nE0
= 8.07
and the new conversion in the second reactor is 0.816. The global conversion can be
calculated:
nE (exit of the CSTR) = nE0(1 − XE) = 4.95 (1 − 0.816) = 0.91
XE global = 1 − 0.91
15 = 0.939
In the second combination, CSTR is sited before the PFR. In this case, the conver￾sion in the first reactor is 0.622 (nothing changes with respect to the isolated reactor).
Now, the input to the second (tubular) reactor is:
nE (exit of the CSTR) = nE0(1 − XE) = 5.67 kmol
h
bearing in mind this new value of flowrate entering the PFR, we obtain a conversion
of 0.919 in the second reactor, so:
nE (exit of the PFR) = nE0(1 − XE) = 5.67 ⋅ (1 − 0.919) = 2.15 kmol
h
and:
XE global = 1 − 2.15
15 = 0.857294 7 Catalytic Reactor Design
Problem 7.28 In a fixed-bed catalytic reactor, methanol will be produced, using
excess hydrogen from an electrolytic process in reaction with carbon dioxide from
the air. The reaction takes place in the gas phase in the presence of a commercial
TMC-31 catalyst:
3H2 + CO2 ↔ CH3OH + H2O
This is an equilibrium reaction, whose constant Kp is given by:
log(Kp) = 3066
T − 10 592
The kinetics of the reaction are well represented by the Van den Busche (VDB)
model, with the following equation:
rM =

In which rate is given in (mol of methanol/h⋅gcat) when the following values are
used:

kb 6.62⋅10−11 bar−1 −124 119
kc 3453.8 –
kd 3.862 mol/g⋅h⋅bar2 −36 696
since each constant follows the Arrhenius-type behavior (k = A⋅exp[−E/RT]).
Be careful that the activation energies in this correlation are negative, which is
quite rare.
100 kmol/h of hydrogen is available, and it will be mixed in a stoichiometric pro￾portion with CO2, and we aim to reach a conversion of hydrogen near 0.2. Determine
the amount of catalyst needed, as well as the best inlet pressure and temperature
conditions, in the range where the catalyst is active (140–280 ∘C).
Solution to Problem 7.28
Let us call “A” to the hydrogen and “B” to the CO2. In that situation, we have:
3A + B Methanol (C) + water (D)
nA0 = 140 kmol/h
nB0 = nA0/3
T = 140 to 280 °C
Catalyst XA = 0.2 (desired)

This is a reaction among gases, and we should account for the expansion of the
gas. The expansion factor can be calculated using:

nA0 + nB0

where species “j” refers to all components and “k” refers to the key component, in
this case, the hydrogen. 𝛼i are the stoichiometric numbers in the reaction (negative
for the reactants and positive for the products).
In that way, we can do:
Q = Q0(1 + 𝜀XA)
nA = nA0(1 − 𝜀XA)
nB = nB0 + nA0 (

With initial condition XA =0 for M =0, we can simulate the system for different
values of pressure and temperature and choose the best one for achieving the objec￾tive of converting 20% of the hydrogen. Let us assume a total pressure of 70 bar and a
temperature of 280 ∘C. With these values, we can calculate the following at the input:
nA0 = 100 kmol

nB0 = 100∕3 kmol

With these variables, we can calculate rM, in this case, giving 1.71 mol/gcat⋅h, and
taking a value of ΔW, we will calculate ΔXA. For example, if ΔW = 4000 g, the corre￾sponding ΔXA in this differential is 0.0488. With this, product formed and reactants
consumed can also be calculated.
We can do this calculation repetitively until the conversion gets its maximum
value, or equals the desired 0.2 value. In the spreadsheet corresponding to this

As we can see, the conversion does not reach 0.2 at any point, as the existing equi￾librium does not permit more reactants to be converted.
We can try to change total pressure and temperature of the operation, but it is
almost impossible to get a higher conversion. A total amount of nearly 400 kg of
catalyst will be needed in these conditions.299

Problem 8.1 At a temperature of 25 ∘C, a rotating drum absorber is utilized
to facilitate the absorption of CO2 into a 2.5 M mono-ethanolamine solution.
The absorber features a contact surface area of 1885 cm2 and a contact time of
0.2 seconds. In the gas phase, the partial pressure of CO2 is 0.1 atm. The absorption
reaction involved follows the equation: CO2 +2R2NH → R2NCOO− +R2NH+.
Experimental measurements reveal that the absorption rate under these conditions
amounts to 3.26 × 10−4 mol/s. Determine the rate coefficient when the gas-phase
resistance is neglected, and the reaction is assumed to follow a pseudo-first-order
behavior.

in cylindrical SCo.SMo3/Al2O3 catalysts, with a diameter of 0.08 cm and a particle
density of 0.9 g/cm3. The reaction conditions are 25 atm and 300 ∘C. The gaseous
reactant reacts with the hydrocarbon in the liquid phase. The intrinsic catalytic rate
is pseudo-first-order with respect to dissolved hydrogen and is given by:
1/2H2 (g) + R-S (l) → R-H (l) + SH2 (g) r = kCH2
With k =0.02 l/g⋅s. The diffusivity of H2 in the solvent is 5⋅10−5 cm2/s. 1.1 l/s of

Problem 8.4 A fermenter is used to carry out an enzymatic reaction. The enzyme,
E, is supported on spherules with a density similar to that of water. The suspension
reactor is perfectly stirred. The internal resistance to mass transfer can be neglected
since the spherules are very small. However, the external resistance is significant.
The mass transfer coefficients are:
(kC ⋅ a)A = 0.54 l∕min ⋅ lliquid
(kC ⋅ a)B = 0.36 l∕min ⋅ lliquid

where k

=8.7 l2/min⋅mol⋅lcatalyst and K =9.1 M−1. The internal volume of the tank
is 10 m3. The accessories, including the stirrer and nozzles to retain the spherules,
uniformly occupy 10% of the internal volume. The upper 20% of the entire internal
volume of the reactor must be free of suspension. The spherules occupy 15% of the
volume of the suspension.
(a) Calculate the volume of liquid inside the reactor, in m3.
Two independent streams with equal volumetric flows (G) are fed. The first
contains a 3.0 M aqueous solution of A, and the second contains another 1.2 M
aqueous solution of B.
(b) If 80% of the B fed reacts, calculate the concentrations at the outlet.
(c) Estimate the rate of reaction for B, referring to the volume of liquid.
(d) Calculate the volumetric flow rate, in l/min, which must feed on each solution.
Solution to Problem 8.4
(a) The volume of the liquid can be easily obtained.
VL = Vreactor ⋅ (1−0.2) ⋅ (1−0.08−0.15) = 6.16 m3.Summary of Rate Expressions 309

Note that the reaction rates are calculated at the concentration present on
the surface of the catalyst, not at the global concentrations. In the previous
equations, the only unknowns were CAs and CBs. We can check that CAs =0.43 M
and CBs =0.04 M. With these values (−r′′′
B ) = 0.03 mol/min⋅l
(d) For example, for B we have:
moles of B reacted = nB0 ⋅ XB = (CB0 ⋅ G) ⋅ XB = 0.96G
moles of B reacted = (−rB) ⋅ V = 0.03 ⋅ 6.16 = 0.1848
So finally, G =0.24 m3/min.
Problem 8.5 40 l/s of a gas containing 0.05 M of A is continuously fed to a
semi-continuous reactor with three phases. This flow rate can be assumed to be
constant within the reactor. The reactor is charged with 2400 l of a 1 M liquid
solution of B. For the liquid phase, the reactor operates in batches. The solubility of
A is 0.02 M liquid/M gas. The relevant reaction is:
A (g) + B (l) → products
with:

where the resulting velocity is based on the free volume of liquid, and the kap already
includes the effects of internal resistances to mass transfer. During discharge, the
solid catalyst remains soaked inside the reactor. Under the operating conditions,
the parameters that describe the external mass transfer are:
(kAL ⋅ aL) = 0.3 s−1
, (kAs ⋅ as) = 0.1 s−1
, (kBs ⋅ as) = 0.01 s−1310 8 Multiphase Reactor Design
The residence time of the bubbles inside the reactor is very short compared to
the retention time of the liquid. Since the rate of reaction is relatively slow, it is a
reasonable assumption to consider CAL to be “constant” but only in relation to the
time a bubble travels between its inlet and the upper level of the liquid.
(a) Determine the time needed to achieve a conversion fraction of 0.99 for B, and
(b) Check which resistances had a significant effect.

Problem 8.6 The process for the elimination of chlorinated compounds (R-Cl)
(chlorobenzene, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride) from polluting gases is being
studied at 300 K on a catalyst formed by microporous silica (SiO2 and Ag/SiO2)
in the presence of aqueous solutions of MEA (methyl ethyl amine). In a packed
tower, the liquid is fed from the top and the gas is fed in countercurrent. Under
these conditions, (kg a) for these R-Cl is estimated at 0.3 mol/min⋅atm⋅l, (kL a) is
10 min−1, and there is an elimination of 60% (molar) for a gas residence time of
3 min. The kinetics of the equimolar reaction between R-Cl and MEA is first order
with respect to R-Cl.
(a) Determine the value of the rate constant of the reaction, clearly indicating its
units. Is it a real or an apparent constant?
(b) If the gas flow is 1000 l/min, what volume should the reactor have? Clearly spec￾ify if the calculated volume is for gas, liquid, solid, or full reactor.

Problem 8.7 The concentration of SO2 in the air (at 1 bar = 105 Pa) must be
reduced from 0.1% (i.e. 100 Pa) to 0.02% (i.e. 20 Pa). Calculate the required height of
a tower that works in countercurrent flow if it is carried out:
(a) With pure water.
(b) With water to which KOH is added at a rate of 800 mol/m3. This reacts with SO2
in such a way that:
2KOH + SO2 → K2SO3 + H2O
(c) In both situations, indicate which resistance is the one that controls the global
process.
Data: (“A” refers to SO2 and “B” to KOH)
For the filling: kAg a =0.32 mol/h m3 Pa, kAl a =0.1 h−1
The solubility of SO2 in water is given by the Henry’s law constant:
HA = pAi∕CAi = 12.5 Pa m3∕mol
Flows per square meter of section of the tower are:
Gas = 1 105 mol/h m2
Liquid = 7 105 mol/h m2
The molar density of the liquid under all conditions is 56.000 mol/m3.
KOH reacts with SO2 extremely quickly. We will assume that the diffusivities
of the two components in water are equal.
Solution to Problem 8.7
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) Our strategy is to first solve the mass balance and then determine the height of
the tower. Since we are dealing with dilute solutions, we can use the simplified
form of the material balance. Thus, for any point on the tower pA and CA are
related by:
pA − pA1 =
(L
S
)
( G
S
) ⋅
PT

⋅ (CA − CA1)
where pA1 is the partial pressure of A at the outlet and CA1 is the inlet concen￾tration (countercurrent). In this system:
pA − 20 = (7 ⋅ 105)
(1 ⋅ 105)
⋅ 105
56 000 ⋅ (CA − 0)314 8 Multiphase Reactor Design
This provides:
CA = 0.08 ⋅ pA − 1.6
From this equation, the concentration of A in the liquid leaving the tower is:
CA2 = 0.08 ⋅ 100 − 1.6 = 6.4 mol

A = pA − HA ⋅ CA = pA − 1.25 ⋅ (0.08pA − 1.6) = 20 Pa
Integrating, we obtain: h =512.5 m.
(b) The strategy to solve the problem is the following:
Step 1. Write the material balance and calculate CB2 in the output stream.
Step 2. Determine which form of the rate equation should be used.
Step 3. Calculate the height of the tower.
Let us begin:
Step 1. Material balance. For rapidly reacting dilute solutions, the following
equation provides for any point of the tower, pA, CB:
pA − pA1 =
(L

The final value for the height of the tower is 37.18 m.
(c) When only water is used for removing the SO2, the controlling step is resistance
in the liquid film, as we have shown. When using KOH to help, we must compare
both addends of the denominator of the rate expression. If we do this, we will
see that the gas resistance (1/kAg⋅a) is approximately 2.4% of the total in every
section of the tower.
Problem 8.8 A reaction is being carried out for the elimination of chlorinated
compounds in water by reaction with a nucleophile compound (NaNH2) on a

The internal resistance to mass transfer can be neglected since the spherules are very
small. However, external resistance is significant. The mass transfer coefficients are:

with equal volumetric flows are fed. The first contains a 3.0 M aqueous solution of A,
and the second contains another 1.2 M aqueous solution of B.

Respect to “A,” CA0 =3/2 = 1.5 mol/l and CA = CA0 − CB0⋅2XB =1.5−2⋅0.6⋅0.8
= 0.54 mol/l.
(b) For estimating the reaction rate for B, referring to the volume of liquid, we see
in the statement that the important steps in the reaction are the mass transfer in
the catalyst film and the chemical reaction itself. In this way:
(−rB) = (kBcac)(CB − CBs) = kCAsCBs
(−rA) = (kAcac)(CA − CAs) = 2kCAsCBs
Values of CB and CA refer to a point far from the surface of the catalyst and coin￾cide with the “global” concentrations calculated before. Note that the chemical
rate is evaluated at the concentration of each reactant on the surface (as internal
diffusion is fast). Substituting the known variables:

● Concentration of reactant B in the solution: 5 kmol/m3
● Diffusivity of gas A in the solution: 1.5⋅10−9 m2/s
● Reaction rate constant (A +B → Products; second-order overall): 0.03 m3/kmol s
● Considering different equipment options, we have the following ranges for the
liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (kAL):
⚬ Bubble dispersions (plate columns, bubble columns, agitated vessels): kAL rang￾ing from 2⋅10−4 to 4⋅10−4 m/s.
⚬ Packed column: kAL ranging from 0.5⋅10−4 to 1.0⋅10−4 m/s.
Based on these options, it is necessary to assess the suitability of each equipment
type for facilitating the desired gas–liquid reaction. Please provide your recommen￾dation along with the reasons supporting your choice.
Solution to Problem 8.9
We can calculate the Hatta modulus for each of the possible situations. This modulus
will indicate whether the reaction is fast or slow:
MH =
√DAL ⋅ k′′′
kAL
=
√
1.5 ⋅ 10−9 ⋅ 0.03
kAL
For the bubble dispersions, MH will lie in the range of 0.075 to 0.038, and for the
packed column, MH is between 0.03 and 0.15. These values indicate that the reaction
is only moderately fast, and a relatively high holdup of liquid will be advisable. From
there, an agitated tank or a simple bubble column will be desirable for performing
the operation.
Problem 8.10 The objective is to oxidize o-Xylene to o-methylbenzoic acid in the
liquid phase using air dispersion in an agitated vessel. The reaction can be repre￾sented as:
o-Xylene + 1.5O2 → Benzoic acid + H2O
To maintain a constant low conversion, the reaction mixture in the vessel
undergoes continuous withdrawal of the product stream while fresh o-Xylene is318 8 Multiphase Reactor Design
continuously added. Under these conditions, the reaction rate is approximately
independent of the o-Xylene concentration and follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics
with respect to the dissolved oxygen concentration. The rate equation can be
expressed as:
(−rO) = k1CO
Here, (−rO) represents the rate of oxygen consumption in kmol O2/s⋅m3 liquid, and
CO is the concentration of dissolved oxygen in kmol O2/m3.
The rate constant k1 at the operating temperature of 160 ∘C is 1.05 s−1. The reactor
operates at a pressure that ensures the sum of the partial pressures of oxygen and
nitrogen inside the vessel is 14 bar. The liquid volume in the reactor is maintained
at 5 m3, and air is dispersed into the reactor at a flow rate of 450 m3/h, measured at
reactor conditions.
The quantities to be determined are as follows:
(a) The fraction of the supplied oxygen that reacts.
(b) The corresponding rate of production of benzoic acid is in kilomoles per hour.
(c) Additionally, it is necessary to consider whether an agitated tank is the most
suitable reactor for this process.

Partial pressure at the exit will be calculated bearing in mind that, for each mole
of air entering at the exit, we will have 0.79 mol of nitrogen and 0.21(1− XA)
moles of oxygen, so:
yAexit = 0.21(1 − XA)
0.79 + 0.21 (1 − XA)
Also:
pAexit = 14 ⋅ yAexit
(b) In the system, the following is fulfilled:
0.0102(1 − XA) = 0.004 521 ⋅ 14 ⋅ 0.21(1 − XA)
0.79 + 0.21(1 − XA)
And finally, we obtain: XA = 0.9996. The hourly rate of production of the acid
will then be:
0.0102(1 − XA) = 0.091 kmol oxygen reacted
s
0.091 kmol oxygen reacted∕s

(c) A stirred tank, where there is a large volume of liquid, is suitable when the
speed of the chemical step is slow, since the conversion process takes place in
the entire volume of liquid. This is the case that corresponds to this problem,
since MH is less than unity.
Problem 8.11 Carbon dioxide (CO2) needs to be removed from an air stream
with an inlet concentration of 0.1 mol% and a total pressure of 1 bar. This will be
achieved by bubbling the air through a NaOH solution with a concentration of320 8 Multiphase Reactor Design
0.05 M (0.05 kmol/m3) at 20 ∘C in a bubble column. The flow rate of the caustic soda
solution is designed to ensure that its composition remains relatively unaffected by
the absorption process. The gas phase will have a superficial velocity of 0.06 m/s. In
each case, the height of the gas–liquid dispersion will be 1.5 m.
The objective is to calculate the ratio of the outlet concentration of CO2 in the air
to the inlet concentration in the following cases:
(a) In the first case, the diameter of the column is 0.20 m, and the gas flows through
the column in plug flow.
(b) In the second case, the diameter of the column is 0.20 m, and the dispersed plug
flow model is applicable to the gas.
(c) In the third case, the diameter of the column is 1.5 m, and the dispersed plug
flow model is applicable to the gas.
For each case, the ratio of outlet concentration of CO2 to the inlet concentration
will be determined based on the given parameters and the specific flow characteris￾tics of the gas and liquid phases in the bubble column:
▸ Second-order rate constant for the reaction is k =9.5⋅103 m3 /kmol⋅s
CO2 + OH− → HCO2−

▸ Diffusivity of CO2 in the liquid: 1.8⋅10−9 m2/s
▸ Solubility of CO2: Henry’s law constant HA =25 bar m3/kmol (2.5⋅106 Nm/kmol)
▸ Bubble column mass transfer characteristics: The following estimates for a
superficial gas velocity of 0.06 m/s will be used for both columns:
● Gas holdup: 𝜀G =0.23
● Gas–liquid interfacial area per unit volume of dispersion: a =195 m2/m3
● Liquid-side mass transfer coefficient: kAL =2.5⋅10−4 m/s

=

1.8 ⋅ 10−9 ⋅ (9.5 ⋅ 103 ⋅ 0.05)
2.5 ⋅ 10−4 = 3.7
Note that, in the second-order reaction, k′′′
ap = k′′′⋅CB. As the Hatta modulus is
quite high, surely all the reactions are taking place in the film because chemical step
is quite fast. The concentration of dissolved CO2 at the interface in contact with the
gas entering with a partial pressure of 0.001 bar will be:
CAi = 0.001

Problem 8.12 During the hydrogenation of α-methyl styrene using palladium
deposited on porous alumina as the catalyst, experimental findings suggest that the
reaction follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to hydrogen, character￾ized by a rate constant k1 of 16.8 s−1 at 50 ∘C. The effective diffusivity of hydrogen
within the catalyst bed is estimated to be 0.11⋅10−8 m2/s.
For the design of a stirred tank reactor with a “slurry” configuration (catalyst in
suspension), spherical particles with a size of 100 μm are considered. The Thiele
modulus can be calculated using the standard procedure, and the effectiveness factor
is estimated using the equation:
𝜂 = 1
mL
{
coth(3mL) − 1

}
where L represents the corresponding characteristic length (R/3) of the particles.
Additional parameters for the design are provided: bubble size (db) is 0.8 mm, gas
fraction (𝜀G) is 0.20, liquid film mass transfer coefficient (kAL) is 1.23⋅10−3 m/s, cat￾alyst film mass transfer coefficient (kAc) is 0.54⋅10−3 m/s, and the solid/liquid ratio
is 0.10 (by volume) to ensure an excess of catalyst. The operation is carried out at
30 bars and 50 ∘C, with the Henry’s law constant for dissolved hydrogen at this tem￾perature being 285 m3 bar/kmol. Considering these values, the overall reaction rate
can be calculated, assuming instantaneous mass transfer in the gas phase.

Problem 8.13 The aim is to evaluate the performance of a three-phase fluidized
bed for the hydrogenation of α-methyl styrene at 50 ∘C, using the same catalyst as
described in Problem 8.12, but with spherical particles of 2.0 mm diameter. The
liquid and gas flow rates are adjusted to achieve a volume fraction of particles in
the bed of 0.50 and a volume fraction of gas of 0.20. The estimated bubble size in the
bed is 5.0 mm.
The task at hand is to calculate the overall rate of reaction for this system.
Solution to Problem 8.13
Because the conditions for the reaction are the same as in former problem, the
pseudo-first-order rate constant k will again be 16.8 s−1, and the effective diffusivity
of hydrogen in the liquid-filled pores of the catalyst De will be 0.11⋅10−8 m2/s.
Also, because the transfer coefficients kAL and kS depend mainly on the physi￾cal properties of the system, the same values, namely, kAL =1.23⋅10−3 m/s and
ks =0.54⋅10−3 m/s, will be used.
In this problem, the aim is again to evaluate the individual resistance terms in the
general equation rate and to examine them in turn. In addition, the overall rate of
hydrogenation at the same hydrogen pressure of 30 bar will be calculated.
(a) Gas–liquid mass transfer resistance 1/kALa:

where RG +L is the resistance to mass transfer from the gas to the liquid, and RS+R
is the resistance to the transfer into the solid catalyst and the chemical reaction. By
doing the corresponding plots, we can calculate the slopes and intercepts, obtaining,
for catalyst A:
(RG+L)catalyst A = 0.9 min
(RS+R)catalyst A = 300 g

And for catalyst B:
(RG+L)catalyst B = 1.0 min

The values shown for (RG +L) should be equal for both particles, as they depend
on the bubbles but not on the catalyst. The differences should be attributed to
experimental errors. From the values of (RS+R) one can conclude that the particle
diameter A is larger than that of B (as A has a lower effectiveness). In fact, if RS is

Problem 8.16 The hydrogenation of a diol is carried out in a slurry bed reactor
by introducing 0.5 g of catalyst powder into the reactor. The initial concentration
of the diol is 2.5 mol/cm3. The reaction follows first-order kinetics with respect to
both H2 and the diol. Hydrogen is supplied to the reactor through a distributor at a
pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 35 ∘C. The equilibrium concentration of H2 is
0.01 mol/cm3, and the specific reaction rate constant is 4.8⋅10−5 cm3/cm2⋅s. The cata￾lyst has a solid loading (𝜀s) of 0.1 kg/m3, a particle diameter of 0.01 cm, and a density
of 1.5 g/cm3. We need to calculate the overall reaction rate and determine whether
pore diffusion can be neglected. Additionally, we need to verify if mass transfer in
the pores and external transfer can be considered negligible.

Problem 8.17 It is proposed to reduce the concentration of NO in the effluent
of a plant by passing it through a packed bed of spherical, porous, solid carbona￾ceous granules. A mixture of 2% NO and 98% air flows with a velocity of 1⋅10−6 m3/s
through a tube with an internal diameter of 5 cm packed with the porous solid at a
temperature of 1173 K and a pressure of 101.3 kPa. The reaction:
NO + C → CO + 1/2N2
It is first order with respect to NO and occurs mainly in the pores, within
the granule where the internal surface area is 530 m2/g and the rate constant is
4.42⋅10−10 m3/m2⋅s.Summary of Rate Expressions 329
(a) Estimate the value of the efficiency factor in this system.
(b) Calculate the value of the external matter transport coefficient.
(c) Calculate the weight of the porous solid needed to reduce the NO concentration
to a level of 0.004%.
Additional data. At 1173 K, the properties of the fluid are:
Kinematic viscosity = 𝜐 =1.53 10−8 m2/s
Gas phase diffusivity = 2 10−8 m2/s
Effective diffusivity = 1.89 10−8 m2/s
The properties of the catalyst and the bed are:
Catalyst particle density = 2.8 g/cm3
Bed porosity = 0.5
Volumetric density of the bed = 1.4 106 g/m3
Granule radius = 3 10−3 m
In the bed, the Thoenes–Kramers relation is fulfilled: Sh = (Re)(1/2)(Sc)(1/3)
If necessary, consider that there is counterdiffusion in the reaction.
Remember that:
Sh = (kC dp)∕DAB
Re = (𝜌udp)∕𝜇 = (udp)∕𝜐
Sc = 𝜇∕(DAB𝜌)

Problem 8.18 We want to determine the necessary bed height in a 1 m diameter
cylindrical bubbling tank in which the total hydrogenation of acetylene to ethane
is carried out, bubbling both gases (H2 and C2H2), in the necessary stoichiometric
proportion, through a suspension in octane of solid particles of a certain metallic
catalyst.
The gas distributor plate, which represents a total flow rate of 15.5 l/s, measured
under the reactor’s working conditions, has a porosity of 50%, with pores of 250 μm
in average diameter.
The reactor works at a temperature of 77 ∘C and a pressure of 5 atm, conditions
in which the overall rate is controlled by the gas–liquid mass transfer. In the reac￾tor, the suspension is perfectly mixed, and the introduction of the gases causes an
increase of 10% in its volume, creating bubbles that ascend in plug-type flow.
It is intended to have a sufficient bed height to achieve a fractional conversion of
acetylene of 65%.
Data for acetylene in octane at 77 ∘C: Diffusivity = 7.5⋅10−5 cm2/s, Henry’s con￾stant =2.87⋅105 atm/(mol/cm3)
The density of octane under the conditions of the problem is 0.6844 g/cm3 and
its viscosity is 3.2⋅10−3 g/cm⋅s. The average between the two gases can be used as
the density of the gas, 1.7⋅10−3 g/cm3. The bubbles produced are estimated to be
spherical with a mean diameter of 0.167 cm.
For the calculation of the gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient, the Calderbank cor￾relation can be used:

Problem 8.19 A solute A, initially in the gas phase, reacts mole for mole with
a compound B in the liquid phase by means of a second-order reaction. Previous
results indicate that in this reaction, the increase factor E conforms to the equation:
E = 0.96 + 0.80 √CB∕CA
The equilibrium relationship is CAi =0.9⋅pAi (CA in mol/m3, pA in atm). The oper￾ating conditions are given in the figure. The resistance of the gas film is negligible.

In the same way, a balance between the input and a definite section is:

concentration of ES is nil.

Assume k1 ≫ k−1, k2 so E is present in a small concentration. Apply the
quasi-steady state assumption (QSSA) and show that the slow-time scale model
reduces to a first-order, irreversible decomposition of S to P
S → P
(a) For a well-stirred batch reactor, show that the total enzyme concentration
satisfies, at any time:
E(t) + ES(t) = E(0) + ES(0)
(b) Find an expression for the concentration of E. What is the corresponding
concentration of ES?
(c) Show that the rate expression for the reduced model’s single reaction is:
r = k(S)
1 + K(S)
, k = k2KE(0), K = k−1
k−1 + k2
which depends solely on the substrate concentration. The inverse of the constant
K is known as the Michaelis constant.
(d) Plot the concentrations versus time for the full model and QSSA model for the
following values of the rate constants and initial conditions:
k1 =5 k−1 =1 k2 =10
E(0) = 1 ES(0) = 0 S(0) = 50 P(0) = 0
Solution to Problem 9.1
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) For the enzyme (E), we can write:
d(E)
dt = k−1(ES) + k2(ES) − k1(E)(S)
For the active complex (ES), we do:
d(ES)
dt = −k−1(ES) − k2(ES) + k1(E)(S)
In that way:
d(E + ES)
dt = k−1(ES) + k2(ES) − k1(E)(S) − k−1(ES) − k2(ES) + k1(E)(S) = 0
This is, the sum of the concentrations of (E) and (ES) at any time is constant and
equals the initial values:
ES(0) + E(0) = (ES) + (E)
(b) If QSSA is assumed:
d(ES)
dt = −k−1(ES) − k2(ES) + k1(E)(S) = 0Summary of Kinetic Expressions 339
So:
k−1(ES) + k2(ES) = k1(E)(S)
And:
(ES) =
k1(E)(S)
k−1 + k2
And then:
(ES)
(E)(S) = k1
k−1 + k2
= 1
KM
Assuming that ES(0) = 0, we can write:
E(0) = (ES) + (E)
So:
E(0) − (ES) = (E)
And then:
KM = (E)(S)
(ES) = (E(0) − (ES))(S)
(ES)
So:
(ES) = E(0)
1 + KM
(S)
And (E) = E(0) − (ES) = E(0) − E(0)
1+ KM
(S)
(c) Here, the production rate of this product is:
r = dP
dt = k2(ES) = k2E(0) ⋅ (S)
(KM + (S)) = k2E(0)K (S)
(1 + K(S))
(d) With the QSSA:
d(ES)
dt = 0
whereas with the full model:
d(ES)
dt = −k−1(ES) − k2(ES) + k1(E)(S)
d(E)
dt = k−1(ES) + k2(ES) − k1(E)(S)
d(S)
dt = k−1(ES) − k1(E)(S)
d(P)
dt = k2(ES)
We can use the finite differences method for integrating the above expressions,
using the initial values shown in the statement:
ESt+1 = [−k−1(ESt
) − k2(ESt
) + k1(Et
)(St
)] ⋅ Δt + ESt340 9 Biochemical Reactor Design: Enzymatic Processes
Et+1 = [k−1(ES) + k2(ES) − k1(E)(S)] ⋅ Δt + Et
St+1 = [k−1(ES) − k1(E)(S)] ⋅ Δt + St
Pt+1 = k2(ES) ⋅ Δt + Pt
We obtain, for the QSSA:

Solution to Problem 9.8
Using the definition of equilibrium constants, we have:
Km = (ES)
(E) ⋅ (S)
KI = (ES2)
(ES) ⋅ (S)
So:
Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S) = (ES)
KI ⋅ (ES) ⋅ (S) = (ES2) = KI ⋅ Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S)
2
Bearing in mind that, from the reaction scheme:
d(ES)
dt = k1 ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S) − k−1(ES) + k−i
(ES2) − ki
(ES) ⋅ (S)
d(P)
dt = kp ⋅ (ES) = kp ⋅ Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S)
Assuming QSSA for (ES) species:
k1 ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S) + k−i
(ES2) = k−1(ES) + ki
(ES) ⋅ (S)
And so:
k1 ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S) + k−i ⋅ KI ⋅ Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S)
2 = k−1 ⋅ Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S) + ki ⋅ Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ (S)
2
We can get the substrate concentration in the equilibrium:
k1 + k−i ⋅ KI ⋅ Km ⋅ (S) = k−1 ⋅ Km + ki ⋅ Km ⋅ (S)
(S) =
k1 − k−1 ⋅ Km
k−i ⋅ KI ⋅ Km + ki ⋅ Km
And finally:
d(P)
dt = kp ⋅ Km ⋅ (E) ⋅ k1 − k−1 ⋅ Km

Problem 9.11 A 160-liter tubular bioreactor to produce ethanol from sugar enters
a flow rate of Q0 =10 l/min and has a matrix with immobilized enzymes, with an
average concentration of 5 g enzyme/l reactor. At the entrance, the sugar concentra￾tion is 100 g/l and the ethanol concentration is negligible, so the product leaves the
reactor very diluted. For this reason, the recirculation of the product is proposed with
a recirculation flow equivalent to three times the inlet flow. Under these conditions,354 9 Biochemical Reactor Design: Enzymatic Processes
the output of the system indicates that the concentration of ethanol is 40 g/l and that
of sugar is 4 g/l. Since the enzymatic kinetics of this system follow Michaelis and

Problem 9.12 Wastewaters containing nitrates, such as those from septic tank
sewage systems, agricultural runoff, and some food-related industries, pose signif￾icant pollution risks to marine environments and aquatic life. These wastewaters
serve as a primary nutrient source for microorganisms that contribute to eutroph￾ication of surface waters. To address this issue, a common approach involves a
two-step process: aerobic nitrification followed by anaerobic denitrification. In
the denitrification stage, facultative heterotrophic bacteria reduce nitrate ions to
nitrogen gas.
The biological denitrification of wastewater streams has been studied in packed
beds at various temperatures ranging from 5 to 20 ∘C. Under steady-state condi￾tions with microbe populations and feed nitrate concentrations below 100 mg/l, the
denitrification reaction follows a rate expression of the form:
r = 𝜇∗ ⋅ YCNO3
Here, 𝜇* represents the rate constant for pseudo first-order nitrate removal, Y is the
biochemical yield coefficient, and CNO3 is the nitrate concentration.
Residence time distribution studies have indicated that a tube packed with 3-mm
glass beads exhibits behavior consistent with a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) model.
Now, let’s consider a similar packed bed operating in a steady state at a temperature
where the product of 𝜇* and Y is 0.309 h−1, and the inlet concentration of nitrate
ions is 80 mg/l. We want to determine the residence time required to reduce this
concentration to 20 mg /l.
Solution to Problem 9.12

its KS = 1.5 g/cm3. If the input substrate concentration is 145 g/cm3, determine
the maximum output rate for this system in a continuous stirred tank reactor
(CSTR).
(b) If the concentration of product at this maximum output rate is 10 g/cm3, deter￾mine the maximum output rate of the product.
(c) If the concentration of biomass at this maximum output is 50 g/cm3, determine
the cell mass formation rate at the maximum output rate.

The mass balance in the reactor is reduced to:
D = Q0
V = 𝜇
so we can calculate the values of specific rate (𝜇) at the different working conditions.

Problem 10.4 Escherichia coli grows with a doubling time of 0.5 h in the exponen￾tial growth phase.
(a) What is the value of the specific growth rate?

= 𝜇 ⋅ 0.5
And finally, 𝜇 = 1.386 h−1
(b) Also, we can do:

(a) Draw a growth curve of the cells by plotting the logarithm of the cell concentra￾tions against the cultivation time.
(b) Assign the accelerating, exponential growth, and decelerating phases of the
growth curve in part (a).
(c) Evaluate the specific growth rate during the exponential growth phase.
Solution to Problem 10.5
For details refer the Wiley website at http://www.wiley-vch.de/ISBN9783527354115
(a) We should use a spreadsheet to do the calculation. The specific growth rate (𝜇)
is calculated as the incremental increase of the cell concentration (rX) divided
by the cell concentration.
𝜇 = Xt+1 − Xt

(b) As we can see, in the first three hours of culture time, the process is in the
lag phase, where the cell concentration remains practically stable. From this
moment on, the exponential growth phase can be observed for up to 30 hours.
From this time, it returns to a deceleration phase that can be considered as a
stationary phase. If more experimental data were available, the death phase
could be observed later, when the cells begin to die and their concentration
begins to decrease.
(c) To assess the specific growth rate during the exponential growth phase, we
can calculate the derivative dX/dt using the finite differences approximation.
In the previous figure, it is plotted against time. It can be seen that the growth364 10 Biochemical Reactor Design: Microbial Growth
rate is decreasing as time progresses. This means that at the beginning of the
exponential phase, there will be more cell growth and less and less until you
reach the stationary phase.
Problem 10.6
(a) In the fermentation process, yeast cells exhibited growth from 19 kg-dry cell/m3
to 54 kg-dry cell/m3 over a period of seven hours. During this time, 81 g of glyc￾erol was consumed per liter of fermentation broth. Determine the average spe￾cific growth rate and the cell yield with respect to glycerol.
(b) In a continuous stirred tank fermenter operating as a chemostat, E. coli was
cultured with a working volume of 1.0 l. The fermenter was supplied with a
medium containing 4.0 g/l of glucose as the carbon source at a constant flow
rate of 0.51 h−1. The glucose concentration in the output stream was measured
to be 0.20 g/l. The cell yield with respect to glucose (Yx/s) was determined to be
0.42 g-dry cell/g-glucose. Determine the cell concentration in the output stream
and the specific growth rate.
Solution to Problem 10.6
(a) As in previous problems, we have:
ln ( X
X0
)
= 𝜇t
And, using the data:
ln (54
19
)
= 𝜇 ⋅ 7
So 𝜇 = 0.1492 h−1
For calculating the cell yield with respect to glycerol, we can do:
−Y X
S
= X0 − X
So − S = 19 − 54
81 = −0.43 kg dry cell
kg substrate
bearing in mind that 81 g/l = 81 kg/m3. So finally, YX/S = 0.43 kg/kg.
(b) In the CSTB, in steady state, we have that: D = Q0/V = 𝜇
So in this case, 𝜇 = 0.51 h−1
On the other hand:

And we have: X = 1.59 g-dry cells/l.
Problem 10.7 Studies carried out in the laboratory showed that in continuous
culture, Azotobacter vinelandii has a maximum specific growth rate of 0.45 h−1 and
a KS of 28 mg/l. If a 50 l bioreactor is operated, with a dilution rate of 0.32 h−1,Summary of Kinetic Expressions and Mass Balances in Bioreactors 365
YX/S = 0.36 g X/g S, and a substrate concentration in the feed of 5 g/l, determine
the steady-state cell concentration and the limiting substrate concentration in the
effluent.
Solution to Problem 10.7
In this reactor, D = 𝜇, so we can do:
D = 𝜇 = 0.32 h−1 = 𝜇m ⋅ S
KS + S = 0.45 ⋅ S
0.028 + S
obtaining S = 0.068 g/l. Doing a mass balance for the substrate:
Q0 ⋅ S0 + (
−rS
)
⋅ V = Q0 ⋅ S
As we know Q0 = D ⋅ V = 0.32 ⋅ 50 = 16 l/h, so:
16 ⋅ 5 + (
−rS
)
⋅ 50 = 16 ⋅ 0.068
Solving (−rS) = 1.5779 g S/l ⋅ h
Also, we have Y X
S
= rX
rS
and:
0.36 = rX∕1.5779
So rX = 0.5681 g X/l ⋅ h
Finally, we can do X = rX/𝜇 = 0.5681/0.32 = 1.775 g/l.
Problem 10.8 A new yeast strain is being considered for biomass production. To
characterize the yeast strain, experiments were carried out in a one-stage bioreac￾tor. In the experimentation, a concentration of substrate at the bioreactor inlet of
800 mg/l was used, operating with excess oxygen, pH of 8.5, and a temperature of
35 ∘C. Using the data in the following table, estimate:

of “D ⋅ X” versus D is done, locating its maximum that corresponds to:

Using the value of D = 0.5 h−1, we get S = 155.22 mg/l

Problem 10.10 The bacterium Pseudomonas sp. has a maximum specific growth
rate of 0.4 h−1 when it is cultivated in acetate. The saturation constant using this
substrate is 1.3 g/l, and the coefficient of yield of cells in acetate is 0.46 g cel/g acetate.
If this system is operated as a chemostat, with an S0 of 38 g/l, perform the following
analysis:
(a) What is the critical dilution rate?
(b) What is the concentration of cells when the dilution rate is half critical?
(c) What is the substrate concentration when D is 80% critical?
(d) What is the cell productivity at D value calculated in (c)?
(e) Find Dopt for cell productivity; what percentage of Dcritical is this?
Solution to Problem 10.10
(a) A balance of cells, assuming X0 = 0, in the reactor is: 𝜇 = D, and then:
D = 𝜇m ⋅ S
KS + S
Assuming that Dcritical is obtained when the substrate concentration at the exit
equals S0:
Dcritical = 0.4 ⋅ 38
1.3 + 38 = 0.3867 h−1
(b) Value of “X” can be estimated as:
D = Dcritical∕2 = 0.1935 h−1
As we have:
S = D ⋅ KS

Using the same expressions, S = 4.45 g/l
The cell concentration is:
X = 15.43 g∕lSummary of Kinetic Expressions and Mass Balances in Bioreactors 369

of substrate has been estimated at 0.28. Preliminary tests make it advisable to work
at a dilution rate equal to 82% of the critical value.
(a) What is the maximum specific velocity, 𝜇m?
(b) What is the substrate concentration in the feed?
(c) What is the substrate concentration in the discharge?
(d) What is the cell concentration at steady state?
Solution to Problem 10.11
(a) During the exponential growth:
ln ( X

As we know, t = 3.15 h for X = 2X0, so: 𝜇 = 0.22 h−1 that would actually represent
𝜇m as the time is the minimum, as indicated in the statement.
(b), (c), and (d) When D = 𝜇m, the state of the reactor is critical, as it operates
at the maximum rate. In the present case, D = 0.82 ⋅ Dcritical = 0.82 ⋅ 0.22 =

reactor presents the following characteristics: 𝜇m = 0.45 h−1, KS = 0.8 kg/m3,
Yx/s = 0.55 kg/kg. The Monod equation is assumed to hold. Calculate:Summary of Kinetic Expressions and Mass Balances in Bioreactors 371
(a) What feed rate is needed to achieve 90% substrate conversion?
(b) What is the biomass production corresponding to a substrate conversion of 90%
compared to the maximum possible?
Solution to Problem 10.13
(a) For a conversion of 90%: S = (1 – 0.9)⋅ S0 = 2 kg/m3
In that situation
D = 𝜇 = 𝜇m

Q0 = D ⋅ V = 0.321 ⋅ 5 = 1.6 m3

(b) Biomass production:
X = YX∕S ⋅
(
S0 − S
)
= 0.55 ⋅ (20 − 2) = 9.9 kg
m3
D ⋅ X = 0.321 ⋅ 9.9 = 3.18 kg
m3 ⋅ h
If the conversion were 100%: S = 0, X = YX/S ⋅ S0 = 11 kg/m3
D = 𝜇m

KS + 0 = 𝜇m

= 0.5625 h−1
D ⋅ X = 6.18 kg
m3 ⋅ h
This would be the maximum production of biomass in the bioreactor.
Problem 10.14 A simple chemostat with a useful volume of 5 l presents some
design problems that cause imperfect agitation. The equipment is going to be used
to grow yeast with 𝜇m = 0.48 h−1 and KS = 0.072 g/l. The feed flow will be 1.1 l/h,
with a limiting nutrient concentration of 6 g/l and YX/S of 0.43 g/g. It is assumed
that 35% of the feed stream bypasses the fermenter but joins the output stream, and
the remainder enters the chemostat. Determine (Dopt, Xopt), 𝜇, and S at the exit of
the fermenter.
Solution to Problem 10.14
In the chemostat, we can write:

The rate of microbial growth at this dilution rate is:
ropt = 𝜇m
Sopt
KS + Sopt
Xopt
Sopt = Dopt ⋅ KS
𝜇m − Dopt
= 0.4227 ⋅ 0.072
0.48 − 0.4227 = 0.589 g

Xopt = (
S0 − Sopt)
⋅ YX∕S = (6 − 0.589) ⋅ 0.43 = 2.32 g
l
ropt = 0.48 0.589
0.072 + 0.589
2.32 = 0.9951 g
h ⋅ l
In the fermenter, we have:
CSTR
V = 5 l
Q0 = 1.1 l/h
Qb = 0.385 l/h
Q = 0.715 l/h
So actually, D = Q/V = 0.143 h−1 = 𝜇
In that case:
S = D ⋅ KS
𝜇m − D = 0.031 g

X = (

)

The concentration at the exit of the fermenter must account for the bypass cur￾rent, so:
Sexit = 0.031 ⋅ 0.715 + 6 ⋅ 0.385
1.1 = 0.230 g

Problem 10.15 The growth of E. coli in glucose can be described by the Monod
kinetics model, with a substrate saturation constant (KS) of 4 g/m3 and a maximum
specific growth rate (𝜇m) of 1.33 h−1. The yield coefficient (YX/S) is 0.1 g cells/g glu￾cose. Calculate the glucose feed rate (with a concentration of 60 g/m3) necessary to
achieve the maximum rate of glucose consumption and cell production in a 1 m3
continuous stirred tank fermenter. Determine these values.

Dmax = 𝜇m

With V = 1 m3, the flow rate to the reactor is 1.2468 m3/h. The concentrations at
the exit are:
S = D ⋅ KS
𝜇m − D = 1.2468 4
1.33 − 1.2468 = 59.94 g
l
X = (
S0 − S
)
⋅ YX∕S = (60 − 59.94) ⋅ 0.1 = 0.006 g

Problem 10.16 Microbial growth of E. coli on glucose follows Monod kinetics. In
the laboratory, it is observed that for a glucose concentration of 1 g/m3, the growth
rate of the microorganism is 0.26 g cells/m3 ⋅ h, while if the concentration is 4 g/m3,
the rate is 0.65 g cells/m3 ⋅ h.
(a) Determine the values of KS and maximum rate of the kinetics of Monod.
(b) Study the behavior of a continuous stirred tank fermenter of 1 m3 in which
this process takes place by changing the glucose feed flow (concentration
S0 = 60 g/m3).
Data: The value of YX/S is 0.1 g/g.

Problem 10.17 In a tubular biochemical reactor, biomass is being produced
according to the process:
Substrate (S) + Cells (X) → More cells (X) + Product (P)
In the system, there is a recirculation of cells according to the scheme:

(a) Do a material balance for the X cells in the reactor.
(b) If the kinetics is of the Monod type with excess substrate, indicate how this bal￾ance can be simplified.
Solution to Problem 10.17
(a) In the centrifuge, the balance is:
(
Qr + Q0
)
⋅ X1 = Q0 ⋅ X + Qr ⋅ X0
Before the reactor, the concentration of cells entering, X′
, is:
(
Qr + Q0
)
⋅ X′ = Q0 ⋅ 0 + Qr ⋅ X0Summary of Kinetic Expressions and Mass Balances in Bioreactors 375
So:
X′ = Qr
Qr + Q0

In the PFR, the balance in a differential element is:
Input = (
Q0 + Qr
)
⋅ X
Output = (
Q0 + Qr

⋅ (X + dX)
Generation = rX ⋅ dV = 𝜇 ⋅ X ⋅ dV
Doing the mass balance:

Problem 10.19 In a system of two chemostats in series, the volumes of the first and
second reactors are V1 =500 l and V2 =300 l, respectively. The first reactor is used for
biomass production, and the second is used for the formation of a secondary metabo￾lite. The feed stream of the first reactor is Q0 = 100 l/h, and the glucose concentration
in the feed is S0 = 5.0 g/l. Use the following constants for the cells: 𝜇m = 0.3 h−1,
KS = 0.1 g/l, YX/S = 0.4 g cells/g glucose. Determine:
(a) The concentration of biomass and glucose in the effluent of the first stage.
(b) Assuming that growth is negligible in the second stage and that the specific rate
of product formation is YP/X = 0.02 g P/g cells and that YP/S = 0.6 g P/g S, deter￾mine the concentration of the product and the substrate in the effluent from the
second reactor.

X0 − X = −0.02 = 0 − P

S0 − S = 0.6 = 0 − 0.0384

an operating volume of 100 l and the second of 50 l. The feeding of the first fermenter
is sterile, contains 5 g/l of substrate, and is fed to the fermenter with a flow rate
of 18 l/h. Microbial growth follows Monod kinetics, with the values of KS and 𝜇m
being 120 mg/l and 0.25 h−1, respectively. Calculate the concentration of substrate

where we have designated the concentration of biomass, leaving the first CSTR as
X1. The corresponding rate of production of biomass per unit volume of this reactor
isrX1. Rearrangement of equation and introduction of the dilution rate (D1 = Q0/V1)
give:
rX1 = D1X1
As we know that X1 = 70 g/l and rX1 = 42 g/l ⋅ d, we should operate at

In the present design, the input flow has a known concentration of cells
X0 = 0.05 g/l. So, in this case, the balance of cells is:
d (XV)

Using the chain rule for derivation and bearing in mind that dV/dt = Q, we can
see that:
