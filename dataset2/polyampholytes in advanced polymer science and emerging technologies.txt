Introduction 
An introduction emphasizes the importance of this book in exploring polyampholy￾tes and gives various terms adopted in literature. It briefy describes the different 
types of polyampholytes with examples. Several fundamental properties of polyam￾pholytes discovered in the last century are given. Pioneers and contemporary authors 
who have made signifcant contributions to the development of polyampholytes are 
mentioned. The synthetic aspects of polyampholytes, numerous theoretical models, 
and simulations are omitted. Instead, the main attention is paid to hydrodynamic, 
conformational, acid–base, volume–phase, complexation, and catalytic properties of 
water-soluble and water-swelling polyampholytes together with application felds. 
The book consists of an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion. For the read￾er’s convenience, each chapter is provided with its own references. 
Polyampholytes are unique macromolecules containing acid/base or anionic/cat￾ionic groups in the main or side chains that mimic the behavior of proteins, poly￾peptides, and/or polynucleotides. Water-soluble and water-swelling polyampholytes 
exhibit thermal-resistant, salt-tolerant, shear-stable, self-healing, antifouling, self-as￾sembling, and stimuli-responsive properties that provide broad impact as structural 
biomaterials, drug delivery and chemo-mechanical systems, biosensors, energy stor￾age devices, supercapacitors, actuators, etc. Functional, confgurational, conforma￾tional, and behavioral similarity of synthetic polyampholytes to natural ones [1–3] is 
an emerging platform to protein mimicking [4, 5] and the developing of various bio￾compatible materials, drug delivery systems, tissue-engineering technology, bioreac￾tors, etc. Advances in polyampholytes emphasizing biomedical [6–9], medical [10], 
and antifouling aspects [11] were recently reviewed. The advances in synthetic pol￾yampholytes accumulated during the half century are outlined in this book, together 
with application in emerging technology. 
In current literature, the terms “zwitterionic polyampholytes,” “polybetaines,” 
“zwitterionic polyelectrolytes,” and “polyzwitterions” are widely used. A. B. Lowe 
and C. L. McCormick [12] suggest the use of the term “polyzwitterion” for all poly￾mers that possess both cationic and anionic groups. They refer to as polyampholyte 
those polymers that specifcally possess the charged groups on different monomer 
units, while polybetaine refers to those polymers in which the anionic and cationic 
groups are replaced on the same monomer unit. According to the defnition of A. 
Laschewsky [13], polyampholytes behave mostly either as polyanionic or as polyca￾tionic species, whereas polyzwitterions (or polybetaines), due to their overall charge 
neutrality, exhibit a different, hybrid-like property profle. Sometimes a subtle differ￾ence between these defnitions is hardly perceptible. 
Conditionally, polyampholytes can be divided into three classes: annealed, 
quenched, and betainic (or zwitterionic) [14–17]. Annealed polyampholytes consist 
of acid–base monomers that are ionized in dependence of pH, while quenched poly￾ampholytes containing strongly charged cationic and anionic monomers retain their 
respective charges independently on pH. The “semi-annealed” or “semi-quenched” 
polyampholytes are defned as amphoteric macromolecules that combine the weak xii Introduction 
acid/cationic or weak base/anionic monomers. “Betainic” (or zwitterionic) polyam￾pholytes are macromolecules containing identical numbers of acid–base (or fully 
charged anionic-cationic) species in the same monomer units [13, 18]. The macro￾molecules existing via compensation of the cationic-anionic monomer pairs without 
counterions also belong to zwitterionic polymers [19–22] or polyampholytic ionic 
liquids [23, 24]. Examples of polyampholytes with different chemical structures are 
shown in Figure 0.1. 
The main difference between the polyelectrolytes’ and polyampholytes’ irre￾spective linear or crosslinked (gel state) structure is related to their response to salt 
addition [24]. Expanded (or swollen) in pure water, polyelectrolyte chains shrink in 
salt solution due to the screened electrostatic repulsion between uniformly charged 
macroions (polyelectrolyte effect). Collapsed (or shrunken) in aqueous solution, 
“annealed” polyampholyte at the isoelectric point (IEP) and/or charge-balanced 
“quenched” polyampholyte, including polymeric betaines, in quasi-neutral state, 
unfold in salt solution due to screening of the electrostatic attraction between oppo￾sitely charged monomers (“antipolyelectrolyte” effect). 
The pioneering works of Alfrey, Morawetz, Fuoss [25–28], Katchalsky [29–31], 
Ehrlich, and Doty [32] in the 1950s invoked intensive development of this subject due 
to several reasons. First is the similarity of the hierarchical structure of amphoteric 
macromolecules to structural organization of proteins [33, 34]. Second is modeling 
FIGURE 0.1 Repeating monomeric units of (1) annealed, (2) quenched, (3, 4) zwitterionic, 
(5) quenched betainic, (6) annealed betainic, and (7, 8) self-annealed (or self-quenched) 
polyampholytes. Introduction xiii 
of protein folding mechanism by synthetic polyampholytes [35]. Third is involve￾ment of amino acids for obtaining amphoteric polypeptides [36–41] and intrinsically 
disordered proteins [42], as well as fabrication of polyampholytes from natural build￾ing blocks that exhibit protein-like behaviors [43, 44]. 
Several fundamental properties of polyampholytes have been discovered in the 
last century. One of the fascinating properties of polyampholytes is the so-called 
“antipolyelectrolyte effect” in aqueous solutions, predicted by Ehrlich and Doty [32], 
theoretically justifed by Higgs and Joanny [45], and confrmed experimentally by 
many research groups [46–48], including this one [49–53]. The “antipolyelectro￾lyte effect,” in contrast to the “polyelectrolyte effect,” is related to the unfolding 
of amphoteric macromolecules at the isoelectric point (IEP) upon the addition of 
low-molecular-weight salts in contrast to salt-induced collapse of ordinary polyelec￾trolytes [54]. Recently [55], the antipolyelectrolyte behavior of polybetaine macro￾molecules was detected directly at the single-chain level. 
Another recently discovered fundamental property is the “isoelectric effect” 
observed for a series of water-soluble polyampholytes, amphoteric hydrogels, and 
cryogels [56–68]. The “isoelectric effect” is due to charge inversion at the IEP and 
related to cooperative release of low- or high-molecular-weight substances at the 
IEP of polyampholytes as a result of a competition between inter- (inter-MMC) and 
intramacromolecular (intra-MMC) complexation [65]. 
The third fnding, but not adopted yet by fne specialists, is the behavioral close￾ness of interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPEC)—the products of the interactions 
between oppositely charged linear polyelectrolytes—and particularly block polyam￾pholytes [69–76]. 
A renewed interest in polyampholytes is expected to result from an improved 
understanding of the fundamental relationships between the microstructure and 
properties of linear and crosslinked amphoteric macromolecules, accompanied by 
systematic evaluation of the literature [77–84]. 
According to the Web of Science database (2018), the global key contributors to 
research into polyampholytes are Ali, S. A. (Saudi Arabia); Bekturov, E. A. (Kazakhstan); 
Bernards, M. (USA); Bohidar, H. B. (India); Candau, F. (France); Dobrynin, A. V. 
(USA); Gong, J. P. (Japan); Joanny, I. F. (France); Khokhlov, A. R. (Russia); Koetz, 
J. (Germany); Kudaibergenov, S. E. (Kazakhstan); Laschewsky, A. (Germany); 
Matsumura, K. (Japan); McCormick, C. L. (USA); Patrickios, C. S. (Cyprus); 
Rubinstein, M. (USA); Stamm, M. (Germany); Tsitsilians, C. (Cyprus); and others. 
In this book, the synthetic aspects of polyampholytes comprising of free radical 
polymerization (FRP), controlled radical polymerization (CRP), atomic transfer radi￾cal polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) 
polymerization, group transfer polymerization (GTP), chemical modifcation, exclu￾sion (deprotection) of protecting groups, click chemistry, via Ugi reaction, etc. are not 
considered. Also, numerous theoretical models and simulations of polyampholytes 
(or polyampholyte physics) that comprehensively were considered in the fundamen￾tal monograph of the present author, Polyampholytes: Synthesis, Characterization and 
Application (New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2002), that covered the 
literature sources starting from the 1950s are also omitted. Instead, the main attention 
is paid to hydrodynamic, conformational and molecular characteristics, acid–base and xiv Introduction 
solution properties, complexation and volume-phase properties of water-soluble and 
water-swelling polyampholytes, together with catalytic activity and application aspects. 
The present monograph also covers the innovative studies accumulated in the last 
20 years, with the aim to analyze and systematize the literature survey in the con￾text of emerging technologies. The book chapters describe the theoretical and exper￾imental results on polyampholytes to predict the perspectives for developing and to 
bridge the gap between synthetic and natural polymers, between biological materials 
and the physics and chemistry of amphoteric macromolecules. The book contains 
an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion. Starting with the classifcation 
and defnition of various types of polyampholytes in the introduction, Chapter  1 
describes the solution properties and hydrodynamic, conformational, and molecular 
characteristics of annealed, quenched, and betaine-type polyampholytes. The most 
important feature of polyampholytes is related to their isoelectric point (IEP), where 
the whole macromolecule is in a quasi-neutral state. The infuence of pH and ionic 
strength on the viscosity and sedimentation constant of annealed polyampholytes is 
shown, in agreement with the prediction of the unfolding of water-soluble amphoteric 
macromolecules at the IEP in the presence of neutral salts. The solution properties 
of charge-balanced and charge-imbalanced quenched polyampholytes are discussed. 
The conformation of imbalanced quenched polyampholytes consists of a core/shell 
structure with a polyampholyte core and a polyelectrolyte shell. Added low-molecu￾lar-weight salts can shrink the polyelectrolyte shell and swell the polyampholyte core 
at relatively high ionic strengths. Polyampholytes with block chains can form glob￾ular intra-polyelectrolyte complexes in similarity to interpolyelectrolyte complexes 
(IPEC) formed between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Separate subchapters 
are devoted to polybetainic (or polyzwitterionic) soaps which combine the behavior 
of polyampholytes and micellar polymers, to lower (LCST) and upper critical solution 
temperatures (UCST) of amphoteric macromolecules, to less-considered-in-literature 
polyampholytic ionic liquids, to semi-natural polyampholytes that can be prepared 
by modifcation of natural polysaccharides by introducing either carboxylic (sulfo) or 
amine (ammonium) groups or both into the macromolecular chains. They represent 
a new family of functional polymers with particular properties and new applications. 
A minor attention is paid to theories of polymer physics that were developed for the 
description of large macromolecules, including proteins. The intrinsically disordered 
proteins (IDPs) are characterized by their amino acid composition and low sequence 
complexity, as well as by their low amount of bulky hydrophobic amino acids and 
high proportions of charged and hydrophilic amino acids. Thus, proteins, polyampho￾lytic polypeptides, IDPs, and random, regular, and block polyampholytes can form 
globular conformations at the IEP, stabilized by coulombic forces between opposite 
charges within single macromolecules. Complex coacervation, or liquid–liquid phase 
separation (LLPS), is a common phenomenon in these systems too. The simplifed 
molecular design principles developed for synthetic polyampholytes can provide some 
insights into the more complicated sequences of IDPs and an understanding of how 
charge-driven LLPS can be designed by tuning the patterning of charged monomers. 
Chapter  2 deals with the fundamental and applied aspects of hydrophobically 
modifed polyampholytes (HMPA), sometimes called hydrophobic polyampholytes, 
or amphoteric “polysoaps,” their self-assembly and stimuli-responsiveness triggered Introduction xv 
by environmental conditions. The controlled balance between lyophilic and lyopho￾bic interactions due to the introduction of hydrophobic groups into the polyampholyte 
chain leads to organized solutions and solvent-depending self-assembly. Therefore, 
monolayers, micelles, vesicles, or highly organized structures are spontaneously 
formed. Hydrophobically associating polyampholytes combining the properties of 
polymer, surfactant, and alkaline can be used in different felds of application, for 
example, for heavy oil displacement. It is shown that hydrophobic polyampholytes 
can inhibit the wax deposition and consequently decrease the pour point temperature 
of crude oils. 
Chapter  3 concerns stimuli-responsive polyampholyte bulk hydrogels, nano￾gels, microgels, and microporous cryogels in dependence on the temperature, pH 
value, salt addition, solvent quality, DC electric feld, etc. Polyampholyte hydro￾gels and cryogels possess the typical features of polyelectrolytes. By adding 
low-molecular-weight salts, anti-polyelectrolyte effects can be induced, due to the 
disruption of intra- and interionic contacts. The isoelectric effect also takes place 
at the IEP of polyampholyte cryogels. By random copolymerization of oppositely 
charged ionic monomers at relatively high monomer concentrations and equi￾molar monomer ratios, a new class of physical hydrogels containing both strong 
and weak ionic bonds become available. Permanent crosslinks are responsible for 
maintaining the shape of the gel, while the ionic bonds, acting as a sacrifcial net￾work, are responsible for elongation, deformation, adhesion, self-healing, shape 
memory, and other important functions. The molecularly imprinted polyampholyte 
hydrogels and cryogels designed by crosslinking of acid–base monomers in the 
presence of template proteins or drugs within the network are considered as suita￾ble materials for separation and analysis of proteins and drug delivery system and 
hopefully will play an important role in molecular recognition, separation science, 
and biocatalysis. 
Chapter  4 is related to macromolecular complexes of different types of poly￾ampholytes with polyelectrolytes, proteins, surfactants, metal ions, dyes, drugs, and 
nanoparticles. The cooperative release of low- or high-molecular-weight substances 
at the IEP of polyampholytes is discussed, as a result of a competition between inter￾and intramacromolecular complexation. This so-called “isoelectric effect” can be 
used for purifcation and separation processes of proteins and the removal of transi￾tion metal ions, surfactants, and dyes from wastewater. 
Chapter  5 is related to the application of polyampholytes in biotechnology 
and medicine. Nonfouling, hemocompatibility, and biodegradability of polyam￾pholytes attract much interest as nanocarriers for delivery of chemotherapeutants, 
DNA, and proteins, or as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. These 
materials can trigger delivery through a bond cleavage or conformational change 
under the action of temperature, pH, ionic strength, enzymes, redox potential, 
etc. Polyampholyte nanoparticles can be used in photothermal tumor therapy, and 
polyampholyte hydrogels are proved as excellent biomaterials in artifcial organs. 
Polyampholytes offer special properties as cryoprotectants. The application of 
polyampholyte cryogels as a protein-imprinted matrix for the separation and puri￾fcation of biomacromolecules and for sustained release of biologically active 
substances is also highlighted in this chapter.  
 
 
 
 
 
xvi Introduction 
In Chapter  6, the catalytic properties of polyampholytes themselves, polyam￾pholyte–metal complexes, polyampholyte-protected metal nanoparticles, and ampho￾teric cryogel-encapsulated enzymes are outlined in catalytic reactions of hydrolysis, 
transesterifcation, photocatalytic light-driven hydrogen production from water, decom￾position, hydrogenation, and oxidation of various substrates. Special attention is paid 
to macroporous amphoteric cryogels containing metal nanoparticles or enzymes in 
pores that are used as batch-type and continuous fow–type catalytic reactors. 
The quintessence of the fundamental fndings discovered in the behavior of lin￾ear and crosslinked polyampholytes is considered in Chapter 7 in light of practical 
application, in particular in the felds of environmental protection, petroleum industry, 
biotechnology, and medicine. Linear and crosslinked polyampholytes exhibit salt￾tolerant, thermal-resistant, shear-stable, self-healing, antifouling, self-assembling, 
and stimuli-responsive properties that could have a broad impact in the areas of 
wastewater purifcation, desalination, enhanced oil recovery, stabilization of colloid 
dispersions, structural biomaterials, controlled drug delivery systems, energy and 
information storage devices, supercapacitors, and actuators, among others. 
In the conclusion, the state of the art, general problems, and promising directions 
of polyampholytes are discussed. This book can open a renewed interest for spe￾cialists on the theory of polyampholytes to make quantitative predictions and vali￾dation of their theoretical fndings. This perspective is related to several conceptual 
advances and the remaining persistent challenges in the contexts of charge and size 
of polymers, structures in homogeneous solutions, thermodynamic instability and 
phase transitions, structural evolution with oppositely charged polymers, dynamics 
in polyampholyte solutions, kinetics of phase separation, mobility of charged mac￾romolecules, and implications to biological systems. For the reader’s convenience, 
each chapter is provided with its own references.

Preface 
The present monograph deals with the chemistry, physics, and application of polyam￾pholytes—a special class of water-soluble and water-swelling polymers containing 
anionic and cationic functional groups in the main or side chains. The book stresses 
the basic principles and fundamental relationships between the microstructure and 
properties of linear and crosslinked amphoteric macromolecules based on the rele￾vant literature and own results of the author. The past and perspective research into 
synthetic polyampholytes accumulated over the last half century is outlined in this 
book. The book is conventionally divided into four periods of development. The frst 
period concerns the hydrodynamic, conformational, and molecular characteristics 
of water-soluble polyampholytes in solution. The second belongs to the complexa￾tion properties of polyampholytes with respect to various low- and high-molecular￾weight compounds (metal ions, surfactants, dyes, polyelectrolytes, proteins, DNA). 
The third represents the fundamental and applied aspects of hydrophobically mod￾ifed polyampholytes (HMPA), sometimes called amphoteric “polysoaps.” That of 
the last contains information on stimuli-responsive amphoteric nano-, micro-, and 
macroporous gels and also covers the biotechnological and medical aspects of pol￾yampholytes. A  separate chapter highlights the catalytic properties of synthetic 
polyampholytes. Finally, the fundamental fndings discovered with regards to the 
behavior of linear and crosslinked polyampholytes are considered in light of practi￾cal application (removal of metal ions, surfactants, and dyes from wastewater, water

Water-Soluble 1 Polyampholytes 
1.1 ANNEALED POLYAMPHOLYTES 
Typical annealed polyampholytes consisting of weak acid and weak base groups 
are copolymers of acrylic (or methacrylic) acid and vinylpyridines, copolymers of 
methacrylic (or acrylic) acid and N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate, and copol￾ymers of allylamine and methacrylic acid, which were frst synthesized by Alfrey, 
Morawetz, and Katchalsky [1–6], Ehrlich and Doty [7], and Kabanov [8]. The distri￾bution of acid–base groups in the polyampholyte chain can produce random [1–3], 
alternating [9], diblock [10, 11], triblock [12–14], multiblock [15, 16], graft [17–19], 
dendritic [20–22], star-type [23], telechelic [24], gradient [25], and end-capped [26] 
polyampholytes, where one end of the macromolecule contains anionic groups; the 
other, cationic groups. 
Annealed polyampholyte based on acrylic acid and (AA) and 4-vinylpyridine 
(4VP) in dependence of pH can exist in cationic, anionic, molecular (uncharged), and 
zwitterionic forms [27]. Transformation from the molecular to zwitterionic form or 
vice versa is determined by micro- and macroscopic ionization constants, as shown 
in Structure 1.1. 
The relationships between the microscopic (k1, k2, k12, k21) and macroscopic (K1, K2) 
ionization constants, as well as the tautomeric constants (Kt
), are described as follows: 
K1 k1 k = + 2
1 K2 =1 k12 +1 k21 
KK = kk = k k 1 2 1 12 2 21 
K = k / k = k / k t 1 2 21 12 
The molecular form of AA-4VP copolymer is more stable than its zwitterionic 
form because of Kt
<<1, while 1:1 monomer mixture and the mixture of poly(acrylic 
acid) (PAA) and poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) are mainly in zwitterionic form. The 
microscopic and macroscopic dissociation constants of equimolar copolymer AA￾4VP, monomer mixture of AA and 4VP, and polymer mixture of PAA and P4VP are 
summarized in Table 1.1. 
The distribution of the microscopic forms for AA-4VP copolymer shows that the 
zwitterionic and molecular forms coexist over a wide range of pH, and the latter form 
is predominant regardless of pH value. For the monomer and homopolymer mixtures, 2 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

the zwitterionic and molecular forms coexist at a limited range of pH around 5, 
and the former is predominant. The coexistence of both molecular and zwitterionic 
states was also shown for copolymers of MAA and 2M5VP [28]. Both the content 
of zwitterions that are responsible for water-solubility and the value of the isoelec￾tric point (IEP) depend on the composition of copolymers and hydrophobicity of {

macromolecules [2, 17]. The position IEP moves to higher (or lower) pH as the base/ 
acid ratio in copolymers is increased (or decreased). If either the base or the acid 
groups are present in large excess, polyampholyte molecules become insoluble at the 
IEP. Alternating copolymer of vinylethyl ether and N,N-diethylaminopropoylmono￾amide of maleic acid [17] preferentially exists in charged form, but the replacement 
of ethyl radicals by two bulky butyl radicals stabilizes the uncharged molecular form. 
Knowledge of the values of the IEP and the theoretical prediction of the isoe￾lectric state from the content, sequence, and dissociation constants of the acid and 
base groups is benefcial for analytical and preparative purposes. The Henderson– 
Hasselbalch modifed equation is used to analyze the acid–base equilibrium of pol￾yampholytes [29–34]: 
pH = pKa 
° +n log(˙ /1−˙) (1) 
pH = pKb ° +n log(1−˙ ˙/) (2) 
where pKa 
¢ and pKb
¢ are the apparent acidic dissociation constants of acid and basic 
groups, respectively, and α and β are the degree of ionization of acid and basic groups 
of polyampholyte. 
The equation connecting the IEP of polyampholytes with the acid-to-base molar 
ratio and with the acid–base dissociation constants was originally formulated 
70 years ago by Ehrlich and Doty [7] and later on successfully solved by Patrickios 
[35]. Two equivalent forms of explicit equation are expressed as follows:

where R is the molar ratio of acid to base. 
Eq. 3 is used for acid-rich (R >1) polyampholytes, while Eq. 4 is convenient for 
base-rich (R <1) polyampholytes. Eqs. 3 and 4 were employed to calculate IEPs from 
amino acid composition for 58 proteins with experimental IEPs covering the pH range 
from 2.9 to 12.1. The experimental IEPs correlated well with the acidic-to-basic 
amino acid molar ratio [36]. The authors in [37] calculated the values of the IEP for a 
series of annealed polyampholytes—statistical copolymers of methacrylic acid (MAA) and 
N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamide (APM). The pHIEP found for equimolar polyampholyte 
[MAA]:[APM] = 49:51 mol.% is 7.50 and very close to its theoretical pHIEP of 7.58, esti￾mated using Eq 3. A precisely equimolar polyampholyte 1:1 has a theoretical pHIEP of 6.9, 
refecting the strong dependence of pHIEP on very small changes in composition.

[45], and star-like polyampholyte poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-star￾poly(methacrylic acid) [23] were the subject of intensive study in the context of 
evaluation of the position of the IEP in dependence of microstructure (distribution of 
acid–base monomers) [33], copolymer composition [46], and nature of added salts 
[47]. For instance, the IEP of polyampholytes prepared by radical initiated copolym￾erization of N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEM) and methacrylic acid 
(MAA) (A type), alkaline hydrolysis (B type), or acidolysis (C type) of poly-N,N-di￾methylaminoethylmethacrylate (PDMAEM) is different, although the composition 
of copolymers differs slightly (Table 1.2) [32]. 
Copolymer C having a slight alternating tendency is soluble, while alkaline￾hydrolyzed copolymer A, having a slight blocklike tendency and acidolyzed copol￾ymer B having the mixture of blocklike and random sequences precipitate when the 
composition of copolymers is close to equimolar. This is due to the different distribu￾tions of the sequences of the acidic and basic monomers along the chain and explained 
by formation of an internal polycomplex of extremely compact structure between the 
long acid and base sequences in case of A and B. Taking into account that pKa = 5.15 
and pKb =  8.58 for MAA and N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEM), 
respectively, an S-shaped curve of pHIEP versus the acid content has been obtained 
theoretically [33]. The theoretical curve fts well with experimental one for A-type 
copolymer. Small deviations from the theoretical curve are observed for copolymers 
B and C types and can be explained by variations of pKa and pKb due to the nearest

neighbor interaction, which depends on the distribution of the acid and basic mono￾mers. The equation connecting the IEP of polyampholytes with the acid-to-base molar 
ratio and with the acid–base dissociation constants was successfully solved by Pat￾rickios [35, 36]. A good agreement between the experimental and theoretical titration 
curves was found for ABC triblock copolymer of DMAEM-MMA-MAA when pKa 
of MAA unit was taken as 5,4, and that of DMAEM unit as 8,0. [36]. The analytical 
approximation suggested by Patrickios [35, 36] is an effective tool for the accurate 
calculation of the IEP, most of the natural and synthetic polyampholytes. Theoreti￾cal dependence between the IEP and composition of copolymers of 1-vinylimidazole 
(1-VI) and acrylic (AA) or methacrylic acid (MAA) is also in good agreement with 
experimental data [46]. 
The position of the IEP depends on the specifc binding of counterions with mac￾roions [47] and the hydrophobicity of polyampholytes that infuences on the ionization 
constants of the acid–base groups [12 48, 49]. Santos-Rosas et al. [50] demonstrated 
that the hydrophobic interactions promote the formation of compact conformations 
and decrease the degree of ionization for a given pH-pKa value [51]. Another factor to 
induce the lower basicity of the amine groups and, concurrently, to increase the acidity 
of the carboxyl groups might be the more hydrophobic microenvironments of these 
groups in the polymer compared to the low-molecular-weight parts. This statement is 
in full agreement with potentiometric results showing a decrease of the pKa value (from 
6.6 to 5.3) by incorporating a phenyl group into the maleic acid–based polyampholyte 
[48]. The hydrophobic domains are actually energetically unfavorable for the creation 
of charged species, and for inducing deprotonation of carboxyl groups, while favorable 
for the deprotonation of protonated amines. For instance, elongation of comonomer 
derived from MAA to fve methylene units shifts the value of the IEP 1.5 units higher, 
confrming that the position of the IEP is mainly determined by the charge balance and 
the respective acidity and basicity constants of the comonomers (Table 1.3).

Table  1.4 shows a change of the acid–base properties of alternating comblike 
maleic acid-based copolymers [17, 54, 55] with varying rest R (R = C4H9 (PA-4), 
C6H13 (PA-6), C8H17 (PA-8), C10H21 (PA-10), C12H25 (PA-12), and n = 116, 59, 40, 
21, and 16). 
An increase of the length of hydrophobic fragments shifts the position of the IEP 
to the basic region due to a change of the dissociation constants of acid and base 
units. Analogous shifting of the IEP to the basic region was observed for polyam￾pholytes containing methyl-, propyl-, and butyl radicals [57]. 
Annealed polyampholytes are able to exist in globular, coil, helix, and stretched 
conformations and to undergo the coil–globule, helix–coil, helix–globule confor￾mational, or sol-gel phase transformations upon variation of the pH, temperature, 
salt type, salt concentration, and thermodynamic quality of solvents [9, 54, 56–60]. 
Annealed polyampholytes composed of weak acid and base groups often undergo 
liquid–solid (precipitation) or liquid–liquid (coacervation) phase separations from 
aqueous solution at their IEP, similar to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) [61]. 
Polyampholytes are used as model systems for directly investigating the infuence of 
charge sequence on IDP phase separation. It is worth noting that phase separation

of block polyampholytes is often termed self-coacervation due to signifcant simi￾larities observed between phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes 
and block polyampholytes. A discontinuous transition between extended and glob￾ular conformations of polyampholytes upon changing of the pH of solution can be 
attributed to a frst-order phase transition. The globular conformation is specifc for 
water-soluble annealed polyampholytes at the IEP [59, 62] (Figure 1.1). 
In acidic and alkaline media, polyampholyte molecules behave like ordinary 
polyelectrolytes, for example, the viscosity falls with growth of the ionic strength. 
An opposite, so-called antipolyelectrolyte effect is observed at the IEP: the poly￾ampholyte viscosity increases with increasing ionic strength. These experimental 
results are in good agreement with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations performed 
for carboxyethyl chitosan polyampholyte at different pH conditions in dependence 
of temperature and ionic strength [63]. With the increase in the NaCl concentrations 
at constant temperature, the radius of gyration (ROG) and the accessible surface 
area (ASA) of polyampholyte decrease at low/high pH conditions and increase at 
neutral or isoelectric pH condition. The tendency of temperature has the same infu￾ence on the ROG and ASA of polyampholyte. The values of ROGs and the ASA of 
polyampholyte showed the decreasing tendency at low/high pH conditions and the 
increasing tendency at neutral pH condition with the temperature rising. From MD 
simulation for aqueous polyampholyte solution at different temperatures and in var￾ious NaCl concentrations, it becomes clear to understand the change of the structure 
of polyampholyte in aqueous solutions at molecular detail. As seen in Figure 1.1, 
the sedimentation constant S0 is maximal at the isoelectric pH (pHIEP), demonstrat￾ing the formation of compact conformation at the IEP. In pure water, at the IEP, 
the macromolecular chains of polyampholyte behave as quasi-neutral globule with 
intrinsic viscosity around 0.02 dL·g-1. An increase of the salt concentration from 0 to 
0.3 mol·L-1 leads to an increase of the intrinsic viscosity up to 0.16 dL·g-1, while the 
Huggins constant K characterizing the quality of the solvent (water) with respect to 
macromolecular chain decreases from 0.8 to 0.1 g·dL-1. In other words, at the IEP, 
the globular conformation of polyampholyte in water expands eight times in the pres￾ence of 0.3 mol·L-1 KBr and adopts coil conformation. The averaged hydrodynamic 
molecular weights Msη (95 ± 10)·103 at pH from 4.0 to 11.0, including the pHIEP, 
indicate the absence of intermacromolecular association (Table 1.5).

The correlation between the hydrodynamic size and molar mass is expressed by 
the Mark-Kuhn-Houwink equation, [η] = KMKH·Ma
, where [η] is the intrinsic vis￾cosity, M is molecular mass, KMKH is constant, and a is exponent, refecting the 
conformation of macromolecules. Molecular theory for neutral polymers shows that 
for a dense spherical globule a = 1/3, for a fexible chain in a theta-solvent a = 1/2, 
for a fexible chain in good solvent a ≈ 3/5, and for a rod-like chain a = 1. Little   
Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 9 
effort, however, has been expended to fnd the hydrodynamic parameters of polyam￾pholytes. Logarithmic dependencies of the intrinsic viscosity [η] versus the average 
molecular weight Msη allow to calculate Mark-Kuhn-Houwink constants KMKH and 
the exponent a of polyampholytes [64, 65]. It was found that the value of a = 0.93 is 
high when polyampholyte chains behave as stretched polycations (pH = 4.8). On the 
contrary, the value of the exponent a ≈ 0.1–0.2 at the pHIEP = 8.7 indicates a globu￾lar conformation of amphoteric macromolecules at the interval of Msη = (2–5)·105. 
However, at Msη = (0.8–2)·105, the value of a becomes close to 0.93. This is prob￾ably accounted for by the stiffness of the macromolecules that do not fold to form 
compact structure. A deviation from the IEP or charge imbalance causes the glob￾ule–coil conformational transition reaching up at the extreme case to the stretched 
state. The existence of a double helical conformation for diblock polyampholyte and 
the coil–globule and helix–globule transitions was evidenced by simulation studies 
[66]. Alternating polyampholyte—copolymer of vinyl butyl ether (or styrene) and 
N,N-dodecylaminopropylmonoamide of maleic acid—in depending on the pH and 
temperature, undergoes the conformational transition helix ↔ coil and phase transi￾tion sol ↔ gel [54, 55]. The formation of physical gel and gel–sol phase transition 
was also observed for a triblock copolymer of PAA–b-P2VP–b-PAA above the crit￾ical concentration C* >2.5% [67]. Self-association phenomenon at the IEP that is 
specifc for proteins [68], diblock [39, 68–71], and ABC triblock [67] copolymers is 
very important for understanding the colloid chemical aspects of polyampholytes. 
At the pH below and above the IEP, spherical micelles consisting of either a non￾charged acidic block surrounded by a positively charged corona or a non-charged 
basic block surrounded by a negatively charged corona are formed. At the IEP, the 
total charge of polyampholyte chains is completely neutralized, and the aggregation 
or phase separation (coacervation) takes place. Annealed polyampholytes in anionic 
and cationic forms exhibit polyelectrolyte character and are fully water-soluble. 
However, most of polyampholytes in the vicinity of the IEP collapse and precipitate 
[28, 72–74]. Solubility or insolubility of random and regular polyampholytes at the 
IEP is determined by the ratio of molecular (uncharged) and zwitterionic (charged) 
forms [75–80]. Block polyampholytes [81–86] and polymeric betaines [56] are 
also known to be insoluble in pure water due to the existence of intragroup, intra￾chain, and interchain association that results in formation of crosslinked network. 
The addition of neutral salts depends on the nature of the anions and cations and 
may narrow the insoluble region and cause full solubility [12–14, 42]. Full or part 
dissolution of random [64], comb-type [42], diblock [87], and triblock [12] polyam￾pholytes at the IEP on addition of a 1:1 salt type was demonstrated. Polyampholyte 
solutions can display a complex phase diagram strongly affected by the duality 
between repulsive (polyelectrolyte effect) and attractive (polyampholyte effect) 
electrostatic interactions, the type and concentration of added salts, temperature, 
and polymer concentration. It is argued [88] that the phase separation may be the 
result of intramolecular complexation between oppositely charged chains. The driv￾ing force for such process is the reduction of each chain’s electrostatic self-energy 
and further coalescence of several neutral complex particles, leading to microphase 
separation to minimize the surface energy. The phase diagrams of polyampholytes 
can be plotted in two- or three-dimensional coordinates: polymer concentration–salt 10 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies
concentration [74], ionic strength–pH (at constant polymer concentration) [89], pol￾ymer concentration–pH–salt concentration [78], viscosity–pH–ionic strength [90], 
turbidity–salt concentration [14], and upper (UCST) or lower (LCST) critical solu￾tion temperature–polymer concentration [91]. Equimolar block polyampholyte con￾sisting of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(1-methyl-4-vinylpyridinium 
chloride) (P1M4VPCl) is insoluble at the IEP and dissolves upon addition of KCl 
[92]. With the addition of salt, equimolar phase–separated block polyampholyte 
exhibit a salting-in effect that is consistent with the common behavior of polyam￾pholytes due to electrostatic screening of opposite charges and expanding of ampho￾teric macromolecules similar to neutral chains swollen in good solvent conditions 
[93]. At increasing salt concentration, polyampholytes of any sequence swell until 
reaching an ideal coil size [94]. The amplitude of the salt-induced globule-to-coil 
transition increases with increasing charge blockiness. So does the change in the 
viscosity of dilute polyampholyte solutions, indicating the sequence specificity in 
the antipolyelectrolyte effect. Salt-induced expansion of polyampholyte chains has 
been detected by viscometry, light scattering, single-chain fluorescence correlation 
spectroscopy, and turbidimetry. The latter is based on the propensity of globular 
polyampholytes to aggregation, which diminishes/disappears upon the addition of 
salt, provoking the globule-to-coil transition in them. Antipolyelectrolyte behavior 
has also been reported for polyampholyte/polyzwitterion brushes and gels, which 
swell in response to the increasing concentration of salt. Phase diagram of the aque￾ous solution of PMAA-b-P1M4VPCl (45:55 mol.%) in the vicinity of the IEP is 
demonstrated in Figure 1.2 [92].
The insolubility of PMAA-b-P1M4VPCl in aqueous solution takes place in the 
range of pH between 2.8 and 6.0 due to the formation of globular intramacromolecular 
FIGURE 1.2 Phase diagram of PMAA-b-P1M4VPCl (45:55 mol.%) in aqueous solution.

complexes (intra-MMC) between the anionic and cationic blocks. An increase of the 
ionic strength (µ) of the solution adjusted by the addition of KCl leads to a nar￾rowing of the precipitation region, and at µ = 0.2–0.4 mol·L-1 KCl, the block poly￾ampholyte is entirely dissolved. Dissolution of equimolar block polyampholyte is 
due to screening of the oppositely charged blocks by KCl, which leads to unfold￾ing of globule to coil conformation. Precipitation of PMAA-b-P1M4VPCl again at 
µ > 0.4 mol·L-1 can be explained by the “salting-out” effect. Thus, the equimolar 
block polyampholytes exhibit both low (LCSSC) and upper critical soluble salt con￾centration (UCSSC), as shown in Figure 1.2, similar to LCST and UCST. 
According to theoretical predictions [95], for isolated chains, a globular structure 
is generally proposed to occur for polyampholytes that display symmetric proportion 
of oppositely charged units, while a tadpole conformation is proposed for asymmet￾ric polyampholytes. The solution behavior of the base-rich asymmetric diblock poly￾ampholyte PDMAEMA86-b-PAA24 by employing mainly light-scattering techniques 
was evaluated, focusing on the pH range where both blocks are effectively charged 
and, hence, attractive and repulsive electrostatic forces are simultaneously acting for 
the intermolecular aggregation process [89]. When the block polyampholyte has the 
excess of anionic or cationic blocks, its nucleus consists of hydrophobic intra-MMC 
“core” surrounded by anionic (or cationic) hydrophilic “shell” protecting it from 
precipitation and preserving the whole macromolecules in water-soluble state [89]. 
Polydehydroalanine (PDha) obtained by simultaneous orthogonally deprotecting 
of poly(tert-butoxycarbonylaminoacrylate) belongs to an annealed polyampholyte 
featuring both an -NH2 and a -COOH in every repeat unit and represents a rather 
high charge density [96]. Various hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups can be incor￾porated into PDha-based structure to increase the stimuli responsivity and versatility 
of pristine polymer. The synthesis and solution behavior of PDha itself, graft and 
block copolymers containing an amphoteric poly(dehydroalanine) (PDha) segment 
and either a hydrophobic poly(styrene) (PS) block, grafted NIPAM, or hydrophilic 
poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) block was reported in [97, 98]. Thermoresponsive NIPAM 
was grafted with pH-dependent charge and metal ion complexation of the PDha 
backbone, resulting in triple-responsive graft copolymers [97]. Both PDha-g-NI￾PAM50 and PDha-g-NIPAM95 are chelated with metal ions (Cu2+, Pb2+, and Co2+) 
and stabilize the silver nanoparticles AgNPs. No cloud points were detected at pH 7 
and above for PDha-g-NIPAAm50, which is prescribed to electrostatic repulsion of 
the negatively charged carboxylates along the PDha backbone. However, in case of 
PDha-g-NIPAAm95 at pH 7, a cloud point temperature (TCP) of 37°C was observed. 
Upon decreasing the pH to 6, the TCP became apparent for PDha-g-NIPAAm50, which 
decreases from 43 to 28°C at pH 5 as a result of partial protonation of the carbox￾ylic groups. With the solution properties of amphiphilic PS30-b-PDha40 dissolved in 
water by short heating to 80°C at a concentration of C  =  0.1 g·L−1 after cooling 
down, a turbid solution was obtained, which is ascribed to the micellization of PS30-
b-PDha40. The core of these aggregates is formed by the hydrophobic PS block, and 
the corona is formed by zwitterionic PDha under these conditions. Subsequent DLS 
measurements revealed the presence of micelles with a hydrodynamic radius of 51 
nm, as well as some larger aggregates above 200 nm in radius. Additional cryo-TEM 
measurements revealed the presence of aggregates with a diameter of 67± 10 nm 12 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
(measurement of 50 particles), being in relatively good agreement with the size 
regime obtained from DLS experiments. 
A novel amphoteric aliphatic polycarbonate developed by authors in [99] exhibits 
a pH-tunable self-aggregation feature, leading to various aggregation states, includ￾ing precipitated agglomerate, well-dispersed positively or negatively charged nano￾particles, and displays minimal cytotoxicity with respect to 293T and HeLa cells. At 
low pH <3.5, the copolymer is self-aggregated into positively charged nanoparticles 
with average hydrodynamic size about 85–100 nm and a narrow size distribution 
(SD) of about 0.11–0.20. TEM images indicated that the nanoparticles were well 
dispersed as individual regular spheres with a size of ca. 35 nm. At pH >8.7, the 
average size of the formed negatively charged nanoparticles was about 180–200 nm 
(SD = 0.12 ~ 0.28), determined by DLS, and was ca. 70 nm by TEM. Within the 
intermediate region, for example, pH between 3.5 and 8.7 corresponding to the IEP, 
the polymer precipitated from the solution. 
The pH-dependent solution and aggregation behavior of diblock PLLys24−b-PL￾Glu24 and alternating P(Lys-Glu)24 polyampholyte brushes [100] and ABC-type 
PEO42−b-PLLys61−b-PLGlu62 triblock copolymer comprising cationic and anionic 
polypeptide segments were studied in pure water and saline solution [44]. The pH 
response of the polyampholyte brushes was found to depend sensitively on the mon￾omer sequence. The degree of ionization, brush height, and chain shape were found 
to increase with block size, with diblock sequences exhibiting the most pronounced 
pH response. Such behavior in polyampholyte brush arises from attractive intrachain 
interactions between oppositely charged blocks that result in partial backfolding of 
the chains. For PEO42−b-PLLys61−b-PLGlu62 triblock copolymer, stable solutions 
were prepared at low and high pH, while precipitation occurred at intermediate 
pH 4.5−10.5. PLGlu adopts a non-charged α-helical conformation at low pH and a 
charged random coil conformation at high pH. Contrary to this, PLLys forms a ran￾dom coil at low pH and turns into an α-helix at high pH. Thus, at either low or high 
pH, there should be half the proportion of polypeptide segment adopting random coil 
conformation and half adopting α-helical structure. At an intermediate pH range of 
~4.5−10.5, there is evidence for the existence of β-sheet, as indicated by the negative 
CD peak absorption with single minimum at ~218 nm. The aggregation behavior 
is controlled by the block sequence and position of the hydrophobic helix block; 
vesicles form when the helix block is located at the chain end, whereas single chains 
are stable when the helix middle block can be wrapped by the two outer hydrophilic 
blocks and shielded from the water phase (resembling tertiary structure formation in 
proteins). 
1.2 QUENCHED POLYAMPHOLYTES (QPA) OR POLYZWITTERIONS 
The quenched or strongly charged polyampholytes represent amphoteric macromol￾ecules consisting of static positive and negative charges that slightly depend on pH. 
The extreme limits of the charge imbalance and balance in polyampholytes refect 
polyelectrolytes with either entirely cationic or anionic monomers, with neutraliz￾ing counterions and polyzwitterions having opposing charges within each monomer, 
resulting in a net neutral charge of the molecule. Linear and crosslinked quenched Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 13 
QPA or zwitterionic polymers exhibit salt-tolerant [101], thermal-resistant and 
shear-stable [102], self-healing [103–105], antifouling [101, 102, 106, 107], self￾assembling [108–111], and stimuli-responsive [112–114] properties that provide 
broad impact as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) [115, 116] and drag reduction agents 
[117, 118], structural biomaterials [119], controlled delivery systems [120, 121], 
energy storage devices [122], supercapacitors [123], actuators [124], etc. Synthetic 
protocol of QPA includes the conventional free radical copolymerization (CFRP) 
of charged monomers [101, 125–132], polymerization in microemulsion [133–139], 
polymerization of anionic–cationic monomer pairs without counterions [140] or 
zwitterionic monomers [141], and reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer 
(RAFT) polymerization [114, 142–144] that was intensively developed in the last 
years. The QPAs prepared in solution have a tendency to alternate between positively 
and negatively charged monomers, while those prepared by means of a microemul￾sion polymerization allow to produce very high-molecular-weight copolymers (up 
to 1·107) that are more homogeneous in composition, with reduced probability of 
continuous sequences of monomers with the same charge in the macromolecular 
chain. The RAFT-controlled radical polymerization technique produces both ran￾dom and block copolymers with a low molecular weight and narrow polydispersity 
index (PDI). Recently, authors [145] introduced a new type of zwitterionic polymer, 
so-called poly(ylides), in particular, poly(sulfur ylides), in which the negative charge 
is adjacent to the positive charge. It is expected that poly(ylides) offer a great poten￾tial, possessing strong dipole moment, chemical versatility, and strong electrostatic 
interactions. 
The electrostatic interactions between the charged monomeric units of polyam￾pholytes are of primary interest because the solution properties of QPA depend on 
charge density, charge balance, charge spacing and distribution, as well as ionic 
strength of the solution adjusted by low-molecular-weight salts. In this context, the 
nature of the salts following the Hoffmeister series can determine the conformation 
and hydrodynamic size of QPA as a function of ionic strength [146]. Another specifc 
property of QPA is antipolyelectrolyte effect in response to salt addition [125–127]. 
Charge-balanced and charge-unbalanced QPAs consisting of “core” (polyampholyte 
regime) and “shell” (polyelectrolyte regime) structure show antagonism in aqueous 
salt solution [147, 148]. The addition of low-molecular-weight salts tends to shrink 
the “shell” part (polyelectrolyte region) and to swell the “core” part (polyampholyte 
region). Such antagonism between polyelectrolyte (“shell”) and polyampholyte 
(“core”) effects can take place at relatively high ionic strengths. According to liter￾ature survey, the QPAs are a less-studied subject in comparison with annealed poly￾ampholytes [149–151] and polymeric betaines [152]. 
The dilute solution properties of copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpro￾pyldimethylammonium chloride and sodium salt of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpro￾panesulfonate (AMPDAC-AMPS) have been studied as a function of copolymer 
composition, temperature, time, pH, and added low-molecular-weight electrolytes 
[125–129]. Equimolar copolymers display a minimal viscosity in pure water and a 
maximal one in concentrated salt solutions. As the copolymer compositions deviate 
from an equimolar, charge imbalances increase the hydrodynamic volume of macro￾molecules. Corpart and Candau [133, 137] studied aqueous salt solution properties 14 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
of a high-charge-density polyampholytes derived from 2-methacryloyloxyethyltri￾methylammonium chloride and sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate 
(METMAC-AMPS). Solubility and viscometry experiments show that the solu￾tion behavior of METMAC-AMPS is essentially controlled by two parameters: the 
net electrical charge, fxed by the copolymer composition, and the ionic strength. 
Copolymers with a strong net charge behave more like polyelectrolytes. At interme￾diate copolymer compositions, the sample behavior depends on the duality between 
repulsive (polyelectrolyte effect) and attractive (polyampholyte effect) electrostatic 
interactions. Depending on the ionic strength, either one of these antagonist effects 
will dominate. The same authors [136] also reported the study of low-charge-density 
polyampholytes METMAC-AMPS with incorporated acrylamide (AAm) monomer. 
The infuence of added salt on the solubility as well as on the hydrodynamic, con￾formational, and morphological characteristics of the terpolymer was analyzed. The 
phase diagram of METMAC-AAm-AMPS was built at two conditions: (1) when the 
polymer concentration (CP) is fxed and the salt concentration (CS) varies; (2) when 
the CS is constant and the CP changes. At a low CS, attractive electrostatic interac￾tions are dominant and the chains collapse. At high CS, when the Debye–Huckel 
length becomes short enough that the coulomb interactions are screened out, then 
the excluded volume interactions are dominant and the polymer has a swollen or 
Gaussian conformation, depending on the quality of the solvent. Below a critical 
salt content, the chains with zero or small net charge precipitate, due to the polyam￾pholyte effect. Note that the mass polydispersity can also play a considerable role 
since the collapse–swollen transition is very sensitive to the molecular weight of 
the polyampholyte [153]. Authors [154] discussed multichain effects in polyam￾pholyte solutions of fnite concentration and found that the existing single-chain 
theories are limited to exponentially small concentrations, if the sample contains net 
charges of both signs. It has been shown that the QPAs have a strong tendency to 
form neutral complexes and to precipitate. Stretched chains almost play no role in the 
ideal case of a neutral sample with nearly symmetric charge counterions that accu￾mulate in the supernatant together with charged, elongated chains, and the behavior 
of the solution is dominated by “impurities.” 
Solution properties of equimolar QPA prepared from AMPS and 3-acrylamid 
opropyltrimethylammonium chloride (APTAC) via RAFT (abbreviated as 
P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT) and conventional free radical polymerization (CRFP) 
(abbreviated as P(AMPS-APTAC)CRFP) were compared with stoichiometric poly￾electrolyte complexes (abbreviated as (PAMPS-PAPTAC)SPEC) obtained from ani￾onic and cationic polyelectrolyte pairs, for example, PAMPS and PAPTAC [142] 
(Figure  1.3). The polymerization degree of equimolar P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT was 
equal to 41, 89, and 117. The average molecular mass of P(AMPS-PAPTAC)CRFP was 
724 times higher than that of P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT. The polydispersity index (PDI) 
of P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT was narrow and in the range of 1.14–1.44, whereas the PDI 
of P(AMPS-PAPTAC)CRFP was broad and equal to 16.2. 
In pure water, the mixture of PAMPS and PAPTAC precipitates, the QPA obtained 
by CRFP is turbid, and the QPA prepared by RAFT is water-soluble. The reason is 
that in pure water, the (PAMPS-PAPTAC)SPEC is stoichiometrically charge-neutral￾ized and becomes fully hydrophobic; P(AMPS-APTAC)CRFP forms a large aggregate Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 15

stabilized by continuous sequences (microblocks) of oppositely charged monomers. 
However, such colloidal aggregates are prevented from precipitation and preserved 
in an aqueous solution by “loops” and “dangles” consisting of cationic and anionic 
monomers. In case of P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT, the probability of formation of inte￾rionic aggregates (Nagg =  2–3) between oppositely charged monomers is minimal 
because the pendant sulfonate anions and quaternary ammonium cations are ran￾domly distributed and the molecular weights of polymers prepared by RAFT are 
low. In this context, it would be interesting to determine the critical molecular mass 
of QPA that is transformed from molecular dispersion to colloidal solution. In aque￾ous NaCl, both P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT and P(AMPS-APTAC)CRFP adopt a unimer 
state due to screening of electrostatic interactions by low-molecular-weight ani￾ons and cations. The turbidity of P(AMPS-APTAC)CRFP with high molecular mass 
disappears in aqueous solutions of NaCl. The values of hydrodynamic radius (Rh), 
light-scattering intensity (LSI), and zeta potential (ζ) of P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT and 
P(AMPS-APTAC)CRFP depend on the NaCl concentration. In aqueous solutions 
of NaCl (Cs = 0.01–2.0 mol·L-1), the values of Rh are in the range of 2.7–4.8 nm 
for P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT, while the values of the Rh and LSI of P(AMPS-AP￾TAC)CRFP decrease with an increase of NaCl concentration up to 0.1 mol·L-1. The 
values of zeta potential for both P(AMPS-APTAC)RAFT and P(AMPS-APTAC)CRFP 
are close to zero, irrespective of NaCl concentration. This is due to the complete 
neutralization of sulfonate anions and quaternary ammonium cations of macromol￾ecules. The behavior of diblock QPA composed of anionic block PAMPS82 (where 
the subscript 82 indicates the degree of polymerization) and cationic blocks PAP￾TACn (where n = 37, 83, and 181) (abbreviated as PAMPS82-PAPTACn) was stud￾ied in aqueous and aqueous salt solutions [155]. It was shown that the equimolar 
PAMPS82-PAPTAC83 precipitates in pure water due to the formation of intra-pol￾yelectrolyte complexes (Intra-PEC) between anionic and cationic blocks, while 
PAMPS82-PAPTAC37 and PAMPS82-PAPTAC181 containing the excess of anionic and 
cationic blocks are fully water-soluble. It is supposed that in case of PAMPS82-PAP￾TAC37 and PAMPS82-PAPTAC181, the equal numbers of oppositely charged PAMPS 
and PAPTAC blocks are involved into the formation of a “core,” while the excess of  
16 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
PAMPS and PAPTAC blocks is replaced in a “shell.” It is interesting to compare the 
behaviors of diblock PAMPS82-PAPTACn with random QPA based on copolymers 
of AMPSm-co-APTACn (where the subscript denotes the molar concentration of ani￾onic and cationic monomers and corresponds to m = 25, 50, and 75 mol.%, n = 75, 
50, and 25 mol.%, respectively) in aqueous salt solutions [147, 148]. Equimolar or 
balanced QPA prepared by RAFT and CRFP are insoluble in pure water but dissolve 
in saline water. The non-equimolar or unbalanced QPA, to whom belong PAMPS82-
PAPTAC37 and PAMPS82-PAPTAC181, synthesized by RAFT, and AMPS25-co￾APTAC75 and AMPS75-co-APTAC25, prepared by CRFP, are fully water-soluble. In 
aqueous solutions, the zeta potentials of PAMPS82-PAPTAC37 and PAMPS82-PAPTAC181 
are equal to −15.6 mV and +22.8 mV, respectively. The zeta potentials of AMPS25-co￾APTAC75 and AMPS75-co-APTAC25 are correspondingly positive (ζ = +50 mV) and 
negative (ζ = −40 mV), while the balanced QPA PAMPS82-PAPTAC83 and AMPS50-
co-APTAC50 are in an electroneutral state (ζ = 0). The different behavior of unbal￾anced (PAMPS82-PAPTAC37 and PAMPS82-PAPTAC181, AMPS25-co-APTAC75, and 
AMPS75-co-APTAC25) and balanced (PAMPS82-PAPTAC83, AMPS50-co-APTAC50) 
QPA, upon an increase of the ionic strength, is illustrated in Figure  1.4. Increas￾ing the ionic strength screens the electrostatic repulsion between uniformly charged 
groups, if polyelectrolyte effect dominates and shields the electrostatic attraction 
between oppositely charged monomers, if polyampholyte effect prevails (Table 1.6). 
In the former case, the macromolecular chain contracts, whereas in the latter case, 
it expands. 
The viscometric data reveal that in aqueous solutions of KCl, the intrinsic vis￾cosities of AMPS25-co-APTAC75 and AMPS75-co-APTAC25 decrease, while the 
intrinsic viscosity of AMPS50-co-APTAC50 increases, demonstrating antipolyelec￾trolyte behavior. The addition of low-molecular-weight salts to AMPS50-co-AP￾TAC50 shields the electrostatic attraction between the opposite charges and results 
in increasing the intrinsic viscosity. In aqueous solution, the conformation of unbal￾anced QPA PAMPS82-PAPTAC37, PAMPS82-PAPTAC181, AMPS25-co-APTAC75, 
AMPS75-co-APTAC25 can be considered as “core” and “shell” structure, where the 
“core” part exists in polyampholyte regime, and the “shell” part represents a polyelec￾trolyte regime. The addition of low-molecular-weight salts tends to shrink the “shell” 
part (polyelectrolyte region) and to swell the “core” part (polyampholyte region). 
Such antagonism may cause competition between the polyelectrolyte (“shell”) and 
polyampholyte (“core”) effects at relatively high ionic strengths. All three QPA 
PAMPS82-PAPTAC37, PAMPS82-PAPTAC181, and PAMPS82-PAPTAC83 exhibit a 
thermoresponsive character and show the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) 
at defnite polymer concentration (Cp) and NaCl concentration. Phase transitions for 
PAMPS82-PAPTAC83, PAMPS82-PAPTAC37, and PAMPS82-PAPTAC181 are observed 
for [NaCl]  =  0.5–0.75, 0.8–1.1, and 0.7–0.9  M, respectively. For PAMPS82-PAP￾TAC83 at 0.9 M NaCl and Cp = 10, 5, and 1 g·L-1, the phase transition temperature is 
shifted to a higher value with decreasing Cp (Figure 1.5)

of NaCl concentration, polymer concentration, and molecular mass of polymers 
[113]. It was established by the measurement of the turbidity (%T), hydrodynamic 
radius (Rh), light-scattering intensity (LSI), optical microscopy (OM), and fuores￾cence probe (FP) technique that the UCST of P(VBTAC-NaSS)n is shifted to higher 
temperature with decreasing NaCl and increasing polymer concentration (Cp) and 
degree of polymerization (DP). Table  1.7 summarizes the theoretically calculated 
Mn, polydispersity index (PDI), hydrodynamic radius (Rh), and zeta potential (ζ) of 
P(VBTAC-NaSS)20 and P(VBTAC-NaSS)97 at Cp = 2.0 g·L-1 and 70°C in 0.1 M and 
1.0 M NaCl. 
Such small Rh values indicate that in aqueous salt solutions, the polymers above 
the UCST exist in unimer states. The formation of spherical globules with radius 
of gyration Rg ~ 2.5 nm was directly visualized by feld emission scanning electron 
microscope (FE-SEM) images for charge-balanced polyampholyte hydrogels made 
of sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate (NaVBS) and [3-(methacryloylamino)propyl] 
trimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC) [156, 157]. The globules have a spherical 
shape and consist of polymer-rich domains, polymer-poor interglobular regions, and 
clusters. Thus, the existence of the globular structure for QPA irrespectively in dilute 
solution or in gel state is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of authors in 
[88, 153, 158, 159], developed for charge-balanced polyampholytes. 
The zeta potential values of P(VBTAC-NaSS)20 and P(VBTAC-NaSS)97 above the 
UCST are close to zero and in favor of the electroneutrality of QPA [113]. The polar￾ity of the hydrophobic domains formed by P(VBTAC-NaSS)n below and above the

UCST was evaluated with the help of fuorescent probe peptide nucleic acid (PNA). 
The most commonly used luminescent labels to evaluate the microenvironment and 
conformational transitions of charged macromolecules are pyrene and naphthalene. 
However, they do not possess any stimuli-responsive character. In contrast, a series 
of quinoline-labelled QPA composed of AMPS and methacrylamidopropyltrimeth￾ylammonium chloride (MAPTAC) exhibits pH-controlled color change that is tuned 
by macromolecular charge [160]. 
Anionic diblock copolymer (AMPS-APTAC)91-(AMPS)67 and cationic diblock 
copolymer (AMPS-APTAC)91-(APTAC)88 represent the charge-balanced QPA sur￾rounded by either anionic or cationic blocks [109]. One can suppose that the “core” 
of such copolymers, composed of cationic and anionic monomers (polyampholyte 
regime), forms intra-PEC, while the “shell” part bears the excess of either positive 
or negative charges (polyelectrolyte regime). The behavior of hydrophobically mod￾ifed QPA is different from that of ordinary QPA. The introduction of hydrophobic 
cationic monomer N,N-dimethyloctadecyl allyl ammonium chloride (DOAC) and 
anionic monomer sodium 4-styrenesulfonate (SSS) together with nonionic monomer 
acrylamide (AAm) into macromolecular chain leads to self-assembling, accompa￾nied by intra- and intermacromolecular associates in dependence of critical associa￾tion concentration (CAC) that is around 0.165–0.190 wt.% [161] (Figure 1.6). 
Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) images of DOAC-SSS￾AAm solutions at 0.12 wt.% (below CAC) and 0.3 wt.% (above CAC) show that 
at DOAC-SSS-AAm = 0.12 wt.%, the network structure has a sparse and scattered 
nature due to the formation of intramacromolecular aggregates. At DOAC-SSS￾AAm = 0.30 wt.%, the network structure has a dense honeycomb structure stabilized 
by intermacromolecular hydrophobic association. Correspondingly, at DOAC-SSS￾AAm < CAC, the solution has low apparent viscosity; at DOAC-SSS-AAm > CAC, 
the solution has high apparent viscosity. In aqueous salt solutions, the apparent vis￾cosity of DOAC-SSS-AAm increses, demonstrating the antipolyelectrolyte charac￾ter. The salt, temperature, and shearing resistance of DOAC-SSS-AAm suggests this 
hydrophobically modifed QPA is applicable for EOR. 
Acrylamide-based QPAs were thoroughly studied by McCormick et al. [84, 101, 
162]. The dilute solution properties of the copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl 20 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies
propyldimethylammonium chloride (AMPDAC) and sodium salt of 2-acrylamide￾2-methylpropanesulfonate (AMPS) have been studied as a function of copolymer 
composition, temperature, time, pH, and added low-molecular-weight electrolytes 
[125–131]. Equimolar copolymers display a minimal viscosity in pure water and a max￾imal one in concentrated salt solutions. As the copolymer compositions deviate from 
an equimolar, charge imbalances increase the hydrodynamic volume of macromole￾cules. Copolymers of acrylamide (AAm), sodium 3-acrylamido-3-methylbutanoate 
(AMB), and (3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (APTAC), called 
the poly(acrylamide-co-sodium 3-acrylamido-3-methylbutanoate-co-[3-acrylamido 
propyl] trimethylammonium chloride) (AMBATAC) series [127–130], belong to 
low-charge-density polyampholyte terpolymers and exhibit greater viscosifying 
ability than high-charge-density ampholytic copolymers. They are ideal candidates

for electrolyte-tolerant rheology modifers, drag-reducing agents, coagulants, and 
focculants because of their ability to maintain high solution viscosities in saline 
media. The terpolymer compositions of AMBATAC were determined by 13C NMR 
spectroscopy and elemental analysis of counterions (Na+ and Cl−). The molecular 
weights (MWs) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) were determined via size exclu￾sion chromatography/multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC–MALLS). Data from 
the SEC–MALLS analysis were used to analyze the radius of gyration/molecular 
weight (Rg –M) relationships and the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada intrinsic viscos￾ity/molecular weight ([η]–M) relationships for the terpolymers. The values of a in 
Mark–Houwink–Sakurada equation [η] = KMKS·Ma decrease with increasing charge 
density in the order AMBATAC-2.5–2.5 > AMBATAC-5–5 > AMBATAC-7.5–7.5 
> AMBATAC-10–10. This is attributed to negative excluded volume effects (col￾lapse due to strong electrostatic attractions between positive and negative charges 
and increased backbone hydrophobicity) best shown for AMBATAC-10–10 sample. 
The pH-responsive solution viscosities of AMBATAC-5–5 and AMBATAC-10–10 
polyampholytes were compared with the viscosity behavior of polybetaine copoly￾mers of AAm and 3-(3-acrylamidopropyldimethylammonio)propionate (AMDAP) 
[163]. In deionized water (DI), the pH-dependent viscosity of AMBATAC-5–5 and 
AMBATAC-10–10 polyampholytes is minimal in the vicinity of the IEP (pHIEP is 
around 5.5 and 6.4), while polybetainic AMDAP-5 and AMDAP-10 copolymers do 
not show any pronounced minimum viscoity that is charateristic for the IEP. The 
differences in the solution behavior observed for the AMBATAC polyampholytes 
and AMDAP polybetaines can be attributed to stronger electrostatic interactions and 
increased chain stiffness in case of the AMBATAC. Moreover, the AMBATAC-5–5 
and AMBATAC-10–10 terpolymers exhibit signifcantly higher apparent pKa values 
(pKa = 5.13 and 5.73, respectively) than the AMDAP-5 and AMDAP-10 (pKa = 4.24 
and 4.57, respectively) copolymers, and this indicates the increased acidity of the 
COOH group in AMBATAC in comparison with the COOH group of AMDAP. 
Although the AMBATAC terpolymers and AMDAP copolymers possess very similar 
cationic charge densities upon the complete protonation of the COO− groups, the 
low-pH viscosities are much greater for the polyampholytes than for the polybetaines. 
The higher viscosities of the AMBATAC terpolymers at low pHs can be attributed 
to the chain-stiffening effects of the AMB functionality. Low-charge-density QPA 
composed of AAm, APTAC, and the amino acid–derived monomers (e.g., N-acryloyl 
valine (AVA), N-acryloyl alanine (AAL), and N-acryloyl aspartate (AAS)) was pre￾pared via free radical polymerization in aqueous media and in 0.5 M NaCl to yield 
terpolymers with random charge distributions and homogeneous compositions [164]. 
Potentiometric titration studies of AAm90-AVA5-APTAC5, AAm90-AAL5-APTAC5, 
AAm90-AAS5-APTAC5, AAm90-AVA7-APTAC3, and AAm90-AAL7-APTAC3 pro￾vided apparent pKa values of the terpolymers from which charge density and charge 
asymmetry values were calculated. The pKa values of charge-balanced polyam￾pholytes containing equal number of carboxylate and quaternary ammonium groups 
decrease in the following sequence: AAm90-AVA5-APTAC5 > AAm90-AAL5-APTAC5 
> AAm90-AAS5-APTAC5, at a charge density equal to 9.6± 0.2. The extremely high 
charge asymmetry σN for equmolar AAm90-AAS5-APTAC5 and charge-imbalanced 
polyampholytes is probably due to excess negative charges that come from AAS, 22 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
AVA, and AAL monomers. High-molecular-weight amphoteric terpolymers based 
on AAm, AMPS, and APTAC were prepared using free radical copolymerization in 
an aqueous solution and characterized by 1H NMR, FTIR, GPC, DLS, zeta poten￾tial, and viscometry [165, 166]. The dynamic viscosity of the 0.25 wt.% terpolymer 
solution was found to increase in brine solution containing NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 
from 200 to 300 g·L-1 at 24 and 60°C. The increase of dynamic viscosity with an 
increase in brine salinity is explained by the screening of the electrostatic attraction 
between positively and negatively charged monomers by anions and cations of salts, 
which leads to the expansion of the polymer chain. Increasing the dynamic viscosity 
of the high-molecular-weight terpolymer in brine is favorable for viscosifcation of 
hot reservoir water containing up to 200–300 g·L-1 salts. ABA triblock copolymers 
were designed by controlled radical polymerization using two different zwitterionic 
monomers—sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phos￾phorylcholine (MPC) [167]. They are composed of MPC as the middle block and 
SBMA as the symmetrical end blocks, for example, PSBMA-b-PMPC-b-PSBMA. 
Due to the strong tendency of the sulfobetaine groups to aggregate, the fully zwitte￾rionic triblock copolymers demonstrated a nanostructured self-assembly as well as 
salt and thermal responsiveness in solution. 
1.3 POLYMERIC BETAINES AND/OR POLYZWITTERIONS 
According to IUPAC terminology [168] and defnitions of McCormick [101] and 
Laschewsky [141], polymeric betaines and/or, synonymously, polyzwitterions rep￾resent a unique subclass of polyampholytes containing acid/base or anionic/cationic 
groups on the same pendant monomeric units. Polyzwitterions (or polybetaines) are 
distinguished from common polyampholytes by their inherent fully balanced charge 
without low-molar-mass counterions and a priori by the permanent zero net charge 
[169]. Synthesis, structure, properties, and application aspects of polyzwitterions in 
nanotechnology, biotechnology, and biomedicine as antiscalants, corrosion inhibi￾tors, components in constructing aqueous two-phase systems for separation of var￾ious biomolecules, including proteins, and membrane modifers were reviewed in 
[152, 170–185]. The synthetic protocols and the structure–property relationships 
of polybetaines were comprehensively described in reviews [141, 152, 170–172]; 
therefore, in this section, most of the attention will be paid to acid–base properties, 
conformational change, and solution properties of polybetaines. 
In dependence on the nature of the ionic groups, polymeric betaines may be 
grouped into various subclasses, the most widespread ones being polycarbobetaines 
(PCB), the combination of the quaternary ammonium group with carboxylate group; 
polysulfobetaines (PSB), the combination of the quaternary ammonium group with 
sulfonate group; and polyphosphobetaines (PPB), the combination of the quaternary 
ammonium group with phosphate (phosphinate, phosphonate) group. Among the 
polymeric betaines, the less-considered subject is polysulfabetaines, which, unlike 
polysulfobetaines, combine ammonium with sulfate (-O-SO3
−) moieties [186]. The 
polysulfabetaines show generally even somewhat-higher antifouling activity than 
their polysulfobetaine analogues, though detailed effcacies depend on the individual 
polymer–protein pairs [187]. Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 23
The polyсarbo- and sulfobetaines were first synthesized by Ladenheim and 
Morawetz and by Hart and Timmerman in 1957–1958 [188, 189]. Afterward, Salam￾one et al. [190] quaternized the vinylimidazole by 1,3-propane sultone and obtained 
a series of sulfobetaine polymers. Figure 1.7 demonstrates different arrangements of 
anionic and cationic moieties in polysulfobetaines [191, 192] and polycarbobetaine 
[193]. In case of A, both negative and positive charges are replaced at equidistance 
from the polymer backbone. Position C corresponds to the situation when the neg￾ative charge is placed closer to the main chain in contrast to position D, where the 
cationic group is closer to the skeleton. Case E reflects the position when the positive 
and negative charges are replaced on both sides of the polymer backbone.
The approach developed in [27] for equimolar annealed polyampholytes can 
be applied to a comprehensive analysis of the potentiometric titration data of the 
polycarboxy- and polysulfobetaines derived from N,N-diallyl-N-carboethoxyme￾thylammonium chloride and 3-(N,N-diallylammonio)propanesulfonate [194, 195]. 
These zwitterionic polyelectrolytes can also exist in the form of anionic and cationic 
polyelectrolytes and in an uncharged form in dependence on pH. The transforma￾tion from the uncharged form to the polyzwitterion or vice versa is determined by 
micro- and macroscopic ionization constants. As in the case of the simple amino 
acid glycine, the zwitterionic form of the polycarbobetaine should be more stable 
than its uncharged form because of Kt
 >> 1. The polycationic form might be consid￾ered as a two-base acid having pK a
1 and pK a
2 , which correspond to successive titra￾tion of the COOH and NH+ groups, while the polyanionic form can be considered a 
two-base base with pK b
1 and pK b
2 , which reflect the protonation of tertiary amine N 
groups and carboxylate ions COO–. In its turn, the polyzwitterionic form can serve 
FIGURE 1.7 Different arrangements of anionic and cationic groups in polysulfobetaines 
(A-D) and polycarbobetaine (E).

as both an acid that loses protons and is converted to the polyanion (k12) and as a 
base that binds protons and is transformed to the polycation (k1). The distribution 
of the cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic forms of the polyampholyte calculated 
from the k1 and k12 and the viscosity data show that polybetaine molecules exist in 
the zwitterionic form and as a compact coil in the vicinity of the isoelectric point 
(IEP) (Figure 1.8). Deviation from the IEP leads to the prevalence of the anionic or 
cationic forms and expanding conformations. 
The main distinction between PCB and PSB is the difference in basicity, the car￾boxylate group in PCB being a stronger base than that of the sulfonate group of PSB 
[196, 197]. In aqueous solution, the carboxylate group can be rendered nonionic by 
lowering pH in contrast to the sulfonate group, which remains anionic even at low pH 
due to inherently low pKa. As a result, the reduced viscosity of PCB passes through 
a minimum undergoing polyanion→polyzwitterion→polycation transition as a func￾tion of pH, whereas PSB does not exhibit an enhancement in viscosity at low pH due 
to the weak basicity of the sulfonate group. 
Polybetaines can also be divided into annealed and quenched ones. For most 
of the quenched polybetaines, the sense of the IEP is not applicable due to fully 
charged zwitterionic moieties [152, 170]. The values of the IEP of some annealed 
polybetaines are shown in Table 1.8. Authors [198] combined molecular simulations 
with potentiometric titration and zeta potential experiments to study the ionization 
response of various poly(carbobetaines) PDHa, PDAGA, and PImAA with respect to 
FIGURE 1.8 Distribution curves for the anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic forms of 
polybetaines.

Poly(L-serinyl acrylate)s (PSAs) of controllable molecular weights and low polydis￾persities were synthesized via reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) 
polymerization [199]. Three different PSAs with molecular weights Mn = 21kD, 40kD, 
and 56kD were prepared and denoted as PSA-50, PSA-75, and PSA-100 [193]. The 
pH-responsive behavior of the aqueous PSA solution was evaluated. PSA was solu￾ble and transparent in water at pH <2.3 and pH >3.5, but insoluble and turbid in the 
pH range of 2.3–3.5 due to phase separation. Aqueous solutions of PSA-100, PSA-75, 
and PSA-50 were separately examined by DLS, and the data revealed that beyond the 
pH range of 2.3–3.5 the hydrodynamic diameters of all the PSA samples were ~3 nm, 
which sharply increased to 845, 810, and 750 nm, respectively, in the pH range of 2.3– 
3.5, signifying the polymer chain association to nanogel-like aggregates. The FESEM 
image of PSA-100 clearly showed the spherical aggregates formation with diameters in 
the range of 93–235 nm. All PSAs exhibited an isoelectric point at pH 2.85 and precip￾itated within the pH range 2.3–3.5; the aqueous PSA solution became a two-phase sys￾tem, owing to the formation of insoluble aggregated structure through the electrostatic 
attraction between the pendent cationic ammonium and anionic carboxylate groups 
of PSA. In contrast to PSAs, polymeric betaines based on ethyl 3-aminocrotonate 
and its N-substituted alkyl derivatives obtained by condensation of acetoacetic ester 
with various alkylamines, aminoalcohols, and aminoacids in mild conditions are sol￾uble at the IEP [200–202]. The infuence of pH on the viscosity and electrophoretic 
mobility of PCB based on poly(carboxyethyl 3-aminocrotonate) (PCEAC) shows that 
minimal viscosity and zero mobility are observed at extremely low pH (pHIEP ≈ 2.1) 
and corresponds to the IEP [200, 206]. The “asymmetric” character of chain stretch￾ing and the “anomalous” low magnitude of the IEP (pHIEP ≈ 2.1) may be explained by 
the different accessibility of the carboxylic and secondary amine groups to ionization. 
Carboxylic groups placed far from the polymer main chain can be ionized more easily 
than the secondary amine groups that are close to the main chain and in a hydrophobic   
Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 27 
environment. These results are in good agreement with the electrophoretic data, for 
example, the number of negative charges on the macromolecules is signifcantly higher 
at pH >2 than the number of positive charges at pH <2. The values of Rg, A2, and ηsp/C 
of the PCEAC chains at pH = 2.1 (IEP) and 7.0 are correspondingly in the collapsed and 
expanded state. Increasing the hydrophobicity of polybetaines increases the pH values 
of the IEP in the following order: PCEPAC (pHIEP = 3.1) > PCEEAC (pHIEP = 2.9) > 
PCEMAC (pHIEP = 2.7) > PCEAC (pHIEP = 2.1) [201, 202]. This is probably connected 
with enhancement of hydrophobic interactions between N-alkyl residues (from methyl 
to propyl) that enhance the stabilization of carboxylic groups in favor of molecular state. 
The unique properties of polybetaines are strongly related to the interaction of the oppo￾site charges in aqueous and aqueous salt solutions [170, 171]. One of the features of 
betaine-type polyampholytes is the tendency of the zwitterionic fragments to form intra￾group ionic bonds between neighboring monomer residues, or a head-to-tail intrachain 
stacking within single macromolecules and interchain ion contacts between neighbor￾ing macromolecules. The latter results in the appearance of crosslinked networks [152, 
207]. Addition of salts causes destruction of intragroup, intrachain, and interchain ionic 
bridges due to realization of the antipolyelectrolyte effect [208]. The addition of a small 
amount of salt, at frst, enhances the dissociation of interchain associates. The further 
addition of salt results in chain extension as the intrachain association is broken up. In a 
salt-free solution, the PSB chain carries effective charges due to asymmetric adsorption 
of H+ and OH− and adopts a contractive conformation due to the intrachain electrostatic 
attraction. As the concentration (CS) of NaCl increases, the effective charges are gradu￾ally screened in the range CS <10–3 M, leading the interchain electrostatic repulsion to 
decrease. Further increase of the salt concentration leads the PSB chain to be recharged 
due to the asymmetric adsorption of Na+ and Cl−, and the interchain electrostatic repul￾sion increases. In the range CS >0.1 M, the effective charges are gradually screened, the 
interchain electrostatic repulsion decreases, the chain expands to a random coil, and the 
polyzwitterion exhibits anti-polyelectrolyte behavior. 
The coil-to-globule-to-coil conformational transitions of a zwitterionic polymer, 
poly(2-[(N-2-methacryloyloxyethyl-N,N-dimethyl)ammonio]acetate) (PCB2), in water, 
ethanol, and water–ethanol mixed solvents were compared with those of poly[2-(meth￾acryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine] (PMPC) [209]. PCB2 showed cononsolvency 
in water–ethanol mixed solvents with specifc ethanol volume fractions. The re-entrant 
square well-type sharp coil–globule transition was reproduced by a statistical mechanical 
model involving competitive hydrogen bonding and cooperative hydration. PCB2 showed 
a broader cononsolvency range than PMPC because of its lower association constants of 
water and ethanol and the marked competition for hydrogen bonding. The zwitterion￾specifc cononsolvency characteristics were rationalized with the electrostatic potentials 
and van der Waals energies of the zwitterions. A double hydrophilic diblock copolymer 
comprising a cononsolvency active poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (PCB2) and inac￾tive poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) (PEtOxn -b-PCB2m) dissolved in water and etha￾nol but aggregated in their mixtures with a specifc ethanol volume fraction (fEtOH) range 
(0.76–0.96), owing to the cononsolvency of PCB2 chains [210]. In water–ethanol mixed 
solvents, the PEtOxn -b-PCB2m exhibited well-ordered mesoscopic lattice structures in 
dependence on fEtOH and the polymer concentration. The most ordered lattice structure was 
observed at fEtOH = 0.5–0.6, where PCB2 chains aggregated moderately. The controlled 28 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
microphase separation, morphology transition, and collapse of biocompatible mesophases 
can pave the way for the design of stimuli-responsive molecular compartments. 
Modifcation of poly[(ethyl 2-(imidazole-1yl)acrylate] (PEImA) by either alkyla￾tion of the imidazole moiety or hydrolysis of the ethyl ester leads to the formation of 
a polyzwitterion—poly[2-(imidazole-1yl)acrylic acid] (PImA), poly(2-(3-methylim￾idazolium-1-yl)acrylic acid) (PMeImAA), or a poly(ionic liquid) poly[(ethyl 
2-(3-methylimidazolium-1-yl iodide acrylate)] (PEMeImA) [203]. The IEP of 
PImAA was not determined probably due to partial precipitation between pH 2.2 and 
6.8. The ionization states of polybetaines PImAA, PDha, and PDAGA were studied 
by molecular simulations, potentiometric titrations, and zeta potential measurements 
in order to determine how the net charge per monomer and the ionization states of 
individual acidic and basic groups differ from the ideal (Henderson–Hasselbalch) 
behavior. By comparing the experimental results with theoretical predictions, it was 
shown that molecular simulations can predict and explain the origin of the differ￾ences between the effective and bare pKa values of individual titratable groups. 
The glass-forming ability of a series of specially synthesized polysulfobetaines, 
in particular, sulfobetaine acrylate, ethyl sulfobetaine methacrylate, sulfobetaine 
vinylimidazole, sulfobetaine 4-vinylpyridine, sulfobetaine methacrylate, and sul￾fobetaine methacrylamide, was studied by fast-scanning calorimetry (FSC) over a 
large range of cooling rates, 10–4,000 K/s, minimizing thermal degradation of the 
polyzwitterions [211]. The rate dependence of the limiting fctive temperatures was 
ftted to the Williams–Landel–Ferry model, from which the polyzwitterion dynamic 
fragility was determined for the frst time. Dynamic fragility was low, ranging from 
41 to 110, depending on the chemical structure of polysulfobetaines, which allows 
classifcation of this series of polyzwitterions as moderate to relatively strong pol￾ymeric glass formers. Their high glass transition temperatures, combined with low 
fragilities, indicate that polyzwitterions are unique among polymeric glass formers. 
This behavior arises from the formation of inter- and intrachain dipole–dipole 
crosslinks, which cause more dense molecular packing and cohesion. 
1.4 POLYBETAINIC (OR POLYZWITTERIONIC) SOAPS 
Laschewsky et  al. [212–219] have reported on the characterization of polybetainic 
soaps, which combine the behavior of polyzwitterions and micellar polymers. The 
zwitterionic polysoaps can adopt (1) “head-type,” (2) “mid-tail-type,” (3) and “tail-end￾type” geometry [216]. Zwitterionic polysoaps, due to the hydrophobic interactions, 
stand between classical, homogeneously dissolved polymers and extensively self￾organized but phase-separated systems, such as monolayers and vesicles of polymeric 
lipids [220]. The viscosity of the cationic or anionic polysoaps exhibits a polyelectrolyte 
character, whereas the viscosity of zwitterionic polysoaps behaves as an uncharged pol￾ymer [221]. The unusually low viscosities of zwitterionic polysoaps are attributed to the 
intramolecular aggregation of the hydrophobic side chains, keeping the hydrodynamic 
radius small. X-ray studies of the zwitterionic polysoaps reveal the formation of super￾structures in the bulk. Both electrostatic attractions between ammonium and carboxylate 
groups and hydrophobic interactions between long fexible spacers are the driving force 
of superstructure formation [218]. The surface activity and solubilization capacity of Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 29 
amphoteric polysoaps have been studied [212]. The surface activities for polysoaps of 
the “tail-end” geometry are generally somewhat lower than for analogous of the “head” 
geometry. The surface activity of zwitterionic polysoaps is diminished by added salt 
due to their “antipolyelectrolyte” character. The missing critical micelle concentration 
(CMC) is also characteristic for zwitterionic polysoaps and has been attributed to intra￾molecular aggregation of the hydrophobic groups in the polymers. The sequence to sol￾ubilize hydrophobic dyes is “mid-tail” > “head” > “tail-end” geometry. 
Interaction of acetoacetic ester existing in keto-enol tautomeric forms with 
alkylamines (RNH2) produces either enamine or imine tautomeric forms [200] 
(Structure 1.2). 
In its turn, the enamine tautomeric form is additionally stabilized by intramolecu￾lar hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of pseudo-aromatic rings as a result of 
conjugation of C=C and C=O bonds with participation of lone electron pairs of nitro￾gen atoms [222]. According to the literature data [223] and quantum chemical cal￾culations [224], the energetically more favorable state is the trans-conformation and 
enamine tautomer, because the relative energetic stability of the enamine tautomeric 
form (ΔE  =  −19.67 kcal·mol-1) is lower than the imine tautomeric one (ΔE  =  0). 
Moreover, it is suggested that the lengthening of alkyl radicals promotes shifting of 
the tautomeric equilibrium to the energetically more favorable enamine form. The 
addition of acrylic (or methacrylic acid) to N-substituted 3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates 
breaks the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and, via the Michael addition reaction, 
produces the intermediate products which are able to be polymerized spontaneously 
or in the presence of initiators [201, 225–234] (Structure 1.3).

STRUCTURE 1.3 Formation of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates via the 
Michael addition reaction 
Polymeric betaines containing long alkyl chains (C12H25, C13H27, C14H29, C16H33 
and C18H37) were characterized by FTIR, 13C NMR, GPC, DLS, TEM, viscome￾try, and zeta potential measurements [201]. According to zeta potential measure￾ments, the isoelectric point (IEP) of 0.01% aqueous solution of poly[carboxyethyl 
3-(tridecyl)aminocrotonate] corresponds to рН ~3.4. At the same time, its minimal 
size obtained from the DLS data is around of рН 2.5. The IEP of 0.01% aqueous solu￾tion of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(octadecyl)aminocrotonate] according to zeta potential 
and DLS measurements corresponds to рНIEP 2.7 and 2.9, respectively. This discrep￾ancy is probably connected with extremely high hydrophobicity of poly[carboxyethyl 
3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates] and, spontaneously, the formation of polymeric micelles in 
an aqueous environment to minimize the contact of the hydrophobic segment with the 
aqueous media, leading to the formation of a core–shell micellar structure. The average 
hydrodynamic sizes of dilute aqueous solution of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(tridecyl)ami￾nocrotonate] and poly[carboxyethyl 3-(octadecyl)aminocrotonate] in dependence on 
pH are varied in the range of 40–150 nm and 70–150 nm, respectively. The increase of 
the average diameter of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates] at high pH is due 
to the ionization of carboxylic groups, which leads to electrostatic repulsion between 
macroions and, consequently, to expanding of macromolecules. Carboxylic groups dis￾posed far from the main chain can be ionized more easily than the secondary amine 
groups that are near the main chain and in a hydrophobic environment. Therefore, the 
ionization of carboxylic groups more effectively unfolds the macromolecules than the 
ionization of nitrogen atoms located close to the main chain. In aqueous KOH solution, 
the carboxylic groups are in an ionized state and responsible for polyelectrolyte behav￾ior. According to commonly accepted approach, the hydrophobic groups in aqueous 
solution will tend to form intramacromolecular micelles or intermacromolecular vesic￾ular structures stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of long alkyl groups, as shown 
in Figure 1.9. The existence of such structures is good seen from cryo-TEM measure￾ments (Figure 1.9a, b). According to cryo-TEM results, the colloidal particles have uni￾formed (or regular) spherical or toroidal-shaped forms. The size of uniformed micelles 
is about 150 nm, while the outer diameter of toroidal-shaped micelle is 160 nm, with Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 31

its internal diameter 50 nm. The inner part of uniformed micelle structures seem fully 
represented by long alkyl chains, while the hole part of toroid-shaped micelles proba￾bly contain the water-solvated hydrophilic groups. 
Optical micrographs of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(tridecyl)aminocrotonate] at different pH 
were obtained by casting of the 0.3 wt.% aqueous solution of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(tri￾decyl)aminocrotonate] onto the glass substrate [226]. At pH 3, near the IEP, the dendritic 
with wide trunks and few side branched structures are formed. The “Maltese cross￾like” aggregates are observed at pH 6.5. At higher pH of 12, tree-like fractal patterns 
are formed. The enamine tautomeric form of 3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates was separated 
from the imine tautomeric form chromatographically and further used as a monomer for 
the RAFT polymerization to obtain amphiphilic poly[carboxyethyl 3-(alkyl)aminocroto￾nates] with controllable molecular weights and narrow PDI [235] (Table 1.9). 
The synthesis of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates] via RAFT polym￾erization contributed to the low molecular weight and polydispersity compared to 
poly[carboxyethyl 3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates] prepared by conventional radical 
polymerization. Self-assembly behaviors of poly[carboxyethyl 3-(octyl)aminocro￾tonate], poly[carboxyethyl 3-(tetradecyl)aminocrotonates], and poly[carboxyethyl 
3-(hexadecyl)aminocrotonates] obtained by RAFT polymerization were studied via 
zeta potential measurements and TEM. Isoelectric points (IEP) for poly[carboxyethyl 
3-(alkyl)aminocrotonates synthesized by RAFT polymerization were found to be 
between pH 1 and 2. The self-assembled structures for poly[carboxyethyl 3-(octyl) 
aminocrotonate] and poly[carboxyethyl 3-(tetradecyl)aminocrotonates] were found 
to have from spherical, rod-like, to fractal shapes. The spherical micelles are formed 
in the range of 5–20 nm at pH 1, and in the range of 20–50 nm at pH 4. At pH 10,

rod-like micelle structures (~120 nm) were formed. A perfect tree-like fractal mor￾phology was observed at pH 12. The same shape and size ranges were also found 
for poly[carboxyethyl 3-(hexadecyl)aminocrotonates]. The increase in hydrocarbon 
chain length from tetradecyl to hexadecyl in the polycarboxybetaines does not show 
a dramatic change in their self-assembly. Due to high molecular weight and the exist￾ence of hydrophobic “tail” and hydrophilic “head” in macromolecules, hydrophobic 
polybetaines prepared by conventional radical polymerization are able to self-assem￾ble into tubular vesicles with the length of about 200–300 nm and average diameter 
around 40 nm [227] (Figures 1.10a, 1.10c). Such vesicles are probably the result 
of the association of several intermacromolecular chains stabilized by hydrophobic 
interactions. Also, the formation of rod-like micelles with large length-to-diameter 
aspect ratios was observed (Figures 1.10b, 1.10d). The length of the rod is about 7 
µm, and the thickness is about 400 nm [227]. 
Phosphatidylethanolamine-containing monomers and polymers were obtained 
by the condensation of acetoacetic ester in enol tautomeric form with phosphati￾dylethanolamine [236, 237]. The DSC curves of the monomeric carboxyethyl 
3-phosphatidylethanolaminocrotonate and polymeric poly[(carboxyethyl 3-(phos￾phatidylethanolamino)crotonate] show that the transition from the liquid crystalline 
mesophase to isotropic state takes place at 265 and 270°C, respectively [236, 237]. 
XRD spectra of carboxyethyl 3-phosphatidylethanolaminocrotonate and poly[(car￾boxyethyl 3-(phosphatidylethanolamino)crotonate] show the appearance of crys￾talline refections at 2θ = 21.48°. This is probably connected with highly ordered 
phosphatidyl “tails,” which are closely packed into a crystalline structure. 
Hydrophobically modifed polybetaines, namely, poly[(carboxyethyl 3-(phosphatidy￾lethanolamino)crotonate], due to the superposition of hydrophobic and ionic interactions, 
favor the formation of self-organized and (micro)phase-separated systems in solution, at Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 33

interfaces, as well as in the bulk phase. The potentiometric titration curve of poly(car￾boxyethyl 3-phosphatidylethanolaminocrotonate) shows three bends due to the presence 
of three ionizing groups, namely, OPOH, COOH, and NH+. The apparent ionization 
constants (pKa) of OPOH, COOH, and NH+ groups found from the Henderson–Hassel￾balch equation are equal to 2.57, 4.75, and 7.08, respectively, and these values coincide 
well with the acidic strength of phosphoric, carboxylic, and amine groups [236, 237]. 
The dependence of pKa on ionization degree (α) for poly[(carboxyethyl 3-(phosphatidy￾lethanolamino)crotonate] exhibits the nonmonotonic changing of pKa. The values of pKa
increase with α and show a maximum at α ≈ 0.4. This is attributed to the change of poly
[(carboxyethyl 3-(phosphatidylethanolamino)crotonate] from a compact polysoap-like 
conformation to an expanded polyelectrolyte-like state. The electrostatic Gibbs energy 
(Gel) that corresponds to the additional work required to remove the protons from the 
macromolecule was calculated according to the equation ΔGel = 2.303 RT·A (where R
is Boltzman’s constant, T is absolute temperature, A is area of conformational change) is 
equal to 45.72 kJ·mol-1. This value of ΔGel found for poly(carboxyethyl 3-phosphatidy￾lethanolaminocrotonate) is much higher than that of ΔGel for pol(methacrylic acid) [220] 
and hydrophobically modifed polyelectrolytes (8.68 kJ·mol-1) [238]. This is accounted for 
by the more stable, compact conformation of poly(carboxyethyl 3-phosphatidylethanola￾minocrotonate) due to stabilization of its globular structure by hydrophobic interactions of 34 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
phosphatidyl “tails” that need more electrostatic force to disrupt. The apparent ionization 
constants (pKa) of OPOH, COOH, and NH+ groups, found from the Henderson–Hassel￾balch equation, are equal to 2.57, 4.75, and 7.08, respectively, and these values coincide 
well with the acidic strength of phosphoric, carboxylic, and amine groups. 
Authors [239] designed a series of polyzwitterions with systematically increas￾ing hydrophobicity from methyl to octyl to evaluate the infuence of this molecular 
parameter on their physical properties and bioactivity. An increase of alkyl residues 
from methyl to octyl shifts the values of the IEP from pH 4.8 to 6.7 according to 
surface zeta potential measurements. It is suggested that the increase of the hydro￾phobicity infuences the protonation/deprotonation equilibrium of polyzwitterions, 
shifting the IEP and the pKa of carboxylic groups at the polymer–liquid interface dur￾ing titration. Analogous shifting of the IEP to the basic region was observed for com￾blike maleic acid–based polyampholytes with α-olefns (C6H12–C16H28) [54, 55] and 
polyampholytes containing methyl, propyl, and butyl radicals [57]. The protein adhe￾sion of the polyzwitterionic networks was investigated with SPR using fbrinogen as 
a model protein. It was shown that it is possible to modify the physical properties 
and bioactivity profle of polyzwitterionic surfaces by modifying their hydrophilic￾ity/hydrophobicity. Hydrophilic surfaces (polyzwitterions bearing short alkyl resi￾dues) behave like “classical” polyzwitterions: they repel proteins and human cells 
and are non-toxic to bacteria. The more hydrophobic polyzwitterionic surfaces are 
protein-adhesive, are cell-toxic, and can kill bacteria. 
End-capped by fuoroalkyl chains, amphiphilic polybetaines possess unique 
properties imparted by the fuorocarbon fragments [240–242]. The polymers of 
common structure [RF-(APDMAE)n-RF], [RF-(AMPS)n-RF], [RF-(APDAPS)n-RF], 
and [RF-(VPPS)n-RF] (where APDMAE is 2-(3-acrylamidopropyldimethylammo￾nio)-ethanoate, AMPS is 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, APDAPS 
is 3-[N-(3-acrylamido)propyl-N,N-dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate, VPPS is 
2-vinylpyridiniopropane sulfonate, RF is fuorinated hydrocarbons) were shown to 
exhibit a wide variety of dispersing, aggregate, gel, and emulsion properties. The 
[RF-(AMPS)n-RF] polymers can form gels in both water and organic media due to the 
synergistic interaction between the aggregations of fuoroalkyl units and the ionic 
interactions of the quaternary ammonium cations and the sulfonate anions. The con￾centration dependences of the viscosities for [RF-(APDMAE)n-RF], [RF-(AMPS)n￾RF], and [RF-(APDAPS)n-RF] reveal that the viscosity of [RF-(APDAPS)n-RF] 
polymer increased only slightly with increasing concentrations, and the gel did not 
form. On the other hand, the viscosity of [RF-(AMPS)n-RF] increased signifcantly 
with increasing concentration, and the gelation occurred at concentrations >1 g·L-1. 
The [RF-(APDMAE)n-RF] polymers, especially the longer perfuorooxaalkyl end￾capped APDMAE polymer, can cause gelation in water derived from the synergistic 
interaction of the aggregations of the longer fuoroalkyl segments and the ionic inter￾actions of the betaine segments. The viscosity of [RF-(APDMAE)n-RF] increased with 
increasing concentration, and gelation was observed above 10 g·L-1. These fndings 
suggest that [RF-(AMPS)n-RF] and [RF-(APDMAE)n-RF] polymers could interact 
strongly with each other with the aggregations of the end-capped fuoroalkyl seg￾ments in polymers and the ionic interactions between the betaine segments to induce 
gel formation. On the other hand, in [RF-(APDAPS)n-RF] polymers, the aggregation  
Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 35 
of the end-capped fuoroalkyl segments would predominantly operate because of the 
electrostatic repulsion between the sulfonate units in betaine segments, and these 
polymers could not form gels. The fuoroalkylated end-capped betaine polymers [RF-
(APDMAE)n-RF] are able to reduce the surface tension of water effectively with a 
clear break point resembling a critical micelle concentration (CMC) at ca. 0.2 g·L-1. 
The degree of reduction in the surface tension of water depends on the length of fuo￾roalkyl segments in polymers, and longer perfuoro-oxyalkylated polymers are more 
effective in reducing the surface tension of water around 15 mN·m-1 levels than the 
corresponding shorter fuoroalkylated polymers or non-fuorinated APDMAE poly￾mer. A series of novel amphiphilic polybetaine copolymers composed of zwitterionic 
functionalities coupled with oligoethyleneglycol, octyl, and perfuorooctyl groups 
possess nonfouling properties, showing the best resistance against most of the pro￾teins tested [243]. 
The surface activity of the cyclocopolymers containing the pH-responsive hydro￾phobic monomer N,N-diallyl-N-methylamine and the salt-sensitive sulfobetaine 
monomer 3-(N,N-diallyl-N-methylammonio)-propanesulfonate was utilized to sol￾ubilize p-cresol within microdomains [243]. 
1.5 LOW AND UPPER CRITICAL SOLUTION TEMPERATURES 
(LCST AND UCST) OF POLYAMPHOLYTES 
Specifcally, the water-soluble and water-swelling polyampholytes that adequately 
respond to changes in external temperature are categorized into two main types: pol￾ymers with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and those with upper critical 
solution temperature (UCST) [150]. The four categories of temperature-driven tran￾sition behaviors of water-soluble polymers are demonstrated in Figure 1.11 [244]. 
The relationships between conformational change of single chain and phase behavior 
for polymer systems are shown for (a) UCST behavior, (b) LCST behavior, or (c and d) 
both UCST and LCST behaviors. For the UCST systems above the theta point or theta 
temperature (Tθ), the polymer in dilute solutions is soluble and adopts expanded confor￾mation; below Tθ, the chain collapses to form dense globules, leading to a decrease in 
radius of gyration (Rg) and phase separation as a function of fe that denotes the volume 
fraction of the polymer (Figure 1.11a). The opposite scenario takes place for systems that 
show LCST behavior, whereby collapse occurs at temperatures above Tθ (Figure 1.11b). 
Systems with both UCST and LCST behavior will show different types of collapse tran￾sitions. There will be a re-entrant collapse transition with a single Tθ for chains with hour￾glass-shaped coexistence curves. The upper and lower critical solution temperatures Tuc 
and Tlc will lie below and above Tθ, respectively (Figure 1.11c). For systems character￾ized by closed-loop phase diagrams, there will be two theta temperatures that respectively 
lie below Tlc and above Tuc for fnite-sized polymers (Figure 1.11d). 
The LCST in thermoresponsive polymers occur due to an entropic-driven effect, 
while the UCST is driven by an enthalpy effect. The most commonly studied and 
frst reported thermoresponsive polymer is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) 
[245], with an LCST of ca. 32–33°C, which is close to human body temperature. In 
this subchapter, the LCST and UCST behaviors of nonionic, anionic, and cationic 
polymers will not be considered because of the specifc character of the book. 36 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

one-phase regimes. TUCST and TLCST denote the upper critical and lower critical solution 
temperatures, respectively, where a system separates into two phases below TUCST and above TLCST.

The appearance of the LCST and UCST of polyampholytes can be invoked by 
changing temperature, pH, salt addition, and in water organic solvents. New linear 
polyampholyte based on N-acryloyl-N-ethyl piperazine (ANEP) and maleic acid (MA) 
exhibited LCST behavior at 80.5 and 85°C in water [246]. LCST was dependent on 
monomer composition, pH of external solution, type and concentration of simple salts. 
The isoelectric points (IEP) of polyampholytes in dependence of copolymer compo￾sition varied in the range of 3.4–7.1. The effect of two different simple salts, such as 
NaCl and Na2SO4, on the LCST of the copolymer solution was studied. For both salts, 
the LCST of the copolymer solution decreases almost linearly with increase in salt 
concentration due to the salting-out effect. It is further observed that the divalent anion 
SO4
2- is more effective in lowering the LCST than the monovalent anion Cl-
. 
Polyampholytes with controlled equimolar ratio of comonomers, namely, MAA￾DMAEMA, exhibited thermoresponsive UCST behavior in methanol–water and 
ethanol–water solvent mixtures [114], while uniform water-soluble oligoampholy￾tes with precisely positioned negatively charged carboxylate and positively charged 
ammonium side chains showed UCST behavior in 85 vol.% isopropanol–water mix￾ture [247]. The cloud point temperatures (TCP) for polyampholytes in alcohol–water 
solvent mixtures as a function of alcohol content were evaluated [114]. Ampholytic 
copolymers show thermoresponsive UCST behavior in a wide range of ethanol con￾tent in the ethanol–water solvent mixtures. Increasing of ethanol content increases the 
TCP due to the decrease in the dielectric permittivity and solvent polarity, resulting in

stronger electrostatic attraction between opposite charges. Precisely alternating pol￾yampholytes prepared from sustainable thiolactone building blocks exhibited UCST 
in water/ethanol (30/70 vol.%) solutions that can be tuned as a function of the content 
of ionic and hydroxyl groups [248]. 
Hoogenboom et al. [249] also reported the synthesis of a new type of polyam￾pholytes with alternating cationic N,N-dimethylaminomethylstyrene (DMAMSt) 
and anionic N-carboxyethylmaleimide 3-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yl) 
propanoic acid (CEMI) monomers in the (co)polymer and demonstrated the ther￾moresponsive behavior of two polyampholytes P(DMAMSt-alt-CEMI) and PNI￾PAM-b-P(DMAMSt-alt-CEMI) in water and alcohol/water solvent mixtures. The 
PNIPAM-based diblock copolymer was synthesized to enhance an LCST thermo￾responsive block into the copolymer. The turbidity of P(DMAMSt-alt-CEMI) was 
investigated in methanol–water, ethanol–water, and isopropanol–water mixtures. The 
UCST of the polyampholyte in solvent mixtures with an alcohol content of 30 vol.% 
to 70 vol.% varies from 13.4 to 30.7°C with methanol, from 13.7 to 26.6°C with eth￾anol content of 30 vol.% to 60 vol.%, and 12.5 to 37.3°C with isopropanol content 
of 30 vol.% to 50 vol.%, indicating that the addition of the less-polar isopropanol 
strengthens the interpolymer interactions more, leading to a higher UCST phase 
transition temperature. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of P(DMAMSt￾alt-CEMI) from 1 mg·mL-1 to 5 mg·mL-1 in the ethanol–water solvent mixtures also 
favors the interpolymer interaction and increases the Tcp. The UCST behavior of the 
P(DMAMSt-alt-CEMI) polyampholyte in an aqueous medium was investigated by 
turbidimetry at the IEP, for which the polymer solution (1 or 5 mg·mL-1) was heated 
and cooled between 3 and 65°C at a heating–cooling rate of 1°C·min-1 while stirring. 
Interestingly, no phase transition was observed for this polymer at 1 mg·mL-1, but 
a clear phase transition was observed with a Tcp of 9.5± 1°C at 5 mg·mL-1, indicat￾ing enhanced polymer–polymer interactions at higher polymer concentration. The 
behavior of diblock QPA composed of anionic block PAMPS82 (where the subscript 
82 indicates the degree of polymerization) and cationic blocks PAPTACn (where 
n = 37, 83, and 181) (abbreviated as PAMPS82-PAPTACn) was studied in aqueous and 
aqueous salt solutions [112]. It was shown that the equimolar PAMPS82-PAPTAC83 
precipitates in pure water due to the formation of intra-polyelectrolyte complexes 
(intra-PEC) between anionic and cationic blocks, while PAMPS82-PAPTAC37 and 
PAMPS82-PAPTAC181 containing the excess of anionic and cationic blocks are fully 
water-soluble. It is supposed that in case of PAMPS82-PAPTAC37 and PAMPS82-PAP￾TAC181, the equal numbers of oppositely charged PAMPS and PAPTAC blocks 
are involved into the formation of a “core,” while the excess of PAMPS and 
PAPTAC blocks is replaced in a “shell.” All three QPA PAMPS82-PAPTAC37, 
PAMPS82-PAPTAC181, PAMPS82-PAPTAC83 exhibit a thermoresponsive character 
and show the LCST at defnite polymer concentration (Cp) and NaCl concentration. 
A series of charge-balanced QPAs prepared from cationic vinylbenzyltrimethyl￾ammonium chloride (VBTAC) and anionic sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) mono￾mers P(VBTAC-NaSS)n via RAFT (with different degrees of polymerization n = 20 or 
97) exhibits UCST behavior in aqueous solution as a function of NaCl concentration, 
polymer concentration, and molecular mass of polymers [113]. It was established 
by measurement of the turbidity (%T), hydrodynamic radius (Rh), light-scattering 38 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
intensity (LSI), optical microscopy (OM), and fuorescence probe (FP) technique that 
the UCST of P(VBTAC-NaSS)n is shifted to higher temperature with decreasing NaCl 
and increasing polymer concentration (Cp) and degree of polymerization (DP). 
A new combination of double hydrophilic betaine diblock copolymers is com￾posed of a carboxy- and a sulfobetaine methacrylate (PGLBT-b-PSPE), which is a 
stimuli-responsive double hydrophilic block copolymer (DHBC) [250]. Having tem￾perature-responsive PSPE on the one hand and pH-responsive PGLBT on the other 
hand, the diblock copolymer could reversibly change their state in water from free 
chains to PSPE-centered micelles 
Amphoteric statistical equimolar copolymers composed of 2-vinylpyridine and 
sodium p-styrenesulfonate P(2VP-co-NaSS)n (the degrees of polymerization n are 
equal to 19 and 95) exhibited the UCST in acidic aqueous solutions [251]. The phase 
transition temperatures (TP) of polyampholytes were estimated as a function of tem￾perature at different pH values and salt concentrations during the heating and cooling 
processes (Figure 1.12). 
The obtained results are interpreted in light of strong intra- and interpolymer elec￾trostatic attractive interactions between the anionic sulfonate and cationic protonated 
pyridine groups that are responsible for the aggregation of unimers and their dis￾aggregation in dependence of pH, temperature, and salt addition. The TPTT values 
for the aqueous P(2VP/NaSS)n solutions increased with an increase in pH, Cp, and 
molecular weight and with a reduction in NaCl. Therefore, the TPTT value can be 
modulated via the appropriate adjustment of these factors. For a series of N-[3-(di￾methylamino)propyl]methacrylamide (DMAPMAm), methacrylic acid (MAA), and 
N-(tert-butyl)methacrylamide (tBMAm) amphoteric terpolymers at all polymer con￾centrations ranging between 1 and 10 mg·mL-1, the polymer cloud points were suc￾cessfully modulated by the inclusion of tBMAm; they become much sharper, and the 
reduction in transmittance is much greater when the tBMAm content was increased 
to 16% and above [252]. Thus, a very good correlation is observed between the 
cloud point temperatures and the hydrophobicity of the polymer chains. Changes in 
pH and addition of salt both led to an increase in the polymer cloud points and, in

many cases, rendered the polymers free of their thermoresponsive properties within 
the 15–100°C temperature ranges investigated. Laschewsky et al. reported the LCST 
and UCST behavior of thermoresponsive linear diblock copolymer composed of a 
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) block and a poly(3-[N-(3-methacrylami￾dopropyl)-N,N-dimethyl]-ammoniopropanesulfonate) (PSPP) block [253–257]. The 
diblock copolymer exhibits thermally induced “schizophrenic” aggregation behavior 
in aqueous solutions (Figure 1.13C). Three regimes were defned in dependence on 
temperature and electrolyte concentration (Figure 1.13A): (1) below the UCST-type 
transition of PSPP, micelles with a PSPP core and a PNIPAM shell; (2) between 
the UCST-type transition of PSPP and the LCST-type transition of PNIPAM, uni￾mers, namely, molecularly dissolved polymers; and (3) above the LCST transition of 
PNIPAM, inverted micelles with a PNIPAM core and a PSPP shell. Also, three 
regimes are distinguished in the transmission curve (Figure 1.13B): in regimes 1 and 
3, the solution is turbid. In regime 2, both blocks are expected to be in a molecularly 
dissolved state. The UCST of the diblock copolymer is 21.2 ± 0.5°C, while the LCST 
value of the diblock copolymer is 32.3± 0.5°C, that is, close to the LCST of the 
PNIPAM homopolymer. 
The sensitivity of the PSPP-b-PNIPAM block copolymer to temperature, ionic 
strength, and the nature of the salt offers the possibility to create switchable stimu￾li-responsive systems which are promising candidates for a variety of applications, 
for example, in the biomedical feld, development of switchable surfaces and ther￾mo-optical devices, etc. 
H. Tenhu et al. [258] developed the tunable self-assembly behavior of graft copol￾ymers, poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)-graft-poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl 
ether methacrylate)-co-di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PSBM-g￾P(OEGMA-co-DEGMA)). The graft copolymers were found to undergo both UCST￾and LCST-type phase transitions and are capable to form various self-assembled

structures, depending on temperature and the ionic strength. At low temperatures in 
water, aggregates with PSBM cores form due to the PSBM UCST-type phase transi￾tion. Upon heating the aqueous solutions, the graft copolymers undergo a transition 
from micelles with PSBM cores to unimers (i.e., individual macromolecules), and 
then to reversed micelles with P(OEGMA-co-DEGMA) cores, thus demonstrating 
the tunability of the self-assembly through temperature change. 
Dual thermo- and pH-responsive star polymers based on poly (3-((2-(methacry￾loyloxy) ethyl) dimethylammonio)propane-1-sulfonate) (PDMAPS) with tunable 
UCST were synthesized by an “arm-frst” RAFT polymerization approach [259]. 
Typically, linearly shaped PDMAPS exhibits sharp and continuous phase change 
in aqueous solutions upon heating or cooling to a UCST. Phase-transition behavior 
and UCST of the purifed polyzwitterionic star-(PDMAPSn)x polymers with differ￾ent number of arms, where n represents the degree of polymerization (DP) and x is 
the rounded number of arms (Narm), showed an abrupt change in turbidity near 6°C. 
After crosslinking, the UCSTs of the six-arm and eight-arm star-PDMAPS were sig￾nifcantly increased over the arm polymer PDMAPS80 from 6°C to 16°C and 23°C, 
respectively. These star polymers are expected to be used in surface modifcation, 
drug delivery, and nanoreactor applications, thanks to the dual-responsiveness and 
good rheological properties. Novel linear amphoteric terpolymers based on neutral 
monomer (NIPAM), anionic monomer (AMPS), and cationic monomer (APTAC) 
were synthesized by free radical polymerization in aqueous solution and charac￾terized by methods of 1H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, TGA, GPC, dynamic light 
scattering (DLS), and zeta potential [260]. The thermal and salt sensitivity of ampho￾teric ternary polymers of various compositions, particularly, NIPAM90-AMPS2.5-AP￾TAC7.5, NIPAM90-AMPS5-APTAC5, NIPAM90-AMPS7.5-APTAC2.5, were studied in 
aqueous and aqueous salt solutions in the temperature range from 25 to 60°C and at 
the NaCl ionic strength μ interval from 10–3 to 1 M. It was found that due to hydro￾phobic/hydrophilic balance, the temperature-dependent conformational and phase 
change of macromolecular chains becomes sensitive to salt addition and allows the 
fne-tuning of the phase transition. The TPTT (or LCST behavior) of amphoteric ter￾polymers NIPAM-AMPS-APTAC is summarized in Table 1.10.

In case of charge-balanced amphoteric terpolymer NIPAM90-AMPS5-APTAC5, the 
TPPT increases and passes through the maximum at μ = 0.1 M NaCl. The maximal TPPT 
for the charge-imbalanced terpolymer NIPAM90-AMPS2.5-APTAC7.5 with the excess 
of cationic monomer (APTAC) was equal to μ = 0.05 M NaCl. The temperature￾dependent phase transition of charge-imbalanced terpolymer NIPAM90-AMPS7.5-
APTAC2.5 with the excess of anionic monomer (AMPS) exhibits complicated behav￾ior at high ionic strength at μ = 1 M NaCl up to precipitation. The TPPT of amphoteric 
terpolymers can be fnely tuned to the desired one by adding the salt. The combina￾tion of different stimuli within one macromolecular chain can open up a wide space 
of sensing applications, in particular as a drug delivery system. 
1.6 POLYAMPHOLYTIC IONIC LIQUIDS 
Polyelectrolytes are being named polymeric ionic liquids (PILs), also called in the scien￾tifc literature as poly(ionic liquid)s in analogy to their monomeric ionic liquids (MILs), 
and represent a new family of functional polymers with particular properties and new 
applications [261]. Contrary to classic polyelectrolytes, which are water-soluble and dis￾sociate in aqueous solutions, making the polymers charged, most PILs are water-insoluble 
but soluble in polar organic solvents. This is mainly due to the hydrophobic character 
of the counterions and the reduced columbic interactions. In the case of classic cationic 
polyelectrolytes, the common counteranions are halide anions, such as Cl−, Br−, or I−. 
However, typical counteranions of PILs are hydrophobic anions such as tetrafuorob￾orate (BF4−), hexafuorophosphate (PF6−), or fuorinated amides ((CF3CF2SO2)2N− and 
(CF3SO2)2N−). In the case of conventional anionic polyelectrolytes, the common coun￾tercations are cations such as Li+, Na+, or K+. However, typical counteranions of PILs 
are organic cations, such as dialkyl imidazolium, alkylpyridinium, tetraalkylammonium, 
and alkylpyrrolidonium. In case of polyampholytic ionic liquids (or polyzwitterionic liq￾uids), polymerization of monomeric ion pairs without inorganic counterions produces 
equimolar polyampholytes. For instance, the stoichiometric mixture of 2-methacryloy 
loxyethyltrimethylammonium iodide (METMAI) and silver salt of 2-methcaryloyloxye 
thanesulfonate (AgMES) gives AgI as precipitate and METMA-MES as ion-pair mon￾omers in solution [262]. Another example of polyampholytic ionic liquids are inner salt 
polymers prepared from vinylimidazolium sulfobetaines [263]. Polyzwitterionic liquids 
are a less-considered subject in literature. Commercially available Brønsted acids (acrylic 
acid, vinylphosphonic acid, vinylbenzoic acid, and bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phos￾phate) and Brønsted bases (vinyl-1,2,4-triazole), which contain a polymerizable vinyl 
group, are suitable for free radical polymerization and obtaining of polyampholytic 
ionic liquids. RAFT polymerization of monomeric ionic liquids (MILs) composed of 
anionic and cationic species, namely, acrylic acid (AA) and vinyl-1,2,4-triazole (VTZ), 
vinylphosphonic acid (VPA), and VTZ (PIL-1), vinylbenzoic acid (VBA) and VTZ (PIL￾2), bis-vinylphosphonic acid (Bis-VPA), and VTZ (PIL-3), leads to solid amorphous ran￾dom or alternating copolymers, denoted as POL-1, POL-2, and POL-3 [264]. Physical 
properties of conversion, polydispersity, weight-average molecular weight (Mw), num￾ber-average molecular weight (Mn), and glass transition temperature for corresponding to 
polymers POL-1, POL-2, and POL-3 are provided in Table 1.11 [264]. TABLE 1.11

Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 44 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
Polyampholytic ionic liquids that have been synthesized via reversible addition– 
fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of protic ionic liquid monomers 
[264]. Since ILs are liquids composed of only ions, they are expected to be highly 
ion-conductive liquid [265]. A series of zwitterionic-type molten salts consisting of 
imidazolium cations containing covalently bound counteranionic sites (such as sul￾fonate or sulfonamide groups) showed ionic conductivity less than 10–9 S·cm-1 [266]. 
However, polyzwitterionic imidazolium molten salts mixed with 100 mol.% lithium 
bis(trifuoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) displayed a high ionic conductivity of 
about 10–5 S·cm-1 at 50°C in spite of their rubber-like properties. Thus, polyzwit￾terionic-type molten salts act as an excellent ion-conductive matrix, in which only 
added LiTFSI can migrate. A beneft of polymerizing MILs to form polyampholytes 
is that the ion conducting properties may be retained, without leaching of either ion 
and without requiring a separate polymer matrix. PILs representing tight, elastic, and 
freestanding flms with good mechanical properties were prepared by crosslinking 
of MILs with poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate [267]. The formation of mobile 
ionic liquid molecules that occurred inside the polyampholyte matrix was responsi￾ble for improved ion transport. Self-healing PILs based on acrylic acid, 2-diethyla 
minoethyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate were prepared in the presence of 
ionic liquids containing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumbis[(trifuoromethyl)sulfonyl] 
imide ([Emim]TFSI) and lithium bis(trifuoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) [268]. 
An ionic liquid-based ionically crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte not only has great 
potential in traditional electrochromic devices but also can be applied as a new elec￾tronic device, such as foldable smart windows and stretchable electronic skin. The appli￾cation area of PILs comprises solar cells, lithium batteries, actuators, light-emitting 
cells, electrochromic devices, etc. [269]. 
Authors [270] presented a novel high-strength polyzwitterionic liquid hydrogel 
P(PVIS–AA) based on zwitterionic liquids (1-propyl-3-vinyl imidazole sulfonate) 
(PVIS) and acrylic acid (AA) and applied them for immobilization of Pd nanoparti￾cles in catalysis. On the support of polyzwitterionic liquids hydrogel, Pd nanoparti￾cles were obtained by in situ reduction of [PdCl6]2− with NaBH4, then the mechanical 
strength of the hydrogel was enhanced through ionically crosslinking by Fe3+. The 
results demonstrated the formation of ultra-small, non-aggregated, and kinetically 
stable Pd nanoparticles; the small amount of Fe ions was reduced to Fe nanoparticles 
of 2–5 nm size inside the polyzwitterionic hydrogel, being bimetallic nanoparticle 
catalysts, which promote the catalytic reaction as well. The reduction of 4-nitrophe￾nol to 4-aminophenol fnished in 6 min at room temperature, in spite of the content 
of Pd inside of the hydrogel matrix as low as 1.6 wt.%. 
1.7 SEMI-NATURAL POLYAMPHOLYTES 
In the last years, the attention of researchers has been paid to semi-natural polyam￾pholytes that can be prepared by modifcation of such natural polysaccharides as 
chitosan, cellulose, starch, gellan, alginic acid, etc. by introducing either carbox￾ylic (sulfo) or amine (ammonium) groups or both into the macromolecular chains 
[271–281]. Such biocompatible and biodegradable semi-natural polyampholytes can 
be used in the production of drug delivery systems as excellent antibiofouling and Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 45 
self-healing materials, bio- and hemocompatible artifcial organs, in particular, for in 
vitro intrafbrillar mineralization and the development of materials from mineralized 
collagen scaffolds for tissue engineering. 
Sulfobetainic groups were introduced into amino cellulose by polymer analogous 
reaction [282]. In its turn, the cellulose tosylate was easily produced by the reaction 
of cellulose with tosyl chloride homogeneously in N,N-dimethyl acetamide/LiCl 
as solvent. Further, a subsequent conversion of the amino cellulose obtained with 
1,3-propane sultone leads to the design of novel cellulose-based polyampholytes 
(Structure 1.4). 
Conjugation of strong anionic sulfonate groups to chitosan (CS) is typically used 
for converting the weak cationic CS to its polyampholyte derivatives, which are of 
interest to different areas, benefting from both cationic and anionic groups. The 
content of anionic charges can be tuned by varying the level of sulfonation, which 
is a fundamental characteristic expressed as the degree of substitution (DS). The 
subject of this work is the synthesis of the representative polyampholyte of this 
class, N-(3-sulfopropyl)chitosan salt (SPCS), by the reaction of CS with 1,3-propane 
sultone (PrS) in water [283]. According to literature, this reaction is mostly per￾formed under acidic conditions and should lead to SPCS with high DS values. It 
was found that such DS values are likely overestimated due to the presence of a 
non-covalently bonded sulfopropyl group, originating from extensive PrS hydroly￾sis, in the SPCS structure. In this work, the combination of experimental and theo￾retical approaches resulted in selecting a neutral pH for the SPCS synthesis, which 
increased the effciency of the N-sulfopropylation reaction. Quantum chemistry cal￾culations suggest that this fnding primarily corresponds with the higher reactivity 
of PrS to a non-protonated glucosamine unit compared to a protonated one, where 
the molar fraction of the non-protonated unit at neutral pH is remarkably higher than 
that at acidic pH. The developed purifcation conditions make the SPCS free from 
the non-covalently bonded sulfopropyl groups. It was shown that true DS values can 
be obtained by NMR regardless of the level of SPCS purity, and also by elemental 
analysis for completely pure SPCS. It is noticeable that while the true DS values for 
SPCS synthesized under acidic conditions are limited to only around 5%, these val￾ues range between 25 and 95% for SPCS synthesized under neutral conditions and 
STRUCTURE 1.4 Modifcation of amino cellulose with 1,3-propane sultone  
46 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
can be readily controlled by the weight ratio between CS and PrS. Hence, this work 
provides guidelines for a simple yet feasible and highly effective sulfopropylation 
reaction with PrS under aqueous conditions. 
1.8 STRUCTURAL AND BEHAVIORAL SIMILARITY OF 
SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL POLYAMPHOLYTES AND 
INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED PROTEINS (IDPS) 
The ability of synthetic polyampholytes to adopt globular, coil, helix, and stretched 
conformations and to demonstrate coil–globule, helix–coil, liquid–liquid, sol-gel 
phase transitions with respect to internal (structure, composition, charge distribution, 
hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, etc.) and external factors (pH, temperature, ionic 
strength, thermodynamic quality of solvents, etc.) is very important for mimicking 
the hierarchy and structural organization of proteins. In this subchapter, the struc￾tural and behavioral similarity between synthetic and natural polymers is analyzed, 
concentrating the main attention to synthetic polyampholytes, amphoteric polypep￾tides, and so-called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in order to show a closer 
relationship between two fascinating worlds. Responsive synthetic polyampholytes 
can serve as model systems for natural analogues, including IDPs that can reversibly 
phase-separate within mammalian cells [284]. 
It is symbolic that the pioneering works on synthetic polyampholytes [1–7] and 
IDPs [285–287] have been started at the beginning of the 1950s. Since then, publi￾cations on IDPs have increased exponentially compared to the steady increase in the 
number of reports on synthetic polyampholytes, while researches on polyampholytic 
polypeptides became the subject of intensive development starting from late 1990 
[288–290]. 
Previously, the theory and basic structures [291], functions, and applications [292] 
of natural and synthetic polyampholytes were reviewed. Their behavior, based on 
coulombic interactions between complementary charges, was critically analyzed. 
The properties of polyampholytes in solution and gel state, together with application 
aspects, were also discussed. The main aim of this chapter is systematization and 
analysis of literature in the context of merging the “structure–function paradigm” of 
natural and synthetic polyampholytes, focusing on the “polyampholytic behavior” of 
“biological objects.” 
Authors [293] comprehensively reviewed the applicability of theories of polymer 
physics developed for the description of large macromolecules for understanding and 
prediction of important properties of intrinsically unstructured proteins. At frst, the 
sequence of amino acids in protein molecule is represented as virtual chain that can 
be considered as freely joined chain and the wormlike chain. These basic models fur￾ther serve as the basis for higher-order models and methods for treating the statistical 
properties of polymers. 
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), also known as intrinsically unstructured 
proteins, are characterized by their biased amino acid composition and low sequence 
complexity, as well as by their low proportions of bulky hydrophobic amino acids and 
high proportions of charged and hydrophilic amino acids. Literature survey shows 
that there are approximately 1,150 validated IDPs [294]. The terms “intrinsically Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 47 
disordered proteins” (IDPs) and “intrinsically disordered regions” (IDR) refer to the 
lack of a well-defned secondary and/or tertiary structure under physiological condi￾tions. The protein quartet model proposes four types of conformations: random coil, 
pre-molten globule, molten globule, and folded states that can transit each other [295]. 
In fact, 75% of IDPs belong to polyampholytes [296, 297] and their stimuli-responsive 
phase transition functions are governed by relationships between information encoded 
in their amino acid sequences and ensembles of conformations [298]. Nature uses 
polyampholytic IDPs as scaffolds for extracellular matrices, plant cell walls, and other 
fbrous composites [299, 300]. Charge distribution in IDPs is described by the fraction 
of charged residues (FCR) and net charge per residue (NCPR), which are defned 
as FCR = (f+ + f−) and NCPR = f+ − f−, where f+ and f− are the fractions of positive 
(Lys/Arg) and negative (Asp/Glu) charges, respectively [301]. IDPs can have positive, 
negative charges or be quasi-electroneutral, exhibit stimuli-responsive conformational 
and phase behavior, and exist as fully expanded, molten globular, pre-molten glob￾ular, and random coil states [302, 303]. Five regions of IDPs exist as a function of 
FCR: R1 represents low-FCR sequences, where IDPs adopt globular conformation; 
R2 represents globule–coil transformation; R3 belongs to high-FCR sequences and 
swollen coil or hairpin-like conformations; and R4 and R5 represent expanded com￾pletely negatively and positively charged IDPs. It should be noted that the parameter 
κ refects the microstructural organization of amino acid sequences; low values of κ 
correspond to alternating structure, while large values to blocklike structure. 
A diagram of states of a polyampholyte chain as a function of the charge asym￾metry δf = f+ − f−and fraction of charged monomers f = f+ + f− was constructed [88, 
153, 304, 305]. According to [304, 305], the overall size and shape of polyampholy￾tes are determined by the balance of several factors: (1) chain entropy, which tends 
to keep the polymer confguration in Gaussian statistics; (2) fuctuation-induced 
attractions between charged monomers, which tend to collapse the chain into a 
globule; (3) short-range three-body monomer–monomer interactions, which stabi￾lize the size of globule; and (4) coulomb repulsion between excess charges, which 
tend to stretch the polymer chain. The relative importance of these factors depends 
on the fraction of positive f_ and negative f_ charges on the chain, on the charge 
sequence, on the degree of polymerization N, and on the ratio of the Bjerrum length 
lB to the monomer size b, defning the relative strength of the electrostatic interac￾tions (u = lB/b). 
Analogous conformational state is also specifc for charge-balanced quenched pol￾yampholytes and block polyampholytes [305, 306]. For instance, a balanced poly￾ampholyte with zero charge ΔN = 0 forms dense globule (where ΔN is the difference 
between the amount of positive f·N+ and negative f·N− charges). At defnite charge 
asymmetry (f·N+ > f·N− or f·N+ < f·N−), a globule is transformed into two halves, “pearl” 
or bead strings connected with a “spring” up to double-stranded helical conformation. 
The pH-induced collapse and phase diagrams for the IDPs show that collapse taking 
place at the isoelectric point (IEP) is caused by intra-polyelectrolyte complexation 
between the oppositely charged sequences within the single macromolecules, as in the 
case of synthetic-based random and block polyampholytes [307]. 
The polypeptide-based amphoteric copolymers can mimic the biological activ￾ity of natural proteins [41, 44, 308–311]. Authors [311] designed and synthesized a 48 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
series of new alternating polypeptoids via the Ugi reaction of readily available nat￾ural amino acids, then cleavages the protecting groups to obtain strictly alternating 
polyampholytes without any compositional drift. The combination of biodegrada￾bility, cytocompatibility, and antifouling ability suggests that alternating polypep￾toids-based polyampholytes can be utilized as an ideal alternative protein-resistant 
material in biomedical science. 
The pH-dependent solution and aggregation behavior of an ABC-type PEO42− 
PLLys61−PLGlu62 triblock copolymer comprising cationic and anionic polypeptide 
segments was studied in pure water and saline solution [44] (Figures 1.14 and 1.15). 
Stable solutions were prepared at low and high pH, while precipitation occurred at 
intermediate pH of 4.5–10.5. PLGlu adopts a non-charged α-helical conformation at 
low pH and a charged random coil conformation at high pH. Contrary to this, PLLys 
forms a random coil at low pH and turns into an α-helix at high pH. Thus, at either 
low or high pH, there should be half proportion of polypeptide segment adopting 
random coil conformation and half adopting α-helical structure. At intermediate pH 
range of ~4.5–10.5, there is evidence for the existence of β-sheet, as indicated by 
the negative CD peak absorption with single minimum at ~218 nm. The aggregation 
behavior is controlled by the block sequence and position of the hydrophobic helix 
block; vesicles form when the helix block is located at the chain end, whereas sin￾gle chains are stable when the helix middle block can be wrapped by the two outer 
hydrophilic blocks and shielded from the water phase (resembling tertiary structure 
formation in proteins). Polyampholytic polypeptide sequences that form helices in 
isolation have been identifed and extensively studied by authors [312]. The main

conclusion is that the specifc patterns of oppositely charged amino acids impart a 
strong helical propensity to polyampholyte peptide sequences. 
Thus, the structural similarity between IDPs, polypeptide-based, and synthetic 
polyampholytes can be summarized as follows: 
1. Both IDPs and synthetic polyampholytes adopt globular, coil, and stretched 
conformation and show similar diagram of states as a function of the charge 
asymmetry expressed, in the former case, as the fraction of charged resi￾dues FCR = (f+ + f−), and net charge per residue NCPR = |f+ − f−|, in latter 
case, as δf = | f+ − f−|, and fraction of charged monomers f = f+ + f− (where 
f+ and f− are the fractions of positive and negative charges, respectively). 
2. pH- or charge-dependent conformation of block polyampholyte and syn￾thetic polypeptide can comprise of double-stranded helical conformation 
and β-sheet that are specifc for proteins. 
3. A number of theoretical works [313–316] that are devoted to charge fuctua￾tion effects on the shape, phase separation, aggregation, swelling–deswelling 
of fexible linear, and crosslinked polyampholytes highlight the role of 
electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged monomers in IDPs. 
“Complex coacervation,” or liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), is a common 
phenomenon in globular proteins, IDPs, amphoteric polypeptides, synthetic polyam￾pholytes, as well as interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPCs). The simplifed molecular 50 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
design principles developed for synthetic polyampholytes can give some insights 
into the more complicated sequences of IDPs and understanding how charge-driven 
LLPS can be designed by tuning the patterning of charged monomers. Among the 
synthetic amphoteric copolymers, block polyampholytes are an attractive system to 
study the conformational regimes and phase separation as a function of polymer 
concentration, charge balance, pH, ionic strength, etc. to give insight into the more 
complicated system of IDPs [317]. Further, we will show that a series of model poly￾ampholytic polypeptides of increasing blockiness undergo “self-coacervation” due 
to electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged anionic and cationic blocks 
along the same polymer chain that represent classical model system for certain types 
of IDPs. Analogy between phase separation in polyampholytic polypeptides [317] 
and IPCs derived from anionic and cationic polyelectrolyte pairs will expand our 
representation on amphoteric behavior of IPCs [318]. 
Authors [319] have studied two types of charge-patterned sequences composed 
entirely of ionizable amino acids (charge fraction, f = 1), an equal number of positive 
and negative charges (f + = f − = 0.5), and with distinct charge patterns consisting of 
Lys and Glu (Figure 1.16). 
Main focus was paid to investigating the pH-dependent secondary structures, as 
well as the effects of varying ionic strength and solvent dielectric constant. It was 
revealed that polyampholytes with distinct charge patterns exhibit different structural 
responses in dependence of pH, salt, and solvent polarity. Specifcally, (EKEK)25 
showed a strong pH dependence of the adopted secondary structures in salt-free solu￾tions, whereas the secondary structures of (EKKE)25 remained nearly pH-independent. 
At pH 3.5, the helical content of (EKEK)25 increases, while the (EKKE)25 sequence 
remains free of helices. However, at pH 11.5, without and in the presence of salt, 
FIGURE 1.16 Polyampholyte sequences consist of the repeating units of EKEK and EKKE, 
where E represents glutamic acid and K represents lysine. The corresponding chemical 
structures and pKa values of amino acids are also included.

both (EKEK)25 and (EKKE)25 exhibited nearly no change in the secondary structure, 
failing to form α-helical structures. However, decreasing the dielectric constant of 
the solvent by introducing alcohol to the aqueous environment induced structural 
changes of (EKEK)25. In contrast, the altered solvent environment did not gener￾ate changes in the secondary structure of (EKKE)25 for the alcohol concentrations 
tested. The results demonstrate that, in addition to electrostatic interactions between 
charged monomers, other interactions contribute to the formation of the secondary 
structures, such as those infuenced by side chain hydrophobicity. Moreover, the 
most stable compact states are formed by copolymers in which units of two A mon￾omers are alternated by units of two B monomers [320]. Altogether, the study shows 
how different factors such as alteration of monomers sequence and pH medium, salt 
concentration, and solvent composition infuence the secondary structure formation 
of the two polypeptide-based polyampholytes. 
Phase behavior of a series of lysine-glutamate polyampholytes and IPCs of 
homopolypeptides was compared [321]. The sequences of block polyampholytes are 
characterized by the “blockiness” τ. The chain blockiness τ increases from alter￾nating positive-negative monomers (τ =  2) to blocks of 24 positive and negative 
monomers (τ = 48). The sequence of charges along these polyampholytic polypep￾tides plays a signifcant role in their coacervation ability: increase in the blockiness 
enhances the strength of coacervation. The reason is that the spatial proximity of 
two oppositely charged blocks leads to a strong coulomb attraction, small Rg, and 
higher tendency to phase separation. In contrast, for strictly alternating sequence, 
attractive coulomb interactions require more conformational restriction, resulting in 
more open, large-Rg single-chain conformation and less tendency to phase separation 
[314]. The differences between the phase diagrams of block polyampholytes and 
IPCs can be explained by the presence of “charge pattern interfaces,” where two 
segments of oppositely charged blocks merge in polyampholytes, while homopolye￾lectrolytes lack such connectivity, thus leading to different types of salt localization 
in comparison with block polyampholytes [322]. 
Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), coacervation, homogeneous solution, and 
coacervate droplets of poly-L-lysine-based betaine-type polyampholyte (PLL-SA50) 
as a function of temperature and salt addition was studied [323]. Phase diagram of 
aqueous PLL-SA50 solution exhibits LCST-type temperature-responsive LLPS and 
coacervate formation. Another example is dual stimuli-responsive polyampholyte 
poly(L-serinyl acrylate (PSA) exhibiting LLPS with respect to pH and temperature 
in aqueous solution [324]. At low and high pH, PSA behaves as cationic and anionic 
polyelectrolytes and is fully water-soluble. At the isoelectric pH, (pHIEP 2.85) exists 
in zwitterionic form and, in the range of pH 2.3–3.5, is insoluble (two-phase sys￾tem) due to the formation of intra- and intermacromolecular complexes. The PSA’s 
turbid solution becomes transparent upon heating, and the turbidity appears upon 
cooling, indicating the presence of UCST-type phase behavior. The functionalization 
of poly(acryloyl-L-serine) with L-cysteine leads to the formation of the zwitterionic 
polypeptide, which has an isoelectric point at pH 2.7 [325]. Near the pHIEP (pH ranges 
of 2.2–4.1), the aqueous solution of poly[(acryloyl-L-serine)-g-L-cysteine] exhibits 
pH responsiveness, transforming the transparent solution to a cloudy suspension 
containing insoluble hierarchical nanoaggregates of various dendritic morphologies. 52 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
This cloudy suspension undergoes the UCST-type phase transition with tunable 
cloud points, transforming it into a clear solution upon heating. 
Incorporation of amino acid residues into the structure of synthetic polymers is 
promising for the design various non-biological biomimetic polyampholytes (mac￾romolecular architectures) with stimuli-responsive, self-assembling, tunable chirop￾tical, catalytic, and optoelectronic properties [289]. Several reviews and research 
articles were devoted to synthetic protocol of amino acids–based synthetic polymers 
[290, 291]. 
In consideration of the behavior of synthetic polyampholytes, amphoteric poly￾peptides, and IPRs, the main attention can be paid to pH-dependent isoelectric state 
(isoelectric or isoionic point, pHIEP or pHIIP, respectively) when the overall charge 
of macromolecules is close to zero; the polymer chain is quasi-neutral; solubility, 
average size, viscosity, and swelling degrees are minimal; turbidity is maximal; con￾formation is compact or globular; and electrophoretic mobility is zero. 
Behavior of synthetic polyampholytes, polyampholytic polypeptides, proteins, 
and IDPs possessing random, block, and brush structures in aqueous and aqueous 
salt solutions is compared. Commonality of phase portraits for proteins, polypep￾tides, block polyampholytes, and IDPs is pH-dependent globularization, aggre￾gation, precipitation, swelling, and deswelling. In case of gelatin A  and B, the 
electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged groups leads to collapsing and 
self-aggregation of protein molecules at the pHIEP [67, 326, 327]. At the isoelectric 
point of gelatin “A” (pHIEP = 7.0), the persistence length increases more than two 
times, leading to the expansion of the macromolecular chain with increase in salt 
concentration [326–328]. Displaying of the “antipolyelectrolyte” effect or unfolding 
of amphoteric macromolecules at the isoelectric point in the presence of neutral salts 
is a common phenomenon for annealed, quenched, and betaine-type polyampholytes 
[318]. Temperature- and pH-dependent aggregation of block copolypeptides based 
on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-poly(L-glutamic acid-co-L-lysine) mimics 
stimuli-sensitive behavior of polyampholytic biomacromolecules [43]. Nano- and 
microsized as well as monolithic polyampholyte gels exhibit collapsing at the pHIEP 
and swelling at pH > pHIEP or pH < pHIEP [329–332]. Their conformation switching 
between helix and random coil was confrmed by CD, NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, 
and DLS. Near the pHIEP of block polyampholyte, the total charge of amphoteric 
chains is completely neutralized, and aggregation or phase separation (coacervation) 
takes place [39, 70]. Increasing of the ionic strength (µ) of the solution adjusted by the 
addition of KCl leads to a narrowing of the precipitation region, and at higher values 
of µ = 0.3 mol·L-1, the block polyampholyte is entirely dissolved [92]. Dissolution 
of block polyampholyte is due to screening of the oppositely charged blocks on the 
macromolecules by KCl, which leads to unfolding of globule to coil. At pH below and 
above the pHIEP, spherical micelles consisting of either a non-charged acidic block 
surrounded by a positively charged corona or a non-charged basic block surrounded 
by a negatively charged corona is formed [39]. IDPs that lack the secondary structure 
and adopt an extended conformation are also attractive candidates for fabricating 
amphoteric polymer brushes [333]. An engineered protein (rNFH-SA) that belongs 
to IDPs adopts an extended, disordered conformation in solution and can be grafted 
in an oriented manner to solid supports to yield IDP brushes. The infuence of pH and Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 53 
ionic strength on the IDP brush height was evaluated. At pH >10.7, the carboxylic 
groups of L-glutamic acid are charged, while the L-lysine groups remain neutral. 
Electrostatic repulsion between uniformly charged carboxylate ions expands the IDP 
chain. At pH <6, the L-lysine moieties progressively protonated, accumulating the 
positive charges on IDP, and the whole macromolecular chain becoming as cationic 
polyelectrolyte expands again. At pHIEP ≈ 6.8, the electrostatic attraction between 
oppositely charged side chains along the length of the protein results in collapsed 
brush conformation. Such pHIEP-centered swelling has been previously observed for 
synthetic polyampholytes with randomly distributed charges [334–336]. The infu￾ence of ionic strength on the brush height was evaluated only at extremely high 
(pH = 10.9) and low (pH = 2.4) pHs, where in both cases the brush heights decreased 
with increasing ionic strength. However, it would be interesting to study the effect of 
ionic strength on IDP brush height at pHIEP, expecting its swelling that is a common 
phenomenon for synthetic polyampholytes. Thermodynamic analysis of the collapse 
transition profle of the polyampholyte gel underpins the analogy of the thermody￾namic behavior of globular proteins, emphasizing that the behavior of the collapsed 
polyampholyte hydrogel reproduces the behavior of globular proteins [337]. 
Thus, the common specifc features of proteins, polyampholytic polypeptides, 
IDPs, random, regular, and block polyampholytes possessing linear and crosslinked 
structures are formation of globular conformations at the pHIEP stabilized by cou￾lombic forces between opposite charges within single macromolecules. The location 
of charges along the macromolecular chain play a crucial role in the conformational 
behavior of the polyampholytes [338]. Aggregation of globules leads to either pre￾cipitation or coacervation. Deviation from the pHIEP transforms polyampholytes to 
positively or negatively charged polyelectrolytes and, consequently, to stretched 
conformation of macromolecular chains. Swelling of polyampholytes at the pHIEP 
upon addition of neutral salts demonstrates that the “antipolyelectrolyte” effect for 
proteins and synthetic polyampholytes is a common phenomenon [339]. Expansion 
of IDPs at (very) high salt concentration was shown by Johner and Joanny [313]. 
Conformational and phase behavior of IDPs can be understood and predicted using 
polyampholyte theories to describe average properties of macromolecules, such as 
radius of gyration, height of polymer brush, etc. The renewed interest of both the￾orists and experimentalists to IDPs is necessary for advanced theoretical investiga￾tions. It is obvious the structural and behavioral similarities between synthetic and 
natural polyampholytes are due to the presence of positive and negative charges. 
The location of opposite charges along the macromolecular chain plays an important 
role in the conformational and phase behaviors of the polyampholytes. Diagrams of 
states for IDPs and synthetic polyampholytes are similar. Commonality of phase por￾traits for proteins, polypeptides, block polyampholytes, and IDPs is pH-dependent 
globularization, aggregation, precipitation, swelling, and deswelling. “Complex 
coacervation” or liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is also a common phenom￾enon for globular proteins, IDPs, amphoteric polypeptides, and synthetic polyam￾pholytes. The specifc feature of proteins, polyampholytic polypeptides, IDPs, and 
synthetic polyampholytes is existence of the isoelectric point, where compaction, 
globularization, aggregation, coacervation, or precipitation take place. The common 
phenomenon is also the “antipolyelectrolyte” effect that leads to the dissolution of  
54 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
linear polyampholytes and swelling of polyampholyte gels and IDPs at the pHIEP 
upon addition of neutral salts. Structural and behavioral similarity between synthetic 
and natural polyampholytes can expand our knowledge and cause the renewed inter￾est of both theorists and experimentalists in advanced experimental and theoretical 
investigations. 
1.9 POLYAMPHOLYTIC BEHAVIOR OF 
INTERPOLYELECTROLYTE COMPLEXES (IPEC) 
Interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPEC) are the products of interaction of weak or 
strong polyelectrolytes in various combinations [340–343]. Formation of IPEC has no 
analogous in chemistry of low-molecular-weight compounds because the stabiliza￾tion of fnal products is mainly due to entropy factor. From the thermodynamic point 
of view, the complementarity of macromolecules bearing cationic and anionic groups 
is the driving force of PEC formation that is also responsible for self-organization of 
biopolymers. In dependence of charge density of interacting polyelectrolytes, con￾centration, stoichiometry, pH, ionic strength, organic solvent additives, IPEC parti￾cles can be maintained as clear solution, opaque solution, precipitation, and gel state. 
The preparation procedure of IPEC flms, fbers, or coatings includes the dissolution 
of IPEC in ternary system consisting of water, salt, and organic solvent. Interfacial 
ultrathin IPEC flms, membranes, and LbL flms can be formed when two high-con￾centrated polyelectrolytes are mixed [344] on the boundary of water-organic solvents 
[345, 346] by the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique [347, 348]. The exist￾ence of stoichiometric (SPEC) and non-stoichiometric (NPEC) polyelectrolyte com￾plexes is commonly recognized for today. As distinct from SPEC, where the molar 
ratio of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes involved into complexation reaction is 
1:1, NPEC are the products of cooperative interpolyelectrolyte reaction between 
oppositely charged polyelectrolytes with different polymerization degree or chain 
length taken in nonequivalent ratios. Block polyampholytes with the equal number of 
oppositely charged polyelectrolyte blocks are very close to SPEC, while block poly￾ampholytes with the excess of positively or negatively charged blocks are analogous 
to NPEC. However, the main difference between block polyampholytes and IPECs 
is that the chemical binding between two blocks leads to a loss of conformational 
and translational entropy. The electrophoretic mobilities and radius of the particles 
of block polyampholyte PDMAEM-b-PMANa (the molar ratio of base–acid segment 
is 1:1.8) and the mixture of PDMAEM and sodium salt of PMAA with the same 
molar ratio of polybase–polyacid = 1:1.8 were compared [69]. The IEPs of both sys￾tems are close to 6.0. The instability regions for the mixture of homopolyelectrolytes 
and the block polyampholytes are also similar and displaced near the IEP. However, 
for the mixture of homopolyelectrolytes, the strong complexation already starts at 
5.5< pH <8.0, whereas for block polyampholyte, it starts only at 4.5< pH <7.0. This 
fact is probably explained by additional hydrophobic stabilization of IPEC particles. 
The size of the stable IPEC at pH below 4.5 and above pH 9.0 is smaller than that 
of the copolymer, even though the length of the homopolymer molecules is larger. 
Isotachophoretic and viscometric results obtained for SPEC consisting of sodium 
salt of PAA (NaPAA) and poly[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl acrylate] show Water-Soluble Polyampholytes 55 
positive and negative charges at pH 4.6 and 8.3, respectively, and neutrality at pH 7.0 
[349, 350], whereas for NPEC consisting of poly(sodium acrylate-co-acrylamide) 
and poly[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl acrylate], the isoelectric pH corre￾sponds to 3.7. The value of the reduced viscosity at IEP increases with the growth of 
the ionic strength similar to annealed polyampholytes (Figure 1.17). 
Figure 1.17 shows the dependence of the reduced viscosity of the system [poly(so￾dium acrylate-co-acrylamide)]/[poly-2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl acrylate] 
on pH at μ = 0.05 (curve 1), 0.075 (curve 2), 0.25 (curve 3), and 0.5 (curve 4). 
Semi-interpenetrating polyelectrolyte networks (semi-IPPN) composed of 
crosslinked polybase and linear polyacid [351–353] repeat fairly the properties of 
equimolar polyampholytes. The semi-IPPN [352] also collapses in the range of 3< 
pH <8 due to the formation of IPEC between oppositely charged groups. The remark￾able prediction of T. Tanaka, who discovered at the end of the 1970s the multiple vol￾ume phase transition phenomenon for polyampholyte gels [159, 354], demonstrates 
many stable swollen states against pH change. The phenomenon is believed to occur 
by the combination of hydrophobic interactions, the hydrogen bonding, the repulsive 
and attractive forces between the same and opposite charges. The similar behaviors 
of synthetic and natural gels will open a new insight into the deeper understanding 
of the gel and life sciences. 
The swelling of polyampholyte gels [355] at the IEP with increasing of the ionic 
strength can be accounted for the screening of ionic network by small ions. PEC

56 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
brushes and membranes derived from the polyelectrolyte complexes [356] also show 
amphoteric character. Minimum swelling degree of membranes is due to coulombic 
attractions between long sequences of acidic and basic groups of polyelectrolytes. 
The isoelectric point of IPEC solution and membrane where the macromolecule is 
electroneutral is arranged at pH ~6.5 [357]. 
Authors [358–360] observed the oscillation of the polyampholyte gel and IPEC 
membrane upon applied DC electric feld in the presence of 0.01 and 0.15 M NaCl. 
Both amphoteric gel and IPEC membrane consist of three major zones: (a) a cati￾on-selective polyacidic zone, (b) an anion selective polybasic zone, and (c) a neutral 
polyampholytic zone. The qualitative explanation of oscillation without chemical 
reaction is that under the externally imposed potential across the gel sample and 
membrane, the current-carrying cations will fow from left to right. Simultaneously, 
the current-carrying anions will fow the opposite side. As a result, the accumulation 
of salt in ampholytic region will take place. This salt accumulation, in turn, will 
produce two effects. On the one hand, the increased osmotic pressure in (c) neutral 
zone will require water fow, with the consequent increase of hydrostatic pressure. 
On the other hand, the increased salt concentration will induce the contraction of 
polyanionic and polycationic zones. If the point is reached where the increase of 
hydrostatic pressure with concentration, resulting from the polyelectrolyte confg￾urational change, is greater than the corresponding osmotic pressure increment, the 
fow of the solvent will be reversed. At this stage, then, the process becomes regen￾erative, with any increase in salt concentration tending to enforce solvent from the 
zone c, thereby driving the concentration yet higher. During the regenerative process, 
however, salt will begin to leave the ampholytic region because of its high concen￾tration gradient and will continue its fow out after the membrane has reached the 
point of maximum contraction. Thus, the process enters a phase of decreasing salt 
concentration, with consequent relaxation of IPEC membrane matrix, and eventual 
return of the membrane to its initial state. The analytical solution of this phenomenon 
has been presented. 
The behavioral closeness of polyelectrolyte complexes to polyampholytes or vice 
versa can be formulated as follows: 
1. Stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric PEC might be considered as model 
of charge-balanced (the same number of negative and positive charges) 
and charge-unbalanced (an excess of positive or negative charges) 
polyampholytes. 
2. Stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric PECs have a compact structure and 
minimum solubility at the isoelectric pH. 
3. Near the IEP, both PECs and polyampholytes are able to swell at high￾salinity media. 
4. The oscillation mechanism of PEC membranes and polyampholyte gels has 
the same nature and explanation. 
5. The “isoelectric” effect observed at the IEP of polyampholytes is also 
observed for PEC.

2 Stimuli-Responsive 
Properties of 
Hydrophobically 
Modifed Polyampholytes 
(HMPA) in Solution 
Polyampholytes consisting of hydrophobic “tails” and hydrophilic “heads,” due to 
their amphiphilic character, belong to extensively self-organized systems, such as 
monolayers, micelles, and vesicles of natural polymers and polymeric lipids [1–3]. 
In elementary cases, where water-soluble polyampholytes contain hydrophobic 
units, for example, a long alkyl chain, a comblike architecture is obtained, and the 
products can be qualifed as hydrophobically modifed polyampholytes (HMPA). 
Even the presence of very few hydrophobic groups in macromolecular chain can 
have a strong effect on the properties of polyampholytes. The hydrophobic groups 
may be replaced in the main chain or in anionic and cationic units. Some ter￾polymers [4] and polymeric betaines [5] composed of oppositely charged groups 
and hydrophobic units also refer to HMPA. In most cases, the hydrophobic “core” 
of the micelle-like structures is made of hydrophobic groups of polyampholytes 
and captures small hydrophobic molecules, while the outer “corona” is respon￾sible for the stabilization of the resulting structure in water [6]. The HMPA may 
also be prepared by complexation of ordinary polyampholytes with anionic and/or 
cationic surfactants [7]. Potentiometric titrations, in combination with isothermal 
calorimetric titrations, have shown the important role of hydrophobic interactions 
between sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and strongly alternating polyampholytes, 
that is, copolymers of dimethyldiallylammonium chloride and maleic acid deriva￾tives [8]. Partial neutralization of positive or negative charges by ionic surfactants 
can lead to more hydrophobic complexes [9], surfactant-induced micellization of 
amphoteric macromolecules, or flm tuning in polyampholyte-modifed micro￾emulsions [10], which is of special interest at the point of synthesis of nanoparti￾cles [11]. Exhibiting single, double, and triple responsiveness to external stimuli 
parameters, such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, solvent nature, light irradia￾tion, nature of surfactant, etc., separately or in combination, the HMPA offers great 
potential in the design of smart materials for target applications in the pharmaceu￾tical, agricultural, cosmetics, enhanced oil recovery, and water remediation felds. 
For the purpose of the fabrication of “smart” nano-objects, like HMPA, a number 
of bottom-up approaches have been developed via macromolecular engineering.

Stimuli-responsive block copolymers that present reversible self-assembly prop￾erties and convert free chains to micelles are called “schizophrenic” block copoly￾mers (Figure 2.1) [12]. 
Polyampholytes with hydrophobic groups generally form clusters having a smaller 
Rg than those for polyampholytes having the same charge ratio but without hydro￾phobic groups. The hydrophobic groups act as “sticky” groups between the nearby 
polymers and even between segments within the polymer chains, resulting in larger 
polyampholyte clusters. By fne-tuning the concentration and composition of poly￾ampholytes, charge ratios, and the nature and content of hydrophobic groups, it is 
possible to effectively mimic the conformations of fexible chains, hard spheres, as 
well as the intermediate case of branched polymers, which may take the forms of 
stars, randomly branched, or “gel” structure [13]. 
2.1 THERMO- AND PH-SENSITIVE HMPA 
Tanchuk et al. [14, 15] studied the effect of temperature on the behavior of hydro￾phobic copolymers of α-olefnes (C6H12−C16H28) and mono-N(3-dimethylaminopro￾pyl)amide of maleic acid in aqueous media. It noticed unusual results: the reduced 
viscosity of polyampholyte-containing dodecyl groups increased with the escalation 
of temperature. When T was raised over 340 K, the solution became a gel (sol-gel 
transition). The gel was transformed back into the liquid state (gel-sol transition)  
Stimuli-Responsive Properties of HMPA in Solution 81 
when the system was cooled. The temperature-dependent sol-gel transition of HMPA 
can be used as viscosifying and plugging agents in EOR. 
The effect of hydrophobic moieties (pentyl-, benzyl-, or dodecyl-acrylamide 
comonomers) on the UCST of sulfobetaine copolymers in aqueous media has been 
studied for statistically designed acrylamido sulfobetaine copolymers [16]. A copol￾ymer series containing between 4 and 65 mol.% of pentylacrylamide exhibited tem￾perature-independent water solubility in a broad compositional range, which was 
ascribed to an entropic contribution of the fexible pentyl chains, whereas decreasing 
the solubility of copolymers containing 5−65 mol% of benzylacrylamide comono￾mers with temperature is accounted for by the enthalpic contribution of functional 
groups. UCST shifts of benzyl-modifed sulfobetaine copolymers were demonstrated 
reversibly and reproducibly with the addition of NaCl. The described approach, 
which tunes UCST shifts of polysulfobetaines into a relatively more accessible 
temperature/molar mass range, provides a pathway to incorporate smart/biological 
functionality into polybetaines and build complex polymeric architectures with zwit￾terionic fragments, resulting in extending the application of these smart materials. 
Jiménez and Yoshida [17] reported a triple thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropy￾lacrylamide-block-N,N-dimethyl-N-(3-(methacrylamido)propyl) ammonio propane 
sulfonate), poly-(NIPAAm-b-MPDSAH), which exhibits two UCST-type and one 
LCST-type transitions. The polymer self-assembles into vesicles at temperatures 
below 25°C and into small micelles at temperatures above 60°C. Below the frst 
UCST-type transition temperature, the Rh
90 is approximately 540 nm and represents 
the micelle aggregates or vesicles. When the solution reaches the LCST, the polymer 
restructures into larger aggregates, reaching an Rh
90 value of approximately 1,600 nm 
at 55°C. These large aggregates then disassemble into small structures that possibly 
correspond to small micelles with poly(NIPAAm) core. Moreover, the thermorespon￾sivity and solubility of the polymer strongly depend on the pH of the solution; at 
acid pH, only two transitions exist, and at basic pH, mainly one transition remains. 
Because the temperature and pH are variables that can be easily changed in biological 
and chemical systems, the study of thermo- and pH-responsive polymers is compel￾ling. Temperature-responsive self-assembly of PDMAEMA-b-PAA was studied in 
[18]. The LCST of the PDMAEMA84-b-PAA18 solution with C = 1.0 g·L-1 at pH 9.5 
is around 49°C; when T is smaller than the LCST, dendrites with trunks and branches 
are observed, whereas dendrites with densely slim branches appear at T > LCST. This 
is interpreted by the following: the PDMAEMA-b-PAA copolymer produces a uni￾form solution of the polymer chains at the relatively low T since the both blocks are 
water-soluble. The PDMAEMA-b-PAA polymer chains take drying clustering tran￾sition on the solid substrate surface from a molecularly uniform state in a water solu￾tion. The uniform chain distribution slows down the roughening kinetics and prolongs 
the incubation period, resulting in wide trunks with less branches. While T is higher 
than LCST, the PDMAEMA-b-PAA polymer chains form micelles. The cores of the 
micelles are made of PDMAEMA in aqueous solution, owing to the hydrophobic 
interactions between the PDMAEMA blocks. Due to coalescing of the PAA-corona 
at high temperature, the micelles form large aggregates in the drying process, which 
leads to substantial concentration variations. The driving forces independently develop 
side branches for the growth of the solid phase. Diblock copolymers consisting of 82 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
poly(N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(6-acrylamidohexanoic acid) 
(pDEA-b-pAaH) exhibit core/shell micelles and inverted micelles under low and high 
pH conditions [19]. Block polyampholytes completely precipitated near the isoelec￾tric point (IEP) due to the electrostatic interaction between the cationic pDEA and ani￾onic pAaH blocks. The hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of colloidal particles ranges from 5 
to 6 nm between pH 5 and 8, while at pH 3 and pH 10, the polymer formed micelles 
with Rh= 29 and 36 nm, respectively. Zero value of the zeta potential at pH 4.9–5.6 
suggests that oppositely charged pDEA and pAaH blocks are stoichiometrically neu￾tralized. The formation of intramolecular polyelectrolyte complexes near the IEP is 
specifc for most block polyampholytes [20]. 
The vesicles assembled from pDEA-b-pAaH were able to include nonionic 
dextran guest molecules into the interior water phase. The well-defned block pol￾yampholyte poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PAA-b￾PDMAEMA) is able to form two different micelles, PDMAEMA-core micelles 
and PAA-core micelles, by tuning the pH of the solutions [21, 22]. The results of 
TEM, DLS, and zeta potential of PAA-b-PDMAEMA measured in aqueous solu￾tion at different pHs revealed that the micelles formed in the acidic region were 
spherical, while wormlike when formed in the basic region. TEM results indicate 
that the sizes of micelles are a little smaller than that of DLS result, although the 
micelles have a good size distribution. The inconsistency is a result of the different 
measurement methods: the micelle sizes obtained by DLS represent the hydrated 
state of the micelles in which the shell chains are stretched, but the TEM measure￾ments were obtained from a dried state. The morphology of PDMAEMA84-b-PAA18 
aggregates is similar to fractal aggregate structures observed on the TEM grid after 
drying an aqueous solution of strongly alternating hydrophobic polyampholytes, that 
is, poly(N,N’-diallyl-N,N’-dimethylammonium-alt-N-phenylmaleamic carboxylate 
phenylmaleamic carboxylate (PalPh) [23]. 
It is obvious that big aggregates are formed near the IEP of block polyampholyte. 
Since the composition of PDMAEMA84-b-PAA18 is enriched by the PDMAEMA block, 
one can expect that the position of the IEP is replaced in the basic region. The com￾parison of the morphology of two block polyampholytes derived from PDMAEMA￾b-PAA and studied by different authors [18, 21, 22] shows consistency of results and 
formation of wormlike micelles around pH 9.0 in both cases. Thus, depending on pH, 
the PDMAEMA84-b-PAA18 block copolymer was able to form aggregates, including 
spherical, worm, and rod or needle. 
The most important property of hydrophobically modifed polyampholytes 
(HMPA) described by authors [24–26] is their ability to self-assemble into “schiz￾ophrenic” micelles, lamellar aggregate, vesicles, and hydrogels, depending on pH 
[27, 28]. The CD study confrms that the pH-responsive self-assembly of linear￾dendron-like polyampholyte, poly-(L-lysine)-b-D2-poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLL40-
b-D2-(PLGA15)4) (where D2 is the second generation of poly(amido amine), was 
accompanied by the formation of spherical micelles with PLGA core at low pH, and 
rod-like micelles with PLL core at high pH, transiting the coil-to-helix conforma￾tional change of PLGA and PLL. According to TEM and SEM results, at pH 1.4 the 
size of large compound micelles (LCMs) is around 2 μm. At pH 3.4, LCMs are trans￾formed to form wormlike micelles with large aspect ratios of length-to-diameter. The Stimuli-Responsive Properties of HMPA in Solution 83 
core diameter and shell thickness of the micelle are approximately 10 nm and 6 nm, 
respectively. The micelle shape at pH 6.4 shows large compound vesicles (LCVs) 
with an average size of around 140 nm, but at a pH of 10.2, the majority of the aggre￾gates are simple vesicles with diameter of 50 nm. While pH is increased to 12.1, 
PLL forms a helix conformation, and the structures with many villus-like branches 
are perceived. The length of rigid villus can be many micrometers long. The star 
terpolymer, made of nine hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) arms and nine poly(2-vinyl￾pyridine)-b-poly(acrylic acid) (P2VP-b-PAA) diblock copolymer arms, all emanated 
from a tightly crosslinked poly(divinyl benzene) (PDVB) common nodule; in fact, 
the (PS33)9-PDVB-[P2VP126-b-PAA69]9 exhibited various nanostructured self-as￾sembling, depending on pH [29]. At pH 1.4, the self-assembly process is governed 
by two moieties. The P2VP moieties adopt a stretched conformation through high 
protonation, and PS moieties are mainly responsible for self-assembly via the hydro￾phobic driving force. At pH 2, the H-bonding interactions among the star terpoly￾mers most likely lead to the formation of larger compound micelles (LCM) with a 
radius of 50 or 100–150 nm, and even larger associates with a radius of 310–370 nm. 
At the IEP, the star terpolymer becomes fully hydrophobic and precipitates due 
to the formation of intramolecular polyelectrolyte complexes between P2VP and 
PAA blocks. At pH >7, the PS/P2VP blocks form the hydrophobic core, surrounded 
by ionized PAA corona. These multifunctional stars can potentially be used to cre￾ate smart organic/inorganic hybrids, Langmuir–Blodget monolayers, emulsifying 
agents for the dispersion of nanotubes and/or graphene sheets, nanocarriers in aque￾ous environments for a controlled multimodal delivery of small and large molecules, 
and responsive hydrogels. The assembly of schizophrenic vesicles consisting of the 
polypeptide diblock copolymer poly(L-glutamic acid)-b-poly(L-lysine) (PGA-b￾PLys) is reversible in moderate acidic or basic aqueous solutions [30]. At acidic 
pH, the PGA block forms a neutral and more compact R-helical structure by tak￾ing its secondary conformation from a charged coil, but its solubility decreases 
with the change of the structure. For this assembly, hydrophobicity is the major 
force. The core of the aggregates is formed from insoluble PGA, while PLys form 
the shell. Under basic conditions, the protonated PLys block (-NH3
+) forms the 
core of the aggregates by converting to neutral and less-soluble -NH2 groups. 
The hydrodynamic radius RH of the PGA-b-PLys at acid and basic pH conditions 
is equal to 110 and 175 nm, respectively, and shows a narrow size distribution. 
These nanoparticles may be candidates in the application of nanobiotechnolo￾gies. Recently, it was shown that synthetic double-block copolypeptoids, that is, 
poly(N-(n-propyl)glycine)x-block-poly(N-methylglycine)y, show a very interest￾ing temperature-dependent aggregation and crystallization behavior, depending on 
the more hydrophobic thermosensitive block length [31, 32]. Linear copolymers 
of [3-(methacryloylamino)propyl]trimethylammonium chloride, acrylic acid, and 
benzo[18] crown-6-acrylamide (MAPTAC-AA-BCAm) showed multiresponsive 
behavior with respect to pH, ion species, and salt concentration [33]. Here, the 
crown ether part of copolymers can be considered a hydrophobic moiety but, due 
to complexation with specifc ions, such as Ba2+, can behave like a fxed positive 
charge and can control the total charge of macromolecules. The copolymer swells 
at both low and high pH and shrinks at the IEP. The shrunken copolymer at the 84 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
IEP swells by adding Ba2+ ions. The shrinking–swelling cycle, by the addition of 
Ba2+ ions and [18] crown-6, is observed alternately. The reverse swelling–shrink￾ing of MAPTAC-AA-BCAm in response both to pH and ion recognition, similar 
to biopolymers, makes them ideal candidates in separation technology, biotech￾nology, and drug delivery systems. 
2.2 SOLVENT-SENSITIVE HMPA 
The self-assembly of zwitterionic amphiphilic homopolymers to form micelle-like 
and inverse micelle-like assemblies depends on the solvent environment [34]. DLS 
and TEM results indicate that the sizes of assembled structures are 90 nm and 400 nm 
in water and toluene, respectively. However, the sizes of these aggregates from TEM 
analysis are found to be smaller. This small variance is understandable, as the sample 
is air-dried during the TEM preparation in contrast to the hydrodynamic diameter 
determined in DLS measurements. The ability of micellar polymers to encapsulate 
the hydrophobic guest molecule Nile Red in water, and of reverse micellar polymers 
to imbibe the hydrophilic guest molecule Rose Bengal in toluene, was demonstrated. 
Moreover, due to the ionization of glycine, the zwitterionic polymer containing gly￾cine betaine reversibly changes between cationic, zwitterionic, and anionic forms 
according to the pH of the solution. 
Solvent-sensitive micelles were prepared from the copolymer encompassing 
zwitterionic sulfobetaines, poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(N,N-diethylaminoethyl￾methacrylate)-r-poly(N-(3-sulfopropyl)-N-methacryloxyethy-N,N-diethylammoni￾umbetaine) (PCLDEAS), by solvent evaporation method at various water/THF ratio 
[35]. SEM images show that the micelles possess spherical or sphere-like shapes. 
The average sizes are 90, 60, 40, and 110 nm when the ratio of THF to water is varied 
from 1:50 to 1:1. The trend of micelle sizes is in good agreement with the data from 
DLS. The infuence of copolymer concentration, and the medium composition on the 
micelle size, size distribution, and zeta potential, as well as their infuence on drug 
loading/releasing, has been investigated. 
Another parameter is the composition of the solvent, which can be applied to 
change the aggregation of hydrophobically modifed polybetaines. Figure  2.1 
explains the changes of the intrinsic viscosity and of the swelling degree of linear and 
crosslinked poly3-[(2-carboxy-1-methylethyl) dodecylaminocrotonate] (PCMED￾DAC) in water–DMSO mixtures [36]. 
The betaine segments of PCMEDDAC incline to form insoluble aggregates in 
pure DMSO surrounded by a hydrophobic corona. Both the swelling degree and 
the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer solution are increased with the addition of 
10–15 vol.% of water to DMSO. A rational elucidation for this fnding is owing to 
unfolding of the macromolecules, since the betaine moieties of PCMEDDAC are 
preferentially solvated by water, and of the dodecyl chains by the organic solvent. 
However, an increase of water in the solvent mixture leads to a shrinking of the mac￾romolecules, since a reversible micelle is formed and stabilized by interactions of the 
long alkyl chains. The insolubility of PCMEDDAC in water is possibly related to a 
strong compactization of the polymer particles due to the hydrophobic interactions 
of dodecyl groups. Stimuli-Responsive Properties of HMPA in Solution 85

In another report [37], the reversibility of self-assembled vesicles with pH is also 
studied for poly(acrylic acid)-b-polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) triblock poly￾ampholytes in ternary mixtures containing DMF, THF, and water. Other, copolymers 
such as N,N-dimethyldiallylammonium and alkyl (aryl) derivatives of maleamic 
acids (butylmaleamic acid, phenylmaleamic acid, 4-butylphenylmaleamic acid), 
abbreviated as polyampholytes of an APA series (where R = C4H9 (APA-2), C6H5
(APA-3), with increase of the hydrophobic moieties of maleamic acid, are subject 
to the conformational state change from compact to extended and from extended to 
compact structure in water, water–ethanol, and ethanol solutions [38, 39]. In order 
to understand the function of hydrophobic interactions for stabilization of the com￾pact structure, the self-assembly performance of APA-2 and APA-3 is investigated 
in water, ethanol, and water–ethanol mixtures containing 0.15 N KCl. It is found 
that the low reduced viscosities of APA-2 and APA-3 in salted water are gradually 
increased with an addition of ethanol. The maximum values of the reduced viscos￾ities are found to be 53 vol.-% of ethanol for APA-2 and 64 vol.-% of ethanol for 
APA-3 in a water–ethanol mixture containing 0.15 N KCl. A relatively high ethanol 
amount in the mixture is required to unfold the hydrophobic polyampholyte APA-3. 
Additional increase of ethanol in the water–ethanol mixture decreases the reduced 
viscosities. The compact structures of APA-2 and APA-3 in water are formed via 
hydrophobic interactions among butyl and benzyl groups of maleamic acid. Extend￾ing the amphoteric macromolecules in a water–ethanol blend can be explained with 86 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
enhancement of the interaction between solvent mixture and the macromolecular 
chain. For example, favorable interactions of ionic parts of APA with water, and 
hydrophobic parts with organic solvent. In ethanol, the viscosity of APA-2 and APA-3 
decreases because of the low solubility of ionic parts and enhanced condensation of 
counterions with polyions. Furthermore, it was shown that the acidity constant (pKa° 
value) of the carboxylic group in the copolymer strongly depends on the R group, 
defned earlier [38]. Therefore, the pKa° value is decreased from 6.6 ± 0.03 to 5.3 ± 
0.03 by the substitution of the proton H by the phenyl rest (similar to sample APA-3). 
However, the change of the acidity of the carboxylic group infuences not only the 
conformational behavior of the alternating polyampholytes but also the interactions 
with anionic surfactants, like SDS, in water [7], as well as in water-in-oil microemul￾sion droplets [8]. This leads to a flm tuning in microemulsions and surface-active 
polyampholyte/SDS complexes [9]. 
2.3 SALT-SENSITIVE HMPA 
Amphoteric copolymers composed of acrylamide (AAm), dimethyl-dodecyl-al￾lyl ammonium chloride (MDAC), and 2-(4-acrylamido-propyldimethylammonic)-
sodium acetate (AMPA) [40]; AAm, acrylic acid (AA), and dimethyldodecyl 
(2-acrylamidoethyl)ammonium bromide (AMQC12) [41]; AAm, sodium salt of 
acrylic acid (SSAA), and dimethyl benzyl aminoethyl acrylate chloride (DMBAEM) 
[42]; diblock copolymer of n-butylacrylate (n-BA) and carboxybetaine (PGLBT) 
[43], poly[acrylamide-co-N,N′-dimethyl (methylmethacryloyl ethyl)ammonium 
propane sulfonate-co-cetyl dimethyl allyl ammonium chloride] (PADC) [44] in 
aqueous solution form micellar structures and exhibit pH and salt sensitivity [24]. 
The apparent viscosity of AAm-SSAA-DMBAEM in the salt solution increases with 
increasing concentration of salt stemming from the “antipolyelectrolyte” effect of 
polyampholyte. This illustrates that amphoteric polymers have excellent salt toler￾ance. In the case of AAm-AMPA-MDAC, the addition of NaCl causes the spread￾ing and adopting of random coil conformation due to “antipolyelectrolyte” effect, 
for example, weakening of intra- and interionic contacts. Screening of oppositely 
charged units of hydrophobic polybetaines by a 1:1 electrolyte solution leads to an 
increase of Rh from 160 nm in water to 400 nm in saline environment. 
The zwitterionic amphiphilic diblock copolymers change properties from sur￾face-active to non-surface-active with an increase of salt. Simultaneously, the hydro￾dynamic radius of the micelle is enlarged with an increase in salt concentration, 
though the aggregation numbers of the micelles are lowered. All these observations 
can be reasonably illustrated by the “antipolyelectrolyte” effect, for example, the 
attraction forces in polyzwitterionic coils are screened by the added salt. Conse￾quently, the chain size increases and leads to an apparent increase in viscosity. 
Authors [45] assembled the reversible “self-locked” (crosslinked) micelles consist￾ing of hydrophilic poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) block, a salt-responsive 
poly(3[2-(N-methyl acrylamido)ethyldimethylammonio]propane sulfonate) 
(PMAEDAPS) middle block, and a pH-responsive poly(3-acrylamido-3-methyl 
butanoic acid) (PAMBA) block. Above pH 4.6 and in the presence of 0.5 M salt, the 
triblock copolymer exists in unimeric form. Lowering the pH of the solution to <4.6 Stimuli-Responsive Properties of HMPA in Solution 87 
brings in the multimeric micelles. At these conditions, the hydrophobic AMBA block 
that forms the micelle core is protonated, while the DMA and MAEDAPS blocks 
remain soluble and are in the corona of the micelle. The addition of salt screens the 
electrostatic interaction of the zwitterions and causes the MAEDAPS middle block 
to form an extended, more hydrated conformation. Moreover, the elimination of the 
salt by dialysis causes the zwitterionic moieties of the polybetaine segments to inter￾act, resulting in a “self-locking” of the structure. This crosslinking can be readily 
inverted by the addition of electrolyte at physiological pH. 
The effect of the hydrophobicity and salt on the temperature responsiveness 
of polymeric micelles composed of hydrophilic, poly(sulfopropyl dimethylam￾monium propylacrylamide), (PSPP) and hydrophobic, poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) 
(PEHA), poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA), poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA), or poly(n￾hexyl acrylate) (PnHA) blocks, showed that the temperature-responsive character 
of polybetainic micelles increases in the following sequence: PEA > PnBA > 
PnHA [46]. The phase transition temperature of polymeric micelles is controlled 
by adjusting the ratio of the PSPP blocks, the hydrophobicity of the core part, 
the concentration of the polymer aqueous solution, and the concentration of the 
added salt. 
Homo- [47] and copolymers [48] of sulfobetaines undergo irreversible gela￾tion upon heating, and core–shell (“conventional” and “inverse” micelles) transi￾tions upon changing the medium from deionized water to an electrolyte solution. 
According to DLS and TEM studies in deionized water, the shape of micelles 
is spherical (ca. 45 nm in size), while in saline water, the vesicles are formed 
with a radius 150 nm. Dual-responsive shape memory exhibited the hydrophobi￾cally modifed polyampholyte hydrogels based on acrylamide, acrylic acid, and 
dimethylhexadecyl[2(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate]ammonium bromide 
(AAm-AA-C16DMAEMA) [49]. These hydrogels become bendable and molda￾ble upon heating and return to their hard state while cooling to the initial temper￾ature. The Fe3+ and NaCl induce shape memory performance for the cylindrical 
shape of the polymer. The U-shaped structures fxed in 40 mM Fe3+ or 3 M NaCl 
solution return to the initial linear shape when it is incubated into 1.7 M ascorbic 
acid solution or soaked into deionized water. The cyclicity of shape memory 
behaviors is evaluated by measuring the shape fxity ratio and the shape recovery 
ratio (Rf
) for each cycle. In both Fe3+ solution and deionized water, the average 
value of Rf
 approached 95% during three circulatory cycles. Thus, hydrophobic 
associations in amphoteric gel maintain the permanent shape instead of chemical 
crosslinkers. 
2.4 LIGHT-SENSITIVE HMPA 
The self-assembly behavior of HMPA may be controlled by incorporating photo￾chromic groups into the macromolecules. In this design, the polarity of the block 
changes with photoreaction and results in a change of the hydrophilic–hydrophobic 
balance for controlling the structures of aggregates. In the study of the physical– 
chemistry properties of the amphoteric diblock copolymer, (EMAAB)m-b-
(GLBT)n, consisting of the carboxymethyl betaine monomer (called GLBT), and  
88 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
4-ethoxy-4′-methacrylamide (EMAAB) with UV light [50], the prominent absorp￾tion of polymer solution at 361 nm, originating from the π–π* transition, is consid￾erably reduced after light exposure. A noticeable absorption at 439 nm comes from 
the n–π* transition (due to photoisomerization from trans to cis upon irradiation). 
UV absorption of the polymer solution after irradiation was measured at certain time 
intervals under the dark condition (or the polymer solution is kept in the dark condi￾tion). The absorption peak at 360 nm is recovered to its original form with time. This 
proves that the isomerization is a reversible process. At the same time, the surface 
tension (ST) measurement of the polymer solutions is utilized to investigate the sur￾face activity properties of block copolymers at different pH values. 
Diblock copolymers (EMAAB)24-b-(GLBT)60, (EMAAB)72-b-(GLBT)60, and 
(EMAAB)98-b-(GLBT)60 are surface-active at pH 7 due to micellization of EMAAB 
block hydrated by GLBT block in zwitterionic form. In this case, some hydropho￾bic EMAAB parts tend to be accumulated on the air–water surface and reduce the 
ST of solution. The GLBT moiety exists as cationic and anionic form at pH 2 and 
12, respectively. However, the ST of the copolymer does not change. In contrast, a 
substantial increase in ST was detected after UV irradiation. This phenomenon is 
illustrated correlating with the alteration in the hydrophobic–hydrophilic balance 
of copolymer, which is caused by the alteration in polarity of the azobenzene block 
after irradiation. According to DLS measurement, the sizes of the aggregates in 
all pH ranges and block ratios are between 120 and 180 nm. After UV irradiation, 
the vesicles disrupt and transform into micelles of 30−40 nm at all pHs. The TEM 
results further prove the proposed hypothesis: a morphology change from vesicles 
to micelles after UV irradiation. The morphological change can be reversed with 
exposure to visible light. In this transformation, vesicles are reformed. The revers￾ibility of self-assembled polymers, such as the azobenzene–betaine system with 
photostimulation, makes them a potential candidate for biomedical applications, 
including drug delivery studies. 
The most interesting and less-considered systems are dual-stimuli-responsive 
polyampholytes, described by authors in [32]. The organic photochromic com￾pound transformation vs. light is well-known. For example, nonpolar spiropyran 
(Sp) is isomerized to zwitterionic merocyanine (Mc) upon UV light irradiation and 
reverted to Sp form in response to visible light irradiation [33]. Introduction of Sp 
into the macromolecular chain of amphoteric block copolymer poly[1′-(2-meth￾acryloxyethyl)-3′,3′-dimethyl-6-nitrospiro-(2H-1-benzopyran-2,2′-indoline)]-
b-poly(acrylic acid) (PSPMA-b-PAA) allowed the obtaining of both light- and 
pH-sensitive micellar systems. The PSPMA block is both light- and pH-sensitive 
due to photochemical isomerization of spiropyran moieties from Sp to Mc and 
as a result of the protonation of Mc (McH) favoring isomerization of chromo￾phores from Sp to Mc, while PAA block is pH-sensitive due to the ionization of the 
carboxylic group. This is good evidence that spiropyran-based polymers exhibit 
a “schizophrenic” micellization behavior in response to light or pH stimulus in 
aqueous system via conjugating with pH-responsive, water-soluble polymer. Both 
TEM and DLS results show the diameter of spherical aggregates ranging from 6 to 
200 nm. The dual-stimuli-responsive system can potentially be exploited for both 
environmental and biological applications.  
Stimuli-Responsive Properties of HMPA in Solution 89 
2.5 LANGMUIR–BLODGETT AND LBL FILMS OF HMPA 
The adsorption effects of polyampholytes at surfaces and various interfaces play 
an important role in many biological and technological processes [51]. A  better 
understanding of adsorption and desorption processes in the presence of polyam￾pholytes is of fundamental importance in different felds of application, for example, 
in medicine and biotechnology, as well as membrane technology, and wastewater 
treatment. The Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) flm formation of poly(N,N-diallyl-N-oc￾tadecylamine-alt-maleic acid) with two amphiphilic fuorophores (alkyl-substituted 
rhodamine dyes) was examined in more detail [52, 53]. The π–A isotherm of the 
hydrophobic polyampholyte at the surface of air and water is a characteristic fea￾ture of the monolayer in the liquid state. Mixed monolayers show improved packing 
of the hydrophobic chains due to the incorporation of the hydrophobic dye mole￾cules into the packed octadecyl polymer side chains of the aggregates. Furthermore, 
electrostatic forced interactions between the anionic moieties of the polyampholyte 
and cationic groups of dye lead to conformational rearrangements of the hydrophilic 
parts of the polymer. When the molar ratio of the dye to the hydrophobic polyam￾pholyte is fxed at 17:83 mol.%, the fuorescence quantum yield and the emitting 
properties show the best results. LB monolayers of hydrophobic polybetaines having 
tetradecyl- and octadecyl groups can be observed by spreading experiments [54]. 
Specifc areas of 0.6± 0.05 nm2 monomeric unit-1 at collapsed state can be observed 
in the LB flms, combined with the absorption maximum at 255 and 270 nm. 
Additional experiments were performed with terpolymers of hydrophobic pol￾ystyrene (PS) and the hydrophilic diblock copolymer poly(2-vinyl-pyridine)-b￾poly(acrylic acid) (P2VP-b-PAA) because of the interesting pH-dependent properties 
of the two individual blocks [28]. The surface behavior of LB monolayers made of het￾eroatom star block terpolymers (PS)n(P2VP-b-PAA)n, (n = number of arms, 9 or 22), 
assembled at different pH values, was investigated at the water and solid surfaces [55]. 
Changes of the surface area per molecule (A = 50, 102, 130, and 85 nm2) of the block 
copolymer (PS)9(P2VP-b-PAA)9 at pH 1, 3.5, 6, and 10 are accompanied by different 
macromolecular conformations at various pH values. At pH = 1, the P2VP chains 
are submerged in the subphase and the collapsed PAA chains at the interface. In the 
pH region between 4.2 and 7, near the IEP, the star polymers form a “pancake-like” 
structure with widely spread arms at the interface. At pH 10, the anionic polyelec￾trolyte PAA moves into the water phase to minimize the repulsive force between the 
functional units of the PAA segments. AFM images confrm the suggested structural 
organization of (PS)9(P2VP-b-PAA)9 in layer-by-layer (LbL) flms assembled from 
single-charged species 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]+ Cl¯ and a 
rigid polyampholyte, SPES [56]. Since SPES contains two negatively charged sul￾fonic groups at pH >1 and one positively charged ammonium group at pH <10, an 
inner salt formation takes place. However, due to the excess of sulfonate groups, the 
resulting negatively charged polymer adsorbs to a positively charged substrate. By 
incorporating such a layer system into ionic liquids containing [BMIM]+ ions, the 
inner salt is reordered due to the predominant interaction between the sulfonate anion 
and the [BMIM]+ cation. Consequently, the surface of the assembly becomes posi￾tively charged, and the next layer of SPES and [BMIM]+ can be formed.  
 
90 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
The remarkable behavior of polyampholytes to change the net charge from pos￾itive to negative through the IEP is a powerful tool to assemble the LbL with both 
cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes. Such approach was realized by authors [57] 
to obtain pH-sensitive LbL flms with an amphoteric copolymer, that is, poly(dial￾lylamine-co-maleic acid) (PDAMA). LbL flms between the anionic poly(styrene 
sulfonate) (PSS) and PDAMA were formed at pH 3.0, while LbL flms containing 
PDAMA and cationic poly(N-ethyl-4-vinylpyridine) (PEVP) were observed at pH 
8.0. Noteworthy, that PSS–PDAMA and PDAMA–PEVP flms decompose at lower 
pH values (< pH 7). AFM experiments of dry (PSS–PDAMA)10 flms show that the 
root mean square (RMS) roughness was equal to 118 nm. After 15 min exposure 
of the flms at pH 8.0, the RMS roughness was shifted to 11 nm, indicating that a 
decomposition of the LbL flm upon exposure to pH 8.0. In contrast to LbL flms 
composed of polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte mixtures, the LbL flms and microcap￾sules constructed from the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are stable over a wide 
pH region and decompose only under very high pH conditions or while in the pres￾ence of high amounts of salt. 
Using this methodology, the same authors [58] were able to use PDAMA as a com￾ponent to construct freestanding LbL flms in combination with the polyanion PSS 
or the polycation poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDDA). The resulting 
flms were coated onto a quartz slide at a given pH value of 4.0 and 8.0. Furthermore, 
the layer acted as sacrifcial layer for LbL flms of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) 
(PAH) and PSS. After pH-dependent dissolution of the PDAMA-PDDA or PDA￾MA-PSS sacrifcial layer, the resulting freestanding PAH-PSS flms are colloidal, 
stable in water for a few months. If the flms are thick enough (above a critical value), 
they can be air-dried and will be stable in air. 
Based on polyampholyte microgels as building blocks, a facile LbL assembly to 
form matrix flms was developed due to the coloading and simultaneous release of 
oppositely charged molecules [59]. Hereby, amine and carbamate groups contain￾ing polyampholyte microgels (PAH-D-CO(2)) were assembled with PSS to create 
PAH-D-CO(2)/PSS multilayer flms. These flms were able to uptake both anionic 
methyl orange and cationic rhodamine 6G. Methyl orange and rhodamine 6G can be 
incorporated into the flms via electrostatic interactions and released after increasing 
the salt concentration, demonstrating the principal use of these systems in controlled 
drug release. LbL self-assembly of poly(carboxybetaine)s was reported by authors 
in [54]. Deposition of poly(carboxybetaine) within the flm was carried out at two 
pH regimes: 
1. At somewhat-acidic pH conditions, where the polybetain becomes a polyca￾tion. In this case, polyanions, for example, heparin, DNA, poly(carboxylic 
acid)s, or poly(styrenesulfonate), can be adsorbed. 
2. At neutral and basic pH values nearby the isoelectric point. In this case, no 
more multilayers exist. 
The produced films can be removed from the solid surface by increasing the pH 
values, so that means increasing the fraction of charged carboxylic groups in 
polybetaine. Stimuli-Responsive Properties of HMPA in Solution 91 
2.6 SOLUBILIZATION OF SWCNT AND MWCNT BY HMPA 
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNTs) are of special interest due to their mechanical, electrical, and ther￾mal properties, especially in the area of bio-applications. The dispersion of CNTs 
in aqueous media is of high interest to researchers. The strategy to solubilize the 
CNTs through non-covalent or covalent bonding with the help of anionic and cati￾onic polyelectrolytes was described in [60–65]. The pH-dependent self-assembly of 
(polystyrene)22(poly(2-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(acrylic acid))22 (PS22(P2VP-b-PAA)22) 
star terpolymer in aqueous solution was used to stabilize MWCNT [66]. A possible 
explanation for the interaction between the star terpolymers and the MWCNTs is the 
following. At pH 2, the terpolymer is physically adsorbed onto the MWCNTs due to 
π–π stacking and/or the hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions between the PS arms 
and the carbon nanotubes. At pH 8.5, spherical micelles of the star terpolymer are 
formed and adsorbed onto the MWCNT surface through hydrophobic interactions, 
either with the PS arms and/or P2VP segments. The pH reversibility of the MWCNT– 
star nanohybrids, in particular, the dispersion of MWCNTs in aqueous solution, can 
be “switched on” or “switched off” by varying the pH. The SWCNTs were dis￾persed in water by poly(2-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid), 
and the SWNT–polyampholyte dispersions were evaluated for NIH-3T3 cells [67]. 
By treating NIH-3T3 cells with polyampholyte-wrapped SWNTs (200 mg·mL-1), 
no signifcant cytotoxicity was observed after three days. However, the cellular 
uptake of the polyampholyte-wrapped short-length SWCNTs occurred via endocy￾tosis with localization in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. 
Mechanically strong, thermostable, viscoelastic, and biocompatible nanocom￾posites were fabricated based on pH-sensitive amphoteric vinylimidazole–acrylic 
acid (PVI-co-AA) nanogels and functionalized SWCNTs (f-SWCNTs) [68]. Sta￾bilization of f-SWCNTs by polyampholyte nanogels (PANGs) is probably due to 
π–π stacking interactions of nitrogen-containing aromatic rings with CNT surfaces 
[69]. The amphoteric nanogels containing f-SWCNTs were used as a drug delivery 
system for controlled loading and releasing of the water-soluble drug promethazine 
hydrochloride. 
Mesoporous polyampholytes of acrylic acid and different vinylimidazolium-based 
ionic liquid monomers, that is, P(XVIm Bry-co-AA) (where X = ethyl-, cyanomethyl-, 
n-butyl-, and benzyl substituents; y is the molar ratio of [imidazolium]/[COOH] in 
the copolymer chains), have shown high potential in CO2 adsorption processes [70]. 
The proposed mechanism of CO2 adsorption is the following: First, the imidazolium 
ring is deprotonated to form a transient N-heterocyclic carbene (NHCs) with the aid 
of acetate counterions, then it reacts with CO2 to form a carboxylate–imidazolium 
zwitterion. Trapped CO2 is further activated to form imidazolium–carboxylate zwit￾terions even at low temperature and pressure. The investigated system opens a new 
way to generate heterogeneous N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are of spe￾cial interest in catalysis, for example, for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to hydro￾carbons [71]. 
Self-assembly of fullerene C60 containing polyampholytes, that is, P(MAA-b￾DMAEMA)-b-C60 [72] or polysulfobetaine (Bet-PDMAEM-b-C60), was studied in  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
92 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
dependence on pH, temperature, and salt addition [73]. In the presence of a more 
hydrophobic betainized PDMAEMA, a higher UCST at about 32°C was observed. 
The UCST of Bet-PDMAEMA-b-C60 increases with salt concentration and reached a 
maximum at 0.35 wt% NaCl, decreasing at higher salt concentrations. Such behavior 
of Bet-PDMAEMA-b-C60 is explained by condensation of positively charged small 
ions on the negatively charged surface (−SO3
−Na+) at lower electrolyte concentration. 
At lower salt concentrations (below the maximum), the betainized polymer exhib￾its “polyelectrolyte”-like properties, and after a critical salt concentration (above 
the maximum), an “antipolyelectrolyte” character, where the UCST decreases with 
increasing NaCl concentration.

3 Stimuli-Responsive 
Amphoteric 
Nano-, Micro-, and 
Macroporous Gels 
3.1 THERMO-, PH-, AND SOLVENT-RESPONSIVE GELS 
The state-of the-art of amphoteric nano-, micro- and macrogels was reviewed in [1, 
2]. The physicochemical properties and volume–phase transitions of polyampholyte 
hydrogels [3–10] in response to temperature [11,12], pH [13–18], ionic strength [19– 
21], solvent composition [3, 22], DC electric feld [23], complexation [24, 25], and 
crosslinker chain length [26] have opened the door to a wide variety of technological 
applications of smart gels as structural biomaterials [27], controlled delivery systems 
[28, 29], energy storage [30], and atmospheric water harvesting [31] devices, super￾capacitors [32], actuators [33], sensors [34], etc. The stimuli-responsive properties 
of polyampholyte gels with respect to temperature, pH, ionic strength, and a mixture 
of water–organic solutions are similar to the behavior of linear amphoteric macro￾molecules discussed in Chapter 1. The thermoresponsive properties of crosslinked 
polyampholytes are mostly specifc for N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM)–based 
amphoteric gels because the NIPAM itself shows a thermosensitive character in 
water by changing the temperature [18, 35]. The transition temperatures of the 
N-isopropylacrylamide/N-3-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide/sodium 2-acrylamide￾2-methylpropyl sulfonate amphoteric gels against the concentration of anionic mon￾omer show that when the content of anionic and cationic groups is equal in NIPAM￾based gel, its swelling behavior is similar to NIPAM gel itself. When the ratio of 
cationic and anionic groups deviates from equimolar, the transition temperature and 
swelling ratio increases. These results are explained by affecting the ionic contacts 
formed between the cationic and anionic units on the swelling pressure of the gel. 
Thermoresponsivity (or volume–phase transition temperature) of polyzwitter￾ionic gels was established for poly[(N,N-dimethyl(methacroylethyl)ammonium 
propane sulfonate] (PDMMAPS), poly[(N,N-dimethyl(acrylamido)ammonium 
propane sulfonate] (PDMAAPS) [11], copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide with 
1-vinyl-3-(3-sulfopropyl)imidazolium betaine (NIPAM-co-VSIB) [12], copol￾ymers of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) or N-vinylcaprolactam (VCL) with 
[3-(methacryloylamino)propyl]dimethyl(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide [36]. 
The effect of zwitterionic co-monomer content on the swelling behavior, particle 
size, size distribution, and volume–phase transition temperature (VPTT) of the 
NIPAm-co-sulfobetaine VCL-co-sulfobetaine microgels was studied using dynamic 98 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies
and static light-scattering and small-angle X-ray/neutron scattering methods. In the 
author’s opinion, the dynamic equilibrium between short intragroup and long intra/
or intermacromolecular ionic contacts (or zwitterionic clusters) is responsible for 
the discontinuous or continuous thermal transition. The increasing hydrophilicity of 
the microgel network due to the incorporation of sulfobetaine results in a shift of the 
VPTT to higher temperatures.
The thermo- and salt-responsive behavior of polyampholyte nanogels derived 
from N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic 
acid sodium salt (AMPS), and (3-acrylamidopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride 
(APTAC) was studied in aqueous and aqueous salt solutions to evaluate the conforma￾tional and phase transitions upon changing of temperature and salt content [37, 38]. 
The temperature-dependent changing of zeta potentials of the nanogels in 0.001 M 
NaCl solution was measured at the temperature range of 25–60°C (Figure 3.1).
The zeta potential value of nanogel NIPAM90-APTAC7.5-AMPS2.5 with the excess 
of positively charged monomer APTAC increases up to +25  mV as the tempera￾ture rises from 25°C to 60°C. The negatively charged nanogel NIPAM90-APTAC2.5-
AMPS7.5, in the same temperature range, displays monotonic change of zeta potential 
value from −5 mV up to −30 mV. It can be assumed that at 25°C, the nanogels are 
predominantly in the swollen coiled state. With an increase in temperature, hydro￾phobic interactions between isopropyl radicals are enhanced, causing compactization 
FIGURE 3.1 Temperature-dependent zeta potential of amphoteric nanogels (1) NIPAM90-
APTAC7.5-AMPS2.5, (2) NIPAM90-APTAC5-AMPS5, and (3) NIPAM90-APTAC2.5-AMPS7.5
in 0.001  M NaCl solution. Samples NIPAM90-APTAC5-AMPS5, NIPAM90-APTAC7.5-
AMPS2.5, and NIPAM90-APTAC2.5-AMPS7.5 correspond to various compositions of nanogels

of coils and releasing of more and more charged groups to the outer layer of com￾pressed coils. This leads to the accumulation of positive or negative charges outside 
charge-imbalanced nanogels and an increase in the zeta potential of macromolecules. 
For charge-balanced nanogels NIPAM90-APTAC5-AMPS5, this effect also takes 
place, but due to mutual compensation of positively and negatively charged APTAC 
and AMPS groups, the value of zeta potential changes insignifcantly. 
Figure 3.2 shows the effect of temperature and the ionic strength on the phase 
transition temperatures (Tp.t.t.) of charge-balanced and charge-imbalanced nanogels 
NIPAM-APTAC-AMPS. 
The phase-transition temperature of charge-imbalanced nanogels NIPAM90-
APTAC7.5-AMPS2.5 and NIPAM90-APTAC2.5-AMPS7.5 exhibited less sensitivity to 
temperature at the interval of µ = 0.001–0.1 M NaCl, but sharp decrease of the Tp.t.t. at 
higher concentrations of added salt was observed. Nanogel particles shrink at higher 
salt concentration of µ = 0.5–1.0 M NaCl due to the screened electrostatic repulsion 
between uniformly charged macroions (polyelectrolyte effect), leading to a sharp 
decrease of the phase transition temperature. The phase transition temperature of the 
charge-balanced nanogel NIPAM90-APTAC5-AMPS5 passes through the maximum 
upon the addition of salt. This can be explained by the antipolyelectrolyte effect 
that is realized in the salt solution. In case of charge-balanced terpolymer NIPAM90-
APTAC5-AMPS5, the oppositely charged monomers are mutually compensated in 
pure water. At lower and moderate ionic strength of the solution (µ = 0.001–0.1 M 
NaCl), the electrostatic attraction between positively and negatively charged

monomers is gradually decreased, which leads to the unfolding of the polymer chain 
and the additional hydrophilization and increasing of the phase transition tempera￾ture. At high ionic strength of the solution (μ = 0,5 and 1 M NaCl), the macromo￾lecular system becomes similar to neutral polymer because the salt ions completely 
screen the positive and negative charges of macromolecules. In such conditions, the 
solubility and phase behavior of NIPAM90-APTAC5-AMPS5 are probably determined 
by NIPAM fragments. Moreover, at high salt concentration of µ = 0.5–1.0 M NaCl, 
the “salting-out” effect is probably realized, which leads to the overall hydrophobi￾zation of macromolecular chains and, consequently, to the decreasing of the phase 
transition temperature.
Polyampholyte gels MAPTAC-co-acrylic acid (MAPTAC-co-AA) and MAPTAC￾co-sodium acrylate (MAPTAC-co-SA) exhibit temperature- [5], pH- [6,7], and 
solvent-responsive [39, 40] properties (Figure 3.3). The multiphasic pH-dependent 
behavior of MAPTAC-co-AA [7] and 4VP-AA [4] in a wide range of pH, including 
the pHIEP along the plateau regime, is explained by the fact that pH inside the hydro￾gel remains at the pHIEP, although the external pH in bath changes over a wide range. 
This swelling–collapsing behavior of polyampholyte gels due to the pH difference 
between the inside and outside of the amphoteric network is adequately described by 
the Flory–Rehner swelling theory, coupled to the Donnan equilibrium. The pH- and 
salt-dependent swelling behavior of charge-balanced polyampholyte gel subjected 
to an aqueous solution of a monovalent salt with arbitrary pH is in good agreement 
with a model developed by the authors in [41]. Numerical analysis demonstrates 
FIGURE 3.3 Volume phase transition of amphoteric gel MAPTAC-co-SA in relation to 
temperature (curve 1) and acetone content (curve 2).

that the model reproduces all characteristic features of swelling diagrams quali￾tatively. The proposed model well describes the swelling curves quantitatively by 
comparison of the results of simulation with experimental data on three polyam￾pholyte gels: poly(2-(diethylamino)ethylmethacrylate-co-acrylic acid) copolymer 
gel (DEAEMA–co-AA) [42], poly(vinyl 2-aminoethyl ether-co-sodium acrylate) 
copolymer gel VAEE–co-SA [23], and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-1-vinylimi￾dazole-co-acrylic acid) copolymer gel NIPA–VI–AA [43]. 
Thermoshrinking of amphoteric gel MAPTAC-co-SA [5] is originated from a rel￾ative ratio of hydrophobic group to hydrophilic group, while discontinuous volume– 
phase transition of MAPTAC-co-SA in water–acetone mixture is characterized by 
the specifc binding between the opposite charges. In pure ethanol and acetone, the 
polybetaine gel is in a collapsed state due to the signifcant suppression of ionization 
and the poor thermodynamic quality of solvents with respect to ionizable groups of 
polyelectrolytes [39] (Figure 3.4). SEM pictures taken in water–acetone mixtures are 
also in good agreement with the swelling–shrinking behavior of such hydrogels (see 
inset of Figure 3.4) [44].

amine monomer ((ar-vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride) are very important 
and challenging to develop a surface which can switch between protein adsorption 
and desorption properties by changing its surface charge [45]. The pH-responsive 
wettability of the poly(VBA-co-VBTAC) brushes was reversible for a repeated cycle 
of alternating treatment by aqueous solution with pHs 2 and 12. The transition pH of 
the contact angle obtained from the derivative of the curve (dθ/dpH) versus pH for 
polyampholyte brushes was detected at the IEP 7.65.
New amphoteric terpolymers obtained by the terpolymerization of NIPAAm, 
acrylic acid (AA), and a new cationic monomer, vanillin modified by 2-((diisopro￾pylamino) methyl)-4-formyl-6-methoxyphenyl acrylate (DIVA), exhibited thermo-, 
pH-, and salt-responsive phase separation [46]. At lower (1.35) and higher (13.4) 
pH solution, the LCST (Tc) shows significant increase in the LCST and a higher 
cloud point (Cp). This is due to the dominance of the hydrophilic properties of the 
amphoteric terpolymers at the lower and higher pH solutions. At the IEP, pH 6.9, the 
terpolymers solutions exhibited a minimal difference between the Tc and Cp. The Tc
values appeared very close to the homo-PNIPAAm and were equal to 33.8, 31.7, and 
30.6°C, while the Cp was equal to 34.2, 32.3, and 31°C, respectively. The contact 
angles were measured at various pH levels. A hydrophilic terpolymer exhibiting the 
lowest contact angle was observed under the strongest acidic solutions (pH 1.38), 
whereas a more hydrophobic terpolymer exhibiting the highest contact angle was 
observed at the IEP (pH 6.9). The LCST (Tc) and the corresponding cloud points 
(Cp) of the ampholytic terpolymers were tested in three salt solutions: sodium sul￾fate, sodium chloride, and sodium thiocyanate; they have been chosen to achieve 
both of kosmotropic and chaotropic anions. The highest LCST was observed for the 
highest DIVA concentration (0.3 wt.%) in sodium thiocyanate solution (chaotropic 
anion). The lowest LCST was observed for the highest DIVA in the highest sodium 
sulfate solution (kosmotropic anion). The findings of this study can be utilized in the 
bio-separation of biological molecules, as well as drug delivery applications.
Authors [17] have developed pH-sensitive polyampholyte microgels of poly(acrylic 
acid-co-vinylamine) (P(AA-co-VAm)) that are able to sol-gel phase transition as a func￾tion of pH and polymer concentration. The swelling ratio of P(AA-co-VAm) reaches 
a minimum at the IEP (pH = 3.5), where the zeta potential is also zero (Figure 3.5).

The P(AA-co-VAm) microgels show sol-gel transition in dependence of pH and 
polymer concentration. A higher polymer concentration can form hydrogel at a rela￾tively wide pH region even at pH as high as 13. With a higher polymer concentration, 
there are much more charged microgel particles in the dispersion, and the charged par￾ticles electrostatically interact with each other to form an unfowable gel, which results 
in the decrease of the lower boundary of the fuid–gel transition for a higher microgel 
concentration. On the other hand, with a higher polymer concentration, almost all the 
aqueous solution could be adsorbed by the microgels at the high-pH region. The tre￾mendously swollen microgels interacted with each other via electrostatic interaction 
and/or adhesion and mutual friction interaction, which resulted in the dispersion able 
to keep a gel state at extremely high pH of 13 and an increase of the upper boundary 
of the fuid–gel transition for a higher microgel concentration. A four-parameter phase 
diagram including microgel concentration, pH, ionic strength, and temperature could 
be useful for selecting an injection solution in an oil well to block water-washed frac￾tures using the sol-gel transition of a polyampholyte microgel. 
The use of an aqueous thermally driven self-assembly approach based on 
hydrazide- and aldehyde-functionalized PNIPAM oligomers functionalized with 
pH-ionizable cationic or anionic comonomers for fabricating degradable tempera￾ture/pH dual-responsive microgels was demonstrated by authors [47]. Amphoteric 
microgels were produced by mixing cationic- and anionic-functionalized precursor 
polymers during the self-assembly process that reproduce the high-pH/low-pH par￾abolic swelling response observed in conventional amphoteric microgels. Electro￾phoretic mobility measurements as a function of pH demonstrate that changing the 
ratio of cationic- and anionic-functionalized precursor polymers (+):(−) can lead to 
microgels with different cationic–anionic charge ratios and thus IEP. The IEPs equal 
to 4.6, 6.3, and 8.1 were observed for (+):(−) charge ratios 1:4, 2:3, and 3:2, respec￾tively, yielding a nearly linear correlation between the cation/anion ratio and the 
isoelectric point (Figure 3.6).

Thus, instead of synthesizing a conventional microgel with defned amounts of 
anionic and cationic charges for each desired charge ratio, the self-assembly of 
varying ratios of cationic and anionic seed polymer can achieve well-controlled, 
pH-responsive amphoteric microgels of any charge density/ratio based on mixing a 
defned number of functionalized precursor polymers. 
Quenched polyampholyte hydrogels APTAC-co-AMPS of equimolar composition 
as well as with the excess of APTAC or AMPS monomers described in [48] appar￾ently was erroneously attributed to pH-responsive polyampholytes. Earlier, the same 
linear and crosslinked polyampholytes APTAC-co-AMPS were comprehensively 
studied by authors [49–51]. It should be mentioned that the quenched (or strongly 
charged) polyampholytes prepared from the charged cationic and anionic monomers, 
such as APTAC and AMPS, retaining their respective charges over a wide range of 
pH, are less-sensitive or even insensitive to pH change and a priori cannot belong 
to pH-sensitive polyampholytes, as defned in Subchapter 1.2. The reason is that the 
quenched polyampholytes do not contain ionizable acid or base groups in macromo￾lecular chain, as in the case of annealed polyampholytes. Addition of HCl or NaOH 
leads to only accumulation of added positively or negatively charged ions (H+, Na+, 
Cl− and OH−) in the vicinity of macroions and, in less extent, to ion exchange. In its 
turn, the added HCl and NaOH may play the role of ionic strength of the solution 
and screen the positive or negative charges and lead to folding (or expanding) of the 
macromolecular chains. Swelling–deswelling of p-sodium styrene sulfonate (SSS) 
and vinyl benzyl trimethylammoniumchloride (VBT) SSS-co-VBT polyampholyte 
gels of different compositions was investigated in water–ethanol mixtures [22]. The 
swelling ratio of equimolar polyampholyte gels increases as the content of ethanol 
is increased up to 50 vol.% in the water–ethanol mixture. The gels start deswelling 
as the ethanol content is increased beyond 50 vol.%, and fnally, the gel collapses 
at ethanol concentration ≈75 vol.%. Similarly, initial swelling, followed later on by 
deswelling at higher concentrations of ethanol, was observed for other gels contain￾ing excess of SSS or VBT. It supposed that for the equimolar polyampholyte, gels of 
SSS and VBT in pure water are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of macromo￾lecular chains. The addition of ethanol disrupts the hydrophobic forces of attraction 
between the polymer chains, causing the swelling of the gels. But beyond 50% con￾centration of ethanol, the polymer chains are surrounded more by ethanol than water, 
and the polymer–polymer affnity overtakes the polymer–solvent interaction, result￾ing in deswelling, and the gel collapses. The swelling–deswelling ratio decreases as 
the crosslink density of the gels increases. Also, the deswelling phenomenon became 
a gradual process for highly crosslinked gels, unlike an abrupt phenomenon for gels 
sheerly crosslinked through charge-neutralized bridges. The slower deswelling for 
comparatively more crosslinked gels may be because of the formation of a more rigid 
gel structure due to higher crosslink density, resulting in the restriction of polymer 
chain movements. 
The infuence of water–ethanol and water–acetone mixtures on the behavior of 
amphoteric hydrogels AAm-APTAC-AMPS is shown in Figure 3.7 [52]. 
The addition of up to 40 vol.% of ethanol or acetone leads to a signifcant swelling 
of hydrogel samples. This is probably due to the improvement of the thermody￾namic quality of water–organic solvent mixture with respect to both hydrophobic and Stimuli-Responsive Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels 105
FIGURE 3.7 Swelling–deswelling behavior of AAm-APTAC-AMPS hydrogels in water–
acetone mixtures. The swelling degree of hydrogels in water–organic solvent mixture SDwo

hydrophilic groups of polyampholytes, leading to better swelling of macromolecular 
chains. Further, increasing the content of organic solvents more than 50 or 60 vol.% 
leads to a gradual or sharp shrinking of hydrogel samples. This phenomenon can be 
explained by decreasing the dielectric permittivity of water–organic solvent mix￾ture with respect to ionic groups of macromolecules. In pure ethanol and acetone, 
the polyampholyte gel collapses due to significant suppression of ionization state 
and condensation of macroions and counterions due to poor thermodynamic quality, 
together with low dielectric permittivity of solvents.
3.2 SALT-RESPONSIVE GELS
Figure 3.9 shows the equilibrium swelling ratio Qe for MADQUAT-co-AMPS in pure 
water and as a function of NaCl concentration [20, 40, 41]. The long-range coulom￾bic interactions between opposite charges along the backbone are a governing factor 
of volume–phase changes of polyampholyte hydrogels [40, 41, 53].
Hydrogels of MADQUAT-co-AMPS are in swollen and collapsed states in depend￾ence of the net charges expressed as Δf = f+−f−, where f
+ and f
− are the molar ratios 
of cationic and anionic monomers to the total monomer concentration, respectively. 
In pure water, when the molar ratio of cationic to anionic groups approaches unity, 
the opposite charges act as physical crosslinks stabilized by inter- or intraionic con￾tacts, and the liberated free counterions are effectively “dialyzed” from the hydrogel 
interior. As the concentration of the anionic and cationic parts deviates from the 106 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
equimolar ones Δf ≠ 0, the swelling ratio Qe increases rapidly, because the number of 
osmotically active ions in the hydrogel phase increases according to Donnan equilib￾rium. Polyampholyte hydrogels with anionic and cationic offsets behave in a typical 
polyelectrolyte character. Hydrogels of MAPTAC-co-NaSS with excess of anionic 
or cationic monomers exhibit the decreasing of swelling capacity with the increasing 
of NaCl concentration (Figure 3.8). 
The excess of anionic or cationic moieties will require the fow of small ions inside 
the hydrogel to maintain the electroneutrality, and as a result, the concentrations of 
mobile ions inside and outside the gel become similar, the net osmotic pressure falls, 
and swelling decreases. The charge-balanced polyampholyte chain collapses in pure 
water or at low ionic strength because of the attractive interaction between oppositely 
charged monomers and adopts a Gaussian conformation at high ionic strength due to 
screening of the coulombic interactions. In 2 mol·L-1 NaCl solution, the electrostatic 
effects are screened, and the swelling ratio at equilibrium Qe levels off, and the gel 
behaves as a neutral system. In pure water or at low ionic strength, polyampholyte 
chains bearing net charges of opposite signs form intraionic complexes, leading to a 
microphase separation. The schematic representation of the microsegregated struc￾ture of amphoteric network at (a) low and (b) high ionic strength is shown in Fig￾ure 3.8 (insert). For charge-balanced polyampholyte hydrogels, MAPTAC-co-NaSS 
formation of spherical globules was directly visualized by feld emission scanning 
electron microscope (FE-SEM) images [54, 55]. The globules are spherical, consist

of polymer-rich domains, polymer-poor interglobular regions, and clusters. The 
globule is similar to a charge-balanced polyampholyte chain structure in dilute solu￾tion predicted theoretically by Rubinstein [56] and can be interpreted in terms of 
the existence of microsegregated structure similar to the one predicted by Khokhlov 
et al. [57] for weakly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvent.
Swelling and mechanical properties of quenched polyampholyte (QPA) hydrogels 
based on MAPTAC-co-NaSS [58] and AMPS-co-APTAC [59] were compared with 
polyion complex (PIC) composed of PMAPTAC and PNaSS [58] and hydrogel pre￾pared from zwitterionic monomer [2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopro￾pyl)ammonium (polySBA) [59] (Figure 3.9).
The main difference between MAPTAC-co-NaSS and PMAPTAC-PNaSS hydro￾gels is that the former is composed of oppositely charged monomers, while the latter 
is the product of matrix polymerization of NaSS on the matrix of PMAPTAC. The 
conformation of MAPTAC-co-NaSS and polySBA hydrogels can be stabilized by 
both inter- and intraionic interactions, while PMAPTAC-PNaSS chains are stabi￾lized by interionic salt bonds. Both QPA and PIC gels do not contain the crosslink￾ing agents and belong to physical networks which are formed at charge-balanced 
composition of monomers f+ = f− = 0.5 or at stoichiometric composition (1:1) of 
FIGURE 3.9 The structure of repeat units of MAPTAC-co-NaSS involved into (a) intra￾and interionic complexes, (b) PMAPTAC-PNaSS complex, and (c) PAEDAPS hydrogel.

oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. It was demonstrated that the PIC hydrogels 
are much tougher than the QPA hydrogels and exhibit better mechanical proper￾ties. This is due to the structural and morphological differences of two systems. The 
PIC hydrogel shows a more inhomogeneous, large segregated structure with large 
pore size (d = 0.5–3.0 µm), while the QPA hydrogels show a more homogeneous 
structure with diameter of pores 0.1–0.3 µm. The swelling properties of AMPS￾co-APTAC and polySBA as a function of ionic strength were evaluated by con￾tinuous monitoring of 60 µm sized hydrogels with the help of a fber-optic-based 
instrument described previously [60] and presented directly as Δlopt or as relative 
changes Δlopt/lopt. It was shown that both charge-balanced AMPS-co-APTAC and 
zwitterionic polySBA hydrogels exponentially swell upon ionic strength increases 
from 5·10–4 to 0.15  M NaCl. Thus, both charge-balanced QPA and zwitterionic 
polybetaines exhibit antipolyelectrolyte effect [61] in response to added salts. The 
reasonable explanation of this phenomenon is the following. The opposite charges 
within QPA and zwitterionic hydrogels act as physical crosslinks stabilized by inter￾or intraionic contacts. Exponential swelling of AMPS-co-APTAC and polySBA with 
increase in ionic strength is due to screening of the electrostatic attractions between 
opposite charges that diminishes both charge and crosslink density to contribute to 
swelling. The higher swelling degree of QPA hydrogel compared to zwitterionic 
hydrogel is the result of a larger number of crosslinks in QPA hydrogels. 
A new class of tough, viscoelastic, and self-healing hydrogels was designed by 
authors [62–64] from supramolecular QPA prepared by random copolymerization of 
oppositely charged ionic monomers at high monomer concentration and equimolar 
monomer ratio. These physical polyampholyte gels contain the strong ionic bonds 
that play the role of permanent crosslink and weak ionic bonds that are responsible 
for elongation, deformation, twisting, fatigue resistance, internal friction, adhesion, 
self-healing, shape memory, anti-biofouling, and other important functions. In spite 
of the topological difference, the QPA hydrogels are similar to double-network hydro￾gels [65]. In both cases, the strong bonds form a primary network, and the weak 
bonds, a sacrifcial network. The effect of the charge fraction (f) on the swelling vol￾ume ratio Qv, Young’s modulus E, and the compressive fracture stress σb of the hydro￾gels MAPTAC-co-NaSS was evaluated. The extremums of curves correspond to the 
vicinity of charge balance point (f ≈ 0.48~0.53), where the coulomb attraction prevails 
over the repulsion and polymer chain collapse to globular state. In the imbalanced 
region (f <0.48 and f >0.53), the coulomb repulsion prevails and polymer segments 
elongate. The shrinking of the gels near the charge balance point (f ≈ 0.505 ± 0.025) 
is accompanied by the dramatic increase in the modulus E and fracture stress σb. It 
should be noted that dialysis of as-prepared hydrogel samples in pure water plays a 
crucial role in enhancing the ionic bond formation, whereupon the polymer concen￾tration governs the competition between intrachain and interchain complexation to 
form a tough hydrogel [27]. According to the opinion of authors in [30], the “zipping” 
of the polyampholyte chains in deionized water is responsible for the formation of 
tough polyampholyte hydrogel. In our mind, the “zipping” mechanism is also specifc 
for the PIC hydrogels composed of PMAPTAC and PNaSS [58] that are much tougher 
than the MAPTAC-co-NaSS and exhibit excellent mechanical properties. - -
Stimuli-Responsive Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels 109 
A series of experiments was carried out to clarify the effect of specifc ions on 
mechanical and electrical properties of QPA hydrogels on the examples of NaSS-co￾MAPTAC and various salts [30]. The swelling capacity of NaSS-co-MAPTAC can 
be interpreted in terms of Hoffmeister series for cations Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Na+ > 
NH4
+ > Li+ having common anion (Cl−) and anions ClO4 > NO3 > Cl- > HPO4–2 > 
SO4
2- having common cation (Na+). 
3.3 ELECTRIC-RESPONSIVE GELS 
The DC responsivity of polyampholyte gel specimens was considered in Refs. [23, 
66, 67]. It has been found that the polyampholyte gel shrinks, swells, or oscillates at 
the pHIEP. These results were interpreted in terms of redistribution of fxed and mobile 
ions, the Donnan equilibrium, and water hydrolysis attracting the oscillation mecha￾nism of an ultrathin polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) membrane [68]. The appearance 
of pH gradient inside polyampholyte gel samples induced by DC electric feld was 
tested for anionic, cationic, and amphoteric gels [69, 70]. The pH profles of anionic 
polyelectrolyte, poly(sodium acrylate), and cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(vinyl ether 
of ethanolamine), have no any considerable pH deviation in an applied external DC 
electric feld, whereas for equimolar amphoteric gel composed of sodium acrylate 
and vinyl ether of ethanolamine (SA-co-VEMEA) the applied DC electric feld leads 
to the appearance of linear, stable pH gradient. When the electricity switches off, 
the pH gradient disappears, and the pH of amphoteric gel returns rapidly to the ini￾tial state. At the central part of gel specimen, the value of pH is close to neutral, 
while near the cathode and anode sides, they are more acidic and basic, respectively. 
Based on this principle, a novel approach for the separation of protein mixture within 
monolithic polyampholyte gel under the imposed externally DC electric feld was 
suggested [69]. The advantage of this method is that the gel matrix and amphoteric 
buffer are combined in one and the same sample. In a new approach, it is expected 
that the protein molecules to be separated are concentrated in appropriate pH zones 
of amphoteric gel according to their isoionic points (pHIIP) [70]. This approach is 
similar to the method of immobilized pH gradients, in which the pH gradient is 
achieved by copolymerization of acrylamide with a series of acrylamide derivatives 
containing either carboxyl or amine groups [71]. 
3.4 BIORESPONSIVE GELS 
Polyampholyte hydrogels consisting of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), acrylic 
acid (AA), and N-vinylimidazole (VI) monomeric units with co-immobilized glucose 
oxidase and urease were designed by Kokufuta et al. [72] to develop a biochemo￾mechanical system, for example, to convert biochemical energy to mechanical work 
(swelling–shrinking) as a biocatalyst (regulation of reaction kinetics) in a chemi￾cal conversion. The most interesting system are polyampholyte gels that contain 
co-immobilized enzymes. A swollen gel shrinks or swells upon increasing or decreas￾ing pH passing through the isoelectric point (pHIEP). Amphoteric, PNIPAM-based 
microgels functionalized with aminophenylboronic acid (PBA) exhibit glucose￾dependent swelling responses at physiological temperature, pH, and ionic strength [73]. 110 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
Swelling–deswelling of amphoteric microgels can respond to glucose and PBA con￾centrations and the relative concentrations of the cationic and anionic functional 
groups in the platform microgel. The unique charge-switching properties of ampho￾teric PBA-functionalized microgels in the physiological environment may facilitate 
the development of an alternative approach to glucose-responsive insulin release. 
A net cationic charge of microgels in the absence of glucose at physiological pH can 
bind insulin via electrostatic attraction. As the glucose concentration increases, the 
PBA equilibrium shifts to generate more anionic charges within the gel network and 
switch the net charge of the microgel to anionic, driving insulin release via electro￾static repulsion. As the glucose concentration is gradually lowered by physiological 
insulin action, less glucose will bind to the microgel, and the anionic charge density 
on the microgel will be reduced, potentially reducing the rate of insulin release in 
a feedback control loop. Thus, the amphoteric PBA microgels have a high capacity 
for insulin uptake and can selectively release more insulin at higher glucose concen￾trations under physiological conditions via glucose-induced, “on–off” switching of 
electrostatic attractions between insulin and the microgel. PBA-modifed hydroxy￾propyl chitosan derivative (PBA-HPCS) possessing amphoteric properties has also 
been found with high loading and effcient delivery properties as nanocapsules to 
construct glucose-responsive hydrogels [74]. These hydrogels exhibited rapid gela￾tion, rapid self-healing, injectability, and responsiveness to glucose and pH. These 
fndings suggest that PBA-HPCS has potential for application in the felds of anti￾bacterial, drug carriers, and tissue engineering and holds promise for advancing the 
development of PBA-based biomaterials. The impact of pH coupled with oxygen 
stimuli on osmotic pressure and electrical potential responses of hemoglobin-loaded 
polyampholyte hydogel was studied by authors [75] for developing a biocompatible 
pH- and oxygen-reactive gas carrier, bio-sensing, and actuating materials. 
3.5 SELF-HEALING AND SHAPE MEMORY GELS 
Figure 3.10 illustrates schematically the self-healing mechanism of QPA hydrogels 
synthesized from anionic (NaSS) and cationic (MAPTAC) as well as quaternized 
N,N-dimethylaminoethylacrylate (DMAEA-Q) monomers [63]. 
A virgin sample is represented as an inhomogeneous medium composed of strong 
ionic bonds that play the role of permanent crosslink like covalent crosslinker and 
weak ionic bonds that can be ruptured and reformed. The cut virgin sample contains 
the ruptured strong and weak ionic bonds. After contacting of the cut surfaces, a large 
number of ionic contacts in the vicinity of surfaces are reformed across the interface, 
which leads to healing. 
The introduction of hydrophilic or hydrophobic groups into the macromolecu￾lar chain of polyampholyte hydrogels drastically changes their physicochemical 
and mechanical properties [4, 76–78]. “Dilution” of continuous charges of poly￾ampholyte sequences by hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) monomers may control the 
intra- and interionic interactions, leading to either more relaxation of chains or the 
production of intermolecular linkages between the polymer chains acting as physi￾cal crosslink. Hydrophobically modifed physical gels were prepared from annealed 
(equimolar copolymer of acrylic acid and 4-vinylpyridine (AA-co-4VP)) [4] and Stimuli-Responsive Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels 111 
FIGURE 3.10 Self-healing mechanism of QPA hydrogels.

charge-balanced quenched (AMPS-co-APTAC) polyampholytes [77]. As hydropho￾bic monomer, copolymer of AA-co-4VP contained stearyl methacrylate (SMA), and 
copolymer of AMPS-co-APTAC contained octadecylacrylate (ODA). Both hydrogels 
exhibited a high tensile strength and stretchability. Cut-and-heal testes conducted at 
50°C revealed a complete healing effciency with respect to Young’s modulus for 
quenched polyampholyte gels within 4 h (Figure 3.11). 
Shape memory polymers are a typical kind of stimuli-responsive material that 
can memorize a temporary shape after the deformation and recover to the per￾manent shape upon the external stimuli, including heat, electricity, light, mag￾netic feld, and solvent. Shape memory behavior of QPA hydrogels obtained from 
MAPTAC-co-NaSS [27] and MAPTAC-co-NaSS-co-MAA [33] was compared. The 
main difference between two amphoteric hydrogels is that MAPTAC-co-NaSS-co-MAA 
contains additional methacrylic acid (MAA) that is sensitive to pH. In the frst case, an 
as-prepared hydrogel MAPTAC-co-NaSS was deformed from initial straight shape to 
a helix shape and immersed in water, memorizing the spiral shape. After deformation 
of spiral shape to straight shape, the gel sample automatically returns to spiral shape. 
The memorized spiral shape is erased and gel recovers to its initial straight shape 
in 0.5 M NaCl solution. This process can be repeated many times. In the author’s 
opinion, using the ion complexation process in water, it is possible to “write” any 
desired shape with the help of polyampholyte hydrogels and to “erase” the shape 
by destruction of polyionic complexes in NaCl. In case of MAPTAC-co-NaSS-co￾MAA [33], the helical shape of gel was manually formed in 0.1 M NaOH and fxed 
in 0.1 M HCl. Immersing the gel sample again in 0.1 M NaOH solution recovered its 
original straight shape. The “straight-helix” transformation was repeated for at least 
ten times by alternate immersing in NaOH and HCl solutions. Taking into account 
that MAPTAC-co-NaSS itself exhibits shape memory ability, one can suppose that

the presence of pH-sensitive MAA units in MAPTAC-co-NaSS-co-MAA synergisti￾cally enhance the shape memorizing process. 
A polyampholyte-based hydrogel actuator with a gradient pore structure derived 
from the sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and methyl chloride quaternized N,N-di￾methylamino ethylacrylate (DMAEA-Q) was able to change the shape when exposed 
to water and recover to the original shape in salt solution [79]. The two sides of 
the polyampholyte hydrogels demonstrate the hydrophilicity on the glass plate (GP) 
and hydrophobicity on the Tefon plate (TP). A gradient distribution of composition 
in copolymer gels can be achieved, leading to gathering more on the GP side and 
less on the TP side. The structure and morphology of the GP side of the hydrogels 
prepared by the glass plate and the Tefon plate are distinctly different. The porous 
structure becomes much more compact and denser from the TP side to the GP side, 
indicating that a gradient pore construction is formed. Thus, the amphoteric hydrogel 
can convert salt stimuli into shape deformation, and the deformation angle reaches 
about 180°. Salt-responsive amphoteric hydrogels with shape deformation properties 
play an important role in many felds, such as artifcial muscles, soft robots, and 
tissue engineering. 
Sulfobetaine (SB)–grafted poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) exhibited a great ther￾mal stability, mechanical performances, and heat-triggered shape memory behaviors, 
including high shape recovery ratio (over 98.7%) and fxity ratio (over 98%) [80]. 
The fabricated PAEK-SB after immersing in water for 36 h showed triple shape Stimuli-Responsive Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels 113 
memory behaviors. The immersed flm of Shape I was fxed to Shape II and Shape III 
at the temperatures of 140 and 110°C, respectively. Then, the exceptional triple shape 
recovery behaviors could be triggered via heating the sample to 110 and 140°C, 
and the sample of Shape III recovered to Shape II and Shape I, respectively. These 
water-actuated, reshaping-reconfgured, and triple shape memory PAEK-SB could 
be an ideal substitute material for smart sensors and deformed actuators. 
3.6 AMPHOTERIC NANO-, MICRO-, AND MACROPOROUS GELS 
According to the IUPAC terminology, nanogels are defned as polymeric, chemically 
crosslinked structures which range in size between 1 and 100 nm, while microgels 
are gel particles with size of approximately 0.1–100 μm [81]. Tremendous effort 
has been devoted to developing of hydrogel colloidal particles (i.e., nanogels/micro￾gels), including their synthesis, characterization, assembly, computer simulation, and 
various applications [82]. Polyampholyte nano- and microgels are of great interest 
because they adequately respond to various external factors (stimuli), such as tem￾perature, pH, salt composition, solvent, electric or magnetic feld, light radiation, 
etc. [1]. They have great potential for the design of “smart” materials in medicine, 
biotechnology, nanotechnology, catalysis, oil industry, environmental protection, 
etc. [8, 72, 83]. The synthesis and characterization of amphoteric nanogels based on 
N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), 2-acrylamido-2-propanesulfonate sodium salt 
(AMPS), and 3-acrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride (APTAC) [37], 
together with their thermo- and salt-responsive properties [38] and the drug delivery 
system [84], have been described. 
A series of low-charge-density, stimuli-responsive ampholytic terpolymers was 
synthesized by a microemulsion polymerization technique [85, 86]. Main attention 
was paid to hydrophilic–lyophilic balance (HLB) and cohesive energy ratio concepts 
with regard to optimization of microemulsion polymerization process. The soap-free 
emulsion polymerization method was used to combine acrylamide (AM), ampho￾teric monomer N-(3-Sulfopropyl)-N-(methacryloxyethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium 
betaine (SPE), and surface-active behenyl polyoxyethylene ether methacrylate 
(BEM) as the raw material to prepare a series of water-soluble polymers with zwitte￾rionic groups and hydrophobic groups [87]. The effect of the ratio of BEM and SPE 
in the synthesis of copolymers on the instability of the emulsion was further studied. 
pH-responsive polyampholyte “core–shell” microgels consisting of a crosslinked 
poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEA) or poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) 
network surrounded by a crosslinked PMAA or PDEA shell, respectively, were 
obtained by Vamvakaki et al. [15] by emulsion copolymerization of the appropriate 
functional monomers with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker. SEM 
and TEM images showed spherical and a narrow size distribution of the microgel 
particles. The solution properties of “core–shell” microgel are different from the 
randomly distributed microgel poly(DEA-co-MAA) of the same composition. It is 
interesting to note that the isoelectric point (IEP) of random polyampholyte micro￾gel is equal to 6.8, while the isoelectric pH (pHIEP) of “core–shell” polyampholyte 
microgels corresponds to ~8.0 when the PDEA is in “core” and the PMAA is in 
“shell,” and pHIEP ~7.5 when the PMAA is in “core” and the PDEA is in “shell.” This 114 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
is probably connected with different ionization state of acid–base groups of polyam￾pholytes as a function of pH. 
Amphoteric core–shell microgels were synthesized by copolymerization of 
N-vinylcaprolactam (VCL), itaconic acid (IA), and vinylimidazole (VIm) [88]. The 
variation of the pH induces two effects: (1) change of the microgel surface charge 
and (2) change of the microgel size [89]. Both effects are due to the pH-triggered 
ionization of the acidic and basic groups and, consequently, the swelling of the 
microgels, both in acidic and basic media, and exhibiting the smallest size close to 
the IEP. Authors theoretically describe amphoteric core–shell nanogels that possess 
the specifc properties and very challenging for theoretical models, as well as discuss 
the dynamic properties of core–shell nanogels with shell-restricted swelling, which 
indicate confnement effects. 
pH-responsive polyampholyte nano- and microgels were prepared from the mix￾ture of chitosan and ovalbumin [90], apple pectinic acid crosslinked by diamines 
via the Ugi reaction [91], and chitosan crosslinked by ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid dianhydride [92]. The abundant reactive carboxyl and amino groups present at 
the surface of the nanogels are subject to subsequent binding of targeting agents to 
provide additional functions, which may further unleash the application potential of 
such nanogel systems. 
Technological interest in microgels is due to their combination of the unique prop￾erties of three compounds: colloidal substances, surfactants, and polymers [15]. The 
following types of microgels—microspheres, thermo- and pH-sensitive microgels, 
preformed particles gel, colloidal-dispersed gels—are widely used in oil recovery, as 
oil additives and drilling fuids [93, 94]. 
Despite the progress made in the feld of synthesis and characterization of linear 
and crosslinked polyampholytes, the thermal- and salt-responsive microgels con￾taining ionic groups are insuffciently studied objects, especially in the context of 
enhanced oil recovery, depending on temperature and salt additive. Most attention 
was paid to nano- and microgels derived from acrylamide derivatives, for example, 
AAm80-APTAC10-AMPS10, the linear analogs of which exhibited the best swelling 
capacity and viscosifying effect in saline water [95–97]. From TEM images, it can be 
FIGURE 3.12 TEM images of nano- and microgels of AAm80-APTAC10-AMPS10.

observed that AAm80-APTAC10-AMPS10 samples have a spherical shape and contain 
both nanogels and microgels (Figure 3.12). 
It is seen that different-sized nano- and microgel particles are aggregated into big￾ger micron-sized species to minimize the surface energy of the particles. 
Amphoteric microgels consisting of acrylamide (AAm), methacrylic acid (MAA), 
and N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEM) exhibit U-type pH–volume 
transition, that is, volume contracted in the pH range 6.5–7.5 that corresponds to 
the IEP [98]. Controlled-release behavior of amphoteric microgels with respect to 
the dye Gentian VB was also investigated. It was observed that, at pH 3.5, there was 
only 10% of Gentian VB absorbed by the microspheres, whereas at pH 6.8, there 
was about 85% dye in the microgels. At pH 9.3, there was 6% of dye absorbed in 
the microspheres. In other words, when the pH changed from pH 6.8 to pH 3.5 or 
pH 9.3, there was about 75–80% dye released from the amphoteric microgels to the 
aqueous solution. 
The pH-dependent ionization and the swelling behavior of polyampholyte core– 
shell microgels under good solvent conditions were evaluated using Metropolis 
Monte Carlo simulations [99]. Due to the spatial separation of acid–base groups in 
core–shell systems, the ionization is less enhanced compared to a microgel with an 
alternating distribution of the two species. Furthermore, the IEP is shifted toward 
higher pH, which is caused by a higher charge density in the “core” compared to that 
in the “shell.” Added salt changes the Donnan equilibrium, which determines the 
counterion distribution within and outside of the microgel. At the same time, it con￾tributes to the electrostatic screening of the network charges, leading to a narrowing 
of the U-shaped volume transition curve. 
Macroporous monolith hydrogels with three different framework structures, 
namely, copoly-ampholyte monolith bearing randomly distributed cationic and ani￾onic charges, bilayered and mixed-amphoteric polyelectrolyte monolith consisting 
of poly[(3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride] (PAMPTMA), and 
poly[(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propansulfonic acid] (PAMPS) were prepared within 
the oil-in-water (O/W) high-internal-phase emulsion (HIPE) templating as a new 
format of porous structures that are distinguished by a highly three-dimensionally 
(3D) interconnected macroporous morphology [100] (Figures 3.13 and 3.14).

polyHIPEs. The dotted line highlights the interface between the two regions in bilayered￾amphoteric polyelectrolyte polyHIPE.

From the network viewpoint, only the copoly-HIPE structure is a true poly￾ampholyte (specifcally quenched polyampholyte), while the bilayered- and 
mixed-polyHIPE are preferably called “amphoteric polyelectrolyte monoliths,” 
other than polyampholytes, because they are composed of two separated, that is, 
PAMPS and PAMPTMA, polyHIPE porous networks. Average voids of bilay￾ered-amphoteric polyelectrolyte polyHIPE consisting of PAMPTMA and PAMPS 
are 16 ± 3 and 22 ± 4 μm, the morphologies of mixed- and copolynetworks show 
little variation from each other and show the polyHIPE morphology with an aver￾age voids size of 11 ± 4 and 14 ± 3 μm, respectively. The highly interconnected, 
micrometer-sized porous structures in all three cases are expected to facilitate the 
rapid absorption of aqueous solutions through the capillary action. The perfor￾mance of amphoteric polyelectrolyte polyHIPEs in the dye mixture adsorption was 
examined. Bilayered- and mixed-polyHIPEs have demonstrated ability to simulta￾neously adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes from the water solution of the dye 
mixture, which can provide a great stimulus for further investigations in the feld 
of adsorptive removal of aqueous pollutants. 
As distinct from polyampholyte hydrogels, macroporous amphoteric cryogels are 
formed in the moderately frozen solutions of monomeric and polymeric precursors 
below the freezing point of solvent [101–108]. According to cryopolymerization 
concept, the freezing of the initially homogeneous system results in the crystalliza￾tion of pure solvent (water) and accumulation of monomers and initiators in unfrozen 
micro-zones (so-called “cryo-concentration”) [101]. The polymerization reaction 
proceeds in this non-frozen part of the reaction mixture. Water crystals grow in the 
course of freezing, and interconnections with other crystals take place until a con￾tinuous system of pores is formed. Thawing of the system leads to the formation of 
a monolithic gel matrix with continuous macroporous channels flled with liquid 
solvent. The cryogel has a spongelike morphology and pore size of several tens and 
hundreds of microns. Time- and pH-dependent swelling of polyampholyte cryogels 
based on allylamine-co-acrylic acid-co-acrylamide (AA-co-AAc-co-AAm) shows 
the fast swelling due to the macroporous structure [109, 110]. Stimuli-Responsive Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels 117 
An increase of the acid–base content leads to progressive decrease of the degree 
of swelling, water fux, and pore size, as a result of the formation of strong ionic 
contacts between the oppositely charged acid–base groups of cryogels. The pHIEP 
of the AA-co-AAc-co-AAm series arranges between pH 3.5 and 4.3. The swelling 
behavior of DMAEM-co-AMPS cryogels in aqueous solutions of NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, 
K2SO4, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 was studied in [111]. 
The feasibility of the so-called isoelectric effect, which takes place at the IEP of 
linear polyampholytes, was tested for polyampholyte cryogels [112]. At the IEP of 
DMAEM-co-MAA, the cooperativity of intrachain interactions between the acidic 
and basic groups (formation of inner salt) within a cryogel matrix predominates 
those of interchain interactions (between cryogel and protein, surfactant, and dye 
molecules). As a result, at the IEP of amphoteric cryogel (pHIEP = 7.1), the lysozyme, 
MB, MO, and SDBS are released from the cryogel matrix to the outer solution. 
Due to the macroporous structure, the presence of acid/base (or anionic/cationic 
groups) and stimuli-sensitive polyampholyte cryogels is widely used in biomedi￾cine and biotechnology [113, 114], especially for binding, separation, and purif￾cation of target proteins from a mixture [115–117]. Polyampholyte cryogels can be 
used for the removal of metal ions, dyes, and surfactants from the aqueous solution 
[118–120]. Supporting noble and transition metal ions in bulk of amphoteric macro￾gels, followed by reduction to zero-valent state, will open new perspectives for the 
development of effective catalytic systems for decomposition, isomerization, hydro￾genation, and oxidation of various organic substrates. Both polyampholyte cryogel 
itself [121] and cryogel-immobilized metal nanoparticles [122–128] exhibit unique 
catalytic properties for various chemical reactions. 
3.7 MOLECULARLY IMPRINTED POLYAMPHOLYTE GELS 
Molecularly imprinted polyampholyte (MIP) hydrogels and cryogels are designed 
by crosslinking acid–base monomers in the presence of template proteins within the 
network [129–131]. After removing the template, the imprinted cavities can allow 
biological and chemical targets with similar size, geometry, and functional groups 
to rebind through noncovalent bonds, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals 
forces, hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction, or ionic interactions [132]. The stimuli￾sensitive ability of MIP networks to switch on/off the affnity of the networks for the 
imprinted molecules by fne-tuning of temperature, pH, and ionic strength is promis￾ing for biomedical applications [47–49]. 
A macroporous amphoteric polymer based on N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]meth￾acrylate and MAA was tailored in the presence of a pore-forming agent (CaCO3) 
and used as a template for bovine serum albumin and lysozyme [129]. Dual￾temperature/pH-sensitive polyampholyte gels of N,N-dimethylaminopropylacryla￾mide (DMAPAA) and AA were used as adsorbents and carriers with respect to bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) [133]. Macroporous interpenetrating amphoteric cryogels con￾taining methacrylic acid (frst network) and crosslinked chitosan (second network) 
exhibit excellent adsorption–desorption properties with respect to lysozyme [134]. 
The adsorption capacity of MIP with respect to BSA is much higher (~95%) 
than that of non-imprinted polyampholyte (NIP) cryogels (~24%), but the mass 118 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
transmission resistance is lower in cryogels compared with conventional non-mac￾roporous materials [135]. The adsorption saturation for NIP cryogel was reached 
within 20 min. In case of the MIP, it saturated in 50 min because of ftting of template 
to recognizing sites. MIP consisting of NIPAM, DMAEM, MAA, AAm monomers 
crosslinked by oligo(glutamic acid)–based peptide crosslinker has extremely high 
adsorption capacity of 607 mg/g and imprinting factor (IF) of 6 with respect to BSA 
[136]. The introduction of the peptide segments that are able to undergo pH-triggered 
reversible helix–coil conformational transition makes the imprint cavities shape-mem￾orable. Complete removal of the template BSA was achieved under mild conditions, 
for example, at physiological pH, ionic strength, and temperature. For investigation 
of the imprinting capability of polyampholyte cryogels based on such proteins as 
lysozyme, pepsin, ovalbumin, hemoglobin, and γ-globulin were chosen as templates 
[137]. The molecular weights of proteins were in the range of 14–210 kDa, the IEPs 
of proteins varied from 1 to 11, while the IEP of poly(allylamine-co-acrylic acid￾co-acrylamide) was estimated at about 4.5. An imprinting factor (IF) was calculated 
by the formula IF = kMIP/kNIP, where kMIP and kNIP are the retention factors on the 
molecularly imprinted polyampholyte (MIP) and non-imprinted polyampholyte 
(NIP) was in the range of 2–7 and the IF changed in the following order: lysozyme >> 
ovalbumin > hemoglobin > pepsin > γ-globulin. Thus, polyampholyte cryogels are 
suitable materials for separation and analysis of proteins and hopefully will play an 
important role in molecular recognition, separation science, and biocatalysis. 
Authors in [138] prepared lysozyme-imprinted polyampholyte hydrogel made 
of acrylamide, methacrylic acid, and N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate. The 
amount of the lysozyme template able to be extracted reached up to 83%. The selec￾tive adsorption tests showed the IF equal to 3.38 for lysozyme. 
A molecularly imprinted polyampholyte hydrogel with respect to BSA was 
prepared from acrylamide (AAm), N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), [2-(meth￾acry loyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (METMAC), 2-acrylamido￾2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) monomers and MBAA as the crosslinker 
[139]. The reason of selecting such monomers is to provide for protein hydrogen 
bonding, hydrophobic environment, and electrostatic interaction and increase the 
selectivity of cryogel matrix to recognize the key protein. The morphology of molec￾ularly imprinted polyampholyte hydrogels (MIPAHs) is different from non-imprinted 
polyampholyte hydrogels (NIPAHs). The pore diameter of MIPAHs is larger than 
that of NIPAHs. In order to optimize the structural and functional affnity, the pre￾paring conditions of MIPAHs were found, including AAm concentration, NIPAM/ 
AAm molar ratio, charge density ratio expressed as METMAC/AMPS molar ratio, 
crosslinking density. The maximal binding of BSA (1.97 mg/g) and IF (2.91) was 
found for equimolar polyampholyte hydrogel. It is suggested that in case of quenched 
polyampholyte gels, the specifc rebinding and selectively recognizing of imprinted 
proteins become tailorable. 
Polybetainic (or polyzwitterionic) hydrogels and cryogels based on poly{[2-(methacry 
loyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide}, PMODMSPA with 
excellent biocompatibility and antifouling properties were prepared by conventional 
polymerization at room temperature and cryopolymerization conditions [117]. Pol￾yampholyte cryogels showed high protein loading effciency up to 80% and very Stimuli-Responsive Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels 119 
sustained 4 months’ release of a model protein BSA with very little burst release, 
while the conventional polyampholyte hydrogel showed lower protein loading eff￾ciency (~45%) and a high burst release. The release of BSA from PMODMSPA 
hydrogel, poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (polyHEMA) hydrogel, and cryo￾gel matrix continued for four weeks, whereas the maximal release of BSA from 
PMODMSPA cryogel reached up to four months. 
A number of acrylamide-based polyampholyte-imprinted hydrogels with varying 
positive and negative charge densities were prepared in the presence of the target 
molecule bovine hemoglobin (Bhb) [140]. The ability of the hydrogels to selectively 
recognize Bhb was examined using a competitive template molecule, cytochrome C. 
The Bhb-imprinted gels exhibited template recognition properties that were depend￾ent on both the monomer charge density and on whether the chosen monomer carried 
a positive or negative charge. The simultaneous presence of two oppositely charged 
monomers in the pre-polymerization mixture resulted in imprinted hydrogels with 
cavities that contain highly specifc functional group orientation. The polyam￾pholyte hydrogels exhibited decreased swelling when compared to their polyelectro￾lyte counterparts, due to the shielding of repulsive interactions between oppositely 
charged monomers. This decreased swelling resulted in greater template recognition, 
but lower selectivity, when compared to their polyelectrolyte counterparts. 
Molecularly imprinted polyampholyte hydrogels based on nonionic monomer, 
acrylamide (AAm); anionic monomer, sodium salt of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-pro￾panesulfonic acid (AMPS); and cationic monomer, (3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethyl 
ammonium chloride (APTAC), were obtained by immobilization of bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) and lysozyme in situ polymerization conditions [141]. It was found 
that the best amphoteric hydrogel for sorption of BSA is APTAC-75H (with excess 
of cationic monomer), while for sorption of lysozyme is AMPS-75H (with excess 
of anionic monomer). The sorption capacity of APTAC-75H and AMPS-75H with 
respect to BSA and lysozyme is 305.7 and 64.1–74.8 mg per 1 g of hydrogel, respec￾tively. Desorption of BSA and lysozyme from MIP template performed by aqueous 
solution of 1 M NaCl is equal to 82–88%. Separation of BSA and lysozyme from 
their mixture was performed on MIP templates. The results of the adsorption–deso￾rption cycles of BSA on adjusted to BSA polyampholyte hydrogel APTAC-75H and 
of lysozyme on adjusted to lysozyme polyampholyte hydrogel AMPS-75H show 
that the mixture of BSA and lysozyme can be selectively separated with the help of 
MIP hydrogels. 
Two ionic drugs—β-agonist drug propranolol (weak base) and the non-steroi￾dal anti-infammatory drug ibuprofen (weak acid)—were used as templates within 
N-isopropylacrylamide-based amphoteric hydrogels composed of acrylic acid (AAc) 
and N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamide (APMA), and their ability to bind and release 
the drugs from the MIP matrix was evaluated as a function of pH, temperature, and 
ionic strength of the solution. [142]. The responsiveness to pH, temperature, and 
ionic strength and particularly the changes that the presence of the drug molecules 
causes in the stimuli sensitiveness were characterized in detail by means of swelling 
measurements and high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HS-DSC). The 
ability of the hydrogels to rebind propranolol or ibuprofen was quantifed at both 4 
and 37°C and at two different drug concentrations. The difference between hydrogels  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
120 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
bearing AAc or APMA and between imprinted and non-imprinted networks was also 
observed during the release tests in NaCl solutions of various concentrations. The 
obtained results may help the rational design of drug delivery systems based on stim￾uli-responsive, molecularly imprinted networks. 
Thus, the adsorption capacity of molecularly imprinted polyampholyte cryo￾gels with respect to proteins is much higher than in non-imprinted polyampholyte 
cryogels; however, the adsorption saturation time for MIP cryogel is longer than in 
non-imprinted polyampholyte cryogel because of the ftting of template to recog￾nizing sites; zwitterionic cryogels will prove useful for prolonged macromolecular 
therapeutic delivery and tissue engineering applications. 
The summary of this chapter is the following: 
1. Stimuli-responsive properties of polyampholytic hydrogels and cryo￾gels with respect to temperature, pH, ionic strength, and mixture of 
water–organic solution are similar to behavior of linear amphoteric 
macromolecules. 
2. Polyampholyte hydrogels and cryogels with anionic and cationic offsets 
behave in a typical polyelectrolyte character. 
3. The charge-balanced polyampholyte hydrogels and cryogels swell upon the 
addition of low-molecular-weight salts due to the disruption of intra- and 
interionic contacts and demonstrate antipolyelectrolyte effect. 
4. Polyampholyte hydrogels prepared by random copolymerization of oppo￾sitely charged ionic monomers at relatively high monomers concentration 
and equimolar monomers ratio represent a new class of physical hydrogels 
containing both strong and weak ionic bonds. The former serves as perma￾nent crosslinks to maintain the shape of the gel, the latter as sacrifcial net￾work responsible for elongation, deformation, adhesion, self-healing, shape 
memory, and other important functions. 
5. Molecularly imprinted polyampholyte (MIP) hydrogels and cryogels are 
promising materials for biomedical applications. 
6. Understanding the fundamental relationships between the microstructure 
and the property of linear and crosslinked amphoteric macromolecules, 
accompanied by systematic evaluation of literature sources, will open 
renewed interest to polyampholytes.

Macromolecular 4 Complexes of 
Polyampholytes 
4.1 INTRA- AND INTERPOLYELECTROLYTE 
COMPLEXES OF POLYAMPHOLYTES 
Macromolecular complexes of polyampholytes (MCP) represent the products of 
complexation of linear and crosslinked polyampholytes, possessing random, regu￾lar, graft, block, and dendritic microstructures, with polyelectrolytes, proteins, sur￾factants, metal ions, dyes, drugs, disperse, and nanoparticles [1–6]. From a theoretical 
point of view, the MCP are an interesting subject for understanding the protein fold￾ing mechanism, study of polyampholyte–protein complexes, enzymatic properties of 
protein–metal complexes, function of biological tissues, membranes, etc. [7,8]. From 
a practical point of view, the fundamental fndings of MCP can be utilized in the feld 
of bio- and nanotechnology, medicine, catalysis, hydrometallurgy, oil industry, and 
environment protection [9–17]. 
Polyampholytes can be involved in the formation of both intramacromolecular 
(intra-MMC) and intermacromolecular (inter-MMC) complexes [3]. The forma￾tion of intra-MMC was observed for a random copolymer composed of acrylic 
acid (AA), N,N’-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEM), and methyl meth￾acrylate (MMA) [18] and linear diblock polyampholytes [19–21] described in the 
previous section. Such intra-MMCs tend to precipitate in aqueous solution and dis￾solve in aqueous salt solutions. Authors in [22] studied the formation of inter-MMC 
between anionic diblock (AMPS-APTAC)91-(AMPS)67 (denoted as P(SA)91S67) 
and cationic diblock (AMPS-APTAC)91-(APTAC)88 (denoted as P(SA)91A88) poly￾ampholytes. In aqueous solution, they form stoichiometric polyion complex (PIC) 
micelles (Figure 4.1). 
Another example of inter-MMC formation is the mixture of poly[2-(methacry￾loyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine]-block-poly[3-(methacrylamido)propyltrimethyl￾ammonium chloride] (PMPC20-b-PMAPTAC190) and poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 
phosphorylcholine]-block-poly[sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate] 
(PMPC20-b-PAMPS196), leading to the spontaneous formation of core–shell PIC ves￾icles composed of PIC core and PMPC shells [23]. 
Cationic random copolymers (PCm) consisting of 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phos￾phorylcholine (MPC; P) with methacroylcholine chloride (MCC; C) and anionic 
random copolymers (PSn) consisting of MPC and potassium 3-(methacryloyloxy) 
propanesulfonate (MPS; S) were prepared via a RAFT method (“m” and “n” rep￾resent the compositions in mol.% of the MCC and MPS units in the copolymers, Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 131 
FIGURE 4.1 (a) Anionic diblock P(SA)91S67 and cationic diblock P(SA)91A88 polyampholytes

respectively) [24]. The degrees of polymerization for the copolymers were equal 
to 93–99. The water-soluble MPC unit contains a pendant zwitterionic phospho￾rylcholine group whose charges are neutralized in pendant groups. MCC and MPS 
units contain the cationic quaternary ammonium and anionic sulfonate groups, 
respectively. The stoichiometrically charge-neutralized mixture of a matched pair 
of PCm and PSn aqueous solutions resulted in the spontaneous formation of water￾soluble PCm/PSn polyion complex (PIC) micelles. These PIC micelles have the MPC￾rich surface and MCC/MPS core. These PIC micelles were characterized using 1H 
NMR, dynamic and static light scattering, and transmission electron microscopic 
measurements. The hydrodynamic radius of these PIC micelles depends on the mix￾ing ratio of the oppositely charged random copolymers. The charge-neutralized mix￾ture formed maximum-size PIC micelles. 
The effects of charge arrangement on the formation of intra- and interpolye￾lectrolyte complexes were evaluated for a series of statistical copolymers of 
methacrylic acid (MAA), sodium salt of MAA (NaMAA) and N-(3-amino￾propyl) methacrylamide (APM), poly(MAA-co-APM), and homopolymers of 
P(MAA) and P(APM) [25]. Poly(MAA-co-APM) with different molar composi￾tions [MAA+NaMAA]:[APM] = 24:76; 49:51; 41:59; 76:24 mol.%, abbreviated 
as PMA25, PMA51, PMA60, PMA75, respectively, contains approximately close to 
equimolar content of acid/base monomers (PMA51 and PMA60) or excess of acid 
(PMA75) and base (PMA25) monomers. The observed pHIEP for PMA51 of 7.50 is 
very close to its theoretical pHIEP of 7.58, estimated using Eq. 3 (see Refs. 33, 34 
in Chapter 1). A precisely equimolar 1:1 polyampholyte, PMA50, has a theoretical 
pHIEP of 6.9, refecting the strong dependence of pHIEP on very small changes in  
132 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
composition. The experimental pHIEP of the mixture of PMA75 (excess of acid mon￾omer) and PMA25 (excess of base monomer) as well as the mixture of homopoly￾mers P(NaMAA) and P(APM) are close to their theoretical value of 6.9. Intra- and 
interpolyelectrolyte complexation diagram for systems PMA51, PMA60, mixture of 
PMA75 and PMA25, mixture of P(NaMAA) and P(APM) is schematically repre￾sented in Figure 4.2. 
It is seen that increasing the separation of charges from polyampholytes to 
homopolyelectrolytes increases the interaction strength and, hence, resistance to 
both salt and pH. The distortion of the complementarity of amphoteric macromole￾cules can contribute to the formation of intramolecular complexes at the IEP of equi￾molar charge-balanced polyampholytes PMA51 and PMA60 due to intramolecular 
charge compensation and intermolecular complexes in case of PMA75 and PMA25. 
The limiting case of complete complementarity is that of oppositely charged pol￾yelectrolytes that form stoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes, as in the case of 
P(NaMAA) and P(APM). 
FIGURE 4.2 Illustration of intra- and interpolyelectrolyte complex formation with 
participation of homopolyelectrolytes P(NaMAA) and P(APM), PMA25 and P(APM), 
PMA25 and PMA75, and within equimolar polyampholytes PMA51 and PMA60. P(APM) and 
P(NaMAA) are homopolymers of APM and NaMAA, respectively. Copolymer composition 
is described as PMAxx, where xx stands for the mol.% of APM in the copolymer with NaMAA. 
The complexes PMA25-P(APM) and PMA25-PMA60 comprise their cationic and anionic (co) 
polymer constituents in 1:2 and 5:2 mole ratios, respectively, to ensure charge balance.

Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 133 
4.2 POLYAMPHOLYTE–POLYELECTROLYTE, POLYAMPHOLYTE– 
PROTEIN, AND POLYAMPHOLYTE–DNA COMPLEXES 
Polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte (or protein, DNA) complexation is perspective for 
protein separation and delivery of DNA into the cell [26–29] together with lowered 
immunogenic activity [30]. The structure of polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte com￾plexes strongly depends on the charge distribution of the polyampholyte chain, and 
the stability of complexes is changed in the following order: block polyampholyte– 
polyelectrolyte > statistical polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte > alternating polyam￾pholyte–polyelectrolyte [31]. The polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte complexation was 
evaluated by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations [32, 33]. Snapshots 
of the branch structure formed between random polyampholyte and polyelectrolyte 
(RPA-PE) and micellar aggregate formed between diblock polyampholyte and poly￾electrolyte (DBPA-PE) are shown in Figure 4.3. 
The specifc feature of polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte complexes is that polye￾lectrolyte chains bind only oppositely charged repeating units of polyampholytes; 
the unbond fragments of polyampholytes in the form of charged loops and tails are 
responsible for water solubility [34].

contribution to the fast development of interpolyelectrolyte (or interpolymer) com￾plexes. The complexation between statistic polyampholyte 2-methyl-5-vinylpyri￾dine-acrylic acid (2M5VPy-AA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was fst studied by 
V. A. Kabanov et al. [40]. Later, the same authors studied the interaction between 
chitosan-based polyampholyte and 2,5-ionene bromide [41] and the interaction of 
amphoteric dendrimers with linear and crosslinked anionic and cationic polyelectro￾lytes [42, 43]. Alternating copolymers of N,N-dimethyldiallylammonium and alkyl 
(or aryl) derivatives of maleamic acids were involved into complexation with PAA 
and poly(styrene sodium sulfonate) (NaPSS) [44]. The cooperative binding of BPA 
of the anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes was demonstrated in [45, 46]. 
Figure 4.4 shows the phase diagram of the system consisting of BPA (PMAA-b￾P1M4VPCl) and PVBTMACl as a function of BPA concentration and pH of the 
solution [46]. 
Three phases, which are solution, gel, and precipitate, are observed in this sys￾tem (Table 4.1). They can transform each other by altering either PEC concentra￾tion or pH. 
Both the phase transition precipitate–microgel and opaque solution–microgel at 
low pH are subject to the swelling of inter-MMC particles and a result of suppression 
of interaction among the ionized carboxylic groups of acidic block in inter-MMC 
formation. The gel formation process is accompanied by the release of some amount

the basis of the preceding results, the transitions precipitate–opaque solution, pre￾cipitate–microgel, and opaque solution–microgel are represented in Figure 4.5 [34]. 
The inter-MMC in the form of PIC micelles were prepared by the mixing of a 
diblock copolymer P(VS)17A50 and polyacrylic acid (PAAc49) in a basic medium 
because of electrostatic interactions between the cationic PAPTAC block and depro￾tonated anionic PAAc49 (Figure 4.6) [47]. 
The spherical-shaped PIC vesicle shows the thermoresponsive behavior affected 
by the pH of the solution. The PIC vesicle can encapsulate water-soluble nonionic 
guest molecules at a high pH and release them under acidic conditions, implying that 
it could be used as a drug delivery system. The interaction of the PIC vesicle with the 
cell can be controlled by temperature because the surface hydrophobicity increases 
with decreasing temperature. Therefore, it is expected that the PIC vesicle can be 
taken in the cell at a low temperature below the UCST of the P(VS)17 shells, and the 
encapsulated hydrophilic anticancer drugs can be released under acidic conditions 
from the P(VS)17A50/PAAc49 PIC vesicle. 
Authors in [28, 48, 49] studied the complexation of polycarbobetaines with NaPSS, 
DNA and polyzwitterion, poly[3-dimethyl(methacryloyloxyethyl ammonium pro￾pane sulfonate)] (PDMAPS), with polymeric anion; poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl 
propane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS), or polymeric cations; poly(3-acrylamidopropyl￾trimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDMAPAA-Q); and x,y-ionene bromides (x = 3, 6; 
y = 3,4). Such polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte systems exhibit the different geomet￾rical structures. In case of PDMAPS-PAMPS, an ammonium cation in the middle 
interacts with sulfonate anion of PAMPS. In case of PDMAPAA-Q and PDMAPS, 
the sulfonates located at the end of the side chain are occupied by the quaternary 
ammonium groups of PDMAPAA-Q. PDMAPS can interact with ionene through 
the sulfonates located at the end of the side chain. In case of complexation between 
PAMPS and poly-N-(carboxymethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2-(methacryloyloxy) ethanam￾inium) (PCDME), a polyzwitterion with a weak acidic moiety, the formation of four 
unique categories of hydrogels with different swelling ratios and Young’s moduli 
was demonstrated [50]. By only modifying the relative content of two fxed chemical 136 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

a charge-balanced polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) gel (1< R <3); a conventional, 
neutral, and elastic interpenetrating network (IPN) gel (3< R <6.5); and a tough 
and stiff double-network (DN) gel (R >6.5) are formed. Both the PEC and DN gels 
exhibit high toughness and fracture stress, up to 1.8 and 1.5 MPa, respectively. 
Complexation of polyampholyte gels and linear polyelectrolytes is a less-con￾sidered subject. The swelling–deswelling behavior of the amphoteric gel of maleic 
acid (MA), N,N’-dimehyldiallylammonium chloride (DMDAAC), and diallylamine 
(DAA) was studied in the presence of NaPSS [51]. As distinct from the ampho￾teric gel MA-DMDAAC-DAA, which shrinks at the IEP (pH ≈ 4.6), the complex of 
MA-DMDAAC-DAA with NaPSS collapses over a wide range of pH because the 
NaPSS entrapped in the gel network acts an as additional physical crosslinker. 
Polyampholyte–protein interaction of random and block polyampholytes based on 
DMAEM-MAA-MMA with soybean tripsin inhibitor (STI), ovalbumin, ribonucle￾ase, and lysozyme was comprehensively studied [52, 53]. The most favorable region 
of interaction of polyampholyte and protein arranges between their isoelectric points 
[54–56]. Increasing the salt concentration suppresses the polyampholyte–protein 
interaction, confrming that the main driving force of self-aggregation is electrostatic 
[57]. Protein analysis of the supernatant and precipitate revealed that only about 10% 
of the protein precipitates with the random polyampholyte DMAEM-MAA-MMA, 
while 90% of the protein remains in the equilibrium liquid, while block polyam￾pholyte DMAEM-MAA-MMA shows the opposite trend with 90% precipitation of 
protein [58]. Separation of protein mixture with the help of random triblock polyam￾pholytes DMAEM8MMA12MAA16 was performed [18, 59]. In the proposed method 
for protein separation by precipitation, a polyampholyte is added to a mixture of 
two proteins to be separated, one with a net negative charge and the other with a 
net positive charge. A prerequisite in the process is that the two oppositely charged 
proteins do not interact strongly with each other. Depending on the net charge of the 
polyampholyte added, one of the proteins forms a complex with the polyampholyte 
and precipitates, while the other remains in the supernatant phase. The resulting pro￾tein–polyampholyte precipitate can be removed from the system and redissolved at 
a different pH. Finally, protein and polyampholyte can be separated from each other 
by precipitating the polyampholyte at its IEP. The unique separation of the protein 
mixture can be performed at the IEP of block polyampholytes. In this case, one of 
the blocks of polyampholyte interacts with one charge of protein which is opposite 
to its charge, while the main chain (or other block) with another protein charge, as 
illustrated in Figure 4.7 [3]. 
In both cases, protein release process occurs at the IEP of polyampholyte due 
to the formation of intraionic polyelectrolyte complexes between anionic and cat￾ionic blocks. Uptake/release of cytochrome C by random and “core–shell” poly￾ampholyte microgels consisted of N-vinylcaprolactame (VCL), itaconic acid 
(IA) (VCL-IA “core” part) and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), N-vinylimidazole 
(VI) (NIPAM-VI “shell” part) [60], and sorption/desorption of sodium salt of poly(sty￾renesulfonic acid) (PSSNa) by “core–shell” polyampholyte microgels composed of 
anionic, an itaconic acid monomethyl ether (NIPAM-co-MIA) “shell,” and cationic, 
N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride (NIPAM-co-APMH) “core” [61], 138 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

was carried out. The isoelectric points pHIEP of random and “core–shell” polyam￾pholyte microgels (VCL-IA/NIPAM-VI) were replaced near of pH ~6.0. Random 
and “core–shell” polyampholyte microgels were loaded by cytochrome C at pH 8.0. 
The pH-triggered protein release results show that cytochrome C is released much 
faster at the IEP (pH ~6.0) for both polyampholyte systems due to the formation of 
intra-MMC between oppositely charged groups of amphoteric macromolecules. The 
uptake and release of PSSNa by “core–shell” amphoteric microgels were realized at 
pH 2.0 and 11.0, respectively. Strong binding of PSSNa with cationic fragment of 
APMH in “core” of NIPAM-co-APMH requires high pH of 10 for full deprotonation 
of APMH groups to destruct the amphoteric microgel–PSSNa complexes. 
Separation of lysozyme from white egg was performed with the help of zwitterionic 
monolithic column derived from N,N-dimethyl-N-methacryloxyethyl-N-(3-sulfopro￾pyl)ammonium betaine crosslinked by ethylenedimethacrylate [62]. The effcient sep￾aration of lysozyme from other proteins (ovalbumin, conalbumine, cytochrome C, 
and myoglobin) was achieved by changing the pH of the mobile phase. Lysozyme 
selectively adsorbed in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 was quantitatively eluted at pH 2.0. 
Polyampholyte hydrogels and cryogels can effectively adsorb proteins by 
preliminary prepared networks or imprinting of proteins within the network 
in situ polymerization conditions. Macroporous amphoteric polymers based on 
N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate and methacrylic acid [63], N-[3-(dimethylamino) 
propyl]methacrylate and MAA [64], and N,N-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide and 
AA [65] were used as template, adsorbents, and carriers with respect to bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) and lysozyme. 
Polyampholytes are able to bind polynucleotides and oligonucleotides, such 
as siRNA, or pDNA and deliver to mammalian cells for the treatment of genet￾ic-based diseases [27]. The literature survey reveals that synthetic polyampholytes Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 139 
are a less-explored subject with respect to gene delivery compared to cationic 
polyelectrolytes [66–68]. Several types of BPA, namely, high-charge BPA com￾posed of linear poly(ethyleneimine) (LPEI) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), 
and low-charge BPA, composed of LPEI and poly(glutamic acid) (PGA) [69], 
multi-stimuli-responsive chiral–achiral amino acid–based block copolymers com￾posed of poly(N-acryloyl amino acid) and poly(vinyl amine) [70], and comb-type 
polyampholyte consisting of a poly(L-lysine) backbone and hyaluronic acid side 
chains [71] were tested with respect to DNA delivery. It was found that delivery 
is increased and toxicity is reduced relative to complexes formed between polyca￾tions and DNA (or siRNA). The delivered DNA (or siRNA) is effective in inhib￾iting specifc gene expression in cells. In the context of DNA delivery, the release 
mechanism of DNA can be schematically represented by Figure 4.8 [3]. 
The resulting BPA–DNA polyplex may aggregate with the formation of a “core– 
shell” structure, where the “core” part are the inter-polyelectrolyte complexes formed 
between the cationic block of the BPA and the anionic DNA, while the “shell” part 
consists of the anionic block preserving the solubility of BPA–DNA complexes in water 
and simultaneously preventing interaction with proteins. At or near the isoelectric point 
(IEP), the cooperative intraionic contacts between anionic and cationic blocks can pre￾vail over the interionic contacts between the cationic block and DNA. As a result, ani￾onic and cationic blocks of BPA form themselves intraionic polycomplexes and DNA 
releases. Thus, if intrachain interaction between anionic and cationic blocks of BPA 
(intra-MMC) prevails over interchain interaction between BPA and DNA (inter-MMC), 
the latter can be detached from the BPA–DNA complex and released at the IEP of BPA. 
Such phenomenon might be vital because the realization of the “isoelectric effect” was 
confrmed at the IEP of water-soluble polyampholytes [54], polyampholytic microgels 
[60], hydrogels, and cryogels [63] with respect to polyelectrolytes and proteins [18]. 
The polyampholyte–protein, polyampholyte–DNA, and polyampholyte–cell sys￾tems surveyed from literature sources are summarized in Table 4.2. 
An alternative way of protein separation are molecularly imprinted polyampholyte 
(MIP) hydrogels and cryogels that are synthesized by crosslinking acid–base mon￾omers in the presence of template proteins forming polyampholyte–protein com￾plexes within the network [82–84]. After removing the template, a cavity with a 
complementary shape and selective recognition properties to template molecules is 
maintained [85]. The stimuli-sensitive ability of MIP networks to switch on/off the 
affnity of the networks for the imprinted molecules by fne-tuning temperature, pH, 
and ionic strength for biomedical applications was considered in Chapter 3, “Stim￾uli-Responsive Amphoteric Nano-, Micro-, and Macroporous Gels.” 
4.3 POLYAMPHOLYTE–METAL COMPLEXES 
Metal complexes of polyampholytes are useful to model the complexation of pro￾teins with metal ions [86, 87], to model the active sites of enzymes as cofactors 
[88, 89], and to produce metal nanoparticles by reduction of polymer–metal com￾plexes [90–92]. Complexation of “annealed” polyampholytes with transition metal 
ions can proceed via ionic, coordination, or ion-coordination bonds. A copolymer of 
vinyl-2-aminoethyl ether-co-methacrylic acid (VAE-co-MAA) forms with copper(II) 140 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

electroneutrality of macromolecular chain [1, 93] (Figure 4.9).
Water-soluble polycarboxybetaines (PCB) modified by ethanolamine and glycine 
lead to the formation of mixed five- and six-membered chelate complexes with cop￾per(II) ions (Figure 4.10) [1, 94–98].
As distinct from linear PCB analogs, the interaction of copper ions with PCB 
hydrogels is accompanied by gradual coloring and shrinking of sample [99] (see 
Figure 7.2, Chapter 7). The thin colored shell layer which is formed on the hydrogel 
surface gradually moves into the gel interior. The driving force of this process is 
“ion-hopping transportation” of metal ions through intra- and intermolecular com￾plex formation, for example, continuous migration of metal ions deeply into the gel 
interior by exchanging free ligand vacancies [35]. Desorption of copper(II) ions 
from the gel interior by 0.1 M HCl starts from the surface due to the destruction of 
ligand–metal complexes and leaching out of metal ions to the outer solution. Peri￾odic washing out of gel specimen by distilled water leads to its full regeneration.

4.4 POLYAMPHOLYTE–SURFACTANT COMPLEXES
Interaction of the statistical copolymer of 1,2,5-trimethyl-4-vinylethynylpiperid￾inol-4 and acrylic acid (TMVEP-co-AA), regular copolymer of styrene and N,N￾dimethylaminopropylmonoamide of maleic acid (St-co-DMAPMAMA) [101–103], 
copolymers of 2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine and acrylic acid (2M5VPy-co-AA) [104], 
and diblock [(PMAA)36-b-(P1M4VPCl)64] [105] polyampholytes with sodium dode￾cylsulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTMA) leads to the for￾mation of compact particles stabilized by hydrophobic contacts of the long alkyl 
chain of detergents. Polyampholyte–surfactant complexes are preserved in an aque￾ous solution with the help of noncomplexing (free) monomeric units of copolymers. 
Alternating polyampholytes of N,N’-diallyl-N,N’-dimethylammonium chloride and 
maleamic acid (phenylmaleamic acid, 4-butylphenylmaleamic acid) complexed 
with fatty acids (dodecanoic acid and perfluorododecanoic acid) formed polyam￾pholyte-coated micelles [106] (Figure 4.11).

acid. Langmuir 2002, 18, 5099–5105. Copyright 2002 American Chemical Society.)146 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
It is proposed that the binding of dodecanoate at frst leads to the formation of loose 
aggregates, which reorganize to micelles with a core of alkyl chains of surfactants and 
shell of carboxylates. The size of self-assembled polyampholyte-wrapped micelles 
is in the range of 3–5 nm. 
Koetz and Fechner [107] studied the behavior of polyampholyte–sur￾factant complexes at the water–air interface. The selected polyampholytes 
belong to strongly alternating, weak polyampholytes PalH (poly(N,N’-diallyl￾N,N-dimethylammonium-alt-maleamic carboxylate), PalPh (poly-N,N’-diallyl-N,N￾dimethylammonium-alt-N-phenylmaleamic carboxylate), PalPhCarb (poly-N,N’-di￾allyl-N,N-dimethylammonium-alt-p-carboxyphenylmaleamic carboxylate), and PalPh 
BisCarb (poly-N,N’-diallyl-N,N-dimethylammonium-alt-3,5-bis-(carboxyphenyl) 
maleamic carboxylate); the anionic surfactant is SDS. The surface tension of pure 
polyampholytes increases in the following order: PalPh > PalPhCarb > PalPhBis￾Carb ≈ PalPh. An enhancement of the hydrophobicity of the copolymer leads to 
an increase of surface activity of polyampholytes. The drastic reduction of surface 
tension was observed for all investigated system below the critical micelle concen￾tration (CAC) of SDS due to the adsorption of a monolayer of surface-active poly￾ampholyte/SDS complexes. The depletion effects were detected for the PalPhCarb/ 
SDS, the formation of multilayers, for the systems PalPh/SDS and PalPhBisCarb/ 
SDS, which bear the highest surface activity. Conformational transition of TMVEP￾co-AA/SDS and St-co-DMAPMAMA/SDS complex particles from one compact 
structure to another (reversible micelle) via extended state was observed in water– 
alcohol mixture [101–103]. 
Solubilization/precipitation behavior of polyampholyte–surfactant complexes 
formed between 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride (MAD￾QUAT) and sodium salt of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate (AMPS) and 
charged surfactants was studied by authors [108]. Polyampholytes with excess of 
anionic or cationic groups swell in water and are solubilized in the presence of 
cationic and anionic surfactants above a particular surfactant concentration that 
is proportional to the polymer concentration. The polyampholyte with excess of 
AMPS (80/20) precipitates in the presence of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bro￾mide (TTAB), whereas equimolar polyampholytes AMPS-co-MADQUAT (50/50) 
dissolve upon the addition of SDS. After the precipitation of 80/20-TTAB com￾plexes, these complexes resolubilize at increased concentration of TTAB. The com￾plexation of charge unbalanced AMPS-co-APTAC (25/75) and AMPS-co-APTAC 
(75/25) polyampholytes of linear and crosslinked structure with respect to anionic 
surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and cationic surfactant cetyltri￾methylammonium chloride (CTMAC) is accompanied by changes in turbidity, zeta 
potential, and average hydrodynamic diameter of colloid particles [109]. The com￾position of polyampholyte–surfactant complexes was found from the extremums of 
the curves and at ζ = 0. It is obvious that SDBS binds the positively charged APTAC, 
while CTMAC, the negatively charged AMPS. In both cases the surfactant mole￾cules form intramolecular micelle structures surrounded by negatively or positively 
charged monomers. Complexation of quenched polyampholyte hydrogels composed 
of sodium methacrylate and N,N-dimethyl-N,N-diallylammonium chloride with 
cetylpyridinium chloide (CPC) and SDBS is accompanied by the gradual shrinking Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 147 
of samples because the cationic and anionic surfactants interact with anionic and 
cationic groups of amphoteric hydrogels [110]. Gradual penetration of surfactant 
molecules inside the hydrogel volume can lead to the formation of micelles within 
the hydrogel matrix and hydrophobization of the whole system and overall shrinking 
of hydrogel volume. 
Polysulfobetaine–surfactant complexes, namely, poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)-
SDS (PSBMA-SDS) and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)-cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (PSBMA-CTAB), signifcantly infuence the UCST of pristine PSBMA 
[111]. The binding of SDS to PSBMA prevents the appearance of UCST, while CTAB 
shifts the cloud point temperature of PSBMA to a higher temperature, resulting in 
the precipitation of the aggregates from the solution. The hydrophobic domains of 
PSBMA–SDS complexes were used for the stabilization of fuorescent molecules 
(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, pyrene, and curcumin) that could be useful 
for the detection of trace amounts of aromatic pollutants in aqueous systems. 
Polyampholyte–surfactant complexes based on methacrylic acid, ethylene glycol 
diglycidyl ether, and 2-methylimidazole (poly(EGDE-MAA-2MI)) with SDS (or 
SDBS) were suggested for solubilization and extraction of bisphenol A  from the 
waste [112]. 
Diblock poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(2-dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate) (PAA-b￾PDMAEMA) polyampholytes were used to prepare core–shell complexes with ionic 
surfactants [113]. Complexes with the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammo￾nium (CTA+) form oblate particles, while complexes with dodecyl sulfate (DS–), 
form cylindrical rods (Figure 4.12). 
In both types of particles, the surfactant in the core forms rod-like aggregates, 
arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal structure, with the surfactant rods aligned 
with the axis of rotational symmetry in the particle. With charged polymer chains in 
the shell, the aggregates present a striking stability over time, displaying no change

in particle size over the time scale investigated (ten months). Nevertheless, the aggre￾gates are highly dynamic in nature, and their shapes and structures can be changed 
dramatically in dispersion, without intermediate precipitation, by changes in the 
composition of the medium. Specifcally, a transition from aggregates with cationic 
surfactant to aggregates with anionic surfactant can be achieved. 
4.5 POLYAMPHOLYTE–DYE COMPLEXES 
Investigations on polyampholyte–dye complexes are rather scarce in comparison 
with polyampholyte–metal and polyampholyte–surfactant complexes. Polyampholy￾tes are effective agents for the purifcation of dye-containing wastewaters [114]. pH￾dependent binding of 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid (ANS) with block polyam￾pholyte PMAA-b-P1M4VPCl shows the decrease of the reduced viscosity at pH 4–6 
and sharp increase of relative fuorescence intensity I/I0 of ANS in the range of pH 
6–8 [105, 115]. The frst can be accounted by the formation of polyampholyte–ANS 
complexes; the latter is probably the result of the accumulation of dye molecules in 
the hydrophobic region of macromolecular complex. 
Repeatedly, the temperature-dependent adsorption/desorption behavior of 
quenched polyampholyte composed of NaPSS and vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium 
chloride (VBTMAC) was demonstrated with respect to bisphenol A [116]. The 
NaPSS-co-VBTMAC absorbs bisphenol A  at room temperature and releases it at 
higher temperature that is very important for the removal of hydrophobic aromatic 
compounds from very dilute aqueous solutions. 
Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) flms of poly(N,N-diallyl-N-octadecylamine-alt-maleic 
acid) with two amphiphilic fuorophores—alkyl-substituted rhodamine dyes—were 
prepared and investigated [117, 118]. The π-A isotherm of hydrophobic polyam￾pholyte is typical for the monolayer in liquid state. Mixed monolayers of polyam￾pholyte and rhodamine dyes show improved packing due to the aggregation of dyes 
in the densely packed multilayer flms. 
Polyethylenimine (PEI)–based polyampholytes, with predefned ratio of cationic 
and anionic functionalities, were used for dye adsorption study [119]. Due to the 
electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions, the polyampholytes are insol￾uble in distilled water at pH~6.5, however can form stable nano/microparticles 
(radius ~200 nm) at 0.8 N aqueous NaCl solution or higher salt concentration. The 
dye adsorption ability of the polyampholytes is studied in detail, revealing multi￾layered adsorption phenomenon (better ftted to Freundlich isotherm) and pseudo￾second-order adsorption kinetics. 
Polyampholyte hydrogels AMPS-co-APTAC containing an excess of negative and 
positive charges effectively absorb methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO), 
respectively, due to electrostatic binding [109]. No binding of MB or MO is observed 
for charge-balanced polyampholyte as a result of mutual compensation of opposite 
charges that restrict the penetration of ionic dyes into the hydrogel matrix. Release of 
dye molecules from hydrogel matrix was performed in 0.5M KCl medium. The driv￾ing force of dye release from the hydrogel matrix is a replacement of electrostatically 
bound dye by low-molecular-weight salt. The amount of released dye molecules over 
one day is 70–75%.  
Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 149 
Novel intelligent ampholyte hydrogel prepared by a free radical solution redox 
polymerization of acrylamide, acrylic acid, 2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammo￾nium chloride as monomers, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker was 
used for dye sorption [120]. The binding of carminic acid was L-type according to 
the Giles classifcation system, while crystal violet and methyl violet were S-type. 
Binding parameters of dyes such as binding constant, monolayer coverage, and max￾imum fractional occupancy were calculated from the Langmuir model or Saraydın 
model. This study could be a pioneering model for the preparation of potential and 
effective intelligent ampholyte hydrogels for the removal of both anionic and cati￾onic dyes from aquatic environments by electrostatic interaction/H-bonding. 
4.6 STABILIZATION OF METAL NANOPARTICLES 
BY POLYAMPHOLYTES 
In this section, the preparation and characterization of metal nanoparticles stabilized 
by polyampholytes will be summarized. Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes obtained by 
modifcation of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) by 3%, 10%, and 20% butylamine were 
used to stabilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) [121]. The color of aqueous colloidal 
gold dispersions can vary from red to blue in dependence on the particle size, for 
example, 18 nm sized gold nanoparticles show a red color, while the color changes to 
purple or blue when larger particles or aggregates are formed. In the presence of PAA 
samples with hydrophobic side chains (≥10%), thermal stability is improved due to 
the presence of microdomains decorating the particle surface. 
Another polyampholyte, poly-(N,N-diallyl-N,N-dimethylammonium-alt-N-oc￾tyl-maleamic carboxylate) (PalOC), can be used as a reducing and stabilizing com￾ponent for the gold nanoparticle formation [122]. Spherical gold nanoparticles can 
be formed in aqueous gold chloride solutions as well as in water-in-oil microemul￾sions after incorporating the polyampholyte. DLS measurements indicate particle 
dimensions of about 14 nm, which is in agreement with the diameter observed in 
TEM micrographs. The produced gold nanoparticles are electrosterically stabilized. 
The sulfonated cardo poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPES) with one amine and two 
sulfonate groups on the hydrophobic backbone exhibits unusual properties in solu￾tion and at interfaces due to the intra- and intermolecular electrostatic interactions 
between positively and negatively charged functional groups in the polymer chains 
[123]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) protected by SPES (abbreviated as Au@SPES) 
were synthesized in the presence of NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The SPES-modifed 
gold nanoparticles were stable in the entire pH range between 2 and 14. TEM micro￾graphs show well-dispersed AuNPs smaller than 4 nm with a relatively narrow size 
distribution in good agreement with XRD measurements of the average Au particle 
size determined from the Scherrer equation with 4.2 nm. One of the specifc prop￾erties of polyampholytes in aqueous solution is the tendency to precipitate near the 
isoelectric point (IEP), where strong electrostatic interactions between oppositely 
charged groups lead to particle compacting by squeezing out the solvent. In the case 
of Au@SPES, the whole system precipitates in water at a pH ≈ 0. The color of the 
precipitate indicates that the AuNPs were well stabilized by SPES. This is in contrast 
to the colorless aqueous solution, confrming the absence of AuNPs in supernatant.  
 
150 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
The Au@SPES precipitate dissolved in water at pH 2. Precipitation–dissolution phe￾nomenon for Au@SPES was also observed in the water–THF (or alcohol) mixture 
and in excess of water. 
Several diblock polyampholytes, that is, poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(N,N-di￾methylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PMAA-b-PDMAEMA), of varying molar mass 
and block length were used to stabilize AuNPs [124]. The gold nanoparticles were 
formed in DMF and in THF. The solvent properties directly infuence the particle 
size of the AuNPs. The results indicated that the average particle size is 5.1 ± 2.7 
nm in THF and 3± 2.6 nm in DMF, respectively. The larger size of AuNPs in THF 
can be explained by the higher tendency of the PDMAEMA blocks to aggregate in 
low-polarity THF. 
6-O-carboxylmethyl chitosan (CMC) with a quite similar number of cationic 
(-NH3
+) and anionic (-COO-
) functional groups, a water-soluble amphoteric chitosan 
derivative, can be used as a pH-sensitive template for the reversible assembly of 
AuNPs [125,126]. Aggregation phenomena of gold nanoparticles were observed 
at very low pH of 2 and very high pH values (pH  =  12) and lead to aggregates 
of very different morphologies. TEM micrographs at pH 9.6 show that the average 
diameter (≈100 particles) is ≈ 5 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images verify 
that spherical particles are formed. At pH 12, the individual AuNPs form needlelike 
aggregates. The HRTEM image shows that the particle–particle distance in these 
aggregates becomes less than 3 nm. At pH 2, the gold aggregates become larger and 
more densely packed. The morphology of the aggregates with 360 nm long and 150 
nm wide is more regular with symmetrical angles on the cluster ends. Depending on 
the pH, the color of the colloidal dispersions change from purple at pH = 2 to pink at 
pH = 9.6 to mauve at pH = 12. Reversibility upon altering the pH was confrmed by 
a shift of the plasmon resonance UV-absorption band from 526 nm (pH 2) to 510 nm 
(pH 9.6) and to 515 nm (pH 12). 
Amphoteric copolymers of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and acrylic 
acid (DMAEM-AA) in molar ratios of acidic to basic monomers 2:1, 1:1, and 
1:2 (abbreviated as AP-21, AP-11, and AP-12) were used to stabilize CdS [127], 
Ag2S [128], and silver nanoparticles [129]. The shape and the size of the silver 
nanoparticles (AgNPs) performed by the reduction of AgNO3 in the presence of 
the copolymers can be regulated by varying the ratio of comonomer units. The 
reduction in the AP-21 solution leads to the formation of mostly spherical nan￾oparticles, with an average diameter of 8.3 nm, in contrast to AP-12 solutions, 
where disklike larger particles are formed. In the presence of AP-11, the reduction 
leads to the formation of anisotropic particles, that is, nano-plates as well as trian￾gular and hexagonal thin prisms. The formation of polygonal and platelike silver 
nanoparticles in the case of DMAEMA-AA copolymers opens new perspectives 
on evaluating the effects of pH, ionic strength, water–organic solvent mixture, 
molecular mass of copolymers, and photochemically induced transformations 
of pre-prepared silver nanoplates in the presence of polyampholytes. A series of 
AuNPs stabilized by various hydrophobically modifed polyampholytes with an 
average size between 11 and 44 nm and the corresponding plasmonic resonance at 
530–550 nm were shown [130, 131].  
 
 
Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 151 
The fat gold nanoplatelets, especially nanotriangles, are predominantly formed in 
a vesicular template phase in the presence of a polyampholyte, that is, poly-(N,N-di￾allyl-N,N-dimethylammonium-alt-3,5-bis-carboxyphenyl-maleamic carboxylate) 
(PalPhBisCarb) [132, 133]. The extraordinary effect of the polyampholyte is related, 
on the one hand, to the morphological transformation of the vesicle phase into a 
tubular network structure [134] and, on the other hand, to the preferred lateral growth 
of the gold nanoplatelets [132, 133]. Due to the symmetry-breaking effect of the 
polyampholyte by adsorption on the {111} faces of the gold nanoplatelets, experi￾mentally detected by a decrease of the zeta potential from −79 ± 3m V to −69 ± 3m V 
[132], the gold nanoparticle growth in vertical direction is hindered. Time-dependent 
SAXS measurements have shown that in the frst time period, 6.5 nm sized spherical 
gold nanoparticles are formed, which tend to form soft particle aggregates, and after 
one hour, fat nanocrystals are formed at the periphery of the particle aggregates. The 
particle growth can be described by a diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening process 
[135]. The nanoplatelets can be separated from spherical gold nanoparticles by using 
a polyampholyte/micelle-based depletion focculation process [136]. 
The chemical modifcation of chitosan with phthalimide moieties leads to the syn￾thesis of two water-soluble bisphthalimides (BPIs), namely, N,N´-(1,3-phenylene) 
bis(phthalimide-5-carboxylic acid) (BPI-1) and N,N´-(1,4-phenylene)bis(phthalim￾ide-5-carboxylic acid) (BPI-2), with low molecular weights useful in the green syn￾thesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) [137]. The FTIR, 1H NMR, TEM, and UV–Vis 
results revealed that the BPIs can reduce gold ions and stabilize AuNPs in the col￾loidal solutions. The shape of the Au nanoparticles was quasi-spherical, while the 
average sizes of AuNPs stabilized with the compounds BPI-1 and BPI-2 were 3 and 
12 nm, respectively. The faster reaction to obtain AuNPs was with the polyampholyte 
derivative of chitosan (5 min), due to a high quantity of oxidizable groups found in 
the polymer structure by its high molecular weight. The average size of AuNPs sta￾bilized with the polyampholyte was 10 nm. 
Polyampholytic graft copolymers, based on poly(dehydroalanine)-graft-poly(eth￾ylene glycol) (PDha-g-PEG), which feature a polyampholytic backbone with varying 
net charge and charge densities at different pH values and PEG grafts, providing 
molecular solubility over the entire pH range, can selectively interact with [AuCl4]− 
and Ag+ salts and permit a straightforward synthesis of Ag, Au, and AgAu alloy 
nanoparticles induced by UV irradiation, thermal treatment, and chemical reduction 
[138]. 
The main features of macromolecular complexes of polyampholytes can be sum￾marized as follows: 
1. Polyampholytes can be involved in the formation of both intramacromo￾lecular (intra-MMC) and intermacromolecular (inter-MMC) complexes. 
2. Formation of intra-MMC is specifc at the pHIEP of annealed polyampho￾lytes possessing random, regular, block structure, and also for charge￾balanced quenched polyampholytes. Such intra-MMC tends to precipitate 
in aqueous solution and dissolve in aqueous salt solutions. 
3. Formation of inter-MMC takes place between anionic diblock and cationic 
diblock polyampholytes surrounded by an excess of anionic and cationic  
 
 
 
 
 
152 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
blocks preserving the “core–shell” structure of polymeric micelles and 
vesicles in aqueous solution from precipitation. 
4. The stability polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte complexes depends on the 
charge distribution of the polyampholyte chain and increases in the order 
block polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte > statistical polyampholyte–poly￾electrolyte > alternating polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte. The same order 
is adequate for polyampholyte–protein complexes. Block polyampholytes 
bind the anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes as well as proteins and 
DNA more cooperatively in comparison with statistical and alternative 
polyampholytes. 
5. Selective complexation of block polyampholytes with proteins can be used 
for the separation of proteins from their mixture. The release of proteins 
and DNA can take place at the pHIEP of block polyampholyte when the 
cooperative intraionic contacts between anionic and cationic blocks prevail 
over the interionic contacts between block polyampholyte and protein (or 
DNA). 
6. Complexation of acid–base groups of annealed polyampholytes with tran￾sition metal ions can proceed via ionic, coordination, or ion–coordination 
bonds. 
7. Interaction of polyampholytes with ionic surfactants leads to the formation 
of compact particles (or precipitates) stabilized by hydrophobic contacts of 
the long alkyl chain of detergents. The compact polyampholyte–surfactant 
complexes are preserved in aqueous solution with the help of noncomplex￾ing (free) monomeric units of copolymers. The formation of intramolecular 
micelle structure and the drastic reduction of surface tension is specifc for 
polyampholyte–surfactant systems. 
8. The penetration of surfactants inside amphoteric hydrogel volume can lead 
to the formation of micelles within hydrogel matrix and hydrophobization 
of the whole system and overall shrinking of hydrogel volume. 
9. Binding of dye molecules by polyampholytes is accompanied by the accu￾mulation of dye molecules within the hydrophobic region of macromolecu￾lar complex. 
4.7 ISOELECTRIC EFFECT 
At the IEP, the compact globule structure is formed via squeezing out the solvent 
due to strong electrostatic attraction forces between oppositely charged groups. The 
isoelectric effect taking place at the IEP was frst marked by authors [139–141] and 
afterward confrmed by several researchers [142–145]. Moreover, it can be stated 
that some low- or high-molecular-weight substances associated with polyampholytes 
can potentially be released at the IEP as a result of a competition between inter￾and intramolecular interactions, accompanied by macromolecular charge inversion. 
In other words, if intrachain interaction of acidic and basic groups within a single 
macromolecule predominates the preceding, releasing phenomena can be realized 
via overcoming interchain interaction between substance and polyampholytes. The 
realization of the “isoelectric effect” for a series of water-soluble polyampholytes Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 153 
was demonstrated for metal ions [146], dye molecules [147], polyelectrolytes, and 
proteins [54, 148]. 
The existence of “isoelectric effect” for the frst time was clearly shown for sys￾tems consisting of polyampholyte-based 2,5-dimethyl-4-vinylethynylpiperidinol-4 
and acrylic acid (DMVEP-AA) and anionic or cationic polyelectrolytes [3, 54]. 
The composition of inter-PEC determined from extremums of the potentiometric, 
conductimetric, and turbidimetric curves is equal to [polyampholyte]:[polyelectro￾lyte] = 3:1. Figure 4.13 shows the pH dependence of the reduced viscosity for the 
individual components and inter-PEC. 
Phase separation of products composed of DMVEP-AA and PAA occurs at 3.0< pH 
<5.5; for a mixture of DMVEP-AA and PDMDAAC, this process takes place at pH >8.2. 
Near the IEP of DMVEP-AA (pHiep = 7.0), the reduced viscosity of associates sharply 
increases. This is due to the destruction of polycomplex particles into individual com￾ponents. A cooperative destruction of polycomplex particles near the IEP is directly 
confrmed by an independent sedimentation experiment. Figure 4.14 shows the sedi￾mentation diagrams of DMVEP-AA, PAA, and polycomplexes at various pH. 
The sedimentograms of the polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte complex shows one 
peak with sedimentation coeffcient S = 4.75 and 4. 18 at pH = 6.1 and 6.9, respec￾tively. However, at pH = 7.1, two peaks with S = 1.9 (“slow peak”) and 5.6 (“fast 
peak”) appear on sedimentograms. At the same time, the sedimentation coeffcients 
of individual PAA and DMVEP-AA at pH = 7.1 are equal to 1.06 and 3.53, respec￾tively. Thus, the appearance of slow and fast sedimentation peaks at narrow interval 
of pH (ΔpH = 0.2) changing is the result of inter-PEC destruction into the individ￾ual macromolecules. The structure of inter-PEC composed of polyampholyte and

(curve 4), and 7.1 (curves 1, 2, 5).

polyelectrolyte can be represented as double-stranded sequences of pairs formed 
with the help of cooperative systems of ionic and hydrogen bonds [31]. Probably 
near the IEP, some acidic and basic groups of polyampholytes displaced on loops 
begin to interact with each other cooperatively with the formation of intra-PEC. Fig￾ure 4.15 represents the proposed mechanism of destruction of polyampholyte–poly￾electrolyte associates near the IEP. 
The dependence of inter-PEC yield on pH can also serve as additional confr￾mation of the validity of the proposed mechanism [143]. The yield of inter-PEC 
composed of polyampholyte-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PA-NaPSS) and polyam￾pholyte-poly(N,N-dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PA-PDMDAAC) is close to 
zero at the IEP of polyampholyte. 
The “isoelectric effect” can successfully be used in matrix polyreactions [3, 149]. 
Figure 4.16 illustrates the synthesis of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) on the acidic matrix 
of block polyampholyte, followed by the release of “daughter” chain at the IEP of 
block polyampholyte. Application of block polyampholyte as polymerization matrix 
has the following advantages in comparison with polyacids and polybases alone: 
(1) each block (anionic or cationic) can serve as a polymerization matrix; (2) the 
product of matrix polymerization is water-soluble and preserved from the precip￾itation due to free (non-loaded) acidic or basic blocks; (3) the “daughter” chain 
can easily be separated from the matrix as a result of competition between inter￾and intramacromolecular complexation; (4) molecular weight of products can be Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 155

polyampholyte.

regulated by the length of polymer matrix; and (5) block polyampholyte can be used 
for matrix polyreactions several times.
The method of protein separation by water-soluble polyampholytes is selective 
complexation of polyampholyte with one of the proteins which has predominating 
positive or negative charge [52, 53, 57–59]. Upon the addition of polyampholyte 
to the mixture of proteins, one of the proteins forms a complex with the polyam￾pholyte and precipitates, while the other remains in the supernatant phase [139]. 
The resulting protein–polyampholyte precipitate can be removed from the system 
and redissolved at a different pH or, else, can be destructed at the IEP, where the full 
precipitation of polyampholyte itself takes place [140].
The unique separation of protein mixture was performed at the IEP of block poly￾ampholytes [3]. In both cases, the protein release process occurs at the IEP of poly￾ampholyte due to the formation of intraionic polyelectrolyte complexes (intra-PEC).
Quite interesting, “isoelectric effect” was observed for complexes of polyam￾pholyte dendrimers with highly swelling sodium poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpro￾panesufonate) (AMPSNa) and PDMDAAC used as polyelectrolyte networks [43]. 
At the IEP of polyampholyte dendrimer, the relative weight of inter-PEC samples 
m/m0 (where m is the equilibrium weight of the product of completed sorption at a 
given pH of the equilibrium solution, m0 the weight of initial equilibrium swollen 156 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
FIGURE 4.16 Realization of the isoelectric effect in synthesis of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) 
on block polyampholyte matrix.

gel in water) increases signifcantly due to the destruction of inter-PEC and release 
of polyampholyte dendrimer to the outer solution from the polyelectrolyte network 
(Figure 4.17). 
If such a sample is washed with distilled water, its relative weight becomes close 
to unity. Thus, at the IEP of polyampholyte dendrimer, the detachment of amphoteric 
macromolecules from the gel matrix of polyelectrolytes takes place. This statement 
is very important because the “isoelectric effect” can be realized not only for linear 
polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte complexes but also for water-soluble dendrimeric 
polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte gels. The mechanism of release of polyelectrolytes 
or polyampholytes can be explained by the competition between intra-PEC and inter￾PEC formation. The polyampholyte dendrimer can pass from the inter-PEC contain￾ing the anionic gel to a new inter-PEC formed by the cationic gel, and vice versa, 
with fne-tuning of pH near the IEP. 
The feasibility of the “isoelectric effect” was tested for crosslinked amphoteric 
macroporous cryogels based on N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate and meth￾acrylic acid (DMAEM-MAA) with respect to surfactant, that is, sodium dodecylben￾zene sulfonate (SDBS); dyes, that is, methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO); 
and protein, that is, lysozyme [63]. It was found that the release of dye molecules, 
surfactant, and protein at the IEP of amphoteric cryogel (pHIEP = 7.1) reaches up to 
98%. The release mechanism of low and high molecular compounds at the IEP of 
amphoteric cryogel is explained by Figure 4.18. 
At the IEP of amphoteric cryogel, the cooperativity of intrachain interactions between 
the acidic and basic groups (formation of inner salt) within a cryogel matrix predomi￾nates those of interchain interactions between cryogel and protein (surfactant and dye Macromolecular Complexes of Polyampholytes 157

molecules). As a result, at the IEP of amphoteric cryogel (pHIEP = 7.1), the lysozyme, 
MB, MO, and SDBS are released from the cryogel matrix to the outer solution. 
Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNP) coated by three different annealed 
polyampholytes—poly(2-(imidazol-1-yl)acrylic acid) (PImAA), poly(dehydroala￾nine) (PDha), and poly(N,N-diallylglutamate) (PDAGA)—were used for reversi￾ble adsorption/desorption the polyelectrolytes (PDMAEM, PSSNa), BSA [150], 
and dye molecules [151, 152]. The polyzwitterionic character of used polyam￾pholytes allows the adjustment of surface charges by regulating the pH and pro￾vides the adsorption of both positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes 
(Figure 4.19). 
In all cases, desorption required changes in pH and occurred close to the apparent 
isoelectric point. The selective desorption of PDMAEM and PSSNa was utilized 
upon inversion of surface charges of PDha at the IEP (Figure 4.20). 
The reversibility of the adsorption/desorption process by performing nine con￾secutive cycles was demonstrated. Thus, the polyampholytes are interesting candi￾dates for applications where controlled binding or release is in focus and where it is 
important to control which part of a segmented system responds to changes in the 158 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

surrounding medium. pH-responsive amphoteric particle with an average size ca. 
200 nm prepared by interfacial polymerization in w/o miniemulsion also showed the 
ability to trap and release repeatedly the fuorescently labeled single-stranded DNA 
(ssDNA) when the surface charge of polyampholyte was inversed from the positive 
to negative passing the IEP (pH 8.7) [153]. The ssDNA adsorbed on the amphoteric 
particle at pH 7.0 < pHIEP 8.7 and desorbed at pH 11.0 > pHIEP 8.7. The three times 
trap-and-release experiments show that the polyampholyte particle has a reusable 
ability. The application of the isoelectric effect was demonstrated for release of urea 
from the matrix of starch-based polyampholyte/urea membrane at the IEP corre￾sponding to pH 5.0 [154]. 
Layer-by-layer (LbL) thin flms were prepared using an amphoteric copolymer 
consisting of alternating diallylamine and maleic acid monomer units (PDAMA) and 
anionic polyelectrolyte, poly(styrenesulfonate) PSS, on the one hand and cationic 
polyelectrolyte, poly(N-ethyl-4-vinylpyridine) (PEVP), on the other hand [155]. 
pH-induced decomposition of the flms was realized when the surface charge of pol￾yampholyte was inversed. LbL deposition of PSS and PDAMA on a solid surface 
afforded thin flms at pH 3.0, while thin flms did not form at pH 8.0. In contrast, 
PDAMA-PEVP flms were constructed by LbL deposition of PDAMA and PEVP 
at pH 8.0, though flms could not be obtained at pH 3.0. PSS–PDAMA flms were 
stable at pH 3.0–4.0 in a 150 mM NaCl solution and decomposed upon immersion in 
solutions with pH 4.3 or higher as a result of the reversal of the net PDAMA charge

from positive to negative. In contrast, PDAMA–PEVP flms disintegrated at pH 4.0 
or lower. Thus, PDAMA-containing LbL flms were found to be dual pH-sensitive: 
the flms can be decomposed at acidic or neutral pH, depending on the type of coun￾terpolymer in the flm. PSS–PDAMA and PDAMA–PEVP flms were also sensitive 
to salt concentration, where a higher concentration of NaCl in the solution in which 
the flms were immersed facilitated decomposition of the flms. The effect of salt 
concentration was attributed to partial breakage of the ion pairing between PDAMA 
and the counter-polymers as a result of competitive binding with Na+ and Cl− ions.

5 Polyampholytes 
in Biotechnology 
and Medicine 
5.1 POLYAMPHOLYTES AS PROTEIN AND 
DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS 
Polyampholytes, including polybetaines and zwitterionic polymers (or polyzwitter￾ions), have been extensively studied and used in a wide range of biomedical appli￾cations, including biosensors, medical devices, cell encapsulations, drug delivery 
system (DDS), protein modifcations, etc. [1]. The basics of zwitterionic materials, 
in particular, their synthesis and solution behavior, surface hydration, and interaction 
with biomolecules, were highlighted in review articles [2–4]. Signifcant progress 
has been achieved in applications of polyzwitterions possessing different architec￾ture, such as micelle, liposomes, protein conjugates, hydrogels, nanogels, and nano￾particles, to the delivery of protein or drug at the specifc site [5]. Polyzwitterions are 
being extensively explored for their suitability in a range of biomedical devices and 
other related applications due to good biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity and biofoul￾ing, negligible immunogenicity, systematic stability, long circulation time, as well 
as their ability to avoid quick recognition by the immune system, and delayed blood 
clearance from the body makes them an ideal contender for biomedical applications. 
Amphoteric hydrogels, due to high toughness, excellent bio- and hemocompatibil￾ity, anti-biofouling, self-healing, cytotoxic, and adhesive properties in physiological 
conditions, are advanced in the forefront of perspective structural biomaterials, such 
as cartilage, antithrombogenic implants, wound dressing and blood-contacting mate￾rials, and DDS [5–9]. Many research groups have made a remarkable contribution to 
the development of self-healing, artifcial tissue-mimetic, and mechanically robust 
materials based on polyampholyte hydrogels [10–18]. Recent advances in injectable 
hydrogels for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications were reviewed in 
[19]. The bending fexibility, high strengths, and moduli of the “quenched” poly￾ampholyte hydrogels consisting of equimolar amount of strong charged anionic and 
cationic monomers are similar to soft tissues of vasculature, skin, or muscle and can 
be used as tissue-replacing biomaterials [20]. 
NIPAM-based polyampholyte hydrogels consisting of acrylic acid and N￾vinylimidazole monomeric units with co-immobilized glucose oxidase and urease 
were designed by Kokufuta et al. [21] to develop a biochemomechanical system, for 
example, to convert biochemical energy to mechanical work (swelling–shrinking) 
as a biocatalyst (regulation of reaction kinetics) in a chemical conversion. Ampho￾teric nano- and microgels, membranes, and thin flms are promising platforms Polyampholytes in Biotechnology and Medicine 171 
in biotechnology and medicine for the development of protein and DDS [22, 23]. 
Uptake of cytochrome C by polyampholyte microgels possessing random and 
“core–shell” microstructures was carried out at pH 8, followed by the release of 
model protein at pH 3.0 and 6.0 [24]. pH-sensitive polyampholytes of poly(acrylic 
acid-co-vinylamine) (P(AA-co-VAm)) were developed as injectable microgels for 
controlled drug release [25]. Doxorubicin-loaded polyampholyte microgels effec￾tively release the drug (up to 95%) at pH 6.0 in 84 h. The drug delivery system from 
nonfouling polyampholyte hydrogels composed of equimolar amounts of [2-(acry￾loyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (TMA), 2-carboxyethylacrylate (CAA), 
and triethyeleglycoldimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as crosslinker was obtained in the 
presence of positively charged methylene blue (MB), negatively charged metanil 
yellow (MY) and neutral caffeine (C) [26]. The drug release kinetics from hydrogel 
matrix to outer solution was studied as a function of crosslinking degree, pH of the 
solution, and salt concentration. Loading of MB, MY, and C to and releasing from 
copolymers of N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid (DMAEM-co￾AA) were studied for pH-responsive polyampholytes grafted to poly(2-hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate) (PHEMA) [27] and PVDF membranes [28]. At pH 5.0 and 7.0, the 
maximum caffeine release from PVDF-modifed membrane was reached after 3 and 
5 h, respectively; however, after 24 h, the released amount of caffeine was in the 
same level. In case of PHEMA-loaded drugs, only MB- and caffeine-incorporated 
membranes displayed clear pH-responsive release through all coatings. 
The recent progress of nonfouling, biocompatible, and bioinert zwitterionic drug 
carriers derived from phosphorylcholine- (PC), carboxybetaine- (CB), and sul￾fobetaine (SB)–containing copolymers were discussed in review [29]. Novel Red/ 
Ox-sensitive zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine)–based nanogels (<100 nm) loaded by 
anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) were tested in conditions of in vitro drug release 
[30]. A series of biodegradable and pH-responsive vesicles (~100 nm) of block copol￾ymers of poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)50-block-poly(L-aspartic 
acid)n (P(MPC)50-b-p(AA)n (n = 10, 25, 50, 75) were exploited as dual-responsive 
drug delivery vehicles of DOX [31]. Poly(sulfobetaine)-grafted mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles (MSN@pSBMA) with enhanced lubrication and sustained drug release 
behaviors were developed for the treatment of osteoarthrites [32]. Authors in [33] 
fabricated a novel enzymatic degradable polyester-based zwitterionic polymer and 
the corresponding polymer–paclitaxel anticancer drug conjugate, which exhibited 
acid-sensitive drug release for killing of cancer cells. A series of zwitterionic poly￾mer membranes coated onto magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles was developed to satisfy 
longtime blood circulation for enhanced photothermal tumor therapy (PTT) [34]. 
Amphoteric diblock copolymers exhibit a stabilization effect with respect to 
DNA and can serve as a synthetic vector for gene delivery [35]. Fluoroalkylated 
end-capped polycarbobetaines were found [36] to exhibit high antibacterial activ￾ity against Staphylococcus aureus or Penicillium aeruginosa. The surface of sin￾gle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) modifed by alternating polyampholyte and 
containing DOX was used as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery [37]. These 
hybrids showed pH-responsive drug release with a burst release at pH 5.5, while the 
release behavior remained stable at pH 7.4. The cell viability and cytotoxicity toward  
172 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
cancer HeLa cells indicated high effciency in anticancer drug delivery. A zwitteri￾onic polymer (or polyzwitterion) containing quaternary ammonium cation and sulfo￾namide anion coated by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) showed antifouling ability, low 
cellular uptake, prolonged circulation time, and pH-responsive antitumor activity— 
promising application in nanomedicine [38]. 
Poly(methacrylic acid-co-(3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride) 
p(MAA-co-APTMACl) and poly(methacrylic acid-co-(2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl)tri￾methylammonium chloride) p(MAA-co-AETAC) amphoteric hydrogels were used 
as a drug carrier cargo material for the treatment of two different diseases [39]. For 
this, two of the selected model drugs were loaded simultaneously on hydrogels, and 
their release properties were examined. Rhodamin 6G and ceftriaxone sodium were 
loaded to poly(MAA-co-APTMACl) hydrogel, while Rhodamin 6G and sulfadiazine 
were loaded simultaneously on the poly(MAA-co-AETAC) hydrogel. In addition, 
antibacterial activities of poly(MAA-co-APTMACl) and poly(MAA-co-AETAC) 
hydrogels against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and  Pseudomonas 
Aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus Aureus and Bacillus Subti￾lis) were investigated. 
Tissue-engineered scaffolds are currently being explored to aid in healing and 
regeneration of non-union fractures in bone. Calcium-modifed bioactive bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) from a multifunctional polyampholyte polymer scaffold 
demonstrated the ability to provide benefts to healing when applied to injury sites 
[40]. First, the inherent nonfouling and conjugation properties of the polyampholyte 
hydrogel were verifed to determine the impact of calcium exposure. The polyam￾pholyte hydrogel delivery platform was then assessed with calcium titrations and 
osteoblast-like cell (MC3T3-E1) adhesion, proliferation, and viability evaluations. 
Finally, integrin inhibitors were used to identify the binding mechanisms that medi￾ate cell adhesion to the calcium-modifed, BSA-conjugated hydrogels. An increase 
in cell adhesion was observed following calcium exposure up to 0.075M, although 
this and higher calcium concentrations affected hydrogel stability and cell growth. 
BSA exposed to 0.05 M calcium and delivered from polyampholyte hydrogels pro￾moted the most promising viable cell adhesion over seven days. Cell adhesion to 
the calcium-modifed BSA-conjugated hydrogels appeared to be regulated by argi￾nine-glycine-aspartic acid and collagen-specifc integrins. These results demonstrate 
that the delivery of calcium-modifed BSA from an implantable polymer scaffold is 
promising for bone tissue engineering applications. 
5.2 MUCOADHESIVE PROPERTIES OF NATURAL 
AND SYNTHETIC POLYAMPHOLYTES 
The inclusion of functional polymers in dosage forms leads to prolongation of the 
action of active pharmaceutical ingredients on the mucous surface and increases the 
effectiveness of antibiotic therapy [41, 42]. Mucoadhesion is a special case of bioad￾hesion, implying the ability of certain materials to adhere to the surface of mucous 
tissues in the human or animal body. Mucoadhesive polymers, due to the presence 
of hydroxyl, carboxyl, amine, and sulfate groups, are capable of forming hydro￾gen bonds, of electrostatic interactions, and have high molecular weights, chain Polyampholytes in Biotechnology and Medicine 173 
fexibility, and surface energies. Bioadhesion is dependent on the intrinsic properties 
of the adhesive polymer and environmental conditions in which the adhesion occurs. 
According to the classifcation [43], there are several mechanisms of mucoad￾hesion: adsorption, diffusion, dehydration, electrostatic interaction, mechanical 
entrapment, and humidifcation. Adsorption is carried out through hydrogen and/or 
covalent disulfde bonds with mucosa, dipole bonds with negatively charged mucin, 
and hydrophobic interactions. The dehydration mechanism consists in the adsorption 
of water from the mucosal surface during polymer swelling and gelation. Electro￾static interaction implies the formation of an electrical double layer between a poly￾mer (for example, a polyelectrolyte) and mucin, and the diffusion mechanism means 
the intertwining of the polymer chain and mucin proteins. Mechanical entrapment is 
the holding of a polymer on a nonuniform surface, such as a hairline. The wetting 
mechanism refers to the value of the contact angle of the fuid at the mucosal surface. 
With mucoadhesion, these mechanisms can occur both individually and in various 
combinations. 
Mucoadhesive polymers can be conditionally divided into three types: natural, 
semisynthetic, and synthetic [44, 45]. Depending on the nature of the functional 
groups, mucoadhesive polymers are subdivided into anionic, cationic, nonionic, and 
amphoteric [46]. An example of an anionic mucoadhesive polymer is the weakly 
crosslinked polyacrylic acid that is known commercially as Carbopol; the natural 
polysaccharides gellan and chitosan are widely known anionic and cationic pol￾ymers; the category of nonionic polymers includes polyethylene glycol, polyeth￾ylene oxide, poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, and polyvinyl alcohol. 
However, nonionic polymers have not found wide practical application due to weak 
mucoadhesion. There are only episodic studies for the mucoadhesive properties of 
polyampholytes, although amphoteric macromolecules may well act as excellent 
mucoadhesive objects due to the presence of acid–base and cationic–anionic groups 
[47, 48]. A  combination of positive and negative charges in the macromolecular 
chain of polyampholytes [49] can expand the variety of immobilized drugs and fnely 
regulate their yield, depending on the pH of the medium and the salt composition of 
the mucosal fuid. 
The mucoadhesion process can be divided into different steps [50] (Figure 5.1). 
A recent review article of the author in [51] attempts to present relatively new 
aspects of mucoadhesion and related phenomena that emerged from the contempo￾rary understanding of the importance of how the various multifunctional properties 
of mucus layers, such as superior lubrication, selective and tunable adhesion, selec￾tive fltration, and self-hydration, are used biologically as superior defense systems, 
particularly in mammals. Design and fabrication of functional mucoadhesive hydro￾gels and mucoadhesive nanoparticle systems are among the newest and highly pop￾ular relatively early-stage research felds in mucoadhesion. 
Most of the natural polymers are mucoadhesive, which makes them interesting 
candidates for the development of multiple mucoadhesive dosage forms, such as 
hydrogels, tablets, microparticles, and flms, which have demonstrated extraordinary 
potential to administer drugs by the ocular, nasal, buccal, oral, and vaginal routes, 
improving both local and systemic treatments [52, 53]. Among the natural polyam￾pholytes, gelatin itself [54, 55], modifed gelatin [56], and interpolymer complexes of 174 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
FIGURE 5.1 Diagram of the mucoadhesion stages. Stage I is the contacting of mucoadhesive 
polymer with the mucous medium. Stage II is the interpenetrating of the polymer chains with 
the mucosal surface. Stage III is the formation of physical (for instance, electrostatic forces, 
hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces) or covalent (disulfde) bonds 
between the entangled polymer chains and the mucosal surface.

gelatin [57–60] are widely used as mucoadhesive formulations due to a strong adhe￾sive contact with mucosa, allowing to increase residence time of delivery systems 
and to optimize drug bioavailability. Chitosan/gelatin flms and tablets in the form 
of microparticles are able to easily administer propranolol hydrochloride by buccal 
route, allowing suitable drug permeation [57, 58]. Propranolol hydrochloride is used 
clinically for hypertension, angina, postinfarction, sinus tachycardia, arrhythmias, 
and obstructive cardiomyopathy. The selection of the appropriate chitosan/gelatin 
ratio and polymer concentration in the flm, as well as the addition of mannitol, sup￾ports the goal of ensuring the necessary dose for treatment of hypertension and atrial 
fbrillation. Mucoadhesive buccal tablets with an excess of chitosan showed the best 
mucoadhesive properties, allowed the permeation of the greatest drug amount among 
all formulations, and could be promising for buccal administration of propranolol 
hydrochloride. The hydrogels of gelatin and iota–carrageenan with ciprofoxacin 
incorporated within the network were found to be highly hemocompatible with high 
mucoadhesive and swelling behavior [59]. It was observed that the concentration of 
iota–carrageenan and gelatin has a prominent role in the mucoadhesive properties 
of the prepared hydrogel formulations. While gelatin is amphoteric in nature, iota– 
carrageenan is highly anionic due to the presence of half-ester sulfate groups; thus, it 
can be stated that gelatin has more adhesive properties due to the presence of amine, 
carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups that have the capability to interact with mucin. The 
combination of carrageenan and gelatin in different ratios proved to be useful in 
modulating the ophthalmic delivery of drug release profle and the rheological and Polyampholytes in Biotechnology and Medicine 175 
mucoadhesive properties [61]. It was shown that the mucoadhesivity of the carra￾geenan–gelatin mixture is proportional to the amount of gelatin. Both flms and a 
microsphere formulation were prepared and tested in vivo using albino rabbits. In 
vitro results show that by changing the carrageenan–gelatin ratio in the formulation, 
it is possible to regulate the amount of drug release. Drug concentration and bioavail￾ability were signifcantly high in comparison with commercial formulations. 
The behavior of biopolymer flms derived from chitosan, gelatin, and chitosan/ 
gelatin mixture in salt solutions with varying concentrations and ion charges was 
reported [60]. The swelling and dissolution of the chitosan flms were reduced with 
increasing salt concentration due to the polyelectrolyte behavior of this biopolymer, 
while the gelatin flms displayed a polyampholyte behavior, in which flm swelling 
and dissolution were enhanced in salt solutions (Figure 5.2). 
Composite chitosan/gelatin flms followed the behavior of gelatin. The release of 
small ionic and zwitterionic molecules from the flms was enhanced in ionic solu￾tions due to the screened attraction between these molecules and the polymer matrix. 
The effect of varying ionic strength of the solution on the release of small-charged 
molecules, such as rhodamine B and eosin Y, from the chitosan/gelatin flms was 
explored. These results provide an insight into the behavior of protein/polysaccha￾ride flms in varying ionic environments, enabling enhanced design of mucoadhesive 
biomaterials as tissue adhesives [62].

+ groups of 
chitosan (polyelectrolyte) and the attraction between COO− and NH3
+ groups of gelatin 
(polyampholyte) are screened with increasing ionic strength, thus resulting in contraction 
and expansion of the polymer network, respectively.

The mucoadhesivity of linear and crosslinked polyampholytes with respect to por￾cine gastric mucin was studied for the frst time [63, 64]. Two amphoteric polymers 
were synthesized by reaction of linear polyethyleneimine (L-PEI) with succinic or 
phthalic anhydride, and their mucoadhesive properties at different pHs were com￾pared to bovine serum albumin (BSA), selected as a natural polyampholyte [63] 
(Figure 5.3). 
It was established that the pH of the solution plays a major role in determin￾ing the extent of mucoadhesive interactions and the ability of these materials to 
adhere to mucosal tissue. When the solution pH < pHIEP polyampholytes exhib￾its strong attractive interactions with mucin and very good mucoadhesive ability 
toward mucosal tissues, but when the solution pH is around or above the pHIEP, 
the polyampholytes exhibit modest mucoadhesive properties. In case of croslinked 
polyampholytes [64], the critical composition of polyampholyte that is favorable for 
maximal mucoadhesivity was found. Thus, the mucoadhesive properties of synthetic 
polyampholytes that are determined by the critical composition of polyampholytes 
and pH values can be extended to most natural polyampholytes. The mucoadhesive

properties of gelatin were improved by reacting it with crotonic, itaconic, and meth￾acrylic anhydrides to yield crotonoylated-, itaconoylated-, and methacryloylated 
gelatins (Figure 5.4) [56]. 
Modifed with unsaturated anhydride, gelatins exhibited superior mucoadhesive 
properties compared to native gelatin. The enhanced ability of gelatin modifed with 
these unsaturated functional groups is due to the formation of covalent bonds with 
cysteine-rich subdomains present in the mucin via thiol–ene click Michael-type 
addition reactions occurring under physiologically relevant conditions. 
Thus, a combination of positive and negative charges in the macromolecular 
chain of chemically modifed derivatives of proteins [56] and polysaccharides [49], 
protein–polysaccharide complexes [57–61], interpolymer complexes of synthetic, 
natural and semi-natural polyampholytes [65] can cause a dramatic improvement 
in the polymer’s mucoadhesive and cohesive properties [46], expand the variety 
of immobilized drugs, and fnely regulate their yield, depending on the pH of the 
medium and the salt composition of the mucosal fuid. Design and fabrication of 
functional mucoadhesive hydrogels and mucoadhesive nanoparticle systems are 
among the newest and highly popular relatively early-stage research felds in 
mucoadhesion [51]. As for expanding the range of mucoadhesive polymers, in our 
opinion, attention should also be paid to homo- and copolypeptides of ampholytic 
nature, which are the closest analogues of proteins and have recently found wide 
application as carriers of drugs [66–68].

5.3 AMPHOTERIC HYDROGELS AS PERSPECTIVE 
STRUCTURAL BIOMATERIALS 
The research group of Gong et al. [6,7 13–18] made a remarkable contribution to 
the development of self-healing, artifcial tissue-mimetic and mechanically robust 
materials based on polyampholyte hydrogels for biomedical applications. Recent 
advances in injectable hydrogels for drug delivery and tissue engineering applica￾tions were reviewed in [19, 69]. 
The bending fexibility, high strengths, and moduli of the quenched polyam￾pholyte hydrogels consisting of equimolar amount of strong charged anionic and 
cationic monomers are similar to soft tissues of vasculature, skin, or muscle and 
can be used as tissue-replacing biomaterials [14, 18, 20]. Figure 5.5 compares the 
mechanical properties of polyampholyte hydrogels that can more or less satisfy some 
requirements of biomaterials.

These data reveal that the mechanical properties of hydrogels derived from inter￾penetrating and dual-crosslinked networks, macromolecular crosslinking, nanocom￾posite, thermally conditioned, polyion complexes, and polyampholyte hydrogels 
reinforced by glass fbers are several orders higher than pristine polyampholyte 
hydrogels. This fact inspires the design of artifcial ligament that can replace the 
natural one. In case of reinforced by glass fber polyampholyte hydrogels the driving 
force of synergistic combination is that the glass fbers play the role of stiff, load 
bearing, anisotropic matrix while the tough polyampholyte hydrogel acts as extra￾cellular matrix. Namely, the combination of glass fber woven matter and charge 
balanced polyampholyte that deswells in water is responsible for strong mechanical 
properties. Dialysis of counterions and co-ions from polyampholyte gel interior to 
outer environment enhances the adhesion between the gel and the fbers. The highly 
charged polyampholyte chains after dialyzation in deionized water are collapsed or 
“zipped”. In this context, the term “zipped” means multiple cationic/anionic junction 
zones of polyampholytes with the fnite-sized bundles. Microscopic cellular structure 
of polyampholyte hydrogels in “zipped” form with a pore size ~ 20 µm after dialysis 
was directly visualized by feld-emission SEM (FE-SEM) and scanning transmission 
electron microscopy (STEM) [70]. The crucial role of dialysis is that the “zipping” 
of the polyampholyte chains results in formation of a tough hydrogel that favors the 
sticking of hydrogel to fbers. 
A series of strong, tough, and adhesive hydrogels fabricated from sodium p￾styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and 3-(methacryloylamino)propyl-trimethylammonium 
chloride (MAPTAC), poly(NaSS-co-MAPTAC gel were reinforced by nonwoven 
cellulose-based fber fabric (CF) [71]. The effect of CF content on the mechanical 
and adhesion properties of composite gels was systematically studied. The opti￾mized composite gel possesses 35.2 MPa of Young’s modulus (E), 4.3 MPa of ten￾sile strength (σb), 8.1 kJ·m−2 of tearing energy (T), 943 kPa of self-adhesive strength, 
and 1.4 kJ·m−2 of self-adhesive energy, which is 22.1, 2.3, 1.8, 6.0, and 4.2 times 
those of the gel matrix, respectively. This work opens a simple and effective path￾way to achieve soft and wet biomaterials with high strength, high toughness, and 
good adhesion. 
Composite hydrogels with strongly charged ampholytic nature were prepared by 
photo-polymerization of the acrylate groups in acrylamide (AA), [2-(acryloyloxy) 
ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (AETA) and N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide - (MBAA) in the presence of sulfonate-modifed silica nanoparticles [(SiO2)n−SO3 
Na+] [8]. Coulombic interactions between the cationic ammonium side groups along 
the hydrogel backbone and the anionic sulfonate groups of nanoparticles reinforce 
the mechanical properties of composite hydrogels and simultaneously improve in 
tensile modulus, toughness and strain at break compared to neat AA and AETA. A 
priori we can suggest that such system will behave polyampholyte character simi￾lar to remarkable works of Gong [13, 14]. Strong and tough polyampholyte hydro￾gels via the synergy of ionic and metal–ligand bonds were developed [72, 73]. By 
selecting different original polyampholyte gel systems and diverse multivalent met￾al-ions, the proposed approach is proved to be generalizable to fabricate strong and 
tough gels. The viscoelastic and elastic contributions to the mechanical properties 
of the hydrogels by a viscoelastic model are also discussed to further understand the 180 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
strengthening and toughening mechanisms. Methodology of 3D printing of highly 
elastic, transparent and conductive composite polyampholyte hydrogels is per￾spective to model some human organs and serve as artifcial tissue, soft actuators, 
soft robotics. 
5.4 ANTIFOULING AND HEMOCOMPATIBLE POLYAMPHOLYTES 
Biofouling caused by nonspecifc adsorption of biomolecules and organisms such as 
proteins, cells, and bacteria to material surfaces is a signifcant challenge for numer￾ous important applications [74]. The prevention of bioflm formation on medical 
devices has become highly challenging in recent years due to its resistance to bac￾tericidal agents and antibiotics, ultimately resulting in chronic infections to medi￾cal devices [75]. Bacterial infection of medical devices causes incalculable losses 
to maintenance costs and health care. A single coating with antibacterial function 
cannot guarantee the long-term use of the device, because the coating will be dam￾aged and fall off during reuse. To solve this problem, the development of coatings 
with high adhesion and self-healing ability is a wise direction [76]. A major chal￾lenge in synthetic polyampholytes is prevention of nonspecifc protein adsorption, 
e.g. antifouling behavior due to formation of a nanometer-scale surface containing 
charged balanced groups from either polybetaines (zwitterionic) or quenched poly￾ampholytes that are strongly hydrated through ionic solvation [77–79]. Due to high 
charge density, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, protein- and cell repellent proper￾ties, antithrombogenic and antipolyelectrolyte behavior in saline media polyzwit￾terions attract increased interest in the context of biomedical applications [80, 81]. 
Zwitterion-decorated surfaces can exhibit high resistance against bacteria fouling, 
achieving a 98.5% reduction in bacterial attachment [82]. For biomedical appli￾cations, the surface of preliminary activated parent materials is covalently coated 
by polyzwitterions as monolayers, brushes [83–85] or networks [86] (Figure 5.6).

Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society.) Polyampholytes in Biotechnology and Medicine 181 
The commonly used surface modifcator is zwitterionic 2-methacryloyloxyethyl 
phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymers that reduce the nonspeaifc fouling by biomol￾ecules and cells [87]. In medical practice, several clinically devices such as guide￾wires, stents, oxygenators, left ventricular assist devices, and microcatheters are 
usually treated using MPC polymers. 
The different arrangement of anionic and cationic moieties in polysulfobetaines 
was demonstrated in Figure 1.7 of Subchapter 1.3. The biological effects of poly￾zwitterionic hydrogel flms of about 100 nm thickness prepared from A, C, D, 
and E were evaluated with respect to model proteins (BSA, lysozyme, fbrinogen) 
and marine organisms (diatoms Navicula Perminuta, barnacle cyprids Balanus 
improvisus). The protein-repellent ability of polyzwitterions increases in the fol￾lowing order: fbrinogen > BSA > lysozyme. Fouling resistance of polyzwitterions 
increases in the order C ≥ A > B, showing the stronger antifouling effciency of C 
for BSA and fbrinogen. The main conclusions of authors in [86] are that among 
the tested polyzwitterions, there is no universal (or champion) antifouling agents, 
and the relative antifouling performance depends on the precise combination of 
the foulant species and employed polyzwitterions. The relationship between the 
structure and antifouling potential coatings was systematically studied for a series 
of poly(sulfabetaine methacrylate)s [88]. In particular, the effects of the spacer 
groups, either separating the zwitterionic units from the polymer backbone or the 
cationic from the anionic charges, are explored, studying the resistance against 
non-specifc protein adsorption and the accumulation of single species of marine 
biofouling organisms. 
The “nonfouling” behavior of polyzwitterions was interpreted by Schlenoff [89, 
90] as the following: (1) polyzwitterions are so strongly hydrated (low interfacial 
energy with water) and do not disturb the hydrogen bond network of water; (2) 
strongly swollen polymer chains of polyzwitterions are confgurationally unfavora￾ble to accommodate large guest biomolecules; (3) there are no suffciently strong 
enthalpic or entropic contributions that would favor adhesion of proteins, bacteria, or 
cells to polyzwitterions. 
Antifouling, anti-biofouling, and antibacterial properties exhibit polyvinilydene 
fuoride (PVDF) [91, 92], polyethersulfone (PES) [93, 94], or polyamide (PA) [95] 
ultrafltration (UF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes modifed or coated by 
polyampholytes [96] and zwitterionic sulfobetaine silane coatings [97] deposited 
on glass substrate (Table 5.1). Novel self-assembled zwitterionic membranes with 
tunable selectivity, subnanometer nanochannels, and unmatched fouling resistance 
were developed by a new and scalable crosslinking approach that controls the aque￾ous swelling of the nanopores [98]. Highly crosslinked membranes demonstrated 
excellent retention of divalent ions and an effective pore size ≈ 0.9 nm, smaller than 
that of any other self-assembled membranes. They achieved (NaCl/Na2SO4) = 101 
for single-salt solutions and (Cl−/SO4
2−) = 75 for artifcial seawater, outperforming 
state-of-the-art membrane technologies. They also completely resisted irreversible 
fouling by two critical foulant families, promising reliable operation even with 
high-fouling feeds. The potential use of such membranes is sulfate removal from 
seawater, water softening, ion separation, and removal of micropollutants from 
drinking water. 182 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

Synthetic polyampholytes were used for the construction of biomimetic scaffolds 
to study the impact of biochemical and physical cues on cell behavior [99]. Micro￾structured polyampholyte flms were fabricated from the polyampholyte p(APM10-
co-AA90) (where APM is N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride, AA is 
acrylic acid), with comonomer ratio 10:90 mol/mol and prestressed polystyrene (PS) 
by thermal treatment. Thermal treatment of p(APM10-co-AA90) spin-coated onto PS 
substrate leads to crosslinking of polyampholyte chains through the formation of 
both amide and anhydride groups and the formation of wrinkled polyampholyte flms 
that are insoluble in water even at high pH. Further modifcation of residual anhy￾dride groups of crosslinked polyampholyte by hydrophilic (D-glucamine) or hydro￾phobic (decylamine) moieties increases or decreases the attachment of model cells 
murine NIH 3T3 fbroplasts on crosslinked thin flms in comparison with unmodifed 
polyampholyte flms. 
In spite of some achievements in fabrication of antifouling polyampholytes, to 
date, the application of zwitterionic materials is still at a laboratory level due to the 
high cost of betainic monomers. Moreover, the current antifouling polyampholy￾tes contain carbon–carbon backbones and are not biodegradable. Therefore, in the 
future, biocompatible and biodegradable polyampholytes made of polypeptides or 
IDPs with superior antifouling properties will be more perspective. 
Hemocompatibility of linear quenched polyampholytes made of 3-sulfopropyl￾methacrylate (SPMA) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride 
(METMAC) at various molar ratios of anionic and cationic monomers was evalu￾ated with respect to human blood plasma in order to clarify the infuence of charge 
balance (or imbalance) on plasma–protein association, blood–plasma clotting, 
and blood–cell hemolysis [100]. It was established that SPMA-METMAC copol￾ymers with excess of positive and negative charges enhance polyampholyte–pro￾tein associations. The effciency of SPMA-METMAC copolymers was compared 
with zwitterionic polymer poly[2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) 
ammonium (polySBA). Both the charge-balanced SPMA-METMAC copolymer 
and polySBA effectively resisted protein adsorption onto polymer interfaces and 184 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
exhibited excellent nonfouling stability. These results suggest that the low pro￾tein adsorption ability of equimolar SPMA-METMAC copolymer and polySBA is 
related to the overall charge neutrality of macromolecules. Moreover, both polySBA 
and charge-balanced SPMA-METMAC copolymer under physiological conditions 
showed very little hemolysis, demonstrating the good nonfouling nature and anti￾hemolytic activity in relation to blood cell membranes. The best anticoagulant and 
antihemolytic activity of equimolar SPMA-METMAC copolymer is attributed to the 
formation of a highly hydrated layer formed between water molecules and anionic– 
cationic groups. Thus, the hemocompatible nature of SPMA-METMAC copolymer 
and polySBA has potential application to molecular design of tunable thrombogenic 
materials for human blood. 
Authors [101] developed blood-compatible zwitterionic polymers that can be 
applied as surface coatings to enhance the blood compatibility of porous adsorbents. 
The effect of poly(sulfobetaine) (PSB) and poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) coatings on 
the blood compatibility of a hydrophobic polystyrene-based polymer as well as on 
a hydrophilic polyacrylate-based polymer was evaluated. Blood compatibility was 
assessed based on polymer-induced hemolysis, coagulation parameters, and in vitro 
tests. Coating enhanced the blood compatibility of hydrophobic, but not of hydro￾philic, adsorbents. Polycarboxybetaine with a charge spacer of fve carbons was the 
most promising polyzwitterion for the coating of adsorbents for whole blood apher￾esis. Equimolar copolymer brushes of polysulfobetaine methacrylates with 3, 6, and 
12 spacer lengths inhibited bacterial growth completely for a long time (>3 months) 
[102]. The copolymer brushes with bactericidal, protein-repellent, and cytocompat￾ible nature show a great promise for use as anti-infective biomedical implant, espe￾cially as wound healing material. 
Polyampholyte brushes composed of amine and carboxylic groups are blood-com￾patible and prevent protein adsorption and cell adhesion and suppress coagula￾tion/complement activation due to intra- and interionic interactions [103]. The 
adhesion and cytotoxicity tests of P(MAPTAC-co-NaSS) hydrogels were carried 
out with respect to fbroplast cells and macrophages [6]. According to biomedi￾cal experiments, the nontoxicity and excellent antifouling properties for polyam￾pholyte hydrogels were observed towards macrophages. Tetrapolymer composed 
of 2-methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine (52.8 mol.%), stearyl methacrylate 
(11.7 mol.%), hydroxypropyl methacrylate (31.4 mol.%), and trimethoxysilylpropyl 
methacrylate (4.0 mol.%) is one example of “bioinspired,” blood-compatible coat￾ing for cardiovascular device [104]. The complex formation ability of polybetaines 
containing cetyl radicals with respect to liposomes based on zwitterionic phosphati￾dylcholine and anionic diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) was investigated [105]. 
Hydrophobic polybetaines irreversibly incorporate into the hydrophobic part of the 
lipid bilayer and show much lower cytotoxicity. Magnetite nanoparticles coated by 
amphoteric macromolecules are perspective as a drug delivery system [106] in bio￾medical applications, especially as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) [107–109]. Polyampholyte-coated magnetite nanoparticles (PCMNPs) were 
used as antifouling and contrasting agent in MRI [110, 111]. The antifouling property 
of PCMNPs with respect to BSA and lysozyme is an effective tool as MRI contrast 
agent with long in vivo circulation time in blood vessels. The hemocompatibility, in Polyampholytes in Biotechnology and Medicine 185 
particular, hemolysis, plasma recalcifcation, dynamic blood clotting, prothrombin 
time, infammatory cytokine release, and complement system activation assays, was 
investigated. PCMNPs have no signifcant effect to vessels and are mainly distrib￾uted in the liver and the blood, with circulation time of 3.77 h. The synthetic strat￾egy of MNP-coated polyzwitterions exhibiting antifouling behavior in the context 
of biomedical applications was reviewed in [112, 113]. Both the hemocompatibility 
and anti(bio)fouling property of polyampholytes are accounted for a highly hydrated 
layer formed between water molecules and anionic–cationic groups. 
5.5 CRYOPROTECTIVE POLYAMPHOLYTES 
Synthetic polyampholytes are suitable materials for inhibition of ice crystallization 
and can serve as cryoprotective agents (CPAs). Cryopreservation of living cells by 
polyampholytes is a powerful tool in biological, medical, and agricultural research 
felds, as well as in regenerative, transplantation, and reproductive medicine [114]. 
Successful long-term preservation of stem cells with appropriate differentiation 
properties is the key technology of cell transplantation. The cryoprotective prop￾erties of polyampholytes as antifreezing agents of living cells were demonstrated 
for the frst time by Matsumura and coworkers [115–127]. The commonly recog￾nized CPAs, such as glycerol [128] and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [129], that were 
used for several decades are proved to be cytotoxic and affected on differentiation of 
various types of cells. New polymeric CPAs based on ε-poly-L-lysine carboxylated 
by succinic anhydride (SA) (COOH-PLL) [114] and hydrophobically modifed by 
dodecylsuccinic anhydride (DDSA) ε-poly-L-lysine (PLL-DDSA) [124] have been 
developed to reduce physical and physiological damage by cryopreservation in mam￾malian stem cells (Structure 5.1). 
It was demonstrated that CPAs based on COOH-PLL, PLL-DDSA, and PLL￾DDSA-SA during the freezing–thawing process signifcantly reduce the risks of 
damage by ice recrystallization and behave in anti-freezing protein-like activities. 
Figure 5.7 shows schematically the cryoprotection mechanism of NIH 3T3 fbroplast 
cells with the participation of polyampholytes based on N,N-dimethylaminoprop￾ylmethacrylamide and acrylic acid (DMAPMA-AA) by using a standard freeze– 
rethaw protocol [130]. 
Upon freezing, cell wrapped by polyampholyte chains is concentrated and forms an 
amorphous pericellular domain consisting of polyampholyte–cell associates. During 
thawing, these polymer-rich pericellular domains are melted and protect cells from 
damage through ice recrystallization. The polyampholyte chains appear to dehydrate 
cells during freezing and to decrease cell size. The suggested mechanism of cell cryo￾protection by polyampholytes is applicable for the viability of certain stem cells [116, 
118], mouse oocytes [119], mouse embryos [124], and L929 [114, 117, 127]. 
Systematic investigations clarifying the role of microstructure, acid/base molar 
ratio, molecular weights, and hydrophobicity of polyampholytes on the ice recrys￾tallization inhibition (IRI) were undertaken by Gibson et al. [131–134]. It was estab￾lished that regular polyampholytes are more active than random polyampholytes, 
demonstrating that the distribution of charged units of polyampholytes plays a cru￾cial role in the determination of IRI activity. Hydrophobic modifcation of both main

Polyampholytes in Biotechnology and Medicine 187 
and side chains of amphoteric macromolecules also changes IRI activity. However, 
the incorporation of 5 mol.% hydrophobic monomers butyl- or octylmethacrylate 
into the polyampholyte chain N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate-co-methacrylic 
acid (DMAEM-MAA) signifcantly enhances the viability of L929, ADSC, and 
HT-1080 cells [126]. It was demonstrated that, functionalized by carboxylic groups, 
poly(aminoethylmethacrylate) (PAEMA-COOH) polyampholyte of equimolar com￾position gives maximal IRI activity, while deviation from the equimolar ratio reduces 
IRI activity (Figure  5.8a). It is proposed that globular conformation of charge￾balanced polyampholytes may be responsible for disrupting the quasi-liquid layer at 
the ice/water interface and inhibiting ice growth. The molecular weight dependency of 
PAEMA-COOH polyampholytes containing 50 mol.% COOH groups reveals that 
IRI activity is higher for high-molecular-weight polyampholytes (Figure 5.8b). 
Surprisingly, both poly(2-methacryloyloxiethylphosphorilcholine (PMPC) and poly 
([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) (PMEDS) ammonium hydrox￾ide) that belong to poly(phospho- and sulfobetaines) do not exhibit IRI activity. This 
phenomenon may be explained by Schlenoff’s [89] conception of the “nonfouling” 
behavior of both PMPC and PMEDS that belong to polyzwitterions. Since polyzwitte￾rions do not perturb the surface-free energy of water, no molecular rearrangements may 
occur for zwitterion-modifed surfaces or polymers. Water molecules directly hydrated 
by polyzwitterions belong to “nonfreezing water,” while water molecules replaced 
(or located) outside the frst hydration shell can be defned as “unassociated,” or bulk 
water. Thus, as follows from Schlenoff’s concept [89], polyzwitterions cannot disorder 
“bulk water,” “semi-ordered water,” and hence infuence the rate of ice crystal growth. 
In spite of the fact that the mode of interaction of polyampholyte chains with ice is 
still unclear, the remarkable experiments of authors in [135] might provide insight into 
this issue. A temperature-dependent evolution of the charge-balanced polyampholyte 
hydrogel upon cooling was studied by SAXS, WAXS, solid state NMR, and feld emis￾sion SEM (FE-SEM). It was found that a networked globular structure of amphoteric 
macromolecules effectively prevents the freezing of water in hydrogel. The existence 
of amorphous water molecules and slushlike, submicrometer-size ice formation at low 
temperatures was detected. The hypothesis that a certain fraction of water molecules do

PAEMA-COOH polyampholytes.

not freeze due to confnement with the polymer chains or interactions with these chains 
was verifed by analysis of the shape of the 2H NMR spectra. For better understanding 
of the ice formation and recrystallization phenomenon in the presence of polyampholy￾tes, a variety of experimental materials should be accumulated. 
Matsumura and co. [136] invented a novel, easilly injectable hydrogel composed 
of synthetic polyampholyte (COOH-PLL) and nanosilicate (laponite) for cell deliv￾ery using a cryopreservation methodology developed earlier. The uniqueness of the 
system is that cells can be preserved both before and after usage without the removal 
of CPA. The composite hydrogels exhibited desirable biocytocompatibility and tun￾able mechanical properties that are useful for the formulation of a new generation of 
scaffolds. 
A new strategy of freeze concentration–mediated cytoplasmic delivery of pro￾teins based on a combination of liposomes and hydrophobically modifed poly￾ampholytes of PLL-DDSA-SA series was developed by Matsumura and co. [137, 
138]. The saline property of polyampholyte-modifed liposomes is that they can 
introduce the encapsulated lysozyme into the cell using freeze–thawing strategy 
of cells (Figure 5.9). 
Polyampholyte-modifed liposomes enhance the interaction between liposomal 
membranes and L929 fbroplast cells due to hydrophobicity of the former. In the 
future, the intracellular delivery of lysozyme proteins by hydrophobically modifed 
polyampholyte liposomes can be used for cancer trreatment and gene therapy. 
Thus, recent studies clearly demonstrated the ability of polyampholyte micro￾gels with random and “core–shell” structures to serve as effective carriers for 
both polyelectrolytes and proteins with programmed release kinetics. Injectable 
microgels that are able to switch “on/off” from strong to weak fowable state open 
new avenue for cell delivery applications, pH- and oxygen-reactive gas carrier, 
bio-sensing, and actuating materials. Among the synthetic polyampholytes, non￾fouling, hemocompatible, and biodegradable zwitterionic polymers attract much

interest as nanocarriers for delivery of chemotherapeutants, DNA, and proteins, 
as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. These materials can trigger 
delivery through a bond cleavage or conformational change under the action of 
temperature, pH, ionic strength, enzymes, redox potential, etc. Polyampholyte 
nanoparticles–based photothermal tumor therapy is a fast-developing and prom￾ising theranostic platform that may offer clinical applications in tumor therapy. 
Spontaneously, physically and chemically crosslinked polyampholyte hydro￾gels synthesized from strong charged anionic and cationic monomers are proved 
excellent biomaterials as artifcial organs due to high toughness, bio- and hemo￾compatibility, anti-biofouling, self-healing, and shear-thinning properties. One 
of the fast-developing areas of synthetic polyampholytes is their cryoprotective 
properties with respect to living cells, namely, red blood cells, HT-1080, L929, 
certain stem cells, mouse oocytes, and mouse embryos. The application of poly￾ampholytes as cryoprotectants is quite recent, and a variety of experimental mate￾rials should be accumulated to explore exact mechanisms of ice formation and 
recrystallization phenomenon in the presence of polyampholytes. In principle, 
among synthetic polyampholytes, the biodegradable precursors, including IDPs, 
can attract much attention and play a crucial role for the development of next-gen￾eration gene delivery vectors [139]. The advances in cryogel technologies to 
address challenges in bioseparation, tissue engineering, controlled drug release, 
biocatalysis, etc. were recently reviewed [140, 141]. The application of polyam￾pholyte cryogels as a protein-imprinted matrix for the separation and purifcation 
of biomacromolecules and for sustained release of biologically active substances 
was highlighted in [142]. It is anticipated that in the future, synthetic polyam￾pholytes will play a great role in solving biological, biotechnological, and bio￾and nanomedicinal problems [22]. Hydrophobically modifed polyampholytes 
composed of ε-poly-l-lysine and succinic anhydride were able to protect different 
proteins from thermal stress, and its performance signifcantly exceeded that of 
previously reported zwitterionic polymers [143]. By facilitating the retention of 
protein enzymatic activity and stabilizing the higher-order structure, these poly￾mers enabled the protein to maintain its native state, even after being subjected 
to extreme thermal stress. Thus, such polyampholytes are extremely effective in 
protecting proteins from extreme stress and may fnd applications in protein bio￾pharmaceuticals and drug delivery systems. 
Poly(allyl glycidyl ether) (PAGE)–based polyampholytes (PAGE-PAs) were used 
for the cryopreservation of mammalian cell suspensions [144]. Toxicity and post￾thaw survival were dependent on PAGE-PA composition, with the highest immediate 
post-thaw survival for normal human dermal fbroblasts occurring for the least-toxic 
PAGE-PA at a cation–anion ratio of 35:65. With low toxicity, PAGE-PA concen￾tration could be increased in order to increase immediate post-thaw survival of the 
immortalized mouse embryonic fbroblasts (NIH/3T3). While immediate post-thaw 
viability was achieved using only PAGE-PAs, long-term cell survival was low, high￾lighting the challenges involved with the design of cryoprotective polyampholytes. 
An environment utilizing both PAGE-PAs and DMSO in a cryoprotective solution 
offered promising post-thaw viabilities exceeding 70%, with long-term metabolic 
activities comparable to unfrozen cells.

Polyampholytes 6 in Catalysis 
Synthetic polyampholytes, due to high content of acid–base groups and rich con￾formational liability, are the best candidate to design active and selective catalysts 
mimicking the functions of enzymes [1]. Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, 
coordination bonds, and hydrophobic entrapment can provide the activity and 
selectivity of polyampholytes with respect to various substrates. Polyampholytes 
themselves, polyampholyte–metal complexes, and polyampholyte–metal nanopar￾ticles can mimic the functions of enzymes and catalyze the reactions of hydrolysis, 
decomposition, hydrogenation, and oxidation of various substrates [2]. Macroporous 
amphoteric cryogels containing metal nanoparticles in pores can be used for catalytic 
reactions as batch-type and continuous-fow-type reactors [3, 4]. There is interest 
in immobilization (or imprinting) of enzymes within three-dimensional polymers, 
acting as monolith reactors, microcapsules, and membranes [5,6]. Such an approach 
can offer new monolith fow-through reactors, which are catalytically several order 
of magnitude more effcient and can be continuously used for long periods. A precise 
combination of enzymes, mono- and bimetallic nanoparticles within nano-, micro-, 
and macro-sized polymeric gels and membranes, can create synergetic effects in 
fow-through catalytic reactions. 
6.1 CATALYSIS BY POLYAMPHOLYTES 
The hydrolysis of positively charged ester 3-acetoxy-N-trimethylaniline iodide 
(ATMAI), negatively charged ester 3-nitro-4-acetoxybenzoic acid (NABA), and 
neutral ester p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA) was catalyzed by 4(5)-vinylimida￾zole-сo-acrylic acid (VI-co-AA) and 4(5)-vinylimidazole-co-maleic acid (VI-co-MA) 
copolymers in 28.5  vol.% ethanol–water mixture and compared with monomeric 
analogs, imidazole, and γ-4(5)-imidazolebutyric acid [7]. For the solvolysis of 
ATMAI, the catalytic activities of monomeric and polymeric catalysts are increased 
in the following sequences: VI-co-MA > VI-co-AA > γ-4(5)-imidazolebutyric acid > 
imidazole. The strongest catalytic effect exhibited a copolymer containing 42–50 
mol.% of imidazole units due to the best isolated acid–base sequences (Figure 6.1). 
The substitution of acrylic acid by vinylsulfonic acid, however, leads to markedly 
decreasing hydrolytic activity of polyampholytes. This is probably explained by the 
high ionization degree of sulfonic acid and formation of strong ion pairs between 
imidazole and sulfonic groups as compared with that of carboxylic groups. The pos￾sible mechanism of ATMAI hydrolysis is that the carboxylate anions electrostatically 
interact with the positively charged parts of substrate, while imidazole molecules 
attack the ester groups. The catalytic activity of alternating VI-co-MA and statistical 
VI-co-AA equimolar polyampholytes was studied in hydrolysis of p-NPA, ATMAI, Polyampholytes in Catalysis 201 
FIGURE 6.1 Effects of VI-co-AA composition and ionic strength on kcat-catalyzed 
solvolysis of ATMAI. Solvent, 28.5% ethanol–water; pH, 9.0; T, 25°C.

catalysis by copolymers containing imidazole and carboxyl functions. Macromolecules

and NABA [3–6]. For the alternating copolymer at pH >9.0, the reaction rate of 
hydrolysis decreases in the following order: NABA > p-NPA > ATMAI. For the sta￾tistical polyampholyte, this order is reversed. The difference in the catalytic activity 
of these copolymers is accounted for the difference in pKa of the carboxylic groups. 
Authors in [8–13] used phenylimidazole–acrylic acid (PI-AA), phenylimidazole– 
methacrylic acid (PI-MAA), and phenylimidazole-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PI-NVP) as 
polymer catalysts and ATMAI as a substrate. The analysis of kinetic data shows 
that the substrate-bonding ability of copolymers increases as PI-NVP > PI-MAA > 
PI-AA and agrees with the change of hydrophobicity of comonomers in the order 
NVP > MAA > AA. Molecules of ATMAI are bound with PI-NVP by means of 
hydrophobic interactions. The PI-AA catalyst interacts with the substrate by hydro￾phobic (with PI units) and electrostatic (with carboxylate anions) forces. Contribu￾tion to the formation of complexes between PI-MAA and ATMAI is made by both 
hydrophobic groups (PI and α-methyl groups of MAA) and electrostatic interactions. 
The rate of hydrolysis of cationic esters of the general formula Sn
+ in the presence 
of 5(6)-vinylimidazole and acrylic acid in 40:60  vol.% propanol–water mixtures 
decreases in the following order: S2
+ > S7
+ > S12+ > S18+. Again, the high catalytic 202 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
activity exhibits copolymers containing 45–55 mol.% of imidazole units. Substrate 
molecules having long acyl groups are hardly catalyzed because of steric hindrances. 
However, when the reaction is carried out in methanol–water (40:60 vol.%) mix￾ture, an opposite effect is observed, that is, the catalytic activity of the copolymers 
increases with the growth of the length of the substrate molecules. Modifed poly￾acrylamide-based amphoteric cryogels were tested as catalytically active substances 
in transesterifcation of glyceryl oleate [14]. The highest conversion of glyceride was 
equal to 88.4%, and the yield of methyl oleate is about 64.%. 
Zwitterionic conjugated polymers are an emerging class of organic photocatalyst 
for light-driven hydrogen production from water due to their photoactive conjugated 
backbones and hydrophilic ionic side chains [15]. The photocatalytic effciency of 
anionic, cationic, and amphoteric polyelectrolytes with the thiophene (T)-dibenzo 
[b,d]thiophene sulfone donor–acceptor backbone was compared. Poly(zwitteri￾onic) photocatalysts behave the best activity with a hydrogen evolution rate of 55.2 
mmol·g–1·h–1 under full-arc Xe light irradiation, which is 1.4-, 1.7-, and 10-fold as 
compared to those of anionic and cationic precursors, respectively. 
6.2 CATALYSIS BY POLYAMPHOLYTE–METAL COMPLEXES 
Complexes of linear and crosslinked polyampholytes with transition metal ions 
(Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ag+) were used as catalysts of H2O2 decomposition [2, 16, 17]. 
Both polyampholytes themselves and metal ions do not show any catalytic activity. 
The rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition is high in the presence of polyam￾pholyte–metal complexes and well described by the Michaelis–Menten kinetic equa￾tion. Activation of H2O2 by polyampholyte–metal complexes was successfully used 
for the degradation of azo dyes. 
Palladium complex of poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-acrylic acid) (4VP-co-AA) was 
used for the hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds, in particular, nitrobenzene, 
2-, 3-, and 4-nitroanailines; 2-, 3-, and 4-nitrophenols; 2-, 3-, and 4-nitroanisols; 
and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to corresponding aniline compounds [18]. The order of ini￾tial hydrogenation rate for all the p-substituted nitrobenzenes increases in the order 
p-OH > p-OCH3 > H > p-NH2 > p-CHO, demonstrating especially good catalytic 
activity for the hydrogenation of nitrophenols and nitroanisoles. The comparison of 
hydrogenation rate of different isomers of nitroaniline gives an order of p- > o- > 
m-substituted nitrobenzenes. The catalyst stability of 4VP-co-AA/Pd complex for 
the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitroanisole was rather high, up to four to 
fve cycles; the TON amounted to 2,000 within a total reaction time of 2.3 and 4.5 h. 
Raj et al. [19] reported an organic–inorganic heterogeneous tunable catalyst con￾sisting of a (poly-N,N-diallyl-N-hexylamine-alt-maleic acid) and phosphotungstic 
acid (H3PW12O40) hybridization of polyoxometalates (POMs) and its supramolecu￾lar structures. The supramolecular organization of the aggregates was regulated by 
electrostatic interactions between the positively charged sites of the polyampholyte 
and the anionic functional groups of POM. Because of the large size and charge of 
POM anions, it can be concluded that POM entities are encapsulated by the pol￾ymer chains. By tuning the supramolecular assembly of organic–inorganic hybrid 
materials, it is possible to control the catalytic properties of POM heterogeneous  
Polyampholytes in Catalysis 203 
catalysts in several chemical transformations. In patent literature [20], there is avail￾able information about the use of palladium and platinum nanoparticles stabilized by 
polymeric carbo-, sulfo-, and phosphobetaines as catalysts for fuel cells. 
6.3 POLYAMPHOLYTE-PROTECTED METAL 
NANOPARTICLES IN CATALYSIS 
New perspectives for developing effective catalytic systems can be opened by incor￾porating noble and transition metal ions into amphoteric nanogels, microgels, and 
macroporous gels used as templates in reduction process [17]. From the relevant 
literature, it is well-known that both hydrogels and cryogels of amphoteric nature can 
be used for the immobilization of metal nanoparticles [18–21]. Different-shaped gold 
nanoparticles, namely, triangular, hexagonal, spherical, and rod-like particles in the 
range of 3–10 µm, can be immobilized within the amphoteric hydrogels and cryogels 
and distributed at the surface and inner parts of micro- and macropores (40–100 µm). 
For example, Ni nanoparticles synthesized in microgels of poly2-(methacryloyloxy) 
ethyl] dimethyl (3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide p(SBMA) were used as cata￾lysts for the hydrogenation of nitro group containing molecules such as 4-nitrophenol 
(4-NP), 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), and 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) [22]. Hereby, the reduc￾tion process was monitored by measuring the decrease of the absorption peaks at 
414 nm, 400 nm, and 380 nm for 2-NP, 4-NP, and 4-NA, respectively. The activa￾tion energy of the hydrogenation of 4-NP and thermodynamic parameters, that is, 
enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy, was calculated. The cyclic tests for the prepared 
p(SBMA)-Ni composites were carried out for the reduction of 4-NP. The catalytic 
activity of p(SBMA)-Ni was decreased to 37% after the frst cycle, and to 10% after 
the third cycle. This decrease can be related to structural composite breakdown under 
release of Ni nanoparticles. 
Recently new-generation catalysts are being developed in combination with light 
harvesters or photosensitizers [23]. One example is entrapping of supramolecu￾lar light harvesting assemblies (perylene monoimide (PMI)–based chromophore) 
for photocatalytic production of hydrogen within polyampholyte hydrogels [24]. 
Hybrid hydrogels of PMI/polyampholyte were tested for their photocatalytic pro￾ton reduction performance. Upon illumination of hybrid hydrogels loaded with a 
thiomolybdate catalyst, Na2[Mo3S13], in the ascorbic acid solution adjusted to pH 4, 
hydrogen production was observed. Proof-of-principle experiments on photocataly￾sis of hydrogen production showed that optimized systems could be reused in mul￾tiple cycles of photocatalysis after refreshing the system for removal and addition 
of small molecule components. Another example is poly(dehydroalanine)-based 
(PDha) amphoteric hydrogels containing Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs), a thiomolybdate 
catalyst ([Mo3S13]2-), or a cobalt polyoxometalate catalyst (Co4POM = [Co4(H2O)2 
(PW9O34)2]10-) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+, which were applied as reusable heterogeneous cat￾alysts for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) when 
irradiated under visible light [25, 26]. The formation of hybrid [Ru]@PtNPs@PDha 
hydrogel is schematically shown in Figure 6.2. 
PtNPs can reduce protons and produce hydrogen under visible light if combined 
with a suitable photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The catalytic activity of [Ru]@PtNPs@

PDha for H2 evolution by visible light irradiation resulted in an H2 production rate of 
28.5 μmol· g−1·h−1. For [Ru(bpy)3]2+/PtNPs molar ratios of 80, 8, and 0.8, the meas￾ured TON was equal to 350, 80, and 52, respectively. This work shows a straightfor￾ward approach to hybrid hydrogels for light-driven catalysis, although the presented 
approach is still prone to photodegradation and leaching, depending on the choice of 
catalyst or photosensitizer. 
Design of core–shell hybrid materials based on a TiO2 core functionalized with 
a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)-g-(n-propylphosphonic acid acrylamide) 
shell (PDha-g-PAA@TiO2) facilitated the effcient immobilization of the photosensi￾tizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO2 core 
[27]. This resulted in high visible light–driven H2 generation. The enhanced light￾driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core–shell design, with the graft 
copolymer acting as a bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby 
also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha￾g-PAA@TiO2 was possible by introducing [Mo3S13]2@cluster anions as hydrogen 
evolution cocatalyst (Figure 6.3). 
This novel design approach is an example for a multi-component system in which 
reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular 
or polymeric species. 
Macroporous amphoteric cryogels containing metal nanoparticles in pores can 
be used for catalytic reactions as batch-type and continuous-fow-type reactors. The 
idea of the use of macroporous and supermacroporous cryogels as fow-through cat￾alytic reactors was, for the frst time, formulated in [21] and experimentally realized 
in [28–32] for hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds (Figure 6.4). 
Equimolar polyampholyte cryogel DMAEM-co-MAA effectively reduces rho￾dium, palladium, gold, and silver ions under heating conditions and forms fne 
well-dispersed metal nanoparticles without the use of any other reducing agents [33]. 
Moreover, micron-sized cryogel matrix provides fast swelling in 0.5–2 min and high 
water fux. Porous DMAEM-co-MAA cryogel with immobilized AuNPs was used Polyampholytes in Catalysis 205

as a fow-through catalytic reactor in reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and oxida￾tion of D,L-dithiotreitol (DTT) [28–30]. The fnal hydrogenation product of 4-NP is 
4-aminophenol (4-AP), while the fnal oxidation product of DTT is disulfde (DS). 
The kinetic parameters, turnover number (TON), turnover frequency (TOF), and 
activation energy of hydrogenation of 4-NP and oxidation of DTT were determined 
(Table 6.1). 
The catalytic reduction of p-nitrobenzoic acid (p-NBA) was performed by palla￾dium (PdNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) immobilized within DMAEM-co￾MAA cryogel matrix [31, 32]. It should be noted that in the absence of immobilized 
metal nanoparticles, the mixture of p-NBA and NaBH4 fuxed through the P(D￾MAEM-co-MAA) cryogel does not produce p-aminobenzoic acid (p-ABA). 
Hydrogenation of p-NBA yields at least three main products: (1) p-ABA, (2) 
p,p’-azodibenzoate, and (3) sodium 4-(4-aminobenzamido)benzoate. In case of 
P(DMAEM-co-MAA)/PdNPs, the formation of only p-ABA with conversion degree 
40% at [p-NBA]:[NaBH4] = 1:50 mol/mol and 100% at [p-NBA]:[NaBH4] = 1:200 
mol/mol is observed. According to the activation energy, TONs, and TOFs values 
established in these experiments, the effciency of macroporous fow-through reactor 
is greater compared to the macroporous batch-type reactor. 
6.4 CATALYTIC PROPERTIES OF CATALASE IMMOBILIZED 
WITHIN POLYAMPHOLYTE CRYOGELS 
Special interest may represent physical (adsorption, encapsulation, entrapment) and 
chemical (covalent attachment, crosslinking) immobilization of enzymes within 
macroporous gel matrix for obtaining a new generation of fow-through biocatalysts 
that may have signifcant potential in biotechnology, fne chemical, food, and phar￾maceutical industries [33, 34]. The advantage of a cryogel-based fow-through cata￾lytic reactor is its simple setup, minimal amount of enzyme, high surface-to-volume 
ratio, interconnectivity of pores, prolonged contact between the enzyme and reaction 
mixture, continuous formation of target product, as well as environmental friendli￾ness, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability [4]. 
Amphoteric cryogel-encapsulated catalase has proven effective in the oxidation 
of iso-propanol and n-butanol using hydrogen peroxide in batch and fow-through 
reactor under mild conditions, at 20°C and atmospheric pressure (Figure 6.5) [35]. Polyampholytes in Catalysis 207 
FIGURE 6.5 Synthetic protocol of encapsulation of catalase within APTAC-AMPS cryogel 
matrix and SEM image of catalase immobilized cryogel.

According to SEM image, the average pore size of cryogel samples varies from 10 
to 50 µm. Such big pores provide a free fow of liquid substrate and oxidation agent 
under gravity and hydrostatic pressure. 
The oxidized products of ethanol, iso-propanol, and n-butanol are acetalde￾hyde, acetone, and butyraldehyde, with yields of 97, 87.6, and 80%, respectively 
(Figure 6.6). 
The infuence of pH, temperature, and volume ratios of substrate to oxidizing 
agent on the conversion degree of alcohols was evaluated. The optimal conditions 
are pH 6.4, a temperature range of 5–20°C, and a volume ratio of substrate to reduc￾ing agent of 1:1. 
The oxidation of ethanol by catalase entrapped in a cryogel matrix of macroporous 
polyampholyte was studied in batch-type reactor with the help of hydrogen perox￾ide, molecular oxygen, and air [36]. The acetaldehyde yields irrespective to cryogel 
forms, monolith, or powder were in the range of ~60–98%. In batch-type reactor, 
oxidation of ethanol by hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen yields up to ~97– 
98% of acetaldehyde. The oxidation degree of ethanol by air is lower (~ 60%). The 
reusability of cryogel-entrapped catalase in batch rector was evaluated. It was found 
that the conversion degree of ethanol to acetaldehyde insignifcantly decreases over 
successive fve runs and, after the ffth runs, becomes 57.3%. The calculated turnover 
number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values for oxidation of ethanol by 
hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and air in the presence of monolith and powder cryogels 
are given in Table 6.2.

The TOF value for fow-through catalytic reactor was six times higher than that 
of batch laboratory reactor. The successive oxidation of the iso-propanol–hydrogen 
peroxide mixture leads to decreasing yields of acetone, probably due to the collapse 
of the cryogel matrix. The shrinking of cryogel pores in water–organic solvent mix￾tures was confrmed by changes in the volume of cryogel samples, thus decreasing

the fow rate and contact time, as verifed by the SEM measurements. UV-Vis spec￾troscopy shows that the catalase is retained in the cryogel matrix without signs of 
leaching. After ten cycles of oxidation of alcohols, the initial morphology of the 
cryogel-encapsulated catalase is completely changed. This effect is probably due to 
the oxidative destruction of the internal structure of the cryogel matrix by oxygen 
atoms and/or hydroxyl radicals that are released as a result of hydrogen peroxide 
decomposition by catalase. 
Thus, the suggested methods might be useful for the oxidation of aliphatic alcohols 
into their corresponding carbonyl compounds. The advantages of enzyme-entrapped 
cryogel samples are minimal volume of catalyst, high surface-to-volume ratio, high 
selectivity, productivity, energy-saving, and “green chemistry” aspects. The major 
drawback of cryogel microreactors are weak mechanical properties. A serious prob￾lem represents the chemical destruction of cryogel matrix and leaching out of enzyme 
from the 3D network that can cause contamination of the fnal products.

Application of 7 Polyampholytes in 
Emerging Technologies 
7.1 WASTEWATER PURIFICATION AND DESALINATION 
Water-soluble and water-swelling polyampholytes, including amphoteric cryogels, 
have found a wide number of practical applications in medicine, biotechnology, 
nanotechnology, oil industry, water purifcation, catalysis, desalination, sewage 
treatment, focculation, coagulation, etc. [1–5]. The ability of water-soluble poly￾ampholytes to form stable chelate complexes is useful for the recovery of metal ions 
from the wastewater [6–10] and polluted soils [11]. Complexation of transition metal 
ions with acid–base groups of annealed polyampholytes proceeds via formation of 
ion coordination (or chelate) complexes, and release of metal ions takes place at the 
IEP of polyampholytes [12, 13] (Figure 7.1). 
If polyampholyte is soluble in water at the IEP (route 1, for instance, at high pH 
8–10), the metal ions released from macromolecular coils are precipitated in the 
form of metal hydroxides, and the polyampholyte is found in the supernatant. If 
polyampholyte is insoluble at the IEP (route 2, for instance, at low pH 2–4), then the 
polyampholyte aggregates and precipitates while metal ions are retained in the super￾natant. The release of metal ions from macromolecular coils is due to the realization 
of the so-called isoelectric effect as a result of competition between metal–ligand 
complexes and intraionic salt bonds between acid–base monomers (see Subchap￾ter 1.9). The effective removal of metal ions by water-soluble polycarboxybetaines 
(PCBs) [14–16] is reached up to 97%. Modifed by ethanolamine and glycine, PCBs 
were reused fve times without the loss of adsorption capacity (99%). 
Amphoteric carboxymethylated polyethylenimines (CM-PEIs) are excellent metal 
ion complexing macromolecular ligands were prepared from polyethylenimine (PEI) 
with 2-chloroacetic acid (CA) in an alkaline medium and characterized by SEC, 
pH potentiometry, DLS, and multinuclear and multidimensional NMR techniques to 
determine the degree of functionalization, size, and possible structure [17]. CM-PEIs 
form complexes with Cu(II) and effciently decrease the rate of the copper-mediated 
oxidation of ascorbic acid. The good affnity toward cations of CM-PEI functional￾ized at 67% is further demonstrated by its capacity to bind even sodium ions. These 
properties show that CM-PEIs are a promising metal-chelating polymers for diag￾nostic or theragnostic purposes. 
As distinct from linear analogs, the interaction of metal ions with PCB hydrogels 
is accompanied by gradual coloring and shrinking of sample [18] (Figure 7.2). Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 213

The thin-colored shell layer which is formed on the hydrogel surface gradually 
moves into the gel interior. The driving force of this process is “ion-hopping trans￾portation” of metal ions through metal–ligand complex formation, for example, con￾stant migration of metal ions deeply into the gel interior by exchanging free ligand 
vacancies. The desorption of metal ions from the gel interior also starts from the 
surface due to the destruction of ligand–metal complexes and formation of zwitte￾rions. The periodic washing out of gel specimen by distilled water leads to its full 
regeneration. 
Amino-hypophosphite (AHPs) polyampholytic ion scavengers with respect to four 
toxic metal ions—copper(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II), and lead(II)—were synthesized 
via a modifed Mannich reaction from cheap polyalkylenepolyamines [(bis(hexam￾ethylene)triamine, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine, bis(3-aminopropyl)amine, diethylene￾triamine, tetraethylenepentamine, and pentaethylenehexamine)] [19]. It was found 
that all AHPs possess ion-scavenging properties in a wide pH range (2.0–8.0). The 
highest values of the ionic capacities derived from cation removal experiments vary 
in the range of 0.7–2.5 mmol Me2+·g−1 of acidic AHP and 1–4 mmol Me2+·g−1 of basic 
AHP. These features suggest their potential application for toxic metal ion removal 
processes in a wide spectrum of wastewater types. 
A large number of sorption experiments using chitosan-based amphoteric cryogels 
functionalized by aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCA) were carried out in batch and 
fxed-bed column conditions with respect to fve-component heavy metal ion (HMI) 
solutions containing Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ in equimolar concentrations [20]. 
The overall sorption tendency of the APCA-functionalized composite sorbents fol￾lowed the sequence Ni2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+ > Co2+, meaning, that Ni2+ ions have the 
highest affnity, while Co2+ ions have the lowest. The dynamic desorption experiments 
highlight that the microbeads of chitosan-based APCA can be cleaned of the sorbed 
HMIs in continuous fow setups, with potential for regeneration and reuse in successive 
sorption/desorption cycles without the need to remove the materials from the column. 
A β-cyclodextrin/magnetic graphene oxide/triethylenetetramine-functionalized 
magnetically polyampholyte hydrogel adsorbent P(AA-MMA)/MGO/CA-CD/NH2 
with high-density carboxyl and amino groups demonstrates adsorption behaviors 
toward methylene blue (MB), malachite green (MG)/Congo red (CR), and Cu2+ ions 
in batch adsorption and column fltration experiments [21]. To assess the practical 
application prospects of as-prepared amphoteric hydrogel, its adsorption perfor￾mance towards contaminants (MB, MG, CR, and Cu2+) were further tested in four 
real samples (mineral water, urban water, river, and lake water) and model textile 
wastewater. The maximum adsorption capacities of hydrogel towards MB (3185.16 
mg/g), MG (3315.00 mg/g), CR (1058.18 mg/g), and Cu2+ (140.50 mg/g) were much 
higher than most reported absorbents. The reusability of hydrogel adsorbent was 
tested through eight adsorption–desorption cycles and exhibited good stability and 
magnetic recyclability. 
The application of macroporous amphoteric hydrogels and cryogels is more eff￾cient and economically feasible for the removal of metal ions from wastewaters [22]. 
Polyampholyte hydrogels modifed by graphene oxide (GO) exhibited good mechan￾ical property, durability, high sorption capacity, and excellent recyclability to design 
adsorbents for removal of hazard metal ions in wastewater (Figure 7.3). Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 215 
FIGURE 7.3 Polyampholyte hydrogels containing amine and carboxylic groups modifed 
by (A) graphene oxide, (B) sorption and desorption of metal ions, and (C) purifcation of

The advantages of polyampholyte hydrogel sorbent are (1) excellent mechanical 
strength for separation and reusability; (2) fast sorption rate and high sorption capac￾ity; (3) high treatment capacity on fxed-bed column; (4) effcient removal of toxic 
metal ions from industrial effuent; and (5) low cost, at US$6.3/kg. 
Special interest represents magnetic macroporous chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid) 
hydrogels and magnetically recyclable polyampholyte hydrogel adsorbent, which 
possesses high adsorption capacity, easy separation, and excellent reusability [23– 
26] (Figure 7. 4). 
Purifcation of dyes from industrial wastes is extremely important from an eco￾logical point of view. The removal of methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO) 
[27, 28], Congo red, mixture of MB and Eosin dyes, as well as Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions 
was performed with the help of aminocarboxylate-maleic acid–based hydrogels 
[27, 29], PEI-based polyampholytes [30], linear and crosslinked polyampholytes 
based on N-acryloyl-N’-ethylpiperzine and maleic acid [31], as well as hydrogels 
of aminocarboxylate–maleic acid, chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid) sorbents modi￾fed by clay minerals [27,29], chitosan/polyacrylate/graphene oxide polyampholy￾tic composite physical hydrogel [32], and macroporous polyampholyte hydrogels 
[33]. New polysulfobetaine cryogel derived from 2-(N-3-sulfopropyl-N,N-dimethyl 
ammonium)ethyl methacrylate and water-soluble crosslinker N,N,N’,N’-tetrame￾thyl-N,N’-bis(2-ethylmethacrylate)-propyl-1,3-diammonium dibromide was used 
for selective sorption of MO from the mixture of MO and MB [34]. Table 7.1 demon￾strates the sorption capacity of polysulfobetaine cryogel with respect to individual 
and mixed dyes after 7 and 24 h. It is seen that the amphoteric cryogel preferentially 
adsorbs MO, but not MB. The current materials may fnd application in water treat￾ment and, possibly, in chromatography. 216 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

Microgels have emerged as promising building blocks for constructing porous 
membranes due to their soft, porous, responsive, and functional nature. Zwitterionic 
microgel-based membrane comprising poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-(acry￾loyloxy)succinimide) (poly(NIPAm-co-NAS)) microgels covalently crosslinked 
with zwitterionic N,N,N-tris(2-aminoethyl)-3-sulfo-1-propanaminium salt (TRIPS) 
through a nucleophilic reaction between the succinimidyl ester group and the primary 
amine group was fabricated [35]. The nanostructured microgel membranes exhibited 
excellent water permeation with smart gating properties, owing to the high water 
absorptivity and thermoresponsiveness of the microgel. The nanosized pores, formed 
due to the densely packed microgels and its own crosslinked structure, enabled the 
strong rejection of low-molecular-weight dyes and macromolecules. Furthermore, 
the pore size tunability under external stimuli provided the capability for stepwise 
separation of different solutes with varying diameters by controlling their molecular 
transmission through the membrane. The nanoporous zwitterionic microgel mem￾brane exhibits strong antifouling properties with smart permeation and molecular

separation, signifying its potential for water purifcation and various environmental 
separation and fltration. 
Oily wastewater is one of the potential contributors to environmental pollution, 
and it has become a signifcant concern owing to its adverse impact on the eco￾system. For instance, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has triggered the alarm on 
the diffculty of oil–water separation. Poly(vinylidene fuoride) (PVDF) membrane 
modifed with a zwitterionic/hydrophobic pentapolymer (PP) containing a variety of 
chelating motifs COO−, PO3H−, SO3
−, and NH2 with controlled pore size has been 
utilized to separate oil from water from their nanoemulsions [36]. Due to the pres￾ence of the polar groups, hydrophilicity was imparted to the PVDF surface, the oil 
emulsions broke down, water passed easily, and oil was released and prevented from 
passing through the PP-PVDF membrane (Figure 7.5). 
The observed permeate appeared as clear water without any emulsion. The 
PP-PVDF membranes have demonstrated an excellent capability to deal with the 
high concentrations of nanoemulsions with a separation effciency of greater than 
97.5%. The fux recovery ratio (FRR) of PP-5-incorporated PVDF membrane was 
about 82%, which was substantially higher than the pristine PVDF. A simple and 
effcient modifcation strategy of PVDF surface is a facile co-deposition by tannin 
acid and new zwitterion, sulfonated N, N-diethylethylenediamine, that improves the 
hydrophilicity of PVDF and resistance to oil-fouling for effective oil-in-water emul￾sion separation [37]. The FRR of modifed PVDF membrane was equal to 96.6% ± 
FIGURE 7.5 Mechanism of separation of oil-in-water emulsions by PVDF membrane

emulsions, respectively, after six cycle tests. The extraordinary separation effciency 
(all beyond 99.6%) and FRR (all above 98.5%) in separating various oil-in-water 
emulsions were reached after co-deposition modifcation via introducing hydrophilic 
groups and the positive/negative charges. 
Self-assembled membranes of allyl methacrylate (AMA) and sulfobetaine meth￾acrylate (SBMA) with tunable and smallest pore size of ~0.9 nm are exceptional 
selective with respect to mono- and divalent ions, for example, Cl− and SO4
2−[38]. 
These membranes achieve >99.2% SO4
2− rejection and a Cl−/SO4
2− selectivity of 
101, demonstrating their promise for sulfate removal and other water purifcation 
technology. The salt-rejecting properties in dynamic reverse osmosis membranes 
made of P2VP-co-PAA and P2VP-co-PMAA were studied by Stille et al. [39, 40]. 
The fux rate was maximal near the pHIEP (pH 5.5–6.0), and a good salt rejection 
was observed (60–80%). This behavior is accounted for the strong interaction of 
P2VP and PAA (or PMAA) blocks, resulting in contraction of membrane, pro￾viding a high porosity. At the IEP (pH 5.5–6.0), they showed the maximal fux 
rate and a good salt rejection (60–80%). This behavior is accounted for the for￾mation of intra-MMC between P2VP and PAA (or PMAA) blocks and realiza￾tion of the isoelectric effect. Crosslinked pentablock polyampholytes comprising 
of quaternary ammonium residues, styrenesulfonate, and neutral crosslinkable 
isoprene blocks were tested as membranes for desalination [41]. An amphoteric 
ion exchange membrane prepared by chemical grafting of AA and DMAEM on 
ozonized polyethylene was characterized by measuring ion exchange capacity, 
water and electrolyte content, electrical conductivity, membrane potential, and 
transport number [42]. The ability of polyampholyte hydrogels to absorb saline 
water was used for the production of drinking water [43]. For desalination of 
saline water, application of amphoteric cryogels having a porous structure might 
be more suitable and cost-effective. Polyzwitterions containing residues of gly￾cine were used as antiscalant reagents and demonstrated scale inhibition up to 
100% [44]. The inexpensive antiscalant has the potential in mitigating scale for￾mation and rejecting brine in an osmosis chamber. 
7.2 POLYAMPHOLYTES IN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY (EOR) 
To remove oil from nature, the presence of connate water represents one serious 
problem in oil recovery. The application of water-soluble polymers for enhanced 
oil recovery (EOR) is a challenging task for industries as well as academic research 
[1]. Synthetic and natural water-soluble and water-swelling polymers used for EOR 
should satisfy the following but not limited key requirements: 
1. Regulation of the ratio of water mobility to oil mobility. Ideally, the mobil￾ity ratio is less than 1. 
2. Viscosifying and/or mobility control agents in harsh conditions, that is, 
high temperature and high salinity. 
3. Reducing the oil/water interfacial tension (IFT). Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 219

course of polyampholyte and HPAM injections is around of 28% and 18%, respec￾tively, in comparison with the initial oil mass in the sand packs. 
This is explained by an increase in the viscosity of the brine solution due to the 
disruption of intra- and interionic contacts between the oppositely charged AMPS 
and APTAC moieties, demonstrating the antipolyelectrolyte effect. This phenomenon 
leads to a decrease in the mobility factor (M), which is a quantitative parameter of oil 
displacement with water: 
k °µ M = w 0 
k0 °µw 
where M is mobility factor, kw is water permeability, μ0 is oil viscosity, k0 is oil per￾meability, and μw is water viscosity. 
In this context, the hydrophobically modifed polyampholytes (HMPA) may be 
effective viscosity enhancers in high-salinity media and temperature as they com￾bine the advantage of alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) fooding [58–64]. Applica￾tion of HMPA in EOR was reviewed in [65]. The viscosity of HMPA increases due 
to intermolecular association of the hydrophobic parts [66]. A mixture of HMPA, 
C12/14 alkyl polyglycoside (APG1214), and n-alcohol was created and character￾ized by viscometry, oil/water interfacial tension (IFT) measurements, and checking 
the phase behavior [67]. Polyglycosides containing C12/14 alkyl groups (APG1214) 
were used as surfactants, with n-alcohol as a co-solvent, to create a physical linker Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 221 
between the oleic phase and the APG1214 monolayer for tuning the hydrophilic– 
lipophilic balance (HLB) of APG1214. It was found that the hydrophob–hydrophob 
interactions between the hydrophobic moieties of the HMPA backbone and the alkyl 
chain of APG1214 result in a mixed micelle formation, serving as junction points 
for supramolecular network formation, accompanied by a pronounced increase of 
the apparent solution viscosity. According to the results of Gou et al. [68], the addi￾tional amount of oil recovered by hydrophobically modifed polyampholyte based 
on acrylamide, sodium acrylate, 3-(diallylamino)-2-hydroxypropyl sulfonate, and 
3-(2-(2-heptadec-8-enyl-4,5-dihydro-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl-carbomoyl)acrylic acid 
was equal to 15.46%. HMPA with zwitterionic betaine groups reported by authors 
[69] showed salt-thickening behavior; a salt-thickening mechanism was proposed, 
that the destroyed inner salt bond of zwitterionic betaine groups in salt solution 
(which is named as anti-polyelectrolyte or “salting-in” effect) brought a greater 
hydrodynamic diameter of polymer molecules, and the intermolecular hydropho￾bic interaction of the long alkyl groups in salt solution produced a stronger hydro￾phobic association. Analogous salt-thickening behavior exhibited the copolymer 
of acrylamide and N-methyl-N-allyllauroylpropanesulfonate containing 3 mol.% 
of both betaine and hydrophobic groups [70]. The core fooding tests and micro￾scopic displacement experiments showed that HMPA had salt-thickening property 
and anti-scouring capacity in porous medium in high-salt reservoirs and was able to 
recover 23.7% oil after the water fooding stage. 
Zwitterionic sulfobetaine unit–incorporated HPAM increases the viscosity under 
high salinity and high temperature and shows a good viscosity retention at 90°C in a 
synthetic brine of 200 g·L-1 salinity that is signifcant for the EOR [71]. 
A heat-, salt-, and pressure-resistant amphoteric hydrogel composed of acrylamide 
(AAm), 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS), and N-acryloyl mor￾pholine (ACMO) and gelled at 150°C was able to plug fractures of 0.1–5.0 mm, lead￾ing to the breakthrough pressure exceeding 4.0 MPa [72]. After aging at 150°C for 
seven days, the elastic modulus of AAm-AMPS-ACMO only decreased by 14.29%. 
The gel strength and gelation time of amphoteric gel could be adjusted by terpol￾ymer concentration, crosslinker concentration, temperature, and salinity, which 
was benefcial to enter and plug fractures smoothly. Extensive laboratory experi￾ments indicated that amphoteric gel has outstanding thermal stability and pressure￾bearing performance, making it a promising candidate for lost circulation control in 
high-temperature and high-pressure formations. 
A series of AAm-co-AAc-co-DMAEM terpolymer hydrogels complexed with 
Cu2+ considerably enhanced the strength of network due to complexation between 
Cu2+ and the carboxyl groups of acrylic acid (AAc) [73]. Further, the polyam￾pholyte-Cu2+ hydrogel powder was used for plugging the microcracks inside the 
cement annulus and solidifed to form a cement stone. Once microcracks occur 
inside the cement paste, the natural gas with associated CO2 comes into contact 
with the polyampholyte-Cu2+ hydrogels. As a result, the polyampholyte–metal 
network is triggered by CO2 due to protonation of the tertiary amine groups of 
the DMAEMA by acidic carbon dioxide gas. The polyampholyte hydrogels swell 
because of anti-polyelectrolyte effect and effectively plug the microcracks inside 
the cement paste. 222 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
For conformance control in oil recovery, authors in [74] suggested to apply the 
crosslinked amphoteric terpolymers of AAm-AMPS-APTAC containing bentonite. 
The mechanical strength of composite hydrogels increased from 82.3 Pa to 173.7 Pa 
in the presence of 5 wt.% bentonite. The swelling degree (SD) of AAm-AMPS-AP￾TAC-Bentonite hydrogels increases in saline water (total salinity of reservoir water 
is 61 and 128 g·L-1), increases two times upon heating up to 80°C, is less-sensitive to 
pH change at the interval of pH 4.5–9.0, and collapses when the content of organic 
solvents (ethanol and acetone) is more than 50 or 60 vol.% in water–organic solvent 
mixture. Collapsing polyampholyte gels in organic solvents are important for remov￾ing blockages in the oil reservoir in the case of an emergency. All these properties 
are suitable for the application of amphoteric hydrogels in conformance control and 
oil recovery. 
7.3 POLYAMPHOLYTES AS ADDITIVES TO DRILLING FLUIDS 
The development of water-based drilling fuids (WBDF) with the participation of 
polyampholytes to increase the viscosity at high salinity and elevated temperatures 
is relevant in the oil and gas industry [1]. The WBDFs are the most common drilling 
fuids in drilling engineering and are composed of bentonite clay, various polymer 
agents (thinner, fuid-loss additive, shale stabilizer, etc.), and wetting materials (bar￾ite and calcium carbonate). A new family of amphoteric cellulose-based copolymers 
was prepared by grafting acrylamide (AM) and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate 
(DMAEMA) onto carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and used as multifunctional drill￾ing mud additives with respect to shale inhibition, viscosity-building, and fltration 
control [75–77]. Binary, (HPAAm-DMDAAC) [78], ternary (AAm-AMPS-APTAC; 
AAm-AMPS-DMDAAC; methyl allyl alcohol-DMDAAC-AMPS) [79–81], and 
tetra monomer containing polymers (AAm-AMPS-DMDAAC-SSS) [82], (AAm￾AMPS-DMDAAC-St) in combination with laponite [83] possessing amphoteric 
character, were used as WBDF. Amphoteric polymers can make WBDF more toler￾ant to high salinity at elevated temperatures [80, 84]. In this regard, polyampholytes 
are of great interest, because of their ability to increase viscosity with the increase 
in salinity [85]. A review article of authors in [86] summarizes the classifcation, 
mechanism of action, characteristics, and current status of the application of differ￾ent functional materials, including amphoteric polymers, in oil feld applications, in 
particular, in oil and gas drilling, enhanced oil recovery, water plugging, and profle 
control. Recently [87, 88], temperature- and salt-resistant polyampholyte gels were 
used as fuid loss additive and plugging agent for WBDF. Synthetic polyampholytes 
have been frequently used as fltration reducers in WBDF because of their active 
interactions with clay and impressive fltration control at temperatures higher than 
180°C. Hydrophobically modifed by epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), polyampholyte 
was used for the frst time as a potential shale inhibitor [89]. It (AADE) was prepared 
by micellar polymerization of acrylamide (AM), 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesul￾fonic acid (AMPS) and methacrylatoethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (METMAC) 
with pre-prepared ESO-derived methacrylate monomer (ESO-MA). A comparative 
study of obtained AADE and the polyampholyte without hydrophobic modifcation 
(AAD) was carried out through thermal properties, rheological properties, inhibition Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 223 
performance, and drilling fuid compatibility tests. The results showed that AADE 
possessed higher thermal stability due to the presence of hydrophobic associative 
ability and crosslinkable  epoxy groups, and the hydrophobic interaction between 
AADE chains dominated the shear-thinning behavior and lowered the viscosity–tem￾perature and viscosity–salt dependence. Also, AADE at a lower concentration more 
effectively prevented clay hydration swelling and inhibited shale disintegration than 
AAD and conventional inhibitors. Meanwhile, AADE was well compatible with ben￾tonite dispersion in both fresh water and brine and improved rheological properties 
and decreased API and high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) fuid loss before 
and after hot rolling. The inhibition mechanism of AADE was revealed to be the syn￾ergetic actions of physical plugging of hydrophobic associated multipolymer aggre￾gates in micro-pores of shale, chemical flm with a hydrophobic shell formed on clay 
surface, and the surface activity to reduce capillary-driven force. This research might 
provide an insight for the application of hydrophobically modifed polymer, par￾ticularly plant oil–based, as shale inhibitor in water-based drilling fuid. Amphoteric 
polymers can make WBDF more tolerant to high salinity at elevated temperatures 
[90, 91]. In this regard, polyampholytes are of great interest, because of their ability 
to increase viscosity with the increase in salinity [89, 92]. An injectable self-healing 
polyampholyte hydrogel containing sulfonated and quaternary ammonium function￾alities P(MAPTAC-co-NaSS) was comprehensively evaluated to prevent the severe 
loss of fuids to formation [88]. Increased temperature and salinity accelerate the 
self-healing process, which is easily realized downhole. For example, P(MAPTAC￾co-NaSS) maintains plugging performance at salinity exceeding 15 wt.% and at high 
temperature of 150°C. The particle gels can form a strong and tough slug in pore and 
cracks of sandstone by cooperation with Na-bentonite particles in WBDFs adaptive 
for strata of varied pore sizes. Amphoteric polymers are believed to electrostatically 
attract negatively charged bentonite layers, which results in the reduction of fuid loss 
[92]. Moreover, amphoteric polymers promote the shear-thinning behavior of fuids, 
high viscosity at low shear rates, to suspend and carry cuttings, and low viscosity 
at a high shear rates, for fast rotation of drilling instruments at high pressure [88]. 
Recently [53, 54, 79], a new ternary polyampholyte AAm-co-AMPS-co-APTAC of 
the composition 80:10:10 mol.% was synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as 
potential reagents for EOR and additives for WBDF in a wide range of salinity. It 
was shown [93] that the charged-balanced ternary polyampholyte based on AAm-co￾AMPS-co-APTAC (80:10:10 mol.%) exhibits excellent salt tolerance in high-saline 
synthetic brine (containing NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 salts) in the range of salt 
concentrations from 250 to 300 g.L-1. Such behavior of ternary polyampholyte was 
explained by so-called antipolyelectrolyte effect as a result of screening the positively 
and negatively charged monomers by added salts, leading to expansion (or unfold￾ing) of the macromolecular chains. Therefore, for ternary polyampholyte AAm-AP￾TAC-AMPS (80:10:10 mol.%), an increase in solution viscosity and a signifcant 
enhancement in rheological properties in high-salinity brine is observed. The appli￾cation of the ternary polyampholyte noticeably enhanced the rheological properties 
of bentonite/polymer dispersions, such as apparent viscosity, yield stress, and gel 
strength, even in high-salinity (35 wt.%) NaCl brine at 25°C [79]. As a result, it was 
considered a suitable choice for drilling fuid applications. The excellent rheological  
224 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
properties of the bentonite/ternary polyampholyte dispersion can be attributed to the 
strong chemical interactions between the functional groups of the terpolymer and the 
positively charged edges of the bentonite platelets. The interaction between bentonite 
and ternary polyampholyte in brine can be explained by two distinct mechanisms. 
The frst mechanism is adsorption of terpolymer onto bentonite. The second mecha￾nism is ionic interaction between the negatively charged functional groups of macro￾molecules and the positively charged edges of bentonite platelets. 
The structure formation of bentonite clay suspensions in the presence of the 
2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid–allylamine (AMPS-AA)  amphoteric 
copolymer was studied [94]. The static shear stress of the bentonite suspension was 
investigated at different polymer concentrations and monomer molar ratios. The anti￾microbial activity of the copolymer AMPS-AA against sulfate-reducing bacteria with 
different molar composition was studied. Based on the research results, AMPS-AA 
amphoteric copolymer was suggested to be a structuring and antibacterial agent for 
bentonite clay. 
7.4 POLYAMPHOLYTES IN STABILIZATION 
OF COLLOID DISPERSIONS 
Regulation of the physicochemical properties and stabilization of colloid dispersions 
by polyampholytes is of great interest from the theoretical [95, 96] and practical 
[97–101] points of view. Synthetic polyampholytes can stabilize polystyrene latex 
and barium sulfate suspension [102, 103], coal–water mixture [104] and barium 
titanate slurries [105] nano-SiO2 [106], cement paste [107–109, 13–15], bentonite 
[110, 111], black inkjet inks [112], and other polydisperse particles. 
Most of the polyampholytes used as dispersants are ternary copolymers contain￾ing in macromolecular chain nonionic and/or anionic monomers acrylamide (AAm), 
sodium salt of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid AMPSNa, sodium poly￾styrenesulfonate (PSSNa), sodium allylsulfonate (SAS), acrylic acid (AAc), and meth￾acrylic acid (MAA) and cationic monomers N,N-dimethyl-N,N-diallylammonium 
chloride (DMDAAC), [3-(methacryloylamino)propyl]trimethylammonium chloride 
(MAPTAC), methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (METMAC). 
Another widespread type of dispersants is based on amphoteric polycarboxylate (APC) 
composed of AAc, ω-hydroxy polyethylene glycol ether (HPEG), and DMDAAC. 
Sometimes the copolymers of [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) 
ammonium hydroxide (SBMA) with unsaturated carboxylic acids are also applied as 
amphoteric dispersants. 
Usually, polymeric dispersants for aqueous slurries are comb-type polymers 
containing carbon affnic groups that provide strong, cohesive adsorption onto the 
particle surface and water-compatible chains that provide steric stabilization. A coal– 
water mixture slurry (CWS) belongs to alternate fuel to replace fuel oil for electric 
power generation. A  CWS should have a high solid fraction and suffcient fuid￾ity for easy transportation, storage, and combustion [113]. Amphoteric dispersants 
composed of MAA, SAS, and METMAC exhibited better fuidity and stability, 
improved hydrophobicity of coal surface, and decreased surface free energy, leading 
to decrease in the apparent viscosity of CWS. According to established theory, the Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 225 
dispersant works by adsorbing on the coal particles surface and further improving 
surface properties. Therefore, the adsorption process has signifcant infuences on 
the dispersion performance of dispersant. In general, the adsorption of dispersant on 
coal particles is mainly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between 
the dispersant and coal surface. However, the composition of coal surface is com￾plex: a partial positively and negatively charged area exists on the coal surface due 
to the presence of cations in ash and the ionization of oxygen functional groups. The 
adsorption-and-dispersion mechanism of CWS by amphoteric poly(sodium p-styrene 
sulfonate-co-acrylic acid-co-diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (abbreviated as 
poly(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) is speculated, as shown in Figure 7.8 [104]. 
Since poly(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) contains, simultaneously, N+, COO−, and 
SO3 
− functional groups, the quaternary nitrogen N+ could be anchored to the nega￾tively charged area by electrostatic attraction; the COO− groups could combine with 
metal cations through the formation of a stable chelate complex, which is also benef￾cial to adsorption. It is supposed that the hydrophilic SO3 
− groups orientated to water 
will generate electrostatic repulsion among coal particles. As a result, the negatively 
charged surface of coal particles will enhance the electrostatic repulsion between 
coal particles and induce the formation of hydration flms on the coal surface. Thus, 
FIGURE 7.8 Schematic illustration of the adsorption and dispersion mechanism of poly(SS￾co-AA-co-DMDAAC) dispersant in CWS.

the synergistic effect of wetting, electrostatic repulsion, and steric hindrance effec￾tively suppresses the agglomeration of coal particles; therefore, CWS prepared using 
poly(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) as dispersant exhibits low viscosity and superior 
stability. 
Well-cementing technology has existed for more than 100 years, and chemists 
and engineers permanently continue to introduce new formulations, materials, and 
technology to meet the constantly changing needs of the energy industry. In oil/ 
gas well cementing, cement admixtures are an essential component for preventing 
the cement particle from focculating and decreasing the viscosity of the cement 
slurry, which signifcantly improves the fowability and pumpability of the cement 
paste [107–109]. Amphoteric polycarboxylates (APC) containing different cationic 
monomers, such as [3-(methacryloylamino) propyl] trimethylammonium chloride 
(MAPTAC) [114], quaternary ammonium dialkyl maleate [115], and sulfobe￾taine [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide 
(SBMA) [108], are effective dispersants for stabilization of oil well cement pastes. 
The APC dispersants with the quaternary ammonium cationic groups exhibit better 
dispersing ability of cement paste than does conventional polycarboxylate (PC) dis￾persant (Figure 7.9). 
FIGURE 7.9 Scheme of the adsorption of PC and APS dispersants on cement particles. 
Source: Reprinted with permission from Ref. [108]. Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 227 
The quaternary ammonium moieties in APC dispersants are absorbed onto the 
negatively charged hydrates and exhibit better dispersing ability than that of the 
PC dispersant. The rheological property of oil well cement paste is signifcantly 
improved with the addition of APC. APC dispersants have a higher adsorption 
amount on cement grains than the PC dispersant, resulting in retarding the cement 
hydration, which inhibits the formation and growth of hydrates in the initial period 
of the cement hydration process. APC dispersants remarkably increase the compact￾ness of set cement and enhance its microstructure, which signifcantly promotes the 
development of mechanical strength of set cement. It notably reduces yield stress and 
plastic viscosity, meanwhile increasing the fowability of cement paste. 
Another application of polyampholytes in oil well cementing is to reduce the fl￾trate loss of cement slurry. The fltrate loss control additives, in combination with the 
variety of well cementing conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and formation 
characteristics, require the development of specifc additives to meet the needs of 
well cementing. Miao et al. [116] have prepared a new generation amphoteric com￾blike copolymer and reported that this polymer signifcantly increased the required 
performance. A  high-performance fltration control agent for oil well cementing. 
A novel amphoteric polymer (TH-1) based on 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sul￾fonic acid (AMPS), acrylic acid (AAc), acrylamide (AAm), and a new cationic mon￾omer was used as a high-performance fltration control agent for oil well cementing 
[109]. The TH-1 showed high thermal stability up to 350°C and excellent fltrate 
reduction property, strong saline tolerance, and good high-temperature resistance. 
The fltrate reducer TH-1 forms a layer of adsorption membrane on the surface of 
cement particles. The cement flter cake is more compact, and the gap flling is full, 
which effciently controls the FL of cement slurry. 
7.5 POLYAMPHOLYTES IN DRAG REDUCTION 
It is well-known that among the certain additives, especially high-molecular-weight 
polymers, such as PEO, PAAm, and partially hydrolyzed PAAm, are effective to 
reduce energy loss due to friction in turbulent fow [117]. The interrelated molecular 
parameters which affect drag reduction performance are molecular mass, molecular 
mass distribution, chemical nature of polymer, branching and co- and terpolymer 
composition, concentration, solvent quality, hydrodynamic size, second virial coeff￾cient, entanglements, and energetic interactions (i.e., associations, aggregations, and 
hydrogen bonding). The drag-reduction properties of polyampholytes of widely dif￾fering structures and compositions have been extensively analyzed by McCormick 
et al. [118–122]. Most theories for drug reduction include the interaction of polymer 
molecules with vortices that are formed in turbulent fow and dissipation of energy 
necessary for the vortices to grow. This energy may be dissipated through breakage 
of primary or secondary bonds, conformational changes, and association/dissocia￾tion mechanisms and by inducing changes in the solvent structure around the macro￾molecules, or by other mechanisms. Many theories also include the concept that the 
polymer molecules act near the wall in the boundary layer. Since only a few parts per 
million (ppm) of polymer additives are involved in the drag-reduction phenomenon, 
it seems to suppose that polymer–solvent interactions play a very important role. 228 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
Obviously, polymer associates interact with a turbulent microdisturbance and dis￾rupt the disturbance by absorbing its energy and, in the process, become dissociated 
[123]. On moving out the turbulence regime, this dissociated macromolecule reverts 
back to its associated state and once again goes through the preceding process. Thus, 
polymer and bound solvent are likely involved in energy dissipation, and drag reduc￾tion is enhanced by the association/dissociation mechanism depicted in Figure 7.10. 
The drag-reduction behavior of high- and low-charge-density quenched poly￾ampholytes and polybetaines made from acrylamide (AAm), sodium 2-acrylami￾do-2-methylpropanesulfonate (AMPSNa), (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropyl)trimethy 
lammonium chloride (AMPTAC), sodium 3-acrylamido-3-methylbutanoate 
(AMBNa), and 3-(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propanesul￾fonate (AMPDAPS) was examined with a rotating disk rheometer [123]. All

copolymers and terpolymers are random, excepting for copolymer containing 50 
mol.% each of AMTAC and AMPSNa. The drag-reduction properties of various pol￾yampholytes were measured as a function of solvent ionic strength at an outer wall 
shear stress (Tw) of 1122 dyn·cm-2 and a disk Reynolds number of approximately 
850,000, which corresponds to a disk rotational speed of 1,000 rpm. ATAS-50 is 
insoluble in deionized water due to very strong intramolecular ionic associations. 
Even in 0.1 M NaCl, the percent of drag reduction (%DR) is small due to the remain￾ing intramolecular associations. ATASAM 5–5 shows a large increase in %DR as 
well as hydrodynamic volume when the solvent is changed from deionized water 
to 0.5 M NaCl. In this case, the ionic strength is effective in disrupting the intramo￾lecular ionic associations. Among all the systems studied, sulfobetaine containing 
polyampholytes have the best drag-reduction properties. The degradation profles for 
3 ppm solutions of copolymer of acrylamide with 3-(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropyl) 
dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate (DAPS-10), PAAm, and PEO in 0.5 M NaCl 
are shown in Figure 7.11 [123]. 
DAPS-10 retains approximately 60% of its initial level of drag reduction after 
100 min at 1,000 rpm in the rotating disk. Under similar conditions, PEO retains 
only 28.5% of its initial drag reduction. A good correlation between the %DR and 
NA2C (where N is the degree of polymerization, A2 is the second virial coeffcient

was found. Such correlation might be expected due to the inclusion of three impor￾tant molecular parameters: polymer length, polymer–solvent interaction, and poly￾mer content. 
An improved drag reduction for aqueous solutions showed terpolymer consisting 
of acrylamide, metal styrene sulfonate, and methacrylamidopropylmethylammo￾nium chloride (AAm-SS-MAPTAC) [124], while effcient drag reduction for a vari￾ety of organic solutions exhibited terpolymers of styrene, metal styrene sulfonate, 
and 4-vinylpyridine (S-SS-VP) [125]. 
7.6 POLYAMPHOLYTES AS POUR POINT DEPRESSANTS 
Wax inhibitors, or pour point depressants (PPD), are a kind of chemical additive that 
lowers the pour point of crude oil (the pour point defned as the lowest temperature 
at which the crude oil cannot fow due to the presence of a large amount of waxes 
called paraffn). The wax deposition on the inner walls of the pipeline may cause 
many serious problems, such as decreasing the effective diameter of the pipeline and 
even pipeline blocking [126]. 
The literature survey reveals that the effectiveness of polymer additives depends 
on many factors, such as structure and composition of asphaltene-resin-paraffn dep￾osition (ARPD), the content of long-chain and high-melting paraffns, the structure 
of polymer backbone, and branch. One of the requirements for the correct selection 
of oil depressants is affnity of their structure and size to content and structure of 
crystal-forming paraffns. The additives will be more effective when they are matched 
to the paraffn distribution in the crude [127]. Moreover, the polymeric depressants 
should contain polar functional groups to control the crystal growth and limit the size 
of wax crystals. All these requirements are realized in case of hydrophobically mod￾ifed polybetaines (HMPB), because the length of alkyl chains varies from C12 to C18 
and coincides well with the length paraffns contained in crude oils of Kazakhstan, 
while the betaine groups create a barrier for networking of wax particles. 
Earlier [128, 129], the ability of HMPB to decrease the PPT was tested with respect 
to the Kumkol–Akshabulak oil mixture (89:11 wt.%). The addition of 100–150 ppm 
polymeric depressant to crude oil decreased the PPT from +15°C to −3°C, for exam￾ple, the depression of PPT (Δ) was equal to 18°C. Later, using this methodology, 
the authors [130] synthesized the wax inhibitors based on HMPB and tested them as 
PPD and viscosity reduction for Malaysian waxy crude. It has been concluded that 
the HMPB with optimal concentration of 1,000 ppm reduces the PPT by 12°C, from 
57°C to 45°C. The viscosity of crude oil is also reduced from 5,421 cP to 3,220 cP 
upon the addition of 1,000 ppm HMPB. 
The preparation and characterization of polymeric betaines based on alkylamino￾crotonates containing C2–C6 carbon atoms were published in [131, 132]. The hydro￾dynamic, conformational, self-assembling, and ASP fooding properties of polymeric 
betaines containing C12–C18 carbon atoms were considered [133–136]. The HMPB 
containing long alkyl chains (C12H25, C13H27, C14H29, C16H33, and C18H37, and named 
as CRODDA-MAA, CROTriDA-MAA, CROTDA-MAA, CROHDA-MAA, and 
CROODA-MAA, respectively), described in Chapter 1.4, inhibited the wax deposition,        
 
Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 231 
decreased the pour point temperature (PPT), and improved the rheological characteris￾tics of the crude oils of Western Kazakhstan [137]. To evaluate the degree of inhibition 
of paraffn deposition in static regime, the “cold fnger” method was used. It was found 
that among the HMPB, the best PPD activity exhibits CROODA-MAA with the longest 
hydrocarbon atoms (C18H37) in the side chain. As seen from Table 7.2, in the presence of 
500 ppm of CROODA-MAA, the depression of PPT Δ = 18°C for crude oil from Man￾gyshlak, and Δ = 30°C for oil mixture of Buzachi–Mangyshlak (67:33 vol.%), respec￾tively. Two times increasing of the concentration of CROODA-MAA up to 1,000 ppm 
gives the Δ = 24°C for Mangyshlak and Δ = 36°C for Buzachi–Mangyshlak in compar￾ison with untreated crude oil. Further, in light of economic considerations, the CROO￾DA-MAA with concentration of 500 ppm was selected for treatment of crude oils. 
An important stage of PPD testing is in conditions of real pipeline. To test the 
asphaltene-resin-paraffn (ARP) deposition (ARPD) in dynamic regime, two model 
pipelines with different length and diameter of the pipes, for example, “small” pipe￾line with l = 3 m, d = 20 mm and “big” pipeline with l = 15 m, d = 40 mm, were con￾structed (Figures 7.12 and 7.13). It should be mentioned that both “small” and “big” 
pipelines are also used for cleaning of the inner part of pipelines from the ARPD. 
In order to have the asphaltene-resin-paraffn deposited, the crude oil was heated up to 
60°C and circulated inside a pipe for 6 h. During this time, the temperature of the cool￾ing section was maintained at 5°C. The heating and cooling regimes of oil in model pipe 
correspond to real conditions of oil transportation. After circulation of crude oil inside 
of “small” model pipeline during 6 h, the pipe section cooled at 5°C was dismantled and 
weighed. The amount of deposited ARP (E, %) was calculated according to the formula: 
m1 −m0 E = ˛100% m1 
where m0 is the mass of the pipe before ARPD (g), and m1 is the mass of the pipe after 
ARPD (g) at defnite time (t).

Table  7.3 shows the results of experiments on a model pipeline in a dynamic 
mode. After the addition of 500 ppm of the CROODA-MAA, the amount of pre￾cipitated ARP was equal approximately to 1 g. The ARPD inhibition effciency of 
500  ppm CROODA-MAA for the Buzachi oil and the Buzachi–Mangyshlak oil 
mixture reached up to 99%. The recommended temperature at which depressants 
should be added is 60–80 C, when most paraffns are in a liquid state. The wax 
inhibition mechanism includes the interaction of hydrophobic groups of HMPB 
with paraffn crystals, which prevents the formation of a dense crystal network, 
whereas the polar betaine moieties surrounding the wax surface can hinder the fur￾ther growth of crystals. 
In spite of the large number of publications devoted to PPD, until now, there has 
been no truly accepted model on the mechanism of inhibition of paraffn crystal 
formation. According to past research [137–140], the PPD mechanism with respect 
to waxy crude oil suggests the participation of hydrophobic groups of polybetaines: 
(a) in co-crystallization with paraffn crystals, (b) as center of crystallization, and (c) 
as conditioning agent of paraffn crystals. To investigate the dominant hydrophobic 
interactions between long-chain hydrocarbons and HMPB, two paraffns with lengths 
C24H50 and C36H74 were selected as models [141]. This study involved long hydrocar￾bon crystal deposition and viscosity experiments to determine the effect of HMPB 
on the nucleation and crystallization of long hydrocarbons. It was suggested that the 
hydrophobic groups of HMPB interact with paraffn crystals and either co-crystallize 
or play the role of crystallization center or, else, modify the paraffn crystals, whereas 
the polar betaine moieties surrounding the wax surface retard the further agglomera￾tion of paraffn crystals and prevent the formation of three-dimensional dense crystal 
network and gel-like structure (Figure 7.14).

technology has become an urgent task in the leather industry. Very recently, much 
of the attention of researchers has attracted the application of polyampholytes in 
the leather industry [142–147]. A couple of reviews were devoted to the applica￾tion of polyampholytes in leather post-tanning, retanning, fatliquoring agents and 
wet fnishing auxiliaries [148, 149]. Retanning agents play a vital role in enhancing 
the properties of leather [150, 151]. Amphoteric retanning agents applied in leather 
manufacturing have exhibited outstanding retanning properties. They not only keep 
the advantages of anionic retanning agents but also can be used as a fxative of tan￾ning agent, dye, and fatliquor, avoiding the fading effect caused by the use of ani￾onic materials [152]. Amphoteric acrylic and/or methacrylic polymer [153–155] and 
amphoteric polyurethane are widely used as retanning agents due to their excellent 
retanning properties [156–159]. 
Leather fatliquoring is to fx the emulsion or grease in collagen fbers through 
physical infltration and chemical binding to make collagen fbers more fexible and 
further enhance tensile and tear strength of crust leather. Different kinds of ampho￾teric fatliquors have been applied in the leather fatliquoring process. Authors in [160] 
used amphoteric copolymer surfactants in combination with castor oil in the process 
of leather fatliquoring and showed strong absorptive capacity for anionic dyes. The 
properties of chrome-free tanned leather were improved by the addition of a new 
type of biomass amphoteric leather retanning agent with the function of reducing 
free formaldehyde prepared by hydrolyzed collagen and oxidized tannin extract as 
raw materials [161]. The amphoteric amino group in collagen can capture formal￾dehyde via the Schiff base reaction, while the carboxyl group can bind a certain Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 235 
amount of formaldehyde through van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding, and the 
pore structure of collagen can also physically adsorb formaldehyde. The infuence 
of amphoteric polymers with different isoelectric pH, skeleton structure, and anionic 
ions on leather structure and properties should be systematically studied to explore 
the structure–activity relationship between amphoteric polymers and leather proper￾ties. In addition, the infuence of amphoteric polymer on the charge of leather with 
different isoelectric point can be explored under different pH conditions. The explo￾ration of the mechanism of the interaction between amphoteric polymers and leather 
can be revealed to guide the development and application of amphoteric polymers. 
Much attention should be paid to more deep and systematic studies on the effect of 
molecular weight on leather properties [148, 149]. The natural organic molecules 
and degradable chemical raw materials with low toxicity should be chosen to prepare 
amphoteric materials to serve the leather industry. In the future, it is necessary to 
develop biodegradable, low-toxicity, low-cost amphoteric polymers with good per￾formance to integrate with the chrome-free tanned system. 
7.8 POLYAMPHOLYTE-BASED SUPERCAPACITORS AND SENSORS 
Flexible, self-healing, cost-effective, and eco-friendly supercapacitors based on 
charge-balanced sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate (NaSS) and [3-(methacryloy￾lamino)propyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride (MAPTAC) [P(NaSS-MAPTAC)] 
hydrogel and biochar (produced from the low-temperature pyrolysis of biological 
wastes) were self-assembled with graphene oxide [162, 163] (Figure 7.15). The main 
advantage of swollen gel polymer electrolytes compared to liquid electrolytes is that 
polymer electrolytes are intrinsically free of leakage problems. At room temperature, 
the fabricated supercapacitor showed a high energy density of 30 W·h·kg-1 with 90% 
capacitance retention after 5,000 charge–discharge cycles at room temperature at a 
power density of 50 W·h·kg-1. At low temperature minus 30°C, the supercapacitor 
exhibited an energy density of 10.5 W·kg-1 at a power density of 500 W·kg-1. It is 
concluded that the combination of the BC-RGO electrode and the polyampholyte 
hydrogel electrolyte is promising for supercapacitors for fexible electronics and for 
low temperature environments. 
In this study, hydrogel electrolytes with immobilized pair ions are studied for the 
possibility of fexible supercapacitors. 
One-pot  copolymerization  of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), [2-(acry￾loyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (META), 2-acrylamido-2-me￾thyl-1-propanesulfonic acid  sodium  (AMPS), and  a crosslinker  is employed to 
obtain fve polymeric samples with increasing HEMA (denoted as HAS1, HAS2, 
HAS3, HAS4, HAS5) [164]. FTIR spectra confrm the reactions among HEMA,

increasing immobilized pair ions by electrochemical impedance. Raman spectra of

and contact ion pairs (CIP). Hydrogel electrolytes with more FA and less CIP pos￾sess higher ionic conductivity. The compressive strength increases with increasing 
HEMA from dynamic mechanical analysis. HAS1, HAS4, and HAS5 sandwiched 
with electrodes are selected for electrochemical studies, including electrochemical

HAS4 covers the most requirements, possessing 64.8 mS cm−1 ionic conductivity, 
65% compressive strain, and 0.45 MPa compressive strength. Therefore, the HAS4 
supercapacitor is chosen for cycle and bending tests. The HAS4 supercapacitor has 
96.3% capacitance retention after 5,000 charge/discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. Under 
bending different angles, there is no signifcant loss for the capacitance of HAS4 
supercapacitor. 
High-performance dual-network hydrogel is produced through physical and chem￾ical crosslinking between the random copolymer of 3-(methacryloylamino)propyl 
trimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesul￾fonic acid sodium salt (AMPSNa) with a certain amount of high-viscosity xanthan 
gum for fexible supercapacitors, with remarkable mechanical and thermal stabil￾ity and cycling stability [165]. In the dual-network architecture, the hydrogen bond 
occurs between amide and hydroxyl groups, while the ionic bond forms between 
sulfonic acid and quaternary ammonium salt groups, which contributes to the satis￾factory stretching property. The dual network shows high ionic conductivity (38.84 
mS·cm−1), low activation energy (0.089  eV), satisfactory mechanical properties, 
fre resistance, and sturdy contact with electrodes. In addition, the self-containing 
mobile ions inside the hydrogel electrolyte without extra electrolyte additives help to

signifcantly reduce concentration polarization. Accordingly, the quasi-solid super￾capacitor based on active carbon delivers super mechanical and thermal stability with 
no signifcant capacitance reduction after various deformations, compressing, and 
different temperatures. Besides, it delivers high specifc capacitance of 110 F·g−1 at 
0.5 A·g-1, with 87.6% retention after 10,000 cycles, showing maximum energy den￾sity and power density of 33.1 Wh·kg−1 and 200.1 W·kg−1. Notably, high capacitance 
retention (84.2 %) can be maintained after 7,500 cycles even at 50°C. Thus, this work 
provides a promising strategy to produce a kind of multifunctional hydrogel electro￾lyte for highly stable and durable next-generation fexible energy storage devices. 
A novel physical conductive hydrogel with salt contents as high as 30 wt.% was 
prepared with chitosan and sodium alginate by combining the anti-polyelectrolyte 
effect and semi-dissolution acidifcation sol-gel transition method [166]. The obtained 
hydrogels show extremely high ionic conductivities up to 2.96 · 10−1 S·cm−1 at room 
temperature and 4.9 · 10−2 S·cm−1 at −20°C. The effects of different salts on the ion 
mobility and electrochemical properties of conductive hydrogels were predicted and 
analyzed. The fexible supercapacitor assembled using chitosan and sodium alginate 
as the electrolyte exhibits specifc capacitance as high as 405 F·g−1 at the current 
density of 0.25 A·g−1 and satisfying electrochemical stability with 74.91% capaci￾tance retention in 1,000 cycles. Polyampholyte nanocomposite hydrogels consisting 
of copolymers of p-styrenesulfonate and methacrylatoethyl trimethyl ammonium 
chloride in the presence of inorganic crosslinkers graphene oxide and laponite exhib￾ited exceptional properties, including high mechanical properties (tensile strain of 
839% and tensile strength of 716  kPa), as well as outstanding ionic conductivity 
(27.3 mS·cm−1) and healable properties under various conditions [167]. They were 
proposed as a promising electrolyte for fexible and multifunctional zinc-ion batteries. 
A bimodal electronic skin (e-skin) sensor array that is capable of changing color 
as a response to a range of temperatures (26–40°C), with an ability to sense fnger 
tap (≈20 kPa pressure) as a pressure sensor, was fabricated from thermochromic liq￾uid crystal dispersed in an elastomer matrix, sandwiched by transparent electrodes 
made of ion conductive, compliant, and adhesive polyampholyte hydrogels [168]. 
The use of elastomer and tough polyampholyte hydrogel patterns renders this device 
mechanically robust and deformable. With dual parameter sensing, easy fabrication 
steps, and reasonable sensitivity, this device has potential redundancy applications in 
internet-of-things and soft robotics. 
Authors in [169] developed the quenched polyampholyte hydrogels P(NaSS-co￾DMAEA-Q), P(NaSS-co-MAPTAC), and their complexes with Zn2+ and Fe3+ ions 
that possess ultralong anti-dehydration lifespan, high ion conductivity, and temper￾ature- and humidity-responsiveness, exhibiting high potential as e-skin to monitor 
human activity. Figure 7.16 presents schematic illustrations of a representative plat￾form, which is referred to as sensor e-skin interface. 
The construction takes the form of a multilayer stack that includes a thin elasto￾meric polyurethane (PU) layer as a reversible, soft, adhesive interface to the skin; a 
functional layer that supports wireless communication and sensing signal; a PU layer 
used for the encapsulation of the temperature and strain sensors, leaving the humidi￾ty-sensing component exposed to the external environment. The electronic part of the 
functional layer consists of Ag wires printed on PU with external Bluetooth module; 238 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies

the sensing part of the functional layer consists of humidity, temperature, and strain 
sensors. E-skin can monitor human movement in real time under environmental 
changes and transmit the results to an APP through wireless devices. 
Hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to 
their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitor￾ing, and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based 
sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full￾scale human motion biomonitoring. Authors in [170] proposed a multifunctional 
MXene/polyampholytes  nanocomposite  hydrogel prepared by the one-step  radi￾cal polymerization of cationic and anionic monomers. MXene is a novel class of 
2D nanosheet material with enhanced metallic conductivity, large surface area, 
good stability, high strength, low cost, and special electrochemical properties and 
has shown huge application potential in the research area of conductive materials, 
electromagnetic shielding materials, sensors, and catalysts. MXene is also a good 
choice as a conductive fller for conductive hydrogel. The simultaneous strong and 
weak ionic bonds–based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding 
stretchable, tough, self-healing,  and adhesive properties, while the introduction 
of MXene further guaranteed excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of 
this hydrogel. The further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes is applica￾tion as wearable epidermal sensor, which strongly proved its durable accuracy and 
sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be 
assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of attention-defcit hyperac￾tivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid in ADHD treatment 
by reminding the patients to pay attention to their actions. It exhibited excellent 
toughness to ft the curved part of the human body and offered a stretching range 
of all large strains of the human body to achieve rapid monitoring of human body 
movement.  
Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 239 
Highly transparent, self-healing, and self-adhesive double-network (SADN) 
hydrogel possessing amphoteric character was suggested for wearable sensors [171]. 
It was synthesized by an alginate network physically crosslinked by calcium ions 
and interpenetrating copolymers consisting of anionic monomer sodium p-styrene 
sulfonate and cationic monomer acryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. The 
SADN hydrogel had the advantages of high sensitivity, fast response, wide sensing 
range, good stability, and a broad application prospect in human motion detection. 
During the monitoring of human movements, the wearable strain sensor was directly 
attached to volunteers’ skin, and the real-time change of the resistance of the sensor 
was recorded with an LCR meter. The large-scale movement-monitoring curves of 
human fngers, elbows, and knees are shown in Figure 7.17. 
In the case of fnger bending, when the fnger-bending angle gradually increased 
from 0° to 90°, the change of relative resistance increased from 0 to 72.5%. As 
the fngers returned from the bending to the stretching, the relative resistance also 
returned to the initial state. A  stable repetitive response was observed during the 
fve periodic scaling processes. In addition to detecting large body movements, the 
strain sensors could also detect subtle body movements. As shown in Figure 7.17D, 
a hydrogel-based strain sensor was able to detect tiny muscle movements around the 
eyebrow. A unique and relatively consistent pattern of resistance was observed when

the volunteer performed the periodic “opening–closing” movement (Figure 7.17E). 
In addition, a circular hydrogel disc was sandwiched between the sheet electrodes 
and placed directly under the heel to detect load during motion (Figure  7.17F). 
A steady repetitive response was observed during fve periodic foot-up-and-down 
cycles. This work shed a new light on the development of eco-friendly wearable sen￾sor for personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artifcial 
intelligence. 
An anti-swelling, tough, and transparent hydrogel ionic conductor composed of 
copolymer of acrylic acid (AA), a week acidic monomer, and 1-butyl-3-vinylimida￾zolium bromide (VBIBr), a cationic monomer, has been reported [172]. By carefully 
adjusting the feeding ratios of AA and VBIBr, anti-swelling, highly transparent, stretch￾able, and robust mechanical properties were realized. The resultant polyampholyte 
hydrogels exhibited ionic conductivity due to the presence of bromide and proton coun￾terions. The combination of anti-swelling property, robust mechanical performance, and 
desirable conductivity makes it possible to develop a stable underwater strain sensor to 
monitor human motions, as well as a dynamic information storage system. 
Self-healing polyampholyte hydrogels based on sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) 
and (methacryloxyethyl)trimethylammonium chloride (DMC) were developed and 
explored in constructing wearable mechanosensors, including resistive strain sensors 
and capacitive pressure sensors [173]. Resistive strain sensors assembled from such 
polyampholyte hydrogels exhibit a gauge factor (GF) of 2.9 over a strain range of 
0–350%, a low response time of 250 ms, and excellent cycling stability. The pressure 
sensors achieve a GF of 2.17 kPa–1, a sensing range of 0–7.35 kPa, and high cycling 
stability. The applications of such wearable mechanosensors in monitoring various 
strains and pressures in daily life are demonstrated. 
One review article [174] is focused on polyampholyte-based sensors that have 
demonstrated considerable potential for a variety of sensing applications. Due to 
the distinct combination of pH responsiveness, fuorescence, salt, ion, temperature, 
and fexibility sensitivity, achieved through modifcations in physical characteris￾tics, such as charge, shape, and optical qualities, polyampholyte sensors can identify 
changes in environmental circumstances and detect many stimuli at once, giving a 
more thorough picture of the monitored environment. In addition, they are useful for 
a variety of applications due to their simple integration into various formats, includ￾ing hydrogels, brush polymers, and blocks. The development of polyampholyte sen￾sors still faces certain obstacles, including the need to increase their sensitivity and 
selectivity as well as their stability over time. Nevertheless, polyampholyte sensors 
have the potential to transform sensing technology in a number of industries, includ￾ing human–machine interactions (intelligent identifcation, information secrecy, 
interactive control, and virtual reality) [175], environmental monitoring, health 
care, and food safety, with continuous research and development. A facile photoini￾tiated polymerization strategy is employed to introduce zwitterionic proline (ZP) 
into the fexible poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) matrix to prepare a stretch￾able and adhesive PHEA/ZP hydrogel with good freezing-tolerant properties [176]. 
The obtained PHEA/ZP hydrogel exhibits excellent mechanical properties (stretch 
of 810%), a self-adhesive nature, high transparency (>90%), rapid electrical self 
-healing capability, and stretchability even at −40°C.

7.9 STORAGE OF INFORMATION (OR CODING) 
ON AMPHOTERIC MACROMOLECULES 
In this subchapter, two aspects in advanced polymer science are briefy considered 
regarding information storage and polypeptide formation, with participation of 
amphoteric macromolecules, without making any claims to complete presentation of 
the material. In the last years, in scientifc literature appeared a series of publications 
that attempted to “write” information on macromolecular chains and “read” it [177– 
181]. The main idea is that polymer chains can be used for encoding a message sim￾ilar to DNA, which stores genetic information in the form of nucleotide sequences. 
For example, 200 megabytes of data, including a high-defnition music video and 
100 books, were recently stored on DNA that contained more than 1.5 billion base 
pairs [182]. However, DNA is sensitive to both hydrolysis and other degradation 
reactions, such as deamination and dimerization [180]. These issues could be over￾come with synthetic sequence-defned polymers if the backbone and side chains are 
chosen in the right way. In principle, a binary code can potentially be implemented 
in the structure of random amphoteric macromolecules using the sequences of acid 
and base monomers, defned as 0 and 1 bit (Figure 7.18) [177]. 
This possibility is exciting because it would permit the development of a new 
class of synthetic polymers which contain sequence-coded information. Amphoteric 
macromolecules could be interesting for storage of digital information in computer 
science and, further, to develop information-containing macromolecules and tech￾nology. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of “writing” information on 
macromolecular chains for the frst time was mentioned in 1978 by S. Ya. Frenkel, 
who wrote, “The time is not far when synthetic macromolecules can be used for 
record of information” [183]. 
In order to bear the “readable” information, such polymers should possess per￾fectly controlled comonomer sequences. Moreover, chemical and analytical methods 
that allow the deciphering of sequence-coded information have to be developed [1]. 
In addition, the acid–base monomers-based information storage can be considered 
as a new property of polyampholytes. The present brief review is the author’s sub￾jective opinion to invoke the specialists in polymer chemistry and physics, biology, 
FIGURE 7.18 Acid–base sequences in amphoteric macromolecules for “writing” and 
“reading’ of the information.

bioinformatics, computer science to pay attention to this exciting direction. The pos￾sibility to form monomer-coded strings of information on synthetic polymers was 
not considered yet, excepting for a few recent publications [184, 185]. Synthetic 
polymers could be an interesting alternative to DNA for molecular information 
storage. However, this implies that technical tools for coding and reading infor￾mation on synthetic polymers should be developed. This is defnitely not a trivial 
task, because similarly to biopolymers, synthetic information-containing polymers 
should have perfectly controlled molecular structures, that is, being monodisperse 
and sequence-defned [177]. 
Among the existing polyampholytes, in our opinion, the statistic copolymers con￾taining the acid–base monomers and/or polypeptides composed of different amino 
acid sequences with narrow molecular weight and sequence-controlled conforma￾tional set might be suitable objects for molecular information storage. This may be 
due to different structures and functions of polyampholytes, depending on charge 
distribution of monomers, nature of counterions, pH and dielectric constant of the 
medium, ionic strength, excluded volume effects, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic 
interactions, van der Waals that might be the perspective objects for the creation of 
molecular information storage systems [186]. The information recorded on a single 
macromolecule using binary code 0 and 1 can be “written” in a globular, coiled, or 
elongated structure of macromolecules. 
The challenging task is also to fnd the answer to the main question: How did 
amino acids polymerize to form proteins and peptides in the prebiotic era [187]? The 
chemical synthesis of polypeptides was frst discovered by Merrifeld [188], who 
demonstrated the synthesis of the model tetrapeptide L-leucyl-L-alanylglycyl-L-va￾line. As a supporter or polymer matrix for synthesis of peptides, chloromethylated 
copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene in the form of 200–400 mesh that pos￾sessed a porous gel structure was selected, which allowed easy penetration of rea￾gents, especially in the presence of swelling solvents. 
The condensation mechanism of amino acids and the formation of peptides and, 
afterward, proteins is still an unresolved hot topic in biology of life [187]. Overcom￾ing thermodynamic constraints to produce amino acid–based polypeptides is a chal￾lenging task because in water at room temperature, the condensation of amino acids 
is unfavorable both thermodynamically and kinetically [189]. Nevertheless, several 
hypotheses [190–198] were suggested, which have their own advantages and disad￾vantages. In our mind, from the thermodynamic canons and chemical point of view, 
the most attractive among them are (1) salt-induced peptide polymerization with 
the assistance of clay materials [190]; (2) the presence of a catalytically active solid 
surface leading to the condensation of glycine to oligopeptides [199]. The oligomer￾ization of glycine was observed during heating experiments conducted at 150°C for 
336 h under dry, wet, and dry–wet conditions [200]. Results of IR analysis showed 
that the Gly monomer was mainly adsorbed via hydrogen bonding between the pos￾itively charged amino groups and negatively charged surface sites (i.e., Lewis base 
sites) on the montmorillonite surface, indicating that the Lewis base site acts as a 
catalyst for peptide formation. When Gly was heated without montmorillonite, 99% 
of the Gly remained, and peptides were not detected after 336 h. Authors concluded 
that continuous dry and wet conditions are inadequate to form long peptides, and a Application of Polyampholytes in Emerging Technologies 243 
hydration–dehydration system is likely to be more suitable for chemical evolution 
of amino acids. Remarkable review of Lambert [189] surveys the polymerization 
of amino acids through their adsorption and thermal reactivity on oxide and sulfde 
minerals from a surface scientist’s point of view. It is concluded that our understand￾ing of the mechanism of peptide formation is very fragmentary, and a discussion of 
future work needed to fll the most conspicuous gaps in our knowledge of amino 
acids/mineral surfaces systems and their reactivity. Understanding the bio-physical￾chemical aspects of nanostructured biointerfaces, or so-called hybrid nanocompos￾ites, is nowadays a key issue for nanoscience [198] that deals with the adsorption 
of amino acids and peptides on zero-valent metal and metal oxide substrates. Apart 
from a comprehensive survey of literature sources, this topic considers some hints 
on peptides formation from the simplest cases, that is, one amino acid at a fat metal 
surface, and then the description of systems with increasing degree of complexity. 
The state-of-the-art of fow-through catalytic reactors based on metal nanoparticles 
immobilized within the pores of nano-, micro-, and macrosized polymeric gels and in 
the surface or hollow of polymeric membranes was reviewed in [201]. An artifcial cat￾alytic fow reactor constructed from the porous inorganic and/or polymeric materials 
containing metal nanoparticles can mimic the function of a living system, where the 
chemical synthesis proceeds through capillaries and cells [202]. The idea of the use of 
macroporous and supermacroporous cryogels as fow-through catalytic reactors was, 
for the frst time, suggested in [203, 204] and experimentally realized in [205–210] for 
hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds. In particular, the catalytic reduction of 
p-nitrobenzoic acid sodium salt (p-NBA) was carried out in a fow-through catalytic 
reactor by palladium (PdNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) immobilized within 
macroporous amphoteric cryogel based on copolymer of N,N-dimethylaminoethyl￾methacrylate (DMAEM) and methacrylic acid (MAA), P(DMAEM-co-MAA) [211]. 
In case of P(DMAEM-co-MAA)/PdNPs, the formation of only p-aminobenzoic acid 
(p-ABA) was observed. But in case of cyclic passing, the mixture of p-NBA and 
NaBH4 through P(DMAEM-co-MAA) cryogel containing AuNPs’ three main prod￾ucts was formed: (1) p-aminobenzoic acid sodium salt (p-ABA), (2) p,p’-azodibenzo￾ate, and (3) sodium 4-(4-aminobenzamido)benzoate (Figure 7.19). 
To confrm the condensation of p-ABA and formation of sodium 4-(4-aminoben￾zamido) benzoate, an aqueous solution of pure p-ABA was passed fve to ten times 
through DMAEM-co-MAA/AuNPs. As seen from 1H NMR spectra, in addition to 
H2,6 and H3,5 protons of the aromatic ring, an intense signal at δ = 8.28 ppm appears, 
which is specifc to NH groups (Figure 7.20). 
Thus, it is obvious that hydrogenation of p-NBA by DMAEM-co-MAA/AuNPs 
immobilized within amphoteric cryogel leads to the formation of peptide structure, 
for example, sodium 4-(4-aminobenzamido) benzoate, due to condensation of amine 
and carboxylic groups of p-ABA molecules. 
A direct condensation polymerization of N-alkylated p-ABA containing methyl, 
propyl, butyl, pentyl, heptyl, octyl, and heptadecyl substituents was performed for 
obtaining N-alkylated poly(p-benzamide) using hexachloroethane, triphenylphos￾phine, and pyridine as condensation reagents [212]. Taking into account that AuNPs 
immobilized within microporous amphoteric cryogel are able to produce pep￾tide structure, namely, 4-(4-aminobenzamido)benzoate, one can suppose that the 244 Polyampholytes in Advanced Polymer Science and Emerging Technologies 
FIGURE 7.19 Hydrogenation products of p-nitrobenzoic acid sodium salt over DMAEM-co￾MAA/AuNPs catalyst: (1) p-aminobenzoic acid sodium salt, (2) p,p’-azodibenzoate,

amphoteric cryogel DMAEM-co-MAA with immobilized AuNPs can also partic￾ipate in the formation of di- or tripeptides from the amino acids. The main reason 
for selecting amphoteric cryogels as a reaction medium is that the acid–base groups 
of a polymeric matrix easily reduce the gold ions and retain the functional substrate 
molecules, for instance, amino acids, via electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds

FIGURE 7.21 Speculated formation snapshot of a dipeptide on the surface of AuNPs

on the surface of cryogels to prolong their longevity, thus promoting the catalytic 
conversion. 
Multiple passing of aqueous solution of amino acid through amphoteric cryogel matrix 
loaded by AuNPs can lead to the formation of a dipeptide, as hypothesized in Figure 7.21. 
The speculative mechanism of dipeptide formation may have the following steps. 
At frst, amino acid molecules can be fxed on the surface of amphoteric cryogel 
through the electrostatic binding. Then, the myriads of gold nanoparticles located 
on the surface of macropore walls in the form of platelets, triangles, spheres, and 
nanorods can participate in catalytic condensation of zwitterionic groups of amino 
acid molecules located in the vicinity of gold nanoparticles or directly on the AuNPs’ 
surface to form a di- or tripeptide. However, further experiments are needed to prove 
(or disprove) this hypothesis. A comprehensive discussion of peptide formation from 
the amino acids may take us far into the depth of this problem. Therefore, we will 
restrict ourselves in the hope that perhaps, in the near future, scientists will be able 
to design a macromolecular structure that might look as the frst polymer of life (i.e., 
the construction of a new form of life based on completely synthetic components), 
with the capacity to reproduce themselves [186, 213].

Conclusion 
The ability of synthetic amphoteric macromolecules to adopt globular, coil, helix, 
and stretched conformations and to demonstrate coil–globule and helix–coil con￾formational transitions, as well as sol-gel and gel-sol phase transitions in relation to 
internal (composition, charge distribution, hydrophobicity, etc.) and external factors 
(pH, temperature, ionic strength, thermodynamic quality of solvents, etc.), is very 
important in mimicking the hierarchy and structural organization of proteins and 
polypeptides. 
In the last half century, several fundamental phenomena in the behavior of poly￾ampholytes have been discovered, which had been predicted and theoretically justi￾fed, and are now confrmed experimentally. 
1. The frst fxed fact is the so-called antipolyelectrolyte effect, which is 
related to the unfolding of amphoteric macromolecules at the isoelectric 
point (IEP) upon the addition of low-molecular-weight salts. Typically, 
polyampholytes that have random incorporation of charged species exhibit 
more profound antipolyelectrolyte behavior than polyampholytes with 
alternating incorporations of the anionic and cationic moieties. This is 
due to long-range electrostatic interactions in the random species versus 
the alternating ones, in which the interactions occur over short ranges. 
A stronger antipolyelectrolyte effect is specifc for block polyampholytes 
with highly blocky sequences. 
2. Another discovery is the so-called isoelectric effect, which is related to 
cooperative release (or detachment) of low- or high-molecular-weight sub￾stances at the IEP of polyampholytes as a result of charge inversion and 
prevailing of intramacromolecular (intra-MMC) complexation over inter￾macromolecular ones (inter-MMC). 
3. The third fnding is the behavioral closeness of polyelectrolyte complexes 
(PEC), which are the products of the interactions between oppositely 
charged linear polyelectrolytes and block polyampholytes. 
The position of the isoelectric pH (pHIEP) for random, regular, and block polyam￾pholytes can differ in spite of the same composition of copolymers, due to different 
distributions of the sequences of the acidic and basic monomers along the chain. Ana￾lytical approximation is an effective tool for the accurate calculation of the pHIEP for 
most natural and synthetic polyampholytes. The electrostatic interactions between 
the strongly charged monomeric units of polyampholytes are of primary interest 
because the properties of quenched polyampholytes in a solution depend on charge 
density, charge balance, charge spacing, and distribution, as well as the ionic strength 
of the solution adjusted using low-molecular-weight salts. Commonly, the position 
of the pHIEP of charge-balanced and charge-imbalanced quenched polyampholytes 
slightly depends on pH. Polyampholytes that have unbalanced charge ratios and 
higher charge asymmetries exhibit both polyampholyte and polyelectrolyte behavior, 260 Conclusion 
depending on the degree of charge imbalance. As the degree of charge imbalance on 
a polyampholyte chain increases, the polymer tends to behave in a manner that is 
more characteristic of a conventional polyelectrolyte. In some cases, the conforma￾tion of unbalanced quenched polyampholytes can be considered a core–shell struc￾ture, where the core part exists as a polyampholyte, and the shell part represents a 
polyelectrolyte. The addition of low-molecular-weight salts tends to shrink the shell 
part (polyelectrolyte region) and to swell the core part (polyampholyte region). Such 
antagonism causes competition between the polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte 
effects and, under specifc conditions, determines the overall conformational state 
of amphoteric macromolecules. The existence of the core–shell structure has clearly 
been demonstrated for linear block and dendritic polyampholytes. The formation 
of intraionic salt bonds at the pHIEP has been observed for amphoteric di-, tri-, and 
multiblock copolymers, random- and comb-type polyampholytes, and ampholytic 
diblock copolypeptides. For most polybetaines, the determination of the IEP is not 
possible, due to fully charged zwitterionic moieties cancelling out annealed poly￾meric betaines with unusually low pHIEP values. 
Macromolecular complexes of polyampholytes represent the products of com￾plexation of linear and crosslinked synthetic polyampholytes, possessing random, 
regular, graft, block, and dendritic microstructures, with polyelectrolytes, proteins, 
surfactants, metal ions, dyes, drugs, disperse particles, and nanoparticles. The stabil￾ity of polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte complexes depends on the charge distribution 
of the polyampholyte chain and increases in the order block polyampholyte–polye￾lectrolyte > statistical polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte > alternating polyampholyte– 
polyelectrolyte. The same order is adequate for polyampholyte–protein complexes. 
Block polyampholytes bind the anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes, as well as 
proteins and DNA, more cooperatively in comparison with random and alternative 
polyampholytes. Selective complexation of block polyampholytes with proteins can 
be used for the separation of proteins from their mixture. The release of proteins 
and DNA can take place at the pHIEP of block polyampholyte when the cooperative 
intraionic contacts between anionic and cationic blocks prevail over the interionic 
contacts between block polyampholyte and protein (or DNA). 
Complexation of acid–base groups of annealed polyampholytes with transition 
metal ions can proceed via ionic, coordination, or ion-coordination bonds. The inter￾action of polyampholytes with ionic surfactants leads to the formation of compact 
particles (or precipitates) stabilized by the hydrophobic contacts of the long alkyl 
chain of detergents. The compact polyampholyte–surfactant complexes are pre￾served in aqueous solution with the help of noncomplexing, or free, monomeric units 
of copolymers. The formation of intramolecular micelle structures and the drastic 
reduction of surface tension are specifc to polyampholyte–surfactant systems. Pen￾etration of surfactants inside the amphoteric hydrogel volume can lead to the forma￾tion of micelles within the hydrogel matrix, hydrophobization of the whole system, 
and overall shrinking of hydrogel volume. Binding of dye molecules by polyam￾pholytes is accompanied by the accumulation of dye molecules within the hydropho￾bic region of the macromolecular complex. 
The stimuli-responsive properties of polyampholytic hydrogels and cryogels with 
respect to temperature, pH, salinity, and ratio of water–organic solution are similar Conclusion 261 
to the behavior of linear amphoteric macromolecules. Polyampholyte hydrogels and 
cryogels with anionic and cationic offsets behave in typical polyelectrolyte character. 
The charge-balanced polyampholyte hydrogels and cryogels swell upon the addition 
of low-molecular-weight salts, due to the disruption of intra- and interionic contacts, 
and so demonstrate the antipolyelectrolyte effect. Polyampholyte hydrogels prepared 
using random copolymerization of oppositely charged ionic monomers at relatively 
high monomer concentrations and equimolar monomer ratios represent a new class 
of physical hydrogels containing both strong and weak ionic bonds. The permanent 
crosslinks maintain the shape of the gel, while the ionic bonds, acting as a sacri￾fcial network, are responsible for elongation, deformation, adhesion, self-healing, 
shape memory, and other important functions. The isoelectric effect that is related 
to cooperative release of low- or high-molecular-weight substances (such as metal 
ions, dyes, surfactants, polyelectrolytes, and proteins) at the IEP of water-soluble 
polyampholytes also takes place at the IEP of polyampholyte cryogels. Furthermore, 
molecularly imprinted polyampholyte hydrogels and cryogels are promising materi￾als for biomedical applications. 
Polyampholytes themselves, polyampholyte–metal complexes, and polyam￾pholyte–metal nanoparticles can mimic the functions of enzymes and catalyze the 
reactions of hydrolysis, decomposition, hydrogenation, and oxidation of various sub￾strates. Macroporous amphoteric cryogels containing metal nanoparticles in pores can 
be used for catalytic reactions as batch-type and continuous-fow-type reactors. There 
is interest in immobilization (or imprinting) of enzymes within three-dimensional 
polymers, acting as monolith reactors, microcapsules, and membranes. Such an 
approach can offer new monolith fow-through reactors, which are catalytically sev￾eral orders of magnitude more effcient and can be continuously used for long peri￾ods. A precise combination of enzymes, mono- and bimetallic nanoparticles within 
nano-, micro-, and macro-sized polymeric gels, and membranes can create syner￾getic effects in fow-through catalytic reactions. Inspired by light-driven biological 
photosynthesis, photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen has become 
a key concept for simple and cost-effective solar energy conversion. In this light, 
polyampholyte/polyzwitterionic hydrogels represent a promising scaffold for photo￾catalytic reactions by immobilizing both photosensitizer dyes and catalysts in close 
proximity, facilitating electron transfer steps, and allowing other additives and prod￾ucts to move freely through the pores of the hydrogel. Such hydrogels can be used 
for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. 
Applications of polyampholytes include the felds of environmental protection, 
the petroleum industry, biotechnology, and medicine. Linear and crosslinked pol￾yampholytes exhibit salt-tolerant, thermal-resistant, shear-stable, self-healing, anti￾fouling, self-assembling, and stimuli-responsive properties that could have a broad 
impact on the areas of wastewater purifcation, desalination, enhanced oil recovery, 
stabilization of colloid dispersions, drag reduction, structural biomaterials, con￾trolled drug delivery systems, energy storage devices, supercapacitors, and actuators, 
among others. 
A further potential development in polyampholytes includes intrinsically dis￾ordered proteins (IDPs) belonging to strong polyampholytes, polypeptide-based 
polyampholytes, and polyampholytic ionic liquids. Complex coacervation, or  
 
 
262 Conclusion 
liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), is a common phenomenon in globular pro￾teins, IDPs, amphoteric polypeptides, synthetic polyampholytes, and interpolye￾lectrolyte complexes. The simplifed molecular design principles developed for 
synthetic polyampholytes can provide some insights into the more complicated 
sequences of IDPs and an understanding of how charge-driven LLPS can be 
designed by tuning the patterning of charged monomers. Therefore, synthetic poly￾ampholytes, ampholytic polypeptides, and IDPs might be considered to be a single 
focal point, indicating the multidisciplinary character of research into amphoteric 
macromolecules. 
The structural similarity between IDPs, polypeptide-based, and synthetic polyam￾pholytes can be summarized as follows: 
1. Both IDPs and synthetic polyampholytes adopt globular, coil, and stretched 
conformation and show similar diagram of states as a function of the charge 
asymmetry, expressed, in the former case, as the fraction of charged resi￾dues FCR = (f+ + f−) and net charge per residue NCPR = |f
+ − f−|, and in lat￾ter case as δf = | f
+ − f
−| and fraction of charged monomers f = f+ + f− (where 
f+ and f− are the fractions of positive and negative charges, respectively). 
2. pH- or charge-dependent conformation of block polyampholyte and syn￾thetic polypeptide can comprise of double-stranded helical conformation 
and β-sheet that are specifc for proteins. 
3. A number of theoretical works devoted to charge fuctuation effects on 
the shape, phase separation, aggregation, swelling–deswelling of fexible 
linear and crosslinked polyampholytes highlight the role of electrostatic 
interactions between oppositely charged monomers in IDPs. 
A separate issue are hydrophobically modifed polyampholytes. The introduction of 
hydrophobic groups into the composition of polyampholytes leads to the formation 
of self-organized systems, such as monolayers, micelles, vesicles, or other highly 
organized structures. 
Key problems of the process of protein folding have defnitely intensifed the 
rapid development of polyampholyte theory, because an understanding of the protein 
folding mechanism on the level of synthetic analogs can be of help in explaining 
the structural–functional relationship. Indeed, several theoretical models have been 
developed to adequately explain the behavior of polyampholytes and simulate pro￾tein folding. 
Future possibilities regarding polyampholytes may be related to semi-natural pol￾yampholytes that can be prepared through the modifcation of such natural poly￾saccharides as chitosan, cellulose, starch, gellan, and alginic acid, among others, 
through the introduction of either carboxylic (sulfo) or amine (ammonium) groups, 
or both, into the macromolecular chains. 
Up to now, there are only episodic studies on the mucoadhesive properties of pol￾yampholytes. Design and fabrication of amphoteric mucoadhesive macromolecules 
might be the newest and perspective research felds in mucoadhesion. Among the 
expanding range of mucoadhesive polymers, in our opinion, attention should also be Conclusion 263 
paid to homo- and copolypeptides, which are the closest analogues of proteins and 
have recently found a wide application as drug delivery systems. 
Understanding the fundamental relationships between the microstructures and 
properties of synthetic, natural, and semi-natural polyampholytes, accompanied 
by systematic evaluation of the available literature, is expected to open renewed 
interest in theory and experimentation in advanced polymers, including emerging 
technologies. 265
